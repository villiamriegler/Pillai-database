2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication as initially proposed for Segluromet is: 
Segluromet is indicated in adults aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct 
to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control: 
• 
• 
in patients not adequately controlled on their maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone 
in patients on their maximally tolerated doses of metformin along with other glucose-lowering

• 
in patients already being treated with the combination of ertugliflozin and metformin as 
separate tablets. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
The increasing worldwide prevalence of T2DM, along with its microvascular and macrovascular 
complications, is a major health issue and poses an increasing burden to health care systems around 
the world.  The worldwide prevalence of diabetes in adults (age 20 years to 79 years) is expected to 
increase from 8.8% in 2015 (approximately 415 million people) to an estimated 10.4% (642 million 
people) by 2040; this represents a 55% increase in the number of people with diabetes relative to 
2015.  Approximately 90% of these diabetic patients have T2DM.  In the United States (US), diabetes 
currently affects 29.1 million people or 9.3% of all adults and 26% of adults over 65 years of age.  In 
2015 in Europe, the estimated number of people with diabetes was 59.8 million, which is expected to 
increase to 71.1 million by 2040.  The prevalence of diabetes in Europe was 9.1% in 2015 and 
expected to increase to 10.7% by 2020.  
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation 
T2DM, the predominant type of diabetes accounting for >90% of all diabetes cases, is a progressive 
disease involving parallel defects of glucose metabolism in multiple tissues. Key processes leading to 
T2DM include peripheral insulin resistance, insulin secretory dysfunction, and hepatic glucose 
overproduction. The condition is associated with hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and increased body 
weight.  The co-morbidities associated with uncontrolled diabetes are significant.  Diabetes is the 
major cause of kidney failure, blindness, and non-traumatic leg amputations among adults in the US 
and the United Kingdom (UK), and is a leading cause of coronary heart disease and stroke.  
Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of mortality in patients with diabetes, with life 
expectancy reduced by as much as 10 years in people with T2DM.  
Common risk factors for T2DM include increasing age, smoking, being overweight or obese, physical 
inactivity and poor nutrition, family history of T2DM, race/ethnicity (eg, African American, Latino, 
American Indian, Asian American, and Pacific Islander), hypertension, impaired glucose metabolism 
(“prediabetes”), and gestational diabetes.

2.1.4.  Management 
Studies have found that by improving glycaemic control with pharmacological intervention, the risk of 
microvascular complications is significantly reduced.  Long-term data from the United 
Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) also suggests that glycaemic control reduces the risk of 
macrovascular complications of T2DM.  Although pharmacological intervention, either in the form of a 
single agent or in combination, may provide effective glycaemic control for some patients, many do not 
achieve their target A1C levels, and glycaemic control deteriorates over time.   
Current guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the 
Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommend a stepwise and individualized treatment approach to T2DM.  
These guidelines recommend metformin as the optimal first-line anti-hyperglycaemic agent (AHA), 
unless the patient has contraindications to metformin.  Subsequently, if the A1C target is not achieved 
after approximately 3 months, therapy should be augmented to a 2-drug combination followed by the 
addition of other AHAs approximately every 3 months if the A1C goal is not achieved.  
Despite the availability of a broad array of AHAs, only approximately half of patients with T2DM 
achieve glycaemic control per treatment guidelines.  Furthermore, while new classes of AHA 
medications have been introduced over the last decade, the percentage of patients reaching glycaemic 
targets has not improved.  There are several factors contributing to the low attainment of A1C goals.  
First, patients with T2DM exhibit declining -cell function, which influences disease progression and 
leads to elevated A1C levels over time.  Second, increased body weight leads to worsening insulin 
resistance.  Finally, several classes of anti-hyperglycaemic medications are associated with adverse 
reactions, including weight gain (which may further worsen underlying insulin resistance), 
hypoglycaemia, oedema, or gastrointestinal effects, which often limit their use. 
The management of chronic diseases like T2DM is often limited by clinical inertia: the delay or failure 
to escalate or alter therapy when the therapeutic effect is not attained. One way to prevent delays in 
achieving the desired therapeutic effect include initiating treatment with FDC therapies, as this often 
achieves the desired goal without the need for alterations in therapy. In addition, use of a combination 
of two different classes of agents may improve the initial efficacy of the treatment. Finally, use of a 
FDC has been shown to improve adherence with the treatment regimen. 
As the pathogenesis of T2DM involves multiple metabolic defects, combination therapy with AHA 
agents that have different mechanisms of action can achieve robust reductions in A1C enabling 
patients to reach treatment goals.  
The ertugliflozin/metformin FDC combines 2 AHAs with complementary mechanisms of action to 
improve glycaemic control in patients with T2DM. Metformin improves glucose tolerance in patients 
with T2DM, lowering both basal and PPG. Metformin improves glycaemic control mainly through a 
decrease in hepatic glucose production, while also decreasing intestinal absorption of glucose and 
improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Combination 
therapy with ertugliflozin and metformin could also be beneficial given the findings that glucosuria 
produced by SGLT2 is accompanied by an increase in endogenous glucose production, which is possibly 
the result of an increase in glucagon, while metformin improves glycaemic control (in part) by 
decreasing hepatic glucose production.

About the product 
This is an application for the use of ertugliflozin (MK-8835, PF-04971729) administered as a fixed-dose 
combination (FDC) with immediate-release metformin hydrochloride.  Ertugliflozin is a new chemical 
entity belonging to the class of oral, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. 
The commercial formulation of the ertugliflozin/metformin FDC is a film-coated immediate-release 
tablet for oral administration available in 6 dose strengths to be dosed bid, four of these are proposed 
for the EU Market:  
 
 
 
 
Ertugliflozin 2.5 mg/metformin 850 mg FDC tablet 
Ertugliflozin 7.5 mg/metformin 850 mg FDC tablet 
Ertugliflozin 2.5 mg/metformin 1000 mg FDC tablet 
Ertugliflozin 7.5 mg/metformin 1000 mg FDC tablet.  
Ertugliflozin is an oral, selective inhibitor of sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) which inhibits 
renal glucose reabsorption and results in urinary glucose excretion (UGE) and reductions in plasma 
glucose and haemoglobin A1c (A1C) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It possesses a 
high selectivity for SGLT2 versus SGLT1 and other glucose transporters (GLUT1-4).  
Ertugliflozin is a new chemical entity with a chemical name of (1S,2S,3S,4R,5S)-5-[4-Chloro-3- (4-
ethoxybenzyl)phenyl]-1-hydroxymethyl-6,8-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2,3,4-triol. Ertugliflozin is 
included in the drug product as a cocrystal with L-pyroglutamic acid (L-PGA), known as ertugliflozin L-
PGA. Ertugliflozin is formulated as an immediate-release tablet for oral administration at 5 and 15 mg 
strengths. The tablets are manufactured with a conventional direct compression process, utilizing 
conventional excipients and common blend (5% active). Dose strengths are expressed as ertugliflozin 
free form. 
Metformin hydrochloride is an AHA that improves glucose tolerance in patients with T2DM by lowering 
both basal and post-prandial plasma glucose (PPG). It is not chemically or pharmacologically related to 
any other class of oral AHA. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal 
absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and 
utilization. Metformin is approved for use in the US, Europe, and other countries and has an 
established safety and tolerability profile. 
Type of Application and aspects on development

2.2.2.  Active Substance - ertugliflozin 
General information 
The active substance is presented in the form of ertugliflozin with L-pyroglutamic acid in a 1:1 ratio.  
The chemical name of ertugliflozin L-pyroglutamic acid is (1S,2S,3S,4R,5S)-5-(4-chloro-3-(4-
ethoxybenzyl)phenyl)-1-(hydroxymethyl)-6,8-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2,3,4-triol, compound with 
(2S)-5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid, corresponding to the molecular formula C27H32ClNO10. It has a 
relative molecular mass of 566.00 g/mol. 
Ertugliflozin and ertugliflozin L-pyroglutamic acid (L-PGA) have the following structures:

Figure 1: Ertugliflozin L-PGA structure 
The chemical structure of ertugliflozin L-PGA was elucidated and confirmed by a combination of IR, 
ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, UV-Vis spectroscopy and crystal X-ray diffraction tests.  
Solid state forms and polymorphism have been evaluated extensively by diverse crystallization 
techniques including slurries, solvent evaporations, grinding and thermal techniques. The ertugliflozin 
L-PGA co-crystal was determined to be an anhydrous crystal form with a 1:1 stoichiometry 
(ertugliflozin free form to L-PGA). This crystal form is non-hygroscopic, high-melting and both 
chemically and physically stable under normal manufacturing and storage conditions. This form was 
identified through extensive form screening experiments and crystallization studies and is the only 
form of ertugliflozin L-PGA. All batches of ertugliflozin L-PGA have been consistent. In addition, 
confirmation of form has been evaluated as part of the supportive and primary stability programs (36 
months & 12 months at 25 °C/60% RH; respectively) using powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) with no 
changes being observed.  
Ertugliflozin L-PGA is a white to off-white powder. Ertugliflozin is very slightly soluble in water and 
aqueous media over the physiological pH range.  
Ertugliflozin exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of five asymmetric centres 
(1S,2S,3S,4R,5S). Ertugliflozin L-PGA has an additional stereocentre in the L-PGA molecule (2S 
configuration). The risk assessment and control strategy for potential stereoisomers were adequately 
described in the manufacturing process development. The manufacturing process consistently 
produces the desired stereoisomer.  
Based on the review of the data the CHMP considers that ertugliflozin could be qualified as a new 
active substance in itself. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Ertugliflozin L-PGA is synthesized in six main steps using well defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications. The manufacturing process has been developed, in parallel with the clinical 
development program, using a combination of conventional univariate studies and elements of QbD 
such as risk assessment and design of experiment (DOE) studies, in accordance with ICH Q8 and ICH 
Q11, to define the commercial manufacturing process of ertugliflozin L-PGA.  
Development  focused  on  building  an  understanding  of  the  functional  relationships  between  material 
attributes, process  parameters, and the critical quality  attributes  (CQAs).  The process understanding, 
developed  for  each  step  of  the  process,  was  used  to  define  the  manufacturing  process  and  control 
strategy.  A  structured  quality  risk  management  approach  was  employed  to  identify  potential  critical 
process  parameters  and  critical  material  attributes  based  on  risk  of  impact  to  the  ertugliflozin  L-PGA 
CQAs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018

The study of the process led to an understanding of the functional relationships between process 
parameters and material attributes and ertugliflozin L-PGA CQAs, based on knowledge gained through 
development of ertugliflozin L-PGA, the scientific literature, and prior knowledge. A number of critical 
process parameters, material attributes, and in-process controls were then identified.Adequate in-
process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The suggested GMP 
synthesis is considered short but is acceptable based on the additional information provided in the 
dossier regarding synthesis and control of starting materials, control of critical steps and intermediates 
and the applied control strategy.  
Changes introduced during development have been presented in sufficient detail and have been 
justified. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is 
considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in in two sealed, low density polyethylene (LDPE) anti-static liners 
which comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. The bagged material is 
then inserted in a high density polyethylene (HDPE) drum or equivalent secondary container.

from forced degradation / stress conditions studies were also provided.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Active Substance - Metformin hydrochloride 
General information

2.2.4.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Segluromet 2.5 mg/850 mg film-coated tablets are presented as beige, 18 x 10 mm oval, film-coated 
tablet debossed with “2.5/850” on one side and plain on the other side. 
Segluromet  2.5  mg/1000  mg  film-coated  tablets  are  presented  as  pink,  19.1  x  10.6  mm  oval,  film-
coated tablet debossed with “2.5/1000” on one side and plain on the other side. 
Segluromet 7.5 mg/850 mg film-coated tablets are presented as dark brown, 18 x 10 mm oval, film-
coated tablet debossed with “7.5/850” on one side and plain on the other side. 
Segluromet  7.5  mg/1000  mg  film-coated  tablets  are  presented  as  red,  19.1  x  10.6  mm  oval,  film-
coated tablet debossed with “7.5/1000” on one side and plain on the other side. 
The tablets are packed in non-perforated Alu/PVC/PA/Alu blisters or in perforated Alu/PVC/PA/Alu unit 
dose blisters.  
The pharmaceutical development of the finished product followed an enhanced approach using a 
combination of conventional univariate studies and elements of QbD such as risk assessment, design of 
experiment (DOE) studies and manufacturing experience across a range of scales and equipment 
types, in accordance with ICH Q8. Design spaces and proven acceptable ranges (PARs) are claimed for 
a number of the manufacturing stepsand were acceptably justified.The quality target product profile 
(QTPP) was defined as an immediate release dosage form, which is bioequivalent to co-administration 
of corresponding monotherapy tablets, that meets compendial and other relevant quality standards. 
The QTPP categories were translated into product Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs).   
Metformin granules were selected for development of the finished product due to poor compactibility of 
metformin HCl and its high drug load in the tablet formulation. Compatibility of ertugliflozin L-PGA and

metformin HCl was demonstrated by an accelerated stability assessment paradigm screen. Excipients 
were chosen to provide a stable formulation that would be bioequivalent to the individual monotherapy 
tablets when co-administered. Excipient compatibility studies for ertugliflozin were conducted and 
confirmed compatibility. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is 
compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this 
report. 
Both ertugliflozin and metformin monotherapy tablets and ertugliflozin / metformin fixed dose 
combination tablets were used throughout the clinical development programme. Two bioequivalence 
studies were conducted comparing ertugliflozin/metformin tablets 7.5 mg/1000 mg and 7.5 mg/850 
mg strengths with respective strengths of EU sourced Glucophage® (metformin HCl) co-administered 
with ertugliflozin monocomonent tablets. Both strengths of ertugliflozin/metformin tablets were found 
to be bioequivalent to their respective monolithic tablet combinations. Dissolution results showed 
>85% release of ertugliflozin and metformin HCl in 15 minutes for all four strengths of 
ertugliflozin/metformin tablets. The very rapid dissolution over the physiological pH range along with 
the demonstrated BE between higher strength ertugliflozin fixed dose combinations and co-
administration of the respective individual components for ertugliflozin/metformin 7.5 mg/ 850 mg and 
ertugliflozin/metformin 7.5 mg/1000 mg tablet strengths, supports the waiver for additional clinical 
bioequivalence studies of the two other strengths of ertugliflozin/metformin fixed dose combination 
tablets. 
The sizes of the tablets are rather large, however, bioavailability for crushed tablets has been 
demonstrated and a comment regarding the possibility to crush the tablet to enhance swallowability 
has been added to the SmPC. 
The manufacturing process was developed in parallel to the formulation development and clinical 
development programs. Formulation attributes and process parameters were categorized as either 
critical or non-critical, based on their impact on the product quality and the QTPP. An understanding of 
the relationships between formulation attributes and process parameters and the critical quality 
attributes (CQAs) of the finished product was developed and this process understanding was used to 
define the manufacturing process. 
A structured, quality risk management approach was employed, for each step of the manufacturing 
process, to identify potentially critical process parameters and assess their impact on drug product 
quality and, as a result, their potential to impact product safety and/or efficacy. The risk assessment 
was performed based upon prior knowledge (including literature and platform understanding), as well 
as the knowledge gained throughout the development and scale up of the manufacturing process. 
The results of the process understanding studies were analysed in order to determine if the identified 
parameters have the potential to significantly impact the CQAs, and to identify the ranges within which 
the process can be operated to produce material that meets the defined acceptance criteria for finished 
product quality attributes associated with in-process and release testing. Design spaces and proven 
acceptable ranges (PARs) are claimed for a number of the manufacturing steps and were acceptably 
justified.  
Ertugliflozin L-PGA is a BCS Class 1 substance and metformin HCl is a BCS Class 3 substance. The 
combined immediate release dosage form is bioequivalent to co-administration of corresponding 
monocomponent tablets. Ertugliflozin and metformin HCl are highly soluble at 37 ± 0.5 °C across the 
physiological pH range, and the tablets are rapidly dissolving. A dissolution method with appropriate

choice of medium, apparatus and agitation rate used to release clinical batches, support development 
and to assess stability. 
Considering a rapid tablet disintegration time (<15 minutes) and highly soluble active substances,and 
that disintegration testing exhibits more response to the tablets hardness, disintegration was therefore 
proposed and accepted, in line with ICH Q6A, as the finished product quality control method for 
evaluating active substance release from Segluromet tablets.  
The primary packaging is Alu/PVC/PA/Alu perforated or non-perforated blisters. The material complies 
with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice  of  the container closure system  has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The tabletting manufacturing process consists of six main steps:  
1.  Metformin granulation 
2.  Blending/Lubrication, 
3.  Compression, 
4.  Film coating, 
5.  Bulk packaging, 
6.  Primary packaging. 
The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Appropriately justified design spaces and proven acceptable ranges (PARs) are claimed for a number of 
the manufacturing steps.  
A  process  validation  protocol  has  been  provided.  The  applicant’s  position  that  the  manufacturing 
process  can  be  considered  as  standard  despite  having  <  2%  drug  load  for  the  ertugliflozin  L-PGA 
cocrystal  all  strengths,  was  accepted.  Considering  the  extensive  development  studies  which  have 
demonstrated that there is no increased risk to meeting critical quality attributes relative to the  < 2% 
drug load of ertugliflozin L-PGA, that development studies at the commercial manufacturing site cover 
the  full  range  of  commercial  batch  sizes  that  are  proposed,  and  bracket  all  dose  strengths,  and  that 
the manufacturing process is otherwise straightforward, this was considered acceptable. The applicant 
has  confirmed  that  commercial  scale  process  validation  will  be  performed  prior  to  the  release  of  the 
finished product for commercial use.  
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form; 
description,  identification  ertugliflozin  (HPLC,  UV),  identification  metformin  (HPLC,  UV),  assay 
ertugliflozin  (HPLC  or  UPLC),  assay  metformin  (HPLC),    degradation  products  ertugliflozin  (HPLC  or 
UPLC),  degradation  products  metformin  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  ertugliflozin  (Ph.  Eur.), 
uniformity of dosage units metformin (Ph. Eur.)  and disintegration (Ph. Eur.). 
The specification parameters and acceptance criteria have been appropriately justified in line with 
relevant EMA / ICH guidelines and Ph. Eur. requirements. As ertugliflozin and metformin are highly 
soluble, classified as BCS class 1 and BCS class 3 respectively, based on the criteria of ICH Q6A and 
Assessment report

the development and batch data provided by the applicant, the replacement of dissolution testing by 
disintegration testing at release and stability is acceptable.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for batches of each strength of finished product. The results 
confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification.  
Stability of the product 
A  bracketing  approach  was  used  for  the  stability  studies  of  four  tablet  strengths  based  on  minimum 
and maximum ertugliflozin drug load to excipient ratio.The bracketing approach was considered to be 
acceptable. 
Stability data for finished product stored for up to 18 months under long term conditions (30ºC / 75% 
RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40ºC  /  75%  RH)  were  provided.  These 
batches of Segluromet are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
packaging (Al/Al blister packs) proposed for marketing. 
All  samples  were  tested  in  line  with  the  finished  product  stability  specification  for  appearance,  assay 
(HPLC), degradation products (HPLC) and disintegration (Ph. Eur.). The analytical procedures used are 
stability indicating. In addition, the stability samples were evaluated for water content, water activity, 
dissolution, hardness and microbial purity.  
All results comply with the proposed specification. No consistent or significant stability trends were 
observed for appearance, assay, individual or total degradation products, dissolution, disintegration, 
water activity/content, hardness or microbial purity.  
One batch per strength was subjected to photostability stress testing under the conditions of ICH Q1B. 
The  results  indicated  no  change  in  assay  or  physical  characteristics  when  compared  with  the  control 
samples. Results of bulk hold time study were also provided.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years with no special storage conditions 
as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 & 6.4) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
None of the components used in the manufacture of ertugliflozin/metformin tablets are of human or 
animal origin. The magnesium stearate used to manufacture Segluromet tablets is of vegetable origin. 
2.2.5.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

and metformin hydrochloride) and finished product (film-coated tablets) has been presented in a 
satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Segluromet contains an active substance which was previously authorised in a medicinal product 
(metformin, in GLUCOPHAGE), and an active substance which was not previously authorised 
(ertugliflozin). Segluromet (ertugliflozin/metformin, EMEA/H/C/4314) is formulated as an immediate-
release tablet for twice daily oral administration in 4 dose strengths of ertugliflozin (2.5 mg or 7.5 mg) 
and metformin HCl (850 mg or 1000 mg for the EU market).  There are no novel excipients used in the 
manufacture of the Segluromet tablets. With the exception of the film coating, all excipients are 
compendial, and these excipients are tested and released in accordance with the specifications and 
methods described in the referenced pharmacopoeia. 
All pivotal safety pharmacological and toxicology studies were conducted in compliance with GLP. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacodynamics of ertugliflozin was studied in vitro to determine potency and selectivity for 
inhibiting SGLT2 versus SGLT1-mediated glucose transport.  In addition, the potency of ertugliflozin at 
physiological glucose concentration was also assessed and the mode of inhibition was determined.  In 
vivo studies were performed in rats treated with ertugliflozin and increased UGE levels was used as an 
indicator of inhibition of SGLT2-mediated glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule cells of the 
kidney. 
In vitro, ertugliflozin was shown to be a competitive inhibitor with a Ki held constant at approximately 
1 nM over the range of AMG concentrations tested (0.011 – 20 mM). The IC50 value for inhibiting 
human SGLT2 was 0.877  0.369 nM, while the IC50 for human SGLT1 was 1960  642 nM.  
Ertugliflozin remained potent at physiological glucose levels and was also shown to be potent against 
rat and dog SGLT2, with IC50 of 1.15 nM and 0.118 nM, respectively, with selectivity against rat and 
dog SGLT1. Both rat and dog were thus concluded to be relevant species to use in the toxicological 
studies. 
The in vitro potency of the two primary circulating glucuronide metabolites M5a (PF-06685948) and 
M5c (PF-06481944) on SGLT1 and SGLT2 was also determined. The IC50 of M5a and M5c at SGLT2 
were 476 nM >1000 nM, respectively (in the presence of 11.3 µM AMG) and both metabolites were

EMA/86928/2018

thus >500-1000 fold less potent than ertugliflozin at SGLT2. IC50 of both metabolites were >1000 nM 
at SGLT1. 
The focus of the nonclinical in vivo studies was on the effect of SGLT2 inhibition by ertugliflozin on the 
mechanism biomarker Urinary Glucose Excretion (UGE). The effect of ertugliflozin on plasma glucose 
levels was not evaluated non-clinically. In pair-fed rats, ertugliflozin at a dose (30 mg/kg/d) caused a 
significant increase in urinary glucose excretion and decreases in plasma glucose and body weight after 
8 days of dosing. A concomitant diuresis, as indicated by significant increases in urine volume, urinary 
volume to water intake and hematocrit was observed and was associated with an increase in urinary 
potassium and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system activation. In Sprague-Dawley rats fed ad-
libitum, there was a significant increase in urinary glucose and food intake in treated rats, which 
resulted in no reduction in BWt when compare to vehicle-treated animals. 
In Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR) a large increase in urinary glucose excretion (UGE) and a 
non-significant decrease in plasma glucose were seen in the pair-fed SHR treated with ertugliflozin 
concomitant with a 12% loss in body weight from baseline value of 3074 g and 22% reduction in body 
weight compared to control SHR.  Similar to the Sprague Dawley rats, ertugliflozin increased water 
intake, urine volume, percent of urine volume to water intake, and hematocrit, indicating a diuretic 
effect.  Concurrent with the diuresis, ertugliflozin lowered mean systolic blood pressure by 11%, mean 
arterial blood pressure by 13%, and heart rate by 15% when compared with vehicle control animals.  
Ertugliflozin also significantly increased plasma renin activity, serum aldosterone, and plasma and 
urinary angiotensinogen levels, indicative of a diuretic-induced activation of the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone-system. The renin-angiotensin-aldosteronesystem activation with ertugliflozin was seen to 
be consistent with that observed with the diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide, when this compound was 
administered to the same rats after a  30-day washout period. However, the relatively large loss of 
body weight in the pair-fed SHR was considered to complicate translation of the results obtained with 
ertugliflozin in this model to the clinic. 
The blood pressure lowering effects of ertugliflozin was also evaluated in SHR at doses that produce 
sub-maximal increases in UGE and compared to the effects of the loop diuretic furosemide given at a 
dose aimed to produce diuresis similar to that induced by the dose of ertugliflozin. Ertugliflozin-
treatment significantly increased 24–hour UGE and resulted in 5 % reduction in body weight in pair-fed 
rats compared to control rats (an effect that was not significant compared to baseline values), while 
furosemide did not have any significant effect on body weight. Both compounds lowered mean systolic 
blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and mean blood pressure to the same degree (8-10%) as 
compared to control rats. Although ertugliflozin increased the urine volume to water intake ratio, 
indicating a diuretic effect, plasma renin activity and urinary and plasma angiotensinogen were not 
significant altered. Unlike ertugliflozin, furosemide caused a significant increases in plasma renin 
activity and urinary and plasma angiotensinogen. These results thus indicate that diuresis is the 
predominant mechanism for blood pressure lowering with ertugliflozin in this model. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Selectivity against the four major facilitative glucose transporters (GLUT 1-4), was assessed to ensure 
that passive and insulin mediated glucose uptake is not inhibited in cells and tissues in the body by 
ertugliflozin. Greater than 60 μM of ertugliflozin was needed for 50% inhibition of GLUTs 1-4, 
compared to an SGLT2 IC50 of 0.877 nM, indicating that the selectivity for SGLT2 versus GLUT 1-4 is 
greater than 60,000 fold.

Ertugliflozin was profiled in vitro against a panel of receptors, ion channels and enzymes (n=56 + 8 
enzyme assays) (PD011) at a single concentration of 10 M (4.3 g/mL).  No significant inhibition 
(>50%) of binding or enzyme activity was observed at this concentration, which is 250x the unbound 
Cmax in humans of 0.0172 g/mL at a dose of 15 mg once daily.  
A low potential for secondary (off target) pharmacology at clinically relevant exposures is thus 
indicated by the studies performed. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
IC50 for hERG was 59 M (25.19 g/mL) which is approximately 1465x the human unbound Cmax,ss 
(0.0172 g/mL). No test article-related effects on any hemodynamic, electrocardiographic (ECG), 
myocardial contractility were seen in dogs up to 5 mg/kg (total plasma concentration at 7 hours 
postdose 1.94 g/mL, corresponding to an unbound plasma concentration of 0.062 g/mL, 
approximately 4x greater than the human unbound Cmax,ss  of 0.0172 g/mL at a dose of 15 mg once 
daily). At 50 mg/kg (approximately 42x the human unbound Cmax,ss), a decrease in corrected QT 
interval (QTc, 6 msec) and a decrease of 489 mmHg/sec in left ventricular contractility, with a 
concomitant increase in PR interval (4 msec) near Tmax (3.5 hours) was seen.  An increase in systolic 
blood pressure (6 mmHg), and decrease in heart rate (6 bpm) were also seen between 8 and 16 hours 
postdose. No effects on heart rate, mean arterial pressure, systolic and diastolic pressure were seen 
over a 24-hour after a 25 mg/kg (p.o.) dose of ertugliflozin in rats, giving a Cmax 7.3±0.7 µg/mL (292 
ng/mL unbound, and approximately 17 x the human unbound Cmax,ss). 
An acute oral dose of up to 500 mg/kg ertugliflozin did not seem to induce any biologically-relevant 
neurofunctional or pulmonary effects in male Sprague Dawley rats. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies with ertugliflozin have not been conducted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Nonclinical pharmacokinetic studies were performed in vivo in mouse, rat and dog and in vitro 
metabolism in rat, dog and human liver microsomes and hepatocytes. Validated liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods were used for the quantitation of 
ertugliflozin in mouse, rat, rabbit, and/or dog plasma, although non-validated methods were used for 
single-dose pharmacokinetic studies. Quantitative whole body autoradiography (QWBA), liquid 
scintillation counting and HPLC coupled to radiometric detection were used to measure [14C]-
ertugliflozin-derived radioactivity. 
Absorption 
Ertugliflozin was well absorbed and demonstrated low to moderate clearance (1.6 – 14 mL/min/kg) 
with a moderate volume of distribution (0.8 – 1.6 L/kg) in the nonclinical species evaluated. Mean 
apparent terminal half-life (t½) values for ertugliflozin ranged from approximately 2.7 to 7.6 hours in 
nonclinical species and oral bioavailability was moderate to high (56% to 97%). Absorption was rapid 
with a mean time to Cmax occurrence (Tmax) occurring at 0.5 hours postdose in mouse, 0.67 to 2.3 
hours postdose in rat and 0.83 to 1.5 hours postdose in dog. Systemic exposure to ertugliflozin 
increased approximately proportional to dose over a dose range of 6.5 or 19.4 mg/kg in mouse and 2 
to 500 mg/kg in rat. 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018

Distribution 
In vitro protein binding of ertugliflozin was determined in plasma from mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and 
human using equilibrium dialysis. Protein binding was high in all species and independent of drug 
concentration (no difference in binding between 1 and 10 µg/mL). The fu values were 0.045, 0.040, 
0.071, 0.032, and 0.064 in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and human plasma, respectively. Ertugliflozin 
distributed preferentially into plasma relative to red blood cells, with blood-to-plasma partition ratios of 
0.66, 0.58, and 0.66 in rat, dog, and human, respectively. 
[14C]-ertugliflozin-derived radioactivity achieved Cmax levels at 1 or 2 hours postdose in most tissues, 
blood, bile, and urine. Radioactivity in most tissues thereafter declined over time. Excluding bile and 
urine, the tissues with the highest Cmax concentrations of radioactivity were measured in the urinary 
bladder, liver, kidney medulla, and kidney. The radioactivity did not show affinity for pigmented tissues 
containing melanin and exposure in the non circumventricular CNS tissues was lower than blood 
concentrations (Tissue to blood ratio = 0.047 to 0.094 for Cmax and 0.064 to 0.12 for AUClast). 
Placental transfer of radioactivity was widespread with exposures to most fetal tissues, amniotic sac, 
amniotic fluid, myometrium, and placenta. Highest concentration of radioactivity was detected in the 
adrenal gland at all sampling times, with a mean Cmax level that was approximately 4-fold higher than 
fetal blood and fetal brain, blood, and eye consistently had the lowest concentrations of radioactivity. 
Retention of radioactivity was not observed in any maternal or fetal tissues. 
Metabolism 
The metabolism of ertugliflozin was evaluated in vivo after administration of a single oral dose of 
[14C]ertugliflozin to rats, dogs, and humans or unlabeled ertugliflozin to mice and in vitro in liver 
microsomes and hepatocytes from rats, dogs, and humans. The potential for in vivo chiral inversion of 
ertugliflozin was also assessed in pooled plasma samples and the obtained data suggest that 
ertugliflozin does not undergo chiral inversion in humans. 
Metabolite profiles were qualitatively similar in all species with no unique human metabolites observed.  
Overall, glucuronidation on the hydroxy groups of the modified glucose moiety was the major 
metabolic pathway of ertugliflozin in the species studied, with minor contributions from oxidative 
metabolism. Desethylation (oxidative) was a significant metabolic pathway only in rat. Isomeric O-
glucuronide metabolites of ertugliflozin (M5a, M5b, and M5c) and a glucuronide of M2 (M6a) were the 
primary circulating metabolites in humans, representing 12.2%, 4.1%, 24.1%, and 6.0% of total 
radioactivity in plasma. M5a and M5c were identified in rat, each representing 0.7% and 0.3%, 
respectively and M5c in dog plasma at 3.3%. M5c was also detected in mouse plasma but not 
quantified. 
Due to the low levels found in plasma of the toxicological species used, exposure of the major 
circulating human metabolites M5a- and M5c-glucuronides has probably not reached 50% of the 
exposure seen in humans. M5a and M5c are thus less likely to have been adequately characterized in 
the toxicology studies performed. However, the M5a and M5c O-glucuronide metabolites are not 
considered to be of any concern and no further safety testing of these direct conjugated O-
glucuronides are therefore needed. (See also Toxicology Assessment.) 
Excretion 
After oral administration of [14C]-ertugliflozin to rats, dogs, and humans, approximately 93.4%, 
94.8%, and 91.0% of the radioactive dose was quantitatively recovered in the excreta.  The 
predominant route of elimination of radioactivity in rats and dogs was feces and bile.  In humans, 
radioactivity in urine and feces accounted for 50.2% and 40.9% of the dose, respectively.

Ertugliflozin-derived radioactivity was shown to pass into milk with a milk-to-plasma AUC24 ratio of 
1.07 and milk:plasma concentration ratios ranging from 0.426 to 1.81 during 24 hours, after a single 
oral administration of 102 mg/kg to female rats 10 to 12 days after parturition. 
Overall the non-clinical PK of ertugliflozin has been sufficiently characterized and based on this 
characterization the use of mice, rats and dogs as toxicological species are considered to be 
acceptable. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of ertugliflozin was characterized in rats and dogs via single-dose intravenous 
(IV) injection (rat), single dose oral gavage administration (dog), and via repeat-dose oral gavage 
studies up to 3 months (mice), 6 months (rat) and 9 months (dog) duration. In addition, 13 weeks 
combination toxicity studies with ertugliflozin + sitagliptin, and ertugliflozin + metformin, were 
conducted in rats. The clinical route of administration is oral (immediate-release tablets).  Rats and 
dogs were selected as toxicology species, based on pharmacodynamics and metabolism. In addition, 
mice and rats were used for carcinogenicity studies, and rats and rabbits for reproductive toxicology.  
The extent of the toxicology programme is considered sufficient for the present application.  
Single dose toxicity 
After single IV injection, there were no adverse effects in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats up to 100 mg/kg 
bw, corresponding to exposure margins of 660-fold (Cmax) and 485-fold (AUC) to clinical exposure (15 
mg ertugliflozin once daily). In Beagle dogs administered a single oral dose, the only adverse effect 
was emesis at 500 mg/kg, corresponding to exposure margins of 94-fold (Cmax) and 253-fold (AUC) to 
clinical exposure. Based on this data, the acute toxicity of ertugliflozin appears to be low.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Most effects observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies were related to the primary pharmacological 
activity of ertugliflozin, i.e. reduced renal tubular reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate, 
and subsequent osmotic diuresis and systemic metabolic changes. The kidney, gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract and bone were identified as main target organs for toxicity.  
Mortalities 
Preterminal mortalities occurred in five CD1 mice administered 250 mg/kg/day (14 day non-GLP study) 
and in two CD1 mice dosed at 100 mg/kg/day (pivotal 3-month study). In the pivotal 1-month study, 
five SD rats administered 500 mg/kg/day (lowered to 250 mg/kg from Day 11) were found dead or 
euthanized moribund, after having shown clinical signs such as soft faeces, distended abdomen, 
hunched posture, decreased activity/ataxia and noisy respiration. In addition, two SD rats 
administered 25 mg/kg/day (one in combination with metformin 200 mg/kg/day) in longer term (> 3 
months) studies were found dead on Days 74 and 80, respectively. The cause of death/moribundity in 
mice and rats administered ertugliflozin could not be determined; however, all preterminal mortalities 
occurred at exposure margins > 100-fold the human therapeutic AUC and are thus not considered 
clinically relevant.  
Kidney 
In Tg (HRAS)2 mice treated with ertugliflozin at > 3 mg/kg/day for 1 month,  increased kidney weight, 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 24/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
correlated with minimal dilatation of cortical tubules, and minimal tubular basophilia in females, was 
observed. Similar findings were present in CD1 mice treated at > 5 mg/kg/day for 3 months.  
In SD rats, increased urine glucose and urine volume, usually associated with decreased urine 
creatinine and increased urine glucose/creatinine ratio, were observed in all studies from 7 days up to 
6 months duration, at doses > 5 mg/kg/day. Increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was also observed 
in all SD rat toxicity studies, at > 5 mg/kg/day. Ketones in urine were present in the 6-month study. 
Increased kidney weight, correlated with minimal to moderate cortical and medullary tubular dilatation, 
was observed in the pivotal 1- and 3-month repeat-dose toxicity studies at > 5 and > 25 mg/kg/day, 
respectively. Hypertrophy of the proximal convoluted tubules was seen after 14 days treatment (non-
GLP study), and in the pivotal 6-month study, at > 25 mg/kg/day. Increased incidence of tubular 
mineralization occurred in males at > 5 mg/kg/day in the 6-month study. 
Dilatation of the renal pelvis was observed in males at > 5 mg/kg/day in the 3- and 6-month studies, 
with the additional finding of pelvic inflammation at > 25 mg/kg/day (3-month study). This was often 
associated with inflammation in the prostate gland (see further below). Pelvic inflammation was 
present in occasional females at > 5 mg/kg/day in the 6-month study.  
At high doses (> 250 mg/kg/day) in the 1- and 3-month repeat-dose toxicity studies, ertugliflozin 
caused increased severity of chronic progressive nephropathy (CPN), a spontaneously occurring 
background renal disease in SD rats. Additional ertugliflozin-related changes at > 250 mg/kg/day 
included increased mineral deposition in the renal pelvis, and hyperplasia of the renal pelvic 
epithelium.  
Reversibility was evaluated in the 6-month study, using a 2-month recovery period. All findings were 
fully or partly reversible except for renal tubular mineralization in males at 100 mg/kg/day and pelvic 
inflammation in females at >25 mg/kg/day. One recovery female showed inflammation in the urinary 
bladder (with transitional cell hyperplasia) and ureter, as well as inflammation in the renal pelvis. 
In two 3-month combination studies in SD rats, with ertugliflozin + metformin or sitagliptin, 
respectively, glucosuria, increased urine volume and BUN, increased kidney weights and renal tubular 
dilatation, were observed at > 5 mg/kg/day, without any exacerbation caused by co-administration of 
metformin (200 or 600 mg/kg/day) or sitagliptin (20 or 60 mg/kg/day).  
In contrast to rats, Beagle dogs showed very few renal effects. Glucosuria, associated with increased 
urine volume and increased urine glucose/creatinine ratio, was observed at > 1 mg/kg/day, in all 
pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies from 1 to 6 months duration. Increased urine volume was not 
reversible after 9 months treatment, following a 2-month recovery period. Dogs did not show any 
increased kidney weights, or renal histopathological changes.  
GI tract 
In SD rats, loose stools or soft faeces were observed at high doses (> 250 mg/kg/day) in two repeat-
dose toxicity studies (7-day and 3-months, respectively). In the 3-month study, the whole GI tract was 
dilated with a thickened intestinal wall, correlating with microscopic findings of increased height and 
width of the mucosa/villi of the small intestine. These findings occurred mainly at 250 mg/kg/day, 
although microscopic changes in the intestinal mucosa were observed in males at > 5 mg/kg/day.  
Erosions/ulcerations in the glandular stomach, sometimes associated with inflammation, were 
observed in all repeat-dose toxicity studies > 3 months duration, at > 5 mg/kg/day. In the 6-month 
study, additional stomach findings in the form of minimal hyperplasia of foveolar cells (mucus-
producing) at 100 mg/kg, and minimal to slight crypt degeneration (pylorus) at > 25 mg/kg, were 
present. All of the stomach findings were reversible.  
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 25/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Beagle dogs showed soft or watery faeces at > 1 mg/kg/day, and emesis at > 10 mg/kg/day, in 
pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies. There were no correlating histopathological findings, and the 
effects were reversible following cessation of dosing.  
Liver and pancreas 
Non-adverse liver effects were observed in CD-1 mice (increased hepatocellular glycogen at > 5 
mg/kg/day in a 14-day study), SD rats (increased ALT and AST, sometimes associated with increased 
liver weight, at > 5 mg/kg/day in studies from 14 days to 6 months duration) and Beagle dogs 
(decreased glycogen content at > 1 mg/kg/day in the 3-month study). In the 13-week combination 
study with metformin, metformin alone (600 mg/kg/day) caused increased liver weight. Increased ALT 
and AST were partly reversible in the 6-month rat study. 
In the pancreas, depletion of zymogen granules, sometimes accompanied by increased cytoplasmic 
basophilia in exocrine cells, was observed in all SD rat studies, from 7 days to 6 months duration, at 
doses > 5 mg/kg/day. Zymogen granule depletion was most likely secondary to changes in food 
consumption. This effect was reversible and is considered non-adverse.  
Adrenal gland  
Increased adrenal weight without any correlating microscopic changes was observed in the CD-1 
mouse 14-day study, at > 5 mg/kg.  
SD rats showed increased adrenal weight, associated with hypertrophy and/or vacuolation of the zona 
glomerulosa, at > 5 mg/kg/day, in all repeat-dose toxicity studies from 1 to 6 months duration. 
Hypertrophy of the zona glomerulosa was fully reversible. 
In the 13-week combination study with metformin, general hypertrophy of the adrenal cortex showed 
increased incidence in females at 25/600 mg/kg, as compared with metformin 600 mg or ertugliflozin 
25 mg alone. It is possible that this may have been a stress-related effect.  
Bone 
In CD-1 mice, a decreased width of the physis or growth plate of the distal femur was noted at 250 
mg/kg/day in the 14-day study. This change was characterized by partial or complete loss of the 
hypertrophic zone within the physis. Similar microscopic changes were not observed in the 3-month 
study at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (NOAEL), corresponding to a 167-fold margin to human 
therapeutic exposure (AUC24 at 15 mg ertugliflozin).  
In SD rats, microscopic changes in the femur/tibia and sternum were observed in the form of minimal 
to moderate hyperostosis of the trabeculae at > 25 mg/kg/day (3-month study) or minimal to slight 
increase in trabecular bone at 100 mg/kg/day (6-month study; partially reversible after 8 weeks 
recovery). Increased serum phosphorus at 250 mg/kg/day (3-month study) and 100 mg/kg/day (6-
month study) was probably related to the bone effects. Furthermore, increased excretion of calcium 
and phosphorus in the urine was observed at > 5 mg/kg/day in the 6-month study. In other rat 
studies, decreased serum calcium and/or phosphorus were observed, without any corresponding 
changes in bone.  
In the 9-month dog study, increased calcium excretion in urine (non-reversible) was observed at 150 
mg/kg/day. No bone effects were seen. 
Other ertugliflozin-related effects 
Body weight and food consumption 
Effects on bodyweight/bodyweight gain and food consumption were observed in all species tested. 
Usually food consumption was increased, but bodyweight and/or bodyweight gain decreased. 
Sometimes food consumption was decreased, and bodyweight/bodyweight gain likewise decreased. 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 26/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These effects occurred in CD-1 mice at 250 mg/kg/day (14-day study), in Tg (HRAS)2 mice at > 3 
mg/kg/day (1-month study), in all studies in SD rats (from 7 days to 6 months) at > 5 mg/kg/day, 
and in all pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies in Beagle dogs at > 1 mg/kg/day.  
Hypoglycaemia and other serum chemistry findings 
Decreased serum glucose was observed in the majority of studies in SD rats, at > 5 mg/kg/day, and 
was reversible after 8 weeks recovery (9-month study). In the 13-week combination study with 
metformin, the effect on glucose was marginally more pronounced when ertugliflozin and metformin 
were given together as compared with ertugliflozin alone. Decreased serum glucose was also observed 
in the 7-day dog study (at > 50 mg/kg/day), and at > 1 mg/kg/day in the 3- and 9-month dog 
studies.  
In addition to changes in serum glucose, BUN, calcium and phosphorus (discussed above) a spectrum 
of other serum chemistry changes were observed in the majority of studies in SD rats, at > 5 
mg/kg/day. These changes included lower serum sodium, potassium, and chloride, consistent with 
electrolyte loss via osmotic diuresis, and decreased total protein, albumin, globulin and cholesterol, 
considered to be secondary to changes in energy balance (lipid and protein metabolism) resulting from 
glucose loss and/or osmotic diuresis. 
Hematology findings 
In CD-1 mice treated at 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days, increased red blood cell count (RBC), 
haemoglobin and haematocrit were observed in males. In contrast, SD rats showed decreased RBC, 
haemoglobin and haematocrit in repeat-dose toxicity studies > 1 month duration, at > 5 mg/kg/day. 
Additional findings in the form of increased or decreased red cell distribution width (RDW), decreased 
reticulocytes, increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) 
were noted in rats. Red blood changes in the 6-month study were not fully reversible after 8 weeks 
recovery, especially not RDW and reticulocyte changes in males.  
In the 7-day non-GLP study, and in all pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies > 1 month duration, at > 25 
mg/kg/day, decreased white blood cell count (WBC), lymphocyte and monocyte counts (sometimes 
also eosinophil and basophil counts) were observed. White blood cell changes were fully reversible.  
Mesenteric fat 
Lipid depletion/atrophy was observed in the 7-day SD rat study at 500 mg/kg/day, and in the 1-month 
pivotal study at > 5 mg/kg/day. This finding is considered to reflect catabolism of energy reserves 
secondary to glucosuria, i.e an adaptive, non-adverse effect.  
Mandibular salivary gland 
Hypertrophy of mucous cells occurred in SD rats at high doses (> 250 mg/kg/day) in the 1- and 3-
month studies, and in the 9-month dog study at 150 mg/kg/day. In dogs it was suggested to be 
related to excessive salivation. Since the exposure margins to NOAELs for this effect are at least 59-
fold compared to human therapeutic exposure (AUC24) at a 15 mg once daily dose, it is not considered 
clinically relevant.  
Prostate gland 
Decreased secretory material was observed in the SD rat 1-month study at > 250 mg/kg/day. In the 
3-month study, decreased prostate weight was present at > 5 mg/kg/day, being associated with mixed 
inflammatory cell infiltration and atrophic glands, and decreased secretory content, at > 25 
mg/kg/day. In the 13-week combination study with sitagliptin, mixed cell inflammation occurred in 
occasional animals at 5/20, 25/60 and 25/60 mg/kg/day. One animal at 5/20 mg/kg/day also showed 
renal pelvis and urinary bladder inflammation.

Stress-related findings 
Decreased thymus weights were observed at > 25 mg/kg/day in the SD rat 3-month study, most likely 
as a consequence of stress. Asynchrony of the estrus cycle at > 250 mg/kg/day, as well as lymphoid 
depletion in the thymus, spleen and GALT, and hypertrophy of the adrenal zona fasciculata in 
preterminally dead rats at 500/250 mg/kg/day, is also considered to be stress-related.  
Combination effects 
Ertugliflozin in combination with metformin at 25/600 mg/kg/day caused an exacerbation of organ 
weight increase in the kidney, liver, and adrenal gland of females as compared with organ weight 
changes seen with metformin or ertugliflozin dosed separately. In addition, higher heart weight without 
any microscopic correlation was observed in females dosed at 25/600 mg/kg/day (> 100-fold AUC24 
margin to clinical therapeutic exposure for ertugliflozin).   
Microscopically, a marginally higher severity of metformin-related salivary gland findings was observed 
in males given 25/600 and 5/600 mg/kg/day than was seen with metformin alone. Likewise, an 
increase in incidence of general adrenal cortical hypertrophy was noted in females given 25/600 
mg/kg/day as compared with metformin or ertugliflozin alone. No exacerbation of any effect of 
ertugliflozin or metformin given alone was noted when co-administered at 5 and 200 mg/kg/day.  
No exacerbations of any effects were observed when ertugliflozin (5 or 25 mg/kg/day)was co-
administered with sitagliptin (20 or 60 mg/kg/day).  
Equivocal findings 
A few other changes in organ weights, serum chemistry and hematology were sporadically observed in 
the repeat-dose toxicity studies with ertugliflozin. Since these changes were not consistently observed, 
and/or were not associated with any histopathological alterations, they are not considered 
toxicologically relevant.   
Conclusion on repeat-dose toxicity 
The majority of findings in the repeat-dose toxicity studies were related to the primary 
pharmacological activity of ertugliflozin; many findings being similar to those previously reported for 
other SGLT2 inhibitors (canagliflozin and dapagliflozin). These effects are to a large extent monitorable 
and highlighted in the RMP and SmPC. 
Genotoxicity 
Ertugliflozin was evaluated in a standard program of genetic toxicology assays, consisting of Ames 
test, in vitro cytogenetic test (human lymphocytes) and an in vivo rat micronucleus assay. The Ames 
test evaluation showed that ertugliflozin did not cause a positive increase in the mean number of 
revertants per plate with any tester strains either in the presence or absence of S9 mix. In the in vitro 
metaphase chromosome aberration test, there was no significant increase in chromosome damage at 
any concentration evaluated under any test condition. In addition, Ertugliflozin did not induce 
chromosome damage as evidenced by the absence of micronucleus formation in the polychromatic 
erythrocyte bone marrow cells at doses up to 500/250 mg/kg. Thus, collectively the genotoxicity 
testing with ertugliflozin does not indicate a genotoxic potential of the substance. 
Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenic potential of ertugliflozin was evaluated in two 2-year studies in CD-1 mice and 
Sprague Dawley rats.

Mouse 
Due to decreased survival observed in control and test article-treated dose groups, the mouse 
carcinogenicity study with ertugliflozin was terminated during week 97 for males and week 102 for 
females. This is not considered to have impacted substantially on the assessment of carcinogenic 
potential as the number of animals evaluated and study duration are still considered sufficient. 
In the study, three different control groups have been used. However, while control group 1 was 0.5% 
methylcellulose, control groups 2 and 3 were both 0.5% methylcellulose and 10% PEG 400. It was 
unclear why two independent control groups were dosed with the same treatment, and why a total of 
three control groups were used in the study. Since this is important from a 3R perspective (to avoid 
the unnecessary use of animals), the Applicant was asked to clarify this issue. In the response, the 
Applicant explained that the underlying reason for using two PEG 400 control groups was because of 
limited internal experience using 10% polyethylene glycol 400 in a study of this duration. In addition, 
the use of an additional 0.5% methylcellulose control group was a modification of an FDA 
recommendation to add a saline or water control group. This rational and explanation was considered 
acceptable. 
No test article-related neoplastic findings in male or female mice were found in the dose groups treated 
with ertugliflozin. The non-neoplastic changes presented which included histopathologic changes in the 
urinary tract and kidneys were anticipated based on findings in the repeated-dose toxicology studies 
and also the pharmacologically mediated increase in urine volume from SGLT2 inhibitors. While it is 
clear that the animals have been properly exposed, and that the exposure increased in a dose-related 
manner, it is unclear why the exposure has not been given as AUC. While this would not change the 
overall conclusion, it is considered a more useful and comprehensive way to describe the exposure. 
Based on extrapolation from a 3-month study, the NOEL for neoplastic findings (40mg/kg/day) 
corresponds to an AUC0-24 exposure of 87200 ngxh/ml, which is 74-fold above the human therapeutic 
exposure at a 15 mg dose. 
Rat 
Terminal necropsy of surviving male rats occurred after 104 weeks of dosing, whereas terminal 
necropsy of surviving female rats occurred after 92 weeks of dosing due to low survival in the female 
vehicle control group. Ertugliflozin exposure was associated with neoplastic and related hyperplastic 
findings observed in the adrenal medulla, and for benign pheochromocytoma in males administered ≥5 
mg/kg/day. Based on historical control data, the statistically higher significance of benign 
pheochromocytoma in males administered 5 mg/kg was by the Applicant considered an aberration and 
not biologically meaningful. This discussion is not agreed with. The findings of benign 
pheocromocytoma display a clear dose-response already from the 1,5 mg/kg dose. However, 
considering the totality and relatedness of the study findings, the NOEL for neoplasia is considered to 
be 1.5mg/kg/day. The overall (both sexes) exposure in terms of AUC0-24 at the neoplastic NOEL was 
7530 ngxh/mL, corresponding to a 6-fold margin to human therapeutic exposure at a 15 mg dose. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development (rat) 
Three animals died during the study, of which the causes of death for two animals in the 
250mg/kg/day group are unclear. It can be concluded that the animals have been properly exposed, 
but it is unclear why the exposure has not been expressed as AUC. Nevertheless, according to the 
repeated-dose toxicity study in rats (tt097892) mean Cmax and AUC0-24 values for ertugliflozin at 5, 25, 
and 250 mg/kg were 2.57, 8.11, and 51.2 μg/mL, respectively, for Cmax, and 19.9, 89.4, 738 μg•h/mL, 
respectively, for AUC0-24 on day 91. Thus, there is sufficient exposure margin in the study.

Overall, there were ertugliflozin-related decreases in body weights in males at all dose levels, whereas 
the female bodyweight changes were more transient. In addition, both sexes showed increased food 
consumption across all dose levels, likely compensatory to caloric loss. No effects were noted on 
reproductive parameters, with the exception of two males at 250mg/kg/day with small testis and 
epididymis and correlating effects on motile sperm and sperm counts. The Applicant suggests this was 
a pre-existing condition. While this seems unlikely, the absence of testicular effects in the repeat-dose 
toxicity studies, as well as the absence of similar findings in other animals in the study, makes a direct 
ertugliflozin-related effect less likely. 
The NOAEL for parental toxicity is considered to be 25mg/kg due to ertugliflozin associated deaths a 
250mg/kg. No effects of relevance were found on reproductive endpoints, why the reproductive and 
early embryonic development NOAEL was 250mg/kg. 
Embryofetal development 
Rat 
With once daily dosing of ertugliflozin, systemic exposure increased dose-dependently. Ertugliflozin 
induced decreased body weight and food consumption at 250mg/kg/day, why the maternal NOAEL is 
considered to be 100mg/kg/day. The highest dose of ertugliflozin also induced a variety of fetal effects, 
including an increased incidence of postimplantation loss, visceral malformations (membranous 
ventricular septum defect, right sided aortic arch) and skeletal malformations. In addition, one fetus 
had omphalocele and one fetus was malformed with ectrodactyly and short tail. Due to the low 
incidence and unclear etiology of these findings, the relationship to treatment with ertugliflozin is 
considered equivocal. Skeletal malformations (absent metacarpal, fused sternebra and hemicentric 
thoracic centrum) were accompanied by numerous skeletal variations in the250mg/kg/day group, and 
various skeletal variations were also found in the 100mg/kg/day group. These findings, while 
considered variations, were clearly ertugliflozin-related. The fetal NOAEL in the rat EFD study is 100 
mg/kg/day, corresponding to an exposure in terms of AUC0-24 of 457 μgxh/mL. The margin to human 
therapeutic exposure at a 15 mg dose is 384-fold. 
Rabbit 
Systemic exposure of ertugliflozin increased with increasing exposure in a dose-dependent manner. 
Two does in the highest exposure group aborted (on GD19 and GD21, respectively) and a third doe 
was euthanized on GD 28 following clinical signs and tray findings suggestive of abortion. This was 
likely a result of maternal toxicity rather than a direct effect on the developing fetus. There was an 
increase in post-implantation loss at 250mg/kg/day. However, this finding was within the historical 
control data of the laboratory.  
There were reductions in body weight (57-78% less weight gain than controls) seen at all doses, 
without a reduction in food intake only at the highest dose of 250mg/kg/day. No external 
malformations or variations were noted with the exception of a single control fetus (forelimb 
hyperflexion). One single high-dose embryo displayed muscular ventricular septum defect, dilated 
aortic arch narrowed pulmonary trunk. Since this was a single finding, the relationship to treatment 
with ertugliflozin cannot be determined. In addition, low incidences of minor skeletal malformations 
(including supernumerary cervical centrum, misshapen interparietal bone and fused rib) and variations 
were seen across the dose groups. While skeletal malformations are a concern, the findings seen were 
of low incidence (single fetuses) and occurred without obvious relation to treatment. 
Based on the reductions in maternal body weight and body weight gain relative to controls at all doses, 
a NOEL for maternal toxicity was not identified. There were no test article-related effects on fetal

viability, growth, or morphological development; therefore, the NOEL for developmental toxicity was 
250 mg/kg/day corresponding to an exposure in terms of AUC0-24 of 1150 μgxh/mL. The margin to 
human therapeutic exposure at a 15 mg dose is 966-fold. 
Prenatal/postnatal development 
No toxicokinetics was evaluated in this study. There was an increased incidence of decreased body 
weight, body weight gain, food consumption and clinical signs in the F0-females at doses 
≥100mg/kg/day. The clinical signs were ertugliflozin-related and included dehydration (based on skin 
turgor), rales and urine-stained abdominal fur. Each of these signs persisted into the lactation period.  
Pups to mothers exposed to 250mg/kg/day had lower survival, most likely due to decreased viability.  
In addition, pups exposed to ertugliflozin at doses ≥100mg/kg/day had lower pup weights. Sexual 
maturation (balano-preputial separation in males and later vaginal opening in females) was 
significantly delayed in both genders of the F1-generation exposed to 250mg/kg/day, which was also 
accompanied by decreases in body weight at the day of sexual maturation. Behaviour assessments did 
not show any effects, nor were there effects on fertility in the F1-generation.  
Juvenile toxicity 
Systemic exposure of ertugliflozin increased with increasing exposure in a dose-dependent manner on 
both PND 21 and PND 90. There were 5 unscheduled mortalities in the study, which the Applicant 
considers unrelated to ertugliflozin exposure. However, the cause of death for these rats was not 
determined. It cannot be excluded that the deaths at 250 mg/kg/day are treatment related. Since the 
margin to human therapeutic exposure is > 580-fold, the preterminal mortality at the high dose level 
is not of clinical concern. 
Overall, the main ertugliflozin-related findings consisted of lower mean body weights PND 21-90 at 
≥25mg/kg, with transient effects over the course of the study. There was an unclear correlation to 
food consumption, suggesting that the reduction in weight was correlated to ertugliflozin.  In addition, 
apparent clinical signs including dehydration, abdominal distention, and partly closed eyes with 
increased severity and incidence at higher doses. Body weight and weight gain remained lower at 
recovery in males at 250mg/kg whereas females recovered. 
There was an increase in the day of sexual maturation noted in both males (balano-preputial 
separation) and females (day of vaginal patency) at 250mg/kg. In addition, there were reductions in 
prostate weight at ≥5mg/kg, although no correlates were found microscopically. 
Ertugliflozin induced changes in clinical chemistry parameters as well as urinalysis and urine chemistry 
parameters. After recovery, there were some remaining findings in globulin, urea nitrogen and A/G 
ratio.  
Alterations in renal parameters (including increased organ weight, macroscopic pelvis dilatation, 
microscopic tubular and pelvis dilatation, and renal tubular mineralization,  at doses ≥5mg/kg) was 
seen at PND 90. At recovery there were remaining kidney findings (of lower magnitude and incidence). 
However, the renal tubular mineralization was not reversible. The renal findings were by the Applicant 
considered an adaptive response to the pharmacology of ertugliflozin and they correlated with 
glucosuria. However, considering the lack of reversibility, the renal tubular mineralization is considered 
adverse.  
Bone parameters were influenced by ertugliflozin exposure. On PND 91 there were statistically 
significant differences in bone formation markers in males at doses ≥ 25 mg/kg/day and also shorter 
femur lengths in both sexes at doses ≥25mg/kg. Increased femoral bone was noted at 250mg/kg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 31/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There were also changes in bone geometry at doses ≥25mg/kg. At recovery, there were remaining 
variations in bone mass and size. 
Thus, ertugliflozin administered to juvenile male and female SD rats resulted in effects of delayed 
puberty in both sexes, as well as irreversible effects on kidney and bone parameters. Based on the 
renal tubular mineralization, no NOAEL can be set for this study. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetics and exposure margins 
In SD rats, exposure (Cmax and AUC24) to ertugliflozin increased with dose, with no or minimal plasma 
drug accumulation up to 6 months of dosing. There was no apparent gender difference, although 
females tended to have higher exposure at some time points. Tmax was variable and occurred from 1 to 
7 hours post dose. Co-administration with metformin or sitagliptin did not affect ertugliflozin exposure 
with the exception of a 37% lower AUC24 when 25 mg/kg/day ertugliflozin was given together with 600 
mg/kg/day metformin. Since no similar effect was seen in the clinic, this finding is considered to be of 
low clinical relevance.  
In Beagle dogs, exposure (Cmax and AUC24) to ertugliflozin increased with dose, with minimal plasma 
drug accumulation up to 9 months of dosing. There were no apparent gender-related differences in 
exposure. Tmax occurred within 4 hours of oral administration.  
Plasma exposure (AUC24) achieved in the repeat-dose toxicity studies exceeded the human therapeutic 
exposure by up to 200-fold (mouse), 600-fold (rat) and 900-fold (dog). Exposure margins to NOAELs 
were generally in the range of 16- to 20-fold (rats) and 5- to 60-fold (dogs) as compared with the 
clinical therapeutic exposure (15 mg once daily dose). In two rat studies (13-week combination with 
sitagliptin; 6-month study) there were no NOAELs, mainly due to erosions/ulcerations in the glandular 
stomach at the low dose level (AUC24 exposure 18-fold above clinical therapeutic exposure).  
Local Tolerance  
Ertugliflozin was not a skin sensitizer in the mouse local lymph node assay, but induced corrosion in an 
in vitro human skin corrosion test, and induced eye damage in the bovine corneal opacity and 
permeability test. Furthermore, oral administration of ertugliflozin caused erosions/ulcerations in the 
glandular and non-glandular stomach of rats, inflammation and hyperplasia of the tongue (in the rat 
carcinogenicity study), and emesis in dogs. These findings indicate a local irritating potential of 
ertugliflozin.  
Other toxicity studies 
Metabolites 
No toxicology studies were conducted on two O-glucuronide metabolites that exceed the 10% 
threshold in humans. Since glucuronides in general have negligible potential for systemic toxicity or 
genotoxicity, and both metabolites are 500-1000-fold less potent on SGLT2 and > 1000-fold less 
potent on SGLT1 as compared with ertugliflozin, the absence of dedicated metabolite studies is 
considered acceptable. 
Impurities 
Two 3 –month repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats were conducted to qualify impurities and

degradants. Findings in these studies were similar to those from other rat studies using ertugliflozin 
without the spiked degradants. A number of process related impurities and potential degradation 
products were toxicologically qualified in these studies. Impurity PF-06759854 is described in Module 
3.2.S.4.5 as being a process related impurity present at 0.04% in the ertugliflozin batch used in study 
TT#13-7809 (13GR318). However, this could not be verified in the Certificate of analysis for this study 
(neither for study TT#15-7804). The Applicant was thus asked to clarify and to provide with the 
updated Certificate of analysis for study TT #15-7804 (15GR254), to confirm that impurity PF-
06759854 has been toxicologically qualified. In the response, the Applicant clarified that study TT#15-
7804 (15GR254) was a 3-month degradant qualification study in rats and that the batch used in this 
study did not contain PF-06759854. However, the impurity was included at 0.04 % in study13GR318, 
which has also been verified in the submitted certificate of analysis. Calculations in section 3.2.S.4.5 
(added above) supports that the rats used in the 13 week oral toxicity study were properly exposed to 
the impurity at a level that exceeds the human clinical exposure. It can thus be concluded that 
impurity PF-06759854 has been toxicologically qualified. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Ertugliflozin 
The environmental risk assessment (ERA) is based on ertugliflozin which has a molecular weight of 
436.88 g/mol and is hydrophilic with a water solubility of 0.64 mg/mL (pH 6.5) and a log KOW = 2.47 
(pH 7). The surface water predicted environmental concentration PEC (PECSW) was calculated to 
0.075µg/L using the default Fpen (0.01) and the maximum dose of 15mg. Based on the OECD 
TG314B, ertugliflozin seems also to have a high primary degradation in sludge. Ertugliflozin is also 
degraded in surface water to several transformation products, demonstrating a DT50 of 0.55d. Based 
on OECD TG308, aerobic degradation testing in combined fresh water-sediment systems gives DT50 
45.3d – 56.8d (12C) with the water-specific and sediment specific values falling below the persistence 
(P) criterion (DT50,water < 40d, DT50,sediment, < 120d). Together, the data indicates that ertugliflozin is 
not persistent in water-sediment systems. Ertugliflozin has a tendency to sediment accumulation 
(21.6-35.5% AR >10% after 14d). The organic content solid adsorption coefficients for ertugliflozin 
were below 10000L/kg for sediment, sludge and soil (Kdoc 198-967L/kg).

Figure 3: Overview of proposed transformation product/degradation pathway for 
ertugliflozin (PF-04971729, m/z 435.1216). Transformation product 5 (TP5, m/z 433.1060) 
was found in all environmental compartments (sludge, surface water and sediment 
systems).  
A range of transformation products were detected in surface waters, sediment and sludge samples. 
One of the products (“TP5”) present in all compartments was a more lipophilic aldehyde-compound 
(the result of dehydrogenation and a ring opening of the dioxolane ring). The applicant proposed the 
following structure for TP5: (2R,3S,4S)-6-(4-chloro-3-(4-ethoxybenzyl)phenyl)-3,4,5-trihydroxy-2-
(hydroxymethyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-carbaldehyde (see also Figure 3). The NOEC for aquatic 
toxicity was only found at the maximum doses tested, setting aquatic invertebrates (D. magna) with 
the most sensitive NOEC of 2.14mg/L. For sediment-dwelling chironomid larvae, the NOEC and LOEC 
(midge emergence) was 87mg/L and 249mg/L respectively. The ERA table is included below (Table

at 286mg/mL in water at pH 7.0-7.5 and 20C and has a log KOW = -2 (pH 7). The default Phase I

PECSW was calculated to 5.0µg/L using the default Fpen (0.01) and the maximum dose of 1000mg. 
Based on the OECD TG314B, metformin seems also to have a high primary degradation in sludge. The 
aerobic degradation in whole fresh water-sediment systems corresponds to a DT50,water 5.3d to 20.3d  
(20C) and a DT50,sediment around 14d with a moderate partitioning to the sediment within 17d (29-30% 
AR >10%). The half-lives at 12C were calculated per Focus (2014) to be 43.3d and 12.0d in the water 
phases and 38.8d for the sediment.  
Metformin had a sludge biodegradation DT50 and DT90 of 2h and 6.6h in an OECD TG314B test. The 
organic content solid adsorption coefficients (Kdoc) for metformin were Kdoc > 10 000L/kg for soil 
(~64-19645L/kg; geometric mean of 838L/kg) but not sludge (8L/kg). Fish (P. promelas) 
demonstrated the most sensitive aquatic toxicity NOEC (9.77mg/L with LOEC >9.77mg/L). For 
sediment-dweller organisms, male developmental rate in chironomid larvae (C. riparius) was found to 
be the most sensitive endpoint (NOEC 62.5mg/L with LOEC 125mg/L). The ERA table for metformin is

Ertugliflozin was shown to be a competitive inhibitor of SGLT2 with a Ki of ~1 nM. The IC50 value for 
inhibiting human SGLT2 was 0.877 + 0.369 nM, with high selectivity for human SGLT1. Potent and 
selective SGLT2 inhibition was also shown in rat and dog and these species are thus concluded to be 
relevant to use in toxicological studies. The two primary circulating glucuronide metabolites M5a and 
M5c were shown not to have any significant activity at SGLT2 or SGLT1. 
In vivo, ertugliflozin caused a significant increase in urinary glucose excretion and decreases in plasma 
glucose and body weight in pair fed rats after 8 days of dosing. A concomitant diuresis was observed 
and was associated with an increase in urinary potassium and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system 
activation. In animals fed ad libitum a significant increase in urinary glucose was also seen, 
concomitant with an increased food intake and no reduction in body weight. Ertugliflozinin was also 
given to Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats and the effects were compared to that of 
hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide. The results obtained indicate that diuresis is the primary 
mechanism for blood pressure lowering with ertugliflozin in this model. 
A low potential for secondary (off target) pharmacology at clinically relevant exposures is indicated by 
studies performed on GLUT 1-4 and a panel of receptors, ion channels and enzymes. No significant 
inhibition was seen in any of the assays performed. 
No significant effects were seen on hERG in vitro or cardiovascular effects in vivo after a single 25 
mg/kg (p.o.) dose of ertugliflozin to rats, giving a Cmax 7.3±0.7 μg/mL (292 ng/mL unbound, and 
approximately 17 x the human unbound Cmax,ss). No test article-related effects on any hemodynamic, 
electrocardiographic (ECG), myocardial contractility were either seen in dogs up to 5 mg/kg 
(approximately 4x greater than the human unbound Cmax,ss of 0.0172 μg/mL at a dose of 15 mg once 
daily). No biologically-relevant neurofunctional or pulmonary effects were seen in male Sprague

Dawley rats at doses up to 500 mg/kg ertugliflozin. No safety pharmacology issues were thus revealed 
at clinically relevant exposure levels in the non-clinical studies performed. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Ertugliflozin was well absorbed and demonstrated low to moderate clearance with a moderate volume 
of distribution. Mean apparent terminal half-life (t½) values ranged from approximately 2.7 to 7.6 
hours. Plasma protein binding was high (~95%) in all species investigated.  
[14C]-ertugliflozin-derived radioactivity achieved Cmax levels at 1 or 2 hours post dose in most tissues, 
blood, bile, and urine. Radioactivity in most tissues thereafter declined over time. The radioactivity did 
not show affinity for pigmented tissues and no retention was seen, suggesting that no accumulation is 
to be expected after repeat dosing. Placental transfer of radioactivity was widespread with exposures 
to most fetal tissues and excretion to milk was also seen. Metabolite profiles were qualitatively similar 
in all species with no unique human metabolites observed. Isomeric O-glucuronide metabolites of 
ertugliflozin were the primary circulating metabolites in humans with two metabolites (M5a and M5c) 
reaching levels >10% of total plasma exposure. The predominant route of elimination of radioactivity 
in rats and dogs was feces and bile, while in humans, radioactivity in urine and feces accounted for 
50.2% and 40.9% of the dose, respectively. 
In many studies both with ertugliflozin alone and in combination with metformin or sitagliptin, the 
exposure appeared to be lower in males than in females. However, there was no consistent trend 
across dose groups and studies.  
Due to the low levels found in plasma of the toxicological species used, exposure of the major 
circulating human metabolites M5a- and M5c-glucuronides has probably not reached 50% of the 
exposure seen in humans. M5a and M5c are thus less likely to have been adequately characterized in 
the toxicology studies performed. However, the M5a and M5c O-glucuronide metabolites are not 
considered to be of any concern and no further safety testing of these direct conjugated O-
glucuronides are therefore needed. 
The Applicant was asked to provide clarification regarding the chemical structures of M1, M3 and M8. 
In their response, the Applicant submitted a new study report (PK077MK8835) wherein the chemical 
structures of the most abundant oxidative metabolites of ertugliflozin formed in incubations with 
recombinant CYP3A4 and human liver microsomes were discussed. Two of the metabolites were 
hydroxyl derivatives of ertugliflozin with an OH-group between the two phenyl rings; one of the 
metabolites was the hydroxyl derivative of ertugliflozin with OH-group in ethoxyphenyl ring at ortho 
position to benzylic carbon. However, the definitive chemical structures of M1 and M3 could not be 
established. The structure of M8 was assigned as the glucuronide conjugate of M3. 
Overall the non-clinical PK of ertugliflozin has been sufficiently characterized and based on this 
characterization the use of mice, rats and dogs as toxicological species is considered to be acceptable. 
Toxicology 
The primary pharmacologic effect of ertugliflozin is to cause a reduced renal tubular reabsorption of 
glucose from the glomerular filtrate, leading to glucosuria. This effect was evident in both rats and 
dogs administered ertugliflozin in repeat-dose toxicity studies. As a consequence of glucosuria, an 
increased fluid load developed in the nephrons (osmotic diuresis), leading to tubular dilatation and 
increased urine volumes. Tubular dilatation as such is considered to be an adaptive effect and non-
adverse. Increases in BUN occurred in the absence of any increase in creatinine and probably reflected 
increased water loss associated with diuresis (prerenal azotemia).

Tubular mineralization, pelvic inflammation and exacerbation of CPN in SD rats are considered to be 
adverse effects. Tubular mineralization was suggested by the Applicant to be due to increased calcium 
and phosphorus excretion, linked to rat-specific inhibition of SGLT1. This seems plausible. Exacerbation 
of CPN occurred only at high dose levels, at an exposure > 500-fold the human therapeutic AUC, and 
is thus not of clinical concern. Pelvic inflammation, sometimes associated with inflammation in the 
prostate gland and (occasionally) in the urinary bladder/ureter may be a consequence of glucosuria, 
which increases the risk for bacterial ascending infections. Urinary tract infections have not been 
observed in the clinic (see Clinical Safety). Genital infections are included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
From a non-clinical perspective, no further action is needed. 
A number of GI findings occurred in rats, including a slightly trophic effect on the intestinal villi. The 
Applicant suggested that these effects were due to high local intestinal concentrations of ertugliflozin, 
causing inhibition of SGLT1, which in turn resulted in a reduced intestinal absorption of glucose. 
Fermentation of unabsorbed glucose in the large intestine was proposed to lead to gas formation, 
causing luminal dilatation and a slight trophic effect on the villi. Although no experimental data was 
produced to support this theory, the explanation seems plausible. 
The Applicant further speculated that inhibition of SGLT1 in the gut may have been at the root of the 
GI symptoms (watery faeces, emesis) in dogs. However, since the selectivity against SGLT1 in dogs is 
> 2000-fold this seems unlikely. A local irritating effect appears more plausible. No adverse GI effects 
have been reported in the clinic. Although not discussed by the Applicant, it seems likely that a higher 
selectivity against SGLT2 versus SGLT1 in humans as compared with rats and dogs may explain the 
absence of GI effects in patients treated with ertugliflozin. 
Liver effects in rats in the form of increased transaminases (ALT, AST) and increased liver weight, and 
in dogs in the form of decreased glycogen content, may have been related to increased hepatic 
gluconeogenesis to compensate for urinary glucose losses. The Assessor has reviewed AST, ALT and 
ALP on an individual level in all pivotal dog studies, concluding that there were no ertugliflozin-related 
effects on these parameters suggesting liver toxicity.  
Increased adrenal weight, associated with hypertrophy of the zona glomerulosa, was observed in rats. 
Cells of the zona glomerulosa produce aldosterone, which regulates the body’s concentration of sodium 
and potassium by acting on the distal convoluted renal tubules to increase sodium and water 
reabsorption, and increase potassium excretion. This finding is considered to be an adaptive, non-
adverse response to ertugliflozin-related osmotic diuresis. 
The bone effects in rodents would appear to be secondary to SGLT1 inhibition in the GI tract, leading 
to increased levels of intestinal glucose, which in turn promotes bacterial fermentation. As a 
consequence of this, a more acidic environment increases ionized calcium, and, subsequently, 
increased calcium absorption from the gut into the blood. Increased systemic calcium would result in 
decreased levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and decreased bone resorption, and would also serve 
as a substrate for increased calcium deposition. Similar bone effects in rats have been observed with 
canagliflozin and dapagliflozin and may be regarded as a class effect. 
The exposure margin to the lowest NOAEL for ertugliflozin-induced bone effects (5 mg/kg/day in the 3- 
month study) is 16-fold based on human therapeutic AUC24 at a 15 mg once daily dose. It should be 
taken into consideration that ertugliflozin is > 2000-fold selective for human SGLT2 versus SGLT1, 
while the selectivity in rat is only 300-fold. In view of this, the clinical relevance of the bone effects in 
rodents appears to be limited.

The effects on food consumption and bodyweight are considered to be due to a catabolic state 
associated with ertugliflozin-induced glucosuria and osmotic diuresis. Hypoglycaemia was probably 
secondary to ertugliflozin-induced glucosuria. From a non-clinical perspective, no further action is 
needed. 
The Applicant speculated that the changes in red blood cell parameters might be a consequence of 
negative energy balance, similar to what has been reported in feed-restricted rats. This seems 
plausible. The margins to human clinical exposure for these effects, as well as for the changes in white 
blood cell parameters, are relatively large; thus their clinical relevance is considered low. 
Inflammation in the prostate gland of rats was likely the consequence of an ascending urinary 
infection, secondary to glucosuria. ‘Genital infections’ are included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. From a 
nonclinical perspective, no further action is needed. 
The observed exacerbations of some organ weight and microscopic findings when ertugliflozin was 
administered together with metformin in rats are not considered adverse, due to the changes being of 
an adaptive nature and/or showing large exposure margins to clinical exposure. 
The Applicant suggests that the mechanism for tumour development in rats is carbohydrate 
malabsorption, which may lead to glucose shortage in the organism, which along with the energy 
dependent need to excrete high amounts of calcium, induces a high adrenergic tone in the animal. 
However, it is likely that the basis for the mechanism is the poor absorption of ertugliflozin in the rat, 
which leads to increased local concentrations in the gut capable of inhibiting SGLT1, which in turn 
impacts SGLT1- dependent glucose absorption.  
The data provided by the Applicant indicates that 81.4% and 76.3% of the orally administered 
ertugliflozin is absorbed in male and female rats respectively. It was thus unclear if this absorption rate 
for ertugliflozin still can give high enough local concentrations in the gut to significantly inhibit 
intestinal SGLT1. The Applicant was therefore asked to further clarify and discuss the relation between 
local ertugliflozin concentrations in the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study and intestinal SGLT1-inhibition. 
The Applicant has provided data that there would still be a high enough local gastrointestinal 
concentration of ertugliflozin to provide sufficient inhibition of SGLT1 in the gastrointestinal tract. This 
conclusion is agreed with. 
Relevance of developmental toxicology findings for recommendations in section 4.6 of the SmPC: The 
findings regarding ertugliflozin-induced effects on renal development and function are reflected in the 
SmPC section 4.6. Data suggests that ertugliflozin may affect renal development and maturation; 
therefore, ertugliflozin should not be used during pregnancy.  
While it is unknown whether ertugliflozin is excreted in human breast milk, available data in rats show 
excretion in milk, as well as pharmacologically-mediated effects in nursing offspring in the 
prenatal/postnatal development study. Since a risk to breast-feeding infants cannot be excluded, 
ertugliflozin should not be used while breast-feeding (see SmPC). 
The Applicant was asked to discuss the local irritating potential of ertugliflozin. The in vitro human skin 
corrosion test and the bovine corneal opacity and permeability test were conducted with high 
concentrations more relevant for a worker safety situation. In rats, erosions/ulcerations were observed 
in the glandular and non-glandular stomach; however, the histopathological grading was from minimal 
to slight and no similar findings were present in dogs. Hyperplasia of the tongue, which was observed

in the rat carcinogenicity study, could possibly be related to increased food and water intake for an 
extended time period. Since the frequency of gastrointestinal disorders does not appear to be 
significantly higher in patients treated with ertugliflozin as compared with placebo it is not considered 
necessary to include gastrointestinal irritation in the product information. 
ERA: Regarding the environmental impact of ertugliflozin, it seems to be non-persistent in water-
sediment systems and biodegradable in sludge but with a low sludge adsorption potential - indicating 
that there is little risk for terrestrial effects from agricultural sludge usage. The main entry into the 
environment is into surface waters via the effluent. In a similar manner, metformin demonstrated high 
primary degradation in sludge and a low sludge adsorption potential. Based on the overall data, neither 
ertugliflozin nor metformin are classified as a PBT or vPvB candidates. Both active substances shift 
partly from surface water to the sediment at >10% after 14d (metformin more than ertugliflozin). 
Metformin can be considered persistent in water according to PBT criteria (DT50 = 43.3d > 40d). 
The ERAs for both ertugliflozin and metformin have been updated. The applicant has updated the 
predicted environmental concentration (PEC) calculation for ertugliflozin by using a more appropriate 
prevalence Fpen (type II diabetes prevalence 8.3%), giving an surface water PEC (PECSW) of 0.62ug/L, 
a groundwater PEC (PECGW) of 0.16ug/L, and wet and dry sediment PECs of 0.013mg/kg (PECW,SED) 
and 0.060mg/kg (PECD,SED). All dependent risk quotient (RQ) values were well below 1, supporting the 
applicant argument that ertugliflozin is unlikely to be an environmental risk. The PEC values for 
metformin were also recalculated, based on existing consumption data (using the sales of metformin in 
Luxembourg) – giving an Fpen of 0.014. This resulted in a PECSW of 7ug/L, a PECGW of 1.75ug/L and 
sediment PEC (PECSED) of 440ug/kg. All dependent risk quotient (RQ) values were well below 1, 
supporting the applicant argument that metformin is unlikely to be an environmental risk. 
In response to previous other concerns, some minor metformin ERA issues have been addressed 
(regarding temperature adjustment for water/sediment DT50 and issues around soil Kdoc 
determination). Overall, the available data plus the responses from the applicant indicate that 
ertugliflozin is unlikely to pose environmental risks to aquatic/sediment compartments and that 
metformin exposure by this product is unlikely to pose an additional environmental risk to the 
aquatic/sediment compartment to that already present in the environment resulting from other 
products containing the active substance.

The majority of the clinical pharmacology support for the FDC ertugliflozin/metformin (Segluromet) 
comes from the clinical pharmacology program for ertugliflozin as mono-component Steglarto. Three 
additional clinical studies have been performed to support the FDC ertugliflozin/metformin (Table 5).

glimepiride were developed and validated. 
Ertugliflozin  
Absorption  
Ertugliflozin is characterized as a BCS I compound. In vitro ertugliflozin was a Pgp and BCRP substrate. 
The Fa (fraction absorbed) of ertugliflozin following an oral dose was calculated to 111% and the 
absolute bioavailability (F) to 105%, by the use of the microdose approach. 
A relative fast absorption of ertugliflozin, tmax 1h, is seen following oral administration. 
Dose proportional increase in systemic exposure has been shown following single doses of 0.5-300 mg 
and repeated dosing of 1-100 mg od. 
Steady state was reached at day five following repeated od administration. The steady state exposure 
increased ca 30% compared to after the first dose, with a RAC varying between 1.2-1.4. 
The total exposure of ertugliflozin after a total daily dose of 5 mg is comparable independently if 
administered a single dose qd or divided in two doses bid. The same applies for a total daily dose of 15 
mg ie the total exposure is comparable following 7.5 mg bid and 15 mg qd. 
Steglatro is a cocrystal consisting of 1:1 ertugliflozin and L-pyroglutamic acid (L-PGA), in the absence 
of L-PGA, the active moiety is an amorphous solid. The relative F of ertugliflozin of tablets containing 
the amorphous form relative to the cocrystal form was 99% with 90%CI for both Cmax and AUC within 
80-125%. Thus any dissociation of the cocrystal to the amorphous form will not have any impact on 
the oral availability of ertugliflozin. 
The commercial 15-mg tablet is BE to the phase-3 15-mg dose, administered as one 10-mg and one 
5-mg tablet, with 90%CI for the ratios, commercial/phase 3, of AUC, AUClast and Cmax within the BE 
criteria of 80-125. 
A decrease in exposure, Cmax and AUC, of ca 30 and 10%, respectively, was seen following 
administration of 15 mg ertugliflozin together with food. The decrease in exposure is not considered 
clinically relevant and ertugliflozin may be dosed without any food restrictions. 
Distribution 
The Vss (volume of distribution at steady state) estimated to 85 L. The fu (unbound fraction) of 
ertugliflozin is determined to be 6.4%. 
No clinically meaningful difference was seen in ex vivo protein binding of ertugliflozin between healthy 
subjects and T2DM patients with normal renal function and with varying degree of RI and in subjects 
with moderate HI However, fu was slightly lower than determined in vitro 3.5%. 
The blood/plasma ratio was 0.66. 
Elimination 
The terminal t1/2 was calculated to about 14h and CL was estimated to ca 190 ml/min. 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018

Following 25 mg 14C-ertugliflozin orally 41 and 50% of the radioactivity was excreted in the faeces 
and urine, respectively. Ca 1.5% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine. Thirty-four percent 
of the dose was excreted unchanged in faeces, and as the absolute F is 100%, it can be concluded that 
biliary excretion is responsible for ca 35% of the elimination of ertugliflozin. 
A total of eight metabolites were detected, seven in the urine and three in faeces. The major metabolic 
pathway was direct glucuronidation (M5a, M5b, M5c) but also glucuronidation of M2 (M6a, M6b). 
CYP3A4 was predominantly responsible in the formation of M1, M2, and M3. Minor contributions by 
CYP2C8, 3A5 and 2D6 were also seen. 
UGT1A9 and 2B7 were involved in the glucuronidation of ertugliflozin to form M5a and M5c. M5a was 
mainly formed by UGT2B7 and the major enzyme contributing to the formation of M5c was UGT1A9.  
No clinically relevant differences in ertugliflozin exposure were seen between different UGT1A9 
genotypes in healthy volunteers. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
No signals of time-dependent PK of ertugliflozin have been identified in vitro or following repeated 
dosing of ertugliflozin. 
Pharmacokinetic data from 15 clinical studies (nine Phase 1, two Phase 2, and four Phase 3 studies) 
were included in the popPK analysis. The final model was a 2-compartment model with lag time, first-
order absorption, and first-order elimination. Baseline body weight was included using an allometric 
relationship, with the exponent fixed to 0.75 and 1.0 for apparent clearances and volumes, 
respectively. Covariates included in the model were eGFR, gender, race and patient status on CL/F, 
and age, gender and race on Vc/F. Based on the final model, the mean elimination half-life was 15.3 hr 
for healthy subjects and 16.6 hr for T2DM patients with normal renal function  
(eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2).  
Special populations 
An increase in AUC of ca 60% was seen in all subjects with RI independently if diagnosed with mild, 
moderate or severe decreased renal function. The fu of ertugliflozin determined ex vivo increased 
slightly from 3.4% in healthy subjects to 4.1% in T2DM patients with severe RI. AUC of M5c and M5a 
increased 2- to 3-fold in subjects with decreased renal function. 
The systemic exposure, AUC and Cmax, of ertugliflozin was slightly lower by 13 and 21%, respectively, 
in subjects with moderate HI than in healthy subjects. The total exposure of M5c was ca 50% higher 
and M5a was ca 25-30% lower in HI compared to in healthy subjects. The t1/2 of M5c and M5a was 
unchanged in HI compared to healthy subjects. 
Age, weight, sex and gender effects on exposure are not anticipated to be clinically relevant. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The PK interaction potential of ertugliflozin has been evaluated in a number of in vitro studies and in 
five in vivo studies. The enzymes and transporters with potential clinical relevance are summarized

Metformin 
Absorption  
Metformin absorption is saturable and incomplete after oral administration. The absolute bioavailability 
is approximately 50-60% in healthy subjects.  
A decrease in Cmax of ca 25% was reported following a dose of 850 mg taken together with food, which 
is deemed not clinical relevant and dose recommendation is taken without or with simultaneous food 
intake. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding of metformin is negligible. The mean volume of distribution (Vd) of metformin 
ranged between 63-276L.

Elimination 
Plasma protein binding of metformin is negligible. The mean volume of distribution (Vd) of metformin 
ranged between 63-276L. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
It is assumed that the PK of metformin absorption is non-linear. 
Special populations 
Renal CL decreased in proportion to that of creatinine in subjects diagnosed with renal impairment. The 
elimination t1/2 was prolonged in RI, leading to increased levels of metformin in plasma. Metformin is 
contraindicated in patients with renal failure or renal dysfunction (CLcr <60 ml/min). 
Metformin is contraindicated in patients with hepatic insufficiency due to the increased risk of lactic 
acidosis. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No PK DDIs are listed in the metformin SmPC. 
FDC ertugliflozin/metformin 
Bioequivalence (BE) of the FDC ertugliflozin 7.5 mg/metformin 850 mg compared to co-administration 
of ertugliflozin 7.5 mg and metformin 850 mg was shown for both compounds, with the 90% CI of the 
ratio test/reference within the criteria for BE [80, 125%] for both AUCinf and Cmax. 
BE of the FDC ertugliflozin 7.5 mg/metformin 1000 mg compared to co-administration of ertugliflozin 
7.5 mg and metformin 1000 mg was shown for both compounds, with the 90% CI of the ratio 
test/reference within the criteria for BE [80, 125%] for both AUCinf and Cmax. 
A delayed Cmax for both ertugliflozin and metformin resulting in a decrease with ca 40 and 30%, 
respectively, was seen when the FDC ertugliflozin 7.5 mg/metformin 1000 mg was administered with 
food. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Ertugliflozin 
Ertugliflozin is an oral, highly selective SGLT2 inhibitor with greater than 2000-fold higher selectivity 
for SGLT2 compared to sodium-glucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT1).  
Under conditions of normoglycaemia, glucose is filtered in the glomerulus, with essentially all the 
filtered glucose being reabsorbed into the circulation in the early and late portion of the proximal 
tubule via the action of SGLT2 and SGLT1, respectively.  Under conditions of hyperglycaemia, when the 
transporters reach their maximum reabsorptive capacity (referred to as the transport maximum for 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 50/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
glucose) glycosuria ensues.  Ertugliflozin inhibits renal glucose reabsorption, resulting in a lowering of 
the renal threshold for glucose and increased UGE, thereby reducing plasma glucose and A1C in 
subjects with T2DM.  Ertugliflozin improves glycaemic control via a mechanism independent of insulin 
and pancreatic β-cell function and its durability is not dependent on β-cell function. Because the extent 
of UGE is dependent on ambient glucose levels, as glucose levels decrease to normal, UGE also 
decreases, making hypoglycaemia unlikely.  
Metformin 
Metformin hydrochloride is an AHA that improves glucose tolerance in patients with T2DM by lowering 
both basal and post-prandial plasma glucose (PPG).  It is not chemically or pharmacologically related 
to any other class of oral AHA.  Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal 
absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and 
utilization. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
UGE in Healthy Subjects 
In the single and multiple escalating dose studies of ertugliflozin in healthy subjects (Studies 
P036/1001 and P037/1002), 24-hour UGE increased in a dose-related manner and median 24-hour 
UGE values appeared to plateau at doses ≥25 mg. The 24-hour UGE values were generally similar on 
Day 1 and at steady state for the respective ertugliflozin dose groups. The median 24-hour UGE values 
at steady state after administration of 25 mg qd in healthy Japanese subjects (69.9 g) were similar to 
those observed in healthy subjects in other Phase 1 studies, supporting no meaningful ethnic 
difference in UGE between Japanese and Western healthy subjects. 
In Study P035/1051, the 24-hour UGE values were 58.58 g, 57.63 g, 57.09 g, and 52.46 g for the 7.5 
mg bid, 15 mg qd, 2.5 mg bid, and 5 mg qd doses, respectively, indicating no meaningful differences 
for the bid vs corresponding qd doses. 
UGE in T2DM Subjects 
In Study P040/1007, the 24-hour UGE values in T2DM subjects administered 1 mg bid, 2 mg qd, 2 mg 
bid, and 4 mg qd ertugliflozin doses were 69.45 g, 70.43 g, 78.29 g, and 80.54 g, respectively, 
indicating no meaningful differences in UGE for the bid vs corresponding qd doses. 
Ertugliflozin, at a dose of 15 mg, induced higher median change from baseline 24-hour UGE in T2DM 
subjects with normal renal function (68.1 g) compared to healthy subjects (45.8 g) as expected with 
higher circulating glucose levels in T2DM subjects (Study P009/1023). Consistent with the mechanism 
of action of SGLT2 inhibitors, 24-hour UGE was dependent on renal function, with UGE decreasing with 
increase in degree of renal impairment despite increased ertugliflozin exposures in subjects with renal 
impairment. Compared to the median value of UGE in T2DM subjects with normal renal function, the 
UGE was approximately 53% to 69% of normal in subjects with mild renal impairment, and 42% to 
48% of normal in subjects with moderate renal impairment.

Table 9: Summary Statistics for Change from Baseline in 24-hour UGE (g) by Renal Function 
A regression model-predicted mean 24-hour UGE with ertugliflozin for a T2DM subject with a BSA-
unnormalized eGFR of 52.5 mL/min was 25.3 g, and for a T2DM subject with a BSA-normalized eGFR 
of 52.5 mL/min/1.73m2 was 29.5 g. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Study P010/1025 was a single-dose, randomized, 3-treatment, 6-sequence, 3-period crossover, 
placebo- and active-controlled study in 42 healthy subjects to demonstrate a lack of effect of a 
supratherapeutic dose of ertugliflozin on the QTc interval. The ertugliflozin dose administered was 
100 mg. The observed LS mean difference in QTcF between ertugliflozin and placebo ranged from 0.09 
milliseconds to 2.99 ms. At the median time of peak ertugliflozin concentrations (1.5 hours post dose), 
the LS mean difference was 1.47 milliseconds. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The relationship between 24-hour UGE and ertugliflozin dose in T2DM subjects was characterized using 
data from the phase 2 dose-ranging Study P042/1004. In this study, the 24-hour UGE was assessed in 
an outpatient setting at baseline (Day 0) and after 28-day dosing with ertugliflozin 1 mg, 5 mg, or 25 
mg, placebo, or hydrochlorothiazide in subjects with T2DM with inadequate glycaemic and blood 
pressure control. An Emax model was fitted to the observed 24-hour UGE data as a function of 
administered dose. The model estimated a maximal baseline-adjusted 24-hour UGE response of 71.5 
(95% CI: 57.9, 87.3) g and an ED50 of 0.752 (95% CI: 0.299, 1.58) mg. The predicted mean 24-hour 
UGE following administration of ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg doses for 28 days were 62.5 (90% CI: 
54.9, 69.7) and 68.9 (90% CI:58.9, 78.7) g. The dose-response modelling indicated that ertugliflozin 
5 mg and 15 mg result in near maximal UGE, with the 15 mg dose providing incrementally greater 
UGE relative to the 5 mg dose.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
This application concerns a combination of the NCE ertugliflozin, with the MAA procedure for Steglatro 
ongoing in parallel, and the well-known substance metformin. The Applicant has provided a solid 
clinical pharmacology program for ertugliflozin and very well presented.  
The MAA for Segluromet contains the complete ertugliflozin clinical pharmacology program submitted 
for Steglatro and three additional phase 1 studies in support of the FDC tablets. This assessment 
report focuses on the assessment of Steglatro and the additional studies submitted. The presented 
PK on metformin are based on the Glucophage SmPC. 
The absolute F of ertugliflozin is 100% following oral administration of clinical relevant doses and a 
dose-proportional increase in systemic exposure has been seen after repeated dosing up to 100 mg od.  
Bioequivalence of the FDC ertugliflozin 7.5 mg/metformin 850 mg compared to co-administration of 
ertugliflozin 7.5 mg and metformin 850 mg was shown for both compounds. BE was also shown for the 
FDC with ertugliflozin 7.5 mg/metformin 1000 mg compared to co-administration of the single 
components.  
Decreased Cmax for both ertugliflozin and metformin (ca 40 and 30%, respectively) were seen when the 
FDC ertugliflozin 7.5 mg/metformin 1000 mg was administered with food. These decreases are 
consistent with the decreases seen following administrations of the single components. No clinical 
relevant change in total exposure was seen compared when administered in fasted condition, thus 
there is no restrictions for concomitant food intake with Segluromet. 
Ertugliflozin is mainly eliminated via metabolism with <2% excreted unchanged in the urine. Ca 12% is 
excreted as oxidative metabolites (in urine+faeces), ca 46% as glucuronides (main drug related 
component in the urine) and 34% as parent compound (in faeces). UGT mediated, UGT1A9 and 
UGT2B7, metabolism is responsible for >85% of elimination. No in vivo data confirming the proposed 
elimination pathways are available. However, clinical consequences of potential increase in systemic 
exposure of ertugliflozin, following inhibition of the main elimination pathway ie UGT inhibition, are not 
expected. The PBPK platform was not deemed qualified to predict UGT inhibition. 
Both UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 are expressed in the liver and the kidney. In vitro measurements of the 
formation of M5a and M5c were performed using human liver and human kidney microsomes to 
understand the role of the liver and the kidney. Taking into account tissue specific microsomal protein 
expressions, the fm,UGT in the liver and the kidney was calculated to 0.89 and of 0.11, respectively. 
About 50% increase in exposure was seen in subjects diagnosed with RI independently of degree of 
renal function. The fu of ertugliflozin determined ex vivo increased slightly from 3.4% in healthy 
subjects compared to 4.1% in T2DM patients with severe renal function. The exposure of the main 
metabolites, the direct glucuronidated metabolites, was increased 2- to 3-fold. The increases in 
exposure in RI patients are not considered clinically relevant. 
The exposure of ertugliflozin was slightly lowered, AUC and Cmax, 13 and 21%, respectively, in subjects 
with moderate HI compared to healthy subjects. This is not considered clinically relevant. 
It is not clear how age influences the use of Segluromet, a FDC of ertugliflozin/metformin, in elderly 
patients. The SmPC has been updated with information that there is limited experience in subjects >75 
years. 
No clinically relevant difference in systemic exposure of ertugliflozin was seen when co-administered 
metformin, sitagliptin, glimepiride and simvastatin when co-administered compared to when 
administered alone.  
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 53/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on an extensive in vitro evaluation, it can be concluded that ertugliflozin is not characterized as 
an OATP substrate. 
The total exposure of ertugliflozin decreased ca 40% when co-administered with rifampicin. Rifampicin 
is a known inducer but also a known OATP inhibitor. However, it can be concluded that the seen 
decrease in exposure when co-administered is a consequence of induction as ertugliflozin is not an 
OATP substrate. 
No difference in exposure of metformin, sitagliptin or glimepiride was seen when co-administered with 
ertugliflozin compared when dosed alone. 
Ertugliflozin is claimed not to inhibit UGTs in vitro at clinical relevant concentration. There are 
specificity limitations in the study design considering used substrates and inhibitors but it can be 
concluded that ertugliflozin is not an inhibitor of UGT1A6 and 2B7. The conclusion on no inhibition of 
UGT1A1, 1A4 and 1A9 are more ambiguous, but as no signals were observed in any of the assays the 
issue will not be further pursued. 
An increase in exposure of simvastatin/simvastatin acid was seen when co-administered with 
ertugliflozin but not considered clinically relevant. Simvastatin is characterized as CYP3A4, OATP1B1 
and BCRP substrate. The mechanism behind the increase in plasma levels is unknown as ertugliflozin is 
not an inhibitor of OATP, BCRP or CYP3A4. 
Ertugliflozin is an oral, highly selective SGLT2 inhibitor with greater than 2000-fold higher selectivity 
for SGLT2 compared to sodium-glucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT1). The primary mechanism of action is 
well known by now, as ertugliflozin is the fourth SGLT2-inhibitor to reach this stage of development in 
the EU. The mechanism of action for metformin is well known. 
Both single and multiple escalating dose studies in healthy volunteers showed an increase in UGE by 
dose. No additional increase was observed at doses higher than 25 mg ertugliflozin in any of the 
studies.  
In Phase 3 studies, ertugliflozin was administered qd. The ertugliflozin/metformin FDC contains an 
immediate-release formulation of metformin. Given that metformin immediate-release is 
recommended to be administered bid, ertugliflozin/metformin FDC will also be dosed bid. In order to 
bridge the qd dosing regimen of ertugliflozin administered in the phase 3 studies with the bid dosing 
regimen in the ertugliflozin/metformin FDC, the effect of qd and bid dosing was investigated in healthy 
volunteers. No meaningful difference in the UGE was observed between the two different dosing 
regimens. The effect of qd and bid dosing was also investigated in subjects with T2DM. No meaningful 
difference in the UGE was observed between the two different dosing regimens. Notably, in both 
studies the difference between the two dose levels (5 vs 15 mg daily and 2 vs 4 mg daily, respectively) 
was small. 
Study P009/1023 was an open-label, single oral dose study which included T2DM patients with either 
normal renal function or mild, moderate or severe renal impairment. In addition healthy volunteers 
were included. The HbA1c was higher in the T2DM group with normal renal function than in the groups 
with renal impairment (7.9% vs 7.1%). This may have affected the result to some extent, but 
considering that the effect of ertugliflozin on UGE in patients with T2DM and mild renal impairment was 
comparable to that observed in healthy volunteers, the data provide evidence that the effect of 
ertugliflozin declines with declining renal function.  
No firm connection has been established between the plasma levels and the pharmacodynamic effects.  
This is understandable because the drug acts extracellularly and pharmacological and therapeutic 
effects depend on the drug concentration in the tubular lumen. Therefore studying the relationship 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 54/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
between the excreted ertugliflozin amount (Ae24) and UGE allows drawing conclusions about the 
PK/PD. The relationship between eGFR and the excreted amount is close to linear. 
The definitive QTc study showed no effect of ertugliflozin on QTc.  
The Applicant has not provided any data on pharmacodynamic interactions. The SmPC includes 
information on interactions with diuretics which may increase the risk of dehydration and hypotension 
and on interactions with insulin and insulin secretagogues which may increase the risk of 
hypoglycaemia. This is relevant and sufficient. 
Studies performed in Japanese subjects showed no apparent differences in the effect of ertugliflozin 
compared to the outcome in studies performed in Western healthy subjects. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall the clinical pharmacology properties of the FDC ertugliflozin/metformin have been 
appropriately described and are reflected in the SmPC. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Seven Phase 3 studies support the initial regulatory submission for ertugliflozin alone.  Four of the 
seven Phase 3 studies also support the ertugliflozin/metformin FDC submission, including 2 active-
controlled studies (Studies P005/1019 and Study P002/1013) and 2 placebo-controlled studies 
(Studies P006/1015 and P007/1017) that evaluated the safety and efficacy of ertugliflozin in 
combination with metformin in adult subjects with T2DM (Table 3). Efficacy data were pooled for the 
2 placebo-controlled studies to assess efficacy on a background of metformin. 
The following three studies from the ertugliflozin program are considered supportive; P003/1022 
(Monotherapy) and P017/1047 (Ertugliflozin plus sitagliptin initial combination). Study P001/1016 was 
a special populations study in moderate renal impairment. 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Ertugliflozin 
The dose response studies discussed in the following were conducted to support the doses for 
ertugliflozin as monocomponent. 
Ertugliflozin doses of 5 mg and 15 mg qd were evaluated in all phase 3 studies (dosed in the morning 
without regard to food).  The primary driver for dose selection was the dose-response modelling for 
the change from baseline in A1C, FPG, body weight, and the mechanistic biomarker 24 hour UGE in 
subjects with T2DM (based on Phase 2 Studies P016/1006 and P042/1004).  For these endpoints, the 
5 mg and 15 mg doses consistently elicited a response that was >80% and >90% of the maximum 
response, respectively. 
Study P016/1006 was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled, 6-
treatment group, parallel-group, 2-period study in subjects with T2DM. In total, 328 subjects were 
randomly assigned to study medication (ertugliflozin 1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 25 mg, sitagliptin 100 mg 
or placebo).  Demographic characteristics (gender, age, weight, and race) were similar across 
treatment groups.  Treatment groups were well balanced in baseline disease characteristics.

Figure 4 presents the result of the primary efficacy endpoint: change from baseline in A1C at Week 
12.  At Week 12, there was a significant reduction in A1C for each ertugliflozin group vs placebo.  The 
magnitude of the placebo-adjusted least squares (LS) mean change from baseline ranged from a 
decrease of 0.45% to 0.72%.  At Week 12, there was also a significant reduction in A1C for sitagliptin 
vs placebo where the magnitude of placebo-adjusted LS mean change was a decrease of 0.76% from 
baseline.

HbA1c at Week 12 (FAS LOCF) 
Study P042/1004 was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled, 
5-treatment, parallel-group study in subjects with a history of mild to moderate hypertension and a 
diagnosis of T2DM. In total, 194 subjects were randomly assigned to study medication (ertugliflozin 1 
mg, 5 mg and 25 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg or placebo).  Demographic and baseline 
characteristics were well balanced at baseline across treatment groups. 
There was a significant decrease from baseline in the primary efficacy endpoint, average 24-hour SBP 
at Week 4 for all doses of ertugliflozin (1 mg, 5 mg, and 25 mg) vs placebo. The average decreases 
were approximately 3 to 4 mm Hg.  There was also a significant decrease from baseline in the average 
24-hour SBP at Week 4 for HCTZ vs placebo.  The mean decrease from baseline was approximately 
3 mm Hg. There was a dose-dependent change from baseline (increase) in UGE0-24 at Week 4 for all 
doses of ertugliflozin (1 mg, 5 mg, and 25 mg) vs placebo.  In contrast, there was no change from 
baseline in UGE0-24 at Week 4 for HCTZ or placebo. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The phase 3 program evaluating efficacy and safety of 5 mg and 15 mg ertugliflozin once daily was 
designed to support ertugliflozin as an adjunct to diet and exercise for the treatment of patients with

T2DM as monotherapy and combination therapy, add-on or co-initiation, with other anti-
hyperglycaemic agents. A total of seven phase 3 studies have been submitted. 
The focus of the ertugliflozin/metformin registration dossier is on the four studies where ertugliflozin 
and metformin were co-administered; P002/1013, P005/1019, P006/1015 and P007/1017 (Table 3). 
A total of 4863 subjects were randomly assigned to treatment in the Phase 3 studies supporting 
registration of ertugliflozin, with 2597 of these subjects randomly assigned to treatment with 
ertugliflozin on a background of metformin. 
Methods 
Four Phase 3 studies are included in this registration dossier. All were randomized, double-blind, 
parallel-group studies. Two were placebo-controlled studies and 2 were active-controlled studies 
(Table 3).The primary assessment of efficacy was generally performed after 26 weeks or after 52 
weeks (only applicable in the study comparing ertugliflozin with glimepiride as an add-on to 
metformin; Study P002/1013).   
Placebo-controlled studies examined the efficacy of ertugliflozin at doses of 15 mg and 5 mg as add-on 
to background metformin (Study P007/1017) and add-on to background metformin plus sitagliptin 
(Study P006/1015).  
Active-controlled studies evaluated the efficacy of ertugliflozin at doses of 15 mg and 5 mg 
administered as add-on to metformin compared to glimepiride (Study P002/1013) and as an add-on to 
metformin when administered alone or co-administered with sitagliptin in a factorial study design 
(Study P005/1019). 
All studies had a 2-week placebo run-in period prior to randomization. Each study had 2 treatment 
periods: a Phase A period and a Phase B period. Phase A represents the primary time period for 
evaluation of hypotheses. The duration of Phase A was 26 weeks for all studies except Study 
P002/1013, which was 52 weeks.  
The Phase B periods for these studies will provide longer-term safety and efficacy data for ertugliflozin. 
The Phase B periods of these 4 studies are either ongoing (Studies P007/1017 and P002/1013) or have 
completed dosing (Studies P005/1019 and P006/1015). 
Study Participants  
The primary inclusion and exclusion criteria were harmonized across the Phase 3 studies.  Subjects 
were diagnosed with T2DM in accordance with the ADA guidelines; all subjects had inadequate 
glycaemic control at baseline.  The entry A1C range differed based on study design and was slightly 
higher in the study that included co-administration treatment arms, Study P005/1019 (7.5%-11.0%, 
inclusive), relative to the other studies .  Subjects were 18 years of age with no history of other type 
of diabetes, ketoacidosis, CV event within 3 months of screening, or hepatic impairment.  For those 
studies requiring specific background anti-hyperglycaemic therapy, subjects needed to be receiving 
stable dose(s) that reflected near or maximal efficacy for the background anti-hyperglycaemic 
treatment prior to randomization. 
In all studies, subjects needed to be receiving background treatment with a stable metformin dose of 
>1500 mg/day.  For Study P006/1015, background AHA therapy consisted of metformin >1500 
mg/day and sitagliptin 100 mg.  For Studies P007/1017 and P002/1013, subjects with screening 
Assessment report

eGFR<55 mL/min/1.73 m2 or a serum creatinine ≥1.3 mg/dL (men) or ≥1.2 mg/dL (women) were 
excluded.  For Studies P005/1019 and P006/1015, subjects with a screening eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 
m2 were excluded. 
Treatments 
Placebo-controlled studies examined the efficacy of ertugliflozin at doses of 15 mg and 5 mg as add-on 
to background metformin (Study P007/1017) and add-on to background metformin plus sitagliptin 
(Study P006/1015). 
Active-controlled studies evaluated the efficacy of ertugliflozin at doses of 15 mg and 5 mg 
administered as add-on to metformin compared to glimepiride (Study P002/1013) and as an add-on to 
metformin when administered alone or co-administered with sitagliptin in a factorial study design 
(Study P005/1019). 
Thus the combination of ertugliflozin and metformin was compared both to placebo and to active 
control. In addition the triple combination of ertugliflozin, metformin and sitagliptin was compared to 
placebo and active control. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary assessment of efficacy was generally performed after 26 weeks or after 52 weeks (only 
applicable in the study comparing ertugliflozin with glimepiride as an add-on to metformin; 
Study P002/1013). 
The following endpoints were evaluated in all studies: change from baseline in A1C, fasting plasma 
glucose (FPG), body weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and the 
proportion of subjects with A1C <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol). Two-hour post-prandial glucose (PPG) and 
the β-cell responsivity static component (s) was measured in Study P005/1019. 
Sample size 
In study P007/1017 the planned total sample size was approximately 600 subjects, 200 per arm, and 
was to provide at least 99% power to detect a difference of 0.5% between each ertugliflozin dose and 
placebo assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 1.0%. Although a smaller sample size would provide 
sufficient study power, the sample size was chosen to provide additional safety exposure for subjects 
with T2DM and inadequate glycaemic control on metformin in monotherapy, and also to enable BMD 
endpoints to be estimated with a pre-specified degree of precision. 
In study 006/1015 the planned total sample size was approximately 405 subjects, 135 subjects per 
arm, and was chosen to provide adequate exposure data to assess safety for 52 weeks. An effective 
sample size, accounting for e.g. information loss due to missing data, of 120 per arm was to provide 
97% power to detect a true difference in HbA1c of 0.5% between a given ertugliflozin dose and 
placebo. 
In study P002/1013 the planned total sample size was 1230 subjects (410 per arm) and was estimated 
using a non-inferiority margin of 0.3% and the assumption of a true mean difference in HbA1C of 0%. 
In study P005/1019 the planned total sample size was 1250 subjects where a sample size of 250 
subjects per arm were to provide 94% power to declare superiority and detect a difference in HbA1C of

Page 58/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
0.4% for each of the pairwise comparisons at a given ertugliflozin dose level assuming a standard 
deviation (SD) of 1.2%. 
Randomisation 
In all studies an equal allocation ratio was used (i.e. 1:1:1 or, in study P005/1019, 1:1:1:1:1). All the 
studies had a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period prior to randomisation. To be eligible for 
randomisation subjects had to meet all entry criteria that also included being at least 80% compliant 
with the single-blind placebo run-in medication. Randomisation was performed through the use of an 
interactive voice response system/integrated web response system (IVRS/IWRS). 
In study P007/1017, randomisation was stratified based on geographical region and postmenopausal 
status (4 levels). In study P006/1015 randomisation was stratified according to use of sulfonylurea 
(SU) at screening (yes/no). In study P005/1019 randomisation was stratified by participation in the 
mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) (yes/no). 
Blinding (masking) 
After randomisation, all the studies were double-blind. Masking was achieved and maintained in each 
study through the use of a double-dummy approach with a placebo tablet matching the ertugliflozin 5 
mg tablet and another placebo tablet matching the ertugliflozin 10 mg tablet, with, in addition in the 
two active-controlled studies, placebo matching glimepiride (study P002/1013) and placebo matching 
sitagliptin (study P005/1019), respectively. 
All these studies had two post-randomisation treatment periods, Phase A and Phase B. Phase A 
represented the primary time period for evaluation of hypotheses and at the completion of the Phase A 
portion (defined as database lock) subjects’ treatment assignments were unblinded to permit authoring 
of CSRs. Personnel associated with the conduct of the study as well as trial site personnel and 
subjects, were to remain blinded and were not to be unblinded until after the Phase B portion had been 
completed. 
Statistical methods 
Statistical methods were generally similar across the individual Phase 3 studies. All tests were to be 
conducted at a two-sided significance level of α=0.05 using pre-specified multiplicity strategies taking 
into account multiple testing (documented in the SAPs and protocols). 
The analysis population for all efficacy analysis was the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which was to consist of 
all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and had at least one 
measurement for the analysis endpoint (baseline or post-randomisation). Subjects were to be included 
in the treatment group to which they were randomly assigned. A per-protocol (PP) population was also 
defined as a secondary population for analyses of primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Data obtained after the initiation of rescue therapy or after bariatric surgery were to be censored (i.e., 
treated as missing) to avoid the confounding influence of rescue therapy. These analyses were referred 
to as “excluding rescue” (ER). Supplemental efficacy analyses that included measurements collected 
after the start of glycaemic rescue therapy were also performed and were referred to as “including 
rescue approach” (IR). The extent and timing of the use of rescue therapy were to be compared across 
treatment groups by the number and percentage of subjects rescued with an analysis also of time to 
rescue. 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 59/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Two main analysis approaches were used for the efficacy endpoints. The estimand for all of the 
primary hypotheses was the difference in mean A1C improvement at the primary timepoint, in the 
target population defined by the inclusion / exclusion criteria, if all subjects adhered to therapy without 
use of rescue medication 
Continuous endpoints (including the primary endpoint) 
Continuous endpoints were analysed using a constrained LDA (cLDA) model (as proposed by Liang and 
Zeger) with treatment, time, and treatment-by-time interaction along with additional covariates as 
pre-specified for each study included in the model. Time was treated as a categorical variable so that 
no restriction was imposed on the trajectory of the means over time. An unstructured covariance 
matrix was used to model the correlation among repeated measurements. Baseline eGFR values >120 
ml/min/1.73 m2 were set to 120 in these analyses. The treatment difference in terms of mean change 
from baseline to a given time point was estimated and tested from the cLDA model. 
In study P001/1016, P006/1015, P007/1017 and P017/1047, data from any subject incorrectly 
stratified at randomization were analyzed according to the intended stratum rather than the actual 
stratum. An accounting of all incorrectly stratified subjects was provided. 
Within the constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) model framework, no explicit imputation of 
missing assessments is performed. To assess the robustness of the primary analyses to departures 
from the MAR assumption, two sensitivity analyses using the tipping-point approach and a jump-to-
reference multiple-imputation (J2R) method were to be performed. In the J2R analysis, missing values 
were imputed based on the missing-at-random (MAR) assumption for the reference (control) group 
and based on the missing-not-at-random (MNAR) assumption for the ertugliflozin groups using the 
reference group profile for time points after withdrawal. These sensitivity analyses were performed 
under both rescue therapy data handling scenarios; in primary sensitivity analyses, A1C measurements 
collected after the start of glycaemic rescue therapy were considered as missing data and in 
supplemental sensitivity analyses, A1C measurements collected after the start of glycaemic rescue 
therapy were included as reported. 
For study P002/1013, only the tipping point sensitivity analysis was performed because the primary 
efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in A1C at Week 52 was assessed with a non-inferiority 
hypothesis. In addition, primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints at Week 52 were to be repeated 
based on the Per-Protocol (PP) population. The PP population included all randomised subjects who 
took at least one dose of study medication, had a measurement of the analysis endpoint at both 
baseline and in the day range for the time point of interest (Week 52), without any of a number of pre-
defined violations. Also, a modified FAS (mFAS) population, defined as all subjects in the FAS who did 
not have any of the protocol violations as defined for the PP population, was to be an additional 
secondary population. Subjects who discontinued prematurely without a protocol violation were to be 
included in the mFAS. Analyses were to be performed in this population only if its size differed from 
that of the PP population by more than 2% of patients in any arm. 
Binary endpoints 
For the proportions of subjects with A1C <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol), a subject was categorised as having 
met the goal or not having met the goal at the analysis time point based on the observed A1C value or 
an imputed estimate. For subjects in the FAS population with missing A1C values at the analysis time 
point, the cLDA model described above was used to impute the missing A1C value and, therefore, 
categorisation as at or not at the A1C goal at the analysis time point. A logistic regression model 
including terms for treatment and baseline A1C as well as other covariates pre-specified for each study 
was used to estimate the odds ratio for comparison of each ertugliflozin group to the comparator for

each imputed dataset. The parameter estimates from the log odds ratios from 10 imputed data sets 
were combined using Rubin’s rules to yield an overall estimate of the log odds ratio. The log odds ratio 
was back-transformed into the odds ratio for final reporting. 
An additional analysis of the proportion of subjects with A1C at goal was performed where all subjects 
with missing A1C at the analysis time point were counted as not being at goal.

The discontinuation rates were balanced between groups, the overall discontinuation rate being 21%. 
Hyperglycaemia was twice as common in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group (5.4%) compared to the 
ertugliflozin 15 mg group and the glimepiride group. 
Table 13: Disposition of subjects – study P005/1019 (phase A, 26 weeks) 
The discontinuation rates were low and balanced between groups, the overall discontinuation rate 
being 8.5%. Discontinuations due to adverse events were twice as common in the ertugliflozin 15 mg 
+ sitagliptin 100 mg group (2.4%) compared to the other treatment groups given ertugliflozin. The 
lowest rate (0.4%) was observed in the sitagliptin 100 mg group. 
Recruitment 
The ertugliflozin development program was global in scope, with subjects participating from North 
America, Europe, Latin America, Asia, and South Africa. 
Conduct of the study 
Major protocol deviations were reported for between 24 and 33% of subjects across the studies except 
for the renal impairment study (P001/1016) where major protocol deviations were reported for 48% of 
subjects. Across the studies, the most common deviations were “failure to conduct major/significant 
evaluations” and “subjects who did not give appropriate Informed Consent”. Multiple enrolments were 
discovered in all studies, mostly in the US. 
Baseline data 
The mean age of the subjects across the four metformin Phase 3 studies ranged from 55.1 to 59.1 
years. Across the four studies, the proportion of subjects ≥65 years of age ranged from 15.6% to 
29.9%. The majority of subjects in each study were White. The mean duration of diabetes ranged from 
6.9 to 9.5 years. 
The mean weight of the subjects ranged from 84.9 to 88.7 kg and mean baseline BMI ranged from 
30.8 to 31.9 kg/m2.

Subjects with a broad range of baseline hyperglycaemia were included (mean baseline A1C ranged 
from 7.8% to 8.6%) so as to provide an assessment of ertugliflozin efficacy in a population 
representative of the typical patient likely to receive ertugliflozin/metformin FDC. Study P005/1019 
had a higher mean baseline A1C compared with the other studies. Mean baseline FPG ranged from 
161.0 mg/dL to 180.4 mg/dL. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar across the 2 studies included in the 
ertugliflozin/metformin pooled analysis (Studies P007/1017 and P006/1015). 
Overall, the demographics and baseline characteristics of the population in these studies accurately 
reflect the population of patients with T2DM likely to be treated with ertugliflozin and metformin 
combination therapy. 
Numbers analysed 
The analysis population for all efficacy analysis was the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which was to consist of 
all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and had at least one 
measurement for the analysis endpoint (baseline or post-randomisation).

Figure 5: A1C (%): Change from Baseline at Primary Timepoint by Study - Full Analysis Set: 
Excluding Rescue Approach - Ertugliflozin/Metformin Studies 
Long-term data, study P002/1013 
In the 52-week Phase A period of the SU comparator study (Study P002/1013), the primary efficacy 
analysis showed a persistent A1C reduction from baseline though 52 weeks for ertugliflozin 15 mg and 
5 mg.  In contrast to the time-course of A1C reduction from baseline for glimepiride, which returned 
towards baseline after Week 26, the time-course of A1C reduction from baseline for ertugliflozin 15 mg 
and 5 mg was flat throughout the 52 weeks, showing no sign of deterioration (

Figure 6).   
Data from the 52-week Phase B period of the SU comparator study (Study P002/1013) was also 
presented. LS mean reductions from baseline in A1C at Week 104 were similar in the ertugliflozin 
groups and glimepiride group, where the mean and median dose was 3.5 mg/day. A1C responses 
through Week 52 were gradually attenuated through Week 104 in all treatment groups.

Change From Baseline in A1C: Sensitivity and Supplemental Analyses 
Sensitivity analyses were performed in all Phase 3 studies where the primary hypothesis results were 
significant in order to assess the impact of missing data on the primary analysis results for the change 
from baseline in A1C. The conclusions of these sensitivity analyses, which include J2R and tipping-point 
analyses, consistently supported the primary A1C analysis. The J2R analyses, which were applied in all 
studies with a superiority hypothesis compared to the control group, showed that while the conclusions 
were supportive of the primary analysis and the statistical significance of the primary analysis was 
maintained in these J2R sensitivity analysis across all studies, the point estimates of the ertugliflozin 
changes from baseline were smaller under the J2R approach compared with the primary approach. The 
tipping-point analyses, applied to all studies with significant primary hypothesis results, demonstrated 
the robustness of the primary A1C results to missing data. 
The IR approach was also applied in all studies as a supplemental analysis. These are not technically 
sensitivity analyses for the primary estimand, as they address a different estimand. The statistical 
significance of the primary analysis was maintained under the IR approach in all studies; however, in 
placebo-controlled studies: (1) the initiation of rescue therapy occurred at a substantially higher rate in 
the placebo group than in the ertugliflozin groups; (2) the impact of rescue therapy on drug response 
was mainly seen in the placebo group and produced only small changes in the estimates of mean 
change from baseline in the ertugliflozin groups; and, (3) as expected when active rescue therapy is 
added to inactive (placebo) treatment, placebo-adjusted differences were attenuated compared to the 
primary ER approach, mainly due to the increased size of the estimated placebo response.

In the active-controlled studies, Studies P002/1013 and P005/1019, the initiation of rescue therapy 
occurred at a lower rate than in the placebo-controlled studies and was comparable among the 
treatment groups. In these active-controlled studies the differences between the primary ER and 
supplemental IR estimated mean A1C changes from baseline were small.  
Secondary endpoints 
Change from baseline in FPG 
Change from baseline in FPG was measured in all 4 studies but was included in the statistical testing 
sequence in 3 of the 4 Phase 3 studies; change in FPG was not included in the statistical testing 
sequence for Study P002/1013.  Results for the change from baseline in FPG are presented in

2-hour post-prandial glucose 
Change from baseline in 2-hour PPG at Week 26 was measured in the ertugliflozin co-administration 
with sitagliptin factorial study (Study P005/1019) in the subset of subjects who participated in the 
mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT).  This endpoint was not part of the formal testing sequence.  
Ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg added to metformin background therapy demonstrated clinically 
meaningful reductions from baseline in 2-hour PPG.   
Proportion of Subjects with A1C<7.0% 
The proportion of subjects with A1C<7.0% was measured in all studies as a secondary efficacy 
endpoint but was not subject to formal hypothesis testing in Study P002/1013 or amongst the single 
treatment arms on Study P005/1019.  Results for the proportion of subjects with A1C <7.0%, in the 
Phase 3 studies in support of the ertugliflozin/metformin FDC submission are presented in Table 16.

Change From Baseline in Diastolic Blood Pressure 
Changes in DBP were in line with results described above in SBP.  Decreases in DBP were numerically 
greater in ertugliflozin treatment groups compared to placebo or glimepiride, and numerically greater 
in ertugliflozin 15 mg treatment groups compared to 5 mg treatment groups.  In Study P007/1017, the 
LS mean reductions in DBP were significantly greater for both ertugliflozin doses compared to placebo. 
Summary of main studies 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Clinical studies in special populations 
The only study in special populations conducted was study P001/1016 which included patients with 
renal impairment. 
A substantial proportion of patients included in the controlled trials (21.3%) were aged 65 to 74 years, 
whereas 4.3% were aged 75 to 84 years. Only 8 subjects were older than 85 years, most of which (7) 
were treated with ertugliflozin.

Renal impairment: Study P001/1016 
Study P001/1016 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group 
study of ertugliflozin in subjects with T2DM and Stage 3 CKD (eGFR ≥30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) to 
assess the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin compared with placebo (Table 24).

† Randomization was stratified by eGFR ≥45 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Stage 3A chronic kidney 
disease; 309 subjects) and eGFR ≥30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Stage 3B chronic kidney disease; 159 
subjects).

The primary study analysis concerned the change from baseline at Week 26 in A1C in the Overall 
Cohort.  Change from baseline in A1C was further analysed in the Stage 3A CKD (eGFR ≥45 to <60 
mL/min/1.73 m2) cohort as a secondary endpoint.  All additional key secondary endpoints were pre-
specified for analysis only in the Stage 3A CKD cohort. 
Changes to Planned Analyses 
Post-hoc analyses to evaluate the A1C change from baseline in subjects with and without positive 
metformin assay results were added after review of the pre-specified A1C analysis results identified an 
unusual placebo response, characterized by notable decreases in A1C between Week 18 and Week 26, 
in the Overall Cohort and Stage 3A CKD stratum.  Metformin was not allowed as a concomitant 
background medication in this study given the eGFR entry criterion.  Retained pharmacokinetic (PK) 
and future biomedical research (FBR) samples were assayed for metformin concentrations.  The assays 
subsequently identified surreptitious metformin use in some subjects in all treatment groups that was 
not reported to investigators.  Because concomitant metformin use could confound the comparison of 
ertugliflozin vs placebo, post-hoc analyses were added to evaluate the treatment response in subjects 
with (1) at least 1 positive metformin assay result at any time point; and (2) no positive metformin 
assay results.   
Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
In total, 468 subjects were randomly assigned to study medication and 467 subjects took at least 
1 dose of study medication.  Of the treated patients, a total of 159 subjects were stratified to the 
Stage 3B CKD stratum and 308 subjects to the Stage 3A CKD stratum.

For the Overall Cohort, 49.5% of subjects were males, the mean age was 67.3 years, 81.4% were 
White, and approximately 50% had a history of CV disease or heart failure.  The mean duration of 
T2DM (approximately 14 years) was not meaningfully different across treatment groups.  More than 
95% of subjects in each treatment group were on background AHA therapy at screening.  The majority 
of these subjects were receiving insulin and analogues for injection (55.9%), and/or SUs (40.3%).  
There were no important differences in demographics and baseline characteristics between the 3 
treatment groups. 
The post-hoc analysis excluded those subjects who had at least 1 assay result positive for metformin 
(ie, plasma sample with measurable concentration of metformin).  Given that metformin was not 
allowed per the protocol and its use was not reported to the investigators, the presence of metformin 
at any time point had the potential to confound the glycaemic efficacy analyses.  These analyses were 
conducted for both the Overall Cohort and Stage 3A CKD stratum.  Removal of the subjects from these 
cohorts did not result in any meaningful changes in the subject demographics or baseline 
characteristics. 
Archived blood samples collected for PK from Weeks 6, 12, and 18, and for FBR at Week 26 were 
analysed for metformin.  In all, 78 subjects had at least 1 sample positive for metformin.  The 
percentages of subjects with positive assay results were similar across the 3 treatment groups. 
Key Efficacy Endpoint Results 
Table 25 shows the key results from both the primary and post-hoc analysis. 
In the primary analysis, although the LS mean reduction from baseline in A1C at Week 26 in the 
ertugliflozin 15 mg group was numerically greater than in the placebo group, the between-group 
difference was not statistically significant.  The LS mean reduction in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group was 
similar to that of the placebo group.  Hypothesis testing within the ordered testing procedure was 
therefore stopped after the first test, and secondary hypotheses were not tested.  
The post-hoc analysis of change from baseline in A1C at Week 26 excluded subjects who had positive 
metformin assay results.  Exclusion of subjects who had positive metformin assay results markedly 
dampened the A1C response in the placebo group with little impact to the change from baseline in the 
ertugliflozin groups; in the placebo group, the estimated decrease in A1C from baseline at Week 26 
was reduced by nearly half after removal of subjects who had positive metformin assay results (post-
hoc analysis: -0.14% vs pre-specified analysis: -0.26%).  As a result, in the post-hoc analysis, the LS 
mean reduction from baseline in A1C at Week 26 was greater in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group and 
numerically greater in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group compared with the placebo group.  For the 
ertugliflozin 15 mg vs placebo comparison, the 95% CI for the between-group difference excluded 0.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Efficacy data were pooled for the 2 placebo-controlled studies (Studies P007/1017 and P006/1015) to 
assess efficacy on a background of metformin (hereafter referred to as the Ertu/Met FDC Pool). The 
primary purpose of pooling these efficacy data was to provide a more robust analysis of efficacy by 
subgroup.  Pooled efficacy endpoints for subgroup analyses included change from baseline in A1C, 
responders (A1C <7.0%), and change from baseline in body weight.  The subgroup analyses are 
exploratory and no formal hypotheses were tested.  Subgroup factors assessed included age, gender, 
race, ethnicity, region, baseline A1C, baseline body mass index (BMI), baseline eGFR, and duration of 
T2DM. 
Subgroup Analysis: Change from Baseline in A1C 
In the Ertu/Met FDC Pool, treatment with ertugliflozin on a background of metformin resulted in 
reductions in A1C that were superior to the results in the placebo group at Week 26, irrespective of 
gender, age, sex, race, ethnicity, geographic region, baseline BMI, baseline A1C, and duration of 
T2DM, Figure 7 and Figure 8.  
In general, clinically meaningful reductions from baseline in A1C were observed with ertugliflozin 5 mg 
and ertugliflozin 15 mg compared with placebo across all subgroup categories.  In general, ertugliflozin

15 mg had a numerically greater placebo-adjusted A1C reduction from baseline compared with 
ertugliflozin 5 mg across subgroup categories.  The placebo-adjusted LS mean reduction from baseline 
in A1C was greater in subjects with a higher versus a lower baseline A1C.   
The placebo-adjusted LS mean reduction from baseline in A1C was greater in subjects with normal 
renal function compared with subjects with renal impairment.  Subjects with mild renal impairment had 
clinically meaningful reductions in A1C relative to placebo with both doses of ertugliflozin tested.  
Although the subgroup sample size was small (n =31), meaningful lowering of A1C was also observed 
with ertugliflozin 15 mg in subjects with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2.  The results must be interpreted 
with caution in light of the sample size.

Subgroup Analysis: Change From Baseline in Body Weight 
Treatment with ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg on a background therapy of metformin resulted in 
reductions in body weight that were superior to the placebo group at Week 26 for the Ertu/Met FDC 
Pool.   
In general, the placebo-adjusted LS mean reductions from baseline in body weight at Week 26 were 
consistent across the subgroups evaluated.   
No notable differences were observed among the subgroups of age, gender, race, region, baseline 
A1C, and duration of T2DM.

In the subgroup with baseline eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, smaller reductions from baseline in body 
weight were observed, as expected based on the mechanism of action.

Study P003/1022: Monotherapy Study 
Study Design 
Study P003/1022 was a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group study with a 26-week, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled treatment period (Phase A) followed by a 26-week active-controlled treatment 
period (Phase B) in subjects with T2DM and inadequate glycaemic control on diet and exercise to 
assess the A1C-lowering efficacy of ertugliflozin compared with placebo and to provide pivotal Phase 3 
data on the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin as monotherapy (no treatment with other AHAs) (Table 
28).  
The primary efficacy analysis was carried out excluding post-rescue efficacy data.   
Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
In total, 461 subjects were randomly assigned to study medication.  The mean age of the subjects was 
56.4 years, 56.6% were male, 83.7% of subjects were White, 8.5% were Asian, and 6.3% were Black 
or African American.  The mean duration of T2DM was 4.99 years.  Baseline demographic and 
anthropometric characteristics were similar between treatment groups.   
Key Efficacy Endpoint Results 
Table 29 show the results of the primary analysis of change from baseline in A1C at Week 26 using 
the cLDA model in the FAS population ER approach.  The LS mean reductions from baseline in A1C at 
Week 26 were significantly greater in the 15 mg and 5 mg ertugliflozin groups compared to the 
placebo group (p<0.001 for both comparisons).   
The results for the key efficacy endpoints are also presented in Table 29.

Study P017/1047: Ertugliflozin Plus Sitagliptin Initial Combination Study 
Study Design 
Study P017/1047 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of initial combination therapy with ertugliflozin and sitagliptin 
in subjects with T2DM with inadequate glycaemic control on diet and exercise alone (Table 28).   
The primary efficacy analysis was carried out excluding post-rescue efficacy data.    
Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
In total, 291 subjects were randomly assigned to study medication.  The mean age of the subjects was 
55.6 years, 57.4% were male, 90.4% of subjects were White and 4.5% were Black or African 
American.  The mean duration of T2DM was 6.30 years.  Baseline demographic and anthropometric 
characteristics and the distribution of subjects by AHA use at screening were generally similar between 
treatment groups, with the exception that more subjects in the placebo group were in North America 
(excluding Central America) compared to the E15/S100 and E5/S100 groups.   
Key Efficacy Endpoint Results 
Table 30 show the results of the primary analysis of change from baseline in A1C at Week 26, 
excluding data after initiation of glycaemic rescue therapy.  The LS mean reductions from baseline in 
A1C at Week 26 were significantly greater in the E15/S100 and E5/S100 groups than in the placebo 
group (p<0.001 for both comparisons). 
Large reductions in A1C in the co-administration groups at Week 6 (first scheduled post-randomization 
assessment) were followed by smaller subsequent reductions through Week 26.  The reduction in A1C 
was numerically greater in the E15/S100 group than in the E5/S100 group at each time point.  In the 
placebo group, there was essentially no change from baseline in A1C through Week 12; thereafter, a 
reduction in A1C was observed at Week 26. 
The results for the key efficacy endpoints are also presented in Table 30.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Seven studies are submitted in support of the current application. All studies have reached the primary 
endpoint at either 26 or 52 weeks. All but one study (P017/1047) have extensions (phase B) and were 
still ongoing at the time of the submission of the application. The final CSRs for 5 of the 6 studies with 
Phase B periods have been submitted during the procedure. Four of the studies are considered pivotal 
for the current application for the fixed dose combination of ertugliflozin and metformin, whereas three 
studies are included to further support the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin as monocomponent. One 
of these three studies was performed in patients with renal impairment (P001/1016) whereas the other 
two studies are considered supportive (P003/1022 and P017/1047).

A total of 4864 subjects were randomly assigned to treatment in the Phase 3 studies supporting 
registration of ertugliflozin, with 2597 of these subjects randomly assigned to treatment with 
ertugliflozin on a background of metformin. In the studies, ertugliflozin and metformin were 
administered as free combination and metformin was given according to label. 
The decision of which doses to investigate in the phase 3 program was based on data from the phase 1 
program and from two dose finding studies. Study P016/1006 was a 12-week study investigating the 
effect of ertugliflozin at doses ranging from 1 mg qd up to 25 mg qd. Placebo and sitagliptin were 
included as control. A dose-response effect with regards to HbA1c was observed, but the additional 
effect observed at doses above 5 mg qd was very modest as the efficacy observed with the 5 mg qd 
dose was >80% of the maximal response for HbA1c. At doses ranging from 5 mg to 25 mg qd, the 
magnitude of the effect on HbA1c was comparable to that observed with sitagliptin 100 mg. A decrease 
in body weight and blood pressure was also observed.  
Study P042/1004 was a 4-week study designed to primarily investigate the effect of ertugliflozin on 
blood pressure compared to HCTZ and placebo. An increased effect on systolic BP was observed at 5 
mg qd compared to 1 mg qd, whereas no additional effect was observed at the highest dose of 25 mg 
qd. The magnitude of the effect was comparable to that observed with a low dose of HCTZ 12.5 mg. 
The effects observed on UGE were in line with the effects observed in the Phase 1 studies. 
The 5 mg qd and 15 mg qd dose were further investigated in the phase 3 studies. 
The clinical development program is in line with the EMA guideline “Clinical investigation of medicinal 
product in the treatment or prevention of diabetes mellitus” (CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev.1) and the EMA 
guideline “Clinical development of fixed combination medicinal products” (CHMP/EWP/240/95 Rev. 1). 
Two of the pivotal studies investigated ertugliflozin as add-on to ongoing metformin treatment. In 
study P007/1017, ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg respectively was compared to placebo. The overall 
study duration was 104 weeks with the primary endpoint measured at 26 weeks. In study P002/1013, 
ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg respectively was compared to glimepiride and the primary objective was 
to show that ertugliflozin 15 mg and 5 mg was non-inferior to glimepiride. The overall study duration 
was 104 weeks with the primary endpoint measured at 52 weeks.  
In the other two studies, triple combination with ertugliflozin, metformin and sitagliptin was 
investigated. Study P006/1015 included patients on stable background therapy with metformin ≥1500 
mg/day and sitagliptin 100 mg/day. Ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg respectively (as add-on to metformin 
+ sitagliptin) was compared to placebo. The overall study duration was 52 weeks with the primary 
endpoint measured at 26 weeks. Study P005/1019 was a factorial study comparing ertugliflozin 5 mg 
and 15 mg with the combined treatment of both ertugliflozin doses with sitagliptin 100 mg as add-on 
to metformin treatment. A treatment arm with sitagliptin 100 mg was also included. The overall study 
duration was 52 weeks with the primary endpoint measured at 26 weeks.  
In addition to these studies, three studies from the ertugliflozin clinical development program were 
included. The supportive studies were study P003/1022 (26 weeks + 26 weeks), which was a 
monotherapy study comparing ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg with placebo, and study P017/1047 (26 
weeks), in which the concomitant use of ertugliflozin (5 mg and 15 mg) and sitagliptin 100 mg, was 
compared to placebo. The third study was conducted in patients with moderate renal impairment 
(study P001/1016). Patients were to be on stable AHA therapy (including insulin) and all AHAs except 
metformin, rosiglitazone and other SGLT2-inhibitors were allowed. Ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg were 
compared to placebo. The overall study duration was 52 weeks with the primary endpoint measured at 
26 weeks.

The studies were of adequate designed and duration. One study (study P002/1013) provides one-year 
data. All studies applied run-in phases where background medication was stabilised. 
The inclusion criteria were in most part aligned between studies. The inclusion criteria regarding HbA1c 
varied somewhat between studies, as did the inclusion criteria with regards to renal function. The 
inclusion and exclusion criteria were adequate. 
The same primary endpoint, change from baseline HbA1c, was applied in all studies. Apart from “2-
hour postprandial glucose” and “change from baseline in β cell responsivity static component” which 
were only measured in one study, all secondary endpoints were the same in all studies although not 
always included in the statistical testing. All key endpoints were relevant. 
Sample size calculations were overall adequate and randomisation procedures performed as planned. 
Masking was achieved and maintained in each study through the use of a double-dummy approach and 
was appropriate. All the studies had two post-randomisation treatment periods, Phase A and Phase B; 
when phase A had been completed data from this phase was unblinded. This is acceptable since phase 
A was the primary time period for evaluation of hypotheses; those associated with the conduct of a 
study as well as trial site personnel and subjects were to remain blinded until after the Phase B portion 
had been completed. 
Statistical methods were generally similar across the individual phase 3 studies. The estimand for all of 
the primary hypotheses was the difference in mean A1C improvement at the primary timepoint, in the 
target population defined by the inclusion / exclusion criteria, if all subjects adhered to therapy without 
use of rescue medication. 
The analysis population for all efficacy analyses was the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which was to consist 
of all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and had at least one 
measurement for the analysis endpoint (baseline or post-randomisation). Data obtained after the 
initiation of rescue therapy or after bariatric surgery were to be treated as missing to avoid the 
confounding influence of rescue therapy. However, in a superiority study versus placebo, in theory, if 
the experimental treatment works, the IR (including rescue) approach should result in a more 
conservative estimate. In study P002/1013 with the primary objective being to show non-inferiority, 
the ER (excluding rescue) is agreed with. 
For analyses of continuous endpoints (including the primary endpoint) a constrained longitudinal data 
analysis (cLDA) model framework was used in which no explicit imputation of missing assessments is 
performed. Of importance for the credibility of any estimated primary outcome will then be to what 
extent subjects stayed in a study and contributed with data considering that missing at random (MAR) 
seldom is a plausible assumption. To assess the robustness of the primary analyses to departures from 
the MAR assumption, sensitivity analyses using the tipping-point approach and a jump-to-reference 
(J2R) multiple-imputation method were performed. The sensitivity approach using the J2R approach is 
considered a reasonably conservative method for treatment of missing data that is not considered 
missing at random. Patients in the active treatment group are assigned a placebo-like value and the 
placebo treated patients are assigned a value that does not punish the placebo treatment. In study 
P006/1015 and P007/1017, data from any subject incorrectly stratified at randomization were analysed 
according to the intended stratum rather than the actual stratum. An accounting of all incorrectly 
stratified subjects was provided. The primary analysis should reflect the restriction on the 
randomisation implied by the stratification. 
With regards to the conduct of the studies, major protocol deviation was reported for between 24 and 
33% of subjects across the phase III studies except for the renal impairment study (P001/1016) where 
major protocol deviations were reported for 48% of subjects. Across the studies, the most common 
Assessment report

Page 104/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
deviations were “failure to conduct major/significant evaluations” and “subjects who did not give 
appropriate Informed Consent”. Notably, multiple enrolments were discovered in all studies, mostly in 
the US. When this issue was detected, adequate preventive measures were taken. With regard to 
those who were randomised multiple times across sites within a study and/or across studies the 
Applicant’s conclusion is agreed with, i.e. that the significant misconduct of these particular subjects 
compromised the integrity of their study data, and therefore results from these subjects were excluded 
from all analyses. It is concluded that the protocol deviations did not influence the outcome and 
interpretation of results in the studies.  
Furthermore, after breaking the blind in part A of study P001/1016 (renal impairment), it was 
discovered that 78 subjects (out of 467) had blood samples positive for metformin. Post-hoc analyses 
were performed, since concomitant metformin use confounds the comparison of ertugliflozin versus 
placebo. The high use of prohibited medication raises concerns with regards to the conduct of the 
study, also taking into consideration the high rate of major protocol deviations in this study. The 
Applicant has discussed potential reasons for the use of prohibited medication and claims that the use 
appears to have been patient-initiated. Internal audits were conducted which showed no indication that 
study P001/1016 was not generally performed according to GCP.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The demographics and baseline characteristics of the subjects in the phase 3 program were 
comparable across the studies.  The demographics and baseline characteristics of the phase 3 
population are considered representative for the target population. About 40% (36-45%) of patients 
were recruited in Europe (including Russia). 
Across the phase 3 studies, i.e. including the supportive studies, discontinuation rates were generally 
low (6-13%) and balanced between groups. There were two exceptions. In study P002/1013 the 
overall discontinuation rate was 21%, however this study was of 52 weeks duration and 
discontinuations were balanced between groups. In the supportive monotherapy study (P003/1022) 
the discontinuation rate was slightly higher in the placebo group (22%), the overall discontinuation 
rate being 17%. The difference is explained by higher discontinuation due to hyperglycaemia and lack 
of efficacy in the placebo group. No efficacy analyses were planned or have been performed including 
all randomised subjects.  Overall, across the studies, very few subjects if any were however excluded 
from the primary analysis set (FAS). Depending on how data collected after rescue was handled, the 
proportion of subjects with missing endpoint data week 26/52 varied where the primary ER approach 
(treating data obtained after initiation of rescue therapy as missing) implied higher proportions of 
patients with missing week 26/52 data. In the non-inferiority study P002/1013, supportive analyses 
were performed based also on a PP population. The proportion of patients excluded from the PP 
analyses was highest in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, approximately 26%, with a slightly lower but 
similar proportions  in the ertugliflozin 15 mg and glimepiride arm, respectively (approximately 22%). 
In two of the studies, ertugliflozin was given as add-on to metformin alone. In study P007/1017 
(where ertugliflozin was compared to placebo), the treatment difference versus placebo was -0.70% 
(-0.87,-0.53) for the 5 mg dose and -0.88% (-1.05,-0.71) for the 15 mg dose. In the non-inferiority 
study P002/1013, ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg was compared to glimepiride. The treatment target for 
glimepiride is stated to have been 6 to 8 mg daily; however the actual dose was 3 mg daily. According 
to European label, the maximum dose is 6 mg but increases above 4 mg seldom results in added effect 
(Amaryl, NL/H/0101). The achieved glimepiride dose is therefore considered relevant. The treatment 
difference vs glimepiride was 0.18% (0.06, 0.30) for the 5 mg dose and 0.10 (-0.02, 0.22) for the 15 
mg dose. Thus non-inferiority was shown for the 15 mg dose as the non-inferiority margin chosen was 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 105/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
0.3% whereas the outcome for the 5 mg was of borderline character since the chosen delta of 0.3% 
was included in the upper limit of the 95% CI. The change from baseline in HbA1c was clinically 
relevant for both doses (-0.56 ± 0.045 for the 5 mg dose and -0.64 ± 0.045 for the 15 mg dose). For 
assessment of robustness of primary outcomes, PP analyses and analyses based on modified FAS 
(using both the ER and IR approach) were performed; the outcomes, irrespective of analysis and 
comparison, were very similar and supported the primary outcome.  
In study P006/1015, ertugliflozin was given as add-on to metformin and sitagliptin with placebo as 
control. In this study, the treatment difference versus placebo was -0.69% (-0.87,-0.50) for the 5 mg 
dose and -0.76% (-0.95,-0.58) for the 15 mg dose. In the factorial study P005/1019, where 
ertugliflozin was either given as single therapy or co-administered with sitagliptin on background 
metformin therapy, single therapy with ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg resulted in very similar HbA1c 
reductions of -1.02% and -1.08%, respectively. The HbA1c reduction with single therapy sitagliptin 
100 mg was -1.05%. Both combinations (ertugliflozin 5mg + sitagliptin 100 mg and ertugliflozin 15 mg 
+ sitagliptin 100 mg) resulted in very similar differences in treatment effect compared to the 
respective single component of -0.43% to -0.49%. 
In the placebo-controlled studies, statistically significant and clinically relevant treatment differences in 
the change from baseline in HbA1c were observed for both doses compared to placebo. The magnitude 
of effect of about 0.7-0.9% was consistent in studies P007/1017 (metformin only) and P006/1015 
(metformin + sitagliptin). In studies P002/1013 and P005/1019, no placebo-adjustment was made. In 
these studies, the change from baseline in HbA1c ranged from -0.6% to -1.1%. It may therefore be 
concluded that ertugliflozin provides a relevant contribution to the effect of the FDC. 
In study P002/1013, the duration of phase A of the study was 52 weeks, thus this study provides some 
long-term data on the effect of ertugliflozin. The data show that the maximum effect was observed 
after 12 weeks and the remained stable in contrast with the effect of glimepiride which reached its 
maximum effect after 18 weeks thereafter the effect slowly decreased. Data was also provided from 
the 52-week Phase B of study P002/1013 showing that, although the HbA1c response was gradually 
attenuated through week 104, a relevant HbA1c reduction was still observed (-0.31% for ertugliflozin 5 
mg, -0.36 for ertugliflozin 15 mg and -0.42 for glimepiride).  
Additional long-term data was provided from the four studies (P003/1022, P005/1019, P006/1015, and 
P001/1016) that have finalised the extension phase and thus provide 52 week data. Across the 
studies, the treatment effect was maintained over the 52 week duration of treatment, both with 
regards to metabolic control, as reflected by HbA1c and responder rates (HbA1c <7%), and body 
weight. 
The primary scientific question of interest was defined by the Applicant as “the intervention effect in 
the setting where all subjects tolerate and adhere to treatment”. This was not fully agreed with since 
this would reflect efficacy in a hypothetical setting where patients are compliant which may not 
obviously apply in normal clinical practice. The analyses using the IR approach addresses efficacy in a 
treatment policy setting, which is a different question of scientific interest. The results based on the IR 
approach and the missing data handling using J2R is considered a more reasonable and conservative 
estimate of the treatment effect in a treatment policy setting, hence, a greater focus will be on the 
results using the IR approach and with J2R handling of missing data. All the sensitivity and supportive 
analyses performed had been provided although have only been found for each study separately. The 
Applicant was therefore requested to provide a summary table for the primary endpoint for the 
placebo-controlled studies, P007/1017 and P006/1015 and the active-controlled study P005/1019 
using the IR approach and J2R handling of missing data. By now, the requested table has been 
provided. The IR (J2R) analysis provides conservative estimate of the treatment effect, especially in 
Assessment report

the placebo-controlled studies, due to the fact that the patients in the placebo arms received rescue 
treatment controlling their A1C-levels. As further discussed below the treatment effect remains, 
however the point estimates indicate a smaller treatment effect. In their response, the applicant 
argued that the inclusion of post-glycaemic rescue measurements leads to uninterpretable results. This 
is not agreed, but rather that it addresses a different question and can be of great relevance in the 
understanding of the treatment effect compared to other treatments. The results based on the two 
different approaches are however not comparable due to the differences in analysis approach. Within 
the above request, the applicant was made aware that the product documentation such as SmPC may 
need to be updated as based on these outcomes in case considered the most relevant. History and 
consistency across labels for other members of the SGLT2 inhibitor class is however essential and this 
application follows after several other products in the same class. The labelling for the already 
approved products includes data on control of A1C-levels, excluding post-rescue medication efficacy 
data. Hence, considering that this product has predecessors in the same class it is concluded that for 
consistency, it is the pre-specified primary analysis excluding data post-rescue treatment that should 
be presented in the product labelling. 
Comparing the primary (ER) and supportive (IR) analyses, statistical significance of the primary 
analysis was maintained under the IR approach. Estimated treatment differences between ertugliflozin 
doses and placebo in both study P006/1015 and P007/1017 were however smaller based on 
differences in rescue therapy use that occurred at a higher rate in the placebo group than in the 
ertugliflozin groups in both studies. The differences in the use of rescue are considered to support the 
treatment efficacy of ertugliflozin in each setting, respectively. In study P005/1019 use of rescue 
occurred at a lower rate and hence, analysis approach had a smaller impact on estimated differences.  
The outcome of the secondary endpoints was consistent with the primary endpoint across the studies. 
Reductions from baseline in FPG were in line with the reductions observed for HbA1c. In the studies 
where ertugliflozin was coadministered with sitagliptin, a greater effect was observed with the 
combination compared to the single components. Treatment with ertugliflozin resulted in significant 
reductions in 2-hour PPG in study P005/1019.  
In all studies, 26 to 40% of subjects achieved the treatment goal of HbA1c <7.0% when ertugliflozin 
was given in combination with metformin only. Higher responder rates were observed when 
ertugliflozin was given in triple combination with sitagliptin. The proportion of subjects receiving 
glycaemic rescue therapy in all ertugliflozin groups was low, ranging from 0% to 6.4%. The proportion 
of subjects rescued was higher in the placebo groups, ranging from 16.3% to 17.7%.  
Across the studies, consistent reductions from baseline in body weight were observed with ertugliflozin 
5 mg and 15 mg. The placebo or active control adjusted weight reduction ranged from 1.6 to 4.3 kg. 
The largest treatment difference was observed in the ertugliflozin vs glimepiride study (study 
P002/1013) due to the weight increase observed in the glimepiride treated group. There was no clear 
dose response relationship with regards to body weight.  
Reductions from baseline in sitting SBP were observed with ertugliflozin 15 mg and 5 mg across the 
phase 3 studies regardless of between-study differences in background medication and study designs. 
The reduction in SBP ranged from -2.8 mmHg to -4.8 mmHg with slightly larger reductions in the 
higher ertugliflozin dose groups. Reductions in DBP were observed in line with the data for SBP.  
Study P001/1016 included with patients renal impairment and is part of the clinical study program 
supporting the MAA for ertugliflozin. All AHAs (including insulin) except metformin, rosiglitazone and 
other SGLT2-inhibitors were allowed. Due to different entry criteria than in the other studies in the 
phase 3 program, subjects who were older, had a lower baseline eGFR, and a longer duration of T2DM 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018

were included.  In the primary analysis, no relevant effect on HbA1c was observed for any of the doses 
compared to placebo. In the post-hoc analysis in the overall cohort (which excluded patients who had 
blood samples positive for metformin), a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c was observed in 
the high dose group (-0.33%, 95%CI: -0.55, -0.11). The post-hoc analysis was also conducted in the 
subgroup of patients with eGFR 45-60. The change from baseline in HbA1c was comparable to that of 
the overall cohort, thus of questionable clinical relevance. The outcome of the secondary glycaemic 
endpoints was also lower than in studies including patients with eGFR >60. The effect on body weight 
and SBP was also attenuated. No difference in the proportion of responders was observed in any of the 
dose groups compared to placebo.  
In the “grade 3B renal impairment” stratum, removal of data of metformin-users had negligible impact 
on HbA1C results.  Ertugliflozin seemed ineffective in subjects with eGFR lower than 45 
mL/min/1.73m2. This was not influenced by removing or including corrupted data. This fact, which 
should be interpreted with caution due to the post-hoc nature and small sample size, can further 
support that ertugliflozin may not have benefit in these patients. 
Study P001/1016 was the only study where patients were allowed to use insulin and/or SU as 
background medication. Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint in patients on background insulin 
showed no difference in outcome versus placebo for the ertugliflozin 5 mg group and a very modest 
and statistically non-significant improvement of -0.2% for the ertugliflozin 15 mg group. The 
corresponding analysis for patients on background SU treatment showed no treatment difference 
compared to placebo. The subgroup of subjects using insulin at baseline (N= 263/467) showed a 
HbA1c change from baseline both in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group (-0.36% [-0.57, -0.16]) and in the 
ertugliflozin 5 mg group (-0.12% [-0.33, 0.09]). In the subgroup of subjects on a sulfonylurea at 
baseline (N=147/467), the HbA1c change from baseline was -0.45% (-0.69, -0.22) and -0.51% 
(-0.74, -0.28) for the ertugliflozin 15 mg and 5 mg groups, respectively. It can be hypothesised that a 
more pronounced effect would be observed in patients with normal renal function. 
Subgroup analyses were performed on pooled data from the two placebo-controlled studies (studies 
P007/1017, and P006/1015) which is considered adequate. Demographic and baseline characteristics 
were comparable across the two studies included in the analysis. Across the subgroup analysis a 
greater effect was observed with the higher dose, but there is a considerable overlap of the confidence 
intervals. There was a greater effect of ertugliflozin in younger subjects compared to older subjects, 
which may be explained by the decrease in renal function by age. A greater effect was also observed in 
males than in females. Both groups experienced relevant effects but there is currently no data that can 
explain the gender difference. A relevant treatment effect was observed in patients with mild renal 
impairment, whereas the effect in patients with eGFR < 60 is questionable. Although the point 
estimates are in favour of ertugliflozin, the confidence intervals are wide and include 0. In contrast to 
the data on change from baseline in HbA1c, the effect on body weight was observed across all 
subgroups studies. Again the least convincing effect was observed in the group with eGFR < 60. 
Two supportive studies which are part of the clinical study program supporting the MAA for ertugliflozin 
were also included in the submission.  
Study P003/1022 investigated the effect of ertugliflozin as monotherapy versus placebo. Statistically 
significant and clinically relevant treatment differences in the change from baseline in HbA1c were 
observed for both the 5 mg and the 15 mg dose compared to placebo (-0.99% (-1.22,-0.76) for 
ertugliflozin 5 mg and -1.16% (-1.39, -0.93) for ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively). The numerical 
difference in HbA1c reduction was small (-0.14%). Secondary glycaemic endpoints all supported the 
primary endpoint. Only a modest increase in the proportion of patients with HbA1c<7.0% was 
observed with the higher dose of ertugliflozin (28% vs 36%). A significant decrease in body weight of 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 108/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
about 2 kg was observed with both doses. Decreases in SBP and DBP were also observed, being more 
pronounced in the lower dose. 
In study P017/1047, combination therapy with ertugliflozin and sitagliptin was initiated without other 
AHA background treatment. The treatment effect was comparable to that observed in study P005/1019 
(-1.16% (95%CI:-1.49, -0.84) for the 5 mg dose and -1.24% (95%CI:-1.57, -0.91) for the 15 mg 
dose). Notably, the treatment effect in the placebo group was larger than in any of the other studies 
(-0.44%) and especially when compared to the monotherapy study where patients also did not receive 
any active treatment. This difference is most likely due to differences in baseline HbA1c between 
studies. The combination treatments resulted in clinically relevant and statistically significant HbA1c 
reductions compared to placebo. Secondary glycaemic endpoints all supported the primary endpoint. 
The proportion of patients with HbA1c<7.0% was higher in the low dose of ertugliflozin compared to 
the high dose (36% vs 31%). A significant decrease in body weight of about 2 kg was observed with 
both doses. Decreases in SBP and DBP were also observed. 
No formal comparisons were made between the two doses of ertugliflozin. The treatment difference 
between the doses ranged from 0.06% to 0.18%. The difference in responder rates (HbA1c <7.0%) 
between the two ertugliflozin doses was generally small (about 4-6%). However, numerically larger 
HbA1c reductions were consistently observed with the higher dose. The treatment difference was most 
pronounced in the population with median HbA1c > 7.9%. Thus the higher dose may provide additional 
benefit for patients with a greater need for better metabolic control. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The clinical data provided show that ertugliflozin has clinically relevant effects on both glycaemic 
control, in terms of HbA1c reduction, and reductions in body weight and SBP, when given in 
combination with metformin thus supporting the FDC. The data submitted also show that the effect is 
maintained up to one year. 
The effect of ertugliflozin is dependent on renal function.  Taking into account the modest effect also 
with the highest dose in patients with eGFR 45-60, it is recommended not to initiate treatment in 
patients with eGFR < 60 although treatment may be continued until eGFR falls below 45. 
The proposed indication states that Segluromet can be used in combination with other AHA including 
insulin. Patients were allowed to use insulin and/or SU as background medication only in study 
(P001/1016) in which the primary endpoint was not met. As the effect of ertugliflozin decreases with 
declining renal function, it can be hypothesised that the effect will be more pronounced in a population 
with normal renal function. Since the MOA for SGLT2 inhibitors is independent on the background 
antihyperglycaemic therapy a clinically relevant effect is expected when ertugliflozin is used together 
with insulin or SU in patients with normal renal function. 
Study P001/1016 provides sufficient data to support a pharmacological effect of ertugliflozin in 
combination with insulin or SU. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety assessment is focused on safety data from 7 phase III studies, including 3,409 subjects 
exposed to ertugliflozin. Overall, 1,716 subjects were treated with ertugliflozin 5 mg, 1,693 with 
ertugliflozin 15 mg, and 1,450 with comparator (placebo or active control). 
Assessment report

The primary safety evaluation is derived from the phase III development program which contributed to 
two safety pools; the placebo-controlled (PBO) Pool and the Broad Pool (Table 31). 
The PBO Pool includes pooled safety data for 3 placebo-controlled phase III studies (P003/1022, 
P006/1015, P007/1017) with similar study design, duration of treatment, and baseline characteristics. 
This pool includes data from the 26 week placebo-controlled phase (Phase A) for each study. 
The Broad Pool includes pooled safety data from the 7 phase III studies. This pool includes data 
through completion of study P017/1047 and includes Phase A data and Phase B data up to the LDA 
(last data analysed) date for the other 6 studies. The Phase B periods were ongoing at the time of the 
data cut for pooled analyses. The final results from the ongoing Phase B studies should be submitted 
when data is available.

Safety of metformin 
The  safety  profile  of  metformin  is  well-characterized.  As  reflected  in  the  United  States  Prescribing 
Information (USPI), in a double-blind clinical  study of patients with T2DM  receiving  metformin (up  to 
2550  mg  daily),  the  adverse  reactions  reported  for  ≥5%  of  subjects  on  metformin  and  greater  than 
placebo were diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and 
headache.  Diarrhoea  led  to  discontinuation  of  study  medication  in  6%  of  patients  treated  with 
metformin. 
The  European  Union  SmPC  labels  gastrointestinal  disorders  such  as  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhoea, 
abdominal  pain  and  loss  of  appetite  as  very  common  (>10%)  and  occurring  most  frequently  during 
initiation of therapy and resolving spontaneously in most cases.  Metallic taste was common (3%). 
In  both  the  USPI  and  EU  SmPC,  there  are  a  number  of  warnings  and  precautions  associated  with 
metformin use.  
Lactic  acidosis  is  a  rare,  but  serious,  metabolic  complication  that  can  occur  due  to  metformin 
accumulation during treatment; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases.  The reported 
incidence  of  lactic  acidosis  in  patients  receiving  metformin  hydrochloride  is  very  low  (approximately 
0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years).  
The  following  conditions  and  situations  can  result  in  lactic  acidosis:  impaired  renal  function, 
concomitant medication(s) that may affect renal function, impaired hepatic function, excessive alcohol 
intake,  poorly  controlled  diabetes,  ketosis,  prolonged  fasting,  and  any  condition  associated  with 
hypoxia.    Therefore,  patients  experiencing  these  conditions  should  avoid  taking  metformin.    This 
information is included in the SmPC for Metformin.  
Intravascular  contrast  studies  with  iodinated  materials  can  lead  to  acute  alteration  of  renal  function 
and have been associated with lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin. Hypoxic states, including 
CV  collapse  (shock)  from  whatever  cause,  acute  congestive  heart  failure,  acute  myocardial  infarction 
and  other  conditions  characterized  by  hypoxemia  have  been  associated  with  lactic  acidosis  and  may 
also cause prerenal azotaemia. This is included in the SmPC for Metformin.  
The  use  of  concomitant  medication  that  may  affect  renal  function,  such  as  cationic  drugs  that  are 
eliminated by renal tubular secretion, is a precaution with the use of metformin. Metformin is known to 
be  substantially  excreted  by  the  kidney.  Renal  function  should  be  monitored  before  initiation  of 
metformin therapy and at least annually, as stated in the SmPC of Metformin.

A decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels has been seen in 
patients taking metformin; measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised. 
Metformin therapy should be discontinued in patients having surgical procedures, intravascular 
contrast studies, or experiencing hypoxic states. This is covered in the SmPC of Metformin. 
Safety data for ertugliflozin/metformin combination will be presented and discussed in comparison with 
the safety data of monocomponent ertugliflozin 
Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program 
No Phase III studies have been performed with the ertugliflozin/metformin fixed-dose combination 
(FDC) tablet. The Applicant’s Summary of Clinical Safety (SCS) for ertugliflozin/metformin summarizes 
the safety data from four Phase III clinical studies that assessed the safety and efficacy of ertugliflozin 
when administered in combination with metformin (≥1500 mg/day) to improve glycaemic control in 
adults with T2DM. This SCS presents the results from analyses of a pooled dataset 
(Ertugliflozin/Metformin [Ertu/Met] Pool) derived from the 2 placebo-controlled Phase III studies, 
P006/1015 and P007/1017. In one of the studies, P006/1015, all patients were also co-treated with 
sitagliptin. Additionally, data from 2 active-comparator studies of ertugliflozin in combination with 
metformin, that were not included in the Ertu/Met Pool, are summarized individually in the SCS. Study 
P002/1013 compared treatment with ertugliflozin (5 mg and 15 mg) to the sulphonyl urea glimepiride 
and Study P005/1019 compared co-administration treatment with ertugliflozin (5 mg and 15 mg) and 
sitagliptin (100 mg) to ertugliflozin alone (5 mg and 15 mg) and sitagliptin alone (100 mg) on 
background metformin. It should be kept in mind that the expression "placebo" means that the 
subjects in this group did not take ertugliflozin, but had a background metformin treatment.

Patient exposure 
In total, 3,409 subjects in the phase III studies (Broad Pool) received at least one dose ertugliflozin  
(5 mg or 15 mg) of which 2,575 subjects were exposed for at least 50 weeks.  
A total of 1,083 subjects were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study medication in the two 
studies comprising the Ertu/Met Pool; 721 subjects in the ertugliflozin groups and 362 in the placebo 
groups. 888 and 985 subjects were exposed to ertugliflozin on a background of metformin in Study 
P002/1013 and Study P005/1019, respectively, giving a total of 2,594 ertugliflozin/metformin exposed 
subjects. Total exposure is summarized in Table 33. The Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III 
program includes approximately 75% of the subjects in the Broad pool. Of note, all subjects, both 
ertugliflozin and non-ertugliflozin treated, were on metformin.

In the Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program, the mean durations of exposure were 
similar across the treatment groups ranging from 174 to 178 days in the Ertu/Met pool, from 318 to 
324 days Study P002/1013 and from 167 to 171 days in Study P005/1019. 
Long-term safety data (52 weeks) has been submitted from the phase B of study P005/1019 and 
P006/1015. Submitted follow-up data demonstrated that the overall (phase A and B), mean durations 
of exposure (to any dose) in study P005/1019 were ranged from 325 days in the E15/S100 group to 
335 days in the E5/S100 group. Similar, in study P006/1015 the mean duration of exposure (to any 
dose) ranged from 336 to 337days among the three treatment groups. 
Adverse events 
General overview of AEs 
Ertugliflozin Phase III development program 
The overall incidence of subjects with one or more adverse events was not notably different across the 
ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, and placebo/comparator groups in the PBO Pool and Broad Pool, 
respectively.  In the PBO Pool, about 50% of the patients reported AEs, and in the Broad Pool about 
60% of the patients. Investigator-assessed drug-related AEs were reported more frequently in the 5 
and 15 mg ertugliflozin groups (14.3% and 14.7%, respectively) than in the comparator group (9.3%) 
in the PBO Pool and in the Broad Pool (18.4%, 19.2% and 16.5%, respectively). The frequency of 
SAEs was low in both PBO and Broad Pool (about 3% and 6%, respectively). The discontinuation rates 
due to AEs and SAEs, respectively, were similar across the treatment groups in both the PBO Pool and 
the Broad Pool. 
Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program 
In the Ertu/Met pool and Study P005/1019, about 50% of the subjects reported an AE, whereas in 
Study P002/1013, in which Phase A was 52 weeks as opposed to 26 weeks in the other studies, the 
corresponding number was about 60%.  
The incidence of drug-related adverse events in the Ertu/Met pool was numerically higher in the 
ertugliflozin 5 mg group (11.6%) and higher in ertugliflozin 15 mg (13.1%) relative to the placebo 
group (7.5%). This was primarily due to a numerically increased incidence of adverse events related to 
genital mycotic infections, osmotic diuresis and hypoglycaemia in ertugliflozin-treated subjects. This is 
discussed below under Special Safety Topics. There was an overall low, and not notably different 
incidence, of serious adverse events (2.8-3.6% in all treatment groups) and adverse events resulting 
in discontinuation (1.1-2.2%). There were no deaths in the Ertu/Met Pool during Phase A.

In study P002/1013, the incidence of drug-related AEs was similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group 
(18.3%) relative to the glimepiride group (17.8%) but numerically higher in the ertugliflozin 15 mg 
group (21.6%). The incidence of SAEs was higher in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group (6.3%) and 
numerically higher in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group (3.9%), relative to the glimepiride group (2.7%). 
In study P005/1019, the incidence of drug-related AEs was higher in the E5/S100 (11.1%) and 
E15/S100 (16.0%) groups than in the S100 group (4.9%), but was not notably different from those in 
the E5 (16.8%) and E15 (12.1%) groups. Serious adverse events also occurred at a low incidence 
across groups (<4%) and small numeric differences in the incidence of serious adverse events were 
not due to an increased incidence of any particular serious adverse event term. No deaths were 
reported during Phase A. 
Most frequently reported adverse events 
Ertugliflozin Phase III development program 
In the PBO Pool, the most frequently reported events for ertugliflozin were upper respiratory infection 
(higher frequency in the placebo group), hypoglycaemia (similar frequencies for all groups), headache 
(higher frequencies in the ertugliflozin groups), vulvovaginal mycotic infection (higher frequencies in 
the ertugliflozin groups) and urinary tract infections (higher frequency in the placebo group). 
Of note is the higher incidence of adverse events for ertugliflozin in the SOC Renal and urinary 
disorders and SOC Reproductive system disorders. Events of renal failure/ renal impairment and 
osmotic diuresis-related events and genital infections are further discussed below.  
Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program  
In the Ertu/Met pool, adverse events (AE) in the Infection and infestations SOC were the most 
frequently reported in all groups (E5 17.1%, E15 20.1%, placebo 21.0%). The incidence of AE by SOC 
in the Ertu/Met pool was higher in ertugliflozin-treated subjects relative to subjects in the placebo 
group in two SOC categories: the Renal and urinary disorders SOC and Reproductive system and 
breast disorders SOC. Within the Renal and urinary disorders SOC, the most frequently reported 
adverse events in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups were pollakiuria, polyuria and dysuria. 
Within the Reproductive and breast disorders SOC, the most frequently reported adverse events in the 
ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups were balanoposthitis and vulvovaginal pruritus. Among AEs 
occurring in ≥ 2% of subjects in any group, the only event that occurred at a higher incidence in either 
of the ertugliflozin dose groups or the all ertugliflozin group relative to the placebo group was the 
vulvovaginal mycotic infection (E5 1.9%, E15 2.2%, placebo 0.3%). (Table 34) 
Among adverse events that occurred in ≤2% of subjects in all groups, those that occurred at a higher 
incidence in either of the ertugliflozin dose groups or in the all ertugliflozin group relative to the 
placebo group included several terms related to Special Safety Topics (balanoposthitis, dysuria, 
polyuria, and dry mouth) and 1 term unrelated to any Special Safety Topic (dyspepsia).

In study P005/1019, only comparisons between the ertugliflozin/sitagliptin/metformin groups, and 
ertugliflozin and sitagliptin respectively in combination with metformin were performed. No 
comparisons are provided between the ertugliflozin/metformin and sitagliptin/metformin groups. The 
overall most common adverse reactions in the ertugliflozin/sitagliptin combination groups were 
hypoglycaemia, urinary tract infections, nasopharyngitis and bronchitis. (Table 36)

 MedDRA Version 18.1 
The AEs osmotic diuresis/volume depletion, renal-related events, genital mycotic infections and 
hypoglycaemia are discussed further under Special Safety Topics below.  
In general, long-term safety data from phase A+ B (52 weeks) of study P005/1019 and P006/1015, 
demonstrated the same pattern regarding most frequently reported SOCs (Infections and infestations, 
Metabolism nutrition disorders and Gastro-intestinal disorders) as the 26 weeks data. However, the 
Applicant has been asked to provide pooled 2 years safety data from study P007/1017 and P002/1013 
that further will evaluate long-term safety for ertugliflozin. 
Special Safety Topics 
Osmotic diuresis/volume depletion 
Ertugliflozin Phase III development program 
The incidence of osmotic diuresis-related adverse events was increased in ertugliflozin 5 mg (4.6%) 
and 15 mg (3.3%) groups relative to placebo (1.6%). The most commonly reported symptoms were 
pollakiuria, polyuria, thirst and dry mouth. Most events were mild or moderate in severity and only one 
event led to discontinuation. No serious case was reported.

In the placebo-controlled Pool, the incidence of volume depletion events was low (<2%) and not 
notably different across the ertugliflozin and placebo groups. In the subgroup analyses in the Broad 
Pool, patients with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, patients ≥65 years of age and patients on diuretics had 
a higher incidence of volume depletion in the ertugliflozin groups relative the comparator group.  
In patients with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence of volume depletion events was 5.1%, 2.6% 
and 0.5% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and the comparator group. For patients with eGFR 
45 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence was 6.4%, 3.7% and 0% respectively.  
In patients ≥65 years of age, the incidence of volume depletion was 2.2%, 2.6% and 1.1% for 
ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and the comparator group. For patients using diuretics, the 
incidence was 3.3%, 2.3% and 1.3% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and the comparator 
group, respectively. The incidence was even more increased in patients using loop-diuretics; however, 
the total number of subjects on a loop diuretic was too small (n=197) to draw any firm conclusions.  
Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program  
The was a trend towards an increased incidence of osmotic diuresis-related adverse events in the 
ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups (2.2% and 2.0%, respectively) relative to the placebo group 
(0.6%) in the Ertu/Met pool. However, the only statistically significant difference was an increased 
incidence of polyuria in the ertugliflozin 15 mg (1.1%) group compared to placebo and ertugliflozin 5 
mg (both 0.0%). The incidence of events related to thirst was low, but numerically higher in the 
ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups (0.8% and 0.6%, respectively) compared to the placebo group 
(0.3%). The incidence of volume depletion events was similar across the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg 
groups (both 0.6%) and the placebo group (0.9%). 
In study P002/1013, the incidence of osmotic diuresis-related adverse events of nocturia, pollakiuria, 
and polyuria occurred more frequently in one or both ertugliflozin groups relative to the glimepiride 
group, and for all except nocturia the incidence was numerically higher in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group 
compared with the 5 mg group (Table 35). Two subjects discontinued the study drug due to 
pollakiuria. The incidence of hypovolaemia AEs was numerically higher in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group 
(1.3%) than in the ertugliflozin 15 mg and glimepiride groups (0.7% in both). All hypovolaemia AEs 
were non-serious, and were mild or moderate in intensity, except one event in the ertugliflozin 5 mg 
group, which was severe (syncope). 
In study P005/1019, the incidence of adverse events related to osmotic diuresis was low across groups 
(≤2.1%), without any notable pattern of occurrence in the co-administration groups relative to the 
ertugliflozin alone and sitagliptin alone groups (Table 36). The incidence of dry mouth was 
numerically higher in the ertugliflozin treated subjects than in the sitagliptin group. All events were 
non-serious and mild or moderate in intensity. There were no adverse events related to hypovolemia 
(referred to as volume depletion in the ertugliflozin registration dossier) in the E5/S100 or E15/S100 
groups, or in the S100 group. Four subjects (1.6%) in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group and 2 subjects 
(0.8%) in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group had adverse events related to hypovolaemia. All the events but 
one (syncope) was reported as non-serious and mild or moderate in intensity.  
Genital infections 
Ertugliflozin Phase III development program 
The incidence of genital infections in female subjects was highly increased in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 
15 mg group (9.1% and 12.2%, respectively) as compared to placebo (3.0%) with a notable dose-
dependent relation. Vulvovaginal candidiasis and vulvovaginal mycotic infection were the most 
commonly reported events.  Most of the events were mild or moderate and no serious case was 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018

reported. Recurrent events were reported in 26% (14/53) of the female patients experiencing a genital 
infection.  
The incidence of genital infections was highly increased also in males. However, the absolute numbers 
lower than in females; ertugliflozin 5 mg (3.7%), ertugliflozin 15 mg (4.2%) and placebo (0.4%) and 
no dose-response relation. Balanoposthitis was the most commonly reported event. All events were 
mild or moderate in intensity and no event was serious.  
Two (10%) of the male patients experienced a recurrent event of genital infection. In ertugliflozin-
treated subjects, events of genital mycotic infections were more frequent in men who were not 
circumcised at baseline (5.2%) relative to those who were circumcised (1.9%). 
An expanded CMQ search, including additional less specific terms for genital mycotic infection, was 
performed in both the PBO and Broad Pool. Using the expanded CMQ in the PBO Pool, 2 events were 
serious (cellulitis of the male genital organ in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group and phimosis in the 
ertugliflozin 15 mg group). In the Broad Pool, the most commonly reported event in the extended 
search was phimosis, reported in 8 (0.5%) subjects in the all ertugliflozin group and in one subject 
(0.1%) in the comparator group. Among the 8 phimosis events in ertugliflozin-treated subjects, 2 were 
serious and in 4 cases were the subjects treated with circumcision. One more serious case 
(balanoposthitis) was reported in the Broad Pool.  
Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program  
In all Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program, there was a significantly greater incidence 
of genital mycotic infections in male and female ertugliflozin-treated subjects. In males, the incidence 
ranged from 2.1-4.7% in ertugliflozin treated subjects relative to 0% in the non-ertugliflozin group. In 
females, the incidence ranged from 4.9-10.0% in ertugliflozin treated subjects relative to 1.1-1.4% in 
the non-ertugliflozin group. 
Among males, but not females, complicated infections were more common in the ertugliflozin 15 mg 
group (1.1/0% in males/females) than in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (0.2/0.3% in males/ females) and the 
non-ertugliflozin groups (0/0.2% in males/ females) in the Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin program. 
Urinary tract infections 
Ertugliflozin Phase III development program 
The incidence of UTI was not notably different in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups (4.0% and 
4.1%) and placebo group (3.9%). Most of the events were mild or moderate and no serious case was 
reported.  
In the Broad Pool, the incidence of UTI in the comparator group (7.9%) was slightly higher compared 
to the ertugliflozin 5 mg (6.9%) and 15 mg (7.0%) groups. The incidence of serious events was low in 
all groups (≤0.4%). 
Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program 
In the Ertu/Met pool, the incidence of urinary tract infections was significantly higher in the ertugliflozin 
15 mg group (4.2%) and numerically higher in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group (2.8%) compared to the 
placebo group (1.7%), as opposed to the Ertugliflozin Phase III development program. This is 
considered as random variability. 
Also in study P005/1019, there was a numerically higher incidence of UTI in the E5 and E15 groups 
(6.0% and 5.6%, respectively) relative to the E5/S100 and E15/S100 groups (3.3% and 3.7%, 
respectively) and the S100 group (3.2%). The incidence of UTI in study P002/1013 was similar across 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 123/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg treatment groups (6.7% and 6.4%, respectively) and the glimepiride 
group (6.9%). 
Hypoglycaemia 
Ertugliflozin Phase III development program 
In the placebo-controlled Pool, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was relatively low, although increased 
for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg (5.0% and 4.5%) compared to placebo (2.9%). When ertugliflozin 
was used as monotherapy, there was a small, not dose-dependent, increase in hypoglycaemic events 
in the ertugliflozin groups (2.6% in both groups) as compared to placebo (0.7%). The increased risk of 
hypoglycaemia compared to placebo should be reflected in the SmPC. 
In study P001/1016 in patients with moderate renal impairment, there was a higher incidence of 
hypoglycaemia relative to the other phase III studies. This was expected given the high rate (90%) of 
insulin and/or insulin secretagogues as background therapy in this study.  The incidence of 
documented hypoglycaemia AEs was higher for E5 group (34.2%) compared to E15 group (25.2%) in 
study P001/1016. Furthermore, the incidence of documented hypoglycaemia was higher for E5 group 
(compared to E15) in CKD-3A stratum (eGFR ≥45 to <60 mL/min/1.73m2) in subjects taking 
background medication of insulin and/ or insulin secretagogue.  
Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program  
An increased risk of hypoglycaemic events was noted for ertugliflozin 5 mg (7.2%) and ertugliflozin 15 
mg (7.8%) relative to placebo (4.3%) when ertugliflozin was used as add-on to metformin (study 
P007/1017). About half of the events across the groups were events of symptomatic hypoglycaemia. 
When used as add-on to metformin and sitagliptin (P006/1015), the incidence of hypoglycaemic events 
was higher in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group (4.5%) but lower in the ertugliflozin 15 mg (2.0%) 
compared to placebo (3.3%). In the factorial study (P005/1019) where ertugliflozin and sitagliptin 
were co-initiated, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was higher in both ertugliflozin groups (5.6% and 
5.2% for 5 mg and 15 mg, respectively) and the ertugliflozin + sitagliptin groups (5.3% and 9.0% for 
E5/S100 and E15/S100, respectively) relative to the sitagliptin group (3.6%). 
When ertugliflozin was used add-on to metformin and compared to the sulphonyl urea product 
glimepiride (Study P002/1013), the incidence of hypoglycaemia was markedly lower in the ertugliflozin 
groups (6-8%) relative to the glimepiride group (27%).  
Changes in renal function 
Ertugliflozin Phase III development program 
In the placebo-controlled pool, treatment with ertugliflozin was associated with small decreases in 
eGFR that returned to or towards baseline at week 26. Also in a longer-term study (P002/1013), eGFR 
in both ertugliflozin dose groups was above baseline between week 26 and 52. Mean changes from 
baseline in BUN was higher in the ertugliflozin groups relative to the placebo group at week 26.  
However, this is not considered to reflect impairment in renal function. The same phenomenon has 
been seen with other medicinal products in the class, but the explanation has so far been elusive. 
 The incidence of renal-related events (renal impairment/renal failure) was low and similar across the 
ertugliflozin groups and placebo. In the PBO Pool, there were two cases of non-serious renal failure in 
the ertugliflozin group and no case of renal failure in the placebo group. In the Broad Pool, there was a 
slight imbalance between ertugliflozin and comparator in renal-related events (0.6% in ertugliflozin 5 
mg, 0.8% in ertugliflozin 15 mg and 0.4% in the comparator group).  
Assessment report

In ertugliflozin treated subjects with moderate renal impairment, the decrease in eGFR was slightly 
larger than in the PBO Pool (about 1 mL/min/1.73 m2 more) and did not return to baseline at week 26; 
however, reversed after treatment discontinuation (Figure 9). In Study P001/1016, the incidence of 
renal-related events was higher for ertugliflozin (2.5% and 1.3% for 5 mg and 15 mg ertugliflozin, 
respectively) relative to placebo (0.6%).  
Figure 9: eGFR (mL/min/1.73m2): Mean Change from Baseline Over Time (Mean ± SE) All 
Subjects as Treated study P001/1016: Including Rescue Approach 
Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program  
As in the ertugliflozin phase III development program, a small decrease in eGFR that returned to or 
towards baseline at week 26 was seen in the Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program. A 
small additive effect of sitagliptin was seen when combined with ertugliflozin on renal function was 
noted in study P005/1019. Results from phase B (week 52) of study P005/1019 demonstrated 
generally similar eGFR results to those observed at Week 26, except for the E15/S100 group which 
demonstrated a further decrease in eGFR at week 52 compared to week 26. However, an analysis was 
performed in subjects who had eGFR measurements at baseline, on-treatment, and at least 7 days 
after the last dose of study medication. Even if the number of patients in each group are few (below 
20), these data demonstrates a reversibility in eGFR values post treatment in both E5/S100 and 
E15/S100 groups. 
In the Ertu/Met pool, the proportion of subjects who had any occurrence of a decrease in eGFR of 
>30% from baseline was not notably different in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups (3.1% and 
3.7%, respectively) relative to the placebo group (3.4%).   
The incidence of renal-related events not including adverse events related to decreased eGFR or 
increased creatinine was low and similar across the ertugliflozin 5 mg (2 subjects; 0.6%) and 15 mg 
groups (1 subject; 0.3%), and the placebo group (1 subject; 0.3%). None of the events was serious or

led to discontinuation. Adverse events related to decreased eGFR and increased creatinine were 
infrequent, each being reported in ≤1 subject per group. 
In study P002/1013, the incidences of renal-related AEs were not meaningfully different across the 3 
groups. However, renal-related SAEs and renal-related AEs leading to study medication discontinuation 
were only observed in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group. The proportions of subjects who had at least 1 
decrease in eGFR >30% from baseline were similar across the 3 treatment groups (3.7%, 4.7%, and 
4.9% in the ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, and glimepiride groups, respectively). The number 
of subjects with one or more AEs of eGFR decreased or blood creatinine increased was 3 (0.7%), 7 
(1.6%), and 2 (0.5%) in the ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, and glimepiride groups, 
respectively. The eGFR/serum creatinine values for 3 subjects, all in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group, did 
not return to baseline levels as of the last available measurement or after discontinuing study 
medication. Adverse events suggestive of acute or chronic renal dysfunction, including acute kidney 
injury, chronic kidney disease, renal impairment, nephropathy, or diabetic nephropathy were reported 
for 1 (0.2%), 4 (0.9%), and 3 (0.7%) subjects in the ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, and 
glimepiride groups, respectively.  
The proportion of subjects with at least 1 decrease in eGFR >30% from baseline in study P005/1019 
was 5.9% in the E5/S100 group, 3.8% in the E15/S100, 2.8% in the E5 group, 4.1% in the E15 group 
and 2.9% in the subjects in the S100 group. An adverse event of eGFR decreased or blood creatinine 
increased was reported for: 5 (2.1%) and 4 (1.6%) subjects in the E5/S100 and E15/S100 groups, 
respectively; 4 (1.6%) and 7 (2.8%) subjects in the E5 and E15 groups, respectively; and 4 subjects 
(1.6%) in the S100 group during phase A + B. None of these events was severe or serious.  
An adverse event of acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, renal impairment, or nephropathy 
was reported for 1.6% and 1.2% of the subjects in the E5/S100 and E15/S100 groups, respectively vs 
0.8% in both the E5 and E15 group. One subject in the S100 group reported a renal-related event. All 
of these AEs were considered to be mild in intensity by the investigator except for one SAE of acute 
kidney injury (in S100 group) and a non-serious AE of acute kidney injury (E5 group) during the phase 
A+ phase B. In total, in study P005/1019 (phase A and B), eight renal related AEs led to 
discontinuation (three in group E15/S100, two in E5, one in E15 and  two in S100 group). 
The Applicant has provided data showing that the renal function did not deteriorate further over time in 
the subset of subjects with baseline eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the four studies with ertugliflozin in 
combination with metformin.  
In the Ertu/met pool, no subjects with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 reported any volume depletion- or 
renal-related adverse events. In both Studies P002/1013 and P005/1019, volume depletion- and/or 
renal-related adverse events were reported in subjects with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. However, 
there were too few renal-related or volume depletion adverse events in this category (0-1 subjects per 
group) to be able to draw any meaningful conclusions.

Hepatic events 
Ertugliflozin Phase III development program 
In the placebo-controlled Pool, there were decreases in ALT and AST in the both ertugliflozin groups 
relative placebo, persistent to week 26.  
In the Broad Pool, the percentages of subjects with increases in ALT or AST that met a PDLC ≥3XULN 
were similar (0.8-1.3% across all groups for ALT; 0.3-0.6% across the groups for AST).  The 
proportion of subjects with increases in ALT or AST that met a PDLC >5X ULN was low (0.1-0.2% 
across all groups). No ertugliflozin-treated subject met the definition for Hy’s law case.   
Of the 6 ertugliflozin-treated subjects with an event adjudicated as possibly related to study 
medication, 2 subjects were using paracetamol, 1 subject was hepatitis C positive and 2 subjects’ 
events resolved on treatment; the last case resolved following interruption of study medication. No 
cases were adjudicated as very likely or probable.  
Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program  
Like in the Ertugliflozin Phase III development program, there were decreases in ALT and AST in the 
both ertugliflozin groups relative placebo persistent to week 26. There were no significant differences 
in the proportion of subjects meeting PDLC criteria between treatment groups in the studies.  
Out of the total of 11 subjects in the Broad Pool meeting the criteria for hepatic adjudication, 6 of were 
in the Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program (2 in the non-ertugliflozin group, 1 in the 
ertugliflozin 5 mg group and 3 in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group). One of the events was adjudicated 
“doubtful”, the others “possible”. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Ertugliflozin Phase III development program 
In the Broad Pool, ertugliflozin treatment did not result in a higher incidence of hypersensitivity 
reactions relative to the comparator group. The incidence of potential hypersensitivity events from the 
hypersensitivity SMQ was low and similar in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups (3.3% and 2.4%, 
respectively) and the comparator group (2.5%). There have been no serious events of hypersensitivity 
reactions, anaphylactic reactions or serious skin reactions reported for ertugliflozin. One case in the 
comparator group, an event of angioedema, was serious.  
In the PBO Pool, ertugliflozin did not result in a higher incidence of hypersensitivity reactions relative 
placebo. The incidence of hypersensitivity events from the hypersensitivity SMQ was low and similar in 
the ertugliflozin 5 mg (2.1%) and 15 mg (1.4%) and the placebo (1.9%) group. No serious adverse 
events were reported in any group. 
Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program  
Hypersensitivity reactions were not evaluated in the Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III 
program.  
One subject in study P005/1019 (in the E15/S100 group) reported a non-serious, moderate adverse 
event of dermatitis allergic on Day 105, reported as not related to study medication by the 
investigator. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin 
conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, are included in labelling of sitagliptin based upon 
post-marketing reports.

Bone safety/ fractures 
Ertugliflozin Phase III development program 
Long-term data regarding fractures was received from the Broad Pool. The cumulative incidence of 
adjudicated confirmed fractures at week 104 was similar across the groups; 0.9% (n=15) for 
ertugliflozin 5 mg, 0.6% (n=11) for ertugliflozin 15 mg and 0.8% (n=12) for the comparator group.  
In one placebo-controlled study (P007/1017; included in Ertu/Met pool), ertugliflozin had no impact on 
bone mineral density during the 26-week treatment period. Interim 52-week BMD data in study 
P007/1017 was provided for the overall study population and the subgroup of post-menopausal women 
(approximately 38% of the overall). At week 52, there were small changes in BMD in all treatment 
groups across the anatomical sites in both populations. The decrease in BMD was in general slightly 
greater in the subgroup of post-menopausal women relative to the overall study population. However, 
the BMD change from baseline was not consistent regarding magnitude and dose relationship and, 
moreover, was nominally statistically significant only for the ‘total hip’ data in the ertugliflozin 15 mg 
group in the overall study population of study P007/1017. The 104 week data was also statistically 
significant only for the ‘total hip’ data in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group.    
Changes in serum phosphate (6.8% and 8.5% vs. 1.9%) and magnesium (7.8% and 9.9% vs. -0.9%) 
but no change in serum calcium were seen with ertugliflozin treatment (5 mg and 15 mg) in the 
placebo-controlled Pool. In study P007/1017, there was a dose-dependent increase from baseline to 
week 26 in the bone resorption marker CTX for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg (29% and 38%, 
respectively) relative to placebo (10%), and a non-dose-dependent increase in PTH (6.8% and 6.9% 
vs. 1.1% for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg vs. placebo). The proportion of subjects meeting the PDLC 
(pre-defined limits of change) criterion PTH increase ≥30% (regardless of whether above the ULN) was 
higher in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group (21%) and 15 mg group (21%) relative to the placebo group 
(13%). The bone formation marker P1NP increased two times more in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group 
(15%) compared to ertugliflozin 5 mg group (7.5%) but increased even more in the placebo group 
(19%).  
In study P007/1017, a subgroup analysis at week 26 in pre- versus postmenopausal women did not 
indicate any difference regarding ertugliflozin effect on CTX. The mean percent change from baseline in 
CTX was greater in both ertugliflozin groups relative placebo in all 4 subgroups: males, pre-, peri- and 
postmenopausal women, with a dose-dependent increase in all groups except the male group. A 
subgroup analysis in subjects with and without osteopenia at baseline did not demonstrate any 
clinically significant differences in mean percent changes at week 26 in BMD, CTX, P1NP and PTH 
between the groups. In moderately renal impaired patients, the event rate of fractures was too low for 
meaningful conclusions.  
Changes in serum phosphate (9.7 and 7.8% vs. 0.8%) and magnesium (11% and 11% vs. 0.4%) for 
ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg vs. placebo, but no meaningful change in calcium, were noted in this 
patient group. PTH increased 27% in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group and increased similarly in the 
ertugliflozin 15 mg group (12%) and the placebo group (11%). CTX increased in the ertugliflozin 
groups (33% and 34%) relative placebo (9.6%); although not dose-dependent. P1NP increase was 
higher in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group (41%) and numerically higher in the placebo group (33%) 
relative to the ertugliflozin 15 mg group (19%).  
Data on bone markers was provided at week 52 in study P001/1016 and P007/1017 and at week 104 
in study P007/1017. The bone resorption marker CTX was more increased in the ertugliflozin groups 
than in the placebo/comparator group at week 26, 52 and 104; although the difference to the 
comparator group was less pronounced at week 104. The bone formation marker P1NP was increased

in both the ertugliflozin and the comparator groups. The clinical implication of the observed changes in 
the bone markers is not clear. 
Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program  
In all studies, small increases were seen in phosphate and magnesium in ertugliflozin treated subjects 
relative to placebo. There was no meaningful change in calcium in the ertugliflozin or the placebo 
groups in the Ertu/Met pool, neither in study P002/1013. In study P005/1019, there was a higher 
proportion of subjects who had a last on-treatment increase in calcium ≥1.0 mg/dL and value >ULN in 
the E15/S100 group than in the S100 group. Adverse events of hypercalcaemia were reported for 1 
subject in the E5 group and 1 subject in the E15 group. Both AEs were mild in intensity, one was 
considered to be related to study medication, and neither resulted in discontinuation. 
Overall, 13 (0.4%) subjects in the Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program had an event of 
fracture that was sent for adjudication: 3 subjects in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, 6 in the ertugliflozin 
15 mg group and 4 in the non-ertugliflozin group. 
Lower limb amputations 
Ertugliflozin Phase III development program 
In the Broad Pool, there were 10 subjects with non-traumatic limb amputations (all post-randomization 
treatment analysis): 1 of 1,450 (0.1%) in the non-ertugliflozin group, 1 of 1,716 (0.1%) in the 
ertugliflozin 5 mg group and 8 of 1,693 (0.5%) in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group (resulting in 9 of 3,409 
(0.3%) in the all ertugliflozin group).  Among these cases, the most frequently reported amputation 
was toe amputation.  One subject in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group underwent 2 amputation procedures 
(left second toe and left third toe amputations).   
The absolute numbers of toe amputation was low, wherefore it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions 
from the data. Moreover, baseline history revealed risk factors such as peripheral neuropathy, 
peripheral artery disease (including one subject with a pre-existing peripheral artery aneurysm), 
diabetic foot, or former/current smoking to be present in all subjects.  Associated adverse events 
included those related to limb infection, peripheral artery disease, and gangrene. 
Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program  
6 of the 10 subjects with non-traumatic limb amputations were from the Ertugliflozin add-on to 
Metformin Phase III program: 1 of 1,046 (0.1%) in the non-ertugliflozin group, 1 of 1,304 (<0.1%) in 
the ertugliflozin 5 mg group and 4 of 1,290 (0.8%) in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group (resulting in 5 of 
2,594 (0.2%) in the all ertugliflozin group).  
Ketoacidosis 
Ertugliflozin Phase III development program 
In the Broad Pool, three (0.1%) ertugliflozin-treated subjects were assessed to have met the case 
definition of ketoacidosis with either certain or possible likelihood compared to no cases in the 
comparator group. The rest of the cases were either determined unlikely to represent ketoacidosis (20 
cases) or were unclassifiable (2 cases). All events of ketoacidosis resolved, two after discontinuation of 
study medication and one resolved on treatment. 
Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program  
All three cases in the Ertugliflozin Phase III development program which were assessed to have met 
the case definition of ketoacidosis with either certain or possible likelihood were ertugliflozin add-on to

metformin treated subjects. The Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program includes 
approximately 75% of the subjects in the Broad pool. 
Serum lipids 
A small increase in LDL-C, HDL-C and total cholesterol was noted in week 26, similar as what has been 
seen with other SGLT-2 inhibitors. Mean percent changes from baseline at week 26 for ertugliflozin 5 
mg and 15 mg versus placebo, respectively, were: LDL-cholesterol 5.8% and 8.4% versus 3.2%; HDL-
cholesterol 6.2% and 7.6% versus 1.2%; total cholesterol 2.8% and 5.7% versus 1.1 % and 
triglycerides -3.9 % and -1.7% versus 4.5%.  
LDL-C/HDL-C-ratio was evaluated in study P003/1022 and study P007/1017. In study P003/1022, 
there were small changes in LDL-C/HDL-C-ratio over time and no relevant differences between the 
groups.  LDL-C/HDL-C ratio will be assessed in the ongoing study P007/1017 at completion.  
The results in the Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program were not notably different from 
the Ertugliflozin Phase III development program.  
Malignancy 
There was an imbalance in the SOC Neoplasms for ertugliflozin (0.6% and 1.2% for ertugliflozin 5 mg 
and 15 mg respectively) relative comparator (0.3%).  
Further analysis, to identify subjects reporting a malignancy with onset greater than 6 months after 
the first dose of study medication, did show an increased incidence in the ertugliflozin group 15 mg 
(0.9%) in comparison to ertugliflozin 5 mg (0.3%) and comparator (0.4%).  Malignancies reported in 
more than one subject in the ertugliflozin groups were 2 cases of breast cancer/ invasive ductal breast 
cancer, 2 cases of malignant melanoma and 2 cases of basal cell carcinoma.  The 2 events of 
pancreatic neoplasm and pancreatic carcinoma were erroneously reported by the investigator for the 
same malignancy in one subject.  
Malignancies in ertugliflozin treated subjects on metformin have not been evaluated specifically. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Ertugliflozin Phase III development program 
A total of 26 deaths occurred in the phase III studies, of which 6 (0.4%) in the comparator group and 
in total 20 (0.6%) deaths in the ertugliflozin groups.  
The most frequently reported AEs with fatal outcome (15/26) were in the SOC Cardiac disorders (n=7) 
and in the SOC General disorders (n=8), including sudden death, sudden cardiac death and multiple 
organ dysfunction syndrome. The remaining deaths (n=11) were distributed among different SOCs. 
None of the fatal cases were considered related to the treatment by the investigator; however one 
case had no information on causality assessment from the investigator.  
Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program  
No deaths occurred in the phase A treatment period of studies P005/1019, P006/1015 and P007/1017. 
There were four fatal events in phase B: one in study P006/1015 (meningitis tuberculous) in non-
ertugliflozin group, one in study P007/1017 (plasma cell myeloma) in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group and 
two in study P005/1019 (pancreatic carcinoma; ischaemic stroke) in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 130/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In study P002/1013, there were five (1.1%) fatal events in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, one (0.2%) in 
the ertugliflozin 15 mg group, and none in the glimepiride group. One subject in the glimepiride group 
experienced a fatal event in the post-treatment period. Moreover, there were three fatal events in 
Phase B. The causes of death in Phase A in ertugliflozin treated subjects were sudden cardiac death 
(two subjects), multiple organ failure after car accident, suicide (depression after stroke) and 
exacerbation of COPD. 
In summary, Of the 26 fatal events in the ertugliflozin phase III studies, 6 events were reported from 
the add-on to metformin studies, all from ertugliflozin treated patients in study P002/1013, giving an 
incidence of deaths of 0.2% in the Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin program in whole and 0.5% in 
study P002/1013. Phase A of study P002/1013 was 52 weeks, as opposed to 26 weeks in the other 
studies of the Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin program. 
Non-fatal serious adverse events 
Ertugliflozin Phase III development program 
Non-fatal SAEs were most frequently reported in the SOC Infections and infestations (no imbalance 
between ertugliflozin and comparator group) and the SOC Cardiac disorders (slightly higher incidences 
in the ertugliflozin groups [1.3%] vs. comparator [0.9%]), of which angina pectoris was the most 
commonly reported event. Data supporting an assessment of CV safety profile is very limited with only 
few cases in each treatment group. There is a numerical imbalance between ertugliflozin and placebo, 
but no conclusion can be drawn. However, considering the known mechanism of action and experience 
from other products in the class, it is acceptable to provide data from the CV outcome study after a 
potential approval. 
Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program  
The incidence of non-fatal serious adverse events in the Ertu/Met Pool was low and similar in the 
ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg (both 2.8%) and placebo groups (3.6%). 
Non-fatal serious adverse events occurred across multiple SOCs with no obvious event pattern. Only 1 
specific adverse event preferred term (acute myocardial infarction) occurred in more than 1 subject in 
any group (2 subjects in the placebo group). The PTs acute myocardial infarction and angina pectoris 
both occurred in 1 subject in the E5 group, and the PT myocardial ischaemia occurred once in the E15 
group. 
The incidence of SAEs in study P002/1013 was higher in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group (6.3%) and 
numerically higher in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group (3.9%), relative to the glimepiride group (2.7%).  
Across the 3 treatment groups, SAEs were distributed across multiple SOCs, and only 2 SAEs occurred 
in >1 subject in a treatment group, including pneumonia (2 subjects in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group 
and 1 in the glimepiride group) and cerebrovascular accident (2 subjects in the ertugliflozin 5 mg 
group and 1 in the glimepiride group). 
The incidence of SAEs in the Cardiac disorders SOC was numerically higher in the ertugliflozin groups 
(3 subjects in each group) than in the glimepiride group (1 subject). The incidence of SAEs in the 
Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified SOC was numerically higher in the ertugliflozin groups 
(five subjects in each group; 1.1%) than in the glimepiride group (1 subject; 0.2%). Of the 10 SAEs in 
the ertugliflozin groups, 3 were benign (1 AE of ovarian adenoma and 2 AEs of uterine leiomyoma). For 
the malignant neoplasms, there was no pattern of specific tumour types. 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 131/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In study P005/1019, the incidence of SAEs was numerically higher in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (3.2%) and 
E5/S100 (2.5%) groups compared to the other treatment groups (1.2-1.6%). The incidence of SAEs in 
SOC Cardiac disorders was similar in ertugliflozin treated (0.6%) relative to non-ertugliflozin treated 
(0.4%) subjects. There was one SAE in the E5/S100 group in the SOC Neoplasms. In the SOC 
Gastrointestinal disorders, there were 3 events (1.2%) in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group relative to 0 in 
the remaining treatment groups. The only serious adverse event that occurred in >1 subject in a 
treatment group was acute myocardial infarction, which occurred in 2 subjects (0.8%) in the E15/S100 
group. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Ertugliflozin Phase III development program 
In the placebo-controlled Pool, slight increases from baseline to week 26 in haemoglobin concentration 
was observed in the 5 mg and 15 mg ertugliflozin groups (3.5% in both groups) compared to a 
decrease in the placebo group (-1.4%). The observed increases in haemoglobin/haematocrit are 
considered related to volume depletion associated with the diuretic effect of ertugliflozin, as for other 
SGLT-2 inhibitors.  
The results in the Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program do not differ in a meaningful 
way from the Ertugliflozin Phase III development program. 
Potassium 
Ertugliflozin Phase III development program 
In the Broad Pool, the proportion of subjects having any occurrence of an increase in potassium 
meeting PDLC increase criterion ≥1.0 mEq/L and value >ULN, were similar for ertugliflozin and 
comparator group (8-9%). Subjects meeting PDLC criteria of >5.4 mEq/L and 15% above baseline, 
were 7.7% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, 8.9% for ertugliflozin 15 mg and 7.1% for comparator. 
In patients with moderate renal impairment, subjects meeting the PDLC criteria ≥1.0 mEq/L and value 
>ULN, were seen slightly more often in subjects treated with ertugliflozin (11% for both groups) than 
with placebo 8.6%. Incidences of elevated serum potassium meeting the PDLC criteria >5.4 mEq/L and 
15% above baseline, were seen in 12% subjects treated with ertugliflozin 5 mg, 10% subjects treated 
with ertugliflozin 15 mg, and 7.9% subjects treated with placebo in a none dose-dependent manner.  
Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program  
The mean change in potassium levels from baseline was not different in ertugliflozin treated subjects 
(-0.03 and -0.04 mEq/L respectively) compared to placebo (-0.05 mEq/L) in the Ertu/Met pool, and the 
proportion of subjects meeting a PDLC criterion was similar in all groups. 
Similarly, there were no notable changes from baseline potassium in any treatment group in the 2 
active-comparator studies (P002/1013: all ertugliflozin -0.01-0.0 mEq/L vs glimepiride 0.00 mEq/L and 
P005/1019: all ertugliflozin 0.00-0.005 mEq/L vs sitagliptin 0.00 mEq/L), neither any meaningful 
difference between treatment groups in the proportion of patients meeting PDLC criteria for potassium. 
In study P005/1019, there was one SAE with decreased potassium.  
Uric acid 
Ertugliflozin Phase III development program 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 132/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the placebo-controlled studies, modest decreases (-7.7% and -6.3%) from baseline in serum uric 
acid was observed at week 26 in the 5 mg and 15 mg ertugliflozin groups compared to an increase in 
the placebo group (3.2%). Decreases in uric acid levels could be secondary to increased secretion of 
uric acid in the urine, with an increased risk for nephrolithiasis as a possible consequence. However, 
the incidence of urolithiasis and nephrolithiasis was similar across the groups in the Broad Pool. Urinary 
uric acid was not measured in the clinical program. 
Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program  
As in the ertugliflozin phase III development program, there were modest decreases from baseline in 
uric acid was observed at week 26 in the 5 mg and 15 mg ertugliflozin groups compared to an increase 
in the placebo group in the Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program. No confidence interval 
or P-values were provided. 
Blood pressure/pulse rate 
Ertugliflozin Phase III development program 
A clear, but not dose-dependent, decrease in blood pressure was observed with ertugliflozin (mean 
changes of -4.8 mmHg in SBP with ertugliflozin). This is consistent with the known osmotic diuretic 
effect of ertugliflozin. No clinically relevant mean change from baseline in pulse rate was observed. 
Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program  
A statistically and clinically relevant reduction from baseline in sitting SBP was observed with 
ertugliflozin 15 mg and 5 mg across the phase III studies regardless of between-study differences in 
background medication and study designs. This is further discussed in section 2.5.2 under Results, as 
sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure were secondary efficacy endpoints in the Ertugliflozin add-
on to Metformin Phase III program. 
There was no statistically significant increase in orthostatic blood pressure change between groups.  
Safety in special populations 
Ertugliflozin Phase III development program 
Elderly 
Age-delineated data was provided for age groups:  <65 y (n=3,605), 65-74 y (n=1,035), 75-85 y 
(n=211) and 85+y (n=8). There is rather limited data for subjects  75-85 years and too limited data 
for subjects ≥85 years of age, wherefore no meaningful conclusions could be drawn in this age group 
(n=8).   
Subjects ≥ 75 of age are in general likely more prone to adverse events, such as volume depletion and 
renal impairment, due to frequent use of concomitant medication and baseline impaired renal function.  
In the Broad Pool, in the age group <65’, 65-74’ and 75-84’, the mean eGFR was 90, 73-75 and 60-66 
mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. Within each age groups the mean eGFR was similar across the 
treatment groups, except in the age group 75-84’ in which the mean eGFR was slightly higher (66 
mL/min/1.73 m2) in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group compared to the ertugliflozin 15 mg group (61 
mL/min/1.73 m2) and the comparator group (60 mL/min/1.73 m2). Also the median eGFR was higher 
in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group compared to the other treatment groups in the age group 75-84’. 
Among subjects ≥ 65 years of age, but not in younger subjects, the incidence of volume depletion 
events was numerically higher in both ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg (2.2% and 2.6% respectively) 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 133/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
relative to the comparator group (1.1%). The incidence of volume depletion was 1.6%, 3.1% and 
1.0% in the age group 65-74’ and 5.7%, 0% and 1.5% in the age group 75-85’ for ertugliflozin 5 mg, 
ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo, respectively. 
In subjects ≥ 65 years of age, renal-related events were more common in ertugliflozin groups (1.3% 
and 1.4%; for 5 mg and 15 mg ertugliflozin, respectively) than in the comparator group (0.5%) in 
subjects ≥ 65 years of age. The incidence of renal-related events was 1.6%, 0.9% and 0% in the age 
group 65-74’ and 0%, 4% and 0% in the age group 75-85’ for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg 
and comparator group, respectively. 
A similar increase in genital mycotic infections (both male and female) in ertugliflozin-treated subjects, 
as seen in the overall population, was seen in both subjects <65 years and ≥ 65 years. The incidence 
of female genital infections was 3.7%, 2.9% and 1.0% in the age group 65-74’ and 2.9%, 4.0% and 
0% in the age group 75-85’ for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and the comparator group, 
respectively. The incidence of male genital infections was 1.9%, 1.1% and 0% in the age group 65-74’ 
and 1.4%, 1.3% and 0% in the age group 75-85’ for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and 
comparator group, respectively. 
Use of ACE/ARB was similar across the treatment groups and between the age group 65-74’ (69-75%) 
and the age group 75-84’ (70-76%) and as expected less in the age group <65’ (53-57%). Use of 
diuretics was similar across the treatment groups in the age group 65-74’ (38-39%). However, in the 
age group 75-84’, the use of diuretics was less common in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group (29%) 
compared to ertugliflozin 15 mg group (47%) and the comparator group (45%). The total number of 
subjects on a loop diuretic was overall too small (n=197) to draw any firm conclusions. 
Gender 
Adverse events were in general more common in females (66-69%) than males (57-62%) across the 
groups. The proportion of patients who had a genital infection was higher (about 2-fold or more) for 
women than for men, irrespective of the treatment group. UTI was also more common in females 
compared to men. 
Race/ Ethnicity 
The overall frequency of adverse events across the treatment groups was comparable for White, Black 
and Asian (58-66%); however slightly higher in the group ‘Other’ (73-80%). The overall frequency of 
adverse events across the groups was slightly lower for patients of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (59-60%) 
than for patients who were not of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (63-66%) 
Renal impairment 
Volume depletion 
The incidence of volume depletion was highly increased in ertugliflozin treated subjects with an eGFR 
45-<60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (6.4% ertugliflozin 5 mg and 3.7% ertugliflozin vs. 0% non-ertugliflozin).  
In the moderate renal impairment study, which made up a large portion of the subjects with eGFR 
45-<60 mL/min/1.73 m2 subgroup (159 of 173), the incidence of volume depletion was significantly 
higher in the ertugliflozin groups (4.4% and 1.9% in ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg, respectively) 
compared to placebo (0%) 
Genital infections 
Among ertugliflozin-treated subjects, a similar increase in genital infections (male and female) as seen 
in the overall population was seen in subjects with eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2. In subjects with eGFR 
<60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the imbalance was numerically smaller. 
Renal-related events 
In ertugliflozin treated subjects with moderate renal impairment, the decrease in eGFR was about 1 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 134/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mL/min/1.73 m2 larger than in the PBO Pool, and did not return to baseline at week 26; however, 
reversed after treatment discontinuation.  
The incidence of renal-related events in moderate renal impaired subjects was higher for ertugliflozin 
(2.5% and 1.3% for 5 mg and 15 mg ertugliflozin, respectively) than for placebo (0.6%).  
In subjects with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the broader pool, containing all phase III studies 
(including subjects from the moderate renal impairment study), renal-related events were more 
frequent in the ertugliflozin groups relative to the comparator and markedly more frequent in subjects 
with an eGFR <45mL/min/1.73 m2 (n=173). However, there was no notable differences across the 
groups in the incidence of renal-related events in subjects with eGFR 45-<60 mL/min/1.73 m2 
(n=402). 
Fractures 
In moderate renal impaired patients, the event rate of fractures was too low for meaningful 
conclusions. Similar changes were noted in serum phosphate and magnesium as in the pool with 
placebo-controlled studies.  No meaningful change in calcium was seen. 
PTH increased 27% in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group and increased similarly in the ertugliflozin 15 mg 
(12%) group and the placebo group (11%). A similar change in CTX as for study P007/1017 was seen 
in the ertugliflozin group 5 mg and 15 mg (33% and 34%) relative to placebo (9.6%). P1NP increase 
was higher in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group (41%) and numerically higher in the placebo group (33%) 
relative to the ertugliflozin 15 mg group (19%). At week 52, CTX increased from baseline more in the 
ertugliflozin groups (30% and 40% for ertugliflozin 5mg and 15mg) than in the placebo/comparator 
group (15%).  P1NP for ertugliflozin 5mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo/comparator group was 18%, 
27% and 30% and PTH 23%, 12% and 7.2%.  
Hypoglycaemia 
In study P001/1016, there was a higher incidence of hypoglycaemia relative to the other phase III 
studies. This was expected given the high rate (90%) of insulin and/ or insulin secretagogue as 
background therapy in this study. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was similar across the groups. 
Potassium 
In patients with moderate renal impairment, subjects meeting the PDLC criteria ≥1.0 mEq/L and value 
>ULN, were seen slightly more often in subjects treated with ertugliflozin (11% in both groups) than 
with placebo 8.6%. Incidences of elevated serum potassium meeting the PDLC criteria >5.4 mEq/L and 
15% above baseline, were seen in 12% subjects treated with ertugliflozin 5 mg, 10% subjects treated 
with ertugliflozin 15 mg, and 7.9% subjects treated with placebo.  
Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program  
No specific subgroup analyses were performed for subjects taking the combination of ertugliflozin and 
metformin. Of note, only 1.6%-3.8% of the subjects were ≥75 years old.  
Pregnancy and lactation 
Ertugliflozin Phase III development program 
There were 2 pregnancies in the Broad Pool. One pregnancy, in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, ended in 
an elective abortion and the other, in the non-ertugliflozin group, resulted in a spontaneous abortion. 
Based on results from animal studies, ertugliflozin may affect renal development and maturation, 
therefore ertugliflozin is not recommended during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. 
There is no information regarding the presence of ertugliflozin in human milk, the effects on the 
breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production.  Ertugliflozin is present in the milk of lactating rats. 
Since human kidney maturation occurs in utero and during the first 2 years of life when lactational 
exposure may occur, there may be risk to the developing human kidney.

Metformin did not adversely affect developmental outcomes when administered to rats and rabbits at 
doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. This represents an exposure of about 2 and 6 times the maximum 
recommended human dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparisons for rats and rabbits, 
respectively. Determination of foetal concentrations demonstrated a partial placental barrier to 
metformin. 
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women with the ertugliflozin/metformin 
FDC or its individual components. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Ertugliflozin 
Single-dose drug interaction studies of ertugliflozin with metformin, simvastatin, sitagliptin, and 
glimepiride demonstrated no clinically meaningful interactions, either as a perpetrator or victim. 
Additionally, based on predictions from physiologically-based PK modelling, administration of 
ertugliflozin with a urinary glucose transport inhibitor would increase ertugliflozin exposure by 1.51-
fold. Multiple dose rifampin, an inducer of urinary glucose transporters and cytochromes P450, is 
associated with a 39% decrease in ertugliflozin exposure. This decrease in exposure with rifampin is 
not considered clinically relevant. Subgroup analyses were performed in the Broad Pool to evaluate 
whether selected baseline medications (ACE/ARBs, diuretics, loop diuretics) were associated with an 
increased risk of volume depletion events or renal-related events.  
Concomitant use of ertugliflozin and diuretics increased the incidence of volume depletion AEs in 
ertugliflozin groups. 
For acute kidney injury/failure AEs, no such trend was found for diuretics and ACE-I/ARB concomitant 
medication subgroups. However, there was a numeric increased incidence for renal-related adverse 
events overall in ertugliflozin groups (0.9%) compared to comparator group (0.5%) in ACE-I/ARB 
concomitant medication subgroup. No similar increase could be seen in diuretics subgroup. It is worth 
noting, however, that the number of renal-related events was low in both the ertugliflozin and 
comparator groups. 
The SmPC already correctly warns that special caution is needed with diuretics. Concomitant use of 
SGLT-2 inhibitors and ACE-I/ARB medicinal products may increase the risk of acute kidney injury due 
to the specific mechanism of action of ACE-I/ARB, especially in patients with volume depletion. 
However, hypotension caused by other anti-hypertensive agents may also increase the risk. This is 
reflected in section 4.4 in the SmPC. 
Metformin 
Effects of other medicinal products on metformin: 
Glyburide: In a single-dose interaction study in type 2 diabetes patients, co-administration of 
metformin and glyburide did not result in any changes in either metformin pharmacokinetics or 
pharmacodynamics. Decreases in glyburide AUC and Cmax were observed, but were highly variable. 
The single-dose nature of this study and the lack of correlation between glyburide blood levels and 
pharmacodynamic effects make the clinical significance of this interaction uncertain. 
Furosemide: A single-dose, metformin-furosemide drug interaction study in healthy subjects 
demonstrated that pharmacokinetic parameters of both compounds were affected by co-
administration. Furosemide increased the metformin plasma and blood Cmax and AUC without any 
significant change in metformin renal clearance. When administered with metformin, the Cmax and 
AUC of furosemide were smaller than when administered alone, and the terminal half-life was

decreased, without any significant change in furosemide renal clearance. No information is available 
about the interaction of metformin and furosemide when co-administered chronically. 
Nifedipine: A single-dose, metformin-nifedipine drug interaction study in normal healthy volunteers 
demonstrated that co-administration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cmax and AUC and 
increased the amount excreted in the urine. Tmax and half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to 
enhance the absorption of metformin. Metformin had minimal effects on nifedipine. 
Cationic drugs: Cationic drugs (e.g., amiloride, digoxin, morphine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine, 
ranitidine, triamterene, trimethoprim, or vancomycin) that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion 
theoretically have the potential for interaction with metformin by competing for common renal tubular 
transport systems. Such interaction between metformin and oral cimetidine has been observed in 
normal healthy volunteers in both single- and multiple-dose, metformin-cimetidine drug interaction 
studies, with a 60% increase in peak metformin plasma and whole blood concentrations and a 40% 
increase in plasma and whole blood metformin AUC. There was no change in elimination half-life in the 
single-dose study. Metformin had no effect on cimetidine pharmacokinetics. Although such interactions 
remain theoretical (except for cimetidine), careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of 
metformin and/or the interfering drug is recommended in patients who are taking cationic medications 
that are excreted via the proximal renal tubular secretory system. 
Other: Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycaemia and may lead to loss of glycaemic control. These 
drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, 
oestrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking 
drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving, sitagliptin and 
metformin FDC, the patient should be closely observed to maintain adequate glycaemic control. 
In healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of metformin and propranolol, and metformin and 
ibuprofen were not affected when co-administered in single-dose interaction studies. 
Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is, therefore, less likely to interact with highly 
protein-bound drugs such as salicylates, sulphonamides, chloramphenicol, and probenecid, as 
compared to the sulfonylureas, which are extensively bound to serum proteins 
Ertugliflozin and Metformin Combination Treatment 
A clinical drug-drug interaction study to estimate the effect of ertugliflozin on the PK of metformin and 
vice-versa following single oral dose administration of 15 mg ertugliflozin and 1000 mg metformin was 
conducted in healthy subjects. Study results indicated that co-administration of ertugliflozin and 
metformin did not alter ertugliflozin or metformin exposure when compared to ertugliflozin and 
metformin administered alone (Study P019). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Ertugliflozin Phase III development program 
Overall, the discontinuation rates due to AEs were similar across the treatment groups in both the PBO 
Pool (about 2%) and the Broad Pool (about 4%). In both Pools, there was a numerical imbalance of 
more frequent discontinuations due to genital infections in the ertugliflozin groups compared to 
placebo and the comparator group, respectively. In the Broad Pool, the frequency of events in the SOC 
Renal and urinary disorders leading to premature discontinuation was numerically higher for the 
ertugliflozin 15 mg (0.7%) than for the ertugliflozin 5 mg (0.3%) and the comparator (0.3%).

Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018

The incidence of adverse events resulting in discontinuation from study medication in the Ertu/Met Pool 
was low overall and not notably different in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (2.2%) and 15 mg (1.1%) groups 
relative to the placebo group (1.1%). The only discernible pattern was a low incidence of 
discontinuations in ertugliflozin-treated subjects due to adverse events related to genital mycotic 
infections. Two subjects, both in the placebo group, discontinued the study due to a SAE 
(subcutaneous abscess and ischaemic stroke).  
The incidence of adverse events resulting in discontinuation from study medication was somewhat 
higher in study P002/1013 than in the other studies in the Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III 
program (ertugliflozin 5 and 15 mg groups 4.0% and 5.7% respectively, glimepiride group 3.9%).  
In the infection and infestation SOC, a numerically higher occurrence of events leading to 
discontinuation of study medication in the ertugliflozin groups was due to genital mycotic infection-
related AEs. In the Investigations SOC, a higher occurrence of events leading to discontinuation of 
study medication in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group was due to 3 subjects with AEs of eGFR decreased. 
In the Renal and urinary disorders SOC, the numerically higher occurrence of AEs leading to 
discontinuation of study medication in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group was related to AEs of acute kidney 
injury (2 subjects) and pollakiuria (2 subjects). 
In the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, 1 subject each discontinued due to SAEs of face injury and gastric 
cancer, and in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group, 1 subject each discontinued due to SAEs of cholelithiasis, 
decreased eGFR, colon cancer, acute kidney injury, and balanoposthitis. The SAEs of eGFR decreased, 
acute kidney injury, and balanoposthitis were considered to be related to study medication. One 
subject in the glimepiride group discontinued due to a drug-related SAE of cerebrovascular accident. 
In the P005/1019 study, adverse events resulting in discontinuation from study medication occurred at 
a higher incidence in the E15/S100 group (2.9%) relative to the S100 group (0.4%). Incidences in the 
3 other groups were 2.4% in the E5 group and 1.2% each in the E15 and E5/S100 groups. The only 
adverse events that resulted in discontinuation from study medication in >1 subject across the 5 
groups were dizziness and balanoposthitis (each resulted in discontinuation of 2 subjects in the E5 
group). 
Two subjects, both in the E5/S100 group, discontinued study medication due to a serious adverse 
event; 1 due to an event of myocardial infarction and 1 due to an event of nodal marginal zone B-cell 
lymphoma stage III.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The ertugliflozin phase III safety database is in general considered sufficient. Overall, 3,409 subjects 
received at least one dose 5 or 15 mg ertugliflozin in the phase III studies of which 2,204 subjects 
were exposed for at least 50 weeks. In the placebo-controlled studies, 1,029 subjects received at least 
one dose of ertugliflozin of which 921 subjects received treatment for at least 25 weeks.  
A total of 721 subjects were randomized and received at least 1 dose of ertugliflozin in the two studies 
comprising the Ertu/Met Pool. 888 and 985 subjects were exposed to ertugliflozin on a background of 
metformin in Study P002/1013 and Study P005/1019, respectively. The Ertugliflozin add-on to 
Metformin Phase III program includes approximately 75% of the subjects in the Broad pool and 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 138/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
comprises of 2,594 ertugliflozin/metformin exposed subjects and 1,046 non-ertugliflozin treated 
subjects. 
Discontinuation rates for trial medication were similar in the ertugliflozin groups and slightly higher in 
the placebo/comparator group in the placebo-controlled studies and phase III studies, respectively. 
However, discontinuation rates were relatively high (about 20%) in the pool of phase III studies, which 
should be seen in the light of the longer mean duration of the studies. In the shorter placebo-
controlled studies, discontinuation rates were about 10 %. The most common reason for 
discontinuation from study drug was withdrawal by subject, discontinuation due to adverse events, lost 
to follow-up and hyperglycaemia (a common reason only in the pool of phase III studies).  
The most common adverse events for ertugliflozin were upper respiratory infection (higher frequency 
in the placebo group), hypoglycaemia (similar frequencies for all groups), headache (higher 
frequencies in the ertugliflozin groups), vulvovaginal mycotic infection (higher frequencies in the 
ertugliflozin groups) and urinary tract infections (similar frequencies for all groups). 
For most frequent AEs, similar results were observed in Ertu/Met Pool, as vulvovaginal mycotic 
infections, weight decreased and urinary tract infections were the most frequent AEs occurring with 
higher frequencies in ertugliflozin groups. 
Incidence of most frequent adverse events in Ertu/Met Pool share some other characteristics with the 
Broad  Pool:  most  frequent  diarrhoea  (and  nausea  as  well)  in  placebo  group,  dose  dependency  of 
weight  decrease  AE  and  Renal  and  Urinary  Disorder  SOC.  Hypoglycaemia  was  observed  with  higher 
frequency for non-ertugliflozin group. 
Incidences  of  drug-related  adverse  events  were  of  the  same  tendency  for  the  ertugliflozin  groups  of 
Broad  Pool  and  Ertu/Met  Pool  (i.e.  slightly  increased  AE  incidence  for  E15  groups  relative  to  non-
ertugliflozin groups). Absolute values of incidence are lower in Ertu/Met Pool. 
No new or unexpected adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions were reported in the Ertugliflozin 
add-on to Metformin Phase III program compared to the Ertugliflozin Phase III development program 
currently assessed in procedure EMEA/H/C/4315 or to the well-known safety profile for metformin. 
Volume depletion 
In the ertugliflozin phase III placebo-controlled Pool (PBO pool), the incidence of volume depletion 
events was low (<2%) and not notably different across the ertugliflozin and placebo groups. In the 
subgroup analyses in the Broad Pool, subjects with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, subjects ≥65 years of 
age and subjects on diuretics had a higher incidence of volume depletion in the ertugliflozin groups 
relative the comparator group. In subjects with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence of events of 
volume depletion was 5.1, 2.6% and 0.5% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and the 
comparator group and for subjects with eGFR 45 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence was 6.4%, 
3.7% and 0% respectively.  
With regard to volume depletion and osmotic diuresis, the data in the Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin 
Phase III program identified no additional safety or tolerability concerns for the combination relative to 
the two individual agents. Incidences of volume depletion AEs in Ertu/met Pool were of about the half 
of incidences in the Broad Pool. 
Genital infections/ urinary tract infections 
Urinary tract infections and genital infections were classified as adverse events of special interest due 
to its mechanism of action. In ertugliflozin-treated subjects, there was an increased risk of genital 
infections but no increased risk of urinary tract infections in the placebo-controlled pool. Both female 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 139/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and male genital infections were highly increased compared to placebo. Most of the events were mild 
or moderate in intensity. 
In the placebo-controlled pool, no event was serious among the female genital infections but two 
events (cellulitis of the male genital organ and phimosis) were serious among the male genital 
infections; both in the ertugliflozin group.  
In the Broad Pool, no event was serious among the female genital infections.Three events  
(cellulitis of the male genital organ, phimosis and balanoposthitis) were serious among the male 
genital infections. Phimosis was reported in 8 (0.5%) subjects in the all ertugliflozin group and 1 
subject (0.1%) in the comparator group in the male population. Four of 8 phimosis events in 
ertugliflozin-treated subjects were treated with circumcision. The subject with phimosis, in the 
comparator group, also underwent a circumcision. 
A similar increase in genital mycotic infections (both male and female) in ertugliflozin-treated subjects, 
as seen in the overall population, was seen in subjects both <65 years and ≥ 65 years. 
In the Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program , among males, but not females, 
complicated infections were more common in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group (1.1/0% in males/females) 
than in the ertugliflozin 5 mg (0.2/0.3% in males/ females) and the non-ertugliflozin groups (0/0.2% 
in males/ females) in the Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin program. 
Hypoglycaemia 
In the placebo-controlled Pool, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was relatively low, although, increased 
for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg (5.0% and 4.5%) compared to placebo (2.9%). When ertugliflozin 
was used as monotherapy, there was a small, not dose-dependent, increase in hypoglycaemic events 
in the ertugliflozin groups (2.6% in both groups) as compared to placebo (0.7%). Also when used as 
add-on to metformin, an increased risk of hypoglycaemic events was noted for ertugliflozin 5 mg 
(7.2%) and ertugliflozin 15 mg (7.8%) relative placebo (4.3%) of which about half of the events 
across the groups were events of symptomatic hypoglycaemia. The increased risk of hypoglycaemia 
compared to placebo is reflected in the SmPC.  
In the study in moderate renal impairment (P001/1016), there was a higher incidence of 
hypoglycaemia relative to the other phase III studies. This was expected given the high rate (90%) of 
insulin, SU and meglitinides as background therapy in this study. The incidence rates seem generally in 
line with data with other agents in the class when combined with insulin. It should however be noted 
that the hypoglycaemia rate was not consistently higher in the ertugliflozin groups compared to 
placebo, and there was no clear relation to the dose as the highest rates were often observed with the 
5 mg dose. 
The incidence of hypoglycaemia was similar across the groups. 
There was an increase in frequency of hypoglycaemic events in the E15/S100 group compared to the 
other groups in study P005/1019. This observation is most likely due to random variability since the 
observation in this is not consistent with corresponding results in study P006/1015 and P017/1047. 
Renal function 
There were transient and small decreases in eGFR in the ertugliflozin groups that returned to or 
towards baseline at week 26 but no imbalance between ertugliflozin and placebo in renal-related 
events. This is consistent with the findings in ertugliflozin/metformin treated subjects. Mean changes 
from baseline in BUN was higher in the ertugliflozin groups relative to the placebo group at week 26. 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 140/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, this is not considered to reflect impairment in renal function. The same phenomenon has 
been seen with other medicinal products in the class, but the explanation has so far been elusive. 
In subjects in the moderate renal impairment study, the decrease in eGFR was slightly larger (and did 
not return to baseline at week 26); however, reversed after treatment discontinuation. The incidence 
of renal-related events was higher in the ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg groups (2.5% and 1.3%, 
respectively) relative to placebo (0.6%).  
In subjects ≥65 of age, renal-related events were more frequently occurring in ertugliflozin groups 
(1.3% and 1.4% for 5 mg and 15 mg ertugliflozin, respectively) than for the comparator group 
(0.5%). 
In the Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program, the inclusion criteria included eGFR ≥ 55-
60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Thus, safety in subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment of the 
combination has not been sufficiently studied with ertugliflozin on background metformin. Despite the 
inclusion criteria, there are several subjects included with a baseline eGFR <55 ml/min/1.73 m2 in the 
studies. The Applicant has provided data showing that the renal function did not deteriorate further 
over time in the subset of subjects with baseline eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the four studies with 
ertugliflozin in combination with metformin. In the Ertu/met pool, no subjects with eGFR <60 
mL/min/1.73 m2 reported any volume depletion- or renal-related adverse events. In Studies 
P002/1013 and P005/1019 there were too few renal-related or volume depletion adverse events in this 
category (0-1 subjects per group) to be able to draw any meaningful conclusions. 
In the Ertu/Met Pool, the incidence of renal-related events was low (<1%) and not notably higher in 
the ertugliflozin groups relative to the placebo group. None of the events was serious or led to 
discontinuation. Across the Phase 3 one event in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group was adjudicated as “very 
likely” related, two events in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group and one event in the non-ertugliflozin group 
were adjudicated as “possibly” related to study medication. Among the four studies with subjects 
taking background metformin, 2 events, both in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group, were adjudicated as 
“possibly” related to study medication.  
Given these findings, as with initiation of the individual agents, monitoring of renal function should be 
performed prior to initiation of ertugliflozin and metformin combination therapy and periodically 
thereafter. 
An enhanced effect of sitagliptin when combined with ertugliflozin on impaired renal function was noted 
in study P005/1019 reflected by a larger initial decrease in eGFR in the two combination groups 
(E5/S100 and E15/S100) compared to the respective monotherapy group (ertugliflozin 5mg,  
ertugliflozin 15 mg and sitagliptin 100mg) 
Bone fractures 
In the ertugliflozin Phase 3 development program, long-term data regarding fractures was received 
from the Broad Pool. The cumulative incidence of adjudicated confirmed fractures at week 104 was 
similar across the groups; 0.9% (n=15) for ertugliflozin 5 mg, 0.6% (n=11) for ertugliflozin 15 mg and 
0.8% (n=12) for the comparator group. In the Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program, 
0.3% of the ertugliflozin/metformin treated patients had an event of fracture that was sent for 
adjudication. Interim 52 weeks BMD data in study P007/1017 showed small changes in BMD which was 
nominally statistically significant only for the ‘total hip’ data in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group. The 104 
week BMD data was also statistically significant only for the ‘total hip’ data in the ertugliflozin 15 mg 
group.

Changes in serum phosphate (6.8 and 8.5% vs. 1.9%) and magnesium (7.8% and 9.9% vs.  
-0.9%) but no change in serum calcium was seen with ertugliflozin treatment (5 mg and 15 mg) in the 
placebo-controlled Pool. In study P007/1017, there was a dose-dependent increase from baseline to 
week 26 in the bone resorption marker CTX for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg (29% and 38%) relative 
to placebo (10%). The bone formation marker P1NP increased two times more in the ertugliflozin 15 
mg group (15%) compared to ertugliflozin 5 mg (7.5%); however, increased even more in the placebo 
group (19%). 
In study P007/1017, subgroup analysis at week 26 in pre- versus postmenopausal women did not 
indicate any difference regarding ertugliflozin effect on CTX. Another subgroup analysis in subjects with 
and without osteopenia at baseline did not demonstrate any clinically significant differences in mean 
percent changes in BMD, CTX, P1NP and PTH between the groups. 
In moderate renal impaired patients, the event rate of fractures was too low for meaningful 
conclusions. Similar changes were noted in serum phosphate and magnesium as in the pool with 
placebo-controlled studies. No meaningful change in calcium was seen. CTX increased in the 
ertugliflozin groups 5 mg and 15 mg (33% and 34%) compared to placebo (9.6%) although not in a 
dose-dependent manner. 
Data on bone markers was provided at week 52 in study P001/1016 and P007/1017 and at week 104 
in study P007/1017. The bone resorption marker CTX was more increased in the ertugliflozin groups 
than in the placebo/comparator group at week 26, 52 and 104; although the difference to the 
comparator group was less pronounced at week 104. The bone formation marker P1NP was increased 
in both the ertugliflozin and the comparator groups. The clinical implication of the observed changes in 
the bone markers is not clear.  
Lower limb amputations 
In the Broad Pool, there were 10 subjects with non-traumatic limb amputations (all post-randomization 
treatment analysis): 1 of 1,450 (0.1%) in the non-ertugliflozin group, 1 of 1,716 (0.1%) in the 
ertugliflozin 5 mg group and 8 of 1,693 (0.5%) in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group (resulting in 9 of 3,409 
(0.3%) in the all ertugliflozin group). Among these cases, the most frequently reported amputation 
was toe amputation. One subject in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group underwent 2 amputation procedures 
(left second toe and left third toe amputations).  
Six of the 10 subjects with non-traumatic limb amputations were on background metformin. The 
studies in the Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin phase III program comprises of approximately 75% of 
the subjects in the Broad pool.  
The absolute numbers of toe amputation was low wherefore it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions 
from the data. Moreover, baseline history revealed risk factors such as peripheral neuropathy, 
peripheral artery disease (including one subject with a pre-existing peripheral artery aneurysm), 
diabetic foot, or former/current smoking to be present in all subjects. Associated adverse events 
included those related to limb infection, peripheral artery disease, and gangrene 
Ketoacidosis 
In the Broad Pool, 3 (0.1%) ertugliflozin-treated subjects were assessed to have met the case 
definition of ketoacidosis with either certain or possible likelihood compared to no cases in the 
comparator group. The rest of the cases were either determined unlikely to represent ketoacidosis (20 
cases) or were unclassifiable (2 cases). All events of ketoacidosis resolved, 2 after discontinuation of 
study medication and 1 resolved on treatment. 
All three cases of ketoacidosis were ertugliflozin add-on to metformin treated subjects.

Cardiovascular risk 
A small increase in LDL-C, HDL-C and total cholesterol was noted at week 26, similar as what has been 
seen with other SGLT-2 inhibitors.  LDL-C/HDL-C-ratio was evaluated in study P003/1022 and study 
P007/1017. In study P003/1022, there were small changes in LDL-C/HDL-C-ratio over time and no 
relevant differences between the groups.  LDL-C/HDL-C ratio will be assessed in the ongoing study 
P007/1017 at completion. 
Data supporting an assessment of CV safety profile is very limited with only few cases in each 
treatment group. There is a numerical imbalance between ertugliflozin and placebo, but no conclusion 
can be drawn. However, considering the known mechanism of action and experience from other 
products in the class, it is acceptable to provide data from the CV outcome study after a potential 
approval. 
Results from the phase III studies with ertugliflozin/metformin combination treatment did not identify 
any additional safety or tolerability concerns with regard to lipids and cardiovascular risk relative to 
ertugliflozin and metformin in monotherapy. 
Malignancies 
There was a slight imbalance in the SOC Neoplasms for ertugliflozin compared to the comparator 
groups in the broader pool of phase III studies. No trend could be observed, although, the risk for 
developing malignancies cannot be fully explored from controlled data in the clinical program covering 
rather short observation periods (mean duration less than a year).  
Laboratory findings 
Haemoglobin increased in the ertugliflozin groups and decreased in the placebo group, which is 
reflected in the SmPC.  
Subgroups 
In subjects ≥65 years of age, there was an increased risk for events related to volume depletion and 
events of renal impairment. Further analysis of the data indicate that age per se does not increase the 
risk of renal-related events but that this risk is related to renal function which is commonly decreased 
in the elderly.. The risks are reflected in the SmPC.  
In subjects with moderate renal impairment treated with ertugliflozin, the decrease in eGFR was 
slightly larger than in the placebo-controlled Pool, and did not return to baseline at week 26, and the 
incidence of renal-related events was higher for ertugliflozin than for placebo. In the same subgroup, 
at week 26 and 52, CTX increased from baseline more in the ertugliflozin groups than in the 
placebo/comparator group. P1NP was increased for ertugliflozin and the comparator. In subjects with 
baseline eGFR >45 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, events of volume depletion were more common than for 
the comparator group.  
Lactic acidosis 
While metformin is not associated with a decrease in eGFR, it is cleared renally, and in the presence of 
severe renal impairment metformin has been reported to be associated with lactic acidosis. Osmotic 
diuresis and volume depletion, with the risk for secondary renal impairment, are known risks with 
SGLT-2 inhibitors. Treatment with ertugliflozin also induced a transient decrease in eGFR. In subjects 
with moderate renal impairment, the decrease in eGFR was slightly larger and did not return to 
baseline at week 26. Thus, there are reasons for being observant to the risk of lactic acidosis with the 
combination of ertugliflozin and metformin.  
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 143/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, no events of lactic acidosis or related events (blood lactic acid abnormal, increased blood 
lactic acid, urine lactic acid, urine lactic acid increased, and hyperlactacidaemia) were reported so far in 
the Phase III development program for ertugliflozin including subjects on background metformin. 
Drug-drug interactions A clinical drug-drug interaction study to estimate the effect of ertugliflozin on 
the PK of metformin and vice-versa following single oral dose administration of 15 mg ertugliflozin and 
1000 mg metformin was conducted in healthy subjects. Study results indicated that co-administration 
of ertugliflozin and metformin did not alter ertugliflozin or metformin exposure when compared to 
ertugliflozin and metformin administered alone.  
Concomitant use of ertugliflozin and diuretics seemed to increase the incidence of volume depletion 
AEs in ertugliflozin groups. Moreover, concomitant use of SGLT-2 inhibitors and ACE-I/ARB medicinal 
products increases the risk of acute kidney injury, due to the specific mechanism of action of ACE-
I/ARB, especially in patients with volume depletion. However, hypotension caused by other anti-
hypertensive agents may also increase the risk. This is reflected in the SmPC, section 4.4.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile for ertugliflozin is consistent with other SGLT2 inhibitors. In general, the safety 
results on ertugliflozin from the ertugliflozin Phase 3 studies could be extrapolated to the 
ertugliflozin/metformin combination treatment. 
In the ertugliflozin phase III studies, the rate of hypoglycaemia was relatively low although increased 
for ertugliflozin (5.0% and 4.5% for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg) compared to placebo (2.9%). This 
is reflected in the SmPC. 
There was an increased risk of genital infections in ertugliflozin-treated subjects compared to placebo.  
In female subjects the incidence of genital infections was 9.1%, 12.2% and 3.0% for ertugliflozin 5 
mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo, and in male subjects the incidence was 3.7%, 4.2% and 0.4% 
respectively. The incidence of UTI was not notably different in the ertugliflozin groups (4.0% and 
4.1%) and the placebo group (3.9%).  
The incidence of volume depletion events was low (<2%) and not notably different across the 
ertugliflozin and placebo groups.  Subjects with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, subjects ≥65 years of age 
and subjects on diuretics had a higher incidence of volume depletion in the ertugliflozin groups relative 
to the comparator group. 
The bone resorption marker CTX was more increased in the ertugliflozin groups than in the 
placebo/comparator group at week 26, 52 and 104; although the difference to the comparator group 
was less pronounced at week 104. The bone formation marker P1NP was increased in both the 
ertugliflozin and the comparator groups. Subgroup analysis at week 26 in pre- versus postmenopausal 
women did not indicate any difference regarding ertugliflozin effect on CTX. Another subgroup analysis 
in subjects, with and without osteopenia at baseline, did not demonstrate any significant differences in 
mean percent changes in BMD, CTX, P1NP and PTH between the groups. The clinical implication of the 
observed changes in the bone markers is not clear. However, interim 52 week and final 104 week BMD 
data showed small changes in BMD which was statistically significant only for the ‘total hip’ data in the 
ertugliflozin 15 mg group, which provides reassurance. Moreover, the cumulative incidence of 
adjudicated confirmed fractures at week 104 was similar across the groups; 0.9% (n=15) for 
ertugliflozin 5 mg, 0.6% (n=11) for ertugliflozin 15 mg and 0.8% (n=12) for the comparator group. 
For completeness, the Applicant agreed to provide final summarized data of all adjudicated confirmed 
fractures, including the incidence of low trauma fractures, at the time of submission of the final CSR 
Assessment report

for the study P007/1017. “Bone fracture” is included in the RMP as an important potential risk, which is 
considered appropriate. 
A slight increase in LDL-C, HDL-C and total cholesterol with ertugliflozin was noted. Data supporting an 
assessment of CV safety profile is very limited with only few cases in each treatment group. There is a 
numerical imbalance between ertugliflozin and placebo, but no conclusion can be drawn. However, 
considering the known mechanism of action and experience from other products in the class, it is 
acceptable to provide data from the CV outcome study after a potential approval. 
Subjects with moderate renal impairment seem to be at a higher risk for events of volume depletion 
and renal-related events. The decrease in eGFR was about 1 mL/min/1.73 m2 larger than in the 
placebo Pool, and was not transient at Week 26; however, reversed after treatment discontinuation. In 
the study with moderate renal impairment at week 26 and 52, CTX increased from baseline more in 
the ertugliflozin groups than in the placebo/comparator group. P1NP was increased for ertugliflozin and 
the comparator. .  
The data in the Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program identified no additional safety or 
tolerability concerns for the combination of the medicinal products relative to the two agents given 
alone. Due to risk of volume depletion and decreased renal function of ertugliflozin, there are reasons 
for being observant to the risk of lactic acidosis with the combination of ertugliflozin and metformin. No 
events of lactic acidosis have been reported so far. The Applicant has provided data showing that the 
renal function did not deteriorate further over time in the subset of subjects with baseline eGFR <60 
mL/min/1.73 m2 in the four studies with ertugliflozin in combination with metformin. In the Ertu/met 
pool, no subjects with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 reported any volume depletion- or renal-related 
adverse events.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.3 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 1.12.2017. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points.

2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of ertugliflozin with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers ertugliflozin to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Segluromet (ertugliflozin / metformin 
hydrochloride) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, 
on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication for Segluromet is: 
“Segluromet is indicated in adults aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct 
to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control: 
• 
in patients not adequately controlled on their maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone 
• 
in patients on their maximally tolerated doses of metformin in addition to other medicinal 
products for the treatment of diabetes  
• 
in patients already being treated with the combination of ertugliflozin and metformin as 
separate tablets. 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 150/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(For study results with respect to combinations and effects on glycaemic control, see sections 4.4, 4.5 
and 5.1.)” 
The aim of therapy is to improve metabolic control in terms of blood glucose, thereby decreasing the 
risk of microvascular and expected to decrease macrovascular long-term complications. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Despite the availability of a broad array of AHAs, only approximately half of patients with T2DM 
achieve glycaemic control per treatment guidelines. There are several factors contributing to the low 
attainment of A1C goals.  First, patients with T2DM exhibit declining -cell function, which influences 
disease progression and leads to elevated A1C levels over time.  Second, increased body weight leads 
to worsening insulin resistance.  Finally, several classes of anti-hyperglycaemic medications are 
associated with adverse reactions, including weight gain (which may further worsen underlying insulin 
resistance), hypoglycaemia, oedema, or gastrointestinal effects, which often limit their use. 
The management of chronic diseases like T2DM is often limited by clinical inertia: the delay or failure 
to escalate or alter therapy when the therapeutic effect is not attained.  Use of a combination of two 
different classes of agents may improve the efficacy of the treatment. Use of a FDC has previously 
been shown to improve adherence with the treatment regimen. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Four phase 3 studies are included in this registration dossier.  All were randomized, double-blind, 
parallel-group studies. The primary assessment of efficacy was performed after 26 or 52 weeks of 
treatment. 
Two of the pivotal studies investigated ertugliflozin as add-on to ongoing metformin treatment.  
In study P007/1017, ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg respectively was compared to placebo. The overall 
study duration was 104 weeks with the primary endpoint measured at 26 weeks.  
In study P002/1013, ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg respectively was compared to glimepiride and the 
primary objective was to show that ertugliflozin 15 mg and 5 mg was non-inferior to glimepiride. The 
overall study duration was 104 weeks with the primary endpoint measured at 52 weeks.  
In the other two studies, triple combination with ertugliflozin, metformin and sitagliptin was 
investigated.  
Study P006/1015 included patients on stable background therapy with metformin ≥1500 mg/day and 
sitagliptin 100 mg/day. Ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg respectively (as add-on to metformin + 
sitagliptin) was compared to placebo. The overall study duration was 52 weeks with the primary 
endpoint measured at 26 weeks.  
Study P005/1019 was a factorial study comparing ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg with the combined 
treatment of both ertugliflozin doses with sitagliptin 100 mg as add-on to metformin treatment. A 
treatment arm with sitagliptin 100 mg was also included. The overall study duration was 52 weeks with 
the primary endpoint measured at 26 weeks.  
A total of 4863 subjects were randomly assigned to treatment in the Phase 3 studies supporting 
registration of ertugliflozin, with 2597 of these subjects randomly assigned to treatment with

ertugliflozin on a background of metformin. In the studies, ertugliflozin and metformin were 
administered as free combination and metformin was given according to label. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The same primary endpoint, change from baseline HbA1c, was applied in all studies. 
In study P007/1017 ertugliflozin was given as add-on to metformin and compared to placebo. The 
treatment difference versus placebo was -0.70% (-0.87,-0.53) for the 5 mg dose and -0.88% (-1.05,-
0.71) for the 15 mg dose.  
In the non-inferiority study P002/1013, ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg was compared to glimepiride in 
patients on background metformin treatment. The treatment difference vs glimepiride was 0.18% 
(0.06, 0.30) for the 5 mg dose and 0.10 (-0.02, 0.22) for the 15 mg dose. Thus non-inferiority was 
shown for the 15 mg dose as the non-inferiority margin chosen was 0.3% whereas the outcome for the 
5 mg was of borderline character since the chosen delta of 0.3% was included in the upper limit of the 
95% CI. Regarding assessment of robustness, in addition to the PP analyses, analyses based on the 
modified FAS were performed (using both the ER and IR approach). The outcomes, irrespective of 
analysis and comparison, were very similar and supported the primary outcomes. The change from 
baseline in HbA1c was -0.56 ± 0.045 for the 5 mg dose and -0.64 ± 0.045 for the 15 mg dose. 
In study P006/1015, ertugliflozin was given as add-on to metformin and sitagliptin with placebo as 
control. In this study, the treatment difference versus placebo was -0.69% (-0.87,-0.50) for the 5 mg 
dose and -0.76% (-0.95,-0.58) for the 15 mg dose.  
In the factorial study P005/1019, where ertugliflozin was either given as single therapy or co-
administered with sitagliptin on background metformin therapy, single therapy with ertugliflozin 5 mg 
and 15 mg resulted in very similar HbA1c reductions of -1.02% and -1.08%, respectively. The HbA1c 
reduction with single therapy sitagliptin 100 mg was -1.05%. Both combinations (ertugliflozin 5mg + 
sitagliptin 100 mg and ertugliflozin 15 mg + sitagliptin 100 mg) resulted in very similar differences in 
treatment effect compared to the respective single component of -0.43% to -0.49%. 
In the placebo-controlled studies, the magnitude of effect of about 0.7-0.9% and was consistent in 
studies P007/1017 (metformin only) and P006/1015 (metformin + sitagliptin). In studies P002/1013 
and P005/1019, no placebo-adjustment was made. In these studies, the change from baseline in 
HbA1c ranged from -0.6% to -1.1%. It may therefore be concluded that ertugliflozin provides a 
relevant contribution to the effect of the FDC. 
In study P002/1013, the duration of phase A of the study was 52 weeks, thus this study provides some 
long-term data on the effect of ertugliflozin. The data show that the maximum effect was observed 
after 12 weeks and the remained stable in contrast with the effect of glimepiride which reached its 
maximum effect after 18 weeks thereafter the effect slowly decreased. The duration of the effect was 
further supported by data from the four extension studies that were finalised during the procedure. 
The outcome of the secondary endpoints was consistent with the primary endpoint across the studies.  
In all studies, 26 to 40% of subjects achieved the treatment goal of HbA1c <7.0% when ertugliflozin 
was given in combination with metformin only. Higher responder rates were observed when 
ertugliflozin was given in triple combination with sitagliptin (32 to 52%).  
Across the studies, consistent reductions from baseline in body weight were observed with ertugliflozin 
5 mg and 15 mg. The placebo or active control adjusted weight reduction ranged from 1.6 to 4.3 kg. 
The largest treatment difference was observed in the ertugliflozin vs glimepiride study (study 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 152/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
P002/1013) due to the weight increase observed in the glimepiride treated group. There was no clear 
dose response relationship with regards to body weight.  
Reductions from baseline in sitting SBP were observed with ertugliflozin 15 mg and 5 mg across the 
phase 3 studies regardless of between-study differences in background medication and study designs. 
The reduction in SBP ranged from -2.8 mmHg to -4.8 mmHg with slightly larger reductions in the 
higher ertugliflozin dose groups. Reductions in DBP were observed in line with the data for SBP. 
Three additional phase 3 studies were included in the submission in order to support the efficacy of 
ertugliflozin. Study P003/1022 investigated the effect of ertugliflozin as monotherapy versus placebo. 
The treatment differences in the change from baseline in HbA1c was -0.99% (-1.22,-0.76) for the 5 
mg and -1.16% (-1.39, -0.93) for the 15 mg dose of ertugliflozin compared to placebo. Secondary 
glycaemic endpoints all supported the primary endpoint. The proportion of patients with HbA1c<7.0% 
was 28% for the 5 mg dose and 36% for the 15 mg dose of ertugliflozin compared to 13% in the 
placebo group. 
In study P017/1047, combination therapy with ertugliflozin and sitagliptin was initiated without other 
AHA background treatment. The treatment effect was -1.16% (95%CI:-1.49, -0.84) for the 5 mg dose 
and -1.24% (95%CI:-1.57, -0.91) for the 15 mg dose. This effect was comparable to that observed in 
study P005/1019. Secondary glycaemic endpoints all supported the primary endpoint. The proportion 
of patients with HbA1c<7.0% was higher in the low dose of ertugliflozin compared to the high dose 
(36% vs 31%).  
In both these studies, a significant decrease in body weight of about 2 kg was observed with both 
ertugliflozin doses. Decreases in SBP and DBP were also observed. 
Study P001/1016 included patients with renal impairment (eGFR of ≥30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 
on stable AHA treatment. All AHAs (including insulin) except metformin, rosiglitazone and other 
SGLT2-inhibitors were allowed. In the primary analysis, no relevant effect on HbA1c was observed for 
any of the doses compared to placebo. In a post-hoc analysis in the overall cohort excluding patients 
who had blood samples positive for metformin (see below), a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c 
was observed in the high dose group (-0.33%, 95%CI: -0.55, -0.11). A post-hoc analysis was also 
conducted in the subgroup of patients with eGFR 45-60. The change from baseline in HbA1c was 
comparable to that of the overall cohort.  
This was the only study where patients were allowed to use insulin and/or SU as background 
medication. The subgroup of subjects using insulin at baseline showed a change in HbA1c from 
baseline both in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group (-0.36% [-0.57, -0.16]) and in the ertugliflozin 5 mg 
group (-0.12% [-0.33, 0.09]). There was no difference in outcome versus placebo for the ertugliflozin 
5 mg group and a statistically non-significant improvement of -0.2% for the ertugliflozin 15 mg group. 
In the subgroup of subjects on a sulfonylurea at baseline, the HbA1c change from baseline was -0.45% 
(-0.69, -0.22) and -0.51% (-0.74, -0.28) for the ertugliflozin 15 mg and 5 mg groups, respectively. No 
treatment difference compared to placebo was observed. 
Across the studies, no formal comparisons were made between the two doses of ertugliflozin. The 
treatment difference between the doses ranged from 0.06% to 0.18%. The difference in responder 
rates (HbA1c < 7.0%) between the two ertugliflozin doses was generally small (about 4-6%). Across 
the study program, numerically larger HbA1c reductions were observed with the higher dose. The 
treatment difference was most pronounced in the population with median HbA1c > 7.9%.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Study P001/1016 included patients with moderate renal impairment. After breaking the blind in part A 
of the study, it was discovered that 78 subjects (out of 467) had blood samples positive for metformin. 
The reasons for the use of metformin in contrary to protocol could not be clarified. Audits have not 
identified any systematic GCP issues and the study data was accepted.   
Study P001/1016 was also the only study where patients were allowed to use insulin and/or SU as 
background medication. Although clinically relevant reductions in HbA1c from baseline was observed 
with at least the higher ertugliflozin dose when used in combination with either insulin or SU, no 
statistically significant differences were observed compared to placebo. It can, however, be 
hypothesised that a more pronounced effect is expected in patients with normal renal function.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The rate of hypoglycaemia was relatively low, although increased for ertugliflozin (5.0% and 4.5% for 
ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg) compared to placebo (2.9%).  
There was an increased risk in ertugliflozin-treated subjects of genital infections. In female subjects 
the incidence of genital infections was 9.1%, 12.2% and 3.0% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 
mg and placebo and in male subjects the incidence was 3.7%, 4.2% and 0.4% respectively. Most of 
the events were mild or moderate in intensity. 
The incidence of volume depletion events was low (<2%) and not notably different across the 
ertugliflozin and placebo groups.  Subjects with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, subjects ≥65 years of age 
and subjects on diuretics had a higher incidence of volume depletion in the ertugliflozin groups relative 
to the comparator group. 
The bone resorption marker CTX was more increased in the ertugliflozin groups than in the 
placebo/comparator group at week 26, 52 and 104; although the difference to the comparator group 
was less pronounced at week 104. The bone formation marker P1NP was increased in both the 
ertugliflozin and the comparator groups.  In moderate renal impaired patients, there was an imbalance 
in CTX of the same magnitude as in study P007/1017. The clinical implication of the observed changes 
in the bone markers is not clear. However, interim 52 week and final 104 week BMD data showed 
small changes in BMD which was statistically significant only for the ‘total hip’ data in the ertugliflozin 
15 mg group, which provides reassurance. Moreover, the cumulative incidence of adjudicated 
confirmed fractures at week 104 was similar across the groups; 0.9% (n=15) for ertugliflozin 5 mg, 
0.6% (n=11) for ertugliflozin 15 mg group and 0.8% (n=12) for the comparator group. The Applicant 
has confirmed to provide final summarized data of all adjudicated confirmed fractures, including the 
incidence of low trauma fractures, at the time of submission of the final CSR for the study P007/1017.  
There were transient and small decreases in eGFR and small increases in creatinine in the ertugliflozin 
groups that returned to or towards baseline at week 26 but no imbalance between ertugliflozin and 
placebo in renal-related events. In moderate renal impaired patients (P001/1016), the decrease in 
eGFR was slightly larger and did not return to baseline at week 26; however, reversed after treatment 
discontinuation. The incidence of renal-related events was higher in the ertugliflozin groups relative to 
placebo in study P001/1016.  
Small increase in LDL-C, HDL-C and total cholesterol was noted at week 26 in the placebo-controlled 
pool. Data supporting an assessment of CV safety profile is very limited with only few cases in each

treatment group. There is a numerical imbalance between ertugliflozin and placebo in the SOC Cardiac 
disorder, but no conclusion can be drawn. The CV outcome study is ongoing. 
Subgroups 
In subjects ≥65 years of age, there was an increased risk for events related to volume depletion and 
events of renal impairment. Further analysis of the data indicate that age per se does not increase the 
risk of renal-related events but that this risk is related to renal function which is commonly decreased 
in the elderly.   
In subjects with moderate renal impairment treated with ertugliflozin, the decrease in eGFR was 
slightly larger than in the placebo-controlled Pool, and did not return to baseline at week 26 at week 
26 and 52. In the same subgroup at week 26 and 52, CTX increased from baseline more in the 
ertugliflozin groups than in the placebo/comparator group. In subjects with baseline eGFR 45 to <60 
mL/min/1.73 m2, events of volume depletion were more common than for the comparator group. 
The data in the Ertugliflozin add-on to Metformin Phase III program identified no additional safety or 
tolerability concerns for the combination of the medicinal products relative to the two agents given 
alone. No event of lactic acidosis has been reported so far in ertugliflozin/metformin treated subjects.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Data supporting an assessment of CV safety profile is very limited with only few cases in each 
treatment group. There is a numerical imbalance between ertugliflozin and placebo, but no conclusion 
can be drawn. However, considering the known mechanism of action and experience from other 
products in the class, it is acceptable to provide data from the CV outcome study after a potential 
approval. 
While metformin is not associated with a decrease in eGFR, it is cleared renally, and in the presence of 
severe renal impairment, metformin has been reported to be associated with lactic acidosis. Due to 
risk of volume depletion and decreased renal failure of ertugliflozin, the risk of lactic acidosis is 
relevant for the combination of ertugliflozin and metformin. Patients with moderate renal impairment 
may be vulnerable to ertugliflozin - metformin combination therapy as their renal function may further 
be impaired, questioning the safety, therefore the acceptability, of this combination in this patient 
group. However, so far no events of lactic acidosis have been reported with the combination.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The current application concerns a FDC with the new medicinal product ertugliflozin and metformin. 
The clinical data provided show that ertugliflozin per se has clinically relevant effects on both glycaemic 
control, in terms of HbA1c reduction, and reductions in body weight, both when given as monotherapy 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 156/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and in combination with metformin and/or sitagliptin. The size of the glucose-lowering effect is 
comparable to that observed with glimepiride although non-inferiority has not been formally shown for 
the lower dose.  The magnitude of effect is comparable to that observed with already approved SGLT2-
inhibitors. Beneficial effects were also observed on SBP but although the effect was consistent across 
the study program, statistical significance was not always reached. 
Since not only hyperglycaemia but also hypertension and overweight are substantial treatment 
challenges in T2DM, these effects are beneficial. 
The data submitted also show that the effect is maintained up to one year. 
In the studies where ertugliflozin was given as add-on to metformin the added effect was clinically 
relevant, thus the data support the use of ertugliflozin and metformin as FDC.  
The proposed indication states that ertugliflozin can be used in combination with other medicinal 
products for the treatment of diabetes. The clinical study program supporting the application mainly 
focused on the use of ertugliflozin in combination with metformin and/or sitagliptin which is acceptable. 
The data in combination with SU and/or insulin is limited since patients were allowed to use insulin 
and/or SU as background medication only in study P001/1016. Study P001/1016 provides some data 
to support a pharmacological effect of ertugliflozin in combination with insulin or SU even though the 
glucose lowering effect was limited in this setting. However, based on the knowledge about the 
mechanism of action for ertugliflozin, a more pronounced effect of ertugliflozin when combined with SU 
and/or insulin is expected in patients with normal renal function. The safety data provided with study 
P001/1016 show an increased risk of hypoglycaemia with these combinations. This risk is deemed to 
be adequately mitigated by the warnings included in the SmPC. Therefore the benefit risk is considered 
positive for the combined use of ertugliflozin and insulin and/or SU. 
The effect of ertugliflozin is dependent on renal function. Data in patients with moderate renal 
impairment (eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) only showed a modest treatment effect with the 
highest dose. Taking into account the modest effect also with the highest dose in patients with eGFR 
45-60, it is recommended not to initiate treatment in patients with eGFR < 60 although treatment may 
be continued until eGFR falls below 45. 
Across the studies, no formal comparisons were made between the two doses of ertugliflozin. The 
treatment difference between the doses ranged from 0.06% to 0.18%. The difference in responder 
rates (HbA1c < 7.0%) between the two ertugliflozin doses was generally small (about 4-6%). These 
data are in line with the data from the phase 1 and phase 2 studies. However, numerically larger 
HbA1c reductions were consistently observed with the higher dose. The treatment difference was most 
pronounced in the population with median HbA1c > 7.9%. Thus the higher dose may provide additional 
benefit for patients with a greater need for better metabolic control. 
The safety profile for ertugliflozin is mostly consistent with other SGLT-2 inhibitors. The most important 
risk for ertugliflozin is associated with the mechanism of action (glycosuria and diuretic effect) such as 
volume depletion, genital infections and hypoglycaemia. The majority of these events were mild or 
moderate and manageable.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The effect of the FDC with ertugliflozin and metformin on glycaemic control in patients with normal 
renal function or mild renal impairment has been adequately shown as well as beneficial effects on 
body weight and SBP. The effects observed in this population are considered to outweigh the observed 
risks with treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/86928/2018  
Page 157/159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The benefits in patients with moderate renal impairment are less pronounced than in patients with 
better renal function. Therefore initiation of treatment is restricted to patients with eGFR > 60. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Segluromet is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Segluromet is favourable in the following indication: 
“Segluromet is indicated in adults aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct 
to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control: 
• 
• 
• 
in patients not adequately controlled on their maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone 
in patients on their maximally tolerated doses of metformin in addition to other medicinal 
products for the treatment of diabetes  
in patients already being treated with the combination of ertugliflozin and metformin as separate 
tablets.  
(For study results with respect to combinations and effects on glycaemic control, see sections 4.4, 4.5 
and 5.1.)” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the

Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that ertugliflozin is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.

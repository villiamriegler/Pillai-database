Submission of the final report from study M13-545 
26/10/2023
n/a
Study M13-545 was a Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind 
listed as a category 3 study in the RMP (MEA/10). 
This is a Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Study 
Comparing Upadacitinib (ABT-494) Once Daily 
Monotherapy to Methotrexate (MTX) Monotherapy in 
MTX-Naïve Subjects with Moderately to Severely 
Active Rheumatoid Arthritis.
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority
Study Comparing Upadacitinib (ABT-494) Once Daily 
Monotherapy to Methotrexate (MTX) Monotherapy in MTX-
Naïve Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active 
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) which included two periods. 
Period 1 had two objectives. The first, was to compare the 
safety and efficacy of upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD monotherapy 
(for subjects in Japan only), 15 mg QD monotherapy, and 
30 mg QD monotherapy versus weekly MTX monotherapy 
for the treatment of signs and symptoms of RA in MTX-
naïve subjects with moderately to severely active RA. The 
second, was to compare the efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg 
QD monotherapy and upadacitinib 30 mg QD monotherapy 
versus weekly MTX monotherapy for prevention of 
structural progression in MTX-naïve subjects with 
moderately to severely active RA.
The objective of Period 2 was to evaluate the long-term 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD 
(for subjects in Japan only), 15 mg QD, and 30 mg QD in 
subjects with RA who have completed Period 1.
Following a protocol amendment, subjects who previously 
received blinded upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg QD were

switched to open-label upadacitinib 15 mg QD. Subjects 
who previously received blinded MTX received open-label 
MTX.
The CHMP concluded that no changes to the product 
information are required based on the long-term results 
from study M13-545. The efficacy results remained stable 
and there were no new safety concerns.

Submission of the final report from study M13-549 
14/09/2023
n/a
Study M13-549 was a Phase 3 multicenter study that 
listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. This is a 
Phase III, Randomized, Double-Blind Study 
Comparing Upadacitinib (ABT-494) to Placebo in 
Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active 
Rheumatoid Arthritis Who Are on a Stable Dose of 
Conventional Synthetic Disease-Modifying Anti 
Rheumatic Drugs (csDMARDs) and Have an 
Inadequate Response to csDMARDs.
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority
included two periods. Period 1 (results submitted with the 
initial marketing authorisation application) was a 12-week, 
randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-
controlled period designed to compare the safety and 
efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg once daily (QD) and 
upadacitinib 30 mg QD vs. placebo. 
Subjects who completed the Week 12 visit (end of Period 
1) entered the blinded long-term extension portion of the 
study, Period 2 (up to 5 years). Subjects who were 
assigned to upadacitinib treatment groups continued to 
receive upadacitinib 15 mg QD or upadacitinib 30 mg QD 
per original randomization assignment in a blinded manner 
and subjects who were assigned to placebo were switched 
to receive upadacitinib 15 mg QD or upadacitinib 30 mg QD 
in a blinded fashion per pre- specified randomization 
assignments. Following a protocol amendment, all subjects 
received open label upadacitinib 15 mg QD, including those 
on upadacitinib 30 mg QD, with the earliest switch 
occurring at the Week 168 visit, before that all doses were 
blinded. 
The CHMP concluded that no changes to the product 
information or the risk management plan are required 
based on the long-term results from study M13-549. The 
efficacy results remained stable and there were no new 
safety concerns.

randomized, double-blind, parallel-group period (placebo-
controlled for the first 12 weeks), designed to compare the 
safety and efficacy of upadacitinib 30 mg once daily (QD) 
and upadacitinib 15 mg QD vs. placebo for the treatment of 
signs and symptoms of subjects with moderately to 
severely active RA who were on a stable dose of csDMARDs 
and had an inadequate response to or intolerance to at 
least 1 bDMARD. 
Period 2 was a blinded long-term extension period to 
evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 
upadacitinib 30 mg QD and upadacitinib 15 mg QD in 
subjects with RA who had completed Period 1. Following 
Protocol Amendment 4.0 approval, all subjects received 
open-label upadacitinib 15 mg QD, including those who had 
previously been on upadacitinib 30 mg QD, with the earliest 
switch occurring at the Week 180 visit.
The CHMP concluded that no changes to the product 
information and the risk management plan are required 
based on the long-term results from study M13-542. The 
efficacy results remained stable and there were no new 
safety concerns.

stable treatment with upadacitinib 15 mg. 98% of patients 
were on concomitant methotrexate. 49% of patients were 
on oral corticosteroids at baseline. The primary endpoint 
was the proportion of patients with a satisfactory humoral 
response defined as ≥ 4 fold increase in pre-vaccination 
concentration of anti-glycoprotein E titer levels at week 16 
(4 weeks post-dose 2 vaccination). Vaccination of patients 
treated with upadacitinib 15 mg resulted in a satisfactory 
humoral response in 79/90 (88% [95% CI: 81.0, 94.5]) of 
patients at week 16.”
Prior to initiating upadacitinib treatment, it is recommended 
that patients be brought up to date with all immunisations, 
including prophylactic zoster vaccinations, in agreement 
with current immunisation guidelines.

based on the final results from vaccination substudy 
(within study M13-538) listed as a category 3 study 
in the RMP; this is an open-label extension to assess 
the impact of upadacitinib treatment with a stable 
background of methotrexate on immunological 
responses following administration of a 
pneumococcal vaccine in rheumatoid arthritis 
patients. The RMP version 5.0 has also been

methotrexate on immunological responses following 
administration of a pneumococcal vaccine in rheumatoid 
arthritis patients who received either upadacitinib 15 mg 
QD or 30 mg QD. 
The primary endpoint of the substudy was the proportion of 
subjects with satisfactory humoral response to the 
inactivated pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine 
(13-valent, adsorbed) at Week 4.  Satisfactory humoral 
response was defined as ≥ 2-fold increase in antibody 
concentration from the vaccination baseline in at least 6 
out of the 12 pneumococcal antigens (1, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 
9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F). 
A total of 111 subjects received pneumococcal vaccination 
and at least 1 dose of upadacitinib after vaccination, of 
which 87 subjects received upadacitinib 15 mg and 24 
subjects received upadacitinib 
30 mg. A total of 108 (97.3%) subjects received 
concomitant MTX . A satisfactory humoral response was 
achieved by 67.5% (95% CI: 57.4, 77.5) and 56.5% (95% 
CI: 36.3, 76.8) of patients treated with upadacitinib 15 mg 
and 30 mg, respectively.

Update of sections 4.4 to amend the information on 
vaccination with inactivated pneumococcal polysaccharide 
conjugate vaccine (13-valent, adsorbed) in patients 
receiving upadacitinib concomitantly.
Update of section 5.1 to reflect the final study results of the 
vaccination study. The influence of upadacitinib on the 
humoral response following the administration of 
inactivated pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine 
(13-valent, adsorbed) was evaluated in 111 patients with 
Page 17/20
rheumatoid arthritis under stable treatment with 
upadacitinib 15 mg (n=87) or 30 mg (n=24). 97% of 
patients (n=108) were on concomitant methotrexate. The 
primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with 
satisfactory humoral response defined as ≥ 2-fold increase 
in antibody concentration from baseline to Week 4 in at 
least 6 out of the 12 pneumococcal antigens (1, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 
7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F). Results at Week 4 
demonstrated a satisfactory humoral response in 67.5% 
(95% CI: 57.4, 77.5) and 56.5% (95% CI: 36.3, 76.8) of 
patients treated with upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg, 
respectively.

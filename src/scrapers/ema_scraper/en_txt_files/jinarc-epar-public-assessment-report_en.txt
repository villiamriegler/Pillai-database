2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Disease background 
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD, previously known as adult polycystic kidney 
disease) is a hereditary disorder characterized by cyst formation and enlargement in the kidney and 
other organs.  ADPKD is the most common genetic condition to affect the kidneys. 
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease demonstrates considerable phenotypic variability. 
The  number,  distribution,  and  growth  rate  of  cysts  determine  the  timing  and  severity  of  related 
clinical outcomes. Some patients experience renal failure soon after the condition is diagnosed, others 
have a mild disease course throughout life.  Clinical features, commonly pain in the abdomen, flank or 
back, usually begin in the third to fourth decade of life, but cysts may be detectable much earlier in life 
as an incidental finding or during screening of affected families. Other symptoms include urinary tract 
infections,  haematuria,  and  pain.  ADPKD  is  characterised  by  progressive  hypertension  and  renal 
impairment.  Up to 50% of patients with ADPKD require renal replacement therapy by 60 years of age, 
and around 10% of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients treated with haemodialysis in Europe 
were initially diagnosed and treated for ADPKD. 
ADKPD has been granted orphan medicinal product status pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
for the treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. 
ADPKD  results  from  loss-of-function  mutations  in  either  of  2  genes  (PKD1  and  PKD2)  encoding 
respectively transmembrane polycystin proteins PC1 (polycystin 1) and PC2 (polycystin 2).  These 
gene  defects  disrupt  the  normal  differentiated  phenotype  of  the  renal  tubular  epithelium.    The 
mutations lead to increases in intracellular adenosine cyclic 3’, 5’-monophosphate (cAMP) resulting in 
increased cellular proliferation and cyst formation. Cyst growth displaces and destroys normal kidney 
tissue, leading to decreased number and function of nephrons.  The cyst initially fills with fluid from 
the glomerular filtrate, but even if the cyst becomes isolated from the tubular system it continues to 
grow as the epithelial wall proliferates and there is transepithelial secretion of water into the lumen. 
Assessment Report 
EMA/154879/2015 
Page 7/124 
 
ADPKD shows a focal expression, which is thought to be due to random mutations of the protective 
normal allele.  
The  commonest  genotype  is  ADPKD  type  1,  accounting  for  around  90%  of  patients,  followed  by 
ADPKD  type  2.  Respectively  these  affect  relate  to  genes  coding  PKD1  and  PKD2.  These  variants 
appear to differ primarily in the number of visible renal cysts formed at any given age. The mean time 
to ESRD for patients with ADPKD1 is 53 years, whilst the mean age for patients with ADPKD2 is 74 
years. As ADPKD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, each child of an affected individual 
has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. About 95% of individuals with ADPKD have an affected 
parent and about 5% have a de novo mutation. Homozygous mutations in either PKD1 or PKD2 are 
not seen, as these are thought to be incompatible with live birth, except for rare cases where there is 
incomplete penetrance. 
Current treatment of ADPKD 
There is a clear unmet need for an effective therapy in APKD. No medication is specifically licensed to 
slow  the  progression  of  kidney  disease  in  these  patients.  Current  drug  therapy  is  focused  on  the 
treatment of symptoms and complications, such as hypertension, pain and infection. As renal function 
progressively worsens, patients who progress to end-stage renal disease will require dialysis or renal 
transplantation  if  clinically  appropriate.  Other  treatments  include  cyst  decompression  with  cyst 
aspiration and sclerosis, laparoscopic or surgical cyst fenestration, and renal denervation.  In cases of 
portal  hypertension  due  to  polycystic  liver  or  hepatomegaly  with  unresectable  areas,  liver 
transplantation may be necessary.  
Other research 
A number of other vasopressin antagonists are in development.  Additional specific renoprotective 
approaches studied include somatostatin analogues, statins, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor 
blockers.   
About the product 
AVP (arginine vasopressin) is a neuropeptide hormone, synthesized in the brain by the hypothalamus 
and  released  into  the  bloodstream  by  the  posterior  pituitary  gland.  Secretion  of  this  hormone  is 
regulated by baroreceptors and osmoreceptors, and is affected by other medications, central nervous 
system  disorders,  infections,  cardiopulmonary  diseases,  and  endocrinopathies.  Three  receptor 
subtypes for AVP have been identified in man: V1a, V1b and V2.  
AVP is actively involved in the regulation of water and solute excretion by the kidney, as well as blood 
pressure control. A decrease in blood pressure or increase in plasma osmolality leads to a marked 
increase  in  blood  AVP  concentrations,  causing  vasoconstriction  (via  V1a  receptors)  and  water 
reabsorption in the kidneys (via V2 receptors).  This potent effect on water reabsorption is reflected 
in the alternative name for AVP of “antidiuretic hormone” (ADH). When the hormone is completely 
absent or unable to activate the antidiuretic receptors, diuresis and water needs are enhanced about 
tenfold.  
Tolvaptan  (previous  company  internal  name  OPC-41061)  is  a  non-peptide  vasopressin  antagonist 
that specifically blocks the binding of AVP at the V2 receptors of the distal nephron.  Tolvaptan affinity 
for the human V2-receptor is 1.8 times that of native AVP. Tolvaptan has a single chiral centre and can 
exist as two enantiomers, which are equipotent at the V2 receptor (see figure 1).

Mechanism of action in ADPKD 
Tolvaptan specifically blocks the binding of pituitary arginine vasopressin (AVP) at the V2 receptors of 
the distal nephron. Tolvaptan affinity for the human V2-receptor is 1.8 times that of native AVP.  
It  is  thought  to  act  selectively  on  the  cells  from  which  ADPKD  cysts  arise.    Stimulation  of  the  V2 
receptor  in  the  distal  nephron  elevates  intracellular  cAMP  levels,  which  is  linked  to  reduced  cell 
proliferation and a decrease of fluid excretion into cysts. 
Successful  treatment  of  disease  progression  in  ADPKD  is  presumed  to  require  early,  chronic  and 
constant  inhibition  of  the  V2  receptor,  as  this  was  required  to  produce  decreased  rates  of  kidney 
growth in animal models. 
Claimed therapeutic indication 
The initially proposed indication for Jinarc was as follows: 
Jinarc  is  indicated  to  slow  the  progression  of  kidney  disease  in  patients  with  autosomal  dominant 
polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Jinarc is indicated in adults. 
Approved therapeutic indication 
Jinarc is indicated to slow the progression of cyst development and renal insufficiency of autosomal 
dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in adults with CKD stage 1 to 3 at initiation of treatment 
with evidence of rapidly progressing disease (see Section 5.1). 
Proposed posology 
The  proposed  dose  is  to  be  titrated  and  given  twice  daily  in  unequal  doses  –  referred  to  by  the 
applicant as “split dosing”.  
The proposed initial dosage for Jinarc is 60 mg tolvaptan per day as a split-dose regimen - 45 mg 
taken upon waking and 15 mg taken 8 hours later. This initial dose is proposed to be titrated upward 
to a split-dose regimen of 60 mg + 30 mg, and then to a target regimen of 90 mg + 30 mg, if tolerated, 
with  at  least  weekly  intervals  between  titrations.  Accordingly,  these  correspond  to  total  daily 
tolvaptan doses of 60, 90, or 120 mg. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This  is  an  application  in  accordance  with  article  8  (3)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  as  amended,  for 
approval of Jinarc through the centralised procedure. 
The designated orphan indication is “Treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease”. An 
application for accelerated approval pursuant to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 was 
submitted  previously,  but  not  granted  due  to  the  complexity  of  the  dossier  requiring  detailed 
evaluation. 
No other medication is licensed in the EU to slow the progression of kidney disease in ADPKD. An 
indication in ADPKD was approved in Japan in March 2014 
Tolvaptan tablets 15 and 30 mg have a separate MA (Samsca, EU/1/09/539/001-004, licenced on 03 
August  2009  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  hyponatraemia  secondary  to  syndrome  of 
inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion.  The maximum daily dose in this indication is 60 mg per 
day. Clinical pharmacology trials relevant for the Jinarc MAA include single dose (15-480 mg) and 
multiple dose (up to 30 mg daily) healthy volunteer studies, drug interaction studies and a QT study. 
Tolvaptan  has  been  investigated  clinically  in  Japan  since  1994,  in  Europe  and  the  US  since  1996. 
Whilst the target population, dose and treatment duration for the ADPKD indication are different, the 
Samsca programme and subsequent post-marketing data offer some supporting safety information. 
Tolvaptan has also been studied in heart failure patients; however this indication was not accepted by 
CHMP in 2009. The safety dataset for the Samsca MAA consisted of 3294 subjects treated with any 
dose of tolvaptan, and 817 subjects treated with tolvaptan in placebo-controlled trials for 1 year or 
more.

Scientific Advice 
Advice was sought from CHMP on 18/11/5 (EMEA/386179/2005).  Key questions included the need 
for  data  in  varying  degrees  of  renal  impairment,  dose  selection  for  the  pivotal  trial,  the  choice  of 
primary efficacy endpoint, the acceptability of 1 pivotal trial, and the supportive value of safety data 
from other study programmes. In general the advice has been followed for the development program.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Tolvaptan is synthesized in 3 main steps using well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: description, identity (IR, UV and HPLC), melting 
point, heavy metals (USP), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), loss on drying (USP), 
residue  on  ignition  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  (HPLC),  specific  optical  rotation  (Ph.  Eur.),  microbial  limit 
(Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis data (including 11 production size batches) of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability  data  on  3  commercial-scale  batches  of  active  substance  from  one  of  the  proposed 
manufacturing  sites  stored  in  the  intended  commercial  package    for  60  months  under  long  term 
conditions at 30ºC / 65% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The  following  parameters  were  tested:  description,  identification  (IR  and  HPLC),  melting  point, 
impurities (HPLC), assay (HPLC) and loss on drying. The analytical methods used were the same as 
for release and were stability indicating. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Results on stress 
conditions: 60 ºC in closed amber glass bottle and 25ºC / 90% RH in open dish during 3 months were 
also provided on one batch. 
The result of photostability study indicates that the active substance is stable to light. The data from 
the open dish studies and elevated temperature study (60 ºC) demonstrate the stability of the drug 
substance to heat and humidity. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  drug  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  suppliers  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container.

Tolvaptan tablets have been developed as immediate-release uncoated tablets of 15 mg, 30 mg, 45 
mg, 60 mg and 90 mg strengths.  The immediate release formulation of tolvaptan 15 mg and 30 mg 
tablets  is  the  same  approved  in  2009  in  MAA  as  Samsca  (EMA/H/C/980)  for  the  treatment  of 
hyponatremia. The  15  mg  and  30  mg  strengths  are  dose  proportional  with  regard  to  the  active

substance  and  excipients.  The  45  mg  and  90  mg  strengths  of  tablets  were  designed  to  be 
quantitatively proportional with the 60-mg tablets. 
Given  that  tolvaptan  is  practically  insoluble  in  water  and  shows  no  pH  dependence  of  solubility, 
studies were focused on dissolution enhancement.  
All excipients are well-known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards.  There  are  no  novel  excipients  used  in  the  finished  product  formulation.  The  list  of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
A number of formulations were used during development and a series of bioavailability studies have 
been  presented  to  summarise  the  clinical/formulation  development  and  to  compare  the 
bioequivalence (BE) of those formulations used in Phase I/II/III studies. With the exception of the 
colourant, the 30 mg tablet used in phase II & III studies is the same as the commercial formulation. 
The 15 mg tablet is dose proportional to the 30 mg tablet and in vitro dissolution data are comparable.  
The 60 mg tablet was demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the 15 mg and 30 mg tablet strengths and 
in addition, bioequivalence was confirmed between 30 mg and 90 mg tablets.  Since the 45 mg and 
90 mg tablets are quantitatively proportional, and comparison of dissolution profiles demonstrated 
the  dissolution  equivalency  of  45  mg  and  90  mg  tablets,  a  bio-waiver  can  be  applied  for  45  mg 
strength. 
Information on the development of the dissolution method and selection of the dissolution media was 
provided.  The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
The  capability  of  conversion  to  crystalline  form  from  amorphous  tolvaptan  is  a  critical  point  of 
pharmaceutical  development  and  pharmaceutical  process  because  a  solid  state  transition  can 
significantly  affect  dissolution  and  bioavailability;  this  is  controlled  during  manufacture  by  X-ray 
diffraction. The in vitro dissolution method included in the specification is used as a quality control and 
also as an indirect method of evaluating any crystallisation of the active substance. The data provided 
suggest that no amorphous crystalline conversion occurs during manufacture or storage. 
During development two wet-granulation methods (fluid bed granulation and high-shear granulation) 
and a semi direct compression method were compared. The effect of high humidity and temperature 
on the stability of amorphous form in tablets was evaluated. No significant differences were observed 
in dissolution profiles of the tablets manufactured by each method, demonstrating that the exposure 
of tolvaptan powder to high humidity and high temperature has little impact on the stability of the 
tolvaptan powder. Fluid bed granulation was identified to be suitable for the granulation. Apart from 
the change from fine granules (sachet formulation) to tablet dosage there have been no significant 
changes to the manufacturing process except for the increase of batch scale.  The same granules and 
the same manufacturing process for 15 mg and 30 mg tablets are used.  The same granules for 60 mg 
tablets are used for 45 and 90 mg tablets. Manufacturing processes for the 45 and 90 mg tablets are 
the same as those for 60 mg tablets except for tableting step where the appropriate tooling for each 
tablet strength is used. 
The  primary  packaging  is  PVC/aluminium  foil  blister.  The  material  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  and  EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  two  main  steps:  preparation  of  tolvaptan  powder,  and 
subsequent granulation and tablets compression. The manufacturing process does not involve novel 
processes  but  several  steps  are  considered  as  critical  to  ensure  the  solubility  and  hence,  the 
bioavailability of the active substance: granulation/drying, lubrication/final blending and compression. 
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process.

Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on minimum three pilot scale batches 
of each strength. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing 
the  finished  product  of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
The  manufacturing  process  of  the  45,  60  and  90  mg  tablets  will  be  validated  at  the  proposed 
commercial production scale according to an appropriate validation scheme provided prior to product 
launch.  
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form:  
description, identification (HPLC), impurities/degradation products (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units 
(HPLC), dissolution, assay HPLC and microbial limits (Ph.Eur.).  
In-house analytical methods have been developed and are described in detail; all methods have been 
fully validated.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  three  pilot  scale  batches  of  each  strength  confirming  the 
consistency  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  its  ability  to  manufacture  to  the  intended  product 
specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three batches of finished product for each strength that are at least pilot scale batches 
stored under long term conditions for up to 48 months (15, 30 and 60 mg)/24 month (45, 90 mg) at 
25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to 
the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches are identical to those proposed for marketing and were 
packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested according to release specifications. The primary stability protocols also include 
tests for friability, disintegration, water content, hardness, and microbial limit.  
In addition, one batch of each strength as well as loose tablets were exposed to light as defined in the 
ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The results indicate 
that increases in  one oxidative degradation product were observed for the 15mg, 30mg 60mg tablets 
stored in open petri dish. No similar increase was observed for the 45mg and 90mg tablets however 
for 90-mg strength, a slight change of appearance from blue to greenish blue was observed under 
open dish study. Photostability results also demonstrate that the product packaged in the 
PVC/aluminium foil blister is not light sensitive. 
Additional stress stability studies were performed. The data from the elevated temperature study 
(50˚C) demonstrate the stability of tablets to heat. In the data from the open dish studies at high 
humidity, moisture increase and decrease in hardness were observed. For tablet stored in 
PVC/aluminium blisters a slight increase in moisture content is observed but all other parameters 
remained unaffected. The data from the cycling studies (-15 ˚C to +40 ˚C /75% RH / one cycle) 
indicate that the product is not affected by temperature excursions. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
Additionally, stability study was conducted on tolvaptan powder intermediate and on bulk tablet. The 
data support the proposed holding times.

2.3.1.  Introduction 
Tolvaptan  (also  referred  to  as  OPC-41061  or  OPC-156),  a  V2-receptor  (V2R)  antagonist,  was 
approved  in  Europe  for  the  treatment  of  clinically  significant  hypervolemic  and  euvolemic 
hyponatremia  (MA  EU/1/09/539/001-004).  For  the  current  MAA,  Otsuka  is  seeking  approval  for 
tolvaptan  for  the  treatment  of  autosomal  dominant  polycystic  kidney  disease  (ADPKD).  The 
non-clinical  testing  for  tolvaptan  is  supported  in  part  on  the  non-clinical  results  from  previous 
non-clinical  studies  conducted  to  support  the  approved  indication  for  clinically  significant 
hypervolemic and euvolemic hyponatremia.  
Arginine  vasopressin  (AVP)  is  a  neuropeptide  hormone  synthesised  in  the  hypothalamus  and  the 
axons extend into the posterior pituitary where the hormone is released into the blood stream. Central 
nervous system (CNS) disorders, infections, cardiopulmonary diseases, endocrinopathies and other 
disease conditions may affect the secretion of AVP. 
Increases in plasma osmolality or a decrease in blood pressure can also lead to a marked increase in 
blood  AVP  concentrations.  AVP  can  cause  vasoconstriction  via  V1a-receptors  and  promote  water 
reabsorption in the kidneys via V2R, both of which are G-protein-coupled transmembrane receptors. 
The V2R are primarily responsible for the antidiuretic effect of AVP. 
PKD  is  an  inherited  renal  disease  that  exhibits  profound  morphological  disorganisation  that  is 
exemplified  by  abnormal  cellular  proliferation  and  apoptosis  of  immature  epithelial  cells, 
accumulation of fluid within the cysts, abnormal cell/cell-matrix interactions and cilia function.1,2 In 
the  human  population,  the  most  clinically  significant  type  of  PKD  is  inherited  as  an  autosomal 
dominant trait (ADPKD). Approximately 85% of ADPKD is caused by a mutation in the PKD1 gene and 
15% by mutation in the PKD2 gene. Although less common but still clinically significant is autosomal

recessive PKD (ARPKD). ARPKD is associated with a mutation in the polycystic kidney and hepatic 
disease-1 (PKHD1) gene.3,4 Cystic enlargement is mediated by increased and persistent epithelial cell 
proliferation due to the mitogenic action associated with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) as 
well  as  active  secretion  of  fluid  into  the  lumen  mediated  by  apically  located  cystic  fibrosis 
transmembrane  conductance  regulator  (CFTR)  chloride  channels.5  Inhibition  of  V2R  reduces  renal 
cAMP levels that lead to an inhibition of cyst formation and kidney enlargement.6,7 In several studies, 
vasopressin V2R antagonists have demonstrated efficacy in PKD by decreasing intracellular levels of 
cAMP which reportedly plays a major role in cyst formation by promoting transepithelial fluid secretion 
and stimulating cyst-derived cell proliferation.6,8,9

kidney ERK activity and kidney aquaporin-2 mRNA 
level were significantly decreased. A dose-related 
increase in serum concentrations of tolvaptan was 
observed. 
Mice were treated for 2 weeks (7 weeks of age at

concentrations increased with dietary concentration. 
The highest concentrations were observed on Day 
14 at the midnight blood sample collection with 
comparable levels observed at the morning 
collection. At 0.01% in male and female pcy mice at

from 4weeks of age to 20 weeks of age, 
subsequently, left kidney volume was maintained 
constant to the end of study (29weeks of age); by the 
end of the study (20 weeks of age) the maximal left 
kidney volume was 702 mm3 in OPC-41061- treated 
pcy mice compared to 354 mm3 in normal controls 
and 1113 mm3 in pcy control mice. Increased urine 
volume and decreased urine osmolality were observed 
during the study in the OPC-41061-treated mice. 
OPC-41061 significantly decreased urine albumin 
excretion compared to pcy 
controls. BUN tended to increase in pcy control and 
OPC-41061-treated mice during the study, compared 
to normal mice. Urinary AVP levels in pcy control 
mice and OPC-41061-treated mice were generally 
similar throughout the study, and the 
levels were higher than normal control mice. Plasma 
electrolytes and osmolality were similar for pcy 
control mice and OPC-41061-treated mice. 
OPC-41061 lowered renal cAMP and exerted a 
protective effect on the development of PKD as 
reflected by significantly lower kidney weights, cyst 
and fibrosis volumes, and mitotic and apoptotic 
indices. 
OPC-41061 was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg 
once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) by gavage. 
Suppressive effects of OPC-41061 against the 
progression of PKD were not observed when OPC- 
41061 was administered orally at 10 mg/kg QD or 
BID in male PCK rats.

In the PCK rat, an animal model of ARPKD, oral administration of tolvaptan resulted in a decrease in 
kidney levels of cAMP and a reduction in cyst volume and cyst fibrosis. Increases in urine volume and 
water  intake  and  decreased  urinary  osmolality  also  were  evident  and  are  consistent  with  the 
established pharmacological action of tolvaptan. Slight changes in BUN, creatinine, and sodium levels 
were  observed  in  the  treated  rats,  although  the  changes  were  not  considered  to  be  biologically 
meaningful. 
In the mouse models for ADPKD (Pkd2WS25/-, pcy and cpk) similar results are observed as with the 
PCK rat. Decreases in kidney weights, cyst volume, and fibrotic volume were observed in the pcy 
mouse and the Pkd2WS25/- mouse treated with tolvaptan via the diet. With prolonged treatment of 
the  pcy  mouse  with  tolvaptan  for  26  weeks,  decreases  in  BUN  were  observed  in  both  males  and 
females. Decreases in BUN were also observed in Pkd2WS25/- mice treated with tolvaptan for 12 
weeks.  Similarly,  prolonged  treatment  of  pcy  mice  with  tolvaptan  for  25  weeks  resulted  in  a 
significant  decline  in  kidney  volume  compared  to  untreated  control  pcy  mice.  In  male  pcy  mice, 
tolvaptan at 0.01% to 0.3% in the diet resulted in a dose dependent decreased kidney weight, cyst 
volume, fibrotic volume and mitotic index. Tolvaptan also showed a dose-dependent aquaretic action 
at the same dose range. Maximum renal-protective effect and aquaretic effect were observed at 0.1%. 
Furthermore, consistent with the reduced kidney volume, a dose-related reduction in kidney cAMP 
content and ERK activity were observed in pcy mice compared to controls. Serum levels of tolvaptan 
were determined in the pcy mice treated via the diet for 2 weeks. Serum levels of tolvaptan increased 
with dietary concentration, and the levels tended to be higher at midnight. These data demonstrate 
exposure to tolvaptan in the pcy mouse at pharmacologically active doses. 
In vitro studies examined cell proliferation in normal human kidney cells (NHK) and cells obtained 
from ADPKD patients. The addition of AVP to NHK cultures resulted in an inhibition of cell proliferation. 
Addition of AVP to ADPKD cultures resulted in increased proliferation with a corresponding increase in 
cAMP.  This  series  of  in  vitro  experiments  show  that  tolvaptan  inhibits  the  cellular  proliferation 
response in human ADPKD cyst epithelial cells at concentrations that can be achieved in the plasma of 
ADPKD patients. It appears cAMP plays a key role in cellular proliferation through AVP that activates 
G-proteins. Activation of the kinase pathway in turn stimulates the expression of P-BRAF and P-ERK, 
leading to initiation of the cell cycle, leading to an increase in cell division. Tolvaptan modulates the 
increase in cell division, and therefore cyst formation in  ADPKD, by inhibiting the accumulation of 
cAMP, and interferes with the mitogenic action of AVP. Tolvaptan also inhibited AVP-induced chloride 
secretion and decreased in vitro cyst growth of ADPKD cells.

Secondary  pharmacodynamic  studies  included  animal  models  of  cirrhosis  and  oedema.  Tolvaptan 
improved the appearance of oedema and ascites. These effects are considered consistent with the 
increase in free water clearance observed with tolvaptan. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
A core battery of safety pharmacology studies as indicated in CPMP/ICH/539/00 Note for Guidance 
was  conducted  for  the  application  related  to  the  tolvaptan  indication  in  adult  patients  with 
hyponatraemia secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).  
The main results are following described from the AR adopted by the CHMP. Those studies conducted 
after publication of the guidance were carried out in compliance with GLP. 
Tolvaptan at oral doses of up to 1000 mg/kg had no effects on the central nervous system in mice, 
that is, no proconvulsive, analgesic or sedative effects, or effects on general behaviour, motor activity, 
or body temperature.  
Cardiovascular  effects  were  studied  in  vivo  and  in  vitro.  In  anaesthetised  dogs,  heart  rate  and 
respiration  rate  increased  and  blood  pressure  decreased  at  10  mg/kg  intravenously,  but  these 
parameters were unaffected in conscious dogs following oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg, at which dose 
the serum Cmax for tolvaptan was 2.83 μg/ml. T-wave amplitude of the EGC decreased at this dose, 
and following a 10 mg/kg intravenous dose in anaesthetised animals. In vitro studies in guinea pig 
papillary muscle and CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with the hERG channel showed tolvaptan had no 
effect on action potential parameters or hERG current at concentrations up to 3x10-5M and 2x10-6M, 
respectively. There were no effects on gastrointestinal motility in vivo or in vitro at clinically relevant 
concentrations.  
Metabolites DM-4103 and DM-4107 were tested for respiratory and cardiovascular effects in dogs, 
behavioural  effects  in  mice  and  inhibition  of  the  hERG  current  in  vitro.  The  only  finding  was  an 
increased ST segment in the ECG in dogs with DM-4107 following an intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg 
(serum concentration 70.1 μg/ml). 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic studies in normal rats and dogs and in congestive heart failure (CHF) dogs with 
tolvaptan  and  furosemide  suggest  that  the  aquaretic  effect  of  tolvaptan  is  still  evident  when 
coadministered with furosemide. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
3  supplemental  studies  regarding  preparation  of  radiolabeled  tolvaptan,  stability  and  analytical 
validation for tolvaptan, and 1 additional tissue distribution study were completed. 
Study report ref. 023793 Stability test of OPC-41061 and its metabolites DM-4103, and DM-4107 in 
rat serum using LC-ESI-MS/MS 
Long-term stability of OPC-41061 and its metabolites DM-4103 and DM-4107 in the rat serum were 
determined. 1 The data revealed that OPC-41061 and two metabolites in the rat serum were stable for 
at  least  6  weeks  when  stored  at  -15°C  or  below.  OPC-41061  and  its  metabolites  DM-4103  and 
DM-4107 in the stock solution were stable for at least 9 weeks when stored at 10°C or below under 
protection from light. 
Study  report  ref.  023613  Validation  of  assay  method  for  OPC-41061  in  mouse  serum  using 
LC-ESI-MS/MS 
A  supplemental  study  on  analytical  validation  for  determining  OPC-41061 in  the  mouse  serum  by 
LC-ESI-MS/MS2 (new assay conditions using a new system) was also included. The calibration curve 
of OPC-41061 ranged from 5 to 500 ng/mL. The LLOQ for OPC-41061 in the serum samples was 5 
ng/mL.  The  intra-day  and  inter-day  precisions  were  within  4.0%  and  2.9%  of  the  coefficient  of

variation (CV) for the analyte in the serum samples. The intra-day accuracies were 97.1% to 101.5% 
and  the  inter-day  accuracies  were  98.1%  to  100.9%,  respectively.  OPC-41061  in  the  processed 
samples stored at 10°C was stable for 48 hours. 
In the tissue distribution study (see below), the serum concentration of radioactivity was determined 
following  single  oral  administration  of  14C-OPC-41061  suspension  at  30  mg/kg  to  the  fasted  male 
Long-Evens rats. The Cmax and AUC∞ were 8.384 µg eq/mL and 162.0 µg eq⋅h/mL, and t max and t1/2 
were 2.0 and 54.94 hours, respectively.  
Study  report  ref.  021883  Tissue  distribution  of  radioactivity  following  single  oral  administration 
of 14C-OPC-41061 at 30 mg/kg to Male Long-Evans Rats 
The radioactivity concentrations in the tissues were determined following a single oral administration 
of  14C-OPC-41061 suspension at 30 mg/kg to the fasted male Long-Evans rats for the purpose of 
investigating the tissue distribution of radioactivity in the pigmented rats. 
The radioactivity concentrations in the tissues were determined following single oral administration 
of  14C-OPC-41061  suspension  at  30  mg/kg  to  the  fasted  male  Long-Evans  rats.  3  In  the 
melanin-containing tissues (eyeball and pigmented skin), the radioactivity concentrations were lower 
than those in the serum, the ratios of the tissues to the serum were 0.045 to 0.228 at all time-points. 
The radioactivity concentration in the pigmented skin was similar to that in the non-pigmented skin. 
The radioactivity concentrations in the liver, brown fat, blood, kidney, fat and muscle were similar to 
or less than that of the serum. The radioactivity in all tissues decreased gradually. In the serum, the 
Cmax, t max, t 1/2, AUCt, AUC ∞, Cl/F and Vz/F were 8.384 µg eq/mL, 2.0 hours, 54.94 hours, 150.7 µg 
eq·h/mL, 162.0 µg eq·h/mL , 185.2 mL/h/kg and 14680 mL/kg, respectively. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Tolvaptan had low acute toxicity when administered to rats and dogs at 2000 mg/kg, the only findings 
being the presence of white material in the faeces and reduced food consumption. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Please refer to toxicokinetic chapter below. 
Genotoxicity 
The battery of genotoxicity studies were conducted appropriately and yielded negative results. 
Previous studies have demonstrated exposure to  tolvaptan at the doses used in the in vivo studies. 
Tolvaptan is not considered to be genotoxic. 
Carcinogenicity 
Two-year studies in mice and rats were conducted. In neither study was there an indication of 
increased incidence of neoplastic lesions in relation to treatment with tolvaptan at doses up to 60 or 
100 mg/kg/day in male and female mice, respectively, or up to 1000 mg/kg/day in rats. At the high 
doses in these studies, the AUC was 0.9- and 1.3- times that in man in male and female mice, 
respectively, and 3.9- and 10.4-times that in man in male and female rats, respectively. Therefore 
only in the rat study did serum levels of the parent compound exceed those in humans. However, 
despite the absence of safety margins in exposure in the mouse study, given the negative results of 
the genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies, overall tolvaptan is not considered to be carcinogenic. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Teratogenicity  was  noted  in  rabbits  given  1000 mg/kg/day  (7.5  times  the  exposure  from  the 
120 mg/day  human  dose  on  an  AUC  basis).  No  teratogenic  effects  were  seen  in  rabbits  at 
300 mg/kg/day (about 1.25 to 2.65 times the exposure in humans at the 120 mg/day dose, based on 
AUC). 
Assessment Report 
EMA/154879/2015 
Page 24/124 
 
In a peri- and post-natal study in rats, delayed ossification and reduced pup bodyweight were seen at 
the high dose of 1000 mg/kg/day.  
Two fertility studies in rats showed effects on the parental generation (decreased food consumption 
and body weight gain, salivation), but tolvaptan did not affect reproductive performance in males and 
there were no effects on the foetuses. In females, abnormal oestrus cycles were seen in both studies. 
The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for effects on reproduction in females (100 mg/kg/day) 
was about 8-times the maximum human recommended dose of 120 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Tolvaptan  is  extensively  metabolised  in  humans  with  unchanged  drug  accounting  for  <3%  of  the 
administered  dose.  The  major  human  metabolite  of  tolvaptan  is  DM-4103,  and  accounts  for 
approximately  50%  of  the  plasma  radioactivity  with  administration  of  radiolabeled  tolvaptan.14 
Therefore, the safety margin of exposure for DM-4103 was determined at the highest dose for toxicity 
studies.  The  AUC  for  DM-4103  in  humans  was  estimated  from  plasma  concentrations  for  ADPKD 
patients treated with tolvaptan for about 3 years at the MHRD (90+30 mg).15 
Table 5 – Safety margins relating to tolvaptan for ADPKD patients treated with tolvaptan 
Assessment Report 
EMA/154879/2015 
Page 25/124 
 
 
Table 6 – Safety margins relating to DM-4103 for ADPKD patients treated with tolvaptan 
In spite of the low safety margins associated with some studies, no notable toxicity was observed in 
a single dose subcutaneous toxicity study.16 In this study, rats were treated with subcutaneous doses 
up  to  500  mg/kg.  No  changes  were  noted  in  body  weight  or  food  consumption.  Bloody  urine  and 
scabs/alopecia at the injection site were observed in several treated and control animals that was 
attributed to the vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide). 
At necropsy, a white substance was noted in the subcutis at the injection site of all animals given 
DM-4103. The amount of  the material appeared to be increased in a dose-related manner. These 
results suggested that the serum concentration of DM-4103 was positively correlated with the amount 
of absorption at the injection site. 
Exposure to DM-4103 (AUC0-24h) was higher in animals given 100 mg/kg (743 μg h/mL) than in 
animals given 500 mg/kg (319 μg h/mL). In a separate study, the serum concentration of DM-4103 
at 4 hours after subcutaneous administration was higher at 100 mg/kg compared to 500 mg/kg.17 
Overall,  these  data  suggest  that  DM-4103  has  low  toxicity  at  exposures  that  are  greater  than 
expected  with  repeated  dosing  in  patients.  Therefore,  DM-4103  appears  to  be  adequately 
characterised in toxicity studies with tolvaptan. 
Local Tolerance 
N/A 
Other toxicity studies 
In vitro phototoxicity studies showed tolvaptan and metabolite DM-4107 to have weak or very little 
phototoxic  potential.  Tolvaptan  did  not  show  any  phototoxicity  in  vivo  in  guinea  pigs  and  rabbits 
following  repeated  oral  doses  of  up  to  2000  mg/kg  and  1000  mg/kg,  respectively.  Metabolite 
DM-4103 did show phototoxic potential in vitro however. The concentrations of the metabolites as 
well as of the parent compound were measured in the tissues in the in vivo studies. DM-4103 was 
present at <0.125 μg/g in the guinea pig study, but up to about 6 μg/g in the rabbit study. The in vivo 
studies  provide  some  reassurance  that  hototoxicity  might  not  occur  as  a  result  of  exposure  to 
DM-4103, and the distribution study in partially pigmented Long-Evans rats showed that tolvaptan 
and  its  metabolites  have  little  affinity  for  melanin.  Consequently,  the  potential  for  phototoxicity 
reactions occurring in man is considered to be low.

An  ERA  for  tolvaptan  describing  a  predicted  environmental  concentration  of  0.3  μg/L  was  already 
submitted with the initial approved MAA for Samsca. The applicant has provided the updated ERA 
documentation, including a study on sediment dwelling organisms.  
In order to support further the environmental risk assessment the identification of the transformation 
product M1 occurring in a water sediment study is needed. Generation of this data take approximately 
12 months and exceed the time of the procedure.  
As a result of the above considerations, the available data do not allow to conclude definitively on the 
potential risk of Tolvaptan to the environment.  
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed: To identify the transformation product M1 
occurring in a water sediment study. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  non-clinical  testing  for  tolvaptan  for  human  ADPKD  is  supported  based  on  the  results  from 
previous  non-clinical  studies  conducted  to  support  the  Samsca  indication  for  clinically  significant 
hypervolemic and euvolemic hyponatremia (MA EU/1/09/539/001-004).  
Taken  together,  the  pharmacodynamic  data  demonstrate  that  tolvaptan  reduced  the  total  kidney 
volume in rat and mouse  models of PKD based on reductions of kidney weights and reduced cyst 
formation. Furthermore, with the reduced kidney levels of cAMP, the data indicate that tolvaptan is 
acting as an inhibitor of the V2R. 
A  few  additional  pharmacokinetic  studies  have  been  performed.  The  findings  from  the  tissue 
distribution  study  in  Long  Evans  rats  indicated  that  in  melanin-containing  tissues  (eyeball  and 
pigmented skin), the radioactivity concentrations were lower than those in the serum, the ratios of 
these tissues to the serum were 0.045 to 0.228 at all time-points. The radioactivity in the pigmented 
skin was similar to that in the non-pigmented skin. The radioactivity concentrations in the liver, brown 
fat, blood, kidney, fat and muscle were similar to or less than that of the serum. The radioactivity in 
all tissues decreased gradually.  
The toxicity of tolvaptan in animals was characterised in a non-clinical program of single and repeat 
dose oral studies in mice, rats, and dogs, a battery of genotoxicity studies, carcinogenicity studies in 
rodents, reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in 2 species, mechanistic studies, ocular and 
dermal irritation studies in rabbits, an antigenicity study in guinea pigs, an immunotoxicity study in 
rats, and phototoxicity studies.  
Tolvaptan  is  extensively  metabolised  in  humans  with  unchanged  drug  accounting  for  <3%  of  the 
administered  dose.  The  major  human  metabolite  of  tolvaptan  is  DM-4103,  and  accounts  for 
approximately  50%  of  the  plasma  radioactivity  with  administration  of  radiolabeled  tolvaptan. 
Therefore,  the  margin  of  exposure  for  DM-4103  was  determined  at  the  highest  dose  for  toxicity 
studies.  The  AUC  for  DM-4103  in  humans  was  estimated  from  plasma  concentrations  for  ADPKD 
patients treated with tolvaptan for about 3 years at the MHRD (90+30 mg). 
Safety margins for tolvaptan and the main metabolite were generally equal to or exceeded human 
exposure at the recommended human dose (RHD) for general toxicity, toxicity to reproduction and 
development and/or carcinogenicity. The safety margins in male and female rats are 1.9 and 3.2-fold 
respectively, relative to the exposure in humans at the maximum recommended human dose for PKD 
(120 mg; AUC24h 6570 ng∙h/mL in the 26 week rat toxicity study). The no adverse effect level in the 
1 year dog toxicity study resulted in a safety margin in males and females of 4.8 fold and 6.4 fold, 
respectively, relative to the exposure in humans at the maximum recommended human dose for PKD 
(120  mg;  AUC24h  6570  ng∙h/mL.  The  safety  margin  for  carcinogenicity  in  rodents  relative  to  the 
exposure in humans at the maximum recommended human dose for PKD (120 mg; AUC24h 6570 
Assessment Report 
EMA/154879/2015 
Page 28/124 
 
ng∙h/mL) is 1.9- and 5.1-fold in male and female rats and <1 in mice. A justification relating to the low 
exposures seen in mice compared to human exposure at the RHD has been provided for tolvaptan and 
DM-4103. The results from repeat dose studies in mice indicated that the mouse was a more sensitive 
rodent species for the toxicity of tolvaptan than rats. In the 2-year rodent bioassays there were no 
neoplastic or non-neoplastic pathological changes up to the maximum tolerated dose in mice and at 
exposures of tolvaptan and DM-4103 comparable or higher (0.9- to 5.1-fold) than those at the MRHD. 
Neither tolvaptan nor DM-4103 was genotoxic and thus overall, these data suggest that tolvaptan was 
not carcinogenic. 
Given that the mechanism of the teratogenic effects in rabbits has not been elucidated and the safety 
margin for tolvaptan in rats is reduced further in the current application, it is agreed that tolvaptan 
should remain contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation and in line with the Samsca labelling.  
Exposure  margins  relating  to  reproductive  toxicity  have  been  recalculated  based  on  the  newly 
proposed posology and reflected in the SmPC. Overall; tolvaptan is unlikely to pose serious safety 
concerns for chronic oral administration to patients at the daily recommended human dose of 120mg. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  applicant  has  provided  primary  and  secondary  pharmacology  studies  in  support  of  the  new 
indication. Further stability and validation PK studies have been provided. Recalculation of the safety 
margins in the preclinical species has been conducted based on the higher dose of 120mg compared 
to the previous approved dose. There was no carcinogenic signal in the initial bioassays conducted in 
rodents and tolvaptan is not genotoxic. Tolvaptan is contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation 
due to safety margins and lack of mechanistic information.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
In vitro clinical pharmacology studies included plasma protein binding studies and studies with liver 
microsome preparations/P-gp.  
The  healthy  subject  PK/PD  clinical  trials  included  single  dose  studies  ranging  from  5  to  480  mg 
(including studies 156-98-210, 156-98-229, 156-98-001 and 156-98-003).  Multiple dose data were 
also obtained from healthy subjects (study 146-00-003, 156-95-305, 156-03-245), the highest dose 
being 300 mg once daily for 5 days administered in the QT study (156-03-245). A mass balance study 
was also performed (156-97-202). 
Drug-drug interaction trials in healthy subjects assessed the effects of CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors, 
plus the effect of tolvaptan on sensitive CYP3A4 and P-gp substrates.  Additional interaction studies 
were performed with warfarin, diuretics and amiodarone. 
ADPKD program – healthy volunteer studies 
For the ADPKD program there were 3 clinical pharmacology trials in healthy volunteers.  The most 
important is study 156-11-295, which looked at bioequivalence of the 90 mg formulation and the food 
effect  at  this  dose.    Study  156-KOA-0801  was  a  single  dose  study  in  Korean  subjects.    Study 
156-07-262 is mentioned for completeness; however this was predominantly for a modified release 
formulation not relevant to this application. 
ADPKD program – patient studies 
There were 6 clinical pharmacology trials specifically in ADPKD subjects.  
Single dose PK/PD: studies 156-04-248 and 156-04-01 
Multiple dose PK/PD: 156-04-249 and 156-09-285  
Renal impairment studies: 156-06-260, 156-09-284 
In study 156-09-285, only data with the immediate release tablet are relevant.  
There was an additional study in patients with varying degrees of renal function (156-09-282) which 
did not enrol any ADPKD patients.  
Absorption  
Tolvaptan drug substance is practically insoluble in water (0.00005 w/v% at 25°C) and the solubility 
is pH independent. However the potential for low absorption due to poor solubility has been addressed 
by the pharmaceutical development of the tablets. After oral administration, tolvaptan tablets were 
shown to be rapidly absorbed in healthy volunteers with peak plasma concentrations occurring about 
2 hours after dosing. Absolute BA was determined by the oral/i.v. ratio of dose-normalised AUC0-∞ 
after oral administration of 30 mg tolvaptan as tablet and i.v. administration of 1 mg (1 h infusion).  
The  absolute  bioavailability  of  tolvaptan  was  56%,  with  a  range  of  42-80%  (study  156-05-254).  
Following single oral doses of ≥ 300 mg, peak plasma concentrations appeared to plateau, possibly 
due to saturation of absorption. 
Bioequivalence  
The previously authorised Samsca product is only available in 15 and 30 mg strengths to meet the 
approved  hyponatraemia  posology,  although  in  the  Samsca  development  program,  relative 
bioavailability was also established between 15, 30 and 60mg tablets (study 156-01-233) 
45  and  90  mg  tablets  have  been  newly  developed  for  the  proposed  ADPKD  MAA.    A  new 
bioequivalence study was conducted with the 90 mg tablet (Study 156-11-295, part 1). This was an 
open-label,  2-period,  randomized,  crossover  trial.  Forty-four  healthy  subjects  were  enrolled  and 
completed the trial. On Days 1 and 5, subjects were given tolvaptan as either 3 x 30 mg tablets or 1 
Assessment Report 
EMA/154879/2015 
Page 37/124 
 
x 90 mg tablet in a randomized, crossover fashion. All doses were given fasted. Serial blood samples 
were taken for 72 hours postdose. 
Table 3: Bioequivalence Study 156-11-295: summary of PK parameters  
Figure 2: Bioequivalence Study 156-11-295: 3 x 30 mg tablets vs.  1 x 90 mg Tablet 
45 and 90 mg tablets have been newly developed for the proposed ADPKD MAA.  A single 90 mg tablet 
with  the  proposed  commercial  formulation  was  dose  strength  equivalent  to  three  30  mg  tablets 
(approved  formulation  per  the  Samsca  MAA)  for  Cmax  and  AUC0-72  based  on  the  standard 
bioequivalence criteria.  
The biowaiver request for the 45mg tablet strength is accepted.  It is quantitatively proportional to the 
90mg and 60mg strengths, is qualitatively the same and is manufactured at the same sites using the 
same methods. Tolvaptan has linear pharmacokinetics for single doses of 15 to 90 mg.

Influence of food 
Co-administration  with  food  had  no  significant  or  clinically  relevant  food  effect  on  plasma 
concentrations, with both the 30 and 60 mg tablet (studies 156-00-002, 156-00-242)  
The bioequivalence study noted above had 2 extra arms to evaluate food effect with the 90 mg tablet. 
This  was  a  randomized,  open-label,  crossover  comparison  in  14  subjects  and  showed  that  the 
geometric mean ratios and 90% CI for the fed to fasted comparison met the bioequivalence criteria 
for AUCt and AUCinf, but not Cmax.  The t1/2 is also shorter in the fed state.

A conventional design high fat meal as defined in FDA guidelines was used in this study to assess the 
food effect at 90 mg, the highest proposed dose for Jinarc. A high-fat meal increased absorption and 
Cmax values of tolvaptan; this was not seen with previous food interaction studies at the 30 and 60 
mg  dose.    Following  single  doses  of  30,  60  and  90  mg  the  mean  fold  changes  in  Cmax  were 
respectively around 1.1, 1.4 and 2. The implication is that as dissolution and/or saturation limitations 
increase with dose, food has a greater impact on facilitating absorption. The report notes that in the 
single ascending dose trials, tolvaptan doses from 60 to 480 mg produced similar mean urine volumes 
for the first 12 hours postdose as plasma concentrations in this interval produced a maximal rate of 
urine output. Therefore, the increased tolvaptan concentrations observed in the fed state would not 
be expected to have any additional effect on urine output in the first 6 hours postdose when compared 
to the fasted state.  
Distribution 
Tolvaptan is around 98% bound to plasma proteins. In plasma, it was bound mainly to serum albumin 
and α1−acid glycoprotein. The extent of binding to plasma proteins is not significantly altered in 
patients with liver disease. Binding is reversible. 
There was no effect from digoxin, diazepam or warfarin on the binding of tolvaptan. Various other 
agents including furosemide, spironolactone, propranolol, disopyramide, lidocaine and warfarin did 
not alter plasma protein binding of tolvaptan or metabolites or vice versa. 
The apparent volume of distribution was around 3 L/kg.  Preclinical tissue distribution studies showed 
radioactivity  mainly  distributed  to  liver,  GI  tract  and  kidney.  Transfer  of  radioactivity  across  the 
placenta and into breast milk was also observed.   
Otsuka  report  No  8223216  also  establishes  no  clinically  significant  difference  in  plasma  protein 
binding  in  patients  with  renal  impairment,  based  on  pooled  human  plasma  samples  from  normal 
subjects and from renally impaired patients (taken from clinical study 156-09-282)

Elimination 
Tolvaptan is a CYP3A4 and P-gp substrate, metabolized in the gut wall and liver. Renal clearance of 
unchanged tolvaptan is negligible. In porcine kidney epithelial cells, tolvaptan was also shown to be 
both a substrate and inhibitor of the P-gp efflux transporter. 
A mass-balance study in healthy volunteers showed that 40% of the radioactivity was recovered in 
the urine and 59% was recovered in the faeces, where unchanged tolvaptan accounted for 32% of 
radioactivity (study 156-97-202).  In  healthy subjects the terminal elimination half-life is about 8 
hours (SD 4.9) with no or minimal accumulation of tolvaptan following multiple administration, and a 
clearance of approximately 4 mL/min/kg. 
The pharmacokinetic properties of tolvaptan are stereospecific, with a steady-state ratio of the S-(-) 
to the R-(+) enantiomer of about 3. However, both enantiomers were found to be equally potent at 
the V2 receptor in in vitro binding studies. 
There are 7 main metabolites.  The predominant metabolite, with >50% of the total dose using the 
mass balance approach was DM-4103. The terminal elimination half-life of DM-4103 is around 183 
hours  and  after  multiple  dosing  it  shows  accumulation  by  day  28.  DM-4103  and  other  main 
metabolites have previously been shown to be pharmacologically inactive. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Cmax increases linearly with dose from 30-300 mg and a plateau is noted at doses >300mg.  The AUC 
also increased linearly up to the maximum single dose studied of 480 mg (study 156-01-229). Data 
from  healthy  subjects  showed  no  or  minimal  accumulation  of  tolvaptan  following  multiple 
administration.  
The  maximum  dose  given  long-term  in  patients  was  60  mg  in  the  separate  hyponatraemia 
development program.  The potential for accumulation of tolvaptan and the main metabolite in ADPKD 
patients is covered below.  
Special populations 
Intra-and inter-individual variability 
The intersubject variability for Cmax, AUC and CL/F was similar for healthy subjects and subjects with 
ADPKD and relatively intact renal function, with percent coefficients of variation (% CV) ranging from 
20 to 75%; values in the range of 35-50% were the most frequently observed.   
For 28 healthy subjects, intrasubject variation for Cmax, AUC and CL/F was about 21% for tolvaptan 
given as single oral 60 to 240 mg doses. For 9 subjects with ADPKD and relatively intact renal function, 
the intrasubject variations for Cmax and AUC0-24h were 15.3 and 26.6%, respectively, for tolvaptan 
given as a single 30 mg dose. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Single dose PK 
Study 156-04-248 was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, ascending single dose trial in 
11  (8  active/3  placebo)  subjects  with  ADPKD.    Subjects  had  to  meet  the  1994  Ravine  criteria  for 
diagnosis of ADPKD and have relatively intact renal function (i.e., serum creatinine value of ≤ 1.4 
mg/dL for men or ≤ 1.2 mg/dL for women). Subjects of either gender with a serum creatinine above 
1.8 mg/dL were excluded. Each single dose was separated by 3 days. 
Study 156-04-01 done in Japan was a randomised, parallel-group trial in ADPKD patients (9 subjects 
per group) with sequential administration of single doses of 15 mg and 30 mg.  Subjects had to meet 
somewhat different ADPKD diagnostic criteria but the criteria for renal function were similar.

AUCinf values are less than AUC 0-24, because the most appropriate data from different trials has 
been combined. For single oral doses ranging from 15 to 120 mg, the increase in tolvaptan plasma 
concentrations with increasing dose was approximately dose proportional. Single dose PK parameters 
in ADPKD patients were similar to previous healthy volunteer data, across the proposed dose range in 
ADPKD.  
Multiple dose PK 
Study  156-04-249  was  a  randomised,  placebo-controlled  parallel  group  multiple  dose  trial  in  37 
subjects with AKPKD (inclusion criteria as per US study 156-04-248).  Four dose regimens of 5 days 
duration were tested. Subjects were randomized to 1 of four treatments:  
15 mg a.m. +15 mg p.m. (n=9) 
30 mg a.m. +15 mg p.m. (n=9) 
30 mg a.m. +30 mg p.m. (n=9)  
30 mg a.m. + placebo p.m. (n=10) 
The  first  dose  was  given  at  approximately  9  in  the  morning,  the  second  dose  8  hours  later.  PK 
assessments were performed for 24 hours after the first dose on day 1, and for 48 hours after the first 
dose on day 5. These are summarized below:

Cmax and AUC were less than dose-proportional between 15 mg b.d and 30 mg b.d; however plasma 
concentrations following 30 mg in the morning were also around 20% higher compared with healthy 
subjects.  No dose dependence in tolvaptan PK parameters was observed.  Accumulation of tolvaptan 
following multiple oral doses ranging from 30 to 60 mg/day was minimal. This study analysed the 
major metabolite DM-4103, although this was not presented fully. From the individual data, a similar 
level of DM-4103 accumulation to the study 156-4-001 (see below) is however apparent

The Japanese study 156-04-001 already mentioned above included a second part which compared 5 
days of a split-dose regimen of 15 mg twice daily to 30 mg once daily in the morning. These data are 
presented below.

The main metabolite DM-4103 was eliminated from the plasma very slowly and accumulated with 
repeated dosing. Following 5 days of dosing the mean accumulation ratio was 4.253 for AUC 0-24.  A 
lesser  degree  of  accumulation  was  seen  with  metabolite  DM  4107,  however  the  plasma 
concentrations were around 10 fold lower than DM 4103

PK  parameters  following  multiple  dosing  were  comparable  between  healthy  subjects  and  ADPKD 
patients, although subjects in the PK studies had relatively intact renal function, so the specific renal 
impairment studies should be referred to. The new data as a whole shows minimal accumulation of 
tolvaptan following multiple dosing, across the proposed dose regimens. Significant accumulation is 
seen for the main metabolite DM-4103.   
Impaired renal function 
Study 156-09-282 explored the effect of a single oral 60 mg dose in subjects with varying degrees of 
renal impairment.  Values for tolvaptan mean Cmax and AUC∞ were about 1.3 and 1.9-fold higher for 
subjects with creatinine clearance (CrCL) < 30 mL/min when compared to subjects with CrCL > 60 
mL/min.  Subjects with ADPKD were eligible for this study, however none were recruited.  
The next 2 studies were with multiple doses, done specifically in ADPKD patients. Study 156-06-260 
assessed PK parameters on day 8 of dosing with the 45/15 split dose regime, whilst study 156-09-284 
assessed PK on day 21 of dosing, the dose being titrated to the 90/30 mg dose regime (26/27 patients 
successfully titrated to this dose).  The renal function subgroups were slightly different as shown in 
the tables below.

Impaired hepatic function 
Based on 87 patients, no clinically significant changes were seen in clearance for doses ranging from 
5 to 60 mg, in subjects with mildly or moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh classes A and 
B). Very limited information was available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
class C). Plasma protein binding is not significantly affected by hepatic disease.  
In  a  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  in  patients  with  hepatic  edema,  AUCs  of  tolvaptan  in 
severely and mildly or moderately hepatically impaired patients were 3.1 and 2.3 times higher than 
that in healthy subjects. 
The  data include an ascending multiple dose trial in 36 subjects with hyponatraemia secondary to 
liver disease (Child-Pugh score 6-12, median 10,  i.e. mostly class A or B) who received doses ranging 
from 5 to 60 mg doses, each administered once daily for 13 days, with  5 or 6 subjects per dose (Trial 
156-96-203).    In  this  study,  after  13  days  (13  subjects  remaining)  Cmax  and  AUC  increased 
proportionally  to  dose,  and  tolvaptan  concentrations  accumulated  1.7-  to  1.8-fold.    Clearance 
following a single dose was about half that of healthy subjects. Following multiple dosing (comparing 
at 30 mg once daily) clearance was about a third that of healthy subjects. The numbers per subset 
would have been too small to subdivide this analysis by baseline severity of liver disease.  
Age, race, gender and weight  
The clearance of tolvaptan is not significantly affected by age or gender following single dosing and 7 
days of dosing at 60 mg per day. (Study 156-98-202, in 51 healthy subjects). The effect of weight was 
estimated in a population PK analysis, which found that tolvaptan oral clearance slightly increased 
with  weight,  while  apparent  volume  of  distribution  was  proportional  to  weight.  Study  156-03-242 
compared the PK of tolvaptan in Caucasian and Japanese subjects following oral administration in the 
fasted state, after a high-fat meal and a Japanese standard meal. Tolvaptan mean Cmax and AUC 
values were slightly higher (+10-30 %) in Japanese subjects with respect to Caucasian subjects, both 
under fating and fed conditions. The difference was however thought to be due to differences in body 
weight between the 2 populations, since mean CL/F values adjusted for body weight (mL/min/kg) 
were very similar.  
In ADPKD subjects, single doses were compared in Japanese (Trial 156-04-001) and US (primarily 
Caucasian, Trial 156-04-248 and 156-04-249) subjects and gave similar results.

There are no existing or new data in children, and the proposed indication is restricted to adults. 
Additional  information  from  the  ADPKD  program  is  available  from  the  population  PK  report 
156-11-296. 
Covariate analysis revealed the following effects: 
•  A reduction of CL/F when CYP3A4 inhibitors were co-administered and with increased BMI values 
•  An increase of CL/F with increased eGFRCKD-EPI values 
•  A reduction of apparent central volume in subjects enrolled in Japanese sites and with increased 
age 
•  A higher absorption rate constant in females than in males 
The impact of BMI on CL/F ranged from −53% (for 54.7 kg/m2) to +63% (for 15.4 kg/m2) of the 
typical value. A decrease in eGFRCKD-EPI from 72.2 to 9.79 (mL/min/1.73 m2) would result in a 32% 
reduction in CL/F.  CYP3A4 inhibitor co-administration reduced CL/F by 27%. Females appear to have 
a  faster  absorption,  with  Ka  50%  greater  than  that  for  males.  Other  covariate  effects  had  a  less 
significant impact.  Inter individual variability in PK parameters was within the expected range for 
such a large population: 43% in CL/F, 34% in Vc/F and 67% in Ka. A visual predictive check showed 
acceptable model predictive performance across all dose regimens. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No new in vitro or in-vivo pharmacokinetic interaction studies have been done in the ADPKD program. 
The  proposed  dose  reduction  in  ADPKD  patients  taking  strong  CYP  3A4  inhibitors  is  based  on 
modelling, as detailed below.  
The table below summarises PK interaction studies, these also include PD interaction studies.  
Table

studies
The strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole caused a 5-fold increase in tolvaptan AUC, a 3-fold 
increase in Cmax, and a 50% increase in half-life.  Grapefruit juice increased tolvaptan Cmax by 86% 
and AUC by 56%, without affecting the elimination half-life (consistent with CYP 3A4 inhibition 
primarily in the gut wall)  
Conversely, the strong CYP inducer rifampicin decreased tolvaptan Cmax and AUCt by 83% and 87% 
respectively. The effect of CYP3A4 inhibition or induction on the PK parameters varied among 
metabolites because some of them are also metabolised by CYP3A4.  The major metabolite DM-4103 
was not found to have the potential for interaction at steady-state concentrations. 
Steady state digoxin (P-gp substrate) concentrations were increased, with a 1.3-fold increase in 
Cmax and a 1.2-fold increase in AUC, when co administered with multiple once daily 60 mg doses of 
tolvaptan.

No relevant interaction was noted between tolvaptan and statins, amiodarone, or warfarin. 
In patients taking strong CYP3A inhibitors, Jinarc is proposed to be administered once daily in doses 
of 15 mg or 30 mg.  Based on previous interaction data, individual subject tolvaptan 
concentration-nominal time profiles were used to estimate steady state concentrations following 
regimens of 15 mg or 30 mg once daily, if given with a strong CYP 3A inhibitor. This was compared 
with data from trial 156-07-262 (45/15 mg regimen) and trial 156-09-285 (90/30 mg regimen). The 
results of this predictive exercise are shown below.

Tolvaptan is a CYP 3A4 substrate and also a substrate for P-GP.  Data on interactions secondary to 
other inhibitors and inducers have been added in the SmPC, along with other relevant warnings (see 
also discussion on safety).  
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
For studies using human biomaterials see non clinical part of the report 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Stimulation of V2 receptors in the kidney increases intracellular levels of the key “second messenger” 
molecule, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This activates cAMP-dependent protein kinases 
that phosphorylate their downstream targets. Stimulation of V2 receptors causes vesicles within the 
renal epithelial cells containing aquaporin 2 to fuse with the plasma membrane. Aquaporin 2 then 
forms a transmembrane channel which selectively reabsorbs water from the urine. Other roles of the 
V2 receptor identified in the kidney are an increase in permeability to urea, stimulation of potassium 
secretion, and stimulation of sodium reabsorption.   
In an animal model of ADPKD, endogenous AVP is elevated; there is elevated renal cAMP, increased 
accumulation of fluid into cysts and epithelial cell growth. In this model and in preclinical models for 
similar  conditions,  tolvaptan  delayed  development  of  renal  cysts.  The  preclinical  work  has  been 
supported by in vitro studies using cultures of mural epithelial cells derived from human ADPKD cysts.  
These  cells  generated  increased  amounts  of  cAMP  in  response  to  AVP,  which  promoted  cell 
Assessment Report

Page 49/124 
 
 
 
proliferation and electrolyte secretion1.   Increased fluid secretion into cysts is due to AVP-induced 
transepithelial  secretion  of  chloride.    Human  ADPKD  patients  also  have  elevated  plasma  AVP 
concentrations  or  exaggerated  response  of  AVP  to  sodium  challenge,  compared  to  normal 
individuals.2   
To  summarise,  tolvaptan  is  thought  to  act  selectively  on  the  cells  from  which  ADPKD  cysts  arise.  
Stimulation of the V2 receptor in the distal nephron elevates intracellular cAMP levels, which is linked 
to reduced cell proliferation and a decrease of fluid excretion into cysts.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
There were 6 clinical pharmacology trials in ADPKD subjects which included PD endpoints following 
single or multiple dosing, the same studies already discussed in the PK section above. The PD 
endpoints selected for short term clinical trials were based on the observed physiological changes 
shown to occur in animal data:  
•  Urine osmolality 
•  Urine volume/excretion rate 
•  Free water clearance 
•  Fluid balance

Primary pharmacology 
Inhibition of AVP at the V2 receptor leading to increased renal excretion of water (aquaresis) is the 
primary pharmacological effect of tolvaptan, and is the mechanism proposed to decrease cAMP and 
cystogenesis in ADPKD.  The aquaretic effect can be easily monitored by measuring urine osmolality. 
The applicant hypothesizes that suppression of urine osmolality to less than 300 mOsm/kg(hypotonic 
urine) may decrease secretion of fluid into cysts. Limited dose-response data on total kidney volume 
is also available from pilot study 156-04-250. 
Urine osmolality 
In addition to determining the average urine osmolality for each urine collection interval, a spot urine 
sample obtained prior to the first morning dose tested if suppression were continued through the 
night. These values were summarized in a number of ways:  
-  Mean urine osmolality in the spot sample 
-  Percent of subjects with spot urine osmolality < 300 mOsm/kg 
-  Duration urine osmolality remained <300 mOsm/kg

In the AUC0-24h, a value <7200 mOsm⋅h/kg would indicate the average urine osmolality was <300 
mOsm/kg. 
Single dose data in ADPKD patients: study 156-04-248 
In 8 ADPKD subjects with relatively intact renal function given ascending single doses of tolvaptan (as 
outlined in the PK section above) the number of subjects that had urine osmolality < 300 mOsm/kg 
for at least 28 hours was 1, 4, 4, and 8 for the 15, 30, 60, and 120 mg doses, respectively. Mean urine 
osmolality  AUC0-28h  values  for  the  same  doses  were  6615,  5313,  4663  and  3251  mOsm⋅h/kg 
respectively, and respective average urine osmolality values were 236, 189, 166 and 116 mOsm/kg. 
Suppression  of  urine  osmolality  at  60  mg  in  this  group  of  subjects  was  similar  to  that  in  healthy 
subjects (Study 156-09-282)  
“Split-dose”  regimen  in  ADPKD  patients:  Study  156-04-249,  156-04-001,  156-09-285 and 
156-04-250 
Based on healthy subject data, a 60 mg daily dose as a “split-dose” regimen (45 mg and 15 mg) 
appeared  to  provide  better  suppression  of  urine  osmolality  than  a  single  60  mg  dose  (study 
156-07-262).  This was explored in ADPKD patients.   
In ADPKD subjects with relatively intact renal function administered tolvaptan in split-dose regimens 
of 30 to 60 mg/day for 5 days (study 156-04-249), a dose regimen of tolvaptan 15/15 mg was more 
effective than 30 mg once daily in reducing urine osmolality AUC0-28h, as mean (SD) values were 
4871 (1672) and 6322 (3060) mOsm⋅h/kg respectively.  The dosing regimen of 30/15 mg was equally 
effective as 15/15 mg regimen. The 30/30 mg regimen gave a mean (SD) AUC0-28h of 4216 (1863) 
mOsm⋅h/kg. 
As tolvaptan daily dose increased, the mean duration of time that urine osmolality remained <300 
mOsm/kg also increased; in the 48-hour period after dosing on Day 5, mean values were 34.2, 25.3, 
31.5, and 39.6 hours for the 15/15 mg, 30 mg once daily, 30/15 mg and 30/30 mg dose regimens, 
respectively The number of subjects with mean urine osmolalities of <300 mOsm/kg for 24 hours on 
Day 5 was 8/9, 4/9, 7/9, and 9/10 for the four regimens, respectively. 
In groups of 9 Japanese subjects with ADPKD and relatively intact renal function (Trial 156-04-001), 
mean  (SD)  urine  osmolality  AUC0-28h  on  Day  5  for  tolvaptan  15/15  mg  and  30  mg  once  daily 
regimens  were  4592.4  (1961.7)  and  8332.4  (2175.2)  mOsm⋅h/kg,  respectively,  and  the  mean 
duration  of  suppression  <300  mOsm/kg  was  25.3  (5.3)  and  16.4  (7.9)  hours  respectively.  When 
compared to US subjects in trial 156-04-249, discussed above, mean AUC0-28h values for the 15/15 
mg  regimen  were  similar  but  the  30  mg  once  daily  regimen  was  much  less  effective.  The  mean 
duration of suppression <300 mOsm/kg was about 9 hours shorter for Japanese subjects for both 
regimens.   
In US subjects with ADPKD (eGFRMDRD>60 mL/min/1.73 m2) administered the 90/30 mg split-dose 
regimen for 7 days, the mean urine osmolality AUC0-24h was 3226.9 (555.3) mOsm⋅h/kg (for an 
average concentration of 134 mOsm/kg). All subjects had urine osmolality in each collection interval 
maintained below 300 mOsm/kg and 11/12 subjects had urine osmolality <300 mOsm/kg at 23.5 
hours postdose. These results were obtained while subjects were in an in-clinic setting, with defined 
schedules for meals, sleeping and PK/PD assessments.  
Similar results were seen in the outpatient setting of the open-label trial 156-04-250, which included 
subjects previously enrolled in Trial 156-04-248 and Trial 156-04-249. During the titration period of 
this  trial,  subjects  self-administered  tolvaptan  in  an  out-patient  setting  and  collected  spot  urine 
samples prior to the first dose, prior to the second dose and prior to bedtime, according to their own 
schedules, on the day prior to their clinic visit. Mean urine osmolality values for spot urine samples 
taken prior to the first dose, prior to the second dose and prior to bedtime during weeks 1 through 4 
of the titration period are presented in the table below.

Following the 60/30 mg regimen, 23% of subjects had urine osmolality >300 mOsm/kg at prior to 
first dose and of the 27 subjects that up- titrated up to the 90/30 mg regimen, 15% were still not 
maximally suppressed prior to first dose. 
PD effect according to degree of renal impairment: Study 156-06-284 
The most relevant data in renal impairment are from study 248, in which subjects were titrated to a 
maximum dose of 90/30mg. The baseline data shows (as expected) that patients with severe renal 
impairment were less able to form concentrated urine, given a reduction in functional nephrons and 
thus a reduction in V2 receptor density. Consequently, although an effect is still seen, there is less of 
a response to tolvaptan as renal impairment progresses.   
Table 18: Study156-06-284: Mean Urine Concentrations (24-hour Collection) after 3 Weeks of 
Tolvaptan Treatment  
Secondary Pharmacology 
Many of the other pharmacological effects studied relate to aquaresis. These include urine volume, 
body  weight,  effect  on  serum  electrolytes  and  urine  sodium  excretion,  and  effect  on  plasma  AVP 
concentrations.  Whilst  these  are  important  in  SIADH,  in  the  treatment  of  ADPKD  patients  without 
hyponatraemia or oedema any pronounced effect on sodium or fluid balance could be undesirable.  
Reductions in GFR due to tolvaptan were observed in some subjects in the assessment of the Samsca 
MAA, and clearly this is highly relevant to the ADPKD indication.  GFR was assessed in detail in the 2 
of the PD studies, along with renal plasma flow, renal blood flow and filtration fraction. Various other 
markers were studied, including urinary cAMP and aquaporin 2 as exploratory markers of action, and 
urine albumin excretion.  A QT study was also submitted (156-03-245).

Urine volume 
In healthy subjects, urine excretion rate was increased at tolvaptan concentrations as low as 25-40 
ng/mL, these concentrations were achieved within approximately 20 minutes after a 45 mg dose of 
tolvaptan. A maximal urine excretion rate of 3-5 times greater than baseline was observed at plasma 
concentrations above100 ng/mL. Marked elevations of tolvaptan plasma concentrations produced a 
sustained effect, but not a greater magnitude of response. 
Single dose data in ADPKD patients: study 156-04-248  
In US ADPKD subjects with relatively intact renal function, changes in urine volumes and excretion 
rates were similar to those previously observed in healthy subjects. For example, mean 24-hour urine 
volumes of 8209 and 10126 mL were seen following single 60 and 120 mg doses, respectively.  Also, 
the rate of offset of effect for the above doses was similar for ADPKD and healthy subjects as urine 
excretion rates had returned to baseline by the 24-28 hour collection interval for both groups. 
Split-dose regimen in ADPKD patients: Study 156-04-249, 156-04-001, 156-09-285 and 156-04-250 
ADPKD  subjects  with  relatively  intact  renal  function  showed  a  reduction  in  daily  urine  volume 
following multiple doses. For subjects given 30 mg once daily or split-dose regimens ranging from 
15/15 mg to 30/30 mg, 24-hour urine output on Day 5 was about 20% less than observed on Day 1. 
In clinical pharmacology trials with ADPKD and relatively intact renal function maintained on a 60/30 
mg (1 subject in 284 trial) or 90/30 mg dose regimen for at least 7 days, mean (SD) 24-hour urine 
volumes were 7464 (2103) mL and 6532 (2036) mL  
Effect according to degree of renal impairment: Study 156-06-284 
As  renal  function  declines,  the  volume  of  urine  produced  for  a  given  dose  of  tolvaptan  declines; 
following a 90/30 mg split-dose regimen, mean (SD) 24-hour urine volumes for subjects with ADPKD 
and  eGFRMDRD  30  to  60    and  <30  mL/min/1.73  m2  were  6233  (1307)  mL  and  5024  (1767)  mL, 
respectively (table). Taking into account the variability seen, the differences between the 2 groups 
with the most pronounced renal impairment are not well defined.

(patients titrated to 90/30 mg regime) 
Acute effect on renal function 
The  acute  effect  of  tolvaptan  on  GFR  was  formally  assessed  in  both  done  specifically  in  ADPKD 
patients with varying degrees of renal impairment, studies 156-06-260 and 156-09-284. 
Measured  GFR  (mGFR,  based  on  iothalamate  clearance)  values  at  baseline  ranged  from  30.4  to 
159.2 mL/min and 18.0 to 148.4 mL/min respectively, in the two trials. Results from the two trials 
were comparable.  Modest (approximately 6-10%) but statistically significant,  reductions in mean 
mGFR were seen in subjects with well preserved (mGFR MDRD> 60 mL/min) and moderately impaired 
(30-60 mL/min) renal function, and a decrease of 2.1% was seen in subjects with poor renal function 
(< 30 mL/min)  
The results from the larger study 156-06-284 are shown in the table below.

Table 20: Study156-06-284: Change in mGFR after 3 weeks of tolvaptan treatment and at 3 weeks 
post-treatment (patients titrated to 90/30 mg regime) 
The mGFR results were comparable irrespective of duration of tolvaptan exposure (8 days compared 
with 2 days) suggesting that changes in response to tolvaptan administration occur within days after 
the start of dosing. At 21 days post-treatment, although most mean change from baseline GFR values 
were negative; they were not significantly different from baseline. The percent change from baseline 
in  renal  plasma  flow  (RPF),  as  measured  by  clearance  of  hippuran,  decreased  as  baseline  GFR 
decreased and was highly correlated with the percent change in mGFR.  As this was the case, filtration 
fraction (mGFR/RPF) was minimally affected.   
Mean creatinine and uric acid clearances were decreased about 12-16% and 20-25%, respectively, 
and the percent decreases were independent of baseline renal function. Tolvaptan administered as 
60+30 mg or 90+30 mg regimens had a small negative effect on urea nitrogen clearance. There was 
no effect on sodium or potassium clearance at any level of renal impairment 
Other endpoints  
In line with the small reduction in GFR, tolvaptan treatment initially increases serum or plasma 
creatinine and cystatin C (a further marker of renal function), as well as increasing uric acid levels.  
There is also a small increase in AVP, mirrored in AVP-neurophysin, and copeptin concentrations. For 
parameters where post-treatment concentrations were measured, concentrations returned to 
baseline after discontinuation of tolvaptan. Tolvaptan-induced increases in plasma sodium and 
osmolality are related to the aquaretic action of tolvaptan and the subsequent production of urinary 
free water.  
In the ascending dose tolerance trial in subjects with ADPKD (156-04-248) in which single doses of 
tolvaptan 15-120 mg were given, serum sodium concentrations exhibited dose-related increases with 
a maximal mean increase of around 5 mmol/L at 12 h for the 120-mg dose. 
Tolvaptan treatment did not meaningfully change urea nitrogen, potassium, albumin, aldosterone, 
renin, cAMP, calcium, or parathyroid hormone concentrations. Following multiple doses, tolvaptan 
treatment did not have a clinically significant effect on albumin, sodium, osmoles, potassium, urea 
nitrogen or aldosterone urinary excretion or the albumin/creatinine ratio. 
Urinary excretion of cAMP and unglycosylated aquaporin 2 decreased following multiple doses of 30 to 
60 mg/day to subjects with ADPKD.  These results are consistent with the proposed mechanism of 
action. 
Changes in urine creatinine and uric acid excretion were consistent with changes observed in 
clearance; however the clearance of uric acid was reduced to a proportionally greater extent. This is 
consistent with an effect of tolvaptan reducing distal reabsorption of sodium and sodium dependent 
uric acid reabsorption.

In  a  thorough  QT  study  (study  156-03-245)  172  subjects  in  4  groups  (43  subjects  per  arm) 
participated;  30  or  300mg  tolvaptan,  placebo  and  400  mg  moxifloxacin  were  administered  for  5 
consecutive days. Independent reviewers blinded to each subject’s treatment read the digital ECGs 
manually. There was no significant change from baseline in mean QTc on day 5 following multiple 
doses of either 30 or 300 mg dose of tolvaptan. In contrast, moxifloxacin increased mean QTc by 8.20 
msec (95% CI 5.89 to 10.50 msec). The plot of change in QTcI (from time matched baseline values) 
against  drug  concentration  had  a  positive  slope  only  for  moxifloxacin.  In  a post  hoc  analysis,  the 
largest  time  matched  difference  in  QTc  on  day  5  was  seen  with  moxifloxacin  with  an  increase  of 
15.78msec (95% CI upper limit 19.35) at 2hours post dose, while that for tolvaptan was 2.68msec 
(Upper limit 6.75 msec) at 300mg dose. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The key PD endpoint of change in urine osmolality, which is a measure of AVP suppression, showed a 
dose-response as discussed above, however due to due to the variability in PK parameters and the 
effect of covariates such as GFR, body mass index, gender, and of use of CYP3A4 inhibitors, analysis 
of  clinical  responses  by  modal  dose  was  not  definitive  for  exposure-response.  The  PK/  PD  model 
(report  156-11-296)  therefore  derived  individual  estimates  of  tolvaptan  exposure  for  subsequent 
PK/PD analyses.   There was no clear exposure response for the clinical endpoints tested.  However, 
change  in  urine  osmolality  was  correlated  with  tolvaptan  exposure  using  Cmin,ss  for  individual 
subjects.  Reductions in urine osmolality were also positively correlated with reductions in the rate of 
increase in total kidney volume, and subjects with greater suppression of urine osmolality were also 
less likely to experience an ADPKD clinical progression event.  
Use of the highest proposed dose, 90+30 mg, is supported by the urine osmolality PK/PD model and 
considering the Cmin and AUC at steady state. The Cmin,ss corresponding to 50% of the maximum 
effect was 43 ng/mL, around the expected Cmin,ss values with the 45+15 mg split-dose regimen 
(geometric  mean  of  38  ng/mL).  The  Cmin,ss  geometric  mean  value  at  the  90+30  mg  split-dose 
regimen  was  81  ng/mL,  corresponding  to  70.9%  of  the  maximum  effect.    Likewise,  the    AUCss 
corresponding  to  50%  of  the  maximum  effect  was  situated  between  the  expected  AUCss  values 
obtained with the split-dose regimens of 45+15 mg (geometric mean of 3.7 μg∙mL-1∙h) and 60+30 
mg  (geometric  mean  of  5.5 μg∙mL-1∙h).    The  AUCss  geometric  mean  value  for  the  90+30  mg 
split-dose regimen was 7.5 μg∙mL-1∙h, corresponding to 88% of the maximum effect. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances  
No additional formal PD interactions are submitted for the Jinarc MAA.  
Interaction with diuretics 
The PK and PD interactions between tolvaptan and furosemide or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) were 
determined  in  a  single-centre,  randomised,  open-label,  parallel-arm,  3-  period  crossover  study  in 
healthy  male  volunteers  (study  156-96-205).  Twelve  subjects  were  enrolled,  with  six  subjects 
assigned to each of the two treatment arms: Arm 1 involved 30 mg tolvaptan/80 mg furosemide. Arm 
2 involved 30 mg tolvaptan/100 mg HCTZ. Doses were separated by a 48-hour washout. No clinically 
significant changes were noted in the PK profiles of tolvaptan and furosemide, or tolvaptan and HCTZ, 
when  co-administered.  Free  water  clearance,  24-  hour  urine  volume,  plasma  Na+  and  AVP 
concentrations, and plasma osmolality were higher, while urine osmolality was lower, when tolvaptan 
was  administered  either  alone,  or  in  combination  with  furosemide  or  HCTZ,  compared  with 
furosemide or HCTZ administered alone. At 24 hours post-dose, plasma renin activity was increased 
following  furosemide  or  HCTZ  administered  alone  or  with  tolvaptan;  it  was  unchanged  following 
tolvaptan alone. Tolvaptan did not significantly affect the natriuretic activity of furosemide or HCTZ. 
Furosemide and HCTZ did not significantly affect the aquaretic activity of tolvaptan. An increase in 
free water clearance and urine volume were higher, but urine osmolality lower. Free water clearance 
was increased following tolvaptan administration alone and in combination with either furosemide or

hydrochlorothiazide.  Co-administration  with  furosemide  or  HCTZ  did  not  change  the  effect  of 
tolvaptan.  
No significant PD interaction was seen in this study. However, subsequent to the grant of the MAA for 
Samsca, a signal was identified for the risk of more severe dehydration when tolvaptan is given with 
a diuretic, leading to renal dysfunction this is also reflected in the Jinarc SmPC in sections 4.4, 4.5 and 
4.8. 
Other PD interactions 
In addition to its aquaretic effect, tolvaptan is capable of blocking vascular vasopressin V2 receptors 
involved  in  the  release  of  coagulation  factors  (e.g.,  von  Willebrand  factor)  from  endothelial  cells. 
Therefore,  the  effect  of  vasopressin  analogues  such  as  desmopressin  may  be  reduced  in  patients 
using such analogues (used to prevent or control bleeding) when co-administered with tolvaptan. This 
was added to the Samsca product information by variation following a case report. The Jinarc SmPC 
reflects general statements on medications which can interact with tolvaptan. These include diuretics, 
vasopressin analogues, and therapies which raise or lower serum sodium concentration. 
Genetic differences in PD response  
Approximately 85-90% of patients with ADPKD have an abnormality on the short arm of chromosome 
16, coding for PKD1 (polycystin 1) and giving rise to ADPKD type 1. A second defect, termed ADPKD 
type 2 (dysfunction of polycystin 2, ADPKD type 2), is responsible for 10-15% of cases and is found on 
the long arm of chromosome 4. A third genotype may exist, but no genomic locus is assigned.  
The  two  variants  of  ADPKD  appear  to  differ  primarily  in  the  relative  number  of  visible  renal  cysts 
formed at any given age. The mean age of ESRD for patients with ADPKD1 is 53 years, whilst the 
mean age of ESRD for patients with ADPKD2 is 74 years. ADPKD genotype was not assessed in any of 
the submitted studies. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Basic PK profile  
Standard pharmacokinetic parameters following single and multiple dose administration have been 
described.  This includes multiple dose data in ADPKD patients with the proposed split dose regimens. 
The analytical methods used in the Jinarc development program have been validated satisfactorily. 
The  PK  studies  including  the  population  PK  report  are  also  acceptable  in  design  and  methods  of 
analysis. 
Tolvaptan is a lipophilic molecule with poor aqueous solubility. Whilst the formulation allows rapid 
absorption and reasonable bioavailability, dissolution and/or saturation limitations probably explain 
both the Cmax plateau at very high doses and the effect of food on absorption.   
Tolvaptan  is  extensively  bound  to  plasma  proteins,  as  reflected  in  the  low  volume  of  distribution.  
Tolvaptan is a CYP3A4 and P-gp substrate. It is extensively metabolized; the terminal elimination 
half-life is about 8 hours.  
Jinarc shows dose proportionality within the therapeutic dose range.  Cmax increases linearly with 
dose from 30-300 mg and a plateau is noted at doses >300mg.  The AUC also increased linearly up to 
the maximum single dose studied of 480 mg. 
Data from healthy subjects and patients showed minimal accumulation of tolvaptan following multiple 
administration.  
The applicant evaluated food effect with the 90 mg tablet within a bioequivalence study. A high-fat 
meal increased absorption and Cmax values of tolvaptan, an effect which was not seen with previous 
food  interaction  studies  at  the  30  and  60  mg  dose.  Given  the  PK/PD  relationship  and  the  lack  of 
significant tolerability issues related to peak drug level for tolvaptan, the observed food effect for

Cmax  is  of  doubtful  clinical  significance  but  to  minimise  the  unnecessary  risk  of  increasing  the 
maximal exposure the morning dose should be taken under fasted conditions as outlined in the SmPC. 
Notes on main metabolite 
The  main  metabolite  DM-4103  is  eliminated  from  the  plasma  more  slowly  than  the  parent  and 
therefore accumulates with repeated dosing. Following 5 days of dosing the mean accumulation ratio 
was  4.253  for  AUC  0-24h.  A  lesser  degree  of  accumulation  was  seen  with  metabolite  DM  4107, 
however its plasma concentrations were around 10-fold lower than DM 4103. In patients with renal 
impairment, the mean half-life for DM-4103 was considerably longer (308 hours) for subjects with 
eGFRMDRD < 30 compared to subjects with lesser degrees of renal impairment.  
Whilst this metabolite has previously been noted as having no pharmacological activity, given the 
higher doses proposed for Jinarc compared to the separate Samsca MAA, the potential for long term 
use and target population of patients with renal impairment, the applicant has provided information 
on  its  pharmacological  activity,  including  any  effect  on  CYPs  or  drug  transporters,  following  the 
exposure levels anticipated in a “worst case” scenario. The data provided by the applicant showed 
that there is no separate trial which includes multiple dose metabolite PK data in  ADPKD patients 
receiving the highest proposed dose regime. The applicant however notes that 7.5 µg/mL (15.7 µM) 
is the average concentration in the pivotal 156-04-251 trial, from steady state sampling at 12, 24 and 
36  months.      The  response  also  provides  reassurance  that  the  pharmacological  activity  at  the  V2 
receptor  is  associated  with  tolvaptan  and  not  DM-4103.  Regarding  other  receptors,  non-clinical 
pharmacology studies indicated low potential for the metabolite to have any pharmacological activity. 
The highest concentration tested across all receptors was 4.5 μg/mL, but the human plasma albumin 
concentration would be about 10 times higher than those used in the above assays, reducing the free 
concentration. 
Preclinical studies did not show hepatotoxicity after 6 and 9 months in non-clinical species given the 
parent and exposed to the main metabolite, although these data are now superseded by the clinical 
data. 
In clinical trial subjects adjudicated for hepatic toxicity events, DM-4103 concentrations were highly 
variable and were not higher when compared with other subjects.  Despite this and the presumption 
that hepatic toxicity with Jinarc is idiosyncratic rather than dose related, the role of DM-4103 cannot 
however be ruled out in the absence of a confirmed alternative mechanism, the limited number of 
serious hepatotoxicity cases, and the lack of long-term in vivo toxicity studies involving DM-4103. The 
planned post authorisation safety study will give more insight into the hepatic safety of Jinarc (as 
described in the RMP). 
Bioequivalence data 
The  submitted  bioequivalence  data  support  the  expanded  range  of  strengths  required  for  the 
proposed dose regime in ADPKD. 
Renal impairment 
The proposed SmPC states that dose adjustment is not required in patients with renal impairment. As 
the risk of hepatic damage in patients with severely reduced renal function (i.e. eGFR < 20) may be 
increased these patients will need to be carefully  monitored for hepatic toxicity as outlined in the 
SmPC.  Given  the  lack  of  renal  clearance  for  the  active  molecule,  no  relationship  between  renal 
function and exposure is expected on this basis; however in general terms, the disease state of renal 
impairment can impair hepatic metabolism indirectly, affect the elimination of metabolites, or change 
weight and volume of distribution.  Renal impairment may also affect the level of plasma proteins, 
however plasma protein binding of tolvaptan was previously determined to be unaffected by renal 
function.

The  previously  available  data  from  the  Samsca  MAA  was  limited.  Therefore  3  studies  in  ADPKD 
patients with varying degrees of renal impairment have been submitted. Overall there is no significant 
correlation between tolvaptan and baseline renal function, although the numbers are relatively small 
and there is considerable intersubject variability within each subset. A population PK analysis however 
revealed a reduction of clearance with  worsening renal function,  with a decrease in eGFRCKD-EPI 
resulting in a 32% reduction in CL/F.  No clinical trials in subjects with a creatinine clearance <10 
mL/min or in patients undergoing dialysis have been conducted. There is also no clinical rationale for 
the use of tolvaptan in ADPKD patients with end-stage renal failure and the SmPC states that the 
treatment should be discontinued if the stage of renal insufficiency progresses to CKD stage 5. 
Pharmacodynamic data discussed later show reduced effectiveness with worsening renal function and 
further data on efficacy in later stages of ADKPD is to be provided within a post authorisation efficacy 
study as outlined in Annex II and RMP (see efficacy discussion and Benefit Risk section of this report) 
Hepatic impairment 
No new formal PK data in hepatic impairment are presented for the ADPKD indication; the dosing 
recommendations are basically derived from the previous Samsca development program. The effect 
of hepatic impairment on PK may differ by the cause of liver disease, so even the limited existing data 
such as in patients with hepatic oedema secondary to CHF might not directly extrapolate. However, in 
a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with hepatic oedema, AUC of tolvaptan in severely 
and  mildly/moderately  impaired  patients  was  respectively  3.1  and  2.3  times  higher  than  that  in 
healthy subjects.  Clearly,  there may be concomitant liver disease in ADPKD patients due to other 
reasons, but cystic involvement of the liver (polycystic liver disease) is common in AKPD, especially in 
female  patients.  Significant  hepatic  impairment  due  to  massive  cystic  involvement  is  uncommon; 
however  acute  hepatic  impairment  can  result  from  infection,  haemorrhage,  rupture  or  torsion  of 
single cysts. Rarely, ADPKD patients may have additional congenital defects. Overall, PK data are 
limited  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment,  especially  in  patients  with  severe  impairment  whose 
benefit risk is to be carefully evaluated and monitored by the treating doctor as outlined in the smPC. 
Other special populations  
Clearance of tolvaptan is not affected by gender or race to a clinically significant extent. A population 
PK analysis revealed a reduction of clearance with increased BMI values (as dose is not weight-based) 
and increased age. There is increased absorption in females, the reasons of this are not clear. There 
are no available data in children. and tolvaptan is indicated in adults only. 
Interactions  
Steady  state  digoxin  concentrations  were  increased  (1.3-fold  for  Cmax,  1.2  fold  for  AUCt)  and 
patients receiving digoxin should be evaluated for excessive digoxin effects when treated with Jinarc 
as outlined in the SmPC. Also, tolvaptan increased plasma levels of lovastatin by 1.3 to 1.5-fold. This 
indicates  that  tolvaptan  can  potentially  increase  exposure  to  CYP3A4  and  P-gp  substrates. 
Interactions secondary to other inhibitors and inducers have been added in the SmPC. 
The applicant has provided further clarification on the expected concentrations of tolvaptan in the 
intestine following the highest proposed dose, and the expected free concentration at the liver and 
kidney,  where  MDR1  efflux  transporters  are  also  found.    Although  the  plasma  concentrations 
calculated at only 40 fold are not above the 50 fold IC50 recommended in the CHMP interaction study 
guideline, the Ki would be expected to be lower, therefore it is agreed that the effect is likely to be due 
to inhibition in the intestine and is likely to be similar at the higher dose.  For cytochrome P450s, all 
IC50’s are reported as greater than 50 µM with the exception of 2C8/9 which is reported as 38.9 µM.  
Therefore any effects on CYP 3A4 are likely to be in the intestine only and a similar argument would 
apply with effects at the higher dose likely to be similar. For CYP1A1/2, CYP2C8/9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6,

CYP2E1, and CYP3A4, a human liver microsome study suggests little potential for interaction for the 
DM-4103 metabolite.  
The SmPC has been amended to advise caution with sensitive P-gp substrates such as digoxin which 
is acceptable for marketing authorisation. An in vitro P-glycoprotein (P-gp) study with DM-4103 is 
on-going and results will be submitted as described in the RMP. 
Studies  with  tolvaptan  and  DM-4103  to  assess  the  potential  inhibition  of  other  drug  transporters 
(BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, BSEP, MATE1, and MATE2-K) show potential 
for  interaction.  For  marketing  authorisation  adequate  cautionary  statements  on  the  use  with 
substrates for OAT3, OATP1B1 and 1B3A have been added to the SmPC and the risk is considered 
balanced. As interactions at BCRP in the gut and OCT 1 in the liver are relatively rare they are handled 
with cautionary statements in the SmPC. 
However  clinical  studies  are  recommended  to  look  at  interactions  with  OAT3,  OATP1B1  and  1B3 
substrates, unless clinical PK or safety data can be provided or further justification that these studies 
can be waived based on new modelling and analysis of existing data. 
The  proposed  SmPC  recommends  that  concomitant  administration  of  Jinarc  with  potent  CYP  3A 
inducers  are  to  be  avoided.  For  patients  taking  moderate  CYP3A  inhibitors,  twice  daily  split  dose 
regimen are applied but in reduced doses by half which is acceptable. 
The applicant has committed in the RMP to conduct a new drug-drug interaction trial using fluconazole 
as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, and is also recommended to provide further analysis and modelling 
data regarding more frequent co-administration of CYP 3A4 inhibitors than the existing ketoconazole 
study, as well as administration of CYP 3A4 inhibitors with a shorter or longer half-life. The SmPC 
contains appropriate cautionary statements to balance the risk for authorisation.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Based on the background research, preclinical and in-vitro data presented by the applicant, an effect 
in ADPKD is definitely plausible and the endpoints chosen for initial studies were appropriate to assess 
the pharmacology in ADPKD patients.Inhibition of AVP at the V2 receptor leading to increased renal 
excretion  of  water  (aquaresis)  is  already  a  well-established  effect  of  tolvaptan  from  the  Samsca 
program, and inhibition of the V2 receptor is also the mechanism proposed to reduce cyst progression 
in ADPKD.  
The aquaretic effect can be easily monitored by measuring urine osmolality, which is a marker for AVP 
level and a practical tool to optimise the clinical benefit of tolvaptan therapy in ADPKD patients.  There 
is a clear ceiling effect for aquaresis. A maximal urine excretion rate of 3-5 times greater than baseline 
was  observed  at  tolvaptan  concentrations  >100  ng/mL.  Marked  elevations  of  tolvaptan  plasma 
concentrations produced a sustained, but not a greater magnitude of response.  
The applicant hypothesizes that suppression of urine osmolality to less than 300 mOsm/kg (hypotonic 
urine) decreases secretion of fluid into cysts. Given this and the need, based on preclinical work, to 
maintain  a  constant  effect,  the  applicant  has  explored  modified  release  formulations,  but  instead 
proposes a “split-dose” dosing regimen – twice daily doses separated by 8 hours with the main dose 
being given in the morning.  This is proposed to maintain constant inhibition of the V2 receptor, whilst 
hopefully avoiding excessive diuresis at night which would cause disruptive nocturia for the patient.  
At the proposed split-dose regimens of 45+15 mg to 90+30 mg daily, tolvaptan clearly blocks AVP at 
the V2 receptor, increasing urine output and suppressing urine osmolality in ADPKD subjects.  The 
45/15 mg dose was the lowest at which >90% of subjects had urine osmolality values below 300 
mOsm/kg  before  the  pre-second  dose  and  pre-  bedtime  samples,  indicating  that  urine  osmolality 
would be suppressed for at least 16 hours per day. A 60/30 mg regimen may be suitable for many 
subjects, with the 90/30 mg regimen providing additional inhibition in others. Complete suppression 
could not be achieved at any of the dose regimens, as the top dose is limited by tolerability.   
Assessment Report 
EMA/154879/2015 
Page 59/124 
 
Other than urine osmolality, due to the variability in PK parameters and the effect of covariates such 
as GFR, body mass index, gender, and of use of CYP3A4 inhibitors, analysis of clinical responses by 
modal  dose  was  not  definitive  for  exposure-response.  However,  change  in  urine  osmolality  was 
correlated with tolvaptan exposure using Cmin,ss and AUCss for individual subjects.  
Pilot data suggested a dose-response for total kidney volume in study 250; this is referred to in the 
efficacy section of this report.  
Pharmacodynamic effect in renal impairment 
The baseline data shows (as expected) that patients with severe renal impairment were less able to 
form concentrated urine, given a reduction in functional nephrons and thus a reduction in V2 receptor 
density. Consequently, although an effect is still seen, there is less of a response to tolvaptan as renal 
impairment progresses.  There is a short-term and reversible haemodynamic effect when tolvaptan is 
initiated, as discussed below. This effect decreases as renal function declines, but there are limited 
data in patients with more severe renal impairment.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic effects 
Whilst the therapeutic rationale in ADPKD is to slow the rate of renal progression, tolvaptan at dose 
regimens of 45+15 mg to 90+30 mg, initially decreases GFR by around 6 to 10%. These changes 
occur  rapidly  and  are  reversible  after  the  end  of  tolvaptan  treatment.  The  potential  causes  are 
discussed  in  the  submitted  reference  by  Irazabal  et  al  2011.3    The  authors  speculate  that  this  is 
probably  not  explained  by  the  small  relative  contraction  of  plasma  volume,  or  via  direct 
haemodynamic  effects  of  elevated  vasopressin  on  V1a  receptors  in  the  renal  vasculature.    It  is 
hypothesised that the effect could be due to reduced pressure within the glomerulus due to a direct 
effect of AVP, or due to some hemodynamic changes involving tubuloglomerular feedback that occur 
in response to the decrease in urine osmolality.  If this is the case, if the offset of tolvaptan’s action on 
urine  osmolality  after  discontinuation  of  treatment  is  rapid  and  it  would  be  expected  that  the 
decreases observed in eGFR would be quickly reversible as well.   
Tolvaptan-induced increases in plasma sodium and osmolality are related to the aquaretic action of 
tolvaptan and the subsequent production of urinary free water. Overall in ADPKD patients, sodium 
concentrations  exhibited  dose-related  increases  (from  a  generally  normal  baseline  value)  with  a 
maximal mean increase of around 5 mmol/L at 12 h for the 120 mg dose.   
In line with the small initial reduction in GFR, tolvaptan treatment initially increases serum or plasma 
creatinine and cystatin C (a further marker of renal function), as well as increasing uric acid levels. 
There is also a small increase in AVP, mirrored in AVP-neurophysin, and copeptin concentrations. For 
parameters  where  post-treatment  concentrations  were  measured,  concentrations  returned  to 
baseline after discontinuation of tolvaptan. Tolvaptan treatment did not meaningfully change urea 
nitrogen, potassium, albumin, aldosterone, renin, calcium, or parathyroid hormone concentrations. 
Following multiple doses, tolvaptan treatment did not have a clinically significant effect on albumin, 
sodium,  osmoles,  potassium,  urea  nitrogen  or  aldosterone  urinary  excretion  or 
the 
albumin/creatinine ratio. Urinary excretion of cAMP and unglycosylated aquaporin 2 were decreased 
following multiple doses of 30 to 60 mg/day to subjects with ADPKD.  These results are consistent with 
the proposed mechanism of action.   
Changes in urine creatinine excretion and uric acid excretion were consistent with changes observed 
in clearance; however the clearance of uric acid was reduced to a proportionally greater extent.  This 
is consistent with tolvaptan reducing distal reabsorption of sodium and sodium dependent uric acid 
reabsorption. Hyperuricamia is an identified risk of tolvaptan treatment and a common adverse event 
as labelled in the SmPC.

A thorough QT study did not indicate the potential for QT interval prolongation.  
V2R  is  now  known  to  be  expressed  in  many  extrarenal  tissues,  including  vascular  and  pulmonary 
endothelial cells, the inner ear, parathyroid, nonkeratinized squamous epithelia, exocrine pancreas, 
salivary glands, smooth muscle, breast cells, and Leydig cells. There is also evidence to suggest that 
the V2R is expressed at low levels in the brain. It is accepted that activation of the V2 receptor in 
vascular  endothelium  increases  the  circulating  levels  of  coagulation  factor  VIII,  VWF,  and  tissue 
plasminogen  activator.  However,  the  relevance  and  function  of  V2Rs  in  other  cell  types  is  not 
determined and no adverse events are signaled for related off-target effects w.  
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
As anticipated from the properties of tolvaptan, there are potential pharmacodynamic interactions 
between tolvaptan and diuretics, when co-administered with medicinal products that affect serum 
sodium  concentration,  and  vasopressin  analogues  such  as  desmopressin.  The  applicant  has  not 
considered possible PD interactions such as hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, and dizziness due 
to the combination of tolvaptan with diuretics or non-diuretic anti-hypertensive drugs, and the pivotal 
study did not measure standing blood pressure. Therefore the prescriber is made aware in the SmPC 
on the lack of specific data about standing blood pressure and the possibility of hypotension which is 
acceptable. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Adequate studies to characterise tolvaptan PK and support the proposed posology in ADPKD patients 
have  been  performed  in  the  ADPKD  development  program.  Missing  areas  regarding  interaction 
potential  as  discussed  above  are  followed  up  within  the  RMP  and  are  balanced  with  appropriate 
warning statements in the SmPC  
Pharmacodynamics 
The  primary  and  secondary  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  tolvaptan  in  ADPKD  are  adequately 
described. The entirety of available pharmacodynamic data indicates that tolvaptan is promising in 
the  proposed  target  population  of  APKD  to  reduce  the  progression  of  disease,  within  the  doses 
studied.  
At the proposed split-dose regimens of 45+15 mg to 90+30 mg daily, tolvaptan blocks AVP at the V2 
receptor, increasing urine output and suppressing urine osmolality in ADPKD subjects.  The 45/15 mg 
dose was the lowest at which >90% of subjects had urine osmolality values below 300 mOsm/kg for 
at  least  16  hours  per  day.  In  terms  of  the  pharmacodynamic  principle  the  split  dosage  can  be 
considered adequately justified. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The  initial  dosage  of  tolvaptan  in  ADPKD  is  60  mg  per  day  as  a  split-dose  regimen  of  45+15  mg 
(45 mg taken upon waking and 15 mg taken 8 hours later).  The initial dose is to be titrated upward 
to a split-dose regimen of 90 mg per day (60+30 mg) then to a target split-dose regimen of 120 mg 
per  day  (90+30  mg)  if  tolerated,  with  at  least  weekly  intervals  between  titrations.    Patients  may 
down-titrate to lower doses based on tolerability. 
Based on animal models of ADPKD, the aim of dose escalation was to block the activity of AVP at the 
renal V2 receptor as completely and constantly as possible, whilst maintaining adequate fluid balance 
and achieving acceptable tolerability. The hypothesis is that maximal efficacy depends on AVP being

Page 61/124 
 
maximally  inhibited  for  the  entire  day  and  night.  Urine  osmolality  was  used  as  a  marker  of  AVP 
inhibition. 
Single daily doses in ADPKD subjects did not adequately suppress urine osmolality over a 24 hour 
period. Twice daily regimens with unequal doses (the main dose given in the morning) were tested 
with the goal of prolonging tolvaptan action throughout the night without increasing night-time urine 
excretion so much that nocturia would be a significant problem. 
The titration data for the open-label 156-04-250 trial provide the basis for the doses selected in the 
pivotal trial. During the titration period, as tolvaptan doses increased, urine osmolality prior to the 
second dose and prior to bedtime were most easily suppressed. The urine osmolality data from this 
study are discussed in the PD section above.  The 45/15 mg dose was the lowest dose at which >90% 
of subjects had urine osmolality values below 300 mOsm/kg before pre-second dose and pre- bedtime 
samples, indicating that urine osmolality would be suppressed for at least 16 hours per day. A 60/30 
mg  regimen  may  be  suitable  for  many  subjects,  with  the  90/30  mg  regimen  providing  additional 
inhibition in others. Complete suppression could not be achieved at any of the dose regimens; the top 
dose is limited as only 46% of subjects (21/46) tolerated the 90/30 mg dose.  
The  results  from  study  250,  whilst  preliminary  and  only  compared  to  historical  controls,  also 
suggested that tolvaptan may favourably impact the rate of kidney growth in subjects with ADPKD, 
with a dose response between the group randomised to 3 years of the 45+15 mg regime, compared 
to the 60+30 mg group. The deterioration in this measure in the gap between the end of the fixed 
dose period and the extension period appeared to confirm the suggestion from the preclinical model 
that continuous treatment with tolvaptan is important.

Subjects  having  contraindications  to  MRI  assessments,  or  factors  which  would  interfere  with  their 
interpretation  
Subjects  who  were  taking  medications  or  had  concomitant  illnesses  likely  to  confound  endpoint 
assessments 
Subjects taking other experimental (non-marketed) therapies or taking approved therapies for the 
purpose of affecting PKD cysts, or those taking or with a history of taking tolvaptan 
Treatments 
The trial began with a screening period for baseline evaluation, and proceeded to a treatment period 
which included an initial titration phase of up to 3 weeks, followed by a long-term maintenance phase 
up  to  36  months,  and  2  follow  up  visits  after  discontinuation  of  tolvaptan.  Eligible  subjects  were 
randomised to receive either tolvaptan or matched placebo in a 2:1 ratio. 3 split-dose regimens of 
tolvaptan were selected as per the proposed posology. Subjects began treatment with the 45/15 mg 
split dose regime and on the day following each 1-week safety assessment, doses were titrated to the 
next higher dose treatment group until either a level of intolerability or the highest dose was reached. 
Subjects were to maintain the highest tolerated dose for 3 years, but could titrate up or down as 
clinical circumstances warranted. If subjects could not tolerate the lowest effective dose of 45/15 mg, 
they were withdrawn from the trial. Drug interruptions were allowed as needed for intervening illness, 
with resumption of therapy either at the highest tolerated dose or at lower doses with titration as 
tolerated. The first of the daily doses was given in the morning on waking, with the second smaller 
dose given around 9 hours later, regardless of meals. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of tolvaptan in ADPKD through rate of 
TKV change (%) for tolvaptan compared with placebo subjects.  
Other objectives of the trial were to evaluate the following: 
Long-term efficacy of tolvaptan using individual clinical markers of ADPKD progression 
Long-term safety of tolvaptan through standard clinical measures 
Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and exploratory parameters for effects of tolvaptan in ADPKD 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the rate of change in kidney volume from baseline relative to placebo. The 
volume  was  added  for  both  kidneys  and  then  normalised  as  a  percentage.  As  tolvaptan  was 
individually titrated, data from all tolvaptan doses was combined.  Total kidney volume was assessed 
by MRI. 
Total kidney volume was selected as the primary endpoint for a number of reasons: 
•  The lack of information linking other endpoints (renal pain, haematuria, hypertension) with the 
anticipated effect of tolvaptan on renal growth 
•  Endpoints related to onset of end-stage renal disease (for example, time to reach CKD stage 3, 
doubling  of  serum  creatinine,  renal  replacement  therapy,  all-cause  mortality)  would  require  more 
subjects and a longer duration of study than reasonably possible in this rare disease 
•  The slower progression of GFR, its variability and the confounding of compensatory hyperfiltration 
in early stages of disease 
•  Literature evidence to support TKV as a marker of disease progression in ADPKD 
The primary analysis was based on observed cases (completers) 
The key secondary composite efficacy endpoint was the time to multiple investigator reported ADPKD 
clinical progression events for tolvaptan (combining all doses) relative to placebo while on treatment, 
including: 
•  Onset or progression of HTN (BP measurement, need for HTN treatment)

•  Severe renal pain requiring medical intervention 
•  Worsening albuminuria (by change in category) 
•  Worsening  renal  function  (25%  decrease  in  reciprocal  of  serum  creatinine  from  steady-state 
postdose baseline value) 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints were:  
1) Rate of renal function change from steady-state postdose baseline value (end of titration to last 
on-drug trial visit) based on the reciprocal of serum creatinine 
2)  For  subjects  who  were  non-hypertensive  at  baseline,  change  from  baseline  for  resting  mean 
arterial pressure at scheduled clinic visits up to the point of exposure to antihypertensive therapy for 
any reason 
3) Change from baseline in renal pain as assessed by a 0 to 10 pain scale as average AUC, between 
baseline  and  the  last  trial  visit  or  the  last  visit  prior  to  initiating  medical  (e.g.  narcotics,    tricyclic

sustained decreases of BP leading to a sustained reduction in antihypertensive therapy compared with 
baseline (while taking study drug) at visit on Months 12, 24, and 36 for hypertensive subjects 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and safety endpoints (see later section) were also taken. Urine 
samples were collected to evaluate trough osmolality and MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1, a 
marker  of  renal  injury).  Blood  samples  were  collected  to  evaluate  the  plasma  concentrations  of 
tolvaptan  and  metabolites  (DM-4103  and  DM-4107)  in  sparse  samples,  as  well  as  plasma 
concentrations of cystatin C and uric acid. 
Sample size 
The original sample size calculation was based on the CRISP (see outline above) and HALT 4 studies.  
A  7%  and  5.6%  (or  20%  reduction)  kidney  growth  rates  per  year  was  assumed  in  placebo  and 
tolvaptan  treated  groups  respectively.  It  was  further  assumed  (in  log 10  scale) that  the  total  noise 
standard deviation and the standard deviation of the slope across subjects were respectively about 
0.017 and 0.0184, which were provided or derived from the information provided by the HALT PKD 
website. Using the sample size calculation formula for longitudinal trials provided by J. Lefante, with 
85% power and 2:1 randomization, the sample size was calculated at 504. After an assumption of 20% 
withdrawal rate for the trial, about 600 subjects could be enrolled to the trial. By doubling this number, 
the applicant hoped to effectively attain a power equivalent to two independent studies.  The sample 
size needed for the key secondary composite endpoint was unknown at the  planning stage of the 
protocol  since  there  was  no  reliable  information  on  its  likely  event  rate.  Blinded  sample  size 
re-calculation was pre-specified in the protocol.  This re-calculation was conducted on 20/10/08 when 
1000 subjects had been enrolled, and suggested that a total sample size of 1400 would be appropriate. 
At this point a 20% reduction in the key secondary composite endpoint was anticipated.  
Randomisation 
After trial eligibility was determined, subjects were centrally randomised in each region independently 
(Americas, Japan, Europe, others) 
Subjects were stratified into 3 groups, permuting to 8 strata:  
•  Hypertensive or not; eCrCL < 80 or ≥ 80 mL/min; TKV < 1000 or ≥ 1000 mL 
• 
Indicators of eCrCL status (eCrCL < 80, 80-120, or > 120 mL/min)

Blinding (masking) 
The study was double-blind, patient treatment allocation was implemented by an interactive voice 
recognition  system.  Bioanalytical  personnel  were  also  blinded  to  treatment.  No  interim  efficacy 
analyses were performed.  
Statistical methods 
Data sets  
The primary analysis was based on observed cases.  The intent-to-treat (ITT) dataset was defined as 
a dataset including data from all subjects who were randomized. There were subsets of this based on 
whether the subject was hypertensive or not at baseline.  For each of these there was an observed 
cases (OC) dataset and a time-to-event dataset associated with it. 
The OC dataset consisted of only data points obtained from those subjects who were evaluated at the 
Baseline visit, post-baseline visits during the double-blind treatment period of the trial, and the End of 
Trial/early termination (ET) visit, so that no imputation was made for missing data. The double-blind 
treatment period was defined as the period starting from the first dosing day to 14 days after the last 
dose of IMP. The time-to-event dataset consisted of all randomised subjects with all events occurring 
during the double-blind treatment period of the trial. 
Trial completers were defined as subjects who were evaluated for the primary efficacy endpoint, key 
secondary composite endpoint, and PKD Outcomes at the last scheduled visit (Month 36) during the 
treatment period. If a subject who was randomized and taking IMP discontinued the use of the IMP, 
telephone  contact  for  PKD  Outcomes  data  was  conducted  at  the  normally  scheduled  trial  visits  to 
Month  36,  Follow-up  Visit 1,  and  Follow-up  Visit  2,  if  the  subject  agreed  to  be  followed.  The  PKD 
Outcomes data from telephone contact were not used in the primary analysis but were utilized in an 
exploratory  ITT  analysis.  Events  of  ADPKD  clinical  progression  concurrent  with  or  proximate  to  a 
period  of  IMP  interruption  were  included  in  the  primary  analysis  of  the  key  secondary  composite 
endpoint. 
Analysis 
Efficacy  analysis  was  done  sequentially;  first  on  the  primary  endpoint,  then  the  key  secondary 
composite  endpoint,  and  then  all  other  secondary  endpoints  in  the  order  specified  in  SAP.  The 
non-composite  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  tested  without  adjustment  for  multiplicity.  An 
overall type I error with significance level of 0.05 (two-sided) was to be maintained 
Primary  efficacy  analyses  included  all  subjects  who  were  randomised  and  had  baseline  and  post 
baseline observations of TKV (i.e., MRI assessments).  Key secondary efficacy analyses included all 
subjects who were randomised.  The TKV primary, key secondary composite, and renal function slope 
endpoints  were  subjected  to  multiple  additional  sensitivity  analyses  to  evaluate  the  robustness  of 
these findings and to examine the potential impact of data missing at random (MAR) and data MNAR. 
For the purpose of statistical modelling in the primary analysis, time to MRI from randomization was 
treated as a continuous variable, expressed as years from date of baseline MRI visit to date of MRI 
visit (date of MRI visit – date of MRI visit at baseline)/365.25, instead of a class variable with values 
of 0, 1, 2, or 3.  Subjects withdrawing from the trial would have an MRI during the ET visit only if the 
subject’s most recent MRI was greater than 6 months prior to withdrawal. 
Log 10 transformation was applied to the TKV data, and they were then analysed by a linear mixed 
model with terms of treatment, time treatment interaction, covariance baseline as fixed effects, and 
intercept and time also as random effects. An unconstructed variance covariance matrix was assumed 
for the random effects of intercept and slope within each subject.

EMA/154879/2015 
Page 65/124 
 
In addition to the primary analysis, a Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) analysis was 
applied to the repeated measures of percent change from baseline in TKV as a sensitivity analysis.  
Least-squares (LS) mean difference of the 2 treatment groups at Year 3 under the MMRM was used to 
estimate  the  treatment  effect  at  Year 3.    The  MMRM  included  stratification  factors  (hypertensive 
status, kidney volume status and eCrCL status at baseline, and geographic regions), visit, treatment, 
and treatment visit interaction as class variables and baseline kidney volume  and baseline kidney 
volume  visit interaction  as  covariates.    A  compound  symmetric  variance  covariance  structure  was 
assumed for the repeated measurements within each subject.  The observed cases dataset with the 
same data used in the primary analysis was used in this MMRM analysis. 
Analysis of time to multiple (recurrent) events using proportional rate and mean model, with only a 
factor of treatment in the model, was used for the analysis of the key secondary composite endpoint 
to provide a point estimate of the HR and its p-value.  This analysis of rate and mean model is identical 
to the analysis of the intensity model (Andersen-Gill model) using the sandwich covariance matrix 
estimate to derive standard errors for the Wald test.  An analysis of the time to the first event was 
designed to be a sensitivity analysis of this composite endpoint. 
Handling of missing data 
For  longitudinal  analysis  (to  determine  slope  of  change),  missing  data  were  ignored.  For  by  visit 
analysis,  missing  data  were  imputed  by  LOCF  (LOCF  analysis)  or  censored  (observed  analysis)  or 
combined with “per protocol” data for strictly exploratory purposes.

Subject disposition and reasons for discontinuation 
Recruitment 
The study involved 135 centres, with 129 centres enrolling patients. The centres were in North and 
South America, Europe, Australia and Japan. 
Trial Initiation Date: Jan 2007 
First subject randomised: March 2007 
First subject randomised: January 2009 
Trial Completion Date: January 2012 
Conduct of the study 
Other than administrative changes, protocol amendments included changes to the screening period, 
clarified the MRI evaluation (including removing the option of gadolinium contrast) and the addition of 
more study visits for the Japanese sites following specific regulatory requirements there. All trial sites 
completed as per the protocol. 
The protocol amendments are not considered to have affected the outcome of the studies. No protocol 
deviations are considered to have significantly affected the integrity of the trial and no significant 
issues with study conduct are apparent. Adherence was good at around 90% per group.   
Baseline data 
Approximately half of the subjects were male (746/1445, 51.6%) and the majority of subjects were 
Caucasian (1218/1445, 84.3%). The mean age of randomized subjects was 38.7 years (range 18 to 
51 years) 
For the stratification factors, the majority (79.4%) were hypertensive at baseline (approximately 77% 
of all subjects were receiving hypertensive therapy) 25.7% had creatinine clearance < 80mL/min and 
20.6%  had  a  TKV  <1000  mL.  53%  of  subjects  had  microalbuminuria  at  baseline,  5%  had  overt 
proteinuria.   
History of hepatic cysts and haematuria were balanced between treatment groups, overall they were 
seen in around 60% and 34% of patients respectively.  The mean age of ADPKD diagnosis was around 
27 years in each group.

Using  eGFRCKD-EPI,  tolvaptan  and  placebo  subjects  were  evenly  distributed  at  baseline  across 
KDIGO CKD Stages, mostly stages 1 and 2. With the exception of one subject in the placebo arm, no 
subjects enrolled in the trial with baseline CKD Stages 4 or 5. 
For stage 1, the percentages at baseline were 34.4% in the tolvaptan group, 35.9% for placebo  
For stage 2 the percentages at baseline were 48.5% and 46.5% respectively 
For stage 3 the percentages at baseline were 17.0% and 17.4% respectively 
The following table shows the baseline measures of kidney volume and renal function:

Refer to details of subject disposition above. Of 2122 screened subjects, 1445 were randomised, of 
whom 1444 received at least 1 dose.  A total of 961 subjects received tolvaptan and 483 subjects 
received placebo. 
Of the patients who completed 36 months of treatment with tolvaptan, 404 (55%) took the high dose 
(a total daily dose of 120 mg), whereas 157 (21%) and 179 (24%) took the middle dose (90 mg) and 
low dose (60 mg), respectively. Of the patients who completed 36 months of placebo treatment, 348

Adherence was good and exceeded 90% in 845 of the 961 patients in the tolvaptan group (88%), with 
an average dose of 95 mg per day, and in 451 of the 483 patients in the placebo group (93%), with 
an average sham dose of 110 mg per day. Of the patients who completed 36 months of treatment with 
tolvaptan, 404 (55%) took the high dose (a total daily dose of 120 mg), whereas 157 (21%) and 179 
(24%)  took  the  middle  dose  (90  mg)  and  low  dose  (60  mg),  respectively.  Of  the  patients  who 
completed  36  months  of  placebo  treatment,  348  (83%),  38  (9%),  and  32  (8%)  took  the 
corresponding sham doses. 
Primary endpoint 
Total kidney volume increased by 18.8% in placebo subjects over 3 years but by only half that (9.6%) 
in tolvaptan subjects.  The rate of growth was 2.80% per year for tolvaptan vs. 5.51% per year for 
placebo,  giving  a  ratio  of  geometric  mean  0.974;  95%  CI  0.969  to  0.980;  p < 0.0001.    This 
corresponded  to  a  difference  of  −2.71%  per  year  with  a  49.2%  reduction  in  growth  rate  in  the 
tolvaptan group compared with the placebo group.   
The effect of treatment with tolvaptan on TKV was greatest in the first year but treatment effects 
persisted into the second and third year of therapy, with a year-to-year accrual of effect over time, 
leading to continued incremental separation from placebo over the entire 3 years.  The incremental 
treatment effect for reduction in TKV from the first year to the second year was −1.92% (p < 0.0001) 
and from the second year to the third year was −1.78% (p = 0.0005).  These results were replicated 
in sensitivity analyses, including re-analyses to account for differing model assumptions and datasets, 
potential MRI quality or reading errors, and analyses by study centre and country.

Figure 4: Study 156-04-251. Effect of Tolvaptan on the Rate of TKV Change (Normalized as a 
percentage) 
The above analysis was prospectively defined in the protocol with both intercept and slope as random 
effects; however, the variance of the random effect intercept was zero, resulting in a non-positive, 
definite  variance-covariance  matrix  for  the  random  effects.  Therefore,  a  post-hoc  analysis  of  the 
primary endpoint was performed using a linear mixed model in which the intercept was a fixed effect 
and the slope was fixed and random effect. The results of the revised analysis were consistent with 
the pre-specified analysis. 
A post-hoc exploratory analysis of the change from baseline in TKV by modal dose demonstrated a 
dose response for tolvaptan.  
The MMRM sensitivity analysis, which tests year-to-year change, confirmed the results of the primary 
analysis. Baseline TKV was generally similar for tolvaptan and placebo subjects. Least-squares mean 
TKV  growth  at  Month  36  for  tolvaptan  (9.56%)  was  halved  relative  to  placebo  (18.75%),  for  a 
treatment group difference of −9.19%.  A sensitivity MMRM analysis looking at the absolute change 
from  baseline  in  TKV  in  mL  produced  similar  results.  The  analysis  indicated  that  the  effect  of 
treatment on TKV growth was greatest in the first year and included negative cyst growth for the 
tolvaptan group (−1.65%) compared with positive cyst growth in the placebo group (4.62%), for a 
treatment effect of −6.27. During the second and third years, kidney enlargement progressed in both 
groups;  this  progression  was  significantly  slower  in  tolvaptan  subjects  compared  with  placebo 
subjects (2.93% vs. 11.10% for a treatment effect of −8.17% by Month 24 and 9.56% vs. 18.75% for 
a treatment effect of −9.19% by Month 36; each, p < 0.0001)

Key secondary endpoint 
The key secondary composite efficacy endpoint was the time to multiple investigator reported ADPKD 
clinical progression events for tolvaptan (combining all doses) relative to placebo while on treatment, 
including: 
Onset or progression of HTN (BP measurement, need for HTN treatment) 
Severe renal pain requiring medical intervention 
Worsening albuminuria (by category) 
Worsening renal function (25% decrease in 1/serum creatinine from steady-state postdose baseline) 
This key secondary composite endpoint yielded a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.865 (95% CI 0.775 to 0.965, 
p = 0.0095) in favour of tolvaptan, a 13.5 % rate reduction.

Figure 6: Hazard ratios for the secondary end point of ADPKD-related events with tolvaptan as 
compared with placebo for the secondary composite end point and its component events. 
This result was confirmed by similarly significant time to first event and adjudication analyses, as well 
as multiple other sensitivity analyses (summarised below) 
Analyses of time to the first composite ADPKD event (HR 0.826; 95% CI 0.722 to 0.944, p = 0.0051) 
and the adjudicated time to first composite ADPKD event (HR 0.835, 95% CI 0.729 to 0.955, p = 
0.0087) demonstrated fewer ADPKD progression events in the tolvaptan group. These analyses weigh 
each subject equally by censoring each subject at the time of their first event of clinically significant 
progression. The analyses confirm that the significance of the key secondary composite endpoint was 
due to the treatment effects on most of the subjects, instead of a few subjects with multiple events. 
More restrictive ITT analyses were conducted using Week 3/EOT as post-titration baseline for event 
derivation.  These  analyses  were  used  to  exclude  the  noise  associated  with  trial  initiation  and  the 
initiation  of  treatment  (e.g.,  subjects  adjusting  antihypertensives  after  discontinuing  diuretics). 
Analyses included the time to multiple events (HR 0.877, 95% CI 0.785 to 0.980, p = 0.0203) and the 
time  to  the  first  composite  ADPKD  event  (HR  0.884,  95%  CI  0.770  to  1.014,  p  =  0.0777);  both 
favoured tolvaptan. 
Less restrictive ITT analyses were used to include data collected off treatment up to Month 36. Time 
to  multiple  composite  ADPKD  events  analyses  used  a  nonrestricted  ITT  approach  (regardless  of 
treatment period) using either predose baseline (HR 0.874, 95% CI 0.784 to 0.974, p = 0.0147) or 
Week 3/EOT as baseline (HR 0.889, 95% CI 0.797 to 0.992, p = 0.0354). Both of these analyses 
maintained statistical significance.

In response to a regulatory request from the US FDA, analyses of the time to multiple composite 
ADPKD  events  using  a  nonrestricted  ITT  approach,  regardless  of  treatment  period,  were  done  to 
examine the events that occurred before and after SAP finalisation. These favoured tolvaptan in both 
time periods (before SAP finalization HR 0.925, 95% CI 0.811 to 1.057, p = 0.2522; and after SAP 
finalisation  HR  0.790,  95%  CI  0.669  to  0.934,  p  =  0.0057).  While  tolvaptan  had  a  numerically 
favourable effect in both time periods, it became statistically significant in the second time period due 
to the increasing impact of renal function events, which occurred late in the trial. 
In response to a further FDA request to examine the effect of partial missing data on the result of the 
SAP-defined primary analysis of the key secondary composite endpoint, this was re-done allowing 
only  subjects  to  contribute  to  the  treatment  group  denominator  at  the  last  visit  where  an  event 
occurred or where all 4 components were evaluated. This analysis also favoured tolvaptan (HR 0.878, 
95% CI 0.787 to 0.979, p = 0.0194)  
An  exploratory  analysis  of  the  key  secondary  composite  endpoint  after  correction  of  pain-related 
baseline  covariates  from  subjects’  ADPKD  disease  history  (e.g.,  renal  pain,  nephrolithiasis,  UTI), 
maintained the statistical significance of the composite endpoint at a level of p < 0.01 for time to 
multiple event and time to first event. 
Events  that  signalled  a  decline  in  renal  function  were  delayed  in  both  groups  until  approximately 
month  12  with  the  separation  of  tolvaptan  treatment  from  placebo  treatment  evident  at 
approximately month 18.  The effect of tolvaptan on renal pain was observed early in the treatment 
period, with increasing separation between the tolvaptan and placebo groups over the remaining 3 
years of treatment. Worsening renal function events were correlated with percent change in TKV and 
TKV slope, whilst renal pain events were not.

Endpoint; ITT, Within Treatment Period 
3rd endpoint: Rate of renal function decline 
Tolvaptan  treatment  slowed  the  estimated  rate  of  renal  function  decline  (reciprocal  of  serum 
creatinine)  by  one-third,  observed  after  the  1  year  point.    This  was  confirmed  when  GFR  was 
estimated by methods other than reciprocal of creatinine, including the CKD-EPI equation.   
As seen in some of the earlier studies, tolvaptan treatment was associated with early but transient 
increases in serum creatinine compared with placebo; this is discussed further in the safety section 
below.

As an exploratory analysis, the applicant looked at change in CKD classifications.  By the end of the 
trial, the proportion of placebo subjects with CKD Stage 3 or higher (by eGFRCKD-EPI), signifying a 
moderate to severe decrease in GFR had more than doubled to approximately 39%. In comparison, in 
the tolvaptan group, approximately 34% of subjects were classified as having CKD Stage 3 or higher.  
Ancillary analyses 
Beyond the third endpoint of renal function decline, none of the other planned secondary endpoints 
yielded clear overall trends. In particular, there was no benefit of tolvaptan on evolution or control of 
blood  pressure  compared  to  placebo,  whether  subjects  were  hypertensive  or  normotensive  at 
baseline, nor a benefit over placebo in change from baseline on the renal pain scale. 
In the 13-item composite of complications related to ADPKD progression, tolvaptan reduced the rate 
of complications by 20.8% in an exploratory analysis. In a further exploratory analysis, treatment 
with tolvaptan was associated with an improvement in some of the measured clinical outcomes. A 
smaller proportion of subjects on tolvaptan reported renal pain, nephrolithiasis, haematuria, UTI, and 
anaemia compared with subjects on placebo. 
Changes  in  plasma  cystatin  C  concentrations  were  consistent  with  changes  in  serum  creatinine 
concentrations.  
76% to 85% of tolvaptan subjects had trough urine osmolality < 300 mOsm/kg compared with 22% 
to 24% of placebo subjects, and mean trough urine osmolality was about 250 mOsm/kg lower for 
tolvaptan compared with placebo subjects. Tolvaptan subjects with the slowest rates of TKV growth or 
slowest decline in renal function had the greatest mean decreases in urine osmolality. 
Subgroup analyses 
For the primary endpoint, generally consistent results were seen in all subgroups, including those 
related to stratification factors, baseline disease severity, adverse prognostic factors, age, gender, 
and race. Selected factors are shown in the figure below:

Notes 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
There  was  only  1  pivotal  trial.    Combined  data  from  the  2  open-label  studies  was  used  in  a 
case-control study as discussed below.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
Data on special populations is discussed in the Pharmacology part of this assessment report above 
Supportive studies 
Supportive evidence of efficacy is available from 2 further studies in ADPKD patients: 
A 3-year, open-label extension trial conducted in the US (Trial 156-04-250)  
A 3-year, open-label extension trial conducted in Japan (Trial 156-05-002) 
A matched-control analysis (study 156-09-283) of the data from 156-04-250 and 156-05-002, with 
ADPKD natural history data from 2 US National Institutes of Health sponsored studies has also been 
done.  
Open-label studies 156-04-250 and 156-05-002 
These were preliminary open label studies in a small number of ADPKD patients. Study 156-04-250 
was in 46 patients, study 156-05-002 in 17 patients.  In these trials, TKV was assessed at 2 or 6 
months, then annually up to 3 years after starting treatment.  Additionally, the effects of treatment 
withdrawal on TKV or eGFR were investigated in Trial 156-04-250 during a treatment interruption 
period, prior to an optional 1-year treatment extension.  To confirm long-term outcomes (TKV, eGFR) 
and the clinical relevance of TKV change, data on the combined 63 ADPKD subjects from these 2 trials  
were  compared  with  a  matched  cohort  of  untreated  ADPKD  subjects  receiving  standard  of  care 
(analysis designated as Study  156-09-283) 
Study 156-04-250 provides the most contributory data of the two open-label studies. Following a 2 
month titration phase, ADPKD subjects were randomised to either the 45/15 mg split dose regime or 
the 60/30 mg regime, and followed this for up to 3 years.  These 2 doses were chosen after interim 
analysis of the titration period. Following this, some patients entered into a 12 month extension, after

an  off-drug  period  of  up  to  1  year.  Total  kidney  volume  by  blinded  MRI  was  evaluated  as  a  pilot 
efficacy measure. The figure below shows the change from baseline in total kidney volume, in those 
subjects who entered the extension phase. The study excluded patients who at day 1, or extension 
day 1, had an estimated GFR below 30 mL/min or in whom renal-replacement therapy was anticipated 
within 1 year of study extension.  The mean GFR estimated by the MDRD equation was around 60 
mL/min.  
Figure 8: Study 156-04-250: Percent change from baseline in TKV by assigned dose regimen  
Taking the two open-label trials together, tolvaptan slowed the increase in total kidney volume (1.7% 
vs. 5.8% per year, P<0.001) and the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR; −0.71 vs. −
2.1 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area per year, P = 0.01) 
Matched-control data: study 156-09-283 
Data from the 2 open-label studies was used in a case-control study. The matched-control data were 
derived from 2 studies:  Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and CRISP I (consortium for 
radiologic  imaging  studies  of  polycystic  kidney  disease)  The  primary  objective  was  to  compare  in 
ADPKD subjects the rate of TKV change, over a 3-year period between tolvaptan-treated subjects and 
matched-control subjects receiving standard of care. A total of 51 patients receiving tolvaptan and 
completing  studies  156-04-250  and  156-05-002  were  included  in  the  primary  analysis,  with  102 
case-matched subjects. Case matching was based on age, TKV, serum creatinine and hypertension 
status.    Subjects  missing  TKV  could  be  considered  for  matching  for  evaluation  of  GFR  and 
hypertension  endpoints.  Because  of  the  study  designs,  for  matched-control  pairing,  the  pool  of 
matches was restricted to CRISP subjects for TKV but included both CRISP and MDRD subjects for 
eGFR.

Additional data from study 156-08-271, open label extension study  
At  CHMP’s  request,  the  applicant  has  provided  a  2  year  update  from  the  long-term  open-label 
extension trial 156-08-271, which is on-going. 2 years was the pre-specified time-point for analysis of 
the efficacy endpoints (corresponding to 5 year’s tolvaptan treatment in some patients) but it has now 
been extended indefinitely. At this point there were 549 patients who had received tolvaptan prior to 
entry into the open-label study, 309 that had not, very good retention of subjects from corresponding 
entry  figures  of  554  and  331.    The  figure  below  summarizes  eGFR  results.  Beginning  at  a 
pre-treatment baseline for Trial 156-04-251, tolvaptan subjects (blue squares) had a drop in eGFR of 
approximately 3.38 mL/min/1.73m2 (difference of estimated treatment effect for tolvaptan versus 
placebo  between  pre-treatment  Day  1  and  End  of  Titration/Week  3).  During  the  next  3  years  of 
treatment, the slope of decline for these subjects was shallower than for the parallel placebo group 
(red  diamonds)  whose  eGFR  declined  linearly  to,  and  beyond,  Month  36.  At  this  point  the  slopes 
intersect and can be projected to have crossed, had treatment continued. Upon treatment withdrawal, 
the placebo group’s eGFR decline continued, while the tolvaptan group’s eGFR recovered by 3.66, 
4.02 and 3.52 mL/min/1.73m2 (differences of the estimated treatment effect for tolvaptan versus 
placebo between the on-treatment Month 36 visit and post-withdrawal follow-up visits 1 and 2 for 
Trial 156-04-251 and the pre-treatment baseline for Trial 156-08-271, respectively).  
Once  all  subjects  were  placed  under  the  same  condition  of  “on  tolvaptan  treatment”  in  Trial 
156-08-271, both the prior-tolvaptan and prior-placebo groups from Trial 156-04- 251 experienced 
the same onset of an acute decline in eGFR as seen at the beginning of Trial 156-04-251. The original 
drop of 3.38 mL/min/1.73m2, was comparable to the 3.36 and 3.35 mL/min/1.73m2 declines for prior 
tolvaptan and prior placebo groups, respectively, during Trial 156-08-271 (differences between LS 
Mean estimate for baseline and Month 1 visits for Trial 156-08-271). During the 2-years of treatment 
in Trial 156- 08-271, each group retained a consistently significant treatment difference of between 2 
to 3 mL/min/1.73m2.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical trials 
The  proposed  initial  dosage  of  tolvaptan  is  60  mg  per  day  as  a  split-dose  regimen  of  45+15  mg 
(45 mg taken upon waking and 15 mg taken 8 hours later). The initial dose is then titrated upward to 
a split-dose regimen of 90 mg per day (60+30 mg) then to a target split-dose regimen of 120 mg per 
day  (90+30  mg)  if  tolerated,  with  at  least  weekly  intervals  between  titrations.  Patients  may 
down-titrate to lower doses based on tolerability. This was the regimen employed in the pivotal study.  
There is no dose-response study that looked at efficacy long-term with all the proposed split-doses.  
The rarity of the disease and available numbers of patients are taken into account here. The titration 
data  for  the  open-label  156-04-250  trial  can  provide  the  main  basis  for  the  doses  selected  in  the 
pivotal trial. The submitted data from this study and the clinical pharmacology studies provide an 
adequate basis for the doses selected. 
Trial  156-04-251  is  the  single  pivotal  phase  III  trial  in  ADPKD  patients;  this  was  a  double-blind, 
randomised placebo-controlled, parallel arm study. The basic design of the study is sound and the 
dosing consistent with the proposed posology. The duration of the trial is relatively short given the 
long evolution of ADPKD, and not able to detect a benefit on clinical endpoints such as time to renal 
replacement therapy.  However, it would hardly be feasible for the main study period to be longer.  
Further longer-term data will be generated by the open-label extension trial 156-08-271 as described 
in the RMP. 
The  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  appropriate.  The  inclusion  criteria  generated  a  subject 
population with a relatively large renal volume consistent with rapid cystic growth, but reasonably 
preserved renal function. These patients with early but rapidly progressive disease were hoped to 
benefit from therapy and to have a prognosis for observable changes or outcomes during a 3-year 
trial. In this respect it is a necessarily “enriched” study population.  
The treatment groups were generally well balanced at baseline for demographic factors.  Adverse 
prognostic factors in ADPKD include the ADPKD1 genotype, male gender, presence of sickle cell trait, 
early  age  of  diagnosis,  hypertension,  gross  haematuria,  proteinuria,  renal  size,  increased  left 
ventricular mass, hepatic cysts in women, three or more pregnancies, and urinary tract infections in 
men. For those factors that were evaluated at baseline, the groups were well balanced. Patients were

not genotyped at baseline, although ADPKD type 1 is the commonest variant (90%) and the mean age 
of the patients is consistent with this type.  It has been added to the SmPC that patients were not 
genotyped into ADPKD subtypes 1 and 2, and that it is not known whether Jinarc has comparable 
efficacy in these subgroups.   
The diagnostic criteria used for ADPKD were acceptable. 
The primary endpoint was the rate of change in kidney volume from baseline for tolvaptan relative to 
placebo. The volume was added for both kidneys, and normalised as a percentage.  As tolvaptan was 
individually titrated, data from all tolvaptan doses was combined. There was centralised, standardised 
and blinded assessment of all MRIs. Literature evidence supporting the use of TKV primarily comes 
from the Consortium for Radiologic Imaging Studies in Polycystic Kidney Disease (CRISP), a cohort of 
ADPKD patients between the ages of 15 to 45, all of whom had creatinine clearances greater than 70 
mL/min. Using standardised MRI renal imaging, these patients were evaluated annually in order to 
determine reliable measures of disease progression early in ADPKD. Longitudinal data from the CRISP 
2  study  published  in  2012  suggested  a  correlation  between  TKV  and  total  cyst  volume,  and  a 
correlation of height-corrected TKV and GFR, out to 8 years of follow-up. At the 8 year follow-up, 194 
out of 441 enrolled (241 originally enrolled in the CRISP 1 study, and 201 re-enrolled) patients were 
available  for  assessment.  TKV  was  assessed  by  standardised  serial  MRI,  GFR  by  iothalamate 
clearance.  Height corrected TCV (cc/m) was the optimum variable in terms of predicting stage 3 CKD 
at  8  years  from  baseline,  when  compared  against  serum  creatinine,  BUN,  urine  albumin,  urinary 
MCP-1 and age. 
The CRISP cohort also confirmed that cystic growth and renal enlargement was significant before any 
significant impairment of renal function, and that the rate of cyst growth and TKV is continuous in 
each individual. The mean renal growth rate was found to be 5.3% per year, or about 63.4 mL per 
year. PKD1 genotypes were associated with larger kidneys compared to PKD2 patients, but with no 
significant difference in cyst growth rate. To demonstrate the difficulties of instead using GFR as a 
primary endpoint for the tolvaptan program, the majority of the participants (55.9%) entered the 
CRISP I study with a GFR > 90 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and 42.3% continued to maintain this level of 
renal function by year 8. For ADPKD patients entering the study with GFR of 60-90, the figure was 
reduced to 27%.  
The CRISP cohort has some similarities to the inclusion criteria for the pivotal tolvaptan study. Again, 
the cohort was at relatively high risk for developing renal insufficiency but had relatively intact renal 
function  upon  recruitment.  The  criteria  for  enrolment  in  CRISP  required  that  two-thirds  had  risk 
factors for disease progression, including onset of hypertension or gross haematuria before age 35 
years,  or  proteinuria  of  300  mg/day.  Clearly  there  are  some  differences  between  the  population 
studied in study 156-04-251, and in the measurements and analyses, however overall the applicant 
has provided a compelling argument for the use of  TKV as a primary endpoint. Measures of renal 
volume are clearly linked to the characteristic progressive development of renal cysts in ADPKD, and 
correlate with renal function. There is a lack of information on the correlation between renal volume 
and other clinical endpoints, although a correlation was clinically plausible a priori.  MRI was done in 
a standardized and blinded fashion, generally using methodology established in the CRISP program, 
and  a  separate  validation  report  is  submitted  for  the  pivotal  study.  Intra-reader  variability  had  a 
relative error of 0.62%, while inter-reader variability had a relative error of 1.23%. In the clinical trial 
setting, MRI is the most suitable imaging technique to monitor total kidney volume, to accurately 
estimate  the  extent  of  disease  and  assess  treatment  progress.  Ultrasound  is  more  suited  as  a 
screening tool, and sequential CT scans involve a significant radiation exposure. 
It is noted that the total kidney volume endpoint as primary showed lack of a consistent effect in all 
of the components of the key secondary analysis. Therefore the indication statement was adapted to 
retardation of cyst growth.  Nevertheless it is taken into account that the literature since 2009 more 
strongly supports the TKV endpoint, with the publication of the CRISP 2 study. 
Assessment Report 
EMA/154879/2015 
Page 82/124 
 
The  key  secondary  endpoint  was  a  composite  time  to  event  analysis  of  defined  clinical  endpoints 
relating  to  hypertension,  renal  pain,  albuminuria  and  reduction  in  renal  function.  These  clinical 
outcomes were considered important in ADPKD, and were anticipated to be influenced by reducing the 
rate of cyst development. Importantly, all components were subject to independent verification as a 
sensitivity analysis.  
Rate of change in renal function was the third endpoint, based on the reciprocal of serum creatinine. 
GFR  estimates  based  on  serum  creatinine  alone  are  not  always  reliable  as  a  surrogate  for  renal 
impairment, however this endpoint does allow comparison to other trials in CKD, and it was supported 
by standard alternative equations, including the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration 
(CKD-EPI) equation.  A large number of other endpoints looked at the components of the secondary 
composite endpoints and other PK, PD, safety and clinical outcome measures. 
There  is  no  other  regulatory  precedent  for  ADPKD  interventional  trials,  but  it  is  clear  that  the 
progression of ADPKD is slow, and it is not considered reasonable to expect an analysis based on 50% 
loss prior to licensing. Increase of 33% in serum creatinine does have significant limitations as an 
endpoint;  however,  taking  into  account  the  natural  history  of  ADPKD  and  the  practicalities  of 
conducting a study in the limited number of available patients the reasoning behind this choice is 
understood.    A  recent  paper  by  the  Chronic  Kidney Disease  Progression  Consortium  (Coresh  et  al 
2014) 5 gives further support for using this endpoint. 
Overall,  the  choice  of  endpoints  is  considered  acceptable.  In  particular,  it  is  considered  that  the 
primary end point is well supported by clinical arguments and the literature. This takes into account 
the 3 year study duration, and the fact that harder clinical endpoints such as those related to onset of 
end-stage  renal  disease  or  all-cause  mortality  would  require  many  more  subjects  and  a  longer 
duration of study than reasonably possible in this rare disease. 
Randomisation and blinding procedures were acceptable and there are no indications of significant 
problems with the study conduct.   
Efficacy data – pivotal study  
Of 2122 screened subjects, 1445 were randomized, of whom 1444 received at least 1 dose.  A total of 
961 subjects received tolvaptan and 483 subjects received placebo. Overall, 1157 patients (80.1%) 
completed the 3-year trial. There is a low loss to follow-up, partly as subjects were regularly followed 
up by telephone after discontinuation. 
The primary efficacy analysis included 1307 of the 1445 patients (90.4%), and the discontinuation 
rate is much higher (23%) in the tolvaptan group than placebo (13.8%). This difference is due to the 
difference in the rate of discontinuation due to adverse events (15.4% versus 5%). 12.4% of patients 
randomised to receive tolvaptan were not included in the primary analysis. In contrast, only 3.9% of 
placebo patients were excluded from the primary analysis. This is discussed below. The key secondary 
efficacy  analysis  included  all  1445  (100%),  and  the  key  secondary  safety  analysis  included  1444 
(99.9%) 
Primary endpoint 
Total kidney volume increased by 18.8% in placebo subjects over 3 years but by only half that (9.6%) 
in tolvaptan subjects. The rate of growth was 2.80% per year for tolvaptan, compared to 5.51% per 
year for placebo-treated patients. The ratio of geometric means was 0.974 (95% confidence interval 
0.969 to 0.980; p < 0.0001), a difference of −2.71% per year with a 49.2% reduction in growth rate 
in the tolvaptan group compared with the placebo group.  The effect of treatment with tolvaptan on 
TKV was greatest in the first year but effects of tolvaptan treatment persisted into the second and

third year of therapy, with a year-to-year accrual of effect over time, leading to continued incremental 
separation from placebo over the entire 3 years. The rate of progression per year in the placebo group 
was similar to that expected from historical data and twice that seen in the tolvaptan group. 
These results were replicated in multiple sensitivity analyses, including re-analyses to account for 
differing model assumptions and datasets, potential MRI quality or reading errors, and analyses by 
study and country. Generally consistent results were seen in all subgroups, including those related to 
stratification factors, baseline disease severity, adverse prognostic factors, age, gender, and race.   
None of the analyses previously provided adequately took into account the differential dropout rate 
due  to  adverse  events  observed  in  the  trial.  For  the  primary  endpoint  (TKV)  and  the  first  two 
secondary  endpoints  (composite  and  eGFR)  the  applicant  performed  an  analysis  of  change  from 
baseline  to  month  36,  with  a  “tipping  point”  analysis  to  explore  how  punitive  the  imputation  of 
subjects with missing values at month 36 due to withdrawal from the study due to adverse events has 
to be, before statistical significance of the comparison between treatment groups is lost.  For TKV, the 
p-value does not exceed 0.05 (loss of significance) until 333% of the tolvaptan estimated treatment 
effect  is  subtracted  from  tolvaptan  imputed  data  value.    This  reduction  in  treatment  effect  would 
equate to TKV growth at Month 36 of 40.25%.  For eGFR, the p-value does not exceed 0.05 until 267% 
of the tolvaptan estimated treatment effect is subtracted from the imputed data - this equates to 
eGFR decline at Month 36 of 16.19mL/min/1.73m2, which corresponds to an increase of over 60%.  
The provided discussion (based on literature) provides reassurance that these penalized imputations 
are very conservative and highly unlikely. 
The  Applicant  presented  sensitivity  analyses  with  BOCF  for  the  primary  endpoint  TKV  and  renal 
function.    These  results  show  a  statistically  significant  treatment  effect  in  favour  of  Tolvaptan  at 
months 12, 24 and 36, with the largest effect (95% CI) of -9.99 (-11.70, -8.26) see at Month 36 for 
TKV. For renal function, the largest treatment effect (95% CI) of 3.54 (2.43, 4.65) was seen at Month 
32 
Further analyses of renal function show that treatment effects were significant after exclusion of the 
possible confounding of dehydration secondary to the aquaretic effects of tolvaptan. Robust evidence 
of a clinically relevant effect is required, given that there is only one pivotal trial, and as tolvaptan is 
a new pharmacological principle in ADPKD, with no therapies approved in the proposed indication. 
Generally however, the study was well designed, well conducted, and based on a plausible hypothesis 
of  action.  It  is  also  supported  by  preclinical,  in  vitro  and  clinical  pharmacology  data,  with  several 
smaller supporting studies and support for the choice of endpoints in the published literature.  The 
high level of statistical significance, lack of obvious internal bias or concerning centre effects, and 
support from subgroup analyses are reassuring, and the observed effect size in the primary endpoint 
is of definite clinical interest.  
The study authors note that as all patients were asked to maintain good hydration and avoid thirst, a 
substantial  number  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group  reported  polyuria  and  nocturia.  Although 
maintaining  hydration  helped  ensure  that  the  blinding  in  the  study  was  maintained,  the  authors 
speculate  whether  suppression  of  vasopressin  release  in  the  placebo  group  may  have  led  to  an 
underestimation of the beneficial effect of tolvaptan. However, increased water intake to suppress 
vasopressin-mediated cAMP generation is already recommended for patients with ADPKD6.  It is not 
known whether an even higher water intake would have reduced the effect size of tolvaptan further, 
although whether this is tolerable for the patient or appropriate is not clear. 
Although there is no suggestion from the data that the tolvaptan and placebo groups are converging, 
and the decrease in urine osmolality in tolvaptan subjects at month 36 remains comparable to the

long term extension study of the pivotal trial as outlined in the RMP and Annex II.  
Key composite secondary endpoint 
Overall,  there  was  a  statistically  significant  13.5 %  rate  reduction  compared to  placebo.  This  was 
however driven by changes in 2 out of the 4 components of the composite variable. These were the 
events of renal function decline (based on a 25% decrease in the reciprocal of serum creatinine, an 
increase in serum creatinine of 33%) and renal pain (severe renal pain requiring medical intervention). 
No trend for a benefit was seen for the specified hypertension or albuminuria events. The analysis of 
time to first composite ADPKD event also showed a benefit in favour of tolvaptan.  
For  the  secondary  composite  endpoint,  analyses  of  time  to  first  event  as  well  as  the  number  of 
recurrent events per 100 follow-up years have been provided.  The applicant presented a tipping point 
analysis where it is assumed that both groups would follow the Kaplan-Meir curve of time to first event 
observed  in  placebo  subjects,  which  correspond  to  the  total  of  unobserved  events  in  both  groups 
respectively of 50 and 8.  With this approach, the applicant concluded that 58 unobserved events 
would have to be assumed to have occurred in subjects who withdraw from tolvaptan for statistical 
significance to be lost. Analysis based on this assumption is not conservative.  
The applicant presented additional analyses based on estimates imputed by the KM curve of placebo 
subjects. The tipping point analysis for the time to first event showed that statistical significance is 
lost when 116% of tolvaptan efficacy is lost.  
The HR (95% CI) previously reported for time to recurrent events, based on non-adjudicated events, 
was  0.865  (0.775,  0.965)  corresponding  to  a  total  number  of  recurrent  events  of  1049  and  665 
(original report Table 9.4.1) in the tolvaptan and placebo groups.  When missing data are treated as 
an event, the total number of recurrent events in the tolvaptan and placebo groups are 1262 and 726.  
The HR (95% CI) when missing values are treated as events is 0.953 (0.861, 1.054) 
The time to recurrent events analyses  with missing data treated as an event  show that statistical 
significance is lost when 111% of tolvaptan efficacy is lost.  This loss of efficacy corresponds to an HR 
(95% CI) of 0.906 (0.815, 1.006).  The corresponding events are 1304 in the Tolvaptan group and 
725 in the Placebo group. 
The hazard ratio relating to renal function decline was 0.386 (95% CI 0.263 to 0.566) and for renal 
pain the HR was 0.642 (95% CI 0.466 to 0.887). These correspond to a relative improvement of 61.4% 
and 35.8% respectively. Analyses of time to first event for these specific endpoints were consistent.  
The numbers of worsening renal function events are low, but consistent with the relatively intact renal 
function at study entry, the relatively slow rate of renal function decline in ADPKD, and the length of 
the study.  Events that signaled a decline in renal function were delayed in both groups until around 
a year, with the separation of tolvaptan treatment from placebo treatment evident at approximately 
month 18, whilst the effect of tolvaptan on renal pain was observed earlier. 
For both the renal worsening and renal pain  components, the  numbers of events were small as  a 
proportion of the total events for the composite result. The subjective nature of renal pain and the 
characteristic  aquaretic  effects  of  tolvaptan  clearly  make  blinding  of  this  endpoint  more  difficult, 
although  the  main  analysis  was  done  on  the  basis  of  required  interventions  for  renal  pain. 
Investigator-reported  ADPKD  clinical  progression  events  for  subjects  taking  tolvaptan  relative  to 
subjects on placebo were evaluated by an independent adjudication committee, and aquaretic AEs did 
not correlate with the reporting of renal pain.  Irrespective of any blinding issues, whilst a large total 
kidney volume has been associated with renal pain in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies and the 
available data suggest a benefit for tolvaptan, data to show an effect of tolvaptan on renal pain or 
other clinical manifestations and symptoms of ADPKD are not considered robust at this time. More 
extensive and longer-term data will be provided within the two PAES.

Tolvaptan  was  hoped  to  lead  to  structural  as  well  as  functional  improvements  in  the  kidney.  The 
findings in hypertension and albuminuria components of the composite endpoint are disappointing, as 
these  are  adverse  prognostic  factors  in  ADPKD.  In  particular,  hypertension  aggravates  the 
progressive renal disease of ADPKD, and cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death in these 
patients.  The lack of significance of the hypertension endpoint was attributed by the applicant to the 
relatively high prevalence of treated hypertension seen in the population at baseline.  This is plausible. 
By the time cyst formation starts, the renin-angiotensin system is already activated and reduction of 
already formed but microscopic cysts might not reverse that trend. If treatment were started well 
before cyst formation starts, then we might see a change in prevalence in hypertension in comparison 
to placebo, but this population has not been studied. 
Worsening in albuminuria is also an adverse prognostic factor in ADPKD and the lack of effect on this 
endpoint is noted, although post-hoc analyses suggested a possibility for a late effect. This endpoint 
might again be affected by time of initiation of treatment. 
Rate of renal function decline 
In  the  pre  specified  3rd  endpoint,  Tolvaptan  treatment  slowed  the  rate  of  renal  function  decline 
(reciprocal of serum creatinine) by one-third compared to placebo, for which the predefined statistical 
criteria were met. This was confirmed by other estimation methods and demonstrated a significant 
association  with  the  rate  of  change  in  TKV.  The  mean  rate  of  change  per  year  in  estimated  GFR 
CKD-EPI was around -2.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 for the tolvaptan group and -3.6 for the placebo group.  
The  rate  of  GFR  decline  in  ADPKD  is  inexorable  but  relatively  slow.  To  put  the  eGFR  results  into 
context, rapid progression of renal impairment is generally defined in CKD as a sustained decline in 
eGFR  of  more  than  5  ml/min/1.73  m2/year.  Once  eGFR  decreases  below  30 mL/min,  there  is  a 
progressive impact of complications related to renal impairment. Although primarily dependent on 
symptoms, the need for renal replacement therapy often occurs in a GFR range between 5 and 10 
ml/min/1.73 m2. These later stages of CKD are therefore of particular interest for verification of the 
clinical effect of tolvaptan. Further long-term data to show that tolvaptan continues to slow the rate of 
renal  function  decline  and  delay  the  onset  of  end-stage  renal  disease  will  be  provided  post 
authorisation  within  the  long  term  extension  study  of  the  pivotal  trial  as  well  as  from  an  ongoing 
efficacy study in patients with later stages of renal insufficiency and with a primary endpoint related 
to GFR as outlined in Annex II and RMP. 
Other endpoints  
Beyond the third endpoint of renal function decline, none of the other planned secondary endpoints 
yielded clear trends. In any case, the rate of renal function change was the last endpoint for which the 
null  hypothesis  was  rejected;  therefore  subsequent  analyses  must  be  considered  in  the  light  of 
potential type 1 error. In an exploratory analysis, treatment with tolvaptan was associated with an 
improvement in selected ADPKD-related conditions.  A smaller proportion of subjects on tolvaptan 
reported  renal  pain,  nephrolithiasis,  haematuria,  UTI,  and  anaemia  as  compared  with  subjects  on 
placebo. However these results should be viewed with caution.   
Additional analyses 
Subgroup analyses of pivotal study 
For the primary endpoint, generally consistent results were seen in all subgroups, including those 
related to stratification factors, baseline disease severity, adverse prognostic factors, age, gender, 
and race. For the secondary and third efficacy endpoints, subgroup analyses produced nominal point 
estimates that generally favoured tolvaptan.  
The  CRISP  study  suggested  that  both  TKV  and  renal  function  worsen  more  quickly  for  those  with 
larger  kidney  volumes;  however  efficacy  was  also  suggested  for  subjects  with  TKV  ≥1000  ml  at 
Assessment Report 
EMA/154879/2015 
Page 86/124 
 
baseline, and for subjects with TKV ≥1500 ml at baseline. Efficacy was also shown in subjects grouped 
by estimated creatinine clearance less than, or greater than 80 mL/min.  An exploratory analysis by 
CKD stage was also submitted (Stage 1, 2, 3A, 3B, based on eGFRCKD-EPI). The favorable effects of 
tolvaptan  on  kidney  volume  were  consistent  at  various  stages  of  ADPKD.  Stage  2  CKD  is  a  wide 
grouping;  however  the  treatment  effect  on  kidney  growth  and  eGFR  decline  is  significant  both  in 
patients with baseline eGFR 60-74 and patients with baseline eGFR 75-89. 
Supportive studies 
Supportive evidence of efficacy in ADPKD is available from two separate 3-year, open-label extension 
trials, study and 156-05-002. Study 250 is more informative, as study 156-05-002 was in a smaller 
number  of  patients  and  involved  a  dose  of  15mg  b.d.  The  mean  results  from  study  156-04-250 
suggest an acute decrease in renal volume of 3-4% in the first month. This is uncertain given the 
small numbers, intersubject variability and the lack of a control arm; however a small acute effect on 
renal volume was also suggested in the shorter studies 156-06 and 156-09-284. In this exploratory 
data-set, TKV appeared to have a slower rate of decrease in the higher-dose group, and increased in 
the off-treatment period between month 36 and the start of the extension period. These data at the 
45/15 and 60/30 mg regimes suggests a dose-response for slowing TKV volume progression, and 
appear to confirm that continuous treatment with tolvaptan may be important.  
The  progression  of  ADPKD,  as  evidenced  by  both  increasing  total  kidney  volume  and  declining 
estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate,  was  significantly  slowed  after  3  years  of  tolvaptan  treatment 
compared  with  historical  control  data,  and  there  was  a  significant  negative  correlation  between 
annualized slope of TKV and slope of eGFR. The limitations to this historical comparison include the 
small number of patients in the open-label studies, the fact that tolvaptan dosing was not the same as 
in the pivotal study, and the age of the MRDR data.  
Based on preliminary data of the long term extension of the pivotal study (trial 156- 08-271) the 
beneficial effect of tolvaptan was maintained during the 2-years of treatment. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, total kidney volume increased by 18.8% in placebo subjects over 3 
years but by around half that (9.6%) in tolvaptan subjects. A large total kidney volume has been 
associated  with  hypertension,  gross  hematuria,  nephrolithiasis,  and  pain  in  cross-sectional  and 
longitudinal studies. The applicant has supported the use of total kidney volume as a primary endpoint 
with good clinical arguments and literature. The data to show a reduction in cyst development are 
considered clinically compelling.  
Whereas  a  relevant  effect  on  renal  function  decline  could  be  shown  in  the  secondary  composite 
endpoint of the pivotal study and the rate of renal function decline showed significant association with 
the rate of change in TKV (as in other recent literature), effects of tolvaptan on renal pain or other 
clinical manifestations and symptoms of ADPKD are not considered robust at this time.  
In the pivotal trial a patient population with a relatively large renal volume consistent with rapid cystic 
growth,  but  reasonably  preserved  renal  function  was  evaluated  (patients  with  early  but  rapidly 
progressive disease). 
The indication was therefore, and also in view of safety considerations as discussed below, amended 
to reflect patients in whom clinically relevant benefit has been clearly shown. 
Furthermore,  considering  that  efficacy  assessment  and  extrapolation  to  long  term  outcomes,  is 
largely based on the surrogate parameter TKV more extensive long term data and data on patients in 
later stages of the disease is needed to confirm efficacy assumption based on hard clinical outcomes. 
This will be done within two post authorisation efficacy studies as described in Annex II and RMP.

The SPC clearly states that data are not currently available to show whether long-term therapy with 
Jinarc  continues  to  slow  the  rate  of  renal  function  decline  and  affect  clinical  outcomes  of  ADPKD, 
including delay in the onset of end-stage renal disease. 
The combination of a targeted indication to a population where the benefits have been conclusively 
demonstrated,  adequate  information  to  the  prescriber  and  the  post  approval  follow  up  leads  to  a 
relevant net benefit even if balanced against the risks discussed further below. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Thirteen clinical trials in the ADPKD program have been completed.  Four trials are currently on-going, 
including 1 multinational trial, 1 in the US and 2 in Japan.  Of the 4 on-going trials, Trial 156-09-290 
is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating safety and efficacy of tolvaptan 
(modified  release  formulation)  in  subjects  with  ADPKD.    Because  this  trial  is  still  blinded,  only 
preliminary  safety  information  with  all  treatment  groups  combined  are  described  in  this  safety 
summary,  and  enrolled  subjects  are  not  included  in  estimates  of  tolvaptan  exposure.    In  the 
remaining 3 on-going trials, all subjects are receiving open-label tolvaptan. 
At the cut-off date 31 March 2012, approximately 6331 adult patients worldwide were exposed to oral 
tolvaptan in clinical trials in ADPKD and other indications.  Since the first date of marketing approval 
of  tolvaptan  (19/5/09  through  to  18/5/12)  total  post-marketing  exposure  to  tolvaptan  based  on 
worldwide  sales  figures  in  indications  other  than  ADPKD  is  estimated  at  approximately  3790 
patient-years.  
The safety database for the ADPKD submission includes 1581 subjects exposed to at least 1 dose of 
immediate-release tolvaptan in completed or on-going clinical trials. This population includes 1432 
subjects with ADPKD, 37 non-ADPKD subjects with normal renal function or varying degrees of renal 
impairment,  and  112  healthy  subjects.  Of  the  1432  ADPKD  subjects  exposed,  1292  have  been 
exposed for up to 6 months, 1017 for up to 12 months, and 801 for up to 36 months.  961 subjects 
with ADPKD were randomized to tolvaptan in the phase 3 pivotal Trial 156-04-251, with 864 subjects 
exposed for at least 8 months and 836 subjects exposed for 1 year or longer. The average daily dose 
of tolvaptan received at Month 36 was 96.45 mg.

The primary safety dataset is from the pivotal, placebo-controlled Trial 156-04-251. Based on findings 
from  the  pivotal  trial,  safety  analyses  were  extended  to  include  supportive  ADPKD  program  trial 
datasets, as well as clinical datasets and post marketing surveillance from other indications (e.g., 
hyponatraemia, heart failure) when necessary to further explore important potential safety signals.  
Adverse events 
Table 12: Pivotal trial: adverse events (all causalities) within the treatment period 
97.9%  of  tolvaptan-treated  subjects  and  97.1%  of  placebo  treated  subjects  had  at  least  one 
treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) in the pivotal study. Treatment-emergent AEs reported in 
≥ 10% of subjects in either or both treatment group included thirst, polyuria, hypertension, nocturia, 
renal pain, headache, pollakiuria, nasopharyngitis, dry mouth, blood creatinine increased, back pain, 
fatigue, diarrhoea, dizziness, polydipsia, nausea, urinary tract infection, and haematuria.  
Adverse  events  directly  associated  with  the  aquaretic  effects  of  tolvaptan  (e.g.,  thirst,  polyuria, 
nocturia, pollakiuria and dry mouth) were observed in a higher proportion of tolvaptan subjects in the 
first 3 months following initiation of therapy than during maintenance treatment.  
TEAEs that led to discontinuation of study drug were reported in approximately 15% of subjects on 
tolvaptan compared with approximately 4% of subjects on placebo.  The most frequently reported 
events  resulting  in  treatment  discontinuation  were  polyuria,  nocturia,  pollakiuria,  thirst,  abnormal 
hepatic  function  and  fatigue.      Overall,  TEAEs  associated  with  ADPKD  (including  renal  pain, 
haematuria,  anaemia,  urinary  tract  infection  and  nephrolithiasis)  were  reported  at  a  relatively 
uniform  rate  throughout  the  trial.    There  were  numerical  reductions  in  favour  of  tolvaptan  for 
haematuria,  urinary  tract  infection  and  anaemia.    There  was  no  indication  that  tolvaptan  had  a 
clinically meaningful effect on the occurrence of vascular abnormalities associated with ADPKD, or on 
other cysts outside of the kidney.   
Flank  pain  or  renal  pain  were  reported  in  a  smaller  proportion  of  subjects  treated  with  tolvaptan 
(27.7%) compared with subjects treated with placebo (36.9%) and fewer such events in tolvaptan 
subjects were reported as severe or serious.  
Assessment Report 
EMA/154879/2015 
Page 89/124 
 
 
 
Across the whole ADPKD program, frequently reported TEAEs in other long-term and short-term trials 
of tolvaptan were consistent with those observed in Trial 156-04-251, and AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation were similar in the 2 long-term open studies.  
Adverse events of particular interest 
Hepatic toxicity  
In the pivotal trial, the incidence of elevated transaminase levels for tolvaptan subjects (> 3 × ULN) 
was approximately 3 to 4-fold higher than for placebo subjects.  The overall incidence of serious 
hepatic TEAEs was also higher for tolvaptan subjects (2.3%, 22/961) than for placebo subjects (1.0%, 
5/483)  
The applicant formed an independent, blinded, expert Hepatic Adjudication Committee for the 
post-hoc sequential evaluation and adjudication of these events in the ADPKD program (data from 
completed trials and data from on-going trials received through 31 Mar 2012).  This process will 
continue for on-going trials. 
59 subjects from ADPKD clinical trials were identified as meeting the hepatic event criteria for further 
evaluation.  The criteria for “potentially serious liver injury” were: 
- ALT/AST > 3 × ULN accompanied by total bilirubin > 2 × ULN 
-Total bilirubin elevation occurring within 30 days of the transaminase elevation 
- No evidence of cholestasis (serum alkaline phosphatase < 2 × ULN) 
- Other causes of hepatic injury were excluded by medical differential diagnosis 
This  adjudication  revealed  that  3 tolvaptan  subjects  in  the  ADPKD  program  met  requirements  for 
potentially serious liver injury.  2 of these were from the pivotal study, 1 from the extension study 
156-08-271.  The  onset  of  hepatocellular  injury,  as  manifested  by  transaminase  values  exceeding 
3 × ULN, was characteristically observed after at least 3 months of treatment, but could occur after 1 
year.

liver injury 
Transaminase elevations associated with tolvaptan treatment were reversible (returned to ≤ 3 × ULN

injury  or  dysfunction.    No  subjects  experienced  hepatic  failure,  hepatic  transplantation,  or  death 
resulting from hepatocellular injury.  For the 3 cases adjudicated as highly likely, the safety report 
mentions liver biopsy in 1 case – this was a picture of cytolytic hepatitis with evidence of centrilobular 
necrosis.  
No  association  with  tolvaptan  dose  or  exposure  was  found.    Given  the  small  numbers,  a  clear 
association  between  tolvaptan  and  demographic  characteristics,  or  disease  characteristics  was 
inconclusive. TEAEs of increased ALT/AST were however more common in tolvaptan subjects with a 
baseline eCrCLCG < 80 mL/min compared to those with better renal function (5.4% compared to 3.2 
and 3.6% respectively)  
An updated report was submitted during the procedure, which includes an additional 2 years of data 
(31 Mar 2012 to 28 February 2014) from the extension study. As of March 2014, 1275 patients had 
received tolvaptan through the estimated “window of susceptibility” of 18 months, up from 838 in the 
2012 adjudication report. There were no new cases meeting criteria for potentially serious liver injury 
in this update.  
Retrospective  evaluation  of  data  from  the  separate  hyponatraemia  and  heart  failure  clinical 
development  programs  did  not  reveal  an  imbalance  of  subjects  with  elevated  AST/ALT  between 
tolvaptan  and  placebo  groups,  nor  were  any  of  the  subjects  adjudicated  as  “highly  likely”  or 
“probable”.  Tolvaptan as the Samsca licence (hyponatraemia indication) was first approved in 2009.  
Since the first date of approval of tolvaptan through to 18/5/12, worldwide post marketing exposure 
to  tolvaptan  is  estimated  at  approximately  3790  patient  years.  No  signal  of  tolvaptan-induced 
hepatotoxicity has been detected during this post marketing experience. 
Electrolyte balance 
Tolvaptan did not have a clinically meaningful effect on serum potassium or calcium concentrations in 
subjects  with  ADPKD.  The  rate  of  potentially  clinically  significant  increased  sodium  abnormalities 
(sodium > 150 mEq/L) was higher in the tolvaptan group (4.0%) compared with the placebo group 
(1.4%)  in  the  pivotal  trial.  Following  titration  of  tolvaptan  in  the  first  3  weeks,  mean  changes  (± 
standard deviation) from baseline to Week 3 in serum sodium were 2.24 ± 2.71 mEq/L on tolvaptan 
compared  with  0.02  ±  2.45  mEq/L  on  placebo.  A  higher  incidence  in  TEAEs  related  to  increased 
sodium  concentrations  was  also  observed  in  tolvaptan  subjects  (5.2%)  compared  with  placebo 
subjects (1.4 %), which were predominantly mild in severity and reported early following initiation of 
treatment.  No events were serious, and none led to study drug discontinuation.   
Hyperuricaemia 
In the pivotal trial, an increased level of uric acid (greater than 10 mg/dL) was reported at a higher 
rate in the tolvaptan group (6.2%) compared with the placebo group (1.7%). Similarly, TEAEs related 
to increases in uric acid were more frequent in the tolvaptan group (5.1%) than the placebo group 
(2.7%).  There was a higher incidence of the ADR “Increased blood uric acid” (2.5% vs. 1.2%) and of 
“gout”  (2.9%  vs.  1.4%)  in  tolvaptan  subjects  compared  with  placebo  subjects.    No  events  were 
considered serious and none led to study drug discontinuation.  In the safety population, the use of 
allopurinol at any time during trial treatment was documented in 65/961 tolvaptan subjects (6.8%) 
and 25/483 placebo subjects (5.2%) 
Renal impairment 
The rate of significantly increased creatinine abnormalities was lower in the tolvaptan group (16.7%) 
compared with the placebo group (21.0%) in the pivotal trial. A slightly lower incidence of acute renal 
failure TEAEs was observed in tolvaptan subjects, TEAEs of increased creatinine were similar between 
the 2 treatment groups. All reports of increased blood creatinine were rated as mild to moderate in 
severity.  TEAEs  of  increased  blood  creatinine  led  to  discontinuation  of  study  drug  in  3  tolvaptan 
subjects (0.3%) during the pivotal trial. 
Assessment Report 
EMA/154879/2015 
Page 91/124 
 
Upon  withdrawal  of  treatment,  serum  creatinine  concentrations  decreased  to  concentrations  that 
were significantly lower in tolvaptan than placebo subjects, indicating that tolvaptan subjects had had 
smaller  net  increases  in  serum  creatinine  during  the  trial.    This  corresponds  to  an  increase  from 
baseline to follow-up Visit 2 in the mean serum creatinine level from 1.05 mg/dL to 1.21 mg/dL in the 
tolvaptan group, as compared with an increase from 1.04 mg/dL to 1.27 mg/dL in the placebo group. 
Cardiovascular effects and thrombosis 
Reports of TEAEs in the myocardial infarction SMQ were comparable between the 2 treatment groups 
(0.7%  on  tolvaptan,  0.6%  on  placebo)  and  overall,  tolvaptan  did  not  appear  to  increase 
cardiovascular  risk  in  subjects  with  ADPKD.  A  higher  proportion  of  subjects  on  tolvaptan  (7.4%) 
reported events related to arrhythmia compared with subjects on placebo (4.6%) This difference was 
primarily due to a higher incidence of palpitations and syncope in the tolvaptan group.  All TEAEs of 
palpitations  or  syncope  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.    Four  tolvaptan  subjects  experienced 
serious  TEAEs  in  the  arrhythmia-related  investigations,  signs,  and  symptoms  SMQ  (1  with 
palpitations,  1  with  palpitations  and  syncope,  and  2  with  loss  of  consciousness)  compared  with  1 
placebo  subject  (bradycardia).  None  of  the  events  in  this  analysis  resulted  in  study  drug 
discontinuation. 
Hyperglycaemia 
Increased  glucose  concentrations  were  observed  less  frequently  in  subjects  on  tolvaptan  (5.5%) 
compared  with  subjects  on  placebo  (6.8%)  and  potentially  clinically  significant  decreased  glucose 
concentrations  occurred  at  similar  rates  in  the  tolvaptan  and  placebo  groups  (3.8%  and  3.7%, 
respectively).    Mean  changes  from  baseline  to  Month 36  in  serum  glucose  concentrations  were 
0.90 ± 17.38 mg/dL in the tolvaptan group and −0.36 ± 17.36 mg/dL in the placebo group.  
Reported  TEAEs  in  the  hyperglycaemia/new  onset  diabetes  mellitus  SMQ  were  however  more 
frequent  in  subjects  on  tolvaptan  (76.9%)  compared  with  subjects  on  placebo  (41.2%).  This 
difference was primarily due to an increased incidence of thirst and polyuria. Excluding these lead to 
more similar events between the 2 treatment groups (18.4% vs. 17.0%), although still a numerical 
increase in the tolvaptan group. The proportions of subjects who experienced serious TEAEs  were 
however similar between the 2 treatment groups and discontinuations due to hyperglycaemia TEAEs 
were infrequent.  
While  theoretical  mechanisms  exist  whereby  tolvaptan  might  affect  glucose  homeostasis,  the 
proportion of subjects with changes in glucose concentrations and the incidence of TEAEs related to 
hyperglycaemia during the trial were similar between the 2 treatment groups.  In contrast, TEAEs of 
diabetes  were  reported  exclusively  in  tolvaptan  subjects  in  the  pivotal  trial;  however,  the  total 
number of cases was small (n = 7).  Overall however, the applicant concludes that an association 
between tolvaptan use and hyperglycaemia/new onset diabetes TEAEs cannot be excluded. This has 
now been reflected in the SmPC (see also discussion on safety).  
Glaucoma  
In the pivotal study, TEAEs in the glaucoma SMQ (glaucoma, eye pain, increased intraocular pressure, 
blurred vision, and reduced visual acuity) were reported in 2.1% (20/961) of subjects in the tolvaptan 
group and 1.0% (5/483) of subjects in the placebo group.  For the 3 terms most specific to glaucoma 
(glaucoma,  open  angle  glaucoma,  and  intraocular  pressure  increased)  the  incidences  were  0.7% 
(7/961) in the tolvaptan group vs. 0.4% (2/483) in the placebo group.  Treatment-emergent AEs of 
glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, eye pain, and blurred vision were all mild to moderate in 
severity, with the exception of 1 tolvaptan subject who reported a serious TEAE of severe glaucoma.  
Also, 2 early-treated tolvaptan subjects in trial 156-08-271 reported TEAES of mild glaucoma during 
treatment, one of which was a subject who had an event of glaucoma in the pivotal trial that worsened 
in trial 156-08-271.

The  applicants  review  of  all  reported  cases  of  glaucoma  or  open  angle  glaucoma  did  not  reveal 
associated AEs, laboratory abnormalities, concomitant medications, or physical examination findings 
that indicated a clear pattern of exacerbating factors, or suggested a causal link to tolvaptan.  With 
the exception of 1 case that occurred on day 4 (placebo subject), the remaining events appeared to 
occur later in treatment (many after 2 to 3 years of treatment). The sponsor engaged an external 
independent expert in ophthalmology and glaucoma, to complete a blinded review of the 7 cases from 
trial 156-04-251 for possible attribution of causality.  Following this review, the expert found no clear 
and consistent pattern that would attribute these events to study drug. However, glaucoma will be 
investigated in the PASS and will be subject to targeted follow up (see also discussion on safety). 
Neoplasia  
A further potential new safety signal in Trial 156-04-251 was an increased incidence of TEAEs in the 
malignant neoplasms SMQ (1.7% vs. 0.4%), in particular basal cell carcinoma (0.8% vs. 0.2%) on 
tolvaptan.  In the wider SOC of “neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified (including cysts and 
polyps),” TEAEs were recorded in 45 subjects (4.7%) in the tolvaptan group and 19 (3.9%) in the 
placebo group.  Treatment-emergent AEs in the “malignant tumour” SMQ were reported in 1.7% of 
subjects in the tolvaptan group and 0.4% of subjects in the placebo group with a calculated OR for the 
treatment-group comparison of 4.072 (95% CI 0.932, 17.782).  None of the reported TEAEs in the 
malignant tumour SMQ were considered potentially related to study drug by the investigator. 
Table  13:  Incidence  of  Treatment-emergent  Adverse  Events  in  the  Neoplasm  SMQs  in  Trial 
156-04-251 by MedDRA System Organ Class and Preferred Term 
Overall, for the 16 tolvaptan subjects in the pivotal trial with malignant neoplasm events, the majority 
(10/16 subjects) had relevant history or presence of a risk factor for development of the neoplasm.  
The time to onset (regardless of neoplasm type) in the pivotal trial ranged from 121 to 1088 days 
after initiation of tolvaptan.  No imbalance in overall malignant tumours was seen in the controlled 
data from non-ADPKD studies. Combined with controlled data from non-ADPK studies, the overall 
incidence of basal cell carcinoma was 15/4255 (0.4%) vs. 6/3221 (0.2%) 
The baseline prevalence and incidence of new occurrences of skin neoplasm (basal cell carcinoma) will 
be further characterized in the proposed PASS.  The assessment of this safety signal will be performed 
through routine pharmacovigilance and communicated as appropriate. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths in the pivotal study.  As of 31/3/12, a total of 2 subjects died due to TEAEs while 
participating in tolvaptan trials in the ADPKD program.  One was due to a self-inflicted gunshot wound, 
the other assessed as due to subarachnoid haemorrhage secondary to ruptured cerebral aneurysm.  
Neither were assessed as related to tolvaptan by the investigator.

In the pivotal trial safety population, the proportion of subjects on tolvaptan who experienced at least 
1 serious TEAE (18.4%) was nominally lower than on placebo (19.7%).  Tolvaptan treatment was 
associated  with  a  decreased  incidence  of  serious  TEAEs  associated  with  ADPKD  worsening  or 
complications,  such  as  urinary  tract  infection,  pyelonephritis,  renal  pain,  hypertension,  and 
haemorrhage  into  renal  cysts.    Serious  TEAEs  reported  in  tolvaptan  subjects  at  ≥  0.5%  higher 
incidence than in placebo subjects included increased ALT, increased AST, and headache. The events 
relating to hepatic toxicity are discussed above. Otherwise, no particular pattern arises.  
Serious TEAEs in long-term supportive trials of tolvaptan in ADPKD subjects were infrequent and most 
reported  TEAE  terms  were  consistent  with  those  observed  in  Trial  156-04-251.  Across  supportive 
short-term trials, only 2 subjects experienced serious TEAEs (polyuria, angina) and there were no 
serious TEAEs in the healthy subject trials.  
Laboratory findings 
Events relating to renal and liver function tests, uric acid, potassium, sodium, glucose and calcium are 
discussed  in  other  sections.    No  significant  differences  in  other  biochemistry  or  haematology 
parameters were seen. 
Safety in special populations 
Pregnancy and breast feeding 
As of 31/3/12, there have been 6 documented live births, 3 reported spontaneous abortions, and 5 
reported  elective  abortions  in  tolvaptan  trials  within  the  ADPKD  program.    Based  on  available 
follow-up  information,  no  birth  defects  have  been  reported.  It  is  unknown  whether  tolvaptan  is 
excreted in human milk; however, excretion of tolvaptan in breast milk in animal studies has been 
demonstrated.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued (contraindication) when  receiving tolvaptan, 
and it is contra-indicated in pregnancy (refer to non-clinical assessment above (chapter 2.3 of this 
assessment report). 
Children 
There are no existing or new data in children; the proposed indication is restricted to adults.  
Gender, race and age 
Overall, there were no conclusive and clinically important differences in adverse events attributable to 
treatment with tolvaptan, based on gender, race, or age. The mean age of subjects at randomization 
was however 38.7 years in the pivotal trial, as the inclusion criteria restricted to patients up to 50 
years old. The SmPC was updated to state that, the safety and effectiveness of tolvaptan in ADPKD 
patients  aged  over  50  has  not  yet  been  established.  Additional  safety  information  is  available  for 
tolvaptan  in  other  indications,  which  typically  included  elderly  subjects.  In  these  programs,  no 
significant age-related risks were identified.  
Renal impairment  
The incidence of specific adverse events of interest in this group is covered separately in the sections 
above where appropriate. Overall, the proportions of subjects in each treatment group who reported 
TEAEs during the pivotal trial were similar regardless of baseline renal function in the pivotal trial. As 
detailed in the pharmacology section, subjects with or without ADPKD and varying degrees of renal 
function  were  enrolled  in  3  completed  short-term  trials  (Trials  156-09-282,  156-06-260,  and 
156-09-284).  No differences of concern emerged, although the numbers of subjects were small. 
TEAEs  associated  with  the  aquaretic  effects  of  tolvaptan  such  as  thirst  and  excessive  urination 
occurred at a lower incidence in subjects with reduced renal function compared with subjects who had 
Assessment Report 
EMA/154879/2015 
Page 94/124 
 
normal or preserved renal function. This effect was considered to be due to a smaller increase in urine 
output relative to a higher baseline urine output, attributable to a smaller number of fully functioning 
nephrons and decreased sensitivity to AVP.  
Hepatic impairment 
No new formal studies in patients with hepatic impairment are submitted for the ADPKD indication, 
nor is an integrated analysis of adverse events according to baseline degree of hepatic impairment 
submitted. The safety overview does note that in subjects with cirrhosis treated with tolvaptan in prior 
hyponatraemia  trials,  an  increased  incidence  of  GI  bleeding  was  noted  in  subjects  on  tolvaptan 
compared with subjects on placebo.  However, there were no subjects with late-stage cirrhosis in the 
ADPKD trials. 
Immunological events 
The TEAE of rash was seen in 4.2% tolvaptan subjects in the pivotal trial, vs. 1.9% of placebo subjects. 
TEAEs in the anaphylactic reaction SMQ were reported in 25.3% of subjects in the tolvaptan group 
and 20.1% of subjects in the placebo group in the pivotal trial. This difference was primarily due to 
increased incidences of rash and dyspnoea in the tolvaptan group.  Events of urticaria, pruritus, and 
chest discomfort were also slightly more frequent in subjects on tolvaptan compared with subjects on 
placebo.  All reports of rash, pruritus, or chest discomfort were mild or moderate in severity in both 
treatment groups.  Serious anaphylaxis-related TEAEs were reported in 1.0% of subjects on tolvaptan 
and 0.2% of subjects on placebo.  Two tolvaptan subjects (0.2%) and 1 placebo subject (0.2%) 
experienced serious treatment emergent AEs related to anaphylaxis, with reported terms of 
anaphylactic reaction and respiratory failure.  
The case of anaphylaxis on tolvaptan was reported 3 to 6 months after the initiation of treatment and 
was moderate in severity. The case narrative reports a temporal relationship with amoxicillin, the 
sponsor assessed the event as unrelated to tolvaptan, and the patient continued on tolvaptan.  The 
case of respiratory failure was also moderate and occurred after month 33, and occurred in the 
context of advancing hepatic involvement and pleural/pericardial effusion.  Neither of these 2 events 
led to discontinuation of trial therapy. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No AEs with the preferred term of ‘drug interaction’ were reported by investigators during the pivotal 
trial, and no unexpected signals arise from review of adverse events in patients taking various drug 
categories.   
Discontinuation due to adverse events

Post marketing experience 
At the time of submission the product was not authorized in any country for the treatment of patients 
with ADKPD. From the last PSUR interval (19 May 2013 – 18 May 2014) on Samsca (tolvaptan 
authorised for the treatment of clinically significant hyponatraemia secondary to syndrome of 
inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) in adult patients) no safety concerns have arisen. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
General  
As initially submitted, of the 1432 ADPKD subjects exposed to tolvaptan, 1292 were exposed for up to 
6 months, 1017 for up to 12 months, and 801 for up to 36 months.  961 subjects with ADPKD were 
randomized to tolvaptan in the phase 3 pivotal Trial 156-04-251, with 864 subjects exposed for at 
least 8 months and 836 subjects exposed for 1 year or longer. The average daily dose of tolvaptan 
received at Month 36 was 96.45 mg. Some supportive information is available from clinical studies 
and  post-marketing  data  relating  to  use  in  hypernatraemia.  Overall  the  number  of  exposed 
individuals and treatment duration is reasonable for an application of this nature. 
In  the  pivotal  study,  there  were  significantly  more  discontinuations  due  to  adverse  events  in  the 
tolvaptan  arm  compared  to  the  placebo  group  (15%  vs.  4.3%)  The  commonest  adverse  events 
associated with tolvaptan in the ADPKD program were as expected from its aquaretic effect. These 
included thirst, polyuria, nocturia, pollakiuria, and dry mouth. In the pivotal trial, aquaresis-related 
adverse events led to the discontinuation of tolvaptan in approximately 8% of participants, mostly 
within the first month. Fluid intake must be adjusted to balance increased urine output, particularly 
important in subjects with impaired renal function. These adverse events are inconvenient, and for 
some  patients  the  frequent  need  to  urinate  and  replace  with  fluids  is  intolerably  disruptive.  Any 
change in serum sodium appears manageable clinically through appropriate guidance regarding fluid 
intake, clinical monitoring and dose reduction.  
At the initiation of tolvaptan therapy there is a small and reversible reduction in GFR, the mechanism 
is  not  fully  defined  (refer  to  discussion  in  clinical  pharmacology  section).    Data  suggest  that  the 
absolute decrease is lower in patients with more severe renal impairment, but the numbers of such 
patients are limited.  Even if the decline is small, in patients with more severe renal impairment it can 
become more significant as a percentage of residual renal function. 
Generally, other adverse events in the ADPKD program linked to tolvaptan have previously also been 
established in the separate Samsca licence.  
Significant hepatic toxicity however appears to be limited to the ADPKD population. Potential new 
signals from the ADPKD program of glaucoma/intra-ocular pressure and basal cell carcinoma are also 
highlighted both will be monitored with in the PASS (as described in the RMP).

There were no deaths in the pivotal study, or other deaths in the ADPKD program assessed as related 
to tolvaptan.  Overall, the proportion of subjects on tolvaptan who experienced at least 1 serious TEAE 
(18.4%) was similar to the placebo group.  
Hepatic toxicity  
In the pivotal trial, the incidence of elevated transaminase levels for tolvaptan subjects (> 3 × ULN) 
was  approximately  3  to  4-fold  higher  than  for  placebo  subjects.    The  overall  incidence  of  serious 
hepatic TEAEs was higher for tolvaptan subjects (2.3%, 22/961) than for placebo subjects (1.0%, 
5/483). An independent, blinded, expert Hepatic Adjudication Committee reviewed all available data 
in ADPKD patients.  This process will continue for on-going trials. 59 subjects from ADPKD clinical 
trials were identified as meeting the hepatic event criteria for further evaluation.   This adjudication 
revealed that 3 tolvaptan subjects in the ADPKD program met the criteria for potentially serious liver 
injury, based on the extent of transaminase and total bilirubin rise, lack of evidence for cholestasis 
and exclusion of other causes (as detailed above).  2 of these cases were from the pivotal study, 1 
from the extension study 156-08-271.  
The onset of hepatocellular injury, as manifested by transaminase values exceeding 3 × ULN, was 
characteristically observed after at least 3 months of treatment, but could occur after 1 year.  The 
transaminase elevations associated with tolvaptan treatment were reversible (returned to ≤ 3 × ULN 
typically within 1 to 4 months), and were not associated with fulminant liver failure, or permanent 
liver injury or dysfunction.  No subjects experienced hepatic failure, hepatic transplantation, or death 
resulting from hepatocellular injury.  However, as concluded by the submitted liver safety report, in 
patients with ADPKD, tolvaptan has the potential to cause liver injury that could progress to liver 
failure.  The number of subjects with ADPKD currently exposed is insufficient to rule out less common 
but severe hepatic toxicity.  
Overall, the association of tolvaptan with significant elevations of liver function tests is a clear signal. 
There  is  a  characteristic  pattern  of  hepatocellular  injury  after  3-15  months  of  treatment,  with  a 
continued rise in serum ALT/AST for weeks to months after discontinuation of therapy, followed by 
gradual resolution over 1-4 months. 2 cases had a positive rechallenge. The dose difference between 
the non-ADPKD population and the ADPKD population could account for the absence of a safety signal 
in  the  non-ADPKD  trials,  however  tolvaptan  plasma  concentrations  in  the  heart  failure  population 
significantly overlap those observed in the ADPKD population.  The pattern of liver disease is also 
probably idiosyncratic, so may not have a dose-response, indeed no association with tolvaptan dose 
or exposure was found.   
As  of  March  2014,  1275  patients  have  received  tolvaptan  through  the  estimated  “window  of 
susceptibility” of 18 months, up from 838 in the 2012 adjudication report. There have been no new 
cases meeting the criteria for potentially serious liver injury, which offers some reassurance. 
The 3 cases correspond to about 1:400 patients treated for at least 18 months. Assuming 10% of such 
cases  will  progress  to  acute  liver  failure  the  estimate  of  incidence  of  acute  liver  failure  in  ADPKD 
patients chronically receiving treated with tolvaptan might be estimated at 1 in 4,000.  Obviously, 
more cases had elevations of LFTs with a less certain causal link, and the available cases do not allow 
a definitive estimate of event frequency.   
Jinarc is to be prescribed with blood testing for hepatic transaminases and bilirubin required prior to 
initiation of Jinarc, continuing monthly for 18 months and three monthly thereafter. Additional safety 
profiling to evaluate further the risk of hepatic injury with Jinarc use in a real world setting will be 
carried out within a post authorisation safety study as mentioned in Annex II and described in the RMP. 
For concurrent monitoring for symptoms that may indicate liver injury clear stopping rules related to 
LFTs or symptoms/signs consistent with hepatic injury have been included in the SmPC, along with 
guidelines for permanent discontinuation.

There are a number of features to take into account. Whilst reversible to date, the typical presentation 
is progression of injury for several weeks after stopping drug treatment. So far, cases of potentially 
severe liver injury have been restricted to the ADPKD population and there may be a genetic or other 
basis for this (the mechanism is not currently known). However post-marketing data and trial data 
from other study programs may give  reassurance on the event incidence.  
Based on limited data, liver injury appears to occur after 3 months - however it is not possible to 
implement  stopping  rules  based  on  lack  of  efficacy  within  this  timeframe.  Cystic  liver  disease  is 
common in ADPKD patients; this may pose additional problems or confer further risk, although on the 
limited  data  available,  there  is  no  clear  relationship  between  cystic  liver  disease  at  baseline  and 
subsequent risk of hepatic events.   No subgroup has been identified with a particular risk that can be 
excluded from taking tolvaptan – although in general terms, factors like age, alcohol intake and poor 
nutrition  can  influence  the  risk  of  drug-induced  liver  injury.  Whilst  the  mechanism  is  currently 
unknown, the prolonged latency and relatively prompt recurrence upon re-challenge may support an 
immunological mechanism.  
Other notable adverse events 
There was an excess of events relating to raised intraocular pressure and glaucoma in the pivotal trial 
compared  to  the  placebo group.    No  mechanism  is  known,  but  overall  a  plausible  relationship  for 
raised  intra-ocular  pressure/glaucoma  cannot  be  excluded.    Glaucoma  will  be  investigated  in  the 
PASS. 
There was also a small increased incidence of malignant neoplasms in the pivotal trial in the tolvaptan 
group.    These  were  driven  by  basal  cell  carcinoma  (0.8%  vs.  0.2%).  This  is  not  predicted  from 
previous clinical trials, from preclinical and in vivo background work, or from a mechanistic point of 
view.    The  number  of  observed  events  is  small,  the  observation  may  be  a  chance  finding,  and 
causality is not clear at this time.  The applicant suggests there is a higher background incidences of 
such  lesions  in  ADPKD  patients,  however  there  is  still  an  imbalance  between  the  tolvaptan  and 
placebo group and an association with tolvaptan cannot be ruled out.  Basal cell carcinoma itself is a 
slow-growing condition, manageable with routine monitoring. There is no signal for an association 
with tolvaptan and other malignancies, however in the context of proposed long-term use, in a patient 
population with additional risk of renal malignancy this is a potential concern in the safety evaluation 
which  must  be  monitored.  The  baseline  prevalence  and  incidence  of  new  occurrences  of  skin 
neoplasm (basal cell carcinoma) will be further characterized in the proposed PASS (as described in 
the RMP). 
There are a number of other adverse events which given their frequency, seriousness and reversibility 
are  manageable.  These  include  changes  in  serum  sodium  and  uric  acid.  There  are  no  signals  of 
particular clinical concern regarding cardiovascular and thrombotic adverse events. An association 
between tolvaptan use and hyperglycaemia/new onset diabetes TEAEs has already been picked up in 
the Samsca licence, and cannot be excluded in the proposed ADPKD setting - this has been reflected 
in the Jinarc SmPC. No significant differences in biochemistry or haematology parameters were seen, 
other  than  those  already  discussed.      Whilst  any  hepatic  toxicity  of  tolvaptan  may  have  an 
immunological basis, other serious allergic reactions are not signalled.  
Special populations  
There are no adequate data on the use of tolvaptan in pregnancy or during breast-feeding; this is 
reflected in the SmPC. However, as Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity and excretion 
into  the  milk  tolvaptan  the  product  is  contraindicated  in  pregnant  of  breasfeeding  women.  The 
proposed  indication  is  also  restricted  to  adults.  Overall,  there  were  no  conclusive  and  clinically 
important differences in adverse events attributable to treatment with tolvaptan based on gender or 
race. 
Assessment Report 
EMA/154879/2015 
Page 98/124 
 
No assessment can be made on adverse events in the elderly, as the ADPKD clinical program focused 
on treating relatively young patients, with the pivotal trial excluding patients over 50.   However, 
long-term treatment with tolvaptan in ADPKD is anticipated and there are a number of adverse events 
for which the elderly are potentially more susceptible. It is reflected in 4.2 of the SmPC that safety and 
efficacy in ADPKD patients aged over 50 years has not been established and the PASS will monitor  the 
use in this patient population as described in the RMP. 
The  proposed  indication  is  a  condition  characterised  by  progressive  renal  impairment,  which  the 
product aims to slow. The ADPKD study program focused however on patients with relatively intact 
renal function so there are few ADPKD patients with more severe renal dysfunction taking tolvaptan 
long-term.  Tolvaptan causes a short-term and reversible reduction in GFR at the start of treatment.  
Furthermore,  TEAEs  of  increased  ALT  and  AST  were  more  common  in  tolvaptan  subjects  with  a 
baseline eCrCLCG < 80 mL/min compared to those with better renal function.  
Furthermore the SmPC states that the risk of hepatic damage in patients with severely reduced renal 
function (i.e. eGFR < 20) may be increased and that  these patients should be carefully monitored for 
hepatic toxicity.  The SPC also notes the more limited data in CKD stage 3 patients. 
The initial reduction in GFR is small and the patient numbers too limited to conclude an increased risk 
of hepatotoxicity. However taking also into account the lack of data or therapeutic rationale in ADPKD 
patients  with  already  advanced  renal  disease,  this  is  a  further  argument  which  led  to  narrow  the 
indication to CKD stage I to III patients at the initiation of the treatment. As the treatment is supposed 
to be long term patients will reach later stages of renal insufficiency and further data on the treatment 
of patients in more advanced stages will be generated within the ongoing clinical trials 156-09-290 
and 156-08-271 as defined in Annex II and described further in the RMP. 
It is not clear how many patients with hepatic impairment were in the pivotal study as the exclusion 
criteria were pragmatic, and hepatic status was not formally assessed at baseline. As the risk: benefit 
for  tolvaptan  in  ADPKD  patients  with  significant  hepatic  failure  is  questionable,  given  its  intrinsic 
potential  for  serious  hepatotoxicity  the  SmPC  contra-indicates  use  in  patients  with  elevated  liver 
enzymes  and/or  signs  or  symptoms  of  liver  injury  that  meet  the  requirements  for  permanent 
discontinuation of tolvaptan. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In general the safety profile of tolvaptan in the treatment of adult patients with ADPKD has been well 
described,  with  an  adequate  subject  exposure  for  an  application  of  this  nature.  The  majority  of 
adverse  events  associated  with  tolvaptan  were  expected  given  its  known  pharmacodynamic 
properties, are tolerable given the expected benefit and the seriousness of the proposed indication, 
and are clinically manageable for most patients in practice. However, discontinuations due to AEs are 
more frequent in the tolvaptan arm, and it is clear that for some patients adverse events related to 
aquaresis are intolerable and lead to discontinuation.  
The most serious risk is idiosyncratic hepatic toxicity, which so far appears specific to ADPKD patients. 
Generally it has been seen at 3 and 14 months, but this cannot be confirmed given the limited cases.  
The incidence is relatively low. The real incidence with more patients treated outside of the study 
setting could be higher, although the size of the ADPKD population is relatively limited. All cases to 
date have been reversible and not associated with hepatic failure.  
For marketing authorisation the risk can be considered manageable with the final SmPC statements 
including contraindication and stopping rules concerning patients with elevated liver enzymes and

At this point in time there is no identified subgroup with a particular risk that can be excluded from 
taking tolvaptan and data in a real live setting under strict monitoring will add further clarification. A 
Post  authorisation  safety  study  will  investigate  further  on  hepatotoxicity,  basal  cell  carcinoma 
glaucoma and other risks as defined in the RMP. As the exact frequency and severity of hepatotoxic 
events which might impact on the benefit risk of the product cannot be defined with certainty based 
on the current data this study is made condition to the marketing authorisation. Submission of the 
study protocol is requested within 2 months after Marketing Authorisation as defined in the RMP. 
As mentioned above the risk of liver injury can be considered acceptable for marketing of the product 
in view of the appropriate patient and prescriber education, strong monitoring requirements (more 
frequent than employed in the ADPKD studies) and other measures in the risk: management plan. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety:

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed 
post-authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the 
product and that the Jinarc post authorization safety study be a condition of the marketing 
authorization.. 
The PRAC also considered that the proposed study in the post-authorisation development plan is 
sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures and that a full protocol 
should be submitted including questionnaires and other methods for data collection.

.•Tolvaptan may cause undesirable effects related to water 
loss such as thirst, dry mouth and dehydration (see section 
4.8). Therefore, patients should have access to water (or other 
aqueous fluids) and be able to drink sufficient amounts of

This section also provides information on which patients 
might be at higher risk, details the potential neurologic 
consequences of a too rapid correction of hyponatremia, and 
provides practical guidance to avoid a too fast correction of 
the sodium concentration. In addition, this section warns for a 
higher risk in patients who received other treatment for 
hyponatremia or medicinal products which increase serum 
sodium concentration prior to initiation of treatment with 
tolvaptan.  
•Statement in section 4.5 of the SmPC that medicinal 
products with high sodium content such as effervescent 
analgesic preparations and certain sodium containing 
treatments for dyspepsia may also increase serum sodium 
concentration.  In addition, concomitant use of tolvaptan with 
other treatments for hyponatremia or other medicinal 
products that increase serum sodium concentration may result 
in a higher risk for developing rapid correction of serum 
sodium and is therefore not recommended.  
•Inclusion in section 4.8 of the SmPC that rapid correction of 
hyponatremia, sometimes leading to neurological symptoms, 
is an undesirable effect of tolvaptan 
Additional risk Minimization Action 
Samsca® 
After adoption of positive opinions on 15-Mar-2012 updated 
safety information concerning rapid correction of serum 
sodium and potential interaction with products increasing 
serum sodium was communicated by means of a direct 
healthcare professional communication (DHPC). 
For variations II/005 (Rapid Rise in Sodium) and 
II/007(Co-administration of tolvaptan with medicines with 
high sodium content or other treatments for hyponatremia is 
not recommended), the EMA requested communication of the 
new safety information by means of a DHPC. The DHPC 
letter was distributed in all EEA countries where Samsca is 
marketed or available by other means and where the national 
competent authorities agreed with the dissemination of the 
national DHPC, i.e. in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, 
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, 
Sweden and United Kingdom.

In section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use; the 
text states:  
Fluid and electrolyte status should be monitored in all 
patients. Administration of tolvaptan induces copious 
aquaresis and may cause dehydration and increases in serum 
sodium (see section 4.8) and is contraindicated in 
hypernatremia patients (see section 4.3). Therefore, serum 
creatinine, electrolytes and symptoms of electrolyte 
imbalances (e.g. dizziness, fainting, palpitations, confusion, 
weakness, gait instability, hyper-reflexia, seizures, coma) 
should be assessed prior to and after starting tolvaptan to 
monitor for dehydration.  
During long-term treatment electrolytes should be monitored 
at least every three months. 
Pre-treatment sodium abnormalities (hyponatremia or 
hypernatremia) must be corrected prior to initiation with 
tolvaptan therapy.

Dehydration 
Volume status should be monitored in patients taking 
tolvaptan because treatment with tolvaptan may result in 
severe dehydration which constitutes a risk factor for renal 
dysfunction. If dehydration becomes evident, take 
appropriate action which may include the need to interrupt or 
reduce the dose of tolvaptan and increase fluid intake. Special 
care should be taken in patients having diseases that impair 
appropriate fluid intake or who are at an increased risk of 
water loss e.g. in case of vomiting or diarrhoea.

2. Be alert for ALT >3 times the upper limit of normal. This 
would warrant weekly monitoring of ALT, AST and BT at a 
minimum. 
3. Monitoring for symptoms that may indicate liver injury 
(such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, right upper abdominal 
discomfort, vomiting, fever, rash, pruritus, icterus, dark urine 
or jaundice).  
4. Recommendations for tolvaptan therapy termination in

Anaphylaxis 
Samsca 
A variation procedure to include anaphylaxis in SmPC 
section 4.8 undesirable effects (anaphylactic shock and rash 
generalized) and a warning statement in SmPC section 4.4 
was finalised with a positive opinion on 23-Jan-2014.  
Section 4.4 
Anaphylaxis  
In post-marketing experience, anaphylaxis (including 
anaphylactic shock and generalised rash) has been reported 
very rarely following administration of Samsca. Patients 
should be carefully monitored during treatment. If an 
anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reactions 
occur, administration of Samsca should be discontinued 
immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.

Jinarc SmPC:   
In section 4.8 undesirable effects (anaphylactic shock and

4.4 :  
Anaphylaxis  
In post-marketing experience, anaphylaxis (including 
anaphylactic shock and rash generalised) has been reported 
very rarely following administration of tolvaptan. This type 
of reaction occurred after the first administration of tolvaptan. 
If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reactions 
occur, administration of tolvaptan must be discontinued 
immediately and appropriate therapy initiated. Since 
hypersensitivity is a contraindication (see section 4.3) 
treatment must never be restarted after an anaphylactic 
reaction or other serious allergic reactions.

Warning in SmPC Section 4.5  the following: 
Concomitant use of medicinal products that are moderate 
(e.g. amprenavir, aprepitant, atazanavir, ciprofloxacin, 
crizotinib, darunavir/ritonavir, diltiazem, erythromycin, 
fluconazole, fosamprenavir, imatinib, verapamil)  or strong 
(e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin) 
CYP 3A inhibitors  increase tolvaptan exposure. 
Co-administration of tolvaptan and ketoconazole resulted in a 
440% increase in area under time-concentration curve (AUC) 
and 248% increase in maximum observed plasma 
concentration (C max) for tolvaptan.  
Co-administration of tolvaptan with grapefruit juice, a 
moderate to strong CYP3A inhibitor, produced a doubling of 
peak tolvaptan concentrations (Cmax). 
Dose reduction of tolvaptan is recommended for patients 
while taking moderate or strong CYP 3A inhibitors (see 
section 4.2).

•Tolvaptan plasma concentrations have been decreased by up 
to 87% (AUC) after the administration of CYP3A4 inducers. 
Caution should be exercised in co-administering CYP3A4 
inducers (e.g. rifampicin, barbiturates) with tolvaptan. 
•CYP3A4 substrates 
In healthy subjects, tolvaptan, a CYP3A4 substrate, had no 
effect on the plasma concentrations of some other CYP3A4 
substrates (e.g. warfarin or amiodarone). Tolvaptan increased 
plasma levels of lovastatin by 1.3 to 1.5-fold. Even though 
this increase has no clinical relevance, it indicates tolvaptan 
can potentially increase exposure to CYP3A4 substrates.

a synergistic or additive effect of concomitant use of 
tolvaptan with loop and thiazide diuretics, each class of agent 
has the potential to lead to severe dehydration, which 
constitutes a risk factor for renal dysfunction. If dehydration 
or renal dysfunction becomes evident, appropriate action 
must be taken which may include the need to interrupt or 
reduce doses of tolvaptan and/or diuretics and increased fluid 
intake. Other potential causes of renal dysfunction or

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The  primary  endpoint  in  the  single  pivotal  study  was  the  rate  of  change  in  TKV  for  subjects 
randomised to tolvaptan (normalized as percentage) to the rate of change for subjects randomized to 
placebo.  Total kidney volume increased by 18.8% in placebo subjects over 3 years but by only half 
that (9.6%) in tolvaptan subjects.  The rate of growth was 2.80% per year (tolvaptan) vs. 5.51% per 
year  (placebo)  (ratio  of  geometric  mean  0.974;  95%  confidence  interval  [CI]  0.969  to  0.980; 
p < 0.0001),  for  a  difference  of  −2.71%  per  year  with  a  49.2%  reduction  in  growth  rate  in  the 
tolvaptan group compared with the placebo group.  The effect of treatment with tolvaptan on TKV was 
greatest in the first year but effects treatment persisted into the second and third year of therapy, 
with  a  year-to-year  accrual  of  effect  over  time,  leading  to  continued  incremental  separation  from 
placebo over the entire 3 years.  The incremental treatment effect for reduction in TKV from the first 
year to the second year was −1.92% (p < 0.0001) and from the second year to the third year was 
−1.78% (p = 0.0005).  These results were replicated in sensitivity analyses, including re-analyses to

account for differing model assumptions and datasets, potential MRI quality or reading errors, and 
analyses by study centre and country.  
The finding of slowed TKV progression is supported by in vivo data and preclinical disease models.  
The submitted literature also suggests that a reduction in the rate of renal enlargement may correlate 
with benefit in clinical outcomes. Data from 2 open-label studies was matched to historical data in a 
case-control study. The progression of ADPKD, as evidenced by both increasing total kidney volume 
and declining estimated glomerular filtration rate, was significantly slowed after 3 years of tolvaptan 
treatment  compared  with  historical  control  data,  and  there  was  a  significant  negative  correlation 
between annualized slope of TKV and slope of eGFR. 
In  the  secondary  composite  endpoint,  there  was  a  statistically  significant  13.5  %  rate  reduction 
compared to placebo. This was driven by changes in 2 out of the 4 components of the composite 
variable. These were the events of renal function decline (based on a 25% decrease in the reciprocal 
of  serum  creatinine,  an  increase  in  serum  creatinine  of  33%)  and  renal  pain  (severe  renal  pain 
requiring medical intervention)  
The hazard ratio relating to renal function decline was 0.386 (95% CI 0.263 to 0.566) and for renal 
pain the HR was 0.642 (95% CI 0.466 to 0.887). These correspond to a relative improvement of 61.4% 
and  35.8%  respectively.  The  numbers  of  worsening  renal  function  events  are  low,  but  perhaps 
consistent with the relatively intact renal function, the relatively slow rate of renal function decline, 
and the length of the study.  Events that signaled a decline in renal function were delayed in both 
groups  until  around  a  year,  with  the  separation  of  tolvaptan  treatment  from  placebo  treatment 
evident at approximately Month 18.  The effect of tolvaptan on renal pain was observed earlier in the 
treatment period.   
In the 3rd endpoint, tolvaptan treatment slowed the rate of renal function decline (reciprocal of serum 
creatinine) by one-third compared to placebo, for which the predefined statistical criteria were met. 
This was confirmed by other estimation methods and demonstrated a significant association with the 
rate of change in TKV. The mean rate of change per year in estimated GFR CKD-EPI was around -2.7 
mL/min/1.73 m2 for the tolvaptan group and -3.6 for the placebo group.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Whilst the key secondary composite endpoint showed an overall rate reduction compared to placebo, 
this  was  driven  by  changes  in  2  out  of  the  4  components  of  the  composite  variable.  For  the  2 
components that did show a change (renal function decline, severe renal pain), the numbers of events 
were small. Whilst the short duration of the trial might have hampered to show clearer and direct 
effects on clinical parameters the effect on renal pain could not been convincingly shown and the claim 
to slow the progression of “kidney disease” was considered too broad at this time in relation to the 
patients studied and the specific benefits seen and is reflected in the amended indication. 
As discussed in more detail in the efficacy part of this assessment TKV is an acceptable surrogate 
parameter and suits as a primary endpoint in this setting. Measures of renal volume, as shown in 
literature  as  well  as  in  the  pivotal  trial,  are  clearly  linked  to  the  characteristic  progressive 
development of renal cysts in ADPKD, and correlate with renal function. Whereas the indication has 
been  adapted  to  reflect  the  patient  population  who  is  benefiting  best  further  assurance  on  the 
correlation between renal volume and other clinical endpoints is to be provided post authorisation, 
although a correlation was clinically plausible a priori. Furthermore, considering the short duration of 
the  pivotal  trial  and  the  long  course  of  the  disease  further  assurance  needs  to  be  provided  if  the 
promising short term effects will be maintained in the long term. 
This will be done with two post authorisation efficacy studies, the one being the long-term extension 
of  the  pivotal  trial,  the  other  designed  to  provide  data  on  clinical  endpoints  in  later  stages  of  the 
disease. The aim will be to show that tolvaptan continues to slow the rate of renal function decline and 
Assessment Report 
EMA/154879/2015

delay the onset of end-stage renal disease, particularly as the so far studied population had relatively 
preserved renal function at baseline. 
Furthermore  provision  of  the  results  of  these  on-going  efficacy  studies  is  made  condition  to  the 
marketing authorisation in Annex II. Furthermore on-going studies are expected to provide further 
clarity  of  APKD  related  morbidity  and  mortality,  including  longer-term  effects  on  GFR  decline  and 
progression of disease leading to dialysis or transplantation. Long term use in clinical practice will also 
be investigated in the PASS as described in the RMP and outlined in Annex II. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The commonest adverse events associated with tolvaptan were as expected from its aquaretic effect. 
These  included  thirst,  polyuria,  nocturia,  pollakiuria,  and  dry  mouth.  In  the  pivotal  trial, 
aquaresis-related  adverse  events  led  to  the  discontinuation  of  tolvaptan  in  approximately  8%  of 
participants, mostly within the first month. Fluid intake must be adjusted to balance increased urine 
output, particularly important in subjects with impaired renal function. These adverse events can be 
clinically managed and monitored in the majority of patients.  
The most serious risk is idiosyncratic hepatic toxicity, which so far appears specific to ADPKD patients. 
The incidence is relatively low. All cases to date have been reversible and not associated with hepatic 
failure.  For  marketing  authorisation  the  risk  can  be  considered  manageable  with  the  final  SmPC 
statements  including  contraindication  and  stopping  rules  concerning  patients  with  elevated  liver 
enzymes and signs or symptoms of liver injury. 
Furthermore the risk of liver injury can be considered acceptable for marketing of the product in view 
of the appropriate patient and prescriber education, strong monitoring requirements (more frequent 
than employed in the ADPKD studies) and other measures in the risk: management plan. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Hepatotoxicity 
The adverse event of most concern, which is specific to the ADPKD program, is hepatic toxicity. The 
incidence  is  relatively  low  and  thus  far,  all  hepatic  adverse  events  have  been  reversible  and  not 
associated with hepatic failure.  
A total of 1275 patients had received tolvaptan through the estimated “window of susceptibility” of 18 
months. After adjudication, 3 tolvaptan subjects in the ADPKD program met the criteria for potentially 
serious liver injury so there is a total incidence of about 1:400 patients treated for at least 18 months.  
Assuming 10% of these cases will progress to acute liver failure the estimate of incidence of acute 
liver failure in ADPKD patients chronically receiving treated with tolvaptan would therefore be about 1 
in 4,000. Whilst all cases to date have been reversible and not associated with hepatic failure, the 
number of subjects exposed is too low to exclude that tolvaptan has the potential to cause liver injury 
capable of progression to liver failure.  
As already mentioned the risk can be considered balanced for marketing of this product in view of the 
appropriate patient and prescriber education, strong monitoring requirements and contraindication in 
patients with elevated liver enzymes as described in the SmPC 
However, considering that patients will be treated for periods longer than assessed within the clinical 
trials and in later stages of this progressive disease further investigation on ADRs associated with long 
term use of the product is considered key to the benefit risk and data thereto will be provided in 
particular from the PASS as described in the RMP and Annex II. 
Assessment Report 
EMA/154879/2015

Special populations 
Tolvaptan  causes  a  short-term  and  reversible  reduction  in  GFR  at  the  start  of  treatment.    Data 
suggest that the absolute decrease is lower in patients with more severe renal impairment, but the 
numbers of such patients are limited and even if the decline is small, in patients with more severe 
renal impairment it may become more significant.  
Furthermore,  TEAEs  of  increased  ALT  and  AST  were  more  common  in  tolvaptan  subjects  with  a 
baseline eCrCLCG < 80 mL/min compared to those with better renal function. The initial reduction in 
GFR  is  small  and  the  patient  numbers  too  limited to  conclude  an  increased  risk  of  hepatotoxicity. 
However taking also into account the lack of efficacy data or therapeutic rationale in ADPKD patients 
with more advanced renal disease the indication statement was amended to CKD stage I to III at the 
initiation of treatment and tolvaptan should be discontinued if renal insufficiency progresses to CKD 
stage 5 as described in the SmPC.  
As the risk: benefit for tolvaptan in ADPKD patients with significant hepatic failure is questionable, 
given above mentioned intrinsic potential for serious hepatotoxicity the SmPC also contra-indicates 
use in patients with elevated liver enzymes and/or signs or symptoms of liver injury that meet the 
requirements for permanent discontinuation of tolvaptan. 
Further confirmative data  on later stages of renal insufficiency will be provided post authorisation 
from the ongoing PEAS and, under the monitored use of the product, safety data in the real life setting 
will be generated within the planned PASS both studies being Annex II conditions. 
No assessment can be made on adverse events in the elderly, as the ADPKD clinical program focused 
on  treating  relatively  young  patients,  with  the  pivotal  trial  excluding  patients  over  50  and  this  is 
appropriately reflected in the SmpC. However, as long-term treatment with tolvaptan in ADPKD is 
anticipated  and  there  are  a  number  of  adverse  events  for  which  the  elderly  are  potentially  more 
susceptible further data on this potential risk will also be provided within the post authorisation safety 
study. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
As there is no other specific treatment in ADKPD a clear unmet medical need for the treatment of 
ADPKD  exists  which  is  taken  into  account.  Current  drug  therapy  is  focused  on  the  treatment  of 
symptoms and complications. ADPKD is a serious condition, with around half  of patients requiring 
renal replacement therapy by 60 years of age. The effects of tolvaptan compared to placebo on the 
rate  of  kidney  volume  increase  are  considered  to  reflect  a  clinically  meaningful  slowing  of  cystic 
kidney disease progression, which correlated in the pivotal study and in previous literature with a 
significant effect on the rate of decline in renal function. These results are most clear in patients with 
CKD stage 1 to 3 at initiation of treatment and evidence of rapidly progressing disease.  
Whilst long-term data on harder clinical endpoints are to be provided post authorisation to verify that 
tolvaptan continues to slow the rate of renal function decline and delay the onset of end-stage renal 
disease, the provided evidence on the favourable effects is considered satisfactory for approval. Long 
term  use  in  clinical  practice,  use  in  patients  over  50  years,  Glaucoma  and  other  risks  will  be 
investigated in the PASS made condition to the marketing authorisation.  
The commonest adverse events relate to aquaresis.  They may be unpleasant and inconvenient but 
their risks are manageable with appropriate advice in the product information. Nevertheless for some 
patients the frequent need to urinate and replace with fluids is intolerably disruptive, particularly as 
long-term therapy is anticipated. 
Hepatotoxicity is the most important aspect in the safety evaluation, and as discussed above there are 
gaps in the understanding of this. The incidence is low. The real incidence with more patients treated 
Assessment Report 
EMA/154879/2015 
Page 120/124 
 
outside of the study setting could be higher, although the size of the ADPKD population is relatively 
limited. Importantly, all cases to date have been reversible and not associated with hepatic failure.  
However, the number of subjects exposed is too low to confirm this, and tolvaptan has the potential 
to cause liver injury capable of progression to liver failure. 
As discussed above, taking the number of exposed patients, the number of potentially serious hepatic 
AEs, and past experience with drug induced liver injury, we might assume the incidence of acute liver 
failure in ADPKD patients chronically receiving treated with tolvaptan to be 1 in 4,000.  With further 
data this could turn out to be higher, lower, or negligible, but the potential for serious hepatotoxicity 
clearly should be weighed against the benefits and therefore justifies the inclusion of the PASS in 
Annex II of the marketing authorisation. The risk is mitigated by restricting the indication to a patient 
population for whom a compelling clinical benefit has been shown and clear stopping and permanent 
discontinuation  rules  are included  in  the  SmPC  based  on  test  results  and  signs/symptoms  of  liver 
disease. The risk of liver injury can be considered acceptable for marketing authorisation with the 
strong monitoring requirements (more frequent than employed in the ADPKD studies) as outlined in 
SmPC and RMP.  
Agreed risk minimisation measures include a prescriber educational programme. Education materials 
for  prescribers  and  patients  and  a  patient  alert  card  are  required,  and  a  prospective  long-term 
follow-up cohort study and retrospective database study , both described in the RMP and the former 
being  condition  of  the  MA  will  be  carried  out  primarily  to  evaluate  the  hepatic  safety  of  Jinarc. 
Furthermore 3 monthly reports summarising severe hepatic adverse events, as well as 6 monthly 
reports on hepatic events from an expert advisory panel to assure early detection of signals will be 
submitted. 
The  prescription  of  tolvaptan  in  ADPKD  is  to  be  initiated  and  monitored  under  the  supervision  of 
physicians  with  special  expertise  in  managing  ADPKD,  and  a  full  understanding  of  the  risks  of 
tolvaptan therapy including hepatic toxicity and monitoring requirements. The prognostic factors in 
ADPKD are complex, and an individual discussion between the specialist prescriber and the patient 
would always be required.  The relatively small number of patients with ADPKD likely to be treated 
with tolvaptan and the specialist setting further increase the feasibility of adequately inclusive and 
meaningful post-marketing safety studies.  
Benefit-risk balance 
ADPKD is a potentially life-threatening condition, and there are currently no approved therapies to 
slow its inexorable progression. Whilst there are currently no compelling data to show a benefit in the 
other  clinical  manifestations  of  ADPKD,  there  is  a  clinically  meaningful  effect  of  tolvaptan  on  the 
progression  of  total  kidney  volume  (reflecting  cyst  development)  and  on  the  progression  of  renal 
function  in  patients  with  CKD  stage  1  to  3  at  initiation  of  treatment  and  evidence  of  rapidly 
progressing disease. 
The slow evolution of ADPKD would require an impracticably long study to show further and sustained 
benefit on  clinical outcome  parameters  of  the disease  and  in  patients  progressing  to later  stages. 
Given the rarity of ADPKD, the seriousness of the disease and the lack of other therapies the benefit 
risk  balance  in  the  agreed  amended  indication  together  with  the  risk  minimisation  measures  as 
described above can be considered positive. 
Nevertheless a concern on a potential lack of clinical efficacy in the long term and in later stages of 
ADPKD persists and requires confirmation. Lack of verification would lead to a re-evaluation of the 
benefit risk of the product and therefore two post authorisation efficacy studies are made condition to 
the  marketing  authorisation.  The  one,  as  an  open  label  extension  of  the  pivotal  trial,  will  provide 
longer term data on the progression of ADKPD, including patients continuing on tolvaptan after the 
pivotal trial and making comparison of progression to the expected untreated progression rate the 
other will contribute data on later stages of the disease.

The main safety issue is the significant rise in liver function tests in a small number of patients.  To 
date  these  have  been  reversible  and  not  associated  with  severe  clinical  outcomes.    However  the 
pattern  suggests  idiosyncratic  toxicity,  and  more  serious  hepatotoxicity  cannot  be  ruled  out.  The 
range of measures described above would be expected to significantly mitigate the risk but to further 
define the safety profile in a real life setting, in particular the hepatotoxicity is considered key to the 
benefit risk and a post authorisation safety study was made condition to the marketing authorisation 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The  CHMP  considers  that  the  net  clinical  benefit  outweighs  the  risk  in  the  granted  therapeutic 
indication. Provisions in the SmPC and the requirements of the risk management plan and Annex II 
are suitable to mitigate the identified and potential risks in particular the risk of hepatotoxicity.  
Furthermore, as the clinical efficacy assessment is largely based on a surrogate parameter and due to 
the  slow  evolution  of  this  rare  disease  requiring  an  impracticably  long  study  to  show  further  and 
sustained benefit on clinical outcome parameters of the disease and in patients progressing to later 
stages post authorisation efficacy follow up was made condition to the Marketing authorisation. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Jinarc indicated to slow the progression of cyst development and renal 
insufficiency of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in adults with CKD stage 1 to 
3 at initiation of treatment with evidence of rapidly progressing disease is favourable and therefore 
recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2).

information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the 
result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
If the dates for submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted at the 
same time. 
• 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of Jinarc in each Member State the Marketing Authorisation Holder must agree the 
content and format of the educational programme, including communication media and distribution 
modalities with each National Competent Authority. The MAH must ensure that all healthcare 
professionals and patients/carers who are expected to prescribe and/or use JINARC have access 
to/are provided with the following educational package 
• 
• 
Physician educational material  
Patient information pack 
The educational programme is aimed at ensuring awareness about the potential risk of hepatotoxicity 
and providing guidance on how to manage this risk and the importance of pregnancy prevention prior 
to the initiation and during the treatment with Jinarc. 
The physician educational material should contain:  
• 
• 
The Summary of product Characteristics 
Healthcare professionals training material  
The healthcare professional training material shall contain the following key elements 
• 
• 
the risk of hepatotoxicity associated with the use of Jinarc 
the importance of pregnancy prevention, before and during treatment with Jinarc 
The patient information pack should contain: 
• 
• 
• 
The Patient information leaflet 
Patient/Carer educational material 
A Patient Alert Card

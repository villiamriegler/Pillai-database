Summary  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan  for Kymriah 
(tisagenlecleucel)
This  is  a  summary  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan  (RMP)  for  Kymriah. The  RMP 
details  important  risks  of  Kymriah, how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how 
more information will be obtained about Kymriah's risks and uncertainties (missing 
information).
Kymriah's  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SmPC)  and  the  SmPC  Package 
leaflet give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how 
Kymriah should be used.
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Kymriah should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this 
information

Report (EPAR).
including  the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates 
to the Kymriah RMP.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Kymriah is a CD19-directed autologous immunotherapy indicated for the treatment 
of:
 Paediatric and young adult patients up to and including 25 years of age with 
B-cell  acute  lymphoblastic  leukaemia  (B-ALL)  that is  refractory,  in  relapse 
post-transplant or in second or later relapse.
 Adult  patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma 
(DLBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy.
 Adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after two or 
more lines of systemic therapy.
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Kymriah’s benefits  can  be  found  in 
Kymriah’s EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA

II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise 
or further characterize the risks
Important  risks  of  Kymriah,  together  with  measures  to  minimise  such  risks  and 
the proposed studies for learning more about Kymriah's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, 
in the SmPC and SmPC Package leaflet addressed to healthcare professionals 
and patients
 The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., 
with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In the  case  of  Kymriah,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk 
minimisation measures mentioned under relevant important risks below.
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected 
continuously  and  regularly  analysed  including  Periodic  Safety  Update  Report 
(PSUR) assessment - so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These 
measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.
If  important  information  that  may  affect  the  safe  use  of  Kymriah is  not  yet 
available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A: List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Kymriah are risks that need special risk management activities 
to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be 
safely  administered.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential. 
Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the 
use of Kymriah. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use 
of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not 
been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal  product that  is currently missing and 
needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B: Summary of important risks
Table 2
Important identified risk: Cytokine release syndrome
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a direct mechanism based 
toxicity that occurs as a result of high-level immune activation. 
It is a systemic inflammatory response caused when cytokines 
are released by activated T-cells, which has been observed in 
other  types  of  T-cell  directed  therapies.  This  syndrome  has 
become increasingly important with the use of new and more 
potent immunotherapies. The level of immune activation with 
these  newer  therapies  occurs  at  levels  greater  than  that 
occurring in nature. The  severity ranges from  mild to severe 
with a fatal outcome sometimes.
Life-threatening  and  fatal  events  have  been  observed  in 
tisagenlecleucel clinical trials. 
In the Novartis tisagenlecleucel clinical study programs for the 
indications  of  pediatric  and  young  adult  r/r  B-ALL,  adult  r/r 
DLBCL,  and  adult  r/r  FL,  CRS  was  graded  using  criteria 
predefined in the study protocols (Penn CRS grading scale for 
Study  B2202,  Study B2205J,  Study B2001X, and  Study 
C2201; Lee grading criteria for Study E2202).
In the majority of patients, CRS after tisagenlecleucel infusion 
occurred  with  a  median  time  to  onset  of  3  days  in both
pediatric and  young  adult  r/r  B-ALL  and  adult  r/r  DLBCL
patients, and 4 days in adult r/r FL.
Symptoms  of  CRS  may  include  high  fever,  hypotension, 
hypoxia,  dyspnea,  tachypnea,  rigors,  myalgia,  arthralgia, 
nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  diaphoresis,  rash,  anorexia, 
fatigue, tachycardia, and headache. In addition, multiple organ 
renal 
dysfunction, 
impairment,  and  liver  injury  with  elevated  hepatic  enzymes 
have been observed. Disseminated intravascular coagulation, 
with low fibrinogen levels, or capillary leak syndrome may also 
occur.
In  the  setting  of  severe  CRS  following  CAR  T-cell  therapies 
including  tisagenlecleucel,  patients  may  develop  a  clinical 
phenotype that shares signs and symptoms of hemophagocytic 
(HLH)  and  macrophage  activation 
lymphohistiocytosis 
syndrome  (MAS),  as  further  evidenced  by  similar  laboratory 
findings.  There  is  a  significant  overlap  across  CRS,  MAS  and 
HLH,  reflecting  a  group  of  severe  systemic  immunological 
disorders  characterized  by  hyperactivation  of  macrophages 
and  lymphocytes,  pro-inflammatory  cytokine  production, 
lymphohistiocytic  tissue  infiltration,  and  immune-mediated 
multiorgan  failure.  In  the  majority  of  patients,  MAS/HLH 
responds to CRS resolution. Given this overlap, MAS/HLH may 
be  considered  to  reflect  manifestations  of  CRS  of  higher 
severity. However, it should be distinguished from late-onset, 
tocilizumab-refractory  HLH/MAS-like 
that  may 
represent a distinct and separate pathology than conventional 
CRS and requires a different treatment approach.

Table 3
Important identified risk: Serious neurological adverse 
reactions
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
Neurotoxic events, suggested to be named ‘CAR-T-cell-related 
encephalopathy syndrome’ and subsequently termed ‘immune 
effector  cell-associated  neurotoxicity  syndrome’  (ICANS),  is 
the  second  most-common  adverse  reaction  associated  with 
CAR  T-cell therapies.  Neurotoxicity  typically  manifests  as  a 
toxic  encephalopathy  with  wide  range  of  variable  symptoms 
such  as  confusion,  delirium,  tremors,  aphasia,  speech 
disorders,  motor  findings,  and  seizures.  For  fatal  cerebral 
edema that occurred with other CAR T-cell products differently 
constructed than tisagenlecleucel, see Table 8.
Notably,  the  onset  of  neurological  events  can  be  concurrent 
with  CRS,  typically  during  high  fever  and  at  the  time  of 
maximal  grade  of  CRS,  following  resolution  of  CRS  or  in  the 
absence of CRS. Severe ICANS symptoms are more frequently 
observed in cases when CRS develops early, which may be due 
to  a  high  dose  of  CAR  T  cells,  or  unusually  robust  and  rapid 
CAR  T  cell  proliferation.  Encephalopathy  typically  occurred 
after peak CRS symptoms and tended to be self-limiting with 
some  exceptions.  Neurological  events  with  seizures  or 
episodes of confusion 3-4 weeks following CAR T-cell therapy 
have  been  reported  to  occur.  The  majority  of  neurological 
events following tisagenlecleucel infusion were observed within 
8 weeks; there is currently limited evidence that CAR therapies 
are  associated  with  a  late  onset  of  neurological  events  (i.e., 
onset > 8 weeks after infusion).
Most  neurological  events  observed  within  8  weeks  were

encephalopathy,  confusional  state

have a life-threatening outcome.
The  causality  assessment  of  neurological  events  in  patients 
treated  with  tisagenlecleucel  can  be  confounded,  as  central

measures
Tumour  lysis  syndrome  was  clinically  observed  in  a  timely 
relation  to  tisagenlecleucel  T-cell  expansion.  In  the  clinical 
experience  with  tisagenlecleucel  thus  far,  most  cases  of 
tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) had a grade 3 in CTCAE severity, 
however, the risk has been moderate to low with appropriate 
monitoring  after  lymphodepleting  chemotherapy,  prophylaxis 
and treatment as needed.
All recipients are at risk for this concern.
In  general,  TLS  occurs  more  frequently  in  hematological 
malignancies  than  in  solid  tumors.  The  highest  risk  of 
developing TLS is observed in patients with lymphoproliferative 
disorders with high proliferative rate and high tumor sensitivity 
to chemotherapy, like B-ALL and Burkitt’s lymphoma. Tumour 
burden,  reflected  by  serum  LDH  level,  initial  WBC  count, 
tumour  size,  and  extensive  bone  marrow  involvement  are 
considered main predictors for the development of TLS in these 
patients.

Hematological  disorders  including  cytopenias  are  commonly

continue  to  exhibit  cytopenias  for  several  weeks  following 
tisagenlecleucel  infusion.  Prolonged  neutropenia  has  been 
associated with increased risk of infection.
All patients are at risk after tisagenlecleucel infusion. Extensive 
prior exposure to anti-cancer therapy, such as chemotherapy 
or  radiation  in  addition  to  lymphodepleting  chemotherapy  in 
proximity to tisagenlecleucel infusion, enhance the risk.

Important potential risk: Cerebral edema
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
No  fatal  cerebral  edemas  have  been  reported  following
tisagenlecleucel  infusion  in  the  clinical  development  program 
or the post-marketing setting to date that would resemble five 
fatal cases reported for JCAR015 (Juno). Importantly, the risk 
of fatal cerebral edema appears to be dependent of the anti-
CD19  CAR  construct  used  to  engineer  CAR  T-cell  therapies; 
JCAR015  presents  a  different  construct  of  an  anti-CD19  CAR 
than the CAR construct of tisagenlecleucel.
These  five  fatal  cases  of  cerebral  edema  occurred  in  the 
ROCKET  study  and  were  characterized  by  a  rapid  evolution 
soon after JCAR015 infusion, appeared to be resistant to anti-
cytokine  treatment,  and  ensued  brain  death  within  1-2  days 
after diagnosis. Following a retrospective exploratory analysis, 
it  is  believed  that  the  fatal  cerebral  edemas in  these  five 
patients emerged from rapid T-cell expansion associated with 
the specific CAR T-cell product construct that determines the 
kinetics of T-cell expansion after infusion together with other 
risk factors such as high baseline blood levels of interleukin 15 
(JCAR015).  Key  findings  of  this  retrospective  analysis  of  the 
JCAR015 cases with fatal cerebral edema showed that all five 
patients experienced rapid, early expansion of their CAR T cells 
within  a  week  of  being  infused  (rather  than  the  typical  time 
frame  of  12-14  days),  high levels  of  the  CD8+  subtype  and, 
consequently, a sharp spike in cytokines such as interleukin 2 
and TNFα. Autopsy results from two of the patients showed a 
breakdown  of  the  blood-brain  barrier  and  microvascular 
disruption, possibly  due  to  inflammatory  cytokine  surge. 
Potential risk factors at baseline included age younger than 30 
years, Philadelphia chromosome negativity, subset of disease 
(i.e., B-ALL), fewer prior regimens, higher levels of interleukin 
15 and decreased levels of platelets. 
Since  the  five  fatal  cases  after  exposure  to  the  JCAR015 
product  have  become  known,  another  patient  with  fatal 
cerebral  edema  was  reported  in  the  ZUMA-1  trial  following 
axicabtagene ciloleucel treatment. This patient progressed to 
CRS grade 4 refractory to tocilizumab and dexamethasone on 
Day 4, developed cerebral edema refractory to siltuximab and 
mannitol on Day 9, and died on Day 11. The clinical course of 
this  case  treated  with  KTE-019  may  not  be  comparable  with 
those 5 cases treated with JCAR015, which is further supported 
by a retrospective analysis of baseline cytokine and chemokine 
levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid suggesting significant 
pre-existing  underlying  inflammatory  condition  providing  an 
alternate  explanation. Another  fatal  cerebral  edema  case 
following axicabtagene ciloleucel was reported in the standard 
of care setting.
Risk factors and risk groups are unknown.

Important potential risk: Generation of replication 
competent lentivirus
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
Tisagenlecleucel  uses 
third  generation  self-inactivating 
lentiviral  vector.  Generation  of a  replication-competent 
lentivirus  (RCL)  following  infusion  of  the  vector  product 
remains  a 
theoretical  possibility.  Replication-competent 
lentivirus  will  be  detected  by  qPCR  for  vesicular  stomatitis 
virus-G (VSV-G) of peripheral blood.
Replication-competent lentivirus has not been described in the 
scientific literature for lentiviral vectors that use a production 
method  similar  to  the  tisagenlecleucel  vectors.  Furthermore, 
lentiviral  vectors  have  been  successfully  used  in  conjunction 
with  HIV  infected  patients,  with  no  evidence  of  vector 
mobilisation after 60 days or insertional mutagenesis observed 
up to 36 months.
To  date,  no  indication  of  RCL  tisagenlecleucel  batches  was 
detected by using VSV-G DNA (specification ≤ 50 copies/µg) 
assay  as  a  substitute.  Furthermore,  patients  enrolled  in 
interventional  clinical  trials  have  been  screened  for  RCL  with 
no RCL identified to date.

Important potential risk: Secondary malignancies 
(including vector insertion site oligo/monoclonality)
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
To  date,  no  cases  of  secondary  malignancy  have  been 
assessed to be causally related to tisagenlecleucel by Novartis. 
No  suspected  secondary  malignancies  following  CAR  T-cell 
therapies developed by other pharmaceutical companies have 
been reported in literature.
Based on historic experience in patients with X-linked severe 
combined immunodeficiency,  chronic granulomatous disease, 
and  Wiskott-Aldrich  syndrome,  vector-mediated  insertional 
mutagenesis  and  subsequent  malignant  cell  transformation 
have been observed following gene correction via autologous 
human  stem  cell  based  gene  therapy,  where  first-generation 
gamma-retroviral vectors harboring long terminal repeats with 
strong enhancer/promoter sequences has been used.
The potential risk of insertional oncogenesis was addressed in 
two  LISA  studies  where  12  batches  of  manufactured 
tisagenlecleucel  product  ready  for  administration  in  patients 
(6 patients  each  from  study  B2202  and  C2201)  and  two 
batches  of  product  manufactured  from  healthy  donor  cells 
were  analyzed.  The  results  indicate  that  there  was  no 
preferential integration near genes of concern, no preferential 
sites of integration (hot spots), and no preferential outgrowth 
of cells harboring integration sites of concern.
Tisagenlecleucel is based on autologous, fully differentiated T 
cells and therefore the carcinogenicity risk is considered to be 
low  in  comparison  to  genetic  modification  or  repair  such  as 
human  stem  cells.  As  discussed  in  a  review  of  CAR  T-cell 
therapies,  no  cases  of  malignant  transformation  have  been 
reported for genetic modification of T cells to date and there is 
currently  no  evidence  for  vector-induced  immortalisation, 
clonal  expansion,  or  enrichment  for  integration  sites  near 
genes  implicated  in  growth  control  or  transformation.  This is 
supported by the results of the LISA studies performed during 
the development of tisagenlecleucel.
Theoretically,  CAR-positive  viable  T  cells  could  proliferate 
without  control  of  normal  homeostatic  mechanisms.  In  pre-
clinical  studies  and  clinical  experience  to  date,  CAR-positive 
viable T cells have only proliferated in response to physiologic 
signals or upon exposure to CD19 antigen.  In  the context  of 
tisagenlecleucel  therapy,  it  is  expected  that  the  T  cells  will 
proliferate  in  response  to  signals  from  the  CD19  expressing 
malignant  tumor  and  normal  B  cells.  This  could  be  either 
harmful depending on the extent of proliferation or beneficial, 
since  clonal  dominance  of  adoptively  transferred  T  cells  has 
been  associated  with  tumor  reduction  in  adoptive  transfer 
trials.
Since  this  is  a  potential  risk,  no  attributable  increase  to 
tisagenlecleucel has been established. Therefore, by definition, 
no risk groups or risk factors can be identified.

immune cells. Reciprocal roles of T-cell help for B-cells during 
adaptive  immune  responses  and  B-cell  help  in  CD4+ T-cell 
activation are being increasingly recognized.
An  emerging  number  and  variety  of  autoimmune  diseases 
following after anti-cancer treatment including immunotherapy 
are  reported,  ranging  from  asymptomatic  immunological 
alterations to life-threatening systemic autoimmune diseases. 
However,  specific  etiopathogenic  mechanisms  that  could 
clearly  link  the  induced  autoimmune  disorder  with  the 
immunological pathways altered by the anti-cancer treatments 
are not well understood. Persistent immune abnormalities after 
treatment with chemotherapy, development of auto-antibodies 
and neoantigens are proposed to be crucial in the pathogenesis 
of autoimmune diseases post anti-cancer treatment.
Based on current knowledge, the risk of autoimmune reaction 
is  considered  low  with  tisagenlecleucel,  since  CD19  is  not 
present  on  most  normal  tissue  other  than  B cells.  The 
occurrence or exacerbation of an autoimmune disorder has not 
been observed with tisagenlecleucel to date. Prior anti-cancer 
chemotherapy, 
radiation 
therapy, 
lymphodepleting  chemotherapy  prior  to  treatment  with 
tisagenlecleucel  or  concomitant  treatment  may  present 
additional risk factors.

Since  this  is  a  potential  risk,  no  attributable  increase  to

no risk groups or risk factors can be identified.

The chance of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) occurring in 
patients  after  tisagenlecleucel  infusion  per  se  is  considered 
low, but there is a potential risk of aggravation of pre-existing 
GVHD in patients with donor chimerism from a prior allogeneic 
HSCT  post-tisagenlecleucel  due  to  the  milieu  provided  by 
robust activation of the transduced viable T-cells.
A  study  of  activated  donor  lymphocyte  infusions  (ex  vivo 
activated cells collected from the donor and grown in the same 
fashion as tisagenlecleucel but without the CAR introduction) 
did not show high rates of GVHD (2/18 patients with grade 3 
GVHD and none with grade 4). Of 18 ALL patients treated with 
autologous  tisagenlecleucel  therapy  who  had  relapsed  after 
prior  allogeneic  HSCT  with  residual  mixed  chimerism,  none 
have  developed  GVHD  after  autologous  tisagenlecleucel 
infusion.
Patients with the presence of active GVHD from prior HSCT.

including  the  tisagenlecleucel  viral  vector  required  to 
manufacture  tisagenlecleucel, through  contamination  during 
the  manufacturing  process  or  inadequate  storage.  The  risk 
associated  with  tisagenlecleucel  is  considered  very  low. 
Stringent  precautions 
introduction  of  viral 
to  prevent 
adventitious  agents  and  to  ensure  microbial  safety  of 
tisagenlecleucel  are  in  place  in  compliance  with  principles  of 
good manufacturing practices and regulatory guidelines.
The  starting  material  for  producing  tisagenlecleucel  are  the 
patient’s  autologous  (i.e.,  donor  and  recipient are  the  same) 
non-mobilised peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected by 
leukapheresis.
Tisagenlecleucel is composed  of autologous CD4+ and CD8+ 
T cells  genetically  modified  with  a  murine  HIV-1  lentiviral 
vector  encoding  a  CAR  against  CD19.  The  product  is 
manufactured by expansion of patient T cells after transduction 
without any hold step. Due to the nature of the product (i.e., 
cells), there is no possibility to introduce terminal sterilisation 
or  dedicated  viral  removal  and  inactivation  steps.  Therefore, 
stringent  precautions 
introduction  of  viral 
to  prevent 
adventitious  agents  and  to  ensure  microbial  safety  of 
tisagenlecleucel product are taken as detailed below. 
1. Control of raw materials and of the tisagenlecleucel vector
 Control  of  animal  and  human  derived  raw  materials 
entering  the  manufacturing  process  through  certificates 
of  origin  and  suitability.  For  human  derived  materials 
such  as  human  serum,  viral  inactivation  steps  in  the 
manufacturing process of these materials are performed
 Control of the production of tisagenlecleucel vector using 
HEK293T  cells,  which  are  not  known  to  express 
endogenous viruses
 Additional  controls  through  filtration  of  raw  materials 
(media) performed prior to use in manufacturing
 Control of the tisagenlecleucel vector through testing for 
adventitious viral agents
 Testing for relevant human viruses as part of the patient 
eligibility assessment
2. Process and environmental controls
of 
the 
drug 
 Control 
tisagenlecleucel 
product 
manufacturing  process  (antibiotics  free)  through  use  of 
closed systems. Where there are open steps, the process 
is performed under environmentally controlled conditions
 Environmental controls (e.g., evaluating the quality of air, 
in  a  cleanroom 
temperature,  surfaces,  personnel 
environment)
 Cleaning  and  decontamination  of work  surfaces  and 
equipment
 Aseptic  verification,  simulating  all  process  steps  and 
interventions  is  conducted  to  verify  that  the  process  is 
capable of maintaining sterility
3. Control of tisagenlecleucel by microbial contaminants 
testing as part of drug product release testing
 Testing for bacterial endotoxin
 Testing for sterility
 Testing for mycoplasma
Details on shipping and storage conditions of tisagenlecleucel 
product and disposal are described in the SmPC.
Since  this  is  a  potential  risk,  no  attributable  increase  to 
tisagenlecleucel has been established. There is a potential risk 
of transmission of infectious agents to close contacts including 
personnel  involved  in  the  tisagenlecleucel  manufacturing 
process or health care providers involved in leukapheresis and 
administering  tisagenlecleucel  in  addition  to  patients  treated 
with tisagenlecleucel.

The  purpose  of  this  Novartis  PASS  is  to  monitor  all  patients 
exposed to lentiviral vector based CD19 CAR T-cell therapy  for 
15 years from the last  CD19 CAR T-cell infusion, to assess the 
risk of delayed AEs suspected to be related to CD19 CAR T-cell
therapy, monitor for vectors persistence and RCL, and record the 
status of the primary malignancy (efficacy).
The primary objective of the study is to describe selected delayed 
AEs suspected to be related to previous CD19 CAR T-cell therapy 
as outlined in current Health Authority guidelines.

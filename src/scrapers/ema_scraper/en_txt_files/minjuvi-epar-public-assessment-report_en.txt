2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Minjuvi is indicated in combination with lenalidomide followed by Minjuvi monotherapy for the treatment 
of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are not eligible 
for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
DLBCL is the most common subtype of Non-Hodgkin lymphomas, constituting 30%–58% of NHL (Tilly 
et al. 2015 and comprises 60% of all new lymphomas in the elderly population (Thieblemont and Coiffier, 
2007). The disease causes approximately 8500 new cases in Europe (Sant et al. 2010) and an estimated 
4000 deaths per year (Marcos-Gragera et al. 2011, De Angelis et al. 2015, Howlader et al. 2016). The 
incidence  of  DLBCL  increases  with  age,  it is  mainly  as  adult/elderly  disease.  The  incidence  rises  from 
<1/100,000 in children to 10-15/100,000 in patients aged 65 years and older, with most cases occurring 
in adults >54 years of age (Sant et al. 2010). A family history of lymphoma, autoimmune disease, human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis C virus (HCV) seropositivity, a high body mass as a 
young adult and some occupational exposures have been identified as risk factors of DLBCL (Morton el 
al. 2014). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) comprise a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative malignancies, 
which in 90% of cases are derived from B-cells with DLBCL with distinctive prognostic profiles including 
cell of origin: germinal centre B-cell (GCB) type or activated B-cell (ABC) type. Other prognostic factors 
are  expression  of  MYC,  BCL2  and  ENO3  genes  (Carreras  et  al.  2020),  TP53  deletion  or  mutation 
(Tessoulin  et  al.  2017),  and  aberrant  microRNA  expression  (Ting  et  al.  2019).  “Double-expression” 
(overexpression of MYC and BCL2 proteins), “double-hit” (dual translocation of MYC and BCL2 or BCL6) 
and  “triple-hit”  (chromosomal  alterations  in  MYC,  BCL2,  and  BCL6)  DLBCL  are  associated  with  a 
particularly poor prognosis (Carreras et al. 2020, Xia and Zhang 2020, Rosenthal and Younes 2017). The 
ABC  (non-GCB)  type  has  been  associated  with  worse  outcome  (Nowakowski  et  al.  2015,  Hans  et  al. 
2004,  Lenz  et  al.  2008).  DLBCL  have  been  categorised  into  different  subtypes  with  different 
characteristics, such as T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive DLBCL, 
DLBCL not otherwise specified (NOS) and others. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
DLBCL primarily develops in the lymph nodes, but in about 40% of the patients “extranodal sites” (areas 
outside  the  lymph  nodes)  may  be  involved,  such  as  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  testes,  thyroid,  skin, 
breast, bone, brain, or essentially any organ of the body, being localised or generalised. DLBCL is an 
aggressive  disease  with  short  life  expectancy  if  left  untreated.  With  currently  available  treatments, 
around 50% of newly diagnosed patients can be cured. DLBCL may arise as de novo, but it can also arise 
from a prior/existing low-grade (indolent) lymphoma, such as follicular lymphoma (FL) or marginal zone 
lymphoma (MZL), it is then commonly referred to as transformed lymphoma. 
Assessment report  
EMA/426468/2021  
Page 10/141 
 
 
 
The  most  commonly  used  risk  assessment  tool  in  DLBCL  is  the  International  Prognostic  Index  (IPI), 
which predicts the risk of relapse/non-cure (International NHL Prognostic Factors Project, 1993). The IPI 
is  determined  at  initial  diagnosis,  and  is  based  on  age,  stage  of  disease  according  to  the  Ann  Arbor 
classification,  lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH)  levels,  Eastern  Co-operative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG) 
performance score and extranodal involvement. Other factors may also affect prognosis and treatment 
strategies, including the maximum bulk of the disease (Tilly et al. 2015). While similar considerations 
apply for treatment of transformed lymphoma, outcomes are somewhat inferior as compared to de novo 
DLBCL (Lossos et al. 2011, Guirguis et al. 2014). 
Most patients are diagnosed with advanced disease, and DLBCL is most frequently diagnosed between 
the age of 65-74 years, with a median age at diagnosis of 70 years (Smith et al. 2015). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Standard  treatment  for  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  DLBCL  consists  of  immuno-chemotherapy  with 
the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab (RTX), and CHOP administered for 6-8 cycles (R-CHOP) 
(Tilly et al. 2015). The addition of RTX has substantially improved the results of CHOP-chemotherapy, 
but still approximately 30-40% of patients ultimately relapse and are not cured by first-line therapy with 
R-CHOP,  and  approximately  20%  of  patients  are  refractory  to  R-CHOP  as  first-line  therapy  (primary 
refractory) (Coiffier et al., 2002).  
In patients progressing or relapsing after first-line treatment, the ultimate goal is salvage chemotherapy 
mainly with platinum- and/or gemcitabine-based regimens, followed by high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) 
with ASCT. This is a potentially curative treatment, significantly improving the disease-free survival and 
overall  survival  (OS)  (Philip  et  al.,  1995).  Many  patients  are  not  fit  enough  to  receive  intensive 
chemotherapy regimens, e.g. because of older age or comorbidities, for these patients, the outcome is 
dismal with generally no prolonged periods of disease control (Thieblemont and Coiffier 2007). Primary 
refractory  patients  who  progress  through  front-line  therapy  also  do  very  poorly  even  after  receipt  of 
salvage  treatment  followed  by  ASCT  with  a  3–year  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  rate  of  17% 
(Vardhana et al. 2017).   
Treatment options for patients who have relapsed or progressed after second-line treatment of DLBCL 
are limited, and there is no consensus regarding the optimal treatment. According to guidelines by the 
European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) (Tilly et al. 2015), recommendations for transplant –non-
eligible patients in first relapse mainly include platinum- and/or gemcitabine-based regimens or clinical 
trials with novel drugs. Of note, none of the agents recommended by the ESMO guidelines (Tilly et al. 
2015)  is  specifically  approved  as  a  second-line  treatment  for  DLBCL.  Bendamustine  +rituximab,  may 
also be used as second line and subsequent therapies, or participation in clinical studies with novel drugs. 
Of newer therapies, the CAR R-cell therapies represent a treatment option for R/R DLBCL patients who 
have received two or more lines of systemic therapy (Neelapu et al. 2017a, Schuster et al. 2017), but 
the  manufacturing  and  distribution  process  is  complex,  the  patients  have  to  tolerate  the  conditioning 
regimen and adverse events such as the risk of neurotoxicity and cytokine-release syndrome must be 
considered.  Pixuvri  is  also  an  option  as  monotherapy  for  patients  with multiply  relapsed or  refractory 
aggressive NHL. In January 2020, the novel antibody-drug conjugate polatuzumab vedotin (Polivy), in 
combination  with  BR,  received  a  conditional  approval  as  second-  or  later-line  therapy  for  R/R  DLBCL 
patients who are not candidates for ASCT. Lenalidomide as single agent and in combination with RTX 
has shown some effect and was well-tolerated in heavily pre-treated patients with R/R DLBCL (Wiernik 
et al., 2008, Zinzani et al. 2011, Czuczman et al. 2017), however lenalidomide is not approved for the 
treatment  of  DLBCL  by  EMA  or  FDA.  Lenalidomide  has  been  approved  for  mantle  cell  lymphoma  and 
follicular  lymphoma.  Recent  approvals  of  CAR  T-cells  or  POLA-BR  in  R/R  DLBCL  have  not  yet  been 
included in the ESMO guidelines which date back to 2015.

About the product 
Tafasitamab  is  a  Fc-enhanced  humanised  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb)  that  binds  to  the  human  B-cell 
surface antigen, CD19. CD19 is expressed throughout normal and malignant B-cell development up to 
terminal plasma cell differentiation and is present on all malignant B-cells, including DLBCL (Olejniczak 
et  al.  2006).  Alteration  of  two  amino  acid  residues in  the  constant  region  of  tafasitamab  significantly 
increases binding to Fc gamma receptors (FcγR), including FcγRIIIa (CD16), and FcγRII (CD32), leading 
to  enhanced  in  vitro  antibody-dependent  cell-mediated  cytotoxicity  (ADCC),  antibody-dependent  cell-
mediated phagocytosis (ADCP), and direct cytotoxic effects (apoptosis) on tumour cells relative to the 
unmodified antibody (Uckun et al. 1988, Tedder et al. 1994, Sato et al. 1997, Otero and Rickert 2003). 
The major pharmacological effect of tafasitamab is B-cell depletion. 
Type of Application and aspects on development

procedure, support a Conditional Marketing Authorisation (refer to the benefit/risk section). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Tafasitamab,  the  active  substance  contained  in  Minjuvi,  is  a  humanised  CD19-specific  monoclonal 
antibody produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology. 
Minjuvi  is  presented  as  a  powder  for  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  containing  200  mg  of 
tafasitamab and formulated with sodium citrate dihydrate, citric acid monohydrate, trehalose dihydrate 
and polysorbate 20.  
Minjuvi is available in a clear type I single-use glass vial with a butyl rubber stopper, aluminium seal and 
a plastic flip-off cap. Each carton contains 1 vial. 
After reconstitution with water for injections (WFI), each mL of solution contains 40 mg of tafasitamab. 
The  reconstituted  solution  is  subsequently  diluted  with  sodium  chloride  9  mg/mL  (0.9%)  solution  for 
injection. The final concentration of the diluted solution is between 2 mg/mL and 8 mg/mL of tafasitamab.

General Information  
Tafasitamab is a Fc-engineered humanised monoclonal antibody that targets the CD19 antigen expressed 
on the surface of pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. Tafasitamab is optimised for increased affinity to Fcγ 
receptors through two amino acid substitutions at positions 243 and 336 (strongest increase observed 
for FcγRIIIa). The Fc modification results in enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) 
and  antibody-dependent  cellular  phagocytosis  (ADCP).  Tafasitamab  does  not  mediate  complement 
dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).  
With  the  exception  of  the  two  intended  amino  acid  changes,  the  protein  sequence  of  tafasitamab  is 
identical  to human  IgG1 in  the  Fab  and  hinge  regions  (through  position  242 and  at  position  331  and 
identical to human IgG2 in the CH2 and CH3 domains (position 244 through the C terminus, except at 
position 331).

Tafasitamab is secreted as a disulfide-linked glycosylated tetramer consisting of two identical 451 amino 
acid  heavy  chains  and  two  identical 219  amino  acid  kappa  light  chains.  The heavy  chain  bears  an  N-
linked glycosylation site at position N301. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
Tafasitamab  active  substance  is  manufactured  at  Boehringer  Ingelheim,  Biberach,  Germany.  EU  GMP 
compliance of this site and other facilities involved in active substance operations was confirmed. 
Tafasitamab  is  produced  in  CHO  cells  in  a  fed-batch  manufacturing  process  and  purified  via  several 
affinity chromatographic- (Protein A, cation exchange (CEX), anion exchange (AEX)) and filtration steps 
(depth,  virus,  tangential  flow  (TFF)).  The  dedicated  virus  neutralisation  steps  consist  of  low-pH  and 
nanofiltration. 
The  tafasitamab  manufacturing  process  is  a  standard  platform  design  for  monoclonal  antibodies 
produced in CHO cells.  
One 12,000 L production bioreactor run results in one purification run providing one batch of tafasitamab 
active substance. One or multiple batches of tafasitamab active substance can be split and/or pooled 
into  multiple  sub-batches  to  provide  the  required  active  substance  volume  for  aseptic  filling  and 
lyophilisation  to  one  lot  of  tafasitamab  finished  product.  Batch  size  and  traceable  batch  ID  is  defined 
from master cell bank (MCB) to finished product. 
The  formulated  active  substance  (40.0  mg/mL  tafasitamab  antibody)  is  either  stored  frozen  for  long-
term storage until filling, or alternatively the active substance can be processed into tafasitamab finished 
product directly without freezing. 
The only allowed form of reprocessing is refiltration of the virus filtrate or active substance. In the event 
of  an  integrity  test  failure  or  mechanical  failure  of  equipment,  the  virus  filtrate  or  active  substance 
material  may  be  reprocessed  one  additional  time.  Verification  of  the  active  substance  refiltration  has 
already been performed during process validation by demonstrating reprocessing on purpose.  
Control of materials 
A  complete  listing  of  the  raw  materials  used  for  the  manufacture  of  tafasitamab  is  provided  with 
specifications  for  the  non-compendial  raw  materials  tested  according  to  the  respective  in-house 
specifications. 
None of the raw materials on the list are considered critical regarding adventitious agents.   
The media used for cell banking and cell culture are described in sufficient detail.  
Information on the source of the host cell line, the preparation and description of the expression vector, 
and the establishment of the cell banks is provided. Expression plasmids encoding the tafasitamab heavy 
chain and light chain were transfected into CHO cell substrate, and the highest producing monoclonal 
cell was selected to generate an MCB. The MCB was subsequently used to prepare a working cell bank 
(WCB), which was used for the production of clinical trial material and will be used for commercial supply. 
The  procedures  to  generate  MCB  and  WCBs  are  described.  Both  MCB  and  WCB  were  tested  and 
characterised  in  accordance  with  ICH  guideline  requirements  and  were  both  confirmed  to  be  of  CHO 
origin.  The  expression  of  the  expected  cDNA  sequence  was  confirmed.  The  genetic  stability  of  the 
production cell line has been demonstrated (limit of in vitro cell age).  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Assessment report  
EMA/426468/2021  
Page 13/141 
 
 
 
Controls  for  critical  manufacturing  process  steps  have  been  established  for  the  manufacture  of 
tafasitamab active substance to ensure consistent process performance and the desired product quality. 
For all critical process parameters (CPPs) which may affect the quality and safety of the final product 
relevant controls have been established. The in-process control (IPC) limits and acceptance criteria as 
well as the proven acceptable ranges (PARs) for the CPP are defined and presented. The justifications 
provided in the manufacturing process development section are found appropriate. 
Process validation  
The process control strategy is designed based on a lifecycle approach. The process control strategy is 
verified at manufacturing scale and a data monitoring/trending plan is established for the commercial 
manufacturing.  
Process validation lifecycle activities include: 
• 
Process evaluation:  
The  process  control  strategy  is  evaluated  by  a  failure  mode  risk  analysis  (FMEA),  taking  into 
consideration scientific knowledge, parameter characterisation through laboratory scale studies as 
well as commercial manufacturing scale data. 
• 
Process verification:  
The  effectiveness  of  the  process  control  strategy  is  demonstrated  at  manufacturing  scale  using 
qualified  equipment.  The  results  of  process  parameter  control,  in-process  tests  and  release  tests 
demonstrate that the manufacturing process is controlled effectively and performs reproducibly to 
yield  tafasitamab  that  meets  the  desired  product  quality  criteria.  Process  verification  of  the 
manufacturing  process  was  successfully  completed  by  producing  consecutive  batches  at  the 
commercial manufacturing scale using qualified equipment. 
Concurrent  validation  support  activities  have  been  initiated  to  validate  the  performance  over  the 
lifetimes  of  chromatography  resins  and  TFF  membranes  including  their  cleaning  and  storage 
procedures.  Verification  protocols  of  the  refiltration  procedures  at  the  virus  filtration  and  active 
substance filtration steps were prepared. These activities will continue concurrently with commercial 
manufacturing. 
•  Ongoing process verification: 
The  validated  state  of  the  process  control  strategy  is  ensured  through  an  ongoing  data 
monitoring/trending programme. 
Process validation of the active substance is considered acceptable. 
Manufacturing process development 
The control strategy for tafasitamab and the documentation of comparability of the four manufacturing 
process generations, CMC1, CMC2, CMC3 and CMC4, has been provided and described in sufficient detail.  
A Quality by Design (QbD) approach is used for the manufacturing process development of tafasitamab. 
No design space is claimed. 
The Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) of tafasitamab has been described in sufficient detail as well 
as the risk-based assessment of tafasitamab quality attributes related to the molecule, the process, the 
quality and safety. The critical quality attributes (CQA) are controlled as critical process input parameters 
(CPP)  with  PARs  defined  by  the  process  characteristic  studies  (PCS)  and  virus  validation  studies  as 
applicable.

Four manufacturing processes have been used throughout the history of tafasitamab. CMC1 materials 
was used for toxicological studies and the phase I study. Due to certain limitations, the manufacturing 
process was thereafter transferred and a number of major changes were introduced to lead to the CMC2 
process.  Two  other  process  variants  (CMC3  and  CMC4)  were  subsequently  developed.  CMC4  is  the 
commercial process format but both CMC2 and CMC4 have been used in the L-MIND pivotal clinical study 
which  is  the  focus  of  this  application.  Impact  of  the  different  processes  on  comparability  has  been 
assessed and specific attention has been brought to comparability between CMC2 and CMC4 materials 
including head-to-head comparison and extended characterisation. Overall, comparability was shown for 
each  process  change  showing  representativeness  across  clinical  trial  materials  and  to  the  proposed 
commercial  material.  Furthermore,  direct  comparison  between  CMC2  and  CMC4  corroborated 
comparable physicochemical, biological and stability/degradation profiles. 
The comparability programme is performed in line with CHMP and ICH guidelines. This is acceptable.  
Characterisation 
The characterisation of tafasitamab and of the process- and product-related impurities is performed with 
state-of-the-art  analytical  methods  and  orthogonal  methods.  The  characterisation  is  appropriate  and 
described in sufficient detail.   
Elucidation of structure 
Orthogonal  standard  and  state-of-the-art  methods  were  applied  to  determine  physicochemical  and 
immunological properties, biological activity, purity, impurities and quantity of tafasitamab. Primary and 
higher order structure, heterogeneity with respect to size, charge, glycosylation, glycation, oxidation as 
well as biological activity and binding were analysed. 
The structure is a combination of IgG1 (Fab and hinge region) and IgG2 (CH2 and CH3 domain). The Fc 
binding to Fc-γ receptors (FcγRs)) is enhanced through the modification at two amino acids in the CH2 
domain.   
The heterogeneity characterisation concerned free thiols, oxidised methionine and tryptophan variants, 
charge variants, isomerisation of aspartate and C-terminal variants.  
The charge variant study of deamidated variants characterised deamidation hotspots and the impact on 
biological function. A deamidation hotspot showed influence on the ability to bind to the target CD19. A 
proportional impact of deamidation on potency was seen for material generated by forced degradation. 
The level of deamidated species is controlled during the manufacturing process via process design and 
the  process  parameters.  Furthermore,  the  release  specifications  for  active  substance  and  finished 
product are controlling the level of deamidated species.  
N-glycan variants were characterised to influence the biological activity.  
Galactose levels were identified not to have influence on the potency. The level of afucosylation is known 
to have influence on the effector function but was measured at low levels and is therefore of no significant 
influence on the Fc-binding activity. 
Characterisation of size variants showed a high purity No hyper-potent species were identified.  
The biological activity was characterised by orthogonal potency tests, as well as cell-based assays. At 
release,  the  target  binding  is  analysed  via  a  cell-based  CD19  binding  assay.  ADCC  killing  activity  is 
determined  by  measuring  the  lysis  of  target  cells  by  using  an  effector  cell  line.  For  characterisation 
purposes  an  additional  ADCC  reporter  bioassay  and  a  flow  cytometry-based  ADCP  assay  were  used. 
Furthermore, binding to recombinant human CD19 and human Fc gamma receptors and the neonatal Fc 
receptor  (FcRn)  was  analysed.  The  results  confirmed  that  tafasitamab  binds  to  all  human  FcγRs  with 
Assessment report  
EMA/426468/2021  
Page 15/141 
 
 
 
higher affinities than reported for non-engineered human IgG1 and that the ADCC as well as the ADCP 
activities were enhanced. 
Impurities 
The  process-  and  product-related  impurities  are  identified,  and  the  clearance  capacity  of  the 
manufacturing process is evaluated to ensure acceptable low levels.  
The product-related impurities are CQAs and controlled via the IPCs and process validation. The process-
related impurities are also risk assessed and the worst-case scenario exposure (WCSE) was compared 
to the permitted daily exposure (PDE). A buffer used in the purification step had a WCSE above PDA and 
the clearance capacity of  the manufacturing process was analysed in a spiking study to be below the 
limit  of  quantitation  (LoQ.)  The  clearance  capacity  was  also  documented  for  the  process-related 
impurities, e.g. host cell DNA and host cell proteins (HCPs)on all available commercial scale batches. The 
detection of HCPs was performed with an ELISA using rabbit antibodies. 
The  risk  assessment  of  the  materials  in  contact  with  the  active  substance  during  the  manufacturing 
process revealed suitability and no risk for safety or quality, hence no extractables and leachables studies 
were performed. 
The  risk  of  presence  of  elemental  impurities  in  a  concentration  that  has  a  safety  impact  is  generally 
considered very low in biotech products due to the chromatography steps and especially TFF, therefore 
no specific control for elemental impurities is performed. This approach is considered acceptable.        
Specification 
The specification for the active substance includes control of identity, purity and impurity, potency and 
other general tests. 
Following tightening of the acceptance limit for the ADCC assay and further justification regarding the 
acceptance criteria for CD19 binding assay and CEX main peak, the specification for the control of the 
active substance at release and stability is considered acceptable. 
The applicant is recommended to evaluate additional data from subsequent batches and re-evaluate the 
release and shelf life acceptance criteria for active substance and finished product based on statistical 
evaluation and trend analyses of the results (see Recommendation). The re-evaluation will be done using 
suitable  statistical  approaches  and  will  be  conducted  after  at  least  25  active  substance  batches  have 
been produced, including the data from already available CMC4 active substance batches. If changes to 
the  dossier  should  be  necessary,  the  applicant  will  submit  a  variation  of  appropriate  category,  as 
applicable. 
Analytical methods 
The proposed analytical procedures were satisfactorily validated in line with ICH requirements and they 
are considered suitable to control the active substance on a routine basis.  
Potency is controlled by CD19 binding and ADCC. The CD19 binding assay is a cell-based quantitative 
method  to  evaluate  binding  of  tafasitamab  to  the  CD19  receptor  relative  to  the  reference  material. 
Acceptance criteria for the CD19 binding assay were set based on a statistical approach and justified by 
clinical  studies.  The  ADCC  bioassay,  is  a  quantitative  method  to  evaluate  the  relevant  mechanism  of 
action  of  tafasitamab  relative  to  the  tafasitamab  reference  material.  The  potency  of  the  reference 
material is set to 100%. 
Batch analysis  
Assessment report  
EMA/426468/2021  
Page 16/141 
 
 
 
Batch information and analytical release data from all tafasitamab active substance batches produced so 
far that were used for clinical supply, stability studies, process verification or are intended for market 
supply is provided. 
All tafasitamab active substance batches were tested to the respective specifications that were in place 
at the time of release, and which were applicable for the respective stage of development.  
All CMC4 batches intended for clinical or commercial use meet the proposed commercial specification 
acceptance criteria. 
Reference standard 
The applicant established appropriately characterised in-house primary and working reference 
standards, prepared from lot representative of production. Working reference standards used in the 
testing of production lots was calibrated against the primary reference material. Documentation of the 
qualification, storage conditions and stability programme of primary and working reference standards 
was provided. A suitable protocol for qualification of future primary and working reference materials 
was also described. 
Container closure system 
The active substance container closure system is described in sufficient detail in relation to structure and 
compatibility. The choice of the container closure system was chosen to pose low risk for extractables 
and leachables and to provide adequate protection from microbial contamination.  
Other types of material that come into contact with the active substance include the filter units for which 
compatibility has been documented.   
Stability 
The active substance stability protocol is in compliance with the ICH guidelines.  Primary stability studies 
were  performed  on  batches  representative  of  the  commercial  manufacturing  process.  The  proposed 
shelf-life and storage conditions are supported by the stability studies.  
No differences in the stability indicating parameters were observed in all stability studies conducted. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf 
life in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development   
Description of the finished product 
Tafasitamab  finished  product  is  a  lyophilised  powder  for  reconstitution  and  intravenous  infusion.  The 
finished product is a white to slightly yellowish lyophilisate for reconstitution with 5 mL WFI, supplied in 
single-use 20 R glass vials.  
All excipients used in the manufacture of tafasitamab are compendial (sodium citrate dihydrate, citric 
acid monohydrate, trehalose dihydrate and polysorbate 20). No excipients of animal or human origin or 
any novel excipients are used in the manufacture of tafasitamab. 
After  reconstitution  with  WFI,  tafasitamab  is  presented  at  a  concentration  of  40 mg/mL  in  a  citrate 
buffered,  isotonic  solution  at  pH  6.0.  The  target  pH  is  achieved  by  the  molar  ratio  of  sodium  citrate 
dihydrate and citric acid monohydrate. the surfactant polysorbate 20 (PS20) and the osmolyte trehalose 
are  used.  The  reconstituted  finished  product  solution  is  unchanged  with  regard  to  concentration  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/426468/2021  
Page 17/141 
 
 
 
composition  compared  to  the  active  substance  solution.  Each  vial  is  designed  to  deliver  200  mg  of 
tafasitamab. 
To  ensure  that  5.0  mL,  corresponding  to  200  mg,  can  be  extracted  from  the  20  R  vials  after 
reconstitution, an overfill of is applied. 
Pharmaceutical development 
Four different processes, CMC1 to CMC4, were used during development of tafasitamab finished product. 
The final concentration, pharmaceutical form, formulation composition and primary container closure of 
the CMC4 process have been evaluated in phase II and III clinical studies and in a 13-week repeat-dose 
toxicity study and are considered both toxicologically and clinically qualified. 
The  finished  product  formulation  developed  from  a  liquid  to  a  lyophilised  formulation.  The  lyophilised 
dosage form was introduced to improve product stability. The resulting formulation remained unchanged 
through CMC2, CMC3 and CMC4 and was selected as the commercial formulation. 
Finished product release data from all batches used in clinical development from CMC1 to CMC4 have 
been compared, and a side-by-side analysis of CMC2 and CMC4 finished product material was conducted. 
The results show that material from all four manufacturing processes were comparable. Characterisation 
of the active substance from CMC1 to CMC4 confirmed comparability and no additional changes were 
identified in finished product characterisation. Therefore, evaluation of the analytical comparability show 
that  the  developmental  changes  made  to  the  finished  product  manufacturing  process  did  not  affect 
finished product quality. 
As  for  active  substance,  the  applicant  has  applied  QbD  principles  in  the  development  of  the  finished 
product and their manufacturing process. No design space is claimed for the manufacturing process of 
the  finished  product.  The  development  includes  definition  of  the  QTPP,  CQA  and  CPP  identification 
through  prior  knowledge,  risk  assessments  and  characterisation  studies.  Data  provided  to  justify  the 
finished product control strategy are comprehensive. Materials used in the manufacturing (filtering and 
filling) of finished product have been evaluated with respect to extractables and leachables. All potential 
leachables from materials used in production were at a level below the PDE dose at rough extraction 
conditions. The same is true for elemental impurities originating from sources in contact with the final 
finished  product  (active  substance,  equipment,  water,  excipients  and  container  closure  system). 
Therefore, material leachables or elemental impurities are evaluated to pose no risk to patients using 
tafasitamab. 
The container closure system has been evaluated to be suitable for storage of finished product through 
extractable/leachables studies, stability studies and shipping validation. It is in compliance with Ph. Eur. 
requirements.  
Tafasitamab  finished  product  contains  no  preservative.  The  microbiological  quality  complies  with  EU 
requirements for sterile products and is ensured by a combination of various measures - sterile product-
contact components, sterile in-line filtration, environmental and media monitoring - and is confirmed by 
microbiological  IPC  testing  as  well  as  sterility  release  testing.  Container  closure  integrity,  to  maintain 
sterility  during  storage,  has  been  validated  and  is  continuously  controlled  as  part  of  the  stability 
specification. 
The  finished  product  is  intended  to  be  administered  via  intravenous  infusion  using  WFI  (for 
reconstitution) and sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution (for dilution). Physicochemical stability of 
the reconstituted solution and the diluted infusion were demonstrated for the durations and conditions 
as listed in the product information. From a microbiological point of view, although microbial challenge 
tests  demonstrated  that  microbial  proliferation  was  not  observed  in  any  reconstituted  and  diluted 
tafasitamab solutions, the product should be used immediately. Compatibility between finished product 
Assessment report  
EMA/426468/2021  
Page 18/141 
 
 
 
and the plastic material used for infusion was confirmed in a 24-hour contact study comprising of the 
most commonly used containers, infusion lines and sterile filters. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture 
Tafasitamab finished product is manufactured and tested at EU GMP compliant sites. 
The manufacturing process of tafasitamab finished product is well described. It is a simple process where 
the already formulated active substance is thawed, sterile filtered, filled into vials and lyophilised. Upon 
completion of the lyophilisation cycle, vials are fully stoppered and crimped, and a 100% visual inspection 
is  performed  before  shipping  for  secondary  packaging  and  labelling.  Adequate  CPPs  and  IPCs  are  in 
place. Acceptable process ranges were established and supported by process development studies. 
The batch size varies based on commercial needs.  
Process validation 
Each step of the finished product manufacturing process (sterile filtration, aseptic filling, lyophilisation, 
crimping and 100% visual inspection) have been properly validated.  
The sterile filters have been validated and certified by the supplier. Additionally, the suitability of the 
filter membrane was verified through a bacterial retention study. Filter validation has been performed in 
accordance with the Guideline on the sterilization of the medicinal product, active substance, excipient 
and primary container (EMA/CHMP/CVMPQWP/850374/2015). Filter integrity pre- and post-filtration has 
been validated and is controlled in routine production by in-process filter integrity controls pre and post 
filtration. A consistency validation study confirmed that finished product quality was unchanged prior to 
and post sterilisation for all three process verification batches. Possible leaching from filter material was 
found to be very low and not considered to pose any toxicological risk to patients using tafasitamab. 
All hold- and light-exposure times for finished product were within the predefined criteria for all three 
process verification batches, and the final finished product was within the specifications valid at the time 
of process validation. 
Product specification 
The specification for the finished product includes control of identity, purity and impurity, potency and 
other general tests. 
The finished product specification was established in line with ICH Q6B and Ph. Eur. monograph 2031 
on monoclonal antibodies for human use. 
For  the  finished  product  specific  specifications  (appearance  of  cake,  reconstitution  time,  residual 
moisture  and  polysorbate  20),  the  acceptance  criteria  are  set  based  on  data  from  clinical  CMC3  and 
CMC4 finished product batches, which have consistently provided the same results, and on formulation 
robustness studies.  
The finished product specification is considered acceptable. 
The potential presence of  elemental impurities in the active substance and finished product has been 
assessed on a risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D guideline for elemental impurities. The risk 
of  carryover  of  elemental  impurities  from  reagents  and  materials  used  for  manufacture  is  considered 
negligible and no additional control is required. 
A  risk  evaluation  concerning  the  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  finished  product  has  been 
performed, considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) 
Assessment report  
EMA/426468/2021  
Page 19/141 
 
 
 
No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and 
the “Assessment report - Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004 - Nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided, it is 
accepted  that  no  risk  was  identified  on  the  possible  presence  of  nitrosamine  impurities  in  the  active 
substance or finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. 
Analytical procedures  
Several analytical procedures for finished product are also used at active substance level and have thus 
been described and validated in the active substance part of the dossier. 
The methods appearance (coloration, clarity and opalescence), subvisible particles, content uniformity, 
and sterility are compendial methods with predefined acceptance criteria for monoclonal antibodies and 
injections in general. 
For the finished product non-compendial methods for appearance and description, functional tests and 
excipients have all been appropriately qualified/validated. 
Batch analysis  
Data for CMC4 batches supports batch consistency and uniformity of the finished product. The same is 
true for CMC1, CMC2 and CMC3 batches, underlining that the finished product manufacturing process 
has been robust throughout development and manufacturing of tafasitamab finished product. 
Reference material 
The reference standard used for tafasitamab finished product is the same as the reference standard used 
for active substance. 
Container closure 
The choice of the container closure system is in line with pharmaceutical standards and the components 
comply  with  pharmacopoeial  requirements.  Both  vials  and  rubber  stoppers  have  been  analysed  with 
respect to extractables according to Ph. Eur. and the results are acceptable. 
Stability of the product 
Stability testing was performed per ICH and CHMP guidelines.  
One CMC3 and six CMC4 batches are used as primary stability batches. Sixty months stability data are 
available for the CMC3 batch and 18-48 months data are available for the six CMC4 batches. Therefore, 
the proposed shelf life is covered by real-time data from the CMC3 batch and two CMC4 batches. The 
use  of  a  CMC3  batch  in  stability  studies  has  been  justified  by  the  similarities  in  manufacturing  and 
formulation between CMC3 and CMC4, the comparability between CMC3 and CMC4 active substance and 
finished product and the same container closure system being used for material from the two processes. 
CMC4  batches  were  used  for  post-reconstitution  stability,  one  of  which  was  also  used  in  the  in-use 
stability study. 
All long-term stability data remain within the specification presented.  
Stability after reconstitution has been investigated by reconstituting the lyophilised finished product with 
WFI  and  storing  it  up to 24  hours  at up  to  25°C.  The  results  support  the  post-reconstitution  stability 
claim of 24 hours at 2-25°C. In-use stability has been assessed by diluting the reconstituted finished 
product in saline solution and storing it for 36h at 5±3°C followed by up to 24 hours at up to 25°C. All 
physico-chemical  in-use  stability  results  were  within  acceptance  criteria  of  the  chosen  subset  of 
specification test, and no increase in microbial count was observed. The results thus support the in-use 
stability claim of 36 hours at 2-8°C followed by up to 24 hours at maximum 25°C.  
Assessment report  
EMA/426468/2021  
Page 20/141 
 
 
 
An in-use shaking study was performed supporting that tafasitamab finished product can be transported 
after  reconstitution  and  dilution.  A  photostability  study  showed  that  the  finished  product  should  be 
protected from light as stated in the SmPC.  
The post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment are acceptable. 
Container  closure  integrity  is  tested to  confirm  container  closure  integrity.  The  provided  data  confirm 
container closure integrity for up to 12 months for the finished product process verification batches and 
up  to  36  months  for  an  additional  finished  product batch;  and the  applicant  commits  to  continue  the 
testing according to the stability protocol and inform the authorities in case of any out-of-specification 
results. 
The  data  presented  support  the  claimed  shelf  life  for  the  finished  product  of  36  months  under  the 
proposed storage conditions of 5 ± 3°C protected from light. 
Adventitious agents 
Testing  of  starting  materials  and  monitoring  of  process  intermediates  during  manufacturing  provides 
high  assurance  that  no  viral  or  non-viral  adventitious  agents  are  introduced  into  the  manufacturing 
process of tafasitamab. Raw materials containing human- or animal-derived material were only used for 
development and generation of the host cell line and MCB. These materials are certified as non-BSE/TSE 
containing and the high dilution during cell culture expansion and the subsequent virus reducing steps 
of  the  manufacturing  process  makes  it  unlikely  that  BSE/TSE  would  be  present  in  the  final  finished 
product. 
Qualified scale-down models were used in the virus validation study, which was carried out in accordance 
with ICH Q5A. The model viruses used were xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus (xMuLV), Minute Virus of 
Mice (MVM), Pseudorabies Virus (PRV) and Reovirus type 3 (Reo-3). These model viruses were selected 
based on ICH Q5A to represent a broad range of virus types and characteristics. Global reduction factors 
were  satisfactory  regarding  the  virus  removal/inactivation  for  enveloped  viruses  as  well  as  for  non-
enveloped viruses.  
Lastly, the active substance is tested for bacterial endotoxins and bioburden at release and the finished 
product is tested for sterility and bacterial endotoxins at release, providing assurance that no bacterial 
contamination is present in the final finished product. 
Adventitious agents safety is considered satisfactory. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the Minjuvi quality dossier is of high quality and the documentation for the manufacture, control 
and stability of tafasitamab is provided in sufficient detail. 
The control strategy uses a QbD approach with a defined QTPP that is found acceptable.  
Four manufacturing processes have been used during development and comparability has been shown.  
All relevant product-related variants and impurities are controlled in the manufacturing process via IPCs 
or release specifications.

The  stability  of  both  finished  product  and  active  substance  has  been  analysed  according  to  relevant 
guidelines and the proposed shelf lives are supported by real-time data.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of Minjuvi is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in 
the SmPC. Physico-chemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the 
product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
In conclusion, based on the review of the quality data provided, the marketing authorisation application 
for Minjuvi is considered approvable from the quality point of view.  
The applicant agreed to a Recommendation. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommended a point for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
 The  non-clinical  testing  strategy  for  tafasitamab  consisted  of  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetic,  toxicokinetic  and  toxicology  studies.  Non-clinical  studies  with  tafasitamab  were 
designed to support human clinical trials in CD19 positive hematologic malignancies and the marketing 
authorisation application of tafasitamab.  
The pivotal toxicology studies supporting the development of tafasitamab were conducted in accordance 
with  GLP  regulations  at  test  facilities/test  sites,  which  were  part  of  EU  or  an  OECD  GLP  monitoring 
programme. Safety pharmacology was included in the pivotal toxicology studies.   
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies 
Binding to CD19 
Tafasitamab binding to human CD19 was analysed  by flow cytometry with HEK 293T cells transiently 
expressing  human  CD19  and  a  half-maximal  effective  concentration  (EC50)  of  4.8  nM  was  observed 
(TR07098). EC95 (i.e. 95% receptor occupancy) was derived from the binding curve obtained and was 
determined at 90.4 nM (or 13.6 µg/ml; TR07098 Addendum 1).

Table 1: Effective concentration at a given % maximal binding of tafasitamab to CD19 
expressing HEK cells (ECF) 
Further  flow  cytometry  analysis  of  tafasitamab  cross-reactivity  with  lymphocytes  of  various  species 
demonstrated  that  the  antibody  recognizes  CD19  from  human  as  well  as  cynomolgus  and  rhesus 
monkeys, but not common laboratory animals such as the mouse, rat, rabbit, or dog (XC9-23209). In 
summary, tafasitamab binds to human CD19 as expected, predicated on its parental murine 4G7 binding 
pattern. Interestingly, the humanisation and affinity maturation also resulted in binding of tafasitamab 
to  macaque  CD19,  which  supported  the  use  of  cynomolgus  monkeys  for  toxicological  evaluation  of 
tafasitamab.

Binding of Tafasitamab to Mouse, Cynomolgus Monkey and Human Fcγ Receptors 
Binding of tafasitamab to murine, cynomolgus monkey and human FcγRs was characterised using surface 
plasmon  resonance  (SPR)  analysis  and  was  compared  to  the  native  IgG1  version  of  the  antibody 
(TR08137). The engineering of the constant region of tafasitamab lead to increased binding affinity for 
Fc gamma receptors (FcγR) in all tested species. 
The binding affinity of Fc regions of therapeutic antibodies to the human activating receptors FcγRIIIa 
and  FcγRIIa  is  known  to  impact  clinical  efficacy.  Cancer  patients  carrying  FcγR  alleles  with  a  higher 
binding affinity have been reported to respond better to immunotherapy than those with lower affinity 
alleles (Cartron G et al., 2002; Cheung NK et al., 2006). The protein engineering strategy in the design 
of  tafasitamab  (MOR00208)  was  to  create  an  antibody  with  increased  binding  affinity  to  FcγRs, 
independent  of  the  patient’s  allelic  genotype.  Notably,  the  affinities  of  tafasitamab  for  the  human 
activating  Fcγ  receptor  RIIIa  were  increased  47  and  130-fold  (V158  and  F158  allele)  relative  to  the 
unmodified IgG1 antibody. Binding affinities for the human activating Fcγ receptor RIIa (R131 and H131 
allele) were increased 11 and 5.4-fold over the unmodified IgG1, respectively.  
Binding  characteristics  of  tafasitamab  to  FcγRs  from  humans  and  cynomolgus  monkeys  were  similar, 
further validating the cynomolgus monkey as the appropriate non-clinical species for evaluation of the

pharmacological and toxicological properties of the enhanced effector function properties of tafasitamab. 
Finally,  tafasitamab  binds  with  substantially  greater  affinity  to  mouse  FcγRs  compared  to  the  native 
human  IgG1  antibody.  Hence,  human  xenograft  mouse  tumour  models  allow  for  testing  of  the  anti-
tumour efficacy of tafasitamab in vivo.

Mode of Action: ADCC, ADCP and Direct Cytotoxicity (Apoptosis) 
The  Fc-mediated  effector  function  properties  of  tafasitamab  were  evaluated  using  in  vitro  cell-based 
assays with isolated human NK cells (TR08139), gamma delta T cells (MOR208L029) or macrophages 
(TR08139) as effector cells. Tumour cell lines tested included Burkitt’s lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia (CLL), hairy cell leukemia (HCL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), diffuse large B cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), all of which expressed varying levels of CD19 antigen 
ranging from 15,000 to 105,000 molecules/cell. 
Figure 1: ADCC activity of XmAb5574 against multiple tumour cell lines 
ADCC was measured with an LDH release assay using purified IL-2-activated NK cells as effectors and 
nine lymphoma or leukemia cell lines as targets. The target cell lines used and the corresponding number 
of CD19 molecules/cell (in parentheses) were as follows: Burkitt’s Lymphoma: Raji (105,000), Namalwa 
(37,000),  Ramos  (56,000);  DLBCL:  SU-DHL-6  (15,000);  CLL:  Wac3CD5  (38,000);  CML:  BV-  173 
(80,000);  ALL:  RS4;11  (43,000),  SUP-B15  (49,000);  HCL:  Bonna-12  (29,000).  Target  cells  were 
opsonised with antibodies and mixed with NK cells at a cell ratio of 1:5; LDH release was measured 4 
hours later. Data were obtained in triplicate; error bars indicate standard deviations (SD).  
Tafasitamab mediates potent ADCC against CD19 expressing tumour cell lines as well as primary ALL, 
MCL  and  CLL  cells.  Furthermore,  tafasitamab  mediates  potent  ADCP  of  CD19  expressing  tumour  cell

lines.  The  Fc  engineering  of  tafasitamab  resulted  in  significant  increases  in  ADCC  and  ADCP  activity 
relative to the native IgG1 control antibody leading to increased potency as well as maximal cell killing. 
Figure 2: ADCC activity of XmAb5574 against primary tumour cells 
Target primary tumour cells were obtained from patients with ALL (A) or MCL (B). All samples showed 
high  CD19  expression.  Tumour  cells  were  labeled  with  51Cr  (100  μCi  /106  cells),  opsonized  with 
antibodies, and mixed with PBMCs at a cell ratio of 1:80 for 4 hours; ADCC was determined using 51Cr 
release. Shown are averages of three experiments from three different PBMC donors; error bars indicate 
SD. 
Figure 3: ADCP activity of XmAb5574 against tumour cell lines 
ADCP was determined by flow cytometry using RS4;11 (A) or SUP-B15 (B) cells as targets and monocyte-
derived macrophages (MDM) as effector cells. % ADCP was calculated as the number of double positive 
cells divided by the total number of tumour cells. Data were obtained in triplicate; error bars indicate 
SD. 
In  addition,  tafasitamab  exhibits  direct  cytotoxic  and  antiproliferative  effects  mediated  by  caspase-
induced apoptosis (TR08138). Induction of apoptosis in B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma SU-DHL-6 cells 
was demonstrated by annexin V staining and caspase activation. The increased antiproliferative activity 
of tafasitamab relative to the unmodified IgG1 analog in a FcγR crosslinking assay format, suggests a 
role of the optimised Fc binding to FcγRs in mediating this effect.

Figure 4: Anti-proliferative and caspase-mediated apoptosis activity of XmAb5574 against 
CD19+ tumour cells 
Studies  were  performed  on  SU-DHL-6  cells  using  a  human  FcRIIIa-GST  fusion  receptor  to  provide 
antibody crosslinking. A, proliferation assay: cross-linked antibodies were incubated with 6⋅103 cells for 
72 hours, and cell titres were analysed using a luminescent cell viability assay. Data were obtained in 
triplicate;  error  bars  indicate  SD.  B  and  C,  apoptosis  was  assayed  using  caspase  activation  (B)  and 
annexin V staining (C). Cross-linked antibodies were incubated with SU-DHL-6 cells for 48 h. Caspase 
activity  was  quantitated  using  a  fluorometric  assay.  For  the  annexin  V  assay,  cells  were  labeled  with 
annexin V-PE and 7-amino-actinomycin D, and fluorescence was analysed by flow cytometry. For both 
B and C, data are from a single experiment. 
Moreover, it was shown that γδ T cells can act as an additional effector cell population to NK cells and 
macrophages in antibody-mediated tumour cell lysis (MOR208L029). Tafasitamab demonstrated ADCC 
activity  mediated  by  γδ  T  cells  towards  several  lymphoma  and  leukemia  cell  lines  as  well  as  primary 
patient-derived CLL, MCL and B-ALL cells. Tafasitamab activity was distinctly enhanced compared to the 
IgG1 analog. 
Tafasitamab does not induce CDC activity against any of the tested B cell lymphoma cell lines (TR08139).  
In Vivo Anti-tumour Efficacy of Tafasitamab in SCID Mice Bearing Subcutaneously Implanted 
Human Raji and RAMOS Lymphoma 
The in vivo efficacy of tafasitamab was evaluated using subcutaneous xenograft models in SCID mice 
engrafted with human Burkitt’s lymphoma Raji or RAMOS cells. Mice bearing s.c. injected Raji tumour 
cells and treated with 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg tafasitamab (intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection on Days 3, 6, 10 and 
13 after tumour cell inoculation) exhibited a statistically significant reduction in tumour growth compared 
to phosphate buffered saline (PBS) vehicle treatment. In addition, 33% (2/6) of mice in the 10 mg/kg 
tafasitamab-treated group were tumour free at Day 42 after injection of tumour cells (XC9-05407).

(i.p.  twice  per  week  for  3  weeks)  and  exhibited  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  tumour  growth 
compared to treatment with PBS vehicle and an unmodified IgG1 (XC9-05607).

Efficacy  of  tafasitamab  was  compared  to  rituximab  in  a  similar  study  in  SCID  mice  bearing 
subcutaneously implanted human Ramos lymphoma. Tumour growth inhibition increased in the order of

In summary, statistically significant reductions in tumour growth were observed in tafasitamab treated 
SCID mice engrafted with CD19 expressing human lymphomas. 
Combination with lenalidomide 
The  combination  of  tafasitamab  with  the  immunomodulatory  drug  lenalidomide  was  investigated  for 
enhanced antitumour activity. Lenalidomide activates T cells to release the cytokines interferon gamma 
(IFN-γ)  and  interleukin-2  (IL-2),  which  stimulate  NK  cell  activity  and  induce  an  increase  in  NK  cell 
numbers (Kotla et al., 2009; Gribben et al., 2015). In addition, lenalidomide increases NK-cell expression 
of  FcγRIII,  the  receptor  with  high-affinity  binding  to  tafasitamab  (Lapalombella  et  al.,  2008).  The 
enhancement  of  tafasitamab-mediated  NK-cell  activation  and  ADCC  activity  by  lenalidomide  was 
demonstrated in previously published in vitro experiments (Awan et al., 2010). 
The combination of tafasitamab with lenalidomide was evaluated with several DLBCL cell lines in vitro 
and  in  a  disseminated  RAMOS  lymphoma  model  in  vivo.  Human  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells 
(PBMC)  were  incubated  with  lenalidomide  and  used  as  effector  cells  in  cytotoxicity  assays  with 
tafasitamab  and  SU-DHL-2,  SU-DHL-4,  SU-DHL-6  and  U2392  DLCBL  derived  tumour  cell  lines.  The 
combination  of  tafasitamab  with  lenalidomide  treated  PBMCs  from  various  healthy  donors  resulted  in 
ADCC enhancement of tafasitamab in cytotoxicity assays with all tested DLBCL cell lines (MOR208L039). 
These data are in line with the described mode of action of lenalidomide as an activator of NK cells (Kotla 
et al.; 2009, Gribben et al., 2015), as NK cells are the main effector cell population in PBMC mediated 
ADCC assays.

lenalidomide (LEN) against SU-DHL-4, SUDHL- 6, SU-DHL-2 and U-2932 cells (MOR208L039) 
Tafasitamab and lenalidomide combination therapy was also investigated in a disseminated RAMOS non-
Hodgkin  lymphoma  survival  model.  Lenalidomide  (100  or  200  mg/kg)  was  administered  p.o.  for  28 
consecutive days and tafasitamab (3 mg/kg) was administered i.v. twice weekly for three weeks. The 
combination of tafasitamab and lenalidomide resulted in increased anti-tumour activity compared to both 
monotherapy regimens in vivo (MOR208P009). These findings support combination treatment of CD19 
positive tumours with the Fc-domain engineered antibody tafasitamab and the NK cell activating drug 
lenalidomide.  Due  to  their  complementary  modes  of  action,  the  two  drugs  act  cooperatively  against 
tumour cells expressing CD19.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Effects on B-lymphocytes were investigated in an 8-week toxicity study of tafasitamab administered i.v. 
every  two  weeks  (XC9-14408)  and  a  13-week  toxicity  study  of  tafasitamab  administered  weekly 
(MOR208P008).

Administered  by  Intravenous  Infusion  Every  Two  Weeks  to  Cynomolgus  Monkeys,  with  a  90-Day 
Recovery Period’ 
Changes  in  the  lymphocyte  subsets  including  T-,  B-,  and  NK-cells  in  peripheral  blood  of  cynomolgus 
monkeys were assessed in response to tafasitamab administered as an i.v. infusion at doses of 2, 10, or 
50 mg/kg every two weeks for 8 weeks in cynomolgus monkeys (XC9-14408). Tafasitamab substantially 
depleted total B-lymphocyte (CD3-CD20+) in the peripheral blood of treated cynomolgus monkeys. The 
CD3-CD20+ cell population decreased on Day 2 in the peripheral blood and then remained at a decreased 
level for the remaining study time points during the dosing phase. By the end of the 90-day recovery 
period on Day 146, B-lymphocytes recovered to 79% and 115% of baseline levels for the 2 mg/kg and 
10 mg/kg dose groups), while only a 53% recovery was observed in the 50 mg/kg dose group.

A measurable decrease in NK cells (CD3-CD20-) was observed at the first post-treatment time point 
for all groups (including the vehicle group) with recovery towards baseline in between treatments. No 
change in absolute counts of T-lymphocytes was observed, the relative percent increase of T-
lymphocytes during dosing was reflective of the concurrent elimination of the B-lymphocytes. 
Evaluation of Effects on Lymphocyte Populations in Peripheral Blood from ‘13-Week Intravenous 
Infusion Toxicity Study in the Cynomolgus Monkey with a 132 Day Recovery Period’ (MOR208P008) 
Changes  in  lymphocyte  subsets  including  T-,  B-,  and  Natural  Killer  (NK)  cells  in  peripheral  blood  of 
cynomolgus monkeys were assessed in response to tafasitamab administered as an i.v. infusion every 
week at dose levels of 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg for 13 weeks with a 132-day recovery (MOR208P008). 
Consistent with slightly reduced lymphocyte counts, a tafasitamab-induced reduction of CD20+ B cells 
was observed at all dose levels in both sexes. There were only minor differences between the dose levels 
and a distinct decrease was observed within the first two weeks of treatment which persisted until the 
end of the treatment period. A gradual recovery of the depleted B cell populations was observed following 
the end of active tafasitamab treatment. By Week 19 of the recovery period, B cell counts reached the 
range of the control group. Consistent with B cell depletion observed in peripheral blood, a reduction in 
B cells in bone marrow, spleen and inguinal lymph nodes was noted in all dose groups. Partial to complete 
recovery was observed at the end of the recovery period. Peripheral CD20+ B cell counts were reduced 
throughout the treatment period. The B cell depletion effect was reversible within the recovery period.

In the ‘8-Week Toxicity Study of XmAb5574 Administered by Intravenous Infusion Every Two Weeks to 
Cynomolgus  Monkeys,  with  a  90-Day  Recovery  Period’  (XC9-14408),  all  the  electrocardiograms  were 
qualitatively and quantitatively interpreted and within normal limits. No arrhythmias were found. All the 
electrocardiograms  evaluated  in  this  study  were  considered  normal  for  cynomolgus  monkeys.  No 
abnormalities in rhythm were found. There were no abnormal electrocardiographic findings attributable 
to the administration of tafasitamab at doses up to 50 mg/kg. 
In the ‘13-Week Intravenous Infusion Toxicity Study in the Cynomolgus Monkey with a 132 Day Recovery 
Period’ 
(MOR208P008)’ 
there  was  no  electrocardiographic  evidence  of  cardiotoxicity  or 
arrhythmogenesis. Minor changes in the individual recordings did not show a trend and are most likely 
explained  by  random  changes  in  the  surface  electrocardiographic  parameters  over  time  and  by  the 
normal  limitations  of  analysis  accuracy.  Evaluation  of  blood  pressure  yielded  normal  variations,  no 
tafasitamab treatment-related effect was observed. The respiratory rates remained within the normal 
limit  of  variation  for  manually  restrained  animals.  There  was  no  tafasitamab-related  effect  on 
neurobehavioral endpoints during the study. Although, statistical analysis revealed significant differences 
when compared to control, the body temperature variation of tafasitamab-treated animals was generally 
in the normal range of variation for this species. 
Tafasitamab treatment at doses up to 100 mg/kg/week (iv) in cynomolgus monkeys had no effect on 
neurobehavioral function, body temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate or electrocardiography. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The  efficacy  of  tafasitamab  in  combination  with  other  anti-cancer  therapeutics  has  been  studied.  No 
other pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
The bioanalytical programme of tafasitamab employed two different platforms, ELISA and ECLA for both 
tafasitamab and antidrug antibodies against tafasitamab. Bioanalytical and antidrug antibody methods 
were validated and qualified when used in non-GLP studies in non-clinical studies. Bioanalytical methods 
used in the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies were validated according to current guidelines under QA 
audit programs and were GLP-compliant. 
For  the  13-week  toxicity  study  the  quantitative  ECLA  bioanalytical  method  and  the  antidrug  antibody 
ECLA method appeared to be robust and well-suited for purpose. Bioanalytical method validation included 
dilution  integrity  and  up  to  one-year  stability  at  both  -20  and  -80˚C.  Free  drug  interference  was 
determined  for  the  anti-tafasitamab  assay.  At  75.0  ng/mL  and  5000  ng/mL  of  cynomolgus  anti-
tafasitamab antibodies, addition of 5 μg/mL and 50 μg/mL of tafasitamab, respectively, still resulted in 
a positive response. 
ISR was evaluated in the 13-week study (MOR208P008). A total of 91.54% of tafasitamab ISR results 
(130  samples)  were  within  the  predefined  acceptance  criteria,  demonstrating  the  accuracy  of  the 
analytical method. 
The bioanalytical ELISA method and the anti-tafasitamab antibody ECLA assay employed in the 8-week 
study  (XC9-14408  conducted  in  2008/2009)  was  validated  in  compliance  with  GLP.  Stability  of 
tafasitamab in serum was demonstrated for more than 500 days at -70˚C. Free drug interference of the 
anti-tafasitamab antibody assay was as follows: At both 60 ng/mL and 2000 ng/mL of anti-tafasitamab 
antibody positive control antibody, the assay tolerates 50.0 μg/mL of tafasitamab and still results in a

positive signal. Addition of 500 μg/mL of tafasitamab results in the signal of both the 60 and 2000 ng/mL 
positive controls dropping below the cut point. 
A  metabolite/degradation  product  without  biological  activity  was  also  captured  by  the  bioanalytical 
methods.  However,  after  a  thorough  investigation,  it  was  concluded  that  the  impact  on  the  general 
pharmacokinetic assessments in non-clinical studies during the dosing phases was limited. 
In  bioanalytical  reporting  of  tafasitamab  serum/plasma  concentrations,  the  unit  of  ng/mL  was  used 
consistently. In pharmacokinetic evaluations, e.g. Cmax was generally reported in µg/mL. 
Single dose studies 
The pharmacokinetics of a single dose of tafasitamab was evaluated in NMRI mice. The dose of 15 mg/kg 
was administered i.v. or i.p. I.p. administration showed almost 100% bioavailability and terminal half-
life of 6.4 hours. This route was used in several in vivo pharmacology studies in SCID mice. No PK studies 
were performed in SCID mice, hence the data obtained in NMRI mice can be considered as a surrogate 
for  proof  of  exposure.  Maximal  plasma  concentration  for  15  mg/kg  i.p.  administration  was  in  the 
neighbourhood of 100 µg/mL. PK after 1 mg/kg i.v. could not be properly evaluated, since 2 out of three 
mice appeared to be dosed extravascular and not intravenous as intended. SCID mice showed effect at 
doses of 1-10 mg/kg i.v. or i.p. twice weekly in pharmacology studies.  
Pharmacokinetics after single dose in monkey was evaluated in three studies at doses in the range of 
0.3 to 10 mg/kg of 1-hour infusion. In the first study (XC9-07907, doses 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg, N=2), 
clearance was slightly higher for the 0.3 mg/kg dose indicating target mediated elimination as expected 
for a monoclonal antibody. ADA induced increased clearance between day 8 and Day 14 in one animal 
in the low and one animal in the high dose. Otherwise the PK was similar for the 1 and 3 mg/kg doses 
with  clearance  of  4.3 to  4.8  mL/day/kg,  respectively.  Vss  of  approximately  50  mL/kg  was  correlating 
with  the  serum  compartment.  Half-life  was  observed  in  the  range  of  7.7  to  9.1  days,  which  is  in  the 
normal range for IgG antibodies in monkeys.    
Toxicokinetics   
XC9-14408: 8 weeks at 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg/2 weeks (4 doses) 
Cynomolgus  monkeys  were  dosed  via  single  1-hour  iv  infusion  at  0  (control)  2,  10  and  50  mg/kg  of 
tafasitamab  every  two  weeks  for  a  total  of  four  doses.  Serum  concentrations  of  tafasitamab  were 
interpreted within the context of the ADA response. Additional whole blood samples were collected for 
determination  of  absolute  counts  of  lymphocyte  subsets  consisting  of  T-cells  (CD3+/CD20-),  B-cells 
(CD3-/CD20+) and NK-cells (CD3-/CD20-). These were compared to tafasitamab serum concentration-
time profiles. See Section of Secondary Pharmacodynamics. 
A strong anti-drug antibody response was observed in this study. This response was greatest at 2 mg/kg 
(8 of 10 animals), less at 10 mg/kg (3 of 10 animals) and at 50 mg/kg (3 of 10 animals). There was a 
relationship between tafasitamab antibody-mediated clearance and decline in tafasitamab concentrations 
and concomitant recovery of B-cells, especially at the low dose. Therefore, several animals were excluded 
from PK analysis. Nevertheless, the number of animals were deemed sufficient for proper PK analysis. 
This is supported. 
Tafasitamab TK exposure parameters (Cmax and AUC0-t) were similar in female and male animals, and 
no obvious gender differences could be determined by comparing serum concentration over time profiles 
in males and females. 
Tafasitamab  TK  exposure  parameters  (Cmax  and  AUC0-56days)  were  proportional  to  dose  based  on 
linear regression in all animals as well as in ADA-negative animals only.

The  clearance  of  tafasitamab  in  ADA-negative  animals  was  consistent  across  dose  levels  and  was 
approximately 5.2 to 5.5 mL/kg/day. Vss was determined between 74 to 124 mL/kg. Terminal elimination 
half-life averaged 10.2, 12.4 and 14.2 days at 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg, respectively. 
MOR208P008: 13 weeks at 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/week (13 doses) 
Plasma concentrations of MOR00208 were below the lower limit of quantification (BLOQ) in all samples 
of animals in Group 1 (control) and at pre-dose on Day 1 for all animals in study groups 2-4. 
Following the first and repeated weekly intravenous infusions of tafasitamab, Cmax of tafasitamab was 
reached (tmax) on average at 1.25 to 3.2 h after start of the 1-hour infusion. Dose normalised Cmax 
and  AUC  were  similar  across  the  dose  range  and  sampling  occasions,  supporting  a  direct  dose  linear 
relationship between the 3 dose levels tested (10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg). Following 4, 7, and 
13  repeated  weekly  administrations  of  tafasitamab,  mean  maximum  concentrations  (Cmax)  and 
exposures  (AUC0-144h)  of  tafasitamab  were  greater  than  those  determined  following  the  first 
administration.  
The mean terminal elimination half-life of tafasitamab, as determined from the recovery phase, were 8.0 
to  17.4  days.  The  mean  terminal  elimination  half-life  over  all  dose  groups  as  determined  from  the 
recovery phase was 12.7 days. The average accumulation ratios over all dose levels were 1.5, 1.7 and 
1.9, for Cmax after 4, 7 and 13 repeated administrations, respectively, and were 1.7, 2.1 and 2.3 for 
AUC0-144h. Thus, steady state can be assumed after the 7th dose (Day 43), expected around 4-5 half-
lives (12.7*5=64 days). 
There was no evidence in the concentration-time profiles to suggest significant anti-tafasitamab antibody 
formation, which is also supported by the anti-tafasitamab antibody assessments. It should however be 
mentioned that the high concentrations of tafasitamab in this study may have interfered with the antidrug 
antibody assay. Nevertheless, there was no signs of increased clearance as a result of antidrug antibody 
development. 
Mean Cmax and AUC0-144h after the 13th dose for animals dosed at 100 mg/kg (NOAEL) were 5220 
μg/mL and 449000 µg/mL*h and 3970 μg/mL and 333000 µg/mL*h for males and females, respectively. 
The sex ratio (male/female) for mean Cmax ranged from 1.1 to 1.4 and, for mean AUC0-144h, ranged 
from  1.1  to  1.4,  i.e.  males  showed  on  average  a  slightly  higher  maximal  plasma  concentration  and 
exposure than females. 
Safety margins of 7.9-fold to patient exposure were calculated based on AUC0-144 h at steady state for 
cynomolgus monkeys and NHL patients. For Cmax, a 9.4-fold higher value was estimated in cynomolgus 
monkeys compared to NHL patients at steady state.     
Distribution 
No dedicated studies have been performed to investigate the in vivo tissue distribution of tafasitamab in 
animals. Tafasitamab exhibited a volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) between 52.6 mL/kg and 
124.3 mL/kg across studies, indicating distribution between plasma volume and extracellular Volume. 
Protein Binding 
No plasma protein binding studies were performed with tafasitamab (see discussion on non-clinical 
aspects).

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The  toxicological  profile  of  tafasitamab  has  been  evaluated  in  non-clinical  studies  in  agreement  with 
relevant guidelines. The toxicity studies were conducted in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), 
as a tafasitamab cross-reactivity study with lymphocytes of various species concluded that the antibody 
recognised CD19 from human and macaques, but not from common laboratory animals such as mouse, 
rat, rabbit or dog (XC9-23209). Therefore, the cynomolgus monkey was selected as the relevant species 
for safety and toxicology assessment of tafasitamab.  
Toxicology  studies  of  tafasitamab  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  include  three  non-GLP  single  dose 
pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic/toxicity studies (XC9-07907, XC9-08007, XC9-05707), and two GLP 
compliant  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies:  an  8-week  study  of  repeated  i.v.  tafasitamab  administration 
every two weeks with a 90-day recovery period (XC9-14408) and a 13-week study of repeated weekly 
i.v.  tafasitamab  administrations  with  a  132-day  recovery  period  (MOR208P008).  Local  tolerance  was 
assessed as a part of the 13-week repeat-dose study (MOR208P008) and no evidence of local irritation 
or other adverse effects was noted at the administration site. Additionally, tissue cross-reactivity studies 
in  tissue  panels  from  healthy  humans  (XC9-17208a)  and  cynomolgus  monkeys  (XC9-17208b)  were 
evaluated  to  identify  possible  target  tissues  for  tafasitamab  binding.  No  studies  on  genotoxicity, 
carcinogenicity or reproduction and developmental toxicity have been conducted.   
All  general  toxicology  studies  performed  used  the  intended  route  for  human  use  (i.e.,  intravenous 
administration via infusion) and included concomitant toxicokinetics (which was assessed in detail in the 
pharmacokinetic section of the assessment report).  
Single-dose toxicity 
Three non-GLP tafasitamab single-dose i.v. infusion studies with doses ranging from 0.3 to 10 mg/kg 
were  conducted  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  (XC9-07907,  XC9-08007,  XC9-05707).  Tafasitamab  caused 
depletion  of  B-lymphocytes  at  all  doses.  At  the  highest  dose  tested  (10  mg/kg),  depletion  of  B-
lymphocytes was observed in peripheral blood, spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow and correlated to 
histopathological findings of reduced germinal centre size with decreased immunohistochemical staining 
for B-cells. Additionally, a transient decrease in NK-cells were noted, which could theoretically have an 
impact on tafasitamab mediated B-cell lysis.   
Tafasitamab was well tolerated within the examined dose range and beside the above-mentioned B-cell 
depletion,  which  is  considered  to  be  within  the  anticipated  pharmacological  effect,  no  adverse  effects 
were  observed.  However,  when  assessing  the  three  single-dose  studies,  it  appears  like  the  studies 
primarily were conducted to estimate dose ranges and to examine pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic 
Assessment report

effects of tafasitamab. Evaluation of toxicity in the single-dose studies seemed more secondary, as the 
selected dose range with a maximum dose of 10 mg/kg (corresponding to a HED of 3.2 mg/kg*), were 
lower than the intended clinical dose of 12 mg/kg. Additionally, systemic exposure measured by Cmax in 
the monkeys was approximately half that observed in humans (294 ± 23.9 μg/mL in monkeys versus 
547.4 μg/mL in humans in the MOR208C201 study). As single dose toxicity studies are not required (as 
per guideline), the lack of any safety margins to the clinical dose is acceptable. However, the observed 
lack of toxicity cannot be reassuring for the clinical setting, as toxicologically relevant exposure has not 
been achieved in these studies. 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
Two GLP compliant tafasitamab repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted in cynomolgus monkeys.  
In the 8-week study (XC9-14408), doses of 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg tafasitamab was administered by i.v. 
infusion once every two weeks for 8 weeks i.e. a total of 4 consecutive doses. A recovery period of 90-
days was included for 2/5 animals of each sex per treatment group. 
Tafasitamab was well tolerated at all doses and the NOAEL were therefore determined to be 50 mg/kg. 
As  an  anticipated  pharmacological  effect,  a  marked  decrease  in  B-lymphocytes  (CD3-CD20+)  in 
peripheral blood were noted at all dose levels and corresponded with histopathological findings of reduced 
cellularity of germinal centres in the spleen. A tendency toward a gender specific increase in incidence, 
severity and splenic weight were seen in males in the 8-week study but was not observed in the 13-
week study. Furthermore, the decrease in absolute and relative splenic weights noted in the terminal 
male animals in the 8-week study, appeared to be driven by an extraordinarily high splenic weight in 
one  of  the  control  males.  The  B-lymphocytes  in  the  peripheral  blood  and  the  splenic  changes  were 
additionally, reversed in most animals at the end of the 90-day recovery period. The onset of the recovery 
in peripheral blood was dose-dependent.  
Findings of decrease in neutrophilic granulocytes and/or platelets were noted in approximately half the 
monkeys in the two highest dose groups (10 and 50 mg/kg). The findings could, however, not be related 
to any other findings (e.g. haemorrhages) or changes in clinical pathology parameters.  In the second 
repeat-dose toxicity study (MOR208P008), dose of 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg tafasitamab was administered 
by i.v. infusion to sexually mature male and female cynomolgus monkeys once weekly for 13 weeks. A 
recovery period of 19 weeks was included for two males and two females from each group to evaluate 
the reversibility of the findings. The 13-week repeat-dose toxicity study was performed with clinical trial 
material (test article) from the commercial formulation (40 mg/mL of tafasitamab, 25mM citrate buffer, 
200mM trehalose and 0.02% (w/v) polysorbate 20 at pH 6.0). Therefore, the local tolerance assessment 
included in this study is considered supportive for the commercial formulation.    
No  adverse  effects  were  noted,  and  the  NOAEL  was  determined  to  be  100  mg/kg  (the  highest  dose 
tested). However, findings of anticipated pharmacological effect were observed and correlated well with 
the findings from the previous repeat-dose study. A decreased peripheral CD20+ B-lymphocyte count at 
all dose levels indicated according to the applicant a complete CD19-saturation even at the lowest dose 
tested (10 mg/kg). The findings correlated with reduced IgG concentration in serum and a reduction in 
primary and secondary antibody response to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) and tetanus toxoid (TT) 
respectively, in an assessment of the T-cell dependent antibody response (TDAR). Additionally, the effect 
of tafasitamab on B-cells was seen histopathologically as a decrease in cellularity of germinal centres in 
lymphoid follicles in spleen and lymph nodes in all dose group with no clear dose-dependency and varying 
frequency between groups. Recovery of all B-cell related changes were observed during the treatment 
free recovery period.             
Assessment report

The effect of tafasitamab on reproductive endpoints (i.e. effect on menstrual length and histopathology 
of male and female reproductive organs), revealed no changes in the monkeys under the conditions of 
the current study.  
The clinical treatment regimen of tafasitamab changes throughout the treatment period, with the first 
three cycles being administered once weekly (except for cycle 1, where infusions are administered on 
day 1, 4, 8, 15 and 22 of the cycle), followed by the cycle 4 with treatments every two weeks. The 13-
week study (MOR208P008) were in line with the ICH S9 requirements of a study of minimum 3 months 
duration  following  the  intended  clinical  treatment  schedule,  which  in  this  case  is  once  weekly  for  the 
majority of times in the first 3 cycles. The treatment schedule of the 8-week study (XC9-14408) was 
more aligned with cycle 4 treatments (every second week). 
Slight tremor occurred occasionally in some animals of all treatment groups including controls and severe 
body tremor was find in one animal in the high dose group.   
In both repeat-dose studies and in the single-dose studies an effect of NK-cells was noted, as a transient 
decrease.     
In the 8-week repeat-dose study (XC9-14408), an antidrug antibody response was seen in 8/10 animals 
at 2 mg/kg, 3/10 animals at 10 mg/kg, and 3/10 animals at 50 mg/kg and the findings had an impact 
on the determination of toxicokinetic parameters in these animals. In contrast, in the 13-week repeat-
dose  study  (MOR208P008),  no  anti-tafasitamab  antibodies  were  formed.  Further  elaboration  on  the 
observed difference in ADA formation between the 8-week repeat-dose study (XC9-14408) and the 13-
week repeat-dose study (MOR208P008) was presented.  
Interspecies comparison 
The choice of the cynomolgus monkeys as the relevant species for toxicity testing is supported based on 
the  argumentation  that  no  antibody  binding  was  noted  to  lymphocytes  in  other  common  laboratory 
animal species. It is therefore supported that no studies were conducted in rodents, and this is also in 
line with ICH S6(R1) and the 3R’s.  
When comparing animal to human exposure for the determined NOAEL values, safety margins based on 
AUC values revealed 9.77 to 10.24-fold for the 8-week study and 15.18 to 20.46-fold for the 13 week 
repeat-dose study.   
Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity 
The omission of genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies was acceptable according to ICH S6(R1) and S9, 
respectively.  
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No  reproductive  or  developmental  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  for  tafasitamab.  No  changes  were 
noted  by  histopathological  examination  of  the  male  or  female  reproductive  system  in  the  13-week 
repeat-dose study (MOR208P008).  
Other toxicity studies 
Tissue cross-reactivity studies were conducted in respectively a human (XC9-17208a) and a cynomolgus 
monkey tissue panel (XC9-17208b), in order to assess potential tissue cross-reactivity. In both studies, 
a positive staining pattern was noted in lymphocytes in the blood, hematopoietic B-cell precursors in the 
bone  marrow  and  in  several  tissues,  however,  always  in  association  to  mononuclear  leukocytes  and 
lymphocytes. Positive mononuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes were confirmed to be B-cells based on 
their  morphology  and/or  location  (e.g.  intravascular  or  perivascular  migrating).  Reduced  staining 
intensity were noted in the cynomolgus tissue compared to the human tissue, which is reflected in the 
Assessment report

more  disseminated  staining  pattern  of  mononuclear  leukocytes/lymphocytes  observed  in  the  human 
tissue panel.  
In conclusion, a positive staining pattern were located to cells with B-lymphocyte morphology as 
expected and no unexpected tissue cross-reactivity were detected in any of the two studies. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A justification for not providing a full ERA was submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Tafasitamab  was  shown  to  provide  full  saturation  of  CD19  expressed  in  HEK  cells  at  14  µg/mL. 
Tafasitamab is selective for human and monkey CD19 as shown by flow cytometry of PBMCs from various 
species. Only weak or no binding was observed in dog, rabbit or mouse lymphocytes. Hence, the monkey 
is qualified as non-clinical testing species. 
Tafasitamab is designed to elicit enhanced binding to Fc gamma receptors. Similar binding was shown 
for human and monkey, however increased binding compared to native IgG in mouse was also shown 
confirming  the  mouse  as  a  valid  model  for  in  vivo  pharmacology  testing  of  tafasitamab  treatment  of 
human lymphomas. 
Tafasitamab act in cell killing through several mechanisms, namely ADCC, ADCP and direct cytotoxicity, 
however not through CDC as is the case with e.g. rituximab. 
Tafasitamab alone was shown to be efficient in several lymphoma model in the SCID mice. This effect 
could be increased when administered in combination with lenalidomide also in the SCID mice model. 
Hence, non-clinical in vitro and in vivo proof of concept of tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide 
for the treatment of lymphomas appear established.  
The pharmacological effect was also characterised in vivo in the monkey in the single dose PK studies 
and the repeat-dose toxicology studies in monkeys. The duration of B-cell depletion was dose dependent, 
however doses down to 2 mg/kg provided immediate depletion of B-cells. It could have been of support 
of clinical dose setting, if the rich data sets on PK and PD endpoints were used for quantitative PKPD 
modelling. However, a dose-exposure-response analysis has been done post-hoc on clinical data. 
As  is  acceptable  for  monoclonal  antibodies,  the  safety  pharmacology  programme  was  included  in  the 
pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies. No findings of concern were observed. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics in mice was evaluated in NMRI mice and can be used as surrogate for proof of exposure 
in the SCID mice models. However, only single dose data was presented, and no modelling of repeat-
dose exposure was attempted. This could have provided some sort of reassurance of similarity to human 
exposure. 
Three single dose studies were presented in monkeys. All in all, pharmacokinetic parameters fell out as 
expected for a monoclonal antibody in monkeys with half-lives in the range of 7.7 to 9.1 days.  
Toxicokinetics  were  thoroughly  evaluated  in  both  the  8-  and  13-weeks  studies.  The  8-week  study 
suffered  from  several  monkeys  developing  antidrug  antibodies  responsible  for  increased  clearance  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/426468/2021  
Page 39/141 
 
 
 
tafasitamab. However, data were still sufficient for proper toxicokinetic evaluation and the results were 
overall in correlation with toxicokinetics in the 13-weeks study. 
There was no evidence in the concentration-time profiles to suggest significant anti-tafasitamab antibody 
formation  in  the  13-weeks  study,  which  was  also  supported  by  the  anti-tafasitamab  antibody 
assessments. It should however be mentioned that the higher concentrations of tafasitamab in this study 
may have interfered with the antidrug antibody assay. In this study both the level of the high dose and 
the frequency of dosing was doubled compared to the 8-weeks study. Nevertheless, there was no signs 
of increased clearance as a result of antidrug antibody development. The incidence of antidrug antibodies 
in patients was low. Safety margins of 7.9 and 9.4-fold based on steady state AUC0-144h and Cmax was 
presented. 
It  should  be  noted  that  half-life  is  longer  in  the  repeat-dose  studies  as  compared  to  the  single  dose 
studies  in  monkeys.  This  was  also  observed  in  humans,  however  to  even  more  extreme  extent  as 
clearance decreased from 0.41 to 0.19 L/day in patients over a period of two years (SmPC section 5.2). 
Finally,  a  critical  issue  of  deamidation  of  tafasitamab  both  as  a  degradant  and  a  metabolite  was 
investigated from a bioanalytical point of view. The deamidated tafasitamab is not biologically active, 
but was captured by the ECLA method, hence a bioactivity assay had to be developed. It was concluded 
that  during  the  dosing  phases,  there  were no  difference  between  the  two  assays.  The  difference  was 
however evident in the recovery phase. A PK model was developed based on the obtained data and used 
for simulating the impact on human PK. In the next round of assessment, a clear justification regarding 
the deamidation of tafasitamab and its potential impact on safety and efficacy was provided.  
Toxicology 
The  toxicological  profile  of  tafasitamab  was  characterised  in  three  non-GLP  single-dose  studies  (XC9-
07907,  XC9-08007,  XC9-05707),  in  an  8-week  repeat-dose  study  with  biweekly  i.v.  infusions  (XC9-
14408) and in a 13-week repeat-dose study with weekly i.v. infusions (MOR208P008). The studies were 
all conducted in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), due to lack of tafasitamab antibody binding 
to lymphocytes in other common laboratory animal species.  
In  general,  tafasitamab  was  well  tolerated  in  single-dose  studies  up  to  10  mg/kg  and  in  repeat-dose 
studies up to 100 mg/kg, supporting the NOAEL of 100 mg/kg determined based on the 13-week repeat-
dose study. Except for an anticipated pharmacological effect on B-lymphocytes, no adverse effects were 
noted. Sufficient safety margins of 9.77 to 20.46-fold to clinical exposure were seen for the NOAELs from 
the repeat-dose toxicity studies, whereas, no safety margins existed for the single-dose studies. As single 
dose toxicity studies are not required (per guideline), the lack of any safety margins to the clinical dose 
is  acceptable.  However,  the  observed  lack  of  toxicity  cannot  be  reassuring  for  the  clinical  setting,  as 
toxicologically relevant exposure has not been achieved in these studies.      
B-cell depletion was seen at all doses tested, even at the lowest single-dose of 0.3 mg/kg. At higher 
doses, B-cell depletion was observed in peripheral blood, spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow in both 
single-dose  and  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies.  The  findings  correlated  to  histopathological  evidence  of 
reduced cellularity in the germinal centres and decreased immunohistochemical staining of B-cells. The 
findings  of  B-cell  depletion  were,  however,  reversible  in  most  animals  within the  predefined  recovery 
periods.   
A concern was raised on the observations of slight tremor occurring occasionally in some animals of all 
treatment groups including controls in addition to severe body tremor detected in one animal in the high 
dose group. A justification concerning the potential mechanism of action of tafasitamab explaining the 
slight tremor was provided. Overall, the effect was judged to be related to infusion procedure and thus 
not tafasitamab-related.  
Assessment report  
EMA/426468/2021

Transient reduction in NK-cells were detected in both the single-dose and the repeat-dose studies and 
appeared to be linked to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated B-cell depletion due 
to degranulation and apoptosis of NK-cells or margination/re-localisation to tumour site. However, the 
effect of the transient reduction in NK-cells is considered to be limited, as B-cell counts in cynomolgus 
monkeys remain fully depleted under tafasitamab exposure and only recover upon withdrawal.    
Additionally, a reduction in IgG concentration in serum and in primary and secondary antibody response 
to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) and tetanus toxoid (TT) respectively, were observed in the 13-
week repeat-dose study and correlated with the above findings of B-lymphocyte depletion. Significant 
antidrug-antibody (ADA) formation were noted in the 8-week repeat-dose study, which was in contrast 
to findings in the 13-week repeat-dose study. A discussion of the issue was provided but no clear reason 
was  identified.  However,  as  no  treatment-related  or  treatment  boosted  ADAs  were  noted  following 
tafasitamab administration in humans, the issue will not be further pursued.  
As tafasitamab is a monoclonal antibody, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies have not been 
conducted, since such tests are not relevant for this molecule in the proposed indication.  
No studies were performed to evaluate the genotoxicity/carcinogenicity of tafasitamab, according to ICH 
S6(R1)  and  S9  guideline.  However,  a  total  of  three  cases  of  secondary  primary  malignancies  were 
reported in L-MIND study and the applicant was asked to further discuss the mechanisms underlying the 
carcinogenic potential of the drug in relation to its pharmacological properties and a possible potentiation 
of lenalidomide effects. A comparison with rituximab was provided, which is considered acceptable due 
to the similar mode of action to deplete B-cells via ADCC and ADCP. Based on available rituximab data, 
no increased risk for SPMs induced by tafasitamab was expected.   
Further, for lenalidomide an increased risk of secondary primary malignancies (SPMs) has been described 
and included in section 4.4 of the SmPC of lenalidomide. It is known that, patients with lymphoma which 
are treated by DNA damaging agents, genetic predisposed, exposed to environmental factors or stem 
cell transplantations are at high-risk for developing SPM.  
Reproductive  and developmental  toxicity  studies  as well  as  specific  studies  to evaluate  the  effects on 
fertility have not been conducted with tafasitamab. Waiving stand-alone reproductive and developmental 
toxicity studies for the current indication of tafasitamab treatment in combination with the teratogenic 
drug Lenalidomide, was supported in accordance with the CHMP scientific advice.  
This is considered acceptable for the present indication with treatment in combination with Lenalidomide, 
a drug known to be teratogenic or causing embryo-fetal lethality. 
Moreover, no adverse effects on reproductive organs in males and females and no effects on menstrual 
cycle length in females were observed in the 13-week repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys 
by histopathological examination of the male or female reproductive system (study MOR208P008).  
The absence of reproductive and developmental toxicity studies was in accordance with a scientific advice 
given by CHMP in January 2017. For the present application, the absence of a developmental toxicity 
study  in  the  pharmacologically-relevant  non-human  primates  appears  as  reasonable  taking  into 
consideration notably the patient population being mostly beyond reproductive age (median age of 71-
72 years in the supportive clinical studies), the co-administration with lenalidomide during the first 12 
cycles, and measures proposed to avoid pregnancy in woman of childbearing potential (contraception 
during treatment and up to 3 months after cessation of treatment). This opinion will be revised in case 
of  a  future  extension  of  indication  inducing  a  significant  increase  in  the  proportion  of  women  of 
childbearing potential elective to treatment with tafasitamab.   
Based on its mechanism of action and on nonclinical and clinical data publicly available with other CD19- 
or  CD20-targeting  drugs,  treatment-related  immunotoxicity  cannot  be  excluded  in  neonates  after  in

utero exposure to tafasitamab (namely B-cell depletion). This potential risk should be reported in the 
SPC to inform the prescriber and provide risk management measures. A statement in SPC 4.6 with cross-
reference to SPC 4.4 is suggested, e.g.: “In case of exposure during pregnancy, depletion of B-cells may 
be expected in newborns due to the pharmacological properties of the product. Consequently, newborns 
should be monitored for B-cell depletion and vaccinations with live virus vaccines should be postponed 
until the infant’s B-cell count has recovered (see section 4.4)”.  
No unexpected tissue cross-reactivity of tafasitamab were observed and positive staining was noted in 
lymphocytes in the blood, hematopoietic B-cell precursors in the bone marrow and in several tissues, 
however, always in association to cells with B-lymphocyte morphology. Good compliance in the staining 
pattern were noted between human and monkey tissue. 
Tafasitamab has shown to be highly specific to the CD19 antigen on B cells. Toxicity studies following 
intravenous  administration  to  cynomolgus  monkeys  have  shown  no  other  effect  than  the  expected 
pharmacological depletion of B-cells in peripheral blood and in lymphoid tissues. These changes reversed 
after cessation of treatment (see SmPC section 5.3). 
The  applicant  has  submitted  an  ERA,  including  a  justification  for  not  providing  a  full  ERA  which  is 
acceptable on the basis of an exemption in line with EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 Rev. 1;  Tafasitamab as 
a monoclonal antibody is readily biodegradable and therefore, it is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment.

The non-clinical studies performed were adequate for the type of product and intended use. All relevant 
information is included in section 5.3. of the SmPC. Data reveal no special hazards for humans. 
As  for  the  present  indication  treatment  is  in  combination  with  Lenalidomide,  a  drug  known  to  be 
teratogenic or causing embryo-fetal lethality, relevant warnings have been on prevention of pregnancy

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacology of tafasitamab (PK and PD) was investigated in 5 clinical studies in patients diagnosed 
with  different  B-cell  malignancies.  Based  on  multiple  dosing  and  sparse  PK  sampling,  an  integrated 
population PK analysis was performed with results from clinical studies XmAb5574-01 (n=27 subjects), 
MOR208C201 (n=91), MOR208C202 (n=22) and MOR208C203 (L-MIND, n=81). Accordingly, data from 
221 subjects with either R/R CLL/SLL, R/R NHL (including DLBCL), or R/R ALL were included in the pop 
PK analysis. The analysis was conducted on a data base containing 3972 measurable PK observations.  
No dedicated human PK studies were performed for tafasitamab. 
During the development programme, weekly (or q2w or q4w) doses of tafasitamab from 0.3 mg/kg to 
12 mg/kg have been administered to patients with varying age, body weight, sex, disease type, tumour 
size, B-cell counts etc. The effect of renal or hepatic impairment was not formally tested in dedicated 
clinical trials.

Assays and bioanalysis 
Three types of immune assays were employed throughout the clinical development for quantification of 
tafasitamab. The first-generation PK assay (used in Phase I trial XmAb5574-01) was an enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay. The second-generation assay was based on electrochemiluminescence technology 
and more specific (use in studies L-MIND; COSMOS, MOR208C201 and MOR208C202). The third assay 
was used in COSMOS and could detect “bioactive” tafasitamab capable of binding to CD19. 
Deamidation of asparagine to aspartate and to a lower extent glutamine are common post translation 
protein modifications. Non-enzymatic deamidation at Asp33 hinders binding of tafasitamab to its target 
CD19. Re-analysis of samples indicated that serum values of “bioactive” tafasitamab were lower with up 
to 40% (see below figure). 
Figure 12:  Mean tafasitamab concentration vs time profiles in COSMOS  
None  of  the  validation  stability  studies  accounted  for  deamidation  which  for  tafasitamab  leads  to 
deactivation. The process is favoured by elevated temperatures as well as by pH shifts to alkaline and is 
a function of time. From a drug quality perspective, the deamidation process is considered adequately 
controlled. A forced biodegradation study suggests that at least 20% deamidation occur ex vivo during 
sample preparation and analysis. Interference caused by deamidation of tafasitamab on evaluation of 
ADAs is expected to be minor. The exact exposure level of tafasitamab is not critical for clinical efficacy. 
Several tafasitamab formulation/process versions were tested in the clinical trials (CMC1 to CMC4). The 
pivotal  study  L-MIND  (or  MOR208C203)  was  conducted  using  CMC2  and  CMC4  tafasitamab  material. 
Physico-chemical  comparability  of  CMC2  and  CMC4  drug  product  have  been  demonstrated  and 
deamidation degradation kinetics were similar for CMC2 and CMC4. 
Three generation ADA assays were used for detection of anti-bodies to tafasitamab. The 1st generation 
assay was used for Study XmAb5574-01. The 2nd generation assay based on electrochemiluminescence 
was used for studies COSMOS, MOR208C201 and MOR208C202. Drug interference testing showed that 
2500 ng/mL ADA could be detected in presence of 100 µg/mL drug, and 40 ng/mL ADA could be detected 
in presence of 5 µg/mL drug. In a later validation, 5000 ng/mL ADA could be detected in presence of 
100  µg/mL  drug.  The  3rd  generation  assay  used  in  L-MIND  had  drug  tolerance  determined  using  2 
different  positive  controls  (i.e.  a  monoclonal  and  a  polyclonal  positive  control)  where  ≥  1000  µg/mL 
tafasitamab  did  not  interfere  to detect  100  ng/mL  of  an  idiotypic  monoclonal  mouse  anti-tafasitamab 
control antibody. Presence of more than 120 µg/mL tafasitamab interfered with detecting 100 ng /mL of 
polyclonal  cynomolgus  monkey-derived  anti-tafasitamab  antibodies.  In  general,  the  level  of  drug 
tolerance in the ADA assays might not be sufficient to cover the expected drug concentrations in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/426468/2021  
Page 45/141 
 
 
 
 
ADA  samples  for  detection  of  at  least  100  ng/mL  ADA.  In  L-MIND,  ADA  samples  were  collected  with 
tafasitamab trough levels up to 394 μg/mL. In combination with idelalisib (COSMOS), tafasitamab trough 
concentrations have been observed up to 450 µg/mL.  
Population PK analysis 
The PK of tafasitamab was described by non-compartmental analysis and by population PK analysis. The 
Pop  PK  model  for  tafasitamab  was  a  2-compartment  linear  disposition  model  with  time-dependent 
clearance and with inter-individual variability on CL, V, CL2 and V2 described by exponential error models 
and a mix ratio error model for the residuals. The final Pop PK model included data from 4 clinical trials, 
XmAb5574-01  (Phase  1 dose  escalation trial  in  subjects  with  CLL/SLL,  N=27 subjects),  MOR208C201 
(Phase II trial in subjects with NHL, N=92 subjects [N=91 in the PK population]), MOR208C202 (Phase 
II trial in subjects with ALL, N=22 subjects), and MOR208C203/L-MIND (Phase II trial in subjects with 
DLBCL, N=81 subjects). Statistically significant covariates were body weight, serum albumin, sex, and 
indication. The estimated typical value for the initial terminal elimination half-life was 16.9 days. The 
final model was qualified using prediction-corrected VPCs, GoF plots and bootstrap analysis.

1000 bootstrap runs were used to display covariate-induced changes of the PK parameters or of relevant 
exposure  metrics.  Covariate  effects  were  moderate  in  size  for  exposure  (p5-p95  of  the  respective 
covariate range caused a change of < ±50% of the derived exposure parameter).

underpredicted the observed concentrations in both treatment arms.

Absorption  
No  clinical  studies  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  bioavailability  (BA)  or  bioequivalence  (BE)  of 
tafasitamab as the product is administered intravenously which is 100% bioavailable. 
Based  on  the  population  PK  analysis,  tafasitamab  average  serum  trough  concentrations  (±standard 
deviation) were determined at 179 (±53) μg/mL during weekly IV administrations at 12 mg/kg including

an additional dose at Day 4 of Cycle 1 in combination with LEN (MOR208C203/L-MIND). During bi-weekly 
administrations from Cycle 4 onwards average trough serum concentrations of 153 (±68) μg/mL were 
determined. The simulated mean Cmax of tafasitamab in trial L-MIND was determined at 483 (±109) 
mg/L. The simulated mean Cmax at 12 mg/kg across studies was 467 mg/L.  
Distribution 
Volume  of  distribution  was  examined  in  study  XmAb5574-01  in  patients  with  R/R  CLL  or  SLL.  Mean 
central Vd was 121.8 mL/kg at steady state (Vss) corresponding to approximately 8 L in a 70 kg subject. 
In the pop PK analysis, the estimated typical Vd was 9.32 L, very much like the result in XmAb5574-01.  
No study on protein binding has been conducted. 
Elimination 
The terminal half-life (t1/2) was determined to be 16.9 days in the pop PK analysis. Initial drug clearance 
(CL) was 0.41 L/day whereas the calculated clearance after 700 days (i.e. ~2 years, the approximate 
maximum PK observation period in clinical trial MOR208C203/L-MIND) was 0.19 L/day. 
Metabolism 
As tafasitamab is a monoclonal antibody, no dedicated in vitro drug metabolism study was performed. 
The primary elimination pathways for mAbs like tafasitamab are degradation by the reticulo-endothelial 
system (like endogenous IgG) or by target-mediated elimination. Metabolites are amino acids and small 
peptides that are recycled into the protein metabolism.  
Excretion 
The routes of excretion have not been investigated in detail. It is not expected that this protein should 
be eliminated differently than other proteins. 
Bioavailability and Bioequivalence 
No  clinical  studies  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  bioavailability  (BA)  or  bioequivalence  (BE)  of 
tafasitamab as the product is administered intravenously which is 100% bioavailable. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The PK of tafasitamab in the therapeutic dose range is linear in the dose range from 3 to 12 mg/kg. The 
correlation between dose and exposure is depicted below.

Time dependency 
In the pop PK analysis, the calculated clearance after 700 days (i.e. ~2 years, the approximate maximum 
PK observation period in clinical trial MOR208C203/L-MIND) was 0.19 L/day. This is half the value of the 
calculated  initial  clearance  suggesting  a  time  dependent  change  in  the  clearance  beyond  300  days  of 
treatment. A decrease in clearance over time has been reported for several other monoclonal antibodies 
as well.     
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Inter-individual  variability was  estimated  for  Cl,  inter-compartmental  clearance  (Cl2),  central  Vd,  and 
peripheral  Vd  in  the  final  pop  PK  model.  The  interindividual  variability  in  the  selected  PK  parameters 
estimated in the final pop PK model varied between 19% and 70%.  
Special populations 
Impaired renal and hepatic function 
No dedicated studies on the impact of renal or hepatic impairment have been conducted. The pop PK 
analysis did not indicate any impact of creatinine clearance in the interval 34 to 299 mL/min or of hepatic 
function (AST (10-472 U/L), ALT (6-336 U/L), ALKP (42-773 U/L), GGT (7-936 U/L)) on the systemic 
exposure of tafasitamab.  
Gender 
As expected, the volume of distribution was slightly lower in women; however, this was not translated 
into an overall difference in clearance based on gender.   
Race 
Race and ethnicity could not be formally tested as covariates. For race, the large majority of data was 
derived from “White” (91.4%) subjects; for ethnicity the large majority of data was “Not Hispanic/Latino” 
(52.0%) or ”Missing” (46.6%). Since the route of administration of tafasitamab is IV and the metabolism 
is expected to be like other proteins, race or ethnicity is not expected to influence the PK of the drug 
product. 
Weight 
As determined by stepwise covariate model building, body weight at baseline (WTB) was found to have 
a significant effect on CL and V. Extremes of WT (range: 40.4-163 kg, as observed in the dataset) were 
associated with a change in clearance from -42% to +91% compared to a subject with median WTB. 
However, body weight had no clinically relevant effect on the systemic exposure of tafasitamab.

Effect of albumin 
Baseline albumin (ALB) was found to be a statistically significant covariate (inverse correlation with CL) 
and was incorporated in the final pop PK model. Extremes of ALB (range: 23-51 g/L, as observed in the 
dataset) were associated with a change in CL from +82% to -23% compared to a subject with median 
ALB levels. However, albumin had no clinically relevant effect on the systemic exposure of tafasitamab.   
Immunogenicity 
A  formal  assessment  of  ADA-positive  vs  ADA-negative  subjects  as  covariate  within  the  Population  PK 
study  was  not  feasible  due  to  the  low  number  of  ADA-positive  subjects.  Thus,  to  test  for  a  possible 
influence of ADA on tafasitamab PK, individual concentration-time profiles of ADA positive subjects were 
graphically compared to the range of individual concentrations of all subjects by study and dose level. 
No neutralising Abs were detected in the L-MIND study.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
As tafasitamab does not undergo extensive hepatic metabolism or renal excretion, no dedicated in vitro 
and clinical drug-drug interaction studies were performed. However, the potential impact of lenalidomide 
on the PK of tafasitamab was evaluated during covariate analysis of the population PK analysis and no 
effect of concomitant administration of lenalidomide on tafasitamab PK was detected.  
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
N/A 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Tafasitamab is an Fc-enhanced humanised monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the human B-cell 
specific cell surface antigen of the B-cell receptor, CD19. The major pharmacological effect of tafasitamab 
is  B-cell  depletion.  CD19  is  expressed  throughout  normal  and  malignant  B-cell  development  up  to 
terminal plasma cell differentiation and is present on the surface of malignant hematopoietic cells. Thus, 
CD19 represents an important therapeutic target for the treatment of B-cell malignancies. Alteration of 
Assessment report  
EMA/426468/2021

two amino acid residues in the constant region of tafasitamab significantly increases binding to Fc gamma 
receptors (FcγR), including FcγRIIIa (CD16) and FcγRII (CD32), leading to enhanced in vitro antibody-
dependent  cell-mediated  cytotoxicity  ADCC),  antibody-dependent  cell-mediated  phagocytosis  (ADCP), 
and direct cytotoxic effects (apoptosis) on tumour cells relative to the unmodified antibody. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The  primary  pharmacodynamic  endpoint  was  change  from  baseline in  B-cell  count.  Assessment  of  an 
exposure-efficacy relationship was conducted using PFS or ORR as efficacy parameters, while treatment 
emergent adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were used for the assessment of an exposure-safety 
relationship.   
B-lymphocyte depletion 
Results  for  pharmacodynamic  B-cell  depletion  during  tafasitamab  treatment  for  five  clinical  studies, 
XmAb5574-01, MOR208C201, MOR208C202, MOR208C203/L-MIND, and MOR208C205, were analysed 
and the data presented in MOR208L038. In all studies, tafasitamab treatment led to a strong reduction 
in  peripheral  B-cells.  An  overview  on  onset  of  depletion  and  time  to  reach  the  nadir  of  the  relative 
reduction is given below. 
Table 11: Summary of peripheral B-cell counts of clinical studies analysed  
Based on an evaluation of eight patients who achieved a response but  relapsed early, there is no 
indication that monitoring of peripheral B-cell counts (or NK cell counts) could be used to detect an 
early relapse.

Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Exposure-response relationship for clinical efficacy 
In order to evaluate a potential exposure-response relationship for clinical efficacy of tafasitamab, data 
from  three  different  clinical  studies  were  analysed  independently  (XmAb5574-01,  MOR208C201  and 
MOR208C203/L-MIND)  (MOR208L035).  The  studies included  subjects  with  R/R  DLBCL  (i.e.  the  target 
indication  –  studies  MOR208C201,  N=28  and  MOR208C203/L-MIND,  N=81)  but  also  with  other  NHL 
subtypes (MOR208C201, total N=64) or R/R CLL/ SLL (study XmAb5574-01, N=27). 
An exposure-response relationship for clinical efficacy was observed for tafasitamab monotherapy clinical 
studies XmAb5574-01 (subjects with R/R CLL/SLL) and MOR208C201 (subjects with R/R NHL/DLBCL). 
Within these monotherapy studies, higher exposure to tafasitamab resulted in increased best ORRs and 
prolonged  median  PFS.  However,  in  combination  with  LEN  (MOR208C203/L-MIND),  tafasitamab 
exhibited a flat exposure-response relationship for ORR and PFS, whereas ORRs increased almost two-
fold  compared  to  tafasitamab  in  monotherapy  (XmAb5574-01  and  MOR208C201).  Based  on  these 
results, increasing exposure to tafasitamab is unlikely to result in higher response rates when used in 
combination with LEN.

(Q1W)  to  every  other  week  dosing  (Q2W)  in  study  MOR208C203/L-MIND,  the  exposure  parameter 
Ctrough was selected to quantify the decrease in exposure and tested as predictor for PFS. Switching the 
dosing  frequency  of  tafasitamab  in  combination  with  LEN  from  initially  Q1W  to  Q2W,  after  three 
treatment cycles, as implemented in MOR208C203/L-MIND, had no pronounced effect on PFS. 
Exposure-response relationship for clinical safety 
In order to evaluate a potential exposure-response relationship for safety, AEs were analysed against 
tafasitamab exposure for R/R NHL patients (study MOR208C201, including R/R DLBCL patients) and R/R 
DLBCL patients (MOR208C203, L-MIND). In both studies, all patients were treated at the dose level of 
12  mg/kg  tafasitamab  (monotherapy  in  MOR208C201  and  in  combination  with  LEN  in  MOR208C203). 
The tafasitamab exposure metrics AUC0-28 and Cmax were derived by simulation for each patient from a 
pop  PK  model.  The  individual  exposure  metrics  were  separated  into  exposure  quartiles  and  analysed 
against TEAEs, each AESI and neutropenia ≥Grade 3.

Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
For most TEAEs of special interest, there was no evidence of increasing risk with increasing exposure. 
For MOR208C201 (tafasitamab monotherapy in subjects with R/R NHL/DLBCL), there was an apparent 
exposure-response  relationship  for  non-allergic  rash/skin  reactions  leading  to  increased  numbers  for 
increasing AUC28 values; however, this was not observed for patients with DLBCL. For MOR208C203 (L-
MIND, tafasitamab in combination with LEN in subjects with R/R DLBCL), an apparent exposure-response 
relationship  was  observed  for  anaphylactic  reaction,  tumour  flare  reaction,  non-allergic  rash/skin 
reactions, diarrhoea, and neutropenia. However, the increase in OR with increasing exposure quartiles 
for these TEAEs was moderate, and numbers of patients per exposure quartiles were low. For several 
TEAEs, also an apparent lower risk was observed with increasing exposure. In summary, there was no 
obvious increase in TEAEs with increasing tafasitamab exposure as determined by AUC0-28 and Cmax.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The present MAA concerns tafasitamab, a humanised monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin (Ig) 
G1 subclass directed against the CD19 receptor which is expressed throughout normal and malignant B-
cell development up to terminal plasma cells. Tafasitamab is developed for treatment of adult patients 
with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), first in combination with lenalidomide, 
then followed by monotherapy.     
The pharmacology of tafasitamab (PK and PD) was investigated in 5 clinical studies in patients suffering 
from different B-cell malignancies. Due to the PD effect of the substance no dedicated human PK studies 
in healthy subjects were performed. The effect of renal or hepatic impairment was not formally tested in 
dedicated clinical trials, and no interaction studies has been undertaken. Based on data from four studies, 
an integrated population PK analysis on 3972 PK observations from 221 subjects with either R/R CLL/SLL, 
R/R NHL (including DLBCL), or R/R ALL was performed.

Quantification of tafasitamab was conducted using 3 different validated immunoassays. The validations 
and bioanalysis were overall acceptable with some exceptions: Two analytical methods were used for 
quantification  without  cross-validation.  Several  formulations  were  applied  during  clinical  development 
(CMC1 to CMC4). The bioanalytical reports for COSMOS will be provided when finalised as recommended 
by the CHMP.  
The absorption, distribution, biotransformation and elimination were documented based on a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Based on an analysis of tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide, tafasitamab average serum trough 
concentrations (± standard deviation) were 179 (± 53) μg/mL during weekly (plus an additional dose 
on day 4 of cycle 1) intravenous administrations of 12 mg/kg. During administration every 14 days from 
cycle  4  onwards,  average  trough  serum  concentrations  were  153  (±  68) μg/mL.  Overall  maximum 
tafasitamab serum concentrations were 483 (± 109) μg/mL. 
The total volume of distribution for tafasitamab was 9.3 L. 
The exact pathway through which tafasitamab is metabolised has not been characterised. As a human 
IgG monoclonal antibody, tafasitamab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids 
via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. 
The clearance of tafasitamab was 0.41 L/day and terminal elimination half-life was 16.9 days. Following 
long-term observations, tafasitamab clearance was found to decrease over time to 0.19 L/day after two 
years. 
In order to evaluate the influence of ADAs on tafasitamab PK, individual concentration-time profiles of 
ADA positive subjects were graphically compared with ADA negative subjects (all data from the 12 mg/kg 
cohorts). This evaluation did not indicate any clinically meaningful difference in exposure between ADA 
positive  and  negative  subjects.  Anti-drug-antibodies  were  evaluated  using  3  different  ADA  assays  for 
screening. The applicant will further develop the drug tolerance of the 3rd generation ADA assay with 
the objective to improve the method by excluding drug interference at trough levels observed in COSMOS 
-  recommended  by  the  CHMP.  Further,  the  applicant  will  provide  the  final  bioanalytical  reports  for 
pharmacokinetic (PK) and anti-drug antibody (ADA) sample analysis of COSMOS after trial completion. 
The Pop PK of tafasitamab could be described by a 2-compartment linear disposition model with time-
dependent clearance and inter-individual variability on CL, V, CL2 and V2. Significant covariates were 
body  weight  on  both  clearance  and  central  volume,  serum  albumin  (inverse  correlation  with  CL),  sex 
(lower V in females), and indication (subjects with NHL or ALL had a lower V than subjects with CLL/SLL). 
However, the magnitude of the effects caused by these covariates is not considered clinically relevant. 
The applicant will update the Pop PK model post-approval to include final data from COSMOS and submit 
the results as per the recommendation of the CHMP.   
The PK of tafasitamab in the therapeutic dose range is linear.  
Weight and s-albumin were found to have a significant effect on Vd and/or CL but no clinically relevant 
effects on the systemic exposure of tafasitamab was demonstrated.  
The ADA incidence was highest in study XmAb5574-01. The applicant has no plausible explanation for 
the relatively high incidence of pre-existing ADAs in this study (not further pursued).  
Based on the available data, no dose adjustment is required in the special populations included in the 
pharmacology programme.  
B-cell depletion was used as a PD marker of biological effect of tafasitamab.  In all five studies in the 
clinical pharmacology programme, tafasitamab treatment led to a major reduction in peripheral B-cell 
counts.  
Assessment report  
EMA/426468/2021  
Page 63/141 
 
 
 
AUC0-28 was the main exposure parameter for the exposure-efficacy analyses in the L-MIND study. The 
study  demonstrated  a  flat  exposure-response  relationship  and  therefore  increasing  exposure  to 
tafasitamab is unlikely to result in higher response rates when used in combination with LEN.    
No indication of an overall exposure-safety relationship has been observed for AUC0-28 and Cmax. For 
some  TEAEs,  an  exposure  relationship  could  be  suspected  but  the  subject  numbers  are  small  and 
therefore firm conclusions cannot be drawn. 
Age,  body  weight,  sex,  tumour  size,  disease  type,  B-cell  or  absolute  lymphocyte  counts,  anti-drug 
antibodies,  lactate  dehydrogenase  and  serum  albumin  levels  had  no  relevant  effect  on  the 
pharmacokinetics  of  tafasitamab.  The  influence  of  race  and  ethnicity  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
tafasitamab is unknown (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
The effect of renal impairment was not formally tested in dedicated clinical trials; however, no clinically 
meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of tafasitamab were observed for mild to moderate renal 
impairment  (creatinine  clearance  (CrCL)  ≥ 30  and  < 90 mL/min  estimated  by  the  Cockcroft-Gault 
equation).  The  effect  of  severe  renal  impairment  to  end-stage  renal  disease  (CrCL  < 30 mL/min)  is 
unknown (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
The effect of hepatic impairment was not formally tested in dedicated clinical trials; however no clinically 
meaningful  differences  in  the  pharmacokinetics  of  tafasitamab  were  observed  for  mild  hepatic 
impairment (total bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > ULN, 
or total bilirubin 1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST). The effect of moderate to severe hepatic impairment 
(total bilirubin > 1.5 times ULN and any AST) is unknown. 
Non-enzymatic  deamidation  at  asparagine  33  in  the  light  chain  of  tafasitamab  hinders  binding  of 
tafasitamab to its target CD19. Non-clinical mechanistic studies have indicated this process occur in the 
drug material and in vivo and in vitro. Physico-chemical comparability of CMC2 and CMC4 drug product 
have been demonstrated and deamidation degradation kinetics were similar for CMC2 and CMC4 (see 
SmPC section 5.2). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  clinical  pharmacology  programme  package  is  considered  adequate  and  the  proposed  dosing  of 
tafasitamab appears appropriate.  
The  applicant  accepted  a  recommendation  from  the  CHMP  to  submit  additional  results  post-approval 
when COSMOS is finalised. The applicant is asked to improve drug tolerance of the 3rd generation ADA 
assay. 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
• 
The  final  bioanalytical  reports  for  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  and  anti-drug  antibody  (ADA) 
sample analysis of COSMOS after trial completion.  
The current tafasitamab population PK model by including COSMOS PK data after finalisation 
of  the  clinical  trial.  The  applicant  will  submit  all  COSMOS  reports  (including  the  updated 
Assessment report

Population-PK  report  as  well  as  the  corresponding  bioanalytical  reports  for  PK  and  ADA 
sample analysis. 
• 
further develop the drug tolerance of the 3rd generation ADA assay with the objective to 
improve the method by excluding drug interference at trough levels observed in COSMOS. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
One phase 1 dose escalation study has been performed in 27 patients with R/R CLL/SLL (XmAB5574-
01). This was the first-in-human (FIH) trial with tafasitamab which was administered intravenously (IV) 
as monotherapy at doses ranging from 0.3 to 12 mg/kg for up to seven 28-day cycles.  
A  total  of  27  male  and  female  subjects  aged  40  to  84  years  old  were  enrolled  in  six  cohorts  of 
tafasitamab: 0.3 mg/kg (n=1), 1 mg/kg (n=1), 3 mg/kg (n=3), 6 mg/kg (n=3), 9 mg/kg (n=3) and 12 
mg/kg (n=16). 
Tafasitamab was administered as a 2-hour intravenous (IV) infusion in Cycle 1 on Day 1, 4, 8, 15, and 
22, and in Cycle 2 on Day 1, 8, 15, and 22, with a total of 9 doses of tafasitamab over two 28-day cycles 
of therapy. In the optional extended therapy phase for subjects in the 12 mg/kg cohort, 8 subjects could 
receive an additional 4 administrations as a single infusion every 28 days (Day 1 of Cycles 4, 5, 6, and 
7)  for  an  additional  20  weeks  at  the  same  dose  level.  The  primary  objectives  were  to  identify  the 
maximum  tolerated  dose (MTD)  and/or  recommended  dose(s)  (RD)  of  tafasitamab  for  further  clinical 
studies; to characterize the safety and tolerability profile of IV dosing of tafasitamab; and to characterize 
the PK, PD, and immunogenicity of IV dosing of tafasitamab. 
The dose-response study showed no benefit at the 3 mg/kg or below, objective responses were seen in 
the 6, 9, and 12 mg/kg cohorts. PR was noted in 1 patient in each of the 6 and 9 mg/kg cohort. Due to 
the acceptable safety profile of the highest administered dose, 12 mg/kg, this cohort was expanded to 
a total of 16 patients. In the 12 mg/kg cohort, tafasitamab showed preliminary antitumour efficacy with 
an ORR of 37.5%, the best response was PR, and no patients experienced CR in any of the dose groups. 
Disease progression rate was lower in the 12 mg/kg cohort. The longest TTP and PFS were seen for the 
12 mg/kg cohort. (Please see PK section for further details.) The 12 mg/kg dose level was considered 
the optimal dose and was used in future studies. From an overall view, the selected dose is acceptable. 
The applicant acquired the rights to tafasitamab in 2010 and initiated two Phase 2 open-label studies 
investigating  tafasitamab  monotherapy  in  R/R  B-cell  NHL  (MOR208C201)  and  in  R/R  B-cell  ALL 
(MOR208C202). 
2.5.2.  Main study(ies)

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was ORR, defined as the proportion of complete and partial 
responders (ORR = CR + PR), as assessed by Independent Radiology/Clinical Review Committee (IRC). 
Secondary Endpoints: 
•  Disease control rate, defined as the proportion of patients having CR or PR or SD (DCR= ORR 
+ SD);

response and the first time point where a change in response was detailed (specifically, the 
duration of CRs or PRs until progression or relapse was evaluated); 
•  Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time between first study drug dosing and 
tumour progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first; 
•  Time to progression (TTP), defined as the time from first study drug dosing until time of 
progression (the only events of interest are limited to disease progression and death from 
lymphoma - death from other causes were not considered in relation to the TTP evaluation); 
•  Overall survival (OS), defined as time from first study drug dosing to the date of death;

Disease response assessments were made according to the revised response criteria based on the 
guidelines of the International Working Group (IWG) reported by Cheson et al. 2007. 
Sample size 
The  protocol  states  that  “for  the  determination  of  a  suitable  sample  size,  it  is  assumed  that  the 
combination treatment could improve the ORR from a value of 20% (under monotherapy) to 35% (under 
combination therapy).” A sample size of 80 subjects would be sufficient to show with 85 % power that 
the combination treatment could improve the ORR from a value of 20% (under monotherapy) to 35% 
(under combination therapy). A dropout rate of 10 % was included.   
Randomisation 
Not applicable; this was a single arm study 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable; This was a single arm study. 
Statistical methods 
For  the  analysis  of  efficacy  and  baseline  characteristics,  the  full  analysis  set  (FAS)  was  the  primary 
population. The FAS included all patients who received at least one dose of tafasitamab and at least one 
dose of LEN.  
The Per protocol set (PPS) included all patients in the FAS who did not have any major protocol deviations 
that could confound the interpretation of the primary analyses conducted on the FAS. The PPS included 
all patients in the FAS who had received at least one dose of tafasitamab and LEN, and underwent at 
least one post-baseline response assessment. 
The  primary  efficacy  variable,  ORR,  CR  +  PR:  The  number  and  percentage  of  patients  classified  as 
having best objective response of CR or PR as well as 95% confidence limits (using the Clopper-Pearson 
exact method) were presented. Patients with no post-baseline assessment of response or not evaluable 
were included as non-responders. No formal hypothesis testing was conducted.  
Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary Endpoint was analysed using best ORR based on the INV assessment 
(FAS), best ORR based on the PPS (based on INV and IRC assessment) and best ORR excluding patients 
with  no  post-baseline  assessment  of  response  or  with  all  post-baseline  assessments  categorised  as 
“Unknown”. The analysis was performed using the FAS based on both IRC and INV assessment. 
Secondary  endpoints:  The  same  statistical  methods  as  for  the  primary  endpoint  were  used.  The 
distribution of PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method. The median PFS time along 
with 95% confidence intervals, the 25th and 75th percentiles is presented (Brookmeyer and Crowley 
1982). 
Sensitivity  analyses:  The  main  analysis  will  be  conducted  on  the  PPS,  based  on  the  INV  response 
assessment  as  entered  on  the  ‘Lymphoma  Tumour  Assessment’  eCRF  page.  The  analysis  will  be 
conducted using both the FAS and the PPS. Patients having more than one missed visit, but having an 
available  death  date,  will  be  included  in  the  time-to-event  analysis  and  considered  as  having  a  PFS 
event. The analysis will be performed on the FAS for both IRC and INV response assessment.

Initial data cut-off was 30 Nov 2018. The applicant also provided an addendum with data cut-off as of 
30 November 2019.   
In total, 56 sites in 10 countries (Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, 
Spain, United Kingdom and United States) were activated for enrolment, out of which 14 sites did not 
screen any patients; 42 sites screened patients; 35 sites enrolled patients. 
Conduct of the study 
Changes in the Protocol 
The  original  protocol  submitted  to  the  Ethics  Committee/Health  Authorities  was  protocol  version  3.0 
(dated 18 Mar 2015). As of 30 Nov 2018, protocol version 3.0 had been amended three times. A summary 
of main changes for each amendment is shown below. 
In  Amendment  #  1  dated  27  May  2015  the  dosing  schedule  was  changed  to  bi-weekly  tafasitamab 
administration from Cycle 4. Patient inclusion /exclusion criteria were updated as follows: patients with 
evidence  of  histological  transformation  to  DLBCL  from  indolent  NHL  were  included.  Biopsied  material 
which was ≤ 3 years old was accepted for the purpose of the study. Exclusion criterion was re-worded 
allowing DLBCL transformed from indolent NHL into the study. The duration time free from disease (of 
prior malignancies) was increased from ≥ 3 years to ≥ 5 years prior to screening. The collection of ECG 
RR intervals was added as were needed for QTc calculations.   
In  Amendment  #  2  dated  27  Jun  2016  The  target  patient  population/inclusion  criteria  were  updated. 
This amendment allowed up to three prior lines for DLBCL treatment (previously two prior lines). Detailed 
description of DLBCL histologies that could qualify for the study was added. Upper age limit for study 
entry (80 years) was removed based on feedback from several initiated sites. Fresh tumour tissues for 
central pathology review was specified. The lesion must be positive on PET scan (based on Juweid et al., 
2007). The definition of primary refractory DLBCL was revised, (less than a PR to first-line therapy or 
progression within 6 months from completion of first-line therapy) and removed the need to have DLBCL 
relapse/progression after at least 3 months from completion of prior CD20 containing therapy.  
In Amendment # 3 dated 23 Oct 2017 the treatment with tafasitamab was extended beyond Cycle 24 
until  progression  because  the  previous  version  of  the  protocol  allowed  an  extended  treatment  with 
tafasitamab for patients with an ongoing response of CR or PR for 24 cycles. In view of limited treatment 
options available for treatment of relapsed/refractory DLBCL, an option of continuing with tafasitamab 
treatment beyond Cycle 24 and until disease progression (or unacceptable toxicity) was provided in this 
protocol  amendment,  based  on  the  decision  of  the treating  investigator.  The  imaging  frequency  after 
Cycle 24 while on treatment with tafasitamab was changed to once per year, either CT or MRI, followed 
by PET at the investigator’s discretion. More frequent scans were not recommended as per standard of 
care. Disease assessment by CT/MRI during additional treatment phase.  
The CSR was addended 13 Mar 2020, to provide efficacy analyses based on the data cut-off 30 Nov 2019 
as well as additional statistical analyses, please refer to the statistical section.

Numbers analysed 
Table 20: Analysis populations (all patients enrolled) 
One patient was initially excluded since this patient only received tafasitamab. After the submission of 
the MAA, the applicant detected an error in the adjudication of the central response assessment by the 
Independent Review Committee (IRC) for one patient (Study MOR208C203), for which the comment of 
the adjudicating radiologist did not match the selection of the best response by the Adjudicator. Upon 
detection of these discrepancies, the applicant reviewed and reconciled the data in the efficacy analysis.

Sensitivity Analysis for Primary Endpoint (IRC Evaluation) 
For the PPS (N=70), the best objective response per IRC was CR for 33 (47.1%) patients and PR for 13 
(18.6%) patients. Based on these data, the best ORR was 65.7% (95% CI: 53.4, 76.7). Eleven (15.7%) 
patients had SD as their best ORR and 13 (18.6%) patients had a PD.  
Table 23 Table 24: Concordance between IRC and Investigator Evaluations for the Primary 
Endpoint Best Objective Response Rate  
The efficacy results as of data cut off of 30.11.2019 based on patients who had their DLBCL diagnosis 
confirmed by central pathology were updated. The comparison of efficacy results between DLBCL as per 
investigator  assessment  vs.  centrally  confirmed  DLBCL  showed,  that  estimates  for  all  endpoints  were 
somewhat lower in respect of the centrally confirmed DLBCL. Best ORR were 57.5% (95% IC: 45.9, 68.5) 
and 54.3% (95% IC: 41.9, 66.3), CR were 40% (95% IC:  29.2, 51.6) and 35.7% (95% IC: 24.6, 48.1), 
median PFS were 12.1 months (95% IC: 6.3, NR) and 9.1 months (95% IC: 4.7, NR), median OS were 
31.6 months (95% IC: 18.3, NR) and 26.4 months (95% IC: 14.9, NR), respectively in the DLBCL as per 
investigator  assessment  compared  with  the  centrally  confirmed  DLBCL.  The  median  DOR  were  34.6 
months in both set of patients.

As of data cut-off 30-NOV-2019, 8 patients were censored due to other reasons than being ongoing on 
DoR follow-up. Of these, 6 patients were censored since they had initiated a new anti-tumour therapy, 
3 of which due to progressive disease. Two patients were censored due to an event after two or more 
missing  tumour  response  assessments,  one  patient  suffered  from  general  deterioration  and  one  had

Figure 23: Kaplan Meier analysis of PFS (IRC evaluation) SAF 
A supplementary analysis, imputing the censored patients, based on data as of the 30-NOV 2019 cut-
off, was performed. The sensitivity analyses showed a 12-months PFS rate of 43.1% (for FAS 43.6%) 
when  based  on  IRC,  and  44.3%  (for  FAS  44.9%),  when  based  on  INV,  this  is  considered  clinical 
meaningful.  
Secondary endpoints – OS 
Median follow-up time for OS was 31.8 months (95% CI: 27.2, 35.9). Overall 38 (46.9) deaths occurred 
and 43 (53.1) patients were censored in the OS analysis. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for the median OS 
was 31.6 months (95% CI: 18.3, NR). The figure below shows that the probability of survival decreased 
gradually until 18 months and remained stable after 18 months. The Kaplan-Meier probability estimate 
of OS at 12 months was 72.8 (95% CI: 61.3, 81.3), 62.0 (95% CI: 50.1, 71.8) at 18 months, 56.4 (95% 
CI: 44.5, 66.8) at 24 months, and 46.1 (95% CI: 33.2, 58.0) at 36 months.

Study MOR208C201 and Study MOR208C206 (RE-MIND).  
Study MOR208C201, an open-label, multicenter, phase IIa study of single-agent tafasitamab 
evaluating efficacy, safety, PK, and PD of tafasitamab in adult patients with different subtypes 
of  relapsed  or  refractory  Non-Hodgkin  lymphoma,  who  have  received  at  least  one  prior 
therapy containing rituximab (RTX) as one of the treatments.  
The study employed a 2-stage design, where the decision to further enrol any NHL subtype in Stage 2 
depended on best responses after 2 or 3 cycles in Stage 1. In both stages, tafasitamab was administered 
via IV infusion at a dose of 12.0 mg/kg weekly for 8 weeks (2 treatment Cycles). Patients with at least 
SD after 8 weeks continued with weekly tafasitamab administration for 4 additional weeks (i.e., up to 
12 weeks, 3 treatment cycles). Patients with an ongoing response of at least PR at the end of Cycle 3 
(regardless of Stage 1 or  2) were eligible to receive further study drug until progression, either once 
every two or four weeks, based on investigator’s decision. In Stage 1, 51 patients in total from 4 NHL 
subtypes were enrolled: 14 FL, 14 DLBCL, 12 MCL and 11 other indolent NHLs (MZL, mucosa associated 
lymphoid tissue [MALT] lymphoma, etc.).  In Stage 2, an additional 21 DLBCL and 20 FL patients (41 
patients total) were enrolled. The DLBCL cohort (N=35) was similar to patients treated in the pivotal L-
MIND study. 
Only results of R/R DLBCL population are described here. 
Assessment of the antitumour activity was the primary objective, secondary objectives were DoR, safety, 
tolerability, PK/PD and potential immunogenicity. Endpoints were ORR (CR + PR), DoR, PFS, TTP and SD 
rate. 
Of  the  35/41  patients  who  received  tafasitamab,  10  patients  discontinued  from  the  study  prior  to 
completion of the 2 cycles, mainly due to PD (5 [50.0%]), and death (3 [30.0%]).  The ORR was 6/35 
(17.1%) for patients with R/R DLBCL, 8.6% achieved CR and 8.6% achieved PR. The results indicate a 
benefit  in  terms  of  ORR,  but  since  this  is  a  very  small  and  uncontrolled  study,  it  is  regarded  as 
exploratory. 
Study  MOR208C206  (RE-MIND),  a  multicenter,  observational,  retrospective  study  of  the 
efficacy of lenalidomide monotherapy in adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. 
The objective of the study was to characterize the effectiveness of LEN monotherapy in the treatment of 
R/R DLBCL patients and to compare the effectiveness of LEN monotherapy with the efficacy outcomes 
with  tafasitamab-LEN  combination  therapy.  Efficacy  endpoints  were  similar  to  the  tafasitamab-LEN 
combination  study,  MOR208C203  (L-MIND):  ORR  (CR+PR)  –  primary  endpoint,  secondary  endpoints 
being:  OS,  CR,  DCR,  DoR,  PFS,  TTNT  and  EFS.  The  same  eligibility  criteria  as  in  L-MIND  study  were 
applied to the observational cohort with respect to the histological subtypes, number of prior therapy 
lines,  prior  therapy  types  allowed,  and  ineligibility  to  receive  ASCT.  There  were  however  certain 
differences between the 2 protocols:

• 
In  view  of  the  comparable  response  noted  in  several  primary  refractory  patients  in  the 
MOR208C203 (L-MIND) cohort (as against the non-primary refractory patients), this exclusion 
criterion  was  not  applied  in  the  MOR208C206  (RE-MIND)  study.  A  comparable  distribution  of 
primary refractory patients between the tafasitamab + LEN and the LEN monotherapy cohorts 
was ensured by having primary refractoriness (yes vs. no) as a baseline covariate for ePS-based 
matching.

ECOG score of 0-2 at baseline, was not a prerequisite for the LEN monotherapy study.  
Pre-specified laboratory values on bone marrow -, kidney - or liver function, hepatitis serology 
testing was not pre-specified in the LEN monotherapy study.   
Patients were matched using a propensity score approach with following variables: Age (as categorical 
variable with subgroups < 70 vs. ≥70 years of age); Ann Arbor Stage I/II vs. III/IV; Refractoriness to 
last  therapy  line  (Yes  vs.  No);  Number  of  prior  lines  of  therapy  (1  vs.  2/3);  History  of  primary 
refractoriness (Yes vs. No); Prior ASCT (Yes vs No); Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; LDH > upper 
limit of normal [ULN] vs. LDH ≤ upper limit of normal [ULN]); Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count 
[ANC] < 1.5 x 109/L vs. ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L); Anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] <10 g/dL vs. Hb ≥10 g/dL). 
For estimates of efficacy, patients from the two treatment cohorts were considered as independent sets. 
As such, analyses for unpaired data were conducted. However, matched data are not independent and 
analysis methods for paired (correlated) data were also included as sensitivity analyses. 
Various analysis populations for the comparative analysis were defined based on the patient’s follow-up 
time, LEN starting dose, and cohort balancing approach to address potential selection bias. The primary 
analysis set was the Matched Analysis Set (MAS25).

Table 34: Patient Disposition (MAS25) - MOR208C206 
In total, 76 patients were matched (1:1) to L-MIND patients. While some baseline characteristics are 
similar between groups (age, refractoriness to last prior therapy), others are very different. For the IPI 
Score: 52.6 % of patients in tafasitamab+LEN (L-MIND) have an IPI Score 0-2 and 21.1 % in LEN-mono 
(RE-MIND). For ECOG, 38.2 % of patients in tafasitamab+LEN (L-MIND) have ECOG 0 compared with 
6.6  %  in  LEN-mono  (RE-MIND).  Further  10  %  of  the  patients  in  RE-MIND  study  have  missing  ECOG 
value. Both ECOG and IPI score are of vital importance for the response and prognosis in DLBCL. 
The comparison of ORR in RE-MIND indicated that best ORR was 51 patients (95 % CI 55.4; 77.5) and 
26 patients (95 % CI 23.7;46.0) for tafasitamab+LEN (L-MIND) and LEN-mono (RE-MIND) respectively, 
odds  ratio being  1.96 ( 95 % CI 1.37;3.04). The proportions were compared using Fisher exact test 
(p-value  =  <0.0001).  The  McNemar  test  was  used  as  sensitivity  analysis  and  provided  concordant 
results. The median DoR was 20.5 months (95 % CI 3.3; 13.9) and 4.1 months (95 % CI 1.5;5.2) for 
tafasitamab+LEN (L-MIND) and LEN-mono (RE-MIND) respectively. The median PFS was 12.1 months 
(95 % CI 5.9; NR) and 4.0 months (95 % CI 3.1;7.4) for tafasitamab+LEN (L-MIND) and LEN-mono 
(RE-MIND) respectively. The median OS (Kaplan-Meier estimate) was NR (95% CI: 15.5, NR) months in 
the  tafasitamab  +  LEN  (L-MIND)  and  9.4  (95%  CI:  5.1,  20.0)  months  in  the  LEN  monotherapy  (RE-
MIND). 
The response assessment in the L-MIND and the RE-MIND study was not similar. A validation study was 
performed  to  compare  the  physician’s  response  assessment  to  those  made  by  an  IRC.  The  overall 
concordance for individual categories is around 56 and 65 %. Most differences were observed in the CR 
category. 
The heterogeneity in the study populations in the tafasitamab+LEN (L-MIND) and LEN-mono (RE-MIND), 
the uncertainties in the matching, and differences in standard of care received during treatment hampers

the interpretation of the results.  Therefore, the results of the RE-MIND study can only be regarded as 
exploratory.   
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Three clinical studies were submitted within the dossier to demonstrate efficacy of tafasitamab + LEN in 
the R/R DLBCL setting in patients being ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).  
Study MOR208C203 (L MIND) is considered the pivotal study. The primary clinical study report with data 
cut-off 30 Nov 2018 was updated as of 30 Nov 2019 and a correction was added 28 July 2020.  
The  other  submitted  studies;  MOR208C201  is  considered  supportive,  while  the  retrospective  registry 
study MOR208C206 (RE-MIND) is considered exploratory.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  pivotal  study  MOR208C203  (L-MIND)  is  a  phase  2,  single-arm,  open-label,  multicentre  study  of 
tafasitamab + LEN, followed by tafasitamab monotherapy until progression in patients with R/R DLBCL 
who  were  not  eligible  for  HDC/ASCT.  Treatment  options  for  HDC/ASCT  ineligible  patients  who  have 
relapsed or progressed after first-line treatment DLBCL are limited, the prognosis is dismal, and there is 
no  consensus  or  guidelines  regarding  the  optimal  treatment.  Several  regimens  have  been  introduced 
including  monotherapy  lenalidomide,  but  usually  treatment  is  administered  in  combination  with  a 
monoclonal  antibody.  The  combination  of  a  CD19  targeted  monoclonal  antibody  in  combination  with 
antineoplastic therapy is therefore in principle endorsed.  
Study L-MIND had a double objective, (i) induction phase with the MOR208C203 + LEN combination plus 
(ii) maintenance phase with tafasitamab monotherapy on the basis of a very small amount of immature 
data. Although the study design comprises a combination treatment phase (tafasitamab + lenalidomide) 
and a monotherapy phase (tafasitamab only), the applicant confirmed that there was no plan for separate 
assessment  of  the  two  phases.  The  primary  endpoint  is  assessed  at  any  time  across  both  treatment 
phases. Consequently, the sample size and corresponding study power were determined for the entire 
treatment period, i.e. not separately for combination and monotherapy phases. This is acceptable. 
The initial claimed indication for tafasitamab is “in combination with lenalidomide followed by tafasitamab 
monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with R/R DLBCL, including DLBCL arising from low grade 
lymphoma,  who  are  not  eligible  for,  or  refuse,  autologous  stem  cell  transplant  (ASCT).”  The  primary 
reason that patients were not candidates to ASCT included high age (46.3%), refractoriness to salvage 
chemotherapy  (22.5%),  comorbidities  (13.8%),  and  refusal  of  high  dose  chemotherapy  (16.3%).  Of 
those who refused ASCT, only 4 had no comorbidities and refused due to personal reasons. Moreover, 
there is a lack of objectivity to consider the subgroup of patients who are eligible to transplant but who 
refuse and thus a selection bias cannot be excluded, especially in the context of a single arm trial. Finally, 
this would mean that tafasitamab would be indicated for patients with R/R DLBCL regardless of eligibility 
to transplant. The term “or refuse” has therefore been deleted from the indication, and number of subjects 
who refused ASCT has been added in the SmPC.  
Tafasitamab was administered together with lenalidomide for up to 12 cycles via IV infusion five times 
per 28 days in cycle 1, fourth times per 28 days from cycles 2 to 3 and bi-weekly thereafter. Lenalidomide 
(25mg) was orally and daily taken from D1-21 of each cycle of 28 days. After cycle 12, tafasitamab was 
administered in monotherapy until disease progression. 
Assessment report

The primary objective was to assess the activity of the combination of lenalidomide and tafasitamab in 
terms of ORR. Secondary endpoints for efficacy were DCR, DoR, PFS, TTP, OS and TNT. The selected 
objective/endpoints are considered acceptable. 
The aim of the study is mainly exploratory as no formal statistical hypothesis testing was performed. 
The combination therapy was assumed to improve the ORR of lenalidomide from a value of 20% (under 
monotherapy)  to  35%  (under  combination  therapy).  Analysis  aimed  at  excluding  a  32%  ORR  was 
assumed  to  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  outcome  was  statistically  superior  to  outcomes  observed 
previously for the monotherapy. 
Inconsistencies  of  the  data  in  relation  to  response  evaluation,  evaluation  of  the  biopsy  material  and 
whether the patients fulfil the inclusion criteria were adequately addressed. An adjudication of central 
response  assessment  and inclusion of  patients  with unknown  or  missing  histology  has  been  reviewed 
and comments were reconciled; the error on adjudication, has adequately been corrected and resulted 
in  a  minor  change  of  the  efficacy  endpoints  of  the  L-MIND  study,  which  did  not  impact  the  overall 
interpretation of the study results.   
Several  protocol  amendments  (inclusion/exclusion  criteria,  objectives/endpoints…)  were  performed 
during the study, a detailed description of which was provided. The protocol amendments do not indicate 
a  significant  impact  to  the  main  analysis  methods.  A  GCP  issue  at  a  UK  site  has  adequately  been 
addressed.   
The histology of the enrolled patients, whether some patients having missing or unknown histology, and 
trial eligibility was questioned. As per protocol, all patients were included in the study based on local 
pathology  diagnosis  of  DLBCL.  A  central  pathology  review  was  implemented  as  a  mandatory  but 
retrospective assessment. As per central pathology review, 10 patients could not be classified as DLBCL. 
In total, 70 out of 80 patients (87.5%) in the primary efficacy analysis set (Full Analysis Set, FAS) and 
71  out  of  81  patients  (87.7%)  in  the  safety  analysis  set  (SAF)  were  centrally  confirmed  as  DLBCL. 
Nevertheless  the  ITT  principle  in  analysing  the  results  and  the  criteria  for  enrolment  in  Study 
MOR208C203 (L-MIND) are considered to be appropriate for the proposed indication.  
The sample size determination has been conducted using various possible monotherapy and combination 
effect ORR rates and various power assumptions. The applicant confirmed that the number of patients 
enrolled  was  determined  for  the  entire  treatment  period.  Enrolment  numbers  were  not  planned 
separately for the combination treatment phase (tafasitamab + lenalidomide) and monotherapy phase 
(tafasitamab only). This approach is consistent with the primary endpoint being measured at any time 
over the whole study period. The applicant provided 4 references (Wiernik 2008, Witzig 2011, Wang 
2013, MOR208C201 study), which are said to be the basis for sample size determination. The protocol 
states that “for the determination of a suitable sample size, it is assumed that the combination treatment 
could improve the ORR from a value of 20% (under monotherapy) to 35% (under combination therapy).” 
This  reference  ORR  value of  20%  under  monotherapy  is  lower  than  the  ORR  observed  in  the  largest 
study with lenalidomide monotherapy (Witzig 2011, n=108) provided by the applicant as the data source 
for sample size assumptions. The Witzig 2011 study reported an ORR of 28%. The applicant provided 
Wiernik  2008  as  another  reference  for  lenalidomide  monotherapy,  with  a  reported  ORR  of  19%. 
Therefore, this initial protocol assumption of a 20% ORR under monotherapy treatment is not deemed 
to be an accurate monotherapy estimate. Of note, this observation tends to be confirmed by the higher 
response rate reported with lenalidomide monotherapy in the RE-MIND study. 
The sample size determination has been conducted using various possible monotherapy and combination 
effect ORR rates and various power assumptions. The number of patients enrolled was determined for

the  entire  treatment  period.  Enrolment  numbers  were  not  planned  separately  for  the  combination 
treatment  phase  (tafasitamab  +  lenalidomide)  and  monotherapy  phase  (tafasitamab  only).  This 
approach  is  consistent  with  the  primary  endpoint  being  measured  at  any  time  over  the  whole  study 
period.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total number of 81 patients were enrolled in the trial, 1 patient received only tafasitamab monotherapy. 
The  definition  of  the  main  analysis  set  (FAS)  includes  all  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of 
tafasitamab and lenalidomide. This definition was not endorsed by the CHMP, the ITT population including 
all randomised 81 patients was used as denominator for the efficacy results and has adequately been 
reflected.  
Overall, the median age of the enrolled population was 72.0 years old, and the majority (71.3%, 57/80) 
were ≥65 years of age. The patients were pre-treated with a median of 2 prior therapies (range 1-4). 
This is considered in line with the claimed indication. Population were balanced in terms of risks as 50% 
presented an IPI score 0-2 and the other 50% presented an IPI score 3 -5. Overall, 15 (18.8%) patients 
were primary refractory.   
In the single arm study of tafasitamab + LEN, it was considered difficult to isolate the treatment effect 
of tafasitamab. The retrospective, observational study of lenalidomide monotherapy, the MOR208C206 
(RE-MIND) study, is considered exploratory, as a result of heterogeneity in the study populations, the 
uncertainties in the matching, and differences in standard of care received during treatment. Some of 
these drawbacks were also pointed out in the scientific advice received by the applicant in June 2019, 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/341711/2019). The applicant further addressed these concerns on the basis of the 
mechanism of action of tafasitamab and lenalidomide. The scientific hypothesis of combining tafasitamab 
and lenalidomide is based on pre-clinical models. Lenalidomide activates NK cells and promotes NK cell 
proliferation, ADCC which is a major mode of action of tafasitamab is predominantly mediated by NK 
cells. LEN is therefore hypothesised to provide tafasitamab with a larger and more potent NK cell pool 
for  ADCC-mediated  tumour  cell  killing  (Horton  et  al,  2008;  Awan  et  al,  2010,  Haslett  et  al.,  2003; 
Galustian et al., 2009; Gribben et al, 2015; Pan et al, 2012; Saloura and Grivas, 2010; Wiernik, 2013) 
(see also Non-Clinical Pharmacology).  
The  applicant  also  reviewed  the  literature  on  the  clinical  effect  of  monotherapy  tafasitamab  and 
lenalidomide  respectively.  Single-agent  tafasitamab  in  a  small  cohort  of  35  patients,  median  age  71 
years  (range  35-90)  with  R/R  DLBCL  in  study  MOR208C201,  showed  an  ORR  of  26%  (95%  CI  12.5, 
43.3), 2 patients (6%) achieving CR. The median DoR was 20.1 months (95% CI: 1.1, NR). Single-agent 
lenalidomide has been used in several studies, prospective as well as retrospective, in patients with R/R 
DLBCL,  showing  ORR  in the  range of  19-29.4%,  and  a  CR  rate  in  the  range of  7-23.5%(Witzig et  al, 
2011; Wiernik et al, 2008; Czuczman et al, 2017; Hernandez-Ilizaliturri et al, 2011; Broccoli et al, 2019). 
The median DoR ranged between 5-17 months, the median PFS ranged between 2.6-6 months and the 
median OS ranged between approximately 7-14 months. Thus, the activity of both tafasitamab – and 
lenalidomide monotherapy in R/R DLBCL is rather modest.  
Although not directly comparable, the effect in the L-MIND trial, of the combination of tafasitamab +LEN, 
show a better outcome in respect of an ORR of 56.8%, a CR rate of 39.5% and a median DoR of 34.6 
months  for  the  ITT  population,  which  has  been  accepted  by  the  CHMP.  The  L-MIND  study  indicate  a 
synergistic effect of the combination tafasitamab + LEN, which is considered encouraging and clinical 
meaningful considering the dismal prognosis of this specific setting of R/R DLBCL. The design of the L-
MIND study, and the objective of continuing tafasitamab monotherapy until progression to maintain the 
treatment response in patients with CR or PR as long as possible, is also considered clinically meaningful.

From the primary analysis, it was not quite clear, how many patients that were censored, who were not 
on-going with treatment at data cut-off in the analysis for DoR, this has been adequately clarified by the 
applicant. As of data cut-off 30-NOV-2019, 8 patients were censored due to other reasons than being 
ongoing on DoR follow-up. Of these, 6 patients were censored since they had initiated a new anti-tumour 
therapy, 3 of which due to progressive disease. Two patients were censored due to an event after two 
or more missing tumour response assessments, one patient suffered from general deterioration and one 
had grade 4 thrombocytopenia. The applicant performed sensitivity analyses for IRC-DoR as requested: 
events were imputed for patients discontinuing DoR follow-up without documented progressive disease, 
administration of new anti-lymphoma therapy before disease progression, and death or progression after 
two  or  more  missing  tumour  response  assessments.  The  sensitivity  analyses  for  IRC-DOR  showed  a 
median DoR of 26.5 months (17,8;NR) which although shorter is considered clinical meaningful.  
Median duration of response was not reached in complete responders (95% CI: 43.9; not reached) and 
was 5.6 months in patients with partial response as best response. However, as these results are based 
on a small number of patients, further confirmation is needed through a post authorisation study. 
Further  clarification  was  provided  about  the  median  PFS  results  obtained  in  the  primary  analysis 
compared to the updated analysis. The reason for the change in median PFS is a prolonged PFS follow-
up time due to an extended study duration of additional 12 months for the updated analysis (cut-off of 
30-NOV-2019) as compared to the Primary Analysis (cut-off of 30-NOV-2018) resulting in more mature 
data  for  the  time-dependent  endpoints  including  PFS.  Moreover,  the  concordance  between  the 
investigators and IRC assessment was high for ORR and PFS, and comparable for the primary and the 
updated analysis (78.8% vs. 76.3% for ORR; 90.0% vs. 91.3% for PFS/censoring events). 
The updated median OS reached is almost the double of the magnitude of the updated median PFS. The 
applicant has provided further information related to the type of subsequent treatment that discontinued 
patients received. Data on response to new anti-lymphoma therapies or progression dates following new 
anti-lymphoma therapies were not collected in Study L-MIND. Therefore, PFS2 analyses are not possible. 
However, Kaplan-Meier analyses of OS2 (from End of Treatment in L-MIND until death) were performed 
as  surrogate  for  PFS2.  As  of  the  data  cut  off  of  30  NOV  2019,  58  patients  (out  of  80  in  the  FAS) 
discontinued study treatment in L-MIND. Following discontinuation of therapy in L-MIND, the majority of 
patients (31/58) went on to receive subsequent new anti-lymphoma therapies (systemic therapy and 
radiotherapy). For this subset of patients, a median OS of 12.7 months was reported. Of 58 patients who 
discontinued treatment in L-MIND at the data cut off 30 Nov2019, 30 patients (52%) received at least 
one subsequent systemic therapy, with the majority of next-line treatments being “standard” salvage 
therapy regimens. Two patients proceeded to receive CAR-T therapy and two additional patients received 
a stem cell transplantation after L-MIND. The applicant specified that 2 patients could then receive CAR-
T therapy after tafasitamab and lenalidomide failure. Despite limited to descriptive data, these results 
are reassuring on the fact that the use of tafasitamab would not be a loss of therapeutic chance to access 
CAR-T cells treatment in a later treatment line. 
In  clinical  practice,  the  treatment  of  DLBCL  is  the  same,  whether  de  novo  DLBCL  or  arising  from low 
grade lymphoma, and the wording of indication has accordingly been amended by deleting the sentence 
“…, including DLBCL arising from low grade lymphoma,..” from the wording of the indication.  
The primary reason that patients were not candidates to ASCT included high age (46.3%), refractoriness 
to  salvage  chemotherapy  (22.5%),  comorbidities  (13.8%),  and  refusal  of  high  dose  chemotherapy 
(16.3%). Of those who refused ASCT, only 4 had no comorbidities and refused due to personal reasons. 
For patients eligible to transplant but who refuse there is a concern that by including this subgroup of 
patients as part of the indication, may represent a loss of chance, as these patients that could receive a 
potentially curative option.  For these reasons, the wording “or refuse” was deleted from the indication.

However,  the  section  5.1  of  the  product  information  should  inform  that  in  the  study  L-MIND  16%  of 
enrolled patients had earlier refused HDC/ASCT.  
The clinical efficacy results have been sufficiently reflected in section 5.1. of the SmPC. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA   
As discussed above the clinically relevant effect of tafasitamab is consistently seen throughout sensitivity 
analyses, different histologies or reasons for ASCT ineligibility. However due to the small sample size the 
data cannot be considered comprehensive; a further single arm trial with an optimised design and sample 
size in line with an agreed protocol has been requested by the CHMP.   
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Main evidence supporting this application comes from a single-arm pivotal phase II study to evaluate 
tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide in 81 patients with R/R DLBCL who were not eligible for 
ASCT. Tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide showed encouraging results with a high ORR with 
long DoR and improvements in PFS and OS in a setting with a dismal prognosis.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the additional efficacy data needed in 
the context of a conditional MA: 
In order to confirm the efficacy of tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide in diffuse Large B cell 
lymphoma in patients not eligible for ASCT, the MAH should conduct and submit the results of a single-
arm study of tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide in the approved indication according to an 
agreed protocol.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Only  the  pivotal  study  MOR208C203  (L-MIND)  employed  the  combination  of  lenalidomide  (LEN)  and 
tafasitamab  followed  by  tafasitamab  monotherapy,  for  which  approval in  R/R  DLBCL  is  sought.  Three 
other studies using tafasitamab monotherapy in haematological malignancies (n=141 patients) are also 
included in the safety analysis set (SAS) and presented individually and pooled: MOR208C201 (N= 92; 
35 with R/R DLBCL), MOR208C202 (N=22 ALL patients), and XmAb5574-01 (N=27 R/R CLL patients of 
which 16 received the highest dose of 12 mg/kg corresponding to the dose in the pivotal study).  
Patient exposure 
A total of 222 patients received tafasitamab as SA or in combination with lenalidomide, all histologies 
included. AEs were collected up to 30 days after the last treatment dose and later if considered related 
to study treatment. 
Treatment  schedule  in  the  pivotal  study  was  12  cycles  in  combination  with  lenalidomide,  followed  by 
tafasitamab monotherapy until PD. The frequency of injection progressively decreased to twice per cycle. 
The registration dose of 12.0mg/kg was used in all studies included in the safety analysis, except for 
phase I study XmbAB5574-01 in R/R CLL, which tested increasing doses up to 12 mg/kg.

Treatment schedule was similar across studies, until PD (2 doses per cycle) in most of them except for 
study XmbAB5574-01, with a maximum of 7 cycles. 
The  median  treatment  duration  was  232.0  days  (1;1170)  in  L-Mind  study,  longer  than  in  pooled 
monotherapy studies (51.0 days (1; 1198)). Consequently, cumulative dose is higher in L-MIND study, 
more than twice higher than in pooled monotherapy studies. 
Most of patients received more than 5 cycles in L-MIND study (61.7%), while most of patients in pooled 
monotherapy  studies  received  up  to  5  cycles  (84.4%).  In  L-MIND  study,  28.4%  of  subjects  received 
tafasitamab monotherapy for more than 12 months after lenalidomide withdrawal. 
Few patients received long-term treatment: In the pivotal combination study (MOR208C203) 13 patients 
received 12-24 cycles and 21 patients > 24 cycles of tafasitamab therapy (combined + monotherapy) 
(data cut-off 30JUN2019). The corresponding numbers for the pooled monotherapy studies were 2 and 
9 patients. DLBCL is an aggressive disease and only a limited number of patients would be expected to 
live  long  enough  to  receive  long-term  treatment  (>12  months)  as  opposed  to  patients  with  indolent 
lymphomas.  
Patients in study MOR208C203 were mainly ECOG 0-1 and white, and the number of prior treatments 
were  for  most  patients  1  (49.4%)  or  2  (43.2%).  Patients  with  hepatic,  renal,  or  cardiovascular 
impairment  were  excluded.  MOR208C203  (L-MIND)  excluded  patients  with  known  ‘double/triple  hit’ 
DLBCL at study entry.  
For baseline- and disease-characteristics in the pivotal study MOR208C203 see Efficacy section.

a.  Overall includes AEs starting during the entire on-treatment phase, the Combination Therapy phase includes AEs starting 
between the start of the on-treatment phase and the last date of treatment with LEN + 30 days, and the Extended Tafasitamab 
Monotherapy phase includes AEs starting after the last date of treatment with LEN + 30 days through the end of the on-
treatment phase. Planned treatment for L-MIND is twelve 28-day cycles of Combination Therapy followed by Extended 
Tafasitamab Monotherapy until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity or study discontinuation for any reason. 
  b.  One patient (94004-06) received infusions of tafasitamab on Days 1 and 4 of Cycle 1, but LEN was not administered due to 
acute kidney injury at the time of treatment, and the patient discontinued the study treatment after Cycle 1 Day 4. 
c. 
Investigator could relate AEs to LEN as the pharmacodynamic effect of LEN may last beyond its administration period. 
d.  Data in this table correspond to the data cut-off 30 Jun 2019. As of 30 Nov 2019, two additional SAEs were reported in the 
extended monotherapy phase, leading to 10 (25.0%) patients with serious TEAEs. Please see Section 2.7.4.2.1.8.2 for details.

The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  events  (overall)  in  the  L-MIND  study  were  AEs  in  the  SOCs 
Infections and Infestations (72.8%), Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (65.4%), Gastrointestinal 
Disorders (64.2%), and General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (58.0%) (Table 8/SCS). 
Well-known  lenalidomide  ADRs  (see  lenalidomide  SmPC)  included  in  the  SOCs  Infections  and 
Infestations, Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders, Gastrointestinal Disorders, and General Disorders 
and  Administration  Site  Conditions  occurred  more  frequently  (>  10%  difference)  in  the  combination 
therapy  part  of  study  MOR208C203  than  in  both  the  monotherapy  studies  and  the  monotherapy 
extension  part  of  study  MOR208C203  (Table  8/SCS),  suggesting  that  these  were  mainly  due  to 
lenalidomide.  On  the  other  hand,  the  difference  between  the  pooled  monotherapy  studies  and  the 
extension  part  of  study  MOR208C203  was  most  pronounced  for  the  SOC  Infections  and  Infestations; 
38.3% vs 55.0% potentially reflecting the detrimental effect of the previously administered more toxic 
combination  with  lenalidomide  in  study  MOR208C203  or  the  effect  of  long-term  treatment  with 
tafasitamab  (34  patients  in  MOR208C203  and  11  patients  in  monotherapy  study  C201  received  ≥12 
months of tafasitamab treatment). A phase 3, randomised, controlled study could possibly clarify the 
underlying mechanism.

a.  Overall  includes  AEs  starting  during the  entire on-treatment  phase;  the  Combination  Therapy phase  includes  AEs  starting 
between the start of the on-treatment phase and the last date of treatment with LEN + 30 days; and the Extended Tafasitamab 
Monotherapy  phase  includes  AEs  starting  after  the  last  date  of  treatment  with  LEN  +  30  days  through  the  end  of  the  on-
treatment  phase.  Planned  treatment  for  L-MIND  is  twelve  28-day  cycles  of  Combination  Therapy  followed  by  Extended 
Tafasitamab Monotherapy until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity or study discontinuation for any reason. 
b.  One patient (94004-06) received infusions of tafasitamab on Days 1 and 4 of Cycle 1, but LEN was not administered due to 
acute kidney injury at the time of treatment, and the patient discontinued the study treatment after Cycle 1 Day 4.

In  study  MOR208C203  and  the  pooled  monotherapy  studies,  the  most  frequently  reported  Grade  3-5 
TEAEs  were  in  the  SOC  Blood  and  Lymphatic  System  Disorders  [56.8%  (overall)  /  17.5%  (extension 
part)  and  18.4%,  respectively]  and  Infections  and  Infestations  [29.6%  (overall)  /  12.5%  (extension 
part)  and  13.5%,  respectively]  (Table  10/SCS).  Given  the  underlying  haematological  diseases  in  a 
relapse/refractory setting, this is not surprising, but to what extent tafasitamab contributes can only be 
answered satisfactorily in an RCT.

The applicant has also compared TEAEs and grade 3/4 TEAEs (Table 12/SCS) in the combination part of 
the pivotal study MOR208C203 to the USPI for lenalidomide. The studies are conducted in MDS, multiple 
myeloma,  and  Mantle  cell  lymphoma.  The  latter  could  be  considered  the  disease  most  relevant  to 
compare to R/R DLBCL, and the TEAEs are generally of the same magnitude. As trial design, population, 
disease etc are not the same, no further emphasis will be placed on this comparison.

Patients Treated >12 Cycles (L-MIND study and study MOR208C201) 
In  L-MIND  overall,  a  total  of  34  patients  were  treated  with  tafasitamab  alone  for  >12  cycles  and  21 
patients were treated with tafasitamab alone for >24 cycles. Patients treated for more than 12 cycles 
received tafasitamab alone following the end of LEN therapy after 12 cycles per protocol. After 12 cycles, 
26/34  (76.5%)  patients  experienced  193  TEAEs.  As  patients  continued  treatment  >24  cycles,  16/21 
(76.2%) patients experienced 82 TEAEs. For comparison, the frequency of TEAEs experienced in Cycles 
1-12 was 33/34 (97.1%). The most commonly reported TEAEs in patients treated >12 cycles were in 
the SOC of Infections and Infestations: 16/34 (47.1%) patients during cycle 13-24, with main PTs of 
bronchitis  (4/34  [11.8%]  patients)  and  nasopharyngitis  (4/34  [11.8%]  patients).  Twenty  events  of 
neutropenia were reported for 8/34 (23.5%) patients after 12 cycles and 5 events of neutropenia were 
reported for 3/21 (14.3%) patients after 24 cycles.  
Adverse events of special interest 
TEAEs of special interest was determined for tafasitamab based on preclinical and/or clinical safety data 
for tafasitamab and/or comparable class label statements and/or regulatory authority requirements. The 
following AESIs were specified: anaphylaxis, DILI, QT prolongation, tumour flare, tumour lysis syndrome, 
second  primary  malignancy,  infusion-related  reactions,  allergic  reaction  to  study  drug  (Grade  3  or 
higher),  rash/skin  reactions  other  than  allergic  reactions,  cytokine  release  syndrome,  overdose, 
diarrhoea, acute renal failure, infections, neutropenia, embolic and thrombotic events.  
In  Study  MOR208C203  adverse  events  of  special  interest  as  defined  per  protocol  were  tumour  flare, 
tumour  lysis  syndrome,  second  primary  malignancies,  infusion  related  reactions  (≥  Grade  3),  allergic 
reactions to study drug (≥ Grade 3), cytokine release syndrome and overdoses. 
Allergic reactions  
No events of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reaction were reported as an AE for any patient. There were 
four  events  of  ≥  grade  3  allergic  reaction  in  MOR208C203.  In  two  cases  LEN  was  suspected  and 
interrupted, and in the other two cases both drugs were suspected and discontinued.

Hepatic Disorders and Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI): 
No events of hepatic injury or DILI were reported by Investigators. 
Five cases of elevated liver enzyme values in the monotherapy studies were not considered related to 
treatment, as there were other explanations for the laboratory abnormalities.  
Torsades de pointes and QT Prolongation: 
The AE of  ““Electrocardiogram QTc prolonged” was reported for 1 patient in MOR208C203 (L-MIND) and 
2 patients in MOR208C201. A medical review of these cases showed that the patients had confounding 
factors for QTc prolongation.” and “Four patients with syncope (3 in L-MIND and 1 in MOR208C202) and 
1  with  loss  of  consciousness  in  L-MIND  were  identified  and  upon  review  of  these  cases  none  were 
associated with QTc prolongation or Torsades de pointes.” Going through the narratives no definite link 
to tafasitamab could be assessed as there were other likely explanations.   
Tumour Flare Reaction 
In MOR208C203 the three events of tumour flare all occurred in Cycle 1 with severity ranging from Grade 
1 to Grade 3. One case was considered to be serious.

No events of tumour lysis syndrome were reported for MOR208C203. Overall, 6 actual or potential cases 
of tumour lysis syndrome were reported or identified in the monotherapy studies. 
Infusion-Related Reactions 
In MOR208C202 (ALL patients) a total of 15 infusion-related reactions in 13/22 (59.1%) patients were 
reported.  
In XmAb5574-01 (CLL/SLL patients):18/27 (66.7%) patients experienced an infusion-related reaction. 
All were Grade 1 or 2 and resolved after symptomatic treatment. 
In  MOR208C201  (various  lymphoma  patients):  infusion-related  reactions  were  experienced  by  12/92 
(13.0%)  patients,  mostly  during  the  first  infusion,  and  all  but  one  were  non-serious  in  nature  and  of 
toxicity Grade 1 or 2. The most probable explanation for the high frequency seen in study MOR208C202 
and  XmAb5574-01  is  that  in  leukaemia  patients  a  high  number  of  tumour  cells  are  present  in  the 
peripheral blood and thus are prone to immediate lysis. 
In  MOR208C203  (DLBCL  patients)  a  total  of  5/81  (6.2%)  patients  experienced  an  infusion-related 
reaction; all except for one occurring during the first infusion of tafasitamab; all were Grade 1 in severity. 
Cytokine-Release Syndrome 
Cytokine  release  syndrome  was  not  reported  as  an  AE  in  in  the  pooled  monotherapy  studies  or  in 
MOR208C203 
Second Primary Malignancies.  
At the cutoff date of 30NOV2019 there was another patient with a basal cell carcinoma of the sternum 
and nose, increasing the number of patients with a SPM to 3/81 and in addition one with MDS.  Patient 
data were reviewed for SPM using the SMQ Non-haematological malignant tumours to identify potential 
cases. There was also one case of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in study MOR208C203.  
Overdose (CMQ) 
There  were  no  events  that  meet  the  criteria  for  overdose  reported  in  MOR208C203  or  in  any  of  the 
monotherapy studies. 
Diarrhoea 
In the pooled monotherapy studies 20/141 (14.2%) patients experienced 25 events of diarrhoea and in 
study MOR208C203 a total of 29/81 (35.8%) patients experienced 60 events of diarrhoea. Only 2 cases 
were grade 3 (no grade 4; see Table 20, SCS). Diarrhoea is a common adverse reaction of LEN (>20%), 
which might explain the higher incidence in study MOR208C203.  
Non-allergic skin reactions ≥ Grade 3:  
In  the  pooled  monotherapy  studies,  a  total  of  14/141  (9.9%)  patients  experienced  skin  events  (any 
grades)  that  were  potentially  not  of  allergic  origin  compared  with  30/81  (37.0%)  patients  in 
MOR208C203. Non-allergic skin reactions of Grade 3 were reported for 4 patients in the MOR208C203 
study; none were associated with skin infections.   
Embolic and Thrombotic Events 
There were one thrombotic and one embolic event in monotherapy study MOR208C201. In MOR208C203 
11 (13.6%) patients had 6 serious events and 11 nonserious events. Thromboembolism is a well-known 
ADR for lenalidomide. Whether tafasitamab adds to this could potentially be answered in an RCT.

Infections 
Table 369: Summary of SEAs: Infections   
Search  for  infectious  risk  was  focused  on  serious  AEs  from  SOC  infections  and  infestations,  and  CMQ 
including  infectious  pneumonia,  sepsis  and  UTI.  Infectious  risk  was  observed  with  tafasitamab 
monotherapy,  in  a  similar  trend  in  SAEs  between  pooled  monotherapy  studies  (11.3%)  and  L-MIND 
extended monotherapy phase (10.0%). The risk was increased when combined to lenalidomide (22.5%).

Neutropenia 
Events  of  neutropenia  (and  febrile  neutropenia)  occurred  more  frequently  in  patients  receiving 
tafasitamab-LEN  combination  therapy  (39/80  (48.8%)  patients;  181  events)  compared  with  the 
monotherapy  extension  phase  of  MOR208C203  [11/40  (27.5%)  patients;  24  events].  In  the  pooled 
monotherapy  studies  the  frequency  of  neutropenia  was  even  lower  [15/141  (12.8%)  patients;  17 
events],  despite  the  fact  that  there  were  ALL  patients  in  this  pool  [27/141  of  which  6/27  (22%)  had 
neutropenia; 6/14 neutropenic patients in the pooled monotherapy were ALL patients]. The majority of 
the neutropenia events were Grade 3 or higher.

Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
In study MOR208C203 and the pooled monotherapy studies, the most frequently reported SAEs were 
observed in the SOC Infections and Infestations. Counting all infections (also those occurring in only 1 
patient) 24/42 patients (57%) had an SAE in this SOC.

AE=adverse event; MedDRA=Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; TEAE=treatment emergent adverse event 
MedDRA version 21.0. 
A TEAE is an AE that either starts or worsens in severity on or after the First Treatment Date/Time and on or before the end of 
the on-treatment phase (i.e., the earliest of the treatment end date + 30 days/data cut date/death date). 
Any AE that occurs more than 30 days after the date/time of last dose of study treatment with a causality of related will also be 
considered treatment emergent. 
Patients are counted once per system organ class and preferred term. 
a.  Total reports of serious AEs from monotherapy studies XmAb5574-01, MOR208C201, and MOR208C202. 
There were three fractures in study MOR208C203: One pathological fracture, one lower limb fracture in 
a 65-year old and one in a 78-year old female after a fall. They had received steroids as part of prior 
treatment making them susceptible to steroid-induced osteoporosis.  
There  were  three  SAEs  of  pulmonary  embolism  in  study  MOR208C203  in  the  combination  period  and 
none in the extension period or the monotherapy studies. Venous thromboembolism is a Very common 
ADR of lenalidomide. 
Deaths  
A total of 50 (22.5%) deaths were reported in 222 patients overall: 10 (10.9%) deaths in MOR208C201, 
6  (27.3%)  deaths  in  MOR208C202,  and  34  (42.0%)  deaths  in  MOR208C203.  There  were  no  deaths 
reported in XmAb5574-01. 
As of the submission cut-off date of 30 Jun 2019, a total of 12 death events (on-treatment and post-
treatment)  were  assessed  as  not  related  to  disease  progression  (see  table  below  though  with  a  later 
update but with no change in deaths. Four of these deaths occurred off-treatment and were therefore 
not considered as TEAEs and are not discussed further.

c.  Post-treatment phase includes any events occurring after on-treatment phase. 
Going  through  the  eight  adverse  events  death  narratives,  there  was  one  case  of  PML  (progressive 
multifocal  leukoencephalopathy)  in  study  MOR208C203  diagnosed  post-mortem  but  with  neurological 
symptoms present before treatment start. The patient received four doses of tafasitamab and 15 days 
of lenalidomide. This patient had received three different courses of chemotherapy over the course of 
five years all with rituximab added. It is not considered likely that PML developed due to tafasitamab 
after four doses.  
There was one case of sclerosing cholangitis in a patient with ALL (study MOR208C202). Going through 
the narrative this event seems most likely related to GvHD; the patient had an allogeneic transplantation 
(HSCT)  3  months  before  study  start  and  the  event  occurred  on  d.  98  of  the  study  corresponding  to 
approximately 6 months after HSCT.

*The patient developed sclerosing cholangitis on Study Day 97. The patient died one month later on study day 124 
due to fulminant liver failure. A causal relationship of the event to tafasitamab could not be excluded; however, the 
patient suffered from acute hepatitis A which was diagnosed 10 days prior to death and had suspected acute graft 
versus host disease involving the gastrointestinal tract and liver, both of which could potentially lead to liver failure. 
Laboratory findings 
As expected by the mode of action of tafasitamab, there was a decrease of lymphocytes. 
Neutropenia, disorders of the liver, and acute renal failure are discussed in the AESI section.

a.  Monotherapy Studies MOR208C202 and XmAb5574-01. MOR208C201 was excluded as CTCAE grading was not applied 
to laboratory results for this study. MOR208C202 does not have laboratory results for Prothrombin INR. 
b.  Baseline is defined as the last non-missing value recorded prior to first study treatment. 
c.  Worst on-treatment grade is the worst CTCAE grade observed during the on-treatment phase, in this case Grade 3/4. On-
treatment phase is between the time of first study treatment until the earliest of 30 days after the last study treatment, the data 
cut date or death date. 
Safety in special populations 
There  were  a  higher  number  of  SAEs  and  discontinuations  with  higher  age  (see  table  below).  No 
consistent pattern of specific AEs particularly related to higher age could be seen, which could be due to 
the relative low number of patients.  No major differences related to gender were seen. Due to few non-
white patients in the SAS no meaningful racial differences could be discerned.  
No  geographic  differences  could  be  evaluated  as  most  patients  (93%)  in  MOR208C203  came  from 
Europe. 
As  patients  with  severe  renal  or  hepatic  impairment  were  excluded  from  clinical  trials,  the  applicant 
identified  retrospectively  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  renal  impairment  or  non-severe  hepatic 
impairment; no issues were noted.

Immunological events 
The clinical assessment of immunogenicity for tafasitamab was evaluated in 245 patients, of which 81 
(33.1%) of the 245 patients were part of MOR208C203. The other 164 (66.9%) patients were derived 
from  the  4  other  clinical  studies  (XmAb5574-01,  MOR208C201,  MOR208C202,  and  MOR208C205 
COSMOS), in which tafasitamab was tested in different indications and/or different treatment settings

compared with MOR208C203. In MOR208C203, mean exposure time to tafasitamab was 49.3 weeks and 
anti-drug antibody (ADA) samples were collected for up to 2 years. 
A low number of patients were tested ADA-positive before start of tafasitamab treatment suggesting the 
presence of pre-existing antibodies, i.e., 17 (6.9%) of the 245 patients overall (including 2 patients from 
MOR208C203). Only 6 of  these patients with pre-existing ADAs were  ADA positive on an intermittent 
basis also after start of tafasitamab treatment (i.e., ADA positive at 1 to 7 sampling time points; none 
within MOR208C203). The other 11 of these patients with pre-existing ADAs did not show any positive 
ADA assessment during treatment. Thus, in all 5 clinical studies, no treatment-emergent or treatment-
boosted ADAs could be detected. The ADA titres were low and there was no apparent clinical impact of 
ADAs on PK, safety, or efficacy.  
In conclusion, no cases of treatment-emergent ADA occurred. In MOR208C203 the mean exposure time 
to tafasitamab was 49.3 weeks. - See also section of Clinical pharmacology.

Overall,  10  TEAEs  (7.1%)  in  pooled  monotherapy  studies  and  12  (14.8%)  in  L-MIND  study  led  to 
tafasitamab  discontinuation.  The  main  reported  SOCs  included  Infections  and  Infestations,  and  Blood 
and Lymphatic system disorders. No PT was reported more than once. 
There  seem  to  be  no  pattern  of  reasons  for  discontinuation  but  the  total  number  of  patients  having 
received  tafasitamab  is  low  and  more  patients  and  an  RCT  may  reveal  specific  ADRs  leading  to 
discontinuation. The reasons for discontinuation of lenalidomide are in line with the listed ADRs. 
The  applicant  discussed  TEAEs  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation.  The  applicant  later  provided  a 
discussion  on  TEAE  leading  to  treatment  interruption  as  no  treatment  modification  was  allowed  for 
tafasitamab.  Treatment  interruption  occurred  mostly  in  the  first  2  cycles  similarly  to  treatment 
discontinuation. These TEAE leading to treatment interruption were often manageable and patients were 
able to restart treatment.   
Post marketing experience 
Tafasitamab was only approved by the FDA in July 2020. No post marketing data is currently available.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
This is an application for the use of tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide followed by tafasitamab 
monotherapy in adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who are not eligible for or refuse ASCT 
on the basis of Study MOR208C203 (L-MIND) which is considered the main source of safety information.  
The  pivotal  study  MOR208C203  consists  of  81  R/R  DLBCL  patients  (one  patient  received  tafasitamab 
only)  of  which  40  continued  to  the  monotherapy  part.  The  median  duration  of  exposure  to  study 
treatment (MOR00208 + LEN) was 9.2 months (range: 0.23, 32.10 months). The median duration of 
exposure to MOR00208 was 6.2 months (range: 0.1, 12.4). The median duration of exposure to LEN 
was 4.2 months (range: 0.07, 20.83) (see CSR, Table 12-1 and Table 2, SCS). 30/81 patients received 
the intended 12 months of lenalidomide therapy. Few patients received long-term treatment: 13 patients 
Assessment report

received 12-24 cycles and 21 patients > 24 cycles of tafasitamab therapy (combined + monotherapy) 
(data cut-off 30JUN2019). 
As supportive safety data the applicant has pooled three tafasitamab monotherapy studies performed in 
patients with various haematological malignancies and in one study also in various doses. In the phase 
2 study MOR208C201 35/92 patients had R/R DLBCL and the rest various other lymphomas. The phase 
2  study  MOR208C202  consisted  of  22  relapsed  B-ALL  patients  and  the  phase  1  study  XmAb5574-01 
consisted of 27 R/R CLL patients of which 16 received the same dose as in the pivotal DLBCL study (12 
mg/kg). With regards to exposure 2 patients received 12-24 cycles and 9 patients > 24 cycles in the 
pooled monotherapy studies.  
AEs incidence was significantly higher when combined with lenalidomide, with expected AEs according 
to the known lenalidomide safety profile. The most frequently reported adverse events (overall) in the 
L-MIND study were AEs in the SOCs Infections and Infestations (72.8%), Blood and Lymphatic System 
Disorders (65.4%), Gastrointestinal Disorders (64.2%), and General Disorders and Administration Site 
Conditions (58.0%). The difference between the pooled monotherapy studies and the extension part of 
study MOR208C203 was most pronounced for the SOC Infections and Infestations; 38.3% vs 55.0%, 
respectively, potentially reflecting the previously administered more toxic combination with lenalidomide 
in study MOR208C203 or the effect of long-term treatment with tafasitamab. The difference between the 
extension arm and the pooled monotherapy studies is even larger when focussing on lymphoma patients 
only, as the patients in the CLL and ALL studies, not unexpectedly, had a higher incidence of infections 
compared to the lymphoma study (13/27=48.1% and 11/22=50%, respectively vs 30/92=32.6%). A 
phase  3,  randomised,  controlled  study  could  possibly  clarify  to  what  extent  tafasitamab  contributes 
compared to LEN.    
In  study  MOR208C203  and  the  pooled  monotherapy  studies,  the  most  frequently  reported  Grade  3-5 
TEAEs  were  in  the  SOC  Blood  and  Lymphatic  System  Disorders  [56.8%  (overall)  /  17.5%  (extension 
part)  and  18.4%,  respectively]  and  Infections  and  Infestations  [29.6%  (overall)  /  12.5%  (extension 
part) and 13.5%, respectively] (Table 10/SCS). Given the underlying haematological diseases this is not 
surprising, but to what extent tafasitamab contributes can only be answered satisfactorily in an RCT. The 
incidence of grade ≥ 3 TEAEs was higher in overall L-MIND study (77.8%) than in pooled monotherapy 
studies (46.1%), driven by combination therapy. Grade ≥ 3 TEAE frequencies in tafasitamab extended 
monotherapy were similar to pooled monotherapy studies. 
With  regards  to  AESIs  it  seems  that  infections  and neutropenia  are  related  to  tafasitamab.  Fatal  and 
serious  infections,  including  opportunistic  infections,  occurred  in  patients  during  treatment  with 
tafasitamab. Tafasitamab should be administered to patients with an active infection only if the infection 
is treated appropriately and well controlled. Patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections may 
be at increased risk of infection and should be monitored appropriately. (see SmPC section 4.4). As these 
PTs are also frequently seen during LEN treatment the part that tafasitamab plays is undetermined.  
Not unexpectedly, infusion-related reaction (IRRs) are an AESI, although most of them seem to be low-
grade and thus manageable. Warnings on IRRs have been included in the SmPC section 4.4. Infusion-
related reactions may occur and have been reported more frequently during the first infusion (see SmPC 
section 4.8). Patients should be monitored closely throughout the infusion. Patients should be advised 
to  contact  their  healthcare  professionals  if  they  experience  signs  and  symptoms  of  infusion-related 
reactions including fever, chills, rash or breathing problems within 24 hours of infusion. A premedication 
should be administered to patients prior to starting tafasitamab infusion. Based on the severity of the 
infusion-related  reaction,  tafasitamab  infusion  should  be  interrupted  or  discontinued  and  appropriate 
medical management should be instituted (see SmPC section 4.2).

The following SAEs are reported with TAFA+LEN combination, not described with TAFA only: pulmonary 
embolism, atrial fibrillation, bronchitis, cardiac failure congestive. These SAEs reflect the known safety 
profile of lenalidomide, and are included in the proposed SmPC for TAFA+LEN combination. 
Related  SAEs  reported  with  TAFA  only  (L-MIND  study,  extended  phase)  included  pneumonia  (1)  and 
streptococcal sepsis (1). Additionally, from pooled monotherapy studies, related SAEs included febrile 
neutropenia  (3)  tumour  lysis  syndrome  (3),  infections  (n=3,  including  one  fungal  infection  and  one 
genital herpes zoster), and infusion related reaction (1).  
AEs leading to tafasitamab discontinuation concerned 7.1% of patients in pooled monotherapy studies 
and 14.8% in L-MIND study; the main reported SOCs included Infections and Infestations, and Blood 
and Lymphatic system disorders. TEAEs leading to treatment modification, interruption or dose reduction 
were not discussed. Moreover, the timing for treatment discontinuation or interruption should also be 
discussed.  
Infections, neutropenia and IRR seem to be related to tafasitamab to a certain degree. No clear pattern 
of adverse events for SAEs and deaths related to tafasitamab can be seen, but any clear conclusion as 
to tafasitamab ADRs is hampered by the concomitant use of lenalidomide, the small safety population, 
and in particular the lack of a comparator.  The applicant has presented data updated by 16 months. 
The  median  exposure  is  still  9.2  months  but  the  longest  treatment  has  increased  from  32.1  to  54.7 
months. Six patients moved from treatment for 1-2 years to ≥ 2 years so that altogether 27 patients 
were  exposed  for  ≥2  years.  Nineteen  patients  are  still  ongoing.  Looking  at  safety  no  new  deaths  or 
discontinuations while on treatment occurred. There was a slight increase in adverse events (All and ≥ 
Grade 3) related to the SOCs Blood and lymphatic disorders and Infections and infestations, which is not 
unexpected. 
Treatment with tafasitamab can cause serious and/or severe myelosuppression including neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia  and  anaemia  (see  section  4.8).  Complete  blood  counts  should  be  monitored 
throughout treatment and prior to administration of each treatment cycle. Based on the severity of the 
adverse reaction, tafasitamab infusion should be withheld. Refer to the lenalidomide SmPC for dosage 
modifications. 
Neutropenia,  including  febrile  neutropenia,  has  been  reported  during  treatment  with  tafasitamab. 
Administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF) should be considered, in particular in 
patients  with  Grade  3  or  4  neutropenia.  Any  symptoms  or  signs  of  developing  infection  should  be 
anticipated, evaluated and treated.  
Thrombocytopenia  has  been  reported  during  treatment  with  tafasitamab.  Withholding  of  concomitant 
medicinal products that may increase bleeding risk (e.g. platelet inhibitors, anticoagulants) should be 
considered. Patients should be advised to report signs or symptoms of bruising or bleeding immediately. 
Patients with high tumour burden and rapidly proliferative tumour may be at increased risk of tumour 
lysis syndrome. In patients with DLBCL, tumour lysis syndrome during treatment with tafasitamab has 
been observed. Appropriate measures/prophylaxis in accordance with local guidelines should be taken 
prior  to  treatment  with  tafasitamab.  Patients  should  be  monitored  closely  for  tumour  lysis  syndrome 
during treatment with tafasitamab. 
Treatment with tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide should not be initiated in female patients 
unless  pregnancy  has  been  excluded  (see  SmPC  section  6.6).  Please  also  refer  to  the  SmPC  of 
lenalidomide. 
The safety of immunisation with live vaccines following tafasitamab therapy has not been investigated 
and vaccination with live vaccines is not recommended concurrently with tafasitamab therapy.

Few patients received long-term treatment with tafasitamab with or without lenalidomide. The applicant 
has  presented  data  updated  by  16  months.  The  median  exposure  is  still  9.2  months  but  the  longest 
treatment has increased from 32.1 to 54.7 months. Six patients moved from treatment for 1-2 years to 
≥ 2 years so that altogether 27 patients were exposed for ≥2 years; 19 patients are ongoing at the time 
of  this  report.    No  new  deaths  or  discontinuations  while  on  treatment  occurred  by  the  latest  cut-off. 
There  was  a  slight  increase  in  adverse  events  (All  and  ≥  Grade  3)  related  to  the  SOCs  Blood  and 
lymphatic disorders and Infections and infestations, which is not unexpected.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
The  median  exposure  to  tafasitamab  in  the  pivotal  L-MIND  study  that  include  81  patients  was  6.2 
months. Few patients received long-term treatment; rare adverse events and long-term adverse events 
are not expected to be fully elucidated at the moment. Since the data cannot be comprehensive enough 
to support a full MA, a conditional MA was proposed and further data will be submitted so that safety will 
be  reconfirmed  through  an  expanded  database  in  a  new  single  arm  trial  with  the  combination  of 
tafasitamab  and  lenalidomide  in  the  indicated  patient  population  and  through  the  Front-MIND  trial. 
Further, long term safety of tafasitamab with bendamustine will be studied in the B-MIND trial. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The pivotal study L-MIND study showed a high incidence of AEs (all grades) in the SOCs Infections and 
Infestations  (72.8%),  Blood  and  Lymphatic  System  Disorders  (65.4%),  especially  neutropenia,  and 
Gastrointestinal  Disorders (64.2%).  These  AEs  are  as  to  be  expected  in  haematological  diseases  in  a 
relapsed/refractory  setting  and  considered  manageable.    The  dossier  may  not  be  considered 
comprehensive to support a full approval in the proposed indication.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the context 
of a conditional MA 
• 
• 
• 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide in 
diffuse  Large  B  cell  lymphoma  in  patients  not  eligible  for  ASCT,  the  MAH  should  conduct  and 
submit the results of a single-arm study of Tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide in the 
approved indication according to an agreed protocol.  
In  order  to  confirm  the  safety  profile  of  tafasitamab  in  combination  with  lenalidomide  the 
applicant should submit the results of a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial comparing tafasitamab plus lenalidomide in addition to R-CHOP versus R-CHOP 
in previously untreated, high-intermediate and high-risk patients with newly-diagnosed diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). 
In order to confirm long term safety of tafasitamab the applicant should submit the results of a 
Phase 2/3, Randomised, Multicentre Study of Tafasitamab With Bendamustine Versus Rituximab 
With Bendamustine in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (R-

applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant  to  Article  23(1)  of  Regulation  No  (EU)  726/2004,  Minjuvi  (tafasitamab)  is  included  in  the 
additional monitoring list as it as it pertains a conditional marketing authorisation for a product containing 
a new active substance and contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained 
in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Minjuvi is indicated in combination with lenalidomide followed by Minjuvi monotherapy for the treatment 
of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are not eligible 
for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Standard  treatment  for  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  DLBCL  consists  of  immuno-chemotherapy  with 
the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab (RTX), and CHOP administered for 6-8 cycles (R-CHOP) 
(Tilly et al. 2015). The addition of RTX has substantially improved the results of CHOP-chemotherapy, 
yielding  complete  and  sustained  remission  in  about  60%  of  cases  (Coiffier  et  al,  2002).  But  still 
approximately 30-40% of patients ultimately will relapse and are not cured by first-line therapy with R-
CHOP,  and  approximately  10%  of  patients  are  refractory  to  R-CHOP  as  first-line  therapy  (primary 
refractory) (Coiffier et al., 2010). 
In  patients  progressing  or  relapsing  after  first-line  treatment,  the  main  consideration  for  further 
treatment is whether the patients is a candidate for HDT and ASCT. Salvage chemotherapy followed by 
HDT and ASCT is standard treatment for transplant-eligible patients, and may offer a second chance of 
cure for about 30-40% of the patients (Crump 2017, Gisselbrecht 2010). However, the majority of R/R 
DLBCL  patients  are  ineligible  for  ASCT  due  to  comorbidities  and  older  age.  The  treatment  options  for 
patients who have relapsed or progressed after second-line treatment of DLBC, or who are not eligible 
for ASCT are limited. For these patients, the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines 
recommend participation in clinical studies, treatment with platinum- and/or gemcitabine-based salvage 
regimens (with or without RTX) (Tilly et al. 2015).  Of note, none of the agents recommended by the 
ESMO guidelines (Tilly et al. 2015) is specifically approved as a second-line treatment for DLBCL, and 
there is no consensus regarding the optimal treatment, which focuses on prolongation of survival and 
not having a curative intent. The outcome is dismal with generally no prolonged periods of disease control 
(Thieblemont  and  Coiffier  2007).  Despite  new  approved  therapies,  such  as  CAR-T  and  Polatuzumab, 
there remains an unmet medical need for patients with R/R DLBCL who are ineligible for or fail ASCT. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  main  evidence  of  efficacy  and  safety  submitted  is  a  phase  2  single-arm,  multicentre,  open-label 
study (MOR208C203 (L MIND; n=81) of tafasitamab combined with lenalidomide followed by tafasitamab 
monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and who are 
ineligible for or refuse autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).  Two supportive studies were also included 
in order to demonstrate the contribution of each agent to the combination; 
- NHL study (MOR208C201): A Phase IIa, open-label, multicentre study of single-agent MOR00208 in 
patients with relapsed or refractory B-Cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 
- RE-MIND (MOR208C206): An observational retrospective cohort study of lenalidomide monotherapy in 
R/R DLBCL to generate a historical control for clinical trial MOR208C203

3.2.  Favourable effects 
Tafasitamab  in  combination  with  lenalidomide  in  centrally  confirmed  DLBCL  patients  based  on  the 
updated data cut-off as of 30-Oct-2020 within ITT (n=81) showed: 
- an ORR of 56.8% (95%CI: 45.3; 67.8), a CR rate of 39.5% (95%CI: 28.8;51.0) 
- a median DoR by IRC of 43.9 months (95% CI: 26.1; NR). Median duration of response was not reached 
in  complete  responders  (95%  CI:  43.9;  not  reached)  and  was  5.6  months  in  patients  with  partial

- a median PFS by IRC of 11.6 months (95% CI: 5.7; 45.7) and  
- a median OS of 31.6 months (95%CI: 18.3; NR) after a median follow-up time of 42.7 months (95% 
CI: 38.0;47.2) 
- results from secondary endpoints such as EFS, TTP and TNT were in line with primary and key secondary 
endpoint. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Main evidence supporting this application comes from a single-arm pivotal phase II study to evaluate 
tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide in 81 patients with R/R DLBCL who were not eligible for 
ASCT. The patient population in study L-MIND is considered small and the clinical package cannot be 
considered comprehensive. A further single arm trial with an optimised design and sample size in line 
with an agreed protocol has been requested by the CHMP as a specific obligation in the context of the 
CMA (see Annex II).   
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the L-MIND study a high incidence of AEs (all grades) in the SOCs Infections and Infestations (72.8%), 
Blood  and  Lymphatic  System  Disorders  (65.4%),  Gastrointestinal  Disorders  (64.2%),  and  General 
Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (58.0%) were observed.   
In  study  MOR208C203  and  the  pooled  monotherapy  studies,  the  most  frequently  reported  Grade  3-5 
TEAEs  were  in  the  SOC  Blood  and  Lymphatic  System  Disorders  [56.8%  (overall)  /  17.5%  (extension 
part)  and  18.4%,  respectively]  and  Infections  and  Infestations  [29.6%  (overall)  /  12.5%  (extension 
part)  and  13.5%,  respectively]  (Table  10/SCS).  Given  the  underlying  haematological  diseases  in  a 
relapsed/refractory  setting  AEs  in  these  SOCs  are  to  be  expected,  but  to  what  extent  lenalidomide  + 
tafasitamab contributes is uncertain. 
With regards to AESIs it seems that infections and neutropenia are related to tafasitamab. As these PTs 
are  also  frequently  seen  during  LEN  treatment  the  part  that  tafasitamab  plays  is  undetermined.  Not 
unexpectedly, infusion-related reactions (IRRs) are observed, although most of them seem to be low-
grade and thus manageable.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The median exposure to tafasitamab in the pivotal L-MIND study that included 81 patients was 35 weeks 
(8.05 months). Rare adverse events and long-term adverse events are not expected to be fully elucidated 
at the moment therefore further data is needed to confirm the long-term safety of tafasitamab.

Few  patients  received  long-term  treatment:  13  patients  received  12-24  cycles  and  21  patients  >  24 
cycles of tafasitamab therapy (combined + monotherapy) (data cut-off 30 June 2019; another 6 patients 
were added with the data cut-off 30 October 2020).  
Further safety data will be submitted through the specific obligations:  
•  Study  Front-MIND  will  provide  data  on  the  safety  profile  of  tafasitamab  in  combination  with 
lenalidomide in addition to R-CHOP versus R-CHOP in previously untreated, high-intermediate 
and high-risk patients with newly-diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (see  RMP 
and Annex II). 
•  Study B-MIND, a Phase 2/3, Randomised, Multicentre Study of Tafasitamab With Bendamustine 
Versus Rituximab with Bendamustine in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-
Cell  Lymphoma  (R-R  DLBCL)  Who  Are  Not  Eligible  for  High-Dose  Chemotherapy  (HDC)  and 
Autologous Stem-Cell Transplantation (ASCT), will look into long term safety (see RMP and Annex 
II).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
For patients with R/R DLBCL ineligible to HDT and ASCT, no standard treatment exists, and the prognosis 
remains poor. For these patients, the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) treatment guidelines 
recommend participation in clinical studies, treatment with platinum- and/or gemcitabine-based salvage 
regimens (with or without RTX) (Tilly et al. 2015).  Of note, none of the agents recommended by the 
ESMO guidelines (Tilly et al. 2015) is specifically approved as a second-line treatment for DLBCL, and no 
particular  therapy  appears  to  be  favoured  over  the  others  by  the  guidelines.  Recently,  Polatuzumab 
received  indications  in  2L+  setting  and  CAR-T  therapies  received  indications  in  3L+  setting  for  R/R 
DLBCL. 
Compared with historical data with monotherapy of tafasitamab and lenalidomide, an ORR of > 50% is 
considered highly clinically meaningful in the relapse-refractory setting of DLBCL not eligible to high dose 
chemotherapy and ASCT. Although based on limited numbers in a single-arm study, the ORR data and 
CR  rate  of  39.5%  are  considered  a  clinically  meaningful  outcome  in  patients  with  R/R  –  DLBCL.  The 
clinically  relevant  effect  of  tafasitamab  is  consistently  seen  throughout  sensitivity  analyses,  different 
histologies or reasons for ASCT ineligibility.  
The pivotal study L-MIND study showed a high incidence of infections, neutropenia and gastrointestinal 
disorders. These AEs are as to be expected in haematological diseases in a relapsed/refractory setting 
and considered manageable. Being a single arm phase 2 study, makes it difficult to disentangle to what 
extent tafasitamab contributes to the efficacy and the overall AEs. Further, the safety profile should be 
seen in context of the clinical meaningful efficacy results.  
As  data  for  the  product  was  not  considered  comprehensive,  the  applicant  requested  a  conditional  MA 
during the assessment and has justified the requirements for a conditional approval. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
An ORR of 56.8% and a CR rate of 39.5% is considered clinically meaningful and sufficient to establish 
efficacy in a R/R DLBCL setting not eligible to ASCT. Overall, the safety profile is considered manageable; 
more comprehensive and long- term safety data with tafasitamab will be provided post authorisation.

EMA/426468/2021

3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
 Conditional marketing authorisation 
As  comprehensive  data  on  the  product  are  not  available,  a  conditional  marketing  authorisation  was 
requested by the applicant during the assessment.  
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning conditional 
marketing authorisations, as R/R DLBCL not eligible to ASCT is considered a serious and life-threatening 
disease. In addition, the product is designated as an orphan medicinal product. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
As confirmative studies (SOB) in the context of CMA, the applicant will seek to confirm the efficacy and 
safety of tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide in diffuse Large B cell lymphoma in patients not 
eligible  for  ASCT,  by  conducting  another  single-arm  study  of  tafasitamab  in  combination  with 
lenalidomide in the approved indication according to an agreed protocol. The protocol will be submitted 
for the review of the CHMP no later than 3 months after the Commission Decision. 
Further, the applicant will provide data from the B-MIND in order to investigate further the long-term 
safety.  B-MIND  is  an  ongoing  study  in  R/R  DLBCL,  MOR208C204  (B-MIND)  of  tafasitamab  and 
bendamustine  vs  rituximab  and  bendamustine,  and  it  is  proposed  as  a  SOB  to  confirm  the  safety  of 
tafasitamab.  
The applicant is also planning to conduct a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 
Front-MIND  (EudraCT  number  2020-002990-84)  comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  tafasitamab  + 
lenalidomide 
in  addition  to  R-CHOP  versus  R-CHOP  alone 
in  previously  untreated,  high-
intermediate/high-risk patients with newly-diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and high-
grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL). This study was agreed as an SOB to further expand the safety database 
and evaluate the safety of tafasitamab+ lenalidomide in combination with SOC in 1L DLBCL. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed.  
The incidence of DLBCL increases with age, and DLBCL patients over 60 years of age (median age was 
67y,  range  60–88)  have  a  poorer  prognosis  and  inferior  outcomes  than  younger  DLBCL  patients. 
Standard  treatment  for  newly  diagnosed  DLBCL  is  an  anthracycline  based  immune-chemotherapy 
regimen, R-CHOP or R-CHOEP. Although the outcome has improved over the last decades, 10-15% of 
the patients are primary refractory and 20-30% relapse. For patients who relapse or are refractory to 
their first line therapy, a key determinant for their subsequent treatment is the performance status and 
whether the patient is eligible to high dose chemotherapy and ASCT. 
For patients who are ineligible for transplant, the goal of second-line therapy is to induce a remission as 
long  as  possible  and  prolong  survival  although  not  with  curative  intent.  Poor  outcomes  are  observed 
among patients who are ineligible for SCT (mOS: 6 to 11 months) or have refractory disease (mOS: 6.1 
to 7.1 months) after any line of treatment (Arcari et al 2016; Crump et al 2017; Czuczman et al 2017). 
For  patients  receiving  second-line  salvage  therapy  OS  range  from  11  to  17.2  months  while  patients 
receiving third-line salvage therapy had a shorter OS, ranging from 5.9 to 8.0 months (Lenz et al 2018). 
Additional treatment options are needed in R/R DLBCL in patients not eligible for ASCT, aiming to achieve 
control and remission of the disease for as long as possible given that all patients eventually relapse and 
Assessment report

become resistant to available treatments, where the remission duration generally decreases with each 
subsequent  treatment  regimen,  and  where  the  toxicity  of  different  regimens  is  significant  and  quite 
different between products. In this context, medicinal products with a positive benefit-risk balance and 
new mechanism of action can provide a major therapeutic advantage to patients if they offer possible 
alternative or additional treatment options based on a different safety profile, or based on therapeutic 
efficacy when other products are not expected to be effective. 
Tafasitamab  has  a  mechanism  of  action  that  is  different  from  that  of  authorised  treatments  and  has 
shown to be associated with a 53.5% objective response rate, a CR rate of 35.2% (95%CI: 28.8;51.0) 
and a median duration of response of 34.6 months in this group of R/R patients with a dismal prognosis. 
Tafasitamab has a distinct toxicity profile compared to approved products. However, AEs of tafasitamab 
are mostly reversible, and clinically manageable. Treatment is tolerated when adverse effects are closely 
monitored  and  actively  managed,  mainly  by  dose  modifications.   Therefore,  tafasitamab  can  be 
considered a major therapeutic advantage in the proposed target population for whom there are very 
limited and often no other treatment options available, in particular when available options are unlikely 
to be efficacious, or when it is the preferred option in view of its efficacy and safety profiles. 
In  conclusion,  patients  who  are  not  eligible  to  HDC  and  ASCT  do  have  an  unmet  medical  need  for 
effective, tolerable and more accessible medicines.  
• 
The benefits to the public health of the immediate availability of the product outweigh the risks 
inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.  
Patients  with  R/R  DLBCL  who  are  not eligible to  ASCT  have  limited therapeutic  options.  An  ORR  of  > 
50% and a DoR of 34.6 months is considered clinically meaningful and of benefit to public health in a 
disease characterised of rapid progression. The safety profile of tafasitamab is considered manageable 
in  the  clinical  setting.  The  benefits  to  the  public  health  of  the  immediate  availability  of  the  product 
outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Minjuvi is positive. The MA shall be subject to the conditions specified in Annex II.  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The  CHMP  by  consensus  is  of  the  opinion  that  Minjuvi  is  not  similar  to  Polivy,  Kymriah  and  Yescarta 
within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Minjuvi is favourable in the following indication: 
Minjuvi  in  combination  with  lenalidomide  followed  by  Minjuvi  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  adult 
patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma  (DLBCL)  who  are  not  eligible  for 
autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).

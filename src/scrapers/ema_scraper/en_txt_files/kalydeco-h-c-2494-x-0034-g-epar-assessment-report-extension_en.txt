1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Europe) Ltd., (“MAH”) submitted to 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 10 October 2014 an application for a grouping of 
variations in accordance with Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 consisting of an 
extension of the marketing authorisation and a Type II C.I.4. variation for Kalydeco. 
The MAH applied for an extension of the marketing authorisation consisting in the addition of a new 
pharmaceutical form with two strengths (50 mg and 75 mg) to support an extension of the target 
population covered by the authorised therapeutic indication of Kalydeco to treat cystic fibrosis (CF) 
patients aged 2 to less than 6 years old, grouped with a variation to align the Summary of Product 
Characteristics and Patient Information leaflet currently approved for Kalydeco 150 mg with the 
new submitted data.  
The MAH applied for the following indication for 50 mg and 75 mg granules in sachet: 
Kalydeco granules are indicated for the treatment of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 
• 
2 years and older and weighing less than 25 kg who have one of the following gating (class III) 
mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, 
or S549R (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
For the approved 150 mg film-coated tablets, the applicant requested the following variation:  
Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.2 of the Summary of Product Characteristics to 
• 
provide clarity and relevant updates in line with the proposed extension application. The requested 
variation proposed consequential amendments to the Package Leaflet.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating 
morbidities and high premature mortality and at present, there is no cure. CF affects approximately 
70,000 individuals worldwide. The incidence and prevalence of CF varies between racial groups. 
Based on the size of the population, CF qualifies as an orphan disease.  
CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene that result in absent or deficient function of the CFTR 
protein at the cell surface. The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride channel responsible for aiding 
in the regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion, and is located in the apical membrane 
of epithelial cells in multiple organs, including lungs, pancreas, intestinal tract, biliary tract, sweat 
glands, and vas deferens. The failure to regulate chloride transport in these organs results in the 
multisystem pathology associated with CF. In the lungs, the dysfunction in the CFTR protein leads 
to obstruction of airways with thick mucus, establishment of chronic bacterial infection, and 
damaging inflammatory responses that are all thought to play a role in causing irreversible 
structural changes. Patients with CF typically experience a progressive loss of lung function 
ultimately resulting in respiratory failure and premature death. The diagnosis of CF is suggested by 
the presence of one or more characteristic clinical features, a history of CF in a sibling, or a positive 
newborn screening test result, and is confirmed by laboratory evidence of abnormal CFTR protein 
function or by genotyping analysis (Farrell PM et al, 2008). In children with CF, pancreatic 
insufficiency (O’Sullivan BP et al, 2013) and poor nutritional status (Farrell PM et al, 2001) are the 
most significant clinical manifestations of the disease. Malnourishment is associated with worsening 
lung function and is also an independent predictor of mortality (Sharma R et al, 2001). Presence of 
lung disease (Ramsey KA, Ranganathan S, 2014) and liver disease (Leeuwen L et al, 2014) has 
also been shown. Structural lung damage is common very early in disease progression (Mott LS et 
al, 2012); e.g. bronchiectasis, air-trapping. Airway infection in the CF lung also varies with age. 
The majority of children less than 6 years old are colonized with Staphylococcus aureus or 
Haemophilus influenzae, and approximately 40% of them colonized with P aeruginosa. 
Approximately 29% of infants with P aeruginosa infection develop nonmucoid infection in the first 6 
months of life (Li Z et al, 2005). 
Traditional pulmonary function tests, such as spirometry parameters, are not sufficiently sensitive 
to detect early manifestations of lung disease and for assessing drug effects in young children with 
CF. In addition, change in percent predict FEV1, recommended primary endpoint, is not feasible in 
children from birth through 5 years of age because FEV1 involves spirometry, which can only be 
performed in children 6 years of age and older. Two methods to evaluate pulmonary function in 
children 0 (birth) through 5 years of age have been developed: infant pulmonary functioning tests 
(iPFTs) (for use in children less than 2 years of age) and preschool PFTs (for use in children 3 
through 5 years of age).  
The MAH stated that early therapeutic intervention is beneficial to young children with CF and that 
improved measures of growth, nutrition, and lung disease through early intervention in diagnosed 
newborns have been demonstrated. As a consequence, introduction of treatments that are aimed 
at correcting the function of the defective CFTR protein at a young age might postpone or even 
prevent the onset of clinical manifestation of CF. While there seems to be clear evidence that 
earlier intervention improves growth and nutritional status, data seem to be scant regarding lung 
disease although the introduction of more sensitive methods to detect early manifestations of lung 
disease in young children with CF may further clarify this issue in the future.

Kalydeco (ivacaftor) may be expected to be effective in patients with virtually no irreversibly fixed 
lung abnormalities by correcting the function of the defective CFTR protein in cystic fibrosis 
airways. Ivacaftor is a potentiator of the CFTR protein, i.e. in vitro, ivacaftor increased the channel 
activity of G551D-CFTR protein and some other non-G551D CFTR proteins with gating defects 
expressed in recombinant cell and primary human bronchial epithelial cell cultures. The in vitro 
responses seen in single channel patch clamp experiments using membrane patches from rodent 
cells expressing mutant CFTR forms do not necessarily correspond to in vivo pharmacodynamic 
response or clinical benefit. The exact mechanism leading ivacaftor to potentiate the gating activity 
of normal and some mutant CFTR forms in this system has not been completely elucidated. 
In the EU, Kalydeco is currently authorised for the treatment of CF in patients age 6 years and 
older who have one of the following mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, 
G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R. Kalydeco was granted a centralised marketing 
authorisation by the European Commission on 23 July 2013. 
The current application for grouping of variations refers to a change to existing marketing 
authorisation leading to an extension to the Kalydeco Marketing Authorisation to include a new 
pharmaceutical form covering 2 strengths (50 mg and 75 mg unit doses) to support an extension 
of the target population covered by the currently authorised therapeutic indication to enable 
administration of Kalydeco to patients aged 2 to less than 6 years of age and weighing less than 25 
kg who have one of the following gating (class III) mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, 
G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as granules in sachet containing 50 mg and 75 mg of ivacaftor as 
active substance. This new pharmaceutical form is being introduced to enable administration of 
Kalydeco to patients aged 2 to less than 6 years old. 
Other ingredients are: colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose acetate 
succinate, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, mannitol, sucralose, sodium lauryl sulfate. 
The product is packaged in a biaxially oriented polyethylene 
terephthalate/polyethylene/foil/polyethylene (BOPET/PE/Foil/PE) sachet. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance and its spray-dried dispersion (SDD) used in ivacaftor 50 mg and 75 mg 
granules, are identical to those used in the already approved Kalydeco 150 mg tablets. Therefore, 
no information on the active substance and the SDD has been submitted within this line extension. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The quality target product profile (QTPP) was to obtain a bioavailable, safe and efficacious, 
palatable, immediate release formulation for oral administration of ivacaftor to children aged 2 to 
less than 6 years old, which could be mixed with food, and with a 24-month shelf life at room 
temperature. 
Ivacaftor has low aqueous solubility. A granule dosage form was pursued for ease of 
administration. Palatability of the product was assessed through human sensory studies and 
confirmed in the pivotal study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/670893/2020  
Page 7/61 
 
 
 
All excipients used in ivacaftor granules are also used in Kalydeco 150 mg tablet with exception of 
mannitol and sucralose.  Physical and chemical compatibility studies of ivacaftor SDD with mannitol 
and sucralose were conducted and confirmed the compatibility of the active substance with these 
excipients. 
Briefly, the excipients in ivacaftor granules are HPMCAS (stabilizer), SLS (wetting agent), lactose 
monohydrate (filler), mannitol (filler), sucralose (sweetener), croscarmellose sodium (disintegrant), 
colloidal silicon dioxide (glidant) and magnesium stearate (lubricant). All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards.  
As in the original MAA dossier for Kalydeco 150 mg tablets, product and manufacturing process 
development were conducted under a Quality by Design (QbD) paradigm. 
The CQAs for the ivacaftor granules are: appearance, identification, assay, physical form, 
degradation products, water content, dissolution, content uniformity and microbial attributes. 
Once the granule critical quality attributes (CQAs) were identified, an initial risk assessment was 
performed on the granules to determine which materials and process steps could potentially impact 
the CQAs. This risk assessment together with prior knowledge was used to design multivariate 
experiments to evaluate main effects and interactions. Data from these studies were used to 
determine criticality and establish the design spaces for blending and compression that ensure all 
CQAs are within acceptable limits.  The control strategy includes control of input material 
attributes, critical process parameters, in-process controls, and product specifications. 
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as the one used for marketing. A 
bioequivalence study was performed showing bioequivalence between the clinical formulation and 
the proposed commercial formulations. 
An in-vitro dissolution method was developed for testing ivacaftor granules. The discriminatory 
power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
The primary packaging is a biaxially oriented Polyethylene 
Terephthalate/Polyethylene/Foil/Polyethylene (BOPET/PE/Foil/PE) sachet. The material complies 
with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated 
by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: preparation of ivacaftor spray-dried 
dispersion (SDD) -which comprise mixture preparation, spray drying and secondary drying-, 
blending, compression, and filling.  
The 50 mg and 75 mg strengths are prepared from the same bulk granule batches, the only 
difference is the fill amount per sachet .  
The manufacture of a SDD is a non-standard method of manufacture. Since this step of the 
manufacturing process is common to the approved Kalydeco 150 mg tablets, the MAH had 
extensive experience and provided validation data at commercial scale. 
Design spaces have been proposed for the following steps of the manufacturing process of the 
medicinal product: spray drying, secondary drying, blending and compression. The robustness of 
the process was verified during validation at commercial scale. The available development data, 
the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support 
the proposed design spaces. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
Assessment report  
EMA/670893/2020  
Page 8/61 
 
 
 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing process.  
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance, identification (IR), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), uniformity of dosage 
units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution, physical form (XRPD), water content (Karl Fischer) and microbial limits 
(Ph. Eur.)  
Batch analysis results were provided for two pilot scale batches of 50 mg granules and three pilot 
scale batches of 75 mg granules confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its 
ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. Additional batch analysis data on three 
pilot scale batches of ivacaftor granules 25 mg and 100 mg strengths used during the stability 
studies, but not proposed for marketing, were also presented. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
The MAH applied a bracketing design for the stability testing of the drug product.  
Stability data on three pilot scale batches of ivacaftor granules 25 mg and 100 mg stored under 
long term conditions for twelve months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to six months under 
accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. These 
strengths are not proposed for marketing, but since the different strengths (25, 50, 75 and 100 
mg) are only differentiated by the amount of granules filled into the sachet, the stability results 
from the extremes are considered representative to those from the strengths proposed for 
marketing. Samples were tested for appearance, water content, assay, degradation products, 
dissolution and physical form. 
Supportive six-month stability data from two pilot scale batches of 50 mg granules and one pilot 
scale batch of 75 mg granules stored under long term (25 ºC / 60% RH) and accelerated (40 ºC / 
75% RH) conditions were also provided. Samples were tested for appearance, water content, 
assay, degradation products, dissolution, physical form and microbial limits.  
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
All results met the acceptance criteria for the attributes evaluated at all test points under all 
storage conditions. 
In addition, an in-use stability of ivacaftor granules in food was conducted as part of the stability 
program. Batches of 25 mg and 100 mg ivacaftor granules were mixed with food (e.g. applesauce, 
yogurt, puréed vegetable, water) and tested after 1-hour contact time at room temperature. 
Chemical and physical stability of granules mixed with food was evaluated by testing assay and 
degradation products, dissolution, and physical form. All results met the acceptance criteria for the 
attributes evaluated.  Therefore, the in-use stability results support the administration of ivacaftor 
granules in food. 
Based on available stability data, a shelf-life of two years and storage below 30 °C stated in the 
SmPC are acceptable.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the 50 mg and 75 mg granules developed 
to enable administration of ivacaftor to pediatric population has been presented in a satisfactory 
manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product 
quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The MAH has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and their 
manufacturing process. Design spaces have been proposed for several steps in the manufacture of 
the finished product. The design spaces have been adequately verified. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
n/a 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and toxicological characteristics of ivacaftor have been 
previously described. Based on the nonclinical safety evaluation, ivacaftor was considered to be 
safe for chronic use in juvenile and adult patients for the treatment of CF. This line extension does 
not contain new non-clinical studies. The current submission proposes to expand the approved 
indications to paediatric patients from 2 to 5 years.  The age group  from 2 to 11 years defined as 
children but the relevant CHMP guideline (Guideline On Guideline On The Role Of Pharmacokinetics 
In The Development Of Medicinal Products In The Paediatric Population,  
EMEA/CHMP/EWP/147013/2004) emphasizes that  the children group is not homogenous and 
children aged 2-4 years is “probably the least predictable within this group.”  The MAH justified 
that absorption/distribution/metabolism/elimination (ADME) processes have no role in fate of 
ivacaftor in the human body. There is no pharmacokinetic result which would suggest that ADME of 
ivacaftor would be significantly altered in the 2-6 age group compared to older children or adults. 
The lens opacities (cataracts) observed in the previously submitted and evaluated juvenile rat 
toxicity study (VX-770-TX-025) were considered ivacaftor-related. No cataractogenic potential for 
ivacaftor was detected in previous chronic toxicity studies using rats as young as 7 weeks old at 
the start of dosing and dogs as young as 3.75 months old at the start of dosing. In the former peri-
postnatal toxicity study in rats, there were no eye opacities in the offspring however it is known 
that ivacaftor concentration in rat milk exceeds that is in maternal plasma. The cataract 
observations in very young rats are not likely to be applicable to humans aged 2 through 5 years 
because human eye development is significantly more advanced prior to birth than in the rat. Thus, 
this finding is considered to have little relevance to infants and children. No concerns regarding 
hepatotoxicity were raised in toxicology studies. In a juvenile rat toxicity study (VX-770-TX-025) 
there was no ivacaftor-related difference in liver weights of males and females in the 10, 25, and 
50 mg/kg/day groups at the PND 35 or 63 necropsies; neither did ivacaftor cause macroscopic or 
Assessment report

Page 10/61 
 
 
 
microscopic findings of the liver at the PND 35 and 63 necropsies. There were no ivacaftor-related 
alterations in serum chemistry parameters. In a 12-months toxicity study in dogs (VX-770-TX-011) 
beagle dogs no ivacaftor-related adverse effects were observed on body weight, food consumption, 
hematology, coagulation parameters, or in the ophthalmology, urinalysis or organ weights. There 
were no ivacaftor-related macroscopic or microscopic findings in the tissues and organs of any dog 
examined, no differences in liver weights and no macroscopic or microscopic effects on the liver. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In terms of the environmental aspects, the extension of the current indication of Kalydeco results in 
a  larger  patient  exposure  and  hence,  calculations  provided  in  the  original  environmental  phase  I 
assessment have been revised. The refined Fpen used for PECsurfacewater (PECsw) calculation is 
the  prevalence  of  non-F508del  homozygous  CF  patients  of  all  ages  in  the  EU,  which  is  calculated 
using  the  prevalence  data  of  CF  in  the  EU  according  to the  Orphanet  Report Series  2014  and the 
prevalence  data  of  F508del  homozygote  CF  patients  reported  in  the  European  CF  Society  Patient 
Registry. The refined Fpen is equal to 0.0000693 (= 0.000126 x 0.55). The prevalence data of all CF 
patients in EU has been taken as the ‘worst-case’ and this is considered adequate. Regarding the 
provided  prevalence  data  of  F508del  homozygote  CF  patients  in  EU,  the  MAH  justified  using  the 
average value of several member states instead of the highest value reported taking in account the 
high variability of this value from country to country, and that this average value is subtracted from 
the overall CF population, which is also an average value and the worst case value. This justification 
is  considered  acceptable.  The  maximum  daily  dose  used  for  PECsw  calculation  is  equal  to  the 
maximum  daily  dose  averaged  proportionally  over  age  groups  above  and  below  5  years,  which  is 
obtained multiplying the adult daily dose of 300 mg with the sum of fraction of adult daily doses for 
patients <5 years of age and for all patients >5 years of age. For this calculation, 150 and 300 mg 
are considered as the maximum daily dose for all patients <5 years of age and for all patients >5 
years of age, respectively, as well as the proportion of CF patients <5 years of 12% according to 
Mehta et al 2010. The sum of fraction of adult daily doses for patients <5 years of age and for all 
patients >5 years of age is equal to 0.94, and the DOSEai is equal to 282 mg/day. This approximation 
is considered acceptable. Using WASTEWinhab and DILUTION default values, as well as the maximum 
daily dose and the refined Fpen values calculated above, the calculated PECsw is equal to 0.00977 
μg/L. Since the ivacaftor PECsw is below the action limit of 0.01 μg/L, no phase II environmental 
fate  and  effect  analysis  is  required.  Therefore  ivacaftor  is  not  expected  to  pose  a  risk  to  the 
environment when used in the extended indication.  
The nonclinical profile of ivacaftor was considered to be sufficiently characterised.  
2.3.1.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  pharmacologic,  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicological  characteristics  of  ivacaftor  have  been 
previously described. Based on the nonclinical safety evaluation, ivacaftor was considered to be safe 
for chronic use in juvenile and adult patients. No new non-clinical studies were sudmitted. The rat 
juvenile toxicity study, in which the cataract findings were determined, was designed and conducted 
to assess the potential for additional risk of ivacaftor treatment in patients with CF who are <2 years 
of age. Other than the eye opacity finding, the results did not indicate any specific target organ for 
toxicity, suggesting that ivacaftor would be well tolerated in patients from 2 through 5 years of age. 
No concerns regarding other organ toxicities were raised in toxicology studies. The use of ivacaftor 
in the proposed larger population does not lead to a significant increase of the current environmental 
exposure and ivacaftor is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based on the non-clinical discussions provided by the MAH, the CHMP considered the non-clinical 
profile of ivacaftor sufficiently characterised and no additional measures or investigations are 
necessary. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical development programme was designed to support the proposed to extension of the 
approved indications in CF patients 6 years of age and older to include paediatric patients 2 
through 5 years of age. The proposed formulation for the treatment of 2-5 year olds includes 50-
mg and 75-mg strength ivacaftor granules and the proposed doses are 50 mg every 12 hours for 
patients weighing <14 kg and 75 mg q12h for patients weighing ≥14 kg to <25 kg . A 2-part, 
open-label, phase 3 study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of 
ivacaftor in subjects with CF 2-5 year of age who have a CFTR mutation that causes a CFTR gating 
defect. The results of this study are the key for this submission. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. The MAH has 
provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried 
out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
Studies supporting the major milestones in the overall ivacaftor clinical development program are 
described below.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical Methods 
The analytical validation methods were assessed previously. Narratives on performance 
characteristics of assay validation, QC are provided as they were necessary to confirm that minor 
changes in the method did not affect the validity of the method. Sample analysis were performed 
at two analytical sites in study VX12-770-108, hence, a formal cross-validation was conducted 
between the DMPK and Covance Laboratories. The results of the cross-validation experiment 
Assessment report  
EMA/670893/2020  
Page 13/61 
 
 
 
 
showed that data were comparable between the two laboratories and it was, therefore, determined 
to be acceptable to combine for plasma concentration data generated at two different laboratories. 
All samples were analysed within the demonstrated long-term stability period. In-study validation 
was conducted for the individual studies. The reasons for the reanalysis of samples are acceptable 
for all studies. Incurred Samples Re-assay (ISR) was evaluated by additional analyses on a 
selection of samples plasma for all analytes. The results demonstrated reproducibility as of the 
incurred sample repeats met the acceptance criteria (± 20%). The ISR was not performed for 
study VX12-770-108 Part A, but it was performed in Part B. 
Bioavailability studies  
Study VX12-770-012 (Study 012) 
This  study  was  assessed  previously  and  the  results  showed  that  administration  of  the  prototype 
granule formulation with a high-fat meal resulted in an increase in exposure of ivacaftor with a 3.4-
fold increase in AUC0-∞ (90% CI: 2.90, 4.00) and a 3.3-fold increase in Cmax (90% CI: 2.68, 4.09). 
A comparable food effect was observed for the tablet formulation, which had a 3.0-fold increase in 
AUC0-∞  (90%  CI:  2.56,  3.48)  and  a  3.9-fold  increase  in  Cmax  (90%  CI:  3.12,  4.86).  In  the  fed 
state, the prototype granule formulation had lower exposures than the tablet formulation with AUC0-
∞ being 32% lower (GLSMR: 0.685, 90% CI: 0.588, 0.797); and Cmax being 41% lower (GLSMR: 
0.588,  90%  CI:  0.475,  0.727).  In  the  fasted  state,  the  prototype  granule  formulation  had  lower 
exposures  than  the  tablet  formulation  with  AUC0-∞  being  39%  lower  (GLSMR:  0.610,  90%  CI: 
0.518, 0.717) and Cmax being 34% lower (GLSMR: 0.658, 90% CI: 0.528, 0.818). 
Study VX12-770-015 (Study 015) 
This was a Phase 1, randomized, open-label, 4-sequence, 4-period, cross-over study using a 
Williams’ design (see the table below) with a washout of at least 7 days. This study was designed 
to investigate the relative BA of 150-mg ivacaftor as granule formulation versus the film-coated 
ivacaftor tablet formulation in the fed state, the effect of food on the BA of 150-mg ivacaftor as 
granule formulation, and the dose proportionality of the ivacaftor granule formulation between 50 
and 150 mg in the fed state. A total of 20 subjects (all male) were randomized and received at 
least 1 dose of ivacaftor in the study. Nineteen (95.0%) subjects completed the study and 1 
(5.0%) subject discontinued the study for non-AE reasons.  
PK parameters, summarized by treatment, are presented in the table below. The ivacaftor PK 
parameters obtained with T1F were similar to those obtained with RF. The median tmax and mean 
t1/2 were comparable between T1F and RF.  
Assessment report  
EMA/670893/2020  
Page 14/61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The relative BA was only evaluated in the fed condition since the granule formulation should be 
administered in the fed condition in the clinical setting as a result of the significant food effect 
observed on the food interaction study (study 012) for both, tablet and prototype granules 
formulations. In addition, ivacaftor should be taken with fat-containing food, as advised by the 
SmPC.  
Based on these analyses, the granule formulation is considered comparable to the film-coated 
tablet formulation under fed conditions, although the 90% CI for Cmax is slightly outside of the 
conventional 90% CI (0.750, 1.12). 
As it is expected the granule formulation administered with food significantly increased ivacaftor 
exposure (AUC: approx. 3-fold and Cmax approx. 3.7-fold) and resulted in longer median tmax and 
shorter mean t1/2. A comparable food effect was observed for the tablet formulation, which had a 
3.0-fold increase in AUC0-∞ and a 3.9-fold increase in Cmax. As the magnitude of food effect for 
the final granule formulation is similar to that of the 150-mg tablet when administered with a high-
fat meal relative to fasted conditions, the proposed dosage and administration directions for 
Kalydeco granules indicate that they are to be administered with fat-containing food, the same as 
Kalydeco 150-mg tablets. 
For the granule formulation in the fed state the increase in ivacaftor exposure from 50 mg to 150 
mg was dose proportional for AUC close to 1 and 90% CI within (0.80, 1.25). Lack of dose-
proportionality was observed for Cmax in the dose-normalized relative bioavailability analysis and 
the power model analysis. However, this deviation is not considered clinically relevant because the 
mean deviation is only a 15%. The intra-subject variability was obtained from the linear mixed 
effects model analysis on T1F and T2F. The intra-subject variability obtained from this analysis was 
15%, 15%, and 24% for ivacaftor AUC0-∞, AUC0-tlast, and Cmax respectively, when the granule 
formulation was administered in the fed state. The inter-subject variability was 32% for AUC0-∞. 
Population pharmacokinetics modelling  
Due to the sparse PK sampling schedule used in study 108, a population PK model that describes 
ivacaftor disposition was utilized for evaluation of PK in children 2-5 years of age. For the model 
development data in children 2-5 years old were combined with data from healthy adult volunteers 
and patients 6 years of age and older with CF. In summary, ivacaftor PK was described by a two-
compartment model with zero-order delivery to the absorption compartment and subsequent first-
order absorption. The typical estimates (95% CI) of final PK model parameters for the reference 
covariate effects (70 kg, male, 18 years, white race, and CF patient) were 16.4 (15.5, 17.4) L/hr 
for apparent (oral) clearance (CL/F), 165 (150, 181) L for apparent (oral) central volume of 
distribution (Vc/F), 81.7 (59.7, 99.0) L for apparent (oral) peripheral volume of distribution (Vp/F), 
12.1 (9.24, 14.2) L/h for apparent (oral) intercompartmental clearance (Q/F), 3.09 (2.94, 3.21) h, 
Assessment report  
EMA/670893/2020  
Page 15/61 
 
 
 
 
 
for zero-order dose duration (D1) and 0.483 (0.402, 0.557) h-1 for first-order absorption rate (ka). 
Structural parameters were dependent on body weight. The relationship was described using an 
allometric model. Ivacaftor CL/F was 39% and 131% of the reference value of 16.4 L/h for the 
typical 20 kg and 100 kg subject, respectively, when compared to the reference subject (70 kg). 
Small differences in CL/F were observed with other covariates (age, females, non-white race, 
healthy subject); however, no reduction in the unexplained random variability was achieved in the 
final model which suggests that age, sex, patient status, and non-white race did not contribute to 
variability in ivacaftor PK in a meaningful manner. Median (min-max) AUCss and Cmin,ss predicted 
by the model for children 2 to 5 years old weighing less than 14 kg receiving 50 mg are 9840 
ng/ml.h (5120-20800) and 536 ng/ml (170-1310), respectively. For children 2 to 5 years old 
weighing at least 14 kg receiving 75 mg these are 10200 ng/ml.h (6260-22700) and 580 ng/ml 
(225-1540) respectively. Both median and mean predicted values are in the range of those 
predicted for the approved dose of ivacaftor (i.e. 150 mg BID) in adolescents (8670 ng/mL.h and 
508 ng/mL) and adults (9840 ng/mL.h and 634 ng/mL). Conversely, the values of these 
parameters predicted for children 2 to 5 years old are almost half of the value predicted for 
children 6-11 years old after the approved dose of 150 mg (18700 ng/mL.h and 1100 ng/mL).  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
For this application, no new data were provided on pharmacodynamics. This is considered 
acceptable. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK study VX12-770-015 showed that the ivacaftor PK parameters obtained with T1F (2 x 75 
mg granule) were similar to those obtained with RF (150 mg tablet) with comparable tmax and 
t1/2 in the fed conditions. Hence, the granule formulation is considered comparable to the film-
coated tablet formulation under fed conditions. As expected, the granule formulation administered 
with food showed a significantly higher ivacaftor exposure and a longer median tmax and shorter 
mean t1/2. The magnitude of food effect for the final granule formulation is similar to that of the 
150-mg tablet when administered with a high-fat meal relative to fasted conditions. The proposed 
dosage and administration for Kalydeco granules is thus similar with that of Kalydeco 150-mg 
tablets. 
The approach used to determine the PK of ivacaftor in young children enrolled in study 108 
(population PK analysis) is appropriate considering the sparse sampling schedule with the purpose 
of minimising the number of blood extractions needed. Based on the final selected model, the PK 
parameters of ivacaftor in children aged 2 through 5 years with CF and a CFTR gating mutation do 
not significantly differ from those in older children, adolescents or adults once body weight is 
considered. Clearance tends to be smaller in children than in adults. However, the exposure to 
ivacaftor - in terms of model-predicted AUC and Cmin - is similar to that predicted in adolescents 
(12-17 years old) and adults. Section 5.2 of the SmPC quotes the relevant PK parameters as 
estimated via pop-PK modelling based on the observed concentrations.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The final ivacaftor granule formulation was determined to have similar bioavailability as the 150-
mg commercial tablet and showed a significantly higher ivacaftor exposure under fed conditions. 
This effect was comparable with that observed with the tablet formulation. Ivacaftor exposure 
increased approximately proportional to dose from 50 mg to 150 mg when administered as the 
granule formulation, although for Cmax, there is a small, but clinically insignificant higher 
deviation. As the magnitude of food effect for the final granule formulation is similar to that of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/670893/2020

150-mg tablet when administered with a high-fat meal relative to fasted conditions, the proposed 
dosage and administration directions for Kalydeco granules indicate that they are to be 
administered with fat-containing food, the same as Kalydeco 150-mg tablets. No dedicated dose-
finding study was performed. Dose finding for children aged 2-5 years was based on modelling and 
simulation and based on the obtained results, the dosing regimen as currently recommended in the 
SmPC is considered acceptable. The posology in section 4.2 of the SmPC of Kalydeco granules is 
weight-based for children aged 2 years and older and weighing less than 25 kg.  
No new data have been provided regarding pharmacodynamics. This is acceptable as this extension 
of the indication refers to CFTR gating mutations.  
The CHMP considers the pharmacological profile of Kalydeco to be sufficiently characterised and 
there are no additional measures related to pharmacology. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
No dedicated dose-finding studies have been performed. Study 108 was a 2-part study. The main 
objective of Part A was to evaluate the PK of multiple-dose (4-day period) administration of 
ivacaftor in subjects 2 through 5 years of age and to confirm (or adjust if necessary) the doses for 
Part B. No dose adjustment was deemed necessary and consequently in Part B the same posology 
was administered. The doses administered in study 108 Part A were chosen based on similar in 
vitro potency of ivacaftor toward mutations that cause gating defects and the efficacy and safety 
results of dosing with 150-mg ivacaftor q12h in subjects 6 years of age and older in Studies 102 
and 103. Population PK analyses were conducted by incorporating the effect of weight on ivacaftor 
PK using an allometric model. For dose selection in subjects 2 through 5 years of age, simulations 
were performed to target exposure parameters minimum observed concentration (Cmin) and area 
under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) similar to that observed in adults; and a median 
Cmin of at least 423 ng/mL concentration that results in 90% of the maximum effect (EC90) and 
an AUC not exceeding the AUC observed in subjects 6 to 11 years of age. PK results from Part A 
were incorporated into the population PK model to confirm the appropriateness of the doses for 
further evaluation in Part B. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
The application for the extension of the indication of Kalydeco to children aged 2 to 5 years is 
based on a single study as follows: 
Protocol VX11-770-108 (study 108): A Phase 3, 2-Part, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Safety, 
Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Ivacaftor in Subjects With Cystic Fibrosis Who Are 2 
Through 5 Years of Age and Have a CFTR Gating Mutation. 
This was a Phase 3, open-label, 2-part study as depicted in figure below: 
Assessment report  
EMA/670893/2020  
Page 17/61 
 
 
 
Study 108 was designed to assess safety, PK, and PD of ivacaftor treatment (50-mg for subjects 
<14 kg; or 75-mg for subjects ≥14 kg; q12h) in subjects 2 through 5 years of age who have a 
CFTR gating mutation in at least 1 allele. Part A was designed to evaluate the safety and PK of 
multiple-dose (4-day period) administration of ivacaftor in subjects 2 through 5 years of age and to 
confirm (or adjust if necessary) the doses for Part B. Part B was designed to evaluate the safety, 
PK, PD, and efficacy of ivacaftor in subjects 2 through 5 years of age after 24 weeks of treatment.

Treatments 
In Parts A and B of Study 108, subjects weighing <14 kg on Day 1 were administered 50-mg 
ivacaftor every 12 hours (q12h) and subjects weighing ≥14 kg on Day 1 were administered 75-mg 
ivacaftor q12h. The doses in Part B were confirmed before the start of Part B based on the 
preliminary analysis of PK data from Part A, along with safety and tolerability data from Part A. No 
dose adjustments were made in Part B of this study as a consequence of weight change. Each dose 
of ivacaftor granules was mixed with approximately 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of applesauce, pureed 
carrots, nonfat yogurt, or water and administered orally with fat-containing food, such as a 
standard “CF” high-calorie, high-fat meal or snack. Subjects in Study 108 continued to receive their 
usual, prescribed CF therapy in addition to ivacaftor. The use of hypertonic saline was allowed.

•  Safety, as determined by adverse events, clinical laboratory values (serum chemistry, 
hematology, and coagulation studies), ECGs, vital signs, and ophthalmologic examinations. 
Secondary Endpoints: 
•  PK parameter estimation of ivacaftor and metabolites M1 and M6 
•  Absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through 24 weeks of ivacaftor treatment: 
sweat chloride was collected in Part B at baseline and 4 post-baseline time points (Weeks 2, 8, 16, 
and 24). Sweat chloride results (including changes from baseline) were analyzed as a continuous 
variable using descriptive summary statistics and presented by scheduled visit and treatment (each 
dose level and overall). The mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride was also 
displayed in a waterfall plot by scheduled visit and treatment. Change from baseline in sweat 
chloride was categorized by the following rules: <5 mmol or ≥5 mmol, <10 mmol or ≥10 mmol, 
<15 mmol or ≥15 mmol, <20 mmol or ≥20 mmol. 
•  Absolute change from baseline in weight at 24 weeks of ivacaftor treatment: weight (kg) was 
collected in Part B at baseline and 7 post-baseline time points (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24). 
Weight must have been measured with shoes off and light clothing. 
•  Absolute change from baseline in stature at 24 weeks of ivacaftor treatment: stature (m) was 
collected in Part B at baseline and 7 post-baseline time points (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24). 
At 2 years of age and older, if children could stand unassisted and follow directions, stature should 
have been measured as height; otherwise, stature was measured as length. Stature must have 
been measured with shoes off and light clothing. 
•  Absolute change from baseline in body mass index (BMI) at 24 weeks of ivacaftor treatment 
Tertiary Endpoints 
•  Weight-for-age z-score/Stature-for-age z-score/BMI-for-age z-score: all 3 parameters were 
adjusted for sex and age and summarized as weight-for-age, stature-for-age, and BMI-for-age z-
scores. Z-scores were calculated using the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Growth 
Chart Equations for children and adolescents, 2 to 20 years of age. 
•  Qualitative microbiology cultures: if bacteria were found, the amount was recorded as light, 
moderate, or heavy growth. 
•  Pulmonary exacerbations: each instance of a new or changed antibiotic therapy administered for 
sinopulmonary signs and symptoms was assessed to determine if it met 1 of the 2 protocol 
definitions of pulmonary exacerbation provided in Section 9.5.5.1. All events, whether or not they 
met the definition of pulmonary exacerbation, were considered “antibiotic therapy for 
sinopulmonary signs/symptoms” (i.e., “sinopulmonary sign/symptom” events). 
•  Unplanned antibiotic therapy: this endpoint referred to all events of new or changed antibiotic 
therapy administered. The same set of variables described for pulmonary exacerbations was 
analyzed for unplanned antibiotic therapy. The definitions of count, duration, and time-to-first 
event were consistent with the definitions provided for the pulmonary exacerbation variables. 
•  Hospitalizations: the dates for hospitalizations and the reasons were collected. The definitions of 
count, duration, and time-to-first event were consistent with the definitions provided for the 
pulmonary exacerbation variables.  
•  Outpatient sick (i.e. non-study) visits: The date of each outpatient sick visit was collected. The 
definitions of count, duration, and time-to-first event were consistent with the definitions provided 
for the pulmonary exacerbation variables.  
•  Spirometry: spirometry assessments were performed in Part B at qualified study sites at the 
following study visits: Day -28 to Day-1, Day 1, Week 2, Week 8, Week 16 and week 24 for 
subjects 3 years of age or older who met the ATS/ERS acceptability criteria for preschool 
spirometry. The following parameters were determined as part of the spirometry assessment: FEV1 
(L), Forced expiratory volume in 0.50 seconds (FEV0.5), Forced expiratory volume in 0.75 seconds 
(FEV0.75), Forced vital capacity (FVC), Forced mid-expiratory flow rate (FEF25%-75% [L/sec]), 
Forced expiratory time (FET).

•  Palatability of ivacaftor granules: all subjects had their acceptance of the dose administered and 
the volume consumed recorded. All subjects were also be observed by their facial expressions and 
any spontaneous comments in regards to likes or dislikes were noted. Palatability of ivacaftor 
granules was further assessed in subjects 4 years of age and older in the study using a visual 
analog scale that incorporates a 5-point facial hedonic scale. All interviews were conducted on a 
one-on-one basis in the clinic setting. Subjects were familiarized with the scale using hypothetical 
situations before taste testing was conducted. Immediately after receiving their first dose of 
ivacaftor, subjects 4 through 5 years of age were asked to rate their degree of liking using the 
visual analog scale. 
Sample size 
In Part A, enrolment was planned for a minimum of 8 subjects. For Part A, no formal sample size 
calculations were performed, but the sample size chosen was deemed adequate to meet the PK 
objectives of this study. The sample size of a minimum of 20 subjects in Part B was based on the 
availability of the subject population and not on any statistical consideration; therefore, the study 
was not powered to detect a significant treatment effect. The sample size of minimum of 20 
subjects represented approximately 7% of the estimated number of patients with CF 2 through 5 
years of age worldwide who have the G551D and non-G551D-CFTR gating mutations in at least 1 
allele, based on data from the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry and estimates of 
subjects worldwide.  
Randomisation 
Randomisation was not conducted as this was an uncontrolled study.  
Blinding (masking) 
Blinding was not conducted as this was an uncontrolled study.  
Statistical methods 
All analyses were presented for Part A and Part B separately. For Part A, a preliminary PK analysis 
took place after all samples have been collected and bioanalysis is complete. The available data 
were used to confirm dose for use in Part B. Part A safety analyses consisted primarily of individual 
subject data listings. Efficacy analysis was applicable to Part B only. In Part A and Part B, only 
descriptive analysis of safety (and when applicable, efficacy) parameters will be performed; point 
and interval estimates will be provided where useful. 
The following subgroups were used: age group at baseline (2, 3, and 4 to 5 years of age), 
geographic region (North America and Europe), sex (female and male), and percent predicted FEV1 
severity category at baseline (<70%, ≥70% to ≤90%, >90%, and not done). Medications used in 
the study were identified as prior, concomitant, or both, according to the rules given below. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Part A: A total of 11 subjects were screened, of whom 9 subjects were enrolled and included in the 
Safety Set. Two subjects were screen-failures and did not enter the treatment period. All 9 
subjects completed the 4-day treatment period. 
Part B: A total of 37 patients were screened with 34 enrolled and included in the Safety Set, of 
whom 10 patients received ivacaftor 50 mg q 12 hours and 24 patients received 75 mg q 12hours. 
Eight of the 9 patients who participated in Part A were enrolled in Part B. A total of 33 patients 
completed the 24-week treatment period. One patient, in the ivacaftor 50 mg dose group, 
prematurely discontinued study drug treatment due to an adverse event of increased 
transaminases and did not complete the Follow-up Visit.

Recruitment 
Part A study was initiated on 08 January 2013; part B on 28 June 2013. Study was completed on  
18 March 2014. Subjects in Part A were included at 5 sites in North America. In Part B, subjects 
were included at 15 sites (11 sites in the US, 3 sites in the United Kingdom, and 1 site in Canada).  
Conduct of the study 
Final version of study protocol 108 is version 4.0 dated 08 May 2013. Four amendments were 
implemented in the initial version of the protocol. The date of the study report is 19 August 2014.  
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) version 1.0 is dated 18 March 2014, i.e. at the time when last 
subject completed the last visit. There were no changes to the planned analysis but it is noticed 
that the SAP was finalised at the same time of study completion. The adverse event grading 
system that was used in study 108 was the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent 
Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials which was considered more appropriate 
(than the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, CTCAE) for young children. The 
rationale seems to be that this system (which is mainly intended for preventive vaccine trials) is 
more appropriate for almost healthy children than the CTCAE.

The most commonly reported concomitant medications were pancreatin, salbutamol, dornase alfa, 
and sodium chloride, which were taken by over 50% of subjects overall. Antibiotics such as 
tobramycin and colistin were administered to 11.8% (4/24) subjects.  
Numbers analysed 
Planned: Part A: A minimum of 8 subjects (minimum of 2 subjects in each of the following 3 age 
groups: 2, 3, and 4 or 5 [inclusive] years of age). Part B: A minimum of 20 subjects (minimum of 6 
subjects 2 through 3 years of age)  
Analysed: Part A: 9 subjects received at least 1 dose of ivacaftor and were included in the Safety 
Set. Part B: 34 subjects received at least 1 dose of ivacaftor and were included in the Safety Set.

The results from the Phase 3, placebo-controlled studies in subjects with the G551D-CFTR mutation 
(Studies 102 and 103) and subjects with a non-G551D-CFTR mutation that causes CFTR gating 
defects (Study 111, Part 1) are summarized in the following table that shows the absolute mean 
changes from baseline of select efficacy endpoints to provide context for the efficacy results of

*Overall (both ivacaftor dosing groups combined) results 
It should be noticed that the above mean changes are not those corresponding to model-based 
treatment differences which seems adequate for the purpose of comparing these results to those of 
study 108 in which descriptive statistics have been used for the calculation of mean changes. The 
MAH also present the results corresponding to model-based differences (the primary analysis 
foreseen in the Statistical Analysis Plan of studies 102, 103 and 111). Model-based differences are 
generally of an inferior magnitude with respect to those calculated by means of descriptive 
statistics. Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) (i.e. revised Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire, CFQ-R) was 
not assessed in study 108. This is reasonable taking into account that no validated PRO 
instruments exist for children with CF <6 years of age.  An alternative would have been the use of 
the parent version of the CFQ-R. The magnitude of the changes in the different endpoints assessed 
in studies 102, 103 and 111 is, in general, of a similar magnitude as that seen in study 108 with 
the exception of the mean change in percent predicted FEV1. Interpretation of the results in 
change in percent predicted FEV1 needs to consider the high degree of variability in the 
measurements due to the technical difficulties of conducting spirometry in small children and also 
the small number of patients with baseline and on-treatment spirometry data. The definitions of

pulmonary exacerbations in study 108 were different than the definition of pulmonary exacerbation 
in studies 103 and 111; therefore, the number and event rates for pulmonary exacerbations in 
study 108 cannot be compared to those in studies 103 and 111.

Supportive study 
Palatability assessment was performed in Part A and Part B of the study following administration of 
the first dose of study drug. In Part A, all 9 subjects in the 2 ivacaftor dose groups fully consumed 
the first dose of study drug. In Part B, two patients (one per group) did not provide any palatability 
assessment, i.e. their assessments were missing. Eight and 23 patients in the ivacaftor 50- and 75-
mg groups fully consumed the first dose of study drug. Seven and 11 respectively expressed that 
they like it very much while 3 patients in the ivacaftor 75-mg group dislike it very much. This was 
similar to the assessment made by the parents and also similar to the assessment made by 
Assessment report  
EMA/670893/2020  
Page 36/61 
 
 
 
  
patients of 4 years of age and older using a visual analog scale with a 5-point facial hedonic scale. 
Therefore, it would appear that for the older children the formulation was not as palatable as for 
young children although for them parents are assumed to play an important role in the 
assessment. 
The method of administration in the proposed SmPC states that “Each dose should be mixed with 5 
mL of age-appropriate soft food or liquid”. The size of the individual granules (2 mm) provides 
reasonable assurance that they can be swallowed with food without stimulating the urge to chew 
them. However, each granule contains 1.92 mg of ivacaftor. Therefore, the number of granules per 
sachet is 26 (50 mg) or 39 (75 mg). Swallowing them may create some difficulties for young 
children due to the high number of granules. In study 108, granules were provided in a capsule 
and parents were instructed on how to empty the capsules and administer ivacaftor with food. The 
MAH confirmed that the number of granules per capsule in study 108 is the same as in the case of 
the dosage form to be marketed, which is granules in sachet and that the volume of food or liquid 
used for administration is also identical to that used in the clinical trials. Instructions for age-
appropriate soft food or liquid are included in the Product Information.   
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application for the extension of the indication of Kalydeco to children aged 2 to 5 years is 
based on a single study VX11-770-108 (study 108): A phase 3, 2-part, open-label study to 
evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ivacaftor in subjects with cystic 
fibrosis who are 2 through 5 years of age and have a CFTR gating mutation. 
Part A was designed to evaluate the safety and PK of multiple-dose (for a 4-day period) 
administration of ivacaftor and to confirm (or adjust if necessary) the doses for Part B. Part B was 
designed to evaluate the safety, PK, PD, and efficacy of ivacaftor after 24 weeks of treatment. All 
patients who completed 24 weeks of study drug treatment were eligible to enrol in the open-label 
treatment arm of the extension study of ivacaftor (Study 109). Children aged 2 to less than 6 years 
with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis as shown by the presence of a sweat chloride value ≥60 mmol/L 
by quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis OR 2 CF-causing mutations and who had one of the 
following CFTR gating mutations in at least one allele (G551D, G178R S549N, S549R G551S, 
G970R, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, G1349D) were eligible for enrolment.  
The primary objectives of study 108 were safety and PK. Secondary efficacy endpoints were 
collected in part B as follows: absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride, weight, stature and 
BMI at week 24. There were also a number of tertiary (exploratory) endpoints such as pulmonary 
exacerbations, unplanned antibiotic therapy, hospitalisation, unscheduled visits to hospital and 
spirometry assessments. Palatability of the formulation in the target population was an exploratory 
endpoint. 
A single population for analysis was defined, i.e. the safety set in both Part A and Part B defined as 
all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug (i.e., ivacaftor). Safety analyses of Part A 
and Part B were conducted separately. Efficacy analyses were only performed on Part B. Lack of 
randomisation is this study was justified on the basis that extrapolation of efficacy from adults and 
older children to these younger children was feasible. From this perspective, pharmacokinetics and 
safety of ivacaftor are the most appropriate primary endpoints for study 108. Change in percent 
predicted FEV1, the recommended primary endpoint to be used for registration studies as outlined 
in the CHMP guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of cystic 
fibrosis (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/9147/2008), is not feasible in children from birth through 5 years of age 
because FEV1 involves spirometry, which can only be performed in children 6 years of age and 
older. In addition, spirometry parameters are not sufficiently sensitive to detect early

manifestations of lung disease in young children with CF and for assessing drug effects. In study 
108, preschool spirometry was conducted in accordance with American Thoracic Society and 
European Respiratory Society guidelines for patients ≥3 years of age.  
In part A, all 9 patients completed the 4-day treatment period. In part B, a total of 34 enrolled and 
included in the safety set, of whom 10 patients received ivacaftor 50 mg q 12 hours and 24 
patients received 75 mg q 12hours. Eight of the 9 patients who participated in Part A were enrolled 
in Part B. A total of 33 patients completed the 24-week treatment period. One patient, in the 
ivacaftor 50 mg dose group, prematurely discontinued study drug treatment due to an adverse 
event of increased transaminases and did not complete the follow-up visit. Baseline demographic 
and disease characteristics show that in Part A all children had a sweat chloride value well above 
the value considered as likely indicative of cystic fibrosis, i.e. >60 mmol/L. In part B, 28 (82.4%) 
were male patients and 6 (17.6%) were female patients; data from several cystic fibrosis registries 
do not show that in this age range there is a preponderance of male subjects. All children were 
diagnosed at either 0 or 1 month of age (newborn screening), with the exception of a single 
patient, who was diagnosed at the age of 2 years. Majority of children in the 50 mg group were 2 
years old and weighted a mean of 12.5 kg. The majority of subjects in the 75 mg group were 4-5 
years old with a mean body weight of 18.8 kg. The minimum values of weight/BMI suggest that 
some patients must have been undernourished. There were 32 patients with a G551D mutation 
and 2 patients with an S549N (i.e. non-G551D) gating mutation. Overall, 76.5% (26/34) had as a 
second CFTR mutation F508del.  Second CFTR mutations other than F508del were as follows: 
1471DELA (n=1), 1717-1G>A (n=1), 3905INST (n=1), 394DELTT (n=1), G551D (n=1, 
homozygous patient), R117H (n=1) and R553X (n=1). For the single patient with an R117H-CFTR 
mutation the poly-T status is 7T in both alleles. Although patients with a G970R mutation were 
eligible for inclusion none was enrolled in study 108.     
Mean sweat chloride data at baseline was available for 8 patients in the ivacaftor 50mg group and 
for 22 patients in the 75mg group: 93.13 mmol/L and 99.61 mmol/L, respectively. Given that 
symptoms and signs of lung disease may be absent during early childhood and that the correlation 
between genotype and phenotype for lung disease is weak, the fact that most children enrolled in 
study 108 had a sweat chloride above 60 mmol/L is reassuring. In Part B, all patients in the 
ivacaftor 50-mg group had CF lung disease while this figure was 95.8% in the 75-mg group. As for 
pancreatic disease, all patients in the ivacaftor 50-mg group had pancreatic insufficiency while this 
figure for the 75-mg group was 87.5%. Baseline faecal elastase-1 values were as follows: 5 
patients in the ivacaftor 50-mg group had a value below 200 µg/g indicative of pancreatic 
insufficiency while for the remaining 5 the value is unknown. In the 75-mg group, 21 patients had 
a value below 200 µg/g, 1 patient equal or above 200 µg/g and in 7 patients this value was 
unknown. Infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF was reported for two children, one in the 
ivacaftor 50-mg group and other in the 75-mg ivacaftor group. Symptoms and signs compatible 
with a clinical diagnosis of CF reported for children included in Part B of study 108 were nasal 
polyps, CF hepatic disease, CF related diabetes, failure to thrive, poor weight gain, and others. 
Children in study 108 continued to receive their usual, prescribed CF therapy in addition to 
ivacaftor. Most common concomitant medications were pancreatin/pacrelipase, salbutamol, 
dornase alfa, and sodium chloride, which were taken by over 50% of subjects overall.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Absolute change from baseline through 24 week in sweat chloride 
The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline through week 24 in sweat chloride was -47.07 
mmol/L (24.26) in the ivacaftor 50mg group (n=7/10) and -46.78 mmol/L (27.58) in the 75mg 
group (n=18/24). The decrease in sweat chloride was already evident at week 2 (fist post-baseline 
measure) and was maintained until week 24. The above results are based on 25/34 children 
Assessment report  
EMA/670893/2020  
Page 38/61 
 
 
 
(73.5%), i.e. 9 patients were excluded from the analysis, mainly due to lack of samples, since 
sampling sweat chloride in this young population is often difficult. The change from baseline in 
sweat chloride was calculated either as the change at week 24 or trough week 24. The average 
values of change through week 24 showed the same trend as the values at week 24 but with some 
exceptions, the degree of decrease from baseline is lower. The MAH clarified that both methods of 
analysis of change from baseline in sweat chloride were specified in the SAP and both analysis were 
presented. The mean (SD) baseline sweat chloride levels (97.9 [14.0] mmol/L) decreased at Week 
24 (mean absolute change from baseline, -46.9 [26.2]). Consistent with the results at Week 24, 
overall, sweat chloride levels decreased from baseline through Week 24 (mean absolute change 
from baseline, -45.5 [21.0] mmol/L). The responder analysis of sweat chloride is based on 4 
categories of change in sweat chloride through 24 week. There were 8 subjects in the ivacaftor 50-
mg group and 21 in the 75-mg group. This analysis showed that 7 (70%) and 19 (79.2%) patients 
in the ivacaftor 50- and 75-mg groups had a decrease in sweat chloride through week 24 that was 
≥ 20 mmol/L. A single patient in the 50-mg group had a decrease less than 20 mmol/L while this 
was the case for 2 patients in the 75-mg group. The three of them had the genotype 
G551D/F508del. While their average absolute change in sweat chloride value though week 24 was 
negative in the three cases, none of them exceed the threshold of 20 mmol/l. In addition, it is 
noticed that in the response provided, the change for these three patients is calculated as an 
average absolute change through week 24.   
Absolute change from baseline in weight, BMI, BMI-for-age z score and weight-for-age z-score 
The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline at week 24 in body weight was 1.00 Kg (0.42) in 
the ivacaftor 50-mg group (n=9/10) and 1.50 Kg (0.55) in the 75-mg group (n=24/24). These 
figures for BMI were as follows: 0.33 Kg/m2 (0.54) and 0.31 Kg/m2 (0.55). Regarding the 
corresponding z scores, the mean (SD) change in weight-for-age z-score at week 24 was 0.19 
(0.32) in the 50-mg ivacaftor group and 0.21 (0.23) in the ivacaftor 75-mg group. The 
corresponding 95%CI was (-0.06, 0.43) and (0.11, 031). For BMI-for-age z-score these values 
were as follows: 0.46 (0.46) and 0.34 (0.42) respectively. The corresponding 95%CI were as 
follows: (0.11, 0.81) and (0.16, 052). The MAH compared the mean absolute change from baseline 
at week 24 with 0, based on a 1-sample test. The only difference that was not statistically 
significant was the mean change in weight-for-age z-score in the ivacaftor 50-mg group 
(p=0.1192).     
Absolute change from baseline in height and in height-for-age z-score 
The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline at week 24 in stature was 2.5 cm (1.45) in the 
ivacaftor 50-mg group (n=9/10) and 3.5 cm (0.93) in the 75-mg group (n=23/24). The mean (SD) 
change in stature-for-age z-score at week 24 was -0.25 (0.45) in the 50-mg ivacaftor group and 
0.18 (0.22) in the ivacaftor 75-mg group. The 95%CI for the absolute change in stature was as 
follows: (1.43, 3.66) and (3.14, 3.94) for the 50- and 75-mg ivacaftor groups. For the change in 
stature-for-age z-score the 95%CI was (-0.59, 0.10) and (-0.01, 0.17) respectively. Height 
increase seems to be reduced compared to WHO data in the lower ivacaftor dose group (WHO 
data, median: 5 cm/6 months and 4.5 cm/6 months in girls and boys aged 2-3 years, 
respectively).   
Nutritional status has a significant effect on pulmonary disease progression and survival in patients 
with cystic fibrosis.  While acute malnutrition is associated with weight loss, chronic malnutrition 
also affects height. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recommends the use of BMI for children aged 2 
years and above as indicator of their nutritional status. Data from CF registries show consistent 
pattern of lower BMI percentile values at higher ages. Children in the age range from 2 to 6 years 
are (as a group) usually above the 50th percentile for BMI. The 10 children enrolled in study 108 in 
the 50-mg ivacaftor group had at baseline a mean (SD) BMI-for-age z score of -0.23 (0.57) that at 
Assessment report  
EMA/670893/2020  
Page 39/61 
 
 
 
week 24 increased up to 0.19 (0.48). However, the stature–for-age z score remained at week 24 
below the median percentile as shown by a mean z-score of -0.25 (but from -0.90 at baseline).  
Overall, the assessment of nutritional status is incomplete and its interpretation difficult in the 
absence of information about specific interventions to improve the nutrition of children enrolled in 
study 108. Furthermore, due to the lack of placebo control, the magnitude of effect of ivacaftor 
treatment cannot be clearly assessed on nutritional status in this age group. In spite of this, the 
data provided show, in general, an improvement of the nutritional status of these young children 
that occurs in addition to the interventions aimed at improving growth and of the administration of 
pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.  
Qualitative Microbiology Cultures 
The MAH conclusion that no obvious trends were observed in terms of new growths or shifts to 
higher or lower amounts of each microbe is, overall, acknowledged based on the data provided. 
The pattern of lung colonisation based on qualitative microbiology cultures from oropharyngeal 
swabs is consistent with that described for young children, with S aureus and H influenzae 
appearing in the early years and P aeruginosa usually later in life.  
Pulmonary exacerbations 
Two definitions of pulmonary exacerbations were used. Definition 2 was more conservative than 
Definition 1. The common criterion both definitions had to meet was the need for treatment with 
oral, inhaled or IV antibiotics. According to definition 1, 2 (20%) patients in the ivacaftor 50-mg 
group had 5 pulmonary exacerbations (event rate: 0.54) while in the 75-mg group 13 (54.2%) 
patients had 30 pulmonary exacerbations (event rate: 1.24). Of these, a patient in each group 
received IV antibiotics and required hospitalisation. Approximately 80% patients in the ivacaftor 
50-mg group were event-free between Days 113 and 168. This figure in the 75-mg group was 
45%. The apparent difference in time-to-first pulmonary exacerbation between the ivacaftor 50 mg 
and ivacaftor 75 mg groups may be explained by the low number of subjects (≤10 subjects) in the 
ivacaftor 50 mg group. According to definition 2, 5 subjects had a total of 6 pulmonary 
exacerbations: 1 subject with 2 pulmonary exacerbations in the ivacaftor 50-mg group and 4 
subjects with 4 pulmonary exacerbations in the ivacaftor 75-mg group. No subjects were 
hospitalized or required IV antibiotic therapy due to pulmonary exacerbations. Overall, the 
interpretation of data of time-to-first pulmonary exacerbation is hampered by the small number of 
patients. In general, very few events are expected in this young population of CF patients.  
Spirometry 
Percent predicted FEV1 was measured in 20 children, 3 in the 50-mg ivacaftor group and 17 in the 
75-mg group. The mean (SD) change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 at week 24 was -
12.47 (30.12) in the ivacaftor 50-mg group and 4.30 (14.78) in the 75-mg group. Percent 
predicted FEV1 decreased during the treatment period in the ivacaftor 50 mg group. The MAH 
clarified that these 3 patients had respiratory-related AEs during the treatment period that may 
have affected the spirometry measurements. Overall, interpretation of the results in change in 
percent predicted FEV1 needs to consider the high degree of variability in the measurements due 
to the technical difficulties of conducting spirometry in young children and also the small number of 
patients with baseline and on-treatment spirometry data. This is shown by the wide 95%CI that 
ranges from −87.27 to 62.35 in the ivacaftor 50-mg group. It has been suggested that for young 
children forced expiratory volumes at 0.75 second (FEV0.75) or at 0.5 second (FEV0.5) are more 
appropriate than (percent predicted) FEV1. The mean absolute change in percent predicted 
FEV0.75 shows the same trend of change as percent predicted FEV1.   
Faecal Elastase-1 
Assessment report  
EMA/670893/2020  
Page 40/61 
 
 
 
Faecal elastase-1 is used clinically to diagnose pancreatic exocrine insufficiency in CF patients. The 
diagnostic cut-offs for pancreatic exocrine function below 200 µg/g indicate pancreatic insufficiency.  
Baseline faecal elastase-1 values were as follows: 5 patients in the ivacaftor 50-mg group had a 
value below 200 µg/g while for the remaining 5 the value was unknown. In the 75-mg group, 21 
patients had a value below 200 µg/g, 1 patient equal to or above 200 µg/g and in 2 patients this 
value was unknown. The mean (SD) change from baseline in faecal elastase-1 at Week 24 was 
127.9 µg/g (191.84) in the ivacaftor 50-mg group (n=5) and 93.5 µg/g (128.28) in the 75-mg 
ivacaftor group (n=22). The overall (both groups combined) mean (SD) absolute change from 
baseline in faecal elastase-1 was 99.8 μg/g (138.35). Although it is claimed that there was a 
substantial increase from baseline in this parameter, which may suggest an improved pancreatic 
function, it is not known how  this translates clinically, e.g. if a reduction of the dose of pancreatic 
enzyme replacement therapy could be considered. In addition, levels of faecal elastase-1 are not 
available at baseline for 5 (50%) patients in the 50-mg ivacaftor group and for two patients in the 
75-mg ivacaftor group. Additional data were requested for these 7 patients. Two of them do not 
have any value available either in study 108 or 109. Of the remaining 5 patients, 2 of them had at 
all available points in time in study 108 values well below 200 µg/g. Two additional patients had at 
week 24 and at week 48 of study 109 a value above 200 µg/g (as compared to values below 200 
µg/g in prior visits in study 108). Finally, values for the last patient increased progressively during 
study 108 and study 109 but were still below 200 µg/g. A total of 6 patients with initial faecal 
elastase-1 values below 50 µg/g in study 108 experienced an increase at 24 weeks in study 108 
that was ≥200 µg/g (indicative of pancreatic sufficiency). However, these values were maintained 
in study 109 only in two of them. Four patients with initial faecal elastase-1 values below 200 µg/g 
in study 108 had faecal elastase-1 values ≥200 µg/g during ivacaftor treatment in study 109. For 
three of them the first available measure in study 108 was below 15 µg/g.    
In conclusion, it seems that faecal elastase-1 increased above the threshold of 200 µg/g (indicative 
of pancreatic sufficiency) in a very limited number of patients in study 108. It seems premature at 
this stage to conclude that ivacaftor is associated with an improvement in pancreatic function in 
these young children based on the current data.  
Palatability of ivacaftor granules  
Palatability assessment was performed in Part A and Part B of the study following administration of 
the first dose of study drug. In Part A, all 9 subjects in the 2 ivacaftor dose groups fully consumed 
the first dose. In Part B, two patients (one per group) did not provide any palatability assessment. 
Eight and 23 patients in the ivacaftor 50- and 75-mg groups fully consumed the first dose of study 
drug. Seven and 11 respectively expressed that they like it very much while 3 patients in the 
ivacaftor 75-mg group dislike it very much. This was similar to the assessment made by the 
parents and also similar to the assessment made by patients of 4 years of age and older using a 
visual analogue scale with a 5-point facial hedonic scale. Therefore, it appears that for the older 
children the formulation was not as palatable as for young children and parent play an important 
role in the assessment. In addition, an open-label taste profile study to characterize the sensory 
attributes of the ivacaftor paediatric granule formulation was performed in 5 healthy volunteers 
who tasted powder blends and the prototype granule formulation with foods or liquids. In 
conclusion, all evaluated foods and liquids were considered to be suitable dosing vehicles for the 
VX-770 granules from a flavour perspective. However, the gritty texture resulting from incomplete 
disintegration in low moisture foods products may be unacceptable to some patients, particularly 
infants. The method of administration is adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analysis have been performed for sweat chloride, weight, stature, and BMI by age group 
at baseline (2, 3, and 4 to 5 years of age), geographic region (North America and Europe), sex and 
Assessment report

percent predicted FEV1 severity category at Baseline (<70%, ≥70% to ≤90%, >90%, and not 
done). The MAH conclude that the results of subgroup analyses were similar to those of the Safety 
Set overall. It is noticed that the number of patients per subgroup is small limiting any conclusions 
from these subgroup analyses. As an example only 6 female patients, 4 on ivacaftor 50 mg and 2 
on 75 mg were enrolled in study 108. A review of the summary statistics provided for nutritional 
parameters by sex (given the preponderance of male patients in study 108) shows that the 
magnitude of the increase in weight- and BMI for-age z-scores was higher in female patients than 
in male patients. Regarding percent predicted FEV1, 8 patients and 7 patients in the 75-mg group 
had percent predicted FEV1 of ≥70% to ≤90% and >90% respectively. Two patients had percent 
predicted FEV1 <70%. These figures for patients on ivacaftor 50 mg were 1, 2 and none, 
respectively. With very few exceptions almost all subgroups showed an increase in their mean 
weight- and BMI-for-age z-scores.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Studies performed in CF children diagnosed by newborn screening suggest that early intervention 
is associated with an improvement in nutritional status and lung disease. It is therefore postulated 
that initiation of treatment with ivacaftor at a young age could postpone or even prevent the onset 
of clinical manifestation of CF. The MAH conducted study 108 to provide data on the safety and 
benefit of ivacaftor administered to children younger than 6 years. Study 108 was an uncontrolled 
study, which raises uncertainties regarding the accuracy of the effect of ivacaftor in the target 
population. Acceptance of this study design is made on the basis that extrapolation of efficacy from 
older children and adults to the younger children enrolled in study 108 may be feasible as efficacy 
has been proven in older age groups of patients with CF carrying G551D and several other gating 
mutations of the CFTR gene. The ICH guideline E11 (Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in 
the Paediatric Population) states that when a medicinal product is to be used in younger paediatric 
patients for the same indication as that studied in older paediatric patients, the disease process is 
similar, and the outcome of therapy is likely to be comparable, extrapolation of efficacy from older 
to younger paediatric patients may be possible. In such cases, pharmacokinetic studies in the 
relevant age groups of paediatric patients likely to receive the medicinal product, together with 
safety studies, may be sufficient to provide adequate information for paediatric use.  
In the particular case of ivacaftor, although the underlying cause of CF is the same in childhood 
and adulthood, the heterogeneity of target organs and the progression of the disease over time 
lead to clinical manifestations that vary according to age.  Sweat chloride changes are comparable 
across younger and older children. This is reassuring but insufficient given that sweat chloride 
cannot be considered as a surrogate for clinical outcome. No attempts have been performed to 
validate other possible pharmacodynamic endpoints. The assessment of secondary efficacy 
endpoints in study 108 shows, in general, consistency with the results of the prior registration 
studies of ivacaftor in older patients. The main exception refers to lung function in the 50-mg 
ivacaftor group but this observation is based on data from 3 children only, and, consequently, it 
should be viewed with caution. In an attempt to gain additional certainty, the CHMP requested two 
comparative analyses between the results seen in children enrolled in study 108 and patients with 
CF with pancreatic insufficiency receiving pancreatic enzymes, of the same age range and with 
CFTR gating mutations who had not been treated with ivacaftor and were followed in existing 
registries. However, the MAH was unable to provide the requested information during this 
procedure, but stated that these data can be captured in the ongoing long-term safety study (ANX-
001).    
The MAH was also requested to discuss what data of relevance for long term efficacy and safety 
could be extracted from existing registries and address feasibility issues, e.g. in terms of coverage 
of the target population, availability and completeness of data in relevant disease registries needed 
Assessment report  
EMA/670893/2020  
Page 42/61 
 
 
 
to define exposure, appropriate comparator treatment, relevant outcomes, and potential 
confounders related to the conduct of such study. This should have also included expectations 
regarding what size of exposed study population is achievable. In this respect the MAH argued that 
registry data may be of limited value due to the fact that the size of the target population is small 
and there is limited scope to demonstrate an impact on lung function due to both feasibility of 
assessments in very young children and their relatively well preserved lung function. However, as 
above mentioned, the MAH was of the opinion that these data could be captured in the ongoing 
long-term safety study (ANX-001).  However, this study is already ongoing and the value of a 
follow-up that is less than that of older patients is dubious. Therefore, the MAH was requested to 
discuss concrete alternatives to gather data on long-term efficacy of ivacaftor in the post-
authorisation setting. Length of follow up should be sufficient to provide insight on the evolution of 
the manifestations of the disease (including lung disease) and a control group should be 
constructed to facilitate interpretation of the results. Since the proposed ivacaftor treatment of 
children with CF is long-term, the CHMP considered that efficacy and safety data to be obtained 
from the post-authorisation study regarding such long-term treatment would be key for the 
benefit-risk balance of ivacaftor in the newly granted extension of indication. Therefore, such study 
is to be included as an obligation in Annex II of the marketing authorisation.  
The applicant accepted to perform a post-authorisation efficacy study within the US Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation (CFF) registry and the UK Cystic Fibrosis registry (this latter one as supportive data 
given the low number of patients). A protocol synopsis capturing the key elements of the design of 
this study was provided. The main objective of this study is to compare disease progression among 
children with CF who have a specified CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) 
gating mutation and are 2 through 5 years of age at the time of Kalydeco treatment initiation (142 
patients 2 through 5 years of age with 1 of the CFTR gating mutations of interest in the US CF CFF 
Patient Registry) versus disease progression in a concurrent comparator cohort of children who are 
homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation, have never received Kalydeco therapy or any other 
CFTR modulator therapy.  
Two additional (supportive) cohorts will be used for comparison: 1) historical data from an earlier 
time period of children with CF who have a specified CFTR gating mutation, aged 2 to 5 years and 
had never been exposed to Kalydeco; and 2) relevant data from the ongoing Kalydeco PASS study 
on children aged 6 to 11 years at the time of Kalydeco initiation. Potentially, the cohort of children 
who initiated treatment at the age of 6 to 11 years would enable indirect comparison of outcomes 
(included in the current PASS protocol) between cohorts starting Kalydeco earlier and later in life 
although it was acknowledged that these cohorts are not concurrent and they are inherently 
different raising a concern for channeling bias. 
Power estimations were provided to detect a difference in pulmonary exacerbation risk and 
changes in nutritional parameters under 2 scenarios (100% product uptake in the target population 
and 75% product uptake in the target population). Based on changes from baseline after 24 weeks 
of ivacaftor treatment in study 108 and assuming effect size is maintained, the MAH anticipate that 
the study will be sufficiently powered to detect changes in nutritional status. 
The effectiveness of ivacaftor with respect to lung function in young children will be assessed by 
following them for 6 years, allowing them to reach the age when lung function measurements are 
routinely performed and are more reliable. Children aged 2 years will be followed until they are 9 
years old while children aged 5 will be followed until the age of 12 years old. The following 
timelines were agreed for providing CHMP with interim analysis: Interim Analysis 1 (IA1) will be 
performed after the “enrolment” period closes (31 December 2016) and will include the description 
of baseline characteristics of patients in US and UK Kalydeco and Concurrent Comparator Cohorts 
as well as the US and UK Historical Cohort analyses and summary of relevant data from the 
ongoing PASS study on children 6 to 12 years of age at the time of Kalydeco initiation. The IA1 
Assessment report  
EMA/670893/2020

report will be submitted by 31 December 2017. Interim Analysis 2 (IA2) will be performed after 
completion of the second year of follow-up (31 December 2018), when all patients in the Kalydeco 
and Comparator Cohorts would have reached at least 4 years of age. The IA2 report will be 
submitted by 31 December 2019. Interim Analysis 3 (IA3) will be performed after completion of 
the fourth year of follow-up (31 December 2020), when all patients in the Kalydeco and 
Comparator Cohorts would have reached at least 6 years of age. The IA3 report will be submitted 
by 31 December 2021. The final analysis will be performed after completion of the sixth year of 
follow-up (31 December 2022), when all patients in the Kalydeco and Comparator Cohorts would 
have reached at least 8 years of age. The final report will be submitted by 31 December 2023.  
This study will be considered as a condition of the Marketing Authorisation in the Annex II. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
Long-term effectiveness study.  To compare disease progression among children with CF who have 
a specified CFTR gating mutation and are aged 2 through 5 years at the time of Kalydeco 
treatment initiation versus disease progression among concurrent matched cohort of children with 
CF who have never received Kalydeco treatment. Final report: December 2023. This study is 
considered to be a study imposed in accordance with Article 34 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Short-term safety data from study 108 including children with CF aged 2 to 5 years and having a 
CFTR mutation were presented. Children who completed the 24-week treatment period in Study 
108 were offered the opportunity to continue onto the ivacaftor treatment arm of Study VX11-770-
109, currently ongoing. In addition, safety data from 2 completed Phase 1 studies (Studies 012 
and 015) and from 2 completed taste profiling studies (Studies 004 and 014) are also presented, 
although their findings were considered less relevant. 
Patient exposure 
Study 108: Data from 35 children who received at least 1 dose of ivacaftor are presented. This 
includes 1 subject who was enrolled only in Part A, 8 subjects who were enrolled in both Part A and 
Part B, and 26 subjects who were enrolled only in Part B. The mean treatment duration (standard 
deviation [SD]) was 156.4 (48.90) days in the 50-mg group and 169.4 (2.64) days in the 75-mg 
group. All but 1 subject received at least 16 weeks of treatment; 1 subject in the 50-mg group 
received treatment for <4 weeks. Table below provides a summary of part B exposure to ivacaftor.

Adverse events 
Adverse  events  (AEs)  were  classified  using  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA) 
preferred terms (PTs). The grading scale “Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent 
Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials”5 was used in Study 108 by the investigator 
to assign a severity to each adverse event. 
Study 108, part A 
- Overall, 8 (88.9%) of the 9 subjects in the Safety Set had adverse events. The SOC with the 
greatest incidence of adverse events was general disorders and administration site conditions, with 
55.6% of subjects overall with adverse events in this SOC. The most commonly reported adverse 
events in this SOC was pyrexia, which occurred in 4 subjects (44.4%) overall. 
- Of the 8 subjects with adverse events, 6 subjects had mild adverse events and 2 subjects had 
moderate adverse events. No severe or life-threatening adverse events occurred. The most 
frequent adverse events were pyrexia (4 subjects), vomiting (2 subjects), rhinorrhea (2 subjects), 
and ecchymosis (2 subjects). 
- There were no SAEs or deaths. 
- There were no AEs that led to permanent discontinuation of study drug. One subject had adverse 
events (fever, abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, vomiting, and mild pancreatic enzymes 
increased) that led to temporary interruption of study drug for 1 day. 
- The majority of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were 
≤2 × upper limit of normal (ULN) and there were no bilirubin elevations. Two subjects with pre-
existing liver function test (LFT) elevations, 1 in each dose group, had maximum on-treatment ALT 
elevations >3 x to ≤5 x ULN. 
- There were no other clinically meaningful trends in clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, 
ECGs, or physical examination findings during the study. 
- Based on slit lamp examination, no subjects developed lens opacities and there were no clinically 
meaningful changes in LOCS III grading. 
Study 108, part B

Overall, 33 (97.1%) of the 34 subjects in the Safety Set had adverse events. Overall, 11 subjects 
(32.4%) had related adverse events: 3 subjects (30.0%) in the ivacaftor 50 mg group and 8 subjects 
(33.3%) in the ivacaftor 75 mg group. No deaths occurred in this study. Overall, 6 subjects (17.6%) 
had SAEs, 3 subjects in each dose group, only 1 of which (in the ivacaftor 50 mg group) was assessed 
as related to study drug and also resulted in permanent discontinuation of study drug. A total of 11 
subjects, 4 subjects (40.0%) in the ivacaftor 50 mg group and 7 subjects (29.2%) in the ivacaftor 
75 mg group, had adverse events that resulted in study drug interruption. 
Adverse events with an incidence of at least 10% subjects in either dose group were presented by 
SOC and PT. The SOC with the greatest incidence of adverse events was respiratory, thoracic, and 
mediastinal disorders, with over 80% of subjects overall with adverse events in this SOC. The most 
commonly reported adverse event in this SOC was cough, which occurred in 55.9% subjects overall 
(40% subjects in the ivacaftor 50 mg group and 62.5% subjects in the ivacaftor 75 mg group).  
The following SOCs also had adverse events with an incidence of at least 20% of subjects overall: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Infections and infestations: 58.8% subjects overall 
Gastrointestinal disorders: 44.1% subjects overall 
Investigations: 35.3% subjects overall 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: 23.5% subjects overall 
General disorders and administrative site conditions: 20.6% subjects overall 
By Preferred Term, the adverse events with the greatest incidence were generally respiratory and 
gastrointestinal in nature. The most common adverse events by PT (10% of subjects overall) were 
cough  (55.9%),  vomiting  (29.4%),  nasal  congestion  (26.5%),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection 
(23.5%),  rhinorrhea  (20.6%),  pyrexia  (17.6%),  infective  pulmonary  exacerbation  of  CF  (14.7%), 
constipation (11.8%), and rash (11.8%).  
When both dosing groups of study 108 are compared the incidence of related serious AEs was higher 
for the 50-mg group (10% versus 0%) and for drug-related AEs leading to interruption (10% versus 
4.2%).  Also  the  incidence  of  most  AEs  by  SOC  was  higher  for  the  ivacaftor  50-mg  group,  i.e., 
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (80% and 83.3%), gastrointestinal disorders (50% 
versus  41.7%),  Investigations  (50%  versus  29.2%)  and  Infections  and  Infestations  (60%  and 
58.3%). By preferred terms, the AEs with the highest incidence were cough (40% and 63% for the 
ivacaftor 50-mg and 75-mg groups, respectively), nasal congestion (40% and 21%) and vomiting 
Assessment report

(30% and 29%). Exacerbations of CF were reported in 10% and 17% of patients on ivacaftor 50 mg 
and 75 mg, respectively. The majority of subjects had adverse events that were mild or moderate in 
severity.  Of  the  33  subjects  with  adverse  events,  15  subjects  had  mild  adverse  events  and  16 
subjects had moderate adverse events. Overall, the incidence of mild and moderate adverse events 
was similar across the ivacaftor 50 mg and ivacaftor 75 mg groups.  
Approximately one-third of subjects overall had adverse events that were considered possibly related 
to study drug. All adverse events that were considered possibly related to study drug occurred in 
only 1 subject, except rash, which was reported in 2 subjects (both in the 75-mg group). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no life-threatening adverse events or deaths in this study. Two subjects, both in the 
50-mg dose group, had severe adverse events (transaminases increased [2 years old] and device-
related sepsis [3 years old]). Both of the severe adverse events were considered SAEs and were 
resolved. 
The below table presents the incidence of SAEs by SOC, PT, and age (2 years, 3 years, and 4 to 5 
years of age). A total of 7 SAEs occurred: 3 in subjects 2 years of age; 3 in subjects 3 years of 
age; and 1 in a subject 4 years of age. 
By PT, the most common SAE was infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF, which occurred in 2 
subjects who were both 3 years of age. All other SAEs occurred in no more than 1 subject overall. 
One subject who was 3 years of age had 2 SAEs (infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF and 
device-related sepsis).

Laboratory findings 
Adverse events associated with LFTs occurred in 3 subjects in the 50-mg group and 2 subjects in the 
75-mg  group.  In  one  subject  (2  years  old),  an  SAE  of  transaminases  increased  led  to  permanent 
discontinuation of study drug.  
Mean absolute changes from baseline to Week 24 for LFT parameters of alkaline phosphatase, ALT, 
AST, total bilirubin, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) are summarized in table below.  
Overall (both dosing groups combined), 5 subjects (14.7%) had a maximum on-treatment ALT or 
AST of >8 × ULN. Moderate transaminase elevations seem to be frequent in subjects with CF and 
according  to  the  MAH,  published  information  suggests  that  transaminase  elevations  are  more 
common in younger patients than in adults and particularly frequent in the first 2 to 3 years of life. 
Overall, most children in study 108  had maximum on-treatment ALT, AST, and total bilirubin values 
that were  ≤2 × ULN (82.4%, 82.4%, and 100.0%, respectively). However, while these values were 
under this threshold  for almost all children on ivacaftor 75 mg (i.e., 91%, 91% and 100%), these 
percentages were reduced to 60% for transaminase levels in children receiving ivacaftor 50 mg. In 
this dosing group 3 children (30%) had ALT >8 × ULN and 1 of them (10%) also had AST >8 × ULN. 
One child with history of previous transaminase increase during a viral illness had elevations on LTFs 
after starting ivacaftor that led to discontinuation. Two children on ivacaftor 75 mg (8.3%) had also 
ALT >8 × ULN. One child had AST>5 to ≤8 x ULN.  
The incidence of transaminase elevations across different ranges was similar for ivacaftor and 
placebo groups in moderate liver abnormalities. Study 108 shows a higher incidence of 
transaminase levels >8 x ULN in children weighing less than 14 kg that was 10 times the one seen 
in study 103 (30% versus 3.8% for ALT increase). Although it is acknowledged that the absence of 
Assessment report

a control arm in study 108 makes it impossible to know whether a similar pattern had been 
observed in young children with CF who do not receive ivacaftor, close monitoring of liver function 
in younger children should be recommended in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
There were no abnormal or potentially clinically significant ECG findings during the 24-week 
treatment period, and there were no adverse events associated with ECG abnormalities. 
Due to the finding of an increase in cataracts in juvenile rats in a nonclinical study (see section 2.3 
of this report), ophthalmologic examinations were performed at baseline, Week 12, and Week 24. 
Changes from baseline were minimal, and no clinically important trends attributable to ivacaftor 
treatment were observed. No subjects developed lens opacities during the study. One subject in 
the 75-mg group was included in the study despite a screening ophthalmological examination 
revealing Mittendorf opacity. This finding was considered congenital, nonprogressive, clinically 
insignificant, and the subject continued on treatment without any changes from baseline in respect 
to lens characteristics. Visual acuity of the left and right eyes was also measured at baseline, Week 
12, and Week 24. Changes from baseline to Week 12 and Week 24 were minimal in both dose 
groups, and no clinically important trends attributable to ivacaftor treatment were observed. 
No relevant change has been observed in coagulation parameters or in haematological parameters.  
Safety in special populations 
Data form study 108 show that the majority AEs were reported in youngest children (2 and 3 years 
old), most of them weighing less than 14 kg. It appears that AEs are more common in males than 
in females. Regarding baseline FEV1, the patients with FEV1<70% reported, more AEs except for 
cough, vomiting, upper respiratory tract infections and pulmonary exacerbations that were more 
frequent in children with FEV1>90%. The analysis for geographical regions shows that AEs were 
more common in European than in North American children. There is a significant difference 
between the two regions in exacerbations of CF (50% in Europe versus 3.8% in North America). 
This has been observed in previous trials of ivacaftor and is usually attributed to chance findings, 
however, it cannot be ruled out that other (unknown) factors could also contribute. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Ivacaftor is a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and 3A5 isoenzymes. As a consequence, any 
medicinal product that modifies CYP3A activity may impact the PK of ivacaftor. A reduction of the 
ivacaftor dose from twice a day to twice a week is recommended for coadministration with strong 
CYP3A inhibitors (150 mg twice a week for patients ≥6 years of age, 75 mg twice a week for patients 
2 to <6 years of age with a body weight ≥14 kg, and 50 mg twice a week for patients 2 to <6 years 
of age with a body weight <14 kg). A reduction in the ivacaftor dose from twice daily to once daily 
is recommended for coadministration with moderate CYP3A inhibitors (150 mg once daily for patients 
≥6 years of age, 75 mg once daily for patients 2 to <6 years of age with a body weight ≥14 kg, and 
50 mg once daily for patients 2 to <6 years of age with a body weight <14 kg). Coadministration 
with strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended. 
Ivacaftor  is  also  a  weak  CYP3A  and  permeability  glycoprotein  (P-gp)  inhibitor  and  may  therefore 
modify  the  PK  of  medicinal  products  that  are  substrates  for  CYP3A  and/or  P-gp.  In  vitro  studies 
indicated that ivacaftor has the potential to inhibit CYP2C9. Therefore, CYP3A and P-gp substrates 
such  as  benzodiazepines,  tacrolimus,  digoxin,  and  cyclosporine  should  be  used  with  caution  and 
appropriate  monitoring.  In  addition,  warfarin  should  be  used  with  caution  and  appropriate 
monitoring. The SmPC includes the above information. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In part A of study 108, nine subjects were enrolled and received at least 1 dose of ivacaftor. There 
were no adverse events that led to permanent discontinuation of study drug. A child had an 
Assessment report

adverse event of fever, abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, vomiting, and mild pancreatic 
enzymes increase that led to a temporary interruption of study drug. In part B, a child in the 50-
mg dosing group discontinued due to an adverse event oftransaminase increase while all children 
in the 75-mg group completed the follow-up visit.  
Adverse events leading to temporary interruption of ivacaftor were reported in 11 children (32.4%) 
overall, 4 (40%) in the ivacaftor 50-mg group and 7 (29.2%9 in the 75-mg group. All adverse 
events that caused temporary withdrawal of study drug were resolved by the end of the study. Two 
of these adverse vents (one per dosing group) were considered drug-related.  
Post marketing experience 
Ivacaftor is approved in the US, European Union (EU), Canada, Australia, New Zealand, 
Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. A cumulative and interval summary tabulation of serious and 
nonserious adverse reactions was provided and covers a total of 1954 patients (747970 person-
days) who received at least 1 dose of ivacaftor during the time period from the International Birth 
Date of ivacaftor  
(31 January 2012) to 23 January 2014.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The most relevant safety data for this extension of marketing authorisation originate from study 
108, which enrolled CF children aged 2 to less than 6 years with a CFTR gating mutation; one child 
was enrolled only in part A, 8 children were enrolled in parts A and B and 26 only in part B of the 
study.  
In addition, safety data from 40 adults included in bioavailability studies as well as 9 included in 
the taste profiling studies were also presented although the relevance of these data is limited as 
these were healthy adults. As a consequence, discussion on safety data focuses on study 108.  
The AEs grading system used in study 108 was the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and 
Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials which was considered more 
appropriate than the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) for young children.  
In part A of the study 108, 3 and 5 patients on ivacaftor 50mg and 75mg, respectively, reported at 
least an adverse event (AE) indicating that safety issues start very soon after treatment. Nine 
patients in part A reported a total of 42 AEs (36 by 5 patients receiving 75mg and 6 by 4 patients 
receiving 50mg). Pyrexia and rash were reported by 2 patients and a single patient respectively in 
the 50mg dose group. For the 75mg dose gastrointestinal events, pyrexia and rhinorrhoea were 
the most commonly reported AEs. Two cases of transaminase level elevations and a case of 
pancreatic enzymes increased occurred. A patient on 75mg reported an AE of fever, abdominal 
bloating, abdominal pain, vomiting and pancreatic enzymes increased that led to drug interruption. 
The CHMP requested the MAH to provide the narrative of this patient including the values of 
pancreatic enzymes because the clinical picture resembled that of an acute pancreatitis. Pancreatic 
enzyme elevations were mild although the exact values were not given. It was clarified that only a 
single ivacaftor dose was missed due to this event and, therefore, no further issues were raised in 
this respect.  Elevations of pancreatic enzymes are subject to reporting via PSURs. In the 50 mg 
dosing group an additional child was reported to have an increase in transaminases. This child had 
a serious adverse event in part B of increased transaminases that led to permanent discontinuation 
of study drug. In part A, both children had a maximum on-treatment ALT value of >3 to ≤5 x ULN.  
In part B, almost all patients reported at least an AE (100% and 95.8% for ivacaftor 50 mg and 75 
mg dosing groups, respectively). By preferred term, adverse events with the highest incidence 
were cough (40% and 63%), nasal congestion (40% and 21%) and vomiting (30% and 29%). 
Exacerbations of CF were reported in 10% and 17% of patients on ivacaftor 50mg and 75mg, 
Assessment report  
EMA/670893/2020  
Page 50/61 
 
 
 
respectively. Vomiting seems particularly frequent with 3 (30.0%) and 7 (29.2%) patients in the 
50-mg and 75-mg dosing groups reporting this adverse event. Vomiting resulted in interruption of 
ivacaftor dosing in 2 children in the 75-mg group and in a child in the 50-mg group. However, 
vomiting was considered possibly related to ivacaftor and serious only in a child treated with 75 
mg. 
In all, 11 patients (32.4%) had possibly related AEs, with only 1 of them considered as serious, 
two patients had drug-related AEs leading to study drug interruption and an additional one leading 
to permanent withdrawal. When both treatment groups are compared  it can be seen that in the 
ivacaftor 50-mg group three children (30%) had possibly related AEs, 1 of them (10%) had serious 
drug-related AEs, 1 (10%) had AEs leading to drug discontinuation and another one (10%) had 
AEs leading to drug withdrawal. In the group receiving ivacaftor 75 mg although a similar 
percentage of patients had possibly related AEs (8 [33.3%]), no patients had serious drug-related 
AEs or drug-related AEs leading to study drug withdrawal. A single patient reported drug-related 
AEs leading to study drug interruption. These data would suggest a less favourable safety profile 
for children weighing less than 14kg and treated with ivacaftor 50mg. No deaths occurred in the 
study. 
During the evaluation, the CHMP made an indirect comparison with study 103, in which children 
aged 6 to 11 years with a G551D gating mutation and treated with ivacaftor 150mg BID were 
included. Comparing to the safety data from study 103, the incidence of AEs by SOC seems similar 
to that of study 108 except for "Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders" (65.4%) that was 
lower for patients in study 103. For other AEs, percentages are quite close to those for patients on 
ivacaftor 50mg: 69.2% in "Infections and Infestations", 46.2% in "Gastrointestinal Disorders", 
50% in "Investigations, and 30.8% in "General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions". 
While it seems that the percentage of patients reporting at least one AE, or AEs related to study 
drug was similar or lower in study 103, no patients reported either serious AEs or related AEs 
leading to discontinuations or to drug withdrawal. Although the limitations of indirect comparisons 
are acknowledged the MAH was invited to comment on the apparently worse safety profile 
observed in the youngest children. The MAH stated that in study 108, the safety profile was 
consistent across the 50- and 75-mg groups and that any differences in the incidence of adverse 
events were likely artefacts of the small number of patients in the subgroups. However, the 
question also included a request to compare the safety profile of very young children in study 108 
versus that of patients enrolled in studies 102 and 103. The response provided focused on liver 
function tests which were not the goal of the question as the frequency of liver enzymes increases 
was addressed in additional questions.  
An update of section 4.8 of the SmPC was also requested in line with the principles of the SmPC 
guideline. The MAH’s updated proposal for section 4.8 includes a single table on adverse reactions 
covering all age groups and types of mutations on the basis that the safety profile does not 
markedly differ between adults, adolescents, children aged 6 to less than 12 years and children 
aged 2 to less than 6 years. However, a justification was lacking in terms of comparative data of 
adverse drug reactions across the studies that served as a basis for the approval of ivacaftor in 
patients with G551-CFTR mutations, non-G551D gating mutations and R117H mutations (the latter 
being assessed in parallel with the current procedure) as requested above. This information has 
been provided and is the basis for the current proposal of section 4.8 of the SmPC which is 
considered acceptable now.  
Laboratory parameters, including liver function testing, were monitored. In study 108 overall, most 
subjects had maximum on-treatment ALT, AST, and total bilirubin results ≤2 × ULN. In the group 
treated with ivacaftor 50mg, three children had ALT >8 × ULN and one of them also had AST >8 × 
ULN.  Two subjects on ivacaftor 75mg had ALT >8 × ULN. The MAH considered that some cases of 
hepatic enzyme increase are confounded by several factors such as the underlying CF-related 
Assessment report  
EMA/670893/2020  
Page 51/61 
 
 
 
hepatic injury, pre-treatment elevation of transaminases, antibiotic treatment, non-compliance 
with Ursodiol-treatment, or pyrexia. Indeed, confounded cases are noted by the CHMP, but several 
positive dechallenge and rechallenge suggest that ivacaftor may cause hepatocellular damage. It 
was also discussed that liver disease is a known clinical manifestation of CF and is thought to be a 
result of CFTR dysfunction in biliary tract cells. The reported prevalence of liver disease varies 
widely (from 2% to 68% in children and adolescents), which is likely to be due to the different 
definitions used, ages studied, and whether the analysis is cross-sectional versus longitudinal. 
Among patients with CF liver disease, approximately 70% have elevated liver enzymes. Annual 
patient registry data from different countries report that transaminase elevations occur in up to 
16% of patients with CF across all ages. However, the natural history of transaminase elevations in 
patients with CF is not well described in the literature, particularly for younger patients. The 
available information indicates that transaminase elevations are more common in younger patients 
with CF than in adults. A retrospective cohort study showed that abnormal transaminase levels 
were present in 84% of patients <18 years of age, compared to 16% in patients ≥18 years of age. 
Transaminase elevations in patients with CF are particularly common in the first 2 to 3 years of life 
(occurring in 38% to 53% of patients), and levels tend to normalise by 4 to 5 years of age. In 
these studies, clinically significant elevations were uncommon. The literature data refer to several 
factors that may contribute to transaminase elevations in patients with CF, such as pulmonary 
exacerbations, medications, and concurrent viral infections.  
The absence of a control arm in study 108 makes it difficult to determine whether a similar pattern 
would have been seen in young children with CF who do not receive ivacaftor. Hence, the CHMP 
requested the MAH to provide an analysis of liver function parameters by age groups based on data 
from previous Phase II/III studies, postmarketing cases and study 108. Furthermore, the MAH was 
asked to assess the temporal relationship between ivacaftor dosing and the onset/offset of LFT 
elevations, to clarify the maximum elevation of transaminases in studies 102, 103, 108, 111, and 
110 by age group and to analyse the relationship between baseline liver function tests and on-
treatment changes in liver function tests in the subset of patients with transaminase elevations by 
age groups according to the available data. Based on the response received, it appears that 
transaminase elevations >3 x ULN occurred in 15% of children of 6-11 years of age in studies 103, 
110 and 111 (placebo-controlled studies) and in 14.7% of children of 2-5 years of age in study 
108. The data by Sokol et al (1994) show that the proportion of patients of 2-5 years of age with 
elevated AST/ALT vary between 38-15% and 25-15% for AST and ALT values respectively as 
observed in CF-patients in the Colorado CF program. All clinical study data are in line with the 
literature findings; i.e. elevated LFTs are more common at lower years of age and elevated LFTs 
decline or are normalised as children grow up, whilst the registry data from UK, IE, FR and 
Australia show the opposite: the proportion of patients with elevated LFTs is higher in older 
children (10-14/12-17 years of age) compared to younger patients and the overall incidences are 
smaller than those reported from literature or ivacaftor-studies. The MAH also state that the 
registry data should be interpreted with caution since it may underestimate the true prevalence of 
LFT elevations because the majority of registries only collect a single annual LFT measurement 
from the enrolled patients. The CHMP agreed with this explanation.  
The provided data also show that there is a preferential increase of ALT compared to AST. In 
addition, while ALT elevations occurred in patients with pre-treatment elevations of liver enzymes, 
this is not the case of AST elevations, which occurred mainly in patients with no pre-treatment 
elevations. While the ALT increase seems to be of limited magnitude in older patients, the five 
patients in study 108 had elevations in ALT above 8 x ULN (with one of them having ALT of 18.15 x 
ULN and AST of 6 x ULN). Elevations of this magnitude were seen only in a child and an adolescent 
treated in the placebo controlled studies.  One of the major markers of hepatocellular damage is 
precisely ALT increase which is more liver-specific than AST. The MAH concluded that the overall 
pattern of the occurrence of transaminase elevations does not suggest an association with

Page 52/61 
 
 
 
ivacaftor. However, gating CFTR mutations are rare, the sample size and the number of cases were 
low and therefore incidence data should be interpreted with caution.  
Given the uncertainties related to the increase in transaminases and the role that ivacaftor or its 
metabolites may play, the MAH was requested to include transaminase elevations in the table of 
adverse reactions of section 4.8 of the SmPC, which has been agreed. This is also consistent with 
the FDA labelling, in which this abnormality is considered an adverse reaction. Risk minimisation 
measures are also included in section 4.4 of the SmPC and patients who develop increased 
transaminase levels should be closely monitored until the abnormalities resolve. Dosing should be 
interrupted in patients with ALT or AST of greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).      
There were no clinically important trends attributable to ivacaftor treatment identified in the 
standard digital ECGs. Given the existing concerns related to the findings in juvenile rats, 
ophthalmological examinations were performed at baseline, week 12 and week 24. No subjects 
developed opacities. Changes in visual acuity seem minimal and without clinical relevance. No 
relevant change has been observed in coagulation parameters or in haematological parameters.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
No new adverse events have been identified following the revision of safety data of study 108. 
Quantitative data suggest, however, that some adverse events such as vomiting may be more 
frequently reported by young patients. Regarding whether the data provided show that the safety 
profile is worse in the subset of children receiving ivacaftor 50 mg (i.e. with a lower body weight), 
it is concluded that this may be influenced by the small number of patients enrolled in study 108 in 
this dosing group. Cross-comparison of study 108 versus studies in older children, adolescents and 
adults with gating mutations suggest that the safety profile of ivacaftor is similar justifying that a 
single table of adverse reactions is included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. The main difference in the 
safety profile refers to the increase in liver transaminases in younger children (see below).  
Five cases of ALT or AST increase above 8 x ULN occurred in this study. One of them required 
ivacaftor permanent discontinuation but the remaining 4 could resume ivacaftor dosing and rolled 
over to study 109 in which 3 of them remain. The comparative data provided for liver function tests 
in the ivacaftor studies show that transaminase elevations >3 x ULN occurred in 15% of children of 
6-11 years of age in studies 103, 110, and 111 (placebo-controlled studies) and in 14.7% of 
children of 2-5 years of age in study 108. Clinical study data are in line with the literature finding 
that elevated LFTs are more common at lower years of age and elevated LFTs decline or are 
normalised as children grow up. Furthermore, the overall pattern of the occurrence of 
transaminase increases does not suggest an association with ivacaftor. However, assessment of 
individual cases suggests positive dechallenge and rechallenge events. In addition, gating CFTR 
mutations are rare, the sample size and the number of cases were limited and therefore incidence 
data should be interpreted with caution. From a safety perspective as a potential causal 
relationship with ivacaftor cannot be completely ruled out, the CHMP requested that liver function 
tests increase should be included in the table of section 4.8 of the SmPC displaying adverse 
reactions to ivacaftor. In conclusion, it is considered by the CHMP that potential liver toxicity can be 
managed trough appropriate monitoring as also advised in section 4.4. of the SmPC.

2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by 
the MAH show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline 
on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.8.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Kalydeco (IVACAFTOR) is included in the 
additional monitoring list. Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet 
includes a statement that this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this 
will allow quick identification of new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted 
equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Studies performed in children diagnosed by newborn screening suggest that early intervention is 
associated with an improvement in nutritional status. Overall, results of the analysis of secondary 
efficacy endpoints assessed in study 108 are supportive of the short-term efficacy of ivacaftor in 
this population of young children (2-6 years) with CF, in particular when sweat chloride and 
endpoints related to nutritional status (weight-for-age z-score and BMI-for-age z-score) are 
considered.  
The mean (SD) absolute change from baseline through week 24 in sweat chloride was -47.07 
mmol/L (24.256) in the ivacaftor 50-mg group (n=7/10) and -46.78 mmol/L (27.584) in the 75-
mg group (n=18/24). The decrease in sweat chloride was already evident at week 2 (first post-
baseline measure) and was kept until week 24. Regarding weight-for-age z-score, the mean (SD) 
change at week 24 was 0.19 (0.32) in the 50-mg ivacaftor group and 0.21 (0.23) in the ivacaftor 
75-mg group. The corresponding 95%CI were (-0.06, 0.43) and (0.11, 031) respectively. For BMI-
for-age z-score these values were as follows: 0.46 (0.46) and 0.34 (0.42) respectively. The 
corresponding 95%CI were as follows: (0.11, 0.81) and (0.16, 052). Nutritional improvement has 
been demonstrated in addition to the effect of pancreatic enzyme substitution and to the nutritional 
interventions that children with CF undergo to keep growth as normal as possible. The magnitude 
of the changes in sweat chloride and weight- and BMI-for-age z-scores is similar to that seen in 
studies 102, 103 and 111.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
While there seems to be evidence that earlier intervention improves growth and nutritional status 
in children with CF, data seems to be scanter regarding lung disease. Theoretically speaking, 
however, it is expected that correcting the function of the defective CFTR protein in CF will be most 
successful in patients with no irreversibly fixed lung abnormalities. As a consequence, early 
administration of ivacaftor to young children with structural lung disease (in the absence of clinical 
manifestations) makes sense provided that no deleterious effects are associated with ivacaftor in 
this young population.    
In study 108, a decrease from baseline was seen in percent predicted FEV1 in children receiving 
ivacaftor 50 mg and weighing less than 14 kg, for whom the mean absolute change was −12.47 
percentage points based on the results from 3 children. This result in the 50-mg ivacaftor group 
Assessment report  
EMA/670893/2020  
Page 56/61 
 
 
 
needs to take into consideration the high degree of variability in the measurements due to the 
technical difficulties of conducting spirometry in small children. Furthermore, this observation is 
based on a small number of patients. In addition, the overall mean baseline stature-for-age z-score 
remained similar at each time point to Week 24. The mean changes from baseline in stature-for-
age z-scores were -0.2454 to 0.0797 across the ivacaftor 50 mg and ivacaftor 75 mg groups. It is 
claimed that the observed increase seen in faecal elastase-1 values suggests the possibility that CF 
patients in this age group may retain some pancreatic function, which can be improved by ivacaftor 
treatment. However, whether this is clinically meaningful and a reduction of pancreatic enzyme 
replacement therapy dose could be considered remains unexplored. In addition, levels of faecal 
elastase-1 were unknown for 5 (50%) patients in the 50-mg ivacafor group and hence, the 
conclusion may be influenced by the unknown values. Overall, it seems that in study 108, faecal 
elastase-1 levels increased above the threshold of 200 µg/g (indicative of pancreatic sufficiency) in 
a limited number of patients. The CHMP considers it premature to conclude on ivacaftor’s 
association with an improvement in pancreatic function in these young children.     
It is acknowledged that the major deficiency of study 108 is the lack of a placebo control arm. 
However, considering that efficacy has been shown in older patients with cystic fibrosis and the 
same type of CFTR mutation, it seems reasonable to accept that the results of study 108 are 
compatible with the benefit in the short-term in young children with cystic fibrosis. Nevertheless 
there is a need of factual confirmation of this assumption, which should be obtained in a post-
marketing setting  conducting a long-term observation study in the relevant patient population as 
outlined in the RMP and Annex II of the marketing authorisation.  
Furthermore, it should be considered that most patients enrolled in study 108 carried the G551D-
CFTR mutation; there were only two patients with a non-G551D mutation. Based on the effect 
shown at the level of in vivo sweat chloride, which is a marker of CFTR activity, it is believed that 
this should not preclude covering non-G551D gating mutations in the indication.   
The effect of discontinuing prescribed therapies for CF while remaining on ivacaftor treatment has 
not been evaluated. During study 108, subjects continued on their prescribed CF therapies. Thus, 
ivacaftor will remain recommended for use in addition to other prescribed therapies for CF, as it 
was evaluated in the Phase 3 studies. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of ivacaftor in children aged 2 to 5 years with a CFTR gating mutation in study 
108 was consistent with that observed in previous studies recruiting older children and adolescents 
as no new adverse events (AE) have been identified following the review of safety data.  
In part B, almost all patients reported at least an AE. AEs with the highest incidence were cough, 
nasal congestion and vomiting. Exacerbations of CF were reported in 10% and 17% of patients on 
ivacaftor 50 mg and 75 mg, respectively. Vomiting seems particularly frequent with 30.0% and 
29.2% of patients in the 50-mg and 75-mg dosing groups respectively. Vomiting resulted in 
interruption of ivacaftor dosing in 2 children in the 75-mg group and in a child in the 50-mg group. 
However, vomiting was considered possibly related to ivacaftor and as a serious AE only in a child 
treated with 75 mg. In part A, a patient on 75 mg ivacaftor reported fever, abdominal bloating, 
abdominal pain, vomiting and pancreatic enzymes increased, which led to omitting one dose of 
ivacaftor. Elevations of pancreatic enzymes are being monitored via PSURs.  
In study 108, 14.7% children had an elevation of ALT or AST that was > 8 x ULN with one of them 
having also AST >8 × ULN. All of them had pre-treatment ALT or AST elevations > 2 x ULN  Fifteen 
percent (6/40) of ivacaftor-treated children aged 6 to less than 12 years in studies 103, 110 and 
Assessment report  
EMA/670893/2020  
Page 57/61 
 
 
 
111 (cross-over portion) had an ALT/AST elevation > 3 x ULN. Out of these 6 patients, one had an 
ALT and AST elevation > 8 x ULN. As for ivacaftor-treated adolescents, 5.1% (4/78) had ALT/AST 
elevations > 3 x ULN. Out of these 4, one (1.3%) had an ALT and AST elevation > 8 x ULN. 
Regarding ivacaftor-treated adult patients these figures are as follows: 2.9% (5/175) and 1.1% (2 
patients, both of them with an isolated AST elevation > 8 x ULN). The maximum ALT increase in 
the ivacaftor group in study 108 was seen in a child aged 4 to 5 years who had an ALT increase of 
18.15 x ULN. The maximum AST increase in study 108 was 11.51 x ULN that was seen in a child 
aged 2 to 3 years. Overall, considering the data from controlled-placebo studies (including study 
110) the maximum ALT or AST elevations were always seen in paediatric patients as compared to 
adult patients. Similarly, maximum ALT elevations were seen in ivacaftor-treated paediatric 
patients as compared to placebo-treated patients. Of the 5 children who in study 108 had ALT or 
AST elevations above 8 x ULN, 4 of them rolled over to study 109. One of them discontinued this 
study due to another elevation following study drug restart. Of the remaining three, two of them 
did not have any further significant elevations while a single patient has had additional significant 
elevations with alternative aetiologies but is now continuing treatment. Since the initial submission, 
3 additional subjects in study 109 have had ALT elevations >8 × ULN. All 3 subjects have resumed 
ivacaftor dosing without any further elevations. The time to initial LFT-increase and the duration of 
LFT elevations was highly variable in 2-5 year-old children justifying the timing for monitoring as 
added to section 4.4 of the SmPC for all patients, i.e. prior to initiating ivacaftor, every 3 months 
during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter with a more frequent monitoring to be 
considered for patients with a history of transaminase elevations. This measure was considered 
appropriate by the CHMP. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
In study 108, ivacaftor was administered for the first time to children aged 2 to less than 6 years.  
In general, it appears that the safety profile of ivacaftor might be worse in these young children, 
especially in those with less body weight, at least from a quantitative point of view. This may, 
however, be driven by the small number of patients enrolled in this study, particularly in the 50-mg 
dosing group.  
Marked transaminase elevations appeared to be more common in this age group than in older 
patients, although the clinical features and outcomes appeared to be comparable. Due to the lack 
of control group in the study, it is not known whether the elevations in LFT observed in this age 
group are related to ivacaftor treatment, underlying CF liver disease or to any additional factors. In 
study 108, liver enzyme elevations were reversible. Nevertheless, the mechanisms behind this 
apparently increased hepatic damage, and how ivacaftor and/or its metabolites may contribute to 
it, remain unexplained. Various factors may contribute to liver toxicity, which is likely to be of 
multifactorial origin. Furthermore, data from follow up study 109 are still limited but certainly long 
term safety data in this population is needed and hence, a post-authorisation study will be 
conducted. It is likely that the small number of patients (n=34) included in study 108 and the short 
length of therapy (24 weeks) limit the number of adverse events reported. In addition, it is also 
expected that their young age impacts the ability to report adverse events. The Package Leaflet 
includes advice on reporting adverse events by the parents to the physicians. 
Despite the nearly normal pulmonary function as measured by FEV1, structural lung damage is 
present in CF patients even in the very early years according to high-resolution computer 
tomography (HRCT) studies. Possible earliest intervention and treatment of CF are considered 
important due to the progressive nature of the disease but it remains to be shown whether 
ivacaftor is able to postpone or prevent disease progression or to stabilise clinical disease, in 
particular lung disease. Due to the progressive nature of CF, long-term data are needed to 
establish efficacy of ivacaftor on lung function. Data from study 108 and 109 provided limited data 
Assessment report  
EMA/670893/2020  
Page 58/61 
 
 
 
pertaining to effects on sweat chloride and endpoints related to nutritional status and growth. This 
gives sufficient certainty on beneficial effects but long term data are needed to demonstrate 
efficacy on more robust clinical endpoints. Hence, it is unlikely that this question can be addressed 
in a registration clinical study, due to the fact that an extensive and long follow-up would be 
needed. Given the unmet medical need in cystic fibrosis and the already demonstrated positive 
effects of ivacaftor in the conducted clinical trials, the CHMP is of the opinion that it would be 
unreasonable to wait for such data before granting the authorisation in this age population. 
Nevertheless, the CHMP also considered that a post-authorisation study was needed to address 
long-term efficacy of ivacaftor in children who initiated treatment at such an early age.    
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
CF lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in CF. Patients with CF typically 
experience a progressive loss of lung function ultimately resulting in respiratory failure and death.  
The rate of decline in FEV1 may be variable depending on several factors such as genotype and 
environmental factors. Studies performed in children diagnosed by newborn screening suggest that 
early intervention is associated to an improvement in nutritional status while for lung disease data 
seem to be scanter. Very young children with CF present structural changes in the lung although 
conventional tests of lung function (such as spirometry) are not sufficiently sensitive to detect 
them. Demonstration of favourable effect on nutritional status and pancreatic function is 
considered particularly important for this population, since most CF patients with gating mutation 
suffer from pancreatic insufficiency. However, the magnitude of the observed effect cannot be fully 
established due to the lack of a control arm. In addition, complete data set is not available for all 
patients enrolled in study 108 and this fact may interfere with the conclusions reached, in 
particular with that derived from the change in faecal elastase-1 values from baseline. Ivacaftor 
showed positive effect on main efficacy endpoints, i.e. sweat chloride levels, weight, BMI.  
While malnutrition and poor somatic growth are prominent signs of CF in young children, lung 
function assessment by spirometry cannot be easily performed. Furthermore, pulmonary function 
changes are not always demonstrated at this age (compared to later in life) and consequently, the 
magnitude of change from baseline in lung function parameters are generally smaller and difficult 
to show, unless alternative methods of lung function assessment are used, such as Lung Clearance 
Index (LCI). As a consequence, there is no solid biomarker or surrogate endpoint that can be used 
to bridge efficacy from adult patients to young children. Extrapolation of efficacy was deemed 
feasible because of the beneficial effects in improving CFTR function and it can be accepted that the 
results of study 108 are compatible with the short-term benefit in the young CF children, 
considering also the efficacy shown in older CF patients, and the comparable results seen in sweat 
chloride across all age ranges studied.  
The uncertainties of the clinical use of ivacaftor will be addressed with a post-authorization efficacy 
study (PAES) to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety of Kalydeco treatment in young 
children with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have a specified gating mutation using the US Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation (CFF) registry and the UK Cystic Fibrosis registry -based data capture as described in 
the RMP and outlined in Annex II of the marketing authorisation. 
No new AEs were identified in study 108 and the safety profile was consistent with that known for 
patients with a G551D gating mutation for whom data on medium term are available. However, the 
safety profile seems worse in youngest children. In particular, there is a concern that in young 
children hepatocellular injury occurs more frequently and is of a higher magnitude as compared to 
older age groups. However, liver toxicity can be managed trough appropriate monitoring in clinical 
practice and to that end, appropriate recommendations are given in the SmPC (section 4.4). 
Furthermore, elevations in transaminases are listed in 4.8 of the SmPC for the awareness of the 
prescriber.

Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Cystic fibrosis represents an area with a high-unmet medical need for specific targeted therapies.  
In patients with cystic fibrosis lung function declines with age and is a significant predictor of 
mortality. 
While there exist clear evidence that earlier intervention with ivacraftor improves growth and 
nutritional status in children with cystic fibrosis data is scanter regarding lung disease. 
Nevertheless it is expected that correcting the function of the defective CFTR protein in cystic 
fibrosis may be beneficial particularly for patients with virtually no irreversibly fixed lung 
abnormalities as ivacaftor could  postpone or prevent disease progression or stabilise clinical 
disease. Consequently, early administration of ivacaftor to young children with structural lung 
disease (in the absence of clinical manifestations) is considered reasonable and unfavourable 
effects can be controlled with the adopted risk minimisation measures.  
Demonstration of long term beneficial effects in very young patients with CF, including CF lung 
disease in a registration trial cannot reasonably be expected due to the duration such a trial would 
require. Therefore, a post authorisation efficacy study will be performed as described in Annex II of 
the marketing authorisation. This study is considered to be a study imposed in accordance with 
Article 34 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006.  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Kalydeco is not similar to Bronchitol within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See Appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Kalydeco in the treatment of 
Kalydeco 50 mg and 75 mg granules:

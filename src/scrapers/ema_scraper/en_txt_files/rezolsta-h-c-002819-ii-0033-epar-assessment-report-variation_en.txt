Rezolsta is a fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet containing 800 mg darunavir and 150 mg cobicistat 
(DRV/COBI). It is a once-daily treatment currently indicated in the European Union (EU) for use in 
combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) medicinal products for the treatment of human 
immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in adults aged 18 years or older, who are either: 
• 
antiretroviral treatment (ART) naïve or  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17523/2020  
Page 5/51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  ART experienced without DRV resistance associated mutations (RAMs) and have plasma HIV 1 
RNA <100,000 copies/mL and CD4+ cell count ≥100 cells x 106/L. 
The aim of the current procedure is to extent the approved indication of Rezolsta to include treatment 
of adolescents aged 12 years and older, weighing at least 40 kg. Both components of the FDC tablet 
have been approved for use in adolescents at the same doses as used in adults, either as part of a FDC 
tablets (E/C/F/TAF (Genvoya), D/C/F/TAF (Symtuza)), or as single entity (DRV (Prezista).  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects

Table 1: Tabulated Overview of Studies Supporting the Use of DRV and COBI in HIV-1 
Infected Adolescent Subjects (Aged ≥12 to <18 Years) 
The darunavir/cobicistat (DRV/COBI) 800/150 mg fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet (REZOLSTA) is 
a once-daily treatment currently indicated in the European Union (EU) for use in combination with 
other antiretroviral (ARV) medicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 
(HIV-1) infection in adults aged 18 years or older, who are either: 
• 
• 
antiretroviral treatment (ART) naïve or  
ART experienced without DRV resistance associated mutations (RAMs) and have plasma HIV-1 
RNA <100,000 copies/mL and CD4+ cell count ≥100 cells x 106/L. 
In HIV-1 infected adolescents (aged ≥12 to <18 years), pharmacokinetic (PK), efficacy, and safety 
data of DRV (800 mg) and COBI (150 mg) as single components are available from 3 paediatric 
studies: 
• 
TMC114-C230 (DRV 800 mg in combination with ritonavir [rtv] 100 mg in ART-naïve subjects)

• 
GS US 216 0128 (DRV 800 or 675 mg in combination with COBI 150 mg [as single agents] in 
ART-experienced, virologically suppressed subjects)  
GS US 292-0106 (COBI, as part of the elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
alafenamide [E/C/F/TAF] 150/150/200/10 mg FDC in ART-naïve subjects).  
In addition, the acceptability/swallowability of the DRV/COBI FDC tablet was evaluated in study 
TMC114FD2HTX1003 in HIV-1 infected adolescents. Further supportive data are available from a 
relative bioavailability study (TMC114FD2HTX1004) with another authorised DRV/COBI containing FDC, 
darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (D/C/F/TAF, 800/150/200/10 mg), which is 
physically similar to the DRV/COBI FDC, and which showed that there was no relevant effect on DRV 
and COBI PK after splitting the D/C/F/TAF FDC.  
2.3.2.  Biopharmaceutics 
The proposed formulation for adolescents is the same as the marketed formulation for adults. This is 
supported by the results from the acceptability/swallowability study TMC114FD2HTX1003 (refer to 
Section 2.4.1 Main study). Some adolescents, however, might encounter difficulty to swallow the 
DRV/COBI FDC tablet as a whole. For those, the FDC tablet may be split in half based on results from 
stability data and in vivo data. Results from a loss of mass study in which DRV/COBI FDC tablets were 
split into 2 pieces using 2 different tablet cutters showed no significant loss of mass after splitting. 
The Phase 1 study TMC114FD2HTX1004 assessed the relative bioavailability of the components in the 
D/C/F/TAF FDC tablet when split or crushed (and mixed with applesauce) compared to swallowed as a 
whole tablet, to facilitate intake for subjects who have difficulty swallowing larger tablets. This study 
showed that splitting the FDC tablet immediately prior to use has no clinically relevant effects on the 
PK of DRV and COBI. As the DRV/COBI FDC tablet is physically similar to the D/C/F/TAF tablet, and the 
amount of DRV/COBI is the same in both tablets, it can be reasonably assumed that the bioavailability 
of DRV and COBI would also be preserved after splitting the DRV/COBI FDC tablet.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
In adolescents, the metabolic factors that determine the PK have matured to adult values well before 
adolescence and, generally, ARV doses are the same for adults and adolescents. The application for the 
use of the DRV/COBI FDC tablet in HIV-1 infected adolescents, aged 12 years and older and weighing 
at least 40  kg, is based on the combination of results summarized in this report. 
A DRV 800 mg once daily dose is indicated for use in adolescents aged ≥12 years and weighing at least 
40 kg. DRV PK data in adolescents are available from the Phase 2 Study TMC114-C230 with DRV (800 
mg) and rtv (100 mg) once daily in combination with zidovudine/lamivudine (AZT/3TC) or 
abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) for 48 weeks in 12 HIV-1 infected, ART-naïve adolescents. 
The appropriateness of the combined use of DRV 800 mg and COBI 150 mg once daily in adolescents 
aged ≥12 years is confirmed by the results from the adolescent cohort of the ongoing Phase 2/3 Study 
GS-US-216-0128 in HIV-1 infected, ART-experienced, virologically suppressed children. Adolescents in 
this cohort received DRV (800 or 675 mg) plus COBI (150 mg once daily) in combination with 2 
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). 
Use of the adult doses for COBI for adolescents (≥12 to <18 years of age) is further confirmed from 
the clinical development of E/C/F/TAF FDC, containing COBI at a dose of 150 mg.

2.3.3.1.  Main study GS-US-216-0128 
Study GS-US-216-0128 is an ongoing open-label, multicohort, two-part, Phase 2/3 study to evaluate 
the PK, safety, and efficacy of COBI-boosted atazanavir (ATV) or COBI-boosted DRV in treatment-
experienced, virologically suppressed, HIV-1 infected, pediatric subjects. Eligible subjects are on a 
stable ARV regimen including 2 NRTIs and either ATV/rtv once daily, or DRV/rtv once daily or twice 
daily as per product label for a minimum of 3 months prior to the Screening visit. The primary 
objectives of this study are to evaluate the steady-state PK and confirm the dose of ATV and COBI or 
DRV and COBI in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral treatment (ART)-experienced, virologically suppressed, 
pediatric subjects 3 months to <18 years of age and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 
COBI-boosted ATV or COBI-boosted DRV, each coadministered with a background regimen through 48 
weeks in HIV-1 infected, ART-experienced, virologically suppressed, pediatric subjects 3 months to 
<18 years of age. The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
antiviral activity of long-term treatment with COBI-boosted ATV or COBI-boosted DRV, each 
coadministered with a background regimen, in HIV-1 infected, ART-experienced, virologically 
suppressed, pediatric subjects 3 months to <18 years of age. 
For the scope of this submission, only data from subjects receiving COBI-boosted DRV in Cohort 1 (≥
12 to <18 years of age) Part A (evaluating the steady-state PK and confirming the dose of DRV and 
COBI) will be discussed. 
Subjects and Methods 
A total of 8 treatment-experienced, virologically suppressed, HIV-1 infected, adolescent subjects (aged 
≥12 to <18 years and weighing ≥35 kg) were included in the DRV+COBI group in Cohort 1 Part A of 
the study. Subjects received the recommended dose of COBI for HIV-1 infected adults (150 mg once 
daily) in combination with approved doses for DRV based on body weight according to the applicable 
prescribing information (800 mg once daily [body weight ≥40 kg; N=7] or 675 mg once daily [body 
weight ≥30 kg to ˂40 kg; N=1]), and a background regimen, for 48 weeks. For all subjects, the 
background regimen had to include 2 NRTIs. The background regimen could contain additional ARV 
agents except for the following disallowed agents: saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, double PI regimens, 
raltegravir, EVG, efavirenz, nevirapine, delavirdine, maraviroc, etravirine, rilpivirine, dolutegravir, and 
investigational ARV agents. 
An intensive PK evaluation was performed on Day -1 (for DRV) and Day 10 (for DRV and COBI) for 
subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 Part A. Pharmacokinetic blood samples were collected at predose and up 
to 12 hours postdose on Day -1 (for DRV) and on Day 10 (for DRV and COBI). Intensive PK blood 
samples were collected at predose and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 12 hours postdose on Day -1 (for ATV or 
DRV) and on Day 10 (for ATV or DRV and COBI). The predose (0 hours) concentration was also used 
as surrogate for the concentration at the end of the dosing interval (24 hours) for the purpose of 
estimating AUCtau and Ctau. The primary PK endpoint was AUC from time of administration up to the 
end of the dosing interval (AUCtau) for DRV on Day 10. The secondary PK endpoints were plasma 
concentration at the end of the dosing interval (Ctau), Cmax, and apparent clearance (CL/F) for DRV, 
and AUCtau, Ctau, Cmax, CL/F, and apparent volume of distribution of the drug (Vz/F) for COBI on 
Day 10. 
To determine whether the exposure of DRV boosted by the adult dose of COBI (150 mg) in adolescents 
was similar to that in adults, statistical comparisons were performed to compare PK data from the 
current study with historical data in HIV-1 infected adults (adult comparator):

• 
Intensive PK data (AUCtau, Ctau, and Cmax) from adults receiving COBI-boosted DRV in Study 
GS-US-216-0130 (N=60). 
• 
Population PK data (AUCtau and Ctau) from adults receiving COBI-boosted DRV in Study GS-US-
216-0130 (N=298). 
In addition, exposures of DRV boosted by COBI in adolescents (on Day 10) were compared with those 
boosted by rtv (on Day -1) in the same pediatric subjects to confirm that exposures of boosted DRV 
with COBI were comparable to those approved in pediatrics with rtv. All subjects were receiving DRV 
boosted by COBI or rtv once daily at least 10 days prior to the intensive PK visits. 
Exposures of COBI were compared with historical data with COBI-boosted DRV from Study GS-US-216-
0130 (intensive PK data; N=60). 
Bioanalytical Methods 
Plasma concentrations of DRV and COBI, as well as other ARVs were determined using validated liquid 
chromatographic - mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry methods.  
DRV was analyzed using analytical method QPS 42-0902. The calibrated range for DRV was 20 to 10000 
ng/mL; the inter-run precision ranged from 3.4% to 8.7%; the inter-run accuracy ranged from -9.6% 
to -0.3%. The QC concentrations were 60, 800 and 9000 ng/mL. 
COBI (GS-9350) was measured using analytical method QPS 60-1343. The calibrated range for COBI 
was  5  to  2500  ng/mL;  the  inter-run  precision  ranged  from  5.2%  to  113.0%;  the  inter-run  accuracy 
ranged from -5.8% to 74.0%. The large precision and accuracy values are attributed to outliers for QC 
15 and QC 100 in one run that appear to  have been inadvertently switched. All QC data points from 
accepted runs were included in the statistical calculations. The QC concentrations were 15, 100, 1000 
and 2000 ng/mL. 
Demographics - dosing 
Demographics of the 8 subjects included in the PK dataset are given in Table 14 which shows that mean 
body weight at baseline was 55 kg (min 37 kg; max 78 kg). One subject of the eight subjects included 
was  weighing  37  kg  (<  40  kg.  male,  12-yr  old)  and  received  a  DRV  dose  of  600  mg  (instead  of  the 
planned protocol dose of 675 mg), the others received a DRV dose 800 mg.  At the time of enrolment 
this  subject  weighing  37  kg  was  on  a  stable  antiretroviral  regimen  including  2  nucleoside  reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors and ritonavir-boosted DRV 600 mg. The subject was able to maintain virologic 
suppression with the DRV 600 mg dose, and therefore the dose of DRV remained unchanged when the 
subject  began  on  Study  GS-US-216-0128.  This  subject’s  data  have  been  excluded  from  the  primary 
statistical comparisons. 
From the 7 subjects receiving the 800 mg DRV dose, 1 subject was 16-yr old, 3 subjects were 15-yr 
old, two subjects were 14-yr old and one subject was 12-yr old, which means the adolescent age 
range of 12-18 yrs old was reasonably covered. 
Results: Pharmacokinetics of DRV 
All PK parameters were calculated using conventional non-compartmental methods using actual times 
of blood sampling. The mean (SD) steady-state plasma concentration vs time profile for DRV following 
administration of COBI-boosted DRV to virologically suppressed, HIV-1 infected adolescents ≥35 kg on 
Day 10 (N=8) is shown in Figure 1. Maximal plasma concentrations of DRV were achieved at 
approximately 4.50 hours post-dose (median tmax) (Table 2).

Table 3: DRV (Day 10, With COBI) CL/F (Study GS-US-216-0128 Cohort 1 Part A; Intensive 
PK Analysis Set for DRV)  
When compared with historical PK data for DRV administered as DRV+COBI 800/150 mg once daily in 
treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced, HIV-1 infected adults (Study GS-US-216-0130 PK 
substudy), DRV AUCtau and Cmax were similar and the DRV Ctau was 29% lower, respectively, in 
adolescents receiving COBI-boosted DRV than in adults (Table 4). When compared with the overall 
adult population PK data for DRV in Study GS-US-216-0130, DRV AUCtau and Ctau were 20% and 
61% lower, respectively, in adolescents receiving COBI-boosted DRV, and the geometric least-squares 
mean (GLSM) ratio and associated 90% CIs were outside the 70% to 143% boundaries (Table 4). 
The lower DRV exposures in adolescents relative to adults were not considered clinically relevant, as 
the DRV Ctau values in adolescents were within the overall range of those observed previously with 
COBI-boosted DRV in adults. Importantly, the mean DRV Ctau was approximately 20-fold above the 
protein-adjusted half maximal effective concentration against wild-type HIV-1 virus (55 ng/mL) and no 
exposure-efficacy relationship was observed for COBI-boosted DRV in the Phase 3 Study GS-US-216-
0130 and Phase 3 D/C/F/TAF studies. Further, exposure-efficacy analyses of Phase 3 studies of rtv-
boosted DRV demonstrated that a 50% reduction in DRV trough concentrations would not impact the 
mean predicted virological response.

Exposures of DRV boosted by COBI (on Day 10) in adolescents were also compared to those boosted 
by rtv (on Day -1) in the same group of subjects (Table 5). All subjects were receiving DRV boosted by 
COBI or rtv once daily at least 10 days prior to the intensive PK visits. The AUCtau and Ctau were 9% 
and 51% lower, respectively with COBI relative to rtv. Darunavir Cmax was similar.

Results: Pharmacokinetics of COBI 
Steady-state PK parameters for COBI following the administration of DRV+COBI to virologically 
suppressed, HIV-1 infected adolescents on Day 10 are presented in Table 6. Maximal plasma 
concentrations of COBI were achieved at 4.00 hours post-dose (median tmax).

The lower and upper bounds of the 95% CIs of CL/F and Vz/F relative to the geometric mean for COBI 
following administration of DRV+COBI were within the FDA-specified boundary of 60% to 140% (Table

Table 7: COBI CL/F and Vz/F (Study GS-US-216-0128 Cohort 1 Part A; Intensive PK Analysis

When compared with historical intensive PK data for COBI administered as DRV+COBI 800/150 mg 
once daily in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced, HIV-1 infected adults (Study GS-US-216-
0130 intensive PK sub-study; N=60), COBI AUCtau, Cmax  and Ctau were 19%, 16% and 28% higher, 
respectively, in adolescents receiving DRV+COBI relative to adults (Table 8).  
The higher COBI exposures in adolescents relative to adults were not considered clinically relevant as 
they were within the overall range of exposures associated with robust PK boosting and safety 
established in the REZOLSTA, Symtuza, Tybost, and Genvoya programs in adult and pediatric HIV 
patients. There was a large degree of variability in COBI Ctau in adolescents and adults, which reduced 
the precision of this estimate. This was attributed to the variability in the time of collection of the pre-
dose PK sample at the intensive PK visit (collected approximately 8.5 to 28 hours post-dose; pre-dose 
samples were used as a surrogate for Ctau.

2.3.3.2.  Supportive study TMC114-C230 
Study TMC114-C230 was an open-label, Phase 2 study to evaluate the PK, safety, tolerability, and 
antiviral activity of DRV/rtv in treatment-naïve, HIV-1 infected, adolescent subjects. The primary 
objective of this study was to evaluate the PK, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of DRV/rtv 800/100 mg 
once daily, in combination with an investigator-selected background regimen, over a 24-week 
treatment period. Secondary objectives were to evaluate long-term safety, tolerability, efficacy, 
immunology, resistance characteristics, PK, and PK/PD relationships over 48 weeks of treatment in this 
population. 
Subjects and Methods 
A total of 12 treatment-naïve, HIV-1 infected, adolescent subjects (aged ≥12 to <18 years and 
weighing ≥40 kg) were included in the study. Subjects received the recommended dose of DRV/rtv for 
treatment-naïve, HIV-1 infected adults, 800/100 mg once daily, in combination with an investigator-
selected background regimen, for 48 weeks. The investigator-selected background regimen was either 
AZT/3TC or ABC/3TC, whichever was approved and marketed or considered the local standard of care 
for subjects between ≥12 and <18 years of age in their particular country.  
After 14 days of treatment with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily, PK profiles for DRV and rtv in plasma 
were determined up to 24 hours after dosing for non-compartmental PK analysis. These samples were 
also used for population PK analysis of DRV, together with sparse samples obtained at Weeks 4, 24, 
and 48.  
The primary statistical analysis (safety, efficacy, resistance, PK, and PK/PD) was performed at Week 
24, and the final analysis was performed at Week 48.  
The PK data from adolescents who received DRV/rtv in this study were compared to available PK data 
from HIV-1 infected adult subjects (adult comparator). 
Results: Pharmacokinetics of DRV (Week 2) 
The mean plasma concentration-time curve for DRV is shown in Figure 3. The maximum mean plasma 
concentrations were reached at 3 hours after intake of DRV/rtv.

The PK parameters for DRV are summarized in Table 2. The interindividual variabilities (%CV) for 
minimum plasma concentration (Cmin), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), and area under the 
plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) over 24 hours (AUC24h) were 48.3%, 25.3%, and 32.1%, 
respectively.

Empirical Bayesian estimates for DRV PK parameters in HIV-1 infected adolescents were obtained 
using a pediatric population PK model, which included the intensive and sparse PK sampling data from 
study TMC114-C230. These empirical Bayesian estimates for DRV PK parameters were obtained for 
each subject at each visit with PK sampling, and from these, the median estimate was determined for 
each subject. Summary statistics for the individual median values for PK parameters of DRV in the 
Week 24 and 48 analyses of Study TMC114-C230 are provided in

2.3.3.3.  Supportive study GS-US-292-0106 
Study GS-US-292-0106 is an ongoing Phase 2/3, open-label study to evaluate the PK, safety, and 
antiviral activity of the E/C/F/TAF FDC in HIV-1 infected, ART-naïve adolescents. In this study, also a 
patient population of virologically suppressed children (aged 6 to <12 years) was included. However, 
these data are not described in this submission, which focuses on adolescent HIV-1 infected subjects. 
The primary objectives of this study (adolescent group) are to evaluate the steady-state PK for EVG 
and TAF and confirm the dose of the E/C/F/TAF FDC in HIV-1 infected, ART-naïve adolescents (Part A 
of the study) and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the E/C/F/TAF FDC through Week 24 in HIV-
1 infected, ART-naïve adolescents (Part B of the study). The secondary objectives are to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of the E/C/F/TAF FDC through Week 48 in HIV-1 infected, 
ART-naïve adolescents. 
Subjects and Methods 
All adolescents received the adult dose of E/C/F/TAF (150/150/200/10 mg). The steady-state PK 
(intensive PK visit at Week 4) of EVG, TAF, TFV, COBI, and FTC were evaluated in 24 adolescent 
subjects (aged ≥12 to <18 years and weighing ≥35 kg) enrolled in Part A of the study. The primary PK 
endpoint in Part A was AUCtau for EVG and the AUC from 0 hours up to the time of the last 
measurable (non-below quantification limit) concentration after dosing (AUClast) for TAF. The 
secondary PK endpoints included plasma concentration at the end of the dosing interval (Ctrough), 
Cmax, CL/F, and Vz/F for EVG; Cmax, CL/F, and Vz/F for TAF; and AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctrough for 
TFV, FTC, and COBI. 
The PK data from adolescents who received E/C/F/TAF in this study were compared to combined 
available PK data from healthy adult subjects and HIV-1 infected adult subjects (adult comparator; 
total N=52). 
For the purpose of this submission, the focus is on the COBI PK data. Data for EVG, FTC, TAF, and TFV 
can be found in the CSR.

Results: Pharmacokinetics of COBI 
Pharmacokinetic parameters for COBI are presented in Table 11. For COBI, the AUCtau, Cmax, and 
Ctrough were 21.05%, 21.40%, and 39.59% lower, respectively, in adolescents in this study 
compared with the adult comparator, and the lower bound of the 90% CI of the GLSM ratio for each 
parameter extended below the 70% to 143% boundaries (Table 12). However, the COBI exposures 
were consistent with the totality of historical data for COBI and in the range of exposure associated 
with a robust PD effect (boosting) (Table 8), which is the function of COBI in E/C/F/TAF.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The appropriateness of the combined use of DRV 800 mg and COBI 150 mg once daily in adolescents 
aged ≥12 years has been assessed in the adolescent cohort of the ongoing Phase 2/3 Study GS-US-
216-0128, evaluating COBI coadministered with DRV in HIV-1 infected, ART-experienced, virologically 
Assessment report

suppressed children. Adolescents in this cohort received DRV plus COBI (150 mg once daily) as 
separate tablets in combination with 2 NRTIs. The results of this cohort are relevant for the DRV/COBI 
FDC tablet, as the DRV/COBI FDC tablet is bioequivalent to combined administration of the separate 
tablets of DRV and COBI. 
Results from study GS-US-216-0128 showed that the PK parameters AUCtau, Cmax and Ctau for DRV 
were on average at the same level for the adolescents and adults using the intensive PK data.  
The data from study GS-US-216-0128 are used as the main study for the extension of indication to 
adolescents. The data of other two studies are used as supportive evidence and are only be described 
and assessed shortly; these studies TMC114-C230 and GS-US-292-0106 have been part of previously 
approved marketing authorizations (Prezista, Genvoya and Symtuza)      
For COBI it was shown that AUCtau and Cmax were similar between adolescents and adults, only mean 
Ctau for the adolescents was 28% higher than for the adults, which means that the boosting effect is 
at least maintained in comparison to the adults. There are no safety issues expected with this 
exposure level. 
In general, the precision of the PK parameter estimates AUC and Cmax were sufficient both for DRV 
and COBI.  
There was a large degree of variability in Ctau both for DRV and COBI, but both in adolescents and 
adults, which reduced the precision of this estimate. This was attributed to the variability in the time of 
collection of the pre-dose PK sample at the intensive PK visit on Day 10 (collected approximately 8.5 to 
28 hours after the previous dose on Day 9). The MAH concluded that no clinically relevant differences 
in DRV exposures with COBI 150 mg once daily were observed in HIV-1 infected, virologically 
suppressed adolescents compared with adults. The PK data support the use of COBI 150 mg boosted 
DRV in adolescents weighing at least 40 kg. 
One subject of the eight subjects included was weighing 37 kg (< 40 kg male, 12-yr old) and received 
a DRV dose of 600 mg (instead of the planned protocol dose of 675 mg). The subject was able to maintain 
virologic suppression with the DRV 600 mg dose, and therefore the dose of DRV remained unchanged 
when the subject began on Study GS-US-216-0128. This subject’s data was excluded from the primary 
statistical comparisons, hence the final number of subjects analysed was 7. 
From the 7 subjects receiving the 800 mg DRV dose, 1 subject was 16-yr old, 3 subjects were 15-yr 
old, two subjects were 14-yr old and one subject was 12-yr old, which means the adolescent age 
range of 12-18 yrs old was reasonably covered.  
The composition of the tablets is suitable for use in adolescent population. The size of the tablets is 
common for products used for this indication.  
Rezolsta tablets do not contain a break mark; the MAH used tablet cutters to split the tablets. This 
principle could be acceptable as the intention is to swallow the complete dose. The MAH provided a PK 
study TMC114FD2HTX1004 of a similar FDC product containing D/C/F/TAF. In this study it was shown 
that the D/C/F/TAF tablet can be split prior to intake without impact on the bioavailability of the 
components.  The CHMP considered that the results for clinical study TMC114FD2HTX1004 are relevant 
to support the proposed splitting instructions of the unscored tablets provided that that the entire dose 
is consumed immediately after splitting (as mentioned in the product information).

2.3.5.  Conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the PK profile of the E/C/F/TAF components in adolescents was largely comparable to that in 
adults and was within clinically efficacious ranges for all components, supporting that the adult dose of 
COBI (150 mg) is appropriate for use in adolescents. 
The composition of the tablets is suitable for use in the intended age group. The size of the tablets is 
common for products used for this indication. 
Overall, the MAH has provided acceptable responses to all pharmacokinetic issues. There are no 
objections to an approval of the Paediatric indication from a pharmacokinetic point of view. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
GS-US-216-0128: A Phase 2/3, Multicenter, Open-label, Multicohort, Two-Part Study 
Evaluating Pharmacokinetics (PK), Safety, and Efficacy of Cobicistat-boosted Atazanavir 
(ATV/co) or Cobicistat-boosted Darunavir (DRV/co), Administered with a Background 
Regimen (BR) in HIV-1 Infected, Treatment-Experienced, Virologically Suppressed Pediatric 
Subjects 
Methods 
This is an ongoing open-label, multicenter, multicohort, two-part study (Part A and B) evaluating the 
PK, safety, efficacy, and antiviral activity of ATV/co or DRV/co administered with a BR in HIV-1 infected 
treatment-experienced, virologically suppressed paediatric subjects. 
A total of approximately 100 paediatric subjects, ages 3 months to < 18 years, of either sex are being 
enrolled as follows: 
Part A: 
A minimum of 79 subjects are planned to be enrolled to evaluate the steady state PK and confirm the 
dose of ATV/co and DRV/co. Subjects are enrolled sequentially by cohort as follows: 
Part B: 
A minimum of 21 additional subjects are planned to be enrolled in Part B to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of the ATV/co or DRV/co regimen. 
For all cohorts in Part B, additional subjects will be screened and initiated sequentially by each age 
cohort and protease inhibitor (PI), ATV or DRV, following confirmation of appropriate COBI exposure 
and PI exposures from the corresponding age cohort in Part A. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17523/2020  
Page 25/51 
 
 
 
 
 
In each cohort, if the minimum number of either ATV/co or DRV/co subjects complete their Day 10 
intensive PK visit before the other, then the data from that treatment may proceed to be analysed. 
Upon acceptable COBI and PI safety and PK data through Day 10, Part B of that cohort and Part A of 
the subsequent cohort will proceed to be opened for that treatment. Part A for the treatment that has 
not completed enrolment will remain open until the minimum number of subjects complete their Day 
10 intensive PK visit.

Treatments 
COBI 
For Cohort 1, COBI 150 mg (administered as 75 mg x 2 tablets or 150 mg x 1 tablet) is administered 
orally once-daily with food, in combination with DRV and a background regimen (BR). For all subjects,

elvitegravir, efavirenz, nevirapine, delavirdine, maraviroc, etravirine, rilpivirine, dolutegravir, and 
investigational antiretroviral agents. 
DRV 
DRV is administered as either tablets or oral suspension depending upon subject’s body weight and 
ability to swallow tablets. DRV suspension was not administered to any subject in Cohort 1. 
The recommended daily dosage of DRV is given, based on body weight, according to the prescribing 
information provided in the product monograph and should not exceed the recommended adult 
dosage.  
Objectives 
The primary objectives, related to DRV/co, of this ongoing study are as follows: 
• 
To evaluate the steady-state PK and confirm the dose of DRV/co in HIV-1 infected, 
antiretroviral treatment-experienced, virologically suppressed paediatric subjects 3 months to 
< 18 years of age 
• 
To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of DRV/co, co-administered with a background 
regimen (BR) through 48 weeks in HIV-1 infected antiretroviral treatment-experienced 
virologically suppressed paediatric subjects 3 months to < 18 years of age 
The secondary objective, related to DRV/co, of this ongoing study is as follows: 
• 
To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of long-term treatment of DRV/co, co-
administered with a BR, in HIV-1 infected antiretroviral treatment-experienced virologically 
suppressed paediatric subjects 3 months to < 18 years of age 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The efficacy endpoints were: 
• 
The percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48 using the US 
FDA-defined snapshot algorithm 
• 
The percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Weeks 12, 24, and 48, and 
every 12 weeks after Week 48 based on Missing = Excluded [M = E] analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17523/2020  
Page 27/51 
 
 
 
 
• 
The change from baseline in CD4 cell count and percentage at Weeks 24 and 48, and every 12 
weeks after Week 48 
Safety assessments included monitoring of adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications, clinical 
laboratory tests (including renal, hepatic, and fasting glucose and lipid parameters), physical 
examinations, Tanner stage assessments, and vital signs. 
Sample size 
A sample size of 8 evaluable DRV subjects provided at least 90% power to show that COBI-boosted 
DRV AUCtau in paediatric subjects was similar to AUCtau in adult subjects. For the above sample size 
computation, inter-subject standard deviations (natural log scale) of 0.3 h•ng/mL for DRV AUCtau 
(based on population PK data from 298 adult subjects in Study GS-US-216-0130) were used in the 
computation. It was assumed that equivalent assessments were to be conducted using two 1-sided t-
tests each at 0.05 alpha levels, and equivalence boundaries of 70% to 143 % were applied. 
A sample size of 8 evaluable DRV subjects also provided at least 78% power to target a 95% CI within 
60% and 140% of the geometric mean estimate of CL/F, assuming a %CV of 35.7% for DRV clearance 
(based on population PK data from Study GS-US-216-0130). 
Randomisation 
Study GS-US-216-0128 was not a randomized study. 
Blinding (masking) 
Study GS-US-216-0128 is an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analyses used the Full Analysis Set (FAS) which included all subjects who received at least 1 
dose of study drug. The proportions of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 
and 48 were evaluated using both the US FDA-defined snapshot algorithm and M = E analyses. The 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for these percentages were constructed using the Clopper-Pearson 
Exact method. CD4 cell count and CD4% data, including change from baseline, were summarized using 
observed, on-treatment data (ie, data collected up to 1 day after permanent discontinuation of study 
drug or all available data for subjects who were still on study drug). 
Adverse event and clinical laboratory data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Adverse 
events were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 21.1. 
Tanner stage assessments were used to evaluate the onset and progression of pubertal changes. Body 
weight, body weight Z-score, height, and height Z-score were summarized.

Protocol deviations 
Table 13 provides information on important protocol deviations that occurred in subjects treated with 
DRV/COBI from Cohort 1 Part A. Protocol deviations were documented during routine monitoring visits.  
Among the 8 subjects treated with DRV/COBI from Cohort I Part A, 4 important protocol deviations 
have been noted in 3 subjects. None of these important protocol deviations affected the overall quality 
or interpretation of the study data.

Subject (PPD), who weighed <40 kg at baseline and received DRV 600 mg, was excluded from analysis. 
Baseline data 
In the Safety Analysis Set for Cohort 1 Part A, most subjects (overall 63.6%) were male (Table 14). 
Median age (range) in the DRV/co arm was 15 (12 to 16) years. The study enrolled a virologically 
suppressed, HIV-1 infected population, and all subjects in the Safety Analysis Set for DRV/co Cohort 1 
Part A had baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL. The median (Q1, Q3) baseline CD4 cell count 
overall in the DRV/co group was 1069 (820, 1881) cells/μL, with 100% of subjects having a baseline 
CD4 cell count ≥ 500 cells/µL. The mode of infection in all subjects was vertical transmission. At 
baseline, all subjects in the DRV/co arm were asymptomatic.

At Week 24, the percentage of subjects in Cohort 1 Part A with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL using the 
US FDA-defined snapshot algorithm was 75.0% (6 of 8 subjects). The remaining 2 subjects in the 
DRV/co group discontinued study drug due to AE or other reasons, and their last available HIV-1 RNA 
was < 50 copies/mL. Similar results were achieved at week 48 (Table 15).

Virology Resistance Analyses 
HIV-1 historical genotypes with PR and RT data were available for 13 of 22 subjects (59.0%) in the 
Cohort 1 Part A FAS. Two subjects receiving DRV/co had a pretreatment primary PI-associated 
resistance substitution (Q58E or L90M) in their historical genotypes. Both subjects had HIV-1 RNA < 
50 copies/mL at Week 48. None of the 8 subjects in the DRV/co Cohort 1 Part A FAS met the VF and 
Resistance Analysis Population (RAP) inclusion criteria through Week 48.

Table 17 provides the FDA Snapshot outcome from Study GS-US-216-0128 and the two supportive 
studies TMC114-C230 and GS-US-292-0106 (see Supportive studies below).

Additionally, the MAH provided a comparison of the efficacy results in adolescents and adults, for 
Study TMC114-C230 (ART-naïve subjects) vs the historical pivotal Phase 3 Study TMC114-C211, 
which included adult, ART-naïve, HIV-1 infected subjects, who were treated with DRV/rtv 800/100 mg 
once daily in combination with FTC/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and Study 
TMC114FD2HTX3001, including adult, ART-naïve, HIV-1 infected subjects, who were treated with 
D/C/F/TAF once daily FDC or DRV and COBI 800/150 mg FDC with FTC/TDF 200/10 mg FDC once

daily. Virologic response and the change from baseline in CD4+ cell count/percentage was in general 
similar for these 3 studies. 
The results of Study GS-US-216-0128, including ART-experienced, virologically suppressed, HIV-1 
infected subjects from ≥12 to <18 years of age who were treated with DRV (800 or 675 mg) and COBI 
(150 mg), were presented next to the results of the Phase 3 Study TMC114IFD3013, which included 
ART-experienced, virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected adult subjects, who were treated with 
D/C/F/TAF FDC (800/150/200/10 mg). The efficacy results at Week 48 of Studies GS-US-216-0128 
and TMC114IFD3013 are summarized and presented side by side in Table 18. Very low virologic failure 
rates were observed in both these studies. No clinically meaningful changes from baseline in CD4+ cell 
count and CD4+ percentage are noted in Studies GS-US-216-0128 and TMC114IFD3013.

Supportive studies 
Two studies have been submitted in support of efficacy of DRV/COBI in adolescents, Study TMC114-
C230 (DRV/r, n=12 subjects enrolled) and Study GS-US-292-0106 (Genvoya, n=50 subjects enrolled). 
Both studies have also been assessed in support of the use of Symtuza (DRV/COBI/F/TAF) in 
adolescents.  
At Week 48, the virologic success rate (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) in Study TMC114-C230 was 
83.3% (10/12 subjects) using the time to loss of virologic response (TLOVR) algorithm (primary 
efficacy endpoint) and 91.7% (11/12 subjects) using the FDA Snapshot Approach. The median (range) 
change from baseline in CD4+ cell count at Week 48 was +221 (64 to 370) cells/mm3, and the median 
(range) change from baseline in CD4+ percentage at Week 48 was +14 (-4 to 19) %.  
In Study GS-US-292-0106, the virologic success rate (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) at Week 48 was 
92.0%, (46/50 subjects) using the FDA Snapshot Approach. The median (range) change from baseline 
in CD4+ cell count of +220 (-87 to 661) cells/mm³, and the median (range) change from baseline in 
CD4+ percentage at Week 48 was +8.5 (-1.6 to 22.0) %.  
In both studies, emergence of RAMs and phenotypic resistance against ARVs in the subjects’ regimens 
were rare up to Week 96 and 192, with no DRV resistance observed in any study. 
The MAH has included the acceptability study TMC114FD2HTX1003 in support of the extension of 
indication to adolescents. In short, this was a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, single-dose, crossover 
study to evaluate the acceptability/swallowability of DRV/COBI and D/C/F/TAF FDC tablets (each 
administered as matching placebo tablets) in HIV-1 infected adolescent subjects, aged from ≥12 to 
<18 years and weighing at least 40 kg. The study consisted of a screening period and an open-label 
administration phase of 1 day. At screening, a reference placebo tablet (of similar size as approved 
products for adolescents) needed to be swallowed to assess willingness and ability to swallow. On Day 
1, the 2 FDC placebo tablets (1x DRV/COBI and 1x D/C/F/TAF) were tested. After each intake of a 
placebo tablet, an acceptability/swallowability questionnaire had to be completed. 
Intake of the DRV/COBI-matching placebo tablet, sized 23 mm x 11.5 mm, was considered easy for 
single administration and acceptable for long-term daily use by all 27 enrolled subjects. The complete 
CSR does not change this opinion.  
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Extensions of indication to include adolescents for antiretroviral agents are primarily based on 
demonstration of comparable exposure in adolescents vs. adults, and a specific demonstration of 
antiviral efficacy in paediatric patients is not required, as it is stressed out in the EMA Guideline on the 
clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infection.  
In this case, only information on Cohort 1 from study GS-US-216-0128, (subjects from 12 years to < 
18 years old, who received DRV/co )  was provided, as this is the data submitted in support of the 
extension of indication for Rezolsta to include adolescents 12 to <18 years of age. 
Efficacy endpoints were the percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 
48 using the US FDA-defined snapshot algorithm. 
At Week 24, the percentage of subjects in Cohort 1 Part A with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL using the 
US FDA-defined snapshot algorithm was 75.0% (6 of 8 subjects). The remaining 2 subjects in the 
DRV/co group discontinued study drug due to AE or other reason (subject’s guardian did not want to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17523/2020  
Page 37/51 
 
 
 
 
expose the subject to a non-FDA approved drug) and their last available HIV-1 RNA was < 50 
copies/mL. Similar results were achieved at week 48 (75%) (response rate).  
Body weight was an important parameter, given that DRV dosing in children is weight-based. In 
children (including adolescents) ≥30 to <40 kg, a 675mg DRV dose is recommended, in contrast to the 
800 mg in the Rezolsta FDC tablet. In the current study, DRV and cobi were administered as single 
components, and dose adjustments based on weight were possible. Of note, one of the 8 patients in 
the DRV/co arm had a baseline body weight below 40 kg and hence received the 675 mg DRV dose. 
The MAH was asked to provide the main efficacy and safety information for the 7 subjects treated with 
DRV 800 mg + COBI 150 mg, i.e. remove the subject with the lower body weight of 37 kg as this 
subject does not belong to the required age/body weight extension.  
After excluding the subject with body weight below the 40 kg cut-off, the virologic success rate (HIV-1 
RNA <50 copies/mL) at Week 48 in Study GS-US-216-0128 was 85.7% (6/7 subjects). None of the 
subjects experienced protocol-defined virologic failure. 
In relation to Virology Resistance Analyses, none of the 8 subjects in the DRV/co Cohort 1 Part A FAS 
met the VF and Resistance Analysis Population (RAP) inclusion criteria through Week 48. Emergence of 
phenotypic resistance against DRV and NRTI background were rare in all studies up to 192 weeks.  
Two studies have also been submitted in support of efficacy of DRV/COBI in adolescents, Study 
TMC114-C230 (DRV/r, n=12 subjects enrolled) and Study GS-US-292-0106 (Genvoya, n=50 
subjects enrolled). Both studies have been previously assessed by the CHMP in support of the use of 
Symtuza (DRV/COBI/F/TAF) in adolescents. 
At Week 48, the virologic success rate (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) using the FDA Snapshot Approach 
was 91.7% (11/12 subjects) in Study TMC114-C230  and 92.0% (46/50 subjects) in Study GS-US-
292-0106. 
Acceptability was evaluated in study TMC114FD2HTX1003, which has already been assessed as part of 
the MAA assessment of Symtuza (approved in 2017), during which it was agreed with the MAH that 
the swallowability of the FDC was acceptable in the subjects who were enrolled in the study.   
The requested extension of indication to adolescents for Rezolsta applies to both treatment-naïve and 
treatment-experienced patients, and hence the subjects enrolled in Study TMC114FD2HTX1003 are not 
fully representative for the envisioned population. This was agreed by CHMP considering that the tablet 
may also be split using a tablet-cutter in case of swallowability issues. 
During the procedure the MAH clarified that protocol amendment 4, describing DRV suspension as 
alternative options for subjects who were unable to swallow tablets, was put in place to specify that 
DRV will be administered as either tablets or oral suspension depending upon subject’s weight and 
ability to swallow tablets. This option was added in case a subject enrolled in the study and was 
already taking DRV suspension. In Cohort 1, Part A no subjects have taken DRV suspension since none 
were enrolled taking this formulation. Furthermore, no data on acceptability of the DRV tablets was 
collected as this is not an objective of the study.  
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the data to support the use of Rezolsta in adolescents, the efficacy of DRV, whether boosted 
with cobicistat or ritonavir, was overall acceptable (response rate ≥ 75%). Importantly, emergence of 
RAMs and phenotypic resistance against DRV and NRTI background were rare in all studies up to 192 
weeks.

The overall efficacy was considered acceptable by the CHMP in the adolescent population.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
To characterise the safety of Rezolsta in adolescents, studies TMC114-C230, GS-US-216-0128, and 
GS-US-292-0106 were submitted.  
Patient exposure 
At the data-cut date, the median (Q1, Q3) exposure to study drug in the DRV/co arm was 98.2 (28.6, 
143.4) weeks.  
Adverse events 
An overall summary of AEs for Cohort 1 Part A is shown in Table 19. Two subjects experienced a 
treatment-emergent study drug related AE (Hyperlipidaemia in both cases). The 2 listed treatment-
emergent SAEs were Chest pain (n=1) and Bipolar disorder (n=1). Two subjects prematurely 
discontinued the study due to treatment-emergent AEs: 1 subject due to hyperlipidemia and 
acanthosis nigricans, and the other subject due to chest pain and Becker’s naevus.

Adverse events considered related to study drug by the investigator were reported for 25.0% (2 of 8) 
of subjects (Table 20).

Table 20. GS-US-216-0128: All Study Drug-Related Adverse Events, Cohort 1 Part A (Safety 
Analysis Set) 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No treatment-emergent death was reported. Serious AEs, considered unrelated to study drug by the 
investigator, were reported for 25.0%(2 of 8) of subjects. These included bipolar disorder in 1 subject 
and chest pain in 1 subject No SAE was reported for > 1 subject. The SAE of chest pain led to 
premature study drug discontinuation.  
Laboratory findings 
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in median values for haematology or clinical 
chemistry parameters through the data-cut date, excluding some liver-related parameters as discussed 
below. 
Most subjects (90.9%; 20 of 22) had at least 1 laboratory abnormality. The maximum toxicity was 
Grade 1 or 2 for 36.4% (8 of 22) of subjects and Grade 3 for 50.0% (11 of 22) of subjects; a transient 
Grade 4 laboratory abnormality (creatine kinase increased) was reported for 1 subject. 
Most laboratory abnormalities were isolated and transient occurrences. No subject had an SAE 
associated with a clinical laboratory abnormality. One subject receiving DRV/co prematurely 
discontinued study drug due to an AE of hyperlipidemia considered related to study drug by the 
investigator.

There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in blood urea nitrogen, uric acid, total protein, 
serum creatinine, serum cystatin C, or albumin through the data-cut date. The median values for each 
renal laboratory parameter remained within normal ranges. 
Most graded renal laboratory abnormalities were Grade 1 or Grade 2; Grade 3 or 4 abnormalities 
included haematuria by quantitative assessment (4 subjects; all female). Clinical laboratory 
abnormalities related to renal laboratory parameters that were reported as AEs included proteinuria in 
2 subjects and haematuria in 1 subject. All of the AEs were Grade 1 and only proteinuria in 1 subject 
was considered related to study drug. 
Creatinine increases and modest decreases in eGFRSchwartz were observed as early as Day 10 
(median increase in creatinine: 0.05 mg/dL; median decrease in eGFRSchwartz: -9.19 mL/min/1.73 
m2) and at all other timepoints. The median changes from baseline at Weeks 24 and 48 were 0.08 
mg/dL at both timepoints for serum creatinine, and -15.77 and -12.03 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively, 
for eGFRSchwartz. These changes stabilized and remained relatively constant from Week 48 to Week 
96 (median increase in creatinine: 0.04 mg/dL; median decrease in eGFRSchwartz: -8.78 mL/min/1.73 
m2), after which an upward trend in serum creatinine and a downward trend in eGFRSchwartz was 
noted. No graded laboratory abnormalities in serum creatinine were observed. In general, renal 
laboratory assessments showed changes consistent with the inhibitory effects of COBI on renal tubular 
creatinine secretion.

There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in median fasting values for total cholesterol, 
direct LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol: HDL cholesterol ratio, triglycerides, or 
glucose through the data-cut date. The median values for each fasting metabolic laboratory analyte 
remained within normal ranges. 
Most graded fasting lipid and glucose abnormalities were Grade 1 or Grade 2; 1 Grade 3 abnormality 
included fasting LDL increased (1 subject). Clinical laboratory abnormalities related to fasting lipid and 
glucose abnormalities that were reported as AEs included hyperlipidemia in 2 subjects (both Grade 2 
and considered related to study drug). 
Hepatic Safety 
Median values for total bilirubin and indirect bilirubin were higher than normal range at various 
timepoints through the data-cut date, including Day 10 and Weeks 32, 48, 120, 156, 168, and 180 
(median range, 1.3 – 2.6 mg/dL). These values in the total group were attributed to higher than 
normal values in the ATV/co group which occurred at most timepoints during the study. 
Hyperbilirubinemia is a known abnormality associated with ATV, which is reversible upon 
discontinuation {REYATAZ® 2018}. Median values for total and indirect bilirubin in the DRV/co group 
remained within normal ranges at all timepoints. Median values for other liver-related parameters 
remained within normal ranges. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse events that led to premature study drug discontinuation were reported for 2 subjects 
(25.0%). 
•  One subject had 2 AEs that led to premature study drug discontinuation: Grade 2 
hyperlipidemia that started on Day 173 and was considered related to study drug by the 
investigator, and Grade 1 acanthosis nigricans that started on Day 222 and was considered

unrelated to study drug. This subject also had an SAE of bipolar disorder. The last dose day 
was Day 614 and last study day was Day 629. 
•  One subject had 2 AEs that led to premature study drug discontinuation: Grade 2 chest pain 
that started on Day 73 and was reported as an SAE, and Grade 1 Becker’s naevus that started 
on Day 56; both events were considered unrelated to study drug. This subject was prematurely 
discontinued from the study at the investigator’s discretion. The last dose day was Day 56 and 
last study day was Day 212. 
Post marketing experience 
Based on the total of 87,045,630 tablets of DRV/COBI FDC distributed (from launch to 30 November 
2018), the estimated exposure is 2,863,342 person-months and 238,612 person-years. 
At the time of finalization of the Summary of Clinical Safefy addendum, which is included in the 
submission, 6 Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Reports/Periodic Safety Update Reports (PBRERs/PSURs) 
have been generated for DRV/COBI covering the period from 19 November 2014 to 18 May 2018 and 
summarizing the post marketing safety data obtained by the MAH. These concluded that based on 
review of nonclinical, clinical, epidemiologic information, scientific literature, and post marketing data, 
the DRV/COBI FDC continues to demonstrate a favourable benefit risk profile for its authorized 
indications. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of both single compounds of Rezolsta, DRV and COBI, in adolescents has been assessed 
before and is described in the Prezista (DRV) product information, as well as in the one of the fixed-
dose combination tablets including COBI that are indicated for use in adolescents (Genvoya, Symtuza, 
Stribild). The conclusion of the available data at that time was that the overall safety profile of in 
paediatric patients aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing at least 40 kg was similar to that observed in 
the adult population. There is no indication from the available data for these 4 products that DRV or 
COBI affects pubertal development or growth in adolescents.    
The only new information in the current submission comes from Study GS-US-216-0128, which 
included 7 patients on DRV/co which is considered too small to draw meaningful conclusions regarding 
the Rezolsta safety profile. However, the available safety data from this study did not reveal safety 
concerns that would preclude it’s use in adolescents. Two of the eight (25%) subjects discontinued the 
study early due to adverse events. In one subject, this was due to Grade 2 hyperlipidemia (considered 
related to study drug by the investigator) and Grade 1 acanthosis nigricans (considered unrelated to 
study drug). The other subject discontinued with Grade 2 chest pain and Grade 1 Becker’s naevus; 
both events were considered unrelated to study drug. Hyperlipidemia is a known AR with DRV/Cobi 
and is already listed as ‘common’ in section 4.8 of the Rezolsta SmPC, the other AEs mentioned above 
were considered unrelated to study drug which can be agreed with.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the available safety data showed that DRV and COBI is well tolerated in HIV-1 infected 
adolescents (12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg) and that the safety profile of DRV and 
COBI is similar to that observed in adults. The safety profile of DRV and COBI FDC is largely based on 
the well-established safety profile of the individual components and it has been previously assessed in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17523/2020  
Page 43/51 
 
 
 
 
other procedures (i.e. Prezista, Symtuza). The observed safety profile is in line with expectations and 
did not raise additional concerns.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted requested to submit an updated RMP version with this application.  
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 6.0 is acceptable.

of the risk minimisation measures 
Risk minimisation measures 
The PRAC Rapporteur having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indications 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. For further details, refer to the to 
the full SmPC in attachment 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
- 
The patient information leaflet (PIL) for REZOLSTA (adult indication) has been created, starting 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/17523/2020  
Page 44/51 
 
 
 
 
from the approved PREZISTA PIL (the “parent”) and additional information, mainly triggered by 
the presence of COBI in the FDC, has been added (text from the approved COBI leaflet was used 
where possible). A justification for not performing user testing for REZOLSTA was included in the 
initial Marketing Authorisation Application, that has been approved on 19 November 2014. For 
PREZISTA, full user testing in compliance with the above-mentioned legislative requirements was 
performed (n=37 participants) on the initial patient leaflet for PREZISTA 300 mg film-coated 
tablets (EMEA/H/C/000707, approved on 12 February 2007). 
- 
The proposed updated indication for REZOLSTA is an extension of the target group of users (i.e. 
antiretroviral treatment naïve or experienced HIV-1 infected adults and paediatric subjects [≥12 to 
< 18 years of age] and weighing at least 40 kg, without DRV resistance associated mutations 
(RAMs) and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL and CD4+ cell count ≥
100 cells x 106/ L). No new tablet strength or formulation, or new route of administration is 
proposed. 
-  Safety analyses of the studies in adolescent subjects did not identify new safety concerns 
compared to the known safety profile of DRV and COBI in ARV treatment-naïve and treatment-
experienced HIV-1 infected adults. The DRV/COBI safety profile, as established in ARV treatment-
naïve and treatment experienced HIV-1 infected adults, was confirmed in ARV treatment-naïve and 
treatment experienced HIV-1 infected adolescents. 
- 
Full user testing in compliance with the above-mentioned legislative requirements was performed 
(n=20 participants) on the patient leaflet for PREZISTA 75 mg for use in adolescents (ages 14 
through 18 years of age were tested), and the patient leaflet for REZOLSTA has a similar format as 
the patient leaflet for PREZISTA 75 mg tablets. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The 2018 annual report from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS on the global AIDS 
epidemic estimates that worldwide, approximately 160,000 (range: 110,000-260,000) children <15 
years of age were newly infected with HIV-1 in 2017, down from 270,000 in 2010. An estimated 1.8 
million adolescents (10-19 years) were living with HIV-1 in 2016 globally. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The aim of ART in children is to achieve undetectable HIV RNA levels, to provide a high barrier to 
resistance development, to maintain viral suppression, and thus to allow normal immune function, 
whilst minimizing drug toxicities. 
Current paediatric and adolescent guidelines recommend the use of combination ART (cART) with at 
least 3 drugs, usually a dual or triple nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone 
together with either a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI) or a nonnucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). The 2019 PENTA summary guideline that has been out for public 
consultation recommends for children >12 years of age the use of DRV boosted with either ritonavir or 
cobicistat, or DTG as preferred 3rd agent, in combination with an ABC+3TC or TAF+FTC/3TC 
backbone.

EMA/CHMP/17523/2020  
Page 45/51 
 
 
 
 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
For an extension of indication to include adolescents, similar exposure in adolescents vs. adults forms 
the basis of approval. As it is assumed that the PK/PD relation for a direct acting antiviral is roughly 
similar regardless of the age of the patient, the efficacy of a dose that yields sufficiently similar 
exposure in children, compared to adults, would be inferred. 
The MAH submitted the following studies in support of the proposed use in HIV-1 infected adolescents 
(aged ≥12 to <18 years): 
• 
TMC114-C230 (DRV 800 mg in combination with ritonavir [rtv] 100 mg in n=12 ART-naïve 
subjects). 
•  GS-US-216-0128 (DRV 800 or 675 mg in combination with COBI 150 mg [as single agents] in 
n=8 ART-experienced, virologically suppressed subjects).  
•  GS-US-292-0106 (COBI, as part of the elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
alafenamide [E/C/F/TAF] 150/150/200/10 mg FDC in n=50 ART-naïve subjects). 
Study GS-US-216-0218 is the main study for this extension of indication to adolescents. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Results from study GS-US-216-0128 showed that the PK parameters AUCtau, Cmax and Ctau for DRV 
were on average at the same level for the adolescents and adults using the intensive PK data. For 
COBI it was shown that AUCtau and Cmax were similar between adolescents and adults, only mean 
Ctau for the adolescents was 28% higher than for the adults, which means that the boosting effect is 
at least maintained in comparison to the adults. There are no safety issues expected with this 
exposure level.  
Additional analyses comparing adolescent and adult DRV PK data from subjects treated with DRV 
administered as DRV/rtv 800/100 once daily in combination with other ARV drugs (study TMC114-
C211) and COBI PK data from subjects treated with an E/C/F/TAF combination (study vGS-US-292-
0106) supported the conclusion from the main study GS-US-216-0128. 
The virologic success rate (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) at Week 48 in Study GS-US-216-0128 was 
85.7% (6/7 subjects) using the FDA Snapshot Approach. 
None of the subjects experienced protocol-defined virologic failure. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
It should be considered that conclusions on favourable effects were drawn from a very low number of 
subjects. In addition, the emergence of RAMs and phenotypic resistance against DRV and NRTI 
background were rare in all studies up to 192 weeks although the available dataset is limited. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Two subjects (25%) experienced a treatment-emergent study drug related AE (Hyperlipidaemia in 
both cases). Two subjects (25%) prematurely discontinued the study due to treatment-emergent AEs: 
1 subject due to hyperlipidemia and acanthosis nigricans, and the other subject due to chest pain and 
Becker’s naevus.

Page 46/51 
 
 
 
 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The only new information comes from Study GS-US-216-0128, which included only 8 patients on 
DRV/co. Excluding the subject with body weight below the 40 kg cut-off, the total number of patients 
resulted in only 7. This is considered too small to draw meaningful conclusions regarding the Rezolsta 
safety profile. However, as for both components of the FDC it was already concluded that the safety 
profile in adolescents is comparable to that in adults, there is no reason to assume that this will be any 
different for the Rezolsta FDC.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
For extension of the indication to adolescents it is important to show that exposure in adolescents is 
similar to adults. Further, the development of resistance mutations are important, which in turn may 
also have an impact on 2nd line ARV treatment options. As the target population are adolescents, 
potential effects on pubertal development or growth are also of importance. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
PK analyses show comparable drug exposure in adolescents and adults, which is further supported by 
the submitted efficacy data. Therefore, the DRV/COBI FDC combining DRV and COBI at doses of 800 
mg and 150 mg given once daily may be appropriate for use in adolescents aged ≥12 years and 
weighing at least 40 kg. This should be balanced against the risk for development of resistance, which 
in the limited dataset available, seems to be acceptable given that emergence of RAMs and phenotypic 
resistance against DRV and NRTI background were rare in all studies up to 192 weeks. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Rezolsta remains positive. 
4.  Recommendations

(EMA/164014/2018 Rev 2.0.1) including proposed removal of safety concerns.  
In addition, in order to align the PI with recommendations for other HIV products, the MAH has also 
taken the opportunity to update section 4.2 of the SmPC and the product information with regards to 
the administration of Rezolsta in case of vomiting.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0006/2019 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
5.   EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
To extend the approved therapeutic indication of Rezolsta to include the adolescent population (aged 
12 years old and older with body weight at least 40 kg). As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 
5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC and sections 1, 2 and 3 of the PL are updated accordingly. The updated RMP 
version 6.0 has also been submitted. 
The RMP of the product has been updated to meet the requirements and updated definitions in the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP) Module V

Reminders to the MAH 
1. 
In accordance with Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the Agency makes available a 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the medicinal product assessed by the Committee 
for Medicinal Products for Human Use. The EPAR is first published after the granting of the initial 
marketing authorisation (MA) and is continuously updated during the lifecycle of the medicinal 
product. In particular, following a major change to the MA, the Agency further publishes the 
assessment report of the CHMP and the reasons for its opinion in favour of granting the change to 
the authorisation, after deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature. 
2. 
The MAH is reminded to submit an eCTD closing sequence with the final documents provided by 
Eudralink during the procedure (including final PI translations, if applicable) within 15 days after 
the Commission Decision, if there will be one within 2 months from adoption of the CHMP 
Opinion, or prior to the next regulatory activity, whichever is first. If the Commission Decision will 
be adopted within 12 months from CHMP Opinion, the closing sequence should be submitted 
within 30 days after the Opinion. For additional guidance see chapter 4.1 of the Harmonised 
Technical Guidance for eCTD Submissions in the EU. 
3. 
The MAH is reminded that, at the same time as the submission on the eCTD closing sequence 
mentioned above, an updated version of Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP 
agreed at the time of the Opinion should be submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
4. 
If the approved RMP is using Rev. 2 of the ‘Guidance on the format of the RMP in the EU’ and the 
RMP ‘Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan’ has been updated in the procedure, the 
MAH is reminded to provide to the EMA Procedure Assistant by Eudralink a PDF version of the 
‘Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan’ as a standalone document, within 14 calendar 
days of the receipt of the CHMP Opinion. The PDF should contain only text and tables and be free 
of metadata, headers and footers.

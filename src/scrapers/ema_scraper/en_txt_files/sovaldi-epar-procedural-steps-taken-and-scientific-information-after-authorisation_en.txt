Sofosbuvir in a fixed dose combination with ledipasvir was 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC (Epclusa, Harvoni, Sovaldi) and 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 
and 5.2 (Vosevi) in order to add new information 
regarding the use of the sofosbuvir-containing 
products in patients with renal impairment, based on 
final results from studies GS-US-342-4062, GS-US-
administered for 12 weeks to 18 patients with genotype 1 
chronic hepatitis C and severe renal impairment in an 
open-label study (Study 0154). The safety of sofosbuvir in 
a fixed dose combination with either ledipasvir or 
velpatasvir has been studied in 154 patients with ESRD 
requiring dialysis (Study 4062 and Study 4063). In this 
setting, exposure of sofosbuvir metabolite GS-331007 is 
20-fold increased, exceeding levels where adverse 
reactions have been observed in preclinical trials. In this 
Page 6/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
limited clinical safety data set, the rate of adverse events 
and deaths was not clearly elevated from what is expected 
in ESRD patients. 
The CHMP considered that safety data on the use of the 
sofosbuvir-based products in patients with severe renal 
impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 
30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) 
requiring haemodialysis are limited. Overall, the CHMP 
concluded that the sofosbuvir-based products can be used 
in these patients with no dose adjustment when no other 
relevant treatment options are available. 
337-4063 and GS-US-334-0154, listed as a category 
3 study in the RMP and study GS-US-338-1125. 
Study GS-US-342-4062 was a phase 2, multi-centre, 
open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 Weeks in subjects 
with chronic HCV infection who are on dialysis for 
end stage renal disease.  
Study GS-US-337-4063 was a phase 2, multi-centre, 
open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in subjects with genotype 1, 
4, 5 and 6 chronic HCV infection who are on dialysis 
for end stage renal disease.  
Study GS-US-334-0154 was a phase 2b, open label 
study of 200 mg or 400 mg Sofosbuvir+ribavirin for 
24 Weeks in Genotype 1 or 3 HCV infected subjects 
with renal insufficiency.  
Study GS-US-338-1125 was a phase 1, open-label, 
parallel-group, single-dose study to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics of voxilaprevir in subjects with 
normal renal function and severe renal impairment. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The 
RMPs have also been submitted for each of the 
products in this work-sharing procedure.

Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC in order 
implement new information on the use of sofosbuvir-
based therapy with concomitant drugs, based on 
final results from study GS-US-334-2130. This was a 
phase I study to evaluate the effects of cytochrome 
P450 and drug transporter inducers on sofosbuvir 
and probe drug pharmacokinetics in healthy 
subjects.  Furthermore, section 4.3 of the Sovaldi 
SmPC was updated in order to remove the use of 
rifabutin as a contraindication. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In 
addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the 
opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes 
throughout the Product Information.

rifabutin and carbamazepine administration on the drug 
levels of sofosbuvir have been updated throughout the 
Product Information.  
With regards to the rifabutin interaction, a 28% reduction 
in sofosbuvir exposure was observed. Considering that 
reduction in sofosbuvir dose of <50% is expected to be 
safe in terms of potentially reduced efficacy, the CHMP 
concluded that the data support removal of co-
administration of rifabutin as contraindication from the 
Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) Product Information. The 
contraindication is maintained for Epclusa, Harvoni and 
Vosevi, given the lack of data on interactions with the other 
active substances contained in these combination products. 
The data available for interactions with carbamazepine 
indicated that sofosbuvir levels were reduced by 48%, but 
the confidence interval included the 50% value. Therefore, 
the CHMP considered that a cautionary approach should be 
taken and contraindication concerning co-administration of 
carbamazepine should be retained. 
Furthermore, the term “potent P-glycoprotein inducers” 
was replaced by “strong P-glycoprotein inducers” 
throughout the Product Information in line with terminology 
used in the EMA Guideline on the investigation of drug 
interactions.

The scope of this variation is to provide the final study

report for pre-clinical study AD-334-2024, in order to fulfil

Study AD-334-2024 - In Vitro Inhibition Studies of Pgp, 
OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, OAT3, BSEP and MRP2 Transporters 
by High Concentrations of GS-331007 (Nucleoside 
Metabolite of Sofosbuvir).  
This study was requested by the CHMP to provide an 
additional analysis of the potential for pharmacokinetic

drug-drug interactions of GS-331007, the predominant 
metabolite of SOF in plasma and excreta, with human Pgp, 
OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, OAT3, BSEP and MRP2 transporters. 
The CHMP concluded that Sofosbuvir is not a substrate for 
hepatic uptake transporters, organic anion transporting 
polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 or 1B3, and organic cation 
transporter (OCT) 1.  While subject to active tubular 
secretion, GS 331007 is not a substrate for renal 
transporters including organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 or 
3, OCT2, MRP2, P gp, BCRP or MATE1.  Sofosbuvir and GS 
331007 are not inhibitors of drug transporters P gp, BCRP, 
MRP2, BSEP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OCT1.  GS 331007 is 
not an inhibitor of OAT1, OCT2, and MATE1.

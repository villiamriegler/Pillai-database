CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
- 
- 
Prevention of skeletal related events (pathological fractures, spinal compression, radiation or 
surgery to bone, or tumour-induced hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with advanced 
malignancies involving bone. 
Treatment of adult patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Zometa must only be prescribed and administered to patients by healthcare professionals experienced 
in the administration of intravenous bisphosphonates. Patients treated with Zometa should be given the 
package leaflet and the patient reminder card. 
Posology 
Prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone 
Adults and older people 
The recommended dose in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced 
malignancies involving bone is 4 mg zoledronic acid every 3 to 4 weeks. 
Patients should also be administered an oral calcium supplement of 500 mg and 400 IU vitamin D 
daily. 
The decision to treat patients with bone metastases for the prevention of skeletal related events should 
consider that the onset of treatment effect is 2-3 months. 
Treatment of TIH 
Adults and older people 
The recommended dose in hypercalcaemia (albumin-corrected serum calcium ≥ 12.0 mg/dl or 
3.0 mmol/l) is a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid. 
Renal impairment 
TIH: 
Zometa treatment in TIH patients who also have severe renal impairment should be considered only 
after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
creatinine > 400 µmol/l or > 4.5 mg/dl were excluded. No dose adjustment is necessary in TIH 
patients with serum creatinine < 400 µmol/l or < 4.5 mg/dl (see section 4.4). 
Prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone: 
When initiating treatment with Zometa in patients with multiple myeloma or metastatic bone lesions 
from solid tumours, serum creatinine and creatinine clearance (CLcr) should be determined. CLcr is 
calculated from serum creatinine using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Zometa is not recommended for 
patients presenting with severe renal impairment prior to initiation of therapy, which is defined for this 
population as CLcr < 30 ml/min. In clinical trials with Zometa, patients with serum creatinine 
> 265 µmol/l or > 3.0 mg/dl were excluded. 
In patients with bone metastases presenting with mild to moderate renal impairment prior to initiation 
of therapy, which is defined for this population as CLcr 30–60 ml/min, the following Zometa dose is 
recommended (see also section 4.4): 
Baseline creatinine clearance (ml/min) 
> 60 
50–60 
40–49 
30–39 
Zometa recommended dose* 
4.0 mg zoledronic acid 
3.5 mg* zoledronic acid 
3.3 mg* zoledronic acid 
3.0 mg* zoledronic acid 
* Doses have been calculated assuming target AUC of 0.66 (mg•hr/l) (CLcr = 75 ml/min). The 
reduced doses for patients with renal impairment are expected to achieve the same AUC as that seen in 
patients with creatinine clearance of 75 ml/min. 
Following initiation of therapy, serum creatinine should be measured prior to each dose of Zometa and 
treatment should be withheld if renal function has deteriorated. In the clinical trials, renal deterioration 
was defined as follows: 
- 
For patients with normal baseline serum creatinine (< 1.4 mg/dl or < 124 µmol/l), an increase of 
0.5 mg/dl or 44 µmol/l; 
For patients with abnormal baseline creatinine (> 1.4 mg/dl or > 124 µmol/l), an increase of 
1.0 mg/dl or 88 µmol/l. 
- 
In the clinical studies, Zometa treatment was resumed only when the creatinine level returned to 
within 10% of the baseline value (see section 4.4). Zometa treatment should be resumed at the same 
dose as that given prior to treatment interruption. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid in children aged 1 year to 17 years have not been 
established. Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made. 
Method of administration 
Intravenous use. 
Zometa 4 mg powder and solvent for solution for infusion, reconstituted and further diluted in 100 ml 
(see section 6.6), should be given as a single intravenous infusion in no less than 15 minutes. 
In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, reduced Zometa doses are recommended (see 
section “Posology” above and section 4.4). 
Instructions for preparing reduced doses of Zometa 
Withdraw an appropriate volume of the reconstituted solution (4 mg/5 ml) as needed: 
- 
- 
- 
4.4 ml for 3.5 mg dose 
4.1 ml for 3.3 mg dose 
3.8 ml for 3.0 mg dose 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see 
section 6.6. The withdrawn amount of reconstituted solution must be diluted in 100 ml of sterile 0.9% 
w/v sodium chloride solution or 5% w/v glucose solution. The dose must be given as a single 
intravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes. 
Zometa reconstituted solution must not be mixed with calcium or other divalent cation-containing 
infusion solutions such as lactated Ringer’s solution, and should be administered as a single 
intravenous solution in a separate infusion line. 
Patients must be maintained well hydrated prior to and following administration of Zometa. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to other bisphosphonates or to any of the excipients 
listed in section 6.1. 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
General 
Patients must be assessed prior to administration of Zometa to ensure that they are adequately 
hydrated. 
Overhydration should be avoided in patients at risk of cardiac failure. 
Standard hypercalcaemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate 
and magnesium, should be carefully monitored after initiating Zometa therapy. If hypocalcaemia, 
hypophosphataemia, or hypomagnesaemia occurs, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 
Untreated hypercalcaemia patients generally have some degree of renal function impairment, therefore 
careful renal function monitoring should be considered. 
Zometa contains the same active substance as found in Aclasta (zoledronic acid). Patients being 
treated with Zometa should not be treated with Aclasta or any other bisphosphonate concomitantly, 
since the combined effects of these agents are unknown. 
Renal insufficiency 
Patients with TIH and evidence of deterioration in renal function should be appropriately evaluated 
with consideration given as to whether the potential benefit of treatment with Zometa outweighs the 
possible risk. 
The decision to treat patients with bone metastases for the prevention of skeletal related events should 
consider that the onset of treatment effect is 2–3 months. 
Zometa has been associated with reports of renal dysfunction. Factors that may increase the potential 
for deterioration in renal function include dehydration, pre-existing renal impairment, multiple cycles 
of Zometa and other bisphosphonates as well as use of other nephrotoxic medicinal products. While 
the risk is reduced with a dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid administered over 15 minutes, deterioration in 
renal function may still occur. Renal deterioration, progression to renal failure and dialysis have been 
reported in patients after the initial dose or a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid. Increases in serum 
creatinine also occur in some patients with chronic administration of Zometa at recommended doses 
for prevention of skeletal related events, although less frequently. 
Patients should have their serum creatinine levels assessed prior to each dose of Zometa. Upon 
initiation of treatment in patients with bone metastases with mild to moderate renal impairment, lower 
doses of zoledronic acid are recommended. In patients who show evidence of renal deterioration 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
during treatment, Zometa should be withheld. Zometa should only be resumed when serum creatinine 
returns to within 10% of baseline. Zometa treatment should be resumed at the same dose as that given 
prior to treatment interruption. 
In view of the potential impact of zoledronic acid on renal function, the lack of clinical safety data in 
patients with severe renal impairment (in clinical trials defined as serum creatinine ≥ 400 µmol/l or 
≥ 4.5 mg/dl for patients with TIH and ≥ 265 µmol/l or ≥ 3.0 mg/dl for patients with cancer and bone 
metastases, respectively) at baseline and only limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe 
renal impairment at baseline (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), the use of Zometa is not 
recommended in patients with severe renal impairment. 
Hepatic insufficiency 
As only limited clinical data are available in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, no specific 
recommendations can be given for this patient population. 
Osteonecrosis 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported uncommonly in clinical trials in patients receiving 
Zometa. Post-marketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ 
based on tumour type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma). A study showed that ONJ was 
higher in myeloma patients when compared to other cancers (see section 5.1). 
The start of treatment or of a new course of treatment should be delayed in patients with unhealed 
open soft tissue lesions in the mouth, except in medical emergency situations. A dental examination 
with appropriate preventive dentistry and an individual benefit-risk assessment is recommended prior 
to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with concomitant risk factors. 
The following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an individual’s risk of developing 
ONJ: 
- 
Potency of the bisphosphonate (higher risk for highly potent compounds), route of 
administration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative dose of 
bisphosphonate. 
Cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking. 
Concomitant therapies: chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors (see section 4.5), radiotherapy to 
neck and head, corticosteroids. 
History of dental disease, poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, invasive dental procedures 
(e.g. tooth extractions) and poorly fitting dentures. 
- 
- 
- 
All patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, undergo routine dental check-ups, 
and immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, or non-healing of 
sores or discharge during treatment with Zometa. While on treatment, invasive dental procedures 
should be performed only after careful consideration and be avoided in close proximity to zoledronic 
acid administration. For patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate 
therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there 
are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk 
of osteonecrosis of the jaw. 
The management plan for patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration between 
the treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary interruption of 
zoledronic acid treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing risk 
factors are mitigated where possible. 
Osteonecrosis of other anatomical sites 
Osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in 
association with long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of the external auditory 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
canal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or trauma. The 
possibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving 
bisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including chronic ear infections. 
Additionally, there have been sporadic reports of osteonecrosis of other sites, including the hip and 
femur, reported predominantly in adult cancer patients treated with Zometa. 
Musculoskeletal pain 
In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain 
have been reported in patients taking Zometa. However, such reports have been infrequent. The time 
to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting treatment. Most patients had 
relief of symptoms after stopping treatment. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged 
with Zometa or another bisphosphonate. 
Atypical fractures of the femur 
Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate 
therapy, primarily in patients receiving long-term treatment for osteoporosis. These transverse or short 
oblique fractures can occur anywhere along the femur from just below the lesser trochanter to just 
above the supracondylar flare. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients 
experience thigh or groin pain, often associated with imaging features of stress fractures, weeks to 
months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the 
contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a 
femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. Discontinuation of 
bisphosphonate therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered 
pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. 
During bisphosphonate treatment patients should be advised to report any thigh, hip or groin pain and 
any patient presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femur fracture. 
Hypocalcaemia 
Hypocalcaemia has been reported in patients treated with Zometa. Cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic 
adverse events (including convulsions, hypoaesthesia and tetany) have been reported secondary to 
cases of severe hypocalcaemia. Cases of severe hypocalcaemia requiring hospitalisation have been 
reported. In some instances, the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening (see section 4.8). Caution is 
advised when Zometa is administered with medicinal products known to cause hypocalcaemia, as they 
may have a synergistic effect resulting in severe hypocalcaemia (see section 4.5). Serum calcium 
should be measured and hypocalcaemia must be corrected before initiating Zometa therapy. Patients 
should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D. 
Zometa contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium free”. However, if a solution of common salt (0.9% w/v sodium chloride solution) is used for 
the dilution of Zometa prior to administration then the dose of sodium received would be higher. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
In clinical studies, Zometa has been administered concomitantly with commonly used anticancer 
agents, diuretics, antibiotics and analgesics without clinically apparent interactions occurring. 
Zoledronic acid shows no appreciable binding to plasma proteins and does not inhibit human P450 
enzymes in vitro (see section 5.2), but no formal clinical interaction studies have been performed. 
Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides, calcitonin or loop 
diuretics, since these agents may have an additive effect, resulting in a lower serum calcium level for 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
longer periods than required (see section 4.4). 
Caution is indicated when Zometa is used with other potentially nephrotoxic medicinal products. 
Attention should also be paid to the possibility of hypomagnesaemia developing during treatment. 
In multiple myeloma patients, the risk of renal dysfunction may be increased when Zometa is used in 
combination with thalidomide. 
Caution is advised when Zometa is administered with anti-angiogenic medicinal products as an 
increase in the incidence of ONJ has been observed in patients treated concomitantly with these 
medicinal products. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data on the use of zoledronic acid in pregnant women. Animal reproduction 
studies with zoledronic acid have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for 
humans is unknown. Zometa should not be used during pregnancy. Women of child-bearing potential 
should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether zoledronic acid is excreted into human milk. Zometa is contraindicated in 
breast-feeding women (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
Zoledronic acid was evaluated in rats for potential adverse effects on fertility of the parental and F1 
generation. This resulted in exaggerated pharmacological effects considered to be related to the 
compound’s inhibition of skeletal calcium metabolisation, resulting in periparturient hypocalcaemia, a 
bisphosphonate class effect, dystocia and early termination of the study. Thus these results precluded 
determining a definitive effect of zoledronic acid on fertility in humans. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Adverse reactions, such as dizziness and somnolence, may have influence on the ability to drive or use 
machines, therefore caution should be exercised with the use of Zometa along with driving and 
operating of machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Within three days after Zometa administration, an acute phase reaction has commonly been reported, 
with symptoms including bone pain, fever, fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia, rigors and arthritis with 
subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within a few days (see description of 
selected adverse reactions). 
The following are the important identified risks with Zometa in the approved indications: 
Renal function impairment, osteonecrosis of the jaw, acute phase reaction, hypocalcaemia, atrial 
fibrillation, anaphylaxis, interstitial lung disease. The frequencies for each of these identified risks are 
shown in Table 1.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Renal function impairment 
Zometa has been associated with reports of renal dysfunction. In a pooled analysis of safety data from 
Zometa registration trials for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with advanced 
malignancies involving bone, the frequency of renal impairment adverse events suspected to be related 
to Zometa (adverse reactions) was as follows: multiple myeloma (3.2%), prostate cancer (3.1%), 
breast cancer (4.3%), lung and other solid tumours (3.2%). Factors that may increase the potential for 
deterioration in renal function include dehydration, pre-existing renal impairment, multiple cycles of 
Zometa or other bisphosphonates, as well as concomitant use of nephrotoxic medicinal products or 
using a shorter infusion time than currently recommended. Renal deterioration, progression to renal 
failure and dialysis have been reported in patients after the initial dose or a single dose of 4 mg 
zoledronic acid (see section 4.4). 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw 
Cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with 
medicinal products that inhibit bone resorption, such as Zometa (see section 4.4). Many of these 
patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids and had signs of local infection 
including osteomyelitis. The majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extractions 
or other dental surgeries. 
Atrial fibrillation 
In one 3-year, randomised, double-blind controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of 
zoledronic acid 5 mg once yearly vs. placebo in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), 
the overall incidence of atrial fibrillation was 2.5% (96 out of 3,862) and 1.9% (75 out of 3,852) in 
patients receiving zoledronic acid 5 mg and placebo, respectively. The rate of atrial fibrillation serious 
adverse events was 1.3% (51 out of 3,862) and 0.6% (22 out of 3,852) in patients receiving zoledronic 
acid 5 mg and placebo, respectively. The imbalance observed in this trial has not been observed in 
other trials with zoledronic acid, including those with Zometa (zoledronic acid) 4 mg every 3-4 weeks 
in oncology patients. The mechanism behind the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation in this single 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
clinical trial is unknown. 
Acute phase reaction 
This adverse drug reaction consists of a constellation of symptoms that includes fever, myalgia, 
headache, extremity pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, arthralgia and arthritis with subsequent joint 
swelling. The onset time is ≤ 3 days post-Zometa infusion, and the reaction is also referred to using the 
terms “flu-like” or “post-dose” symptoms. 
Atypical fractures of the femur 
During post-marketing experience the following reactions have been reported (frequency rare): 
Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures (bisphopsphonate class adverse reaction). 
Hypocalcaemia-related ADRs 
Hypocalcaemia is an important identified risk with Zometa in the approved indications. Based on the 
review of both clinical trial and post-marketing cases, there is sufficient evidence to support an 
association between Zometa therapy, the reported event of hypocalcaemia, and the secondary 
development of cardiac arrhythmia. Furthermore, there is evidence of an association between 
hypocalcaemia and secondary neurological events reported in these cases including; convulsions, 
hypoaesthesia and tetany (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Clinical experience with acute overdose of Zometa is limited. The administration of doses up to 48 mg 
of zoledronic acid in error has been reported. Patients who have received doses higher than those 
recommended (see section 4.2) should be carefully monitored, since renal function impairment 
(including renal failure) and serum electrolyte (including calcium, phosphorus and magnesium) 
abnormalities have been observed. In the event of hypocalcaemia, calcium gluconate infusions should 
be administered as clinically indicated.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for treatment of bone diseases, bisphosphonates, ATC code: 
M05BA08 
Zoledronic acid belongs to the class of bisphosphonates and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor of 
osteoclastic bone resorption. 
The selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralised bone, 
but the precise molecular mechanism leading to the inhibition of osteoclastic activity is still unclear. In 
long-term animal studies, zoledronic acid inhibits bone resorption without adversely affecting the 
formation, mineralisation or mechanical properties of bone. 
In addition to being a potent inhibitor of bone resorption, zoledronic acid also possesses several anti-
tumour properties that could contribute to its overall efficacy in the treatment of metastatic bone 
disease. The following properties have been demonstrated in preclinical studies: 
- 
In vivo: Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption, which alters the bone marrow 
microenvironment, making it less conducive to tumour cell growth, anti-angiogenic activity and 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
anti-pain activity. 
In vitro: Inhibition of osteoblast proliferation, direct cytostatic and pro-apoptotic activity on 
tumour cells, synergistic cytostatic effect with other anti-cancer drugs, anti-adhesion/invasion 
activity. 
Clinical trial results in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies 
involving bone 
The first randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared zoledronic acid 4 mg to 
placebo for the prevention of skeletal related events (SREs) in prostate cancer patients. Zoledronic 
acid 4 mg significantly reduced the proportion of patients experiencing at least one skeletal related 
event (SRE), delayed the median time to first SRE by > 5 months, and reduced the annual incidence of 
events per patient - skeletal morbidity rate. Multiple event analysis showed a 36% risk reduction in 
developing SREs in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group compared with placebo. Patients receiving 
zoledronic acid 4 mg reported less increase in pain than those receiving placebo, and the difference 
reached significance at months 3, 9, 21 and 24. Fewer zoledronic acid 4 mg patients suffered 
pathological fractures. The treatment effects were less pronounced in patients with blastic lesions. 
Efficacy results are provided in Table 2. 
In a second study including solid tumours other than breast or prostate cancer, zoledronic acid 4 mg 
significantly reduced the proportion of patients with an SRE, delayed the median time to first SRE by 
> 2 months, and reduced the skeletal morbidity rate. Multiple event analysis showed 30.7% risk 
reduction in developing SREs in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group compared with placebo. Efficacy 
results are provided in Table 3.

In a third phase III randomised, double-blind trial, zoledronic acid 4 mg or 90 mg pamidronate every 3 
to 4 weeks were compared in patients with multiple myeloma or breast cancer with at least one bone 
lesion. The results demonstrated that zoledronic acid 4 mg showed comparable efficacy to 90 mg 
pamidronate in the prevention of SREs. The multiple event analysis revealed a significant risk 
reduction of 16% in patients treated with zoledronic acid 4 mg in comparison with patients receiving 
pamidronate. Efficacy results are provided in Table 4.

Zoledronic acid 4 mg was also studied in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in 
228 patients with documented bone metastases from breast cancer to evaluate the effect of 4 mg 
zoledronic acid on the skeletal related event (SRE) rate ratio, calculated as the total number of SRE 
events (excluding hypercalcaemia and adjusted for prior fracture), divided by the total risk period. 
Patients received either 4 mg zoledronic acid or placebo every four weeks for one year. Patients were 
evenly distributed between zoledronic acid-treated and placebo groups. 
The SRE rate (events/person year) was 0.628 for zoledronic acid and 1.096 for placebo. The 
proportion of patients with at least one SRE (excluding hypercalcaemia) was 29.8% in the zoledronic 
acid-treated group versus 49.6% in the placebo group (p=0.003). Median time to onset of the first SRE 
was not reached in the zoledronic acid-treated arm at the end of the study and was significantly 
prolonged compared to placebo (p=0.007). Zoledronic acid 4 mg reduced the risk of SREs by 41% in a 
multiple event analysis (risk ratio=0.59, p=0.019) compared with placebo. 
In the zoledronic acid-treated group, statistically significant improvement in pain scores (using the 
Brief Pain Inventory, BPI) was seen at 4 weeks and at every subsequent time point during the study, 
when compared to placebo (Figure 1). The pain score for zoledronic acid was consistently below 
baseline and pain reduction was accompanied by a trend in reduced analgesics score.

CZOL446EUS122/SWOG study 
The primary objective of this observational study was to estimate the cumulative incidence of 
osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) at 3 years in cancer patients with bone metastasis receiving zoledronic 
acid. The osteoclast inhibition therapy, other cancer therapy, and dental care was performed as 
clinically indicated in order to best represent academic and community-based care. A baseline dental 
examination was recommended but was not mandatory. 
Among the 3491 evaluable patients, 87 cases of ONJ diagnosis were confirmed. The overall estimated 
cumulative incidence of confirmed ONJ at 3 years was 2.8% (95% CI: 2.3-3.5%). The rates were 0.8% 
at year 1 and 2.0% at year 2. Rates of 3-year confirmed ONJ were highest in myeloma patients (4.3%) 
and lowest in breast cancer patients (2.4%). Cases of confirmed ONJ were statistically significantly 
higher in patients with multiple myeloma (p=0.03) than other cancers combined. 
Clinical trial results in the treatment of TIH 
Clinical studies in tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH) demonstrated that the effect of zoledronic 
acid is characterised by decreases in serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion. In Phase I dose 
finding studies in patients with mild to moderate tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH), effective 
doses tested were in the range of approximately 1.2–2.5 mg. 
To assess the effects of 4 mg zoledronic acid versus pamidronate 90 mg, the results of two pivotal 
multicentre studies in patients with TIH were combined in a pre-planned analysis. There was faster 
normalisation of corrected serum calcium at day 4 for 8 mg zoledronic acid and at day 7 for 4 mg and 
8 mg zoledronic acid. The following response rates were observed:

Median time to normocalcaemia was 4 days. Median time to relapse (re-increase of albumin-corrected 
serum calcium ≥ 2.9 mmol/l) was 30 to 40 days for patients treated with zoledronic acid versus 
17 days for those treated with pamidronate 90 mg (p-values: 0.001 for 4 mg and 0.007 for 8 mg 
zoledronic acid). There were no statistically significant differences between the two zoledronic acid 
doses. 
In clinical trials 69 patients who relapsed or were refractory to initial treatment (zoledronic acid 4 mg, 
8 mg or pamidronate 90 mg) were retreated with 8 mg zoledronic acid. The response rate in these 
patients was about 52%. Since those patients were retreated with the 8 mg dose only, there are no data 
available allowing comparison with the 4 mg zoledronic acid dose. 
In clinical trials performed in patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH), the overall safety 
profile amongst all three treatment groups (zoledronic acid 4 and 8 mg and pamidronate 90 mg) was 
similar in types and severity. 
Paediatric population 
Clinical trial results in the treatment of severe osteogenesis imperfecta in paediatric patients aged 1 to 
17 years 
The effects of intravenous zoledronic acid in the treatment of paediatric patients (age 1 to 17 years) 
with severe osteogenesis imperfecta (types I, III and IV) were compared to intravenous pamidronate in 
one international, multicentre, randomised, open-label study with 74 and 76 patients in each treatment 
group, respectively. The study treatment period was 12 months preceded by a 4- to 9-week screening 
period during which vitamin D and elemental calcium supplements were taken for at least 2 weeks. In 
the clinical programme patients aged 1 to < 3 years received 0.025 mg/kg zoledronic acid (up to a 
maximum single dose of 0.35 mg) every 3 months and patients aged 3 to 17 years received 0.05 mg/kg 
zoledronic acid (up to a maximum single dose of 0.83 mg) every 3 months. An extension study was 
conducted in order to examine the long-term general and renal safety of once yearly or twice yearly 
zoledronic acid over the 12-month extension treatment period in children who had completed one year 
of treatment with either zoledronic acid or pamidronate in the core study. 
The primary endpoint of the study was the percent change from baseline in lumbar spine bone mineral 
density (BMD) after 12 months of treatment. Estimated treatment effects on BMD were similar, but 
the trial design was not sufficiently robust to establish non-inferior efficacy for zoledronic acid. In 
particular there was no clear evidence of efficacy on incidence of fracture or on pain. Fracture adverse 
events of long bones in the lower extremities were reported in approximately 24% (femur) and 14% 
(tibia) of zoledronic acid-treated patients vs 12% and 5% of pamidronate-treated patients with severe 
osteogenesis imperfecta, regardless of disease type and causality but overall incidence of fractures was 
comparable for the zoledronic acid and pamidronate-treated patients: 43% (32/74) vs 41% (31/76). 
Interpretation of the risk of fracture is confounded by the fact that fractures are common events in 
patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta as part of the disease process. 
The type of adverse reactions observed in this population were similar to those previously seen in 
adults with advanced malignancies involving the bone (see section 4.8). The adverse reactions ranked 
under headings of frequency, are presented in Table 6. The following conventional classification is 
used: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare 
(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available 
data).

1 Adverse events occurring with frequencies < 5% were medically assessed and it was shown that 
these cases are consistent with the well established safety profile of Zometa (see section 4.8) 
In paediatric patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta, zoledronic acid seems to be associated with 
more pronounced risks for acute phase reaction, hypocalcaemia and unexplained tachycardia, in 
comparison to pamidronate, but this difference declined after subsequent infusions. 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
zoledronic acid in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of tumour-induced 
hypercalcaemia and prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with advanced malignancies 
involving bone (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Single and multiple 5- and 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledronic acid in 64 patients 
with bone metastases yielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which were found to be dose 
independent. 
After initiating the infusion of zoledronic acid, the plasma concentrations of zoledronic acid rapidly 
increased, achieving their peak at the end of the infusion period, followed by a rapid decline to < 10% 
of peak after 4 hours and < 1% of peak after 24 hours, with a subsequent prolonged period of very low 
concentrations not exceeding 0.1% of peak prior to the second infusion of zoledronic acid on day 28. 
Intravenously administered zoledronic acid is eliminated by a triphasic process: rapid biphasic 
disappearance from the systemic circulation, with half-lives of t½α 0.24 and t½β 1.87 hours, followed by 
a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t½γ 146 hours. There was no 
accumulation of zoledronic acid in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. Zoledronic acid is 
not metabolised and is excreted unchanged via the kidney. Over the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the 
administered dose is recovered in the urine, while the remainder is principally bound to bone tissue. 
From the bone tissue it is released very slowly back into the systemic circulation and eliminated via 
the kidney. The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l/h, independent of dose, and unaffected by gender, 
age, race, and body weight. Increasing the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a 30% decrease 
in zoledronic acid concentration at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the 
plasma concentration versus time curve. 
The interpatient variability in pharmacokinetic parameters for zoledronic acid was high, as seen with 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
other bisphosphonates. 
No pharmacokinetic data for zoledronic acid are available in patients with hypercalcaemia or in 
patients with hepatic insufficiency. Zoledronic acid does not inhibit human P450 enzymes in vitro, 
shows no biotransformation and in animal studies < 3% of the administered dose was recovered in the 
faeces, suggesting no relevant role of liver function in the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid. 
The renal clearance of zoledronic acid was correlated with creatinine clearance, renal clearance 
representing 75 ± 33% of the creatinine clearance, which showed a mean of 84 ± 29 ml/min (range 22 
to 143 ml/min) in the 64 cancer patients studied. Population analysis showed that for a patient with 
creatinine clearance of 20 ml/min (severe renal impairment), or 50 ml/min (moderate impairment), the 
corresponding predicted clearance of zoledronic acid would be 37% or 72%, respectively, of that of a 
patient showing creatinine clearance of 84 ml/min. Only limited pharmacokinetic data are available in 
patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). 
In an in vitro study, zoledronic acid showed low affinity for the cellular components of human blood, 
with a mean blood to plasma concentration ratio of 0.59 in a concentration range of 30 ng/ml to 
5000 ng/ml. The plasma protein binding is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% at 
2 ng/ml to 77% at 2000 ng/ml of zoledronic acid. 
Special populations 
Paediatric patients 
Limited pharmacokinetic data in children with severe osteogenesis imperfecta suggest that zoledronic 
acid pharmacokinetics in children aged 3 to 17 years are similar to those in adults at a similar mg/kg 
dose level. Age, body weight, gender and creatinine clearance appear to have no effect on zoledronic 
acid systemic exposure. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Acute toxicity 
The highest non-lethal single intravenous dose was 10 mg/kg bodyweight in mice and 0.6 mg/kg in 
rats. 
Subchronic and chronic toxicity 
Zoledronic acid was well tolerated when administered subcutaneously to rats and intravenously to 
dogs at doses up to 0.02 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks. Administration of 0.001 mg/kg/day subcutaneously 
in rats and 0.005 mg/kg intravenously once every 2–3 days in dogs for up to 52 weeks was also well 
tolerated. 
The most frequent finding in repeat-dose studies consisted of increased primary spongiosa in the 
metaphyses of long bones in growing animals at nearly all doses, a finding that reflected the 
compound’s pharmacological antiresorptive activity. 
The safety margins relative to renal effects were narrow in the long-term repeat-dose parenteral animal 
studies but the cumulative no adverse event levels (NOAELs) in the single dose (1.6 mg/kg) and 
multiple dose studies of up to one month (0.06–0.6 mg/kg/day) did not indicate renal effects at doses 
equivalent to or exceeding the highest intended human therapeutic dose. Longer-term repeat 
administration at doses bracketing the highest intended human therapeutic dose of zoledronic acid 
produced toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen and 
lungs, and at intravenous injection sites. 
Reproduction toxicity 
Zoledronic acid was teratogenic in the rat at subcutaneous doses ≥ 0.2 mg/kg. Although no 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
teratogenicity or foetotoxicity was observed in the rabbit, maternal toxicity was found. Dystocia was 
observed at the lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg bodyweight) tested in the rat. 
Mutagenicity and carcinogenic potential 
Zoledronic acid was not mutagenic in the mutagenicity tests performed and carcinogenicity testing did 
not provide any evidence of carcinogenic potential.

- 
- 
Prevention of skeletal related events (pathological fractures, spinal compression, radiation or 
surgery to bone, or tumour-induced hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with advanced 
malignancies involving bone. 
Treatment of adult patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Zometa must only be prescribed and administered to patients by healthcare professionals experienced 
in the administration of intravenous bisphosphonates. Patients treated with Zometa should be given the 
package leaflet and the patient reminder card. 
Posology 
Prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone 
Adults and older people 
The recommended dose in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced 
malignancies involving bone is 4 mg zoledronic acid every 3 to 4 weeks. 
Patients should also be administered an oral calcium supplement of 500 mg and 400 IU vitamin D 
daily. 
The decision to treat patients with bone metastases for the prevention of skeletal related events should 
consider that the onset of treatment effect is 2-3 months. 
Treatment of TIH 
Adults and older people 
The recommended dose in hypercalcaemia (albumin-corrected serum calcium ≥ 12.0 mg/dl or 
3.0 mmol/l) is a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid.

Renal impairment 
TIH: 
Zometa treatment in TIH patients who also have severe renal impairment should be considered only 
after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum 
creatinine > 400 µmol/l or > 4.5 mg/dl were excluded. No dose adjustment is necessary in TIH 
patients with serum creatinine < 400 µmol/l or < 4.5 mg/dl (see section 4.4). 
Prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone: 
When initiating treatment with Zometa in patients with multiple myeloma or metastatic bone lesions 
from solid tumours, serum creatinine and creatinine clearance (CLcr) should be determined. CLcr is 
calculated from serum creatinine using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Zometa is not recommended for 
patients presenting with severe renal impairment prior to initiation of therapy, which is defined for this 
population as CLcr < 30 ml/min. In clinical trials with Zometa, patients with serum creatinine 
> 265 µmol/l or > 3.0 mg/dl were excluded. 
In patients with bone metastases presenting with mild to moderate renal impairment prior to initiation 
of therapy, which is defined for this population as CLcr 30–60 ml/min, the following Zometa dose is 
recommended (see also section 4.4): 
Baseline creatinine clearance (ml/min) 
> 60 
50–60 
40–49 
30–39 
Zometa recommended dose* 
4.0 mg zoledronic acid 
3.5 mg* zoledronic acid 
3.3 mg* zoledronic acid 
3.0 mg* zoledronic acid 
* Doses have been calculated assuming target AUC of 0.66 (mg•hr/l) (CLcr = 75 ml/min). The 
reduced doses for patients with renal impairment are expected to achieve the same AUC as that seen in 
patients with creatinine clearance of 75 ml/min. 
Following initiation of therapy, serum creatinine should be measured prior to each dose of Zometa and 
treatment should be withheld if renal function has deteriorated. In the clinical trials, renal deterioration 
was defined as follows: 
- 
For patients with normal baseline serum creatinine (< 1.4 mg/dl or < 124 µmol/l), an increase of 
0.5 mg/dl or 44 µmol/l; 
For patients with abnormal baseline creatinine (> 1.4 mg/dl or > 124 µmol/l), an increase of 
1.0 mg/dl or 88 µmol/l. 
- 
In the clinical studies, Zometa treatment was resumed only when the creatinine level returned to 
within 10% of the baseline value (see section 4.4). Zometa treatment should be resumed at the same 
dose as that given prior to treatment interruption. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid in children aged 1 year to 17 years have not been 
established. Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made. 
Method of administration 
Intravenous use. 
Zometa 4 mg concentrate for solution for infusion, further diluted in 100 ml (see section 6.6), should 
be given as a single intravenous infusion in no less than 15 minutes. 
In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, reduced Zometa doses are recommended (see 
section “Posology” above and section 4.4).

For instructions on the dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. The 
withdrawn amount of concentrate must be further diluted in 100 ml of sterile 0.9% w/v sodium 
chloride solution or 5% w/v glucose solution. The dose must be given as a single intravenous infusion 
over no less than 15 minutes. 
Zometa concentrate must not be mixed with calcium or other divalent cation-containing infusion 
solutions such as lactated Ringer’s solution, and should be administered as a single intravenous 
solution in a separate infusion line. 
Patients must be maintained well hydrated prior to and following administration of Zometa. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to other bisphosphonates or to any of the excipients 
listed in section 6.1. 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
General 
Patients must be assessed prior to administration of Zometa to ensure that they are adequately 
hydrated. 
Overhydration should be avoided in patients at risk of cardiac failure. 
Standard hypercalcaemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate 
and magnesium, should be carefully monitored after initiating Zometa therapy. If hypocalcaemia, 
hypophosphataemia, or hypomagnesaemia occurs, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 
Untreated hypercalcaemia patients generally have some degree of renal function impairment, therefore 
careful renal function monitoring should be considered. 
Zometa contains the same active substance as found in Aclasta (zoledronic acid). Patients being 
treated with Zometa should not be treated with Aclasta or any other bisphosphonate concomitantly, 
since the combined effects of these agents are unknown. 
Renal insufficiency 
Patients with TIH and evidence of deterioration in renal function should be appropriately evaluated 
with consideration given as to whether the potential benefit of treatment with Zometa outweighs the 
possible risk. 
The decision to treat patients with bone metastases for the prevention of skeletal related events should 
consider that the onset of treatment effect is 2–3 months. 
Zometa has been associated with reports of renal dysfunction. Factors that may increase the potential 
for deterioration in renal function include dehydration, pre-existing renal impairment, multiple cycles 
of Zometa and other bisphosphonates as well as use of other nephrotoxic medicinal products. While 
the risk is reduced with a dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid administered over 15 minutes, deterioration in 
renal function may still occur. Renal deterioration, progression to renal failure and dialysis have been 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reported in patients after the initial dose or a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid. Increases in serum 
creatinine also occur in some patients with chronic administration of Zometa at recommended doses 
for prevention of skeletal related events, although less frequently. 
Patients should have their serum creatinine levels assessed prior to each dose of Zometa. Upon 
initiation of treatment in patients with bone metastases with mild to moderate renal impairment, lower 
doses of zoledronic acid are recommended. In patients who show evidence of renal deterioration 
during treatment, Zometa should be withheld. Zometa should only be resumed when serum creatinine 
returns to within 10% of baseline. Zometa treatment should be resumed at the same dose as that given 
prior to treatment interruption. 
In view of the potential impact of zoledronic acid on renal function, the lack of clinical safety data in 
patients with severe renal impairment (in clinical trials defined as serum creatinine ≥ 400 µmol/l or 
≥ 4.5 mg/dl for patients with TIH and ≥ 265 µmol/l or ≥ 3.0 mg/dl for patients with cancer and bone 
metastases, respectively) at baseline and only limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe 
renal impairment at baseline (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), the use of Zometa is not 
recommended in patients with severe renal impairment. 
Hepatic insufficiency 
As only limited clinical data are available in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, no specific 
recommendations can be given for this patient population. 
Osteonecrosis 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported uncommonly in clinical trials in patients receiving 
Zometa. Post-marketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ 
based on tumour type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma). A study showed that ONJ was 
higher in myeloma patients when compared to other cancers (see section 5.1). 
The start of treatment or of a new course of treatment should be delayed in patients with unhealed 
open soft tissue lesions in the mouth, except in medical emergency situations. A dental examination 
with appropriate preventive dentistry and an individual benefit-risk assessment is recommended prior 
to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with concomitant risk factors. 
The following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an individual’s risk of developing 
ONJ: 
- 
Potency of the bisphosphonate (higher risk for highly potent compounds), route of 
administration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative dose of 
bisphosphonate. 
Cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking. 
Concomitant therapies: chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors (see section 4.5), radiotherapy to 
neck and head, corticosteroids. 
History of dental disease, poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, invasive dental procedures 
(e.g. tooth extractions) and poorly fitting dentures. 
- 
- 
- 
All patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, undergo routine dental check-ups, 
and immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, or non-healing of 
sores or discharge during treatment with Zometa. While on treatment, invasive dental procedures 
should be performed only after careful consideration and be avoided in close proximity to zoledronic 
acid administration. For patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate 
therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there 
are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk 
of osteonecrosis of the jaw. 
The management plan for patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration between 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary interruption of 
zoledronic acid treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing risk 
factors are mitigated where possible. 
Osteonecrosis of other anatomical sites 
Osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in 
association with long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of the external auditory 
canal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or trauma. The 
possibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving 
bisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including chronic ear infections. 
Additionally, there have been sporadic reports of osteonecrosis of other sites, including the hip and 
femur, reported predominantly in adult cancer patients treated with Zometa. 
Musculoskeletal pain 
In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain 
have been reported in patients taking Zometa. However, such reports have been infrequent. The time 
to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting treatment. Most patients had 
relief of symptoms after stopping treatment. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged 
with Zometa or another bisphosphonate. 
Atypical fractures of the femur 
Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate 
therapy, primarily in patients receiving long-term treatment for osteoporosis. These transverse or short 
oblique fractures can occur anywhere along the femur from just below the lesser trochanter to just 
above the supracondylar flare. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients 
experience thigh or groin pain, often associated with imaging features of stress fractures, weeks to 
months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the 
contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a 
femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. Discontinuation of 
bisphosphonate therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered 
pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. 
During bisphosphonate treatment patients should be advised to report any thigh, hip or groin pain and 
any patient presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femur fracture. 
Hypocalcaemia 
Hypocalcaemia has been reported in patients treated with Zometa. Cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic 
adverse events (including convulsions, hypoaesthesia and tetany) have been reported secondary to 
cases of severe hypocalcaemia. Cases of severe hypocalcaemia requiring hospitalisation have been 
reported. In some instances, the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening (see section 4.8). Caution is 
advised when Zometa is administered with medicinal products known to cause hypocalcaemia, as they 
may have a synergistic effect resulting in severe hypocalcaemia (see section 4.5). Serum calcium 
should be measured and hypocalcaemia must be corrected before initiating Zometa therapy. Patients 
should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D. 
Zometa contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium free”. However, if a solution of common salt (0.9% w/v sodium chloride solution) is used for 
the dilution of Zometa prior to administration then the dose of sodium received would be higher. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
In clinical studies, Zometa has been administered concomitantly with commonly used anticancer 
agents, diuretics, antibiotics and analgesics without clinically apparent interactions occurring. 
Zoledronic acid shows no appreciable binding to plasma proteins and does not inhibit human P450 
enzymes in vitro (see section 5.2), but no formal clinical interaction studies have been performed. 
Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides, calcitonin or loop 
diuretics, since these agents may have an additive effect, resulting in a lower serum calcium level for 
longer periods than required (see section 4.4). 
Caution is indicated when Zometa is used with other potentially nephrotoxic medicinal products. 
Attention should also be paid to the possibility of hypomagnesaemia developing during treatment. 
In multiple myeloma patients, the risk of renal dysfunction may be increased when Zometa is used in 
combination with thalidomide. 
Caution is advised when Zometa is administered with anti-angiogenic medicinal products, as an 
increase in the incidence of ONJ has been observed in patients treated concomitantly with these 
medicinal products. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data on the use of zoledronic acid in pregnant women. Animal reproduction 
studies with zoledronic acid have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for 
humans is unknown. Zometa should not be used during pregnancy. Women of child-bearing potential 
should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether zoledronic acid is excreted into human milk. Zometa is contraindicated in 
breast-feeding women (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
Zoledronic acid was evaluated in rats for potential adverse effects on fertility of the parental and F1 
generation. This resulted in exaggerated pharmacological effects considered to be related to the 
compound’s inhibition of skeletal calcium metabolisation, resulting in periparturient hypocalcaemia, a 
bisphosphonate class effect, dystocia and early termination of the study. Thus these results precluded 
determining a definitive effect of zoledronic acid on fertility in humans. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Adverse reactions, such as dizziness and somnolence, may have influence on the ability to drive or use 
machines, therefore caution should be exercised with the use of Zometa along with driving and 
operating of machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Within three days after Zometa administration, an acute phase reaction has commonly been reported, 
with symptoms including bone pain, fever, fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia, rigors and arthritis with 
subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within a few days (see description of 
selected adverse reactions).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Renal function impairment 
Zometa has been associated with reports of renal dysfunction. In a pooled analysis of safety data from 
Zometa registration trials for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with advanced 
malignancies involving bone, the frequency of renal impairment adverse events suspected to be related 
to Zometa (adverse reactions) was as follows: multiple myeloma (3.2%), prostate cancer (3.1%), 
breast cancer (4.3%), lung and other solid tumours (3.2%). Factors that may increase the potential for 
deterioration in renal function include dehydration, pre-existing renal impairment, multiple cycles of 
Zometa or other bisphosphonates, as well as concomitant use of nephrotoxic medicinal products or 
using a shorter infusion time than currently recommended. Renal deterioration, progression to renal 
failure and dialysis have been reported in patients after the initial dose or a single dose of 4 mg 
zoledronic acid (see section 4.4). 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw 
Cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with 
medicinal products that inhibit bone resorption, such as Zometa (see section 4.4). Many of these 
patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids and had signs of local infection 
including osteomyelitis. The majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extractions 
or other dental surgeries. 
Atrial fibrillation 
In one 3-year, randomised, double-blind controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of 
zoledronic acid 5 mg once yearly vs. placebo in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), 
the overall incidence of atrial fibrillation was 2.5% (96 out of 3,862) and 1.9% (75 out of 3,852) in 
patients receiving zoledronic acid 5 mg and placebo, respectively. The rate of atrial fibrillation serious 
adverse events was 1.3% (51 out of 3,862) and 0.6% (22 out of 3,852) in patients receiving zoledronic 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
acid 5 mg and placebo, respectively. The imbalance observed in this trial has not been observed in 
other trials with zoledronic acid, including those with Zometa (zoledronic acid) 4 mg every 3-4 weeks 
in oncology patients. The mechanism behind the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation in this single 
clinical trial is unknown. 
Acute phase reaction 
This adverse drug reaction consists of a constellation of symptoms that includes fever, myalgia, 
headache, extremity pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea arthralgia and arthritis with subsequent joint 
swelling. The onset time is ≤ 3 days post-Zometa infusion, and the reaction is also referred to using the 
terms “flu-like” or “post-dose” symptoms. 
Atypical fractures of the femur 
During post-marketing experience the following reactions have been reported (frequency rare): 
Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures (bisphopsphonate class adverse reaction). 
Hypocalcaemia-related ADRs 
Hypocalcaemia is an important identified risk with Zometa in the approved indications. Based on the 
review of both clinical trial and post-marketing cases, there is sufficient evidence to support an 
association between Zometa therapy, the reported event of hypocalcaemia, and the secondary 
development of cardiac arrhythmia. Furthermore, there is evidence of an association between 
hypocalcaemia and secondary neurological events reported in these cases including; convulsions, 
hypoaesthesia and tetany (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Clinical experience with acute overdose of Zometa is limited. The administration of doses up to 48 mg 
of zoledronic acid in error has been reported. Patients who have received doses higher than those 
recommended (see section 4.2) should be carefully monitored, since renal function impairment 
(including renal failure) and serum electrolyte (including calcium, phosphorus and magnesium) 
abnormalities have been observed. In the event of hypocalcaemia, calcium gluconate infusions should 
be administered as clinically indicated. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for treatment of bone diseases, bisphosphonates, ATC code: 
M05BA08 
Zoledronic acid belongs to the class of bisphosphonates and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor of 
osteoclastic bone resorption. 
The selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralised bone, 
but the precise molecular mechanism leading to the inhibition of osteoclastic activity is still unclear. In 
long-term animal studies, zoledronic acid inhibits bone resorption without adversely affecting the 
formation, mineralisation or mechanical properties of bone. 
In addition to being a potent inhibitor of bone resorption, zoledronic acid also possesses several anti-
tumour properties that could contribute to its overall efficacy in the treatment of metastatic bone 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disease. The following properties have been demonstrated in preclinical studies: 
- 
In vivo: Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption, which alters the bone marrow 
microenvironment, making it less conducive to tumour cell growth, anti-angiogenic activity and 
anti-pain activity. 
In vitro: Inhibition of osteoblast proliferation, direct cytostatic and pro-apoptotic activity on 
tumour cells, synergistic cytostatic effect with other anti-cancer drugs, anti-adhesion/invasion 
activity. 
- 
Clinical trial results in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies 
involving bone 
The first randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared zoledronic acid 4 mg to 
placebo for the prevention of skeletal related events (SREs) in prostate cancer patients. Zoledronic 
acid 4 mg significantly reduced the proportion of patients experiencing at least one skeletal related 
event (SRE), delayed the median time to first SRE by > 5 months, and reduced the annual incidence of 
events per patient - skeletal morbidity rate. Multiple event analysis showed a 36% risk reduction in 
developing SREs in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group compared with placebo. Patients receiving 
zoledronic acid 4 mg reported less increase in pain than those receiving placebo, and the difference 
reached significance at months 3, 9, 21 and 24. Fewer zoledronic acid 4 mg patients suffered 
pathological fractures. The treatment effects were less pronounced in patients with blastic lesions. 
Efficacy results are provided in Table 2. 
In a second study including solid tumours other than breast or prostate cancer, zoledronic acid 4 mg 
significantly reduced the proportion of patients with an SRE, delayed the median time to first SRE by 
> 2 months, and reduced the skeletal morbidity rate. Multiple event analysis showed 30.7% risk 
reduction in developing SREs in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group compared with placebo. Efficacy 
results are provided in Table 3.

In a third phase III randomised, double-blind trial, zoledronic acid 4 mg or 90 mg pamidronate every 3 
to 4 weeks were compared in patients with multiple myeloma or breast cancer with at least one bone 
lesion. The results demonstrated that zoledronic acid 4 mg showed comparable efficacy to 90 mg 
pamidronate in the prevention of SREs. The multiple event analysis revealed a significant risk 
reduction of 16% in patients treated with zoledronic acid 4 mg in comparison with patients receiving 
pamidronate. Efficacy results are provided in Table 4.

Zoledronic acid 4 mg was also studied in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in 
228 patients with documented bone metastases from breast cancer to evaluate the effect of 4 mg 
zoledronic acid on the skeletal related event (SRE) rate ratio, calculated as the total number of SRE 
events (excluding hypercalcaemia and adjusted for prior fracture), divided by the total risk period. 
Patients received either 4 mg zoledronic acid or placebo every four weeks for one year. Patients were 
evenly distributed between zoledronic acid-treated and placebo groups. 
The SRE rate (events/person year) was 0.628 for zoledronic acid and 1.096 for placebo. The 
proportion of patients with at least one SRE (excluding hypercalcaemia) was 29.8% in the zoledronic 
acid-treated group versus 49.6% in the placebo group (p=0.003). Median time to onset of the first SRE 
was not reached in the zoledronic acid-treated arm at the end of the study and was significantly 
prolonged compared to placebo (p=0.007). Zoledronic acid 4 mg reduced the risk of SREs by 41% in a 
multiple event analysis (risk ratio=0.59, p=0.019) compared with placebo. 
In the zoledronic acid-treated group, statistically significant improvement in pain scores (using the 
Brief Pain Inventory, BPI) was seen at 4 weeks and at every subsequent time point during the study, 
when compared to placebo (Figure 1). The pain score for zoledronic acid was consistently below 
baseline and pain reduction was accompanied by a trend in reduced analgesics score.

CZOL446EUS122/SWOG study 
The primary objective of this observational study was to estimate the cumulative incidence of 
osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) at 3 years in cancer patients with bone metastasis receiving zoledronic 
acid. The osteoclast inhibition therapy, other cancer therapy, and dental care was performed as 
clinically indicated in order to best represent academic and community-based care. A baseline dental 
examination was recommended but was not mandatory. 
Among the 3491 evaluable patients, 87 cases of ONJ diagnosis were confirmed. The overall estimated 
cumulative incidence of confirmed ONJ at 3 years was 2.8% (95% CI: 2.3-3.5%). The rates were 0.8% 
at year 1 and 2.0% at year 2. Rates of 3-year confirmed ONJ were highest in myeloma patients (4.3%) 
and lowest in breast cancer patients (2.4%). Cases of confirmed ONJ were statistically significantly 
higher in patients with multiple myeloma (p=0.03) than other cancers combined. 
Clinical trial results in the treatment of TIH 
Clinical studies in tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH) demonstrated that the effect of zoledronic 
acid is characterised by decreases in serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion. In Phase I dose 
finding studies in patients with mild to moderate tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH), effective 
doses tested were in the range of approximately 1.2–2.5 mg. 
To assess the effects of 4 mg zoledronic acid versus pamidronate 90 mg, the results of two pivotal 
multicentre studies in patients with TIH were combined in a pre-planned analysis. There was faster 
normalisation of corrected serum calcium at day 4 for 8 mg zoledronic acid and at day 7 for 4 mg and 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 mg zoledronic acid. The following response rates were observed:

Median time to normocalcaemia was 4 days. Median time to relapse (re-increase of albumin-corrected 
serum calcium ≥ 2.9 mmol/l) was 30 to 40 days for patients treated with zoledronic acid versus 
17 days for those treated with pamidronate 90 mg (p-values: 0.001 for 4 mg and 0.007 for 8 mg 
zoledronic acid). There were no statistically significant differences between the two zoledronic acid 
doses. 
In clinical trials 69 patients who relapsed or were refractory to initial treatment (zoledronic acid 4 mg, 
8 mg or pamidronate 90 mg) were retreated with 8 mg zoledronic acid. The response rate in these 
patients was about 52%. Since those patients were retreated with the 8 mg dose only, there are no data 
available allowing comparison with the 4 mg zoledronic acid dose. 
In clinical trials performed in patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH), the overall safety 
profile amongst all three treatment groups (zoledronic acid 4 and 8 mg and pamidronate 90 mg) was 
similar in types and severity. 
Paediatric population 
Clinical trial results in the treatment of severe osteogenesis imperfecta in paediatric patients aged 1 to 
17 years 
The effects of intravenous zoledronic acid in the treatment of paediatric patients (age 1 to 17 years) 
with severe osteogenesis imperfecta (types I, III and IV) were compared to intravenous pamidronate in 
one international, multicentre, randomised, open-label study with 74 and 76 patients in each treatment 
group, respectively. The study treatment period was 12 months preceded by a 4- to 9-week screening 
period during which vitamin D and elemental calcium supplements were taken for at least 2 weeks. In 
the clinical programme patients aged 1 to < 3 years received 0.025 mg/kg zoledronic acid (up to a 
maximum single dose of 0.35 mg) every 3 months and patients aged 3 to 17 years received 0.05 mg/kg 
zoledronic acid (up to a maximum single dose of 0.83 mg) every 3 months. An extension study was 
conducted in order to examine the long-term general and renal safety of once yearly or twice yearly 
zoledronic acid over the 12-month extension treatment period in children who had completed one year 
of treatment with either zoledronic acid or pamidronate in the core study. 
The primary endpoint of the study was the percent change from baseline in lumbar spine bone mineral 
density (BMD) after 12 months of treatment. Estimated treatment effects on BMD were similar, but 
the trial design was not sufficiently robust to establish non-inferior efficacy for zoledronic acid. In 
particular there was no clear evidence of efficacy on incidence of fracture or on pain. Fracture adverse 
events of long bones in the lower extremities were reported in approximately 24% (femur) and 14% 
(tibia) of zoledronic acid-treated patients vs 12% and 5% of pamidronate-treated patients with severe 
osteogenesis imperfecta, regardless of disease type and causality but overall incidence of fractures was 
comparable for the zoledronic acid and pamidronate-treated patients: 43% (32/74) vs 41% (31/76). 
Interpretation of the risk of fracture is confounded by the fact that fractures are common events in 
patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta as part of the disease process. 
The type of adverse reactions observed in this population were similar to those previously seen in 
adults with advanced malignancies involving the bone (see section 4.8). The adverse reactions ranked 
under headings of frequency, are presented in Table 6. The following conventional classification is 
used: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare 
(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available

data).

1 Adverse events occurring with frequencies < 5% were medically assessed and it was shown that 
these cases are consistent with the well established safety profile of Zometa (see section 4.8) 
In paediatric patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta, zoledronic acid seems to be associated with 
more pronounced risks for acute phase reaction, hypocalcaemia and unexplained tachycardia, in 
comparison to pamidronate, but this difference declined after subsequent infusions. 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
zoledronic acid in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of tumour-induced 
hypercalcaemia and prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with advanced malignancies 
involving bone (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Single and multiple 5- and 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledronic acid in 64 patients 
with bone metastases yielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which were found to be dose 
independent. 
After initiating the infusion of zoledronic acid, the plasma concentrations of zoledronic acid rapidly 
increased, achieving their peak at the end of the infusion period, followed by a rapid decline to < 10% 
of peak after 4 hours and < 1% of peak after 24 hours, with a subsequent prolonged period of very low 
concentrations not exceeding 0.1% of peak prior to the second infusion of zoledronic acid on day 28. 
Intravenously administered zoledronic acid is eliminated by a triphasic process: rapid biphasic 
disappearance from the systemic circulation, with half-lives of t½α 0.24 and t½β 1.87 hours, followed by 
a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t½γ 146 hours. There was no 
accumulation of zoledronic acid in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. Zoledronic acid is 
not metabolised and is excreted unchanged via the kidney. Over the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the 
administered dose is recovered in the urine, while the remainder is principally bound to bone tissue. 
From the bone tissue it is released very slowly back into the systemic circulation and eliminated via 
the kidney. The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l/h, independent of dose, and unaffected by gender, 
age, race, and body weight. Increasing the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a 30% decrease 
in zoledronic acid concentration at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the 
plasma concentration versus time curve. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The interpatient variability in pharmacokinetic parameters for zoledronic acid was high, as seen with 
other bisphosphonates. 
No pharmacokinetic data for zoledronic acid are available in patients with hypercalcaemia or in 
patients with hepatic insufficiency. Zoledronic acid does not inhibit human P450 enzymes in vitro, 
shows no biotransformation and in animal studies < 3% of the administered dose was recovered in the 
faeces, suggesting no relevant role of liver function in the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid. 
The renal clearance of zoledronic acid was correlated with creatinine clearance, renal clearance 
representing 75 ± 33% of the creatinine clearance, which showed a mean of 84 ± 29 ml/min (range 22 
to 143 ml/min) in the 64 cancer patients studied. Population analysis showed that for a patient with 
creatinine clearance of 20 ml/min (severe renal impairment), or 50 ml/min (moderate impairment), the 
corresponding predicted clearance of zoledronic acid would be 37% or 72%, respectively, of that of a 
patient showing creatinine clearance of 84 ml/min. Only limited pharmacokinetic data are available in 
patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). 
In an in vitro study, zoledronic acid showed low affinity for the cellular components of human blood, 
with a mean blood to plasma concentration ratio of 0.59 in a concentration range of 30 ng/ml to 
5000 ng/ml. The plasma protein binding is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% at 
2 ng/ml to 77% at 2000 ng/ml of zoledronic acid. 
Special populations 
Paediatric patients 
Limited pharmacokinetic data in children with severe osteogenesis imperfecta suggest that zoledronic 
acid pharmacokinetics in children aged 3 to 17 years are similar to those in adults at a similar mg/kg 
dose level. Age, body weight, gender and creatinine clearance appear to have no effect on zoledronic 
acid systemic exposure. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Acute toxicity 
The highest non-lethal single intravenous dose was 10 mg/kg bodyweight in mice and 0.6 mg/kg in 
rats. 
Subchronic and chronic toxicity 
Zoledronic acid was well tolerated when administered subcutaneously to rats and intravenously to 
dogs at doses up to 0.02 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks. Administration of 0.001 mg/kg/day subcutaneously 
in rats and 0.005 mg/kg intravenously once every 2–3 days in dogs for up to 52 weeks was also well 
tolerated. 
The most frequent finding in repeat-dose studies consisted of increased primary spongiosa in the 
metaphyses of long bones in growing animals at nearly all doses, a finding that reflected the 
compound’s pharmacological antiresorptive activity. 
The safety margins relative to renal effects were narrow in the long-term repeat-dose parenteral animal 
studies but the cumulative no adverse event levels (NOAELs) in the single dose (1.6 mg/kg) and 
multiple dose studies of up to one month (0.06–0.6 mg/kg/day) did not indicate renal effects at doses 
equivalent to or exceeding the highest intended human therapeutic dose. Longer-term repeat 
administration at doses bracketing the highest intended human therapeutic dose of zoledronic acid 
produced toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen and 
lungs, and at intravenous injection sites. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reproduction toxicity 
Zoledronic acid was teratogenic in the rat at subcutaneous doses ≥ 0.2 mg/kg. Although no 
teratogenicity or foetotoxicity was observed in the rabbit, maternal toxicity was found. Dystocia was 
observed at the lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg bodyweight) tested in the rat. 
Mutagenicity and carcinogenic potential 
Zoledronic acid was not mutagenic in the mutagenicity tests performed and carcinogenicity testing did 
not provide any evidence of carcinogenic potential.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
- 
- 
Prevention of skeletal related events (pathological fractures, spinal compression, radiation or 
surgery to bone, or tumour-induced hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with advanced 
malignancies involving bone. 
Treatment of adult patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Zometa must only be prescribed and administered to patients by healthcare professionals experienced 
in the administration of intravenous bisphosphonates. Patients treated with Zometa should be given the 
package leaflet and the patient reminder card. 
Posology 
Prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone 
Adults and older people 
The recommended dose in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced 
malignancies involving bone is 4 mg zoledronic acid every 3 to 4 weeks. 
Patients should also be administered an oral calcium supplement of 500 mg and 400 IU vitamin D 
daily. 
The decision to treat patients with bone metastases for the prevention of skeletal related events should 
consider that the onset of treatment effect is 2-3 months. 
Treatment of TIH 
Adults and older people 
The recommended dose in hypercalcaemia (albumin-corrected serum calcium ≥ 12.0 mg/dl or 
3.0 mmol/l) is a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid. 
Renal impairment 
TIH: 
Zometa treatment in TIH patients who also have severe renal impairment should be considered only 
after evaluating the risks and benefits of treatment. In the clinical studies, patients with serum 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
creatinine > 400 µmol/l or > 4.5 mg/dl were excluded. No dose adjustment is necessary in TIH 
patients with serum creatinine < 400 µmol/l or < 4.5 mg/dl (see section 4.4). 
Prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone: 
When initiating treatment with Zometa in patients with multiple myeloma or metastatic bone lesions 
from solid tumours, serum creatinine and creatinine clearance (CLcr) should be determined. CLcr is 
calculated from serum creatinine using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Zometa is not recommended for 
patients presenting with severe renal impairment prior to initiation of therapy, which is defined for this 
population as CLcr < 30 ml/min. In clinical trials with Zometa, patients with serum creatinine 
> 265 µmol/l or > 3.0 mg/dl were excluded. 
For patients with normal renal function (defined as CLcr > 60 ml/min), zoledronic acid 4 mg/100 ml 
solution for infusion may be administered directly without any further preparation. In patients with 
bone metastases presenting with mild to moderate renal impairment prior to initiation of therapy, 
which is defined for this population as CLcr 30–60 ml/min, reduced Zometa doses are recommended 
(see also section 4.4).

* Doses have been calculated assuming target AUC of 0.66 (mg•hr/l) (CLcr = 75 ml/min). The 
reduced doses for patients with renal impairment are expected to achieve the same AUC as that seen in 
patients with creatinine clearance of 75 ml/min. 
Following initiation of therapy, serum creatinine should be measured prior to each dose of Zometa and 
treatment should be withheld if renal function has deteriorated. In the clinical trials, renal deterioration 
was defined as follows: 
- 
For patients with normal baseline serum creatinine (< 1.4 mg/dl or < 124 µmol/l), an increase of 
0.5 mg/dl or 44 µmol/l; 
For patients with abnormal baseline creatinine (> 1.4 mg/dl or > 124 µmol/l), an increase of 
1.0 mg/dl or 88 µmol/l. 
- 
In the clinical studies, Zometa treatment was resumed only when the creatinine level returned to 
within 10% of the baseline value (see section 4.4). Zometa treatment should be resumed at the same 
dose as that given prior to treatment interruption. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid in children aged 1 year to 17 years have not been 
established. Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made. 
Method of administration 
Intravenous use. 
Zometa 4 mg/100 ml solution for infusion should be given as a single intravenous infusion in no less 
than 15 minutes. 
In patients with normal renal function, defined as CLcr > 60 ml/min, zoledronic acid 4 mg/100 ml 
solution for infusion must not be further diluted. 
In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, reduced Zometa doses are recommended (see 
section “Posology” above and section 4.4). 
To prepare reduced doses for patients with baseline CLcr ≤ 60 ml/min, refer to Table 1 below.

4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to other bisphosphonates or to any of the excipients 
listed in section 6.1. 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
General 
Patients must be assessed prior to administration of Zometa to ensure that they are adequately 
hydrated. 
Overhydration should be avoided in patients at risk of cardiac failure. 
Standard hypercalcaemia-related metabolic parameters, such as serum levels of calcium, phosphate 
and magnesium, should be carefully monitored after initiating Zometa therapy. If hypocalcaemia, 
hypophosphataemia, or hypomagnesaemia occurs, short-term supplemental therapy may be necessary. 
Untreated hypercalcaemia patients generally have some degree of renal function impairment, therefore 
careful renal function monitoring should be considered. 
Zometa contains the same active substance as found in Aclasta (zoledronic acid). Patients being 
treated with Zometa should not be treated with Aclasta or any other bisphosphonate concomitantly, 
since the combined effects of these agents are unknown. 
Renal insufficiency 
Patients with TIH and evidence of deterioration in renal function should be appropriately evaluated 
with consideration given as to whether the potential benefit of treatment with Zometa outweighs the 
possible risk. 
The decision to treat patients with bone metastases for the prevention of skeletal related events should 
consider that the onset of treatment effect is 2–3 months. 
Zometa has been associated with reports of renal dysfunction. Factors that may increase the potential 
for deterioration in renal function include dehydration, pre-existing renal impairment, multiple cycles 
of Zometa and other bisphosphonates as well as use of other nephrotoxic medicinal products. While 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the risk is reduced with a dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid administered over 15 minutes, deterioration in 
renal function may still occur. Renal deterioration, progression to renal failure and dialysis have been 
reported in patients after the initial dose or a single dose of 4 mg zoledronic acid. Increases in serum 
creatinine also occur in some patients with chronic administration of Zometa at recommended doses 
for prevention of skeletal related events, although less frequently. 
Patients should have their serum creatinine levels assessed prior to each dose of Zometa. Upon 
initiation of treatment in patients with bone metastases with mild to moderate renal impairment, lower 
doses of zoledronic acid are recommended. In patients who show evidence of renal deterioration 
during treatment, Zometa should be withheld. Zometa should only be resumed when serum creatinine 
returns to within 10% of baseline. Zometa treatment should be resumed at the same dose as that given 
prior to treatment interruption. 
In view of the potential impact of zoledronic acid on renal function, the lack of clinical safety data in 
patients with severe renal impairment (in clinical trials defined as serum creatinine ≥ 400 µmol/l or 
≥ 4.5 mg/dl for patients with TIH and ≥ 265 µmol/l or ≥ 3.0 mg/dl for patients with cancer and bone 
metastases, respectively) at baseline and only limited pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe 
renal impairment at baseline (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), the use of Zometa is not 
recommended in patients with severe renal impairment. 
Hepatic insufficiency 
As only limited clinical data are available in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency, no specific 
recommendations can be given for this patient population. 
Osteonecrosis 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported uncommonly in clinical trials in patients receiving 
Zometa. Post-marketing experience and the literature suggest a greater frequency of reports of ONJ 
based on tumour type (advanced breast cancer, multiple myeloma). A study showed that ONJ was 
higher in myeloma patients when compared to other cancers (see section 5.1). 
The start of treatment or of a new course of treatment should be delayed in patients with unhealed 
open soft tissue lesions in the mouth, except in medical emergency situations. A dental examination 
with appropriate preventive dentistry and an individual benefit-risk assessment is recommended prior 
to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with concomitant risk factors. 
The following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an individual’s risk of developing 
ONJ: 
- 
Potency of the bisphosphonate (higher risk for highly potent compounds), route of 
administration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative dose of 
bisphosphonate. 
Cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking. 
Concomitant therapies: chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors (see section 4.5), radiotherapy to 
neck and head, corticosteroids. 
History of dental disease, poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, invasive dental procedures 
(e.g. tooth extractions) and poorly fitting dentures. 
- 
- 
- 
All patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, undergo routine dental check-ups, 
and immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, or non-healing of 
sores or discharge during treatment with Zometa. While on treatment, invasive dental procedures 
should be performed only after careful consideration and be avoided in close proximity to zoledronic 
acid administration. For patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate 
therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. For patients requiring dental procedures, there 
are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk 
of osteonecrosis of the jaw. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The management plan for patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration between 
the treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary interruption of 
zoledronic acid treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing risk 
factors are mitigated where possible. 
Osteonecrosis of other anatomical sites 
Osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in 
association with long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of the external auditory 
canal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or trauma. The 
possibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving 
bisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including chronic ear infections. 
Additionally, there have been sporadic reports of osteonecrosis of other sites, including the hip and 
femur, reported predominantly in adult cancer patients treated with Zometa. 
Musculoskeletal pain 
In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain 
have been reported in patients taking Zometa. However, such reports have been infrequent. The time 
to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting treatment. Most patients had 
relief of symptoms after stopping treatment. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged 
with Zometa or another bisphosphonate. 
Atypical fractures of the femur 
Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate 
therapy, primarily in patients receiving long-term treatment for osteoporosis. These transverse or short 
oblique fractures can occur anywhere along the femur from just below the lesser trochanter to just 
above the supracondylar flare. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients 
experience thigh or groin pain, often associated with imaging features of stress fractures, weeks to 
months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the 
contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a 
femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. Discontinuation of 
bisphosphonate therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered 
pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. 
During bisphosphonate treatment patients should be advised to report any thigh, hip or groin pain and 
any patient presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femur fracture. 
Hypocalcaemia 
Hypocalcaemia has been reported in patients treated with Zometa. Cardiac arrhythmias and neurologic 
adverse events (including convulsions, hypoaesthesia and tetany) have been reported secondary to 
cases of severe hypocalcaemia. Cases of severe hypocalcaemia requiring hospitalisation have been 
reported. In some instances, the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening (see section 4.8). Caution is 
advised when Zometa is administered with medicinal products known to cause hypocalcaemia, as they 
may have a synergistic effect resulting in severe hypocalcaemia (see section 4.5). Serum calcium 
should be measured and hypocalcaemia must be corrected before initiating Zometa therapy. Patients 
should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D. 
Zometa contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium free”. However, if a solution of common salt (0.9% w/v sodium chloride solution) is used for 
the dilution of Zometa prior to administration then the dose of sodium received would be higher. 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
In clinical studies, Zometa has been administered concomitantly with commonly used anticancer 
agents, diuretics, antibiotics and analgesics without clinically apparent interactions occurring. 
Zoledronic acid shows no appreciable binding to plasma proteins and does not inhibit human P450 
enzymes in vitro (see section 5.2), but no formal clinical interaction studies have been performed. 
Caution is advised when bisphosphonates are administered with aminoglycosides, calcitonin or loop 
diuretics, since these agents may have an additive effect, resulting in a lower serum calcium level for 
longer periods than required (see section 4.4). 
Caution is indicated when Zometa is used with other potentially nephrotoxic medicinal products. 
Attention should also be paid to the possibility of hypomagnesaemia developing during treatment. 
In multiple myeloma patients, the risk of renal dysfunction may be increased when Zometa is used in 
combination with thalidomide. 
Caution is advised when Zometa is administered with anti-angiogenic medicinal products, as an 
increase in the incidence of ONJ has been observed in patients treated concomitantly with these 
medicinal products. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data on the use of zoledronic acid in pregnant women. Animal reproduction 
studies with zoledronic acid have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for 
humans is unknown. Zometa should not be used during pregnancy. Women of child-bearing potential 
should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether zoledronic acid is excreted into human milk. Zometa is contraindicated in 
breast-feeding women (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
Zoledronic acid was evaluated in rats for potential adverse effects on fertility of the parental and F1 
generation. This resulted in exaggerated pharmacological effects considered to be related to the 
compound’s inhibition of skeletal calcium metabolisation, resulting in periparturient hypocalcaemia, a 
bisphosphonate class effect, dystocia and early termination of the study. Thus these results precluded 
determining a definitive effect of zoledronic acid on fertility in humans. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Adverse reactions, such as dizziness and somnolence, may have influence on the ability to drive or use 
machines, therefore caution should be exercised with the use of Zometa along with driving and 
operating of machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Within three days after Zometa administration, an acute phase reaction has commonly been reported, 
with symptoms including bone pain, fever, fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia, rigors and arthritis with 
subsequent joint swelling; these symptoms usually resolve within a few days (see description of 
selected adverse reactions).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Renal function impairment 
Zometa has been associated with reports of renal dysfunction. In a pooled analysis of safety data from 
Zometa registration trials for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with advanced 
malignancies involving bone, the frequency of renal impairment adverse events suspected to be related 
to Zometa (adverse reactions) was as follows: multiple myeloma (3.2%), prostate cancer (3.1%), 
breast cancer (4.3%), lung and other solid tumours (3.2%). Factors that may increase the potential for 
deterioration in renal function include dehydration, pre-existing renal impairment, multiple cycles of 
Zometa or other bisphosphonates, as well as concomitant use of nephrotoxic medicinal products or 
using a shorter infusion time than currently recommended. Renal deterioration, progression to renal 
failure and dialysis have been reported in patients after the initial dose or a single dose of 4 mg 
zoledronic acid (see section 4.4). 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw 
Cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with 
medicinal products that inhibit bone resorption, such as Zometa (see section 4.4). Many of these 
patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids and had signs of local infection 
including osteomyelitis. The majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extractions 
or other dental surgeries. 
Atrial fibrillation 
In one 3-year, randomised, double-blind controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of 
zoledronic acid 5 mg once yearly vs. placebo in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), 
the overall incidence of atrial fibrillation was 2.5% (96 out of 3,862) and 1.9% (75 out of 3,852) in 
patients receiving zoledronic acid 5 mg and placebo, respectively. The rate of atrial fibrillation serious 
adverse events was 1.3% (51 out of 3,862) and 0.6% (22 out of 3,852) in patients receiving zoledronic 
acid 5 mg and placebo, respectively. The imbalance observed in this trial has not been observed in 
other trials with zoledronic acid, including those with Zometa (zoledronic acid) 4 mg every 3-4 weeks 
in oncology patients. The mechanism behind the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation in this single 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
clinical trial is unknown. 
Acute phase reaction 
This adverse drug reaction consists of a constellation of symptoms that includes fever, myalgia, 
headache, extremity pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea arthralgia and arthritis with subsequent joint 
swelling. The onset time is ≤ 3 days post-Zometa infusion, and the reaction is also referred to using the 
terms “flu-like” or “post-dose” symptoms. 
Atypical fractures of the femur 
During post-marketing experience the following reactions have been reported (frequency rare): 
Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures (bisphopsphonate class adverse reaction). 
Hypocalcaemia-related ADRs 
Hypocalcaemia is an important identified risk with Zometa in the approved indications. Based on the 
review of both clinical trial and post-marketing cases, there is sufficient evidence to support an 
association between Zometa therapy, the reported event of hypocalcaemia, and the secondary 
development of cardiac arrhythmia. Furthermore, there is evidence of an association between 
hypocalcaemia and secondary neurological events reported in these cases including; convulsions, 
hypoaesthesia and tetany (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Clinical experience with acute overdose of Zometa is limited. The administration of doses up to 48 mg 
of zoledronic acid in error has been reported. Patients who have received doses higher than those 
recommended (see section 4.2) should be carefully monitored, since renal function impairment 
(including renal failure) and serum electrolyte (including calcium, phosphorus and magnesium) 
abnormalities have been observed. In the event of hypocalcaemia, calcium gluconate infusions should 
be administered as clinically indicated.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for treatment of bone diseases, bisphosphonates, ATC code: 
M05BA08 
Zoledronic acid belongs to the class of bisphosphonates and acts primarily on bone. It is an inhibitor of 
osteoclastic bone resorption. 
The selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on their high affinity for mineralised bone, 
but the precise molecular mechanism leading to the inhibition of osteoclastic activity is still unclear. In 
long-term animal studies, zoledronic acid inhibits bone resorption without adversely affecting the 
formation, mineralisation or mechanical properties of bone. 
In addition to being a potent inhibitor of bone resorption, zoledronic acid also possesses several anti-
tumour properties that could contribute to its overall efficacy in the treatment of metastatic bone 
disease. The following properties have been demonstrated in preclinical studies: 
- 
In vivo: Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption, which alters the bone marrow 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
microenvironment, making it less conducive to tumour cell growth, anti-angiogenic activity and 
anti-pain activity. 
In vitro: Inhibition of osteoblast proliferation, direct cytostatic and pro-apoptotic activity on 
tumour cells, synergistic cytostatic effect with other anti-cancer drugs, anti-adhesion/invasion 
activity. 
Clinical trial results in the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced malignancies 
involving bone 
The first randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared zoledronic acid 4 mg to 
placebo for the prevention of skeletal related events (SREs) in prostate cancer patients. Zoledronic 
acid 4 mg significantly reduced the proportion of patients experiencing at least one skeletal related 
event (SRE), delayed the median time to first SRE by > 5 months, and reduced the annual incidence of 
events per patient - skeletal morbidity rate. Multiple event analysis showed a 36% risk reduction in 
developing SREs in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group compared with placebo. Patients receiving 
zoledronic acid 4 mg reported less increase in pain than those receiving placebo, and the difference 
reached significance at months 3, 9, 21 and 24. Fewer zoledronic acid 4 mg patients suffered 
pathological fractures. The treatment effects were less pronounced in patients with blastic lesions. 
Efficacy results are provided in Table 3. 
In a second study including solid tumours other than breast or prostate cancer, zoledronic acid 4 mg 
significantly reduced the proportion of patients with an SRE, delayed the median time to first SRE by 
> 2 months, and reduced the skeletal morbidity rate. Multiple event analysis showed 30.7% risk 
reduction in developing SREs in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group compared with placebo. Efficacy 
results are provided in Table 4.

In a third phase III randomised, double-blind trial, zoledronic acid 4 mg or 90 mg pamidronate every 3 
to 4 weeks were compared in patients with multiple myeloma or breast cancer with at least one bone 
lesion. The results demonstrated that zoledronic acid 4 mg showed comparable efficacy to 90 mg 
pamidronate in the prevention of SREs. The multiple event analysis revealed a significant risk 
reduction of 16% in patients treated with zoledronic acid 4 mg in comparison with patients receiving 
pamidronate. Efficacy results are provided in Table 5.

Zoledronic acid 4 mg was also studied in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in 
228 patients with documented bone metastases from breast cancer to evaluate the effect of 4 mg 
zoledronic acid on the skeletal related event (SRE) rate ratio, calculated as the total number of SRE 
events (excluding hypercalcaemia and adjusted for prior fracture), divided by the total risk period. 
Patients received either 4 mg zoledronic acid or placebo every four weeks for one year. Patients were 
evenly distributed between zoledronic acid-treated and placebo groups. 
The SRE rate (events/person year) was 0.628 for zoledronic acid and 1.096 for placebo. The 
proportion of patients with at least one SRE (excluding hypercalcaemia) was 29.8% in the zoledronic 
acid-treated group versus 49.6% in the placebo group (p=0.003). Median time to onset of the first SRE 
was not reached in the zoledronic acid-treated arm at the end of the study and was significantly 
prolonged compared to placebo (p=0.007). Zoledronic acid 4 mg reduced the risk of SREs by 41% in a 
multiple event analysis (risk ratio=0.59, p=0.019) compared with placebo. 
In the zoledronic acid-treated group, statistically significant improvement in pain scores (using the 
Brief Pain Inventory, BPI) was seen at 4 weeks and at every subsequent time point during the study, 
when compared to placebo (Figure 1). The pain score for zoledronic acid was consistently below 
baseline and pain reduction was accompanied by a trend in reduced analgesics score.

CZOL446EUS122/SWOG study 
The primary objective of this observational study was to estimate the cumulative incidence of 
osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) at 3 years in cancer patients with bone metastasis receiving zoledronic 
acid. The osteoclast inhibition therapy, other cancer therapy, and dental care was performed as 
clinically indicated in order to best represent academic and community-based care. A baseline dental 
examination was recommended but was not mandatory. 
Among the 3491 evaluable patients, 87 cases of ONJ diagnosis were confirmed. The overall estimated 
cumulative incidence of confirmed ONJ at 3 years was 2.8% (95% CI: 2.3-3.5%). The rates were 0.8% 
at year 1 and 2.0% at year 2. Rates of 3-year confirmed ONJ were highest in myeloma patients (4.3%) 
and lowest in breast cancer patients (2.4%). Cases of confirmed ONJ were statistically significantly 
higher in patients with multiple myeloma (p=0.03) than other cancers combined. 
Clinical trial results in the treatment of TIH 
Clinical studies in tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH) demonstrated that the effect of zoledronic 
acid is characterised by decreases in serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion. In Phase I dose 
finding studies in patients with mild to moderate tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH), effective 
doses tested were in the range of approximately 1.2–2.5 mg. 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To assess the effects of 4 mg zoledronic acid versus pamidronate 90 mg, the results of two pivotal 
multicentre studies in patients with TIH were combined in a pre-planned analysis. There was faster 
normalisation of corrected serum calcium at day 4 for 8 mg zoledronic acid and at day 7 for 4 mg and 
8 mg zoledronic acid. The following response rates were observed:

Median time to normocalcaemia was 4 days. Median time to relapse (re-increase of albumin-corrected 
serum calcium ≥ 2.9 mmol/l) was 30 to 40 days for patients treated with zoledronic acid versus 
17 days for those treated with pamidronate 90 mg (p-values: 0.001 for 4 mg and 0.007 for 8 mg 
zoledronic acid). There were no statistically significant differences between the two zoledronic acid 
doses. 
In clinical trials 69 patients who relapsed or were refractory to initial treatment (zoledronic acid 4 mg, 
8 mg or pamidronate 90 mg) were retreated with 8 mg zoledronic acid. The response rate in these 
patients was about 52%. Since those patients were retreated with the 8 mg dose only, there are no data 
available allowing comparison with the 4 mg zoledronic acid dose. 
In clinical trials performed in patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH), the overall safety 
profile amongst all three treatment groups (zoledronic acid 4 and 8 mg and pamidronate 90 mg) was 
similar in types and severity.

Clinical trial results in the treatment of severe osteogenesis imperfecta in paediatric patients aged 1 to 
17 years 
The effects of intravenous zoledronic acid in the treatment of paediatric patients (age 1 to 17 years) 
with severe osteogenesis imperfecta (types I, III and IV) were compared to intravenous pamidronate in 
one international, multicentre, randomised, open-label study with 74 and 76 patients in each treatment 
group, respectively. The study treatment period was 12 months preceded by a 4- to 9-week screening 
period during which vitamin D and elemental calcium supplements were taken for at least 2 weeks. In 
the clinical programme patients aged 1 to < 3 years received 0.025 mg/kg zoledronic acid (up to a 
maximum single dose of 0.35 mg) every 3 months and patients aged 3 to 17 years received 0.05 mg/kg 
zoledronic acid (up to a maximum single dose of 0.83 mg) every 3 months. An extension study was 
conducted in order to examine the long-term general and renal safety of once yearly or twice yearly 
zoledronic acid over the 12-month extension treatment period in children who had completed one year 
of treatment with either zoledronic acid or pamidronate in the core study. 
The primary endpoint of the study was the percent change from baseline in lumbar spine bone mineral 
density (BMD) after 12 months of treatment. Estimated treatment effects on BMD were similar, but 
the trial design was not sufficiently robust to establish non-inferior efficacy for zoledronic acid. In 
particular there was no clear evidence of efficacy on incidence of fracture or on pain. Fracture adverse 
events of long bones in the lower extremities were reported in approximately 24% (femur) and 14% 
(tibia) of zoledronic acid-treated patients vs 12% and 5% of pamidronate-treated patients with severe 
osteogenesis imperfecta, regardless of disease type and causality but overall incidence of fractures was 
comparable for the zoledronic acid and pamidronate-treated patients: 43% (32/74) vs 41% (31/76). 
Interpretation of the risk of fracture is confounded by the fact that fractures are common events in 
patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta as part of the disease process. 
The type of adverse reactions observed in this population were similar to those previously seen in 
adults with advanced malignancies involving the bone (see section 4.8). The adverse reactions ranked

used: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare 
(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available 
data).

1 Adverse events occurring with frequencies < 5% were medically assessed and it was shown that 
these cases are consistent with the well established safety profile of Zometa (see section 4.8) 
In paediatric patients with severe osteogenesis imperfecta, zoledronic acid seems to be associated with 
more pronounced risks for acute phase reaction, hypocalcaemia and unexplained tachycardia, in 
comparison to pamidronate, but this difference declined after subsequent infusions. 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
zoledronic acid in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of tumour-induced 
hypercalcaemia and prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with advanced malignancies 
involving bone (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Single and multiple 5- and 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledronic acid in 64 patients 
with bone metastases yielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which were found to be dose 
independent. 
After initiating the infusion of zoledronic acid, the plasma concentrations of zoledronic acid rapidly 
increased, achieving their peak at the end of the infusion period, followed by a rapid decline to < 10% 
of peak after 4 hours and < 1% of peak after 24 hours, with a subsequent prolonged period of very low 
concentrations not exceeding 0.1% of peak prior to the second infusion of zoledronic acid on day 28. 
Intravenously administered zoledronic acid is eliminated by a triphasic process: rapid biphasic 
disappearance from the systemic circulation, with half-lives of t½α 0.24 and t½β 1.87 hours, followed by 
a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t½γ 146 hours. There was no 
accumulation of zoledronic acid in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days. Zoledronic acid is 
not metabolised and is excreted unchanged via the kidney. Over the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the 
administered dose is recovered in the urine, while the remainder is principally bound to bone tissue. 
From the bone tissue it is released very slowly back into the systemic circulation and eliminated via 
the kidney. The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l/h, independent of dose, and unaffected by gender, 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
age, race, and body weight. Increasing the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a 30% decrease 
in zoledronic acid concentration at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the 
plasma concentration versus time curve. 
The interpatient variability in pharmacokinetic parameters for zoledronic acid was high, as seen with 
other bisphosphonates. 
No pharmacokinetic data for zoledronic acid are available in patients with hypercalcaemia or in 
patients with hepatic insufficiency. Zoledronic acid does not inhibit human P450 enzymes in vitro, 
shows no biotransformation and in animal studies < 3% of the administered dose was recovered in the 
faeces, suggesting no relevant role of liver function in the pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid. 
The renal clearance of zoledronic acid was correlated with creatinine clearance, renal clearance 
representing 75 ± 33% of the creatinine clearance, which showed a mean of 84 ± 29 ml/min (range 22 
to 143 ml/min) in the 64 cancer patients studied. Population analysis showed that for a patient with 
creatinine clearance of 20 ml/min (severe renal impairment), or 50 ml/min (moderate impairment), the 
corresponding predicted clearance of zoledronic acid would be 37% or 72%, respectively, of that of a 
patient showing creatinine clearance of 84 ml/min. Only limited pharmacokinetic data are available in 
patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). 
In an in vitro study, zoledronic acid showed low affinity for the cellular components of human blood, 
with a mean blood to plasma concentration ratio of 0.59 in a concentration range of 30 ng/ml to 
5000 ng/ml. The plasma protein binding is low, with the unbound fraction ranging from 60% at 
2 ng/ml to 77% at 2000 ng/ml of zoledronic acid. 
Special populations 
Paediatric patients 
Limited pharmacokinetic data in children with severe osteogenesis imperfecta suggest that zoledronic 
acid pharmacokinetics in children aged 3 to 17 years are similar to those in adults at a similar mg/kg 
dose level. Age, body weight, gender and creatinine clearance appear to have no effect on zoledronic 
acid systemic exposure. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Acute toxicity 
The highest non-lethal single intravenous dose was 10 mg/kg bodyweight in mice and 0.6 mg/kg in 
rats. 
Subchronic and chronic toxicity 
Zoledronic acid was well tolerated when administered subcutaneously to rats and intravenously to 
dogs at doses up to 0.02 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks. Administration of 0.001 mg/kg/day subcutaneously 
in rats and 0.005 mg/kg intravenously once every 2–3 days in dogs for up to 52 weeks was also well 
tolerated. 
The most frequent finding in repeat-dose studies consisted of increased primary spongiosa in the 
metaphyses of long bones in growing animals at nearly all doses, a finding that reflected the 
compound’s pharmacological antiresorptive activity. 
The safety margins relative to renal effects were narrow in the long-term repeat-dose parenteral animal 
studies but the cumulative no adverse event levels (NOAELs) in the single dose (1.6 mg/kg) and 
multiple dose studies of up to one month (0.06–0.6 mg/kg/day) did not indicate renal effects at doses 
equivalent to or exceeding the highest intended human therapeutic dose. Longer-term repeat 
administration at doses bracketing the highest intended human therapeutic dose of zoledronic acid 
produced toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen and 
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lungs, and at intravenous injection sites. 
Reproduction toxicity 
Zoledronic acid was teratogenic in the rat at subcutaneous doses ≥ 0.2 mg/kg. Although no 
teratogenicity or foetotoxicity was observed in the rabbit, maternal toxicity was found. Dystocia was 
observed at the lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg bodyweight) tested in the rat. 
Mutagenicity and carcinogenic potential 
Zoledronic acid was not mutagenic in the mutagenicity tests performed and carcinogenicity testing did 
not provide any evidence of carcinogenic potential.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Zometa is and what it is used for 
The active substance in Zometa is zoledronic acid, which belongs to a group of substances called 
bisphosphonates. Zoledronic acid works by attaching itself to the bone and slowing down the rate of 
bone change. It is used: 
• 
To prevent bone complications, e.g. fractures, in adult patients with bone metastases (spread 
of cancer from primary site to the bone). 
To reduce the amount of calcium in the blood in adult patients where it is too high due to the 
presence of a tumour. Tumours can accelerate normal bone change in such a way that the 
release of calcium from bone is increased. This condition is known as tumour-induced 
hypercalcaemia (TIH). 
• 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Zometa 
Follow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor. 
Your doctor will carry out blood tests before you start treatment with Zometa and will check your 
response to treatment at regular intervals. 
You should not be given Zometa: 
− 
− 
if you are breast-feeding. 
if you are allergic to zoledronic acid, another bisphosphonate (the group of substances to which 
Zometa belongs), or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Zometa: 
− 
− 
if you have or have had a kidney problem. 
if you have or have had pain, swelling or numbness of the jaw, a feeling of heaviness in the 
jaw or loosening of a tooth. Your doctor may recommend a dental examination before you start 
treatment with Zometa. 
if you are having dental treatment or are due to undergo dental surgery, tell your dentist that 
you are being treated with Zometa and inform your doctor about your dental treatment. 
− 
While being treated with Zometa, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including regular teeth 
84 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
brushing) and receive routine dental check-ups. 
Contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth 
such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of a 
condition called osteonecrosis of the jaw. 
Patients who are undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, who are taking steroids, who are 
undergoing dental surgery, who do not receive routine dental care, who have gum disease, who are 
smokers, or who were previously treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone 
disorders) may have a higher risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw. 
Reduced levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcaemia), sometimes leading to muscle cramps, dry 
skin, burning sensation, have been reported in patients treated with Zometa. Irregular heart beat 
(cardiac arrhythmia), seizures, spasm and twitching (tetany) have been reported as secondary to severe 
hypocalcaemia. In some instances the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening. If any of these apply to 
you, tell your doctor straight away. If you have pre-existing hypocalcaemia, it must be corrected 
before initiating the first dose of Zometa. You will be given adequate calcium and vitamin D 
supplements. 
Patients aged 65 years and over 
Zometa can be given to people aged 65 years and over. There is no evidence to suggest that any extra 
precautions are needed. 
Children and adolescents 
Zometa is not recommended for use in adolescents and children below the age of 18 years. 
Other medicines and Zometa 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. It is 
especially important that you tell your doctor if you are also taking: 
– 
Aminoglycosides (medicines used to treat severe infections), calcitonin (a type of medicine used 
to treat post-menopausal osteoporosis and hypercalcaemia), loop diuretics (a type of medicine to 
treat high blood pressure or oedema) or other calcium-lowering medicines, since the 
combination of these with bisphosphonates may cause the calcium level in the blood to become 
too low. 
Thalidomide (a medicine used to treat a certain type of blood cancer involving the bone) or any 
other medicines which may harm your kidneys. 
Aclasta (a medicine that also contains zoledronic acid and is used to treat osteoporosis and other 
non-cancer diseases of the bone), or any other bisphosphonate, since the combined effects of 
these medicines taken together with Zometa are unknown. 
Anti-angiogenic medicines (used to treat cancer), since the combination of these with Zometa 
has been associated with an increased risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). 
– 
– 
– 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You should not be given Zometa if you are pregnant. Tell your doctor if you are or think that you may 
be pregnant. 
You must not be given Zometa if you are breast-feeding. 
Ask your doctor for advice before taking any medicine while you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
There have been very rare cases of drowsiness and sleepiness with the use of Zometa. You should 
therefore be careful when driving, using machinery or performing other tasks that need full attention. 
Zometa contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium 
free”. If your doctor uses a solution of common salt to dilute Zometa, the dose of sodium received 
85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
would be larger. 
3. 
How Zometa is used 
− 
− 
– 
Zometa must only be given by healthcare professionals trained in administering 
bisphosphonates intravenously, i.e. through a vein. 
Your doctor will recommend that you drink enough water before each treatment to help prevent 
dehydration. 
Carefully follow all the other instructions given to you by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
How much Zometa is given 
– 
– 
The usual single dose given is 4 mg. 
If you have a kidney problem, your doctor will give you a lower dose depending on the severity 
of your kidney problem. 
How often Zometa is given 
– 
If you are being treated for the prevention of bone complications due to bone metastases, you 
will be given one infusion of Zometa every three to four weeks. 
If you are being treated to reduce the amount of calcium in your blood, you will normally only 
be given one infusion of Zometa. 
– 
How Zometa is given 
– 
Zometa is given as a drip (infusion) into a vein which should take at least 15 minutes and should 
be administered as a single intravenous solution in a separate infusion line. 
Patients whose blood calcium levels are not too high will also be prescribed calcium and vitamin D 
supplements to be taken each day. 
If you are given more Zometa than you should be 
If you have received doses higher than those recommended, you must be carefully monitored by your 
doctor. This is because you may develop serum electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. abnormal levels of 
calcium, phosphorus and magnesium) and/or changes in kidney function, including severe kidney 
impairment. If your level of calcium falls too low, you may have to be given supplemental calcium by 
infusion. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The most 
common ones are usually mild and will probably disappear after a short time. 
Tell your doctor about any of the following serious side effects straight away: 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
− 
Severe kidney impairment (will normally be determined by your doctor with certain specific 
blood tests). 
Low level of calcium in the blood. 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): 
− 
Pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or non-healing sores inside the mouth or jaw, 
discharge, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth. These could 
be signs of bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis). Tell your doctor and dentist immediately if 
you experience such symptoms while being treated with Zometa or after stopping treatment. 
Irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) has been seen in patients receiving zoledronic acid for 
postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is currently unclear whether zoledronic acid causes this 
irregular heart rhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms 
− 
− 
86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
after you have received zoledronic acid. 
Severe allergic reaction: shortness of breath, swelling mainly of the face and throat. 
− 
Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): 
− 
As a consequence of low calcium values: irregular heart beat (cardiac arrhythmia; secondary to 
hypocalcaemia). 
A kidney function disorder called Fanconi syndrome (will normally be determined by your 
doctor with certain urine tests). 
Very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): 
− 
As a consequence of low calcium values: seizures, numbness and tetany (secondary to 
hypocalcaemia). 
Talk to your doctor if you have ear pain, discharge from the ear, and/or an ear infection. These 
could be signs of bone damage in the ear. 
Osteonecrosis has also very rarely been seen occurring with other bones than the jaw, especially 
the hip or thigh. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as new onset or 
worsening of aches, pain or stiffness while being treated with Zometa or after stopping 
treatment. 
Tell your doctor about any of the following side effects as soon as possible: 
Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
− 
Low level of phosphate in the blood. 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
− 
Headache and a flu-like syndrome consisting of fever, fatigue, weakness, drowsiness, chills and 
bone, joint and/or muscle ache. In most cases no specific treatment is required and the 
symptoms disappear after a short time (couple of hours or days). 
Gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea and vomiting as well as loss of appetite. 
Conjunctivitis. 
Low level of red blood cells (anaemia). 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
Hypersensitivity reactions. 
Low blood pressure. 
Chest pain. 
Skin reactions (redness and swelling) at the infusion site, rash, itching. 
High blood pressure, shortness of breath, dizziness, anxiety, sleep disturbances, taste 
disturbances, trembling, tingling or numbness of the hands or feet, diarrhoea, constipation, 
abdominal pain, dry mouth. 
Low counts of white blood cells and blood platelets.

necessary measures. 
− 
− 
−  Weight increase. 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
Increased sweating. 
Sleepiness. 
Blurred vision, tearing of the eye, eye sensitivity to light. 
Sudden coldness with fainting, limpness or collapse. 
Difficulty in breathing with wheezing or coughing. 
Urticaria. 
Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): 
− 
− 
− 
Slow heart beat. 
Confusion. 
Unusual fracture of the thigh bone particularly in patients on long-term treatment for 
87 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
osteoporosis may occur rarely. Contact your doctor if you experience pain, weakness or 
discomfort in your thigh, hip or groin as this may be an early indication of a possible fracture of 
the thigh bone. 
Interstitial lung disease (inflammation of the tissue around the air sacks of the lungs). 
Flu-like symptoms including arthritis and joint swelling. 
Painful redness and/or swelling of the eye. 
− 
− 
− 
Very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): 
− 
Fainting due to low blood pressure.

INFORMATION FOR THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL 
How to prepare and administer Zometa 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
To prepare an infusion solution containing 4 mg zoledronic acid, add 5 ml of water for 
injections from the ampoule supplied in the pack to the vial containing the Zometa powder 
under aseptic conditions. Shake the vial gently to dissolve the powder. 
Further dilute the Zometa reconstituted solution (5 ml) with 100 ml of calcium-free or other 
divalent cation-free infusion solution. If a lower dose of Zometa is required, first withdraw the 
appropriate volume of the reconstituted solution (4 mg/5 ml) as indicated below and then dilute 
it further with 100 ml of infusion solution. To avoid potential incompatibilities, the infusion 
solution used for dilution must be either 0.9% w/v sodium chloride or 5% w/v glucose solution. 
Do not mix Zometa reconstituted solution with calcium-containing or other divalent 
cation-containing solutions such as lactated Ringer’s solution. 
Instructions for preparing reduced doses of Zometa: 
Withdraw the appropriate volume of the reconstituted solution (4 mg/5 ml), as follows: 
- 
- 
- 
4.4 ml for 3.5 mg dose 
4.1 ml for 3.3 mg dose 
3.8 ml for 3.0 mg dose 
For single use only. Any unused solution should be discarded. Only clear solution free from 
particles and discolouration should be used. Aseptic techniques must be followed during the 
preparation of the infusion. 
From a microbiological point of view, the reconstituted and diluted solution for infusion should 
be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use 
are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C – 8°C. 
The refrigerated solution should then be equilibrated to room temperature prior to 
administration. 
The solution containing zoledronic acid is given as a single 15-minute intravenous infusion in a 
separate infusion line. The hydration status of patients must be assessed prior to and following 
administration of Zometa to assure that they are adequately hydrated. 
Studies with several types of infusion lines made from polyvinylchloride, polyethylene and 
polypropylene showed no incompatibility with Zometa. 
Since no data are available on the compatibility of Zometa with other intravenously 
administered substances, Zometa must not be mixed with other medications/substances and 
should always be given through a separate infusion line. 
How to store Zometa 
− 
− 
− 
− 
Keep Zometa out of the reach and sight of children. 
Do not use Zometa after the expiry date stated on the pack. 
The unopened vial does not require any specific storage conditions. 
The diluted Zometa infusion solution should be used immediately in order to avoid microbial 
contamination.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Zometa is and what it is used for 
The active substance in Zometa is zoledronic acid, which belongs to a group of substances called 
bisphosphonates. Zoledronic acid works by attaching itself to the bone and slowing down the rate of 
bone change. It is used: 
• 
To prevent bone complications, e.g. fractures, in adult patients with bone metastases (spread 
of cancer from primary site to the bone). 
To reduce the amount of calcium in the blood in adult patients where it is too high due to the 
presence of a tumour. Tumours can accelerate normal bone change in such a way that the 
release of calcium from bone is increased. This condition is known as tumour-induced 
hypercalcaemia (TIH). 
• 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Zometa 
Follow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor. 
Your doctor will carry out blood tests before you start treatment with Zometa and will check your 
response to treatment at regular intervals. 
You should not be given Zometa: 
− 
− 
if you are breast-feeding. 
if you are allergic to zoledronic acid, another bisphosphonate (the group of substances to which 
Zometa belongs), or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Zometa: 
− 
− 
if you have or have had a kidney problem. 
if you have or have had pain, swelling or numbness of the jaw, a feeling of heaviness in the 
jaw or loosening of a tooth. Your doctor may recommend a dental examination before you start 
treatment with Zometa. 
if you are having dental treatment or are due to undergo dental surgery, tell your dentist that 
you are being treated with Zometa and inform your doctor about your dental treatment. 
While being treated with Zometa, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including regular teeth 
91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
brushing) and receive routine dental check-ups. 
Contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth 
such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of a 
condition called osteonecrosis of the jaw. 
Patients who are undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, who are taking steroids, who are 
undergoing dental surgery, who do not receive routine dental care, who have gum disease, who are 
smokers, or who were previously treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone 
disorders) may have a higher risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw. 
Reduced levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcaemia), sometimes leading to muscle cramps, dry 
skin, burning sensation, have been reported in patients treated with Zometa. Irregular heart beat 
(cardiac arrhythmia), seizures, spasm and twitching (tetany) have been reported as secondary to severe 
hypocalcaemia. In some instances the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening. If any of these apply to 
you, tell your doctor straight away. If you have pre-existing hypocalcaemia, it must be corrected 
before initiating the first dose of Zometa. You will be given adequate calcium and vitamin D 
supplements. 
Patients aged 65 years and over 
Zometa can be given to people aged 65 years and over. There is no evidence to suggest that any extra 
precautions are needed. 
Children and adolescents 
Zometa is not recommended for use in adolescents and children below the age of 18 years. 
Other medicines and Zometa 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. It is 
especially important that you tell your doctor if you are also taking: 
– 
Aminoglycosides (medicines used to treat severe infections), calcitonin (a type of medicine used 
to treat post-menopausal osteoporosis and hypercalcaemia), loop diuretics (a type of medicine to 
treat high blood pressure or oedema) or other calcium-lowering medicines, since the 
combination of these with bisphosphonates may cause the calcium level in the blood to become 
too low. 
Thalidomide (a medicine used to treat a certain type of blood cancer involving the bone) or any 
other medicines which may harm your kidneys. 
Aclasta (a medicine that also contains zoledronic acid and is used to treat osteoporosis and other 
non-cancer diseases of the bone), or any other bisphosphonate, since the combined effects of 
these medicines taken together with Zometa are unknown. 
Anti-angiogenic medicines (used to treat cancer), since the combination of these with Zometa 
has been associated with an increased risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). 
– 
– 
– 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You should not be given Zometa if you are pregnant. Tell your doctor if you are or think that you may 
be pregnant. 
You must not be given Zometa if you are breast-feeding. 
Ask your doctor for advice before taking any medicine while you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
There have been very rare cases of drowsiness and sleepiness with the use of Zometa. You should 
therefore be careful when driving, using machinery or performing other tasks that need full attention. 
Zometa contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium 
free”. If your doctor uses a solution of common salt to dilute Zometa, the dose of sodium received 
92 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
would be larger. 
3. 
How Zometa is used 
− 
− 
– 
Zometa must only be given by healthcare professionals trained in administering 
bisphosphonates intravenously, i.e. through a vein. 
Your doctor will recommend that you drink enough water before each treatment to help prevent 
dehydration. 
Carefully follow all the other instructions given to you by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
How much Zometa is given 
– 
– 
The usual single dose given is 4 mg. 
If you have a kidney problem, your doctor will give you a lower dose depending on the severity 
of your kidney problem. 
How often Zometa is given 
– 
If you are being treated for the prevention of bone complications due to bone metastases, you 
will be given one infusion of Zometa every three to four weeks. 
If you are being treated to reduce the amount of calcium in your blood, you will normally only 
be given one infusion of Zometa. 
– 
How Zometa is given 
– 
Zometa is given as a drip (infusion) into a vein which should take at least 15 minutes and should 
be administered as a single intravenous solution in a separate infusion line. 
Patients whose blood calcium levels are not too high will also be prescribed calcium and vitamin D 
supplements to be taken each day. 
If you are given more Zometa than you should be 
If you have received doses higher than those recommended, you must be carefully monitored by your 
doctor. This is because you may develop serum electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. abnormal levels of 
calcium, phosphorus and magnesium) and/or changes in kidney function, including severe kidney 
impairment. If your level of calcium falls too low, you may have to be given supplemental calcium by 
infusion. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The most 
common ones are usually mild and will probably disappear after a short time. 
Tell your doctor about any of the following serious side effects straight away: 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
− 
Severe kidney impairment (will normally be determined by your doctor with certain specific 
blood tests). 
Low level of calcium in the blood. 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): 
− 
Pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or non-healing sores inside the mouth or jaw, 
discharge, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth. These could 
be signs of bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis). Tell your doctor and dentist immediately if 
you experience such symptoms while being treated with Zometa or after stopping treatment. 
Irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) has been seen in patients receiving zoledronic acid for 
postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is currently unclear whether zoledronic acid causes this 
irregular heart rhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms

− 
93 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
after you have received zoledronic acid. 
Severe allergic reaction: shortness of breath, swelling mainly of the face and throat. 
− 
Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): 
− 
As a consequence of low calcium values: irregular heart beat (cardiac arrhythmia; secondary to 
hypocalcaemia).

doctor with certain urine tests). 
Very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): 
− 
As a consequence of low calcium values: seizures, numbness and tetany (secondary to 
hypocalcaemia). 
Talk to your doctor if you have ear pain, discharge from the ear, and/or an ear infection. These 
could be signs of bone damage in the ear. 
Osteonecrosis has also very rarely been seen occurring with other bones than the jaw, especially 
the hip or thigh. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as new onset or 
worsening of aches, pain or stiffness while being treated with Zometa or after stopping 
treatment. 
Tell your doctor about any of the following side effects as soon as possible: 
Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
− 
Low level of phosphate in the blood. 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
− 
Headache and a flu-like syndrome consisting of fever, fatigue, weakness, drowsiness, chills and 
bone, joint and/or muscle ache. In most cases no specific treatment is required and the 
symptoms disappear after a short time (couple of hours or days). 
Gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea and vomiting as well as loss of appetite. 
Conjunctivitis. 
Low level of red blood cells (anaemia). 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): 
− 
− 
− 
− 
−

INFORMATION FOR THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL 
How to prepare and administer Zometa 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
To prepare an infusion solution containing 4 mg zoledronic acid, further dilute the Zometa 
concentrate (5.0 ml) with 100 ml of calcium-free or other divalent cation-free infusion solution. 
If a lower dose of Zometa is required, first withdraw the appropriate volume as indicated below 
and then dilute it further with 100 ml of infusion solution. To avoid potential incompatibilities, 
the infusion solution used for dilution must be either 0.9% w/v sodium chloride or 5% w/v 
glucose solution. 
Do not mix Zometa concentrate with calcium-containing or other divalent cation-
containing solutions such as lactated Ringer’s solution. 
Instructions for preparing reduced doses of Zometa: 
Withdraw the appropriate volume of the liquid concentrate, as follows: 
- 
- 
- 
4.4 ml for 3.5 mg dose 
4.1 ml for 3.3 mg dose 
3.8 ml for 3.0 mg dose 
For single use only. Any unused solution should be discarded. Only clear solution free from 
particles and discolouration should be used. Aseptic techniques must be followed during the 
preparation of the infusion. 
From a microbiological point of view, the diluted solution for infusion should be used 
immediately. If not used immediately,in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the 
responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C – 8°C. The 
refrigerated solution should then be equilibrated to room temperature prior to administration. 
The solution containing zoledronic acid is given as a single 15-minute intravenous infusion in a 
separate infusion line. The hydration status of patients must be assessed prior to and following 
administration of Zometa to ensure that they are adequately hydrated. 
Studies with several types of infusion lines made from polyvinylchloride, polyethylene and 
polypropylene showed no incompatibility with Zometa. 
Since no data are available on the compatibility of Zometa with other intravenously 
administered substances, Zometa must not be mixed with other medications/substances and 
should always be given through a separate infusion line.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Zometa is and what it is used for 
The active substance in Zometa is zoledronic acid, which belongs to a group of substances called 
bisphosphonates. Zoledronic acid works by attaching itself to the bone and slowing down the rate of 
bone change. It is used: 
• 
To prevent bone complications, e.g. fractures, in adult patients with bone metastases (spread 
of cancer from primary site to the bone). 
To reduce the amount of calcium in the blood in adult patients where it is too high due to the 
presence of a tumour. Tumours can accelerate normal bone change in such a way that the 
release of calcium from bone is increased. This condition is known as tumour-induced 
hypercalcaemia (TIH). 
• 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Zometa 
Follow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor. 
Your doctor will carry out blood tests before you start treatment with Zometa and will check your 
response to treatment at regular intervals. 
You should not be given Zometa: 
− 
− 
if you are breast-feeding. 
if you are allergic to zoledronic acid, another bisphosphonate (the group of substances to which 
Zometa belongs), or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Zometa: 
− 
− 
if you have or have had a kidney problem. 
if you have or have had pain, swelling or numbness of the jaw, a feeling of heaviness in the 
jaw or loosening of a tooth. Your doctor may recommend a dental examination before you start 
treatment with Zometa. 
if you are having dental treatment or are due to undergo dental surgery, tell your dentist that 
you are being treated with Zometa and inform your doctor about your dental treatment. 
− 
While being treated with Zometa, you should maintain good oral hygiene (including regular teeth 
98 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
brushing) and receive routine dental check-ups. 
Contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth 
such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of a 
condition called osteonecrosis of the jaw. 
Patients who are undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, who are taking steroids, who are 
undergoing dental surgery, who do not receive routine dental care, who have gum disease, who are 
smokers, or who were previously treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone 
disorders) may have a higher risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw. 
Reduced levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcaemia), sometimes leading to muscle cramps, dry 
skin, burning sensation, have been reported in patients treated with Zometa. Irregular heart beat 
(cardiac arrhythmia), seizures, spasm and twitching (tetany) have been reported as secondary to severe 
hypocalcaemia. In some instances the hypocalcaemia may be life-threatening. If any of these apply to 
you, tell your doctor straight away. If you have pre-existing hypocalcaemia, it must be corrected 
before initiating the first dose of Zometa. You will be given adequate calcium and vitamin D 
supplements. 
Patients aged 65 years and over 
Zometa can be given to people aged 65 years and over. There is no evidence to suggest that any extra 
precautions are needed. 
Children and adolescents 
Zometa is not recommended for use in adolescents and children below the age of 18 years. 
Other medicines and Zometa 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. It is 
especially important that you tell your doctor if you are also taking: 
– 
Aminoglycosides (medicines used to treat severe infections), calcitonin (a type of medicine used 
to treat post-menopausal osteoporosis and hypercalcaemia), loop diuretics (a type of medicine to 
treat high blood pressure or oedema) or other calcium-lowering medicines, since the 
combination of these with bisphosphonates may cause the calcium level in the blood to become 
too low. 
Thalidomide (a medicine used to treat a certain type of blood cancer involving the bone) or any 
other medicines which may harm your kidneys. 
Aclasta (a medicine that also contains zoledronic acid and is used to treat osteoporosis and other 
non-cancer diseases of the bone), or any other bisphosphonate, since the combined effects of 
these medicines taken together with Zometa are unknown. 
Anti-angiogenic medicines (used to treat cancer), since the combination of these with Zometa 
has been associated with an increased risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). 
– 
– 
– 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You should not be given Zometa if you are pregnant. Tell your doctor if you are or think that you may 
be pregnant. 
You must not be given Zometa if you are breast-feeding. 
Ask your doctor for advice before taking any medicine while you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
There have been very rare cases of drowsiness and sleepiness with the use of Zometa. You should 
therefore be careful when driving, using machinery or performing other tasks that need full attention. 
Zometa contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium 
free”. If your doctor uses a solution of common salt to dilute Zometa, the dose of sodium received 
99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
would be larger. 
3. 
How Zometa is used 
− 
− 
– 
Zometa must only be given by healthcare professionals trained in administering 
bisphosphonates intravenously, i.e. through a vein. 
Your doctor will recommend that you drink enough water before each treatment to help prevent 
dehydration. 
Carefully follow all the other instructions given to you by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
How much Zometa is given 
– 
– 
The usual single dose given is 4 mg. 
If you have a kidney problem, your doctor will give you a lower dose depending on the severity 
of your kidney problem. 
How often Zometa is given 
– 
If you are being treated for the prevention of bone complications due to bone metastases, you 
will be given one infusion of Zometa every three to four weeks. 
If you are being treated to reduce the amount of calcium in your blood, you will normally only 
be given one infusion of Zometa. 
– 
How Zometa is given 
– 
Zometa is given as a drip (infusion) into a vein which should take at least 15 minutes and should 
be administered as a single intravenous solution in a separate infusion line. 
Patients whose blood calcium levels are not too high will also be prescribed calcium and vitamin D 
supplements to be taken each day. 
If you are given more Zometa than you should be 
If you have received doses higher than those recommended, you must be carefully monitored by your 
doctor. This is because you may develop serum electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. abnormal levels of 
calcium, phosphorus and magnesium) and/or changes in kidney function, including severe kidney 
impairment. If your level of calcium falls too low, you may have to be given supplemental calcium by 
infusion.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The most 
common ones are usually mild and will probably disappear after a short time. 
Tell your doctor about any of the following serious side effects straight away: 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
− 
Severe kidney impairment (will normally be determined by your doctor with certain specific 
blood tests). 
Low level of calcium in the blood. 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): 
− 
Pain in the mouth, teeth and/or jaw, swelling or non-healing sores inside the mouth or jaw, 
discharge, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, or loosening of a tooth. These could 
be signs of bone damage in the jaw (osteonecrosis). Tell your doctor and dentist immediately if 
you experience such symptoms while being treated with Zometa or after stopping treatment. 
Irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) has been seen in patients receiving zoledronic acid for 
postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is currently unclear whether zoledronic acid causes this 
irregular heart rhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms

Rare (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people): 
− 
As a consequence of low calcium values: irregular heart beat (cardiac arrhythmia; secondary to 
hypocalcaemia).

doctor with certain urine tests). 
Very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people): 
− 
As a consequence of low calcium values: seizures, numbness and tetany (secondary to 
hypocalcaemia). 
Talk to your doctor if you have ear pain, discharge from the ear, and/or an ear infection. These 
could be signs of bone damage in the ear. 
Osteonecrosis has also very rarely been seen occurring with other bones than the jaw, especially 
the hip or thigh. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as new onset or 
worsening of aches, pain or stiffness while being treated with Zometa or after stopping 
treatment. 
Tell your doctor about any of the following side effects as soon as possible: 
Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people):

Low level of phosphate in the blood. 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
− 
Headache and a flu-like syndrome consisting of fever, fatigue, weakness, drowsiness, chills and 
bone, joint and/or muscle ache. In most cases no specific treatment is required and the 
symptoms disappear after a short time (couple of hours or days). 
Gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea and vomiting as well as loss of appetite. 
Conjunctivitis. 
Low level of red blood cells (anaemia). 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
Hypersensitivity reactions.

− 
Unusual fracture of the thigh bone particularly in patients on long-term treatment for 
osteoporosis may occur rarely. Contact your doctor if you experience pain, weakness or 
discomfort in your thigh, hip or groin as this may be an early indication of a possible fracture of 
the thigh bone. 
Interstitial lung disease (inflammation of the tissue around the air sacks of the lungs) 
Flu-like symptoms including arthritis and joint swelling. 
Painful redness and/or swelling of the eye.

INFORMATION FOR THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL 
How to prepare and administer Zometa 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
Zometa 4 mg/100 ml solution for infusion contains 4 mg zoledronic acid in 100 ml of infusion 
solution for immediate use in patients with normal renal function. 
For single use only. Any unused solution should be discarded. Only clear solution free from 
particles and discolouration should be used. Aseptic techniques must be followed during the 
preparation of the infusion. 
From a microbiological point of view, the solution for infusion should be used immediately, 
after first opening. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are 
the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer then 24 hours at 2°C – 8°C, 
unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. The refrigerated 
solution should then be equilibrated to room temperature prior to administration. 
The solution containing zoledronic acid must not be further diluted or mixed with other infusion 
solutions. It is given as a single 15-minute intravenous infusion in a separate infusion line. The 
hydration status of patients must be assessed prior to and following administration of Zometa to 
assure that they are adequately hydrated. 
Zometa 4 mg/100 ml solution for infusion can be used immediately without further preparation 
for patients with normal renal function. In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, 
reduced doses should be prepared as instructed below. 
To prepare reduced doses for patients with baseline CLcr ≤ 60 ml/min, refer to Table 1 below. 
Remove the volume of Zometa solution indicated from the bottle and replace with an equal volume of 
sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0,9%) solution for injection, or 5% glucose solution for injection.

*Doses have been calculated assuming target AUC of 0.66 (mg•hr/l) (CLcr = 75 ml/min). The reduced 
doses for patients with renal impairment are expected to achieve the same AUC as that seen in patients 
with creatinine clearance of 75 ml/min. 
− 
− 
Studies with several types of infusion lines made from polyvinylchloride, polyethylene and 
polypropylene showed no incompatibility with Zometa. 
Since no data are available on the compatibility of Zometa with other intravenously 
administered substances, Zometa must not be mixed with other medications/substances and 
should always be given through a separate infusion line.

− 
− 
Keep Zometa out of the reach and sight of children. 
Do not use Zometa after the expiry date stated on the pack. 
The unopened bottle does not require any special storage conditions. 
After opening the bottle, the product should be used immediately in order to avoid microbial 
contamination.

1.   NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT  
Rotarix powder and solvent for oral suspension 
Rotavirus vaccine, live 
2.   QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  
After reconstitution, 1 dose (1 mL) contains: 
Human rotavirus RIX4414 strain (live, attenuated)* 
not less than 106.0 CCID50 
*Produced on Vero cells 
Excipients with known effect: 
This product contains 13.5 mg of sorbitol, 9 mg of sucrose, 10 micrograms of glucose and 
0.15 microgram of phenylalanine per dose (see section 4.4). 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3.  
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  
Powder and solvent for oral suspension. 
The powder is white. 
The solvent is a turbid liquid with a slow settling white deposit and a colourless supernatant. 
4.   CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1   Therapeutic indications  
Rotarix is indicated for the active immunisation of infants aged 6 to 24 weeks for prevention of gastro-
enteritis due to rotavirus infection (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
The use of Rotarix should be based on official recommendations. 
4.2   Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
The vaccination course consists of two doses. The first dose may be administered from the age of 6 
weeks. There should be an interval of at least 4 weeks between doses. The vaccination course should 
preferably be given before 16 weeks of age, but must be completed by the age of 24 weeks. 
Rotarix may be given with the same posology to preterm infants born after at least 27 weeks of 
gestational age (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
In clinical trials, spitting or regurgitation of the vaccine has rarely been observed and, under such 
circumstances, a replacement dose was not given. However, in the unlikely event that an infant spits 
out or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single replacement dose may be given at the same 
vaccination visit. 
It is recommended that infants who receive a first dose of Rotarix complete the 2-dose regimen with 
Rotarix. There are no data on safety, immunogenicity or efficacy when Rotarix is administered for the 
first dose and another rotavirus vaccine is administered for the second dose or vice versa. 
Paediatric population 
Rotarix should not be used in children over 24 weeks of age.

Method of administration 
Rotarix is for oral use only. 
Rotarix should under no circumstances be injected. 
For instructions for the preparation or reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, 
see section 6.6. 
4.3   Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hypersensitivity after previous administration of rotavirus vaccines. 
History of intussusception. 
Subjects with uncorrected congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract that would predispose 
for intussusception. 
Subjects with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) disorder (see section 4.8). 
Administration of Rotarix should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute severe febrile 
illness. The presence of a minor infection is not a contra-indication for immunisation. 
The administration of Rotarix should be postponed in subjects suffering from diarrhoea or vomiting. 
4.4   Special warnings and precautions for use  
It is good clinical practice that vaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history 
especially with regard to the contraindications and by a clinical examination. 
There are no data on the safety and efficacy of Rotarix in infants with gastrointestinal illnesses or 
growth retardation. Administration of Rotarix may be considered with caution in such infants when, in 
the opinion of the physician, withholding the vaccine entails a greater risk. 
As a precaution, healthcare professionals should follow-up on any symptoms indicative of 
intussusception (severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bloody stools, abdominal bloating and/or 
high fever) since data from observational safety studies indicate an increased risk of intussusception, 
mostly within 7 days after rotavirus vaccination (see section 4.8). Parents/guardians should be advised 
to promptly report such symptoms to their healthcare provider. 
For subjects with a predisposition for intussusception, see section 4.3. 
Asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic HIV infections are not expected to affect the safety or efficacy 
of Rotarix. A clinical study in a limited number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic HIV positive 
infants showed no apparent safety problems (see section 4.8). 
Administration of Rotarix to infants who have known or suspected immunodeficiency, including in 
utero exposure to an immunosuppressive treatment, should be based on careful consideration of 
potential benefits and risks. 
Excretion of the vaccine virus in the stools is known to occur after vaccination with peak excretion 
around the 7th day. Viral antigen particles detected by ELISA were found in 50% of stools after the 
first dose and 4% of stools after the second dose. When these stools were tested for the presence of 
live vaccine strain, only 17% were positive.

Cases of transmission of this excreted vaccine virus to seronegative contacts of vaccinees have been 
observed without causing any clinical symptom. 
Rotarix should be administered with caution to individuals with immunodeficient close contacts, 
such as individuals with malignancies, or who are otherwise immunocompromised or individuals 
receiving immunosuppressive therapy. 
Contacts of recent vaccinees should observe personal hygiene (e.g. wash their hands after changing 
child’s nappies). 
The potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72h should be considered 
when administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born ≤ 28 weeks of 
gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. 
As the benefit of the vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or 
delayed. 
A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). 
The extent of protection that Rotarix might provide against other rotavirus strains that have not been 
circulating in clinical trials is currently unknown. Clinical studies from which efficacy data were 
derived were conducted in Europe, Central and South America, Africa and Asia (see section 5.1). 
Rotarix does not protect against gastro-enteritis due to other pathogens than rotavirus. 
No data are available on the use of Rotarix for post-exposure prophylaxis. 
Rotarix should under no circumstances be injected. 
Excipients 
This vaccine contains sucrose, glucose and sorbitol as excipients. Patients with rare hereditary 
problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency 
should not take this vaccine. 
This vaccine contains 0.15 microgram phenylalanine in each dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful for 
patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) in each dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
4.5  
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Rotarix can be given concomitantly with any of the following monovalent or combination vaccines 
[including hexavalent vaccines (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib)]: diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis 
vaccine (DTPw), diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTPa), Haemophilus influenzae 
type b vaccine (Hib), inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), hepatitis B vaccine (HBV), pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine and meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine. Clinical studies demonstrated 
that the immune responses and the safety profiles of the administered vaccines were unaffected. 
Concomitant administration of Rotarix and oral polio vaccine (OPV) does not affect the immune 
response to the polio antigens. Although concomitant administration of OPV may slightly reduce the 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
immune response to rotavirus vaccine, clinical protection against severe rotavirus gastro-enteritis was 
shown to be maintained in a clinical trial involving more than 4 200 subjects who received Rotarix 
concomitantly with OPV. 
There are no restrictions on the infant’s consumption of food or liquid, either before or after 
vaccination. 
4.6   Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Rotarix is not intended for use in adults. There are no data on the use of Rotarix during pregnancy and 
lactation.  
Based on evidence generated in clinical trials, breast-feeding does not reduce the protection against 
rotavirus gastro-enteritis afforded by Rotarix. Therefore, breast-feeding may be continued during the 
vaccination schedule. 
4.7   Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Not relevant. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety profile presented below is based on data from clinical trials conducted with either the 
lyophilised or the liquid formulation of Rotarix. 
In a total of four clinical trials, approximately 3 800 doses of Rotarix liquid formulation were 
administered to approximately 1 900 infants. Those trials have shown that the safety profile of the 
liquid formulation is comparable to the lyophilised formulation. 
In a total of twenty-three clinical trials, approximately 106 000 doses of Rotarix (lyophilised or liquid 
formulation) were administered to approximately 51 000 infants.  
In three placebo-controlled clinical trials (Finland, India and Bangladesh), in which Rotarix was 
administered alone (administration of routine paediatric vaccines was staggered), the incidence and 
severity of the solicited events (collected 8 days post-vaccination), diarrhoea, vomiting, loss of 
appetite, fever, irritability and cough/runny nose were not significantly different in the group receiving 
Rotarix when compared to the group receiving placebo. No increase in the incidence or severity of 
these events was seen with the second dose. 
In a pooled analysis from seventeen placebo-controlled clinical trials (Europe, North America, Latin 
America, Asia, Africa) including trials in which Rotarix was co-administered with routine paediatric 
vaccines (see section 4.5), the following adverse reactions (collected 31 days post-vaccination) were 
considered as possibly related to vaccination.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Intussusception 
Data from observational safety studies performed in several countries indicate that rotavirus vaccines 
carry an increased risk of intussusception, mostly within 7 days of vaccination. Up to 6 additional 
cases per 100 000 infants have been observed in these countries against a background incidence of 25 
to 101 per 100 000 infants (less than one year of age) per year, respectively.  
There is limited evidence of a smaller increased risk following the second dose.  
It remains unclear whether rotavirus vaccines affect the overall incidence of intussusception based on 
longer periods of follow-up (see section 4.4). 
Other special populations  
Safety in preterm infants 
In a clinical study, 670 pre-term infants from 27 to 36 weeks of gestational age were administered 
Rotarix and 339 received placebo. The first dose was administered from 6 weeks after birth. Serious 
adverse events were observed in 5.1% of recipients of Rotarix as compared with 6.8% of placebo 
recipients. Similar rates of other adverse events were observed in Rotarix and placebo recipients. No 
cases of intussusception were reported. 
Safety in infants with human immunodeficiency (HIV) infection 
In a clinical study, 100 infants with HIV infection were administered Rotarix or placebo. The safety 
profile was similar between Rotarix and placebo recipients. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmaco-therapeutic group: rotavirus diarrhoea vaccines, ATC code: J07BH01 
Protective efficacy 
In clinical trials, efficacy was demonstrated against gastro-enteritis due to rotavirus of the most 
common genotypes G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8] and G9P[8]. In addition, efficacy against 
uncommon rotavirus genotypes G8P[4](severe gastro-enteritis) and G12P[6] (any gastro-enteritis) has 
been demonstrated. These strains are circulating worldwide. 
Clinical studies have been conducted in Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia to evaluate the 
protective efficacy of Rotarix against any and severe rotavirus gastro-enteritis (RVGE). 
Severity of gastro-enteritis was defined according to two different criteria: 
- the Vesikari 20-point scale, which evaluates the full clinical picture of rotavirus gastro-enteritis by 
taking into account the severity and duration of diarrhoea and vomiting, the severity of fever and 
dehydration as well as the need for treatment 
or 
- the clinical case definition based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria 
Clinical protection was assessed in the ATP cohort for efficacy, which includes all subjects from the 
ATP cohort for safety who entered into the concerned efficacy follow-up period. 
Protective efficacy in Europe 
A clinical study performed in Europe evaluated Rotarix given according to different European 
schedules (2, 3 months; 2, 4 months; 3, 4 months; 3, 5 months) in 4 000 subjects.  
After two doses of Rotarix, the protective vaccine efficacy observed during the first and second year 
of life is presented in the following table:

Sustained efficacy up to 3 years of age in Asia 
A clinical study conducted in Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan) (Total vaccinated cohort : 
Rotarix: N = 5 359; placebo: N = 5 349) evaluated Rotarix given according to different schedules (2, 4 
months of age; 3, 4 months of age). 
During the first year, significantly fewer subjects in the Rotarix group reported severe rotavirus gastro-
enteritis caused by the circulating wild-type RV compared to the placebo group from 2 weeks after 
Dose 2 up to one year of age (0.0% versus 0.3%), with a vaccine efficacy of 100% (95% CI: 72.2;

† Severe gastro-enteritis was defined as a score ≥ 11 on the Vesikari scale 
* Not statistically significant (p ≥ 0.05). These data should be interpreted with caution 
During the third year of life, there were no cases of severe RV gastro-enteritis in the Rotarix group 
(N=4 222) versus 13 (0.3%) in the placebo group (N=4 185). Vaccine efficacy was 100% (95% CI: 
67.5; 100). The severe RV gastro-enteritis cases were due to RV strains G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8] and 
G9P[8]. The incidence of severe RV gastro-enteritis associated with the individual genotypes was too 
small to allow calculation of efficacy. The efficacy against severe RV gastro-enteritis requiring 
hospitalisation was 100% (95% CI: 72.4; 100). 
Immune response 
The immunologic mechanism by which Rotarix protects against rotavirus gastro-enteritis is not 
completely understood. A relationship between antibody responses to rotavirus vaccination and 
protection against rotavirus gastro-enteritis has not been established. 
The following table shows the percentage of subjects initially seronegative for rotavirus (IgA antibody 
titres < 20 U/mL) (by ELISA) with serum anti-rotavirus IgA antibody titres ≥ 20 U/mL one to two 
months after the second dose of vaccine or placebo as observed in different studies.

In a clinical study conducted in preterm infants, born after at least 27 weeks of gestational age, the 
immunogenicity of Rotarix was assessed in a subset of 147 subjects and showed that Rotarix is 
immunogenic in this population; 85.7% (95% CI: 79.0;90.9) of subjects achieved serum anti-rotavirus 
IgA antibody titres ≥ 20 U/mL (by ELISA) one month after the second dose of vaccine.

In observational studies, vaccine effectiveness was demonstrated against severe gastro-enteritis 
leading to hospitalisation due to rotavirus of common genotypes G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8] and 
G9P[8] as well as the less common rotavirus genotypes G9P[4] and G9P[6]. All of these strains are 
circulating worldwide.

Impact on mortality§ 
Impact studies with Rotarix conducted in Panama, Brazil and Mexico showed a decrease in all-cause 
diarrhoea mortality ranging from 17% to 73% in children less than 5 years of age, within 2 to 4 years 
after vaccine introduction. 
Impact on hospitalisation§ 
In a retrospective database study in Belgium conducted in children 5 years of age and younger, the 
direct and indirect impact of Rotarix vaccination on rotavirus-related hospitalisation ranged from 64% 
(95% CI: 49;76) to 80% (95% CI: 77;83) two years after vaccine introduction. Similar studies in 
Armenia, Australia, Brazil, Canada, El Salvador and Zambia showed a reduction of 45 to 93% 
between 2 and 4 years after vaccine introduction.  
In addition, nine impact studies on all-cause diarrhoea hospitalisation conducted in Africa and Latin 
America showed a reduction of 14% to 57% between 2 and 5 years after vaccine introduction. 
§NOTE : Impact studies are meant to establish a temporal relationship but not a causal relationship 
between the disease and vaccination. Natural fluctuations of the incidence of the disease may also 
influence the observed temporal effect.

2.   QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION  
1 dose (1.5 mL) contains: 
Human rotavirus RIX4414 strain (live, attenuated)* 
not less than 106.0 CCID50 
*Produced on Vero cells 
Excipients with known effect: 
This product contains 1 073 mg of sucrose, 32 mg of sodium, 10 micrograms of glucose and 
0.15 microgram of phenylalanine per dose (see section 4.4). 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3.  
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM  
Oral suspension. 
Rotarix is a clear and colourless liquid. 
4.   CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1   Therapeutic indications  
Rotarix is indicated for the active immunisation of infants aged 6 to 24 weeks for prevention of gastro-
enteritis due to rotavirus infection (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
The use of Rotarix should be based on official recommendations. 
4.2   Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
The vaccination course consists of two doses. The first dose may be administered from the age of 6 
weeks. There should be an interval of at least 4 weeks between doses. The vaccination course should 
preferably be given before 16 weeks of age, but must be completed by the age of 24 weeks. 
Rotarix may be given with the same posology to preterm infants born after at least 27 weeks of 
gestational age (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
In clinical trials, spitting or regurgitation of the vaccine has rarely been observed and, under such 
circumstances, a replacement dose was not given. However, in the unlikely event that an infant spits 
out or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single replacement dose may be given at the same 
vaccination visit. 
It is recommended that infants who receive a first dose of Rotarix complete the 2-dose regimen with 
Rotarix. There are no data on safety, immunogenicity or efficacy when Rotarix is administered for the 
first dose and another rotavirus vaccine is administered for the second dose or vice versa. 
Paediatric population 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rotarix should not be used in children over 24 weeks of age.  
Method of administration 
Rotarix is for oral use only. 
Rotarix should under no circumstances be injected. 
For instructions for administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3   Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hypersensitivity after previous administration of rotavirus vaccines. 
History of intussusception. 
Subjects with uncorrected congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract that would predispose 
for intussusception. 
Subjects with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) disorder (see section 4.8). 
Administration of Rotarix should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute severe febrile 
illness. The presence of a minor infection is not a contra-indication for immunisation. 
The administration of Rotarix should be postponed in subjects suffering from diarrhoea or vomiting. 
4.4   Special warnings and precautions for use  
It is good clinical practice that vaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history 
especially with regard to the contraindications and by a clinical examination. 
There are no data on the safety and efficacy of Rotarix in infants with gastrointestinal illnesses or 
growth retardation. Administration of Rotarix may be considered with caution in such infants when, in 
the opinion of the physician, withholding the vaccine entails a greater risk. 
As a precaution, healthcare professionals should follow-up on any symptoms indicative of 
intussusception (severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bloody stools, abdominal bloating and/or 
high fever) since data from observational safety studies indicate an increased risk of intussusception, 
mostly within 7 days after rotavirus vaccination (see section 4.8). Parents/guardians should be advised 
to promptly report such symptoms to their healthcare provider. 
For subjects with a predisposition for intussusception, see section 4.3. 
Asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic HIV infections are not expected to affect the safety or efficacy 
of Rotarix. A clinical study in a limited number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic HIV positive 
infants showed no apparent safety problems (see section 4.8). 
Administration of Rotarix to infants who have known or suspected immunodeficiency, including in 
utero exposure to an immunosuppressive treatment, should be based on careful consideration of 
potential benefits and risks. 
Excretion of the vaccine virus in the stools is known to occur after vaccination with peak excretion 
around the 7th day. Viral antigen particles detected by ELISA were found in 50% of stools after the 
first dose of Rotarix lyophilised formulation and 4% of stools after the second dose. When these stools 
were tested for the presence of live vaccine strain, only 17% were positive. In two comparative 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
controlled trials, vaccine shedding after vaccination with Rotarix liquid formulation was comparable 
to that observed after vaccination with Rotarix lyophilised formulation. 
Cases of transmission of this excreted vaccine virus to seronegative contacts of vaccinees have been 
observed without causing any clinical symptom. 
Rotarix should be administered with caution to individuals with immunodeficient close contacts, 
such as individuals with malignancies, or who are otherwise immunocompromised or individuals 
receiving immunosuppressive therapy. 
Contacts of recent vaccinees should observe personal hygiene (e.g. wash their hands after changing 
child’s nappies). 
The potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72h should be considered 
when administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born ≤ 28 weeks of 
gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. 
As the benefit of the vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or 
delayed. 
A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees (see section 5.1). 
The extent of protection that Rotarix might provide against other rotavirus strains that have not been 
circulating in clinical trials is currently unknown. Clinical studies from which efficacy data were 
derived were conducted in Europe, Central and South America, Africa and Asia (see section 5.1).  
Rotarix does not protect against gastro-enteritis due to other pathogens than rotavirus. 
No data are available on the use of Rotarix for post-exposure prophylaxis. 
Rotarix should under no circumstances be injected. 
Excipients 
This vaccine contains sucrose and glucose as excipients. Patients with rare hereditary problems of 
fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not 
take this vaccine. 
This vaccine contains 0.15 microgram phenylalanine in each dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful for 
patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). 
This vaccine contains 32 mg sodium in each dose. 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
4.5  
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Rotarix can be given concomitantly with any of the following monovalent or combination vaccines 
[including hexavalent vaccines (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib)]: diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis 
vaccine (DTPw), diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTPa), Haemophilus influenzae 
type b vaccine (Hib), inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), hepatitis B vaccine (HBV), pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine and meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine. Clinical studies demonstrated 
that the immune responses and the safety profiles of the administered vaccines were unaffected. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Concomitant administration of Rotarix and oral polio vaccine (OPV) does not affect the immune 
response to the polio antigens. Although concomitant administration of OPV may slightly reduce the 
immune response to rotavirus vaccine, clinical protection against severe rotavirus gastro-enteritis was 
shown to be maintained in a clinical trial involving more than 4 200 subjects who received Rotarix 
concomitantly with OPV. 
There are no restrictions on the infant’s consumption of food or liquid, either before or after 
vaccination. 
4.6   Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Rotarix is not intended for use in adults. There are no data on the use of Rotarix during pregnancy and 
lactation. 
Based on evidence generated in clinical trials, breast-feeding does not reduce the protection against 
rotavirus gastro-enteritis afforded by Rotarix. Therefore, breast-feeding may be continued during the 
vaccination schedule. 
4.7   Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Not relevant. 
4.8   Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety profile presented below is based on data from clinical trials conducted with either the 
lyophilised or the liquid formulation of Rotarix. 
In a total of four clinical trials, approximately 3 800 doses of Rotarix liquid formulation were 
administered to approximately 1 900 infants. Those trials have shown that the safety profile of the 
liquid formulation is comparable to the lyophilised formulation. 
In a total of twenty-three clinical trials, approximately 106 000 doses of Rotarix (lyophilised or liquid 
formulation) were administered to approximately 51 000 infants.  
In three placebo-controlled clinical trials (Finland, India and Bangladesh), in which Rotarix was 
administered alone (administration of routine paediatric vaccines was staggered), the incidence and 
severity of the solicited events (collected 8 days post-vaccination), diarrhoea, vomiting, loss of 
appetite, fever, irritability and cough/runny nose were not significantly different in the group 
receiving Rotarix when compared to the group receiving placebo. No increase in the incidence or 
severity of these events was seen with the second dose. 
In a pooled analysis from seventeen placebo-controlled clinical trials (Europe, North America, Latin 
America, Asia, Africa) including trials in which Rotarix was co-administered with routine paediatric 
vaccines (see section 4.5), the following adverse reactions (collected 31 days post-vaccination) were 
considered as possibly related to vaccination.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Intussusception 
Data from observational safety studies performed in several countries indicate that rotavirus vaccines 
carry an increased risk of intussusception, mostly within 7 days of vaccination. Up to 6 additional 
cases per 100 000 infants have been observed in these countries against a background incidence of 25 
to 101 per 100 000 infants (less than one year of age) per year, respectively. 
There is limited evidence of a smaller increased risk following the second dose.  
It remains unclear whether rotavirus vaccines affect the overall incidence of intussusception based on 
longer periods of follow-up (see section 4.4). 
Other special populations  
Safety in preterm infants 
In a clinical study, 670 pre-term infants from 27 to 36 weeks of gestational age were administered 
Rotarix lyophilised formulation and 339 received placebo. The first dose was administered from 6 
weeks after birth. Serious adverse events were observed in 5.1% of recipients of Rotarix as compared 
with 6.8% of placebo recipients. Similar rates of other adverse events were observed in Rotarix and 
placebo recipients. No cases of intussusception were reported. 
Safety in infants with human immunodeficiency (HIV) infection 
In a clinical study, 100 infants with HIV infection were administered Rotarix lyophilised formulation 
or placebo. The safety profile was similar between Rotarix and placebo recipients. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

Some cases of overdose have been reported. In general, the adverse event profile reported in these 
cases was similar to that observed after administration of the recommended dose of Rotarix.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmaco-therapeutic group: rotavirus diarrhoea vaccines, ATC code: J07BH01 
Protective efficacy of the lyophilised formulation 
In clinical trials, efficacy was demonstrated against gastro-enteritis due to rotavirus of the most 
common genotypes G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8] and G9P[8]. In addition, efficacy against 
uncommon rotavirus genotypes G8P[4] (severe gastro-enteritis) and G12P[6] (any gastro-enteritis) has 
been demonstrated. These strains are circulating worldwide. 
Clinical studies have been conducted in Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia to evaluate the 
protective efficacy of Rotarix against any and severe rotavirus gastro-enteritis (RVGE). 
Severity of gastro-enteritis was defined according to two different criteria: 
- the Vesikari 20-point scale, which evaluates the full clinical picture of rotavirus gastro-enteritis by 
taking into account the severity and duration of diarrhoea and vomiting, the severity of fever and 
dehydration as well as the need for treatment 
or 
- the clinical case definition based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria 
Clinical protection was assessed in the ATP cohort for efficacy, which includes all subjects from the 
ATP cohort for safety who entered into the concerned efficacy follow-up period. 
Protective efficacy in Europe 
A clinical study performed in Europe evaluated Rotarix given according to different European

A pooled analysis of five efficacy studies*, showed a 71.4% (95% CI: 20.1;91.1) efficacy against 
severe rotavirus gastro-enteritis (Vesikari score ≥ 11) caused by rotavirus G2P[4] genotype during the 
first year of life. 
* In these studies, the point estimates and confidence intervals were respectively: 100% (95% 
CI: -1 858.0;100), 100% (95% CI: 21.1;100), 45.4% (95% CI: -81.5;86.6), 74.7% (95%

Sustained efficacy up to 3 years of age in Asia 
A clinical study conducted in Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan) (Total vaccinated cohort: 
Rotarix: N = 5 359; placebo: N = 5 349) evaluated Rotarix given according to different schedules (2, 4 
months of age; 3, 4 months of age). 
During the first year, significantly fewer subjects in the Rotarix group reported severe rotavirus gastro-
enteritis caused by the circulating wild-type RV compared to the placebo group from 2 weeks after 
Dose 2 up to one year of age (0.0% versus 0.3%), with a vaccine efficacy of 100% (95% CI: 
72.2;100).

† Severe gastro-enteritis was defined as a score ≥ 11 on the Vesikari scale 
* Not statistically significant (p ≥ 0.05). These data should be interpreted with caution. 
During the third year of life, there were no cases of severe RV gastro-enteritis in the Rotarix group 
(N=4 222) versus 13 (0.3%) in the placebo group (N=4 185). Vaccine efficacy was 100% (95% CI: 
67.5; 100). The severe RV gastro-enteritis cases were due to RV strains G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8] and 
G9P[8]. The incidence of severe RV gastro-enteritis associated with the individual genotypes was too 
small to allow calculation of efficacy. The efficacy against severe RV gastro-enteritis requiring 
hospitalisation was 100% (95% CI: 72.4;100). 
Protective efficacy of the liquid formulation 
Since the immune response observed after 2 doses of Rotarix liquid formulation was comparable to 
the immune response observed after 2 doses of Rotarix lyophilised formulation, the levels of vaccine 
efficacy observed with the lyophilised formulation can be extrapolated to the liquid formulation. 
Immune response 
The immunologic mechanism by which Rotarix protects against rotavirus gastro-enteritis is not 
completely understood. A relationship between antibody responses to rotavirus vaccination and 
protection against rotavirus gastro-enteritis has not been established.  
The following table shows the percentage of subjects initially seronegative for rotavirus (IgA antibody 
titres < 20 U/mL) (by ELISA) with serum anti-rotavirus IgA antibody titres ≥ 20 U/mL one to two 
months after the second dose of vaccine or placebo as observed in different studies with Rotarix 
lyophilised formulation.

Immune response in preterm infants 
In a clinical study conducted in preterm infants, born after at least 27 weeks of gestational age, the 
immunogenicity of Rotarix was assessed in a subset of 147 subjects and showed that Rotarix is 
immunogenic in this population; 85.7% (95% CI: 79.0;90.9) of subjects achieved serum anti-rotavirus 
IgA antibody titres ≥ 20 U/mL (by ELISA) one month after the second dose of vaccine. 
Effectiveness 
In observational studies, vaccine effectiveness was demonstrated against severe gastro-enteritis 
leading to hospitalisation due to rotavirus of common genotypes G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8] and 
G9P[8] as well as the less common rotavirus genotypes G9P[4] and G9P[6]. All of these strains are 
circulating worldwide.

Impact on mortality§ 
Impact studies with Rotarix conducted in Panama, Brazil and Mexico showed a decrease in all-cause 
diarrhoea mortality ranging from 17% to 73% in children less than 5 years of age, within 2 to 4 years 
after vaccine introduction. 
Impact on hospitalisation§ 
In a retrospective database study in Belgium conducted in children 5 years of age and younger, the 
direct and indirect impact of Rotarix vaccination on rotavirus-related hospitalisation ranged from 64% 
(95% CI: 49;76) to 80% (95% CI: 77;83) two years after vaccine introduction. Similar studies in 
Armenia, Australia, Brazil, Canada, El Salvador and Zambia showed a reduction of 45 to 93% 
between 2 and 4 years after vaccine introduction. 
In addition, nine impact studies on all-cause diarrhoea hospitalisation conducted in Africa and Latin 
America showed a reduction of 14% to 57% between 2 and 5 years after vaccine introduction. 
§NOTE: Impact studies are meant to establish a temporal relationship but not a causal relationship 
between the disease and vaccination. Natural fluctuations of the incidence of the disease may also 
influence the observed temporal effect.

Package leaflet: Information for the user  
Rotarix powder and solvent for oral suspension 
rotavirus vaccine, live 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before your child receives this vaccine because it contains 
important information for you. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. 
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
This vaccine has been prescribed for your child only. Do not pass it on to others. 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. 
What is in this leaflet 
1.  What Rotarix is and what it is used for 
2.  What you need to know before your child receives Rotarix 
3.  How Rotarix is given 
4.  Possible side effects 
5.  How to store Rotarix 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Rotarix is and what it is used for  
Rotarix is a viral vaccine, containing live, attenuated human rotavirus, that helps to protect your child, 
from the age of 6 weeks, against gastro-enteritis (diarrhoea and vomiting) caused by rotavirus 
infection. 
How Rotarix works 
Rotavirus infection is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea in infants and young children. 
Rotavirus is easily spread from hand-to-mouth due to contact with stools from an infected person. 
Most children with rotavirus diarrhoea recover on their own. However, some children become very ill 
with severe vomiting, diarrhoea and life-threatening loss of fluids that requires hospitalisation. 
When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defences) will make 
antibodies against the most commonly occurring types of rotavirus. These antibodies protect against 
disease caused by these types of rotavirus. 
As with all vaccines, Rotarix may not completely protect all people who are vaccinated against the 
rotavirus infections it is intended to prevent. 
2.  What you need to know before your child receives Rotarix  
Rotarix should not be given 
• 
if your child has previously had any allergic reaction to rotavirus vaccines or any of the other 
ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy 
skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. 
if your child has previously had intussusception (a bowel obstruction in which one segment of 
bowel becomes enfolded within another segment). 
if your child was born with a malformation of the gut that could lead to intussusception. 
if your child has a rare inherited illness which affects their immune system called Severe 
Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID). 
if your child has a severe infection with a high temperature. It might be necessary to postpone 
the vaccination until recovery. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but 
talk to your doctor first.

Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor/health care professional before your child receives Rotarix if: 
• 
he/she has a close contact such as a household member who has a weakened immune system, 
e.g., a person with cancer or who is taking medicines that may weaken the immune system. 
he/she has any disorder of the gastrointestinal system. 
he/she has not been gaining weight and growing as expected. 
he/she has any disease or is taking any medicine which reduces his/her resistance to infection or 
if his/her mother has taken during pregnancy any medicine that may weaken the immune 
system. 
• 
• 
• 
After your child has received Rotarix, contact a doctor/health care professional right away if your 
child experiences severe stomach pain, persistent vomiting, blood in stools, a swollen belly and/or 
high fever (see also section 4 “Possible side effects”). 
As always, please take care to wash your hands thoroughly after changing soiled nappies. 
Other medicines and Rotarix 
Tell your doctor if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines or has 
recently received any other vaccine. 
Rotarix may be given at the same time your child receives other normally recommended vaccines, 
such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b, oral or 
inactivated polio, hepatitis B vaccines as well as pneumococcal and meningococcal serogroup C 
conjugate vaccines. 
Rotarix with food and drink 
There are no restrictions on your child’s consumption of food or liquids, either before or after 
vaccination. 
Breast-feeding 
Based on evidence generated in clinical trials, breast-feeding does not reduce the protection against 
rotavirus gastro-enteritis afforded by Rotarix. Therefore, breast-feeding may be continued during the 
vaccination schedule. 
Rotarix contains sorbitol, sucrose, glucose, phenylalanine and sodium 
This vaccine contains 13.5 mg sorbitol in each dose.  
If you have been told by your doctor that the child being vaccinated has an intolerance to some sugars, 
contact your doctor before your child receives this vaccine. 
This vaccine contains 0.15 microgram phenylalanine in each dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful if 
your child has phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up 
because the body cannot remove it properly. 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) in each dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How Rotarix is given  
The doctor or nurse will administer the recommended dose of Rotarix to your child. The vaccine 
(1 mL liquid) will be given orally. Under no circumstance should this vaccine be administered by 
injection. 
Your child will receive two doses of the vaccine. Each dose will be given on a separate occasion with 
an interval of at least 4 weeks between the two doses. The first dose may be given from the age of 6 
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
weeks. The two doses of the vaccine must have been given by the age of 24 weeks, although they 
should preferably have been given before 16 weeks of age.  
Rotarix may be given according to the same vaccination course to infants who were born prematurely, 
provided that the pregnancy had lasted at least 27 weeks. 
In case your child spits out or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single replacement dose may be 
given at the same vaccination visit. 
When Rotarix is given to your child for the first dose, it is recommended that your child also receives 
Rotarix (and not another rotavirus vaccine) for the second dose.  
It is important that you follow the instructions of your doctor or nurse regarding return visits. If you 
forget to go back to your doctor at the scheduled time, ask your doctor for advice. 
4.

solvent.  
The solvent should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or abnormal physical 
appearance prior to reconstitution.  
After reconstitution: 
The reconstituted vaccine is slightly more turbid than the solvent and is milky white in appearance. 
The reconstituted vaccine should also be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or 
abnormal physical appearance prior to administration. In the event of either being observed, discard the 
vaccine.  
Any unused vaccine or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

4.  Possible side effects 
5.  How to store Rotarix 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Rotarix is and what it is used for  
Rotarix is a viral vaccine, containing live, attenuated human rotavirus, that helps to protect your child, 
from the age of 6 weeks, against gastro-enteritis (diarrhoea and vomiting) caused by rotavirus 
infection. 
How Rotarix works 
Rotavirus infection is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea in infants and young children. 
Rotavirus is easily spread from hand-to-mouth due to contact with stools from an infected person. 
Most children with rotavirus diarrhoea recover on their own. However, some children become very ill 
with severe vomiting, diarrhoea and life-threatening loss of fluids that requires hospitalisation.  
When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defences) will make 
antibodies against the most commonly occurring types of rotavirus. These antibodies protect against 
disease caused by these types of rotavirus. 
As with all vaccines, Rotarix may not completely protect all people who are vaccinated against the 
rotavirus infections it is intended to prevent. 
2.  What you need to know before your child receives Rotarix  
Rotarix should not be given 
• 
if your child has previously had any allergic reaction to rotavirus vaccines or any of the other 
ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy 
skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. 
if your child has previously had intussusception (a bowel obstruction in which one segment of 
bowel becomes enfolded within another segment). 
if your child was born with a malformation of the gut that could lead to intussusception. 
if your child has a rare inherited illness which affects their immune system called Severe 
Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID). 
if your child has a severe infection with a high temperature. It might be necessary to postpone 
the vaccination until recovery. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but 
talk to your doctor first. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
if your child has diarrhoea or is vomiting. It might be necessary to postpone the vaccination 
until recovery. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor/health care professional before your child receives Rotarix if: 
• 
he/she has a close contact such as a household member who has a weakened immune system, 
e.g., a person with cancer or who is taking medicines that may weaken the immune system. 
he/she has any disorder of the gastrointestinal system. 
he/she has not been gaining weight and growing as expected. 
he/she has any disease or is taking any medicine which reduces his/her resistance to infection or 
if his/her mother has taken during pregnancy any medicine that may weaken the immune 
system. 
• 
• 
• 
After your child has received Rotarix, contact a doctor/health care professional right away if your 
child experiences severe stomach pain, persistent vomiting, blood in stools, a swollen belly and/or 
high fever (see also section 4 “Possible side effects”). 
As always, please take care to wash your hands thoroughly after changing soiled nappies. 
Other medicines and Rotarix 
Tell your doctor if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines or has 
recently received any other vaccine. 
Rotarix may be given at the same time your child receives other normally recommended vaccines, 
such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b, oral or 
inactivated polio, hepatitis B vaccines as well as pneumococcal and meningococcal serogroup C 
conjugate vaccines. 
Rotarix with food and drink 
There are no restrictions on your child’s consumption of food or liquids, either before or after 
vaccination. 
Breast-feeding 
Based on evidence generated in clinical trials, breast-feeding does not reduce the protection against 
rotavirus gastro-enteritis afforded by Rotarix. Therefore, breast-feeding may be continued during the 
vaccination schedule. 
Rotarix contains sucrose, glucose, phenylalanine and sodium 
If you have been told by your doctor that the child being vaccinated has an intolerance to some sugars, 
contact your doctor before your child receives this vaccine. 
This vaccine contains 0.15 microgram phenylalanine in each dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful if 
your child has phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up 
because the body cannot remove it properly. 
This vaccine contains 32 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each dose. 
3. 
How Rotarix is given  
The doctor or nurse will administer the recommended dose of Rotarix to your child. The vaccine 
(1.5 mL liquid) will be given orally. Under no circumstance should this vaccine be administered by 
injection. 
Your child will receive two doses of the vaccine. Each dose will be given on a separate occasion with 
an interval of at least 4 weeks between the two doses. The first dose may be given from the age of 6 
weeks. The two doses of the vaccine must have been given by the age of 24 weeks, although they 
should preferably have been given before 16 weeks of age.  
65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rotarix may be given according to the same vaccination course to infants who were born prematurely, 
provided that the pregnancy had lasted at least 27 weeks. 
In case your child spits out or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single replacement dose may be 
given at the same vaccination visit. 
When Rotarix is given to your child for the first dose, it is recommended that your child also receives 
Rotarix (and not another rotavirus vaccine) for the second dose.  
It is important that you follow the instructions of your doctor or nurse regarding return visits. If you 
forget to go back to your doctor at the scheduled time, ask your doctor for advice.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Rotarix is and what it is used for  
Rotarix is a viral vaccine, containing live, attenuated human rotavirus, that helps to protect your child, 
from the age of 6 weeks, against gastro-enteritis (diarrhoea and vomiting) caused by rotavirus 
infection. 
How Rotarix works 
Rotavirus infection is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea in infants and young children. 
Rotavirus is easily spread from hand-to-mouth due to contact with stools from an infected person. 
Most children with rotavirus diarrhoea recover on their own. However, some children become very ill 
with severe vomiting, diarrhoea and life-threatening loss of fluids that requires hospitalisation.  
When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defences) will make 
antibodies against the most commonly occurring types of rotavirus. These antibodies protect against 
disease caused by these types of rotavirus. 
As with all vaccines, Rotarix may not completely protect all people who are vaccinated against the 
rotavirus infections it is intended to prevent. 
2.  What you need to know before your child receives Rotarix  
Rotarix should not be given 
• 
if your child has previously had any allergic reaction to rotavirus vaccines or any of the other 
ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy 
skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. 
if your child has previously had intussusception (a bowel obstruction in which one segment of 
bowel becomes enfolded within another segment). 
if your child was born with a malformation of the gut that could lead to intussusception. 
if your child has a rare inherited illness which affects their immune system called Severe 
Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID). 
if your child has a severe infection with a high temperature. It might be necessary to postpone 
the vaccination until recovery. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but 
talk to your doctor first. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
70 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
if your child has diarrhoea or is vomiting. It might be necessary to postpone the vaccination 
until recovery. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor/health care professional before your child receives Rotarix if: 
• 
he/she has a close contact such as a household member who has a weakened immune system, 
e.g., a person with cancer or who is taking medicines that may weaken the immune system. 
he/she has any disorder of the gastrointestinal system. 
he/she has not been gaining weight and growing as expected. 
he/she has any disease or is taking any medicine which reduces his/her resistance to infection or 
if his/her mother has taken during pregnancy any medicine that may weaken the immune 
system. 
• 
• 
• 
After your child has received Rotarix, contact a doctor/health care professional right away if your 
child experiences severe stomach pain, persistent vomiting, blood in stools, a swollen belly and/or 
high fever (see also section 4 “Possible side effects”). 
As always, please take care to wash your hands thoroughly after changing soiled nappies. 
Other medicines and Rotarix 
Tell your doctor if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines or has 
recently received any other vaccine. 
Rotarix may be given at the same time your child receives other normally recommended vaccines, 
such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b, oral or 
inactivated polio, hepatitis B vaccines as well as pneumococcal and meningococcal serogroup C 
conjugate vaccines. 
Rotarix with food and drink 
There are no restrictions on your child’s consumption of food or liquids, either before or after 
vaccination. 
Breast-feeding 
Based on evidence generated in clinical trials, breast-feeding does not reduce the protection against 
rotavirus gastro-enteritis afforded by Rotarix. Therefore, breast-feeding may be continued during the 
vaccination schedule. 
Rotarix contains sucrose, glucose, phenylalanine and sodium 
If you have been told by your doctor that the child being vaccinated has an intolerance to some sugars, 
contact your doctor before your child receives this vaccine. 
This vaccine contains 0.15 microgram phenylalanine in each dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful if 
your child has phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up 
because the body cannot remove it properly. 
This vaccine contains 32 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each dose. 
3. 
How Rotarix is given  
The doctor or nurse will administer the recommended dose of Rotarix to your child. The vaccine 
(1.5 mL liquid) will be given orally. Under no circumstance should this vaccine be administered by 
injection. 
Your child will receive two doses of the vaccine. Each dose will be given on a separate occasion with 
an interval of at least 4 weeks between the two doses. The first dose may be given from the age of 6 
weeks. The two doses of the vaccine must have been given by the age of 24 weeks, although they 
should preferably have been given before 16 weeks of age.  
71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rotarix may be given according to the same vaccination course to infants who were born prematurely, 
provided that the pregnancy had lasted at least 27 weeks. 
In case your child spits out or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single replacement dose may be 
given at the same vaccination visit. 
When Rotarix is given to your child for the first dose, it is recommended that your child also receives 
Rotarix (and not another rotavirus vaccine) for the second dose.  
It is important that you follow the instructions of your doctor or nurse regarding return visits. If you 
forget to go back to your doctor at the scheduled time, ask your doctor for advice. 
4. 
Possible side effects

stools. The signs of gastroenteritis may include feeling sick, being sick, stomach cramps or 
diarrhoea. 
Reporting of side effects  
If your child gets any of the side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible 
side effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting 
system listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the 
safety of this medicine. 
5.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Rotarix is and what it is used for  
Rotarix is a viral vaccine, containing live, attenuated human rotavirus, that helps to protect your child, 
from the age of 6 weeks, against gastro-enteritis (diarrhoea and vomiting) caused by rotavirus 
infection. 
How Rotarix works 
Rotavirus infection is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea in infants and young children. 
Rotavirus is easily spread from hand-to-mouth due to contact with stools from an infected person. 
Most children with rotavirus diarrhoea recover on their own. However, some children become very ill 
with severe vomiting, diarrhoea and life-threatening loss of fluids that requires hospitalisation.  
When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defences) will make 
antibodies against the most commonly occurring types of rotavirus. These antibodies protect against 
disease caused by these types of rotavirus. 
As with all vaccines, Rotarix may not completely protect all people who are vaccinated against the 
rotavirus infections it is intended to prevent. 
2.  What you need to know before your child receives Rotarix  
Rotarix should not be given 
• 
if your child has previously had any allergic reaction to rotavirus vaccines or any of the other 
ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy 
skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. 
if your child has previously had intussusception (a bowel obstruction in which one segment of 
bowel becomes enfolded within another segment). 
if your child was born with a malformation of the gut that could lead to intussusception. 
if your child has a rare inherited illness which affects their immune system called Severe 
Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID). 
if your child has a severe infection with a high temperature. It might be necessary to postpone 
the vaccination until recovery. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but 
talk to your doctor first. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
77 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
if your child has diarrhoea or is vomiting. It might be necessary to postpone the vaccination 
until recovery. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor/health care professional before your child receives Rotarix if: 
• 
he/she has a close contact such as a household member who has a weakened immune system, 
e.g., a person with cancer or who is taking medicines that may weaken the immune system. 
he/she has any disorder of the gastrointestinal system. 
he/she has not been gaining weight and growing as expected. 
he/she has any disease or is taking any medicine which reduces his/her resistance to infection or 
if his/her mother has taken during pregnancy any medicine that may weaken the immune 
system. 
• 
• 
• 
After your child has received Rotarix, contact a doctor/health care professional right away if your 
child experiences severe stomach pain, persistent vomiting, blood in stools, a swollen belly and/or 
high fever (see also section 4 “Possible side effects”). 
As always, please take care to wash your hands thoroughly after changing soiled nappies. 
Other medicines and Rotarix 
Tell your doctor if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other medicines or has 
recently received any other vaccine. 
Rotarix may be given at the same time your child receives other normally recommended vaccines, 
such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b, oral or 
inactivated polio, hepatitis B vaccines as well as pneumococcal and meningococcal serogroup C 
conjugate vaccines. 
Rotarix with food and drink 
There are no restrictions on your child’s consumption of food or liquids, either before or after 
vaccination. 
Breast-feeding 
Based on evidence generated in clinical trials, breast-feeding does not reduce the protection against 
rotavirus gastro-enteritis afforded by Rotarix. Therefore, breast-feeding may be continued during the 
vaccination schedule. 
Rotarix contains sucrose, glucose, phenylalanine and sodium 
If you have been told by your doctor that the child being vaccinated has an intolerance to some sugars, 
contact your doctor before your child receives this vaccine. 
This vaccine contains 0.15 microgram phenylalanine in each dose. Phenylalanine may be harmful if 
your child has phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up 
because the body cannot remove it properly. 
This vaccine contains 32 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each dose. 
3. 
How Rotarix is given  
The doctor or nurse will administer the recommended dose of Rotarix to your child. The vaccine 
(1.5 mL liquid) will be given orally. Under no circumstance should this vaccine be administered by 
injection. 
Your child will receive two doses of the vaccine. Each dose will be given on a separate occasion with 
an interval of at least 4 weeks between the two doses. The first dose may be given from the age of 6 
weeks. The two doses of the vaccine must have been given by the age of 24 weeks, although they 
should preferably have been given before 16 weeks of age.  
78 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rotarix may be given according to the same vaccination course to infants who were born prematurely, 
provided that the pregnancy had lasted at least 27 weeks. 
In case your child spits out or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single replacement dose may be 
given at the same vaccination visit. 
When Rotarix is given to your child for the first dose, it is recommended that your child also receives 
Rotarix (and not another rotavirus vaccine) for the second dose.  
It is important that you follow the instructions of your doctor or nurse regarding return visits. If you 
forget to go back to your doctor at the scheduled time, ask your doctor for advice.

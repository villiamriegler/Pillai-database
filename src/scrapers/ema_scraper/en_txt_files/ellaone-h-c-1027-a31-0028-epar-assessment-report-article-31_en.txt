1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Referral of the matter to the CHMP 
On 16 January 2014, Sweden triggered a referral under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC. The CHMP 
was requested to give its opinion on whether the marketing authorisations for emergency 
contraceptives medicinal products containing levonorgestrel or ulipristal should be maintained, varied, 
suspended or withdrawn. 
The procedure described in Article 32 of Directive 2001/83/EC was applicable. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Emergency contraceptives are medicinal products that can be used to prevent an unintended 
pregnancy following an unprotected sexual intercourse or in case of failure of a contraceptive method. 
Available products in the EU contain either levonorgestrel (LNG) or ulipristal acetate (UPA). The 
products act by inhibiting and/or delaying ovulation.  
LNG is a synthetic progestagen. For emergency contraception one tablet of 1.5 mg LNG needs to be 
taken, or two tablets of 0.75 mg LNG at once. The products are indicated for emergency contraception 
within 72 hours (3 days) of unprotected sexual intercourse or contraceptive failure, and have been 
approved in more than 100 countries worldwide and used for more than 30 years. LNG-containing 
emergency contraceptives are available as over-the-counter (OTC) medicinal products in several 
European countries. 
UPA (30 mg) (ellaOne) is an orally active synthetic progesterone receptor modulator, which acts via 
high affinity binding to the human progesterone receptor. The product is indicated for emergency 
contraception within 120 hours (5 days) of unprotected sexual intercourse or contraceptive failure. UPA 
has been approved for emergency contraception in 73 countries and is marketed in 55 of them. UPA 
has been administered to more than 1.4 million women worldwide. 
In November 2013, for one of the LNG-containing products (Norlevo) a mutual recognition variation 
procedure was finalised. The outcome of that procedure was that information was included in the 
product information regarding the effect of the woman´s body weight on the effect of the product. 
Contraceptive efficacy was reduced in women weighing 75 kg or more, and LNG was not effective in 
women who weighed more than 80 kg. These revisions were based on analyses of two clinical studies 
(HRA2914-507 and HRA2914-513) primarily intended to demonstrate the efficacy of UPA acetate as an 
emergency contraceptive and in which LNG was used as an active comparator.  
Furthermore in a post-hoc analysis of pregnancies in the LNG group, the effect of body weight on 
pregnancy rate was analysed. The analysis is also described in a published paper (Glasier et al., 
2011)1, in which BMI (body mass index) was the co-variate primarily analysed. The authors concluded 
that women with a BMI above 25 kg/m2 will have an increased risk of pregnancy upon use of LNG as 
an emergency contraceptive compared to women with a BMI below 25 kg/m2. 
The ability of LNG-containing emergency contraceptives to prevent an unintended pregnancy seems to 
be impaired with increasing body weight and/or BMI (body mass index).  Other LNG-containing 
emergency contraceptives have no information included in the product information with respect to

trials of ulipristal acetate and levonorgestrel, Contraception (2011); 84, 363–367

reduced efficacy at increased weight/BMI. Since LNG-containing emergency contraceptive products are 
available as over-the-counter (OTC) medicinal products in several Member States, it is particularly 
important to review all available clinical data related to this issue, with the view that the correct 
information reflecting the existing clinical data is available to women.  
For UPA, a similar effect of increasing weight/BMI on the efficacy cannot be excluded and further 
evaluation is needed. Currently, for UPA no information regarding the woman´s weight or BMI is 
included in the product information. Corresponding analyses have, however, been performed for UPA 
and are published by Moreau and Trussell (2012)2, where it is concluded that the pregnancy rate was 
higher in obese women (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 or weight > 85 kg) compared with women of normal weight 
or BMI.  
Based on the above considerations for both INNs, on 16 January 2014 the Swedish Agency sent a 
notification for a referral under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83 EC regarding all emergency 
contraceptives containing LNG or UPA, asking the CHMP to give its opinion on whether the marketing 
authorisations should be maintained, varied, suspended or withdrawn.  
2.2.  Clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.2.1.1.  PK for LNG 
There are no pharmacokinetic (PK) studies on orally administered LNG-only, which evaluated effect of 
body weight. However during this procedure, data are discussed that were extracted from PK studies 
performed with combined oral contraceptives. After administration of combined oral contraceptives 
(LNG + ethinylestradiol) obese women (BMI >30) showed a lower LNG Cmax, a lower AUC0-24h and an 
increased terminal half-life, but comparable trough levels. The differences in PK might be explained by 
altered distribution and slower elimination due to the lipophilic characteristics of LNG.  
2.2.1.2.  PK/PD for LNG 
The relationship between pharmacokinetics and delay of ovulation is not clear and the minimum 
required plasma concentration of LNG-only for adequate efficacy after a single dose as an emergency 
contraceptive (EC) is unknown.  
For combined oral contraceptives, containing LNG in combination with ethinylestradiol it was concluded 
that the steady state plasma levels of LNG in obese women are still well above the minimum effective 
concentration needed for adequate suppression of ovulation. For LNG-only used as emergency 
contraceptives this has not been established. 
Based on a study by Croxatto and colleagues (2004)3it can be concluded that the minimum required 
LNG concentration for adequate delay of ovulation is probably much lower than the usually observed 
concentrations of a standard 1.5 mg dose for emergency contraception. In this study, it was observed 
that a single dose of 0.75 mg LNG as emergency contraceptive was at least as effective as the 
currently used standard 1.5 mg dose for delay of ovulation in the 5-day period needed for emergency 
contraceptive effectiveness, despite that the Cmax and AUC of LNG were about 50% lower. Very early

publications on the minimal effective dose report that even a single dose of 0.4 mg LNG could be 
sufficient (Kesseru et al., 1974)4. 
Therefore,  the  treatment  with  an  emergency  contraceptive  with  1.5  mg  LNG  may  still  result  in 
appropriate  effectiveness  in  obese  women,  despite  the  differences  in  PK  between  normal  weight  and 
obese women.  
2.2.1.3.  PK for UPA 
It is unknown if the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of UPA are different between 
normal weight and obese women.  
2.3.  Clinical efficacy 
Obesity is a known risk factor for subfertility during anovulation. Current fertility guidelines (NICE, 
2013) therefore also recommend that women who have a BMI of 30 or over and who are not ovulating 
should be informed that losing weight is likely to increase their chance of conception. Also when a 
woman is ovulating with a BMI of 30 or over, the recommendation is to inform her that she is likely to 
take longer to conceive. In the emergency contraceptive studies only women with regular menstrual 
cycles are included. 
Van der Steeg and colleagues (2008)5 evaluated the spontaneous pregnancy chances in subfertile, 
ovulatory women. By analysis of 3029 subfertile couples, the authors found that the probability of a 
spontaneous pregnancy declined linearly with a BMI over 29 kg/m2. Corrected for possible related 
factors, women with a high BMI had a 4% lower pregnancy rate per kg/m2 increase [hazard ratio: 0.96 
(95% CI 0.91–0.99)]. The results indicate that obesity is associated with lower pregnancy rates in 
subfertile ovulatory women. Although this study was performed in subfertile, ovulatory women, it could 
be expected that in the general population of women, there will also be a trend for a decrease in 
pregnancy chance with an increasing BMI of 30 and over. 
2.3.1.  Efficacy for hormonal contraceptives 
A Cochrane analysis (Lopez et al., 2013)6 on hormonal contraceptives for contraception in overweight 
or obese women found nine reports with data from 13 trials. Five reports from 2002 to 2012 compared 
BMI groups; of those, one reported a higher pregnancy risk for overweight or obese women. In the 
other four studies the comparisons reported were not significantly different for pregnancy. Further, the 
investigators did not see any trends when they examined deciles for weight and BMI in these four 
studies. Lopez and colleagues (2013) concluded that the evidence did not generally show an 
association of BMI with effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.  
2.3.2.  Efficacy for emergency contraceptives 
In the case of emergency contraception, efficacy was demonstrated initially in non-comparative 
observational studies, since the use of placebo was felt to be unethical. Therefore, the chance that 
pregnancy would occur in the absence of emergency contraception is estimated indirectly using 
published data on the probability of pregnancy on each day of the menstrual cycle. The effectiveness of

emergency contraception has been estimated by comparing the observed number of pregnancies with 
the number of pregnancies expected in the absence of treatment.  
According to the most common method, the expected number of pregnancies is estimated by 
multiplying the number of treated women who had unprotected intercourse, on each cycle day relative 
to the expected day of ovulation, by external estimates of the probability of conception resulting from 
unprotected intercourse on that cycle day.  
In the early 60’s, Tietze estimated that the chance of pregnancy with one completely random act of 
intercourse was 2% to 4%. More recently, Holmes and her colleagues reported that the probability of 
pregnancy after rape was 5% in a national sample of US women. A specific approach frequently used 
for the purpose was suggested by Dixon and colleagues. Dixon created a single set of pregnancy rates 
from several published studies (Barett, 1969; Holmes, 1996; Vollman, 1977). An arbitrary error 
distribution was added to account for the biologic variability of ovulation day. With Dixon’s method, 14 
days are subtracted from a woman’s usual cycle length to estimate the “usual cycle day of ovulation”. 
Dixon’s pregnancy rates are then applied to the intercourse day relative to this inferred cycle day of 
ovulation. Women with irregular cycles were excluded from the study. 
Trussel and colleagues (1998)7 derived estimated conception probabilities by cycle day from two 
datasets (British and North Carolina trials, representing 237 pregnancies out of 1027 ovulatory cycles) 
on the outcomes of a trial in which 4136 women were enrolled. (These datasets include only clinical 
pregnancies and exclude those diagnosed by biochemistry only, and thus not likely to be recognized as 
pregnancy by the patients.) The authors assigned non-zero estimated conception probabilities to cycle 
days -5 to +1 (relative to day of ovulation). 
Although several further modifications or new estimations of these probabilities have been published 
since then, the Trussell 1998 method is the most frequently used one. As estimated pregnancy rates 
may differ when using the Trussel 1998 method to define average conception probability for particular 
study populations, a remarkable difference was observed between the estimation for the meta-analysis 
of Glasier and colleagues (2010)8 and that of the WHO studies. 
There are a many factors that can affect a woman’s probability of pregnancy, i.e. the fertile window 
and ovulation. The expected day of ovulation is estimated as the usual cycle length minus 14 days. 
However, in only about 30% of women is the fertile window entirely between days 10 and 17, as 
identified by the clinical guidelines. The other 70% of women reach their fertile window earlier and 
others much later. The question is further complicated by women who have irregular cycles; their 
percentage was reported to be 16% in a study by Wilcox and colleagues (2001)9 During the study, 
these women tended to ovulate later and at more variable times, resulting in their fertile days being 
spread more broadly across their cycles. 
Despite its great practical importance, the number of fertile days during the menstrual cycle has been 
difficult to specify. Just as the day of ovulation varies from cycle to cycle, so does the timing of fertile 
days. A multicenter study by the WHO estimated that there are 10 presumably fertile days per cycle, 
on the basis of the characteristics of the cervical mucus. The length of the phase after the peak mucus 
day in the various centres parallels similar results obtained in the Colombo study. This multicentre 
study has produced a database of 7017 menstrual cycles contributed by 881 women. It provides 
improved knowledge on length and location of the “fertile window” (identified as of up to a 12-day 
duration) and the pattern and level of daily conception probability.

Eight studies have been conducted with the regimens of 0.75 mg LNG pills (1.5 mg in two split doses 
taken 12 hours apart) as well as the 1.5 mg LNG taken once as emergency contraceptives that can be 
used in support of the efficacy of LNG. Two of these comparative studies have been conducted for the 
registration dossier of UPA, HRA2914-507 and HRA2914-513. Studies from Von Hertzen and colleagues 
(2002)10 and Arowojolu and colleagues (2002)11 showed that a single 1.5 mg LNG dose was more 
efficacious than the regimen of two tablets of 0.75 mg LNG, taken 12 hours apart. The pregnancy rates 
increased with delay in starting treatment and if further acts of unprotected sexual intercourse took 
place after treatment (Arowojolu et al., 2002).

2.3.3.  Efficacy for LNG 
Eight studies have been conducted for LNG emergency contraceptives that can be used for the 
assessment of efficacy (see table above). 
One of the MAHs performed a meta-analysis on three WHO studies (Von Hertzen et al., 1998 and 
2002; Dada et al., 2010). This meta-analysis will be referred hereafter as the three WHO studies meta-
analysis. For the other studies the MAH indicated that they did not have all the needed parameters to 
be included in the analysis. 
Another MAH performed a meta-analysis on the two comparative studies HRA2914-507 (Creinin et al., 
2006) and HRA2915-513 (Glasier et al., 2010) that were part of the registration dossier for UPA. 
The data of the studies of Ho and Kwan (1993), Arowojolu (2002) and Ngai (2005) were not analysed 
in detail as they have been provided as published articles only.  
Additionally, an open label tolerance study was part of the national registration dossier of emergency 
contraceptive containing LNG (Norlevo). This open label tolerance study was not considered pivotal for 
this assessment, as efficacy was not investigated in line with the other studies provided. As the 
primary goal of the study was safety, no strict procedures were followed in the assessment of efficacy. 
Pregnancy was not ruled out before treatment intake, and pregnancy testing at follow-up was not 
systemically performed. Additionally, possible further acts of unprotected intercourse were not 
reported. 
2.3.3.1.  Description of meta-analysis of the studies 
The three WHO studies included in the meta-analysis comprise of 5859 women and 59 pregnancies.

These studies were conducted in Africa (2679 women, 46%), Asia (1925 women, 33%) and 
America/Australia/Europe (1255 women, 21%). The women included in the three WHO studies (Von 
Hertzen et al., 1998; Von Hertzen et al., 2002; Dada et al., 2010) only had one act of unprotected 
intercourse. Women with off-label use, i.e. use between 72 – 120 hours after unprotected intercourse 
were not included. The meta-analysis both included subjects with 2x0.75 mg LNG taken as a single 
dose, and 2x0.75 mg LNG taken 12 hours apart (see table 1, above). In the studies from Von Hertzen 
and colleagues (2002) and Dada and colleagues (2010) a comparable number of subjects was included 
in these two dose regimens. The study from Von Hertzen and colleagues (1998) only included the dose 
regimen 2x0.75 mg LNG taken 12 hours apart.  
The initially submitted meta-analysis of two comparative studies on LNG of another MAH included 1731 
women and 38 pregnancies. These studies were conducted in the USA, United Kingdom and Ireland. 
These two studies included in addition women who had multiple acts of unprotected intercourse (4.7% 
of the 1731 women). Furthermore women who used LNG off-label, i.e. use between 72 – 120 hours 
after unprotected intercourse (UPI), were also included. This comprised 106 subjects (and 3 
pregnancies that occurred in these women). Similarly this meta-analysis includes subjects that had 
taken 2x0.75 mg LNG taken 12 hours apart in study HRA2914-507 and 2x0.75 mg LNG as a single 
dose in study HRA2914-513. 
Lastly, the two study populations included in this meta-analysis are slightly different. The primary 
efficacy population in study HRA2914-507 (Creinin et al., 2006) was the Efficacy Evaluable population 
consisting of all subjects who took both doses of the study drug without additional emergency 
contraceptive treatment during the study cycle and met one of the post-treatment criteria (i.e. had 
menses with a negative urine pregnancy test; verified amenorrheic with a negative pregnancy test; or 
verified as a post-treatment pregnancy).  
In study HRA2914-513 (Glasier et al., 2010) the primary efficacy population was the mITT population 
defined as randomised and received study drug; had at least one UPI in the current cycle before 
enrolment; participated for the first time in the current study; known pregnancy status using high 
sensitivity urinary pregnancy test after emergency contraceptive intake; 35 years of age or younger; if 
pregnant, pregnancy not identified as started before emergency contraceptive intake or as “not 
compatible” with an emergency contraceptive failure, based on independent evaluation as assessed by 
the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. 
After performing a new analysis excluding off-label use (i.e. intake between 72-120 hours after UPI) 
and those women who had had further acts of unprotected intercourse, this new meta-analysis based 
on the two comparative studies on LNG included 1548 subjects and 29 pregnancies. 
2.3.3.2.  Body weight and pregnancy rate 
Meta-analysis of three WHO studies: 
In the meta-analysis based on three WHO studies (Von Hertzen et al., 1998; Von Hertzen et al., 2002; 
Dada et al., 2010), the pregnancy rate in women with a weight between 75-79 kg and above 80 kg 
was slightly lower than in women with a weight of 74 kg or lower. However, a limited number of 
subjects was included in the weight groups ‘75-79 kg’ and ‘above 80 kg’.

Meta-analysis of two comparative studies: 
In contrast, the other meta-analysis suggests a trend for an increased pregnancy rate in the two 
highest weight categories selected, i.e. ‘75-85 kg’ and ‘≥ 85 kg’. Especially, in these two highest 
weight categories, the confidence limits are very wide, due to the low number of subjects included in 
these categories. 
Table 4.   Pregnancy rate (95% CI exact Clopper-Pearson method) according to weight categories 
(women treated by LNG, studies HRA2914-507 and HRA2914-513 combined)  
The number of subjects with body weight above 80 kg included in both meta-analyses is comparable, 
i.e. 261 subjects in the first analysis and 257 subjects in the second analysis. However, the pregnancy 
rates for women above 80 kg are completely different with an estimated pregnancy rate of 0.41% (75-
79 kg) and 0.38% (above 80 kg) in the first analysis (see table 3) versus 4.35% (75-85 kg) and 
5.42% (≥ 85 kg) in the analysis (see table 4), which excluded off-label use.

2.3.3.3.  BMI and pregnancy rate 
Meta-analysis of three WHO studies: 
Crude  rates  of  pregnancy,  excluding  off-label  use  (i.e.  intake  between  72-120  hours  and/or  further 
UPI), were calculated for the meta-analysis based on the three WHO studies.

The analysis for women with treatment delay of ≤ 120 hours showed that the pregnancy rates for the 
individual WHO categories are similar compared to the analysis on population for women with 
treatment delay of ≤ 72 hours for the categories underweight 1.83% for PP (0-72) versus 1.96% for 
ITT (0-120), normal 0.99% for PP (0-72) versus 1.05% for ITT (0-120), and overweight 0.57% for PP 
(0-72) versus 0.62% for ITT (0-120). For the category obese, however, the pregnancy rate in the ITT 
population (0-120) is higher than for the PP population (0-72), i.e. 1.17% for PP (0-72) versus 2.08% 
for ITT (0-120). This is due to the fact that the difference between both analyses is three pregnancies, 
6 in the ITT (0-120) population versus 3 in the PP (0-72) population in the obese category. 
Nevertheless, the pregnancy rate of 2.08% is comparable to the pregnancy rate of the underweight 
category of 1.96%. Further, the confidence intervals in the obese category are very wide and 
overlapping other categories, because only 282 subjects were included with a BMI of 30 or higher.  
Meta-analysis of two comparative studies 
Crude  rates  of  pregnancy,  including  and  excluding  off-label  use,  were  also  calculated  for  the  second 
meta-analysis including the two comparative studies.

Comparing results of both meta-analyses, it appeared that although the pregnancy rates in 
normal/underweight women are comparable in both datasets, which excluded off-label use beyond 72 
hours, the pregnancy rates between the two meta-analyses  are in contrast with each other for the 
BMI classes ‘overweight (BMI 25-30 kg/m2)’ and ‘obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2)’. In the first analysis in 
‘overweight women’ the pregnancy rate was only 0.57%, whereas this was 2.36% in the second 
dataset that included off-label use. The largest difference was observed in the ‘obese’ category (BMI 
above 30), which has a similar pregnancy rate as the normal/underweight category, but is much 
higher (5.19%) in the second analysis. There is a trend for a BMI-dependent decrease of contraceptive 
efficacy, as the pregnancy rate increases. Although the confidence limits were wide of the obese group 
(BMI>30), due to the limited number of subjects included in this category, the confidence limits of the 
obese category (CI 2.62 -9.09) do not overlap with the normal weight category (BMI 18.5-25; CI 0.44 
– 1.82).  
As already mentioned above both meta-analyses excluded off-label use of LNG, i.e. intake later than 
72 hours after unprotected intercourse and women who had further acts of unprotected intercourse. 
2.3.3.4.  Confounding factors 
As expected, the effect of conception probability (based on the method of Trussel; 1999)17, was a 
significant variable for the risk of pregnancy.  
Meta-analysis of three WHO studies: 
The most significant variable was the geographical location by continents (p<0.001), showing an 
increased risk of pregnancy in subjects from Asia compared to those from the rest of the world; a 
reduced risk was seen in subjects from Nigeria compared to the same worldwide group. A possible 
explanation could be the higher conception probability that may be found among Chinese women, 
which was observed in published comparative studies (Bilian et al., 2010)18.

Moreover, the analysis showed that 3 out of the 6 women who became pregnant in the obese category 
had taken LNG off-label in the Dada and colleagues study (2010). These 3 pregnancies have a large 
effect on the crude pregnancy rate in the obese category, which is 2.6% when off-label use is included 
(6 out of 230 subjects). The exact pregnancy rate excluding off-label use and further acts of UPI in the 
obese category in the Dada (2010) study remains unknown, as it is unknown what the number of 
subjects is in the Dada (2010) study that took LNG off-label and/or had further acts of UPI in the obese 
category. 
The division in BMI categories in the Dada and colleagues study (2010) shows a higher pregnancy rate 
only in the BMI category above 30. However, the number of obese subjects is small, which makes the 
point estimate not robust, considering the wide confidence intervals. The pregnancy rates for the 
underweight/normal weight and overweight categories are considered very low, 0.34% and 0.63%, 
respectively. Further, the division into body weight categories (<75 kg, 75-80 kg, >80 kg) are also 
very low. All categories are below 1%. 
In addition, in the Nigerian Dada and colleagues (2010) study a special subgroup of subjects was 
evident on the body weight vs. body height scatter plot: the apparent physiological peculiarity of these 
subjects is that they are exceptionally short (below 1.45 m) for their weight. A relatively large 
percentage of pregnancies occurred in short subjects (below 1.45 m) with a high BMI.  
Further, an effect was seen of age (i.e. probability of pregnancy initially increased, peaked at around 
30 years and then declined) and treatment delay (i.e. up to 48 hours treatment delay was not 
observed to influence the chances of pregnancy, but this changed after that). Especially, the effect of 
treatment delay supported that women should take emergency contraception as soon as possible after 
having had unprotected sexual intercourse. 
Meta-analysis of two comparative studies: 
The effect of the confounding factors of ‘further acts of UPI’, ‘age’, ‘ethnic group, ‘time to drug intake’ 
and ‘country (EU/USA)’ on the pregnancy risk showed that there is no statistically significant difference 
between the different weight groups in further UPI. Also, there was no relationship between weight and 
further UPI. Further, the possible confounding factors ‘age’, ‘ethnic group’, ‘time to drug intake’ and 
‘country (EU/USA)’ were investigated. The analyses suggested that these factors did not lead to a 
significant contribution to the pregnancy risk. These values were not significant for BMI or for weight. 
Comparing the results on confounding reported in both meta-analyses, the overall the impact of 
confounding factors (i.e. age, ethnicity, delay between UPI and treatment intake) that might explain 
discrepancy of results between both meta-analysis could not be excluded. 
2.3.3.5.  Spontaneous reporting 
The MAHs have analysed their own large safety database, as well as the WHO VigiBase for cases of 
Loss of Efficacy. As spontaneously reported data have limitations, the data can only be used as 
supportive data. The data do not show a signal that with increased body weight efficacy decreases. 
However, these data should be interpreted cautiously since the extent of usage may differ across 
weight categories. In addition, there are several other unknown factors (e.g. conception probability, 
further acts of intercourse, etc.). Thus, even if the data do not indicate a high representation of 
Assessment report

overweight or obese females reporting loss of efficacy, the data from spontaneous reporting are 
deemed to be of limited value in this assessment. 
2.3.4.  Efficacy for UPA 
The MAH for UPA presented several analyses on the four studies conducted with ellaOne that are 
present in the registration dossier. Taking all four studies together (Table 8), the total number of 
pregnancies included was 53 in the UPA arms (NB: 30 mg micronised UPA is bioequivalent to 50 mg 
unmicronised UPA). In this table women with further acts of unprotected intercourse are still included.

2.3.4.1.   Body weight and pregnancy rate 
The pregnancy rates according to weight categories were separately presented for the three controlled 
studies (Table 9) and one open label study (Table 10). The data show that there seems to be a non-
significant trend for a higher pregnancy rate in the highest weight category, although the confidence 
limits are wide.

2.3.4.2.  BMI and pregnancy rate 
The pregnancy rates according to BMI categories were also separately presented for the three 
controlled studies and one open label study, as well as for all four studies combined.  
The data for the three controlled trials show that in the highest BMI category (BMI> 35) the pregnancy 
rate was the highest (3.54%), though the number of women in this category is low, and consequently 
confidence limits are wide (095% CI ;0.97-8.81). In the uncontrolled study the highest BMI category 
(BMI> 35) did not correspond to the highest pregnancy rate (2.30% for BMI>35, 3.70% for BMI 30-
35, 2.26% for BMI 25-30). 
The post-hoc subgroup analysis including all four studies (table 11) still shows that there might be a 
trend, although this trend is weaker than for the post-hoc subgroup analysis including only the three 
studies. The pregnancy rate in the highest BMI category (BMI> 30) was 2.57% while for the BMI 25-
30 category the pregnancy rate was 1.29%. In this analysis women with further acts of unprotected 
intercourse were excluded.

It can be concluded that the analyses for BMI with all four studies on UPA combined, suggest a trend 
for a higher pregnancy rate in the highest body weight category (≥ 95 kg) and BMI category  
(BMI ≥30).  
2.3.4.3.  Confounding factors 
Analyses were conducted to assess time-to-intake, ethnic group (white, Asian, black, other) as well as 
age (that can impact fertility) and country (EU/USA were the two main geographic regions) as possible 
confounders for the effect of weight/BMI on pregnancy risk in addition to further UPI and conception 
probability. The analysis was conducted on the primary efficacy population and also after excluding 
occurrence of further UPI. These analyses were conducted on all four studies (N=3337 and 53 
pregnancies). The analyses suggested that these factors did not lead to a significant contribution to the 
pregnancy risk. 
2.3.5.  Discussion 
Emergency contraceptives can be used to prevent an unintended pregnancy following an unprotected 
sexual intercourse or in case of failure of a contraceptive method. The emergency contraceptives can 
be divided into levonorgestrel (LNG)- and UPA-containing emergency contraceptives and they act by 
inhibiting and/or delaying ovulation. 
The use of emergency contraception is an occasional method that is far less effective compared with 
most contraceptive products used on a regular basis, e.g. combined hormonal contraceptives, 
gestagen-only pills and various long-acting methods like intra-uterine devices and implants.  
The CHMP reviewed all data from clinical studies, published literature, post-marketing experience, 
including responses submitted by the marketing authorisation holders (MAHs), on the efficacy of 
emergency contraceptive medicinal products containing LNG or UPA, in particular with regards to the 
relation of high weight/BMI of women. 
Levonorgestrel (LNG) 
There are limited and inconclusive data from clinical trials that evaluated the effect of high body 
weight/high BMI on the contraceptive efficacy. In the meta-analysis including the three WHO studies, 
primarily including African and Asian women, no trend for a reduced efficacy with increasing body 
weight/BMI was observed (Table 5 above). In contrast, in the two studies of Creinin and colleagues 
Assessment report  
EMA/464144/2014 
Page 17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2006) and Glasier and colleagues (2010), primarily including Caucasian women, reduced 
contraceptive efficacy was observed with increasing body weight or BMI (Table 6).  
Both meta-analyses excluded intake later than 72 hours after unprotected intercourse (i.e. off-label 
use of LNG) and women who had further acts of unprotected intercourse. 
The data are currently too limited and therefore insufficiently precise to draw definite conclusions 
whether efficacy is negatively influenced by increased body weight and BMI; for instance for the obese 
category (BMI ≥30) three pregnancies were reported in the first analysis, and eleven pregnancies in 
the second. It is unknown what the explanation is for the contradicting results in both meta-analyses. 
All together, the current data are considered not robust enough to support the current 
recommendation of decreased efficacy in women with body weight above 75 kg and inefficacy in 
women with body weight above 80 kg as is currently included in the product information of one LNG-
containing emergency contraceptive medicinal product (Norlevo).  
A range of different factors have an impact on a woman´s fertility and the ability of emergency 
contraceptives to prevent a pregnancy, e.g. timing of intake of emergency contraception in relation to 
intercourse, conception probability, further acts of unprotected intercourse, age, ethnicity, previous 
infections of the genital tract, fertility, male fertility, etc. This is reflected in the wide range of 
estimates of prevented fraction across different studies. Therefore, even if data from some studies 
suggest a lower ability of LNG-containing emergency contraceptives to prevent pregnancies in women 
of higher weight/BMI, this is only one factor influencing the effect and it is difficult to define a certain 
cut-off for weight/BMI at which no effect is present.  
The safety profile of LNG-containing emergency contraceptives remains favourable as this referral did 
not discuss any safety issues. 
Overall for LNG-containing emergency contraceptives it is concluded that there is limited and 
inconclusive data on the effect of high body weight/high BMI on the contraceptive efficacy.  
The CHMP proposed that a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC is appropriate to indicate that limited 
and inconclusive data are present regarding a possible reduced efficacy in women with a high body 
weight/BMI. Further, the data of the two meta-analyses should be presented in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC. This information should also be reflected in the package leaflet. Further, since the limited data 
available do not support with any certainty the conclusion that their contraceptive effect is reduced in 
women with high body weight, no adjustment of the dose is recommended, and any information that is 
already included in section 4.2 of the SmPC making reference to effect and body weight should be 
removed. The safety profile of LNG-containing emergency contraceptives remains favourable. 
The CHMP is of the opinion that further data is needed especially of pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic 
(PD/PK) nature in order to provide more information on the issue of high body weight/BMI and 
ovulation inhibition. Such study may have limitation especially in the clinical interpretation of the 
results. However, considering the large impact of any proof of decreased efficacy in obese women, it is 
strongly recommended to investigate the pharmacodynamic effect (ovulation inhibition) of LNG in 
obese women. 
Ulipristal acetate (UPA) 
The data used in the analyses of effect of UPA in relation to weight/BMI are partly based on the same 
studies two studies for LNG (as above), and another randomised controlled study (HRA2914-507, 
HRA2914-508, HRA2914-513) as well as an open label study (HRA2914-509). Similar analyses were 
performed. A trend was observed in the UPA group for increasing number of pregnancies with 
increasing weight or BMI, although not as strong as for LNG-containing emergency contraceptives.

However, the analyses are based on a limited number of women, especially in the highest body 
weight/BMI categories, which subsequently result in very wide and overlapping 95% confidence limits. 
While the analyses of data from the three randomised controlled trials in which 2,098 women received 
UPA indicate a weak effect of body weight or BMI on pregnancy rates, the open label study (n=1,241) 
indicated no such effect. From these data there is no clear indication of an effect of weight or BMI on 
efficacy in general, or specifically among overweight or obese women.  
The data are currently too limited and therefore insufficiently precise to draw definite conclusions 
whether efficacy is negatively influenced by increased body weight and BMI (see Table 11 above).  
However, the CHMP proposed that a warning is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC is appropriate to 
indicate that limited and inconclusive data are present regarding a possible reduced efficacy in women 
with a high body weight/BMI. Further, in all women emergency contraception should be taken as soon 
as possible after unprotected intercourse. Further, the data of the meta-analysis should be presented 
in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The safety profile of UPA-containing emergency contraceptives remains favourable as this referral did 
not discuss any safety issues. 
Conducting a pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic (PD/PK) study may provide more information on the 
issue of high body weight/BMI and ovulation inhibition. It is agreed that such a PD/PK study has 
limitations as the translation to clinical treatment recommendations may be difficult due to the high 
variability between women. However, considering the large impact of any proof of decreased efficacy in 
obese women, it is strongly recommended to investigate the pharmacodynamic effect (ovulation 
inhibition) of UPA in obese women, in the future. 
Conclusions 
For LNG-containing emergency contraceptives overall it is concluded that there is limited and 
inconsistent data on the effect of high body weight/high BMI on the contraceptive efficacy. In the three 
WHO studies (Von Hertzen et al., 1998 and 2002; Dada et al., 2010) no trend for a reduced efficacy 
with increasing body weight/BMI was observed, whereas in the two other studies (Creinin et al., 2006 
and Glasier et al., 2010) a reduced contraceptive efficacy was observed with increasing body weight or 
BMI. Both meta-analyses excluded off-label use of LNG-containing of emergency contraceptives, i.e. 
intake later than 72 hours after unprotected intercourse and women who had further acts of 
unprotected intercourse. 
For UPA-containing emergency contraceptive products (ellaOne) it is concluded that limited and 
inconclusive data suggest that there may be reduced efficacy of UPA with increased body weight in 
women. Further, in all women emergency contraception should be taken as soon as possible after 
unprotected intercourse. 
The CHMP also agreed that a further PK/PD study needs to be conducted for LNG- and UPA-containing 
emergency contraceptive medicinal products to provide more information on the issue of high body 
weight/BMI and ovulation inhibition. The CHMP recommended that the pharmacodynamic effect 
(ovulation inhibition) in obese women is investigated in the future.  
2.4.  Overall benefit/risk assessment 
The Committee concluded that the benefit-risk balance of emergency contraceptive medicinal products 
containing LNG or UPA remains positive, subject to the warnings and changes to the product 
information agreed.

2.5.  Communication plan 
The CHMP agreed that for LNG-containing emergency contraceptives only, and in view of the public 
interest on the issue assessed the national competent authorities of the MSs may decide to 
communicate on the outcome of this review at national level, owing to the differences in each national 
system and the legal status of each product (LNG is a prescription medicine in some MSs or distributed 
over-the-counter (OTC) in others). 
Routine communication to the public will be followed for ellaOne (UPA).

2.6.1.  Levonorgestrel 
A. Summary of product characteristics 
Section 4.2  Posology and methods of administration 
Any reference to weight and efficacy should be removed from this section as the data are inconsistent 
and inconclusive. 
Section 4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
A warning in this section of the SmPC is considered appropriate to indicate that inconclusive data are 
present regarding a possible reduced efficacy in women with a high body weight/BMI.  
Section 5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
The data of the two meta-analyses should be presented in this section of the SmPC.  
B. Package leaflet  
The package leaflet has been updated accordingly to include the information of the effect of 
weight/BMI to the efficacy of the products.

3.  Overall conclusion 
Having considered the overall submitted data provided by the MAHs in writing the CHMP concluded 
that the benefit-risk balance of emergency contraceptive medicinal products containing LNG or UPA 
remains positive for all women regardless of body weight/BMI, subject to the warnings and changes to 
the product information agreed. 
Therefore, the CHMP recommended the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the 
emergency contraceptive medicinal products containing LNG or UPA, for which the relevant sections of 
the summary of product characteristics, package leaflet are set out in the CHMP opinion. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation  
Whereas 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The Committee considered the procedure under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC for the 
emergency contraceptive medicinal products containing LNG or UPA. 
The Committee reviewed all data from clinical studies, published literature, post-marketing 
experience, including responses submitted by the marketing authorisation holders (MAHs), on 
the efficacy of emergency contraceptive medicinal products containing LNG or UPA, in 
particular with regards to a possible effect of high weight/BMI of women. 
The CHMP concluded that the available data is limited and does not support a definite 
conclusion that increased bodyweight reduces efficacy of emergency contraceptives medicinal 
products containing LNG or UPA. Available data should be included in the product information, 
but no restrictions of use based on body weight/BMI are recommended. 
The Committee considered that in view of the currently available data, the benefit-risk balance 
of emergency contraceptive medicinal products containing LNG or UPA is favourable, subject to 
warnings and other changes to the product information. In particular, the information that 
limited, but inconclusive data suggest that there may be reduced efficacy of these medicinal 
products with increased body weight in women. 
The Committee, as a consequence, concluded that the benefit-risk balance of emergency contraceptive 
medicinal products containing LNG or UPA remains positive, subject to the warnings and changes to 
the product information agreed.

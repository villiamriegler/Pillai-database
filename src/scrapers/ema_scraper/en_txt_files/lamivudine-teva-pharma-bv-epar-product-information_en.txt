CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. is indicated as part of antiretroviral combination therapy for the 
treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected adults and children. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
The therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. 
Lamivudine is also available as an oral solution for children over three months of age and who weigh 
less than 14 kg or for patients who are unable to swallow tablets (see section 4.4). 
Patients changing between lamivudine oral solution and lamivudine tablets should follow the dosing 
recommendations that are specific for the formulation (see section 5.2) 
Posology 
Adults, adolescents and children (weighing at least 25 kg) 
The recommended dose of lamivudine is 300 mg daily. This may be administered as either 150 mg 
twice daily or 300 mg once daily (see section 4.4). 
The 300 mg tablet is only suitable for the once a day regimen. 
Children (weighing less than 25 kg)

Dosing according to weight bands is recommended for Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. tablets. 
Children weighing ≥20 kg to <25 kg: The recommended dose is 225 mg daily. This may be 
administered as either 75 mg (one-half of a 150 mg tablet) taken in the morning and 150 mg (one 
whole 150 mg tablet) taken in the evening, or 225 mg (one and a half 150 mg tablets) taken once daily. 
Children weighing 14 kg to <20 kg: The recommended dose is 150 mg daily. This may be 
administered as 75 mg (one-half of a 150 mg tablet) taken twice daily, or 150 mg (one whole 150 mg 
tablet) taken once daily. 
Children from three months of age: As an accurate dosage cannot be achieved with the 300 mg non-
scored tablet formulation in this patient population, it is recommended that the Lamivudine Teva 
Pharma B.V. 150 mg scored tablet formulation is used and the corresponding recommended dosage 
instructions are followed. 
Children less than three months of age: The limited data available are insufficient to propose specific 
dosage recommendations (see section 5.2). 
Patients changing from the twice daily dosing regimen to the once daily dosing regimen should take 
the recommended once daily dose (as described above) approximately 12 hours after the last twice 
daily dose, and then continue to take the recommended once daily dose (as described above) 
approximately every 24 hours. When changing back to a twice daily regimen, patients should take the 
recommended twice daily dose approximately 24 hours after the last once daily dose. 
Special populations 
Older people: No specific data are available; however, special care is advised in this age group due to 
age-associated changes such as the decrease in renal function and alteration of haematological 
parameters. 
Renal impairment: Lamivudine concentrations are increased in patients with moderate - severe renal 
impairment due to decreased clearance. The dose should therefore be adjusted, using an oral solution 
presentation of lamivudine for patients whose creatinine clearance falls below 30 ml/min (see tables). 
Dosing recommendations – Adults, adolescents and children (weighing at least 25 kg): 
Creatinine clearance (ml/min)  First dose 
≥50 
30-<50 
<30 
15 to <30 
5 to <15 
<5 
Maintenance dose 
300 mg once daily 
or 
150 mg twice daily 
150 mg once daily 
300 mg 
or 
150 mg 
150 mg 
As doses below 150 mg are needed the use of 
an oral solution is recommended 
150 mg 
150 mg 
50 mg 
100 mg once daily 
50 mg once daily 
25 mg once daily 
There are no data available on the use of lamivudine in children with renal impairment. Based on the 
assumption that creatinine clearance and lamivudine clearance are correlated similarly in children as in 
adults it is recommended that the dosage in children with renal impairment be reduced according to 
their creatinine clearance by the same proportion as in adults. A 10 mg/mL oral solution may be the 
most appropriate formulation to achieve the recommended dose in children with renal impairment 
aged at least 3 months and weighing less than 25kg.

Hepatic impairment: Data obtained in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment shows that 
lamivudine pharmacokinetics are not significantly affected by hepatic dysfunction. Based on these 
data, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment unless 
accompanied by renal impairment. 
Method of administration 
Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. may be administered with or without food. 
To ensure the administration of the entire dose, the tablet(s) should ideally be swallowed without 
crushing. 
Alternatively, for patients who are unable to swallow tablets, the tablet(s) may be crushed and added 
to a small amount of semi-solid food or liquid, all of which should be consumed immediately (see 
section 5.2). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. is not recommended for use as monotherapy. 
Renal impairment: In patients with moderate to severe renal impairment, the terminal plasma half-life 
of lamivudine is increased due to decreased clearance; therefore the dose should be adjusted (see 
section 4.2). 
Triple nucleoside therapy: There have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of 
emergence of resistance at an early stage when lamivudine was combined with tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate and abacavir as well as with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine as a once daily 
regimen. 
Opportunistic infections: Patients receiving Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. or any other antiretroviral 
therapy may continue to develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection, 
and therefore should remain under close clinical observation by physicians experienced in the 
treatment of patients with associated HIV diseases. 
Pancreatitis: Cases of pancreatitis have occurred rarely. However, it is not clear whether these cases 
were due to the antiretroviral treatment or to the underlying HIV disease. Treatment with Lamivudine 
Teva Pharma B.V. should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms or laboratory 
abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero: Nucleoside and nucleotide analogues may 
impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most pronounced with stavudine, 
didanosine and zidovudine. There have been reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV-negative 
infants exposed in utero and/or post-natally to nucleoside analogues; these have predominantly 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine. The main adverse reactions reported are 
haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, 
hyperlipasemia). These events have often been transitory. Late-onset neurological disorders have been 
reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether such neurological disorders are 
transient or permanent is currently unknown. These findings should be considered for any child 
exposed in utero to nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, who presents with severe clinical findings of 
unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings. These findings do not affect current national 
recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission of 
HIV. 
Weight and metabolic parameters: An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may 
occur during antiretroviral therapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life 
style. For lipids, there is in some cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is 
no strong evidence relating this to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose 
reference is made to established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as 
clinically appropriate. 
Immune Reactivation Syndrome: In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time 
of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to 
asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or 
aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or 
months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or 
focal mycobacterium infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (often referred to as PCP). 
Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. 
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to 
occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and 
these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 
Liver disease: If lamivudine is being used concomitantly for the treatment of HIV and HBV, 
additional information relating to the use of lamivudine in the treatment of hepatitis B infection is 
available in the lamivudine 100 mg SmPC. 
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an 
increased risk of severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events. In case of concomitant antiviral 
therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal 
products. 
If Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. is discontinued in patients co-infected with hepatitis B virus, 
periodic monitoring of liver function tests and markers of HBV replication is recommended, as 
withdrawal of lamivudine may result in an acute exacerbation of hepatitis (see lamivudine 100 mg 
SmPC). 
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased 
frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy, and should be 
monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such 
patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered (see section 4.8). 
Paediatric population: In a study performed in paediatric patients (see section 5.1 ARROW study), 
lower rates of virologic suppression and more frequent viral resistance were reported in children 
receiving an oral solution of lamivudine as compared to those receiving the tablet formulation. 
Whenever possible in children, lamivudine as tablet formulation should preferably be used. 
Osteonecrosis: Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, 
alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis 
have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to 
combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they 
experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement. 
Drug Interactions: Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. should not be taken with any other medicinal 
products containing lamivudine or medicinal products containing emtricitabine (see section 4.5). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The combination of lamivudine with cladribine is not-recommended (see section 4.5). 
Excipient(s) 
Sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film-coated tablet, that is to say 
essentially “sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The likelihood of metabolic interactions is low due to limited metabolism and plasma protein binding 
and almost complete renal clearance. 
Administration of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160 mg/800 mg results in a 40% increase in 
lamivudine exposure, because of the trimethoprim component; the sulfamethoxazole component did 
not interact. However, unless the patient has renal impairment, no dosage adjustment of lamivudine is 
necessary (see section 4.2). Lamivudine has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim or 
sulfamethoxazole. When concomitant administration is warranted, patients should be monitored 
clinically. Co-administration of lamivudine with high doses of co-trimoxazole for the treatment of 
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and toxoplasmosis should be avoided. 
The possibility of interactions with other medicinal products administered concurrently should be 
considered, particularly when the main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic 
cationic transport system e.g. trimethoprim. Other medicinal products (e.g. ranitidine, cimetidine) are 
eliminated only in part by this mechanism and were shown not to interact with lamivudine. The 
nucleoside analogues (e.g. didanosine) like zidovudine, are not eliminated by this mechanism and are 
unlikely to interact with lamivudine. 
A modest increase in Cmax (28%) was observed for zidovudine when administered with lamivudine, 
however overall exposure (AUC) is not significantly altered. Zidovudine has no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of lamivudine (see section 5.2). 
Due to similarities, Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. should not be administered concomitantly with 
other cytidine analogues, such as emtricitabine. Moreover, Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. should not 
be taken with any other medicinal products containing lamivudine (see section 4.4). 
In vitro lamivudine inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of cladribine leading to a potential risk of 
cladribine loss of efficacy in case of combination in the clinical setting. Some clinical findings also 
support a possible interaction between lamivudine and cladribine. Therefore, the concomitant use of 
lamivudine with cladribine is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
Lamivudine metabolism does not involve CYP3A, making interactions with medicinal products 
metabolised by this system (e.g. PIs) unlikely. 
Coadministration of sorbitol solution (3.2 g, 10.2 g, 13.4 g) with a single 300 mg dose of lamivudine 
oral solution resulted in dose-dependent decreases of 14%, 32%, and 36% in lamivudine exposure 
(AUC∞) and 28%, 52%, and 55% in the Cmax of lamivudine in adults. When possible, avoid chronic 
coadministration of Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. with medicinal products containing sorbitol or 
other osmotic acting poly-alcohols or monosaccharide alcohols (e.g. xylitol, mannitol, lactitol, 
maltitol). Consider more frequent monitoring of HIV-1 viral load when chronic coadministration 
cannot be avoided. 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
As a general rule, when deciding to use antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection in 
pregnant women and consequently for reducing the risk of HIV vertical transmission to the newborn, 
the animal data as well as the clinical experience in pregnant women should be taken into account. 
Animal studies with lamivudine showed an increase in early embryonic deaths in rabbits but not in rats 
(see section 5.3). Placental transfer of lamivudine has been shown to occur in humans. 
More than 1000 outcomes from first trimester and more than 1000 outcomes from second and third 
trimester exposure in pregnant women indicate no malformative and foeto/neonatal effect. Lamivudine 
Teva Pharma B.V. can be used during pregnancy if clinically needed. The malformative risk is 
unlikely in humans based on those data. 
For patients co-infected with hepatitis who are being treated with lamivudine and subsequently 
become pregnant, consideration should be given to the possibility of a recurrence of hepatitis on 
discontinuation of lamivudine. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction: Nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have been demonstrated in vitro and 
in vivo to cause a variable degree of mitochondrial damage. There have been reports of mitochondrial 
dysfunction in infants exposed in utero and/or post-natally to nucleoside analogues (see section 4.4). 
Breast-feeding 
Following oral administration lamivudine was excreted in breast milk at similar concentrations to 
those found in serum. Based on more than 200 mother/child pairs treated for HIV, serum 
concentrations of lamivudine in breastfed infants of mothers treated for HIV are very low (<4% of 
maternal serum concentrations) and progressively decrease to undetectable levels when breastfed 
infants reach 24 weeks of age. There are no data available on the safety of lamivudine when 
administered to babies less than three months old. It is recommended that women living with HIV do 
not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid transmission of HIV. 
Fertility 
Studies in animals showed that lamivudine had no effect on fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
The following adverse reactions have been reported during therapy for HIV disease with lamivudine: 
The adverse reactions considered at least possibly related to the treatment are listed below by body 
system, organ class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥1/10), 
common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare 
(<1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing 
seriousness. 
Blood and lymphatic systems disorders 
Uncommon: Neutropenia and anaemia (both occasionally severe), thrombocytopenia. 
Very rare: Pure red cell aplasia. 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders 
Very rare: Lactic acidosis.

Nervous system disorders 
Common: Headache, insomnia. 
Very rare: Peripheral neuropathy (or paraesthesia). 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
Common: Cough, nasal symptoms. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Common: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or cramps, diarrhoea. 
Rare: Pancreatitis, elevations in serum amylase. 
Hepatobiliary disorders 
Uncommon: Transient elevations in liver enzymes (AST, ALT). 
Rare: Hepatitis. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Common: Rash, alopecia. 
Rare: Angioedema. 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
Common: Arthralgia, muscle disorders. 
Rare: Rhabdomyolysis. 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Common: Fatigue, malaise, fever. 
Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section 
4.4) 
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic 
infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have 
also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset 
is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). 
Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk 
factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term combined antiretroviral exposure (CART). The frequency 
of which is unknown (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
1206 HIV-infected paediatric patients aged 3 months to 17 years were enrolled in the ARROW Trial 
(COL105677), 669 of whom received abacavir and lamivudine either once or twice daily (see section 
5.1). No additional safety issues have been identified in paediatric subjects receiving either once or 
twice daily dosing compared to adults. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Administration of lamivudine at very high dose levels in acute animal studies did not result in any 
organ toxicity. No specific signs or symptoms have been identified following acute overdose with 
lamivudine, apart from those listed as undesirable effects. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If overdosage occurs the patient should be monitored, and standard supportive treatment applied as 
required. Since lamivudine is dialysable, continuous haemodialysis could be used in the treatment of 
overdosage, although this has not been studied.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: nucleoside analogue, ATC code: J05AF05. 
Mechanism of action 
Lamivudine is a nucleoside analogue which has activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
and hepatitis B virus (HBV). It is metabolised intracellularly to the active moiety, lamivudine 
5’-triphosphate. Its main mode of action is as a chain terminator of viral reverse transcription. The 
triphosphate has selective inhibitory activity against HIV-1 and HIV-2 replication in vitro, it is also 
active against zidovudine-resistant clinical isolates of HIV. No antagonistic effects in vitro were seen 
with lamivudine and other anti retrovirals (tested agents: abacavir, didanosine, nevirapine and 
zidovudine). 
Resistance 
HIV-1 resistance to lamivudine involves the development of a M184V amino acid change close to the 
active site of the viral reverse transcriptase (RT). This variant arises both in vitro and in HIV-1 
infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral therapy. M184V mutants display 
greatly reduced susceptibility to lamivudine and show diminished viral replicative capacity in vitro. In 
vitro studies indicate that zidovudine-resistant virus isolates can become zidovudine sensitive when 
they simultaneously acquire resistance to lamivudine. The clinical relevance of such findings remains, 
however, not well defined. 
In vitro data tend to suggest that the continuation of lamivudine in anti-retroviral regimen despite the 
development of M184V might provide residual anti-retroviral activity (likely through impaired viral 
fitness). The clinical relevance of these findings is not established. Indeed, the available clinical data 
are very limited and preclude any reliable conclusion in the field. In any case, initiation of susceptible 
NRTI’s should always be preferred to maintenance of lamivudine therapy. Therefore, maintaining 
lamivudine therapy despite emergence of M184V mutation should only be considered in cases where 
no other active NRTI’s are available. 
Cross-resistance conferred by the M184V RT is limited within the nucleoside inhibitor class of 
antiretroviral agents. Zidovudine and stavudine maintain their antiretroviral activities against 
lamivudine-resistant HIV-1. Abacavir maintains its antiretroviral activities against lamivudine-
resistant HIV-1 harbouring only the M184V mutation. The M184V RT mutant shows a <4-fold 
decrease in susceptibility to didanosine; the clinical significance of these findings is unknown. In vitro 
susceptibility testing has not been standardised and results may vary according to methodological 
factors. 
Lamivudine demonstrates low cytotoxicity to peripheral blood lymphocytes, to established 
lymphocyte and monocyte-macrophage cell lines, and to a variety of bone marrow progenitor cells in 
vitro. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
In clinical trials, lamivudine in combination with zidovudine has been shown to reduce HIV-1 viral 
load and increase CD4 cell count. Clinical end-point data indicate that lamivudine in combination with 
zidovudine, results in a significant reduction in the risk of disease progression and mortality. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Evidence from clinical studies shows that lamivudine plus zidovudine delays the emergence of 
zidovudine resistant isolates in individuals with no prior antiretroviral therapy. 
Lamivudine has been widely used as a component of antiretroviral combination therapy with other 
antiretroviral agents of the same class (NRTIs) or different classes (PIs, non-nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors). 
Clinical trial evidence from paediatric patients receiving lamivudine with other antiretroviral drugs 
(abacavir, nevirapine/efavirenz or zidovudine) has shown that the resistance profile observed in 
paediatric patients is similar to that observed in adults, in terms of the genotypic substitutions detected 
and their relative frequency. 
Children receiving lamivudine oral solution concomitantly with other antiretroviral oral solutions in 
clinical trials developed viral resistance more frequently than children receiving tablets (see the 
description of the clinical experience in paediatric population (ARROW study) and section 5.2). 
Multiple drug antiretroviral therapy containing lamivudine has been shown to be effective in 
antiretrovirally-naive patients as well as in patients presenting with viruses containing the M184V 
mutations.  
The relationship between in vitro susceptibility of HIV to lamivudine and clinical response to 
lamivudine-containing therapy remains under investigation. 
Lamivudine at a dose of 100 mg once daily has also been shown to be effective for the treatment of 
adult patients with chronic HBV infection (for details of clinical studies, see the prescribing 
information for lamivudine 100 mg). However, for the treatment of HIV infection only a 300 mg daily 
dose of lamivudine (in combination with other antiretroviral agents) has been shown to be efficacious. 
Lamivudine has not been specifically investigated in HIV patients co-infected with HBV. 
Once daily dosing (300 mg once a day): a clinical study has demonstrated the non-inferiority between 
lamivudine once a day and lamivudine twice a day containing regimens. These results were obtained 
in an antiretroviral naïve-population, primarily consisting of asymptomatic HIV infected patients 
(CDC stage A). 
Paediatric population: a randomised comparison of a regimen including once daily vs twice daily 
dosing of abacavir and lamivudine was undertaken within a randomised, multicentre, controlled study 
of HIV-infected, paediatric patients. 1206 paediatric patients aged 3 months to 17 years enrolled in the 
ARROW Trial (COL105677) and were dosed according to the weight-band dosing recommendations 
in the World Health Organisation treatment guidelines (Antiretroviral therapy of HIV infection in 
infants and children, 2006). After 36 weeks on a regimen including twice daily abacavir and 
lamivudine, 669 eligible subjects were randomised to either continue twice daily dosing or switch to 
once daily abacavir and lamivudine for at least 96 weeks. Of note, from this study clinical data were 
not available for children under one year old. The results are summarised in the table below:

In a pharmacokinetic study (PENTA 15), four virologically controlled subjects less than 12 months of 
age switched from abacavir plus lamivudine oral solution twice daily to a once daily regimen. Three 
subjects had undetectable viral load and one had plasmatic HIV-RNA of 900 copies/ml at Week 48. 
No safety concerns were observed in these subjects. 
The abacavir + lamivudine once daily dosing group was demonstrated to be non-inferior to the twice 
daily group according to the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -12%, for the primary endpoint of 
<80 c/mL at Week 48 as well as at Week 96 (secondary endpoint) and all other thresholds tested 
(<200 c/mL, <400 c/mL, <1000 c/mL), which all fell well within this non-inferiority margin. 
Subgroup analyses testing for heterogeneity of once vs twice daily demonstrated no significant effect 
of sex, age, or viral load at randomisation. Conclusions supported non-inferiority regardless of 
analysis method. 
At the time of randomization to once daily vs twice daily dosing (Week 0), those patients who had 
received tablet formulations had a higher rate of viral load suppression than those who had received 
any solution formulations at any time. These differences were observed in each different age group 
studied. This difference in suppression rates between tablets and solutions remained through Week 96 
with once daily dosing.

combination with other antiretroviral solutions, compared with those who received similar doses of

patients. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Lamivudine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and the bioavailability of oral lamivudine 
in adults is normally between 80 and 85%. Following oral administration, the mean time (tmax) to 
maximal serum concentrations (Cmax) is about an hour. Based on data derived from a study in healthy 
volunteers, at a therapeutic dose of 150 mg twice daily, mean (CV) steady-state Cmax and Cmin of 
lamivudine in plasma are 1.2 µg/ml (24%) and 0.09 µg/ml (27%), respectively. The mean (CV) AUC 
over a dosing interval of 12 hours is 4.7 µg•h/ml (18%). At a therapeutic dose of 300 mg once daily, 
the mean (CV) steady-state Cmax, Cmin and 24h AUC are 2.0 µg/ml (26%), 0.04 µg/ml (34%) and 
8.9 µg•h/ml (21%), respectively. 
The 150 mg tablet is bioequivalent and dose proportional to the 300 mg tablet with respect to AUC∞, 
Cmax, and tmax. Administration of lamivudine tablets is bioequivalent to lamivudine oral solution with 
respect to AUC∞ and Cmax in adults. Absorption differences have been observed between adult and 
paediatric populations (see “Special populations”). 
Co-administration of lamivudine with food results in a delay of tmax and a lower Cmax (decreased by 
47%). However, the extent (based on the AUC) of lamivudine absorbed is not influenced. 
Administration of crushed tablets with a small amount of semi-solid food or liquid would not be 
expected to have an impact on the pharmaceutical quality, and would therefore not be expected to alter 
the clinical effect. This conclusion is based on the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic data 
assuming that the patient crushes and transfers 100% of the tablet and ingests immediately. 
Co-administration of zidovudine results in a 13% increase in zidovudine exposure and a 28% increase 
in peak plasma levels. This is not considered to be of significance to patient safety and therefore no 
dosage adjustments are necessary. 
Distribution 
From intravenous studies, the mean volume of distribution is 1.3 l/kg. The mean systemic clearance of 
lamivudine is approximately 0.32 l/h/kg, with predominantly renal clearance (>70%) via the organic 
cationic transport system. 
Lamivudine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range and displays limited 
binding to the major plasma protein albumin (<16%-36% to serum albumin in in vitro studies). 
Limited data show that lamivudine penetrates the central nervous system and reaches the cerebro-
spinal fluid (CSF). The mean ratio CSF/serum lamivudine concentration 2-4 hours after oral 
administration was approximately 0.12. The true extent of penetration or relationship with any clinical 
efficacy is unknown. 
Biotransformation 
The plasma lamivudine half-life after oral dosing is 18 to 19 hours and the active moiety, intracellular 
lamivudine triphosphate, has a prolonged terminal half-life in the cell (16 to 19 hours). In 60 healthy 
adult volunteers, lamivudine 300 mg once daily has been demonstrated to be pharmacokinetically 
equivalent at steady-state to lamivudine 150 mg twice daily with respect to intracellular triphosphate 
AUC24 and Cmax. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lamivudine is predominately cleared unchanged by renal excretion. The likelihood of metabolic 
interactions of lamivudine with other medicinal products is low due to the small extent of hepatic 
metabolism (5-10%) and low plasma protein binding. 
Elimination 
Studies in patients with renal impairment show lamivudine elimination is affected by renal 
dysfunction. A recommended dosage regimen for patients with creatinine clearance below 50 ml/min 
is shown in the dosage section (see section 4.2). 
An interaction with trimethoprim, a constituent of co-trimoxazole, causes a 40% increase in 
lamivudine exposure at therapeutic doses. This does not require dose adjustment unless the patient 
also has renal impairment (see sections 4.5 and 4.2). Administration of co-trimoxazole with 
lamivudine in patients with renal impairment should be carefully assessed. 
Special populations 
Children: The absolute bioavailability of lamivudine (approximately 58-66%) was reduced in 
paediatric patients below 12 years of age. In children, administration of tablets given concomitantly 
with other antiretroviral tablets delivered higher plasma lamivudine AUC∞ and Cmax than oral solution 
given concomitantly with other antiretroviral oral solutions. Children receiving lamivudine oral 
solution according to the recommended dosage regimen achieve plasma lamivudine exposure within 
the range of values observed in adults. Children receiving lamivudine oral tablets according to the 
recommended dosage regimen achieve higher plasma lamivudine exposure than children receiving 
oral solution because higher mg/kg doses are administered with the tablet formulation and the tablet 
formulation has higher bioavailability (see section 4.2). Paediatric pharmacokinetic studies with both 
oral solution and tablet formulations have demonstrated that once daily dosing provides equivalent 
AUC0-24 to twice daily dosing of the same total daily dose. 
There are limited pharmacokinetic data for patients less than three months of age. In neonates one 
week of age, lamivudine oral clearance was reduced when compared to paediatric patients and is likely 
to be due to immature renal function and variable absorption. Therefore, to achieve similar adult and 
paediatric exposure, an appropriate dose for neonates is 4 mg/kg/day. Glomerular filtration estimates 
suggests that to achieve similar adult and paediatric exposure, an appropriate dose for children aged 
six weeks and older could be 8 mg/kg/day. 
Pharmacokinetic data were derived from 3 pharmacokinetic studies (PENTA 13, PENTA 15 and 
ARROW PK substudy) enrolling children under 12 years of age. The data are displayed in the table

In PENTA 15 study, the geometric mean plasma lamivudine AUC(0-24) (95% CI) of the four subjects 
under 12 months of age who switch from a twice daily to a once daily regimen (see section 5.1) are 
10.31 (6.26, 17.0) µg•h/mL in the once-daily dosing and 9.24 (4.66, 18.3) µg•h/mL in the twice-daily 
dosing. 
Pregnancy: Following oral administration, lamivudine pharmacokinetics in late-pregnancy were 
similar to non-pregnant women. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Administration of lamivudine in animal toxicity studies at high doses was not associated with any 
major organ toxicity. At the highest dosage levels, minor effects on indicators of liver and kidney 
function were seen together with occasional reductions in liver weight. The clinically relevant effects 
noted were a reduction in red blood cell count and neutropenia. 
Lamivudine was not mutagenic in bacterial tests but, like many nucleoside analogues, showed activity 
in an in vitro cytogenetic assay and the mouse lymphoma assay. Lamivudine was not genotoxic in vivo 
at doses that gave plasma concentrations around 40-50 times higher than the anticipated clinical 
plasma levels. As the in vitro mutagenic activity of lamivudine could not be confirmed in in vivo tests, 
it is concluded that lamivudine should not represent a genotoxic hazard to patients undergoing 
treatment. 
A transplacental genotoxicity study conducted in monkeys compared zidovudine alone with the 
combination of zidovudine and lamivudine at human-equivalent exposures. The study demonstrated 
that foetuses exposed in utero to the combination sustained a higher level of nucleoside analogue-
DNA incorporation into multiple foetal organs, and showed evidence of more telomere shortening 
than in those exposed to zidovudine alone. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 
The results of long-term carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice did not show any carcinogenic 
potential relevant for humans. 
A fertility study in rats has shown that lamivudine had no effect on male or female fertility.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. is and what it is used for 
Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. is used to treat HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection 
in adults and children. 
The active ingredient in Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. is lamivudine. Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. 
is a type of medicine known as an antiretroviral. It belongs to a group of medicines called nucleoside 
analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). 
Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. does not completely cure HIV infection; it reduces the amount of virus 
in your body, and keeps it at a low level. It also increases the CD4 cell count in your blood. CD4 cells 
are a type of white blood cells, that are important in helping your body to fight infection. 
Not everyone responds to treatment with Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. in the same way. Your doctor 
will monitor the effectiveness of your treatment. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. 
Do not take Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V.

Some people taking Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. or other combination treatments for HIV are more 
at risk of serious side effects. You need to be aware of the extra risks: 
• 
if you have ever had liver disease, including hepatitis B or C (if you have hepatitis B infection, 
do not stop Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. without your doctor’s advice, as your hepatitis may 
come back) 
if you are seriously overweight (especially if you are a woman) 
if you or your child has a kidney problem, your dose may be altered. 
• 
• 
Talk to your doctor if any of these apply to you. You may need extra check-ups, including blood 
tests, while you are taking your medicine. See section 4 for more information. 
Look out for important symptoms 
Some people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious. You 
need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you are taking Lamivudine 
Teva Pharma B.V.. 
Read the information ‘Other possible side effects of combination therapy for HIV’ in section 4 of 
this leaflet.

passed on to the baby in breast milk.

Other possible side effects of combination therapy for HIV 
Combination therapy including Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. may cause other conditions to develop 
during HIV treatment. 
Old infections may flare up 
People with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems and are more likely to 
develop serious infections (opportunistic infections). When these people start treatment, they may find 
that old, hidden infections flare up, causing signs and symptoms of inflammation. These symptoms are 
probably caused by the body’s immune system becoming stronger, so that the body starts to fight these 
infections. 
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the 
immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the 
treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of 
treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, 
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, 
tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. 
If you get any symptoms of infection while you are taking Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V.: 
Tell your doctor immediately. Do not take other medicines for the infection without your doctor’s 
advice. 
if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time 
if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids 
if they drink alcohol 
if their immune systems are very weak 
if they are overweight. 
You may have problems with your bones 
Some people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this 
condition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. People may be 
more likely to get this condition: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Signs of osteonecrosis include: 
• 
stiffness in the joints 
• 
aches and pains (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) 
• 
difficulty moving. 
If you notice any of these symptoms: Tell your doctor. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety 
of this medicine.

medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. 
When you are being treated for HIV, it can be hard to tell whether a symptom is a side effect of 
Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V. or other medicines you are taking, or an effect of the HIV disease 
itself. So it is very important to talk to your doctor about any changes in your health. 
As well as the side effects listed below for Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V., other conditions can 
develop during combination therapy for HIV.

Old infections may flare up 
People with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems and are more likely to 
develop serious infections (opportunistic infections). When these people start treatment, they may find 
that old, hidden infections flare up, causing signs and symptoms of inflammation. These symptoms are 
probably caused by the body’s immune system becoming stronger, so that the body starts to fight these 
infections. 
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the 
immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the 
treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of 
treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, 
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, 
tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. 
If you get any symptoms of infection while you are taking Lamivudine Teva Pharma B.V.: 
Tell your doctor immediately. Do not take other medicines for the infection without your doctor’s 
advice. 
if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time 
if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids 
if they drink alcohol 
if their immune systems are very weak 
if they are overweight. 
You may have problems with your bones 
Some people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this 
condition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. People may be 
more likely to get this condition: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Signs of osteonecrosis include: 
• 
stiffness in the joints 
• 
aches and pains (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) 
•

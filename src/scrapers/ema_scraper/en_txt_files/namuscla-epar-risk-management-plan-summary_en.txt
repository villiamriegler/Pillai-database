Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Namuscla (Mexiletine hydrochloride) 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  Namuscla.  The  RMP  details 
important risks of Namuscla, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about Namuscla's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Namuscla's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Namuscla should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Namuscla should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
Namuscla's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Namuscla is authorised for the symptomatic treatment of myotonia in adult patients with non-
dystrophic myotonic disorders. It contains mexiletine hydrochloride as the active substance 
and it is given orally. 
Further information about the evaluation of Namuscla’s benefits can be found in Namuscla 
EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the 
medicine’s webpage  https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/namuscla. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise 
the risks  
Important  risks  of  Namuscla,  together  with  measures  to  minimise  such  risks  are  outlined 
below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products include: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Namuscla, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken 
as  necessary.  These  measures  constitute  routine  pharmacovigilance  activities.  Periodic 
update on data collection will be provided in Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs). 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Namuscla is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Namuscla are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there 
is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Namuscla. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association  with  the  use  of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Mexiletine 
in  patients  with  known 
hypersensitivity to mexiletine, or to any of the excipients or 
to any local anaesthetic as there is possibility of occurrence 
of  potentially  lethal  severe  cutaneous  adverse  reactions, 
usually  severe  cutaneous  eruption  along  with 
fever, 
lymphadenopathy,  hypereosinophilia, 
lymphocytosis  or 
organ damage (notably liver and kidney).

Cardiac arrhythmia 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Mexiletine is a class I b antiarrhythmic drug according to the 
Vaughan Williams classification, and as such, it may induce 
an arrhythmia or accentuate a pre-existing arrhythmia, either 
diagnosed  or  undiagnosed.  Mexiletine  should  be 
administered  with  caution  in  patients  with  pre-existing 
cardiac conduction anomalies. The advent (under mexiletine 
therapy) of an atrioventricular block, a permanent complete 
heart block, or a sinoatrial block necessitates the interruption 
of the mexiletine treatment. 
Patients with Dystrophic myotonia and patients with existing 
conduction  abnormalities  will  be  at  a  risk  of  developing 
cardiac arrhythmias. Mexiletine should be administered with 
caution  in  patients  with  pre-existing  cardiac  conduction 
anomalies.  The  benefit-risk  ratio needs  to  be  assessed  on 
case  by  case basis for the  benefit  on the  myotonia versus 
the  risk  of  rhythm  complication.  The  concomitant  use  of 
mexiletine  and  antiarrhythmic  drug  inducing  torsade  de 
pointes  is  contraindicated.  Co-administration  of  hepatic 
enzymes  (CYP1A2  and  CYP2D6)  inhibitors  (such  as 
ciprofloxacin,  fluvoxamine,  propafenone  or  quinidine)  may 
significantly  increase  mexiletine  exposure  and  thus  the 
associated risk of side effects of mexiletine.

Additional 
pharmacovigilance activities 
Risk of toxicity of CYP1A2 substrates with narrow therapeutic window such as 
theophylline, caffeine or tizanidine 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Mexiletine  is  a  potent  inhibitor  of  CYP1A2;  therefore,  co-
administration  of  mexiletine  with  a  medicinal  product 
metabolised  by  CYP1A2  (such as theophylline, caffeine  or 
tizanidine)  may  be  associated  with  elevations  in  plasma 
concentrations  of  the  concomitant  medicine  that  could 
increase or prolong the therapeutic efficacy and/or adverse 
events,  especially 
is  co-administered 
if  mexiletine 
withCYP1A2 substrate with narrow therapeutic window. 
During  the  treatment  with  mexiletine  patient  might  require 
treatment  other  concomitant  medications  and  they  can 
inform 
their  healthcare  professionals  about  ongoing 
treatment  with  mexiletine  before  starting  any  other 
medication.  Increased  concentrations  of  caffeine  occurring 
with the co-administration of mexiletine may be of concern 
in  patients  with  cardiac  arrhythmia.    It  is,  therefore, 
recommended  to  reduce  caffeine  intake  during  treatment 
with mexiletine.

Risk of decreased mexiletine clearance and thus associated risk of adverse 
reactions of mexiletine in patients with hepatic impairment 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Mexiletine  is  mainly  (90%)  metabolized  in  the  liver,  the 
primary pathway being CYP2D6 metabolism, although it is 
also a substrate for CYP1A2. In severe hepatic impairment 
such  as  liver  cirrhosis  total  clearance  was  diminished  by 
approximately  4  times  which  can  lead  to  considerable 
increase in plasma levels of Mexiletine and associated risk 
of side effects of mexiletine.  
Mexiletine should be used with caution in patients with mild 
or  moderate  hepatic  impairment.  In  these  patients,  it  is 
recommended that the dose should only be increased after 
at least 2 weeks of treatment. Mexiletine should not be used 
in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

Increased frequency of seizure episodes in patients with epilepsy 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Common elements of pathogenesis create a basis for the 
assumption that antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) may affect 
seizure phenomena and interact with antiepileptic drugs 
(AEDs). 
Risk factors and risk groups  Patients with known history of epilepsy and on antiepileptic 
drugs (AEDs).

Off-label use in children 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Non-dystrophic myotonic disorders are congenital, and their 
onset may occur at all ages, including infancy, childhood 
and adolescence. Therefore, the possibility of off-label use 
in the paediatric population cannot be excluded. 
Risk factors and risk groups  Children presenting early with myotonic symptoms may be 
at risk of off-label use as paediatric clinicians may want to 
use mexiletine in the paediatric population (children and 
adolescent aged 0 to 18 years). 
Risk minimisation measures  Routine risk minimisation measures:

Off-label use in DM1 and DM2 patients 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Given  that  Mexiletine  is  already  approved  for  symptomatic 
management  of  myotonia  in  DM1  and  DM2  in  France  and 
the pharmacological properties of mexiletine, the possibility 
of  off-label  use  in  DM1  and  DM2  patients  cannot  be 
excluded. Mexiletine is already being used in DM1 and DM2 
patients. 
1)  There is currently no symptomatic treatment for 
Risk factors and risk groups 
myotonia in DM1 and DM2 patients in Europe, hence 
clinicians may consider Namuscla as a treatment 
option. 
2) DM1 and DM2 patients primarily presenting with 
myotonias.

II.C Post-authorisation development plan 
II.C.1 Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation. 
There are no studies which are conditions to the marketing authorisation or specific obligation 
of Namuscla. 
II.C.2 Other studies in post-authorisation development plan 
PASS - LUP/MEX/2018/001 
Purpose of the study: To date, randomised studies conducted for mexiletine have assessed 
only  short-term  efficacy  and  safety  data  with  little  supporting  data  for  long-term  use  from 
observational research. 
This non-interventional study will collect data on the long-term (12 months to 3 years) safety 
of Namuscla in a real-world setting.

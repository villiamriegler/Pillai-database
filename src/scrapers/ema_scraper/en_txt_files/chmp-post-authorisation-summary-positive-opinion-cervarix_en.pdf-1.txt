Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Cervarix 
human papillomavirus vaccine [types 16, 18] (recombinant, adjuvanted, 
adsorbed) 
On 23 June 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Cervarix. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication as follows 2: 
Cervarix is a vaccine for use from the age of 9 years for the prevention of premalignant ano-
genital lesions (cervical, vulvar, and vaginal and anal) lesions and cervical and anal cancers 
causally related to certain oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types.  
For information, the full indications for Cervarix will be as follows: 
"Cervarix is a vaccine for use from the age of 9 years for the prevention of premalignant ano-
genital lesions (cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal) and cervical and anal cancers causally related 
to certain oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types. See sections 4.4 and 5.1 for important 
information on the data that support this indication.  
The use of Cervarix should be in accordance with official recommendations." 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

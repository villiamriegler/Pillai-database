1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

years old for Veltassa based on final results from 
paediatric study RLY5016-206P (EMERALD); this is a 
phase 2, open-label, multiple dose study to evaluate 
the pharmacodynamic effects, safety, and tolerability 
of patiromer for oral suspension in children and 
adolescents 2 to less than 18 years of age with 
chronic kidney disease and hyperkalaemia. As a 
consequence, sections 1, 2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 
4.9, 5.1 and 6.5 of the SmPC are updated. The 
Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated in 
accordance. Version 2.3 of the RMP has also been 
submitted. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity 
to introduce editorial changes.

wording amendment. Section 4.5 of the SmPC was updated 
with a list of medicinal products which did not demonstrate 
a binding potential in vitro. The advice that administration 
of patiromer should be separated by at least 3 hours from 
other oral medicinal products was maintained in the 
absence of clinical data to support. The MAH has also 
submitted an amended Package Leaflet to align the 
information with that in the SmPC.

endpoint, the proportion of subjects remaining on 
spironolactone at Week 12, was significantly higher

the placebo group (66.2%). Significantly more patients 
received spironolactone 50 mg/day (69.4% versus 51.4%). 
At Week 12, the mean systolic blood pressure had 
decreased by 11.0 mmHg (SD 15.34) in the spironolactone

receiving RAAS inhibitor therapy with CKD, diabetes

Section 4.5 was updated to reflect that as patiromer is not

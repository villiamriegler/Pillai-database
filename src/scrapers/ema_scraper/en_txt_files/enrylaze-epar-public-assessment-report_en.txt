Appendix on similarity) 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed target indication for this marketing authorisation is: 
‘Enrylaze is indicated as a component of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of 
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) in adult and paediatric 
patients who developed hypersensitivity or silent inactivation to E. coli-derived asparaginase. 
Enrylaze is indicated in patients 1 month of age and older.’ 
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) are a group of rare 
malignancies arising from precursor B cells (B-ALL/B-LBL), T cells (T-ALL/T-LBL), or both B and T cells 
(mixed lineage ALL/LBL).  
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia occurs upon a malignant transformation and proliferation of immature 
lymphoid cells in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and other organs. Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a 
rare, fast-growing, aggressive subtype of NHL, most often seen in teenagers and young adults. 
Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a cancer of immature lymphoblasts. 
The 2008 and 2016 WHO classifications of lymphoid malignancies define B-ALL/B-LBL and T-ALL/T-LBL 
as single disease entities, categorised as leukaemia if there is extensive blood and marrow 
involvement, lymphoma if the process is confined to a mass lesion with no or minimal blood/marrow 
involvement, and leukaemia/lymphoma if both are present. ALL and LBL are similar in appearance and 
behaviour and both require intensive treatment. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma (ALL/LBL) is the most common form of cancer in children, 
comprising approximately 30 percent of all childhood malignancies. The estimated global incidence of 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 9/83 
 
  
 
 
 
ALL is 5.91 new cases per 100,000 or 153,315 cases in 2019. In Europe, the overall incidence of ALL is 
11 per million per year, but the incidence peaks in childhood between 2 and 5 years of age (53 per 
million) and again after 50 years of age. Specifically, the median age at diagnosis for ALL is 15 years, 
with 55.4% of patients diagnosed at < 20 years of age. Approximately 12.3% of patients are 
diagnosed at ≥ 65 years. Lymphoblastic lymphoma is most often seen in teenagers and young adults. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
The vast majority of cases of ALL/LBL have no known cause, but an increased incidence has been 
associated with certain environmental or genetic risk factors. These include age, exposure to 
chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and genetic disorders, including Down’s syndrome. Approximately 
75% of patients with B-ALL have recurrent chromosomal translocations or somatic aneuploidy, many of 
which have prognostic value. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
Clinical manifestations at presentation include constitutional symptoms (fevers, night sweats, weight 
loss), easy bruising or bleeding, dyspnoea, dizziness, and infection. Symptoms of haematological 
insufficiency, such as anaemia, granulocytopenia or thrombocytopenia, are common. More children 
than adults present with extramedullary disease, specifically in CNS and testis. Less than 10% of 
paediatric patients have symptomatic CNS involvement, although the frequency is higher in patients 
with mature B-ALL. 
Survival rates for ALL/LBL in children have improved dramatically since the 1980s, with current five-
year overall survival rates >85 percent. Five-year event-free survival rates are >93 percent for low-
risk groups. Five-year OS decreases by age from 60% for young adults to 20% for adults over 65 
years.  
2.1.5.  Management 
In the EU, the majority of patients diagnosed with ALL and LBL follow a standard treatment protocol in 
which E. coli-derived L-asparaginase is an important component of first line therapy.  
There are currently three preparations of asparaginase for use in patients with ALL/LBL:  
-  Short-acting E. coli derived L-asparaginase  
- 
Long-acting pegylated (PEG)-asparginase, E. coli derived  
-  Short-acting Erwinia chrysanthemi L-asparaginase (crisantaspase) indicated for patients who 
develop a hypersensitivity reaction to E. coli-derived asparaginases  
All three asparaginases share the same mechanism of action, the depletion of asparagine, yet differ in 
their pharmacokinetics. These differences have implications regarding the appropriate dose, schedule, 
and the interpretation of asparaginase activity measurements. 
Because of their bacterial origin, L-asparaginases are allergenic and immunogenic. The most common 
toxicity of E. coli-derived L-asparaginases is hypersensitivity, which can manifest as allergic reactions 
or as “silent inactivation.” Clinically evident allergic reactions are reported in up to one-third of patients 
receiving intensive schedules of the native forms of the enzyme and less frequently in patients 
receiving the pegylated form of asparaginase.  
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 10/83 
 
  
 
 
Switching patients who develop clinical hypersensitivity or silent inactivation to E. coli-derived 
asparaginase to alternative non-E. coli-derived preparation (e.g. Erwinase) can maintain survival 
benefits when adequate asparagine depletion is achieved. However, since 2016, there has been a 
worldwide shortage of Erwinase due to ongoing manufacturing issues. 
While the absolute number of patients with hypersensitivity or silent inactivation to an E. coli-derived 
asparaginase is likely decreasing due to the predominant use of PEG asparaginase in frontline 
treatment and knowing that hypersensitivity rates to PEG asparaginase is lower than reported for 
native E. coli asparaginase, an unmet need remains for a reliable immunologically distinct L-
asparaginase product that will allow patients to continue and complete prescribed treatment.  
2.2.  About the product 
Enrylaze (also referred to in this report as JZP-458 or RC-P) was developed to overcome the shortage 
of the native Erwinia asparaginase crisantaspase, and is a new recombinant form of crisantaspase 
produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens. The applicant claims that the structure, stability and activity of 
Enrylaze are highly similar to native Erwinia asparaginase. 
Asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi (recombinant) is an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of the 
amino acid L-asparagine into L-aspartic acid and ammonia. The mechanism of action is based on the 
inability of leukaemic cells to synthesise asparagine due to lack of asparagine synthetase activity, 
resulting in cytotoxicity specific for leukaemic cells that rely on exogenous asparagine for their protein 
metabolism and survival.   
2.3.  Quality aspects 
1.1.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a sterile, single-use, preservative-free, aqueous solution for 
intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) administration containing 20 mg of crisantaspase per mL (10 
mg per vial) as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: trehalose dihydrate, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide, disodium phosphate, 
sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate, polysorbate 80 and water for injection. 
The product is available in a 2 mL Type 1 clear borosilicate glass vial, sealed with a halobutyl rubber 
stopper and aluminium overseal, and a violet plastic cap. 
1.1.2.  Active substance 
 General Information 
The active substance is an asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi produced by recombinant DNA 
technology in Pseudomonas fluorescens and developed by Jazz Pharmaceuticals. The INN of the active 
substance is crisantaspase, but is also referred to as JZP-458 or RC-P. The crisantaspase structure is a 
non-disulfide bonded, tetrameric protein consisting of 4 identical subunits with a combined molecular 
weight of 140 kDa.  
EMA/429470/2023

Table 1. General properties of crisantaspase 
 Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
The active substance is manufactured, tested and released at the following facilities, in accordance 
with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). The site responsible for the manufacture of crisantaspase is 
AGC Biologics A/S (legal name CMC Biologics, Inc.), Vandtaarnsvej 83B Soeborg, Copenhagen DK-
2860, Denmark. 
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
The active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described. 
Crisantaspase is produced as an intracellular product in a Pseudomonas fluorescens host. The 
upstream production process is started from a single cGMP working cell bank (WCB) vial and expanded 
in shake flasks. The shake flasks are incubated until a target cell density is achieved to be used as 
inoculum for the bioreactor operated in batch mode. A chemically defined medium is used in the 
production reactor. Expression of the plasmid gene encoding for the crisantaspase active substance is 
achieved through induction. Following induction, the culture is incubated until a target cell density is 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 12/83 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
achieved. The cells are then harvested by centrifugation and resuspended resulting in a wet cell paste 
that is prepared for downstream purification.  
The harvested cell paste is mechanically lysed through a homogeniser to release the product. The 
homogenised cells are clarified by centrifugation and depth filtration prior to a series of 
chromatography steps to purify the product. An ultrafiltration and diafiltration (UF/DF) step is 
performed to concentrate and formulate the product in a buffer at pH 7.0. Final excipients are added to 
formulate the active substance in the final formulation step. 
The maximum hold times at ambient conditions (17-25°C) for active substance intermediates have 
been justified by a stability assessment. Microbial control limits are in place for the upstream process 
and downstream in-process intermediates are tested (pre-filtration) for bioburden and bacterial 
endotoxins. Chromatography resins used for the chromatography steps to purify the product are each 
qualified for multiple cycles, while all membranes and filters are single use. Process parameter (PP) 
ranges and in-process controls (IPCs), along with acceptance criteria, are defined and justified as part 
of the overall control strategy.  
A lot of crisantaspase active substance is derived from a single WCB vial, a single production reactor 
and a single downstream purification. The active substance batch scale is defined by the batch 
fermentation step. Sufficient details on the container closure system (CCS), including materials, 
dimensions and technical drawings are provided in the dossier. The CCS is gamma irradiated for 
sterility by the vendor and the vendor also confirms the seal integrity. No additional Quality Control 
(QC) testing is performed on the bottles. This is acceptable. Compliance of the materials with the 
Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) note for guidance has been provided. Extractables 
and leachables studies concerning the active substance manufacturing process and have identified two 
substances of interest for which the levels are well below the acceptable limits.  
Overall, the active substance manufacturing process is considered acceptable. 
Control of materials 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted. Raw materials used are either of compendial grade or controlled to ensure the quality and 
safety of the active substance, and to maintain the consistency of the manufacturing process. The 
materials are animal and human component free. Acceptable documents have been provided for raw 
materials of biological origin used in the establishment of cell substrate. 
The recombinant crisantaspase expression strain was generated by transformation by electroporation 
of the expression plasmid into a Pseudomonas fluorescens host cell.  
A research cell bank (RCB) of the cell line was created. The master cell bank (MCB) and WCB were 
manufactured in accordance with GMP. No materials of animal or human origin were used in the 
preparation of the RCB, MCB or WCB. All batches manufactured to date have used the WCB. Cell bank 
testing is performed according to the relevant ICH guidelines. An End of Production (EoP) bank was 
created from a GMP fermentation at the intended commercial scale and tests confirmed the plasmid to 
be fully retained at the end of production, with no structural or sequence modifications detected. The 
MCB will be monitored every 5 years for cell growth and viability, while monitoring of the WCB stability 
includes crisantaspase production and will be performed annually. A protocol for the generation and 
qualification of future WCBs has been presented and found adequate.  
In conclusion, sufficient information is provided regarding testing of MCB and WCB and release of 
future WCBs. Genetic stability has been demonstrated for cells at and beyond the limit of cell age.

Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Acceptable information has been provided on the control system in place to monitor and control the 
active substance manufacturing process with regard to critical, as well as non-critical operational 
parameters and in-process tests. Excursions from a process parameter (PP), normal operating ranges 
(NORs) or in-process test limits is managed through the deviation programme. No rejection limits are 
defined. The process steps for which critical process parameters (CPPs) are identified are defined as 
critical unit operations. A critical unit operation is considered to be any operation that has been 
determined to have a potential impact on one or more critical quality attributes (CQAs). NORs are 
defined for CPPs, but also for all key and non-critical process parameters (KPPs and NCPPs), and limits 
are defined for in-process controls (IPCs) and in-process monitoring (IPMs - attributes that have been 
evaluated to give supportive information about process performance). It is noted that CQAs are 
controlled by analytical methods at active substance level and viral safety is not of any concern given 
that the cell line is not of human or animal origin.  
The overall control strategy is generally considered adequate for control of the crisantaspase 
manufacturing process.  
Process validation 
The process validation (PV) strategy for the crisantaspase manufacturing process encompasses three 
stages: process design, process performance qualification (PPQ) and continued process verification 
(CPV). During process design, supportive validation studies were performed and process relationships 
critical to the CQAs of the active substance and finished product were identified. The investigated CQAs 
include parameters for purity, product-related substances, product- and process-related impurities, 
and formulation related quality attributes. The available knowledge for each attribute was compiled 
and then each attribute was assigned as critical or non-critical. The set of supportive validation studies 
includes, but is not limited to, studies with regard to: cleaning and sterilisation, resin life time, 
shipping, in-process hold, process solutions and media hold, mixing and impurity clearance. The 
information presented is sufficient and considered acceptable. 
The PPQ campaign consisted of full-scale active substance batches manufactured at set-point 
conditions. The PPQ protocols included prospectively defined acceptance criteria consisting of numerical 
limits for process parameters and process controls. Any excursions from the pre-defined NORs were 
evaluated to have no impact on product quality. All PPQ lots met the proposed commercial active 
substance release specification acceptance criteria and demonstrated consistent performance of the 
manufacturing process. During PV, process parameters that were designated as potential CPPs (pCPPs) 
were given a final criticality designation. A selection of raw material parameters and process 
parameters will be monitored for CPV.  
In conclusion, sufficient information on process validation has been presented and the active substance 
manufacturing process is considered adequately validated, demonstrating that it can consistently 
produce crisantaspase of reproducible quality that complies with the predetermined specification and 
in-process acceptance criteria. 
Manufacturing process development 
The active substance manufacturing process was initially developed using small-scale runs. The 
process was transferred to AGC Biologics and scaled up, while processing steps remained the same. 
Analytical comparability between material manufactured by the small-scale and full-scale processes 
has been demonstrated. The full-scale process at AGC Biologics was used to manufacture the active 
substance for non-clinical and clinical use and is the intended commercial process. No major changes 
to unit operations were implemented throughout the development of the manufacturing process at 
AGC Biologics.  
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 14/83 
 
  
 
 
A bridging analytical comparability study was also performed to compare Enrylaze and Erwinase (a 
non-centrally authorised product containing the same active substance) in order to justify leveraging 
bibliographic literature on Erwinase for the replacement of own non-clinical and clinical study results. 
Comparable results were obtained for both materials. 
Characterisation 
Characterisation of crisantaspase active substance was performed to provide a comprehensive 
understanding of the biochemical, biophysical and biological properties of the protein, allowing a 
precise description of its quality attributes. State-of-the-art methods were used to evaluate the 
properties that relate to the molecular size distribution, post-translational modifications, hydrophobic 
heterogeneity, charge heterogeneity, molecular primary, secondary, tertiary and higher order 
structures, enzyme activity and kinetics, and thermal stability. The biological activity of crisantaspase 
is directly related to its enzymatic activity and ability to hydrolyze L-Asparagine. The analytical results 
are consistent with the proposed structure. 
Furthermore, heterogeneity of the active substance was adequately characterised as well. Product-
related variants, i.e. structural variants of the desired product, were isolated and identified as product-
related substances or product-related impurities, based on their similarity to the main species in terms 
of their structure, size, hydrophobic properties, conformation and potency. Process-related impurities 
derived from or introduced during the manufacturing process were identified and evaluated for their 
toxicity risk with consideration of the maximum dose.  
In summary, the characterisation is considered appropriate for this type of molecule. 
 Specification 
Identity, quality and purity of each batch of crisantaspase active substance are assessed and confirmed 
according to the proposed specification provided in the dossier. The following tests are included in the 
active substance specification: general tests, identity, protein concentration, purity, potency and safety 
parameters.  
Tests were selected based on a detailed understanding of the CQAs for crisantaspase active substance. 
The active substance specification does not include tests for several process-related and product-
related impurities, for which the applicant provided an adequate justification. This approach is 
endorsed.  
During the assessment, tightening of acceptance criteria for several quality attributes (i.e. colour, 
osmolality, purity, specific activity, bacterial endotoxins and residual HCP) and introduction of a 
stressed sample test (see Stability section below) were requested. The panel of tests is considered 
approvable, however the applicant was asked to commit to re-evaluate the requirement to conduct the 
stressed sample test as a routine test for active substance release when data from a sufficient number 
of batches are available (Recommendation).  
The specification was established based on regulatory guidelines, analytical capability, process 
capability and experience. A sufficient number of full-scale batches have been taken into consideration 
for specification setting for the active substance and justification. All batches were made with the same 
manufacturing process, to the same scale, including clinical and PPQ batches. Where possible, data 
sets have been supplemented with small-scale batches for statistical assessment.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described. Method descriptions for all non-
compendial analytical procedures are provided and validations are performed according to ICH Q2(R1). 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 15/83 
 
  
 
 
The compendial methods have been verified to demonstrate the suitability for the intended purpose. 
Biological activity is analysed by assays that monitor the conversion of asparagine to aspartic acid and 
ammonia. To assure method validity and to comply with GMP requirements with respect to trending, 
the applicant was asked to commit to include additional controls for the test method for determination 
of catalytic efficiency (Recommendation).  
The applicant was also asked to commit to perform a supplemental validation of the analytical method 
for Protein Concentration, as well as to perform an evaluation of a potential potency assay method 
optimisation (Recommendations). 
The applicant was further asked to commit to develop a new HCP test method or, alternatively, to 
revalidate the current HCP method as recommended in Ph. Eur. 2.6.34 (Recommendation). 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data (including PPQ batches and development batches) of the active substance were 
provided. All batch analysis data were in line with the acceptance criteria that applied at the time of 
testing. The results for batch release demonstrate a high level of batch-to-batch consistency.  
Reference materials 
The crisantaspase reference standards (RSs) follow a two-tiered approach with a primary RS and a 
working RS (WRS), where the PRS is used to (re)qualify (new) WRSs. The RSs are adequately qualified 
and considered representative of the commercial product. WRSs are requalified annually, while PRSs 
will be qualified annually for three years and every two years thereafter. Protocols for (re)qualification 
are provided. The information is considered acceptable. 
 Stability 
The proposed shelf-life for the active substance is 36 months at -20°C ± 5°C. Stability studies are 
being conducted on all full-scale active substance batches manufactured to date, in accordance with 
ICH stability guidelines. The shelf-life specifications are identical with release specification, with the 
exception of: identity, potency, bioburden, bacterial endotoxins, residual HCP and residual DNA, which 
are tested only at release. The stability studies are performed using containers from the same material 
as the active substance CCS, although it is from a different supplier, which is acceptable. At the 
proposed long-term storage conditions (-20°C ± 5°C), the stability-indicating parameters showed no 
significant effect for up to 36 months. In addition, both active substance and finished product are 
identical in terms of concentration and formulation. The long-term finished product storage 
temperature of 2-8°C represents an accelerated temperature for the active substance material, for 
which 48 months of data are available for one finished product batch and 36 months of data are 
available for two additional finished product batches, which is considered supportive of the long-term 
stability of the active substance.  
Results from accelerated (5°C ± 3°C for 9 months) and stressed (25°C ± 5°C/60% RH ± 5% RH for 3 
months) conditions demonstrate degradation of the active substance, as can be expected, although 
acceptance criteria are still met. Freeze-thaw cycles are not considered to have a significant effect on 
the stability of the active substance. 
During the active substance and finished product stability studies, for one batch an abnormal 
degradation was observed when the material was stored under accelerated and stressed conditions. 
This batch was not used for shelf life setting. To mitigate any risk, a routine stressed sample test has 
been implemented, with an adequate acceptance criterion, for the release of active substance batches 
and non-compliance with this release test will result in batch rejection. Forced degradation studies 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 16/83 
 
  
 
 
have demonstrated that the crisantaspase active substance is resistant to high pH and light exposure, 
but is significantly degraded under oxidation and low pH conditions. The studies identify purity and 
specific activity as stability indicating analytical methods.  
The provided stability data are considered supportive and the proposed shelf-life of 36 months 
at -20°C ± 5°C in the declared CCS is endorsed.  
Commitments to complete the currently ongoing stability studies and to perform post-approval annual 
stability studies are provided. The proposed protocol (including adequate handling of any confirmed out 
of specification, OOS) is acceptable. 
1.1.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
 Description of the product and pharmaceutical development   
The crisantaspase finished product is a colourless to slightly yellow, clear to opalescent sterile solution 
for injection or infusion for intramuscular or intravenous administration. Each single-dose vial contains 
10 mg of crisantaspase active substance in trehalose, sodium chloride, sodium phosphate buffer, 
polysorbate 80 (PS80), with a 0.5 mL nominal fill. Prior to intravenous administration, the finished 
product is diluted with 100 mL of normal saline solution.  
Pharmaceutical development is, in general, sufficiently described. The active substance and the 
finished product are identical in terms of qualitative and quantitative compositions. The composition 
was developed to ensure suitable physicochemical and biological properties targeted to achieve the 
desirable safety and efficacy, considering the routes of administration, as well as product stability. A 
Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) was defined by taking into consideration the pharmaceutical 
product quality attributes required to meet the needs of the patient. 
Compatibility between the excipients and the crisantaspase active substance is considered 
demonstrated by the long-term stability data from both the active substance and the finished product. 
Selected excipients are fit for purpose and the amount of each excipient has been optimised as 
demonstrated by the formulation development studies. Excipients selected meet compendial 
requirements and are widely used in marketed products for parenteral administration. There are no 
novel excipients or excipients of human or animal origin.  
A standard CCS configuration was chosen as a boundary condition for formulation development and 
was found suitable. The primary container closure system consists of a clear Type I clear borosilicate 
vial with a capacity of 2 mL sealed with a halobutyl rubber stopper and aluminium overseal and a violet 
plastic cap. Vial and stopper comply with Ph. Eur. 3.2.1 and Ph. Eur. 3.2.9, respectively. The CCS has 
been demonstrated to be compatible with finished product components and is suitable for intended 
use, based on development and process characterisation studies, as well as long-term and in-use 
stability data. Integrity of the finished product CCS was demonstrated.   
The finished product manufacturing process has been conserved throughout development, from 
engineering to commercial, with only minor adjustments made to the process. The same process has 
been used for the manufacture of finished product batches for long-term stability and for use in clinical 
studies. Extensive process characterisation was performed. The data have been provided and these 
support the process description laid down in the dossier, including (critical) PPs with associated ranges. 
The applicant provided an overview of activities to evaluate extractables and leachables potentially 
present in the finished product from process and product-contact equipment, components and 
container closure system. In general, the assessment is considered comprehensive and identified 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 17/83 
 
  
 
 
extractables/leachables impurities are well below the acceptable limits and, therefore, do not give raise 
to any concerns. 
The SmPC statements with respect to compatibility with syringes or with diluent and infusion sets and 
in-use stability for the diluted finished product for up to 12 hours at room temperature (15°C – 25°C) 
or 24 hours when refrigerated (2°C – 8°C) and for undiluted finished product in (polypropylene) 
syringes for 8 hours at room temperature or 24 hours when refrigerated (2°C – 8°C) are supported by 
the in-use stability study and are considered justified.  
In conclusion, adequate justification is provided for the finished product formulation and manufacturing 
process development. 
 Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The crisantaspase finished product is manufactured, tested and packaged in accordance with cGMP. 
The site responsible for batch release of the finished product is Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland Ltd, 5th 
Floor, Waterloo Exchange, Waterloo Road, Dublin 4, D04 E5W7, Ireland. 
The finished product manufacturing process is a straightforward filter-fill-finish process. Both a flow 
diagram and a comprehensive narrative description have been provided. In summary, the process 
comprises of thawing and pooling of crisantaspase active substance batches, sterile filtration, filling 
into vials, stoppering and capering, and final 100% visual inspection. No formulation or dilution steps 
take place during finished product manufacture.  
The manufacturing process is generally described in sufficient detail. CPPs, non-KPPs, IPCs and hold 
times have been defined and adequately justified. The control strategy is considered typical for this 
type of product and as such acceptable.  
The applicant presented a traditional process validation/PPQ exercise, which elaborates on the 
manufacturing development data. A sufficient number of PPQ batches have been manufactured and 
placed on stability.  
In addition to the CPPs identified, the applicant presented results/data for non-KPPs, IPCs, IPMs, 
finished product bulk solution homogeneity and filling consistency.  
Furthermore, relevant supporting data (both product specific, e.g. hold time validation, and facility 
specific, e.g. media fills) have been collected. It is noted that these supporting data are often worst-
case.  
In conclusion, the PPQ/process verification data sufficiently support that the process can be considered 
validated. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
 Product specification 
The proposed release and stability specifications for the finished product are included in the dossier. 
The applicant does not present an explicit discussion of the control strategy and list of tests in this 
section of the dossier. However, these aspects are sufficiently covered (especially with regard to 
product specific tests) in the active substance sections. This is considered acceptable. The majority of 
tests are used to control both the active substance and finished product (which is acceptable as the 
active substance is fully pre-formulated and little to no degradation is observed during storage), except 
for those which are specific for the finished product.  
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 18/83 
 
  
 
 
The specification was established based on regulatory guidelines, analytical capability, process 
capability and experience. For attributes tested for both active substance and finished product, results 
from testing of the active substance are generally used as representative of both forms as the protein 
concentration and matrix are identical for the two.  
During the assessment, changes to acceptance criteria, in line with those requested for the active 
substance, were applied for the finished product specification as well. The panel of tests is considered 
approvable, however the applicant was asked to commit to adjust the fill weight target and change the 
extractable volume acceptance criterion to comply with Ph. Eur. requirements via a post-approval 
variation application (Recommendation).  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in 
the finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and 
the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004 - Nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided it is 
accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed 
necessary. 
Analytical methods 
Most analytical procedures are either identical to those described for the active substance or 
compendial. The only non-compendial method which is unique to finished product is determination of 
Polysorbate 80 content, for which appropriate validation data in accordance with ICH guidelines have 
been provided. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data (including PPQ batches and development batches) of the finished product were 
provided. The results are within the specifications applicable at the time of the release and confirm 
consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Reference materials 
Reference standards used for finished product testing are the same as those used for the active 
substance.  
 Stability of the product 
The applicant claims a shelf-life for the finished product of 36 months when stored at 2-8°C.  
All manufactured batches have been included in stability studies that were performed according to ICH 
guidelines  at  long-term  (2-8°C),  accelerated  (25°C  ±  2°C,  60%RH  ±  5%  RH)  and  stressed  (40°C  ± 
2°C/75%  RH  ±  5%  RH)  conditions,  using  the  proposed  commercial  primary  container  and  closure 
systems.  The  shelf-life  specifications  are  identical  with  release  specification,  with  the  exception  of: 
identity, bacterial endotoxins and sterility (replaced by CCIT during stability), which are tested only at 
release. 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 19/83 
 
  
 
 
Real-time data under long-term conditions (2-8°C) are available for 30 months for the PPQ batches 
and for 48 months for the development batches. Moreover, as discussed in the active substance 
stability section, one active substance batch displayed normal results at release, but a noteworthy 
degradation was observed in the stability study under accelerated and stressed conditions, which is not 
observed in the other batches. As the formulation and concentration of the finished product is identical 
to the active substance, the same atypical profile was observed in finished product stability studies 
under long-term, accelerated and stressed conditions. Because of this, the batch was not used for the 
shelf-life setting. This approach is endorsed. 
To mitigate the issue, a routine stressed sample test has been implemented, with an adequate 
acceptance criterion, for the release of the active substance batches. As the filling operation does not 
offer an opportunity for the development of any new impurities, the applicant’s proposal of conducting 
the analysis as a routine test only at active substance level is acceptable.  
Photostability of the finished product was assessed on one representative batch according to the 
requirements of ICH Q1B. The study found only minor changes in purity due to exposure to 1.2 million 
lux hours of light, however no changes were observed for vials stored in cartons representative of the 
commercial packaging. In line with these results, the SmPC contains a warning to protect the product 
from light.  
Overall, based on the currently available long-term stability data, no adverse trends are identified and 
the proposed shelf-life of 36 months for the finished product stored at 2-8°C in the commercial carton 
packaging can be endorsed.  
As discussed in the Pharmaceutical Development section, in-use stability for intramuscular 
preparations in a polypropylene syringe has been demonstrated for up to 8 hours at room temperature 
(15°C – 25°C) or 24 hours when refrigerated (2°C – 8°C) and in-use stability for intravenous 
preparations has been demonstrated for up to 12 hours at room temperature (15°C – 2°C) or 24 hours 
when refrigerated (2°C – 8°C), from the moment of withdrawing the required volume from the 
unopened vials and including the 2-hour administration time. 
Commitments to complete the currently ongoing stability studies and to perform post-approval annual 
stability studies are provided. The proposed protocol (including adequate handling of any confirmed out 
of specification, OOS) is acceptable. 
 Adventitious agents 
Not applicable, as there are no sources for the presence of adventitious agents within the 
crisantaspase manufacturing process.  
 GMO 
Not applicable. 
1.1.4.  Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 20/83 
 
  
 
 
The applicant has applied Quality by design principles in the development of the active substance and/or 
finished  product  and  their  manufacturing  process.  However,  no  design  spaces  were  claimed  for  the 
manufacturing process of the active substance, nor for the finished product. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the benefit/risk ratio of the product, which pertain to: incomplete description and/or 
validation of analytical procedures for determination of HCP, potency and protein concentration; need 
to further re-evaluate requirement for analysis of stressed active substance sample when additional 
batch data are available; need for adjustment of the fill weight target and change of the acceptance 
criteria for extractable volume in the finished product specifications to comply with Ph. Eur. 
requirements. These points are put forward and agreed as recommendations for future quality 
development.   
1.1.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
1.1.6.  Recommendations for future quality development  
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  The applicant should commit to develop a new HCP test method or, alternatively, to revalidate the 
current HCP method as recommended in Ph. Eur. 2.6.34. 
2.  Concerning the method description for determination of catalytic efficiency, the applicant should 
commit to include additional controls to assure method validity and to comply with GMP 
requirements with respect to trending. 
3.  The applicant should commit to perform supplemental validation of the analytical method for 
Protein Concentration. 
4.  The applicant should commit to perform an evaluation of a potential potency assay method 
optimisation. 
5.  The applicant should commit to re-evaluate the requirement for conducting a stressed sample 
routine test for active substance release once batch data from a sufficient number of batches are 
available. 
6.  The applicant should commit to adjust the fill weight target and change the extractable volume 
acceptance criterion to comply with Ph. Eur. requirements via a post-approval variation application. 
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
JZP-458 is a new, recombinantly expressed Erwinia chrysanthemi asparaginase. The amino acid 
sequence of JZP-458 is identical to native crisantaspase. A Pseudomonas fluorescens-based platform 
technology was chosen as the microbial expression system for JZP-458. Following the comprehensive 
analytical comparability to verify that the identity, quality, and potency of JZP-458 are similar to native 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 21/83 
 
  
 
 
crisantaspase from the natural fermentation of Erwinia chrysanthemi (Erwinase) in combination with 
the extensive clinical experience with approved asparaginases, the nonclinical strategy supporting 
registration of JZP-458 relies on publicly available non-clinical data on Erwinia sp. asparaginases, and 
is further supplemented by 4 non-clinical studies conducted with JZP-458. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacology 
2.4.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
A cytotoxicity in vitro study was conducted with JZP-458 in a panel of 8 B-cell and T-cell 
leukaemia/lymphoma cell lines (Report 20OL766). Cells were incubated with varying concentrations of 
JZP-458 and luminescence measurements of ATP were used to obtain IC50 values for inhibition of 
cellular proliferation. All cell lines were sensitive to JZP-458 with IC50 values < 0.1 U/mL (range 
0.0002-0.06 U/mL, data not shown). These results are consistent with published studies (Parmentier, 
2015, Chien, 2014 Serravalle, 2016).  
No additional in vivo pharmacology studies were submitted with JZP-458. Non-clinical in vivo efficacy 
studies using Erwinia asparaginase in mice or rats are reported in the published literature and studies 
demonstrate the in vivo pharmacological activity of Erwinia sp. asparaginase in mouse or rat tumour 
models, at doses that were associated with depletion of plasma asparagine. 
2.4.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
An overview of literature was provided by the applicant, which demonstrates activity of asparaginases 
in depleting asparagine content in blood plasma, reducing tumour burden and increasing survival times 
in mouse or rat tumour models (Minetto, 2017; Chen 2017; Sanghez, 2018; Chiu, 2014). These effects 
are most likely mediated through the depletion of asparagine, which is the primary mode of action. 
Immunosuppressive effects of asparaginase were also described by reducing macrophage activity in 
clinical use (Song, 2017). Further evidence of immunosuppression was provided as Erwinia carotovora 
was able to inhibit the blastogenic response of both rabbit and human leukocytes in vitro (Ashworth, 
1974; Han, 1972)., and reduced antigenic response after a challenge with sheep red blood cells in mice 
(Berenbaum, 1970). 
2.4.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
No safety pharmacology data was submitted for JZD-458 or asparaginase. Since asparaginase is 
derived from biotechnological processes, stand-alone safety pharmacology studies are not needed, in 
line with ICH S6(R1).  
2.4.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies on Erwinia asparaginases were identified in the 
published preclinical literature. 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 22/83 
 
  
 
 
 
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
The pharmacokinetics of JZP-458 were evaluated in a single-dose mouse and a single dose rat study 
after IV administration (Report WIL-350510), in comparison with several other (mostly conjugated) 
asparaginases, including two control asparaginases in rat (Oncaspar and pegcrisantaspase). 
In mice and rat, although dose normalised Cmax was comparable to the other asparaginases, DN AUC 
was 8-15 times lower (except for recombinant crisantaspase from Corynebacterium). In addition, 
clearance was 20.4 ml/hr/kg in mice and 9.82 ml/hr/kg in rat, which is 8-14 (mice) or 11-18 (rat) 
times higher than for the other asparaginases. T1/2 (2.13h in mice and 1.35h in rat), although similar 
to literature data from Erwinia asparaginases, was 8-13 (mice) and 23-41 (rat) times lower than for 
the other asparaginases, including the control substances. It is noted that, besides T1/2, no other 
comparisons were provided for the PK parameters of other asparaginases in literature. Based on the 
provided data, to result in similar AUC values, JZP-458 should therefore be administered at much 
higher doses than the other asparaginases, resulting in higher Cmax values (or more frequent 
administration of lower doses to prevent a higher Cmax). Nevertheless, no adverse effects due to a 
higher Cmax were observed in the clinical studies. 
Volume of distribution was comparable to the other asparaginases tested in mice (56.9 ml/kg) and 
slightly (2-3times) lower in rats (16.4 ml/kg) and indicates a distribution confined to the central 
vascular compartment. 
After repeated dosing for 14 days in rats the increase in Cmax was dose-proportional. The increase in 
AUC was slightly more than dose proportional. No accumulation and no gender differences were 
observed. Dose levels used in the repeated dose study were 12-120 times higher than in the single 
dose PK study. Clearance (19.1 to 35.1 mL/h/kg) and VSS (69.1 to 100 mL/kg) were 2-6 times higher 
than after the lower dose used in the single dose study. 
Distribution 
Formal tissue distribution and protein binding studies were not conducted with JZP-458 in accordance 
with regulatory guidelines for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals. JZP-458 has a low volume of 
distribution (16.4-56.9/kg in rat and mice, respectively), suggesting a distribution limited to the 
central vascular compartment. 
Neither placental transfer nor excretion to milk have been investigated. 
Metabolism 
No metabolism studies with JZP-458 were conducted in animals. The absence of metabolism studies is 
in accordance with ICH S6(R1) and is agreed with. Recombinant crisantaspase is expected to be 
metabolised into small peptides by catabolic pathways. 
Excretion 
No excretion studies with JZP-458 were conducted in animals. The absence of excretion studies is in 
accordance with ICH S6(R1). 
Immunogenicity 
In the repeat dose toxicity study with JZP-458 (Study 2018-458-032), the incidence of ADA induction 
was 0% (0 of 30) in the control group, 45% (9/20) at 3000 U/kg/day, 5% (1 of 20) at 10,000 
U/kg/day, and 20% (6 of 30, all from the recovery animals) at 30,000 U/kg/day. This is comparable 
EMA/429470/2023

with the results from studies conducted with Erwinia chrysanthemi-derived asparaginase and can be 
expected considering the bacterial origin of the asparaginase. 
2.4.4.  Toxicology 
2.4.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Based on studies from the early 1970s, asparaginase administered as a single IV dose up to 5000 
IU/kg appears to be relatively well tolerated in rats, hamsters and rabbits (SSARL-DPH-72-05). In 
contrast, in another study (SSARL-DPH-72-02), doses of 2000 IU/kg and onwards were lethal to 
rabbits. This difference was not explored further by the applicant. However, these studies are decades 
old and were not conducted under GLP conditions and are thus only considered to be supportive for 
this application.   
2.4.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
A 14-day repeat dose toxicity study in rat was performed with JZP-458 (Report 2018-458-032). Rats 
received daily infusion of JZP-458 at doses of 0, 3,000, 10,000, and 30,000 U/kg/day JZP-458 
(corresponding to 0, 4.6, 15.2, and 45.6 mg/kg respectively). JZD-458 was immunogenic with 
approximately half of all animals in the low-dose recovery group having a positive anti-drug antibody 
(ADA) titer. For the high and mid dose group the incidence was limited. Immunogenicity did not affect 
the interpretation of the study.  
The high-dose of 30,000 U/kg/day was poorly tolerated with animals being euthanised or put in early 
recovery on day 6. Animals in this group suffered severe weight loss, piloerection, rough coat and oral 
discharge. Weight loss, markedly lower reticulocytes and moderately decreased platelet counts were 
noted in addition to haematological changes observed in lower dose groups. Mild elevation of blood 
glucose and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was observed in this group as well as and minimal to mild 
increases in total protein, albumin and globulin. High dose group animals had slight to marked 
decrease in splenic red pulp and extramedullary haematopoiesis and slight to severe decreased cortical 
lymphocytes of thymus.  
In surviving animals of the high dose group, all findings were reversible. 
Dose-dependent decrease in food consumption and body weight was observed in animals given 3,000 
U/kg/day onwards. In the 10,000 U/kg/day group this was also accompanied by piloerection. 
Histopathological changes from 3,000 UI/kg/day onward included decreased erythroid parameters, 
decreased lymphocytes and increased myeloid precursors in bone marrow. Spleen weights were 
decreased, corresponding with which was accompanied by minimally or slightly lower extramedullary 
haematopoiesis.  
The NOAEL was 10,000 U/kg/day, which corresponds to an exposure of 322,000 h.mIU/ml. This is 
approximately 3.6 times the human MRHD (based on 48 hour IV dosing AUC of 179 h.U/ml). The low 
exposure multiple suggests that the observed toxicity can be clinically relevant. Given the extensive 
clinical experience with asparaginases, this assessment is considered to be adequate.  
Historical repeat dose toxicity studies in rabbits and monkeys, which were not conducted under GLP 
conditions, showed that in rabbits, 1,000 IU/kg/day was associated with changes in clinical chemistry 
(BUN, glucose, creatinine, liver enzymes), haematology, and histopathology (liver, and kidney). In 
monkeys, doses up to 10,000 IU/kg Erwinia sp. asparaginases were generally tolerated. No 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 24/83 
 
  
 
 
 
toxicologically meaningful changes were observed at 1,000 IU/kg. At 2,000 and 10,000 IU/kg/day, 
hepatocellular vacuolation, transient leukopaenia, and increases in serum triglycerides, lipids, and 
glucose were observed.  
2.4.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
In line with ICH S6(R1) and ICH S9, no genotoxicity studies were submitted. 
2.4.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
In line with ICH S6(R1) and ICH S9, no carcinogenicity studies were submitted. 
2.4.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No reproductive or developmental toxicity studies were performed with JZP-458. GLP-compliant 
reproductive and developmental toxicity studies submitted were conducted with Erwinaze 
(asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi)  
In a GLP fertility and early embryonic development study (Study 11-4368) in which male rats were 
dosed from 4 weeks before mating until 25 days after the end of the mating period and females were 
dosed from 2 weeks before mating until GD 6, a decrease in sperm count was noted in males, but 
there were no effects on fertility parameters at any doses. Therefore, the NOAEL for systemic and 
fertility effects in both male and female rats was 2,000 IU/kg IM QOD (every other day). At the end of 
the study, all Erwinaze/Erwinase-treated animals were positive for ADAs. 
In a GLP embryofoetal toxicity study in which mated female rats were dosed during the period of 
organogenesis (GD 6-GD 16), the maternal systemic NOAEL was 1,000 IU/kg IM QOD due to 
decreased body weights and food consumption. Based on the slight increase in partially undescended 
thymic tissue in the 2,000 IU/kg dose group, the foetal NOAEL was also considered to be 1,000 IU/kg 
IM QOD. There were no effects on the reproductive parameters and thus the reproductive NOAEL was 
2,000 IU/kg IM QOD. In this study, 26 of the 27 (maternal) rats assessed for ADAs on GD 20 were 
positive, of which 18 were positive for neutralizing ADAs. 
In a GLP embryofoetal toxicity study in which mated female rabbits were dosed during the period of 
organogenesis (GD 6–GD 18), the maternal systemic NOAEL was 10 IU/kg IM QOD due to decreased 
body weight and food consumption. Neither the maternal reproductive nor the foetal NOAELs could be 
determined due to increased resorptions and post-implantation loss, fewer live foetuses, decreased 
gravid uterine and foetal/litter weights, foetal visceral abnormalities, and delays in foetal skeletal 
ossification. At the end of the study (GD 29), 8 of the 9 rabbits evaluated for ADAs were positive, of 
which 5 were positive for neutralizing ADAs. 
In a pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study in which pregnant and lactating female rats were 
dosed from GD 6 through weening of their offspring (of which selected pups were evaluated through 
sexual maturity, mating, and establishment of pregnancy), there were no effects on gestation, 
delivery, viability and lactation indices, pup body weight or clinical signs during and after the lactation 
period. There was a slight Erwinase-related increase in time to acquire surface righting (≥ 600 IU/kg) 
and mid-air righting (≥ 1,200 IU/kg), but the findings were considered non-adverse. Therefore, the 
maternal and offspring (pre- and postnatal development) NOAEL was 2,400 IU/kg IM QOD. ADAs were 
not evaluated in this study. 
Although there were no effects on the reproductive parameters or significant foetal observations in rats 
in reproductive and developmental studies with Erwinaze/Erwinase, the presence of neutralizing ADAs 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 25/83 
 
  
 
 
complicates the interpretation of these studies. In addition, there were findings in the rabbit 
developmental toxicity study, despite the presence of ADAs. Based on these observations JZP-458 
should be considered a potential reproductive and developmental toxicant. This has been adequately 
reflected in the SPC. 
Based on the extensive clinical experience available for crisantaspase and its well documented safety 
profile, juvenile toxicology studies with JZP-458 were not warranted. 
2.4.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Plasma concentrations increased approximately dose proportionally (Cmax) to slightly (1.2-1.8x) more 
than dose proportional (AUC) in the repeat dose toxicity study with JZP-458.  
Exposure multiples based on Cmax and AUC0-24 were 3.7 and 3.6 (based on the maximum Cmax 
[21.6 U/ml] and AUC0-48 [182 U·h/ml] observed for the clinical 25/25/50 mg/m2 schedule on 
Monday/Wednesday/Friday or the 25 mg/m2 schedule every 48 hours).  
The pharmacokinetics of JZP-458 were studied primarily in mice and rats and only following IV 
administration. Based on the low Vss (56.9 ml/kg in mice, 16.4 ml/kg in rats and 1.40 L/m2 in 
humans), distribution was limited to the central vascular compartment. Plasma clearance in animals is 
low (20.4 ml/hr/kg in mice and 9.82 ml/hr/kg in rat), as well as in humans (0.12 L/hour/m2). 
Following repeated dosing (14 days in rats) an approximately dose proportional increase in exposure 
was observed for Cmax and AUC (dose levels 3000-30000 U/kg) as well as in humans at doses from 
12.5 to 50 mg/m2. No plasma AUC accumulation following repeated dosing of JZP-458 was observed. 
No gender differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of JZP-458. The elimination half-life 
following IV administration was 2.13h in mice,1.35h in rat, and 8.27 hours in humans. After IM 
administration, elimination half-life in humans was twice as long (19.1h). 
2.4.4.7.  Local tolerance  
An assessment of local tolerance was incorporated in the repeat dose toxicity study with JZP-458 in 
rats. No adverse findings local tolerance findings were observed. Experience with other asparaginases 
does not suggest local tolerance to be a risk factor. 
2.4.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
In an investigative study of the diabetogenic potential of Erwinia sp. Asparaginase (SSARL-DPH-70-
07), there was no definitive evidence of diabetogenic potential or fatty liver and bromosulfophthalein 
retention following daily administration of 2000 IU/kg Erwinia sp. asparaginase for 5 days to 1 monkey 
or of a single dose of 10,000 IU/kg to 1 rabbit.  
2.4.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In line with the guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment for medicinal products for human use 
and Questions and Answers on the guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2), and because JZP-458 
is derived from biotechnological processes, a formal ERA is not required. 
EMA/429470/2023

2.4.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Considering the comparability of JZP-458 with Erwinase, a standard nonclinical package was not 
provided. Instead an integrated non-clinical strategy was used, consisting of publicly available non-
clinical information on Erwinia sp. asparaginases, further supplemented by 4 non-clinical studies 
conducted with JZP-458. This was considered acceptable. 
Submitted in vitro studies demonstrate potent anti-proliferative effects of JZP-458 in 
leukaemia/lymphoma cell lines with IC50 values that are lower than the nadir SAA levels of ≥0.1 
IU/mL achieved during clinical use of JZP-458. The in vitro data obtained with JZP-458 in 
leukaemia/lymphoma cell lines are generally consistent with the published literature for other Erwinia-
derived asparaginases. Inhibition of proliferation was consistent with that reported in literature 
suggesting that JZP-458 is comparable to other asparaginases, thus providing adequate demonstration 
of the proof of concept in vitro. 
Information on the secondary pharmacology of asparaginase is provided through literature data. Due 
to the comparable activity of JZP-458 and other asparaginases, animal studies would have likely 
resulted in comparable results as well and these studies would have added no real evidence to support 
the MAA of JZP-458. Literature data is also not suggestive of any safety pharmacology related issues.   
From the pharmacokinetic point of view, the rat was the most relevant species for non-clinical efficacy 
and safety studies. Overall, pharmacokinetics has been sufficiently described following the IV route. 
The toxicology programme revealed adverse effects fully comparable to other asparaginases at 
clinically relevant doses, which were primarily restricted to haematological effects. At higher doses, the 
clinical condition of test animals rapidly deteriorates. The low exposure multiples (3.6 times above the 
maximum human exposure) suggest that the observed toxicity, which is typical of asparaginases, may 
be clinically relevant and should be monitored clinically (see clinical aspects and discussion).   
In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats with Erwinia chrysanthemi crisantaspase, 
there were no effect on female or male fertility. In embryofoetal development studies in rats and 
rabbits, Erwinia chrysanthemi L-asparaginase produced maternal toxicity, increased resorptions, post 
implantation loss, embryofoetal toxicity, and/or gross abnormalities at exposures lower than those 
observed clinically.  
2.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical point of view Enrylaze the efficacy and safety profile of has been adequately 
characterised and is recommended for marketing authorisation.

2.5.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology development programme for RC-P includes 2 studies: a completed phase 1 
study in healthy adult participants (JZP458-101) and an ongoing pivotal phase 2/3 study (JZP458-201) 
in paediatric and adult participants with ALL/LBL who have developed hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived 
asparaginases. A popPK analysis of data from Study JZP458-101 in healthy participants was performed 
to facilitate the selection of a starting dose for the phase 2/3 pivotal Study JZP458-201.  
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 28/83 
 
  
 
 
 
Population PK (PopPK)analyses of data from Study JZP458-201 in participants with ALL/LBL were 
performed to support dose selection and dose confirmation throughout the study. 
PopPK models 
Two popPK models were developed during phase 2/3 of the development programme, i.e., an IM and 
IVIM popPK model, in support of the various treatment regimens. The IM popPK model uses only a 
subset of the data for model development (only sparse IM SAA PK data from Study JZP458-201 were 
included). The IVIM popPK model contains all (available at the time) data from phase I and phase 2/3 
studies. 
The IVIM popPK model was a 1-compartment model with sequential mixed-order absorption for IM 
(parameters estimated include: F1, zero order R1 followed by a 1st order absorption KA), linear 
elimination with population estimate for CL fixed to the value obtained from the IV alone model; inter-
individual variability (IIV) expressed as an exponential term on CL, V, R1, and KA; off-diagonal 
covariance term for CL and V; and APEM residual error models with M3 BLQ data handling method that 
were described separately for IM and IV data. BSA was included as a significant covariate on CL and V. 
The covariate analysis also identified race (African American) on CL, disease (ALL/LBL) on CL for 
patients following IM administration, and disease (ALL/LBL) on V as significant covariates. African 
Americans had 25% lower CL, ALL/LBL patients who received IM administration had 104% higher 
(2.04 fold) CL, and ALL/LBL patients had 24% lower V than healthy volunteers. There were no 
differences in CL between Hispanic and Non-Hispanic study participants. The BSA standard used for 
scaling was 1.2 m2 to be reflective of an average paediatric study participant. 
During evaluation of this application, the model was updated to incorporate the final data from study 
JZP458-201 (final database lock date of 22 Nov 2022).  During the initial modelling, the eta 
distributions suggested that the effect of healthy volunteers versus patients should be included in the 
base model. In addition, body size, as measured by body surface area (BSA), was also incorporated to 
stabilise the model further. The condition number was checked to ensure that no correlation was 
introduced at this point. In addition, an effect of patient age was also included on the first absorption 
rate constant (KA1) in the CP model.  
Further examination showed that the between-subject variability (BSV) on V had a high degree of 
shrinkage, and several steps were taken to resolve this problem. This included testing a Manly 
transform for BSV on V and several OMEGA BLOCK models. The transform did not appreciably reduce 
the shrinkage but did show that the BSV on CL and V were highly correlated (0.8), and a shared eta 
approach between CL and V was used instead. This approach necessitated fixing BSV on V to 0 and 
removing V from MU modelling, this then resulted in a model that converged with acceptable 
parameter precision and removed the problem of high correlation. In addition, the BSV on the second 
absorption rate constant (KA2) was poorly estimated and fixed to a small value (10%) to improve 
stability further. 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 29/83 
 
  
 
 
This model then became the ‘base model’, and other covariates were examined graphically using eta 
plots and were subsequently tested as being potentially influential as single covariate models, including 
anti-drug antibody (ADA), neutralizing antibody (NAB), RACE (each race was tested singly), disease 
subtype and primary disease (B CELL ALL, T CELL ALL, B CELL LBL, T CELL LBL, B CELL, T CELL, ALL 
and LBL were all tested singly). In addition, the dose (ADOSE) was tested on CL, V, and F1 but found 
to be important only on F1. Other covariates were identified but came out of the model on back 
elimination or were small enough to have no clinical relevance (a change in parameter over 20% is the 
usual cut-off for relevance). The only covariate further identified was the effect of RACE 2 
(BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN) on CL. No other covariate evaluated provided a substantial decrease (P 
< 0.05) in the IMP objective function (OBJ) or was estimated with a clinically meaningful change in the 
parameters with sufficient precision to be included in the model. The final model evaluation determined 
that the dose effect on F1 had a deleterious effect on the precision for CL, so this factor was also 
removed. 
The final IVIM popPK model was used to simulate SAA profiles to predict the proportion of subjects 
achieving a therapeutic nadir SAA (NSAA) level ≥0.1 IU/mL at 48 and 72-hours post-dose using 
different IV and IVIM-combined dosing regimens (Table 28). Table 26 shows each regimen's Cmax 
and Ctrough values.

Absorption  
Absorption of RC-P was studied in Study JZP458-101 and was evaluated using popPK modelling. RC-P 
is slowly absorbed following IM administration. The median of individual popPK predicted Tmax of RC-P 
is 14.95 hours, whereas Tmax reported in Study JZP458-101 is 24.00 hours (range: 24.00 - 36.00 
hours). The mean absolute bioavailability for intramuscular administration is 34.5-36.8% in healthy 
subjects. 
Distribution 
Distribution of RC-P was evaluated using popPK modelling and in Study JZP458-101. Following IM 
administration (IM popPK model), the geometric mean (%CV) of individual predicted V/F of RC-P is 
1.14 L/m2 (72%). Following IV administration (IVIM popPK model), the geometric mean (%CV) of 
individual predicted V of RC-P is 1.40 L/m2 (23%). In the updated popPK model V was estimated to be 
1.7 L/m2. Following intravenous administration, the mean (%CV) volume of distribution of recombinant 
crisantaspase is 1.94 L (22.4%) and 1.79 L (16.6%) following dose of 25 mg/m2 and 37.5 mg/m2, 
respectively, in healthy subjects. 
Elimination 
Elimination of RC-P was evaluated using popPK modelling and in Study JZP458-101. Following IM 
administration (IM popPK model), the geometric mean (%CV) of individual predicted CL/F of RC-P is 
0.31 L/h/m2 (45%) and the t½ is 19.1 hours (3%). Following IV administration (IVIM popPK model), 
the geometric mean (%CV) CL of RC-P is 0.117 L/hour/m2 (20%) and the t½ is 8.27 hours (15%). RC-
P is an enzyme and it is therefore expected to be metabolised by proteolytic degradation. In the 
updated popPK model CL was estimated to be 0.14 L/h/m2 (20%). 
Following intravenous administration, the mean (%CV) clearance of recombinant crisantaspase is 
0.125 L/h (22.4%) and 0.107 L/h (16.6%) following dose of 25 mg/m2 and 37.5 mg/m2, respectively, 
in healthy subjects.  
The mean (%CV) half-life is 11.5-12.6 hours (11.2-12.8%) following intravenous administration and 
19.1-23.4 hours (21.8-23.6%) following intramuscular administration in healthy subjects.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
In Study JZP458-101, RC-P exposures (SAA Cmax and AUC) increased to an approximately 
proportional extend with increasing doses within the dose range of 12.5 to 25 mg/m2 for IM 
administration, and within the dose range of 25 to 37.5 mg/m2 for IV administration. In Study JZP458-
201, based on initial popPK analyses, model-predicted exposure parameters (SAA Cmax and AUC) 
were approximately dose proportional between the dose range of 25 to 50 mg/m2 for IM and IV 
administrations. 
Time dependency 
In Study JZP458-201, based on a dosing frequency of once every 48 hours and t½ of 19.1 hours for IM 
and 8.27 hours for IV, the accumulation ratio for IM and IV RC-P is 1.21 and 1.02, respectively. The 
initial popPK model-predicted exposures parameters (SAA Cmax and AUC) generated for RC-P 
following multiple dosing also suggest that there was little accumulation. 
Special populations 
No dedicated PK studies were performed in special patient populations except paediatrics, though PK 
analysis was used to investigate SAA-time profiles/PK in sub-groups of patients. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
RC-P is an enzyme with a molecular weight of 140 kDa, which due to its size is most likely not renally 
eliminated. Therefore, the effect of renal impairment is unlikely to result in changes in the SAA-time 
profiles/PK. Likewise, the enzyme is not metabolised by hepatic enzymes and hepatic impairment is 
unlikely to alter RC-P SAA-time profiles/PK.  
Race, age and body surface area (BSA) 
PopPK simulated RC-P SAA-time profiles were compared across different subcategories within race 
(White, African American, Asian, and other), age (1 month to < 2, 2 to < 6, 6 to < 12, 12 to < 18, 18 
to < 65, and 65 to 80 years), and BSA (0.25 to < 1.00, 1.00 to < 1.66, 1.66 to < 1.95, 1.95 to 3.03 
m2). In all situations, the simulated proportion of participants achieving NSAA ≥ 0.1 IU/mL was around 
90%, which, according to the applicant, would suggest that no clinically significant difference is 
expected in the probability of achieving a therapeutic NSAA based on race, age, or BSA, following the 
proposed BSA-based dosing regimens. African Americans had 25% lower clearance, however subgroup 
analysis on race with NHANES suggested that the SAA time profiles were also comparable and largely 
overlapping across different race groups. This conclusion could also be supported based on observed 
PK parameters independent of the popPK model. 
Weight and gender 
Subgroup analysis for the assessment of the impact of gender and weight on exposure has not been 
performed. This was performed with the updated popPK model and no significant effect was identified. 
This conclusion could also be supported based on observed PK parameters independent of the popPK 
model. 
Elderly and young children 
No elderly subjects (maximum age 52 years) or very young subjects (younger than 1 year) were 
included in the clinical studies. The clinical data obtained in the phase 2/3 study is obtained from 
children (age range 1 – 25 years of age).

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The applicant indicates that DDIs are unlikely as RC-P is an enzyme and is not metabolised by hepatic 
cytochrome P450 enzymes. No dedicated DDI study has therefore been conducted. 
2.5.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi (recombinant) catalyses the conversion of the amino acid L-
asparagine into aspartic acid and ammonia. The mechanism of action of JZP-458 is thought to be 
based on the inability of leukemic cells to synthesise asparagine due to lack of asparagine synthetase 
activity, resulting in cytotoxicity specific for leukemic cells that rely on exogenous asparagine for their 
protein metabolism and survival.   
JZP-458 has the identical amino acid sequence as native crisantaspase. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamic endpoints (L-asparagine and L-glutamine concentrations) have been evaluated in 
pivotal clinical Phase 2/3 Study JZP458-201. For a description of the design of Study JZP458-201, 
please refer to the clinical efficacy section of this report. 
For 49% of patients, complete asparagine depletion, (asparagine levels < 0.025 μg/mL, below the 
lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for all 7 postdose samples collected in Course 1), was obtained 
following IM administration of doses at 25 mg/m2 MWF, 37.5 mg/m2 MWF, and IM or IV 25/25/50 
mg/m2 MWF. Nearly complete depletion (asparagine levels < 0.05 μg/mL, or 2 times the LLOQ, for all 
7 postdose samples collected in Course 1) was obtained in ~80% of patients. Glutamine levels were 
only moderately affected. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The objective of the PK/PD models was to identify correlations between SAA and: 1) selected 
pharmacodynamic markers (PD) and 2) safety signals. 
Logistic regression (PK-PD) 
The relationship between SAA parameter AUC336 and the incidence of L-asparagine or L-glutamine 
depletion at the last sample (48h or 72h, as available per study participant and regimen) for Course 1 
was assessed using logistic regression. This analysis indicated that AUC336 was not strongly related to 
L-asparagine/L-glutamine depletion. The same logistic regression analysis was carried to assess the 
relationship between time-matched SAA values and the incidence of L-asparagine or L-glutamine 
depletion. A significant relationship between SAA and L-asparagine/L-glutamine depletion was 
observed. 
Logistic regression (PK-safety) 
The relationship between model predicted SAA parameters from Study JZP458-201 Course 1 (Cmax,6, 
AUC336, C48,L, C72,L) and the incidence of selected drug-related adverse events (hypersensitivity, 
hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, thrombosis, and hypertriglyceridemia) from Course 1 and during study (all 
Courses) was evaluated using logistic regression. There was a statistically significant relationships 
between the exposure PK parameters and hypersensitivity.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Two clinical studies have been initiated where RC-P PK samples have been taken, which contribute to 
the clinical pharmacology programme. In the completed Phase 1 study, PK has been studied after 
single dose IV (25 and 37.5 mg/m2) and IM (12.5 and 25 mg/m2). A dense sample scheme has been 
used up until 96 hours after dosing. In addition, sparse PK samples are gathered in an ongoing, open 
label Phase 2/3 study at 2 hours (IV)/2.5 hours (IM), 48 hours or 72 hours after dosing dependent on 
the dose number and the specific treatment course. The Phase 1 and Phase 2/3 studies appear 
sufficient to characterise the PK profile of RC-P.  
PopPK 
The applicant used popPK to extrapolate to different dosage regimens that were not specifically tested 
in the phase 2/3 study. PopPK in principle can be used for this purpose, in case a suitable model is 
developed, and a clear target is present. The target indicated by the applicant: NSAA level ≥ 0.1 
IU/mL at the last 72-hour time point in the first course of treatment, is adequate. It is not clear 
however if the model submitted by the applicant is suitable for its intended purpose. A flexible change 
point[(CP) MTIME] model was implemented on absorption parameters. Parameterisation of absorption 
with change point is considered to have no physiological basis and is therefore questionable. In 
addition, Predictive-corrected visual predictive check (pcVPCs) which were submitted are difficult to 
interpret due to the time scale used. Consequently, the popPK model is not considered as pivotal 
evidence in this application, and conclusions will be based on pharmacokinetic studies.   
The model cannot be used to predict target achievement for the dosing regimen not tested in the 
clinical studies. However, the dosing regimens that were not tested are very similar to those tested in 
the clinical studies. Of note, all doses in the new regimens (25 mg/m2 IM, 25 mg/m2 IV, and 50 
mg/m2 IM) and dose-intervals in the new regimens (48h or 72 h) are also present in one of the dose 
regimens that were tested in the clinical studies. This is therefore considered an interpolation. Although 
no exact numbers on response rate can be calculated, from pharmacokinetic principles no (large) 
differences in exposure and response rate are expected for regimens not tested in clinical studies. 
Importantly, SAA levels can be monitored in clinical practice.  
ADME  
The median Tmax of recombinant crisantaspase is 14.95 hours following intramuscular administration. 
The mean absolute bioavailability for intramuscular administration is 37% in healthy subjects. 
Following intravenous administration, the geometric mean (%CV) volume of distribution of 
recombinant crisantaspase is 1.75 L/m2 (14%). 
Recombinant crisantaspase is expected to be metabolised into small peptides by catabolic pathways. 
Following intravenous administration, the geometric mean (%CV) clearance of recombinant 
crisantaspase is 0.14 L/hour/m2 (20%).  
The geometric mean (%CV) half-life is 8.6 hours (13%) following intravenous administration and 18.8 
hours (11%) following intramuscular administration. 
There was no dedicated study on renal or hepatic impairment with Enrylaze. However, renal and 
hepatic impairment were evaluated within the PPK analysis and PK analysis in subgroups.  
During treatment, dose adjustment is not required for patients with total bilirubin ≤3 times the Upper 
Limit of Normal; there is limited data with Enrylaze in patients with total bilirubin > 3 times to ≤ 10 
times the Upper Limit of Normal (ULN).  
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 34/83 
 
  
 
 
Dose adjustment is not required for patients with pre-existing mild or moderate hepatic impairment 
(total bilirubin >1 to 3 times the ULN or AST > than the ULN). There are insufficient data in patients 
with pre-existing severe hepatic impairment to support a dose recommendation. There are insufficient 
data in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment to support a dose recommendation. 
There were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of RC-P based on weight (9 to 
131 kg) or sex (n=138 male; n=88 female) after the dose was adjusted by body surface area (BSA). 
The volume of distribution and clearance of recombinant crisantaspase increase with increasing BSA 
(0.44 to 2.53 m2). 
Age impacts absorption rate constant whereas younger subjects have higher absorption rate constant 
value, leading to earlier Tmax. The phase 2/3 Study JZP458-201 submitted by the applicant included 
children between 1 and 25 years of age. As elimination is not mediated by specific CYP enzymes or 
renal function large effects of developmental processes in these pathways on exposure are not 
expected for the older age groups. In addition, for other asparaginase products no dose adjustments 
based on older age are required. It is important to note that SAA levels can be monitored in clinical 
practice.  
Black or African American patients had 25% lower clearance which may increase SAA exposure 
compared to population average. No dose adjustment is needed in African American population. There 
were no clinically significant differences in clearance between Hispanic and Non-Hispanic patients. 
No drug-drug interaction study has been performed. DDIs are unlikely due to the elimination route 
being proteolytic catabolism. In the SmPC it is stated that RC-P might increase toxicity of other 
medicinal products through its effect on liver function. Additional information on potential drug 
interactions with medications commonly used in combination with asparaginase in the treatment of 
ALL/LBL (vincristine, methotrexate, cytarabine and other glucocorticoids) from other asparaginase 
containing products has also been included in the SmPC for Enrylaze.  
Pharmacodynamics 
While 49% of all IM + IV patients obtained complete asparagine completion, ~80% obtained nearly 
complete depletion. Data seem to support efficacy of RC-P treatment, but interpretation is hampered 
due to ex vivo hydrolysis by asparaginase.  
The absence of complete glutamine depletion with only moderate affection of glutamine levels and 
complete depletion of asparagine suggest an acceptable low ratio of L-glutaminase/L-asparaginase 
activity.  
A significant relationship between SAA and L-asparagine/L-glutamine depletion was observed using 
logistic regression.  
Based on observed IM data, 4 ADA positive participants with lower SAA levels (< 0.1 IU/mL) 
at matching time points in Course 1 were observed. The SAA and SAC data for these 4 participants 
were highly correlated, suggesting that the low SAA observed may also indicate a low SAC. The CL/F 
values for these 4 patients are 136% to 326% of the IM mean CL/F value. 
Seventeen ADA positive participants with high SAA levels (≥ 0.1 IU/mL) at matching time 
points in Course 1 were observed, suggesting that a low SAA may not be due to a positive ADA. 
Based on observed IV data, 3 ADA positive participants with lower SAA levels (< 0.1 IU/mL) at 
matching time points in Course 1 were observed (Table 7). The SAA and SAC data for these 3 
participants are highly correlated, suggesting that the low SAA observed may be due to low SAC. Four 
ADA positive participants with high SAA levels (≥ 0.1 IU/mL) at matching time points in Course 1 were 
observed, suggesting that a low SAA may not be due to a positive ADA.

course of RC-P.  
•  Treatments 
Part A 
In Cohorts 1a, 1b, and 1c of Part A of the study, RC-P was administered via the IM route, and the 
volume of JZP-458 at a single injection site is limited to 2 mL with the use of multiple injection sites, as 
needed.  
- 
In Cohort 1a, an IM dose of 25 mg/m2 was administered on a MWF schedule (i.e. 25/25/25).  
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 37/83 
 
  
 
 
- 
- 
In Cohort 1b, an IM dose of 37.5 mg/m2 was administered on a MWF schedule (i.e. 
37.5/37.5/37.5) 
In Cohort 1c, an IM dose of 25 mg/m2 was administered on Mondays and Wednesdays and 50 
mg/m2 on Fridays (i.e. 25/25/50). 
Cohort 2 was an expansion cohort to confirm the efficacy and safety of the final IM RC-P dose level and 
schedule. 
Part B 
In Part B of the study, RC-P was administered via the IV route, with 25 mg/m2 on Mondays and 
Wednesdays and as 50 mg/m2 on Fridays (i.e. 25/25/50). 
For both part A and part B of the study, a cycle was defined as 6 injections of RC-P. Dosages (mg/m2) 
were administered based on the participant’s body surface area (BSA) and calculated using the 
participant’s height and weight measurements taken prior to the start of each course. 
All other therapy is being continued according to the therapeutic regimen as defined in the participant’s 
original treatment protocol for the participant’s ALL/LBL.

•  Sample size 
Part A 
For the final IM RC-P dose level, 13 evaluable patients were planned in Part A Cohort 1, and 
approximately 85 patients are planned in Cohort 2 to obtain 98 patients in total at the final dose in 
Part A for the primary efficacy analysis of the IM administration route. 
The sample size of 13 evaluable patients in Part A Cohort 1 was to provide at least 80% posterior 
probability of the true response rate ≥ 96% given 100% response rate in Cohort 1 and noninformative 
neutral beta prior with α = β = 1/3. Since the primary efficacy endpoint was considered to be met if 
the lower bound of the 95% Wald confidence interval (CI) of the response rate exceeds 90%, the final 
sample size was planned as 98 patients, which would provide 83% probability that the lower bound of 
the 95% Wald CI exceeds 90%, assuming a true response rate of 96% for the primary efficacy 
endpoint and a 5% drop out rate.  
Additional patients were planned to be enrolled, if fewer than 93 out of 98 patients have the necessary 
data to be included in the Efficacy Analysis Set. 
Interim analysis 
One interim analysis with 51 patients was planned. At the interim analysis, a sample size of 51 
patients would provide 70% probability that the lower bound of the 95% CI exceeds 90% under the 
assumption of a 96% true response rate and a 5% drop out rate. Additional patients were planned to 
be enrolled, if fewer than 48 out of 51 patients have the necessary data to be included in the Efficacy 
Analysis Set. 
Part B 
A target of at least 6 evaluable patients were to be administered the first IV dose level. This sample 
size was not based on formal power calculation but provides an initial assessment of the IV RC-P 
dosing. 
•  Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
This was a single arm, open-label study. 
•  Statistical methods 
Efficacy analysis 
The primary and key secondary efficacy endpoint will be estimated using the Efficacy Analysis Set for 
patients administered the final IM RC-P dose level with at least one 72-hour (48 hour for key 
secondary endpoint) NSAA assessment collected within the protocol defined sample collection window 
(± 2 hours) in Course 1 of Part A. The last observed 72-hour (/48 hour, respectively) NSAA 
assessment collected within the protocol defined sample collection window (± 2 hours) in Course 1 will 
be used in the calculation of the two endpoints. The response rate, along with the 95% Wald CI will be 
provided. The primary and key secondary efficacy endpoint were to be considered met if the lower 
bounds of the 95% CI of the response rates exceeded 90%. 
Multiplicity control 
No formal statistical testing was planned for this study and no multiplicity adjustment was applicable. 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 40/83 
 
  
 
 
 
Interim analysis 
One interim analysis was planned after the 51st patient completes Course 1 with the final IM RC-P 
dose level in part A (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 patients). It was planned to stop enrollment of this cohort 
early for efficacy, in case the primary endpoint was met at the interim analysis. The SAP also states 
that if the incidence of allergic reactions (including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis) related to RC-P 
exceeds 25%, or the incidence of pancreatitis exceeds 10% or thrombosis exceeds 10% at this interim 
analysis, enrollment into this Expansion Cohort may be stopped for safety. 
One primary analysis is planned after the 98th patient completes Course 1 at the final IM RC-P dose in 
Part A (Cohorts 1 and 2), and  
The final analysis was planned when the overall study (Part A and Part B) is completed and all enrolled 
patients have completed all of their planned courses of RC-P, including end of study procedures, or 
have discontinued the study early. 
Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations 
For the primary and key secondary endpoints, missing data will not be imputed. 
Results 
•  Participant flow 
In total 167 patients were enrolled and treated in part A, of whom 51 at the intended IM dose level in 
Cohort 1c (25/25/50). A total of 62 patients was enrolled in IV part B. 
As of the final data cut-off date of 22 Nov 2022, the median (range) number of courses completed was 
5 (0, 15) in part A and  3 (0, 15) in part B. In IM Part A, 77.2% of patients completed all planned 
courses (Table 5). In IV Part B, this applied to 43.5% of the patients.

•  Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol was approved on 29 Aug 2019 and consequently amended twice. A summary 
of key changes is provided below.  
Protocol amendment 1 – Aug 2020 
- 
- 
- 
To allow testing of additional subcohorts at higher doses above 37.5 mg/m2, with a maximum 
of 80 mg/m2. 
To allow enrollment into Part B (IV) to begin before completion of part A (IM). 
To allow the SDRC to recommend a different dose to be given on Fridays than on Mondays or 
Wednesdays, to ensure adequate coverage for up to 72 hours. 
Protocol amendment 2 – Sep 2020 
- 
The dose capp  of 80 mg/m2 was removed for additional subcohorts, as preliminary PK 
modeling data had shown that higher doses may be necessary to achieve the objectives. 
Changes to planned analyses 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) was amended 4 times. These mostly pertained to clarifications, 
addition  of  COVID-19  sensitivity  analyses  and  update  of  study  design  following  the  protocol 
amendments.  
Protocol deviations 
Overall, 27.5% of patients in part A and 37.7% of patients in part B of the study had 1 or more 
major protocol deviations at the final analysis data cut-off. In part A, the most frequently reported 
deviation was laboratory deviation (28 of 167 [16.8%] participants). In part B, the most frequently 
reported major protocol deviation was study procedures deviation (13 of 61 [21.3%] participants).

At RC-P dose levels administered IV at doses of 25 (MW)/ 50 (F) mg/m2, no patients achieved 
NSAA levels ≥ 0.4 IU/mL at the last 72-hour assessment during the first course of treatment. 
At RC-P IV dose levels 25 (MW)/ 50 (F) mg/m2 administered on a MWF schedule, 40.0% (95% 
CI: 26.4%, 53.6%) of patients, respectively, achieved NSAA levels ≥ 0.1 IU/mL at the last 72-
hour assessment during the first course of treatment. 
In line with the intended IM dose level Cohort C, results were consistent between the interim and 
final analysis for IV Part B of the study as well. 
Ancillary analyses 
Treatment effect beyond course 1 
The applicant presented therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data for all courses in Part A and B 
(Table 9, Figure 2,Figure 3). For Cohort c at the targeted IM dose level 25 (MW)/50 (F), the 
last 48-hr mean SAA level exceeded 0.1 IU/mL (the accepted threshold to demonstrate adequate 
asparagine depletion in clinical practice) in all 10 courses. For IV Part B last 48-hr mean SAA 
levels exceeded the threshold in all courses, except for Cycle 7 (0.0810 IU/mL). Mean SAA levels 
≥ 0.1 IU/mL at the last 72-hour assessment in IM Part A Cohort C exceeded 0.1 IU/mL in the first 
6 courses. In IV Part B last 72-hr mean SAA levels did reach the threshold in cycles 2, 3 and 5.

2.5.5.3.  Clinical studies in special populations 
Paediatric patients 
The pivotal study mostly included paediatric patients. No dose adjustment is required.  
Elderly 
No clinical efficacy data in elderly is available, as the oldest included patient in the pivotal clinical trial 
was 25. Based on popPK analyses predicting similar SAA response across age ranges from 1 month to 
80 years old, no dose recommendation is proposed for elderly. 
Hepatic impairment 
No efficacy data were presented for patients with hepatic impairment. Eligible patients for the pivotal 
study must have adequate liver function, defined as: direct (conjugated) bilirubin ≤ 3X upper limit of 
normal (ULN); SGPT (ALT) and SGOT (AST) ≤5X ULN. No dose adjustment is recommended in the 
SmPC for patients with prior hepatic impairment, although there are recommendations to withhold 
treatment with bilirubin increase during treatment. 
Renal impairment 
No efficacy data were presented for patients with renal impairment. RC-P has not been studied in 
patients with moderate or severe renal impairment; there is limited data with RC-P in patients with 
mild renal impairment. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Clinical efficacy is claimed based on PD endpoints from pivotal Study JZP458-201, a single arm 
ongoing Phase 2/3 study in paediatric and adult participants with ALL or LBL, who developed an 
allergic reaction or silent inactivation to an E. coli-derived asparaginase.  
A comparative trial versus the authorised Erwinia derived asparaginase crisantaspase, the only 
alternative treatment option, would have been preferred to establish efficacy of recombinant 
crisantaspase produced in Pseudomonas fluorescens (RC-P). However, due to the repeated recent 
supply shortages experienced with crisantaspase and well-established intermediate endpoint for 
efficacy (asparaginase activity), the single arm pivotal trial design was accepted by CHMP. 
The study consisted of two parts and multiple sub-cohorts investigating RC-P at different dose levels 
and administration routes. Two of these, i.e., 25/25/50 mg/m2 IM and 25/25/50 mg/m2 IV on a 
Monday Wednesday Friday (MWF) schedule have been investigated in respectively Part A and Part B of 
the pivotal trial. The other investigated dosing regimens (25 mg/m2 and 37.5 mg/m2 IM, both on a 
MWF schedule) were part of the dose-finding phase of the study and will not be discussed here. The 
applied posology contains 3 additional potential dosing regimens, i.e., 25 mg/m2 IM Q48h and 25 
mg/m2 IV Q48h (every 48 hour instead of MWF schedules) and the combined IM and IV MWF schedule 
25/25/50 IV/IV/IM mg/m2. The dosing regimens that are not tested are very similar to the dose 
regimens that were tested in the clinical studies. Of note, all doses in the new regimens (25 mg/m2 
IM, 25 mg/m2 IV, and 50 mg/m2 IM) and dose-intervals in the new regimens (48h or 72 h) are also 
present in one of the dose regimens that were tested in the clinical studies. Although no exact 
numbers on response rate can be calculated, from pharmacokinetic principles no (large) differences in 
exposure and response rate are expected for regimens not tested in clinical studies (please refer to PK 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 54/83 
 
  
 
 
 
section of this report). Importantly, SAA levels can be monitored in clinical practice. The alternative 
dosing regimens are therefore considered acceptable.   
Eligibility criteria are acceptable and result in a study population which reflects the proposed target 
indication. However, some subpopulations were not recruited (see further discussion below).  
Although additional clinical endpoints (like relapse free survival, CR rate and MRD) would have been 
welcomed, asparaginase activity is considered a well-established intermediate endpoint for asparagine 
depletion and as such efficacy. Nadir serum asparaginase activity (NSAA) levels ≥ 0.1 IU/mL is the 
accepted threshold to demonstrate adequate asparagine depletion in clinical practice. Moreover, the 
difficulty to interpret clinical efficacy results of a single arm trial with enrollment at different stages of 
ALL treatment is acknowledged.  
The predefined target of success for the primary and key secondary endpoint (lower level of 95% CI 
exceeding 90%) is endorsed. Although cross-study comparison should be interpreted with caution, this 
lower bound is in line with, if not slightly higher, than the one observed for IM crisantaspase, Study 
AALL07P2. Nevertheless, a less strict (but sustained) response rate would have been acceptable as 
well considering the lack of alternative asparaginase treatment options for the proposed target 
population. Importantly, SAA levels can be monitored in clinical practice. 
Endpoints for the requested alternative IV route of administration were defined as exploratory. 
Considering the definition/analysis of endpoints in line with the IM route, the outcomes are still 
considered valuable for determination of efficacy. 
For a substantial proportion of patients (26-28%) at least one protocol deviation was reported. These 
mostly concerned laboratory values. Only 16 of 228 patients (7%) had major deviations related to 
collection of SAA levels, mostly related to ‘out of window’ collections which were included in the PPK 
analysis. The impact on reliability of obtained results is likely limited. 
The confidence interval around the estimate for the primary endpoint for the first treatment course is 
expected to be larger than expressed by the presented 95% CI, as the interim analysis has not been 
adjusted for multiplicity. However, the lower bound of Wald-confidence intervals corrected using either 
Pocock (80.4%) or Bonferroni-adjustment (80.1%) were similar to the lower bound of an uncorrected 
Wald 95%-CI (81.3%). 
At the request of the CHMP the applicant adjusted the wording of indication to: Enrylaze is indicated as 
a component of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) in adult and paediatric patients (1 month and 
older) who developed hypersensitivity or silent inactivation to E. coli-derived asparaginase. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In total 167 patients were included in part A (of whom n=51 at the proposed IM dose level), and 62 
patients in IV part B. The median age was 10 years and the majority of patients in both study parts 
had experienced an allergic reaction to prior asparaginase treatment (72-90%), and B-ALL as primary 
disease (>74%). The median number of completed courses was 5 in part A and B at the time of the 
final analysis. Overall, 68% of participants (156/228) completed treatment as planned. Of the 
participants who discontinued treatment, the median number of courses missed was 3.   
The number of included patients with prior silent inactivation to E. Coli derived asparaginase alone is 
very limited (1 patient at the proposed dosing regimen and n=6 at lower dose levels), while these 
patients form an important part of the target population. Cross-reactivity of RC-P with other 
asparaginases has not been studied. However, the number of participants with neutralizing antibodies 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 55/83 
 
  
 
 
 
(NAb) against RC-P is very small (Part A [IM]: n=4; Part B [IV]: n=2); therefore, regarding the 
potential impact of NAb on SAA no definitive conclusion could be drawn. Nevertheless, there are no 
indications that there exists cross-reactivity between prior E.Coli neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and 
RC-P, as a high proportion of patients achieved sufficient SAA levels, all RC-P all predose anti-drug 
antibody (ADA) positive patients became at some point ADA negative for RC-P, and SAA levels were 
not decreased in these patients. Please refer to the safety section of this report for further discussion 
of NAbs. 
Although eligible, patients aged 1 month to <1 year, or >25 years were not included. Treatment with 
PEG asparaginase and development of hypersensitivity/silent inactivation is expected to take longer 
than 1 month and there is no reason to assume that Enrylaze would not work in paediatric patients <1 
year. Based on similar disease characteristics and treatment in patients 1 month and older, 
extrapolation of data to younger children aged 1 month to 1 year is acceptable. Although response 
rates for children between 1 month to <1 year are more uncertain, as adjustments in BSA based 
dosing are described for Spectrila (<1y) and due to the absence of data in this age range in the 
current dossier, this is acceptable considering the recommended therapeutic drug monitoring (please 
also refer to PK section of this report). ALL disease characteristics and treatment are not fully similar 
between the studied population and (older) adults. However, there is no reason to believe that RC-P 
will be not effective in adults >25 years of age. There are several publications for other asparaginase 
products (Oncaspar and nationally registered Erwinase) that indicate efficacy of asparaginase therapy 
in older patients as well. These have been discussed during registration of these products and resulted 
in an indication that is not restricted by age. Moreover, large effects of developmental processes in 
elimination pathways on exposure are not expected for the older age groups. As such, extrapolation to 
patients aged 1 month to <1 year and >25 years is endorsed. In response to the list of questions, the 
indication has been reworded to adequately reflect the age limit (1 month and older).  
Only 1 patient with hypersensitivity or silent inactivation to other E. coli-derived asparaginases (e.g. 
short acting asparaginase) than Oncaspar-pegaspargase was included. This is endorsed, as 
pegasparaginase is now well-established as first choice in frontline therapy and adequately reflected in 
SmPC section 5.1.  
Few patients with LBL were included (n=5 at the proposed dose level). In clinical practice ALL and LBL 
are considered similar in appearance and behaviour and both require intensive treatment. As such, 
efficacy in LBL can be based on extrapolation from results in ALL. 
Results presented for Cohort 1b at the 37 mg/m2 IM dose level are based on pooled data from Cohort 
1b and expansion Cohort 2. In response to the list of questions, it was clarified that patient 
characteristics of both cohorts are similar and as such, pooling is acceptable. 
IM administration 
At the interim analysis, the primary endpoint was not met at the intended dose level 25/25/50 nor at 
one of the other dose levels, as the lower bound of the 95% CI did not exceed the predefined target of 
90%. In total 89.8% (95% CI: 81.3, 98.3) of participants achieved NSAA levels ≥ 0.1 IU/mL at the 
last 72-hour assessment during the first course of treatment in Cohort 1c. In response to the list of 
questions, results of the final analysis were presented at which the primary and secondary endpoints at 
the proposed IM and IV dose levels remained unchanged compared with the interim analysis. Using a 
95%-CI with better coverage (Agresti-Coull or Wilson), the lower bound is 78%.  
Importantly, although the predefined lower margin of the 95% CI was not met, the response rate is 
still considered clinically relevant. Final therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data over multiple courses   
demonstrated sustained SAA levels upon repeated administration. The last 48-hr mean SAA level 
exceeded 0.1 IU/mL with IM administration in all 10 courses analysed and levels at the last 72-hour 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 56/83 
 
  
 
 
assessment exceeded the threshold in the first 6 cycles. TDM is recommended for all patients which 
should enable reaching sustained high asparaginase activity in a substantial part of the target 
population. When administered every 48 hours a trough asparaginase activity measurement should be 
performed at 48 hours post dose. When dosing on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule, trough 
serum asparaginase activity should be measured 72 hours after the Friday dose and prior to 
administration of the following Monday dose. The dosing schedule or route of administration should 
then be individually adapted. 
It appears as if with IM RC-P, a slightly lower proportion of patients had sustained asparaginase 
activity 48- and 72-hour postdose compared to IM Erwinia asparaginase (NSAA levels ≥0.1 IU/mL 
were 100% at both timepoints for crisantaspase). This should be interpreted with caution due to the 
well-known caveats of inter-study comparison as well as the small sample size of crisantaspase 
studies. As discussed above, results are still considered clinically relevant for the target population 
lacking stable supply of an available alternative asparaginase treatment option. 
The predefined target of success was met for the secondary endpoint. The proportion of patients with 
last 48- hour NSAA level ≥0.1 IU/mL was 95.9% (95% CI: 90.4, 100.0) during first course IM, with a 
better confidence interval (Agresti-Coull, Wilson) this becomes 86%. As expected, a lower proportion 
of patients reached NSAA levels ≥ 0.4 IU/mL at the last 48- and 72-hour assessments (65.3% and 
46.9%, respectively).  
IV administration 
Although in treatment protocols both the IM and IV administration route are allowed, in Europe most 
patients receive IV asparaginase treatment. Results for M/W/F IV RC-P indicate lower response rates 
compared to IM administration, which might be expected based on the lower half life (approximately 8 
hours vs. 19 hours with the IM route of administration) and experience with crisantaspase. In Part B of 
the pivotal trial JZP458-201, 40% (95% CI: 26.4, 53.6) of patients achieved NSAA levels ≥0.1 IU/mL 
at the last 72-hour assessment and 89.8% (95% CI: 82.1, 97.5) at the last 48-hour assessment 
during the first course of treatment. These response rates are more or less in line with response rates 
measured with IV crisantaspase. TDM data upon repeated administration indicate sustained SAA levels 
over multiple courses at the last 48-hour assessment. At the last 72-hour assessment the threshold 
was only reached in few cycles. It is acknowledged that SmPC section 4.2 has been updated to include 
a recommendation to monitor asparaginase levels in all patients. If the targeted asparaginase activity 
levels have not been achieved, it is proposed to switch to an alternative dosing regimen. In this way, 
the MWF IV route can still be maintained, and as it is less invasive than IM when intravenous access is 
already in place to administer other anti-cancer medication, it is a valuable alternative for patients who 
are able to maintain sufficient asparaginase levels.  A warning has been included in SmPC section 4.4 
to reflect that SAA levels vary substantially between patients with the IV route of administration and to 
clarify how the dose should be individually adapted when the target level is not reached.  
2.5.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy is considered established for Enrylaze in the final agreed indication based on PD endpoints 
related to asparaginase activity from pivotal Study JZP458-201. Despite the relaxed type I error 
control and a lower than targeted response rate, reported results are still considered clinically relevant. 
TDM is recommended for all patients in the SmPC which enables high asparaginase activity to be 
obtained in a substantial part of the target population, for which no (stable supply of an) alternative 
asparaginase treatment option exists.  
With the IV route of administration on a M/W/F schedule, lower response rates were observed 
compared to IM administration. This is acceptable considering the recommended therapeutic drug 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 57/83 
 
  
 
 
monitoring and potential to switch to an alternative dosing regimen when insufficient asparaginase 
activity is achieved with IV administration. Moreover, the IV route of administration would allow to stop 
infusions immediately in case of acute hypersensitivity reactions and increase patient convenience 
when they already have a central line.  
2.5.8.  Clinical safety 
2.5.8.1.  Patient exposure 
At the final database lock date of 22 November 22, a total of 167 patients (33 in Cohort 1a [IM 25 
mg/m2 MWF], 83 in Cohort 1b [IM 37.5 mg/m2 MWF], and 51 in Cohort 1c [25 (MW)/50 (F) mg/m2]) 
were included in the Safety Analysis Set for Part A (IM) of the study. Furthermore, 61 patients were 
included in the Safety Analysis Set for Part B (IV 25 (MW)/50 (F) mg/m2). 
Of the 167 patients in the Safety Analysis Set, 44 (26.3%) were <6 years of age, 57 (34.1%) were 6 
to <12 years of age, 45 (26.9%) were 12 to <18 years of age, and 21 (12.6%) were ≥ 18 years of 
age. 
Overall in Part A (IM), the median (range) number of RC-P courses completed was 15.0 (0, 15); 
overall in Part B (IV), the median (range) number of RC-P courses completed was 3.0 (0, 15).  
Overall, 68% of participants (156/228) in the JZP458-201 study completed RC-P treatment as planned. 
Of the participants who discontinued JZP-458 treatment, the mean (SD) and median number of 
courses missed was 2.8 (1m7) and 3, respectively.  
2.5.8.2.  Adverse events 
Overall, 164 of 167 patients (98.2%) in Part A (IM) and 60 of 61 (98.4%) of patients in Part B (IV) 
experienced 1 or more TEAEs during the study. A total of 111 of 167 patients (66.5%) in Part A (IM) 
and 40 of 61 patients (65.6%) in Part B (IV) experienced a serious TEAE (Table 11).  
Three of the 167 patients (1.8%) treated in Part A (IM) had a fatal event. All 3 deaths were considered 
unrelated to JZP-458. None of the patients in Part B (IV) died. Treatment- emergent adverse events 
leading to study drug discontinuation were experienced by 23 of 167 patients (13.8%) in Part A (IM) 
and 20 of 61 patients (32.8%) in Part B.

patients [60/167]), and white blood cell count decreased (25.7% of patients [43/167]).  
Further Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were reported in the System Organ Classes, gastrointestinal disorders 
(26.9% [45/167]), General disorders and administration site conditions (8.4% [14/167]), Immune 
system disorders (6.0% [10/167]), Infections and infestations (25.1% [42/167]), Injury, poisoning

2.5.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
Overall, in Part A (IM), 66.5% of patients (111/167) experienced at least 1 serious TEAE during the 
study (Table 19). The most frequently (i.e., those occurring in at least 5% of patients) reported serious 
TEAEs included febrile neutropenia (31.7% [53/167]), pyrexia (11.4% [19/167]), dehydration (9.0% 
[15/167]), sepsis (7.8% [13/167]), stomatitis and vomiting (6.6% [11/167] each) and nausea (5.4%

Deaths 
Three patients (1 in the 25 mg/m2 MWF dose cohort and 2 in the 37.5 mg/m2 MWF dose cohort) died. 
Grade 5 (fatal) serious TEAEs included sepsis, aspiration pneumonia, and multiple organ dysfunction 
syndrome; none of these fatal TEAEs were related to RC-P. 
Treatment emerged adverse events of interest 
Adverse events of interest for asparaginase include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, and thrombosis 
(Kearney, 2009; Pieters, 2011; Stock, 2011; Plourde, 2014; Hijya, 2016; Asparlas, 2018; 
Kloos, 2020). The analysis of TEAEs of special interest (allergic reactions and pancreatitis and 
thrombosis) were pre-planned.  
Allergic Reactions (Including Hypersensitivity and Anaphylaxis) 
In Part A (IM), allergic reactions regardless of causality, inclusive of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, 
have occurred in 66 of 167 patients (39.5%). However, only 18 patients (10.8%) had at least 1 event 
that was considered related to RC-P. The most frequently (i.e., those occurring in at least 5% of 
patients) reported events related to allergic reactions included rash maculopapular (7.8% [13/167]); 
drug hypersensitivity (7.2% [12/167]), allergic transfusion reaction (6.0% [10/167]) and drug 
eruption and rash (5.4% [13/167] each). Study drug-related allergic reactions included drug 
hypersensitivity (6.0% [10/167]); anaphylactic reaction  and rash maculopapular (1.8% [3/167] 
each), rash erythematous (1.2% [2/167]); and rash, and urticaria (0.6% [1/167] each).  
A total of 10 patients experienced Grade 3 study-drug related allergic reactions which included drug 
hypersensitivity (7 patients) and anaphylactic reaction (3 patients). Of the 18 patients who had allergic 
reaction, inclusive of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, that were related to study drug, 10 patients 
discontinued RC-P. .

In Part B (IV), allergic reactions regardless of causality, inclusive of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, 
have occurred in 32 of 61 patients (52.4%), of which 16 patients (26.2.%) had at least 1 event that 
was considered related to RC-P. The most frequently (i.e., those occurring in at least 5% of patients) 
reported events related to allergic reactions included drug hypersensitivity (19.7% [12/61])  Rash 
maculopapular (9.8% [6/61] ), and catheter site rash and infusion-related reaction (6.6% [4/61] 
each). Study drug-related allergic reactions included drug hypersensitivity in 10 patients  and 
anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity, and urticaria in 1 patient each; all of these reactions resolved. 
Of the 16 patients who had allergic reactions, inclusive of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, that were 
related to study drug, 13 patients discontinued RC-P. 
Pancreatitis 
Twelve of 167 patients (7.2%) in Part A (IM) experienced an event of pancreatitis (PT = pancreatitis 
acute [5patients] and pancreatitis [8 patients]; including 1 patient who experienced AEs of both 
preferred term [PT]), all of which were considered related to RC-P. Of these patients, 10 patients 
experienced an event of ≥ Grade 3 pancreatitis that was considered related to RC-P and lead to study 
drug 
discontinuation. 
Three of 61 patients (4.9%) in Part B (IV) experienced an event of pancreatitis. Of these 2 patients 
experienced an event of ≥ Grade 3 pancreatitis that was considered related to RC-P and led to study 
drug discontinuation.  
Thrombosis 
Three of 167 patients (1.8%) in Part A (IM) experienced a TEAE of thrombosis (PTs of superior sagittal 
sinus thrombosis [1 patient], pulmonary embolism [2 patients], and jugular vein thrombosis [2 
patients]), of these 2 patients (1.2%) had at least 1 event that was considered related to study drug 
(superior sagittal sinus thrombosis [1 patient], pulmonary embolism [2 patients], and jugular vein 
thrombosis [1 patient]). None of the events of thrombosis led to RC-P discontinuation. 
Two of 61 patients (3.3%) in Part B (IV) experienced a TEAE of thrombosis (PTs of pulmonary 
embolism and deep vein thrombosis [1 patient each]_, of these, 1 patient (1.6%) had at least 1 event 
that was considered related to RC-P (deep vein thrombosis). The TEAE of deep vein thrombosis led to 
study drug discontinuation.  
Hepatotoxicity  
Hepatic toxicity (inclusive of narrow SMQ of liver-related investigations, signs, and symptoms) was 
observed in 57 patients (34.1%) in Part A (IM), and  34 patients (20.4%) experienced events assessed 
as related to RC-P. The most frequently (i.e., those occurring in at least 5% of patients) reported 
hepatic toxicity inclusive of standardised MedDRA queries (SMQ) of liver-related investigations related 
to RC-P, included ALT increased (14.4% of patients [24/167]), AST increased (10.8% of patients 
[18/167]), and blood bilirubin increased (6.6% of patients [11/167]). 
Hepatic toxicity (inclusive of narrow SMQ of liver-related investigations, signs, and symptoms) was 
observed in 20 patients (32.8%) in Part B (IV), with 13 patients (21.3%) experienced events assessed 
as related to RC-P. The most frequently (i.e., those occurring in at least 5% of patients) reported 
hepatic toxicity inclusive of SMQ of liver-related investigations related to RC-P, included ALT increased 
(18.0% of patients [11/61]) and AST increased (9.8% [6/61]). 
Hyperglycaemia 
Hyperglycaemia was observed in 28 of 167 patients (16.8%) in Part A (IM), with 15 of 167 patients 
(9.0%) of the reported events were assessed as related to RC-P. 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 66/83 
 
  
 
 
Hyperglycaemia was observed in 11 of 61 patients (18.0%) in Part B (IV), and 7 of 61 patients 
(11.5%) of the reported  were events assessed as related to RC-P. 
2.5.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Given the study population and that these patients received multi-agent chemotherapy, abnormal 
chemistry parameters and haematology parameters were expected during the course of the study. As 
such, shifts in chemistry parameters were observed from baseline in albumin, ALT, AST, bilirubin, 
glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels, and shifts in haematology parameters were observed, 
particularly in neutrophil count, haemoglobin and platelet count. Shifts in these parameters are 
consistent in patients with ALL/LBL  receiving multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimens, including 
asparaginase.  
Shifts in coagulation parameters showed no discernible clinically meaningful differences from baseline. 
2.5.8.5.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for safety 
Not applicable. 
2.5.8.6.  Safety in special populations 
No special populations were evaluated in the study. 
Review of the final data by four age groups (<6 years, ≥ 6 to 12 years, ≥ 12 to 18 years and ≥ 18 
years) showed no apparent increase in the rate of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in any 
age subgroups across dosing Cohort (Table 14). 
The most common TEAEs across dosing Cohort and age subgroup were abnormal laboratory 
parameters (hematology and chemistry), vomiting, pyrexia, nausea, and febrile neutropenia. These 
were expected TEAEs which are usually reported and observed in patients with acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma (ALL/LBL) receiving multi agent chemotherapy, including 
asparaginases. 
Certain AEs appeared to be more frequent in a certain age group. For example, back pain seemed to 
be more frequently reported in the older age group (≥ 18 years group) across all dosing cohorts, 
although this trend was not apparent for most of the frequently observed TEAEs. There were more 
case of pancreatitis and thrombosis in children aged 12 years and older than in children of the age 6-
12 years. For hepatic AEs, no trend in the rate of events by age subgroup was seen. Due to the small 
number of participants in each age subgroup and the small number of events, the significance of this 
observation is unclear.

Table 14. Summary of treatment-emergent adverse events by age subgroup 
2.5.8.7.  Immunological events 
In Part A (IM), a total of 216, 513, and 322 samples were collected from patients in Cohort 1a (IM 25 
mg/m2 MWF), Cohort 1b (37.5 mg/m2 MWF), and Cohort 1c  (25 [MW]/50 [F] mg/m2, respectively. 
These samples were collected from Course 1 through the end of study, with the majority of samples 
collected form Course 1 through Course 6. Anti-RC-P antibody data were available from a median 
(range) of 5.0 (1 to 14) courses from 33 patients in Cohort 1a, 4.0 (1 to 15) courses from 83 patients 
in Cohort 1b, and 4.0 (1 to 11) courses from 51 patients in Cohort 1c.  
In Part B (IV), a total of 344 samples were collected from patients after IV administration of 25 
(MW)/50 (F) mg/m2.  Anti-RC-P antibody data were available from a median (range) of 3.0 (1 to 15) 
courses from 61 patients in Part B (IV). 
Eighty-two of 167 patients (49.1%) who received IM RC-P had confirmed positive ADA toward RC-P. Of 
these 82 ADA positive patients, 11 experienced a treatment-related hypersensitivity reaction during 
the study, and 4 developed NAb. A total of 85 of 167 (50.9%) patients were ADA negative toward RC-
P, and 7 of these 85 patients experienced treatment-related hypersensitivity reaction during the study. 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 68/83 
 
  
 
 
 
 
A posthoc analysis was conducted using only participants with at least 1 postdose evaluable ADA value. 
A total of 77 of 165 participants (46.7%) who received IM RC-P had confirmed positive ADA toward 
RC-P. Of these 77 ADA positive participants, 11 experienced a treatment-related hypersensitivity 
reaction during the study, and 4 developed NAb. A total of 88 of 165 participants (53.3%) who 
received IM RC-P were ADA negative toward RC-P, and 6 experienced a treatment-related 
hypersensitivity reaction during the study. 
Seven patients were ADA-positive patients predose 1, all became ADA negative at least once during 
the study. Predose ADA positive status did not affect Course 1 SAA levels; all 7 predose ADA positive 
patients had NSAA levels ≥ 0.1 IU/mL at all available 48- and 72-hour timepoints during Course 1.   
In part B (IV) 34 of 61 (55.7%) patients had confirmed positive ADA toward RC-P. Of these 34 ADA 
positive patients, 12 patients experienced a treatment-related hypersensitivity reaction during the 
study and 2 developed NAb. A total of 27 of 61 patients (44.3%) who received IV RC-P were ADA 
negative toward RC-P and 4 of these patients experienced a treatment-related hypersensitivity 
reaction during the study. None of the patients had NAbs.  
A posthoc analysis was conducted using only participants with at least 1 postdose evaluable ADA value. 
A total of 33 of 60 participants (55.0%) who received IV RC-P had confirmed positive ADA toward RC-
P. Of these 33 ADA-positive participants, 11 experienced a treatment-related hypersensitivity reaction 
during the study, and 2 developed positive NAb. A total of 27 of 60 participants (45.0%) who received 
IV RC-P were ADA negative toward RC-P, and 5 experienced a treatment-related hypersensitivity 
reaction during the study.  
2.5.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No interactions studies have been performed.  
2.5.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall, in Part A (IM), 23 of 167 patients (13.8%) experienced a TEAE that led to discontinuation of 
study drug. Events that led to discontinuation of study drug included drug hypersensitivity (4.2% 
[7/167]); pancreatitis (3.6% [6/167]), and pancreatitis acute (2.4% [4/167] each); anaphylactic 
reaction (1.8% [3/167]); and necrotizing fasciitis, ALT increased, and hyperammonaemia (0.6% 
[1/167] each). All AEs leading to discontinuation were considered related to RC-P, except for 
necrotizing fasciitis which was deemed related to study procedures (IM injection). 
Overall in Part B (IV), 20 of 61 patients (32.8%) experienced a TEAE that led to discontinuation of RC-
P. Events that led to discontinuation of RC-P included drug hypersensitivity (14.8% [9/61]), 
pancreatitis, vomiting and infusion-related reaction (3.3% [2/61] each) and nausea, anaphylactic 
reaction, hypersensitivity,  hyperammonaemia encephalopathy, and deep vein thrombosis (1.6% 
[1/61] each). All events leading to RC-P discontinuation were considered related to study treatment. 
2.5.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
RC-P was approved by the FDA on 30 June 2021 at a dosage of 25 mg/m2 administered IM every 48 
hours.  
Through 31 January 2022, a total of 11 spontaneous cases (presenting 21 events) were reported for 
RYLAZE (brand name in the US). The most commonly reported events are rash (2) and drug 
hypersensitivity (2). No new risks have been identified based on post-marketing sources through 31 
January 2022. 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 69/83 
 
  
 
 
2.5.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data for RC-P is based on study JZP458-201, a single arm ongoing Phase 2/3 study in paediatric 
and adult patients with ALL or LBL, who developed an allergic reaction or silent inactivation to E. coli-
derived asparaginase. The safety data base includes a total of 167 patients who were treated with 
different treatment regimens of IM RC-P and 61 patients treated with IV RC-P. 
Most patients in the Safety data Analysis set were below the age of 18 years.  
Adverse events (AEs) 
For both part A (IM) and part B (IV) the most common Grade 3 or 4 TAES were haematological AEs 
including anaemia, neutrophil count decrease, platelet count decreased, febrile neutropenia and white 
blood cell count decreased. Further, Grade 3 Gastrointestinal disorders, Infections and infestations and 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders, were commonly reported.  
Given the single arm study design and the extensive co-medication (including chemotherapy) that the 
ALL patients receive, interpretation of the safety data is hampered. Even so, while numeric differences 
are seen, the general safety profile of RC-P seems to be reasonable comparable to crisantaspase.  
Only limited numbers of patients were included per dosing cohort and the study was not designed or 
powered to show differences in safety between doses studied or between the IM versus the IV routes 
of administration. Comparison of safety data between different cohorts should therefore be done with 
caution. Nevertheless, provided data does not indicate a consistent difference in the percentage of 
patients with AEs between dose cohorts in Part A. More treatment related serious AEs and AEs leading 
to study drug discontinuation were reported for patients treated in part B than for patients treated in 
part A of the study (47.5% vs 28.7% and 32.8% vs 13.8%, respectively). For part B (IV) more of the 
reported SAE’s were considered study drug related, the incidence of all reported SAEs was comparable 
for patients who received IM and IV RC-P (65.6% vs 66.5%, respectively).  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) and deaths 
The majority of the reported serious TEAEs in Part A (IM) were considered not related to RC-P; 28.7% 
of patients (48/167) had serious TEAEs that were considered related to RC-P. Treatment-related 
serious TEAEs reported by 2 or more patients included: febrile neutropenia (8.4% [14/167]); drug 
hypersensitivity (4.8% [8/167]); nausea and pancreatitis (3.6% [6/167] each); pancreatitis acute 
(3.0% [5/167]); vomiting and anaphylactic reaction (1.8% [3/167] each); colitis, sepsis, 
hyperammonaemia, hyperglycaemia, and pulmonary embolism (1.2% [2/167] each).  
The majority of the reported serious TEAEs in Part B (IV) were considered related to RC-P. Overall, 
47.5% of patients (29/61) had serious TEAEs that were considered related to RC-P. Treatment related  
serious TEAEs reported by 2 or more patients included vomiting (9.8% [6/61]), drug hypersensitivity 
and hyperglycaemia  (8.2% [54/61 each]), nausea (6.6% [4/61]), febrile neutropenia and infusion-
related reaction (4.9% [3/61] each) and ALT increased, hypoglycaemia and pancreatitis and 
hyperglycaemia (3.3% [2/61] each). 
Three patients (1 in the 25 mg/m2 MWF dose cohort and 2 in the 37.5 mg/m2 MWF dose cohort) died. 
Grade 5 (fatal) serious TEAEs included sepsis, aspiration pneumonia, and multiple organ dysfunction 
syndrome; none of these fatal TEAEs were considered related to RC-P. 
For crisantaspase neurotoxicity is reported including CNS depression, convulsion, encephalopathy and 
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PrES), is reported as risk and included in section 4.4 
and 4.8 of the SmPC For RC-P a warning regarding these potential AEs is included in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC.  
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 70/83 
 
  
 
 
The incidence and kind of serious TAEs reported for RC-P seem to be in line with what has been 
reported previously for other asparaginase products.    
Events that led most often to discontinuation of study drug included, hypersensitivity, pancreatitis and 
pancreatitis acute, and anaphylactic reactions, which are known AEs for asparaginase therapy resulting 
in discontinuation of asparaginase treatment. 
Other Events of Special Interest (OESIs) 
Allergic Reactions (Including Hypersensitivity and Anaphylaxis) 
In Part A (IM), a total of 10 patients experienced Grade 3 study-drug related allergic reactions which 
included drug hypersensitivity (7 patients) and anaphylactic reaction (3 patients). Of the 18 patients 
who had allergic reaction, and that were considered related to study drug, 10 patients discontinued 
RC-P. In Part B (IV), of the 16 patients who had allergic reactions considered related to study drug, 13 
patients discontinued RC-P. 
Hypersensitivity reaction is one of the most relevant toxicities of asparaginase treatment. The reported 
frequency of hypersensitivity to any type of asparaginase varies considerably in published trials the 
reported incidence is between 10% to 30% for patients receiving asparaginase for the first time.  
The patients included in the current study had already experienced a hypersensitivity reaction or had 
silent inactivation to E. coli derived asparaginase. Specifically, more than 70% of the patients included 
had had a hypersensitivity reaction against E. coli derived asparaginase. For crisantaspase which is 
also indicated for patients who experienced an hypersensitivity reaction on, or had silent inactivation of 
E. Coli derived asparaginase treatment, allergic reactions are reported for 3-37% ALL patients (Hijiva, 
2016). The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions in the current study are comparable to the 
incidences reported for crisantaspase. 
Based on a review performed by the EMSO of 2 studies with pre-medications and PEG asparaginase 
(Burke et al., 2020), the use of pre-medication to decrease the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions 
with asparaginase treatment is recommended in ESMO and NCCN guidelines. Pre-medication was 
associated with both a lower rate of substitution of PEG asparaginase to crisantaspase asparaginase 
and lower acute adverse events.  
The protocol of study JZP458-201 did not specify or require the use of pre-medications prior to the 
administration of RC-P. Upon further analysis the applicant indicated that the majority of included 
patients (~71% in IM total group and 59% in IV arm) did not receive pre-medications as primary 
prophylaxis to prevent allergic reactions and current data are inconclusive as to whether pre-
medication should be recommended for all patients. A higher rate of allergic reactions and study drug 
discontinuations due to allergic reactions has however been noted in patients who received IV 
treatment compared to IM RC-P. As such, a consideration for premedication with IV use as currently 
proposed in SmPC section 4.2 is endorsed. 
Pancreatitis 
Twelve of 167 patients (7.2%) in Part A (IM) experienced an event of pancreatitis (PT = pancreatitis 
acute [5 patients] and pancreatitis [8 patients]; including 1 patient who experienced AEs of both 
preferred term [PT]), all of which were considered related to RC-P. Of these patients, 10 patients 
experienced an event of ≥ Grade 3 pancreatitis that was considered related to RC-P and lead to study 
discontinuation. 
Three of the 61 patients (4.9%) in Part B (IV) experienced an event of pancreatitis. Of these 2 patients 
experienced and event of ≥ Grade 3 pancreatitis that was considered related to RC-P and led to study 
drug discontinuation 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 71/83 
 
  
 
 
 
In the literature the reported incidence of asparaginase-associated pancreatitis ranges from 2% to 
18% (Burke et al., 2020), in line with the observed incidence of pancreatitis for RC-P. 
Thrombosis 
Three of 167 patients (1.8%) in Part A (IM) experienced an TEAE of thrombosis Of which 2 (1.2%) had 
at least 1 event that was considered related to study drug. None of the events of thrombosis led to RC-
P discontinuation.  In part B (IV) 2 of 61 patients (3.3%) experienced a TEAE of thrombosis. One of 
those patients had at least 1 event that was considered related to RC-P (deep vein thrombosis) and led 
to study drug discontinuation.  
In published studies, the reported incidences of thrombosis in patients receiving asparaginase-
containing chemotherapy for ALL were 2% to 10%(Caruso, 2006; Raetz and Salzer, 2010), in line with 
the observed rates in the RC-P studies.  
The use and possible type of prophylactic medications and strategies to prevent thrombosis prior to 
asparaginase administration was not fixed in the study protocol, use was left to investigator’s 
discretion. A review of concomitant medications revealed that a total of 7 patients received 
anticoagulants, prophylactically to prevent thrombosis. In addition, 2 patients received heparin 
potentially for central line care or another reason. Based on these small numbers, there is insufficient 
evidence to recommend the use of anticoagulation for prophylaxis in prevention of thrombosis. 
Hepatotoxicity  
Hepatotoxicity is a commonly reported AE for asparaginase therapy, risk is increased with age, higher 
doses and obesity (Burke et al., 2020). For RC-P treatment hepatic toxicity was observed in 57 
patients (34.1%) in Part A (IM), with 34 patients (20.4%) experienced events assessed as related to 
RC-P.  
As of the data cut-off date, hepatic toxicity was observed in 20 patients (32.8%) in Part B (IV), with 13 
patients (21.3%) experienced events assessed as related to RC-P.  
The incidence seen for RC-P treatment is in line with which has been reported for other asparaginase 
products. For crisantaspase AEs of hepatotoxicity including hepatic steatosis, hepatic failure, 
cholestatic jaundice and hepatomegaly, have been described. These AEs are not reported for RC-P. 
However, this might be due to the limited safety data base. The applicant will monitor severe 
hepatotoxicity via routine pharmacovigilance activities and the information will be included in the 
periodic safety update reports.  
Hyperglycaemia 
The reported incidences of hyperglycaemia (116.8% for par A (IM) and 18.0% for part B (IV) are in 
line with what has been reported for other asparaginase products. Severe hyperglycaemia was 
reported for 2 (1.2%) of the patients treated in part A (IM) and for 5 (8.2%) of the patients treated in 
part B (IV), none resulted in discontinuation of study drug. 
Immunogenicity 
Eighty-two of 167 patients (49.1%) who received IM RC-P had confirmed positive ADA and of those, 11 
experienced a treatment-related hypersensitivity reaction during the study, and 4 developed positive 
NAb. 7 of the 85 ADA negative patients experienced treatment-related hypersensitivity reaction during 
the study. Seven patients were ADA positive patients predose 1, all became ADA negative at least once 
during the study. Predose ADA positive status did not affect Course 1 SAA levels. 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 72/83 
 
  
 
 
In part B (IV) 34 of 61 (55.7%) patients had confirmed positive ADA and of those, 12 experienced a 
treatment-related hypersensitivity reaction during the study and 2 developed positive NAb. Four of the 
27 ADA experienced a treatment-related hypersensitivity reaction during the study.  
As could be expected the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions is higher for patients who developed 
ADAs during treatment. However, the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions was comparable to what 
has been reported for crisantaspase in the literature.  
In the study of Wang et al. (2020), none of the patients who received only E.coli asparaginase, cross-
reacted with the Erwinia antigen.  Cross-reactivity of Enrylaze with other asparaginases has not been 
studied. Previous studies show that there is greater cross-reactivity of plasma between native E.-coli 
derived asparaginase and PeG-asparaginase than there is between native E.coli-derived asparaginase 
and Erwinia-derived asparaginase. Potential cross-reactivity of Enrylaze with other asparaginases is 
expected to be minimal. This is due to the fact that Erwinia-derived asparaginase and E. coli-derived 
asparaginase share only 70% amino acid homology and therefore, cross-reactivity with native E coli–
derived asparaginase is expected to be low.  
Furthermore, although there is an association between antibody levels against native E. coli-derived 
asparaginase and asparaginase activity (inverse correlation), one-third of blood samples with 
insufficient asparaginase activity after the administration of native E coli-derived asparaginase tested 
negative for the presence of antibodies. Apart from antibodies, other factors such as insufficient dosing 
or increased clearance because of degradation by proteases, might influence the treatment efficacy.  
In total 89.8% (95% CI: 81.3, 98.3) of participants achieved NSAA levels ≥ 0.1 IU/mL at the last 72-
hour assessment during the first course of treatment in Cohort 1c (IM) and in Part B (IV) of the, 40% 
(95% CI: 26.4, 53.6) of patients achieved NSAA levels ≥0.1 IU/mL at the last 72-hour assessment.  
Given the efficacy results it seems that most of the patients who switched due to allergic reactions on 
E.Coli derived asparaginase, did not have anti-bodies that cross-reacted to RC-P resulting in  RC-P 
inefficiency. Moreover, the risk of silent inactivity of RC-P due to cross-reactivity seems to be limited, 
and a recommendation for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has also been included in section 4.2.  
It seems that slightly more patients have developed ADAs with RC-P treatment than which has been 
reported in patients treated with crisantaspase, for which the incidence of ADA positive patients ranges 
between 8 and 33% (Albersten et al., 2001b, Albertsen et al., 2002b and Wang et al., 2003). 
However, for all asparaginase products the frequency of the development of anti-asparaginase 
antibodies is highly variable between studies. Development of ADA’s is of relevance if it results in early 
discontinuation of asparaginase treatment, due hypersensitivity reactions and/or development of NAbs, 
because this impacts efficacy of the treatment. Of the 18 patients in part A (IM) who had allergic 
reaction, inclusive of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, that were related to study drug, 10 patients 
discontinued RC-P. Of the 16 patients in part B (IV) who had allergic reactions, inclusive of 
hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, that were related to study drug, 13 patients discontinued RC-P. 
Overall, most patients completed their planned asparaginase treatment.  
The number of participants with neutralizing antibodies (NAb) is very small (IM Part A: n=4; IV Part B: 
n=2). Mean SAA levels for the last 48-hour and the last 72-hour were comparable between ADA+ and 
ADA- subjects throughout treatment across all dosing regimens tested in the clinical study. Although 
no firm conclusions can be drawn based on the small number of NAb+ subjects, available data do not 
suggest a difference in the impact of NAb status on SAA levels. 
Safety specific populations 
Most patients included in the study are below the age of 18 years, therefore the safety profile of adults 
is largely unknown. Toxicity data and the incidence of AEs per age group (<6 years, ≥6 to <12 years, 
≥12 to <18 years and >18 years) were provided. 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 73/83 
 
  
 
 
Due to the small number of patients included in the age subgroups and the small number of events, no 
definitive conclusion can be drawn with regard to similarity of RC-P toxicity for patients at different 
ages. However, in general the safety profile of RC-P seems comparable across age subgroups. There 
was no consistent trend toward higher or toxicity for one of the age subgroups.  
In section 4.8 of the SmPC it is mentioned that the majority of patients were <18 years of age and 
that the safety profile of adults above 25 years of age is has not been studied, some adverse reactions, 
such as hepatotoxicity, thrombosis, and pancreatitis, have been reported more frequently in adults 
with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia receiving other asparaginases than the paediatric patients. 
2.5.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of RC-P is in line with what is known from other asparaginase products. There was 
no clear difference in safety between different dosing regimens. Only limited number of adult patients 
are included in the safety database and all these patients were below the age of 25 years. The safety 
of RC-P in adults will be monitored post approval.  Risks associated with the use of RC-P can be 
adequately managed with the information and warnings included in the product information.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed target indication is: 
‘Enrylaze is indicated as a component of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of 
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) in adult and paediatric 
patients (1 month and older) who developed hypersensitivity or silent inactivation to E. coli-derived 
asparaginase.’ 
ALL and LBL are a group of rare haematological malignancies arising from precursor B cells (B-ALL/B-
LBL), T cells (T-ALL/T-LBL), or both B and T cells (mixed lineage ALL/LBL). The 2008 and 2016 WHO 
classifications of lymphoid malignancies define B-ALL/B-LBL and T-ALL/T-LBL as single disease entities, 
categorised as leukaemia if there is extensive blood and marrow involvement, lymphoma if the process 
is confined to a mass lesion with no or minimal blood/marrow involvement, and leukaemia/lymphoma 
if both are present. ALL and LBL are similar in appearance and behaviour and both require intensive 
treatment. 
Asparaginase treatment is known to contribute to overall survival of ALL/LBL patients. Asparaginase 
therapy is based on the inability of leukemic cells to synthesise asparagine due to lack of asparagine 
synthetase activity, resulting in cytotoxicity specific for leukaemic cells that rely on exogenous 
asparagine for their protein metabolism and survival. It should be demonstrated that the switch to this 
alternative asparaginase treatment results in sustained asparagine depletion (as measured by 
intermediate endpoint asparaginase activity).  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the EU, the majority of patients diagnosed with ALL and LBL follow a standard treatment protocol in 
which E. coli-derived L-asparaginase is an important component of first line therapy.  
There are currently three preparations of asparaginase for use in patients with ALL/LBL:  
-  Short-acting E. coli derived L-asparaginase (Spectrila) 
- 
Long-acting pegylated (PEG)-asparginase, E. coli derived (Oncaspar) 
-  Short-acting Erwinia chrysanthemi L-asparaginase (crisantaspase) indicated for patients who 
develop a hypersensitivity reaction to E. coli-derived asparaginases (e.g. Erwinase) 
Switching patients who develop clinical hypersensitivity or silent inactivation to E. coli-derived 
asparaginase to the alternative non-E. coli-derived preparation (e.g. Erwinase) can maintain survival 
benefits when adequate asparagine depletion is achieved. However, since 2016, there has been a 
worldwide shortage of Erwinase due to ongoing manufacturing issues. 
Patients with hypersensitivity or silent inactivation to an E. coli-derived asparaginase have an unmet 
need for a reliable immunologically distinct L-asparaginase product that will allow them to continue and 
complete their prescribed treatment. 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 76/83 
 
  
 
 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Pivotal clinical study JZP458-201 is a single arm ongoing Phase 2/3 study in paediatric and adult 
participants with ALL or LBL, who developed an allergic reaction or silent inactivation to an 
E. coli-derived asparaginase.  
The study consisted of two parts, Part A investigating IM RC-P and Part B investigating IV 25/25/50 
RC-P and multiple sub-cohorts at different dose. 
As of the 22 Nov 2022 final analysis data cut-off date, 167 patients were included in part A, and 62 in 
part B. The median age was 10 years and the majority of patients in both study parts had experienced 
an allergic reaction to prior asparaginase treatment (72-90%), and B-ALL as primary disease (>74%). 
The median number of completed courses was 5 in part A 3 in part B. 
The primary endpoint was response rate, i.e., patients with last 72-hour nadir serum asparaginase 
activity (NSAA) level ≥ 0.1 IU/mL during first course IM, and for the key secondary endpoint response 
rate with last 48 hour NSAA level ≥ 0.1 IU/mL during first course IM. Asparaginase activity is a well-
established surrogacy for asparagine depletion and clinical efficacy and thereby contributing to OS gain 
as part of the overall treatment paradigm for ALL and LBL. 
The primary and key secondary endpoints upon IM administration were to be considered met if the 
lower bounds of the 95% CI of the response rates exceeded 90%. Results upon IV administration were 
planned as exploratory. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In part A of the pivotal trial, 89.8% (95% CI: 81.3, 98.3) of the patients in Cohort 1c, with the 
targeted dose level of 25/25/50, achieved NSAA levels ≥ 0.1 IU/mL at the last 72 hour assessment 
during first course IM. At the 48-hour assessment, this was 95.9% (95% CI: 90.4, 100.0).  
NSAA levels ≥0.4 IU/mL during first course IM in Cohort 1c were achieved by 46.9% (95% CI: 33.0, 
60.9) of patients at the last 72-hour assessment and 65.3% (95% CI: 52.0, 78.6) of patients at the 
last 48-hour assessment. 
In Part B of the pivotal trial JZP458-201, 40% (95% CI: 26.4, 53.6) of patients achieved NSAA levels ≥
0.1 IU/mL at the last 72 hour assessment and 89.8% (95% CI: 82.1, 97.5) of patients achieved NSAA 
levels ≥ 0.1 IU/mL at the last 48-hour assessment during the first course of treatment with IV 
25/25/50 administration of RC-P.  
NSAA levels ≥ 0.4 IU/mL were achieved by 16.9% (95% CI: 7.4, 26.5) of patients at the last 48-hour 
assessment with IV administration. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The predefined target for the primary endpoint was not met and results were not fully controlled for 
type I error. Despite this and even allowing for a possible overestimation of the effect of Enrylaze in 
the clinical trial, the response rates achieved are still considered clinically relevant. Furthermore, 
trough asparaginase activity measurement is required for all patients which should allow adaptation of 
the dosing schedule or route of administration if required.  
Most of the patients studied were diagnosed with ALL. However, as in clinical practice ALL and LBL are 
considered similar, efficacy in LBL can be based on extrapolation from results in ALL. 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 77/83 
 
  
 
 
Only few patients with prior silent inactivation to E. Coli derived asparaginase were investigated, while 
these patients form an important part of the target population. Cross-reactivity of Enrylaze with other 
asparaginases has not been studied. Previous studies show that there is greater cross-reactivity of 
plasma between native E.-coli derived asparaginase and PeG-asparaginase than there is between 
native E.coli-derived asparaginase and Erwinia-derived asparaginase. Potential cross-reactivity of 
Enrylaze with other asparaginases is expected to be minimal. This is due to the fact that Erwinia-
derived asparaginase and E. coli-derived asparaginase share only 70% amino acid homology and 
therefore, cross-reactivity with native E coli–derived asparaginase would be low.  
Although eligible, patients aged 1 month to <1 year, or >25 years were not included. Treatment with 
PEG asparaginase and development of hypersensitivity/silent inactivation is expected to take longer 
than 1 month and there is no reason to assume that Enrylaze would not work in paediatric patients <1 
year. Based on similar disease characteristics and treatment in patients 1 month and older, 
extrapolation of data to younger children aged 1 month to 1 year is acceptable. Although response 
rates for children between 1 month to <1 year are more uncertain, as adjustments in BSA based 
dosing are described for Spectrila (<1y) and due to the absence of data in this age range in the 
current dossier, this is acceptable considering the recommended therapeutic drug monitoring. ALL 
disease characteristics and treatment are not fully similar between the studied population and (older) 
adults. However, there is no reason to believe that RC-P will be not effective in adults >25 years of 
age. There are several publications for other asparaginase products (Oncaspar and nationally 
registered Erwinase) that indicate efficacy of asparaginase therapy in older adults as well. These have 
been discussed during registration of these products and resulted in an indication that is not restricted 
by age. Moreover, large effects of developmental processes in elimination pathways on exposure are 
not expected for the older age groups As such, extrapolation to patients aged 1 month to <1 year and 
>25 years is endorsed.  
Even though not all dose regimens are investigated, it should be considered that the dosing regimens 
that are not tested are very similar to the dose regimens that were tested in the clinical studies. Of 
note, all doses in the new regimens (25 mg/m2 IM, 25 mg/m2 IV, and 50 mg/m2 IM) and dose-
intervals in the new regimens (48h or 72 h) are also present in one of the dose regimens that were 
tested in the clinical studies. Although no exact numbers on response rate can be calculated, from 
pharmacokinetic principles no (large) differences in exposure and response rate are expected for 
regimens not tested in clinical studies. Importantly, SAA levels can be monitored in clinical practice. 
The alternative dosing regimens are therefore considered acceptable.   
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, 164 of 167 patients (98.2%) in Part A (IM) and 60 of 61 (98.4%) of patients in Part B (IV) 
experienced 1 or more TEAEs during the study. A total of 111 of 167 patients (66.5%) in Part A (IM) 
and 40 of 61 patients (65.6%) in Part B (IV) experienced a serious TEAE. A total of 3 of 167 patients 
(1.8%) in Part A (IM) had a fatal event, none of these were considered related to RC-P treatment. 
None of the patients in Part B (IV) died. Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to study drug 
discontinuation were experienced by 23 of 167 patients (13.8%) in Part A (IM) and 20 of 61 patients 
(32.8%) in Part B. Events that led to study drug discontinuation included hypersensitivity, pancreatitis 
and pancreatitis acute, anaphylactic reaction, ALT increased, hyperammonaemia, vomiting, infusions 
related reaction, nausea, encephalopathy and deep vein thrombosis.  
The most frequently (i.e., those occurring in at least 5% of participants) reported serious TEAEs 
included febrile neutropenia (23.0% of participants [14/61]), vomiting (9.8% of participants [6/61]) 
and vomiting and, drug hypersensitivity and hyperglycaemia (8.2% of participants [5/61] each), and 
nausea (6.6% of participants [4/61] each). 
EMA/429470/2023  
Page 78/83 
 
  
 
 
For asparaginase products, hypersensitivity reactions are common events that might lead to 
discontinuation of asparaginase treatment. In Part A (IM), allergic reactions regardless of causality, 
inclusive of hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction, rash maculopapular and urticaria, occurred in 66 of 
167 patients (39.5%). Of the patients who experienced a hypersensitivity reaction, 18 (10.8%) had at 
least one event that was considered related to RC-P. In Part B (IV), allergic reactions, including 
hypersensitivity, rash maculopapular, catheter site rash, anaphylactic reaction, infusion-related 
reactions and urticaria, regardless of causality, occurred in 32of 61 patients (52.4%), of which 16 
patients (26.2%) had at least 1 event that was considered related to RC-P.  
Eighty-two of 167 patients (49.1%) in part A (IM) who received IM RC-P had confirmed positive ADA. 
Of these 82 ADA positive patients, 11 experienced a treatment-related hypersensitivity reaction during 
the study, and 4 developed positive NAb.  In part B (IV) 34 of 61 (55.7%) patients had confirmed 
positive ADA toward RC-P. Of these 34 ADA positive patients, 12 patients experienced a treatment-
related hypersensitivity reaction during the study and 2 developed positive NAb.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Given the single arm study design and the extensive co-medication (including chemotherapy) that ALL 
patients receive, interpretation of the safety data is hampered. However, the reported safety profile is 
consistent with what is known from other asparaginase.  
Seven patients were already ADA positive before RC-P treatment. All these patients became ADA 
negative at least once during study and ADA positive status did not affect SAA levels, which can be 
considered reassuring. Cross-reactivity of Enrylaze with other asparaginases has not been studied. 
Previous studies show that there is greater cross-reactivity of plasma between native E.-coli derived 
asparaginase and PeG-asparaginase than there is between native E.coli-derived asparaginase and 
Erwinia-derived asparaginase. Potential cross-reactivity of Enrylaze with other asparaginases is 
expected to be minimal. This is due to the fact that Erwinia-derived asparaginase and E. coli-derived 
asparaginase share only 70% amino acid homology and therefore, cross-reactivity with native E coli–
derived asparaginase would be expected to be low.  
Most patients included in the study are below the age of 18 years, and while there is no reason to 
expect significant in the safety profile of adults patients, the safety of RC-P in adults will be monitored 
post approval.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Clinical efficacy of recombinant crisantaspase produced in Pseudomonas fluorescens (RC-P) is claimed 
based on PD endpoints related to serum asparaginase activity in single arm pivotal Phase 2/3 Study 
JZP458-201. Asparaginase activity is considered a well-established intermediate endpoint for 
asparagine depletion and as such can support a claim of efficacy. 
The primary endpoint was not met at the intended dose level 25/25/50 nor at one of the other dose 
levels, as the lower bound of the 95% CI did not exceed the predefined target of 90%. The observed 
sustained response rate is still considered clinically relevant especially considering the target 
population of patients with ALL or LBL, who developed an allergic reaction or silent inactivation to an 
E. coli-derived asparaginase, for which no (stable supply of an) alternative asparaginase treatment 
option exists.  
Data for the IV route of administration with a M/W/F schedule indicate lower response rates compared 
to IM administration. This was expected based on the lower half life and experience with crisantaspase 
and is acceptable considering the recommended therapeutic drug monitoring for IV administration and 
potential to switch to an alternative administration route when needed. Although median response 
rates at the last 72-hour assessment do not always reach target levels, a proportion of patients still 
obtained sufficient asparaginase activity. The MWF IV regimen would allow patients and treating 
physicians to complete the regimen during the week and avoid mandatory weekend administrations. 
Moreover, the IV route of administration would allow to stop infusions immediately in case of acute 
hypersensitivity reactions and increase patient convenience when they already have a central line. The 
larger variety in SAA levels between patients with IV administration and option to switch to different 
dosing regimens is reflected in the warning regarding TDM in SmPC section 4.4. 
In general the safety profile of RC-P is in line with what is known from other asparaginase products 
and can be adequately managed with routine risk minimisation measures. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The study population, despite some limitations in terms of age groups included, and small percentage 
of patients with LBL or who had silent inactivation to E. coli-derived asparaginase, represents a 
population with limited treatment options. The observed efficacy is considered clinically relevant in this 
population. The study design also hampers comprehensive assessment of the risks associated with the 
use of Enrylaze, however, its safety profile, including common adverse reactions, can be considered 
reasonably established, also taking into account knowledge from other authorised asparaginase 
containing products.  
The benefit/risk balance is therefore considered positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Enrylaze is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations.

The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Enrylaze is not similar to Iclusig, Blincyto, Besponsa, 
Kymriah and Tecartus within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. 
See Appendix on Similarity 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
hat the benefit-risk balance of Enrylaze is favourable in the following indication: 
as a component of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) in adult and paediatric patients (1 month and 
older) who developed hypersensitivity or silent inactivation to E. coli-derived asparaginase. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
These conditions fully reflect the advice received from the PRAC.

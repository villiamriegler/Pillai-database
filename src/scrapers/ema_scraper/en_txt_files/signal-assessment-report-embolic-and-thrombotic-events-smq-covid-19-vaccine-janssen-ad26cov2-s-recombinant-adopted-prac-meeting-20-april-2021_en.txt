1.  Background 
Covid-19 Vaccine Janssen (also referred to as Ad26.COV2.S) is a monovalent, recombinant, replication 
incompetent adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vectored vaccine encoding the severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV2) spike (S) protein. 
On the 27th  Feb 2021,  the US FDA issued an emergency use authorisation for Covid-19 Janssen 
vaccine. Vaccination with Covid-19 Janssen vaccine in the US has commenced. 
It received a conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) throughout  the EU  on the 11th  March 2021 for 
the active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals aged 18 years and 
older. As of this date, initiation  of vaccination within  the  EU with  Covid-19 Janssen, has not 
commenced. 
“Venous thromboembolism” has been included as an important potential risk in the list of safety 
concerns in the risk management plan for Covid-19 Janssen vaccine. This was due to a numerical 
imbalance observed in the pivotal phase 3 trial  (VAC31518COV.3001) regarding venous 
thromboembolic events. At time of approval, data up to 22 January 2021 had been provided, and this 
numerical imbalance corresponded to 11  subjects in  the vaccine group (n=21,895)  vs. 4 in  the placebo 
group. In the vaccine group, there were: 6 DVT type events, 4  pulmonary embolism, 1 transverse 
sinus thrombosis (including 6 SAEs & 1 non-serious related AE; 8 events occurred within  28 days 
following vaccination). In the placebo group (n=21,888),  there were: 2  DVT events, 1 pulmonary 
embolism, 1 thrombosed haemorrhoid (including  1 related SAE & 1 none-related SAE, all within  28 
days of vaccination).  
Based on an overview of thromboembolic events submitted by the MAH  to the EMA  on the  29th March, 
with  a cut off of 17  March 2021, the following  summary was provided:

On the 12th  March 2021,  a signal of Embolic and Thrombotic events was confirmed for 
VAXZEVRIA/COVID-19 AstraZeneca vaccine, another adenoviral vectored vaccine. Following further 
evaluation, the focus of the signal has been on atypical coagulopathies characterised by thrombosis, 
often in unusual location, together with  thrombocytopenia. At this point  in time the signal is currently 
ongoing. 
2.  Initial evidence 
2.1.  Signal validation  
To date, three reports have been received by EMA concerning events of thrombosis co-reported with 
thrombocytopenia in  association with  Covid-19 Janssen vaccine. Of the 3 reports, one originates from 
the pivotal phase 3  trial (VAC31518COV.3001) and two concern spontaneous reports from the US. Of 
the three reports, 2  concern female patients (age ranges 38-48  & 52-62 years) while one concerns a 
male patient  (18-28  years). Of the  3 reports, one is fatal. Time to  onset included 11  days (n=2)  and 
19 days (n=1).  Thrombotic events reported included transverse sinus thrombosis, cerebral venous 
sinus thrombosis and bilateral iliac and femoral deep vein thromboses. Although  thrombocytopenia was 
reported in one case, platelet counts  were not provided. In the remaining two cases, platelet counts 
were specified as 64,000  (units  not specified) and 15,000  (units  not specified). 
The case narratives are presented below. 
-Spontaneous 
Case 1  
This serious case concerns a fatal report regarding a female patient aged between 38-48  years. Other 
illnesses at the  time of vaccination and up to one month prior included depression. Concomitant 
medications included fluoxetine. The adverse event started 7 days after vaccination. 
Diagnosis included cortical vein thrombosis, massive intracerebral haemorrhage with tentorial 
herniation and thrombocytopenia (value not specified). 
One week after receiving the  Janssen Covid-19 vaccine, the patient  developed gradually worsening 
headache. The patient presented to the hospital with  dry heaving, sudden worsening of headache and 
left-sided weakness. Evaluation with  head computed tomography (CT) revealed a large right 
temporoparietal intraparenchymal haemorrhage with 1.3cm  midline shift. She was intubated  for 
worsening mental status. On evaluation, upon arrival in the medical centre, she was noted to exhibit 
extensor posturing. Repeat imaging revealed worsening midline shift to 1.6cm.  CT angiography showed 
cortical vein thrombosis involving the right transverse and sigmoid sinus with  tentorial herniation.  The 
patient developed brain herniation. Brain death was subsequently pronounced.  
CT angiography (CTA) of the head: the supraclinoid internal carotid arteries (ICAs) are patent 
bilaterally. The right  middle cerebral artery (MCA) is elevated by the large right  hemispheric 
haematoma. There is no occlusion or significant  stenosis involving the right  MCA. The left MCA and 
bilateral anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs) are within  normal limits. The intracranial vertebral arteries, 
left posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), basilar artery and both posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs) 
are patent.  There is no aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation (AVM). The evaluation of the  venous

structures is limited on this  CTA but there is no opacification of the  right transverse and sigmoid 
sinuses suggestive of dural sinus thrombosis. 
Large right  hemispheric haematoma is demonstrated with  significant right-to-left  midline shift 
measuring approximately 16mm. Effacement of the right lateral ventricle and dilation of the left lateral 
ventricle. Right-sided  transtentorial herniation is noted. 
Impression: suspect right transverse and sigmoid sinus dural sinus thrombosis. This can be confirmed 
with  CTV (i.e. CT cerebral venography) if clinically necessary. No evidence of aneurysm of AVM to 
account for the  right hemispheric intraparenchymal haematoma. Significant right-to-left  and downward 
transtentorial herniation is noted. 
Case 2  
This serious case concerns a female patient  aged between 52-62  years. Other illnesses at the time of 
vaccination and up to  one month  prior include diarrhoea. 
Concomitant medication included (levodopa/carbidopa), (formoterol/budesonide), (clonazepam), 
(citalopram), (lemborexant), (icosapent), (diclofenac), (sumatriptan), (ropinirole), (quetiapine), 
Celecoxib, Albuterol inhaler, Omeprazole, (levothyroxine), (hydrocodone), low dose aspirin. The report 
notes that  the patient had allergies to tetracycline and vortioxetine. 
The adverse event started 11 days after vaccination. The patient  had 5  days of bruising and left  leg 
swelling prior to presenting to the emergency department. She was found to have an extensive, 
occlusive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the left lower extremity as well as thrombocytopenia of 
15,000  (units not  specified). 
That evening she had an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placed. The next day, the  patient began to have 
paraesthesia’s and discoloration of the right lower extremity. Ultrasound  showed high-grade occlusion 
of the right proximal, superficial femoral artery. The patient was pre-treated with  platelets. In addition 
to the right   superficial femoral artery (SFA) there is also thrombotic  occlusion of the bilateral iliacs. 
The patient had bilateral thrombectomy and bilateral common iliac stent  placement. The following day 
she developed gross haematuria. At the time  of the report (i.e. 28th  March 2021),  the patient had not 
recovered from the event. 
-Clinical trial case 
Case 3: 
This case concerns a male subject aged between 18-28,  with  no significant past medical history who 
was hospitalised with life threatening sinus venous transverse thrombosis and secondary cerebral 
haemorrhage, on day 19 day following vaccination with  Ad26.COV2. Concomitant medications included 
naproxen and ibuprofen. The subject was administered Ad26.COV2 in the upper left arm. Afterwards, 
the subject reported mild fatigue, nausea, headache (moderate) and myalgia along with  a fever (body 
temperature: 38.2  deg C, 101 deg F). Most  of the symptoms resolved by the  third day with  the 
exception of the headache which  eventually resolved the following day. 
On day 9,  the subject reported feeling unwell  with viral-like symptoms of  headache, fatigue, nausea, 
constipation, weakness, abdominal pain, sore throat,  mylagias, chills, shaking and fever (body 
temperature: 38.4  deg C). At that time,  he took ibuprofen (dose and times not reported). That same 
day his oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry was 94%. The next day, he began with  rhinorrhoea, 
faintness and nasal congestions and body temperature increased to 39.2 deg C.

On day 11,  he reported continued fatigue, weakness, rhinorrhoea, myalgia, faintness, abdominal pain, 
nausea and headache. He denied any other neurological symptoms. His symptoms met the protocol 
prescribed trigger for obtaining  nasal swabs for Covid-19 and swabs were collected, all of which  were 
reported negative. Upon clinical examination, he had a fever (38.4 deg C), oxygen saturation 98% and 
blood pressure 98/64mmHg.  The subject’s symptoms gradually improved without  treatment ad all 
symptoms except for the  headache had resolved over the next 7 days. The subject reported that  the 
headache improved but never completely resolved.  
 On day 19,  he experienced visual disturbances and was observed to pass out with  subsequent tonic-
clonic seizures. Upon hospitalisation, laboratory tests  included: platelet count was 64,000  (unit  and 
reference range not provided), prothrombin time (PT): 17.7,  international normalised ration (INR): 
1.46,  fibrinogen: 154,  white blood cell count: 12.4,  haemoglobin: 12.7  and haematocrit: 36.1  (units 
and normal ranges were not provided).  
A SARS-CoV-2 PCR (nasal swab) test  was not  performed as he reported two recent negative tests. 
Computed tomography (CT) scan without  contrast showed right posterior lobe haematoma 
approximately 5ml in size. CT scan with  contrast performed 2 hours later which showed an enlarged 
prior right  posterior lobe haematoma with  peripheral oedema. A CT angiography and magnetic 
resonance image (MRI) showed a cerebral haemorrhage 9right temporal occipital haematoma). The 
investigator, added that  the acute parenchymal haemorrhage in the  right posterior temporal lobe, 
measured 2.0 x2.4cm in diameter and estimated volume was 5ml.  There was no midline shift.  There 
was no evidence of hydrocephalus and no skull fracture identified. There was no acute sinusitis or 
mastoiditis. 
On (day 20),  platelet count was 60x10e3/mcL at  01.13 hours and 113 x10e3/mcL at 17.55  hours, 
prothrombin time was 15.7 seconds (NR: 11.5-15)  and INR was 1.29 (NR: 0.80-1.20).  day 21, 
peripheral blood smear showed neutrophilic  leucocytosis, no blasts were identified. Red blood cell 
count and morphology were within  normal limits  and thrombocytopenia with  rare large platelet forms 
were seen. 
During the hospitalisation, a venogram showed a clot in  the cerebral transverse sinus. The subject was 
given a diagnosis of severe transverse sinus venous thrombosis and underwent  a thrombectomy on 
(day 22).  The interventional radiologist who performed the thrombectomy reported that  the subject 
had significant stenosis in his right sigmoid sinus and thus  placing him  at high risk for thrombosis. At 
that  time an angioplasty was also performed on the stenosed sinus and treatment with  acetylsalicylic 
acid was initiated. 
On day 23,  the subject developed nausea and dizziness when standing. His  headache continued to 
worsen in  intensity and a repeat venogram was performed which showed the presence of a new clot in 
the transverse sinus resulting in recurrent occlusion of the right transverse sinus with  no flow identified 
in the sigmoid sinus or jugular bulb.  The subject then  underwent a second thrombectomy with 
venoplasty and was started on a low molecular weight  heparin for 24 hours as well as intravenous (IV) 
tissue plasminogen (tPA)  and heparin drips. MRI ruled out  arterio-venous malformation and aneurysm. 
Laboratory testing  showed that  methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mutation  test and Beta 2 
glycoprotein 1 antibodies (IgG and IgM) were negative. Lupus anticoagulant  was negative and lactate 
dehydrogenase was 304unit/L  (NR:135-225). 
On day 24,  repeat venogram showed that  the transverse sinus was free of thrombus with  brisk venous 
flow. All catheters were removed, tPA was discontinued and heparin was continued with  a plan to  begin 
apixaban.

Of note, the interventional radiologist reported observing rapid thrombus formation during the  two 
thrombectomy procedures that is consistent with  a hypercoagulable state clinically. He also stated  that 
the transverse sinus thrombosis most likely occurred days before the subject’s clinical presentation 
with  a seizure, and that the seizure was a consequence of a secondary bleed caused by the  elevated 
venous pressure from the venous flow obstruction. He  further reported that the  subject’s apparent 
hypercoagulable clinically (based on observation that  blood appeared to be reclotting  before his eyes 
during the thrombectomy) is similar to  what he has seen with  hypercoagulable COVID-19 patients. 
Another SARS-CoV2 PCR test was negative, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was 136.9 
seconds 9critical) at  17.36 hours (NR: 23.5-37.5),  fibrinogen was 274mg/dl  (NR: 200 -450), 
phospholipid IgG and IgM antibodies were negative. 
On day 25,  CT of the brain revealed right temporo-occipital haematoma which appeared slightly more 
prominent than on the previous scan. Epstein Barr-virus (EBV) IgG was positive and EBV IgM was 
negative, EBNA antibody positive, APTT was 57.0  seconds (high) at 01.09  hours, 118.8 seconds 
(critical) at 08.42  hours and 30.3  seconds at 16.22  hours. SARS-CoV2 test was negative. 
Multiple  laboratory tests were performed during the hospitalization.  
Seven days after initial hospitalization  26 days post vaccination the subject was discharged from the 
hospital on apixaban, butalbital/acetaminophen/caffeine, levetiracetam, tramadol, acetaminophen and 
aspirin to the care of the investigator. Discharge diagnosis included non-traumatic  intracerebral 
haemorrhage, transverse sinus thrombosis, seizure, thrombocytopenia (possibly naproxen induced), 
acute headache, nausea with  vomiting and constipation. At discharge, he had sore throat,  problem 
swallowing and speaking and slight  headache but no neurologic deficit.  According to the investigator 
his symptoms were improving. With  ongoing soreness and difficulty swallowing he had lost 15 pounds 
during the hospitalization.  At discharge, laboratory data included white blood cell count 9.2 x10e3/mcl, 
haemoglobin 9.9g/fl  (low), haematocrit 27.3%  (low) and platelet count 204  x10e3/mcl. It was 
reported that  individualized dose optimization technique  was used for procedures performed. The 
subject was evaluated by the  investigator on day 29. On examination he appeared weak and mildly 
febrile (37.8  degrees C) with normal blood pressure. Posterior oropharynx showed mild erythema, no 
exudate and minimal oedema peripherally. The uvula appeared normal without  oedema or erythema. 
Heart and lung exam were normal. No lymphadenopathy on head and neck exam. No rash. Pallor 
noted. This was followed by a low grade fever (99.4-99.6  degrees F) for 2-3 days. He had gained a 
couple of pounds but  continued to have a persistent mild, intermittent  headache. A barium swallow 
test (report not provided) did not show any findings  that explained his swallowing  problems. The 
assessment showed, there was no functional  reasons for swallowing and speech issues, and it was due 
to muscle fatigue. The subject was seen by a neurologist (report not  provided). The subject was seen 
by a speech therapist and he had been drinking fluids  with no issues and some issues still  existed with 
the solid food. The fatigue was getting  better and there was no fever. 
MAH’s Expert consultation within the clinical trial 
1.  Academic experts in infectious disease, haematology and neurology were consulted by the 
company. They concurred with the  diagnosis of transverse sinus thrombosis with  reactive 
cerebral haemorrhage. Individually each consultant  concluded that  the event resulted from a 
combination of factors including:  1. An anatomic abnormality of cerebral transverse sinus 
stenosis that predisposes the subject to thrombosis; 
2.  A pre-existing or secondary hypercoagulable state;

3.  An infectious event which  started on the 29 Sept 2020 (day 9) that  triggered inflammation and 
induced a hypercoagulable state or worsened a pre-existing hypercoagulable state;  
Although a specific infection  has not  been identified, and Covid-19 infection was effectively ruled out 
with  multiple negative PCR tests, the  consultants all concurred that  the viral-like symptoms from 29 
Sept 2020 through  to 08 Oct 2020  likely represented an infection that  triggered a cascade resulting in 
the event of transverse sinus thrombosis. The consultants also provided recommendations for 
continued infectious disease and haematology work up. 
The consultants also individually concluded that  there is no evidence of the study vaccine causing this 
event of cerebral sinus thrombosis with  reactive haemorrhage.  
Investigator causality assessment: The events of transverse sinus thrombosis and cerebral 
haemorrhage were not related to Ad26. Cov2. 
Company causality assessment: The events of transverse sinus thrombosis and cerebral haemorrhage 
were not  related to Ad26. Cov2.

Signal validator conclusion  
To date, three reports have been received by EMA of thrombosis co-reported with  thrombocytopenia in 
association with  Covid-19 Janssen vaccine. While the data at this stage is preliminary, it  is considered 
that  further evaluation is warranted given that  “venous thromboembolism” is listed as an important 
potential risk within  the summary of safety concerns of the RMP and that  a signal of Embolic and 
Thrombotic events is currently ongoing for VAXZEVRIA/COVID-19 AstraZeneca vaccine. However, it 
should be emphasised that a precautionary approach is being adopted. 
2.2.  Signal confirmation  
In light  of the important  potential risk in the RMP for Covid-19 Vaccine Janssen of VTE, as well as the  
raised concern regarding events of thrombosis in combination with  thrombocytopenia in association 
with  another Covid-19 adenovirus vector vaccine, the MAH was, on 26 March 2021,  asked the 
following:  
Study VAC31518COV3001 
• 
For the cases of thrombosis reported in this  clinical trial,  following review of narratives 
summarised in a document on AESI, it  is noted in  no laboratory data are available. Please 
provide all available data for all cases of thrombosis as well as bleeding reported in the clinical 
trial, and it  is of particular importance to  obtain any measurements of complete blood count 
including platelets.   
• 
Please provide summaries of thrombocyte levels in subjects in the study,  and for subjects with 
thrombocytopenia, please provide case narratives.  
 Current post marketing  experience

• 
• 
Please provide an estimate on the  current post  marketing use.  
Please provide a cumulative review of cases of thrombosis in combination with 
thrombocytopenia reported in the post marketing setting.  
On 29 March, the MAH  provided a short response which included case narratives for all thrombotic 
events, but not for the bleeding events.  
Due to  inconsistencies in the  response such as it was stated that  there was no case in study  
VAC31518COV3001 of thrombosis in  combination with thrombocytopenia, while it  was evident from the 
case narrative (see description above), that  the man developing transverse sinus thrombosis also had 
thrombocytopenia. .   
As a follow up to that,  MAH  was agreed to provide additional information from an ongoing review of the 
individual case reports of thrombotic  and thromboembolic events for concurrent occurrence of 
thrombocytopenia.  
On 31 March, the MAH  provided the following:   
The following methodology was used to assess if reports of thrombotic or thromboembolic events also 
included thrombocytopenia. 
Janssen’s Global Medical Safety (GMS) Database was first searched using the below search criteria and 
identified 132  reports: 
• 
• 
• 
SMQ Hematopoietic cytopenias 
SMQ Haemorrhages 
SMQ Embolic and thrombotic events 
Text string search of the case reports showed, 15  of 132  cases had platelet  counts reported (some had 
actual lab values, and some had statements that  just said “platelet counts normal” with  no actual labs 
values specified). Of these: 
• 
• 
8 of 15 reports had platelet counts  in normal range    
7 of 15 had platelet counts that  were low  
Of the 7 reports with  low platelet  counts, 1 was a spontaneous report and 6 were from trials (3 
placebo/2 active/1 blinded) 
Of the 4 cases that  had low platelet counts reported on active (2), blinded (1), or spontaneous (1), 
only one case reported a thromboembolic event along with  confirmed thrombocytopenia as 
summarized below. 
Clinical trial case on active (see detailed narrative description above):  a male subject between the 
ages of 18-28  experienced transverse sinus thrombosis resulting  in cerebral haemorrhage on Day 19 
after receiving a single dose of blinded study vaccine (Day 1)  for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 virus 
infection.  After experiencing flu-like illness starting  Day 9, the subject was hospitalized on Day 19 
following a tonic-clonic seizure. Upon hospitalization,  his platelet count was 64,000  with  a nadir of 60k. 
Upon discharge his platelet count  was normal at 334. 
The remaining 3 case summaries are provided below for completeness:

Spontaneous case: a female between the  ages of 65-75 with  COPD, smoker experienced “low platelet 
count” 5  days after receiving vaccine.  Platelet count  was reported as 138k (LL  Normal is 150k).  No 
symptoms/other events reported. 
Clinical trial case blinded:  A female between the ages of 63-73  hospitalized for Pancytopenia and 
determined to  have Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) 135  days after first  vaccine dose and 6 days after 
second dose. She had a grade 3 platelet count  of 26k.  
Clinical trial case on active: a male between the ages of 65-75,  who experienced COVID-19, Acute 
kidney injury, embolism venous ad Hypoxia. On 35 days post vaccination he had the  acute kidney 
injury, venous embolism, and hypoxia. The platelet count  in this participant  was not  verifiable as it  was 
reported as “11.7”  with no normal range or units. 
MAH  Conclusion:  
The review of cases of thrombotic  or thromboembolic events and low platelets revealed that there is 
only one case report that  has both  a thrombotic  or thromboembolic event and low platelets as 
described above. 
On 2 April 2021; the  MAH submitted  the following summary regarding thrombotic  and thromboembolic 
events from spontaneous reporting irrespective of thrombocytopenia:  
A search of Janssen’s Global Medical Safety (GMS) Database was performed on 31 March 2021 for 
completed spontaneous cases using the Standardised MedDRA Query (SMQ) of Embolic and thrombotic 
events. 
The search identified 13 serious spontaneous case reports (0 non-serious case reports) with  the 
following 14 events from the  SMQ: 
2 Pulmonary embolism (PE); 
1 Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (this patient  also experienced a Pulmonary embolism); 
3 Myocardial infarction (MI); 
5 Cerebrovascular accident (CVA); 
1 Hemiparesis; 
1 Hemiplegia; 
1 Blindness transient; 
Case specifics are detailed in Table 1 below and CIOMS forms were provided.  
Pulmonary embolism: Both cases were reported from health care providers. For the 2 cases, one 
case had a risk factor of family history of PE and DVT; the  other had minimal information to make a 
meaningful medical assessment. 
Deep  Vein  Thrombosis: One of the  above Pulmonary embolism cases also reported an associated 
DVT; the  patient had risk factors of family history of PE and DVT. 
Myocardial infarction: All 3 cases were reported from non-health care providers. Two of the 3 cases 
had diagnostics that were negative for myocardial infarction. The third  case had a fatal outcome with 
insufficient information (no diagnostics reported) to  make a meaningful medical assessment.

Vaccine Janssen (Ad26.COV2-S [recombinant]) 
EMA/268126/2021  
Page 11/99 
 
 
 
 
 
Cerebrovascular accident: All 5 cases were reported from non-health  care providers. Two had 
minimal information reported. Two provided risk factors for stroke, including age in the 80s. One fatal 
case has an autopsy pending to  provide a final diagnosis with  cause of death. 
Hemiparesis:  This case was reported from a non-health care provider who described left  sided 
weakness on the side of injection. There was no diagnosis of CVA, and the subject quickly recovered on 
the same day. 
Hemiplegia:  This case was reported from a non-health care provider who described “mild 
hemipalegia” [sic] at  injection site with “sore arm” and “injection site stinging”.  No 
suggestion/diagnosis of CVA was made. 
Blindness transient:  This case was reported from a non-health care provider. No  diagnosis of CVA 
was made. No medical care was sought, and the patient  recovered.  
MAH  Conclusion: The search of the Global Medical Safety Database resulted in cases with  limited 
information. Only one of the cases had a confirmed diagnosis reported from a physician who described 
a single patient with  DVT/PE with  known risk factors. No other cases had medically confirmed 
diagnoses. Based on the currently available information and/or lack of diagnostic evidence for the 
reported events, no conclusions can be reached from this dataset.

MAH’s Estimated post marketing  exposure:   
According to the  CDC (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations), 3,215,657  doses of 
the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine were administered as of March 31, 2021. 
PRAC Rapporteur comment: 
At the approval of the CMA on 11 March 2021,  “Venous thromboembolism” was included as important 
potential risk in the RMP, due to a numerical imbalance of venous thromboembolism observed in the 
main clinical study, VAC31518COV3001.  
On 12 March 2021,  a signal procedure regarding thrombotic  and embolic events was started for 
another adenovirus vector Covid-19 vaccine, which is currently ongoing. During the  assessment of this 
signal, very rare cases showing a combination of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, and in some cases 
accompanied by bleeding, have gained particular attention.   
For the Covid-19 Vaccine Janssen, we are currently aware of three cases with  such unusual 
characteristics. This includes one case with  concomitant thrombosis and thrombocytopenia in study 
VAC31518COV3001 and two post-marketing cases with  concomitant thrombosis and 
thrombocytopenia, which  have been reported from the US market. Of the  three reports, 2 concern 
female patients  while  one concerns a male patient.  Of the 3 reports, one is fatal. Time to onset 
included 11 days (n=2)  and 19 days (n=1).  Thrombotic events reported included transverse sinus 
thrombosis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and bilateral iliac and femoral deep vein thromboses. 
Although thrombocytopenia was reported in one case, platelet counts were not  provided. In the 
remaining two cases, platelet counts were specified as 64,000 (units  not specified) and 15,000 (units 
not specified). For further details of these cases, see above.

Some preliminary information has also been received from the MAH during  the last days of March / 
first days of April; namely in short: 
• 
• 
The post marketing exposure is estimated to approximately 3.2 million doses by 31 March; 
A review of the  MAH safety data base regarding thrombotic and thromboembolic events from 
spontaneous reporting irrespective of thrombocytopenia, resulted in identification  of 13  serious 
spontaneous case reports (0 non-serious case reports). For many of these, limited information 
was available. None described a combination of thrombocytopenia.  
• 
The review of cases of thrombotic  or thromboembolic events and low platelets revealed that 
there is only one case report that has both a thrombotic or thromboembolic event and low 
platelets. 
Taken together, there are currently three cases of thrombosis together with  thrombocytopenia within 
the clinical trial and post marketing data base, having occurred within  2 -3 weeks after vaccination 
with  Covid-19 vaccine Janssen. For the two  post marketing cases, information is relatively limited. 
Nevertheless, taking into  account that  VTE is an important potential risk in the RMP, and there are in 
total three reports, it is considered warranted to further review thrombotic and embolic events SMQ 
within  a signal prompt procedure.  
Given that  there are three cases of this  unusual clinical picture, it may be considered warranted to 
already as a first step update the product information with  a short description of the observed cases as 
well as advice to prescribers and vaccinated individuals.  
2.3.  Proposed recommendation 
The MAH should address the following: 
1.  The cumulative post-marketing exposure, divided by age groups if available. 
2.  Presentation of retrieved laboratory values on complete blood count  including platelets for 
cases with  venous or arterial thrombosis in all clinical studies with  the Covid-19 vaccine 
Janssen. 
3.  Presentation of retrieved laboratory values on complete blood count  including platelets for 
cases with  bleeding in  all clinical studies with  the Covid-19 vaccine Janssen 
4.  A cumulative review of cases observed in clinical studies with  the Covid-19 vaccine Janssen; in 
clinical studies with  other vaccines using the same Ad26 platform as well as post-marketing 
cases occurring within  a month  after vaccination reporting  
a.  Thrombosis (any) 
b.  thrombosis (any) and concomitant thrombocytopenia/low platelet count 
c. 
thrombocytopenia/low platelet count regardless of symptoms 
The presentation should include concomitant  disease and medications, COVID-19-testing, time 
to onset, clinical course and outcome and diagnostic work-up, as available.

5.  Discussion on potential  causal relationship between vaccination with  Covid-19 vaccine Janssen 
and the events of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, addressing possible mechanisms. This 
should include any support from non-clinical data and address any potential  role of the 
adenoviral gene transfer vector. 
6.  The MAH view on whether the current data warrant for further updates of the product 
information as well  as if there is a need for additional  risk minimisation measures. [to be 
adapted depending on proposed option below] 
7.  The MAH is asked to address how this  issue can be further studied both in the  non-clinical and 
clinical setting.   
Regarding the next steps and timelines; there are different options such as:  
-  During the PRAC April Meeting, agree a short warning statement (SmPC section 4.4, and 
section 2 of the package leaflet) describing the observed cases, and include advice to 
prescribers and vaccinated individuals. Adopt the  above questions and continue the  signal 
procedure, possibly by further conclusions at the  PRAC meeting in May. A draft wording for 
section 4.4 is given below.  
-  Adopt the above questions during the PRAC meeting in  April, and ask the  MAH to respond 
promptly, to allow for further PRAC discussion on approximately 15 April or at PRAC ORGAM on 
22 April with  the aim to agree preliminary conclusions, including  potential label updates.  
Draft proposal for section 4.4  
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders  
A combination of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia has been observed very rarely following 
vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. This includes thrombosis at unusual sites such as cerebral 
venous sinus thrombosis, and fatal outcome. The majority of these cases occurred within  the first two 
to three weeks following vaccination.   
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and or 
thrombocytopenia. Those vaccinated should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention  if they 
develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain 
following vaccination. Additionally, anyone with  neurological symptoms including  severe or persistent 
headaches or blurred vision after vaccination, or who experiences skin bruising (petechia) beyond the 
site of vaccination after a few days, should seek prompt medical attention.   
Package leaflet – to be updated accordingly.  
2.4.  Comments from other PRAC members  
Please  find  here  below  comments  from  a  member  state  regarding  this  signal  assessment  report  on 
Embolic  and  Thrombotic  events  (SMQ)  in  association  with  COVID-19  Janssen  Vaccine  (Ad26.COV2-S 
[recombinant]) (EPITT 19689). 
In  order  to  have  the  same  level  of  information  in  the  Signal  assessment  report  on  embolic  and 
thrombotic  events  (SMQ)  with  COVID-19  Vaccine,  Janssen  could  be  asked  to  provide  the  same

scientific reflections/discussions on the non-clinical data as those asked for Vaxzevria. This would allow 
to study the mechanistic aspect in a more extensive way. 
Proposal  for  new  pre-clinical  studies  after  assessment  of  the  possible  mechanistic  explanations  The 
MAH  should address the following: 
[...] 
5.  Discussion  on  potential  causal  relationship  between  vaccination  with  Covid-19  vaccine  Janssen  and 
the  events  of  thrombosis and  thrombocytopenia,  addressing  possible  mechanisms.  This  should  include 
any  support  from  non-clinical  data  and  address  any  potential  role  of  the  adenoviral  gene  transfer 
vector. 
- The MAH should propose a study to test in-vitro expression of the S protein of Janssen vaccine (these 
are  already  available  for  the  other  already authorised  SARS-CoV-2  vaccines  with  a  different  S  protein 
without  showing concerns). 
- The MAH should  consider to perform in-vitro study  to test  the interaction of the Janssen vaccine with 
blood  components  (i.e.  thrombocytes,  erythrocytes,  leucocytes  etc.,  coagulation  factors,  natural  IgM 
antibodies)  both  in  the  presence  and  absence  of  pre-existing  immunity  to  recombinant,  replication-
incompetent adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vector. 
- The MAH should consider collecting more extensive non-clinical data namely but not limited  to animal 
models.  The  MAH  should  provide  further  animal  data  namely  on Ad26  vector.  The  potential  effects  of 
Ad26 vector to human should also be addressed. 
-  The  MAH  should  propose  further  studies  to  elucidate  the  role  of  the  spike  antigen  in  these  events 
specifically  whether  the  Spike  protein  is  antigenic  (i.e.  taking  the  role  of  heparin  and  binding  with 
platelet factor 4). 
-  The  MAH  should  propose  any  further  non-clinical  studies  aimed  at  elucidating  the  mechanism  that 
trigger platelet activation and subsequent thrombotic effects. 
PRAC rapporteur comments; these comments have been taken into account in the updated LoQ.  
Late breaking information submitted to EMA 
Within  the context of the oral explanation that  was provided by Janssen-Cilag International NV  to the 
PRAC on the 7th April 2021, the  MAH referred to a case of cerebral thrombosis. Of, note the MAH 
specified that  the case was subject to limited information and that  at that  point it  had not  yet been 
adjudicated as to whether the  cerebral thrombosis concerned arterial or venous thrombosis. They also 
specified that  no information regarding platelet count had been received. 
On the 8th of April, the  MAH sent a CIOMS form concerning the  case in question. 
A description of the case is provided below: 
Case  concerns  a  female  patient  between  the  ages  of  18-28  from  the  US  which  was  received  from  a 
pharmacist.  The  patient  had  no  known  allergies,  was  a  non-smoker,  was  not  on  any  concomitant 
medications  including  combined  oral  contraceptives,  had  no  medical  history  or  familial  history  of 
clotting  disorders.

16  days  after  the  vaccination  she  developed  headache,  vomiting  and  mental  status  changes.  Her 
family noted she was “staring” or “spacey”. She was brought to the hospital where MRI and CT scan of 
the brain revealed sagittal sinus thrombosis and haemorrhage. She was admitted to ICU. Platelet count 
on  presentation  was  18,000  (units  no t  specified),  fibrinogen  was  noted  to   be  low  and   fibrin  D-dimer 
was  elevated.  Platelet  count  remains  at  22,000  to  24,000.  Sixteen  days  after  vaccination,  the  patient 
developed seizures, was intubated, sedated and placed on unspecified anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). She 
was  treated  according  to  the  “British  Guidelines”,  was  given  a  platelet  transfusion  in  advance  of 
thrombectomy and was anticoagulated (specific agent not provided). Following platelet  transfusion and 
thrombectomy, the patient’s p latelet count rose to 160,000, fibrinogen normalised, and both remained 
stable  for  1-2  days.  Treatment  with  un-specified  AEDs  was  continued.  The  patient  remained  intubated 
and sedated and thus her mental and neurologic status was not re-evaluated. At the time of the report 
it  was  noted  that  the  patient  had  recovered  from thrombocytopenia,  but  the  outcome  of  sagittal  sinus 
thrombosis, cerebral haemorrhage and seizures was not reported.  
PRAC  rapporteur  comments; this is another case with an unusual clinical picture of a serious sagittal 
sinus thrombosis, in combination with  thrombocytopenia, occurring in a healthy young woman, about 2 
weeks  after  vaccination.  This  case  strengthens  the  current  signal  in  need  of  further  prompt  in  depth 
review.   
2.5.  Adopted PRAC recommendation 
Having considered the available evidence from both  spontaneous reports and clinical trials, the  PRAC 
has agreed that at this  stage, there is insufficient  evidence to warrant an update to  the product 
information. Nevertheless, there are a number of issues in relation to  thrombotic and embolic events 
that  need further review, and therefore the signal procedure should proceed.  
The MAH for COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen (Janssen-Cilag International NV) is therefore requested to 
submit, responses to the  following list of questions: 
- 
- 
- 
The cumulative post-marketing exposure, stratified by age, if feasible. 
Presentation of retrieved laboratory values on complete blood counts  including, but  not limited 
to, platelets, anti-platelet  factor 4 antibodies, fibrinogen, ADAMTS13, anti-phospholipid 
antibodies and D-dimer, for cases with venous or arterial thrombosis in all clinical studies with 
the Covid-19 vaccine Janssen.  
Presentation of retrieved laboratory values on complete blood counts  including, but  not limited 
to platelets, anti-platelet  factor 4 antibodies for cases of haemorrhage in all clinical studies with 
the Covid-19 vaccine Janssen 
-  A detailed cumulative review of cases observed in clinical studies with i) the Covid-19 vaccine 
Janssen; ii) other vaccines using the same Ad26 platform; as well as of iii) cases originating 
from the  post-marketing setting  of  
a.  thrombosis (any);  
b.  thrombosis (any) and concomitant thrombocytopenia/low platelet count;   
c. 
thrombocytopenia/low platelet count regardless of symptoms 
The presentation should include all available information regarding concomitant  disease and 
medications, COVID-19 testing,  time to onset, clinical course and outcome and diagnostic work-up, as 
available. Full  case narratives should also be provided.  
-  Observed to expected analyses of cases of  
a.  Cerebral venous thrombosis without  thrombocytopenia (i.e. using all relevant PTs such 
as cerebral venous thrombosis, superior sagittal  sinus thrombosis, transverse sinus

thrombosis, aseptic cavernous sinus thrombosis, cerebral venous thrombosis and also 
events of cerebral thrombosis that are adjudicated to be related to venous thrombosis), 
also stratified  by age bands (i.e. 10  years) should be provided. Background rates for 
events of CVST without  thrombocytopenia should be used within  the analysis. 
b.  Cerebral venous thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (i.e. using all relevant PTs such as 
cerebral venous thrombosis, superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, transverse sinus 
thrombosis, aseptic cavernous sinus thrombosis, cerebral venous thrombosis and also 
events of cerebral thrombosis that are adjudicated to be related to venous thrombosis), 
also stratified  by age bands (i.e.10  years), should be provided. Background rates for 
CVST with  thrombocytopenia should be used within  the analysis.  
-  Discussion on potential  causal relationship between vaccination with  Covid-19 vaccine Janssen 
and the events of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, addressing possible pathophysiological 
mechanism, including  potential for platelet activation. This should include all relevant non-
clinical data and clinical data and address any potential role of the adenoviral gene transfer 
vector. 
- 
The MAH is asked to discuss how, beyond the  already agreed studies in  the PhV plan, the 
important potential  risk venous thromboembolism, including the  potential occurrence of the 
combination of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia can be further studied. Ways of gaining 
further mechanistic data, both non-clinical and clinical, regarding potential  interactions of the 
Covid-19 vaccine Janssen and the coagulation system should specifically be addressed; and the 
following commented:  
-  Study the in-vitro expression of the  spike protein of the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine, and the 
relative proportions of the  spike protein expressed in the  pre-fusion and post-fusion state 
after administration of the vaccine.  
-  Study the interaction of the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine with  blood components such as 
thrombocytes, erythrocytes, leucocytes etc., as well as coagulation factors, natural IgM 
antibodies; both in the  presence and absence of pre-existing immunity  to recombinant, 
replication-incompetent adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vector.  
-  Discuss how additional  non-clinical as well as human studies can provide further data 
regarding potential  effects of the i) Ad26 vector; ii)  the spike protein on the coagulation 
system, including potential triggers of platelet activation and subsequent thrombotic 
effects. This should include addressing whether the Ad26 vector may active platelets via 
interaction with  the cell adhesion molecule CAR (i.e. coxsackie and adenovirus receptors), 
or affect the structure of PF4 
- 
For on-going clinical studies, should cases of thrombocytopenia and/or thrombosis occur, a 
thorough laboratory testing  should be performed including,  but not limited  to: complete 
blood count incl platelets, haemolysis parameters, D-dimer, fibrinogen, PTT, PT/INR, 
antiphospholipid antibodies and anti-PF4  antibodies.  
-  Considering the  findings of the review, the MAH  should discuss the  need for amendment to  the 
Product Information and/or Risk management plan, for the  latter, including, but  not limited to, 
the list  of safety concerns and studies specified within  the pharmacovigilance plan.  
The PRAC will perform the assessment within  a 30-day timeframe.

3.  Additional evidence  
3.1.  Assessment of additional data  
On 15 April 2021, the  MAH submitted  responses to Question 1-8 outlined above. Furthermore, on 15 
April 2021, the PRAC Rapporteur has received Eudravigilance data and analyses from the EMA.  The 
latter was updated on 17 April 2021.  
The PRAC Rapporteur assessment to be sent to the PRAC on 19  April 2021,  is the first step in the 
further evaluation of this  signal. As agreed with  the EMA on 15 April 2021,  the aim of this  first step is 
to review of cases of unusual thrombosis in combination with  thrombocytopenia, and taking experience 
gained from a recently finalised signal evaluation 2, and based on that,  evaluate the need for updates of 
the product information, as well as the  need for additional risk minimisation measures. For the AR to 
be sent out on 19 April, 17 April 2021 is the  cut-off for new data. 
A more in-depth evaluation of any mechanistic aspects, as well as of the  pharmacovigilance plan, and 
thereby the  responses to Q7, will be undertaken in the second step of the  assessment of the  MAH 
responses. In addition, review of laboratory results from clinical studies and post-marketing on 
conditions not  predominantly related to  the combination of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia will be 
assessed in more depth in the  second step as well.   
A timeline for that  second step is to be finally agreed, but tentatively planned for the PRAC meeting in 
May 2021. 
3.1.1.  MAH response as of 15th April 2021

It is important to  note that as many of the clinical studies are currently ongoing, the clinical database 
and the GMS database have not  been fully reconciled, hence the number of SAEs reported may differ 
depending on the source. Whereas a search of the clinical database will provide information on both 
cases of nonserious AEs and SAEs, the GMS database will  only contain reports of SAEs. 
Post-marketing safety assessment of AEs spontaneously reported have well-known limitations  that 
often preclude an accurate and meaningful medical assessment, including: insufficient case detail such 
as clinical course/laboratory data/ diagnostics, lack of medical accuracy due to non-health care 
provider reporters (e.g. consumers/patients), and an inability to  follow-up secondary to multiple 
factors such as contact details or reluctance by reporters to provide authorization or contacting the 
health care provider. Data obtained from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CDC’s co-
managed US national Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), which is the principal source 
of spontaneously reported AEs, has an unspecified delay in data entry from time  of receipt by the  FDA, 
which in  turn delays visualization by the  company. Case details can only be obtained following Freedom 
of Information Act request by the  company and have an undefined time  period before being released). 
Search Criteria 
A comprehensive search was performed on the  Janssen's Global Medical Safety (GMS) Database and 
the Janssen Clinical Databases for adverse events of interest using the following Standardised MedDRA 
Query (SMQ) version 23.1  broad search terms, where applicable (the clinical database and the GMS 
database have not  been fully reconciled, hence the number of SAEs reported may differ depending on 
the source. Whereas a search of the clinical database will  provide information on both cases of 
nonserious adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), the GMS database will only 
contain serious events (SAEs):

The search was performed on the following  clinical trials databases, containing both serious adverse 
events (SAEs) and non-serious adverse events (AEs): 
The data lock points (DLP) used for the  searches performed in the different databases where the 
following: COV1001 (DLP 01 April 2021);  COV1002 (DLP 31  March 2021) – Data are blinded;  
COV2001 (DLP 17 March 2021)  – Data are blinded; COV3001 (DLP 24  March 2021); COV3009 (DLP 01 
April 2021) – Data are blinded; The Ad26 Platform Clinical Database (AdVac report, Version 6.0, DLP 
31 December 2020). The post-marketing reports for Ad26.COV2.S had a DLP 09  April 2021.  EBL1007, 
EBL2004,  EBL2006, EBL2008,  EBL2007,  EBL2009,  EBL3008, EBL3010  and EBL4002  (DLP 09  April 
2021). 
Laboratory Results 
In the clinical trials, analysis of blood count, including platelets was not  routinely performed, except in 
the phase 1 studies COV1001 (only abnormality flag, no actual values) and COV1002 where baseline 
and post-vaccination samples were collected for Laboratory assessments. Protocols do specify that 
abnormal laboratory values, when  available, are reported as unsolicited  adverse events (AEs). Overall, 
in most cases of venous or arterial thrombosis (reported as AE or SAE) complete blood count including 
platelets is not be available. The MAH has contacted the study sites to retrieve possible individual 
laboratory data from source document. Analysis of the  available data showed limited reports of 
thrombocytopenia and other coagulopathies. 
To address the important potential  risk of venous thromboembolism data generated in  COV2001 will be 
used to assess potential vaccine-induced anti phospholipid  syndrome and potential  vaccine-induced 
activation of coagulation in adults aged 18  to ≤55 years and adults  aged ≥65 years. Protocol required 
hematology laboratory assessments include Lupus anticoagulants,  Anti-β2 glycoprotein, Anti cardiolipin 
and D-dimer. Results of the ongoing study COV2001 are expected to become available at the  end of 
April 2021.

QUESTION  1 
 The Cumulative  post-marketing exposure,  stratified by age,  if feasible. 
Janssen cumulative (US) post-marketing exposure according to the Center of Disease Control (CDC) as 
of the 15 April 2021, is a total  of 7,688,499  doses of the  COVID-19 vaccine Janssen. As of 12 April 
2021  (of a total  of 6,453,740  doses), it is estimated, that  approximately 66.5.% of recipients of the 
Janssen COVID-19 vaccine were in the 18  to 59 -year age group and approximately 33.5% of 
recipients were in the ≥60-year age group. Age group percentages are derived from the exposure 
numbers published daily by the CDC at https://covid.cdc.gov/coviddata-tracker/#vaccination-
demographic. 
The percentages are based on: 
Calculation of post-marketing exposure, stratified by age, according to the CDC is based on the  overall 
age group percentages across all COVID-19 vaccines authorized for us in the US, and therefore may 
not represent the  best current estimate of the actual age by distribution  for the COVID-19 vaccine 
Janssen. 
COVID-19 vaccine Janssen received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in the  US on 27 
February 2021,  and vaccination of the US population initiated  on 08 March 2021.  As of 13 April 2021,  a 
total of approximately 2,489,153  individuals are within  the 21-day post vaccination period. The 
company estimates that  more than 100,000  individuals were being vaccinated each day in the  US with 
COVID-19 vaccine Janssen immediately prior to the pause initiated  on 13 April 2021. As of 12 April 
2021:  Janssen has 6 post-authorization cases of CVST (4  of 6 with  low platelets, 2 unknown)  with 6.8 
million individuals vaccinated.

Table 3  relates to the Ad26 platform exposure data from all completed and ongoing clinical trials using 
Ad26-based vaccines excluding COVID-19 (see Table 1 for COVID-19). The table relates to the Ad26 
platform exposure data for the Janssen Collaborative Ebola studies, including  the Ebola vaccination 
campaign in  Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC-EB-001 / VAC52150EBL3008) and Rwandan 
government-led Ebola vaccination campaign under conditional approval (UMURINZI / 
VAC52150EBL4002)  with  cut-off dates for individual studies/programs provided, as listed in the GMS 
safety database. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment 
Regarding cumulative (US) post-marketing exposure, the MAH refers to the  Center of Disease Control 
(CDC), which reports a total  of 7,688,499  doses of the  COVID-19 vaccine Janssen being used as of 15 
April 2021.  
As of 12  April 2021  (of a total  of 6,453,740  doses), it  is estimated, that  approximately 66.5.%  of 
recipients of the  Janssen COVID-19 vaccine were in the 18 to 59  -year age group and approximately

33.5%  of recipients were in the  ≥60-year age group. However, this  estimation appears based on use of 
all vaccines, and is therefore uncertain.   
The MAH has also specified the approximate number of individuals being within  the 21-day post 
vaccination period as of 13 April; namely 2,489,153  individuals. Although not entirely clear what is 
meant, review of the cumulative presentation above, this exact number of subjects appear to  have 
been vaccinated more than three weeks ago, and thus possibly having past the main risk window for 
this unusual  clinical event.  
By end of March 2021, the  clinical study exposure is estimated to about 286  000 subjects with  the 
Covid-19 Vaccine Janssen, and more than  200 000  individuals with the  Ad26 platform. However, it 
should be noted that the  vast majority of these data for the Covid-19 vaccine Janssen have not  yet 
been assessed by EMA. In the evaluation supporting the CMA on 11 March 2021,  approximately 27,200 
vaccinated subjects had been assessed in clinical studies for death and SAEs  3, and is thus the  most 
relevant clinical study safety database.  
QUESTION  2.  
Presentation  of retrieved  laboratory values  on complete blood counts including, but not 
limited to, platelets, anti-platelet  factor 4 antibodies, fibrinogen, ADAMTS13, anti-
phospholipid antibodies and D-dimer, for cases with venous or arterial thrombosis in all 
clinical studies with the  Covid-19 vaccine Janssen. 
In the clinical studies (COV1001, COV1002, COV2001, COV3001, COV3009), under the SMQ term 
“Embolic and thrombotic events”, the following events have been reported: 33 cases were reported 
among 22,218 (0.1%)  participants that  received Ad26COV2.S vaccine at the 5x1010 vp dose level. 1 
case was reported among 319 (0.3%)  participants that  received Ad26COV2.S vaccine at 1x1011 vp 
dose level. 26 cases were reported among 22,051  (0.1%)  participants that received placebo. 18 cases 
were reported among 25,537  (0.1%)  participants that  are blinded to treatment. Refer to Table 4 below 
for further details. Among those cases, the number of cases of venous or arterial thrombosis have 
been retrieved from the clinical trials and are summarized in Table 5. 
For each study (COV1001,  COV1002, COV2001, COV3001, COV3009) the number of subjects with  an 
AE of Interest System Organ Class and Preferred Term are presented in the  Subject Listings  within  the 
3 EPAR  for COVID-19  Vaccine Janssen, INN-Ad26.COV2-S,  recombinant (europa.eu)

Appendices. Table 5 provides the number of cases of embolic and thrombotic events of interest. As 
already reported for the COV3001 clinical study results (the  main efficacy trial), there is a numerical 
imbalance for DVT cases with  the Ad26COV2.S vaccine (10  cases in the Ad26 5x1010 recipients, 1 
case in Ad26 1x1011  recipient, 2  cases that are still  blinded and 3 cases in the placebo arm). For 
CVST, there was no imbalance in terms of cases reported in the clinical trials. Nevertheless, as stated 
in answer to Question 8, venous thromboembolism (VTE) is considered an Important Potential Risk for 
the EU-RMP,  and relevant events for VTE have been identified and are monitored as Adverse Events of 
Special Interest (AESI). Please refer also to Question 4 for further description of thrombosis events.

In most cases of venous or arterial thrombosis (reported as AE or SAE) complete blood count including 
platelets is not available. The MAH  has contacted the study sites to  retrieve possibly individual 
laboratory data from source document. For  arterial and venous thrombosis cases, available data are 
presented  and no conclusion can be drawn from the  limited available information. Finally, for studies 
COV1001 and COV1002 complete blood counts, including  platelets was performed at baseline and 
post-vaccination timepoints. For both  studies, only normal or abnormality status are collected for pre 
and post vaccination timepoints.  The results are available for study COV1001 and described below. 
Analysis of the laboratory assessments performed in the COV1001 clinical study revealed that there 
were no trends/abnormalities observed in platelet  numbers as compared to placebo at Day 8 (7 days 
post-dose 1) or at  Day 57 and Day 64 (post-dose 2). Similar there was no trend/abnormalities in  levels 
of activated partial thromboplastin  time or in prothrombin time (Table 4). It should be noted that  these 
reported laboratory values are not reported as consequence of an adverse event but  are used to  see 
trends when comparing pre and post-vaccination timepoints.  Overall, there is no impact  of the vaccine 
on platelet counts: there was no notable change in platelets counts  observed at the post vaccination 
timepoints.

The Study Coordinator said that since the 
subject only went to the ER and the event was 
an AE, they had not requested medical records 
and do not have the local lab results for the 
platelets and coagulation parameters (PT/PTT, 
bleeding time etc). The study coordinator has 
requested the records right after her 
conversation with the CRA and will send us 
any updated information once received.

PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment 
There are some issues with  regards to the presentation of data that hamper further assessment of the 
cases with  venous or arterial thrombosis in the clinical studies with  the Covid-19 vaccine Janssen.  
In Table 5 above, there were 13  subjects with  thromboembolic AEs of interest in the Ad26COV2.S 
vaccine group, including various venous thromboses and peripheral artery thrombosis in study 3001; 
apparently, there were 19  additional cases reporting embolic and thrombotic events in the 
Ad26COV2.S group in study 3001  based on Table 4;  for completeness, the  MAH should summarize the 
main reasons for not  including the additional cases among AEs of interest (RSI).  Also, only 8 cases 
with  thromboembolic events are included in Table 6,  and there is one case apparently missing from the 
summary in Table 5 (according to table 6,  there is one case report of a 65-78-year-old female with 
cerebrovascular accident, with no lab results). 
In table 6, laboratory results for 18 subjects in the  clinical trials with  vein and arterial thrombotic 
events are presented: for the majority of cases, however, no such data are available. For 2 cases, 
there is no summary of relevant laboratory data but  only a reference to appended CIOMS forms. In 
four additional subjects, laboratory values are reported. Notably, for any patient  diagnosed with  any 
thromboembolic event, collection of lab tests  including platelets is expected. It is unclear if the cases in

table 6 pertain to those who received the Ad26COV2.S vaccine only (for all cases in study 3001,  these 
data are not included in  this table although that  study has been unblinded).   
For 3 of the 4 cases with  laboratory values reported, platelet  counts were normal. However, there is 
one additional case with  concomitant thrombosis and thrombocytopenia in Table 6:  a male between 
the ages of 55-65  who presented with  thrombocytopenia (platelet  levels 141) 15  days after 
vaccination; he was hospitalised 21 days after vaccination with deep vein thrombosis. Based on 
additional values, it  is possible that  this patient  was treated with  a vitamin K antagonist (INR was 2.1) 
unless he had severe co-morbidities such as liver failure (which could potentially also cause 
thrombocytopenia) or severe dietary vitamin K insufficiency. No CIOMS-report has been provided; 
based on the very short narrative of this case, reported co-morbidities included obesity and 
depression, and he received the Ad26COV2.S vaccine (i e not  placebo). There are no lab tests  at all in 
the narrative for this case, however, it is stated that  the patient was treated with  rivaroxaban following 
his DVT; since rivaroxaban would not  be used in patients  with severe liver failure, the INR value is 
assumed to be related to anticoagulant therapy at the time of his thrombosis. 
This case should obviously have been presented within  the case reports of concomitant thrombosis and 
thrombocytopenia in  the clinical trials, regardless of concomitant disease and treatment. Such case 
reports have been requested several times from the  MAH. Notably, should this  case pertain to venous 
thrombosis with  thrombocytopenia in a patient treated with  therapeutic anticoagulation, this  is 
remarkable and should likely have prompted further medical attention;  lab values should likely be 
available. In table 6, the MAH  refers to an attachment which has not been found. Full  details on this 
case including  complete CIOMS report should be provided (immediate  RSI). 
Questions were raised regarding laboratory results from clinical studies and from post-marketing data, 
regarding e.g. thrombocytopenia. Further data presentation is asked for to allow final assessment of 
whether thrombocytopenia without  thrombosis or bleeding, may be caused by the Covid-19 vaccine 
Janssen (RSI). 
QUESTION  3  
Presentation  of retrieved  laboratory values  on complete blood counts including, but not 
limited to platelets,  anti-platelet  factor 4 antibodies for cases of haemorrhage  in all clinical 
studies with the  Covid-19 vaccine Janssen. 
In the clinical trials (COV1001, COV1002, COV2001, COV3001, COV3009), under the SMQ term 
“Haemorrhages”, the following events have been reported: 36 cases were reported among 22,218 
(0.2%)  participants that  received Ad26COV2.S vaccine at the  5x1010 vp dose level. 9 cases were 
reported among 319 (2.8%)  participants that  received Ad26COV2.S vaccine at 1x1011 vp dose level. 
53 cases were reported among 22,051  (0.2%)  participants that  received placebo. 35 cases were 
reported among 25,537  (0.1%) participants  that are blinded to  treatment. Among those cases, the 
cases of interest (Cerebral haemorrhage, Haematemesis, Haematochezia, Haematuria, Haemoptysis, 
Haemorrhoidal haemorrhage, Subarachnoid haemorrhage) have been retrieved from the  clinical trials 
and are summarized in Table 7. Further information on all haemorrhage cases is provided in  the 
Appendices. From this,  it can be concluded that  there are no imbalances in number of haemorrhage 
cases when comparing vaccine versus placebo group.

Laboratory values for cases of hemorrhagic (ie, bleeding) events reported for the  COVID-19 vaccine 
Janssen in  clinical trials: 
Reviewing all AEs and SAEs cases that  were reported in the  clinical trials databases, limited data is 
available for blood laboratory results: 
COV1001: Subject 1 reported hemoptysis and hematuira had no abnormal laboratory results.  Subject 
2 (COV1001) that  reported Vaginal hemorrhage (mild vaginal bleeding (spotting))  reported normal 
laboratory results. 
COV1002: no event reported. 
COV2001: 10 events reported: no laboratory data pertaining to blood counts 
COV3001: for those cases reported, no laboratory data pertaining to blood counts have been reported 
except for the case described here below (study pause case) 
o Subject 3:  a male subject between the  ages of 18-28 with  cerebral hemorrhage (18 days post 
vaccination) 
- lowest platelet count  of 64,000/uL 
o no other laboratory data has been reported in conjunction with  hemorrhagic events 
COV3009: no laboratory data has been reported in conjunction  with hemorrhagic events. In addition, 
haemorrhage cases (SAEs) were also retrieved from the GMS safety database, to evaluate whether 
additional laboratory data was reported in the CIOMS forms. A total of 22 subject cases with  23 SAEs 
were reported in clinical studies. These are listed in  Table 9 by preferred term (PT) and case count. 
Only 9 SAEs haemorrhage cases (8 cases in COV3001 and 1 case in COV3009) included blood count 
laboratory data, of which only 3 cases were reported within  28  days of receipt of the vaccine. Of those 
cases for which complete laboratory blood count values were provided, only 2 cases exhibited 
thrombocytopenia:

 COV3001: Subject 3, a male between the age of 18-28  with  cerebral hemorrhage (18 days post-
vaccination) - lowest platelet count of 64,000/uL.  Further  details on the case of CVST (Transverse 
Sinus Venous Thrombosis and Cerebral Hemorrhage) reported following administration  of Ad26.COV2.S 
in COV3001 can be found in  the programmed case narratives and attached CIOMS form, reference

 COV3001  subject 4, a female between the ages of 18-28  with immune thrombocytopenia (76 days 
post-vaccination) - lowest platelet count of 6x109/L 
None of the cases with  CBC information had baseline values prior to vaccination. Also, majority of the 
available CBC laboratory values did not  have normal reference ranges precluding adequate medical 
assessment. 
Information from the 9 cases of serious hemorrhagic events with  the COVID-19 vaccine Janssen 
reported in clinical trials are presented in Table 10  below. Given the limited information available, no 
conclusions can be drawn at this time.  Detailed information is provided for all cases observed in clinical 
trials with  the COVID-19 vaccine Janssen, in the programmed case narratives available in Appendices.

PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment 
There is no imbalance for cases of haemorrhages in the clinical COVID-19 vaccine Janssen (in total  45 
cases for participants that received Ad26COV2.S vaccine, 53  cases for placebo; however, for 35 
additional cases, treatment remains blinded). 
Data on laboratory values are missing for the majority of these cases. There are two cases with 
thrombocytopenia in  study 3001; male subject between the  ages of 18-28 with  concomitant 
thrombosis and thrombocytopenia (further discussed below) and one female with immune 
thrombocytopenia 76  days post-vaccination. 
Questions were raised regarding laboratory results from clinical studies and from post-marketing data, 
regarding e.g. thrombocytopenia. Further data presentation is asked for to allow final assessment of 
whether thrombocytopenia without  thrombosis or bleeding, may be caused by the Covid-19 vaccine 
Janssen (RSI).

The answer to this  question has been structured in the  following way: 
•  Section A, presents the thrombosis cases 
•  Section B, presents the thrombosis / thrombocytopenia case 
•  Section C, presents the thrombocytopenia cases 
Each of these sections has 5 subcategories that  present date derived from different sources: 
•  A1, B1, C1 relate to the  Covid vaccine trials ( COV1001, COV1002, COV2001, COV3001 and 
COV3009): AEs and SAEs 
•  A2, B2, C2 relate to Covid vaccine trial COV3012: SAEs, as this is a collaborative study 
•  A3, B3, C3 relate to Ad26 platform vaccine trials (excluding Covid trials): AEs and SAEs 
•  A4, B4, C4 relate to Ad26 platform collaborative trials : SAEs 
•  A5, B5, C5 relate to Post-marketing cases 
•  Section D presents narratives for the cases of thrombosis / thrombocytopenia 
•  Section E provides a summary statement 
For post-marketing cases, a cumulative review through  09 April 2021 of Janssen spontaneous cases 
with  the COVID-19 vaccine Janssen in the Global Medical Safety Database was performed for events

Case 3  
Clinical trial case on active treatment: male subject between the ages of 18-28  experienced transverse 
sinus thrombosis with  secondary cerebral haemorrhage on Day 19 after receiving a single dose of 
blinded study vaccine (Day 1) for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. After experiencing flu-like 
illness starting Day 9, the  subject was hospitalized on Day 19 following a tonic-clonic seizure. Upon 
hospitalization, his platelet  count was 64,000  with a nadir of 60,000. Upon  discharge his platelet count 
was normal at 334.  Of note, pre-vaccination his HEP-IND Thrombocytopenia PF4 Antibodies, IgG were 
negative, and post-vaccination, were elevated at 2.137 OD (reference interval ≤0.399): 
The remaining 5 case summaries (all from spontaneous sources) are provided below:   
Case 1)  
A woman between the ages of 38-48 with  a history of depression on concomitant fluoxetine, 
experienced a headache 1 week after vaccination and subsequent left sided weakness, dry heaves, 
worsening headache who developed “cortical vein thrombosis” involving the right  transverse and 
sigmoid sinus, tentorial herniation, massive intracerebral haemorrhage, and thrombocytopenia (values 
not provided) resulting in death 12 days after vaccination. 
Case 4)  
A female between the ages of 18-28 who  experienced a sagittal sinus thrombosis with  cerebral 
haemorrhage 16 days following COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.COV2.S. Platelet count on presentation was 
18,000  (units unspecified), fibrinogen was noted to be low (value not provided), fibrin D-dimer was 
elevated (specific levels not provided). The platelet counts remained 22,000  to 24,000.  The patient 
developed seizures, was intubated, sedated, and placed on unspecified anti-epileptics.  The patient  was 
treated using the “British guidelines”, was given a platelet  transfusion in  preparation for 
thrombectomy, and was anticoagulated (specific agents not  provided). Following  thrombectomy, the 
patient's platelet  count rose to 160,000,  fibrinogen normalized (value not provided), and both 
remained stable for 1-2  days. Treatment with  unspecified antiepileptics was continued. The patient 
remained intubated  and sedated, and thus her mental and neurologic status  was not  re-evaluated. She 
has not yet recovered. Additional information has been requested. 
Case 5  
This spontaneous report was received from physician via a literature article: Gundabolu K, Kallam A, 
Muir K, Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia Following  Ad26.COV2.S Vaccination, New England Journal of 
Medicine, and describes a woman between the ages of 41-51  who developed splanchnic vein 
thrombosis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), hepatic vein thrombosis, splenic vein 
thrombosis, anaemia, DIC, haemorrhagic stroke, and thrombocytopenia (platelet nadir of 13,000)  14 
days following administration  of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. Initial presentation also included 
hypofibrinogenemia and markedly elevated D-dimer. Anti-PF4/heparin antibody ELISA testing  was 
strongly positive. The CVST progressed while on treatment with  heparin (before vaccination status  was 
known), with  secondary haemorrhagic stroke. 
Anticoagulation was switched to argatroban, and platelet count increased following treatment with 
intravenous immunoglobulin. 
Case 6  
A female between the ages of 19-29 who  experienced portal vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism 
and cavernous sinus thrombosis one week after vaccination. Platelet count  was 120,000,  D-dimer was

elevated (value not  reported), and fibrinogen was normal. The subject was initially  treated with 
heparin; antibodies to platelet factor 4  (PF4) were later noted to  be positive at 3.0 (reference range 
not provided). Heparin was stopped and intravenous immunoglobulin  (IVIG) was initiated, at which 
point the  platelet count had already increased. The subject is recovering. COVID-19 testing was 
reported to be negative.  
 Case 7  
A female between the ages 31-41  was vaccinated with  the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.COV2.S. It 
was noted that  the patient was “experiencing headaches 1 week ago” and had aphasia later in the 
week. CT of the head without  contrast on day 17 showed parenchymal haemorrhage and persistent 
hyperdensity in the left  transverse sinus, consistent  with known venous sinus thrombosis being treated 
for the venous sinus thrombosis with  heparin. No platelet  counts were mentioned in the report.  
One additional spontaneous case of thrombosis (Deep Vein Thrombosis) also had a reported 
thrombocytopenia and is summarized below: 
Case 2: This serious case concerns a female patient between the ages of 52-62.   
Concomitant medication included (levodopa/carbidopa), (formoterol/budesonide), (clonazepam), 
(citalopram), (lemborexant), (icosapent), (diclofenac), (sumatriptan), (ropinirole), (quetiapine), 
Celecoxib, Albuterol inhaler, Omeprazole, (levothyroxine), (hydrocodone), low dose aspirin. The report 
notes that  the patient had allergies to tetracycline and vortioxetine. 
The adverse event started on day 11. The patient  had 5 days of bruising and left leg swelling prior to 
presenting. She was found to have an extensive, occlusive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the left 
lower extremity as well as thrombocytopenia of 15,000  (units  not specified). She had an inferior vena 
cava (IVC) filter placed. The next day, the patient  began to have paraesthesia’s and discoloration of 
the right  lower extremity. Ultrasound showed high-grade occlusion of the right proximal, superficial 
femoral artery. The patient was pre-treated with platelets.  In addition  to the right superficial femoral 
artery (SFA) there is also thrombotic  occlusion of the bilateral iliacs. The patient  had bilateral 
thrombectomy and bilateral common iliac stent  placement. The following day she developed gross 
haematuria. At the time of the report (i.e. 28  March 2021), the  patient had not recovered from the 
event.  
Late  Breaking  Information:  
The MAH was informed by the US FDA of an additional case of a case of CVST involving a female 
patient between the  ages of 21-31.  
MAH  Summary:  
As of 14  April 2021,  there have been 6 reported cases of CVST from spontaneous sources. Of these, 5 
reported thrombocytopenia; 2 reported Anti-PF4  positive antibodies (both  of these patients  were 
treated with  heparin prior to the lab testing);  and 2 reported D-dimer elevation. In addition,  there was 
1 other case of thrombosis in combination with  low platelet count from a spontaneous source.  
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment 
For the clinical trial case of CVST and thrombocytopenia, there have been several different CIOMS 
reports provided; one in which  thrombocytopenia was not mentioned and lab values of platelet levels 
were omitted;  one in  which the platelet levels with  thrombocytopenia as well as the result of the 
peripheral blood smear showing thrombocytopenia and the discharge diagnosis of thrombocytopenia

vaccination; strongly positive during hospitalisation and remaining positive more than one month after 
discharge). The test dates for the anti-PF  4-antibodies (September 2020, October 2020 and December 
2020,  respectively) indicate that  these results have been previously available to the investigator. The 
MAH  should clarify when these tests were actually performed, and when they became aware of the 
results (RSI). 
The cases with  concomitant thrombosis and thrombocytopenia are further discussed in section 3.1.2 
below. 
Thrombosis (any) 
A.1 Clinical trials with  the COVID-19 vaccine Janssen: 
The search identified a total of 27 non-serious cases (AEs) in subjects aged between 38  and 90 years-
old. Out of the 27  AEs, 13  were associated with  the Ad26.COV2.S, 8  with the  placebo and 6 AEs are 
still  blinded. The AEs related to  Ad26.COV2.S and blinded group included deep vein thrombosis (N 
=10),  monoplegia (N=1),  pulmonary embolism (N =3),  thrombophlebitis (N=2),  transient ischaemic 
attack (N=1)  and venous thrombosis limb (N=1).  Time to  onset after vaccination varies between 2 and 
98 days. In 7  out of the 13 cases from the Ad26.COV2.S group the event occurred within  the first 28 
days. Only one case in the Ad26.COV2.S was reported as related: a male between the ages of 45-55, 
reported DVT 27  days post vaccination. 
The search identified a total of 55 serious adverse events (SAEs) in 14 female subjects aged between 
24 and 80 years-old and 14 males aged between 25 and 85 years-old. Out of the 55  SAEs, 22 were 
associated with  the Ad26.COV2.S, 19 with  the placebo and 14 SAEs are still blinded. The events 
reported in the  Ad26.COV2.S and blinded group included pulmonary embolism (N=9),  cerebrovascular 
accident (N=5),  deep vein thrombosis (N=3),  acute myocardial infarction and myocardial infarction 
(N=7),  transient ischaemic attack (N=3),  Ischemic stroke (N=2)  and 1 case of each for cerebral 
infarction, cerebral thrombosis, embolism venous, hemiparesis, retinal vein thrombosis, transverse 
sinus thrombosis, and peripheral artery thrombosis. Time to onset after vaccination varies between 3 
and 108 days. In 6  out of the 22 cases from the Ad26.COV2.S group the event occurred within  the first 
28 days. From the 19 placebo cases, the  events reported included acute myocardial infarction and 
myocardial infarction (N=6),  cerebrovascular accident (N=3), deep vein thrombosis (N=2),  pulmonary 
embolism (N=2),  Transient ischaemic attack (N=2),  and 1 case of each for cerebral infarction, cerebral 
venous sinus thrombosis, carotid artery occlusion, and paraparesis. The investigator causality was not 
related for 54 out  of the  55 SAEs and related for 1 event of deep vein thrombosis in the placebo group. 
Further details on the cases reported in the Janssen Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 clinical trials (unblinded 
and blinded cases) can be found in the  detailed programmed case narratives. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment 
From the clinical studies, there was a total  of 27 non-serious and 55 serious adverse events of 
thromboembolism in  subjects aged between 24  and 90 years old. 
Out of the 27  non-serious AEs, 13 were associated with  the Ad26.COV2.S, 8 with  the placebo and 6 
AEs are still blinded. In 7 out  of the  13 cases from the  Ad26.COV2.S group the event occurred within 
the first 28  days.

Out of the 55  serious AEs, 22  were associated with  the Ad26.COV2.S, 19 with  the placebo and 14 SAEs 
are still  blinded. In 6 out of the 22 cases from the Ad26.COV2.S group the event occurred within  the 
first 28 days.  
It is expected that  laboratory results for the cases with  thromboembolism in  the clinical studies are 
presented with  the next Response to RSI. 
A.2 COVID3012 SISONKE: 
A separate review of cases from clinical trial COV3012 Sisonke (Together):  
OPEN LABEL TRIAL Open-label, single-arm Phase 3b implementation study to monitor the effectiveness 
of the single-dose Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine Janssen among health care workers in South Africa 
was performed as this  is a collaborative study with  the South Africa Health  Authority, and the serious 
cases are sent directly to Janssen for entry into the Global Medical Safety Database. The cumulative 
review through 09  April 2021  in the Global Medical Safety Database was performed There are 3 cases 
with  PTs reported in the SMQ: Embolic and thrombotic events.  
Recently Received Information: Per the monthly “4-Weekly* Abridged COVID-19 Interim Progress 
Report Form For Clinical Trials” received by the MAH  on 12 April 2021 from the South African Health 
Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) , there was 1 additional case of a CVA reported to the Health 
Authority, but  not yet received by the MAH. 
Of the 3 cases contained in the GMS Safety Database, 1 case reported Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) 
1 case reported Retinal vein occlusion and Retinal haemorrhage and 1 case reported Pulmonary 
embolism with  Cor pulmonale. Of note, there has been a second case of Pulmonary embolism recently 
received by the MAH. 
One case concerns a female aged between 29-39  who was hospitalized for CVA 8 days post 
vaccination. After vaccination the subject experienced moderate (unspecified) reactogenicity and 
returned back to work. Her first symptoms 8 days after vaccine administration were slurred speech, 
dizziness and collapse, and she was brought to the  hospital. Upon arrival she developed a seizure 
followed by left sided weakness. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, chest x-ray was normal, 
and COVID-19 PCR test  was negative. Results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 
echocardiogram are pending. The subject is receiving speech therapy and physiotherapy and improving 
remarkably. The event is resolving. 
Another case concerns a female subject aged between 58-68 who  experienced left retinal vein 
occlusion and macular haemorrhage 10 days after vaccine administration.  After vaccination, the 
subject was “lethargic, sleepy, and flushed”. The next day she complained of myalgia, stiff neck, and 
took acetaminophen. She felt well for a week and on day 8  post vaccination experienced blurring of 
vision in the left eye and noted deterioration of vision with  progression of blurring, which  had worsened 
significantly by the next day. On day 10 post vaccination, she was examined by an ophthalmologist 
and noted to have blocked vessels, haemorrhage, and edema of one eye. The patient has a history of 
elevated triglycerides with  the highest noted at  2.0 mmol/L (Normal - NR: 0.4  - 1.6) in 2017.  More 
recent labs from 13 days after vaccination showed normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-
reactive protein. Haemoglobin, white blood cell count, and platelet counts were 13.4 g/dL  (NL: 12.1-16 
.3), 6.54x10^9/L  (NL: 3.92  - 9.88),  and 290x10^9/L  (NL:  150-450)  respectively. Triglycerides were 
1.4 mmol/L,  and Hgb  A1C was 5.8%  (NL:  4.0-6.0).  The patient’s  estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGRF) was 58 ml/min (NL:  >90)  and has been in the range of 63 to  69 since 2018.  Outcome of the 
events were not reported.

A third case concerns a female subject aged between 57-67  who was hospitalized 17 days after 
vaccine administration for pulmonary embolism and cor pulmonale. Concomitant  medications included 
an unspecified statin  and fluoxetine. The subject developed sudden shortness of breath and mottled 
skin on legs; she was taken to  a hospital and was admitted to  the intensive care unit. Results of 
diagnostic tests included elevated D-dimer; computerized tomogram pulmonary angiogram showed 
multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli and cor pulmonale; echocardiogram showed dilated right ventricle 
and atrium, severe tricuspid incompetence, hypokinetic intraventricular septum but  no thrombi. 
Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine showed scattered sclerotic areas. There was no finding  of 
deep vein thrombosis. No platelet counts or CBC were provided. The subject was discharged after 5 
days and is recovering. 
The fourth case concerns a female aged between 55-65  who experienced pulmonary embolus (fatal). 
The event occurred 23 days after vaccination COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.COV2.S was administered 
intramuscularly for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. It  was reported that 
she was overweight with  a number of co-morbidities. 
On an unspecified date, the subject's SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was negative. 
23 days post  vaccination, the subject experienced pulmonary embolus (fatal).  Her body build was 
normal. Nutritional  status was good. External body examination: body examination revealed no visible 
injuries. Main findings: pulmonary thrombus of the  pulmonary truncus with  congestion and edema of 
the lungs. The rest of the organs and structures were all within  normal limits with  no injuries noted. 
Cause of death reported as natural causes: pulmonary embolus. Investigator's causality assessment: 
The event of pulmonary embolus was not related to  the study vaccine. 
The fifth case concerns a female  aged between 38-48  who experienced a CVA less than 24  hours after 
vaccination. Further case details are pending.  
MAH  Conclusion: There were 5 cases of embolism/thrombosis from clinical trial VAC31518COV3012. 
A single case which reported haemorrhage in the eye had normal thrombocytes; in the 2 other cases 
without  bleeding thrombocyte counts  were not provided. COVID-19 was ruled out in  one case. Two 
cases of pulmonary embolism were confounded by a preceding distant  travel and co-morbidities. Of 
the 5 cases, for 1 case the causality to vaccine was considered unclassifiable, 1 case had indeterminate 
causal association and 1 case was considered inconsistent with  the causal association to immunization 
per the  WHO causality classification for adverse events following immunization. The remaining 2 cases 
have not  yet been assessed by the company. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment 
In the open-label, single-arm Phase 3b implementation study to  monitor the effectiveness of the 
single-dose Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine Janssen among health care workers in South Africa, only 
serious cases have been provided. 
For the case with  cerebrovascular accident (CVA), this concerns a female aged between 29-39 with 
CVA 8 days following vaccination. COVID-19 PCR test was negative; no additional  laboratory test has 
been provided.  
For the case with  retinal vein occlusion and macular haemorrhage, this concerns a female aged 
between 58-68  with a history of diabetes who presented with  blurred vision 8 days post vaccination. 
Laboratory tests revealed normal platelet levels.

For the first case with  pulmonary embolism, this  concerns a female aged between 57-67 who was 
hospitalized 17 days after vaccination, having travelled a long distance the day before, and was 
diagnosed with  pulmonary embolism. No platelet counts have been provided. 
For the second case with  pulmonary embolism, this  was diagnosed post-mortem in a female aged 
between 56-66,  23 days after vaccination.  
There is one additional case of CVA within  24 hours of vaccination in a female aged between 38-48;  no 
further details have been provided. 
Based on the above, there are currently no case reports of concomitant thrombosis and 
thrombocytopenia. Additional  information regarding platelet levels should be attempted to be provided 
for the cases with  CVA and the first case of pulmonary embolism (RSI). 
Ad26 Platform Data 
A search for reported cases of thromboembolic events using the search terms embolic and thrombotic 
of the AdVac platform safety database revealed the following cases (cut off 31 December 2020). 
Table 11  includes all AEs identified, based on the  embolic and thrombotic events search criteria in 
studies integrated in the AdVac Safety Database V6.0. A total  of 8,826  participants in 32  studies were 
vaccinated with  at least one dose of an Ad26-based vaccine (hereafter also referred to as “Ad26 
recipients”) and 4,075 participants  received placebo.  
In total, 18  subjects (0.2%)  in the Ad26 vector-based vaccination group and 25 subjects (0.6%)  in the 
placebo group reported at least one embolic or thrombotic event following vaccination.

Safety laboratory values (platelet counts  a) were only available for five subjects for which 
thromboembolic events were reported. No abnormal platelet counts were reported postvaccination, 
with  the exception of one subject that had low platelet counts at  screening (114,000  cell/mm3). 
a *Laboratory parameter searches for abnormalities were as follow: Activated Partial Thromboplastin 
Time, Platelets 
Ad26.ZEBOV (Ebola) Collaborative Clinical Trials and Vaccination Programs 
The search identified 9 cases in subjects between 30 and 71 years old. A total  of 6 out of the 9 cases 
are still  blinded. The time to onset after first dose vaccination varies between 44 and 297 days. In one 
case associated with  exposure during pregnancy the time to onset was not reported. The reported 
events reported included: Cerebrovascular accidents (CVA, 6 cases including  one fatal case), ischemic 
stroke (1 fatal case), acute myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis (1 
fatal case), deep vein thrombosis (1 pregnancy case). All these cases were reported prior to the 
outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore results of COVID-19 testing  is not available. Platelet 
counts were available in one case of CVA reported in  a female subject aged between 64-74, 207  days 
after vaccination. At the  time of the  event the subject had a normal platelet count  reported as “Mean 
platelet volume (NR:  8.3 - 12.1)  7.6 fL,  Platelet count  (NR: 156  - 342) 311  x10*9/L, Platelet-large cell 
ratio (NR: 25.30  - 53.80)  36.2%”. 
In all the cases reported, the causality of the vaccine is unlikely because of long time to onset after 
vaccination and the  significant medical history or underlying conditions such as hypertension, elderly

age, underlying infections causing disseminated intravascular coagulation with  fatal outcome, or 
underlying pregnancy. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment 
No cases with  concomitant thrombosis and thrombocytopenia have been identified in the Ad26 
platform data or the Ad26ZEBOV (Ebola) collaborative clinical trials and vaccination program. 
There was no increase in thromboembolic events in the Ad26 platform data: 8,826  participants in 32 
studies who were vaccinated with  at least one dose of an Ad26-based vaccine and 4,075  participants 
received placebo; 18 subjects (0.2%) in  the Ad26 vector-based vaccination group and 25 subjects 
(0.6%)  in the placebo group reported at least one embolic or thrombotic event following vaccination. 
Spontaneously reported cases with COVID-19  vaccine  Janssen (post-marketing)  – SMQ 
Embolic and Thrombotic events 
There are 27  spontaneous cases which  report preferred terms (PTs) meeting the search criteria of 
SMQ: Embolic and thrombotic events. 
Of the 27 cases, 5 cases reported events of interest, reporting central venous sinus thrombosis or 
significant peripheral thrombosis. Six cases were reported by Health Care Professionals and 21 were 
non-medically confirmed cases. Two cases reported COVID-19 test results, with  1 positive result and 1 
negative result. The narrative of 2 cases suggests that  thrombotic diagnoses were ruled out: one case 
involved a woman of unspecified age who was hospitalized with  “heart attack symptoms” one day after 
vaccine administration and all tests on her heart “came back good.” Another involved an adult man 
with  a history of “born in” heart condition who thought  he was having a heart attack the same day as 
vaccine, and underwent “EKG, MRI, Nuclear stress test,  CAT scan and Transesophageal ECHO, all of 
which came back ok” in  addition to “countless tests, blood screens, monitoring and consultation[s].”  22 
of the 27 cases reported an event latency from vaccine; all of these occurred less than 28 days (range 
0-19  days; mean 6.2  days) after vaccine administration.  
There was one case  of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with  “exacerbation of idiopathic 
capillary leak syndrome (ICLS)” in a 61-71-year-old female with limited  information provided. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment 
There were 27 post-marketing case reports of thromboembolism; based on the  narratives, thrombotic 
disease was ruled out  in two of these. 22 of 27 cases occurred with  a latency from vaccination but 
within  28 days after vaccine administration. No  laboratory tests have been provided in this section; 
five of the cases are included in  the EudraVigilance case reports in section 3.1.2. Laboratory tests  are 
expected with  the next Responses to RSI.  
The case of capillary leak syndrome is noted, and this condition should be followed up in monthly 
safety summary reports (RSI).

Thrombosis and Cerebral Hemorrhage was reported following administration of Ad26.COV2.S. This 
participant was tested negative 28 days post vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on SARS-
CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody serology, as measured by ELISA and Meso Scale Discovery assays. SARS-
CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers elicited by Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (IC50 of 66) 29 days post 
vaccination were in the range of titers  observed in participants that  received Ad26.COV2.S at a dose 
level of 5x1010vp (N=10,  IC50 of 117 with  a 95% confidence interval of 18  - 449) in COV1001 cohort 
1b, as measured by psVNA. The neutralizing antibody titers against the vector were not evaluated. 
Additional Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) PF4 antibody IgG test  results were received by 
the Company on April 12th,  2021 and were not yet included in the CIOMS I form: 
•  Day 1, pre-vaccination (21  Sep 2020):  0.246  (negative) 
•  Day 29 (22  Oct 2020):  2.137 (positive) 
•  Day 71 (01  Dec 2020):  1.451 (positive) 
B.3 Ad26 Platform Data, 
No case of Thrombosis (any) and Concomitant Thrombocytopenia/low platelet count  were reported. 
B.4 Ad26.ZEBOV (Ebola) Collaborative Clinical Trials and Vaccination Programs 
No serious cases of thromboembolic events with  concomitant thrombocytopenia were reported. Safety 
laboratory values (including  platelet counts) were only available for five subjects that reported an 
embolic or thrombotic event. None of the subjects reported thrombocytopenia/low platelet  counts post-
vaccination, with the  exception of one subject that  reported a low platelet counts at screening 
(114,000  cell/mm3) and thrombophlebitis on the day of vaccination (grade 1, mild;  duration 6 days). 
The platelet count was back to normal range at the  day of vaccination (214,000  cell/mm3). 
B.5 Spontaneously reported cases with  COVID-19 vaccine Janssen (post-marketing) - SMQ: Embolic 
and thrombotic events SMQ AND SMQ Haematopoietic thrombocytopenia OR SMQ Thrombocytopenia 
Five cases reported thrombosis with  thrombocytopenia; 3 of these cases also reported elevated D-
dimer. Two cases included a positive PF4/polyanion ELISA of 3.0 (no reference range provided) and 
3.179  Optical Density units  (upper range of normal is below or equal to 0.399),  respectively. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment 
In the clinical studies with  the COVID-19 vaccine Janssen, one case with  concomitant thrombosis 
(CVST) and thrombocytopenia was reported; this case was discussed with  the signal confirmation 
above and is further discussed in section 3.1.2 below. 
As discussed in the assessment of Q2 above, there appears to be one additional case with  concomitant 
thrombosis and thrombocytopenia in study 3001  (male aged between 56-66 with  DVT and 
thrombocytopenia). It is unclear why the MAH  has not  included this subject in the presentation of case 
reports as requested; full  details on this  case including CIOMS report is expected (immediate  RSI). 
For the Ad26 platform data and the Ebola collaborative clinical trials,  no cases with  concomitant 
thrombosis and thrombocytopenia were reported.

C) Thrombocytopenia/low platelet count regardless of symptoms 
C.1 Clinical trials with  the COVID-19 vaccine Janssen 
The search identified a total of 18 non-serious cases (AEs) of any haematological abnormalities in 
subjects aged between 19 and 76 years-old. Out  of the 18  AEs, 12  were associated with  the 
Ad26.COV2.S, 1  with the  placebo and 6 AEs are still blinded. The AEs reported as related to 
Ad26.COV2.S and blinded group included leukopenia (N=1)  neutropenia (N=1),  leukopenia (N=1), 
neutrophil count  decreased (N=1), low haemoglobin (N=1)  and anaemia (N=1).  For these related 
cases, time to onset after vaccination varies between 6 and 76 days and 4 cases occurred within  the 
first 28 days.  
The search identified a total of 7 serious adverse events (SAEs) in 4 female subjects aged between 25 
and -65 years old and 3 male subjects between 51 and 68 years-old. Out of the 7 SAEs, 2 were 
associated with  the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, 4 were associated with  the placebo and 1 SAE is still 
blinded. The events reported included anaemia, reported in the Ad26.COV2.S group (N=2)  ,the  blinded 
group (N=1)  and in the placebo group (N=1).  One case of Immune thrombocytopenia and 3 cases of 
anaemia were reported in the placebo group. Time to onset reported for anaemia was 1  day (blinded 
case), 21  days and 72 days in the  Ad26.COV2.S group. Time to  onset in  the placebo group varied 
between 36 and 107 days. The investigator causality was not  related for all the 8 SAEs. 
Further details on the cases reported in the Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 clinical trials Janssen (unblinded 
and blinded cases) can be found in the  detailed programmed case narratives. 
The following events were reported for the  COVID-19 clinical trials (Table 12).  There are no events 
reported in COV1002 and COV2001. 
Table 12:  COVID-19 vaccine Janssen clinical trials: Cases of Thrombocytopenia/low platelet count 
regardless of symptoms. 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment 
Overall, based on Table 12, there were 27 cases of haematopoietic cytopenia/thrombocytopenia in the 
COVID-19 vaccine Janssen clinical trials in patients who received the vaccine; 9 in the placebo groups 
and for 13  cases, treatment is still blinded.

The figures in the  MAH text in this  section are not congruent with  Table 12; it is unclear if this relates 
to the cases in  Table 12 not  being reported as AEs or SAEs. It is however noted that  there was an 
imbalance also in non-serious AEs of any haematological abnormalities in the clinical trials with  the 
COVID-19 vaccine Janssen, with  12 AEs reported in the Ad26.COV2.S group, 1 in  the placebo group 
and for 6 AEs, treatment is still  blinded. For serious AEs of haematological abnormalities, there were 2 
in the Ad26.COV2.S group, 4 in the placebo group and for 1 SAE, treatment remains blinded. Anaemia 
was the most frequent of these SAEs. 
Overall, the majority of cases appear to pertain to  ‘haematopoietic cytopenias’ without  further 
specification, for which  also an imbalance is noted (in total  12 cases in the  Ad26.vaccine groups, 4 in 
the placebo groups, and 2 in whom treatment  is blinded). 
One case in the placebo group was reported with  Immune thrombocytopenia in study 3001,  and there 
was one case of thrombocytopenia in the vaccine group in this section (however, as discussed above, 
there was also one case with  concomitant thrombocytopenia and CVST in study 3001). 
The MAH should clarify the  cases of ‘haematopoietic cytopenias’ in the  clinical trials with COVID-19 
vaccine Janssen and whether any of these were thrombocytopenic (RSI). 
C.2 COV3012:  SISONKE 
No cases of Thrombocytopenia/low platelet count  regardless of symptoms were reported at the time of 
this report. 
C.3 Ad26 Platform Data 
A summary tabulation of the worst laboratory toxicity grades within  28  days following study 
vaccination for selected laboratory safety parameters of all studies that  are integrated in the AdVac 
Safety Database V6.0. is provided in Table 13. Most  laboratory toxicities were transient (including 
Grade 3 events) and returned to normal range upon repeat testing. The frequency of graded laboratory 
toxicities was also similar in both the  Ad26 vaccine and placebo groups. Platelet count decrease was 
observed following 70 out of 4,105  Ad26 doses (1.7%)  and 7 out  of 719 placebo doses (1.0%).  None 
of the platelet count decrease cases post vaccination were concomitant with  an embolic or thrombotic 
event. In total,  18 cases of Grade 3* platelet count  decrease cases were reported within  28 days 
following Ad26 vaccination (mostly at 8 day post-vaccination visit).  
Except one case for which the  safety laboratory assessment was not repeated, all grade 3 platelet 
count decrease cases were back to normal range upon retesting in  the days following the grade 3 
event. One case of persistent grade 3 (31,000  cells/mm3) thrombocytopenia was reported 8 days 
following vaccination for a female subject aged between 54-64  in study VAC18193RSV1004 following 
vaccination with Ad26.RSV.preF. The event persisted for 40 days upon  returning to normal range. The 
subject remained asymptomatic during  the event and had normal physical exams (no bruising or 
petechiae reported).

PRAC Rapporteur assessment comment 
There is an imbalance in platelet  count decrease in the  Ad26 platform data. Platelet count  decrease 
was observed following 70  out of 4,105 Ad26 doses (1.7%) and 7 out  of 719  placebo doses (1.0%). 
None of the platelet count decrease cases post vaccination were concomitant with an embolic or 
thrombotic event. In total, 18  cases of Grade 3*  platelet count decrease cases were reported within  28 
days following Ad26 vaccination (mostly at 8 day post-vaccination visit) and 1 case in  the placebo 
groups. 
All grade 3 platelet count  decrease cases that were re-tested (all but one) went back to normal range 
upon retesting in the  days following the grade 3 event. One case of persistent grade 3 (31,000 
cells/mm3) thrombocytopenia was reported 8 days following vaccination for a female subject aged 
between 54-64  in study VAC18193RSV1004 following  vaccination with  Ad26.RSV.preF. The event 
persisted for 40 days upon returning  to normal range. The subject remained asymptomatic during the 
event and had normal physical exams (no bruising or petechiae reported). This event is considered of 
interest; for a comparison, HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) can present with 
thrombocytopenia without  other symptoms. These data need to be considered for further review 
regarding thrombocytopenia.

No serious cases thrombocytopenia were reported. 
C.5 Spontaneously reported cases with  COVID-19 vaccine Janssen (post-marketing) -SMQ 
Haematopoietic thrombocytopenia OR Thrombocytopenias HLT 
There were 7 total spontaneous cases of thrombocytopenia. Of these, 6 were serious and 5 were 
detailed above in response 4(iii). There was one non-serious case of thrombocytopenia that was not 
associated with  thrombosis; this case reported a decreased platelet count in a female aged between 
65-75  with a platelet count  of 138  (NR: 150-450).  The one late breaking serious case of platelet count 
decreased is described below. 
There was a late-breaking case, also included in the above counts of platelet count decreased, an 
unknown time after vaccine. This case involved a female of unspecified age with an unspecified 
autoimmune disease, who had quarterly blood tests and was hospitalized due to a decreased platelet 
count (value not reported). She was discharged after a week with  “weekly test  checks.” Additional 
information has been requested. 
Narratives 
Programmed case narratives are provided in all Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials with  the 
exception of COV3012 which is an open-label collaborative study). Information from serious cases 
observed from the AdVac platform are reported in  the GMS safety database and therefore available in 
the CIOMS.  
More detailed information for spontaneous cases and cases observed in the open-label collaborative 
COV1012 clinical trial are available in the CIOMS. 
EMA Response Late Breaking Information 
The data presented by the MAH in this  response document have a data lock of 12 April 2021 or earlier, 
as further specified in the different sections of the responses provided. 
To assure transparency with respect to additional information available to the MAH  at the time of issue 
of this document, the MAH  would like to add the following elements in this section with  late breaking 
information. 
On 12 April 2021, the  MAH was informed of an event of sagittal  vein thrombosis, right lower extremity 
DVT and thrombocytopenia. On 15  April 2021,  further information was provided to the MAH  under the 
Freedom of Information Act. The case is currently processed in the global safety database and further 
follow-up attempts  will be made.  
Available case details: 
 A female aged between 21-31  with no reported medical history received JNJ vaccine on and 
complained of a “viral syndrome” including  fevers, rigors, muscle pain and shortness of breath an 
unspecified time  after the vaccine. She received azithromycin as treatment. Fever persisted for 1 day 
after her emergency room visit, and she continued to “feel badly”. The following day, she awakened 
with  severe Right>Left jaw pain, posterior headache with  standing,  pain in  cartilage from the tip of 
nose, and shortness of breath. Shortness of breath resolved 12 days after the vaccination. Headaches 
persisted as did jaw pain, and pain behind the eyes. 11 days after vaccination, she noted increasing 
bruising and periorbital petechiae. She sought  help from her primary care provider who noted bilateral 
leg swelling (R>L). Labs and a Doppler ultrasound were performed but  results are not yet available.

She had a syncopal spell and was taken to emergency room where she received a diagnosis of sagittal 
vein thrombosis, right  lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. Her platelet count 
was 125k, smear review: no clumping, no schistocytes. Hypercoagulation panel ordered as well as 
ANA, Anti PF4/HIT  (pending). CT and MRI head with  Dural sinus thrombosis.  Duplex US of RLE 
thrombosis. She was stabilized and as to  yet recovered. 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in the USA 
On 14 April 2021, a meeting was organized by the CDC / Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices (ACIP) where the reports of CVSTs with  thrombocytopenia after COVID-19 vaccine Janssen 
reported in the  US since the start  of the vaccination program were presented. As CDC and FDA have 
access to more detailed information than the  MAH, we herewith include the link to ACIP website for 
further details on the presentation made during that  meeting

MAH  Summary 
Review of all clinical trial data with Janssen Ad26.COV2.S vaccine identified  one report of cerebral 
venous sinus thrombosis with  thrombocytopenia in a 25 year old male. Review of clinical trial and 
spontaneous reports with  Ad26 platform, not including the  Janssen Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, identified 
events of thrombocytopenia or platelet decreased with a higher incidence in  the Ad26 treatment arm 
compared to placebo. None of the subjects with  thrombocytopenia or decreased platelets count 
reported a concomitant embolic or thrombotic  event. The thrombocytopenia or platelet decreased 
events were transient, occurred 7 days post  vaccination and resolved by the date of the next 
laboratory assessment,  
Review of MAH safety database for events reported from collaborative study in South Africa (SISONKE, 
3012)  identified three cases of interest: 1  of Cerebrovascular accident, 1 of retinal vein occlusion and 
Retinal haemorrhage  and 1 of Pulmonary embolism (PE) with Cor pulmonale. One additional report of 
CVA and one of PE have been included in the monthly report dated 12 April. None of the  above reports 
included thrombocytopenia, it  should be noted that MAH  is not sponsor of the study and limited 
information is provided in the monthly reports. Spontaneous reports from MAHs  safety database 
included 6 reports of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis 5 with  thrombocytopenia. Most  occurred within 
16 days of vaccination and all 6  were in women aged between 18 and 48. 
The number of thrombotic events with  thrombocytopenia are low and there is insufficient data to 
conclude a definitive causal association with  the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine at present. However, given the 
seriousness of the  events, further monitoring and characterization are planned as described in the 
subsequent sections of this  response. 
PRAC Rapporteur comment (totality of Q4): 
For thrombosis (any), there was an imbalance noted for venous thrombosis with  the initial assessment 
of the clinical trial data; the RMP includes thromboembolism as an important potential  risk; there is 
currently no mentioning  of thrombosis in the  product information. It is noted that there was no 
increase in thromboembolic events in the Ad26 platform data; however, there is an imbalance in 
decreased platelet levels based on that platform data (see below). 
Based on the data provided with  this answer, information remains insufficient to  assess how many 
cases in the clinical studies with  thrombosis (n=35  in the Ad26.COV2.S groups, 20 who remain 
blinded) who had concomitant thrombocytopenia. As discussed in Q2 above, lab tests  have not yet 
been provided for the majority of these subjects; in only three of the cases with  thrombosis, a normal

platelet count has been provided. One clinical study case is well documented (18-28-year old male), in 
whom three different CIOMS reports have been submitted  with varying information; it is clear, 
however, that  this previously healthy individual with  no preexisting anti-PF4-antibodies  was 
hospitalized with  CVST with  haemorrhage and thrombocytopenia following vaccination with  COVID-19 
vaccine Janssen, with positive anti-PF4-antibodies  after vaccination. One additional clinical trial case 
with  deep vein thrombosis and thrombocytopenia is noted in Q2, further data are requested 
(immediate  RSI). 
For the open-label clinical study with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen in South Africa, there were five cases 
of thromboembolism that  occurred between less than 24  hours and 23 days after vaccination. Normal 
platelet counts have been provided for only one of these; for one case, pulmonary embolism was 
diagnosed postmortem and is thus not  expected to provide further laboratory testing; for the 
remaining three cases, platelet  levels are expected with  the Responses to the next RSI. 
For the Ad26 platform data and the Ebola collaborative clinical trials,  no cases with  concomitant 
thrombosis and thrombocytopenia were reported. 
For thrombocytopenia, no imbalance is apparent with  the data as presented for the  clinical COVID-19 
vaccine Janssen studies;  however, there is an imbalance in  haematopoietic cytopenias: in  total 12 
cases in the Ad26.vaccine groups, 4 in the  placebo groups, and 2 in  whom treatment remains blinded. 
A more precise diagnosis of these cases is requested (RSI). Also, in the Ad26 platform data, there is 
an imbalance in platelet count  decrease, which was observed following 70 out  of 4,105  Ad26 doses 
(1.7%)  and 7 out of 719 placebo doses (1.0%). None of these were associated with  a thromboembolic 
event. 
The MAH concludes that the  number of thrombotic events with  thrombocytopenia are low and there is 
insufficient data to conclude a definitive causal association with  the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. This is not 
supported. The PRAC Rapporteur considers that a causal association is sufficiently supported based on 
the following: The observed cases with  CVST and concomitant  thrombocytopenia represent clinical 
entities that  are extremely rare in an overall population. Although CVST is well-known to occur 
predominantly in younger females, often related to  hormonal factors such as pregnancy, puerperium or 
estrogen-containing medications, concomitant thrombocytopenia is not  part of any usual clinical 
picture for CVST. The findings  of positive anti-PF4-antibodies  in several cases, in one case with 
documented non-existing anti-PF4-antibodies  before vaccination, suggest that  the clinical picture is 
likely due to these antibodies. A similarity with  HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) is evident 
based on the clinical picture; however, there is no known exposure to heparin before the events of 
thrombosis and thrombocytopenia in any of the  reported cases, and in one case, a screening test for 
anti-PF4/heparin  antibodies by latex-enhanced immunoassay was negative whereas results of a 
PF4/polyanion ELISA were strongly positive. In the majority of the  cases, there was no apparent risk 
factor for CVST or other thrombosis or for thrombocytopenia. For a picture of thrombotic 
thrombocytopenia with  positive anti-PF4-antibodies,  this is similar to “spontaneous HIT” which is 
characterized by a similar clinical and laboratory picture in patients  without  exposure to heparin; 
however, some trigger is warranted in such cases (such as surgery, infectious disease etc.). The only 
common trigger in these cases is the vaccination with  the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. 
-The timing of events is congruent for all of the cases, with  symptoms of thrombosis and/or 
thrombocytopenia occurring within  three weeks from the vaccination. This is also in line with  what  is 
known for HIT  type II and spontaneous HIT as well as for the thrombotic thrombocytopenia related to 
another adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine.

- 
Extensive work-up excluding other potential  causes of thrombosis and/or thrombocytopenia has 
been provided for two  of the cases. This includes antiphospholipid  antibodies, homocysteine, 
Factor VIII, antithrombin,  protein C, protein S, Factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, 
hepatitis/HIV,  ADAMTS 13, PNH  and JAK2. The only abnormality that  could explain the clinical 
picture in these cases was positive anti-PF4-antibodies. 
-  Although the  absolute number of cases is low, there is one well characterized case in the clinical 
trials (and one potential case for which details are unknown, see Q2). However, it  remains 
unknown how many cases with thrombosis and concomitant thrombocytopenia that occurred in 
the clinical trials with  the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. An imbalance was noted with  regards to venous 
thromboembolism in  the initial assessment of these studies, with  more cases in the vaccine vs the 
placebo group. However, platelet  levels have not been provided for more than  very few of these 
cases. Further,  the post-marketing exposure to COVID-19 vaccine Janssen has increased rapidly 
within  recent weeks and thus, the numbers at risk for having developed these symptoms does not 
correspond to actual doses given (see also Q1). 
Based  on the above,  the PRAC Rapporteur considers that ‘thrombotic thrombocytopenia’ 
should be included in the  product information section 4.4 and  4.8. 
QUESTION  5 
Observed  to expected  analyses of cases of  
a.  Cerebral venous thrombosis without thrombocytopenia (i.e.  using all relevant  PTs such 
as cerebral venous thrombosis, superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, transverse sinus 
thrombosis, aseptic cavernous sinus thrombosis, cerebral venous thrombosis and also 
events  of cerebral thrombosis that are adjudicated  to be related  to venous  thrombosis), 
also stratified by age  bands (i.e. 10 years)  should be provided. Background rates  for 
events  of CVST without thrombocytopenia should be  used within the  analysis. 
b.  Cerebral venous thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (i.e. using all relevant  PTs such as 
cerebral venous thrombosis, superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, transverse sinus 
thrombosis, aseptic cavernous sinus thrombosis, cerebral venous thrombosis and also 
events  of cerebral thrombosis that are adjudicated  to be related  to venous  thrombosis), 
also stratified by age  bands (i.e. 10 years),  should be provided. Background rates  for 
CVST with thrombocytopenia should be  used within the  analysis. 
MAH  RESPONSE: 
Incidence of Cerebral sinus venous thrombosis 
Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is a rare phenomenon that can be seen with  some frequency in 
young patients. CVST is a multifactorial condition with  gender-related specific causes, with a wide 
clinical presentation, the leading causes differ between developed and developing countries, converting 
CVST in a condition characterized by a highly variable clinical spectra, difficult diagnosis, variable 
etiologies and prognosis that requires fine medical skills and a high suspicious index. This disease can 
affect the cerebral venous drainage and related anatomical structure. The symptoms may appear in 
relation to increased intracranial pressure imitating  a pseudotumor cerebri. Prognosis depends on the 
early detection and appropriate treatment. Correcting the cause, generally the  complications can be 
prevented (Alvis-Miranda 2013).

As in any thrombotic process, risk factors are associated with the  classical Virchow triad of 
thrombogenesis: hypercoagulability, vessel wall damage and blood stasis. It may be associated with 
inherited and acquired risks factors; however, this categorization is fairly artificial, because they have 
additive effects and CVST is multifactorial. By far, in developed countries, the most frequently 
associated factor is congenital thrombophilia. 
Inherited prothrombotic risk factors include homocysteinemia, factor V Leiden homozygous mutation, 
G20210A prothrombin gene and Methylene- Tetra-Hydro-Folate-Reductase 677TT mutations,  protein C 
and S and anti-thrombin  III deficiency, and positive anti-cardiolipin or antiphospholipid antibodies. 
Acquired risks factors include all the usual causes of VTE and additionally causes such as brain tumors, 
head trauma, central nervous system infections (bacterial meningitis,  cerebral malaria, intracranial 
hypotension, any local head infection,  extracerebral neoplasia’s, dural fistulas, hematological 
conditions, nephrotic syndrome, systemic vasculitis, medicaments (cisplatin, methotrexate, and 
steroids), neurological surgery, lumbar puncture, pregnancy, and puerperium (Alvis-Miranda 2013). 
Cerebral venous thrombosis has an annual incidence estimated to  be 3 to  4 cases per million.  The 
frequency of peripartum and post-partum cerebral venous thrombosis is about 12 cases per 100,000 
deliveries in pregnant women, which is only slightly  lower than  that of peripartum and postpartum 
arterial stroke. More recently, there has been a significant  female predominance among young adults, 
with  the majority of cases (70%  to 80%) being in women of childbearing age, but not among children 
or elderly persons (Tadi 2020). 
Observed to expected analyses of cases of CVST with  and without  thrombocytopenia by age are 
provided in Table 14, Table 15,  and Table 16.

The MAH has also provided the following supplementary contextual information to support question 5: 
Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) has an annual incidence estimated to be two to five cases 
per million  (Capecchi, 2018).  These data are aligned with  the publicly available data from the ACCESS 
project (ENCePP Home Page). Two other studies found higher incidence rates than previously reported 
with  annual rates ranging between 13.2 to  15.7 cases per million (Countinho, 2012;  Devasagayam, 
2016).  The frequency of peripartum and post-partum cerebral venous thrombosis is about 12  cases per 
100,000  deliveries in pregnant women, which is only slightly  lower than  that of peripartum and 
postpartum arterial stroke. More recently, there has been a significant female predominance among 
young adults, with  the majority of cases (70%  to 80%) being in women of childbearing age, but not 
among children or elderly persons (Tadi, 2020).   
Observed to expected analyses of cases of CVST with  and without  thrombocytopenia by age and sex 
are provided in Table 14 and Table 15,  and Table 16 provides overall Observed to expected analysis.  
Given the absence of publicly available background incidence rates on CVST with  and without 
thrombocytopenia, the  Janssen’s team estimated incidence rates of CVST with and without 
thrombocytopenia using  existing databases for which Janssen has a license. The rates were generated 
using US claims and electronic medical databases. Incident cases of CVST were identified using pre-
defined algorithms, the co-occurrence of CVST and thrombocytopenia was defined as a diagnosis of 
thrombocytopenia or low platelet measurement within  42 days prior to CVST and 14  days after CVST 
index date. The incidence of CVST overall was 1.4/100,000  person-years in females which is in the 
higher range of published data (see Table 16). 
PRAC Rapporteur comment: 
The MAH has provided Observed/Expected (O/E) analysis by age and sex for events of cerebral venous 
sinus thrombosis (CVST) with  and without  thrombocytopenia. Given the absence of publicly available 
background incidence rates on CVST with  and without  thrombocytopenia, the  MAH has estimated 
incidence rates of CVST with  and without  thrombocytopenia using existing databases for which MAH

has a license. The co-occurrence of CVST and thrombocytopenia was defined as a diagnosis of 
thrombocytopenia or low platelet measurement within  42 days prior to CVST and 14  days after CVST 
index date. The incidence of CVST overall was 1.4/100,000  person-years in females which is in the 
higher range of published data. The incidence of CVST with  thrombocytopenia is unknown but  is 
considered to be very rare. 
The MAH has not explained which  cut-off date for post-marketing data that  was used in the analysis, 
which needs further clarification. In addition,  it needs to  be clarified what time frame that  was used to 
calculate the expected rate of these rare events of CVST in combination  with thrombocytopenia (RSI).  
CVST without  thrombocytopenia 
O/E analysis provided by MAH 16th of April 2021 based on the  available post-marketing data: 
Table 15  illustrate the O/E analysis of CVST without  thrombocytopenia stratified by age and sex. One 
event has been reported (female aged 31-41 years), however, lab data regarding thrombocytes has 
not been provided for this  case and it is therefore not  known if the  CVST was accompanied with 
thrombocytopenia or not. A slightly increased O/E point  estimate (1.2) for the subgroup female 35-54 
years was presented based on this case, but since it is not  known if this  case was associated with 
thrombocytopenia or not, and given the very limited data,  the value of the analysis is limited.   
CVST with  thrombocytopenia 
O/E analysis provided by MAH 16th of April 2021 based on the  available post-marketing data: 
Table 14  illustrate the O/E analysis of CVST with  thrombocytopenia stratified  by age and sex. Within 
this O/E analysis, five events of CVST in  combination with thrombocytopenia has been included by the 
MAH.  Even though  the numbers of cases reported are limited, the OE ratios are clearly greater than 
one in women for the different age ranges assessed, as well as for the total  numbers, which  suggests a 
signal of an excess of risk. Furthermore, the O/E lower bounds for the two  younger age ranges are 
clearly above one.  
It is noted that  the analysis does not  include the male aged between 18-28 from the phase III study 
that  was reported with  CVST and thrombocytopenia, in addition, a female subject aged between 52-62 
included in this  analysis had thrombosis located to the legs but not  CVST. The O/E analysis for both 
male aged 18-34  years and female aged 55-64 years old in table 14 and 15 is therefore incorrect. 
Revised, and updated analyses are requested (RSI). 
The O/E analysis (CVST with  thrombocytopenia) based on sex (table 16) showed an increased risk 
compared to expected for female (O/E point estimate 14.4)  whereas the corresponding analysis for 
men showed an O/E point  estimate of 0.  Based on what  is described above, revised, and updated 
analyses are requested (RSI). 
Conclusion  
The O/E analysis is based on very limited date since  CVST in combination with  thrombocytopenia is an 
extremely rare medical condition, and reported cases so far are few. Despite the use of some incorrect 
data, the provided O/E analysis shows a clear signal of increased risk for CVST with thrombocytopenia 
in female subjects aged <64  years compared to what can be expected in this population.

QUESTION  6 
Discussion on potential causal relationship between  vaccination with Covid-19 vaccine 
Janssen and  the events  of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, addressing possible 
pathophysiological mechanism, including potential for platelet  activation. This should 
include all relevant  non-clinical data  and clinical data  and address any potential  role of the 
adenoviral  gene transfer vector. 
MAH  RESPONSE: 
There are currently no data that suggest an obvious causal relationship or pathophysiological 
mechanism specifically linking vaccination with  Janssens COVID-19 vaccine and the events of 
thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. 
While one could speculate around the role of cytokines, that  are elicited by Ad26.COV2.S, in the 
activation of platelets and release of PF4, the  subsequent steps that  lead to  PF4 immunogenicity and 
PF4 antibody production are not  known. In addition, while the induction of cytokines by vaccination 
and viral infections is a general phenomenon, CVST in the presence of thrombocytopenia is extremely 
rare. Indeed, based on the observations that the  incidence of CVST following vaccination with the 
Janssen vaccine is at  a rate predicted for the non-vaccinated population and that these CVST events 
are associated with  thrombocytopenia it  is interesting to speculate that  the inflammation and 
postulated hypercoagulability in some vaccinated individuals is a trigger rather than a cause of CVST in 
individuals with  predisposition to  CVST. The one subject in our clinical trials that developed CVST had 
low platelets, hyper-coagulability and tested positive for PF4  antibodies. This patient also had pre-
existing narrowing of the  sigmoid sinus which  was a predisposing factor for CVST. We are currently 
exploring potential  underlying mechanisms for a relation between induction  of PF4 antibodies and 
vaccination, for instance by analyzing the ability of (parts of) the Ad26 vector, the  spike protein, or 
residual host  cell protein and or host cell DNA in the  vaccine, to form an immunogenic complex with 
PF4, eliciting  PF4 antibodies. This may be further stimulated by Ad26 induced innate immunity. 
Investigation of potential pre-dispositioning for what  is called ‘vaccine-induced immuno 
thrombocytopenia’ (HLA,  polymorphisms in PF4,  Fc receptors, etc) and/or CSVT (genetic, anatomical) 
will be done in collaboration with  experts in the  field. 
Nonclinical safety  data 
An assessment of the potential risk for thromboembolic events or coagulopathies based on nonclinical 
GLP safety data available for Ad26.COV2.S as well as other Ad26-based vaccines is provided in the 
next sections. Overall, these data do not indicate any adverse vaccine-related effect suggestive of an 
increased risk for thromboembolic events or coagulopathies associated with  Ad26.COV2.S or the  Ad26 
platform.  
Ad26.COV2.S 
The nonclinical safety profile of Ad26.COV2.S was evaluated in a 4-week GLP-compliant intermittent 
repeated dose toxicity and local tolerance study in male and female New Zealand  White (NZW)  rabbits 
(study TOX14382).  In this  study, rabbits were injected intramuscularly (IM)  with  a control solution 
(0.9%  sodium chloride) or 1×1011 vp Ad26.COV2.S on three occasions with  a 14-day interval period 
(Days 1, 15,  and 29;  See study design in Table 17).  The animals were followed up until  3 weeks after 
the third  vaccination to assess the potential  reversibility, persistence or delayed occurrence of any 
vaccine-related findings.

Fibrinogen and CRP levels were measured before the first vaccination, Day 2 (CRP only), Day 3, Day 7, 
Day 15 (before injection),  Day 16 (CRP only), Day 17,  Day 21, Day 29 (before injection),  Day 30 (CRP 
only), Day 31 (i.e. 2 days after third  vaccination, at necropsy), Day 35  (i.e. during treatment-free 
period), and Day 50  (end of treatment-free period, at  necropsy). Clinical pathology parameters 
(hematology, coagulation, and clinical chemistry) were determined before the first vaccination, 2  days 
after the first and third vaccination (i.e. on Days 3 and 31,  respectively) and 3 weeks after the third 
vaccination (Day 50; end of treatment-free period). Macroscopic (gross necropsy findings and organ 
weights) and microscopic pathology evaluations of a full tissue list were performed from animals 
sacrificed 2 days (i.e. Day 31)  and 3 weeks after the  third vaccination (i.e.  Day 50). 
The dose administered to the animals (1×1011  vp) is 2-fold above the clinical dose (5x1010 vp). 
Based on a 3 kg rabbit, this  would yield a 33-fold  margin versus a 50 kg human. In addition, the 
animals received three doses versus a single dose which is proposed for the emergency use of 
Ad26.COV2.S in  humans. Further details of the study/design can be found in the report (Study 
TOX14382). Overall, Ad26.COV2.S was well tolerated by the animals and there were no adverse 
vaccine-related effects noted in the study.  A more detailed assessment of potential risk for 
thromboembolic events or coagulopathies based on the nonclinical safety data available for 
Ad26.COV.2S is included below. 
In TOX14382, IM administration  of Ad26.COV2.S at 1x1011 vp on 3 occasions (Days 1, 15, and 29) 
was associated with  mild, transient increases in fibrinogen concentrations on Days 3, 17  and 31 in 
male and female animals (Text Table 12 in  Section 7.8  of the  report; Study TOX14382). These 
increases were partially reversed within one week following vaccine administration, i.e., on Days 7, 21 
and 35. On Days 15 and 29, thus  2 weeks following the  1st and the 2nd vaccine administration, 
respectively, the fibrinogen values were similar to pre-study /  control group values. Also, at the end of 
the recovery period (Day 50, i.e., 3 weeks after the third vaccine administration),  changes in 
fibrinogen concentrations were no longer observed. The maximum mean fold changes in the vaccine 
treated group versus the control group were 1.63x for male animals 2 days after the  3rd vaccine 
administration (i.e., on Day 31)  and 1.85x for female animals 2 days after the 2nd vaccine 
administration (i.e., on Day 17). 
Increases in fibrinogen values are not unique to Ad26 based vaccines and are seen in nonclinical safety 
studies with  various vaccine- and adjuvant modalities or platforms (Baldrick 2016). In toxicity studies 
with  vaccines, fibrinogen is used as a biomarker for inflammatory / acute phase responses following 
vaccination, together with other acute phase proteins such as C-reactive protein (CRP, depending on 
the nonclinical species used) (Green 2015;  Destexhe 2013). The vaccine-induced increases in 
fibrinogen observed with Ad26.COV2.S in  TOX14382 (i.e., up to approximately 1.63x / 1.85x), are 
similar as reported in  rabbits with  other vaccines or adjuvant systems (e.g., Destexhe 2013; Sheets, 
Signal assessment report on Embolic and Thrombotic events (SMQ) with COVID-19 
Vaccine Janssen (Ad26.COV2-S [recombinant]) 
EMA/268126/2021

2008),  and are not deemed adverse. Other changes in coagulation or platelet parameters noted in 
TOX14382 were sporadic, transient and of minimal severity grades, e.g.; In vaccine-treated male 
animals a 12%  decrease in platelets (i.e., 354  x 109/L  versus 402 x 109/L  for control) was observed 
on Day 3, two  days after the  first vaccine administration, and a 7% reduction (i.e., 6.8 sec versus 7.3 
sec for control) of prothrombin time was observed on Day 31, two  days after the third vaccine 
administration. Despite being statistically significant, these two  changes were not  considered vaccine-
related based on their small magnitude  and overlap of individual values on these single occasions with 
the range of control and/or baseline values in the  study. 
No histopathological changes suggestive of a thrombotic event /  coagulopathy or its sequelae were 
seen in  any of the tissues examined in TOX14382, and no local or systemic adverse effects of the 
Ad26.COV2.S vaccine were observed on full-tissue  microscopic examination. 
In addition, in efficacy and immunogenicity studies using nonhuman primates (NHP),  and hamsters no 
pathological evidence of thromboembolic events or coagulopathies was observed in animals that  were 
vaccinated with  Ad26.COV2.S and subsequently challenged with  the SARS-COV-2 virus. In these 
studies, histopathological evaluation of respiratory tract tissues did not  reveal any evidence of 
thrombosis and other coagulopathies in the pulmonary vascular bed in vaccinated animals, including 
breakthrough cases. 
Overall, these (GLP) nonclinical safety data for Ad26.COV2.S do not indicate any adverse vaccine-
related effect suggestive of an increased risk for thromboembolic events or coagulopathies. 
Ad26 vaccine  platform 
As described in the Nonclinical Overview (i.e., Module 2.4 of the cMA package), the MAH  has significant 
nonclinical experience with other Ad26-vectored vaccines using various transgenes encoding for HIV, 
malaria, RSV, Zikavirus, Filovirus (Ebolavirus, Marburgvirus), influenza (Universal influenza) and HPV 
antigens. More than 10  GLP combined repeated dose toxicity and local tolerance studies have been 
performed in rabbits (and one study in  rats) testing  the nonclinical safety of these various Ad26-based 
vaccines. High-level (tabulated) summaries from these studies are provided in Supporting Information: 
Overview of Supportive GLP Toxicology Studies Testing Ad26-vectored Vaccines in Rabbits or Rats 
After IM Injections. 
The various Ad26-based vaccines in these studies were tested either alone, or in 
regimens/combinations with  other vaccine modalities, including Ad35-based vaccines, Modified 
Vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA)-based vaccines and/or (glyco)proteins with  or without  an aluminum 
phosphate adjuvant. The fold changes as indicated in the table are the maximum mean fold changes 
(irrespective of vaccine regimen, sampling time or sex) measured during the study, versus controls. In 
the available studies up to 5 sequential IM  dose administrations have been tested at Ad26 vaccine 
levels up to 4×1011  vp (i.e., up to 8-fold above the  full clinical dose currently used for Ad26.COV2.S), 
covering in life study phases up to  12 weeks (including recovery). Overall, the Ad26-based 
vaccines/regimens in these additional studies were well tolerated and no adverse vaccine-related 
effects were noted in any of the studies. 
In line with  the results described for Ad26.COV2.S above, across these additional studies with  Ad26-
based vaccines a consistent vaccine-related acute phase response was observed, evidenced by 
transient increases in e.g., fibrinogen (up to 2.5-fold)  and CRP (or α2-macroglobulin in rats; study 
TOX12276). The following changes in coagulation parameters were considered vaccine related, and 
hence retained in the respective report summaries; In few studies (e.g. TOX12014,  TOX10931, 
TOX11260 and 1854-09764)  a transient,  minimally shorter prothrombin time (generally less than 
Signal assessment report on Embolic and Thrombotic events (SMQ) with COVID-19

10%) was reported versus controls. Similar minimal shortening of prothrombin time  has been 
described for other adenoviral vaccines (Sheets 2008). Changes in activated partial thromboplastin 
time (APTT) were observed in TOX10931 (0.9x; male animals), and in study 1854-09764  (1.4x). In 
study 1854-09764  a reduction in platelet counts  (0.65x) was observed in animals that  received an 
Ad26-based vaccine following  three preceding vaccinations with  an Ad35-based vaccine. There were 
further miscellaneous changes observed in prothrombin time and/or platelets, as well as other clinical 
pathology parameters in other studies,  which occasionally reached statistical significance. However, 
these changes were not considered vaccine-related, e.g., due to their  sporadic pattern, small 
magnitude, lack of toxicological relevance, and/or relation to  pre-treatment or control ranges. 
Thus, vaccine-related changes in coagulation parameters and platelet counts were minor and not 
consistently observed across studies with  other Ad26-based vaccines. In addition,  similar to study 
TOX14382 with  Ad26.COV2.S, there were no vaccine-related histopathological changes suggestive of a 
thrombotic event / coagulopathy or its sequalae in any of the available studies, which supports the 
conclusion that the  minor changes in coagulation parameters as described above are not adverse. All 
vaccine-related histopathological changes observed in the additional studies with  Ad26-based vaccines 
were consistent  with an anticipated,  non-adverse (local and systemic) immunologic response to 
vaccination. 
Overall, the GLP nonclinical safety data from Ad26.COV2.S and other Ad26-based vaccines summarized 
above do not indicate any adverse vaccine-related effect suggestive of an increased risk or a 
pathogenic mechanism of action for thromboembolic events or coagulopathies associated  with 
Ad26.COV2.S or the Ad26 platform. 
PRAC Rapporteur comment:  
Across the non-clinical studies with  Ad26.COV2.S and other Ad26-based vaccines there were no 
observations indicating an adverse vaccine-related effect on thrombosis and/or thrombocytopenia. The 
study findings were generally limited to mild and transient effects expected from a local and general 
inflammatory reaction subsequent to vaccination. Given the very low incidence of the thromboembolic 
events or coagulopathies associated with Ad26.COV2.S, likely of multifactorial etiology, it is not 
unexpected that  no signals are observed in healthy animals.  
Taken together, the non-clinical data with  Ad26.COV2.S and other Ad26-based vaccines provide no 
further understanding on potential causal relationship between vaccination with  Covid-19 vaccine 
Janssen and the  events of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. 
Regarding clinical assessment of causality, see Q4 and 3.1.4 PRAC Rapporteur Discussion. 
QUESTION  7 
The MAH  is asked  to discuss how, beyond the already  agreed  studies in the PhV  plan, the 
important potential risk venous thromboembolism, including the potential occurrence of the 
combination of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia can be further studied. Ways  of gaining 
further mechanistic data,  both non-clinical and clinical, regarding potential  interactions of 
the Covid-19  vaccine Janssen and  the coagulation system should specifically be addressed; 
and the  following commented: 
PRAC Rapporteur comment: This question will  not be commented in  the first step of this 
assessment.

Page 58/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
QUESTION  8 
Considering the findings of the  review, the  MAH  should discuss the need  for amendment  to 
the Product Information and/or Risk management  plan,  for the latter, including, but not 
limited to, the list of safety concerns and studies specified within the pharmacovigilance 
plan. 
MAH  RESPONSE: 
As described in the responses to the previous questions, the MAH  conducted extensive review of 
available data across its different databases covering the Ad26.COVS.2 and other Ad26-vectored 
clinical development programs, collaborative trials and vaccination programs, and the Ad26.COV2.S 
spontaneous reports. Very rare cases of thrombotic events with  thrombocytopenia have been observed 
to date in individuals who received Ad26.COV2.S with  no cases confirmed for other Ad26 vectored 
vaccines. 
Review of the reported AEs showed that, as of 12 April 2021, the MAH  has 6 post-authorization cases 
of Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST) (4 of which are associated with  low platelets, 2 unknown) 
with  6.8 Million  individuals vaccinated with  the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. While the  observed incidence 
rates of CVST with  Ad26.COV2.S is generally consistent  with what  would be expected, the observed 
incidence rates of CVST with  thrombocytopenia in women appears to higher that  what would be 
expected (Table 9). 
Given the very low incidence of cases observed following vaccination, there is currently insufficient 
data to conclude a causal association with  the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. Based on the current data, MAH 
believes the benefit - risk profile for Janssen Ad26.COV2.S vaccine is positive across the population for 
which it  is currently authorized. 
However, the  MAH strongly supports making vaccinees aware of the signs and symptoms of this very 
rare event, as well as recommendations to health care professionals to ensure the  early and correct 
diagnosis and treatment  of the  patients and reporting of the  events. 
Therefore, the MAH proposes to amend the Product Information to  include information on these 
observed events, to guide healthcare providers, vaccine recipients and the general public regarding 
when to seek urgent medical attention  and to  guide healthcare providers so that  they can promptly 
diagnose and treat people affected, in line with  available guidelines. 
In the current EU Risk Management Plan (RMP, version 1.4  dated 11 March 2021),  Venous 
thromboembolism is considered an Important Potential Risk, and events of Deep vein thrombosis and 
Pulmonary embolism, together with Non-hemorrhagic stroke and Hemorrhagic stroke have been 
identified and are monitored as Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI), in addition to events of 
Immune thrombocytopenia and Disseminated intravascular coagulation. The MAH will  further update 
the Safety Concerns section in the  RMP, to add further details on the  events of thrombotic events 
associated with  thrombocytopenia, update the  PV Plan to include the implementation of processes for 
evaluating thromboembolic events in the clinical trials as described in  Question 7  and to  update the 
Risk Minimization  Measures activities accordingly, including proposed changes to  the Product 
Information. The MAH  will continue  to monitor these events and assess for additional activities as more 
data becomes available. 
The following is proposed by the  MAH regarding updates of the product information:

Section 4.4  
Coagulation disorders and thrombocytopenia  
A combination of venous thrombosis and thrombocytopenia has been observed very rarely following 
vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. This includes cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and can 
lead to a fatal outcome. These cases occurred within  the  first three weeks following  vaccination.  
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and/or 
thrombocytopenia. Those vaccinated should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention  if they 
develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, leg pain or swelling, or progressive 
abdominal pain following  vaccination. Additionally, anyone with  neurological symptoms including 
severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision after vaccination, or who experiences skin bruising 
(petechia) beyond the site of vaccination after a few days, should seek prompt medical attention.   
Since management may be different than usual medical practice for blood clots, healthcare 
professionals should consult applicable guidance and/or consult  specialists (e.g., haematologists) to 
diagnose and treat this  condition. 
Risk of bleeding with  intramuscular administration

Section 2  
Blood disorders 
A combination of blood clots and low levels of ‘platelets’ (cells that help blood to clot) in  the blood has 
been observed very rarely following vaccination with  COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. This includes severe 
cases with  blood clots and, possibly, bleeding, including in the  brain, and can be fatal. These cases 
occurred within  the first three weeks following vaccination.  
Seek immediate medical attention  and inform your health  care provider that you have recently 
received COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen, if you experience severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision, 
unexplained skin bruising beyond the  site of vaccination, develop shortness of breath, chest pain, leg 
pain or swelling, or progressive abdominal pain which appear a few days after vaccination. 
PRAC Rapporteur comments  
Proposed label updates 
The  PRAC  Rapporteur  agrees  with  the  MAH  that  an  update  of  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC,  as  well  as  of 
section  2  of  the  package  leaflet,  is  warranted.  However,  the  proposed  wording  needs  revision  (see 
below).  
In  the  proposal  from  the  MAH,  there  is  a  statement  highlighting  that  management  of  this  condition 
may  differ  from  usual  management  of  blood  clots,  and  therefore  refer  HCPs  to  applicable  guiandanc/ 
specialists for diagnosis and treatment. This statement is fully supported for section 4.4 of the PI.  
Furthermore,  following  evaluation  of  the currently  availble  data,  there  is  sufficient  evidence  to,  with  a 
reasonable  possibilty,  conclude  thrombosis  in  combination  with  thrombocytopenia  being  an  adverse 
drug reaction of the Covid-19 vaccine Janssen. Therefore, update of section 4.8 is warranted.  
Regarding  the  frequency  for  section  4.8,  very  rare  (<  1/  10 000)  is  proposed.  This  is  based  on  one 
certain  clinical  study  case,  and  one  possible  case,  among  a  clinical  safety  database  of  approximately 
27,200  vaccinated subjects, which were part of the safety assessment at approval, and who had been

evaluated  for  death  and  SAEs 4 .  Although  the  MA H  refers  to  a  total  clinical  study  database  of 
approximately  280 000,  the  vast  majority of  this  data  has  not  been  submitted  to  EMA  for  review,  and 
is therefore not considered useful for this estimation of frequency.

also shown  above.

Risk management plan  
As the MAH points  out, the current EU RMP (v. 1.4  dated 11  March 2021), VTE is listed as an 
Important Potential Risk, and various relevant terms are monitored as AESI, in addition  to events of 
Immune thrombocytopenia and Disseminated intravascular coagulation.  
The MAH proposes to further update the Safety Concerns section in the RMP, to add further details on 
the events of thrombotic  events associated with  thrombocytopenia, and to  update the PV Plan as 
described in Question 7, and to update the  RMM in line with  the actions taken for the  PI.  
Details on the  RMP will not be addressed within  this first step of assessment, and thus  not further 
commented here.

3.1.2.  Case reports from EudraVigilance/received through VAERS 
1.. This fatal case concerns a female aged between 38-48, described as Case 1 in section 2.1 above. 
Summary: prior medical history including depression. 1 wk  after vaccination developed headache and 
hemiparesis. CT revealed severe cerebral haemorrhage + CVST, leading to brain herniation and death. 
Thrombocytopenia also mentioned. 
Additional information: SARS-CoV-2 viral assay negative. PF4  heparin HIT ELISA antibody test was not 
done. Platelet nadir 12,000/mm3. 
2.. This case concerns a female aged between 52-62, described as Case 2 in section 2.1 above. No 
additional information compared to above. Summary: Multiple  co-morbidities, including COPD, 
coronary artery disease, hypertension, hypothyroidism and bipolar disorder. 11 days after the 
vaccination the patient had bruising and leg oedema, with a diagnose of severe thrombocytopenia (15) 
and extensive DVT. She had an IVC filter placed. The next day the patient developed arterial 
thrombosis as well (superficial femoral and iliac arteries) requiring thrombectomy + stent. 
3. This clinical trial case concerns a male aged between 18-28,  described as Case 3 in  section 2.1 
above. Summary: no significant prior medical history. Received vaccine and had inflammatory 
syndrome the same day (fever, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, headache) that  improved within  3 days 
(except headache). 9 days after vaccination he had a similar inflammatory syndrome (plus abdominal 
pain, sore throat,  chills and rhinorrhea) and the pt took  ibuprofen. Repeated COVID tests were 
negative. Symptoms improved except headache. 18 days after vaccination the patient had seizures. CT 
scans confirmed cerebral haemorrhage + CVST (2 days later). He  also had moderate 
thrombocytopenia (65).   
Follow-up  adds additional test  results: Anti PF4 antibodies were negative 0.246  (Day 1) and positive 
2.137  (Day 29) and 1.451  (Day 71). On Day 155:  Lyme disease test:  high IgM (interpreted as 
negative), Lupus anticoagulant: normal, N-ELISA: negative. The patient  received heparin which 
complicates interpretation  of anti  -PF4 antibody results. A more definitive causality requires 
confirmation of the PF4 test to  determine if these antibodies are related to  coagulopathy. However, 
based on recent publications including the  Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1 nCov-19 
Vaccination published in The New  England Journal of Medicine on 09  April 2021  which suggests an 
evolving scientifically plausible relationship between immunization with  certain COVID-19 vaccines and 
CVST with  thrombocytopenia and platelet factor 4 (PF4)  antibody, the case is considered possibly 
related by the MAH. 
4. This case concerns a female aged between 17-27,  summarised in Late  breaking information above. 
Summary: no previous medical history or family history of clotting disorders. Non-smoker,  no 
concomitant medications. 16 days after vaccination, she developed headache, vomiting and mental 
status changes. MRI and CT scan revealed sagittal sinus thrombosis and haemorrhage; Platelet count 
on presentation was 18,000,  fibrinogen was low and fibrin D-dimer was elevated. She developed 
seizures, was given a platelet transfusion in advance of thrombectomy and was anticoagulated 
(specific agent not  provided), after which platelet count rose to 160,000  and fibrinogen was 
normalised. Further  outcome unknown. 
Additional information: SARS-CoV-2 viral assay negative. PF4  heparin HIT ELISA antibody positive 
(optical density 2.7).

51 with  unremarkable past medical history who received COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S (date 
unknown). She developed malaise and abdominal pain 11 days following  vaccination and presented to 
an emergency room 3 days later. Evaluation revealed mild anaemia and severe thrombocytopenia 
(platelet count,  13,000 per cubic millimeter). Peripheral blood smear confirmed marked reduction in 
platelet count with  occasional schistocytes. Other laboratory evaluation showed hypofibrinogenemia 
(89 mg/dL),  prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (41 sec), and marked elevation in D-
Dimer (117.5  mg/L), indicating  disseminated intravascular coagulation. Nasopharyngeal swab tested 
negative for SARS-CoV2 by RT-PCR (polymerase chain reaction). 
CT (computerised tomogram) imaging of abdomen/pelvis which  showed extensive splanchnic vein 
thrombosis. The patient developed a new onset headache, and head CT revealed cerebral venous sinus 
thrombosis (CVST) involving right transverse/straight sinus. Initially,  the hospital was not aware that 
the patient  was recently vaccinated, and initiated  treatment with  unfractionated heparin. She 
developed progressive thrombosis with hemorrhagic stroke evident by MRI (magnetic resonance 
imaging)/MRV of brain while on heparin, with  repeat CT angiography showed new thrombus involving 
right hepatic and splenic veins. 
Upon further inquiry it was noted she had received the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine 14 days before symptom 
onset. Screening test for anti-PF4/heparin  antibodies by latex-enhanced immunoassay was negative; 
results of a PF4/polyanion ELISA were strongly positive (3.179  OD [optical density] units; upper limits 
of normal below or equal to 0.399).  Heparin was switched to argatroban. The patient  was also treated 
with  intravenous immunoglobulin  (1 gm/kg times 2  days). Her platelet count increase from 30,000  to 
145,000  over 5 days. She remained critically ill at time of last report. The outcome of the mild 
anaemia, severe thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, cerebral venous sinus 
thrombosis, hemorrhagic stroke, hepatic vein thrombosis, splenic vein thrombosis and splanchnic vein 
thrombosis was not reported. 
Assessor’s comment: additional laboratory tests were reported in the publication  by Gundabolu et al, 
including antiphospholipid  antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, cardiolipin, GpIbeta2 which were all not 
detected/not elevated), normal levels of homocysteine, Factor VIII, antithrombin,  protein C, protein S.

6. This case concerns a female aged between 19-29,  reported to  be overweight (weight/BMI  unknown) 
but  physically active. She has no history or family history of clotting disorder. She is not on any 
medication or birth  control pills. The patient received 1 dose of covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s 
(suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch  number: Unknown)  on an unspecified 
date. Approximately 1 week following vaccination, she developed a severe headache and visited the 
emergency department. The patient  was given paracetamol and an antihistamine  and sent home. The 
patient continued  to have headaches. Approximately another week later, the  patient developed 
abdominal discomfort and rapid heart rate and was seen in the hospital.  Laboratory evaluation 
revealed platelet count of 120,000  (thrombocytopenia), elevated D-Dimer (level unknown)  and normal 
fibrinogen (level unknown). Covid-19 infection was ruled out (exact test unknown). Diagnostic scans 
showed cerebral cavernous sinus thrombosis (coded to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis), portal vein 
thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Initial  treatment with  heparin was stopped and IVIG 
administered after lab result showed positive antibodies to platelet factor 4 (level 3.0).  Platelet count

was reported to have started increasing prior to IVIG administration.  The patient  spent 1-1.5  weeks in 
the hospital and was released home on oral anticoagulants.  The outcome of portal vein thrombosis, 
pulmonary embolism, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, thrombocytopenia was recovering. Additional 
follow up information has been requested. 
7. This case concerns a female aged between 31-41.  The patient's height,  and weight were not 
reported. The patient  received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular 
batch number: 1805029)  dose was not reported for prophylactic vaccination. No  concomitant 
medications were reported.  
9 days after vaccination, the patient was "experiencing headaches 1 week ago", and also had aphasia 
later in the week., on day 16, the patient  went to an outside hospital and was found to have 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage in addition to venous sinus thrombosis and developed intracerebral 
haematoma. On day 17 Computerized tomography (CT) of the head without  contrast showed 
parenchymal hemorrhage and persistent hyperdensity in  the left transverse sinus, consistent with 
known venous sinus thrombosis. Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included: heparin. The 
action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of the  experiencing 
headaches 1 week ago, intracerebral haematoma and venous sinus thrombosis was not  reported. The 
case will  be assessed further when additional information is received. 
Further information: thrombocytopenia (platelet nadir 69,000/mm3).  PF4 heparin HIT  ELISA antibody 
positive (optical density 1.2). SARS-CoV-2 viral assay negative. 
8. This case concerns an adult  male patient  (greater than 50 years old). The patient's weight,  height, 
and medical history were not  reported. The patient received Covid-19 vaccine AD26.Cov2.S 
(suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number was not reported) dose and site of vaccination 
were not  reported, administered for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant  medications were 
reported. On an unspecified date in  2021, the patient  experienced deep vein thrombosis (DVT), 
pulmonary embolism (PE), and kidney bleeding. The patient  was admitted to the hospital  and was 
treated with  heparin as well as an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter (put  in after he experienced bleeding 
from his  kidney). 
Laboratory data included: a negative COVID-19 virus test, and throughout  hospitalization his platelet 
count (NR:  not provided) was normal: 191,000  and 264,000  (units  not provided). The patient's  test 
came back positive for one copy of the Factor  V Leiden mutation  which predisposed him to blood clots. 
At the time of this  report, the patient  was still hospitalized but  doing well. The patient  was recovering 
from DVT, pulmonary embolism, and kidney bleeding 
9. This case concerns a female aged between 21-31  who received the covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s. 
Prescriptions being taken at the time of vaccination was oral contraceptive pill. She presented with  a 
"viral syndrome" including fevers, rigors, muscle pain and shortness of breath. Fever persisted for 1 
day after ER visit, but  she continued to  feel badly. The following day, she was awakened with  severe 
R>L jaw pain, post HA with  standing, pain in  the cartilage on the tip  of her nose and shortness of 
breath. Shortness of breath resolved by 12 days after vaccination. HAS persisted as did  jaw pain and 
pain behind her eyes. On day 11 she noted increasing bruising and periorbital petechiae which 
continued through  when she sought  help from her PcP. She was noted to  have bilateral leg swelling 
R>>L.  She had labs and a Doppler US. She had a syncopal spell on and was brought  to ER at where 
she was diagnosed with  sagittal vein thrombosis, RLE DVT and thrombocytopenia. Medical tests and 
laboratory results related to the  adverse event(s): Plt count 125K;  Plt ct 34K, smear reviewed, no 
clumping, no schistocytes. Ordered hypercoag panel, ANA and Anti PF4/HIT  (awaiting all results) CT

PRAC Rapporteur comment: updated 
Out of the 9 cases found in  EudraVigilance and received through VAERS, concomitant  thrombosis and 
thrombocytopenia was reported in  8 of these; in one case, platelet levels were normal. It  is recognised 
that  a although  thrombosis in a setting  of classical HIT does not  have to result in thrombocytopenia (a 
decrease in platelet levels >50% from baseline is also considered suggestive of HIT, which could thus 
occur also with  platelet levels within  the normal range), the case with normal platelet levels has not 
been considered further. 
For the 8 cases with  concomitant thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, 7  cases were females and 1 was 
male. Age distribution  was 18-59 years. Cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis (CVST) was reported in 7 
cases. Arterial femoral thrombosis in addition  to deep vein thrombosis was reported in  one case. 
Concomitant thrombosis in addition to  CVST was reported in 3 cases, including  portal vein thrombosis 
+ pulmonary embolism, splanchnic vein thrombosis and deep vein thrombosis. Concomitant bleeding 
was reported in 6 cases. 
Platelet counts ranged from 10,000/cmm  to 120,000/cmm  (normal range 150,000-400,000/cmm). 
Elevated D-dimer values were reported in  several cases, which is expected in  patients with  acute 
thrombosis, however, notably high levels were reported in some cases. In three of the  cases, 
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was reported or is considered likely based on provided 
lab values (primarily a combination of thrombocytopenia, increased D-dimer, decreased fibrinogen, 
prolonged aPTT and/or prolonged prothrombin time). 
There was no reported significant medical history in 6 of the cases with  concomitant thrombosis and 
thrombocytopenia. One case had a history of depression (treated with  fluoxetine); one reported 
multiple co-morbidities (including  coronary artery disease / hypertension / asthma / COPD / bipolar / 
depression / hypothyroidism). One female patient  was taking oral contraceptives. 
For the case in  the clinical trial, the male aged between 18-28 the  finding of negative anti-PF  4 
antibodies at baseline that  were positive on day 29 are of high  interest. The comment that  the patient 
received heparin which complicates interpretation of anti-PF4  antibody results is not  considered to 
explain this  finding; based on the  clinical scenario, the patient presented with thrombocytopenia before 
heparin was initiated,  and the platelet count  improved despite heparin treatment. Therefore, in light  of 
recent findings with  anti-PF 4 antibodies having been detected and found pathogenic in patients with 
thrombosis and thrombocytopenia following vaccination with another adenoviral vector COVID-19 
vaccine, the development of such antibodies, in addition to  the overall clinical and laboratory picture, is 
considered to strongly strengthen an association with  the vaccine. 
Positive antibodies to platelet  factor 4 was found in five additional cases. There is no case report in 
which anti-PF4  antibodies were analysed and not  found positive. In a minority of the  cases, a detailed 
work-up has been provided, excluding potential factors of interest including  no antiphospholipid 
antibodies; normal ADAMTS13; no JAK2 gene mutation;  normal levels of homocysteine, Factor VIII, 
antithrombin,  protein C, protein S; no Factor V Leiden R506Q mutation  or prothrombin gene mutation. 
SARS-CoV2 was tested in  3 of the  cases, all of which  were negative.

Deterioration during heparin treatment was reported for one case; in two cases with  concomitant 
thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, platelet count  was reported to have started increasing during 
treatment with  heparin. For the case with  deterioration during  heparin treatment, the  patient was 
diagnosed with  disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and anti-PF4/heparin antibodies by latex-
enhanced immunoassay was negative; results of a PF4/polyanion ELISA were strongly positive. 
It is currently unknown whether treatment with  heparin could be used or should be avoided in patients 
with  thrombotic thrombocytopenia following  COVID-19 vaccination. One argument against use of 
heparin is the  clinical similarity to  HIT (heparin induced thrombocytopenia), in which heparin is part of 
the antigen complex against which  the anti-PF4/heparin-antibodies  can bind, and thus,  in HIT, heparin 
treatment must  be stopped. However, for patients with  thrombotic  thrombocytopenia following 
vaccination, it has been found that  the anti-PF4-antibodies  are not  similar to the  ones in HIT; rather, 
they are directed towards PF4  only. 
For one of the  post-marketing cases with  multiple  thromboses including CVST and thrombocytopenia, 
progressive thromboses were noted during heparin treatment. However, it  cannot be concluded 
whether this was due to heparin or despite heparin. This patient was diagnosed with  DIC, which  is 
well-known to be difficult  to treat regardless of underlying disease or coagulation disorder, and anti-
PF4/heparin antibodies by latex-enhanced immunoassay was negative in that  case. There are two 
other cases (one post-marketing case and one clinical study case) in which  platelet numbers started to 
increase during treatment with  heparin. 
In HIT, effective anticoagulation could be difficult in cases with  severe thrombocytopenia and/or 
bleeding. The labelled anticoagulant therapies for HIT (such as argatroban, danaparoid) are not 
available in many hospitals and warrant certain considerations for correct use. Treatment with  other 
agents is therefore sometimes used, e g fondaparinux and bivalirudin, however, such treatment  is 
strictly considered off-label for HIT. Oral anticoagulation in a patient with  thrombocytopenia is not 
straightforward; vitamin K antagonists are not recommended in HIT or similar clinical entities  due to 
the initial  decrease in protein C associated with  these agents, which could aggravate thromboses 
initially. The DOACs could be an alternative but would  likely not be considered in an unstable patient or 
a patient with  severe thrombocytopenia at high risk of bleeding. 
For patients with  thrombosis without  thrombocytopenia after vaccination, there would  be no or very 
low suspicion of the specific syndrome of thrombotic thrombocytopenia (again, in  HIT, one diagnostic 
criteria is a 50% platelet  count decrease from baseline thus  potentially allowing for values within  the 
normal range – whether this could be the case for thrombotic thrombocytopenia associated with 
vaccination is unknown).  The majority of patients with  thromboses after vaccination will  not have 
concomitant thrombocytopenia. Any message to avoid heparin could potentially cause a delay in 
effective anticoagulation also in these patients. 
In patients with  concomitant thrombosis and bleeding in  whom anticoagulation is considered 
warranted, an ideal anticoagulant agent should be readily available, familiar to  use, and have a rapid 
onset, short half-life and an effective antidote.  To date, the only agents in many situations that  fulfil 
these criteria reasonably well are heparins. The knowledge about thrombotic thrombocytopenia after 
vaccination against COVID-19 is growing rapidly and treatment guidelines/advice are frequently 
updated. Based on the currently available data, it cannot be concluded neither how these patients 
should be optimally managed nor whether heparin is safe and effective or not. Therefore, the 
Rapporteur proposes not to  specifically give advice to avoid heparin in patients  with thrombotic 
thrombocytopenia neither in the  product information nor in the  DHPC. However, it should be clearly 
stated that  specialist advice (such as haematologists or coagulation expertise) should be consulted in

the diagnosis and treatment of suspected thrombotic thrombocytopenia after vaccination. This is also 
considered to be the most long-lasting  wording. 
In addition, for patients with  thrombosis without  thrombocytopenia after vaccination, there would be 
no or very low suspicion of the specific syndrome of thrombotic thrombocytopenia (again, in HIT, one 
diagnostic criteria is a 50% platelet  count decrease from baseline thus  potentially allowing for values 
within  the normal range – whether this  could be the case for thrombotic thrombocytopenia associated 
with  vaccination is unknown).  The majority of patients  with thromboses after vaccination will not  have 
concomitant thrombocytopenia. Any message to avoid heparin could potentially cause a delay in 
effective anticoagulation also in these patients. 
In conclusion, there are currently 8 reported cases in EV and VAERS, all originating from the  US, with 
concomitant thromboembolism (primarily CVST) and thrombocytopenia. The majority (7  out of 8 
cases) are females, with  age range 18-59  years. There are no findings with  regards to previous disease 
or concomitant treatment that  are suggestive of any common risk factors for developing the 
combination of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia; the majority had no medical history and no 
medication. Work-up includes anti-PF4  antibodies in 6 cases, all of which were found positive/strongly 
positive. It is currently unclear if platelet activation testing has been performed; however, a strongly 
positive ELISA result is considered highly suggestive of anti-PF4-antibodies  being a causative factor. 
Extensive work-up was provided in only a minority of the cases, however, no findings suggestive of an 
alternative cause were found in any of these. For the  clinical trial case with  a male patient aged 
between 18-28  with CVST, thrombocytopenia and cerebral haemorrhage, it is noted that  he did not 
have any anti-PF4-antibodies  prior to vaccination but developed these in conjunction with  symptoms of 
thrombosis and thrombocytopenia; this is considered to  strongly support an association with the 
vaccine.

vaccination).    The  diagnosis  of  CVST  and  L-H  is  done  at  the  same 
time.  In  fact  the  vomiting  +  mental  status  changes  +  seizures  are 
probably  due  to  L-H.  Either  the  headache  due  to  CVST  was  not  there 
or  it  was  not  reported.  It  may  be  also  the  case  that  the

PRAC Rapporteur comment: 
Based on the EVDAS search, seven cases of interest from the  SMQ Embolic and thrombotic  events 
were found; these are included in  section 3.1.2  and further discussed there. It is assumed that  the 
other reports (26/33)  that  were not  deemed of interest did not  include any embolic and thrombotic 
events with  concomitant thrombocytopenia. Notably, not only unusual locations of thrombi are of 
interest for this signal but any thrombosis in any location in which  thrombocytopenia is reported should 
be included among cases of interest. 
For the SMQs Haemorrhages and Haematopoietic cytopenias and the HLT Thrombocytopenia, no new 
cases were identified  in which there was sufficient information to suspect a relation to the Covid-19 
Janssen vaccine (excluding cases with  confounding). 
The opinions of the  EMA neurology and haematology experts are fully concurred; however, the 
Rapporteur proposes to avoid the terminology a-HIT-like for the  further review since both  the 
knowledge and the terminology of the combination of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia following 
COVID-19 vaccination are rapidly evolving. The course in one of the cases of very acute onset of illness 
with  severe thrombocytopenia concomitant with  CVST and intracerebral bleeding is found worrisome; 
for the other reports, a more sub-acute course is noted which could enable medical attention  and 
treatment in time  to avoid further deterioration. Outcome is unknown or not yet recovering in the 
majority of cases, with  only two cases reported to be recovering so far.  
3.1.4.  PRAC Rapporteur discussion updated 
At the approval of the CMA for Covid-19 Vaccine Janssen on 11 March 2021,  “Venous 
thromboembolism” was included as important potential  risk in the RMP, due to a numerical imbalance 
of venous thromboembolism observed in the main clinical study, VAC31518COV3001.

On 12 March 2021,  a signal procedure regarding thrombotic  and embolic events was started for 
another adenovirus vector Covid-19 vaccine, which recently has been finalised 5. During that 
assessment, very rare cases showing a combination of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, and in  some 
cases accompanied by bleeding, have gained particular attention.   
For the Covid-19 Vaccine Janssen, a signal procedure was started at the PRAC meeting held on 6-9 
April 2021, due to at that  time in total  four cases with such unusual clinical characteristics of 
thrombosis in combination with  thrombocytopenia, occurring after vaccination with  this vaccine.  
On 15 April 2021, the  MAH responded to questions,  and the  PRAC rapporteur also received further 
information from the  EMA regarding data in Eudravigilance. The latter was updated on 17 April 2021.  
The PRAC Rapporteur assessment to be sent to the PRAC on 19  April 2021,  is the first step in the 
further evaluation of this  signal. As agreed with  the EMA on 15 April 2021,  the aim of this  first step is 
to review of cases of unusual thrombosis in combination with  thrombocytopenia, and taking experience 
gained from a recently finalised signal evaluation 6, and based on that,  evaluate the need for updates of 
the product information, as well as the  need for additional risk minimisation measures. For the AR to 
be sent out on 19 April, 17 April 2021 is the  cut-off for new data. 
A more in-depth evaluation of any mechanistic aspects, as well as of the  pharmacovigilance plan, and 
thereby the  responses to Q7, will be undertaken in the second step of the  assessment of the  MAH 
responses. In addition, review of laboratory results from clinical studies and post-marketing on 
conditions not  predominantly related to  the combination of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia will be 
assessed in more depth in the  second step as well.   
Post marketing exposure  
Regarding cumulative (US) post-marketing exposure, the MAH refers to the  Center of Disease Control 
(CDC), which reports a total  of 7,688,499  doses of the  COVID-19 vaccine Janssen being used as of 15 
April 2021.  
As of 12  April 2021  (of a total  of 6,453,740  doses), it  is estimated, that  approximately 66.5.%  of 
recipients of the  Janssen COVID-19 vaccine were in the 18 to 59  -year age group and approximately 
33.5%  of recipients were in the  ≥60-year age group. However, this  estimation appears based on use of 
all vaccines, and is therefore uncertain.   
The MAH has also specified the approximate number of individuals being within  the 21-day post 
vaccination period as of 13 April; namely 2,489,153  individuals. Although not entirely clear what is 
meant, review of the cumulative presentation above, this exact number of subjects appear to  have 
been more than three weeks ago, and thus  possibly having past the main risk window  for this  unusual 
clinical event.  
By end of March 2021, the  clinical study exposure is estimated to about 286,  000 subjects with  the 
Covid-19 Vaccine Janssen, and more than  200 000  individuals with the  Ad26 platform. In the 
evaluation supporting the CMA on 11 March 2021,  approximately 27,200 vaccinated subjects had been 
assessed in clinical studies for death and SAEs 7. Since the  additional clinical study data referred to by 
the MAH  have not been assessed by EMA, the  safety data base within  the CMA is most relevant one.

Laboratory evaluations  
Questions (Q2, Q3, parts of Q4) were raised regarding laboratory results from clinical studies and from 
post-marketing data, regarding e.g. thrombocytopenia. Further  data presentation is asked for to allow 
final assessment of whether thrombocytopenia without  thrombosis or bleeding, may be caused by the 
Covid-19 vaccine Janssen. Also, further laboratory data are warranted for cases with  thromboembolic 
events in  the clinical studies, to allow for a more precise assessment of frequency of thrombotic 
thrombocytopenia.  
Thrombosis 
Cumulative reviews have also been presented with  respect to thrombosis solely, from clinical studies 
as well as from post marketing experience. These show a numerical imbalance in the  clinical trials with 
regards to overall thromboembolic events (35 individuals who received the vaccine, 27 placebo, 20  still 
blinded). In the phase 3b study in South Africa, five serious cases have been reported with 
thromboembolic events. There are currently 27 post-marketing case reports of thromboembolism; 22 
of these occurred within 28  days following vaccination. Laboratory data to conclude on any 
concomitant thrombocytopenia are however missing in the majority of cases. There are 7 cases of 
cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis (CVST); six of these with  concomitant thrombocytopenia (see 
below) and one in  whom platelet counts are not reported. 
Thrombosis with  thrombocytopenia 
Regarding cases with  thrombotic/ thromboembolic events and low platelets, there is a total of eight 
well described cases and one potential  study case. There is one very well described case from study 
3001,  one additional potential  case in study 3001  (see assessment of Q2) as well as 7 additional post 
marketing cases. Seven of these had CVST; one had concomitant  arterial thrombosis and DVT and one 
had DVT. Three of the cases with  CVST had additional thromboses including splanchnic vein 
thromboses, pulmonary embolism and DVT. One case was fatal. Age ranges from 18-63  years 
(excluding the potential clinical study case for whom very little  information is given, age ranges from 
18-59  years). Seven of the 8 well  described cases are female (all post-marketing). Outcome is 
unknown or not yet recovering in the  majority of cases, with  only two  cases reported to be recovering 
so far. 
It is unclear if treatment  with  heparin could be used in cases with  thrombotic thrombocytopenia 
following COVID-19 vaccination. The antibodies that are considered to  be involved in this  syndrome 
(anti-PF4)  are different from those in  HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). Currently, it  is not 
considered sufficiently justified that  heparin must be avoided (see section 3.1.2  for a more detailed 
discussion). 
O/E analyses  
The O/E analysis submitted by the MAH  is based on very limited date since it  CVST in combination with 
thrombocytopenia is an extremely rare medical condition,  and reported cases so far are few. Also some 
incorrect data are identified among the  few cases included. Nevertheless, despite the use of some 
incorrect data, the  provided O/E analysis shows a clear signal of increased risk for CVST with 
thrombocytopenia in  female subjects aged <64 years compared to what can be expected in this 
population. 
Causality discussion   
Across the non-clinical studies with  Ad26.COV2.S and other Ad26-based vaccines there were no 
observations indicating an adverse vaccine-related effect on thrombosis and/or thrombocytopenia. The 
Signal assessment report on Embolic and Thrombotic events (SMQ) with COVID-19 
Vaccine Janssen (Ad26.COV2-S [recombinant]) 
EMA/268126/2021  
Page 78/99 
 
 
 
 
 
study findings were generally limited to mild and transient effects expected from a local and general 
inflammatory reaction subsequent to vaccination. Given the very low incidence of the thromboembolic 
events or coagulopathies associated with Ad26.COV2.S, likely of multifactorial etiology, it is not 
unexpected that  no signals are observed in healthy animals.  
Taken together, the non-clinical data with  Ad26.COV2.S and other Ad26-based vaccines provide no 
further understanding on potential causal relationship between vaccination with  Covid-19 vaccine 
Janssen and the  events of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. 
The MAH concludes that the  number of thrombotic events with  thrombocytopenia are low and there is 
insufficient data to conclude a definitive causal association with  the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. This is not 
supported. The PRAC Rapporteur considers that  a causal association is sufficiently supported based on 
the following: 
- 
The observed cases with CVST and concomitant thrombocytopenia represent clinical entities that 
are extremely rare in an overall population. Although CVST is well-known  to occur predominantly 
in younger females, often related to hormonal factors such as pregnancy, puerperium or estrogen-
containing medications, concomitant thrombocytopenia is not part of any usual clinical picture for 
CVST. 
- 
The findings of positive anti-PF4-antibodies  in several cases, in one case with  documented non-
existing anti-PF4-antibodies  before vaccination, suggest that  the clinical picture is likely due to 
these antibodies. A similarity with  HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) is evident based on 
the clinical picture; however, there is no known exposure to heparin before the events of 
thrombosis and thrombocytopenia in any of the  reported cases, and in one case, a screening test 
for anti-PF4/heparin antibodies by latex-enhanced immunoassay was negative whereas results of 
a PF4/polyanion ELISA were strongly positive. 
- 
In several cases, there was no apparent risk factor for CVST or other thrombosis or for 
thrombocytopenia. For  a picture of thrombotic thrombocytopenia with positive anti-PF4-
antibodies, this is similar to “spontaneous HIT” which is characterized by a similar clinical and 
laboratory picture in patients without  exposure to heparin; however, some trigger is warranted in 
such cases (such as surgery, infectious disease etc.). The only common trigger in these cases is 
the vaccination with  the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. 
- 
The timing of events is congruent for all of the cases, with  symptoms of thrombosis and/or 
thrombocytopenia occurring within  three weeks from the vaccination. This is also in line with  what 
is known for HIT type II and spontaneous HIT as well as for the thrombotic thrombocytopenia 
related to  another adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine. 
- 
Extensive work-up excluding other potential  causes of thrombosis and/or thrombocytopenia has 
been provided for two  of the cases. This includes antiphospholipid  antibodies, homocysteine, 
Factor VIII, antithrombin,  protein C, protein S, Factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, 
hepatitis/HIV,  ADAMTS 13, PNH  and JAK2. The only abnormality that  could explain the clinical 
picture in these cases was positive anti-PF4-antibodies. 
Furthermore, it remains unknown  how many cases with  thrombosis and concomitant  thrombocytopenia 
that  occurred in the clinical trials with  the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. An imbalance was noted with  regards 
to venous thromboembolism in the initial  assessment of these studies,  with more cases in the vaccine 
vs the  placebo group. However, platelet levels have not been provided for more than  very few of these

cases. In addition, the post-marketing exposure to COVID-19 vaccine Janssen has increased rapidly 
within  recent weeks and thus, the numbers at risk for having developed these symptoms does not 
correspond to actual doses given. 
Based  on the above,  the PRAC Rapporteur considers that ‘thrombotic thrombocytopenia’ 
should be included in the  product information section 4.4 and  4.8. 
Regulatory action  
The MAH concludes that there is insufficient evidence to conclude on a causal relationship with  the 
vaccine, but  strongly supports making vaccinees aware of the signs and symptoms of this  very rare 
event, as well as recommendations to health care professionals to ensure the  early and correct 
diagnosis and treatment  of the  patients and reporting of the  events. Based on that  they propose 
updates of section 4.4  of the SmPC, and of section 2  of the  PL. This is supported, although  the 
proposed wording needs revision. It is currently unknown if heparin could be used in patients with 
thrombotic thrombocytopenia following COVID-19 vaccination; however, the recommendation to 
consult expertise for diagnosing and treatment  decisions in patients  with thrombotic  thrombocytopenia 
is strongly supported. 
As outlined above, following evaluation of the currently availble data, the PRAC rapportuer is of the 
opinion that  therre is suffient evidence to, with  a reasonable possibilty, conclude thrombosis in 
combination with  thrombocytopenia being a very rare adverse drug reaction of the Covid-19 vaccine 
Janssen. Therefore, update of section 4.8 of the SmPC is also warranted.  
Regarding additional risk minimisation measures, a DHPC is warranted to inform health care 
professionals. Draft proposal is attached.   
Evaluation of the RMP, including the  pharmacovigilance plan, will be undertaken in the next step of this 
signal procedure.  
For an oral explanation at the PRAC; the  MAH is asked to address the proposed updates of the product 
information, the proposed DHPC, based on the available data.  
Furthermore, there are a number of issues that  need to  be further clarified by the MAH,  as outlined in 
the RSI below. 
3.2.  Rapporteur’s proposed recommendation 
The PRAC rapporteur recommends updates of section 4.4  and 4.8  of the  SmPC, and of section 2  and 4 
of the Package leaflet. Furthermore, a DHPC is proposed (see Annex).  
The following wording is proposed, based on the MAH’s  proposal.  
Section 4.4  
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
A combination of venous thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, in some cases accompanied by bleeding,

reported. These cases occurred within  the first three weeks following vaccination, and mostly in women 
under 60 years of age.  
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and/or 
thrombocytopenia. Those vaccinated should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention  if they 
develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, or persistent abdominal pain 
following vaccination. Additionally, anyone with  neurological symptoms including  severe or persistent 
headaches or blurred vision after vaccination, or who experiences skin bruising (petechia) beyond the 
site of vaccination after a few days, should seek prompt medical attention.   
Since management may be different than usual medical practice for thromboembolic events if patients 
present with concomitant  thrombocytopenia, healthcare professionals should consult applicable 
guidance and/or consult specialists (e.g., haematologists, specialists in  coagulation) to  diagnose and 
treat this  condition.

Blood disorders 
A combination of blood clots and low levels of ‘platelets’ (cells that help blood to clot) in  the blood has 
been observed very rarely following vaccination with  COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. This includes severe 
cases with  blood clots and, in  unusual locations, such as the brain and liver, in some cases in 
combination with  bleeding. These cases occurred within  the first three weeks following vaccination, and 
occurred mostly in women below 60  years of age. Fatal outcome has been reported. 
Seek immediate medical attention,   if you experience severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision, 
unexplained skin bruising beyond the  site of vaccination which appear a few days after vaccination, 
develop shortness of breath, chest pain, leg pain or swelling,  or persistent abdominal pain. Inform your 
health care provider that  you have recently received COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen.

Proposed updates of the  product information 
Proposal to send out a DHPC 
Explain  why  some  of  the  requested  information  has  not  been  submitted  as  asked  for,  and 
comment on if / how this will  be improved in  the future.  
3.2.2.  Request for supplementary information   
3.2.2.1.  Immediate  RSI (to be submitted by 19 April 2021, at  20:00) 
•  Based on Response Table 6, there appears to be one additional  clinical study  case (study 3001) 
with  concomitant thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. Full  details on this case including  a 
complete CIOMS report should be provided, along with  a discussion on why this  case was not 
included in the presentation of clinical study cases of concomitant thrombosis and 
thrombocytopenia. 
3.2.2.2.  Subsequent RSI  
• 
For a casein study 3001,  it should be clarified when the  tests for PF4  antibodies actually were 
performed, as well as reported to the  investigator, and when the  sponsor/MAH became aware 
of these results.   
•  Questions (Q2, Q3, parts of Q4) were raised regarding laboratory results from clinical studies 
and from post-marketing data, regarding e.g. thrombocytopenia. Further data presentation is 
asked for to  allow final assessment of whether thrombocytopenia without  thrombosis or 
bleeding, may be caused by the Covid-19 vaccine Janssen.  
In that  presentation, the  cases of ‘haematopoietic cytopenias’ in the  clinical trials should be 
further detailed specifically addressing whether any of these are attributable  to 
thrombocytopenia. 
• 
• 
Laboratory data, primarily CBC/platelet counts remain missing for the majority of cases with 
thromboembolism in  both the clinical trials as well as post-marketing. Additional information on 
CBC/platelet levels are expected to be presented for these cases, including all cases with 
thromboembolic events regardless of location and severity.  
For COVID3012 SISONKE, an open lable single arm Phase 3b study in  South Africa, there were 
five cases of thromboembolism that  occurred between less than  24 hours and 23 days after 
vaccination. Normal platelet  counts have been provided for only one of these; for one case, 
pulmonary embolism was diagnosed post mortem and is thus  not expected to provide further 
laboratory testing.  For the remaining three cases, platelet levels are expected to be submitted.

In the Responses Table 5, there were 13  subjects with  ‘AEs of interest’ of venous or arterial 
thrombosis in the clinical studies. There appears to be an additional 19 or 22 cases (different 
numbers appear in the Responses) with events of thromboembolism in the clinical studies. The 
MAH  should summarise the main reasons for not including  the additional cases among AEs of 
interest. Notably, laboratory data (primarily CBC/platelet counts)  are expected for all cases. 
For the O/E analysis, it is noted that  the the 18-28-year-old male from the phase III study  that 
was reported with  CVST and thrombocytopenia has not been included, in addition, the 52-62-
year-old female subject included in this analysis had thrombosis located in the legs but not 
CVST. Revised, and updated analyses, with  the most current amount of data are requested.  
It is not clear which cut-off date that  was used for post-marketing data in the  O/E analysis, 
which should be provided. Furthermore, the MAH  should provide the time frame that  was used 
to calculate the expected rate of these rare events of CVST in combination with 
thrombocytopenia. 
•  One case of capillary leak syndrome was reported among cases described for this signal. This 
condition should be followed up in monthly safety summary reports. 
3.3.  Comments from other PRAC members and MAH  
Updated information on the cases with  CVST and concomitant thrombocytopenia has been provided 
after the circulation of the preliminary AR; these data have been incorporated into sections 3.1.2, 
3.1.3  and 3.1.4  (highlighted). 
Member  state  1 comments 
We generally endorse the assessment report and the proposed recommendation. 
However,  
1) considering sparse data, the statement ”These cases occurred […] mostly in women under 60 years 
of  age”  (used  throughout  in  PI  and DHPC)  does  not allow  for  defining  age-based  risk  groups  and  may 
be omitted 
2)  the  TTO’s  stated  in  2.1  ”Time  to  onset  included  11  days  (n=2)  and  19  days  (n=1)”,  seems  at odds 
with  the  case  narratives  presented  (  Case  1:  7  days?,  Case  2:  11  days, Case  3: CNS  symptoms  from 
day 11). 
PRAC Rapporteur Comment 
We  agree  that  the  data   are  sparse,  however, the  clear  trend  of  cases  reported  being  mostly  women 
under  60  years  of  age  is  considered  of  high  relevance  for  prescribers  (this  wording  is  also  proposed  in 
order to avoid different wordings as compared to another covid-19 adenoviral vector vaccine). 
For section 2.1, this was part of the signal validation with limited information at hand. Notably, the first 
three cases in the table 1A in section 3.1.3 tha t shows a summary over cases in Eudravigilance are not 
the  same  cases  as  those  that  were  available  at  the  signal  validation  stage  (the  three validation  cases 
are Cases no 2, 5 and 7 in  the EudraVigilance table).

We  overall  support  the  PRAC  Rapp´s assessment  however  we  propose  some  changes  in  the  proposed 
wording  in  the  Section  4.4.  of  the  SmPC:  We  propose  not  to  include  the  recommendation  on  the 
treatment of combination of thrombosis and thrombocytopaenia as specific treatment for this condition 
is not known a t  this time. Additionally, the term „venous“ should be  deleted from the first sentence as 
arterial  thrombosis  is  also  stated  as  one  example  of  unusual  type of  thrombosis.  The  last  sentence  in 
the proposed wording was probably copied by mistake. 
Section 4.4  
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
A  combination  of  venous  thrombosis  and  thrombocytopenia,  in  some  cases  accompanied  by  bleeding, 
has  been  observed  very  rarely  following  vaccination  with  COVID-19  Vaccine  Janssen.  This  includes 
venous  thrombosis  at  unusual  sites  such  as  cerebral  venous  sinus  thrombosis,  splanchnic  vein 
thrombosis, as well as arterial thrombosis concomitant with thrombocytopenia. Fatal outcome has been 
reported. These cases occurred within the first three weeks following vaccination, and mostly in women 
under 60 years of age.  
Healthcare  professionals  should  be  alert  to  the  signs   and  symptoms  of  thromboembolism  and/or 
thrombocytopenia.  Those vaccinated  should  be  instructed  to  seek  immediate medical  attention  if  they 
develop  symptoms  such  as  shortness  of  breath,  chest  pain,  leg  swelling,  or  persistent  abdominal  pain 
following  vaccination.  Additionally,  anyone  with  neurological  symptoms  including  severe  or  persistent 
headaches or  blurred  vision  after  vaccination,  or  who  experiences  skin  bruising  (petechia)  beyond  the 
site of vaccination after a few days, should seek prompt medical attention.  
Since management may be different than usual medical practice for thromboembolic events if patients  
present  with  concomitant  thrombocytopenia,  healthcare  professionals  should  consult  applicable 
guidance  and/or  consult  specialists  (e.g.,  haematologists,  specialists  in  coagulation)  to  diagnose  and 
treat this  condition. 
PRAC Rapporteur Comment 
We fully agree to delete the  word ‘venous’ from the first sentence in the SmPC section 4.4. 
For  the  proposed  recommendation  on  management,  we  consider  that  it  is  of  high  relevance  to  inform 
prescribers  that  these  cases  will  likely  warrant  special  considerations  and  early  involvement  with 
specialists.  Some  amendments  are  however  proposed,  see  also  comment  from  BE  and  updated 
proposal for section 4.4 below (AR section 3.4). 
The  last  sentence  has  been  added  as  a  new  sub heading,  for  clarity  in  relation  to  the  current  text  in 
section 4.4.  
Member  state  3 comments 
Overall,  member  state  3  agrees  with  the  high  quality  assessment  report  and  conclusions,  also 
considering the  short time frame and some issues in  data presentation. 
Member state 3  f ully agrees that available data are sufficient to support a plausible causal association 
and the inclusion of thrombosis in combination with  thrombocytopenia in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
A  combination  of  venous  thrombosis  and  thrombocytopenia,  in  some  cases  accompanied  by  bleeding, 
has  been  observed  very  rarely  following  vaccination  with  COVID-19  Vaccine  Janssen.  This  includes 
severe  cases  of  venous  thrombosis  at  unusual  sites  such  as  cerebral  venous  sinus  thrombosis, 
splanchnic  vein  thrombosis,  as  well  as  arterial  thrombosis  concomitant  with  thrombocytopenia.  Fatal 
outcome  has  been  reported.  These  cases  occurred  within  the  first  three  weeks  following  vaccination, 
and mostly in women under 60 years of age.  
Healthcare  professionals  should  be  alert  to  the  signs   and  symptoms  of  thromboembolism  and/or

In  general,  we  agree  with  the  case  descriptions  and  agree  that  a  causal  association  is  sufficiently 
supported by the  data submitted. 
The request for supplemental information is supported.  
We  agree  with  the  proposed  wording  in  SmPC  and  PIL,  being  in  line  with  that  previously  included  for 
the AstraZeneca vaccine, in particular the  wording in SmPC 4.4. 
In  SmPC  4.4  the  following  sentence  is  added:  Risk  of  bleeding  with  intramuscular  administration.  We 
suggest adding the common phrase used for other vaccines for IM administration: 
As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving 
anticoagulant  therapy  or  those  with  thrombocytopenia  or  any  coagulation  disorder  (such  as 
haemophilia)  because  bleeding  or  bruising  may  occur  following  an  intramuscular  administration  in 
these individuals. 
We  propose  the  current  potential  risk of  Venous  thromboembolism  to  be  upgraded  to  identified  risk  in 
the RMP. 
We have no objections to  the proposed DHPC and the  proposed communication plan. 
PRAC Rapporteur Comment 
For  the  intramuscular  administration,  what  is  new  is  the  subheading  “Risk  of  bleeding  with 
intramuscular administration”. Other than that,  the text  proposed is already included in section 4.4. 
For the RMP, this  will be further assessed within the  next round of this  procedure.

Overall, IT Member state 9 endorses the  PRAC Rapporteur’s assessment report and conclusion. 
Moreover, we strongly support that  further details are needed on cases of ‘haematopoietic cytopenias’ 
from the  clinical trials, since it  is considered relevant to investigate the risk of thrombocytopenia, also 
in light  of the imbalance observed for adenovirus platform [“Platelet count decrease was observed 
following 70 out  of 4,105  Ad26 doses (1.7%)  and 7 out of 719 placebo doses (1.0%)”].  
Conclusions on this  issue might be reflected in the product information, as appropriate. 
Some comments to the proposed DHPC have been also formulated (see attachment).

2021,  I am hereby providing you the below documentation: 
• MAH’s  proposed DHCP letter in  Track changes 
• MAH  proposed EUPI, clean and Track changes version 
• CIOMS report for one Subject  
The response to question below will be submitted shortly, today: 
“Based  on Response  Table  6,  there  appears  to  be  one additional  clinical  study  case  (study  3001)  with 
concomitant  thrombosis  and  thrombocytopenia.  Full  details   on  this  case  including   a  complete  CIOMS 
report  should  be  provided,  along  with  a  discussion  on  why  this  case  was  not  included  in  the 
presentation of clinical study cases of concomitant thrombosis and thrombocytopenia”. 
As requested, the response to the additional questions listed in the PRAC AR will be submitted by April 
23rd, 2021. 
Revised wording for PI  
The  MAH  has  accepted  the  wording  for  section  4.4  as  outlined  in  the  PRAC Rapp’s  AR  of  19  April,  but 
has  also  proposed  additional  wording  (see  below).  For  section  4.8,  the  wording  proposed  by  the  PRAC 
rapporteur has been agreed, without  revision.   
Section 4.4  
A combination of venous thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, in some cases accompanied by bleeding, 
has been observed very rarely (with an approximate incidence of 1-2  cases per 1 million vaccinations 
after the first 7.9 million vaccinations) following vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. This 
includes venous thrombosis at unusual sites such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, splanchnic vein 
thrombosis as well as arterial thrombosis, concomitant with  thrombocytopenia. Fatal outcome has been 
reported. These cases occurred within  the first three weeks following vaccination, and mostly in women 
under 60 years of age.  
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and/or 
thrombocytopenia. Those vaccinated should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention  if they 
develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, or persistent abdominal pain 
following vaccination. Additionally, anyone with  neurological symptoms including  severe or persistent 
headaches or blurred vision after vaccination, or who experiences skin bruising (petechia) beyond the 
site of vaccination after a few days, should seek prompt medical attention.  
Since management may be different than usual medical practice for thromboembolic events if patients 
present with concomitant  thrombocytopenia, healthcare professionals should consult applicable 
guidance and/or consult specialists (e.g., haematologists, specialists in  coagulation) to  diagnose and 
treat this  condition.

MAH  comment:  The  Company  proposes  to  include  the  frequency  rate  to  clarify  the  very  rarely 
statement,  as  this  could  be  interpreted  as  1  in  10,000,  which  would  be  an  over  estimate;  namely  by 
adding (with an approximate incidence of 1-2 cases per 1 million vaccinations after the first 7.9 million 
vaccinations).  
PRAC rapporteur comment: The MAH has accepted the proposed wording for section 4.4, as outlined in 
the  AR  of  19  April  21.  In  addition,  they  proposed  to  add  an  approximate  incidence  (with  an 
approximate incidence of 1-2  cases per 1 million vaccinations after the  first 7.9 million vaccinations). 
This is not agreed. The proposed incidence is very uncertain and is likely an underestimation; see also 
PRAC Rapp’s comments to Q8 above.  
The  PRAC Rapp’s  proposal  of  19  April  for  section  4.8,  and  the  PIL,  both  section  2  and  4  is  agreed  by 
the MAH.   
Furthermore,  the  same  wording  as  in  4.4  regarding  awareness,  signs  and  symptoms  is  added  to  a 
section on ‘The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:’, which is endorsed. 
It should reflect the finally agreed wording, accordingly.

PRAC rapporteur comment: For the DHPC,  the MAH proposes to add the frequency as proposed for the 
SmPC,  which  is  not  agreed.  Some  other  smaller  comments  have  also  been  proposed.  These  will  be 
considered together with  other comments received from MSs

A combination of blood clots and low levels of ‘platelets’ (cells that help blood to clot) in  the blood has 
been observed very rarely following vaccination with  COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. This includes severe 
cases with  blood clots, including in unusual locations such as the brain, liver, bowel and spleen, in 
some cases in combination with  bleeding. These cases occurred within  the first  three weeks following 
vaccination and occurred mostly in women below 60 years of age. Fatal outcome has been reported. 
Seek immediate medical attention  if you experience severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision, 
unexplained skin bruising beyond the  site of vaccination which appear a few days after vaccination, 
develop shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, or persistent abdominal pain. Inform your health 
care provider that  you have recently received COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen.

experiences skin bruising (petechia) beyond the site of vaccination after a few days, should 
seek prompt medical attention.  Thrombosis in  combination with thrombocytopenia requires 
specialised clinical management. Healthcare professionals should consult applicable guidance 
and/or consult specialists (e.g., haematologists, specialists in coagulation) to diagnose and 
treat this  condition. 
3.4.1.1.  Subsequent RSI  
•  As shortly outlined  above under section 2, the responses submitted  by the  MAH on 29 March 
2021,  at the time of when the signal was under initiation,  were of poor quality. Further,  at the 
oral explanation at the PRAC on 7 April 2021,  key data for the current evaluation (namely 
available post marketing cases) was not  included in the slide deck shown to the PRAC. These 
shortcomings have been feed back to the MAH.  Despite requests in Q4 of all information on all 
available data, as well as case narratives for important cases in the clinical studies, certain 
important information seems to  be  missing. This is a major shortcoming. Several questions 
are raised in  the RSI and should be submitted  for review.  
• 
For case a case in study 3001,  it should be clarified when the  tests for PF4  antibodies actually 
were performed, as well as reported to the investigator, and when the sponsor/MAH became 
aware of these results.   
•  Questions (Q2, Q3, parts of Q4) were raised regarding laboratory results from clinical studies 
and from post-marketing data, regarding e.g. thrombocytopenia. Further data presentation is 
asked for to  allow final assessment of whether thrombocytopenia without  thrombosis or 
bleeding, may be caused by the Covid-19 vaccine Janssen.  
In that  presentation, the  cases of ‘haematopoietic cytopenias’ in the  clinical trials should be 
further detailed specifically addressing whether any of these are attributable  to 
thrombocytopenia. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Laboratory data, primarily CBC/platelet counts remain missing for the majority of cases with 
thromboembolism in  both the clinical trials as well as post-marketing. Additional information on 
CBC/platelet levels are expected to be presented for these cases, including all cases with 
thromboembolic events regardless of location and severity.  
For COVID3012 SISONKE, an open lable single arm Phase 3b study in  South Africa, there were 
five cases of thromboembolism that  occurred between less than  24 hours and 23 days after 
vaccination. Normal platelet  counts have been provided for only one of these; for one case, 
pulmonary embolism was diagnosed post mortem and is thus  not expected to provide further 
laboratory testing.  For the remaining three cases, platelet levels are expected to be submitted.  
In the Responses Table 5, there were 13  subjects with  ‘AEs of interest’ of venous or arterial 
thrombosis in the clinical studies. There appears to be an additional 19 or 22 cases (different 
numbers appear in the Responses) with events of thromboembolism in the clinical studies. The 
MAH  should summarise the main reasons for not including  the additional cases among AEs of 
interest. Notably, laboratory data (primarily CBC/platelet counts)  are expected for all cases. 
For the O/E analysis, it is noted that  the the 18-28-year-old male from the phase III study  that 
was reported with  CVST and thrombocytopenia has not been included, in addition, the 52-62-

year-old female subject included in this analysis had thrombosis located in the legs but not 
CVST. Revised, and updated analyses, with  the most current amount of data are requested.  
• 
It is not clear which cut-off date that  was used for post-marketing data in the  O/E analysis, 
which should be provided. Furthermore, the MAH  should provide the time frame that  was used 
to calculate the expected rate of these rare events of CVST in combination with 
thrombocytopenia. 
•  A stratified analysis by gender of the populations exposed should be provided. 
•  One case of capillary leak syndrome was reported among cases described for this signal. This 
condition should be followed up in monthly safety summary reports. 
For the case with  concomitant DVT and low platelet counts (3031775)  in a male aged between 56-66 
study subject in study 3001,  this case should be discussed in more detail, including a discussion on the 
laboratory findings at admission that indicate coagulopathy. In light of recent findings, a discussion on 
whether this could be a case of thrombotic thrombocytopenia related to the Covid-19 Vaccine Janssen 
should be provided. Any previous CBC/platelet counts in the medical history of this  case should be 
provided. 
3.5.  Adopted PRAC recommendation 
The  PRAC  has reviewed  the  available evidence on  the  occurrence  of  thromboembolic events  following 
the  administration  of  COVID-19  Vaccine  Janssen,  including  data  ascertained  from  spontaneous  case 
reports  identified  in  EudraVigilance,  clinical  trials and  additional  data  from  the  MAH.  The  evaluation  of 
the  data  revealed  eight  reports  of  interest,  which  included  severe  cases  of  venous  thrombosis  at 
unusual sites such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, splanchnic vein thrombosis, as well as arterial 
thrombosis  concomitant  with  thrombocytopenia.  Fatal  outcome  has  been  reported.  These  cases 
occurred  within  the  first  three  weeks  following  vaccination,  and  mostly  in  women  under  60  years  of 
age.  
PRAC  is  of  the  view  that  there  is  sufficient  evidence  to  conclude,  with  a  reasonable  possibility,  that 
thrombosis  in  combination  with  thrombocytopenia  can  be  considered  as  a  very  rare  adverse  drug 
reaction of the Covid-19 Vaccine Janssen. 
Regarding  additional  risk  minimisation  measures,  a  DHPC  is  warranted  to  inform  health  care 
professionals. 
The  PRAC  recommends  that  the  MAH  for  Covid-19  Vaccine  Janssen  (Janssen-Cilag  International  NV) 
should  submit  a  variation  to  amend  the  product  information  as  described  below  (new  text 
underlined/text to be removed with strikethrough):

Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) 
Section 4.4  
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
A combination of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, in some cases accompanied by bleeding, has been 
observed  very rarely  following vaccination  with  COVID-19  Vaccine  Janssen.  This  includes  severe  cases 
of  venous  thrombosis  at  unusual  sites  such  as  cerebral  venous  sinus  thrombosis,  splanchnic  vein 
thrombosis, as well as arterial thrombosis concomitant with thrombocytopenia. Fatal outcome has been 
reported. These cases occurred within the first three weeks following vaccination, and mostly in women 
under 60 years of age.  
Healthcare  professionals  should  be  alert  to  the  signs   and  symptoms  of  thromboembolism  and/or 
thrombocytopenia.  Those vaccinated  should  be  instructed  to  seek  immediate medical  attention  if  they 
develop  symptoms  such  as  shortness  of  breath,  chest  pain,  leg  swelling,  or  persistent  abdominal  pain 
following  vaccination.  Additionally,  anyone  with  neurological  symptoms  including  severe  or  persistent 
headaches or  blurred  vision  after  vaccination,  or  who  experiences  skin  bruising  (petechia)  beyond  the 
site of vaccination after a few days, should seek prompt medical attention.   
Thrombosis 
in  combination  with  thrombocytopenia  requires  specialised  clinical  management. 
Healthcare  professionals  should  consult  applicable  guidance  and/or  consult  specialists  (e.g., 
haematologists, specialists in coagulation) to  diagnose and treat this condition.

The MAH should distribute a direct healthcare professional communication (DHPC) according to the text 
and communication plan agreed with the  CHMP (see Annex). 
The  MAH  for  COVID-19  Vaccine  Janssen  (Janssen-Cilag  International  NV)  is  also  requested  to  submit, 
responses to the following list  of questions: 
1.  As  shortly  outlined  above  under  section  2,  the  responses  submitted  by  the  MAH  on  29  March 
2021, at the  time of when the  signal was under initiation, were of poor quality.  Further, a t the

4.  In  that  presentation,  the  cases  of  ‘haematopoietic  cytopenias’  in  the  clinical  trials  should  be 
further  detailed  specifically  addressing  whether  any  of 
these  are  attributable 
to  
thrombocytopenia. 
5.  Laboratory  data,  primarily  CBC/platelet  counts  remain  missing  for  the  majority  of  cases  with 
thromboembolism in both the clinical trials as well as post-marketing. Additional information on 
CBC/platelet  levels  are  expected  to  be  presented  for  these  cases,  including  all  cases  with 
thromboembolic events regardless of location and severity.  
6.  For COVID3012 SISONKE, an open label single arm Phase 3b study in South Africa, there were 
five  cases  of  thromboembolism  that  occurred  between  less  than  24  hours  and  23  days  after 
vaccination.  Normal  platelet  counts  have  been  provided  for  only  one  of  these;  for  one  case, 
pulmonary  embolism  was  diagnosed  post  mortem  and  is  thus  not  expected  to  provide  further 
laboratory testing.  For the remaining three cases, platelet levels are expected to be submitted.  
7.  In  the  Responses  Table  5,  there  were  13  subjects  with  ‘AEs  of   interest’  of  venous  or  arterial 
thrombosis  in  the  clinical  studies.  There  appears  to  be  an  additional  19  or  22  cases  (different 
numbers appear in the Responses) with events of thromboembolism in the clinical studies. The 
MAH  should  summarise  the  main  reasons  for  not  including  the  additional  cases  among  AEs of 
interest. Notably, laboratory data (primarily CBC/platelet counts)  are expected for all cases. 
8.  For  the  O/E  analysis,  it  is  noted  that  the  18-28-year-old  male  from  the  phase  III  study  that 
was  reported  with  CVST  and  thrombocytopenia  has  not  been  included,  in  addition,  the 52-62-
year-old  female  subject  included  in  this  analysis  had  thrombosis  located  in  the  legs  but  not 
CVST. Revised, and updated analyses, with  the most current amount of data are requested.  
9.  It  is  not  clear  which  cut-off  date  that  was  used  for  post-marketing  data  in  the  O/E  analysis, 
which should be provided. Fur thermore, the MAH should provide the  time frame that  was used 
to  calculate  the  expected  rate  of  these  rare  events  of  CVST  in  combination  with 
thrombocytopenia. 
10. A stratified analysis by gender of the populations exposed should be provided. 
11. One  case of  capillary  leak  syndrome  was  reported  among  cases  described for  this  signal.  This 
condition should be followed up in monthly safety summary reports. 
12. For the case with concomitant DVT and low platelet counts (3031775) in a male  aged between 
56-66  study  subject  in  s tudy  3001,  this  case  should  be  discussed  in  more  detail,  including   a 
discussion on the laboratory findings at admission that indicate coagulopathy. In light of recent 
findings,  a  discussion  on  whether  this  could  be  a case  of  thrombotic  thrombocytopenia  related 
to  the  Covid-19  Vaccine  Janssen  should  be  provided.  Any  previous  CBC/platelet  counts  in  the 
medical history of this case should be provided. 
13. The  MAH  should  discuss  whether  there  is  a  need  to  further  revise  the  product  information,  to 
advice  against  use  of  the  Covid-19  vaccine  Janssen,  in  a  subject  who  has  developed 
thrombosis  in  combination  with  thrombocytopenia,  including  after  vaccination  with  any  Covid-
19 vaccine. Revision of sections 4.3 and / or 4.4 should be addressed. 
Post  opinion  note: During the Oral explanation provided by Janssen Cilag International N.V. to PRAC 
on  the  20th  of   April,  further  clarification  was   provided  on  a  number  of  issues  raised  within  the

DHPC 
COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen: link between the vaccine and the 
occurrence of thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia 
Dear Healthcare Professional, 
Janssen-Cilag International NV in  agreement with the  European Medicines Agency and the <National 
Competent Authority > would like to inform you of the following: 
Summary 
•  A combination of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, in some cases 
accompanied by bleeding, has been observed very rarely following 
vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. A causal relationship with the 
vaccine is considered plausible.  
•  These cases occurred within the first three weeks following vaccination, and 
mostly in women under 60 years of age. 
•  No specific risk factors have been identified at this stage. 
•  Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of 
thromboembolism and/or thrombocytopenia. 
•  Those being vaccinated should be instructed to seek immediate medical 
attention if they develop symptoms of thromboembolism and, or 
thrombocytopenia following vaccination. 
•  Thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia requires specialised 
clinical management.  Consult applicable guidance and/or specialists (e.g., 
haematologists, specialists in coagulation) to diagnose and treat this 
condition. 
Background on the safety  concern 
COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen suspension for injection is indicated for active immunisation to prevent 
COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in individuals 18 years of age and older.  
A combination of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, in  some cases accompanied by bleeding, has been 
observed very rarely following vaccination with  COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen. This includes severe cases 
of venous thrombosis at unusual sites such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, splanchnic vein 
thrombosis, as well as arterial thrombosis concomitant with  thrombocytopenia. Fatal outcome has been 
reported. These cases occurred within  the first three weeks following vaccination, and mostly in women 
under 60 years of age.  
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and/or 
thrombocytopenia. Those vaccinated should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention  if they 
develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, or persistent abdominal pain 
following vaccination. Additionally, anyone with  neurological symptoms including  severe or persistent

headaches or blurred vision after vaccination, or who experiences skin bruising (petechia) beyond the 
site of vaccination after a few days, should seek prompt medical attention.  
In several of the cases with  concomitant thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, testing  for anti-platelet 
factor (PF) 4-antibodies was positive or strongly positive. Extensive work-up for other potential 
mechanisms that  could cause thrombosis and/or thrombocytopenia has been provided for a minority of 
these cases; however, no other abnormalities have been found that are considered to explain the 
observed events. However, the  exact pathophysiological mechanism for the occurrence of these 
thrombotic events is not defined yet. No  specific risk factors have been identified  at this stage. 
Thrombosis in combination with  thrombocytopenia requires specialised clinical management. 
Healthcare professionals should consult  applicable guidance and/or consult specialists (e.g., 
haematologists, specialists in coagulation) to  diagnose and treat this condition. 
The Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, PRAC, one of EMA’s scientific committees, has 
performed a thorough  investigation including a review of case reports of blood clots and 
thrombocytopenia in  individuals who received the vaccine and has also evaluated an observed to 
expected analysis.  
Based on the current evidence, the PRAC has recommended an update to the  product information to 
reflect the  current knowledge of this safety issue. This comprises an update of the  warning section, as 
well as inclusion of thrombosis in combination with  thrombocytopenia as an adverse reaction with  a 
frequency of very rare.  
Call for reporting  
Healthcare professionals should report any suspected adverse reactions associated with  the use of 
COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen in accordance with the national  spontaneous reporting system <include the 
details (e.g. name, postal address, fax number, website address) on how to  access the national 
spontaneous reporting system>.   
 This product is subject to additional monitoring. This will  allow quick identification  of new safety 
information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.

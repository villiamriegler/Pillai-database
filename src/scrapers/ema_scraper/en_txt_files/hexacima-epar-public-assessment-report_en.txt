2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Hexacima has been developed to provide protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, 
poliomyelitis, hepatitis B and invasive infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. The 
following sections describe relevant clinical and epidemiological aspects of these infectious diseases, 
focusing on data about young children internationally, and the need for, as well as the impact of 
vaccination programs. 
Diphtheria 
Active immunization in the paediatric population with diphtheria toxoid has markedly altered the 
epidemiology of diphtheria, reducing the disease to extremely low levels in developed countries and 
many developing countries. In developed countries, endemic diphtheria has either disappeared or 
become extremely rare, with only infrequent cases of imported diphtheria being reported. Immunity 
is thought to be lifelong following infection; however, waning of adult immunity to diphtheria has 
been reported. This highlights the need for vaccination programs to continue from birth through 
adulthood. Variations in the case definition used for reporting of diphtheria cases also exist. The case 
fatality rate is 3-23%. Diphtheria is rare in infants younger than 6 months owing to the presence of 
Hexacima

maternal antibody (Ab). The WHO estimates that 4000 of the 5000 annual deaths from diphtheria 
that occurred worldwide in 2002 were among children less than five years of age. However, marked 
disparities remain in reported incidence rates between countries. Some developing countries have 
achieved control of diphtheria comparable to developed countries, some have observed dramatic falls 
of the disease but still have sporadic outbreaks, and a small number continue to have evidence of 
widespread circulation of toxigenic strains. 
Tetanus 
In spite of the availability of a highly effective vaccine, tetanus continues to exert a substantial health 
global burden. Tetanus is now considered rare in most developed countries due to improved hygiene 
and childbirth practices, improved wound care, reduction in exposure to C. tetani spores and 
improved rates of active immunization over many birth cohorts. Worldwide annual deaths from 
tetanus, in 2002, were estimated by WHO at 213,000 out of which 198,000 (86%) occurred among 
children under 5 years of age. 
The overall tetanus case-fatality rate varies from 10% to 70%, depending on treatment, age and 
general health of the patient. Without hospitalization and intensive care, fatality is almost 100% 
among the youngest and the oldest patients. Tetanus affects all age groups and case-fatality rates 
can be high even where modern intensive care is available. Tetanus in infants and children commonly 
reflects poor coverage of the national childhood immunization program. 
Immunization with tetanus vaccines early in- and throughout-life has remarkably reduced the 
number of tetanus infections in industrialized countries. While the worldwide elimination of neonatal 
tetanus by 1995 (one of the targets of the WHO) has not been achieved, the number of countries in 
which neonatal tetanus occurs is progressively decreasing. In the WHO Europe region, Turkey was 
the only country still reporting cases of tetanus. 
Pertussis 
Pertussis is an important cause of infant death internationally and continues to be a public health 
concern even in countries with high vaccination coverage. Recent estimates from the WHO suggest 
that, in 2003, about 17.6 million cases of pertussis occurred worldwide, 90% of which were in 
developing countries, and that about 279,000 individuals died from this disease. It is further 
estimated that, in 2003, global vaccination against pertussis averted about 38.3 million cases and 
607,000 deaths. 
Reported pertussis incidence must be interpreted with caution due to variations in case definitions 
and surveillance system performance among countries. Case definitions based on clinical confirmation 
are used in many countries due to limited access to laboratory services. Pertussis diagnosis in the 
neonate as well as older children and adults is difficult without laboratory confirmation. Even within 
areas such as Europe ,Latin America , or Turkey the reported incidence varies widely from 0.38 in 
Turkey to 144/ 100,000 in Norway in 2006 and from 0 to 115/ 100,000 in 2007, according to 
differences in surveillance systems or awareness of the disease. The global decline in reported 
pertussis incidence in the 1980’s is consistent with the overall increases in immunization coverage 
which emphasize the need to continuous improving vaccination coverage. 
In summary, pertussis, although largely preventable by vaccination, still affects many countries in 
the world, even in countries with high vaccine coverage. The youngest age groups remain the most 
affected by pertussis infection and with higher morbidity. Thus, continual monitoring, careful 
surveillance, high vaccine coverage and appropriate booster administration in the paediatric 
population and adults is needed across the World to reduce incidence and prevent resurgence of this 
disease.

Poliomyelitis 
Since the GPEI was launched in 1988, 3 WHO regions have been certified poliovirus-free: the 
Americas in 1994, the Western Pacific in 2000 and the European region on June 2002. So far, the 
global fight against poliovirus diseases is estimated to have saved 5 million persons from paralysis . 
The total number of cases decreased from an estimated 350,000 in 1988 to less than 2000 cases in 
2009, and the number of poliovirus endemic countries from 125 to 4. Until worldwide eradication of 
poliovirus has been achieved, high levels of vaccine-induced immunity must be maintained in all 
populations. Use of OPV contains a small risk of poliovirus-like disease caused by one of the 3 Sabin 
vaccine-related poliovirus types; with a risk of vaccine associated paralytic polio (VAPP). VAPP is seen 
in 1 case out of 1 million vaccinations. 
Through replication and spread in a susceptible population, the vaccine virus may gradually change 
into a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) and regain virulence with circulating VDPV. Outbreaks 
caused by circulating vaccine-derived virus has been reported from several countries worldwide, with 
e.g., 153 paralytic cases reported from Nigeria in 2009. Most European countries implemented the 
use of only IPV in their vaccination programs to overcome the risk of VDPV . A 4-dose schedule (WHO 
/ [Expanded Program of Immunization] EPI Schedule) of IPV is used in 41 countries and reporting 
entities to provide immunity and avoid the risk for vaccine-associated paralytic polio associated with 
the use of OPV. In addition, 19 countries and reporting entities use a sequential schedule of IPV and 
OPV. 
In 2009, a total of 23 countries reported at least one poliovirus disease case due to wild-type 
poliovirus (WPV). Of these, 4 are considered to be poliovirus-endemic (Afghanistan, India, Nigeria 
and Pakistan) since they have been unable to eliminate indigenous circulation of WPV type-1 and 
WPV type-3. The remaining countries were previously considered poliovirus-free, but have reported 
cases and outbreaks caused by imported WPV type 1 or 3. In spring 2010, a new outbreak in 
Tajikistan has resulted in 452 laboratory-confirmed cases of WPV type 1 and 20 deaths, and at least 
7 related cases have been reported in the Russian federation. With continued efforts to achieve high 
rates of vaccination against polio, eradication from the natural environment is anticipated in the 
years to come. 
Invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b disease 
Hib disease burden is highest among infants aged 4 to 18 months, but invasive Hib disease is 
occasionally observed in infants aged < 3 months and among those aged > 5 years. In unvaccinated 
populations, invasive Hib is the dominant cause of non-epidemic bacterial meningitis during the first 
year of life. Even with prompt and adequate antibiotic treatment, the case fatality rate of patients 
with Hib meningitis is 3 to 20%. Where medical resources are limited, fatality rates for Hib meningitis 
are typically higher, and severe neurological sequelae are frequently observed in survivors (in up to 
30 to 40%). Active immunization first of young children with plain vaccines and later of infants of less 
than 6 months of age with conjugated vaccines has dramatically decreased the incidence of invasive 
diseases by almost 100%. 
Within a few years of the inclusion of Hib vaccine in routine childhood immunization programs in 
more than 90 countries (e.g., including European, North American, Latin American, South Africa, 
Saudi Arabia) invasive Hib disease has been practically eliminated. The reported incidence has been 
decreased between < 1 to 5/100,000 in children less than five year of age. The majority of invasive 
Hib disease occurs in resource limited settings when Hib conjugate vaccine is not in routine use. 
Hepatitis B 
The need of controlling hepatitis B infection has been recognized as a major public health target. In 
the 1980’s, a strategy limiting vaccination to individuals at high risk of infection failed to reduce the 
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013 
Page 9/126 
 
  
incidence of Hep B possibly because most people concerned were inaccessible for vaccination or could 
not be identified as high-risk individuals. In 1992, the WHO assembly endorsed the universal 
immunization of infants against Hep B. As of 2008, 177 countries had included hepatitis B vaccination 
in their national immunization program, including most countries in Eastern and Southeast Asia, the 
Pacific Islands, Australia, North and Latin America, Western Europe, and the Middle East. 
The world can be divided into 3 distinct patterns for Hep B endemicity according to prevalence – high 
(> 8% such as South-east Asia, Africa including South Africa, China, the Artic Rim etc.), medium (2 
to 8% such as Eastern Europe and the Middle East including Turkey, Egypt, Morocco) and low (< 2% 
such as Northern Europe, USA, Australia and Latin America including Colombia, Argentina, Mexico 
and Venezuela). This classification is based upon Hep B chronic carrier rate and prevalence of 
serologic Hep B markers of chronic infection. The highest prevalence for chronic infection has been 
reported in Gambia with 36%. In the highly endemic regions, the majority of Hep B infections occur 
in the perinatal period (> 20% of all infections) and early childhood (> 60% of all infections), placing 
those infected at increased risk for chronic disease and its sequelae. Infants who become infected 
with Hep B at birth have a 70% to 90% chance of becoming chronic Hep B carriers. It is estimated 
that approximately 75% of the world’s 350 million chronic carriers of Hep B live in these hyper 
endemic regions, where HBsAg positivity rates may reach 35%. Worldwide, an estimated 1 million 
deaths annually are attributable to Hep B-associated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. 
In the low endemic areas (with a general population prevalence of < 2%), such as the United States 
and Europe, less than 10% of the total infections are in the perinatal (infants < 1 year of age) and 
early childhood (1 to 4 years of age) populations. In Europe, Hep B carriage rates are generally 2% 
to 7% but vary widely, from < 1% in Scandinavia and the United Kingdom (UK) to 18% in Albania. 
Hepatitis B vaccines are licensed in approximately 75% of all countries and are capable of inducing a 
protective Ab response in approximately 95% of young healthy subjects after a 3-dose regimen.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Hexacima is a sterile, whitish and cloudy suspension of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, acellular 
pertussis components (Pertussis Toxoid and Filamentous Haemagglutinin), inactivated poliomyelitis 
vaccine (Vero cell origin) types 1, 2 and 3 (IPV), Haemophilus influenzae type b capsular 
polysaccharide (polyribosylribitol phosphate, PRP) covalently bound to tetanus protein and Hepatitis B 
surface antigen (produced in yeast Hansenula polymorpha cells by recombinant DNA technology) 
adsorbed on aluminium hydroxide. 
The development of the vaccine is based on a 5-valent vaccine (Pentavac/Pentaxim – DTaP-IPV-Hib) 
that has been used since 1997. Hexacima is based on Pentavac/Pentaxim with the addition of a newly 
formulated Hepatitis B component  
In addition to the new Hepatitis B component, the amount of Hib has been changed in relation to the 
amount used in Pentaxim: 12 μg Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide (polyribosylribitol 
phosphate) instead of 10 µg are conjugated to 22-36 μg tetanus protein (PRP-T). 
2.2.2.  Purified Diphtheria Toxoid (PDT) 
Manufacture 
Purified Diphtheria Toxoid (PDT) is manufactured through the fermentation of C. diphtheriae, the 
toxin being harvested and then detoxified by formaldehyde. The resulting Crude Diphtheria Toxoid 
(CDT) is further purified through a selective precipitation by ammonium sulphate leading to the PDT.  
The production of the PDT drug substance is based on a seed lot system: Pre-Master, Master, 
Intermediate and Working Seed Lots for C. diphtheriae. The Diphtheria antigen production process 
was long ago established and produces a highly immunogenic antigen. 
All materials used during the production of PDT are tested according to either the European 
Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) or internal specifications. Ruminant raw materials used include bovine milk, 
ovine blood, bovine milk, skeleton, muscles and heart and comply with the TSE guidance 
(Ph.Eur.1483 and 5.2.8). 
The CDT intermediate is stored in a stainless steel tank. 
In process controls (IPCs) for the intermediates of the drug substance include tests with specified 
acceptance criteria and tests to monitor the process. All IPCs applied are in compliance with the bulk 
purified toxoid part of Ph. Eur. monograph 0443 “Diphtheria vaccine (adsorbed)”, and with WHO TRS 
No. 800 Annex 2 “Requirements for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and combined vaccines 
(adsorbed)”. 
Process validation is divided based on the main three production steps: Fermentation, Detoxification 
and Purification. Each part of the manufacturing process has been independently validated.  
The PDT drug substance was characterized by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. The results were 
consistent for three consecutive batches. 
As the production of PDT involves the use of culture media containing material of animal origin 
(bovine/ovine) and as required by Ph. Eur. 0153 and recommended by WHO in section A.3.1.3 of TRS 
800, during the initial development of the product, tests for blood-derived substances and bovine 
serum albumin were performed. None of the toxoid batches (development lots) contained detectable 
Hexacima

EMA/373868/2013 
Page 11/126 
 
 
  
levels of either blood substances. All the purified toxoids (development batches) tested were negative 
for bovine albumin antisera. 
Specification 
The tests and specifications for the control of the PDT drug substance are in compliance with the bulk 
purified toxoid part of Ph. Eur. monograph 0443 “Diphtheria vaccine (adsorbed)”, and with WHO TRS 
No. 800 Annex 2 “Requirements for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and combined vaccines 
(adsorbed)”.  
Stability 
The results of stability studies for three production batches support the claimed shelf-life when stored 
in polypropylene flasks. 
Conclusion 
In summary, the manufacturing process of PDT is well established and controlled by different IPCs, 
release and shelf life specifications. 
2.2.3.  Purified Tetanus Toxoid (PTT) 
Manufacture 
The manufacturing of Purified Tetanus Toxoid (PTT) is performed at the Sanofi Pasteur S.A. testing 
site in Marcy L'Etoile, France.  
PTT is a detoxified protein obtained from Clostridium tetani Harvard 49205 strain.  
Tetanus Toxoid is manufactured through the fermentation of C. tetani, the toxin being harvested and 
then detoxified by formaldehyde. The resulting Crude Tetanus Toxoid (CTT) is further purified 
through a selective precipitation by ammonium sulphate leading to the PTT.  
In-process controls during the production process are well defined in the process schemes and are in 
accordance with the recommendations of the Ph. Eur. monograph 0452, and with the “Manual for the 
production and control of vaccines: tetanus toxoid” (WHO document BLG/UNDP/77.2 Rev 1) named 
in the WHO TRS 800 Appendix 2. 
The materials used during the production of the PTT are tested according to either Ph. Eur. or internal 
specifications. Regarding raw material of animal origin, information on the species and tissue, country 
of origin and stage in the manufacturing process where each of the raw materials is used, was 
provided. Materials of biological origin include bovine liver, lung and heart, bovine milk and poultry 
feathers. Where applicable, certificates were provided. Impurities like blood-derived substances or 
bovine albumin, appearing from material of animal origin (bovine/ovine), could not be detected in the 
PTT. 
Specification 
The specifications for the PTT drug substance are in compliance with the Ph. Eur. monograph 0452 
and with WHO TRS 800. Batch Analyses performed on 3 clinical batches as well as on 3 current 
production batches met acceptance criteria and showed consistency and uniformity.

Stability 
Stability data provided on the intermediate Crude Tetanus Toxoid justifies the claimed shelf-life when 
stored in stainless steel tanks. 
Stability data provided on the PTT supported the claimed shelf-life. 
The PTT is distributed for storage in polypropylene flask. 
Conclusion 
Overall, the PTT manufacturing process is well defined and controlled by in-process controls. In 
addition, the PTT is monitored by release and shelf-life specifications which are in compliance with 
Ph. Eur. monograph 0452 and WHO TRS 800. 
2.2.4.  Acellular Pertussis (adsorbed PTxd and adsorbed FHA) 
Manufacture 
The drug substance is composed of two antigenic proteins, the Adsorbed Purified Pertussis Toxoid 
(PTxd) and the Adsorbed Purified Filamentous Haemagglutinin (FHA). These proteins are obtained 
from Bordetella pertussis.  
Both pertussis antigens (native purified FHA and native purified Pertussis Toxin) are obtained from 
the same fermentation process and are separately processed by adsorption chromatography and 
affinity chromatography. Native purified Pertussis toxin is then detoxified. Purified FHA, which is 
routinely proved to be completely devoid of toxic activities, is used in its native form. Both antigens 
(purified Pertussis Toxoid in solution and purified FHA in solution) are then adsorbed separately onto 
aluminium hydroxide. 
Several intermediates are involved in the manufacture of the two-component acellular pertussis drug 
substance (adsorbed purified Pertussis Toxoid (PTxd) and adsorbed purified FHA). These are native 
purified FHA, purified FHA in solution, native purified Pertussis Toxin, and purified Pertussis Toxoid in 
solution. All intermediates are tested with compendial methods or adequately established in house 
methods. Batch analysis and stability data show that the manufacturing process provides the 
intermediates in a reproducible manner and allows storage in glass containers.  
The materials used in production of the acellular drug substance are in compliance with Ph. Eur. and 
WHO requirements. For materials of animal origin that are covered by the Note for Guidance on 
minimising the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents, Certificates of 
Suitability (CoS) were provided. 
Specification 
The tests and specifications for the control of the acellular Pertussis drug substance (adsorbed 
Pertussis toxoid and adsorbed FHA) are in compliance with monograph Ph. Eur. 1934 on acellular 
component Pertussis and WHO TRS 878, Annex 2. Batch analyses show that all acceptance criteria 
were met.

Stability 
Stability studies results for the adsorbed Pertussis toxoid and adsorbed FHA support the claimed 
storage time in glass containers. 
Conclusion 
In conclusion, the manufacturing process of the adsorbed Pertussis toxoid and the adsorbed FHA 
antigens is well established and controlled in order to provide consistent acellular Pertussis drug 
substances. 
2.2.5.  PRP-T Drug Substance 
The amount of Hib has been changed in relation to the amount used in Pentaxim, which has been 
used since 1997. Now, 12 μg PRP instead of 10 µg are conjugated to 22-36 μg tetanus protein (PRP-
T). 
Manufacture 
The Haemophilus polysaccharide conjugate drug substance (PRP-T) is a polysaccharide prepared from 
Haemophilus influenzae type b, covalently bound after chemical activation to a carrier (tetanus) 
protein. These two components are produced, extracted and purified separately using their own seed 
lot systems and manufacturing processes. 
PRP-T production is divided into three main production steps: (1) production of the Haemophilus 
type b polysaccharide, (2) production of the tetanus protein and (3) conjugation of the Haemophilus 
type b polysaccharide with the concentrated tetanus protein. 
The polysaccharide is precipitated from a culture of H. influenzae type b, purified and subsequently 
activated (PRP-AH) through chemical linkage/activation. 
The tetanus protein is prepared by fermentation of C. tetani (Harvard strain 49205) and lysis, 
purification and inactivation of the toxin. 
The activated polysaccharide is subsequently covalently bound to the tetanus protein. The conjugate 
product is purified and diluted resulting in the PRP-T drug substance. 
For storage, the Haemophilus polysaccharide conjugate concentrated bulk is filled in polypropylene 
flasks. 
The production of the PRP-T drug substance is based on two seed lot systems: (1) Pre-Master, Master 
and Working Seed Lots for H. influenzae type b; and (2) Master and Working Seed Lots for C. tetani; 
control of both seed lot systems is acceptable. 
The materials used during the production of PRP-T are tested according to either Ph. Eur. or internal 
specifications (tests and acceptance criteria). Ruminant raw materials used include bovine milk, 
bovine heart, porcine skin and pancreas, horse blood, poultry feathers and comply with the TSE 
guidance. The manufacturing process of the purified Haemophilus type b polysaccharide (PRP) 
includes an optional reprocessing step, which is performed only once depending on upcoming high 
endotoxin and pyrogen levels.  
The manufacturing stages for PRP-T are driven by production parameters and in-process controls. 
IPCs for the intermediates of the drug substance include tests with specified acceptance criteria and 
tests to monitor the process. All IPCs applied during manufacture of PRP-T are considered acceptable. 
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013

In contrast to WHO TRS 897, purity testing hasn’t been performed at the purified polysaccharide 
stage. Purity and gram staining however is tested as in process control at pre-culture and industrial 
culture stages. 
The results of the validation programs and of the stability studies provide consistency data and show 
that the process is under control. The specifications of intermediates comply with Ph. Eur. and WHO 
technical report series. The storage times of intermediates has been demonstrated with stability data. 
The process validation is divided based on the main production steps (PRP-AH, CTP, PRP-T). Each 
part of the manufacturing process has been independently validated. At least three consecutive 
industrial batches have been involved considering production parameters, in-process controls, Quality 
Control tests and additional characterization testing (where appropriate). All data recorded met the 
operating requirements and results of Quality Control testing met the acceptance criteria. The results 
presented for the process validation of the PRP-T drug substance are satisfactory. 
Several modifications have been introduced to the production of the Conjugated Haemophilus b 
Polysaccharide Bulk: 1) scale-up of the C. tetani industrial fermentation batch size, 2) Renewal of the 
Seed Lot and 3) Change in the composition of medium. All the assessments made at the different 
stages confirmed the equivalency of the processes. The results obtained for the production 
parameters, IPCs and additional tests comply with their acceptance criteria. 
Specification 
Tests and specifications performed as a part of the routine testing on the Drug Substance are in 
compliance with Ph. Eur. or WHO technical report series; or a full process validation study has been 
provided with adequate results. The test on free tetanus content is based on Ph. Eur.2.2 "Physical 
and Physicochemical methods", 2.2.31 "Electrophoresis" and monograph 1219. The percentage of the 
free tetanus protein content relative to the total tetanus protein content is calculated by comparing 
the intensity of the free tetanus protein band of the sample (after gel staining) to the intensity of the 
band of the calibration range. In general, the results from the batch analysis of the PRP-T Drug 
Substance demonstrate consistency and are within the pre-set limits.  
According to WHO TRS 897, the absence of specific toxicity of the carrier protein should be tested at 
the bulk conjugate stage or assessed through validation of the production process. For Hexacima, the 
detoxification is controlled by monitoring production parameter and validation data. The absence of 
toxin (specific toxicity) and irreversibility of toxoid is tested at the CTP stage in guinea pigs and is in 
line with Ph. Eur. 452 & WHO TRS 800. 
Stability 
The results of the studies described support the claimed shelf-life for PRP-T when stored in 
polypropylene flasks. 
Conclusion 
The PRP-T manufacturing process is well controlled by IPCs, release and shelf-life specifications.

2.2.6.  IPV Drug Substance 
Manufacture 
The IPV trivalent drug substance comprises the three serotypes 1, 2 and 3 and each monovalent is 
manufactured separately on Vero cell substrate. Following expansion of the Vero cells in bioreactors 
using microcarriers, the cells are infected by the respective serotype. The virus harvests are clarified, 
concentrated and purified by chromatography and subsequently inactivated by formaldehyde. The 
inactivation is conducted in two stages and it is confirmed through control testing according to 
international requirements. Monovalent lots of each serotype are then blended in specific proportions 
to formulate the concentrated trivalent batch. In general the manufacturing process of the IPV 
trivalent drug substance is well established and sufficiently characterized and validated to ensure 
consistent production. In addition it was shown that process related impurities are effectively and 
consistently removed by the manufacturing process.  
The starting material is defined by internal specifications and for all raw materials of ruminant origin 
certificates of suitability issued by EDQM are available. The history, generation and control of the 
Vero cell banks and poliovirus seed lots were well documented and comply with Ph. Eur. and WHO 
requirements. As preventive measure material of biological origin (i.e. BCS/FBS and trypsin) is tested 
for adventitious agents and is gamma-irradiated. The test program covers circoviruses. 
Specification 
The control of the drug substance and the quality control tests applied are appropriate to confirm 
product of consistent quality. The quality tests are acceptably validated and well defined reference 
preparations are used. The quality test program complies with international and European 
requirements (Ph. Eur. 214). 
Stability 
The storage period of the IPV trivalent drug substance in glass bottles or stainless steel tanks is 
justified by stability data. 
2.2.7.  HBsAg Drug Substance 
Manufacture 
The HBsAg drug substance manufacture is based strain K3/8-1 of Hansenula polymorpha, which was 
derived by recombinant DNA technology. K3/8-1 has inserted the gene encoding HBsAg, which was 
isolated from a chronically infected patient in multimeric form in its genome.   
The production of the HBsAg by the recombinant strain K3/8-1 consists of several steps including 
fermentation of the cells to high cell density and induction of gene expression, harvest of the cells 
and cell disruption to release the antigen followed by purification using mainly chromatography and 
maturation of particles.  
Information on starting material including raw material of animal origin is available. The source, 
history and generation of the Hansenula polymorpha strain, of the gene encoding the HBsAg and of 
the expression vector are well described. Following several passages in selection and stabilization 
media clone K3/8-1 was isolated that has integrated the gene encoding the HBsAg in multimeric form 
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013 
Page 16/126 
 
 
 
 
  
into the host genome and expressed HBsAg in high amounts. Clone K3/8-1 was employed to 
establish a pre-master seed lot and subsequently the Master and Working seed lots. The seed lots are 
well characterized and controlled at release and during storage. The MSL and WSLs comply with WHO 
and Ph. Eur. requirements. 
Data on process validation are available on three processes established during process development. 
The data generally confirm that the process is capable to yield consistent product which is 
comparable between the first, second and third generation production batches used in clinical 
studies. Moreover characterization studies and validation studies confirmed that process related 
impurities such as host cell DNA and protein are effectively and reproducibly reduced by the 
purification steps to acceptable levels. Drug substance batches derived from the different 
manufacturing processes were extensively characterized using biochemical, immunochemical and 
biophysical methods. It was demonstrated that HBsAg derived from first, second and third production 
processes had similar properties as regards composition, modification, size and structure. 
Specification 
The control of the drug substance complies with WHO TRS 786 and Ph. Eur. monograph 1056. 
The analytical procedures to determine the HBsAg content, purity as well as protein, carbohydrate 
and lipids content were validated.  
The reference material used was sufficiently characterized. Acceptance criteria for the individual 
characterization parameters of HBsAg were defined during characterization studies. Upon request a 
minimum number of tests were defined for calibration of any new reference material. 
Stability 
The stability data justify the proposed storage time the HBsAg bulk drug substance. 
2.2.8.  Finished Medicinal Product

Pharmaceutical Development 
PDT, PTT, PTxd and FHA, IPV and PRP-T are currently licensed in well-established combination 
vaccines (e.g. Tetravac (DTaP-IPV) and Pentavac (DTaP-IPV/PRP-T)).  
The antigen concentrations of these active ingredients per human dose of Hexacima are similar to 
those usually used in commercial Sanofi Pasteur paediatric vaccines. The concentration of PDT, PTT, 
PTxd FHA and IPV are the same as those in Tetravac and Pentavac. The PRP-T concentration was 
defined according to the formulation of the non-adjuvanted Act-Hib vaccine, for which a 
concentration of 10μg/dose was confirmed to ensure efficient protection. The PRP-T concentration in 
the Hexacima formulation was set at 12μg/dose to compensate the possible amount of PRP-T 
adsorbed onto aluminium hydroxide, which is expected to be less immunogenic than the non-
adsorbed one, and to guarantee similarly at least 8 μg/dose of non-adsorbed PRP-T. Data obtained in 
phase I studies suggested that PRP-T adsorbed to aluminium hydroxide was less immunogenic than 
non-adsorbed PRP-T or plain PRP in healthy adult. Adsorption of conjugate PRP-T onto aluminium 
hydroxide led to a decrease of antibody responses to PRP. Both the internal data and the findings in 
the published literature therefore justify the rationale to avoid adsorption of PRP-T in the formulation. 
The only new antigen in Hexacima is Hepatitis B surface antigen produced by the recombinant yeast 
Hansenula polymorpha. The HBsAg concentration was based on previous internal and external 
experiences: safe and immunogenic hepatitis B vaccines are commercially available since several 
decades. Hepatitis B antigen-containing vaccines have been formulated to contain 3 μg to 40 μg of 
HBsAg protein per millilitre (ml). For the infant/toddler targeted vaccines, hepatitis B content range 
from 1.5μg/dose to 10μg/dose. Dose response studies and randomized comparative trials between 
two yeast-derived recombinant HBsAg vaccines have shown repeatedly that a dose of 10 μg of 
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013 
Page 18/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
recombinant HBsAg is the optimal antigen content to use for the infant/toddler immunization. For all 
hepatitis B antigen-containing combination vaccines evaluated in humans, the HBsAg, when used at 
the same content as with hepatitis B stand-alone vaccines, remains sufficiently immunogenic to elicit 
protective levels of anti-HBs. In addition, the two phase III clinical studies performed using the 
Sanofi Pasteur hepatitis B antigen, demonstrated its good immunogenicity performance in 
adolescents with a content of 10μg/dose. This HBsAg concentration of 10μg/dose has therefore been 
chosen in animals and in humans. 
The appearance of the vaccine is a whitish and cloudy suspension with a pH value within 6.8-7.5 and 
an osmolality value between 300mOsmol/kg and 400mOsmol/kg. The physico-chemical and biological 
properties of the medicinal product are determined by the release tests. 
To develop an immunogenic and stable hexavalent vaccine, an initial formulation of Hexacima was 
defined. The formulation process and composition were then improved from the initial formulation to 
the optimized formulation.  
In parallel, the manufacturing process has also evolved with respect to internalization of the site of 
production of the FBP and FP and a manufacturing up-scale from 50L to industrial scale of 250L. The 
FBP and FP manufacturing process improvements or changes from the initial formulation to the 
optimized formulation at industrial scale were described and justified in detail.  
Hexacima vaccine is presented in single-dose glass vials or syringes (type I, Ph.-Eur) without needle 
or with one or two separate needles. 
Glass container (vials and syringes) is of type I grade. During product development the initial 
elastomeric closures were changed to a more inert plunger stopper/stopper. Several compatibility 
studies (physicochemical and biological tests, extractable studies and available stability studies) 
demonstrate the compatibility between Hexacima vaccine and the chosen new container closure 
system. 
Adventitious agents 
All raw materials of ruminant origin used for the manufacture of DTacP-IPV-HepB-PRP-T vaccine 
comply with Ph. Eur. monographs 1483 and 5.2.8. 
Certificates of suitability issued by EDQM were provided for all raw materials of ruminant-origin, or 
raw materials that contain materials manufactured from ruminant-origin. 
All culture media containing raw materials of animal origin used in the manufacture of D, T, P, Hib, 
HepB and IPV drug substances and which are considered to be the main potential source of viral 
contaminations are heat steam sterilized or heat treated. These culture media can be considered free 
of adventitious agents. 
In the IPV process, calf serum, cholesterol and trypsin are used, that are the main potential source of 
viral contamination. These raw materials of animal origin are tested by the manufacturer and are 
specifically treated to ensure the virus safety.  In addition the manufacture of the trivalent 
concentrated bulk includes an inactivation step.

Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process for the Hexacima Drug Product consists in three principal steps: 
• 
• 
• 
Manufacture of the Final Bulk Product; 
Filling of the Final Bulk Product; 
Secondary packaging of the Filled Product. 
Critical steps during the manufacture of the Final Bulk Product and the filling of the Final Bulk Product 
(FBP) are monitored by process parameters applied to ensure that all quality attributes of 
manufactured vaccine met the acceptance criteria. 
FBP is formulated by sequential addition of the individual drug substances and excipients in a specific 
order to achieve a homogeneous and consistent formulation prior to filling (into vial or syringe). 
Sterility is tested at release and is ensured by means of validated aseptic process for the introduction 
of the aluminium gel and the FHA/PTxd during the formulation and by means of validated sterilizing 
filtrations for the other components. 
Hexacima vaccine can be filled in syringes without attached needle or in vials. The filling equipment is 
appropriately prepared before steam sterilization using sterilization cycle parameters set to ensure 
final sterility. The FBP is kept at +5°C ± 3°C in a stainless steel tank where it is stirred continuously 
during the filling step. The tank is connected to the filling machine that is supplied with the sterilized 
primary packaging components (syringes, plunger stoppers and tip caps or vials, stoppers and flip off 
caps). The filling process is described in detail and in-process controls for filling volume and 
homogeneity are applied. The filled product (FP) is inspected for container closure integrity.  
Shipment is performed at controlled temperature and is subjected to adequate monitoring (check of 
sealing, temperature recording).  
Validation data of critical manufacturing steps of Hexacima vaccine drug product demonstrate that 
the Final Bulk Product batches (MLE site) and the Final Product batches (MLE, VDR and Anagni sites) 
are consistently manufactured with the required quality attributes whatever the manufacturing sites. 
Pharmacopoeial grade excipients used in the manufacture of Hexacima vaccine are tested according 
to Ph. Eur. 
Non Pharmacopoeial grade excipients are adequately controlled. Each essential amino acid is 
separately compliant with their respective Ph. Eur. Monograph. 
No excipients from human or animal origin and no new excipients are used for the formulation of 
Hexacima vaccine. 
Product specification 
The control of the drug product complies with European requirements.

Most Analytical Procedures for FBP and FP testing are compendial methods and are in line with Ph. 
Eur. requirements. Since all in vivo assays are compendial methods, they were not specifically 
validated for Hexacima release testing for ethical reasons. Compendial tests for osmolality and 
bacterial fungal sterility (FBP) as well as pH and bacterial fungal sterility have been validated.

Relative Potency (IVRP) and D-antigen content (for FBP stage) as well as Aluminium content and 
Identity tests (for FP stage) were validated according to ICH Q2 (R1).  
Initial formulation batch analysis data for 4 FBP lots and 7 FP lots  were presented. For the optimised 
formulation batch analysis data for 6 FBP and 6 FP lots (vials and syringes) are available. The results 
presented demonstrate that all batches from the initial and optimized formulation comply with the 
defined specifications and therefore fully support manufacturing consistency. 
The justifications of the release profile for FBP and FP commercial batches and its associated 
specifications are based on international requirements (Ph. Eur. monograph 2067, Ph. Eur. 
monograph 0153 and TRS 927), statistical analysis of batch results and the company’s experience 
with licensed vaccines such as Tetravac (DTacP-IPV), Pediacel (DTaP-IPV-PRP-T) and Act-Hib. All 
results obtained with the optimized formulation batches meet these acceptance criteria.  
Diphtheria potency limits set for Hexacima Activity ≥ 30 IU/dose, Lower fiducial limit (P = 0.95) of the 
estimated potency ≥ 20 IU/dose meet the WHO requirements. Compliance according to Ph. Eur. is 
given as the LCL of ≥ 20 IU/dose has been justified by relevant data on clinical lots. 
Stability of the product 
Stability studies were conducted to support the comparability of the initial and the optimized 
formulation.  
In general, the results of the five stability studies support the shelf-life of the FBP and the FP and the 
storage conditions as defined in the SPC.  
The studies were conducted using FBP manufactured at Marcy l’Etoile (MLE) and Drug Product filled in 
single-dose syringes without needle at MLE and in single-dose vials at Val de Reuil (VDR) and Anagni. 
The design and test program of the stability studies was in general satisfactory and the FBP and FP 
met the relevant requirements supporting the proposed shelf-life of the vaccine of 36 months when 
stored at +5°C ± 3°C. 
2.2.9.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
No major objections were raised during the assessment of the quality part of the dossier.  
The Applicant has responded satisfactorily to all of the other quality concerns and questions identified 
during the course of procedure. 
IPV Drug Substance 
Due to recent findings of PCV-1 and 2 contaminations in vaccines produced from Vero cells, a risk 
assessment as regards adventitious agents possibly introduced by starting materials but not detected 
by classical adventitious agents testing and the confirmation of absence of circovirus contamination in 
Vero cell banks, seed viruses and the IPV drug substance, were requested. The Applicant confirmed 
that the test program for the trypsin raw material covers circoviruses. Data demonstrating the 
absence of PCV-1 and 2 contaminants in working cell banks and seed lots were provided and specific 
tests were implemented as release tests.  
HBsAg Drug Substance 
The purity assay is performed as in-process test and as release test for the HBsAg bulk component. 
Additional validation data on linearity and accuracy provided by the Applicant confirmed that the 
assay is accurate and linear in a 90-100% range.  
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013 
Page 23/126 
 
 
 
  
The lipids content test is performed as a release test for the HBsAg bulk component. The amount of 
lipids may be important for the immunogenicity of the vaccine and the HBsAg lots used in the clinical 
studies should be representative for the proposed lipid content acceptance criteria. This point was 
clarified by the Applicant and the proposed specification limits for the lipid content were shown to be 
clinically validated.  
Drug Product 
The chosen acceptance criteria for percent adsorption of Diphtheria Toxoid (at FBP), percent 
adsorption-Tetanus Toxoid and the test for Non-Adsorbed PTxd and Non-Adsorbed FHA by ELISA 
were clarified by the Applicant. No upper specification limit is intended to be introduced for percent 
adsorption of Diphtheria Toxoid in the FBP. Likewise, no specification limit is intended to be 
introduced for percent adsorption of Tetanus Toxoid in the FBP. The test for non-adsorbed PTxD and 
non-adsorbed FHA by ELISA are considered as a characterization test to be performed on the filled 
product in case of a process change that may impact the adsorption. 
Additional information was provided to justify the chosen stability limits. The end of shelf-life 
specification for depolymerised PRP was further justified and shown to be clinically validated. 
In conclusion, information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substances and drug 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate 
satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn 
lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the 
clinic. 
2.2.10.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The manufacturing process of Hexacima is considered to be well controlled. In-process controls, 
release and shelf life specifications indicate the high quality of the drug substances and the drug 
product. 
The Quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.11.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
•  DS – DT. The CHMP recommends replacement of the currently approved pre-ranges by 
definitive operating ranges for the fermentation and detoxification process of Diphtheria 
purified toxoid, when data on 30 batches are available. 
•  DS – Acellular pertussis. The CHMP recommends the applicant to submit the updated 
Certificate of Suitability (COS) R1-CEP-2000-155-Rev 04 for foetal bovine serum  
•  DS – HBsAg. The CHMP recommends the applicant to assess the HCP content on a large 
number of batches (minimum of 30 batches) by ELISA. If relevant, specification for the drug 
substance should be updated. 
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013

•  DS – PRP-T. The CHMP recommends the applicant to change the container and closure 
system. A new flask made of High Density Polyethylene, with a polypropylene stopper, 
conforming to the Ph. Eur. tests 
•  DS – PRP-T. The CHMP recommends the applicant to revise the specification limit for residual 
cyanide once 100 PRP-AH batches are produced. 
•  DS – IPV. The CHMP recommends the applicant to measure the actual polysorbate 80 
concentration in a minimum of 20 batches of final vaccine and provide the results to the 
Agency. 
• 
The company is recommended to submit 36 months stability data on final lots derived from 
final bulk product showing amounts of depolymerized PRP close to  20%  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Non-clinical pharmacological and toxicology studies were undertaken on Hexacima based on  
• 
• 
the CPMP Note for Guidance on preclinical pharmacological and toxicological testing of 
vaccines (CPMP/SWP/465/95), 
the Note for Guidance on Reproductive Toxicology: Detection of Toxicity to Reproduction for 
Medicinal Products (CPMP/ICH/386/95). 
Based on these guidelines secondary pharmacodynamic, pharmacodynamic drug interaction, 
pharmacokinetics, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies were not considered necessary to be 
performed on Hexacima. 
To address the non-clinical pharmacology of Hexacima, the immunogenicity evaluation of each active 
substance was assessed in release tests or characterization tests, in suitable animal models following 
the Ph. Eur. requirements. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Release tests or characterization tests with final bulk products 
For each Drug Substance, their potency/immunogenicity was assessed at the Final Bulk Product (FBP) 
stage through in vivo studies as release tests or as characterization tests. Overall, four FBP batches 
of the optimised formulation of Hexacima were tested, which were considered representative of the 
vaccine to be marketed. The results were all conform for the batches and are summarised below. For 
details about the tests, please refer to the section on Quality aspects discussed above. 
Diphtheria Potency in Guinea Pigs 
The criterion for acceptance based on statistical evaluation of the immune response is that the 
activity must be not less than 30 IU per 0.5 ml single human dose and that the lower confidence limit 
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013 
Page 25/126 
 
 
 
 
  
(p = 0.95) must be not less than 20 IU Diphtheria Toxoid per dose, when compared to the Diphtheria 
reference standard. 
The results for diphtheria potency assay in guinea pigs of 42 (34-52) IU, 57 (43-82) IU, 
76 (57-113) IU and 41 (28-58) IU were determined, respectively, for the four FBP batches tested. 
Tetanus Potency in Mice 
The criterion for acceptance based on statistical evaluation of the immune response is that the lower 
confidence limit (p = 0.95) must be not less than 40 IU Tetanus Toxin per dose, when compared to 
the Tetanus reference standard. 
The results for tetanus potency assay in mice of 556 (280-853) IU, 584 (413-795) IU and 705 (485-
1017) IU were determined respectively for three FBP batches. The tetanus potency of an additional 
batch was analysed with the former lethality method which was replaced by the Ph. Eur. and gives 
comparable results i.e. 893 (584-1243). 
Pertussis Immunogenicity in Mice 
The criterion of acceptance is that the anti-PTxd and anti-FHA antibody titres induced by the test 
vaccine are not significantly different (p = 0.95) than that of the reference vaccine. 
The results for Pertussis Toxoid (PTxd) and Filamentous Haemagglutinin (FHA) assays in mice were 
all conform for the four batches tested. 
Activity of Pertussis Vaccine on Bacterial Challenge 
Protective effect of Hexacima was consistently shown for all three batches in this challenge model, 
with bacterial CFU counts in the lungs lower in Hexacima-vaccinated mice than in the non-immunized 
mice. 
Poliomyelitis Immunogenicity in Rat 
The potency was calculated by comparing the numbers of responders for the test vaccine to the 
number of responders for the reference vaccine (Pediacel).The IPV potency in protecting units/dose 
of the four batches was not considered to be significantly less than the reference vaccine. 
Haemophilus Immunogenicity in Mice 
The criterion of acceptance is that not less than half the vaccinated mice show a titer not less than 
four time that of the pooled control serum. To be conformed, the batches must induce a humoral 
response in more than half of the mice. 
The mice immunized with the different batches were all responders. The batches met the criterion of 
acceptance and were considered conform.

Hepatitis B Potency in Mice 
The ED50 (efficient dose in µg that enables a 50% seroconversion at D42 after immunization) 
relative to the reference vaccine was determined. The criterion of acceptance is that the upper 
confidence limit (p=0.95) was not less than 1.0. 
All four batches of Hexacima met this criterion. 
Assessment of antigenic interference in mice  
Study Objective and Design: 
To investigate the possible antigenic competition between HBsAg and PRP-T by following the 
magnitude of humoral response elicited against each of these two antigens. 
Rationale: HBsAg and PRP-T were selected because 1) within the Hexacima formulation HBsAg was 
considered the only new antigen produced from a novel source (Hansenula polymorpha yeast), and 
2) both antigens were identified as the most susceptible to antigenic interference based on literature 
review. 
In parallel, to assess: 
•  the effect of the aluminium hydroxide on the HBsAg and PRP-T immune responses 
•  the polarization and persistence of immune responses induced by both antigens 
Group Definition and Treatment: 
One hundred NMRI mice (7 weeks, female) were distributed in 10 groups of 10 mice. Each group 
received either HBsAg and/or PRP-T, alone or mixed with D, T, aP, IPV antigens, with or without 
AlOOH as adjuvant (Table below). An additional group of 10 randomized naive mice of the same 
delivery was used to collect blood samples for the establishment of a baseline for all ELISA titrations.

Table 4: 
These different products under test contained the same amount of active ingredients as in the 
hexavalent vaccine. Their formulations were also identical to that of the hexavalent vaccine, except 
for AlOOH content in groups 8, 9 and 10, as indicated above. 
Immunization was implemented by injection three times at 3-week intervals by intramuscular route. 
The kinetics of anti-HBsAg and anti-PRP-T specific IgG antibody responses were monitored over a 16 
week period of time. These immune responses were compared in the presence or absence of 
aluminium hydroxide adjuvant, and in combination or not with the other vaccine antigens (D, T, aP, 
IPV). 
Results: 
Humoral immune response to HBsAg – effects of AlOOH and PRP-T and other Antigens 
AlOOH increased significantly the anti-HBsAg IgG antibodies (especially IgG1 levels). Mixing HBsAg 
with PRP-T and D, T, aP, IPV increased the specific IgM and IgG responses to HBsAg as well, although 
PRP-T alone failed to do so . This adjuvant-like positive effect of the antigens was not observed 
anymore if AlOOH was present, but no negative interferences could be noticed either. In a vaccine 
formulation containing AlOOH, the addition of PRP-T and/or D, T, aP, IPV antigens resulted in 
stronger IgG2a immune responses specific for the Hepatitis B antigen. 
Th1 / Th2 Polarization of the anti-HBsAg Responses 
The addition of AlOOH significantly increased the levels of anti-HBsAg IgG1 (but not of IgG2), 
resulting in a more Th2 biased response. In the complete mixture, the Th2 polarizing effect of AlOOH 
was partially balanced by the addition of the PRP-T antigen, which by itself, increased more 
specifically the anti-HBsAg IgG2a levels (Th1-like polarizing effect). Therefore, the overall IgG1 / 
IgG2a ratio was not significantly modified, but the titres of both anti-HBsAg IgG1 and IgG2a were 
significantly increased (0.5 log) by AlOOH and by PRP-T in the final combination vaccine. Overall, an  
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013 
Page 28/126 
 
 
 
 
  
“adjuvant-like” effect of PRP-T on the HBsAg specific IgG2a titres could be observed, when PRP-T was 
added to HBsAg alone or mixed with the other hexavalent antigens. 
HBsAg Antibody Persistence over Time 
Anti-HBsAg IgG (including IgG1 and IgG2a) reached a peak on week 8, and then only, very slowly 
decreased during the following weeks, whereas a more rapid decline of anti-HBsAg IgM titres is 
observed. The anti-HBsAg IgG titres observed at week 16 always remained high and superior to 4 log 
except for group 1 (HBsAg without AlOOH), suggesting the induction of an anti-HBsAg memory 
response in all groups including the one of the hexavalent vaccine. 
Humoral immune response to PRP-T – effects of AlOOH and HBsAg and other Antigens 
The presence of the AlOOH did not seem to modify anti-PRP-T IgG titres when it was injected alone, 
but tended to increase the anti-PRP-T response in the presence of HBsAg and the other antigens. In 
particular, anti-PRP-T IgG titres elicited by the hexavalent vaccine increased more rapidly and 
reached higher levels than those induced by the PRP-T administered alone. In addition, the 
hexavalent formulation emerges as the best over time. A similar trend for an increase in anti-PRP-T 
titres when other antigens were added to the vaccines was also observed for IgG1. 
Th1 / Th2 Polarization of the anti-PRP-T Responses 
PRP-T injected alone without AlOOH induced a slightly Th2 biased response (measured via IgG1 / 
IgG2a ratio). The addition of AlOOH moderately increased the anti-PRP-T IgG1 titres, but more 
markedly when PRP-T was mixed with HBsAg and other antigens. In absence of AlOOH, this increase 
in IgG1 due to addition of HBsAg and/or of the other antigens was less efficient. Therefore, addition 
of HBsAg and or of the D, T, aP, IPV, PRP-T combination increased anti-PRP-T IgG1 and Th2 
polarization in presence of AlOOH. 
PRP-T Antibody Persistence over Time 
Anti-PRP-T IgG antibodies decreased less rapidly and were more stable when the PRP-T was injected 
in the presence of AlOOH and with HBsAg and all other antigens. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies were conducted as no specific risks were identified with the 
candidate vaccine in line with the EMA "Note for guidance on preclinical pharmacological and 
toxicology testing of vaccines" (CPMP/SWP/465/95)). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No dedicated safety pharmacology study was performed with Hexacima as no cardiotoxic, respiratory 
or neurotoxic specific risks were identified in line with the EMA "Note for guidance on preclinical 
pharmacological and toxicological testing of vaccines" (CPMP/SWP/465/95).

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacokinetic studies were performed, which is in accordance with Regulatory Guidelines 
quoted above. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No pharmacokinetic studies were performed, which is in accordance with Regulatory Guidelines 
quoted above. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The nonclinical safety of Hexacima was evaluated in three rabbit studies: two repeat-dose toxicity 
studies, which included systemic toxicity evaluation and a local tolerance assessment, which 
evaluated both the initial and optimized vaccine formulations. This investigative local tolerance study 
(with limited assessment of systemic toxicity) was conducted to follow up on some local lesions 
observed in batch release tests in guinea pigs. 
Single dose toxicity 
A single dose toxicity study was not considered necessary as the vaccine is intended to be used with 
repeated administrations. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeated-dose Intramuscular Study in New Zealand White Rabbits 
The study was designed to determine the toxicity of Hexacima (final bulk product), when 
administered 5 times at 2-week intervals by intramuscular route to male and female New Zealand 
White Rabbits, and to evaluate the recovery of potential effects after a two-week treatment-free 
period. 
New Zealand White rabbits (8 animals/sex/group, approximately 12 weeks old) randomly assigned to 
study groups received a 0.5 ml intramuscular injection of 0.9% saline (Group 1) or Hexacima 
(equivalent to one human dose; Group 2) on Study Day (SD) 1, 15, 29, 43, and 57.  Injections 
rotated between sites in the right and left thighs (dose sites 1 and 2,respectively). Four 
animals/sex/group were sacrificed each on SD 58 and 71. Parameters evaluated included mortality, 
clinical and cage side observations (≥ 2 daily), dermal Draize observations (immediately following 
each dose, daily for the three days after each dose (daily observations continued for each injection 
site noted with findings), and weekly in between), body weights (study Day 1, weekly thereafter, and 
at termination (fasted)), food consumption (daily, unless interrupted for study related events), 
ophthalmologic examinations (Prior to first dose, SD 3, and within 5 days of sacrifice), clinical 
pathology (SD3, 58, and 71), immunogenicity (anti-Diphtheria antigen only, SD58), organ weights, 
gross pathology, and histopathology (SD58, SD71).

Results: 
Under these study conditions, repeated intramuscular injections of Hexacima in New Zealand White 
Rabbits did not result in toxicologically relevant changes in mortality, clinical observations, body 
weights, body weight gains, food consumption, or organ weights. 
Treatment did result in a slightly increased level of Draize observations following the last injection, 
variations in some clinical pathology parameters probably linked to the inflammatory and immune 
reactions induced by a vaccine which are generally reversible, and gross pathology findings at the 
injection sites associated with histopathology findings of inflammation were still observed at the end 
of the treatment-free period. No sign of recovery of local injection site reactions was observed at the 
end of 14-day recovery period, suggesting a need for longer period of time for reversibility 
Repeated-dose Intramuscular Study in New Zealand White Rabbits 
The objective of the study was to evaluate the local tolerance and the potential systemic toxicity of 
the test item, HEXACIMA, after five intramuscular injections at 2-weekly intervals in New Zealand 
White rabbits, followed by a 1-day or 14-day observation period. 
The batch used for this study, which was evaluated in this final stage of Hexacima development, was 
representative of the vaccine to be marketed. The study aimed to bridge the first repeat-dose toxicity 
study, to confirm the nonclinical safety profile, and eventually to support the safety of this optimized 
formulation. 
The study design was the same as the first repeat-dose toxicity study presented above. 
In addition, immunogenicity of Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Hep B antigens was assessed for all animals 
with blood samples collected prior to treatment, on SD58 and SD 71. 
Results: 
Five intramuscular injections of HEXACIMA vaccine at 2-week intervals were clinically well tolerated in 
the male and female rabbit. Toxicological findings were restricted to a persistent inflammatory 
reaction at the injection sites associated with a transient increase in neutrophil counts. Stimulation of 
the lymphoid tissues was also noted. These observations are consistent with the results typically 
recorded after the administration of an aluminium hydroxide adjuvanted vaccine. 
The study was in general considered adequately designed, although the 14-day recovery period was 
not long enough for this study to see a sign of reversibility of findings of lymphoid tissue stimulation 
and histology findings at injection sites. The species was relevant and exposed to the vaccine as 
suggested by immunogenicity data. 
Overall, the study with optimized formulation of Hexacima did not raise major safety concerns. 
Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity of the new process residues in association with Hep B manufacturing was investigated 
based on literature search [i.e., using information from marketed vaccines, regulatory guidance and 
available toxicity data]. None were identified at levels of toxicological concern which could pose risk 
for the infant/toddler population after intermittent use in a vaccine product. A dedicated genotoxicity 
study was therefore not required in line with relevant regulatory Guidelines quoted above.

Carcinogenicity  
In accordance with EMA “Note for guidance on preclinical pharmacological toxicological testing of 
vaccines” (CPMP/SWP/465/95), carcinogenicity studies were not considered necessary as the 
exposure to the vaccine is short term. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
In accordance with EMA “Note for guidance on preclinical pharmacological toxicological testing of 
vaccines” (CPMP/SWP/465/95) and WHO guidelines on nonclinical evaluation of vaccines no 
reproductive or developmental toxicity studies were conducted with Hexacima as the target 
population is infants and toddlers only. Information on reproductive organs effects was obtained 
during the repeat dose toxicity studies and no evidence of toxicity was observed.

Local Tolerance 
Investigative local tolerance and repeated-dose study in the Female Rabbit following 4 
administrations by I.M. Route 
The objective of this investigative study was to determine the systemic toxicity and the local 
tolerance of three different batches of Hexacima following four intramuscular administrations at two-
week intervals to the Female New Zealand White rabbits. 
The design of this investigative rabbit study was similar to that of the first repeat dose toxicity study 
but the focus was on local tolerance. There were some minor differences in design, which were as 
follows: four, not five, doses were administered intramuscularly; the injection sites were in the dorso 
lumbar area instead of the thigh (allowed four separated sites, instead of two); only the sites of 
injection and any abnormal tissues were examined microscopically, and the last sacrifice time was 
extended to 30 days post the last dose (as the lesions observed in guinea pig tests appeared late 
after the injection). 
Four groups of 10 females received 0.5 ml of batches of Hexacima or saline control via intramuscular 
injection on days 0, 14, 28 and 42. 
All animals were observed for morbidity/mortality at least twice daily and for clinical signs and local 
reactions at the injection sites at least once daily. A full clinical examination was performed at least 
weekly. Ophthalmological examinations were performed pre-test and on days 2 and 43 (two days 
after the first injection and one day after the last injection, respectively). The recovery animals were 
also examined on day 56 (two weeks after the last injection). All animals were weighed weekly. Food 
consumption was measured daily for each animal. Clinical pathology samples were collected for 
clinical laboratory determinations from all remaining rabbits once pre-test and on days 2, 43, 57 and 
72. Five females from each group were sacrificed one day after the last dose (day 43); the remaining 
animals were sacrificed 30 days after the last dose (day 72). Selected organs were weighed and a full 
tissue list was taken and preserved. Histopathology examinations were performed on the injection 
sites and any organ/tissue with gross lesions.

tolerated in the female rabbit. Toxicological findings were confined to inflammatory reactions at the 
injection sites with an transient increase in neutrophil counts noted one day after the last injection. 
There was no sign of reversibility of these reactions 30 days after treatment, and the severity of 
inflammatory reactions differed between the batches slightly.  
Histological changes were noted at the injection sites in all treated groups and were mainly 
characterized by inflammatory infiltrate with foam cell aggregate (mainly macrophages), presence of 
amorphous material, cell debris and mixed inflammatory cells. The mixed inflammatory cells 
appeared to be slightly more severe in animals that received vaccine from two of the three batches 
tested. The inflammatory reactions (foam cell aggregate) were still present in the treated groups 30 
days after treatment, suggesting the absence or a slow reversibility of these findings. Other 
inflammatory changes considered to be treatment-related, such as amorphous material with cell 
debris and mixed inflammatory cells were seen very infrequently and with a low severity, suggesting 
these changes were not entirely reversible after 30 days. 
The patterns of noted abnormalities, expected or unexpected (e.g., mean globulin levels and A/G 
ratios, mean cholesterol level, heart weight, etc.), appear to differ between this study and the above 
two standard studies. 
Overall, this investigative study using I.M. route of administration in rabbits did not reveal 
unexpected local reactions (as seen in a release test in guinea pigs using subcutaneous route).  
Since for Alum-adjuvanted vaccines, the I.M. route is a preferred route of administration, the results 
of this rabbit study were considered predictive of human reactions. 
Other toxicity studies 
Not applicable. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No toxicity to the environment is expected for the components of Hexacima. The justification of the 
applicant for not carrying out the studies for an environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) was 
considered acceptable. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The release/characterization tests have demonstrated immunogenicity or potency of each active 
substance of Hexacima in suitable animal models, using Final Bulk Product batches. Either the pre-
defined acceptance criteria were met, or Hexacima was noted to be similar to a reference vaccine, in 
these tests. 
The immunogenicity of the new HBsAg antigen was further demonstrated in a dedicated 
pharmacological study in NMRI female mice where experimental batches were used. In this study, 
antibody response to HBsAg was significantly augmented in the presence of AlOOH adjuvant (0.6 mg 
in 0.5 mL vaccine formulation), with some extent of adjuvanting effect also seen for the PRP-T 
antigen. Furthermore, the addition of AlOOH did not alter the persistence and IgG1/IgG2a balance of 
Hexacima 
Assessment report

humoral responses to these two antigens. However, open question remains as to whether the 0.6 mg 
of AlOOH is representing an optimal amount (or resulting in optimal Adjuvant : antigens ratio(s)). 
This question is pertaining to the EMA adjuvant Guideline, and is more an issue from the benefit/risk 
perspective (satisfactory immunogenicity/efficacy with minimum reactogenicity). It is acknowledged, 
however, that the question may best be addressed in a clinical setting if necessary.     
Also noteworthy is that the new Hep B antigen was demonstrated well compatible with the PRP-T 
antigen and did not undergo any negative interference from any component antigens of Hexacima in 
the presence or absence of AlOOH adjuvant. However, antigen competition analyses were not 
performed on other four antigens, and this failure to measure antibody responses to each of 
Hexacima’s antigens was considered a downside of this pharmacology study, according to the WHO 
and EMA Guidelines. However , the applicant presented 3-year persistence data from A3L26 clinical 
study (see further details under clinical aspects below), revealing similar antibody or protective 
responses to antigens D, T and aP, which hints towards the absence of significant antigen 
interference.  
A dedicated safety pharmacology study was unnecessary for Hexacima, according to the regulatory 
guideline. In view of observed relative heart weight change initially raised during the Hexacima 
Article 58 Procedure the applicant  provided information on historical ranges of this parameter 
supporting the view that the vaccine had no significant adverse effect on heart. 
Overall, the pharmacology programme designed for Hexacima well considers the nature of the 
vaccine (combined, adjuvanted, with a novelty of including new Hep B antigen) and can be generally 
considered adequate. No additional non-clinical studies are considered necessary. 
The nonclinical safety of Hexacima was evaluated in three repeated dose and local tolerance toxicity 
studies (all GLP-compliant) in NZW rabbits. The animals developed specific antibodies against 
Hexacima’s antigens analysed, verifying animal exposure and relevance of the model. Notably, these 
studies were designed to well reflect clinical exposure, including the use of I.M. route of vaccine 
administration, full human dose, and 5x dosing in two standard toxicity studies. The use of reduced 
dosing intervals (2-weeks) in these studies aligns with the WHO Guideline, and can also be 
considered appropriate even from a booster response viewpoint, for the last injection(s). Other 
aspects of study designs (endpoints, timing of blood sampling, recovery groups, etc.) as well as the 
use of final bulk product (initial or optimized formulation) also well meet regulatory expectations. 
The vaccine-related effects, normally expected or indicative of immune stimulation and inflammatory 
responses, have been noted, including clinical signs of erythema and/or edema at injection sites 
(minimal intensity) in two studies, increases in WBC (neutrophils) in all three studies and increased 
globulin levels associated with lower A/G ratios in two studies, the increased lymph node weight and 
the development of germinal centers (minimum to slight) in spleen and lymph nodes in one study, 
and the chronic active inflammation in histology (mainly macrophage infiltrate, minimum to slight in 
intensity) at injection sites in all three studies. These immune reactions- or inflammation-related 
effects were generally reversible, with the exception for lymphoid tissue stimulation and for injection 
site inflammation, where no sign of reversibility was noted after 14-day or up to 30-day recovery, 
respectively.  
Notably, a healing process following inflammation or onset of recovery was suggested by the 
presence of fibroplasia / fibrosis in interstitium/fascia and myofiber regeneration (minimum intensity) 
noted in one study, or the presence of very scarcity of amorphous material with cell debris and mixed 
inflammatory cells and with a low severity noted in another study. Further nonclinical studies aiming 
to expand this finding/effect on reversibility would not be expected to provide additional information 
and are therefore deemed unnecessary for this initial MAA. Further immunotoxicity study following 
routine tiered approach is not applicable to vaccine products and is therefore not needed. The 
Hexacima 
Assessment report

Page 34/126 
 
  
persistence of histological chronic inflammation, together with empirical selection of 0.6 mg quantity 
of AlOOH for 0.5 mL of Hexacima dose, calls for doubts about the optimum of vaccine antigen/AlOOH 
ratio from the immunogenicity/safety perspective. Nonetheless, the chronic histological finding has 
been reflected in SmPC of the product. 
In addition, two studies indicated relative heart weight increase at the end of a 14-day recovery 
period. However, historical control values of relative mean heart-to-body weight ratio of two testing 
facilities showed that the observed changes lie within historical range or are broadly comparable to 
historical control values. This was therefore considered of no relevance and no further studies/data 
are considered necessary.  
Overall, the general toxicity studies did not reveal vaccine-related systemic effects that are 
considered to be of toxicological significance.  
Genotoxicity of process residues in association with Hep B manufacturing was investigated based on 
literature search [i.e., using information from marketed vaccines, regulatory guidance and available 
toxicity data]. None were identified at levels of toxicological concern which could pose risk for the 
infant/toddler population after intermittent use in a vaccine product.  A dedicated genotoxicity study 
is deemed unnecessary, according to relevant regulatory Guidelines. 
Carcinogenicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity studies are not applicable to Hexacima. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the release/characterization tests have demonstrated immunogenicity or potency of each 
active substance of Hexacima in suitable animal models, using four final bulk product batches of the 
optimized formulation. Either the pre-defined acceptance criteria were met, or Hexacima was noted 
to be similar to a reference vaccine, in these tests. 
The general toxicity studies did not reveal vaccine-related systemic effects that are considered to be 
of toxicological significance.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
As mentioned in the Note for Guidance on Clinical Evaluation of New Vaccines 
(CHMP/VWP/164653/2005), “Pharmacokinetic studies are usually not required for vaccines. However, 
such studies might be applicable when new delivery systems are employed or when the vaccine 
contains novel adjuvants or excipients”. As Hexacima is an aluminium hydroxide adjuvanted vaccine 
for intramuscular (IM) injection and contains an established amount of active drug substances, it was 
found acceptable that the applicant did not conduct pharmacokinetic (PK) studies during the clinical 
development of Hexacima. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Hexacima is adjuvanted with an established adjuvant, aluminium hydroxide, which enhances the 
immune response. The quantity of aluminium within Hexacima (600 μg Al+3/0.5 ml dose) does not 
exceed that of other marketed vaccines, which may contain up to 1.25 mg per dose in accordance 
with European Pharmacopoeia monograph 0153 requirements. 
According to available literature, antigenuria has been detected in some instances following receipt of 
a vaccine containing Hib antigen. The only clinical implication is that urine antigen detection may not 
have diagnostic value in suspected cases of Hib disease occurring within 2 weeks of immunization. No 
specific evaluation has been performed for the Hexacima file as this finding has no clinical 
significance.  
The pharmacological profile of Hexacima is represented by its immunogenicity profile evaluated in the 
clinical trials submitted. No dose-response effect study has been generated through this program as 
knowledge for dosing of almost all the antigens constituting Hexacima is well established through the 
clinical and post-marketing experiences with Pentaxim, a diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (acellular, 
component), poliomyelitis (inactivated, adsorbed) and haemophilus influenza type b conjugate 
vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur.  
No dose-finding study was performed for the new Hep B antigen. Hep B containing vaccines are 
usually formulated to contain 3 to 40 μg of rHBsAg per millilitre, and for the infant/toddler targeted 
vaccines their content ranges from 1.5 to 10 μg per dose.  
Dose response studies and randomized comparative trials between 2 yeast-derived rHBsAg vaccines 
reported in the literature have shown repeatedly that a dose of 10 μg of rHBsAg is the optimal 
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013 
Page 37/126 
 
 
 
  
antigen content to use for the infant and toddler vaccines. In addition, for all Hep B valence 
containing combination vaccines evaluated in humans, the HBsAg, when used at the same content as 
with Hep B stand-alone vaccines, remains sufficiently immunogenic to elicit protective levels of anti-
Hep B antibodies. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The studies conducted so far are consistent with the WHO recommendations and cover different 
primary vaccination schedules including the WHO’s Expanded Programme of Immunisation (EPI) 
schedule as well as booster vaccination and concomitant use studies (MMRV, Rotavirus vaccine and 
Prevenar). Additionally, the difference of vaccine efficacy with as well as without Hepatitis B birth 
dose has been tested. Concomitant use together with Meningococcus vaccine or the additional 
application of HB IG has not been evaluated. 
The major difference compared to the previous assessment of the same product under Article 58 
(Hexaxim, EMEA/H/W/2495) is the applicability of the studies conducted worldwide to the EU 
situation. The only Caucasian population was studied in Turkey. The applicant stated that additionally 
to the current provided clinical data package three studies are already planned to give further 
information on EU-specific vaccination schedules (“3+1” versus “2+1”). 
Studies have been conducted in countries of nearly all continents and covering all major ethnicities 
(Hispanic, Asian, African and Caucasian). 
For control acellular as well as whole cell Pertussis vaccines have been used. For the Hepatitis B 
component stand-alone as well as combination vaccines containing Hepatitis B have been used. For 
the polio-component control vaccines included inactivated as well as live-Polio vaccines. 
There are no formal efficacy studies all studies evaluating efficacy use established immunogenicity 
correlates or surrogates of protection. 
In the primary vaccination studies base-line blood draws were only made for the assessment of 
antigens specified in the primary (or secondary) endpoints but all booster studies have pre-
vaccination blood draws. 
Data from studies A3L24 (concomitant-use and lot-to-lot-consistency study) and A3L26 (long-term 
antibody follow-up to 3,5 and 4,5 years of age) have been assessed within this procedure. The data 
from A3L24 has previously been assessed in the frame of a Type II Variation procedure for the article 
58 product Hexacima (EMEA/H/W/2495/II/01) which received a positive Opinion. 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No formal dose response studies have been made as most valences in the vaccine are identical to 
other licensed multivalent vaccines by this company. Only HepB and PRP have been increased (PRP) 
or newly formulated (HepB). 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
In the figure and table below the main 12 studies submitted for this application are presented. All 
together 3424 infants received 3 doses in the primary series (in total 4436 with study A3L24) and 
1511 toddlers received a booster dose. Different immunization schedules and different vaccines for 
Hexacima

comparison have been used; in some studies subjects had received an additional HepB dose at birth. 
In some studies BCG was given according to local standards.

Eight studies (5 primary, 3 booster) were conducted in Hispanic infants and toddlers. 2 studies each 
(1 primary and 1 consecutive booster study) were conducted in African and Caucasian infants and 
toddlers. One study was conducted in Asian infants (primary vaccination). 
The new drug substance HBsAg (produced in Hansenula polymorpha yeast) has been tested in a 
monovalent investigational vaccine in two Phase III studies (PAL02 and PAL03, 10 µg for adolescent 
Hexacima 
Assessment report

and 20µg/dose 16 to 45 years of age). These studies were randomized, comparative, blind-observer 
designs: one in Argentina (344 participants aged 10–15 years) and one in Uruguay (344 participants 
aged 16–45 years). The clinical results of these studies confirmed the safety and immunogenicity 
profiles of the new stand-alone Hep B antigen using both dose schedules. Even if no study reports are 
available for these two studies yet, taking into account the studies with the multivalent candidate 
vaccine already, they were not considered relevant for the assessment of the candidate vaccine. 
The studies included in this application consist of the following: 
Primary vaccination studies 
Phase II: 
•  Study A3L02 in Argentina also uses acellular Pertussis and inactivated Polio components in the 
comparator. No BCG was given at birth. Corresponding booster study: A3L16. 
Non-inferiority for all valences. 
Phase III: 
•  Study A3L04 contains one study arm with infants that have been vaccinated against Hepatitis B at 
birth (Peru sites only). OPV was used in the comparator group. This is the largest study with safety 
as primary objective. 
Descriptive immunological results for HepB in subset (no HepB at birth) only. 
•  Study A3L10 is the only European study. It uses acellular Pertussis and inactivated Polio 
components in the comparator. BCG vaccination at birth was allowed. Corresponding booster study: 
A3L22. 
Regarding primary vaccination: Non-inferiority for HepB, descriptive immunological results for all 
other valences. 
•  Study A3L11 assessed consistency in the production of Hexacima. Here, three batches were tested 
against the comparator Infanrix hexa (acellular Pertussis and inactivated Polio components). BCG 
vaccination at birth had been given. Corresponding booster study: A3L21. 
Regarding primary vaccination: Non-inferiority for D, equivalence testing for 3 batches. Descriptive 
for all antigens. 
•  Study A3L12 aimed to assess the concomitant use of Hexacima with Prevenar 7. It used the 
comparator Infanrix hexa (acellular Pertussis and inactivated Polio components). The impact of the 
concomitant use on the Prevenar serotypes was not assessed.  
Non-inferiority for HepB and PRP, descriptive immunological results for all other valences except 
Prevenar-serotypes. 
•  Study A3L15ps uses OPV and a whole-cell Pertussis containing vaccine as a comparator to 
Hexacima. It is the only study in Africa. BCG vaccination at birth had been given. Corresponding 
booster study: A3L15bo. 
Regarding primary vaccination: Non-inferiority for D, T, HepB, PRP + Polio, descriptive immunological 
results for FHA and PT. 
•  Study A3L17 assessed the immunogenicity and safety of Hexacima close to the end of shelf-life. 
Additionally, the immunological effect of the local practice, to vaccinate pregnant women against 
Diphtheria and Tetanus, on infants in Peru is looked at. The comparator Infanrix hexa (acellular 
Pertussis and inactivated Polio components) is used. BCG vaccination at birth had been given. 
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013 
Page 41/126 
 
  
•  Study A3L24 assessed the concomitant use of Prevenar and Rotarix in comparison with Infanrix 
Hexa. Participants received 3 doses at months 2, 4, and 6. This was a Lot-to-lot non-inferiority study 
with descriptive results for concomitant use. 
Booster studies 
Phase I 
•  In A3L01, is a small study (Phase I), where a booster of Hexacima has been compared to a 
booster of Hexavac. 
Descriptive immunological results for all valences pre- and post-booster. 
Phase II 
•  In study A3L16, follow-up study of A3L02 (Hexacima vs. Pentaxim +Engerix), the booster was 
Pentaxim. 
Descriptive immunological results for all valences pre- and post-booster. 
Phase III 
•  In study A3L22 it has been evaluated whether a booster with Hexacima is similarly immunogenic 
even if the priming has been done with Pentaxim plus Engerix.  
Descriptive immunological results for all valences pre- and post-booster. 
•  In A3L21 it has been evaluated whether a booster with Hexacima is immunogenic even if the 
priming has been done with Infanrix hexa. 
Descriptive immunological results for all valences pre- and post-booster. 
•  In A3L15 4 doses of Hexacima have been compared to 4 doses of CombActHib + 3 doses of 
Engerix (no Engerix booster in the second year of life). Concomitant use of MMRV.  
Descriptive immunological results for all valences pre- and post-booster. 
Immunogenicity was used as a primary endpoint in all of the above 12 studies, except for A3L04 
(safety study). 
Eight studies have been performed in healthy infants (priming) and 5 in healthy toddlers (booster 
studies). 
It was the aim of the development programme to compare Hexacima to licensed vaccines (Infanrix 
hexa, Pentaxim, Hexavac, CombAct-Hib, Tritanrix-HepB/Hib and Engerix B, OPV) with different 
primary vaccination schedules. Primary studies A3L15 and A3L10 used the most condensed 
vaccinations schedules (EPI and 2, 3 and 4 months), which is optimal for accelerated disease control. 
In all other studies subjects have been vaccinated at month 2, 4 and 6, which has advantages 
regarding development of immunogenic responses. Additionally a booster in the second year of life 
(15-19 months), the effect of a hepatitis B vaccination at birth and the co-administration with PCV7 
has been evaluated.

Persistence of Antibodies 
•  Study A3L26 (South Africa) was a follow-up study of A3L15. Antibody titres / seroprotection were 
assessed 2 and 3 years post booster  
Descriptive results: No safety objective. 
In general the used assays, thresholds of protection and methods to explore the new antigens HepB 
and PRP (higher amount) were considered acceptable. The concordance of both anti-D assays and 
both HepB assays were shown.  
The study A3L12 in which Prevenar was used concomitantly did not evaluate a possible interference 
to the immunogenicity of the Prevenar serotypes. This aspect was however evaluated in study A3L24 
as outlined further below.

Main exclusion criteria used in the studies: 
•  Current or planned participation in another clinical trial during the respective study’s time 
•  Suspected/proven immunodeficiency, chronic illness, HepB or C infection or other severe health 
affliction (including thrombocytopenia and bleeding disorders or seizures)

other vaccines during the study time 
•  History of infection with pertussis, tetanus, diphtheria, poliomyelitis, Hib or HepB 
• 
Fever and acute illness at time of inclusion (usually a temporary contraindication) 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria used are commonly used in vaccine trials and standard of care 
and commonly used in clinical trial in the EU.  
All studies discouraged the prophylactic use of antipyretics. 
Statistical considerations of the studies: 
•  Sample size 
The method described by Farrington Manning was used in the primary series studies (except study 
A3L11) for immunological parameter to determine the sample size for non-inferiority with regard to 
the difference in proportion of seroprotected / seroconverted subjects. Pre-defined non-inferiority 
margins were applied (HBs, diphtheria, tetanus, PRP: 10%, polio: 5%, PT, FHA: 10%). The sample 
size was calculated applying a (one-sided) type I error of .025 in order to achieve a global power of 
about 90% with regard to the primary immunological parameters in the different studies. In study 
A3L11 simulation was applied for sample size calculation.  
For the safety study A3L04 sample size was calculated according the method by Blackwelder in order 
to assess whether the DTaP-IPV-HepB-PRP-T-vaccine is non-inferior to the comparator with respect 
to the risk of severe fever following vaccination. No formal sample size calculation was done for the 
booster studies. The methods applied for sample size calculation are comprehensible.. 
•  Randomisation 
Permuted block randomisation was used in the primary series studies. 
The method applied for randomisation is considered acceptable. However, specific information e.g. on 
block size was not included in the application. 
•  Blinding (masking) 
All studies were performed open label. In some studies (e.g. A3L04, A3L11, A3L12, A3L17 and 
A3L24) endpoints were assessed by a blinded observer. It is acknowledged that blinding these 
vaccination studies was not feasible. The CHMP highlighted that safety assessment should have been 
done ideally by a blinded observer in all trials in order to minimise a possible assessment bias. 
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013 
Page 45/126 
 
 
  
•  Statistical methods 
With regard to the primary immunological endpoints the aim of the trials (except A3L11 and A3L24 
(lot-to lot consistency)) was to assess whether DTaP-IPV-HepB-PRP-T was non-inferior to the 
corresponding control. Non-inferiority with regard to a specific immunological endpoint was to be 
concluded if the if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in 
seroprotection / seroconversion rates between DTaP-IPV-HepB-PRP-T and control was above -0.1 
(anti-HBs, anti-diphtheria, anti-tetanus, anti-PRP, PT/FHA) and -0.05 IPV (parameter) respectively. 
The trials were considered successful if non-inferiority could be shown for all primary immunological 
endpoints simultaneously. Lot-to-lot consistency in studies A3L11 and A3L24 was concluded if all 
90% CI (95% respectively)for the pair wise differences in seroprotection / seroconversion rates 
(between the 3 lots) for all primary valences were within the pre-specified equivalence ranges. The 
Wilson-score method without continuity correction was used to calculate confidence intervals for the 
difference of proportions. 
Secondary immunological endpoints were analysed descriptively by means of appropriate statistical 
characteristics (e.g. continuous data: GMT including 95%-CI; categorical data: absolute and relative 
frequencies including 95%-CI).  
The non-inferiority of DTaP-IPV-HepB-PRP-T to the comparator with regard to the risk of severe fever 
was to be concluded if the upper limit of the 95% CI for the relative risk of severe fever was below 3.  
Descriptive analyses were used to analyse the primary series and booster studies. 
In general the statistical analyses method applied were considered acceptable. 
2.5.3.  Primary vaccination studies 
Most primary vaccination studies assess safety and immunogenicity of the vaccination scheme 2, 4 
and 6 months of age (A3L04, A3L11, A3L12, A3L17 and A3L24). One study each assessed the EPI – 
6, 10, and 14 weeks – (A3L15ps) and the “accelerated” vaccination scheme -2, 3, and 4 months 
(A3L10). 
Additionally, the studies have different focuses or specialities: 
Study A3L15ps (6, 10, 14 weeks of age) 
“Immunogenicity Study of a DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T Combined Vaccine in Comparison to CombAct Hib 
Concomitantly Administered with Engerix B Paediatric and OPV at 6, 10, and 14 Weeks of Age in 
South African Infants” 
This study assessed the most condensed schedule which is recommended in the Republic of South 
Africa (RSA): 
For the time being a HepB dose at birth is not recommended in RSA. Nevertheless, the study included 
a third arm where this has been assessed. All antigens (besides PF and FHA) contained in Hexacima 
were tested for non-inferiority. 
Methods 
This study has been conducted in 715 South African Infants as a PIII multicentre trial following the 
EPI schedule. A monovalent hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix B) had been given at birth.  
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013 
Page 46/126 
 
 
 
 
  
This study part consists of visits 0 – 6 (safety 6 months after last vaccination and measles 
vaccination). The booster dose part of the study is described further in the respective section further 
below (Study A3L15bo). 
Study subjects had to be healthy (mothers sero-negative for HIV), full-term born infants. All infants 
had already received one dose of BCG at 0-3 days of age. 
Study Participants  
The ITT population consists of 622 subjects. There was a comparably high amount of drop-outs 
between the two allocation steps. 
Treatments 
All subjects were to receive one dose of the investigational or reference vaccines at 6, 10, and 14 
weeks of age. In addition, subjects in Group 3 were to receive one dose of Engerix B Paediatric 
vaccine at birth. 
Objectives 
Primary objective:   Non-inferiority of immune response against tetravalent wP combined vaccine 
(CombActHib) + OPV + Engerix B one month after the three-dose primary vaccination for D, T, polio, 
HepB and PRP. 
Secondary objective:  To describe in each group the immunogenicity parameters for each primary 
series vaccine component 1 month after the third dose of the primary series, as well as safety. 
Overall, non-inferiority is analysed versus commonly used products in this area and schedule. This 
induces the difference for the pertussis components: Hexacima uses acellular Pertussis antigens 
whilst the comparator uses a whole-cell formulation.  For Polio non-inferiority is analysed for an 
inactivated (IPV-component) versus a live vaccine (OPV). It is feasible for the intended indication to 
prove the appropriateness of the new vaccine against established components. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary serological endpoints 1 month after the third dose of the primary series (i.e. at 18 weeks of 
age) with seroprotection being defined as: 
•  Anti-T antibody (Ab) titres ≥0.01 International Unit (IU)/ml 
•  Anti-D Ab titres ≥0.01 IU/ml 
•  Anti-Hep B Ab titres ≥10 mIU/ml 
•  Anti-PRP Ab titres ≥0.15 μg/ml 
•  Anti-polio 1, 2, and 3 Ab titres ≥8 (1/dil) 
The differences in seroprotection rates between Group 1 (DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T group, without Hep 
B at birth) and Group 2 (CombAct-Hib +Engerix B Paediatric and OPV group, without Hep B at birth) 
were calculated (Group 1 – Group 2). The clinically relevant limit for non-inferiority was –10% for the 
D, T, Hep B, and PRP antigens and 5% for the polio antigens. The statistical method was based on 
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013 
Page 47/126 
 
 
 
 
 
  
the lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference between the 
seroprotection rates. 
Secondary endpoints were Anti-T, anti-D Ab, Anti- HBsAg Ab, Anti-PRP Ab, Anti-pertussis toxoid (PT), 
anti-filamentous haemagglutinin (anti-FHA) Ab and Anti-polio 1, 2, and 3 Ab titres including different 
cut-off levels than those considered for the primary endpoints. 
As the comparator used included a whole-cell formulation of Pertussis non-inferiority of the immune 
response for the aP formulation included in Hexacima would not have been feasible. A descriptive 
analysis for Pertussis is included in the secondary endpoints, which was also acceptable.

Results 
Participant flow  
Of the 715 subjects initially randomized, 93 withdrew prior to group allocation. Thus, the ITT consists 
of 622 subjects. All subjects are accounted for. 
Recruitment 
A two-step subject allocation to the different groups was used. This was followed by vaccination at 
defined ages of the subjects and a blood-draw-visit one month after the third vaccination. All subjects 
were followed-up for safety 6 months after the last primary vaccination. 
Baseline data 
In the ITT Analysis Set, the mean age was similar in all groups and there was a similar distribution of 
males and females in each group. The same results were observed in the PP Analysis Set. The 
majority of subjects were black. The groups were still considered comparable despite the high 
number of drop-outs. 
Numbers analysed 
In study A3L15 622 subjects have been randomized to three different groups. For the exact allocation 
see Table below

Outcomes and estimation of A3L15 
The thresholds defined for long-time immunogenicity are reached for all antigens in the majority of 
cases (for tabulated results, please see the respective table in section “Summary of main studies” 
below). Significantly more subjects achieved very high titres for anti-D in both Hexacima groups. 
Anti-T shows no significant difference to the comparator vaccine. The lower GMT of Hexacima for 
anti-PRP is seen here as well in the lower number of subjects with long-term protective titres. 
All primary endpoints concerning non-inferiority were met: Hexacima was shown to be non-inferior 
compared to priming with CombAct-Hib +Engerix+OPV for D, T, PRP, HepB and Polio. 
D-, T- and Pertussis antibodies were considered satisfactory for Hexacima and for D the correlate for 
long-term protection (≥0,1 IU/ml) is achieved by more than twice the subjects than those who had 
been given CombActHib.  
Anti-PRP (Hib) GMTs are lower for Hexacima subjects but the non-inferiority criterion would even 
have been met if δ had been halved. Thus, the results for this antigen are acceptable as well. 
Reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs) show only a marginal effect of the birth HepB dose 
on antibody titres against D, T, PRP and PT, FHA.  
However, there is, as expected, a clear effect of the birth Hep B dose (Engerix B) on the titer of 
HepB-antibodies (GMT: 330 for group 1 vs. 1913for group 3). The specific effect of a HepB dose 
given at birth is particularly explicit when considering seroprotection rates with a threshold of ≥ 
100mIU/ml. Regarding this threshold 78.8% of subjects were protected after priming with three 
doses of Hexacima when no HepB birth dose has been given. If HepB was administered at birth 
96.9% of subjects were seroprotected after priming with Hexacima. However, at the ≥10mlIU/ml 
level, which is an established correlate of protection against HepB, 95.7% of subjects without a HepB 
dose at birth were seroprotected.  
Hexacima 
Assessment report

Anti-Polio GMTs post vaccination for all three types were significantly higher than needed for 
protection (approximately between 500 and 1000 MN-1/dil after use of Hexacima). Based on the 
seroprotection rate (≥8 1/dil) 1 month after the third vaccination Hexacima was shown to be non-
inferior to the control vaccines.  
In general, GMTs to poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 were higher in the Hexacima group (1) compared to 
the CombAct-Hib + Engerix B + OPV group (2) demonstrating better immunogenicity of IPV 
compared with OPV 
Study A3L10 (2, 3, 4 months schedule) 
This Phase III (mono-centre, open-label, randomized, active-control) trial was conducted in order to 
evaluate immunogenicity and safety of Hexacima compared to Pentaxim (DTaP-IPV/Hib) plus 
Engerix-B Pediatrico in 310 infants. It is also (together with the corresponding booster-study A3L22) 
the only study in Europe: 
“Immunogenicity of DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T Combined Vaccine Compared with PENTAXIM and 
ENGERIX B at 2-3-4 Months Primary Schedule in Healthy Turkish Infants” 
The primary objective of this study focused on anti-Hep B immunogenicity responses and the 
secondary objectives on the safety and descriptive immunogenicity data for all antigens of this 
combined formulation. 
The booster study for this vaccination scheme is Study A3L22 described further below. 
This is the only study conducted in the EU. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
This study has been conducted in one centre in 310 infants in Turkey using a 2, 3, 4 months 
schedule. Two blood draws were made (baseline and one month after the last vaccination). Safety 
follow-up was 6 months after last vaccination. BCG vaccination at birth was allowed. 
Treatments 
3 doses of Hexacima or Pentaxim+ Engerix B were given. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective is the non-inferiority of the Hep B antigen of Hexacima compared to the 
combination Pentaxim + Engerix B one month after vaccination. 
Secondary objective is the description of the other antigens’ immunogenicity, and safety. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
•  Anti-Hep B surface antigen antibody (HBsAg Ab) titres ≥10 mIU/ml assessed at Day 90 (D90; 1 
month after the third dose of the primary series). 
The primary parameter was the difference in seroprotection rate in Hep B antigen (HBsAg) between 
the two groups (DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T and PENTAXIM + ENGERIX B). The clinically relevant limit for 
Hexacima 
Assessment report

non-inferiority was 10%. The statistical method was based on the lower bound of the 95% two-sided 
confidence interval (CI) of the difference in the seroprotection rate between the two groups. 
Secondary endpoints were Anti-T Ab, anti-D Ab, Anti-Hep Bs Ab, Anti-PRP Ab, Anti-pertussis toxoid 
(PT) and anti-filamentous haemagglutinin (anti-FHA) Ab, and Anti-polio 1, 2, and 3 Ab titres including 
different cut-off levels than those considered for the primary endpoints.

Outcomes and estimation of A3L10 
The seroprotection rates to anti-HBs elicited by Hexacima fulfilled the statistical criteria of non-
inferiority to Pentaxim+Engerix one month after priming. 
The results of the secondary objectives are presented below: 
Anti-diphtheria and anti-tetanus antibody responses 
At the ≥ 0.01 IU/ml level, seroprotection rates were similar for both groups for D and T antigens. At 
the ≥ 0.1 IU/ml level, Ab titres were similarly high in both groups for T (≥ 98.6%), but tended to be 
lower in the Hexacima group for D. GMTs were similar in both groups for both D and T. 
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013 
Page 51/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Anti-PT and anti-FHA antibody responses 
Both seroconversion rates and vaccine responses for PT and FHA were similar in both groups. For PT, 
GMTs were similar in both groups; for FHA, they were higher in the Hexacima group than in the 
Pentaxim+Engerix B group. 
Anti-poliovirus antibody responses 
The majority of subjects in both groups (94.0%–100%) had titres ≥ 8 (1/dil) for all poliovirus. GMTs 
were similar in both groups. 
Anti-Hep B antibody responses 
While non-inferiority of Hexacima was shown for Hepatitis B., GMTs were lower in the Hexacima 
group than in the Pentaxim+Engerix B group; however, as high seroprotection rates were achieved at 
the ≥ 10 mIU/ml level, there is no clinical significance to the difference observed for GMTs. 
Anti-PRP antibody responses 
Seroprotection rates (titres ≥ 0.15 μg/ml) for Hexacima were high (≥ 90.7%) but tended to be lower 
than those for Pentaxim+Engerix B. GMTs were similar in both groups. The data confirmed the 
similarity of both vaccines in terms of antibody thresholds (correlate/surrogates of protection).  
Overall, seroconversion/seroprotection rates of all antigens were similar between both groups. As 
seen in study A3L15 the PRP seroprotection rate for Hexacima is slightly (but not significantly) lower 
than for the comparator, GMT rates are comparable.   
Anti-poliovirus response rates measured with the MIT-SA assay in this study are more than 2 dilution 
steps lower compared to the MIT-WT assay used in all other studies. However, as response rates by 
far exceed the minimum protection threshold this finding has no clinical relevance. Sufficient 
seroprotection rates for all three Polio-types have been reached in both vaccination groups (94-
100%). 
Regarding HepB, one month after the third vaccination, similar percentages of subjects acquired 
seroprotection (threshold ≥10mIU/ml); the statistical criterion for non-inferiority of Hexacima 
compared to Pentaxim+Engerix has been fulfilled. However, after administration of Engerix B (group 
2) anti-Hep B GMTs were considerably higher than in the Hexacima group (265 vs. 149, respectively) 
Likewise, the percentage of subjects with anti-HepB titres ≥100mIU/ml is clearly higher in the 
Engerix group compared to Hexacima (78% vs. 65 %, respectively). This could have an influence on 
the duration of protection and should be followed up carefully. 
Study A3L02 (2, 4, 6 months schedule) 
In this trial the immunogenicity of Hexacima in 624 infants born to HBsAg seronegative mothers was 
compared to one of the current standards in Argentina: 
“Phase II Immunogenicity Study of a DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP~T Combined Vaccine Compared with 
PENTAXIM and Engerix B PEDIATRICO at 2, 4, and 6 Months of Age in Healthy Argentinean Infants” 
This study was also powered to demonstrate non-inferiority of Hexacima. 
The booster study A3L16 following this study is described further below.

Results of A3L02 
Participant flow  
604 of 624 subjects completed the study. All subjects are accounted of. 
Baseline data 
In the ITT Analysis Set, the mean age was similar in both groups, and there were similar distributions 
of males and females. All subjects in both groups were Caucasian. The same results were observed in 
the PP Analysis Set. Overall, the groups were comparable. 
Numbers analysed 
Out of 624 subjects who entered the trial 604 completed. 93 subjects were excluded from the PP 
Analysis Set due to protocol deviations. 
Overall, only 260 subjects were included in the per protocol analysis set for the DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-
T group and so the planned number of 265 evaluable subjects was not met for this group. However, 
the conclusions based on the statistical analyses are considered to be valid. 
Outcomes and estimation of A3L02 
Similar percentages of subjects reached the established thresholds of protection for each antigen in 
both vaccination groups. GMTs for anti-T, anti-D, anti-PRP, anti-FHA and anti-PT neither show any 
significant differences between the two vaccine groups. 
Overall, non-inferiority for all antigens of Hexacima against Pentaxim +Engerix B was met.  
The results of the secondary objectives are presented below: 
Anti-diphtheria and anti-tetanus antibody responses 
For diphtheria, 64.2% of subjects in the Hexacima group and 67.9% of the subjects in the control 
group achieved the ≥ 0.1 IU/ml level. For tetanus, all subjects (100%) achieved the ≥ 0.1 IU/ml 
level. For T, GMTs were higher in the Hexacima group than in the control group; for D, GMTs were 
similar in both groups. 
Anti-PT and anti-FHA antibody responses 
For PT, GMTs were lower in the Hexacima group than in the control group; for FHA, they were higher 
in the Hexacima group.

Anti-poliovirus antibody responses 
GMTs for all poliovirus were similar in both groups, although they tended to be higher in the 
Pentaxim+Engerix B group than in the Hexacima group for poliovirus 3. 
Anti-Hep B antibody responses 
GMTs were similarly high in both groups. Tends to be higher for Hexacima 
Anti-PRP antibody responses 
GMTs were similar in both groups. 
The GMTs and RCDCs for anti-T, anti-D, anti-PRP, and anti-FHA were similar in both groups. 
As in study A3L15, the anti-HBs response (GMTs) at V06 (Day 150) was a slightly higher in the 
Hexacima group compared to Engerix B (RIA-Test: 1148 and 850 mIU/ml, respectively). In other 
studies GMTs were similar (A3L12) or higher (A3L10) in the Engerix groups compared to Hexacima. 
99.2% of subjects in group 1 (Hexacima) versus 100% of subjects in group 2 (Engerix B) were 
seroprotected after the primary series.  
Anti-Polio Type 3 GMTs were slightly lower in the Hexacima group compared to Pentaxim + Engerix. 
Seroprotection rates were sufficient for all three Polio types (100% for all groups). 
Study A3L04 (2, 4, 6 months schedule) 
This study was conducted to generate a large number of safety data and focuses for immunogenicity 
on the Hepatitis B component of Hexacima (in subset of 306 Mexican subjects). Here it aims to show 
non-inferiority against the established vaccine of both countries, Peru and Mexico, (Tritanrix-
HepB/Hib) concomitantly given with OPV. A total of 2133 subjects were included in the trial, as 
planned: 1422 subjects were randomized to the Hexacima group (which was further divided into 
three subgroups of 474 subjects who were to receive different batches), and 711 subjects were 
randomized to the Tritanrix-Hep B/Hib. + OPV group:

follow-up after the last vaccination was 6 months. There were two blood draws to determine baseline 
titres and titres 1 month after the last vaccination for Hepatitis B antibodies. Inclusion and exclusion 
criteria are similar to those of the other studies. BCG vaccination had been given at birth. In Peru 
only Hepatitis B vaccine had been given at birth. 
Treatments 
Three doses of Hexacima (three different batches) + Placebo-OPV (distilled water) or Tritanrix-
HepB/Hib + OPV. 
Tritanrix-Hep B/Hib. contains the same valences as DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T (Hexacima), with the 
exception of poliovirus (polio) types 1, 2, and 3.

Results of A3L04 
Participant flow  
1998 of 2133 subjects completed the trial. All subjects are accounted of. 
Baseline data 
In the ITT Analysis Set, for the subset of subjects, mean age was the same in both groups. There 
were more males than females in the Hexacima group, and more females than males in the control 
group. The same results are observed in the PP Analysis Set. The study groups in both countries were 
otherwise comparable.

Outcomes and estimation of A3L04 
In the ITT Analysis Set, all subjects in the DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T and the Tritanrix-Hep B/Hib. + OPV 
groups met the ≥10 mIU/ml anti-HBs threshold for seroprotection. Similar numbers in each group 
also met the ≥100 mIU/ml anti-HBs threshold for seroprotection (96.2% and 98.9%, respectively). 
However, GMT titres in the DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T group were lower than in the Tritanrix-Hep B/Hib. 
+ OPV group (for tabulated results, please see the respective table in section “Summary of main 
studies” below). 
The Anti-HepB GMTs were similar for all three batches. The proportion of subjects meeting the ≥10 
mIU/ml anti-HBs threshold for seroprotection was 100.0% for all three batches of Hexacima. 
This study’s outline and conduct was considered adequate to compare the immunogenicity of the 
Hepatitis B component with Tritanrix-HepB/Hib. Comparing the immunogenicity of Hexacima and 
Tritanrix-HepB/Hib, threefold higher GMTs for Tritanrix compared to the hexavalent candidate vaccine 
have been found (3364 vs. 1075, respectively); however, based on the anti-HBs thresholds of 10 and 
100 mIU/ml, sufficient seroprotection rates in both groups one month after the third vaccination were 
observed.  
Study A3L11 
The purpose of this trial was to provide clinical confirmation that the manufacturing process of the 
second Drug Product generation of the investigational DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T vaccine was consistent 
between three industrial scale batches, in terms of immunogenicity and safety. 
In this four-arm Phase III study three manufacturing consistency lots of Hexacima (Lot S4009, Lot 
S4106 and Lot S4107) were used and compared with one arm receiving Infanrix hexa: 
“Lot-to-Lot Consistency Study of DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T Vaccine Administered at 2-4-6 Months of 
Age in Healthy Mexican Infants” 
Immunogenicity was assessed at V06, 1 month after the third dose of the primary series. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
1189 healthy infants were part of this multi-centre study in Mexico. 
HepB vaccination at birth was an exclusion criterion. The other inclusion and exclusion criteria are 
similar to the other studies. Safety follow-up time was 6 months after the last vaccination. BCG 
vaccination had been given at birth. There were two blood-draws (baseline and one month after the 
last vaccination). 
The booster study A3L21 following this study is described further below.

The participants received either three doses of Hexacima or Infanrix hexa. 
Objectives 
Primary objective of this study was to show equivalence of three batches of Hexacima in terms of 
seroprotection rates and seroconversion rates (Pertussis) one month after the last vaccination. 
Secondary objectives included the description of the immune responses (all antigens) and to show 
non-inferiority against Infanrix hexa for anti-D only and safety. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoints: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Anti-T and anti-D antibody (Ab) titres ≥0.01 IU/ml  
Anti-HBsAg Ab titres  ≥10 mIU/ml) 
Anti-PRP Ab titres ≥0.15 µg/ml 
Anti-pertussis toxoid (PT) and anti-filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA) Ab titres 4-fold increase  
Anti-polio 1, 2, and 3 Ab titres ≥8 (1/dil) 
Three paired equivalence tests on seroprotection/seroconversion rates according to the valence were 
performed 1 month after the third dose of the DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T vaccine in order to 
demonstrate consistency. Equivalence among the three batches would be demonstrated if the global 
null hypothesis for all valences is rejected (D, T, polio types 1, 2, and 3, Hep B, PRP, PT, and FHA). 
The statistical methodology was based on the use of the two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) of 
the differences between pairs of batches for the seroprotection/seroconversion rates. 
Secondary endpoints were Anti-T, anti-D Ab, Anti-HBsAg Ab, Anti-PRP Ab, Anti-PT, anti-FHA Ab and 
Anti-polio 1, 2, and 3 Ab titres including different cut-off levels than those considered for the primary 
endpoints. In addition, response to pertussis (PT, FHA) antigens defined as anti-PT or anti-FHA ≥4 
EU/ml in initially seronegative infants, or at least persistence (post-titer ≥ pre titer) of the Ab titer in 
initially seropositive infants (titer ≥4 EU/ml) were included.

Results of A3L11 
Participant flow  
1056 of 1189 subjects completed the trial. All subjects are accounted of. The number of subjects per 
batch-group is comparable. 
Baseline data 
In the ITT Analysis Set, the mean age was similar in both groups, and there was a similar distribution 
of males and females in each group. The same results were observed in the PP Analysis Set (All 
Hexacima 
Assessment report

subjects in both groups were Hispanic. The four groups were considered comparable in terms of 
demographics. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 1189 subjects were randomized and received a vaccine injection at V01. Therefore these 
subjects were included the ITT Analysis Set. Of these, 1022 subjects received the DTaP-IPV-Hep B-
PRP-T vaccine (batch 1: 340 subjects, batch 2: 343 subjects, batch 3: 339 subjects), and a total of 
167 subjects were randomized to receive the control product Infanrix hexa.  The percentages and 
types of exclusion were similar in the different groups.  288 subjects per treatment group were 
specified in the protocol. Fewer subjects have been evaluable for the PP Immunogenicity Analysis 
Set. 
Outcomes and estimation of A3L11 
Based on 95% CIs, no differences between paired batches of Hexacima were observed (for tabulated 
results, please see the respective table in section “Summary of main studies” below). Therefore, 
equivalence of the three Hexacima batches was concluded based on the 90% and 95% CIs of the 
difference in seroprotection/seroconversion rates using the same margin (5% for polio, 10% for other 
valences). 
Secondary objective included the demonstration of non-inferiority of pooled Hexacima batches versus 
Infanrix hexa based on the anti-D seroprotection and the descriptive analysis of GMTs.  
Comparative immunogenicity (seroprotection/seroconversion) of three batches investigated show no 
significant differences and equivalence between the different Hexacima batches was concluded for all 
valences. Despite the smaller number of analysed subjects, the endpoints were still met. 
As a minor exception, some differences in anti-HepB GMTs were observed between individual 
Hexacima batches: batch 2 was associated to higher GMTs (1566) compared to batches 1 and 3 (935 
and 1009, respectively), based on non-overlapping 95%CIs. However, the GMTs were sufficiently 
high for all batches and no relevant differences in seroprotection rates have been found. 
Consequently, differences reported in this batch to batch consistency study are not clinically relevant. 
Comparing pooled batches, the seroprotection rate for Hepatitis B based on the ≥100 mIU/ml 
threshold criterion one month after the third dose is higher in the Infanrix hexa group (99.2%) 
compared to the Hexacima group (91.7%). Likewise, anti-HepB GMTs were higher in the Infanrix 
hexa group compared to Hexacima (ITT: 1576 vs. 1142, respectively). This may have an influence on 
the duration of protection. 
Anti-D seroprotection of Hexacima vaccinated infants was non-inferior to that of Infanrix hexa 
vaccinated infants. The GMTs for anti-T, anti-D, , anti-FHA and anti-PT show similarity of Hexacima 
and Infanrix hexa. The anti-PRP GMT is significantly better for the pooled Hexacima groups. 
Seroprotection and seroconversion results are similar between the three lots of Hexacima and 
Infanrix hexa. Of note are the relatively high baseline GMTs of anti-D in all vaccination groups. 
For polio types 1, 2, and 3, the Hexacima pooled batches were associated to lower observed GMT 
values compared to Infanrix hexa (PP: 882, 1655 and 1106 vs. 1370, 2337 and 2186 respectively). 
However, seroprotection rates were sufficiently high for all polio-types and for all batches (99.9-
100%).

Study A3L12 (2, 4, 6 months schedule) 
The aim of this study in Asia was to show that infants (who have received one dose of Hep B at birth) 
can be administered Prevenar (7-valent) concomitantly during the priming with Hexacima: 
“Immunogenicity Study of a DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T Combined Vaccine in Comparison to Infanrix 
hexa, Both Concomitantly Administered with Prevenar at 2, 4, and 6 Months of Age in Thai Infants” 
The study focused on specific immunogenicity endpoints (seroprotection rates with anti-Hep B 
antibody titres ≥10 mIU/ml and anti-PRP antibody titres ≥0.15 μg/ml) of Hexacima compared to 
Infanrix hexa. 
Methods 
Study Participants 
412 healthy infants were vaccinated in this multi-centre study in Thailand. Two blood-draws were 
made (baseline and one month after the last vaccination). Safety follow-up time was again 6 months 
after the last vaccination. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar to the other studies. Hep B 
vaccination had been done at birth. No information was available on BCG vaccination. 
Treatments 
The participants received three doses of Hexacima + Prevenar (7-valent) or Infanrix hexa + Prevenar 
(7-valent) 
Objectives 
Primary objective is the demonstration of non-inferiority of the immune response against Hexacima 
HepB and PRP antigens versus those of Infanrix hexa. 
Secondary objectives  are the description of the immune response against each antigen of Hexacima 
and Infanrix hexa and safety. 
The objectives focus on the two “critical” antigens of Hexacima (HepB and PRP). It is to be noted that 
the concomitantly given Prevenar was not evaluated for its serotype immune reaction with the two 
vaccines. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoints: 
•  Anti-HBsAg antibody (Ab) titres ≥10 mIU/ml 
•  Anti-PRP Ab titres ≥0.15 μg/ml 
Secondary endpoints were Anti-T Ab, anti-D Ab, Anti-Hep Bs Ab, Anti-PRP Ab, Anti-pertussis toxoid 
(PT), anti-filamentous haemagglutinin (anti-FHA) Ab and Anti-polio 1, 2, and 3 Ab titres including 
different cut-off levels than those considered for the primary endpoints. In addition, Vaccine response 
to pertussis (PT and FHA) antigens at V06 defined as: anti-PT or anti-FHA in EU/ml ≥LLOQ (=2 
EU/ml) in initially seronegative infants, or at least persistence (post-titer ≥pre-titer) of the Ab titer in 
initially seropositive (titer in EU/ml ≥LLOQ (=2 EU/ml)) were included.

393 of 412 subjects completed the trial. All drop-outs are accounted of. 
Baseline data 
The two groups were comparable. 
Numbers analysed 
The number of subjects with protocol deviations was similar in both vaccine groups.

Outcomes and estimation of A3L12 
Anti-Hep B seroprotection rates at 1 month after the third dose of the primary vaccination series 
were 99.5% for both the Hexacima+ Prevenar group and the Infanrix hexa + Prevenar group (–
0.01% observed difference, two-sided 95% CI: -2.46; 2.43). As the lower limit of the 95% CI was 
greater than –10, the null hypothesis was rejected and the non-inferiority criterion was met 
(minimum threshold used to define seroprotection: ≥10 mIU/ml).  
Anti-PRP seroprotection rates at 1 month after the third dose of the primary vaccination series were 
non-inferior for Hexacima + Prevenar versus Infanrix hexa + Prevenar. 
Immune responses to other antigens (D, T, polio, pertussis) and other immunogenicity parameters to 
Hep B and PRP antigens of the test vaccine vs. Infanrix hexa were analysed as secondary end-points. 
The proportions of subjects meeting surrogate correlates of seroprotection for each valence were 
similar in the two groups, based on overlapping 95% CIs.  
The non-inferiority criteria were met for HepB and Hib. As this study was focussed on investigating 
the immunological response against the Hep B antigen when given concomitantly with Prevenar, it 
Hexacima

should be noted that non-inferior anti-Hep B seroprotection rates (threshold ≥10mIU/ml) and similar 
GMTs were observed compared to the study arm receiving Prevenar and Infanrix hexa concomitantly. 
GMTs of both vaccines are very similar for most antigens, with the following exemptions: 
•  Anti-PRP GMT is significantly higher for Hexacima than for Infanrix hexa vaccinated subjects. The 
reverse cumulative distribution curve (RCDC) shows a pronounced difference beyond 0,1 IU/ml but 
the clinical consequences are unknown. 
•  Anti-Tetanus GMT is statistically significantly lower at visit 6 for Hexacima compared to Infanrix 
hexa. The difference is not considered clinically significant taking into account the small difference 
and that seroprotection levels (long- and short-term) were achieved by all subjects. RCDC for Anti-
Tetanus again shows a pronounced difference beyond 1 IU/ml but the clinical consequences are 
unknown. 
•  In this concomitant use study (with 7-valent Prevenar) anti-Polio1, 2 and 3 GMTs are significantly 
lower (approximately 50%) for subjects in the Hexacima group compared to subjects in the control 
group one month after priming. Nevertheless, at that timepoint (at an age of 7 months) high anti 
Poliovirus antibody titer (types 1, 2 and 3) and sufficient seroprotection rates were measured in this 
study population. Additionally, according to the SmPC, after three doses of the vaccine given during 
the first year of live, a booster in the second year is foreseen. For that reason it can be concluded, 
that concomitant administration of Prevenar does not have a clinically relevant influence on the 
immunogenicity of Hexacima components. 
This study was not aimed to shown an impact of Hexacima on the immunogenicity of the serotypes 
present in Prevenar 7. 
Study A3L17 
This study assessed the immunogenicity of one Hexacima lot close to the end of shelf-life. It also 
assesses the immunological effect of the local practice, to vaccinate pregnant women against 
Diphtheria and Tetanus, on infants in Peru: 
“Immunogenicity Study of DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T Combined Vaccine in Comparison to Infanrix hexa, 
at 2-4-6 Months of Age in Healthy Peruvian Infants” 
Methods 
Study Participants  
263 healthy infants were vaccinated in one single centre in Peru. 
Two blood-draws were made (baseline and one month after the last vaccination). 
Safety follow-up time was again 6 months after the last vaccination. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar to the other studies. 
BCG vaccination had been done at birth. Immune status (sero-negative) of mothers concerning HepB 
was of importance. 
Treatments 
The participants received three doses of either Hexacima or Infanrix hexa. 
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013

According to the sponsor the batch of Hexacima was close to end of shelf-life (30-32 months). This 
should be used to determine any negative effect on immunogenicity. 
Objectives 
Primary objective was the demonstration of non-inferiority of the immune response against Hexacima 
HepB antigen versus those of Infanrix hexa. 
Secondary objective were the description of the immune response against D, PRP and Hep B. The 
titre for D was also measured at both visits, as well as safety. 
Of note, the measurement of D at both blood-draw visits was triggered by the local standard of DT 
vaccination for pregnant women. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
•  Anti-Hep B antibody (Ab) titres ≥10 mIU/ml 
Secondary endpoints: 
•  Anti-D Ab titres at V01, and Ab titres for D, PRP, and Hep B at V06 (7 months of age). 
•  Ab titres above a cut-off (V01): 
o  Anti-D Ab titres ≥0.01 IU/ml, ≥0.1 IU/ml 
•  Ab titres above a cut-off (V06): 
o  Anti-D Ab titres ≥0.01 IU/ml and ≥0.1 IU/ml 
o  Anti- HBsAg Ab titres ≥100 mIU/ml 
o  Anti-PRP Ab titres ≥0.15 μg/ml and ≥1.0 μg/ml 
o  Ab individual titres ratios for anti-D (V06/V01).

Outcomes and estimation of A3L17 
Overall, non-inferiority for HepB was met. The GMTs were comparable for HepB, D and PRP for both 
vaccines (for tabulated results, please see the respective table in section “Summary of main studies” 
below). No negative effect on immunogenicity was seen for the Hexacima batch being near the end of 
shelf-life compared to other studies. 
Of note is the effect of the local standard to vaccinate pregnant women with DT vaccine. This 
obviously affects the GMTs but the thresholds of seroprotection are still reached after the three 
vaccinations. As in the previous study A3L12 the anti-PRP GMT for Hexacima is slightly higher than 
for Infanrix hexa. 
Regarding the anti-Hep B response slightly lower GMTs and a lower seroprotection rate based on the 
≥100mIU/ml threshold criterion were observed for Hexacima compared to Infanrix hexa (GMTs: 986 
vs. 1139; ≥100mIU/ml: 93.9% vs. 99.2%, respectively). These results are similar to those from 
studies A3L011, A3L04 and A3L10.  
Study A3L24 
This was a Lot-to-Lot Consistency Study of DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T Vaccine (Hexacima or Infanrix 
hexa) administered at 2-4-6 Months of Age in Healthy Latin American Infants concomitantly with 
Prevenar and Rotarix, which was carried out in Colombia and Costa Rica. 
Methods 
Study Participants 
This study has been conducted in 1376 Latin American infants. It was a multicentre and multi-
national randomized and observer blind trial. The trial had 4 arms with three arms being different lots 
of Hexacima and the fourth arm Infanrix hexa. All groups received Prevenar and Rotarix 
concomitantly with the hexavalent vaccines. The hexavalent vaccines and Prevenar were given at 2, 
4 and 6 months of age, Rotarix at 2 and 4 months. Blood was drawn from all subjects prior to dose 1 
and one month after the third dose of Hexacima or Infanrix hexa. In a subset of 242 infants (drawn 
equally from all groups, ~60 per group) there was an additional blood draw for anti-RV antibodies 
one month after the second Rotarix dose. Anti-pneumococcal antibodies were measured one month 
after the third dose also only in a subset of 481 infants, again equally selected from all groups (~120 
per group); the antigens contained in the hexavalent vaccines were measured in all infants.

The subjects were followed-up for 6 months after the last vaccination. 
Study subjects had to be healthy, term born infants with a birth weight of >2,5 kg. Informed consent 
had to be given by at least one parent or other legal representative.  Not permitted were multiple 
trial participation, known hypersensitivities to vaccine substances, severe chronic illness (including 
neurological) or the need for blood products or systemic immune modulators as well as prior infection 
with one of the bacteria/viruses included in the vaccines. 
The infants had already received one dose of BCG and HepB according to local immunization 
calendar.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary serological endpoints 1 month after the third dose of the primary series (i.e. at V06, D140) 
for the lot-to-lot consistency and non-inferiority analyses: 
• 
Antibody (Ab) titres for Hep B 
Seroprotection rates for D, T, Hep B, PRP, and poliovirus with the following endpoints: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Anti-T antibody (Ab) titres ≥0.01 International Unit (IU)/mL 
Anti-D Ab titres ≥0.01 IU/mL 
Anti-Hep Bs Ab titres ≥10 mIU/mL 
Anti-PRP Ab titres ≥0.15 μg/mL 
Anti-polio 1, 2, and 3 Ab titres ≥8 (1/dil) 
Sero response rates for anti-PT and anti-FHA with the following endpoints: 
Response to pertussis (PT, FHA) antigens defined as anti-PT or anti-FHA ≥ Lower Limit of 
• 
Quantitation (LLOQ) in initially seronegative subjects, or at least persistence (post-titer ≥ pre-titer) 
of the antibody titer in initially  seropositive subjects (titer ≥ LLOQ) 
Lot-to-lot consistency was concluded if consistency was demonstrated on GMT for HepB and 
seroprotection/-response for all valences of Hexacima first for the PP analysis set and for 
confirmation on the ITT analysis set. The statistical method was based on the lower bound of the 
two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference between 2 pairs of batches of the 
seroprotection/-response rates. 
If the lot-to-lot consistency was demonstrated, the non-inferiority was to be evaluated between the 
Hexyon pooled lots and Infanrix hexa using the differences in seroprotection/sero response rates and 
non-inferiority margin of −10% for D, T, Hep B, PRP, PT, and FHA antigens and –5% for poliovirus 
antigens 
The statistical method was based on the lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) 
of the difference between the seroprotection/-response rates.

subgroups for anti-pneumococcal and anti-rotavirus immune response, A3L24

V04. 
Outcomes and estimation of A3L24 
1) 
Primary Immunogenicity Objectives 
1a) Lot-to-lot Consistency 
Lot to lot consistency was demonstrated for the PP analysis set in terms of Hep B GMTs and 
seroprotection/vaccine response rate for all valences (The ITT set was used for confirmation) 
1b) Non-inferiority of Hexacima versus Infanrix hexa 
Non-inferiority of Hexacima (pooled batches) versus Infanrix hexa regarding seroprotection/sero 
response rates was demonstrated for all antigens. 
2) 
Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives (descriptive) 
2a) Hexacima components 
Data on seroprotection/-conversion based on established thresholds for short and long-term 
protection was provided by the applicant, with FHA and PT judged positive with a 4-fold increase of 
titre.  The results are very similar for both vaccines (Hexacima and Infanrix hexa) except regarding 
anti-T which shows a statistically significant lower rate for (very) long-term protection (>1 IU/ml) for 
the Hexacima batches (73.1% vs. 82.5%). This is confirmed with the GMTs for anti-T being 
significantly lower in the Hexacima pooled-group. Otherwise all thresholds defined for long-time 
immunogenicity are reached for all antigens. 
In terms of GMT, the increase for anti-FHA was significantly higher in the Hexacima pooled-group 
than for Infanrix hexa. Anti-Polio titres on the other hand are significantly higher in the Infanrix hexa 
group. These differences in Anti-Polio titres were not considered to be clinically important as all GMTs 
were very high (from 680 to 1981) and seroprotection rates were sufficient for all three Polio types.

2b) Pneumococcal antibodies 
Table 15 shows that the defined threshold for protection against all serotypes included in Prevenar 
have been reached regardless of the hexavalent vaccine used concomitantly. Table 16 shows that 
GMTs achieved by the concomitant use of Prevenar with Infanrix hexa or Hexacima were similar with 
both hexavalent vaccines for all serotypes except serotype 14. Here, the GMT was significantly lower 
for Hexacima than in the Infanrix hexa group. As seroprotection levels were reached (and the 
difference of GMTs is quite small this is not considered a clinical concern.

2c) Rotavirus antibodies 
One month after the 2nd Rotarix administration, the observed Rotavirus GMTs values were high in 
both groups: 110 U/mL in the Hexacima-pooled-batches-group and 155 U/mL in the Infanrix hexa 
group. 
Additionally, as shown below, comparing both groups similar percentages of subjects were 
seroprotected after vaccination with Rotarix (84% vs. 86.9%, Hexacima and Infanrix hexa 
respectively). 
As already mentioned above, a study comparing concomitant use vs. a staggered approach is not 
available. However, considering historical data, these seroprotection rates are similar to those known 
from different studies of the Rotarix approval application reflected in the Rotarix SmPC.

3) 
Observational Objectives 
3a) Immunological effect of the use of antipyretics 
The use of antipyretics prior to or after the vaccinations did not impact the seroprotection/-
conversion rates for the antibodies against Hexacima-antigens. Neither are the GMTs against those 
antigens affected. Sole exception is the HepB: If an antipyretic has been used 6 hours before or up to 
12 hours after vaccination, the HepB GMTs were significantly lower in comparison to those who did 
not us an antipyretic drug. However, this was not considered clinically relevant as the GMTs were 
very high and the seroprotection rates are nearly 100%. 
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013 
Page 70/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Only the Hexacima groups were used for the observational endpoint concerning the eventual effect of 
antipyretics on immunogenicity, thus, there is neither a comparison of immunogenicity nor of the 
safety results concerning use of antipyretics between Hexacima and Infanrix hexa. 
Overall, endpoints, conduct, and general outline of the study were adequate to demonstrate 
equivalence between the three lots of Hexacima and non-inferiority of the immune response to 
Hexacima versus Infanrix hexa. This is demonstrated for seroprotection and seroconversion levels as 
well as for GMT-thresholds of short- and long-term protection for all antigens of the hexavalent 
vaccines. 
Seroconversion and GMTs against the different serotypes of Prevenar 7 are also very similar between 
the vaccination groups except for serotype 14 that shows a statistically though not clinically 
significantly lower value for the concomitant use with Hexacima versus Infanrix hexa.  
Likewise, no clinically relevant differences were observed in Rotarix immunogenicity responses when 
co-administered with Hexacima or Infanrix hexa. GMTs and seroprotection rates in this study were 
similar to that known from approval studies where Rotarix had been administered without a 
concomitant vaccine. 
There was no non-inferiority analysis made for concomitant use with the two hexavalent vaccines.  
Neither were the concomitant versus single use with both hexavalent vaccines part of this trial. 
Nevertheless, this study does not show any negative effect of the concomitant use of Hexacima with 
Prevenar and Rotarix for the immune response against any of the vaccines’ antigens. 
Comparison of Hepatitis B results of all primary vaccination studies 
As summarized in the table below sufficient seroprotection rates have been achieved in all studies 
(shadowed in yellow). For the more condensed vaccination schedules (A3L15 and A3L10) lower GMTs 
have been found compared to the less condensed schedules. 
Comparing the different HepB vaccines (Engerix, Tritanrix or Infanrix hexa or Hexacima) used in 5 4 
out of 8 priming studies (A3L10, A3L04, A3L11, A3L17 and A3L24) higher GMTs have been found in 
the control groups compared to the Hexacima groups (highlighted in yellow). Moreover, taking into 
account the ≥ 100 mIU/ml threshold, higher seroprotection rates have been found for the control 
groups compared to the Hexacima groups (A3L10: 64.9% vs. 78.1%; A3L04: 96.2% vs. 98.9%; 
A3L11: 91.7% vs. 99.2% and A3L17: 93.9% vs. 99.2%, respectively). It is known that higher anti-
HBs concentrations will take longer to decline below the minimum threshold for protection of ≤ 10 
mIU/ml. Lower GMTs might therefore indicate a shorter persistence of protection, which should be 
followed up post authorisation.

Booster vaccination studies 
For the majority of clinical booster trials, only Hexacima was administered as a booster dose.  
In one study, A3L15, 4 doses of Hexacima have been compared to 4 doses of CombActHib + 3 doses 
of Engerix (no Engerix booster in the second year of life). In this part of the report only the booster 
part of the study is presented (A3L15bs). 
In study A3L22 it has been evaluated whether a booster with Hexacima is immunogenic even if the 
priming has been done with Pentaxim plus Engerix.  
In A3L21 it has been evaluated whether a booster with Hexacima is immunogenic even if the 
priming has been done with Infanrix hexa. 
In study A3L16, follow-up study of A3L02 (Hexacima vs. Pentaxim +Engerix), the booster was 
Pentaxim. Here no evaluation of the Hepatitis B immunogenicity has been performed. 
A3L01 is a small study (Phase I), where a booster of Hexacima has been compared to a booster of 
Hexavac. 
Study A3L15bo 
MMRV vaccines are largely implemented in vaccination calendars during the second year of life. The 
aim of this study was to show that toddlers can be administered Trimovax and Varilrix concomitantly 
with Hexacima. 
Methods 
Study Participants 
Study subjects from the primary study phase were boostered in this study at the age of 15-18 
months of age. The same inclusion and exclusion criteria applied. Additionally, the toddlers’ 
infectiological status now was of interest (HIV, HepB, HepC). This part consisted of visits 7 (pre-
booster Blood-draw and vaccination) and 8 (one month after vaccination blood-draw). 
Treatments 
One booster dose of Hexacima (Groups 1 and 3) or CombActHib + OPV was given. Concomitantly, 
one dose of MMRV was offered and given to the majority of subjects (93,3 - 99,3%). 
This was the only study were the same vaccine has been used for priming and the booster 
immunisation. Group 2, which had been primed with CombActHib + Engerix, were vaccinated in the 
second year of life with CombActHib only, no Engerix booster has been given.

Results of A3L15bo 
Participant flow 
565 of 567 subjects finished the study, the drop-out between the two study phases (primary and 
booster vaccination parts) is very low and not considered an issue. 
Conduct of the study 
The following amendments were made and approved of by IECs and MCC: 
• 
The addition of MMR and varicella vaccinations at 15 to 18 months of age, and a change in the 
timing of the booster dose to 15 to 18 months 
•  Amendment to the ICF, and addition of inclusion criteria for booster phase (namely, signing of 
ICF addendum, plus subject’s age) 
• 
The collection of information on injection site events / reactions for the MMR and varicella 
vaccines during the booster phase, and addition of extensive limb swelling after the booster 
vaccination as a solicited AE 
•  Clarification of the relevant vaccine for each immunogenicity endpoint, and the analyses to be 
performed 
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013

• 
The addition of a secondary endpoint to allow the optimal analysis of immunogenicity results from 
aP components constituting the investigational vaccine 
•  Anti-polio Ab titres assay changed from Hep2 cell culture to mammalian cell culture 
•  Anti-PRP Ab titres assay changed from enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to RIA, and the LOQ changed 
from 0.065 μg/ml to 0.06 μg/ml 
• 
The addition of five further protocol violation criteria for the PP Analysis Set (three for the 
primary series and two for the booster series): “no definite contraindication present at the time of 
vaccination with any dose and no development of a relevant exclusion criterion that may affect 
immunogenicity assessment during the entire trial period; and “BL2-V05 (D570) drawn or with 
any measurement available” and “no contraindications to the study vaccine Nos. 3 to 7, no 
contraindications to MMR Nos. 2 to 5, and no contraindications to varicella Nos. 2 to 5” for the 
booster phase. The following violation criterion: "Use of vaccine declared not usable due to cold 
chain break" was also used for the booster phase. 
•  Update on the assessment method for testing Haemophilus influenzae antigen (PRP). The ELISA 
technique was replaced by RIA. 
•  Confirmation of which MMRV assessment methods were performed, their LLOQs, and addition of 
an additional functional testing. 
Baseline data 
In the ITT Analysis Set, the mean age was similar in all groups and there was a similar distribution of 
males and females in each group. The same results were observed in the PP Analysis Set. The study 
groups are comparable.

Outcomes and estimation A3L15bo 
GMTs and seroconversion rates for the Hexacima antigens after the booster vaccination were  similar 
between the groups (for tabulated results, please see the respective table in section “Summary of 
main studies” below). Persistence of antibodies is significantly better for anti-D but significantly worse 
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013 
Page 76/126 
 
 
 
 
 
  
for anti-T in the Hexacima groups. Of note, the significant difference for anti-T vanishes after the 
booster. 
One month after vaccination (group 1: Hexacima + MMRV vs. group 2: CombAct Hib + OPV+MMRV) 
immune responses to the MMR and varicella were assessed, in terms of seroprotection rates at 
predefined thresholds.  
Sero responses to MMRV were assessed using two methods: ELISA or functional 
(Neutralization/FAMA: Florescent antibody to membrane antigen) tests. 
D,T,P, Polio, Hib and Hep B immune responses 
In general, GMTs and seroconversions are very similar for both vaccines. Anti-PRP GMTs that had 
been slightly lower in the Hexacima group after primary vaccination are now at the same level as in 
the CombActHib-group. Antibody persistence is also very similar between the groups and within 
known bounds of other combination vaccines for this indication. 
RCDCs show only a marginal effect of the birth HepB dose on antibody titres against D, T, PRP and 
PT, FHA concerning persistence and booster effect. 
Regarding HepB, the lowest pre-booster GMTs were observed in Group 1 (Hexacima, without HepB at 
birth) when compared with Groups 2 and 3 (51.3, 103 and 228 mIU/ml, respectively). Similarly, the 
lowest seroprotection rate (78.9%) was found in Group 1. However, after the booster dose, the 
seroprotection rate (≥ 10 mIU/ml) was 98.5% for Hexacima. 
Concerning polio, no clinically significant differences in seroprotection rates and GMTs comparing 
Hexacima with or without a Hep B-at-birth-dose (group 1 vs. group 3) have been observed. Of note, 
in group 2, in which OPV has been used for primary vaccination, lower immune responses have been 
measured post booster. 
However, post-booster seroprotection rates were similar for all valences tested (HepB, Polio, Tetanus, 
Diphtheria and Pertussis).  
Overall, concomitant use of Trimovax (Schwarz strain, Urabe AM9 strain and Wistar RA 27/3M) and 
Varilix (Oka strain) investigated in study A3L15bo demonstrated that subjects were sufficiently 
protected against all valences included in Hexacima. 
MMRV immune responses 
Comparing GMTs and seroprotection rates of measles, mumps, rubella and varicella components no 
clinically relevant differences have been found between group 1 (Hexacima +MMRV) and group 2 
(CombActHib + OPV+MMRV).  
For measles and rubella acceptable protection levels have been reached by the majority of subjects 
(100% and 97.4%, respectively).  
Regarding the mumps component a correlate for protection is not established.  96.9% of vaccinees 
acquired an antibody titer ≥60 l/dil (used as a cut-off set for the neutralisation assay).  
Regarding the varicella component only 81.8% of subjects acquired minimum titres corresponding to 
the accepted surrogate parameter of ≥ 4 l/dil. This finding is particularly important as some countries 
do not recommend a second dose of varicella vaccine.  Following administration of a single dose of 
currently marketed varicella vaccines seroconversion is usually observed in about 95% of healthy 
children (WER 7332).  
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013 
Page 77/126 
 
 
 
  
No comparison of concomitant use versus administration at different time points has been performed. 
Considering the historic comparison low varicella seroprotection rate of only 82% must be interpreted 
as an immunological interference phenomenon. Therefore it was reflected in the SmPC that 
• 
• 
data on concomitant administration of a booster dose of Hexacima with measles-mumps-rubella 
vaccines have shown no clinically relevant interference in the antibody response to each of the 
antigens, and  
that there may be a clinically relevant interference in the antibody response of Hexacima and 
Varilrix and these vaccines should not be administered at the same time. 
Study A3L22 
This study evaluated whether a booster with Hexacima is immunogenic even if the priming has been 
done with Pentaxim plus Engerix: 
“Immunogenicity and Safety Study of a Booster Dose of DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T Combined Vaccine at 
15 to 18 Months of Age Following a Primary Series at 2, 3 and 4 Months of Age in Healthy Turkish 
Infants” 
Methods 
Study Participants 
This was the booster study for study A3L10. The same (still healthy) subjects were enrolled if consent 
was given. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were appropriate for a booster study setting. 
Safety follow-up time was again 6 months after the vaccination. 
Treatments 
The participants received one dose of Hexacima, no control. 
Objectives 
The objectives were to describe antibody persistence against all antigens in either Hexacima or 
Pentaxim +Engerix B and to describe the immunogenicity of the booster dose of Hexacima. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The following endpoints were used to assess the Ab persistence (for all valences) before the booster 
dose at Day 0 (Visit [V01]): 
•  Ab titres for each valence 
•  Ab titres above a cut-off: 
•  Anti-T Ab titres ≥0.01 IU/ml and ≥0.1 IU/ml 
•  Anti-D Ab titres ≥0.01 IU/ml and ≥0.1 IU/ml 
•  Anti-Hep Bs Ab titres ≥10 mIU/ml and ≥100 mIU/ml

Results of A3L22 
Participant flow 
254 of the 302 subjects who completed the primary vaccination study were enrolled in this study. Of 
those all but two completed this booster study. Those two subjects did not receive Hexacima as a 
booster but Pentaxim as no consent was given for Hexacima. This possibility was included in the trial 
outline.

Outcomes and estimation of A3L22 
In view of GMTs and individual GMT ratios for selected valences that pronounced differences between 
the two groups were shown. Anti-T and anti-D GMTs after the booster dose were significantly lower in 
the Hexacima primed group than for the Pentaxim primed group. 
Concerning the persistence of antibodies the two groups (Hexacima versus Pentaxim+Engerix B 
primed) are similar. The booster effect is also very similar for most antigens. Although the GMT 
individual ratio for PRP shows a pronounced difference between Hexacima (being lower) and 
Pentaxim primed toddlers this effect is not considered of clinical relevance. 
The pronounced difference for anti-D and anti-T between booster effect of Hexacima and Pentaxim 
primed toddlers with the Hexacima primed group reaching significantly lower (halved for anti-D) the 
GMT of the Pentaxim primed group as well as the difference in the individual ratio might be a concern 
when it comes to the timing of a next booster. Nevertheless, concerning seroprotection (long and 
short-term levels) this criterion was fulfilled in both groups for nearly all but one subject (long-term 
level).  
Anti-PT GMTs were significantly lower for Hexacima primed subjects in the inter-individual 
comparison, too. Again, the surrogate for protection (4-fold increase of titres) was similar to 
Pentaxim primed individuals.  
Overall, although seroprotection levels were reached in all cases there are significant differences in 
the immunogenicity for some antigens.  
Pre-booster GMTs for HepB in Group 2 (priming with Pentaxim +Engerix) were higher than in Group 1 
(priming with Hexacima) and the percentage of subjects with seroprotection titres was only 80.7% 
for  the Hexacima group versus 99% for  the Engerix group (threshold criterion ≥10 mIU/ml). As 
stated previously, in case no booster vaccination would be given in the second year of live, this could 
Hexacima

have a negative effect on the persistence of protection. However, regardless which HepB containing 
vaccine was used for the primary series (Pentaxim plus Engerix or Hexacima) following booster 
vaccination with Hexacima all groups experienced an effective anamnestic anti HepB immune 
response.  
Following primary vaccination with Hexacima, but before booster vaccination sufficient percentages of 
subjects were still seroprotected against polio types 1 and 2 . However, regarding polio type 3 only 
85.2% of subjects had sufficiently high anti-polio type 3 titer ≥ 8 1/dil. Nevertheless, this effect is 
not considered to be of clinical relevance as after booster vaccination with Hexacima a substantial 
increase of GMTs has been measured for all polio types and 100% of subjects were seroprotected. 
Study A3L21 
This study aims to show whether a booster with Hexacima is immunogenic regardless if the priming 
has been done with Infanrix hexa or Hexacima (3 batch consistency study A3L11): 
“Immunogenicity Study of the Antibody Persistence and Booster Effect of the DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T 
Combined Vaccine at 15 to 18 Months of Age Following a Primary Series of DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T or 
Infanrix hexa Administered at 2, 4, and 6 Months of Age in Healthy Mexican Infants” 
Methods 
Study Participants 
This is the booster study for study A3L11. The same (still healthy) subjects were enrolled if consent 
was given, one centre from the primary study did not participate in the booster study, thus, those 
children are missing here. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were appropriate for a booster study setting. 
Safety follow-up time was again 6 months after the vaccination. 
Treatments 
One dose of Hexacima for all participants 
Objectives 
Immunogenicity was assessed in a subset of approximately 300 subjects. 
The objective was the persistence of antibodies for all antigens and the description if the 
immunogenicity of the booster dose Hexacima.

Results of A3L21 
Participant flow 
881 out of the 1056 subjects who completed the primary vaccination study were enrolled in this 
study. 
Of these 881 subjects, 768 had received Hexacima and 113 Infanrix hexa in the previous study. 
875 of 881 toddlers completed the trial; all drop-outs are accounted for. 
Baseline data 
In the ITT Analysis Set, the mean age was similar in both groups, and there was a similar distribution 
of males and females in each group. The same results were observed in the PP Analysis Set. The 
groups were comparable.

Analysis Set; A3L21  
N: number of subjects analysed according to ITT for Immunogenicity Analysis Set; n: number of subjects; %: percentages are calculated according to 
the subjects in ITT for Immunogenicity Analysis Set;  
The number of subjects per group was comparable in both ITT and the PP analysis sets. 
Outcomes and estimation of A3L21 
The immunogenicity analysis subset consisted of 310 subjects.  
For all antigens the booster dose of Hexacima produced similar results regardless of the priming 
vaccine. Persistence of antibodies was similar in the two groups as well. 
Antibody persistence and booster effect were similar between the two groups (three individual 
batches of Hexacima or Infanrix hexa primed) for most antigens.   
Prior to the booster 89.8 % of subjects primed with Hexacima were still seroprotected against Hep B 
(≥10mIU/ml threshold); in the control group primed with Infanrix hexa even 95.4 % reached this 
threshold. As similar (or even higher) differences in the pre-boost seroprotection rates have been 
found in the majority of booster studies (A3L15s, A3L22, A3L16 and A3L21) this could be a signal for 
reduced persistence of protection and should be followed up carefully on a long term basis. However, 
at an age of 15 to 18 months after a 4th dose of Hexacima 99.4% of subjects were seroprotected.  
Similar to study A3L22, prior to booster vaccination significantly lower GMTs have been found for 
poliovirus type 3 in the group primed with Hexacima compared to the group primed with Infanrix 
hexa (GMT: 339 vs. 896, respectively). For poliovirus types 1 and 2 no such statistically significant 
differences have been observed.  
Nevertheless, seroprotection rates have been sufficient at that timepoint (96.5% for anti-poliovirus 
type 3 and 100 % for the other poliovirus types). 
Following booster vaccination with Hexacima a substantial increase of poliovirus-antibodies (all types) 
was measured, and all subjects were seroprotected against all poliovirus types. 
Altogether, taking into consideration the high level of antibodies and the sufficient seroprotection 
rates, these differences do not have clinical relevance.

Study A3L01 
This Phase I study assessed the effect of one dose of Hexacima versus Hexavac on toddlers that had 
been primed according to local standard:

Vaccine or HEXAVAC in Healthy Argentinean 16- to 19-Month-Old Toddlers” 
Methods 
Study Participants 
In this phase I mono-centre study the 60 healthy subjects had been primed with 3 doses of standard 
infant T, D, wP, OPV or IPV, Hib and HepB vaccines for Argentina.  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are similar to other studies. Additionally, blood chemistry was tested 
prior to vaccination and compared to the second blood-draw for safety reasons (Phase I). 
Treatments 
One dose of either Hexacima or Hexavac 
Objectives 
The primary objective was the safety of one dose of Hexacima as this was the phase I  in the clinical 
development. 
Immunogenicity of the booster dose was documented as the secondary objective for all components. 
This conduct was considered common for very early (Phase I) vaccine trials.

Results of A3L01 
Participant flow 
All 60 subjects enrolled in the study (30 per group) completed the trial. 
Baseline data 
The Hexavac group had 2/3 male subjects, the ratio in the Hexacima group was 50/50. Otherwise 
(weight, BMI, age) the groups were comparable. 
As this study’s main purpose is the generation of safety data in a small scale the sex imbalance was 
not considered of importance. 
Numbers analysed 
Although there were protocol deviations in 10 subjects (6 for Hexacima and 4 for Hexavac) data are 
presented for all subjects with available results (6 subjects are missing specific titrations). 
Outcomes and estimation of A3L01  
Sufficient GMTs were reached after the booster regardless of the vaccine used. Baseline titres show 
that seroprotection against Tetanus, Polio and Hepatitis B was still given in the majority of subjects. 
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013

These “first” GMTs show a similar reaction for both vaccines for most antigens. Anti-D and Anti-FHA 
are somewhat lower for Hexacima but ranges overlap. Anti-PRP for Hexacima is higher than for 
Hexavac, again, ranges overlap. 
Nearly all subjects were still seroprotected before the booster. Anti-D and Anti-PRP show the lowest 
rates here (40 and 60% respectively); all reached sufficient seroprotection levels after the booster 
regardless of the vaccine used. 
In summary, booster vaccination with Hexacima induces higher antibody-titres regarding HepB 
compared to Hexavac.  Generally, all antibody-titres measured were very high and seroprotection 
rates against both diseases (Polio and Hepatitis) were nearly 100% post-booster 
Study A3L16 
A booster with HepB in the second year of life is not a current practice in all countries. The aim of this 
study was to evaluate a booster with a pentavalent combined vaccine following Hexacima primary 
series:

Methods 
Study Participants 
This study assessed the effect of a booster dose of Pentaxim on healthy toddlers who had been 
primed with Hexacima or Pentaxim+Engerix B in studyA3L02. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are similar to other studies. 
Treatments 
One dose of Pentaxim 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study is to describe the persistence of antibodies and seroprotection 
induced by the primary vaccination with Hexacima and the effect of the booster vaccination with 
Pentaxim. 
The secondary objective was safety. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Antibody persistence: 
•  Anti-T and anti-D Ab titres ≥0.01 international unit (IU)/ml, ≥0.1 IU/ml, and ≥1 IU/ml 
•  Anti-HBsAg Ab titres ≥10 mIU/ml 
•  Anti-PRP Ab titres ≥0.15 µg/ml and ≥1.0 µg/ml

•  Anti-T and anti-D Ab titres ≥0.01 IU/ml, ≥0.1 IU/ml, ≥1.0 IU/ml, and individual titres ratio 
(V02/V01) 
•  Anti-PRP Ab titres ≥0.15 µg/ml, ≥1.0 µg/ml, and individual titres ratio (V02/V01) 
•  Anti-PT and anti-FHA Ab titres ≥4 EU/ml, 4-fold increase, individual titres ratio (V02/V01) 
•  Anti-polio 1, 2, and 3 Ab titres ≥8 (1/dil), and individual titres ratio (V02/V01)  
The booster response to Pertussis (PT and FHA) was defined in the SAP as follows: 
•  Subjects whose pre-vaccination Ab concentrations were less than the lower limit of quantitation 
(<LLOQ) demonstrated a booster response if they had post-vaccination levels ≥4 x LLOQ 
•  Subjects whose pre-vaccination Ab concentrations were ≥LLOQ but <4 x LLOQ demonstrated a 
booster response if they had a four-fold response (i.e. post-/pre-vaccination ≥4) 
•  Subjects whose pre-vaccination Ab concentrations were ≥4 x LLOQ, demonstrated a booster 
response if they had a two-fold response (i.e. post-/pre-vaccination ≥2) 
Results of A3L16 
Participant flow 
458 of the original 604 subjects who had completed study A3L02 were enrolled in this study. Of those 
453 completed this study. All drop-outs are accounted for. 
Baseline data 
In the ITT population, the mean age in both groups was similar, and there were similar proportions of 
males and females in each group. The two groups were still comparable. 
Numbers analysed 
All 458 subjects were included in the ITT population. 
Outcomes and estimation of A3L16 
Persistence of antibodies was similar in both groups for all antigens. Seroprotection was still given in 
the majority of subjects for most antigens and again similar in both groups.  
Seroprotection levels were achieved for all antigens in all subjects after the booster vaccination. 
Individual titres ratios show significantly lower titres for Anti-PRP, Anti-T and Anti-FHA in Hexacima 
primed subjects. The CHMP discussed the clinical relevance of this difference and considered that the 
unusual differences of GMTs seen in studies like A3L16 cannot be attributed to intrinsic or extrinsic 
factors. As also no trend is seen across studies, the clinical relevance was judged negligible.  
Hexacima 
Assessment report

As in the other studies, proportion of subjects with anti-HBs pre-boost seroprotection titres (≥10 
mIU/ml) was higher in subjects primed with Pentaxim and Engerix B compared to those primed with 
Hexacima. A HepB booster has not been evaluated in this study.  
Comparison of Hepatitis B results of all booster vaccination studies  
In summary,  for all booster studies (AL315, A3L22, A3L16 and A3L21) lower pre-boost GMTs and 
lower seroprotection rates have been found for the Hexacima primary series when compared with 
Engerix, Tritanrix or Infanrix hexa (Table 24 below, marked in green).  
In one arm of study A3L15 (group 2, primed with Engerix B) no Hep B booster vaccination has been 
administered. Nevertheless, at months 15 to 19, the Engerix group in this study still had a 
seroprotection rate of 92% (threshold: ≥ 10IU/ml), which was significantly higher compared to the 
primary series performed with Hexacima (78.9%).  
Following administration of a booster dose of Hexacima (4th dose), which has been done for all 
groups in all booster studies (apart from study A3L01 where Hexavac has been administered in a 
control group), a typical anamnestic antibody response resulting in high anti-HBs concentrations 
(ranging from 1379 to 44893) have been measured one month later.  This effective response 
observed in all groups of healthy vaccinees confirms the presence of immunologic memory. Almost all 
subjects (97.3% to 100% of subjects) were seroprotected one month after booster vaccination with 
Hexacima.

Persistence of antibodies 
A3L26 
This study evaluated antibody persistence in healthy South African children after the primary series 
and booster vaccination with Hexacima or Control Vaccines 
This phase III multicentre-study was conducted in children that had successfully completed study 
A3L15. Primary vaccination with or without Hepatitis B-vaccination at birth took place at 6, 10 and 14 
weeks using either Hexacima or CombAct Hib + EngerixB + OPV. Booster vaccination using either 
Hexacima or CombAct Hib + OPV (no Engerix B) took place at 15 to 18 months of age. Group 
allocation was conserved and the children’s’ antibodies were measured at 3,5 (2 years post booster 
dose) and 4,5 years of age (3 years post booster dose). No vaccine was applied in this study. 
Endpoints of this study are as follows: 
•  Ab titres for each valence (except poliovirus) 
•  Ab titres above a cut-off were defined as follows: 
o  Anti-D Ab titres ≥ 0.01 IU/mL, ≥ 0.1 IU/mL and ≥ 1.0 IU/mL 
o  Anti-T Ab titres ≥ 0.01 IU/mL, ≥ 0.1 IU/mL and ≥ 1.0 IU/mL 
•  Anti-PT (Pertussis Toxin ) and anti-FHA (Filamentous Hemagglutinin) Ab titres ≥ LLOQ (Lower 
Limit of Quantitation), ≥ 2x LLOQ, and ≥ 4x LLOQ1 
•  Anti-Hep B Ab titres ≥ 10 mIU/mL and ≥ 100 mIU/mL 
•  Anti-PRP Ab titres ≥ 0.15 μg/mL and ≥ 1.0 μg/mL

•  Kinetic curves for each Ab criterion based on GM of titres (GMT) at each time point were plotted 
including the primary series, booster, and long-term time points. 
Sample size was not calculated and of the children originating from study A3L15 (567 subjects) 455 
had informed consent to participate in this study. Of those 453 were included for the 3,5 year time 
point analysis and 436 for the 4,5 year time point analysis. 
Inclusion criteria included completion of the precursory study A3L15. Exclusion criteria included 
receipt of blood (-derived products), immunosuppressant drugs or various diseases (incl. HIV and 
HepC, Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis Hepatitis B, Poliomyelitis, Hib caused meningitis). Allowed 
vaccinations 30 days previous to the blood draws in this study are measles, OPV/IPV, pandemic 
influenza vaccine. According to the sponsor a mass vaccination campaign with measles vaccine co-
administered with trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine was implemented in South Africa in April 2010. 
Therefore, subjects receiving such poliovirus vaccination could not be analysed for poliovirus long-
term antibody titres following A3L15 primary series/booster phase. As a consequence, the 
persistence of the immune response against poliovirus types was not analysed in this study. 
Group allocation: 
Group 1: DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T vaccine injected at primary series 
Group 2: DTwP-Hib (CombAct-Hib) + Hep B (Engerix B) + OPV vaccines injected at primary series 
Group 3: DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T + Hep B at birth vaccines injected at primary series  
and pooled data were defined for the purpose of analyses: 
Group 4: Group 1 + Group 3 (DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T vaccine injected at primary series with or 
without Hep B at birth) 
Results 
Diphtheria 
The applicant presented the percentages of subjects from the different groups reaching the 
predefined and established short-term and long-term protection levels after the primary series, 
booster vaccination and 2 and 3 years after the booster 
Two and 3 years after the booster the percentage of short-term protected subjects remains as high 
as after the booster vaccination in the groups vaccinated with Hexacima. Concerning the long-term 
protection in terms of subjects achieving ≥ 0.1 IU/mL the percentage falls significantly (100 
[98,6;100] to 76,6 [71,2;81,5] in pooled group 4) in the second year to remain on a still high level in 
groups 1 and 3 . Compared with the CombAct-Hib + Engerix B + OPV-group 2 there is a significant 
difference for both long-term and short-term protection levels already after the first year. Hexacima 
Hexacima 
Assessment report

shows significantly higher percentages of long-term protection levels after 2 years for both Hexacima 
groups and of short-term protection levels after 3 years for group 1 versus 2. 
Two years after the booster the absolute titres are significantly reduced in both Hexacima groups. 
Group 3 shows halved titres compared to the subjects of group 1 not at vaccinated birth against 
Hepatitis B. During the third year the titres of group 1 reach the levels of group 3 which themselves 
remain stable. The significant difference to the Hexacima groups can be seen for group 2 showing 
titres similar to post 3rd dose of the primary vaccination. 
Tetanus 
Short-term protection percentages remained unchanged for all groups up to 3 years after the 
booster. After the first year there is only a slight but significant lowering of the percentages reaching 
long-term percentages in the 90%. There are no differences for any of these parameters between the 
groups. 
In absolute titres also a profound lowering could be seen during the second year after the booster 
with only slight and not statistically significant further lowering during the third year. The titre levels 
are lower than after the 3rd primary vaccination dose but still significantly higher than pre-booster at 
least for the Hexacima groups. Titres for group 2 are significantly lower than for group 1 and 3 and 
fall to the pre-booster level two years after the booster vaccination. 
Pertussis 
PT 
In terms of percentage of subjects from the different groups reaching the different descriptive 
relations to the LLOQ (2 EU/ml) against PT, all subjects, irrespective of vaccine used showed the 
same percentages two years after the booster as one year after the primary vaccination (pre-
booster). During the third year a further lowering of percentages was observed across the relations. 
As there is no established threshold of protection for pertussis antigens the clinical impact was 
considered unclear. Overall, significantly lower percentages across the relations for study subjects of 
group 3 (Hepatitis B at birth) versus both other groups. 
In absolute titres this differences and similarities are also seen but less pronounced and often not 
even statistically significant. Statistical significance was only seen between the two Hexacima groups 
with lower titres in group 3. 
FHA 
In terms of percentage of subjects from the different groups reaching the different descriptive 
relations to the LLOQ (2 EU/ml) against FHA, for the subjects in the two Hexacima groups 
percentages across the relations remain stable up to year 3 after the booster. Subjects in group 2 
show a lowering in percentage starting during the first year after the booster but also remain 
relatively high. A significant difference to both Hexacima groups can be seen, which may lie in the 
use of a whole-cell Pertussis vaccine. As there is no established threshold of protection for pertussis 
antigens the clinical impact was considered unclear. 
In absolute titres this differences and similarities are also seen. But the significantly lower titres in 
group 2 are present from the start after the 3rd dose of primary series.

Haemophilus influenzae b 
In view of subjects from the different groups reaching the predefined and established short-term and 
long-term protection levels after the primary series, booster vaccination and 2 and 3 years after the 
booster for the Haemophilus influenza antigen PRP, there were no significant differences between the 
groups. Protection percentages remain stable for up to 3 years after the booster. 
Regarding absolute titres there is a significant lowering of the titres during the second year post 
booster across all groups. During the third year titres remain stable across groups at the level seen 
after completion of the primary vaccination series. There are also no differences between the 
vaccination groups. 
Hepatitis B 
After primary immunization with hepatitis B vaccine, anti-HepB concentrations decline rapidly within 
the first year and more slowly thereafter. However, after a booster dose an anamnestic increase in 
HepB antibody-titres (V08) has been found. The results are summarized in the table below:

As shown in the table, 73.3% of subjects were seroprotected against hepatitis B 3 years after 
Hexacima booster administration (Group 1) versus 68.5% in the control group (Group 2) who did not 
receive a hepatitis B booster and who had a significantly lower post-priming GMT.  
The following observations were made when comparing Hexacima (group 1) with Engerix B (group 
2): 
At 3.5 and 4.5 years of age similar rates of seroprotection and similar GMTs were found when 
comparing group 1 (Hexacima, priming + booster) and group 2 (priming with Engerix B). However, 
percentages of children with anti-HepB titer ≥10 mIU/mL pre-booster were significantly higher in the 
Engerix B group compared with the Hexacima group (92.0 % vs. 78. 9 %, respectively). And even if 
the Engerix B group (group 2) in contrast to the Hexacima-group did not receive a booster dose, two 
years after the priming (V01) the two groups had similar seroprotection rates as shown above. 
Influence of a HepB dose at birth:  
At 3.5 (2 years post booster) and 4.5 years of age (3 years post booster) high percentages of 
children primed with Hexacima (group 1 without- and group 3 with- HepB at birth) are still 
seroprotected. The first dose administered at birth had a clear effect on the GMTs (e.g. 296 vs. 1835 
at Day 126) and higher peak anti-HBs concentrations are associated with longer persistence of anti-
HBs concentrations ≥10 mIU/ml.  
Conclusion regarding hepatitis B:  
The completion of a 3-dose primary series and a booster in the toddler age (with or without hepatitis 
B at birth) induced a strong antibody response similar to Engerix B without a booster.  
As the GMTs are very high in group 3 it is justifiable to mention in the SmPC (4.2): “When hepatitis B 
vaccine is given at birth, after a 3-doses primary vaccination, Hexacima or a pentavalent DTaP-
IPV/Hib vaccine can be administered for the booster.” 
Summary of Main Efficacy Results 
The established correlates and surrogates have been reached with Hexacima regardless of 
vaccination scheme, concomitantly used vaccines, or vaccine used for priming. The end of shelf-life 
did not lead to significant differences in the immunogenicity of Hexacima. Batch-to-Batch consistency 
was adequately shown in two different studies. The majority of the clinical studies were made using 
the same formulation and scale of Hexacima. 
Differences between GMTs beyond those thresholds were originally been found between Hexacima 
and the used control vaccines or if priming/booster had been done with other vaccines: 
• 
The EPI scheme with vaccinations at 6, 10, 14 weeks (A3L15ps) showed significantly higher 
GMTs for anti-D. After the booster with Hexacima (A3L15bo) anti-T and anti-PRP were 
significantly lower than for the children primed with CombActHib. Lower pre-boost 
seroprotection rates regarding HepB at month 15-18 for Hexacima compared to Engerix (78.9 
vs. 92.0%, respectively) were shown. 
•  Condensed primary vaccination scheme with 2, 3 4 months (A3L10) showed significantly 
higher GMTs for FHA than Pentaxim vaccinated infants. After the booster with Hexacima 
(A3L22) GMTs for anti-D, anti-T and anti-PT were significantly lower, anti-PRP somewhat 
Hexacima

lower with overlapping CIs. Pre-booster GMTs for HepB were higher in the group primed with 
Pentaxim +Engerix than in the group primed with Hexacima and the percentage of subjects 
with seroprotection was only 80.7% for the Hexacima group versus 99% for the Engerix 
group. Especially, if no booster would follow in the second year of live, this could have an 
influence on the duration of protection. However, independent from the priming (Pentaxim 
plus Engerix or with Hexacima) following booster vaccination with Hexacima both groups 
showed a considerable anamnestic response. 
• 
The vaccination scheme 2, 4, 6 months has been evaluated in several studies using different 
comparators or Hexacima only for priming: 
•  Comparator Pentaxim+ Engerix: 
o 
o 
significantly lower PT GMTs in the Hexacima group versus Pentaxim (A3L02) with 
significantly lower GMT ratios for anti-T, anti PRP and anti-FHA after boostering with 
Pentaxim (A3L16), anti-D was somewhat lower with overlapping CIs.  
Lower pre-boost GMTs in study A3L16 regarding HepB in the Hexacima group 
compared to the Engerix group (85.5 vs. 99.5%, respectively) 
•  Comparator Infanrix hexa: 
o 
o 
significantly higher GMTs for anti-FHA and anti-PRP in the Hexacima groups (A3L11 
and A3L12) 
significantly lower GMTs for anti-T and anti-PT in the Hexacima group (A3L12). 
o  Seroprotection rate for Hepatitis B based on the ≥100 mIU/ml threshold criterion one 
month after the third dose is higher in the Infanrix hexa group (99.2%) compared to 
the Hexacima group (91.7%). Likewise, anti-HepB GMTs were higher in the Infanrix 
hexa group compared to the Hexacima group (ITT: 1576 vs. 1142, respectively) 
(A3L11). Moreover, lower HepB-GMTs and lower rate of seroprotection at month 15 
to 18 (pre-boost) were observed. However, following booster vaccination 
seroprotection rates against HepB were sufficiently high and comparable between the 
two groups (A3L21). 
o  Although in the majority of studies lower anti Poliovirus-GMTs were measured in the 
Hexacima groups compared to the control vaccines given, this is not indicative for 
inferior clinical performance. GMTs exceeded by far the threshold of ≥ 8 (1/dil). 
Consequently, these differences are clinically not relevant. 
•  Comparator Tritanrix: 
o  Following vaccination with Tritanrix threefold higher anti HepB-GMTs were found 
compared to Hexacima (3364 vs. 1075, respectively). However, based on the anti-
HBs thresholds of 10 and 100 mIU/ml, sufficiently high seroprotection rates in both 
groups one month after the third vaccination were measured (A3L04). 
All other studies that described GMTs showed similar immune responses for Hexacima and its 
comparator. Also, the clinical relevance of the differing results described above is estimated only to 
possibly affect the timing for next booster vaccinations. The applicant was asked to explain the 
significantly differing results and their possible effect on the timing of consecutive booster 
vaccinations. In response to this request it was seen that the unusual differences of GMTs seen in 
Hexacima 
Assessment report

Page 94/126 
 
 
 
  
some studies cannot be attributed to intrinsic or extrinsic factors. As also no trend is seen, the clinical 
relevance is judged negligible. The data provided by the applicant from study A3L26 seem conclusive 
in terms of comparability of the antibody responses with comparator vaccines. It can be assumed 
that duration of protection and following booster intervals will be similar across the studies.  
In conclusion a full set of three primary vaccinations plus a booster dose are needed to achieve 
reliable protection. 
The final data of the planned study A3L28 should be supplied as soon as possible and will show the 
persistence of antibodies three years after the booster dose.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
A pooled analysis is provided for the 2, 4, 6 months using studies in Latin America without hepB at 
birth (A3L02, A3L04, A3L11 and A3L17): 
• 
For the Pertussis antigens PT and FHA 96% and 97% respectively have reached a ≥4 fold 
increase  
•  100% achieved a short-term, 99.5% a long-term protection against Tetanus 
•  97,1% achieved a short-term, 62.6% a long-term protection against Diphtheria 
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013 
Page 103/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
•  98% achieved a short-term, 90.2% a long-term protection against Haemophilus influenza b 
after primary vaccination. 
•  99.9-100% reached seroprotection against Polio types 1, 2 and 3 
•  98.8% achieved seroprotection (≥10mIU/ml) against HepB (regarding a threshold of 
≥100mIU/ml 93.0 % were seroprotected) 
These results are satisfactory taking into account that normally the booster vaccination follows well 
before the long-term protection time-span (usually 5-10 years) for anti-D will be of importance. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Specific studies were not carried out. Premature infants were only included if they had ≥2000g at 
birth. Immunocompromised infants were excluded from studies. 
Of Hispanic origin were 69% of included subjects. However, Caucasian, Asian and Black participants 
have been enrolled as well. For a detailed justification of the applicability of the available study data 
to the European population see the section on discussion on clinical efficacy below. 
Furthermore, the applicant committed to carry out additional studies in immune compromised infants 
in the EU. These studies will be followed up in the Risk Management Plan (see further below). 
Supportive studies 
Further supportive studies are not available. 
2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Applicability of the data package to the European population 
The European “Reflection Paper on the Extrapolation of Results from Clinical Studies conducted 
outside the EU-Population”2 states theoretical hurdles that might influence the applicability of data 
derived in studies in foreign countries to the EU situation by citing the ICH E5:  
2 EMEA/CHMP/EWP/692702/2008 
Hexacima

Figure 3: 
Concerning the current clinical data package all of these factors have been weighted: 
All extrinsic factors given in the scheme can be neglected and the studies themselves have been 
shown through GCP inspections and the general conduct discussed with each study to have the same 
standard as usually seen and accepted in the EU. 
The same is true for the physiological and pathological conditions (age, organ functions and 
diseases). Only healthy infants and toddlers were vaccinated, no immune-compromised or otherwise 
chronically ill children were included. 
Concerning the genetic branch of intrinsic factors there are differences between the populations 
studied and the EU-population. It also has been mentioned in the article 58 procedure that the 
majority of studies were conducted in South and Latin America. Nevertheless, the main study data 
including titres and safety results were easily comparable between the different ethnicities and it is 
expected that, thus, they are applicable to the Caucasian which is prevalent in the EU, too. Also, 
comparators used in the studies are also in use in the EU and even whole-cell Pertussis vaccine, oral 
Polio vaccine or a birth-dose of BCG is used in some EU countries. Also, even if not all vaccination 
schemes used in the EU might be present in the clinical package this shortcoming will be addressed in 
post-licensure studies. Thus, taking all these factors into account, the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
data presented by the applicant are as applicable to the EU population as they were for the global 
scientific opinion of the article 58 procedure. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The overall ethics, conduct, and design of the studies are satisfactory. During the clinical 
development all major primary vaccination schemes have been tested. Also, the major ethnicities 
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013 
Page 105/126 
 
 
 
  
have been subject to the trials, even though a strong focus lies on South and Central America. The 
studies were conducted on all continents with the exemption of Australia and took place with a wide 
range of locally used comparators and prior vaccinations (BCG and/or HepB at birth).  
Concerning this overall approach the clinical development programme follows the recommendations 
laid down in the WHO “Guidelines on clinical evaluation of vaccines: regulatory expectations” and the 
EMA “Guideline on clinical evaluation of new vaccines”. 
Nevertheless, there are some points not covered in the studies: 
• 
Immunogenicity of immunosuppressed individuals 
•  No concomitant use study for other relevant childhood vaccines (e.g. mono- or polyvalent 
conjugated meningococcal vaccines) 
These shortcomings should be bared in mind considering other observations made in the healthy 
infants studied. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The specific WHO guidance given in the weekly epidemiological records (WER) was taken into 
consideration, and the conclusions are summarised below by antigen: 
Antigens contained in Hexacima: 
•  Tetanus: 
Immunological protective threshold has been shown as required using validated assays. 
Primary vaccinations follows the recommended age, the timing of the booster is given as between 4-
7 years in the recommendations. This is not adhered to in the trials that rather use a booster at the 
age of 2 years irrespective of the primary schedule used. Despite the lower than expected GMTs seen 
in some of the booster trials there does not seem to be a necessity for a second booster prior to the 
then recommended 12-15years by the WHO. The data from study A3L26 will help to estimate further 
booster timing and should be supplied as soon as available.  
•  Diphtheria: 
Immunological protective threshold has been shown as required using validated assays. 
Here primary as well as booster recommendations of the WHO are fully covered in the tested 
schedules. A further booster is advised for the age of 4-7 years. Given the fact that long-term 
protection thresholds were achieved in all studies after the booster dose the significantly lower GMTs 
seen in the condensed schedule study are not considered clinically relevant when taking into account 
that the next booster for this population should be given within the next 5 years according to the 
recommendations. 
•  Hib  
Immunological protective threshold has been shown as required using validated assays. 
Here primary as well as booster recommendations of the WHO are fully covered in the tested 
schedules. The necessity of further boosters or the duration of protection is not specifically discussed 
as the vulnerability against the disease wanes rapidly beyond the second year of life. 
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013 
Page 106/126 
 
 
  
The significantly lower GMTs seen in some of the studies might be due to formulation especially in 
comparison with the used comparator vaccines (CombActHib, Pentaxim and Infanrix hexa) are not 
expected to give reason for clinical concern as the protective thresholds were achieved in all cases.  
•  Pertussis  
The WHO reports that although 3- and 4-component acellular Pertussis vaccines might have hinted a 
higher protection in clinical studies, one- and two-component acellular Pertussis vaccines have shown 
the same high-level protection against disease in the long-term large-scale use. This is important as 
so far no accepted correlate of protection (and thus, antibody titre threshold) exists.  
The primary and booster vaccination timing recommendation (3 doses within first year of life and 
booster in the second year) are covered in the studies provided here. Further boosters are so far not 
considered necessary before adulthood (to provide protection of vulnerable persons, e.g. new-borns 
or in special settings, e.g. care-givers). 
Taking all this into account the clinical relevance of significantly lower GMTs for the FHA-component 
seen in some studies is unknown but not expected to be of concern. 
It is acknowledged that the acellular Pertussis vaccines provide a lower protection than whole-cell 
formulations and need at least 2 doses to be protective. According to the WHO no data suggest that 
switching between wP- and aP-containing vaccines negatively affects protection rates. 
•  Polio 
According to the WHO position paper a primary series of 3 doses IPV should be administered 
beginning at 2 months of age. In case the primary series starts earlier (for example when following a 
6-week, 10-week and 14-week schedule as in study A3L15) a booster dose should be administered 
after an interval of ≥6 months.  
In all studies sufficiently high GMTs (between 100 and 4100) as well as sufficiently high 
seroprotection rates (94.7%-100%) have been observed for all 3 poliovirus types following 
completion of the primary series consisting of three doses. In two studies (A3L15 and A3L02) it was 
demonstrated that following administration of Hexacima anti-Poliovirus titres relevant for 
seroprotection were non-inferior compared to the control vaccines (Tritanrix HepB/Hib +OPV or 
Pentaxim + Engerix B). The other studies provided descriptive analyses only. Although in the 
majority of studies lower GMTs were observed in the Hexacima groups compared to the control 
vaccines, this is not indicative for clinical inferiority. Routinely, GMTs by far exceeded the threshold of 
≥ 8 (1/dil).  
The vaccination schedule for Hexacima foresees a 4th dose in the second year of life. For all booster 
studies descriptive analyses of the polio immune response have been provided. GMTs were still 
sufficiently high at the beginning of the second year of life and further increased following booster 
vaccination with Hexacima. Pre-boost seroprotection rates for all three poliovirus types were between 
85% and 100%. Following booster vaccination with Hexacima 100% of subjects were seroprotected 
indicating effective priming. 
•  Hepatitis B 
In all studies the amount of HepB antigen used in the various vaccines was identical (10µg). 
Development of an anti-HBs response exceeding 10 mIU/ml is generally accepted as a correlate for 
protective immunity against hepatitis B.  Such levels of protective immunity have been observed in 
all clinical trials conducted with Hexacima following the primary series (seroprotection rates between 
94.0 and 100%).  
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013

Although children born to HepB infected mothers have been excluded from all clinical trials the effect 
of a HepB vaccine administered directly after birth has been evaluated (A3L15, A3L04 andA3L12). In 
these studies a positive effect of a HepB dose given at birth has been demonstrated. 
Starting with the primary vaccination series at an age of 6 to 8 weeks, it has been demonstrated that 
less condensed schedules (month 2-4-6; in studies: A3L02, A3L04, A3L11, A3L12 and A3L17) 
resulted in increased anti-HBs titer compared to the more condensed schedules (1.5-2.5-3.5 month; 
in studies A3L15 and A3L10). However, seroprotection was sufficient in all studies. 
Comparing different HepB vaccines (Engerix, Tritanrix or Infanrix hexa or Hexacima) in various 
studies (A3L10, A3L04, A3L011 and A3L017) higher GMTs have been measured for these vaccines 
compared to the Hexacima groups. Moreover, these studies demonstrated that for the more 
conservative threshold for protection ( ≥ 100mIU/ml), higher seroprotection rates were generated by 
the comparator vaccines than with Hexacima. Since it is known that higher anti-HBs concentrations 
will take longer to decline below the minimum protective threshold value of ≤ 10mIU/ml lower GMTs 
could potentially be interpreted as a signal for reduced persistence of protection. This should be 
followed carefully on a long-term basis. One study (A3L26) is already addressing this aspect.  
The Applicant further committed to perform one other long-term-protection study in children 3.5 or 
4.5 years of age (A3L28). 
Of note, the vaccination schedule of Hexacima foresees a fourth dose in the second year of life.  In all 
booster studies (A3L15, A3L22, A3L16 and A3L21) lower pre-boost GMTs and lower seroprotection 
rates have been found for Hexacima when compared to Engerix or Infanrix hexa- has been used for 
primary vaccination.  
In one arm of study A3L15 (group 2, primed with Engerix B) no Hep B booster dose has been 
administered. At months 15 to 19, the Engerix group still had a seroprotection rate of 92% 
(threshold: ≥10IU/ml), which was significantly higher than after priming with Hexacima (78.9%).  
Following booster vaccination with Hexacima (4th dose), which has been used for all groups in all 
booster studies (apart from study A3L01 where Hexavac has been administered in a control group), a 
robust anamnestic antibody response resulting in high anti-HBs titer concentrations (ranging from 
1379 to 44893) were measured one month later.  This effective response was observed in all groups 
of healthy vaccinees and confirms the presence of a functional immunologic memory. 
Considering the available data in the literature, the persistence of anti-HBsAg antibodies may 
possibly not be the most appropriate surrogate of long-term protection since the immunological 
memory persists beyond the detection of antibodies.  
It was discussed why antibody concentrations in study A3L15 (South Africa) declined more rapidly in 
the Hexacima than in the control group who received Engerix B in combination with CombAct, Hib 
and OPV (GMTs: Group 1 from 330 to 51.3 and Group 2 from 148 to 103).  
The Applicant committed to perform an additional study A3L28 as a follow-up of the confirmatory 
study A3L24 (Hexacima vs. Infanrix hexa) to document persistence of anti-HBsAg antibody among 
children 3.5 and 4.5 years old.  
In view of the emerging views that protection against hepatitis B breakthrough infection appears to 
be dependent on immune memory rather than on anti-HBsAg antibody concentrations there is no 
reason to believe that subjects in Group 1 are less likely to be protected over time than Group 2 or 
Group 3 since the post-priming seroprotection rates are very comparable across the three groups. 
However, the phenomenon of more rapidly waning antibody concentrations in Group 1 when 
compared to Group 2 (Study A3L15) remains difficult to understand. The outcome of study A3L24 
(3+1 dose schedule) demonstrated non-inferiority of the immune response to Hexacima versus 
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013 
Page 108/126 
 
  
Infanrix Hexa. This is demonstrated for seroprotection and seroconversion levels as well as for GMT-
thresholds of short- and long-term protection for all antigens including HepB of the hexavalent 
vaccines. Further data from study A3L28 are awaited.  
The Applicant endorsed the need of a booster in the second year of live, and the SmPC was updated 
accordingly. 
Although priming with Engerix B might lead to higher Antibody titres  than  priming with Hexacima, it 
is assumed that due to immune memory even if anti-HBs concentrations decline to <10 mIU/ml, 
nearly all vaccinated persons are still seroprotected against hepatitis B infection. However, for the 
time being only studies with the 3+1 schedule are available. To approve other vaccination schedules 
appropriate data should be available. 
As the GMTs after 3 priming doses plus a Hep B dose at birth are very high (group 3) and as 
proposed by the WHO, it is justifiable to abstain from a Hep B booster in the second year of live if a 
first dose of Hep B had been given at birth already. 
•  Persistence of antibody responses 
The Applicant submitted data from the cohort population aged 4.5 years from study A3L26, which is 
the follow-up of study A3L15. Persistence of antibodies following that study was shown in study 
A3L26. 
Seroprotection against Diphtheria, Tetanus and Hib remained stable for 3 years after the booster 
vaccination for short-term protection criteria. There was a slight but statistically significant decrease 
for the percentage of subjects with long-term protection thresholds from year 2 to year 3 for anti-T 
and anti-PRP. Long-term protection percentage for anti-D showed the decline after the booster to the 
second year but then remained stable to year 3. The percentage of subjects meeting long-term 
protection thresholds was nevertheless very high at 4.5 years of age:  
• 
• 
• 
for anti-D 71,2% pooled in both Hexacima groups (group 4) versus only 33,1% in the 
CombActHib group. There was no statistical difference between the two Hexacima groups 
for anti-T 82.8 to 89.5% across all groups (Groups 1 and 3) 
for anti-PRP 78.4 to 84.7% across all groups (Groups 1 and 3) 
In view of the so called “vaccine response” as defined in study A3L15 in terms of the percentages of 
subjects achieving 2 EU/ml titres (LLOQ), 4 EU/ml (2*LLOQ) or 8 EU/ml (4*LLOQ), there was a slight 
but statistically significant decline in these percentages for PT from the booster vaccination (100%) to 
the second year (95.9%) for LLOQ in group 1. This difference is more pronounced for 2*LLOQ (100% 
to 87.1%) and 4*LLOQ (100% to 60.6%) in the second year. After the additional year there is a 
further decline below the levels seen pre-booster. There are also significantly lower percentages in 
the Hexacima group vaccinated with HepB at birth (group 3) compared to group 1.  The clinical 
relevance of this observation is not known as there are no established thresholds for protection. For 
FHA there was neither a decline in percentages in any of the LLOQ nor a statistical difference in those 
percentages between the Hexacima groups. 
Percentages of children with anti-HepB titer ≥ 10 mIU/mL pre-booster were significantly higher in the 
Engerix B group compared with the Hexacima group (92.0 % vs. 78. 9 %, respectively). And even if 
group 2 (primed with Engerix B) did not receive a booster dose, at an age of 3.5 years the children of 
the two groups had similar seroprotection rates (V01: 76.3% vs. 72.7%).  
Antibody titres for all antigens showed a significant decline during the first two years after the 
booster vaccination and remained stable for the following year.  
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013 
Page 109/126 
 
  
In conclusion it can be said that the kinetic profiles of all antibodies in Hexacima are similar to that of 
comparable vaccines. The statistically significant differences seen between the two Hexacima groups 
are judged negligible as at least the protective thresholds are met at all times by a satisfying number 
of subjects. 
Antibody titres originating from Hexacima often remained however significantly higher than for the 
comparator vaccine as already seen in study A3L15.  So far there is no reason for concern from this 
data. 
Responses to antigens of concomitant vaccines 
•  Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines: 
Given the data in study A3L24 in regard to the effect of concomitant use on the serotypes of 
Prevenar 7 a concomitant use can now be recommended. Also, as further studies are planned with 
the newer pneumococcal vaccines in the EU (A3L38, A3L39 and A3L40) those data should be taken 
into account when available as well.  
•  MMRV 
Routine immunizations with MMRV vaccines are usually scheduled for the second year of life. A 
second dose after a minimum interval of 1 month is standard for some national immunization 
programmes. For the time being WHO does not recommend routine varicella vaccination for 
developing countries. 
Since no comparison of a concomitant use (Hexacima plus MMR+V) versus non-concomitant 
administration (Hexacima and MMR+V given at different time points) was performed differences 
observed in the concomitant use study and historic experience regarding anti varicella protection 
rates must currently be interpreted as an immunological interference phenomenon precluding 
simultaneous administration of both vaccines at the same time. 
2.5.5.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall the clinical efficacy is estimated to be satisfactory regardless of the primary vaccination 
scheme if a booster dose is given. Minor deviations in the GMTs are not considered clinically relevant. 
All populations studied showed similar immunological data. Children at high-risk (e.g. immune 
compromised) were not studied yet. 
The applicant committed to plan and conduct a study in HIV+ or other immune-compromised 
children to generate real data in this relevant population. 
Overall the clinical efficacy was considered satisfactory regardless of the primary vaccination scheme 
if a booster dose is given. Minor deviations in the GMTs were not considered clinically relevant. 
All populations studied showed similar immunological data. 
The CHMP further recommended that concomitant use studies with mono- and polyvalent conjugated 
meningococcal vaccines should be carried out, as proposed by the applicant. 
Immunogenicity data that will address other outstanding issues on efficacy will become available in 
further studies, as outlined in the section on Risk management plan below.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Overall there were 15102doses administered in these studies: 
•  13591 doses were administered to 4661infants in the 8 primary series trials. Of them, 
4436subjects received a full 3 doses Hexacima primary series, and completed the studies. 
•  1511 doses were administered to toddlers in 4 booster studies. Of the 1511 subjects who 
received a booster dose, 1243 had been primed with Hexacima. 
Adverse events 
Hexacima has a slightly higher reactogenicity regarding solicited local and systemic events/reactions 
as compared to Pentaxim + Engerix, but it is lower in comparison with the preceding product 
Hexavac. 
There was a tendency for higher reactogenicity of Hexacima as compared to Infanrix hexa, especially 
regarding injection site reactions. In addition, a higher percentage of injection site reactions and 
pyrexia in Hexacima + Prevenar as compared to Infanrix hexa + Prevenar was observed. 
Overall, the reactogenicity profile of Hexacima was shown to be similar to, or better than, that of the 
Tritanrix-Hep B/Hib + OPV control vaccine. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Overall, within the eleven completed studies included in an integrated analysis, 205 of 3896 subjects 
(5.3%) reported a total of 247 serious adverse events following Hexacima administration. 
The most frequently reported SAEs were of infectious nature: gastroenteritis (n=51), bronchiolitis 
(n=30), bronchopneumonia (n=23), pneumonia (n=22). In addition, 13 cases of febrile convulsions 
and 1 case of convulsion, none of them considered related, were reported. SAEs occurred with a 
similar frequency in Hexacima and control groups.  
Out of 247 SAEs reported, one SAE was considered related to the administration of Hexacima.  
Subject A3L04-002-01241, a seven-week-old female subject, presented with pallor, hypotonia, 
hyporesponsiveness and dyspnoea 7 hours after first dose of Hexacima, and was diagnosed with 
hypotonic hyporesponsive episode (HHE). Event lasted 3 hours. The subject spontaneously recovered 
and was discontinued from the study. 
In addition, in study A3L24, overall, during the entire trial period, a total of 114 SAEs were reported 
in all groups together. Up to 1 month after the 3rd dose of the primary series, a total of 62 SAEs 
were reported by 50 subjects in the study, with an overall incidence of 3.9% for Hexaxim and 2.9% 
for Infanrix hexa. None was considered to be related to the study vaccines. During the 6-month 
safety follow-up of A3L24 study, a total of 47 subjects reported 51 non-fatal SAEs, with an overall 
incidence of 3.4% for Hexaxim and 3.5% for Infanrix hexa. None of these SAEs was considered to be 
related to the study vaccines. 
In study A3L26, no SAE related to Hexaxim (received during A3L15 study) was reported between 
termination from the A3L15 booster and up to 3.5 years of age.

Identified risks 
One case of HHE and 2 cases of ELS were reported after administration of Hexacima. 
Important potential risks 
Convulsions 
A total of 14 subjects experienced 2 episodes of convulsions and 13 episodes of febrile convulsions in 
the Hexacima or Hexacima + OPV groups. All cases but one were considered serious; none was 
considered related by the investigator. 
Other convulsive disorders 
Two additional subjects were diagnosed with epilepsy and West syndrome (infantile spasms), 
respectively 17 days and 59 days after vaccination. These events were not considered related by the 
investigator. 
Anaphylactic reactions 
No cases of anaphylaxis were identified, with respect to Brighton Collaboration case definition. 
Apnoea 
Two subjects presented with apnoea episodes in Hexacima arms. Of these, one subject had not yet 
received Hexacima. The second patient developed life-threatening apnoea episodes 19 days after first 
dose of Hexacima, in a context of cough and rhinitis, which may explain the occurrence of the event. 
A third subject presented with breath holding one day after the second dose of Hexacima, and was 
diagnosed with breath holding spells. Breath holding spells are considered as inappropriate psychic 
reaction to stress and pain and always have a spontaneous favourable outcome.  
No cases of apnoea were considered related by the investigator. 
Severe neurological conditions 
No case of encephalopathy was reported after vaccination with Hexacima so far. 
No cases of ADEM were reported during the clinical trial program. 
Two subjects developed encephalitis and viral meningoencephalitis respectively 53 days and 29 days 
post immunization. Although causal virus was not identified, CSF analyses, context of flavivirus 
outbreak in encephalitis case, and prompt recovery within 5 to 9 days were consistent with the 
reported or suspected viral aetiology. 
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) / Sudden Unexplained Death (SUD) 
During the clinical trials evaluating Hexacima, one African subject (A3L15-001 S0430) died at the age 
of 3 days, after receiving intradermal BCG vaccine, and before being included in a randomized arm. 
The death certificate indicated natural causes, and no autopsy was performed. 
In study A3L24 one death, assessed as not related to vaccination, was reported : a 4.5-month-old 
female died of SIDS 24 days after having received the 2nd dose of Hexacima (batch C). No other AE 
leading to study discontinuation was reported. No deaths were reported during the 6-month safety 
follow-up period of this study.  
No cases of SUD were reported after administration of Hexacima.

ALTE 
No cases of ALTE were reported after administration of Hexacima. 
Deaths 
Eleven subjects died while included in the Hexacima arms of the completed studies. None was 
considered related to the study vaccine administered. 
Laboratory findings 
Study A3L01: Phase-I Safety of a Booster Dose of Either the Investigational DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP~T 
Combined Vaccine or HEXAVAC in Healthy Argentinean 16-to 19-Month-Old Toddlers: 
At the screening visit, biological parameters were in the normal range for both groups, except for one 
subject in the Hexacima group with a low haemoglobin level (<10 g/dl) (subject 001-00009 = 8.0 
g/dl).  
At V03 (D30 to D37) post dose, six subjects had abnormal laboratory values, however, none of these 
out-of-range values was clinically significant as judged by the Investigator. Hexacima group: Two 
subjects had haemoglobin level < 10 g/dl: Subject 001-00054 had 9.4 g/dl and the other one was 
the subject with haemoglobin level <10 g/dl at screening (subject 001-00009 = 8.9 g/dl). Two other 
subjects had white blood cells counts >15,000/mm3 (subject 001-00007 = 16,000/mm3 and subject 
001-00017 = 22,000/mm3). HEXAVAC group: Two subjects had haemoglobin< 10 g/dl (subject 001-
00036 = 9.9 g/dl and subject 001-00053 = 9.6 g/dl). 
Although six subjects showed abnormal laboratory values none of these out-of-range values was 
clinically significant as judged by the Investigator. The CHMP concurs with this judgment. 
Immunological events 
No anaphylactic reaction was identified using the Brighton Collaboration case definition. 
A total of 14 subjects presented with 15 related allergic type events. Of these, 13 events were 
reported within 3 days post immunization and 2 more than 3 days post immunization (2 injection site 
rash occurred at 5 days and 11 days post immunization, respectively). All reactions were not serious 
and are detailed below. 
Nine subjects presented with injection site allergic reactions: injection site dermatitis (n=1), injection 
site pruritus (n=1), injection site rash (n=4), injection site urticaria (n=2), injection site vesicle 
(n=1). 
Five subjects experienced systemic allergic reaction: rash (n=1), rash generalized (n=1), rash 
maculopapular (3 subjects, 4 events).  
No difference was observed in the occurrence of these allergic reactions between males and females. 
Intensity for each reaction was assessed as Grade 1 for 10 reactions, Grade 2 for 2 reactions, Grade 
3 for 2 reactions and the recorded intensity was missing for 1 reaction. Duration of events varied 
from 1 to 8 days, 66% of subjects (10/15) recovered within 4 days.  
The frequency of hypersensitivity reaction was 3.6 per 1000 subjects, and 12.4 per 10,000 doses. 
Nature and intensity of hypersensitivity reactions are consistent with expected safety profile of similar 
combined vaccines.

Safety related to concomitant use 
Study A3L12: Concomitant use of Hexacima or Infanrix hexa with Prevenar 7 (Thailand): 
There was a higher rate of injection site pain in the Hexacima group (78.5% with 95% CI: 72.3; 
84.0) than in the Infanrix hexa group (65.5% with 95% CI: 58.6; 72.0) post Dose 1. Grade 2 
injection site swelling was significantly more frequent in the Hexacima group. The grade 3 reactions 
are similar in both groups for all solicited local and systemic reactions. 
Pyrexia after the first dose was more frequent in the Hexacima group (53.2% with 95% CI: 46.1; 
60.2) than in the Infanrix hexa group (33.0% with 95% CI: 26.6; 39.9). All other solicited systemic 
events occurred in the same frequency and all solicited systemic events including pyrexia showed the 
same grading in both vaccine groups. Unsolicited events were seen in both vaccine groups in similar 
frequencies. 
All 31 SAEs in the study with 412 subjects are covered in detailed and conclusive narratives. None of 
these cases are judged related to either vaccine by the applicant. The CHMP concurs with that 
judgment. 
No deaths occurred in this study up to 6 months after the last vaccination (follow-up time). No 
anaphylaxis was seen immediately (up to 30 minutes) after the vaccination. 
Case of special interest: 
There is one case of Kawasaki disease (confirmed, Subject #003-00004) after the third dose of 
Hexacima + Prevenar that is rated “unrelated to the vaccination” by the applicant. This judgement is 
shared by the CHMP. As the definite causality of Kawasaki disease is unknown but relations are often 
made up to 30 days after an infection or other immunological event the on-set time seen here - 173 
days after vaccination but only 18 days after pyrexia of unknown origin – it is highly unlikely that the 
KD can be attributed to the vaccination. The case resolved after application of IV immunoglobulin and 
did not occur again; the subject remained in the trial. 
Study A3L15 (safety of Hexacima or Hexacima + one dose of Engerix-B at birth in comparison with 
CombAct-Hib + Engerix + OPV, and concomitant use with Trimovax and Varilrix (South Africa)) 
The descriptive analysis of safety showed no important differences between the three groups.  
Notably, Hep B vaccine (Engerix B) injection at birth had no observed impact on the reactogenicity of 
Hexacima. 
In the primary series, Hexacima vaccine group showed slightly higher incidence of fever (approx. 
11% more) than did the CombAct-Hib + Engerix b + OPV control group, but it was not considered of 
significance based on the overlapping of the 95% CI and that fact that the majority of the event was 
of Grade 1. Grade 3 fever was reported in maximum of 1.7% of subjects in the primary series and 
booster phase, and lasted less than one day. The overall incidence of Grade 3 solicited reactions in 
Hexacima group was similar to or lower than the CombAct-Hib + Engerix b + OPV control group. 
Unsolicited adverse events considered related to the vaccine were reported slightly lower in Hexacima 
group than in CombAct-Hib + Engerix b + OPV control group (3.4% vs. 5.0% respectively). Of note, 
these data were collected within 7 days after each injection. 
Booster vaccination with Hexacima or CombAct-Hib + OPV control vaccine also showed overall similar 
safety and reactogenicity profiles in terms of solicited reactions, unsolicited AEs and ARs. There were 
no reports of extensive swelling of the vaccinated limb. 
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013 
Page 114/126 
 
 
  
Concomitant use with Trimovax or Varilrix at the time of booster vaccination was associated with 
similar incidences of solicited injection site reactions in Hexacima and CombAct-Hib + OPV boosted 
subjects. Concomitant use of these vaccines did not significantly increase reactogenicity of Hexacima 
and CombAct-Hib + OPV booster vaccine. These data also confirm the published finding that co-
administration of combined DTP vaccines (Hexacima, CombAct-Hib in this study) with MMRV can be 
safe. 
Safety in special populations 
Clinical studies in special populations were not performed. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Four children discontinued the prophylactic vaccination with Hexacima due to adverse events (2 AEs, 
2 SAEs). 
Post marketing experience 
No post marketing experience has been gathered, as Hexacima has not been marketed anywhere 
else. 
Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
The applicant provided safety analyses of 12 clinical studies and an integrated safety analysis 
including 11 clinical studies. Important findings were: 
•  Hexacima has a slightly higher reactogenicity regarding solicited local and systemic 
events/reactions as compared to Pentaxim + Engerix. 
• 
• 
The incidence of solicited local and systemic events/reactions was slightly higher in children 
administered Hexavac as compared to Hexacima. 
Tendency for higher reactogenicity of Hexacima as compared to Infanrix hexa, especially 
regarding injection site reactions. 
•  Higher percentage of injection site reactions and pyrexia in Hexacima + Prevenar as compared to 
Infanrix hexa + Prevenar. Further data provided by the applicant can only be taken into account 
after this procedure as the data are not final (6 month safety data still missing) and should be 
filed as a variation (see also efficacy assessment of concomitant use). 
•  One case of hypotonic hyporesponsive episode (HHE) was observed 7 hours after first dose of 
Hexacima, and two related cases of extensive limb swelling. These events have been reported for 
other childhood vaccines with a similar composition. Therefore, HHE and ELS can be considered 
as identified risks. 
It was observed that Hexacima has a slightly higher reactogenicity regarding solicited local and 
systemic events/reactions as compared to Pentaxim + Engerix, but has a lower reactogenicity in 
comparison with Hexavac. This finding suggests that the higher reactogenicity of Hexacima might not 
Hexacima 
Assessment report  
EMA/373868/2013 
Page 115/126 
 
 
 
 
 
  
be associated with the higher Al content. The applicant attributes the necessity of the doubled dose 
of aluminium as adjuvant to the good immune response to the HepB component. As the 
reactogenicity was only marginally higher versus the comparators it can be accepted but should be 
mentioned in the SmPC. 
In view of ethnicity, it was highlighted that 75.7% of the study subjects are of Hispanic, 10.6 % are 
of Black, 7.9% of Caucasian and 5.8% of Asian origin, which is no equal distribution. Furthermore, 
the only studies including Caucasian subjects were conducted in Turkey.  
The safety cohort is relatively small (<4000 subjects) so that the safety analyses performed so far 
only control for very common, common and uncommon adverse events, but not for rare and very 
rare adverse events. The CHMP acknowledges that a safety cohort of 4000 subjects is in accordance 
with the current guidelines. 
In addition, clinical studies do not cover specific populations (premature infants, 
immunocompromised individuals, subjects suffering from acute or chronic illness including cardiac or 
renal insufficiency, subjects with a history of seizures, population with genetic polymorphism has not 
been studied nor excluded). This fact was reflected in the SmPC during the procedure, in addition to 
the below standard sentences: 
“The immunogenicity of the vaccine may be reduced by immunosuppressive treatment or 
immunodeficiency. It is recommended to postpone vaccination until the end of such treatment or 
disease. Nevertheless, vaccination of subjects with chronic immunodeficiency such as HIV infection is 
recommended even if the antibody response may be limited.” 
“In chronic renal failure subjects, an impaired hepatitis B response is observed and administration of 
additional doses of hepatitis B vaccine should be considered according to the antibody level against 
hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBsAg). 
If any of the following events are known to have occurred in temporal relation to receipt of pertussis-
containing vaccine, the decision to give further doses of pertussis-containing vaccine should be 
carefully considered: 
• 
Temperature of ≥ 40°C within 48 hours not due to another identifiable cause, 
•  Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours of vaccination, 
• 
Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting ≥ 3 hours, occurring within 48 hours of vaccination, 
•  Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of vaccination.” 
Apart from immune-compromised and polymorphisms these sentences are sufficient, and the 
applicant agreed to perform a study in immunocompromised subjects (preferably HIV positive 
infants) infants to generate real data in this relevant population. 
Regarding genetic polymorphisms the following sentence was included in the SmPC under paragraph 
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use: 
“Immune responses to the vaccine have not been studied in the context of genetic polymorphism.” 
In view of non-clinical safety data the SmPC section 5.3 ‘Preclinical safety data’ reflects now that  “At 
the injection sites, chronic histological inflammatory changes were observed, that are expected to 
have a slow recovery.“  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics.    
Hexacima 
Assessment report

Two safety concerns have been identified in the integrated safety analysis: HHE and ELS. These 
events are included in the section 4.8 “adverse events” in the SmPC. The measures taken to monitor 
these events are adequate.  
The CHMP considers the measures committed in the Risk Management Plan described further below 
necessary to address issues related to safety. Therefore, the following pharmacovigilance activities 
(routine and additional) shall be performed for important identified and important potential risks: 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities: 
•  Spontaneous reports 
• 
Periodic Safety Update Reports 
•  Signal detection process  
• 
Events identified as Adverse Event of Special Interest  
Clinical trial program: 
• 
• 
planned studies in Europe and Latin America 
local studies to be conducted for registration purpose 
Post licensure safety studies required by national regulation in place and upon Health Authority 
requirement 
Regarding SIDS/SUD/ALTE an additional commitment was made: 
The Applicant is obliged to present a cumulative assessment of these events in each PSUR using 
Observed versus Expected analysis on SIDS/SUD and ALTE when possible, depending on availability 
of epidemiologic data on SIDS and ALTE in the concerned countries. 
With respect to important missing information, besides routine pharmacovigilance activities a study in 
immuno-compromised population (preferably HIV infected subjects) will be performed to generate 
new data. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
From  the  safety  database all the  adverse  reactions  reported  in  clinical trials  have  been included in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.1.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The applicability of the data provided on the European population has been discussed in the efficacy 
part of the AR and was considered acceptable. 
Despite the tendency to a higher reactogenicity of Hexacima as compared to the standard of care 
pentavalent vaccine Pentaxim + Engerix B or compared to the hexavalent vaccine Infanrix hexa, 
especially when administered with the pneumococcal vaccine Prevenar, the safety profile of Hexacima 
resembles those of other penta- or hexavalent vaccines. 
Hexacima

Two safety concerns have been identified in the integrated safety analysis: HHE and ELS. These 
events are included in the section 4.8 Adverse event in the SmPC.  
The proposed routine risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the important identified 
risks as outlined below. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  summary  of  the  pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the 
applicant fulfils the legislative requirements. 
Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 8.0, the risk management system for 
DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T (Hexacima Centralised) in the  prophylaxis of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, 
hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and invasive infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (such as 
meningitis, septicaemia, cellulitis, arthritis, epiglottitis, pneumopathy, osteomyelitis) is acceptable. 
The following points should be taken into account in the next routine update of the RMP: 
The MAH should provide the autopsy results of the SIDS case that occurred in study A3L24 with 
updated assessment of relatedness. 
Premature infants: some adverse events are possibly associated with prematurity like HHE, apnoea, 
ALTE, and SIDS. Therefore, the MAH should discuss in the RMP the pharmacovigilance plans for 
infants with prematurity. 
The MAH is asked to add data on efficacy as well as the public RMP summary, in line with the new 
pharmacovigilance legislation requirements. 
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan: 
•  Safety concerns

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed post-
authorisation pharmacovigilance development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks 
of the product. The PRAC recommends that with the next routine update of the RMP, the MAH should 
discuss in the RMP the pharmacovigilance plans for infants with prematurity. 
The PRAC also considered that routine PhV is sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk 
minimisation measures.

Anaphylaxis 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Rare: Extensive limb swelling. Large injection site reactions (>50 mm), 
including extensive limb swelling from the injection site beyond one or 
both joints, have been reported in children. These reactions start within 
24-72 hours after vaccination, may be associated with erythema, 
warmth, tenderness or pain at the injection site and resolve 
spontaneously within 3-5 days. The risk appears to be dependent on 
the number of prior doses of acellular pertussis containing vaccine, with 
a greater risk following the 4th and 5th doses. 
Anaphylaxis has been addressed in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics,  
Section 4.3: Contraindications: 
History of an anaphylactic reaction after a previous administration of 
Hexacima. 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients listed 
in section 6.1, to trace residuals (glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, 
neomycin, streptomycin and polymyxin B), to any pertussis vaccine, or 
after previous administration of Hexacima or a vaccine containing the 
same components or constituents. 
and in Section 4.4, Special warnings and precautions for use: 
Before the injection of any biological, the person responsible for 
administration must take all precautions known for the prevention of 
allergic or any other reactions. As with all injectable vaccines, 
appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily 
available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following administration of 
the vaccine. 
and in Section 4.8: Undesirable effects 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Rare : Rash 
Convulsions 
Convulsion has been addressed in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics,  
Section 4.3: Contraindications: 
Pertussis vaccine should not be administered to individuals with 
uncontrolled neurologic disorder or uncontrolled epilepsy until treatment 
for the condition has been established, the condition has stabilised and 
the benefit clearly outweighs the risk.. 
and 4.4: Special warnings and precautions for use 
If any of the following events are known to have occurred in temporal 
relation to receipt of pertussis containing vaccine, the decision to give 
further doses of pertussis-containing vaccine should be carefully 
considered:

Apnoea 
Encephalopathy/
Encephalitis 
•  Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of 
vaccination. 
A history of febrile convulsions, a family history of convulsions or 
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome do not cons titute a contraindication for 
the use of DTaP -IPV-Hep B-PRP-T. Vaccinees with a history of febrile 
convulsions should be closely followed up as such adverse e events may 
occur within 2 to 3 days post vaccination. 
And in section 4.8 Undesirable effects 
Potential adverse events (i.e. adverse events which have been reported 
with other vaccines containing one or more of the components or 
constituents of Hexacima and not directly with Hexacima): 
Nervous system disorders 
Convulsion with or without fever. 
Apnoea has been addressed in the SmPC in section 4.4. Precautions for 
use 
The potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 
48-72 h should be considered when administering the primary 
immunization series to very premature infants (born ≤ 28 weeks of 
gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of 
respiratory immaturity. As the benefit of vaccination is high in this 
group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed. 
And in section 4.8 Undesirable effects 
Potential adverse events (i.e. adverse events which have been reported 
with other vaccines containing one or more of the components or 
constituents of Hexacima and not directly with Hexacima): 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
Apnoea in very premature infants (≤ 28 weeks of gestation) (see 
section 4.4) 
Encephalopathy, encephalitis has been addressed in the SmPC in 
section 4.3. 
The vaccination with DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T is contraindicated if 
the infant has experienced an encephalopathy of unknown 
aetiology, occurring within 7 days following previous vaccination 
with pertussis containing vaccine (whole cell or acellular pertussis 
vaccines). 
In these circumstances pertussis vaccination should be discontinued and 
the vaccination course should be continued with diphtheria-tetanus, 
hepatitis B, polio and Haemophilus influenza b vaccines.

SIDS/SUD/ALTE 
As part of enhanced pharmacovigilance activities for the monitoring of 
sudden infant death (SIDS) and sudden unexplained death (SUD) 
Sanofi Pasteur plans to perform a regular analysis of these events using 
the observed to expected ratio method when possible and to provide 
the result in the PSUR or earlier in case of identified safety issue.  
Strictly speaking, this is a pharmacovigilance activity, not a risk 
minimisation measure. The planned regular Observed versus Expected

analyses enable reliable signal detection. The proposed methodology to 
perform OvE is endorsed. 
The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
In addition, the CHMP requested the following efficacy studies:

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The PDT, PTxd, FHA, PRP-T, IPV and HBsAg manufacturing process is well controlled. In-process 
controls, release and shelf life specifications indicate the high quality of the drug substance.  
The proposed formulation of Hexacima has been shown to elicit immune response above the 
predefined and accepted thresholds of protection for each antigen. The clinical data show that the 
vaccine can be used for both primary and booster vaccination regardless of vaccination scheme (EPI, 
2-3-4 or 2-4-6 months with a booster in the second year of life). The clinical data are derived from 
different developing and developed countries and cover all major ethnicities although these were not 
equally represented in the hitherto studied subjects. The Data presented here derived from studies in 
countries outside the EU are for various reasons (see section: Applicability of the data package to the 
European population) considered applicable for the EU population as well.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
There are no data with Hexacima in immunosuppressed infants yet but this population is planned to 
be studied. 
There are no data concerning premature infants with a birth weight < 2000g and subpopulations with 
genetic polymorphism. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Hexacima has a slightly higher reactogenicity as compared to standard of care products (Pentaxim + 
Engerix or Infanrix hexa). This increased reactogenicity is even more pronounced when being 
administered concomitantly with a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (such as Prevenar). The 
extent and clinical relevance of these findings will be addressed by on-going and newly planned 
studies. 
Two important risks have been identified: 
hypotonic hyporesponsive episode, and extensive limb swelling.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Concomitant use has only been tested with three other vaccines: MMRV, Rotarix and Prevenar 7 
(Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine against 7 serotypes).  
Data on concomitant administration of Hexacima with Prevenar 7 have shown no clinically relevant 
interference in the antibody response to both vaccines’ antigens. 
For other pneumococcal vaccines (e.g. Prevenar 13) additional studies are planned. The data from 
these studies should be awaited to include further information on concomitant use with these 
vaccines in the Product Information.

Data on concomitant administration with Rotarix have also shown no clinically relevant interference in 
the antibody response to the antigens covered by both vaccines. 
Regarding concomitant use of Hexacima with live attenuated varicella zoster vaccine (e.g. Varilrix), 
an immunological interference phenomenon cannot be excluded for the time being. It was therefore 
reflected in the Product Information that varicella vaccine should not be administered at the same 
time with Hexacima. 
Antibody GMTs against various antigens of Hexacima have shown to be some times inferior to that of 
the comparator vaccines although the thresholds of protection were always met. The clinical 
consequence is unknown; on-going persistence studies might show the earlier need for the next 
booster vaccination. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The primary goal of a new vaccine is to induce antibody levels above an established threshold should 
one exist. This goal has been reached for all antigens included in Hexacima. Considering the 
applicability of data derived in clinical studies conducted outside the EU the main study data including 
titres and safety results were comparable between the different ethnicities and were considered 
applicable to a Caucasian population which is prevalent in the EU, too. Comparators used in the 
studies are also in use in the EU, including whole-cell Pertussis vaccine, oral Polio vaccine or a birth-
dose of BCG, which is used in some EU countries.  
Not all vaccination schemes used in the EU have been covered by the clinical studies submitted, 
however this shortcoming will be addressed in post-licensure studies. Thus, taking all these factors 
into account, the CHMP is of the opinion that the data presented by the applicant are as applicable to 
the EU population as they were for the global scientific opinion of the Article 58 procedure (Hexaxim). 
In view of lower GMTs observed in some studies when comparing Hexacima versus comparator, the 
differences were relatively small, though in some cases statistically significant. However, as the 
inferior GMTs were still well beyond long-term protection thresholds, these findings were considered 
of minor importance as long as the primary vaccination is followed by a booster in the second year of 
life.   
Concomitant use studies have shown that there can be immunological interference between different 
vaccines. The data presented show that there is no interference for Hexacima antigens regardless of 
concomitant use with Prevenar 7, Rotarix or MMR vaccine. 
Varicella antibody titres were however diminished in the concomitant use of MMR and Varicella 
vaccines with Hexacima as well as with Infanrix Hexa. Hexacima should therefore not be used 
concomitantly with a Varicella-containing vaccine. MMR vaccines can be used concomitantly.  
Other concomitant use studies have not been performed and further studies are expected. 
Another shortcoming is the missing information about immunosuppressed and premature infants, 
however it is acceptable that such data can be generated in the post licensure phase. It is not 
expected that the immunogenicity or safety will be profoundly different from other inactivated 
vaccines containing similar antigens in this population. The applicant has already agreed to perform a 
study in immune compromised infants, which will become available.

Benefit-risk balance 
Considering favourable and unfavourable effects based on the available non-clinical and clinical data 
presented for this submission, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The only component of Hexacima which has not been used before as component of other approved 
vaccines is the hepatitis B antigen which demonstrated non-inferiority as compared to the standard of 
care in the studies provided within the scope of this dossier. Despite the fact that the reactogenicity 
of Hexacima appears to be slightly higher in comparison with Infanrix hexa, its safety profile is 
similar to the profiles of the standard of care pentavalent or hexavalent vaccines. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Hexacima for primary and booster vaccination of infants and 
toddlers from six weeks to 24 months of age against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, 
poliomyelitis and invasive diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is favourable and 
therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

New Active Substance Status 
Based  on  the  review  of  data,  the  claim  by  the  Applicant  that  the  Hepatitis  B  surface  antigen  in 
Hexacima is a new active substance is not supported. 
The Applicant has not shown that their active substance Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has a 
different amino acid sequence compared with that in already authorised medicinal products, nor has 
the Applicant demonstrated that the active substance HBsAg in Hexacima gives significantly 
different efficacy and safety characteristics. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan EMEA-001201-PIP01-11-M01 (Decision P/0082/2012) and the results 
of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as 
appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

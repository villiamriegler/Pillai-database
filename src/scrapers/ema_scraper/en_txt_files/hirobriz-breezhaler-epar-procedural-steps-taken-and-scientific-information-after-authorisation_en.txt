Update of section 4.2 of the SmPC in order to draw 
the prescriber's attention to the possibility of patients 
swallowing the capsules instead of inhaling the 
product as further risk minimisation for the risk of 
"medication error", following a request from the 
CHMP and in order to fulfil RMP 014. The format of 
the outer and immediate outer packaging was 
updated accordingly without affecting the labelling 
text. In addition section 4.5 of the SmPC has been 
updated to bring it in line with section 12 part V Risk 
minimisation measures of the RMP regarding the risk 
of less effect of “beta-adrenergic blockers”.

insert “medication error” as an important identified risk in 
the RMP and to propose further risk minimization 
measures. The MAH was also requested to revise the outer 
package so that the information “Do not swallow capsules” 
and “For inhalation use only” is emphasized e.g. by 
including a red relatively broad box around the text and by 
perhaps changing the font size. This variation led to an 
update of section 4.2 of the SmPC and the outer and 
immediate packaging accordingly. In addition section 4.5 of 
the SmPC has been updated to bring it in line with section 
12 part V Risk minimisation measures of the RMP regarding 
the risk of less effect of “beta-adrenergic blockers”.

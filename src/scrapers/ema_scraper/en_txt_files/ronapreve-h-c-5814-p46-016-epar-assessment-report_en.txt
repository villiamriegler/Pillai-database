1.   Introduction 
On 7 December 2022, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Ronapreve in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.   Scientific discussion 
2.1.   Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that R10933-10987-COV-2067 A Master Protocol Assessing the Safety, Tolerability, 
and Efficacy of Anti-Spike (S) SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibodies for the Treatment of Ambulatory 
Patients with COVID-19 is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.   Clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  
Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
•  R10933-10987-COV-2067 A Master Protocol Assessing the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of 
Anti-Spike (S) SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibodies for the Treatment of Ambulatory Patients 
with COVID-19 is a part of a clinical development program. 
COV-2067 was initiated on 16 June 2020 (first patient first visit). Results from the study have 
previously been reported.  
The present report (COV-2067 Primary Analysis CSR Addendum 3, hereinafter referred to as ‘COV-
2067 CSR Addendum 3’) describes the results of the primary analyses for Phase 3 Cohort 2 (N=206; 
<18 years of age and not pregnant at randomization). 
Due to decreased in vitro neutralization activity of casirivimab+imdevimab against the Omicron variant 
BA.1.1.529/BA.1, paediatric studies including paediatric cohorts in COV-2067 were paused in 
December 2021 and subsequently terminated in June 2022.  
2.2.2.  
Clinical study 
Methods 
Study participants 
Table 1: Summary of Study Cohorts at Randomisation 
Paediatric patients were enrolled in Phase 3 Cohort 2 (<18 years of age and not pregnant at 
randomization). One patient <18 years old pregnant at randomization was also enrolled in Phase 3 
EMA/120798/2023  
Page 3/13 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Cohort 3. Phase 3 Cohort 2 is part of the approved Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIPs) for casirivimab 
and imdevimab.  
Treatments 
Casirivimab and imdevimab drug products are supplied as 120 mg/mL solutions for intravenous (IV) 
and subcutaneous (SC) administrations. The drug products are preservative-free and non-pyrogenic. 
For IV administration, casirivimab and imdevimab must be administered together, after dilution, as a 
single IV infusion. For SC administration, casirivimab and imdevimab must be administered 
consecutively by SC injection. 
There is no specific paediatric formulation of casirivimab+imdevimab as the existing formulation 
including excipients are suitable for paediatric use. 
Participants in Phase 3 Cohort 2 were initially randomized 1:1:1 to a single IV dose of 
casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg (or body weight equivalent), casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg (or 
body weight equivalent), or placebo, with the casirivimab+imdevimab dose adjusted according to body 
weight as shown in Table 2. Placebo was discontinued per independent data monitoring committee 
(IDMC) recommendation from 24 February 2021; thus, participants were subsequently randomized 1:1 
to a single IV dose of casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg (or body weight equivalent) or 2400 mg (or 
body weight equivalent). The 2400 mg arm was later dropped with the implementation of Protocol 
Amendment 10 (approved 16 Aug 2021), after which all participants enrolling into Cohort 2 were 
assigned to the 1200 mg dose level (or body weight equivalent). 
Table 2: COV-2067: Casirivimab+Imdevimab Dose Equivalent for Patients Aged ≤18 Years 
by Body Weight Group 
Objective(s) / Outcomes / endpoints 
For all study participants, details of COVID-19-related medically-attended visits (defined as 
hospitalization, emergency room visit, urgent care visit, physician’s office visit, or telemedicine visit, 
with the primary reason for the visit being COVID-19) were collected throughout the study up to Day 
29, with collection occurring minimally on a weekly basis. 
Phase 3 participants (regardless of cohort) were followed to Day 169 (end of study) for longer-term 
safety assessment. 
Safety collection was targeted to avoid imposing significant additional burden on an already 
overstrained healthcare system during the pandemic. The targeted safety collection for participants 
<18 years of age included serious adverse events (SAEs) up to Day 169, adverse events of special 
interest (Grade > 2 hypersensitivity reactions up to Day 29, Grade > 2 infusion-related reactions up to 
Day 4, and any adverse event [AE] that led to a medically-attended visit regardless of relatedness to 
COVID-19 up to Day 29), and Grade 3 and 4 AEs up to Day 29. 
Sample size 
Enrolment in casirivimab+imdevimab paediatric studies was paused in December 2021 and 
subsequently terminated in June 2022 due to the emergence of the B.1.1.529/BA.1 SARS-CoV-2 
(Omicron) variant, against which casirivimab+imdevimab shows diminished in vitro neutralization 
potency. As a result, the agreed PIPs for casirivimab (EMEA-002964-PIP01-21-M02) and imdevimab 
EMA/120798/2023  
Page 4/13 
 
 
  
 
 
 
(EMEA-002965-PIP01-21-M02) were modified to align the required numbers of treated patients with 
the status of enrolment prior to the enrolment pause and subsequent early termination of the study. 
For COV-2067 Phase 3 Cohort 2 (PIP Study #1), the minimum number of paediatric patients evaluable 
for the primary analysis receiving weight-based doses equivalent to the 1200 mg IV adult dose levels 
was reduced from 44 patients to 35 patients. At the time enrolment to Phase 3 Cohort 2 was paused, 
the applicant had recruited more patients than required in the higher body weight groups and fewer 
than required in the lower body weight groups, with no patients below 2.5 kg.

Paediatric Body Weight Subset 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 206 non-pregnant paediatric outpatients <18 years of age with symptomatic COVID-19 and 
at least one risk factor for developing severe disease were randomized to Phase 3 Cohort 2, of whom 2 
patients (1.0%) were randomized to placebo, 129 patients (62.6%) were randomized to 
casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg, and 75 patients (36.4%) were randomized to 
casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg. The majority of patients were randomized to 
casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg due to discontinuation of the placebo arm per IDMC recommendation 
on 24 February 2021 and dropping of the 2400 mg dose level upon implementation of Protocol 
Amendment 10. 
Of the 206 randomized patients, 202 patients (98.1%) received treatment and 190 patients (90.2%) 
completed the study. Discontinuations were higher in the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg group 
(10/75 patients [13.3%]) than in the 1200 mg group (6/129 patients [4.7%]). Most discontinuations 
were either lost to follow-up or subject decision. No patient discontinued the study due to an AE. 
Results were similar regardless of whether patients were <12 or > 12 years of age. 
All 202 patients who received treatment were included in the safety analysis set (SAF): N=2 for the 
placebo group, N=129 for the 1200 mg group, and N=71 for the 2400 mg group.  
Baseline data 
In the overall Phase 3 Cohort 2 mFAS, the median age was 11 years (range 0-17 years), with 
approximately half of the patients <12 years of age (98 patients [51.0%]) and the other half > 12 
years (94 patients [49.0%]). More males (108 patients [56.3%]) were enrolled than females (84 
patients [43.8%]), and most patients (167 patients [87.0%]) were White. The majority had a body 
weight > 40 kg (129 patients [67.2%]); the remaining patients had a body weight 20 to <40 kg (48 
patients [25.0%]), 10 to <20 kg (13 patients [6.8%]), or <10 kg (2 patients [1.0%]). Most patients 
(150 patients [78.1%]) were seronegative at baseline.

Number analysed 
A total of 206 non-pregnant paediatric outpatients <18 years of age with symptomatic COVID-19 and 
at least one risk factor for developing severe disease were randomized to Phase 3 Cohort 2. Of the 206 
randomized patients, 202 patients (98.1%) received treatment and 190 patients (90.2%) completed 
the study. 
All 202 patients who received treatment were included in the safety analysis set (SAF): N=2 for the 
placebo group, N=129 for the 1200 mg group, and N=71 for the 2400 mg group. Consistent with prior 
analyses in adult participants, efficacy analyses in Phase 3 Cohort 2 focused on those patients whose 
baseline nasopharyngeal samples were RT-qPCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mFAS: N=1 for the placebo 
group, N=121 for the 1200 mg group, and N=70 for the 2400 mg group). 
Efficacy results 
Overall, for participants in the cohort 2 mFAS, >99% of whom were treated with 
casirivimab+imdevimab, key clinical assessments showed no deaths, no COVID-19-related 
hospitalizations, low rates of COVID-19-related medically attended-visits, and a median time to 
symptoms resolution of 7 or 8 days. When compared to similar assessments in 
casirivimab+imdevimab-treated adult participants in the phase 3 cohort 1 mFAS (Primary Analysis 
CSR), the results in the paediatric population were generally more favourable. 
Endpoints Evaluating COVID-19-related Hospitalization or All-cause Death 
There were no deaths in cohort 2 and no participant experienced a COVID-19-related hospitalization 
through day 29 (Phase 3 Cohort 2). 
Endpoints Evaluating COVID-19-related Medically Attended Visits (MAV) 
There were only 3 participants in cohort 2 who experienced a COVID-19-related MAV through day 29, 
2 in the 1200 mg group and 1 in the 2400 mg group. One participant in the 1200 mg group had an ER 
visit and 2 participants (one in the 1200 mg group, one in the 2400 mg group) had a physician 
office/telemedicine visit. 
Time to Resolution of Symptoms Consistent with COVID-19 
Time to COVID-19 symptoms resolution was defined for all participants who had a total symptoms raw 
score of more than 3 at baseline as the time from treatment assignment to the first day during which 
the participant scored 0 on all symptoms except fatigue, headache, and cough which could be 
mild/moderate or none. 
The median time to symptoms resolution following administration of casirivimab+imdevimab was 7 
days for the 1200 mg group and 8 days for the 2400 mg group. Results were generally consistent 
across subgroups of participants defined by baseline serologic status and viral load. 
Figure 1: Kaplan Meier Curve for Time to Resolution of Symptoms Consistent with COVID-19 
(Phase 3 Cohort 2 Paediatric Participants ≥12 years of age, mFAS)  
The curve shows a similar time course of improvement for both doses, indicative of the absence of a 
dose response.

Safety results 
Only targeted treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs [SAEs and AESIs]) were required to be 
reported in this study. TEAEs outside of the required categories were voluntarily reported for some 
participants by some sites; these events were retained in the database and are summarized in the 
overview tables. 
It is important to note that while the small number of participants in cohorts 2 and 3 who received 
placebo precludes the ability to make any meaningful comparisons between casirivimab+imdevimab 
and placebo groups for these vulnerable populations, the safety profile observed for participants 
treated with casirivimab+imdevimab in cohorts 2 and 3 is consistent with the known safety profile for 
non-pregnant, adult participants in cohort 1, with no new safety signals having been identified. 
Phase 3 Cohort 2 (<18 Years Old, not Pregnant at Randomisation) 
Summary of Adverse Events 
Targeted TEAEs required to be reported for participants in phase 3 cohort 2 included SAEs up to day 169, grade 3/4 
TEAEs up to day 29, and AESIs of grade ≥2 IRRs up to day 4, grade ≥2 hypersensitivity reactions up to day 29, and 
any TEAE that lead to a MAV (regardless of COVID-19-relatedness) up to day 29. 
For phase 3 cohort 2 participants who received at least 1 dose or part of a dose of study drug (N=202; 
all having at least 1 risk factor for severe COVID-19 per protocol), an overview of reported TEAEs, 
including TEAEs that were voluntarily reported for some participants outside of the required TEAE 
reporting. 
Consistent with the absence of any dose effect, AE categories were generally balanced across the 
casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg and 2400 mg treatment groups, with minor discrepancies, when 
observed, likely driven by the small sample size. Across all treatment groups, only 2 participants (1%) 
in cohort 2 experienced a grade ≥2 hypersensitivity reaction (1 participant in the 1200 mg group) or 
IRR through day 4 (1 participant in the 2400 mg group). Moreover, there were no TEAEs leading to 
death, withdrawal from the study, or study infusion interruption; 1 TEAE (the aforementioned 
hypersensitivity reaction in the 1200 mg group) led to study infusion discontinuation. No participant in 
phase 3 cohort 2 experienced a fatal event. 
Serious Adverse Events 
The incidence of SAEs in cohort 2 was low overall. There were a total of 4 SAEs that occurred amongst 
3 participants (1.5%), all of whom were in the 1200 mg group. 
An evaluation of SAEs reported by time to onset, up to day 29 and from day 30 until the last available 
timepoint, did not show any specific safety trends: 2 SAEs occurred up to day 29 (Metapneumovirus 
pneumonia and Urinary retention) and 2 SAEs occurred after day 29 (Suicidal ideation and Respiratory 
distress). None of the SAEs were considered related to study drug and all were confounded by the 
participant’s concurrent clinical condition/medical history.  
No participant in phase 3 cohort 2 withdrew from the study or had an infusion interruption due to a 
TEAE. However, 1 participant in the 1200 mg group experienced a TEAE that led to infusion 
discontinuation and did not receive the full dose of study drug. The participant had a grade 2 event of 
Urticaria that was considered an AESI (grade ≥2 hypersensitivity reactions). 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Throughout the study, treatment-emergent AESI (serious and nonserious) were defined as: 
• 
• 
• 
Grade ≥2 infusion-related reactions (IRRs), up to study day 4 
Grade ≥2 hypersensitivity reactions, up to study day 29 
Any TEAE that led to a MAV, up to day 29* 
*Note: After PA 7, TEAEs that led to a MAV were collected up to day 29 as AESIs to inform MAV 
narratives. Those that were considered COVID-19-related are not described in this section as they are 
primarily captured in the Efficacy section. 
One participant in the 2400 mg group experienced a grade 2 infusion-related reaction of pyrexia that 
was reported on day 1 and resolved on the next day. One participant in the 1200 mg group 
experienced a grade 2 hypersensitivity reaction that was reported on day 1 during study infusion 
prompting discontinuation of study drug; the event resolved the same day. 
EMA/120798/2023  
Page 7/13 
 
 
  
 
 
Thirteen participants (6.5%) experienced TEAEs that led to a MAV through day 29. Only 2 of these 
TEAEs were related to COVID-19. Non-COVID-19-related TEAEs that led to a MAV included 
Conjunctivitis, Crohn’s disease, Gastroenteritis, Injury, Metapneumovirus pneumonia, Otitis externa, 
Pyrexia (2 events), Sinusitis, Tonsilitis, Urinary retention, and Vomiting. All but 1 event of Pyrexia were 
considered not related to study drug. 
Grade 3 or 4 Adverse Events 
Two participants (both in the 1200 mg group) experienced a total of 3 grade 3 or 4 TEAEs up to day 
29. One participant experienced 2 grade 3 TEAEs (aminotransferase increase). Another experienced 1 
grade 4 TEAE (non-COVID-19 pneumonia). None of the TEAEs were considered related to study drug. 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluation 
Overall, no clinically meaningful trends in laboratory parameters were noted in the treatment groups. 
Findings were generally similar between dose groups with minor differences, when observed, likely 
driven by the relatively small sample sizes. For each laboratory category, the potentially clinically 
significant values (PCSVs) observed were not considered clinically significant and were considered 
related to COVID-19 disease and its associated complications in participants with multiple concurrent 
medical conditions.

Participants, SAF) 
Results Clinical Pharmacology 
Based on phase 3 Cohort 2 (age <18 years, not pregnant at randomization) 
As one result in paediatric outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19 and at least one risk factor for 
developing severe COVID-19, casirivimab and imdevimab concentrations in serum displayed linear and 
dose proportional pharmacokinetics, as expected based on the mode of action and results from PK 
observations in the adult population. Serum concentrations achieved across different body weight 
groups by selection of different body-weight equivalent doses are regarded comparable.

COV-2067, Phase 3, Cohort 2, 2400 mg Dose Group, Log-Scaled [PKAS]) 
Concentrations of casirivimab and imdevimab at end of infusion and Day 28 in pediatric participants 
were within the range of concentrations observed in Phase 3 Cohort 1 adult participants at end of 
infusion and Day 28. 
No exposure-response (change in viral load or time-weighted average change in viral load from 
baseline to Day 7) relationship was observed across different viral load categories over the dose range 
investigated was observed, as expected from previously collected data.

There was a low incidence of treatment-emergent ADA in the paediatric cohort (1/187 [0.5%]), in 
consistency with observations previously reported for non-pregnant adult participants.  The single 
participant with a positive ADA response was negative for NAb against casirivimab but positive for NAb 
against imdevimab. The casirivimab and imdevimab concentrations in this participant were not notably 
different from concentrations in patients who did not develop ADAs to casirivimab and imdevimab.

2.2.3.  
Discussion on clinical aspects 
Due to decreased in vitro neutralisation activity of casirivimab+imdevimab against the Omicron variant 
BA.1.1.529/BA.1, paediatric studies including paediatric cohorts in COV-2067 were paused in 
December 2021 and finally terminated in June 2022. The relevance and adequacy of an update of the 
product information for inclusion of paediatric patients weighing > 10 kg for treatment with 
casirivimab+imdevimab is currently hampered by epidemiological situation.  
Results from clinical pharmacology are overall in line with those observed previously in the adult 
populations. No new safety risks have been identified. 
No changes to the product information are proposed. 
3.   CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 1901/2006, the MAH submitted a completed 
paediatric study for Ronapreve. Results from clinical pharmacology were overall in line with those 
observed previously in the adult populations. No new safety risks were identified.

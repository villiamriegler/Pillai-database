The biodistribution and shedding of intralesionally 
the pharmacokinetic properties information based on

administered talimogene laherparepvec were investigated 
the final results from study 20120324, a phase 2, 
in a clinical study that measured talimogene laherparepvec 
multicenter, single-arm trial to evaluate the 
biodistribution and shedding of talimogene 
DNA in blood, urine, injection site, exterior of the occlusive 
dressings, oral mucosa, anogenital area, and suspected 
laherparepvec in subjects with unresected, stage IIIB 
herpetic lesions. Sixty patients with melanoma received 
to IVM1c melanoma. This submission fulfils MEA 
006.1. The RMP is updated accordingly (final 
consolidated version 6.0). In addition, the Marketing 
authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to 
update Annex II  as per the already assessed 
EMEA/H/C/002771/ANX/001  procedure. In addition, 
the MAH took the opportunity to update the details of 
local representatives for Ireland and Portugal in the

Imlygic intralesional injection and talimogene 
laherparepvec DNA was present in all sites during the 
study. No samples had detectable talimogene 
laherparepvec DNA 30 days after the end of treatment in 
blood, urine, oral mucosa, and anogenital area and no 
samples had detectable talimogene laherparepvec DNA 60 
days after end of treatment in injected lesions.  Overall 3 of 
19 patients with lesions of suspected herpetic origin had 
talimogene laherparepvec DNA present at any time during 
the study. No viral activity was detected in samples of the 
occlusive dressings, oral mucosa, anogenital area, and 
suspected herpetic lesions. Infectious talimogene 
laherparepvec virus was detected at the site of injection in 
7 (11%) patients at multiple time points in the study; no 
samples were positive for viral infectivity after cycle 2 or 
after the end of treatment.

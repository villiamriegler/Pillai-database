B.III.2.b - Change to comply with Ph. Eur. or with a 
recommendation for adolescents for Nuvaxovid, the MAH 
provided three clinical study reports (and annexes) for 
study 2019nCOV-301 investigating homologous booster 
doses for adolescents and adults.  
The presented dataset shows that the immune response is 
in line with the immune response previously seen in adults; 
the submitted adult data is aligned with data already 
included in the SmPC for homologous booster response. 
Therefore, since Nuvaxovid has been shown to induce a 
comparable immune response and effectiveness after the 
primary series in adolescents as in adults, and because of 
the ability to boost the vaccine-induced immune response 
was shown in adults, the CHMP is of the opinion that a 
booster response to the vaccine is equally expected in 
adolescents. Besides, the safety profile was shown to be 
largely similar to the previously observed safety profile for 
the adolescents and adult booster populations. 
Based on the above-mentioned extrapolation of 
immunogenicity of the booster dose in adult and the related 
safety profile, the CHMP agrees with the inclusion of a 
booster dose recommendation for the adolescent 
population in the section 4.2 of the SmPC. Sections 4.8 and 
5.1. are updated accordingly, with the dataset from studies 
evaluating a booster dose in both adolescents and adults’ 
populations.

Product Characteristics.

extended shelf life of the unopened vial: 
12 months at 2°C to 8°C, protected from light. 
The SmPC section 5.1 has been updated by deleting the 
text below:  
“This medicinal product has been authorised under 
a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This means that 
further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The 
European Medicines Agency will review new information on 
this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC 
will be updated as necessary.” 
The PL have been updated accordingly. 
The following two specific obligations are deleted from the 
Annex II to the Opinion: 
In order to ensure consistent product quality during 
shelf life, the MAH should provide additional information on 
stability of the finished product. 
In order to ensure consistent quality over the 
product life cycle, the MAH should adequately bridge the 
reference standards and review the finished product 
potency limits when additional data become available. 
In light of all available data, the benefit-risk balance of 
NUVAXOVID remains positive and considering fulfilment of 
all specific obligations, the Conditional Marketing 
Authorisation of Nuvaxovid can be converted to a Marketing 
Authorisation not subject to specific obligations.

The CHMP, having reviewed the available information on 
the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations and 
having confirmed the positive benefit risk balance, is of the 
opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this 
medicinal product continue to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore recommends the 
renewal of the conditional MA for NUVAXOVID, subject to 
the Specific Obligations and Conditions as laid down in 
Annex II to the opinion.

14 days. Available data suggest that the course of 
myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is not 
different from myocarditis or pericarditis in general.  
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and 
symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees

The homologous third booster recommendation is 
order to include a third dose for Nuvaxovid, to boost 
individuals who have previously completed a primary 
vaccination series with Nuvaxovid (homologous 
booster dose) or with an mRNA or adenoviral vector 
vaccine (heterologous booster dose); based on 
interim data from study 2019nCoV-101 (Part 2), final 
data from study 2019nCoV-501, and data from the 
COV-BOOST study; the Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. The RMP version 2.0 has also been 
supported by data from studies 2019nCoV-101 (Part 2) and 
2019nCoV-501; both are randomised, placebo-controlled, 
observer-blinded clinical trials. The results from study 
2019nCoV-101 (part 2) indicated an approx. 86.7-folder 
increase of neutralising antibody geometric mean titres 
(GMTs) post-boost compared to pre-boost, 28 days 
following booster vaccination. The observed titres were 
approx. 4.1-fold greater than titres reported following the 
primary vaccination series. A similar response was not

approved. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
observed in the placebo group. The results from study 
2019nCoV-501 showed that 35 days after the booster dose 
the neutralising antibody GMT were 2-fold higher than 
those measured 7 days after the primary vaccination series 
as given to the placebo-arm. Also, titres at post-booster 
dose)were higher than at post-primary series in subjects 
initially randomised to the Nuvaxovid group. This is 
suggestive of an adequate boosting response. Moreover, 
the results from 2019nCoV-501 indicated a consistent 
response in people living with HIV, albeit of a lower 
magnitude. The reactogenicity with the third booster dose 
given 6 months following the second dose was acceptable. 
With the third dose an increase in the frequency and 
severity of local and systemic reactions was observed as 
compared to the second dose although they were transient 
(median duration of 1 to 3 days following vaccination). The 
most frequent solicited adverse reactions were injection 
site tenderness, fatigue, injection site pain, muscle pain, 
malaise and headache, joint pain, and fever. No new safety 
concerns were identified. 
The heterologous booster dose recommendation is 
supported by data from the COV-BOOST study*. This was a 
randomised, controlled clinical trial where participants who 
had received two doses of either an mRNA-vaccine or an 
adenoviral vector vaccine and had no history of laboratory 
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were randomised to 
receive a booster with different a COVID-19 vaccine, 
including Nuvaxovid as a full dose (as approved in the 
SmPC) and half dose. In participants who received either a 
full or half dose, it was observed a 2.6-6.3 fold-increase of 
neutralising antibody titres 28 days after the booster 
vaccination compared to the control group (who received a 
Page 20/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
single dose of an MenACWY vaccine). This is suggestive of 
an adequate boosting response. Overall the frequency and 
severity of local and systemic reactions were similar 
between the groups that received either full or half dose of 
Nuvaxovid and control vaccine. No new safety concerns 
were identified.

Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Viread 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
On 22 July 2010 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal 
product Viread. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Gilead Sciences 
International Ltd. They may request a re-examination of the CHMP opinion, provided that they notify 
the European Medicines Agency in writing of their intention within 15 days of receipt of the opinion. 
The CHMP adopted a new indication as follows: 
“decompensated liver disease (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1)”. 
Detailed conditions for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after the variation to the 
marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
For information, the full indications for Viread will be as follows2: 
Viread is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of 
HIV-1 infected adults over 18 years of age. 
The demonstration of benefit of Viread in HIV-1 infection is based on results of one study in 
treatment-naïve patients, including patients with a high viral load (> 100,000 copies/ml) and studies in 
which Viread was added to stable background therapy (mainly tritherapy) in antiretroviral pre-treated 
patients experiencing early virological failure (< 10,000 copies/ml, with the majority of patients having 
< 5,000 copies/ml). 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the commission decision, which will normally be issued 
within 44 days (Type II variations) and 67 days (Annex II applications) from adoption of the opinion. 
2 The text in bold represents the new or the amended indication.

The choice of Viread to treat antiretroviral experienced patients with HIV-1 infection should be based 
on individual viral resistance testing and/or treatment history of patients.

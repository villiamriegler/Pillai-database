SmPC, Annex 
II and PL 
Lamivudine Teva PI is being updated to reflect 
changes introduced during Zeffix renewal. The MAH 
also takes this opportunity to correct the text in 
sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC and section 1, 2 
and 3 of the PL of Lamivudine Teva to bring it in line 
with the reference. These additional changes have 
been highlighted in yellow in the present & proposed 
table for better clarification. 
Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.6 and 5.1 of the SmPC were 
updated as a response to the commitments made by 
the MAH as part of Zeffix licence renewal. The PL 
was revised accordingly. 
Major changes affected section 4.1 and 4.2 in light of 
the emergence of new data, which have questioned 
the appropriateness of lamivudine as first line 
therapy for CHB due to its high risk of resistance. As 
a consequence the indication was restricted and the 
availability of other antiviral agents with a better 
resistance profile highlighted. The need for 
combination therapy in patients with decompensated 
liver disease was also introduced. Section 4.6 was 
updated to reflect the complexity of the benefit/risk 
assessment of lamivudine treatment in breast 
feeding mothers. 
Section 5.1 was updated to include new data on the 
frequency of meergence of YMDD variant HBV and its 
impact on the treatment response. Minor changes 
affected section 4.4 and 4.5.

Furthermore the complete indication concerning 
decompensated liver disease was removed from the 
PI for Lamivudine Teva 
The MAH requested to update sections 4.4 of the 
SmPC to improve clarity around the current text on 
exacerbation of hepatitis, inline with other nucleoside 
agents for CHB, and section 4.8 has been updated 
with regards to the frequency category of ADR based 
on the SmPC Guideline rev.2 in accordance with the 
originator. The PL has been revised accordingly. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC has been amended to 
improve clarity around the text on exacerbation of 
hepatitis, in line with other nucleoside agents for 
CHB. The approved text

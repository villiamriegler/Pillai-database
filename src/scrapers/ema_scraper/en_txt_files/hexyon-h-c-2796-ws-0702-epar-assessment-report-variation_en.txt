4.2.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
4.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Design: open-label, randomised, multi-centre study conducted in Finland between 29 April 2013 (FVFS) 
and 26 November 2013 (LVLS). During the study, 350 subjects, 46 to 74 days of age, born at full term of 
pregnancy (≥37 weeks) and/or with a birth weight ≥2.5 kg were randomised in a ratio 1:1 to receive 
Hexyon co-administered with MenC vaccine (Group 1) or Hexyon without MenC vaccine (Group 2). Both 
groups received routine vaccination with RotaTeq and Prevenar 13 (see Table 1). 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were state-of-the-art (for details, refer to HXM01C clinical study report). 
Test vaccines:  
•  Hexyon: Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (acellular, component), hepatitis B (rDNA), poliomyelitis 
(inactivated) and Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine (adsorbed), suspension for 
injection in a pre-filled syringe, 1 dose (0.5mL), intramuscular route 
•  MenC vaccine: Meningococcal Group C polysaccharide conjugate vaccine to tetanus toxoid 
(NeisVac-C; Baxter), suspension for injection, 1 dose (0.5mL), intramuscular route 
Routine vaccines:

RotaTeq was administered orally, the other vaccines were administered intramuscularly in the left 
(Hexyon) and right thigh (NeisVac-C and Prevenar 13). The two injections sites at the right thigh had to 
be separated by at least 5 cm.  
Depending on study group, two to three blood samples (BS) of approximately 3 to 5 mL were collected 
from the subjects. Blood sampling was always performed before vaccination. The use of anaesthetic 
products was allowed for blood sampling (i.e. as prophylaxis against pain) if not contraindicated for the 
subject.  
Serology tests for Hexyon antigens were performed by laboratory staff that was blinded for the group 
allocation. 
Subjects were kept under observation at the investigators' sites for 30 minutes after each vaccination and 
any immediate adverse event had to be recorded. 
For safety follow-up, the subjects' parents or legal representatives received a Diary Card (DC) at visit 1 to 
visit 3 and were informed on how to complete it. On the DC, the subjects' body temperature, the injection 
site and systemic reactions and unsolicited adverse events were to be recorded. 
All serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events assessed as related to the study vaccine were 
to be followed up by the investigators until their complete resolution or stabilization. 
Each subject was followed up for a period of about 3 to 4 months. 
(Co-)Primary objectives: 
• 
• 
To demonstrate that the concomitant administration of Hexyon given at 2, 3 and 4 MoA with a 
MenC vaccine given at 2 and 4 MoA is non-inferior to the administration of Hexyon without a MenC 
vaccine concomitantly in terms of seroprotection rate for hepatitis B (HepB) 1 month after the 
third Hexyon dose. 
To demonstrate that the concomitant administration of a MenC vaccine given at 2 and 4 MoA with 
Hexyon given at 2, 3 and 4 MoA induces an acceptable response for MenC in terms of 
seroprotection rate 1 month after the second dose of MenC vaccine.

Statistical analysis: 
The hypothesis for the first primary objective was that Hexyon administered concomitantly with the MenC 
vaccine (group 1) is non-inferior to Hexyon administered without MenC (group 2) in terms of HepB 
seroprotection rate (SPR; proportion of subjects with an anti-HepB concentration ≥10 mIU/mL) at 1 
month post-dose 3. 
•  Non-inferiority was demonstrated if the two-sided 95% CI around the difference in SPR (group 1 
– group 2) excluded a decrease of 10% or more (i.e. if the lower bound of the CI was greater than 
-10%). 
The hypothesis for the second primary objective was that the SPR to MenC vaccine (proportion of subjects 
with an anti-MenC titer ≥8 [1/dil]) when administered concomitantly with Hexyon (group 1) was 
acceptable at 1 month post-dose 2. 
• 
The seroprotection rate to MenC was considered acceptable if the lower bound of its two-sided 
95% confidence interval (CI) was >90%. 
Success for the study required that both primary objectives were achieved. 
The choice of the acceptability margin and the non-inferiority margin was driven by the clinical relevance, 
the expected seroprotection rates/vaccine response rate, and the desired accuracy of the conclusions of 
the study. With 140 evaluable subjects in both groups (as per sample size assumptions) and assuming an 
anti-HepB SPR of 95% in the Hexyon group (as achieved in study A3L10 performed in Turkey), the largest 
observable difference in SPR which would lead to rejecting the null hypothesis of non-inferiority was 3.6% 
corresponding to an SPR of 91.4% in group 1 (Hexyon plus MenC).  
With 140 evaluable subjects in each group for the primary analysis, assuming no difference between 
groups for the anti-HBs seroprotection rate and using a one-sided 2.5% type one error rate, the power of 
the study according to the expected response rates and the non-inferiority margin or acceptability 
thresholds were calculated as follows:

~90.4% 
Assuming independence of the primary hypotheses, the overall power of the study was around 90% for 
the success of the primary objectives with 350 randomised subjects. 
The immunogenicity analyses (primary and secondary objectives) were performed on the Per Protocol Set 
(PPS), defined as all randomized subjects excluding those with protocol violations (= main analysis). The 
analyses were repeated on the Full Analysis Set (FAS), defined as all randomized subjects who received 
at least one dose of the study vaccine(s) and with any post-vaccination immunogenicity evaluation (= 
supportive analysis).  
With regards to the assays used for immunogenicity assessment, the endpoints analysed, and the timing 
of the serology assessment (i.e. 1 month [28 to 42 days] post-dose 3), the parameter were consistent 
with those used during the clinical development of Hexyon. Well-established seroprotection levels for 
diphtheria, tetanus, poliovirus, HepB and Hib were used to assess the immune responses to Hexyon 
(Table 5). 
For pertussis antigens, for which no established correlates of protection are available, accepted 
surrogates of protection were applied (i.e., vaccine response rates). 
The functional assay used for the MenC immunogenicity (rSBA) represents the one generally used for this 
type of vaccine.  
Assessor’s comment: 
The assays used for immunogenicity analysis were consistent to those used in former clinical studies with 
Hexyon or MenC conjugate vaccines. Protection levels applied were established correlates (D, T, IPV, PRP, 
HepB, and MenC) or accepted surrogates of protection (PT, FHA).

4.2.2.  Results 
Demography: 
The two groups of subjects were comparable in terms of age, gender, ethnic origin, height, body weight 
and body temperature. Overall, the mean (SD) age of randomized infants at first vaccination was 63.0 
days [range: 47-75 days], 52.9% were male and 92.6% were Caucasian. Mean weight was 5.5 kg (SD: 
0.7 kg). The mean ages at each vaccination visit were comparable between the two groups. Overall, the 
mean age at vaccination visits 1, 2 and 3 was 63.0 days, 95.8 days and 128.9 days, respectively, and 
confirmed a 2, 3 and 4 month vaccination schedule. 
Extent of exposure: 
All 350 subjects randomized received the first dose of Hexyon, 347 subjects (99.1%) received the second 
dose and 346 subjects (98.9%) received the third dose. 
Among the 175 subjects randomized to group 1 (Hexyon + MenC), 174 subjects (99.4%) received the 
first dose of MenC vaccine and 173 subjects (98.9%) received the second dose. One subject randomized 
to this group did not receive the MenC vaccine (both doses). One additional subject did not receive the 
second dose of MenC vaccine. 
Among the 350 randomised subjects, 345 subjects (98.6%) completed the study. Five subjects (1.4%) 
were withdrawn from the study: 1 subject (0.6%) in the Hexyon + MenC group and 4 subjects (2.3%) in 
the Hexyon group. Reasons leading to withdrawals were adverse events (3 subjects, see under safety,

Protocol deviations:  
Overall, 28 subjects (8.0%) were excluded from the PPS due to protocol deviations: 13 subjects (7.4%) 
in the Hexyon + MenC group and 15 subjects (8.6%) in the Hexyon group (Table 6. ). The most frequent 
deviations were non-compliance with the vaccination schedule (7 subjects in each group) and 
non-compliance with blood sampling schedule (6 and 8 subjects in the Hexyon + MenC and Hexyon 
group, respectively). One subject randomised to the Hexyon + MenC group was not vaccinated as per 
randomisation and did not receive the MenC vaccine.  
RESULTS  
Primary Immunogenicity Endpoints (PPS) 
The HepB SPR (proportion of subjects with antibody concentrations ≥10 mIU/mL) observed one month 
after the 3rd dose was very similar in both groups, i.e., 97.5% in the Hexyon + MenC group and 96.1% in 
the Hexyon group (Table 7). The difference in SPR between the two groups was 1.4 %, the lower bound 
of the 95%CI of the difference was -2.92%, i.e. greater than the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 
-10% (Table 7. ). The analysis showed that the concomitant administration of Hexyon with MenC vaccine 
is non-inferior to the administration of Hexyon without MenC in terms of HepB SPR at 1 month post-dose

The percentage of subjects with MenC rSBA titers ≥8 (1/dil) at 1 month post-dose 2 was 100%. The lower 
bound of the 95%CI was 97.7% which is greater than the pre-specified acceptability threshold of 90% 
(Table 8. ). Therefore, the concomitant administration of a MenC vaccine given at 2 and 4 MoA with 
Hexyon given at 2, 3 and 4 MoA induces a sufficient MenC response at 1 month after the 2nd MenC dose. 
The response is comparable to those achieved with MenC vaccine alone (see SmPC, NeisVac-C).

Assessor’s comment: 
Co-administration of Hexyon with MenC vaccine does not impact the infants’ primary immune response to 
Hepatitis B with regard to HepB SPR (> 10 mIU/mL) at 1 month post-Hexyon dose 3.  
Likewise,  the  MenC  SPR  (rSBA  titers  >8  [1/dil.])  at  1  month  post-2nd  dose  was  unaffected  by 
co-administration of Hexyon (for comparison, see also SmPC of NeisVac-C).  
Both co-primary objectives of study HXM01C were met.  
It should be noted that in study HXM01C, immune responses to the routine vaccines (Rotateq, Prevenar 
13) administered concomitantly to Hexyon and MenC had not been analysed. Concomitant use of these 
vaccines with Hexyon has, however, been proven in previous studies.

The MenC SPR was 99% after the 1st MenC dose and 100% after the 2nd dose at the pre-defined correlate 
of  protection  (>  8  [1/dil.]).  98  and  96%  of  subjects,  respectively,  achieved  the  higher  (long-term) 
seroprotection level of 128 (1/dil.) at 1 month post-dose 1 and post-dose 2 (Table 9. ). Geometric mean 
titers  (GMT)  lay  at  885  after  the  1st  MenC  dose  and  decreased  to  580  after  the  second  dose  with 
non-overlapping CI. However, the 2nd MenC dose allowed for an SPR > 8 [1/dil.] to be detected in every 
subject; the minmum GMT increased from 2 at post-dose 1 to 32 at post-dose 2.

Post-dose 3 immune response to Hexyon antigens 
One  month  after  the  3rd  Hexyon  dose,  no  notable  differences  were  observed between  both  groups in 
terms of seroprotection rates/vaccine response rates for any Hexyon antigen (Table 10. ). 
Proportions of subjects showing antibody responses above the minimum or short-term level of protection 
(HepB ≥10 mIU/L, PRP ≥0.15 mg/mL, D and T ≥0.01 IU/mL) were high and comparable for both groups 
ranging from 96 to 100%. 
Proportions of subjects with anti-D and anti-T ≥0.1 IU/mL (i.e., long-term protection levels) were also 
comparable  for  both  groups.  For  diphtheria,  the  SPR  rates  at  ≥0.1  IU/mL  were  low,  i.e,  35%  in  the 
Hexyon + MenC group and 41% in the Hexyon group ; corresponding anti-D GMC lay at 0.08 and 0.09 
IU/mL, respectively. Anti-D SPR and GMC were in the same range as those observed following primary 
vaccination with Hexyon in previous clinical studies, but should nevertheless be followed-up after booster 
vaccination to check for long-term protection of the subjects.  
The  GMCs  observed  for  PRP  and  tetanus  were  higher  in  the  Hexyon  +  MenC  group  compared  to  the 
Hexyon group (with non-overlapping CI; Table 11. ). There is some trend for decreased GMC/GMT in the 
Hexyon + MenC group compared to Hexyon group for pertussis and IPV antigens and HepB, however with 
overlapping CI. For HepB, GMC at post-primary vaccination lay at 243 mIU/mL for Hexyon + MenC and at 
268 mIU/mL for Hexyon, i.e. in the range of those found in previous primary vaccination studies using 
Hexyon. Levels are sufficient for the time interval until booster vaccination but insufficient with regard to

long-term  protection.  Booster  response  should  thus  be  followed-up  after  booster  vaccination  of  the 
subjects with Hexyon.  
Comparable results were observed in the Full Analysis Set. 
Assessor’s comment: 
Seroprotection  rates  /  vaccine  response  rates  as  well  as  GMC/GMT  after  3  doses  of  Hexyon 
co-administered with 2 doses of MenC (plus routine vaccines) were in the same range as those following 
Hexyon alone (plus routine vaccines). Following co-administration of MenC vaccine, increased GMC were 
found for PRP and tetanus, whereas GMC/GMT for most of the other Hexyon components were somewhat 
lower compared to Hexyon administered without MenC. However, both groups showed very similar SPR 
using established or surrogate levels of protection which supports the co-administration of Hexyon and 
MenC conjugate vaccine.  
Although satisfying SPR were obtained, for diphtheria and HepB, GMC levels were low at 1 month-post 
primary  dose  3.  Levels  are,  however,  in  the  range  of  those  found  in  previous  studies  with  Hexyon. 
Achievement of long-term protection levels should be followed up after booster vaccination. 
Overall, data did not indicate any relevant interference between immune responses to Hexyon and MenC 
vaccine antigens following concomitant administration.

4.2.3.  Discussion 
Following  primary  vaccination  with  3  doses,  the  HepB  SBR  (>  10mIU/mL)  after  Hexyon  +  MenC  was 
non-inferior to that after Hexyon without MenC. Further, all subjects showed protective antibody levels 
against MenC at 1 month-post 2nd dose.  
Data  showed  that  the  concomitant  administration  of  Hexyon  and  MenC  conjugate  vaccine  did  not 
negatively impact the immune response to both vaccines’ antigens. 
Antibody levels and seroprotection /vaccine response rates obtained after co-administration of Hexyon 
and MenC vaccine were very similar to those after Hexyon administered without MenC. Nevertheless, with 
regard to diphtheria and hepatitis B, primary vaccination with Hexyon resulted in antibody concentrations 
providing  short-term  but  not  long-term  protection.  They  should  thus  be  followed  up  after  booster 
vaccination. 
4.3.  Clinical Safety aspects 
4.3.1.  Methods –safety measurements 
The safety endpoints of study were the percentages of subjects with the following adverse events:  
In the 30 minutes after each vaccination: 
•  Any unsolicited (spontaneously reported) systemic adverse events  
From Day 0 to Day 7 following each vaccination: 
•  Solicited injection site reactions: erythema, swelling, pain 
•  Solicited    systemic    adverse    reactions:    pyrexia,    vomiting,    crying,    somnolence,    anorexia, 
irritability 
From Day 0 to Day 30 after each vaccination: 
•  Any unsolicited (spontaneously reported) injection site reactions and unsolicited systemic adverse 
events 
From the time the informed consent was signed to the last visit: 
•  Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
AEs of special interest (AESI) are AEs considered by the Sponsor to be relevant for the monitoring of the 
safety  profile  of  the  investigational  vaccine  were  also  reported  throughout  the  study.  AESI  included 
extensive limb swelling (ELS), hypotonic hyporesponsive episodes (HHE), convulsions (whether febrile or 
not), anaphylactic reactions, apnoea, severe neurological conditions and sudden infant death syndrome 
(SIDS) or sudden unexpected death (SUD) (although no increased risk of SIDS/SUD has been associated 
with hexavalent paediatric vaccines currently on the market). 
By  definition,  convulsions,  HHE,  anaphylactic  reaction  (including  cardiac  and  respiratory  symptoms), 
severe neurological conditions and fatal outcomes should be considered as serious adverse events. 
Data sets analysed 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/329785/2015 
Page 19/35 
 
 
 
 
The Safety Analysis Set was defined as all subjects who received at least one dose of study vaccine(s) 
(Hexyon and MenC) and who had safety follow-up data. 
One subject randomised to the Hexyon + MenC group was not vaccinated as per randomisation and did not 
receive the MenC vaccine. This subject was analysed according to the vaccine actually received and was 
therefore accounted in the Hexyon group for the Safety Set. 
Consequently, for the first vaccination, there were 174 subjects analysed for safety in the Hexyon + MenC 
group and 176 subjects analysed for safety in the Hexyon group. 
4.3.2.  Results 
All subjects included in the study reported at least one adverse event (Table 12. ). 
Four subjects (1.1% of all subjects), all in the Hexyon group, experienced an immediate unsolicited AE 
within 30 minutes after any vaccination, 3 of which were adverse reactions.  
• 
• 
The 3 immediate unsolicited reactions were rash (grade 1, after 2nd dose), constipation (grade 3, 
1st dose), and flatulence (grade 3, 1st dose). None of these events fulfilled seriousness criteria. 
The  immediate  unsolicited  AE  considered  as  not  related  to  the  study  vaccines  was  grade  1 
constipation, occurring after the first vaccination. 
The frequencies of solicited injection site reactions reported within 7 days after Hexyon injection tended 
to be higher in the Hexyon + MenC group (85%) than in the Hexyon group (74%; Table 13. ); injection 
site pain was the most frequent one, followed by erythema and swelling. Most injection site reactions 
were of grade 1 or 2 (see Table 12.5; CSR). 
All subjects experienced at least one solicited systemic reaction within 7 days after any vaccine injection 
(Table  14.  ).  For  both  groups,  the  most  frequent  solicited  systemic  reactions  were  irritability, 
somnolence,  crying,  pyrexia,  and  decreased  appetite.  No  notable  differences  were  observed  between 
both groups, except for crying which was reported more frequently in the Hexyon + MenC group (85% 
versus 71% in the Hexyon group). The frequency of vomiting also tended to be higher in the Hexyon + 
MenC group (36% versus 27%). No notable differences were observed between the two groups regarding 
intensity  of  solicited  systemic  reactions  which  were  mostly  of  grade  1  or  2.  However,  grade  3  crying 
tended to be reported more frequently in the Hexyon + MenC group (6% versus 2%). Two subjects from 
the  Hexyon  +  MenC  group  experienced  grade  3  pyrexia  (>39.5°C).  In  both  cases,  pyrexia  occurred 
between Day 0 and Day 3 after the 1st vaccination, lasted 1 to 2 days and resolved. 
The overall frequency of unsolicited non-serious AEs occurring within 30 days after any vaccine injection 
was  60%  in  the  Hexyon  +  MenC  group  and  61%  in  the  Hexyon  group  (Table  15.  ).  Generally,  no 
difference was observed in the frequency of various unsolicited non-serious AEs in both groups.  
Unsolicited non-serious ARs within 30 days after any vaccine injection were slightly more frequent in the 
Hexyon  +  MenC  group  (28%  versus  23%  in  the  Hexyon  group).  The  most  frequent  unsolicited 
non-serious  adverse reactions were injection site induration, diarrhoea, and injection site bruising. One 
subject in the Hexyon + MenC group and two subjects in the Hexyon group reported rash of grade 1 
considered to be related to vaccination. The events of rash (mainly located on the face) occurred within 
6 days after the first or second vaccination and lasted for 1 to 6 days. They all resolved without corrective 
treatment. 
Neither AESI nor deaths were reported during the study period. 
The incidence of SAEs was low in both groups: 4 subjects (2.3%) in the Hexyon + MenC group and 2 
subjects  (1.1%)  in  the  Hexyon  group.  Only  one  of  the  6  SAEs  was  considered  related  to  the  study

vaccines  (pyrexia  of  grade  2  (leading  to  hospitalisation  and  treated  with  paracetamol)  occurring  in  a 
subject  after  receiving  the  1st  doses  of  Hexyon  and  MenC  and  lasting  6  hours.  The  other  SAEs,  all 
considered as non-related to the study vaccines, were urinary tract infection (grade 1), gastroenteritis 
(grade 2), pneumonia (grade 2), pyelonephritis (grade 3) for 4 subjects, and skin neoplasm bleeding 
(grade  3;  haemangioma  bleeding  leading  to  the  subject’s  withdrawal  after  the  first  vaccination,  see 
below). 
Three subjects withdrew from the study after the first vaccination due to AEs, including 2 non-serious AEs 
considered related to the study vaccines (asthenia and crying, both of grade 3) and one SAE considered 
not related to the study vaccines (skin neoplasm bleeding of grade 3).  
Assessor’s comment: 
Solicited reaction site and systemic reactions and unsolicited AEs and ARs were reported with similar 
frequencies in both groups although for some safety endpoints higher numbers of subjects experienced 
AEs following concomitant administration of Hexyon and MenC vaccine, most of grade 1 or 2.  
Only one of the 6 SAEs (pyrexia of grade 2, leading to hospitalization) was related to vaccination. 
Overall, no safety concerns evolved regarding co-administration of both vaccines.

4.3.3.  Discussion 
The safety profile of Hexyon/Hexacima was generally similar whether co-administered or not with a 
meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine and is consistent with the one previously described in 
clinical trials. 
The immunogenicity and safety findings of this study support the concomitant administration of 
Hexyon/Hexacima with a meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine. 
4.4.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, section(s) 4.5 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated (additions in bold 
deletions strikethrough). The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly.

may be a clinically relevant interference in the antibody response of Hexacima and a varicella vaccine and 
these vaccines should not be administered at the same time. 
Data on concomitant administration of rotavirus vaccines have shown no clinically relevant interference in 
the antibody response to each of the antigens.  
Data on concomitant administration of Hexacima with a meningococcal C conjugate vaccine 
have shown no clinically relevant interference in the antibody response to each of the 
antigens. 
No data are available on concomitant administration of Hexacima with meningococcal vaccines. 
If co-administration with another vaccine is considered, immunisation should be carried out on separate 
injections sites.  
Hexacima must not be mixed with any other vaccines or other parenterally administered medicinal 
products. 
Except in the case of immunosuppressive therapy (see section 4.4), n No significant clinical interaction 
with other treatments or biological products has been reported except in the case of 
immunosuppressive therapy (see section 4.4).

5.  Request for supplementary information 
5.1.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects: 
Regarding Hexyon/Hexacima/Hexaxim SmPC: 
Table 1 (SmPC section 5.1) should be updated as follows 
• 
• 
• 
keep the pertussis data of 4-fold rise but use term ‘seroconversion rate’ instead of >4-fold rise 
(in order to match this with title wording) – otherwise exchange ‘seroconversion rate’ in  title by 
‘vaccine response’ 
present pertussis data as both, vaccine response and seroconversion rate 
The explanation for calculation of seroconversion (i.e., minimum 4-fold increase compared to 
pre-vaccination level) should be added as a table footnote. 
Further, pertussis data of Table 2 should be updated accordingly.  
Additional note to the applicant: 
Following completion of WS 676 (linguistic check) the assessor stumbled over a typing mistake in the 
SmPC, Table 2: vaccine response in the footnote was described as ‘Post-booster antibody concentration 
≥4-fold  rise  if  pre-booster  antibody  concentration  <8 EU/ml.  Post-booster  antibody  concentration 
≥2-fold rise if pre-booster antibody concentration ≥8 EU/ml’ which is actually the description of booster 
response. This should be corrected. 
This mixing up should be reconsidered during the preparation of responses. 
Additional comment of the assessor: 
To  provide  the  most  useful  information  to  the  prescriber/health  care  professionals,  the  assessor 
suggests to present aP data  
• 
• 
In table 1 (primary vaccination) as vaccine  response and seroconversion rate (> 4fold rise 
relative to pre-vaccination);  
In table 2 (booster vaccination) as booster  response and seroconversion rate (> 4fold rise 
relative to pre-vaccination); 
and include respective table footnotes to describe seroconversion rate and vaccine response or booster 
response, respectively. 
In order to allow the regulatory authorities of the other EU member states to evaluate the 
changes it is important to integrate changes of both WS676 and 702 within the responses to 
RSI (WS702). 
Please note that changes to Table 2 made in WS676 cannot be seen in the SmPC submitted 
with WS702 as the latter contains the previous SmPC version (before adoption of WS676).

6.1.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects: Question regarding corrections of SmPC  
Summary of the WSA’s response 
The applicant has updated the SmPC for Hexacima with acellular pertussis (PT, FHA) immunogenicity 
data. Changes adopted following the previous WS 676 were integrated in the submitted SmPC in order to 
demonstrate concordant update of Table 1 (primary vaccination) and Table 2 (booster vaccination) of 
SmPC Section 5.1. 
Assessment of the WSA’s response 
The changes are generally endorsed. However, in Table 2 aP data still need to be further updated/ 
commented – please see 2nd request for supplementary information.  
7.  2nd Request for supplementary information 
7.1.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects: 
1. 
The inconsistency in calculation of ’seroconversion’, i.e. >4-fold increase compared to 
pre-vaccination level (2+1 schedule) and >4-fold increase compared to pre-booster level (3+1 schedule), 
is not acceptable. The applicant is asked to consistently calculate seroconversion as >4-fold increase 
compared to pre-vaccination level.  
2. 
The applicant is asked to comment on how calculation of booster response data was performed. 
In a previous submission the same data were described as ‘vaccine response’.  
3. 
Further, the table footnote should be further adapted by exchanging the term ‘generally accepted 
correlates or surrogates of protection’ by ‘generally accepted surrogates (PT, FHA) or correlates of 
protection (other components)’. (Please also refer to attached SmPC document, p. 10 and p 22).

8.  Assessment of the responses to the 2nd request for

Clinical aspects: Questions regarding SmPC update 
Question 1 
The inconsistency in calculation of ’seroconversion’, i.e. >4-fold increase compared to pre-vaccination 
level (2+1 schedule) and >4-fold increase compared to pre-booster level (3+1 schedule), is not 
acceptable. The applicant is asked to consistently calculate seroconversion as >4-fold increase compared 
to pre-vaccination level.  
Summary of the WSA’s response 
The Applicant understands and acknowledges the Rapporteur’s comment on a clarification of the 
calculation of ‘seroconversion’. 
The applicant agrees to consistently calculate seroconversion as >=4-fold increase compared to 
pre-vaccination (pre-dose 1) level for 3+1 and 2+1 schedules. 
By consequence the seroconversion rates after booster vaccination were calculated for the 3+1 schedules 
and are presented in Appendix 1 for the following studies: 
•  A3L15: booster dose at 15-18 Months of Age (MoA) after a 3-dose primary immunization at 6, 10 
and 14 weeks of age; 
•  A3L22: booster dose at 15-18 MoA after a 3-dose primary immunization at 2, 3 and 4 MoA in 
A3L10; 
•  A3L21: booster dose at 15-18 MoA after a 3-dose primary immunization at 2, 4 and 6 MoA in 
A3L11. 
The seroconversion rates for the 2+1 schedule were already calculated as defined above and were 
presented in table 5.2 of the CSR of A3L38 study page 108-109 and tables 4.4 and 4.5 page 21-22 of 
A3L38 addendum of module 2.5 (Ref WS676). These values were included in the Product Information 
Table 2 Seroprotection/ Seroconversion rates* one month after booster vaccination with 
Hexaxim/Hexacima/Hexyon of the section 5.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC ) at the 
time of the first answer to questions on March 4th 2015. 
The seroconversion values presented in the SmPC (1.3.1 Product Information) section 5.1 Table 2 have 
been revised accordingly.  
The proposed footnote corresponding to the seroconversion is as follows:  
“‡‡  Seroconversion: minimum 4-fold increase compared to pre-vaccination level (pre-dose 1)” 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/329785/2015 
Page 29/35 
 
 
 
Assessor’s comment: 
The MAH/SOH has updated the seroconversion rates for aP components in table 1 and 2 of SmPC section 
5.1 to consistently express  > 4-fold increase compared to pre-dose 1 for both 2+1 and 3+1 vaccination 
schedules.  
The changes are acknowledged and approved.  
Question 2 
The applicant is asked to comment on how calculation of booster response data was performed. In a 
previous submission the same data were described as ‘vaccine response’.  
Summary of the WSA’s response

calculation  of  ‘Booster  response’  compared  to  the  calculation  of  ‘Vaccine  response’  in  Table  2 
Seroprotection/Sero- 
conversion 
rates* 
one  month 
after 
booster 
vaccination  with 
Hexaxim/Hexacima/Hexyon of the section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The applicant recognizes that the terminology "Vaccine response" as presented initially in the Table 2 of 
the SmPC of variation A3L38 (Ref WS676) was confusing. It should have been called "Booster Response" 
as defined below and in accordance with the A3L38 CSR: 
Post-booster  antibody  concentration  ≥4-fold  rise  if  pre-booster  antibody  concentration  <8  EU/ml;  or 
post-booster antibody concentration ≥2-fold rise if pre-booster antibody concentration ≥8 EU/ml 
During  the  assessment  of  the  HXM01C  variation  (Ref  WS702)  the  Rapporteur  pointed  out  the 
discrepancies between "Vaccine response" terminology and the data presented corresponding to "Booster 
response". Consequently the applicant changed the terminology in the Table 2 from "Vaccine response" to 
"Booster response" in the first answers to questions on March 4th 2015. 
As  requested  by  the  Rapporteur  to  present  the  seroconversion  referring  to  pre-vaccination  level 
(pre-dose  1),  and,  for  ease  of  understanding,  the  applicant  proposes  to  have  a  similar  approach  for 
presenting pertussis response rates in Table 2 and to refer to pre-vaccination level (pre-dose 1) instead 
of pre-booster level.  
To that respect the Vaccine response is presented in the Table 2 and defined as: 
Vaccine  response:  If  pre-vaccination  antibody  concentration  (pre-dose  1)  <8  EU/ml,  then  the 
post-booster  antibody  concentration  should  be  >=8  EU/ml.  Otherwise,  post-booster  antibody 
concentration should be >= pre-immunisation level (pre-dose 1). 
For  the  purpose  of  the  Applicant  response,  vaccine  responses  after  booster  dose  administration  were 
calculated for 3+1 schedules and are presented in Appendix 1 for the following studies: 
•  A3L15: booster dose at 15-18 Months of Age (MoA) after a 3-dose primary immunization at 6, 10 
and 14 weeks of age; 
•  A3L22: booster dose at 15-18 MoA after a 3-dose primary immunization at 2, 3 and 4 MoA in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/329785/2015 
Page 30/35 
 
 
 
A3L10; 
•  A3L21: booster dose at 15-18 MoA after a 3-dose primary immunization at 2, 4 and 6 MoA in 
A3L11. 
The vaccine response for the 2+1 schedule were already calculated as defined above and were presented 
in table 5.1 of the CSR of A3L38 study page 105 and table 4.1 page 18 of A3L38 addendum of module 2.5 
(Ref WS676).  
The  vaccine  responses  values  presented  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (1.3.1  Product 
Information) section 5.1 Table 2 have been revised accordingly. 
The proposed footnote corresponding to the vaccine response is as follows: 
“§Vaccine  response:  If  pre-vaccination  antibody  concentration  (pre-dose  1)  <8  EU/ml,  then  the 
post-booster  antibody  concentration  should  be  ≥8  EU/ml.  Otherwise,  post-booster  antibody 
concentration should be ≥ pre-immunisation level (pre-dose 1).” 
Assessor’s comment: 
The MAH/SOH has clarified discrepancies between vaccine response/ booster response terminology and 
respective aP data. In addition, for ‘ease of understanding’ the MAH/SOH exchanged booster response 
data in table 2 of SmPC section 5.1 by vaccine response data (presented in Appendix 1). Although booster 
response data would be more appropriate for the booster dose, the use of ‘vaccine response’ data is 
acknowledged as it is consistent with those in table 1 and thus facilitates readability of SmPC.  
The changes are accepted 
Question 3 
Further,  the  table  footnote  should  be  further  adapted  by  exchanging  the  term  ‘generally  accepted 
correlates  or  surrogates  of  protection’  by  ‘generally  accepted  surrogates  (PT,  FHA)  or  correlates  of 
protection (other components)’.  
Summary of the WSA’s response 
The Applicant acknowledges the Rapporteur’s comment on an adaptation of the footnote in the Table 1 
and 2 of section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The term ‘generally accepted correlates or surrogates of protection’ was replaced by ‘generally accepted 
surrogates (PT, FHA) or correlates of protection (other components)’ each time the requested change 
applies. 
The footnotes presented in the Summary of Product Characteristics (1.3.1 Product Information) section 
5.1 Table 1 and Table 2 have been revised accordingly. 
Assessor’s comment:  
The MAH/SOH has updated the table footnotes as suggested beforehand. The changes are approved.

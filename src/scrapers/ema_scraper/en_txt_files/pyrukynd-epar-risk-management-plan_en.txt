Chemical class: pyruvate kinase activator 
Summary of mode of action: Pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK deficiency) 
is characterized by diminished activity of the red blood cell (RBC)-
specific form of the pyruvate kinase (PKR) enzyme, which leads to 
reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, shortened RBC lifespan, 
and chronic hemolysis. Mitapivat is a pyruvate kinase activator and acts 
by directly binding to the pyruvate kinase tetramer. Mitapivat improves 
RBC energy homeostasis by increasing PKR activity and ATP 
concentrations, while decreasing 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG). 
Important information about its composition: 
Mitapivat drug product is supplied as 5 mg, 20 mg, and 50 mg tablet 
strengths (free-base equivalent) for oral administration.  
Mitapivat drug substance is a synthetically derived, small molecule.  
Each film-coated tablet contains lactose monohydrate equivalent to 0.3, 
1.4, and 3.4 mg lactose in mitapivat tablets, 5 mg, 20 mg, and 50 mg, 
respectively.

Part II: Safety Specification 
Part II: Module SI – Epidemiology of the indication and target population 
Indication:  
Mitapivat (also known as mitapivat sulfate, AG-348, and AG-348 sulfate hydrate and 
formerly known as AGI-1480 and AGX-0841) is indicated for the treatment of pyruvate 
kinase deficiency (PK deficiency) in adult patients. 
Incidence and prevalence: 
Pyruvate kinase deficiency is currently classified as the most frequent cause of congenital 
nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia with a prevalence estimated at 1/20,000 in the general 
White population on Orphanet (Orphanet, 2020). However, as with many rare genetic 
diseases, the true prevalence of PK deficiency is not well understood (Beutler and Gelbart, 
2000). A systematic review and critical appraisal of the literature was recently undertaken to 
better understand the epidemiology of the disease (Secrest et al, 2020). With no established 
international databases designed to ascertain the prevalence of PK deficiency, the scope of 
the systematic review included peer-reviewed publications from indexed literature search 
platforms and hand searches of relevant conferences. 
Searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, PubMed, Ovid, a single conference year 
(2018) of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Hämatologie und Medizinische Onkologie, and other 
publicly available sources of information to estimate the prevalence of PK deficiency. 
Pyruvate kinase deficiency and PKLR terms and keywords were combined with 
epidemiology and gene frequency terms and keywords in queries. Search terms used 
included, but were not limited to, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate metabolism, PK deficiency, 
PKLR, gene mutation, prevalence, and incidence. 
The systematic review concluded that the best estimate of diagnosed prevalence of PK 
deficiency is between 3.2 and 8.5 per million in Western populations, while the prevalence of 
diagnosed and undiagnosed PK deficiency may be as high as 51 per million (Beutler and 
Gelbart, 2000; Carey et al, 2000; de Medicis et al, 1992). These findings suggest that most 
patients with PK deficiency remain undiagnosed (Secrest et al, 2020).  
Demographics of the population in the proposed indication – age, gender, racial and/or 
ethnic origin, and risk factors for the disease: 
Pyruvate kinase deficiency occurs equally in men and women and most often presents within 
the first month of life; however, diagnoses in adulthood are frequent, particularly in patients 
with compensated hemolysis, mild anemia, or misdiagnosed with another hemolytic disorder 
(Grace and Barcellini, 2020). Overall, patients with more severe anemia are diagnosed at an 
earlier age, but diagnosis may also be delayed until late adulthood (Grace et al, 2019; Zanella 
et al, 2005). Higher frequency of the recessively inherited disease reflects consanguinity or, 
more commonly, a founder effect. This can be seen in the Pennsylvania Amish community 
where a particularly high frequency exists, associated with a homozygous 1436G→A 
mutation that results in the production of histidine instead of arginine, which can be traced 
back to a single immigrant couple (Kanno et al, 1994). Similarly, this can also be seen in the 
Romani communities, associated with a 1,149 base pair deletion and loss of exon 11 
(Baronciani and Beutler, 1995). Higher onset of symptoms leading to diagnosis is also seen in 
females aged 21 to 30 years. This preponderance might be due to pregnancy as pregnancy

itself precipitates hemolysis, and blood counts are more likely to be obtained during this time 
(Hirono et al, 1988). Furthermore, recent data suggest the genetic epidemiology of PK 
deficiency may also be influenced by selection. Evidence of a protective effect has been 
obtained from murine malaria models and reduced replication of plasmodium falciparum in 
the red cells of pyruvate kinase deficient patients ex vivo (Min-Oo et al, 2003; Qidwai et al, 
2014). A high frequency of PK deficiency is found in populations in the Middle East and 
Sub-Saharan Africa that have been subject to selective pressure from malaria (Machado et al, 
2012; van Bruggen et al, 2015). 
The main existing treatment options: 
Currently there are no approved disease-specific therapeutic agents for the treatment of 
patients with PK deficiency. Historic attempts to develop pharmacologic treatments, such as 
riboflavin and sulphydryl compounds, have been unsuccessful (Blume et al, 1976; Staal et al, 
1975; Zanella et al, 1976). Patients’ treatment options are supportive, treating the symptoms 
of lifelong hemolytic anemia and associated complications. These supportive care options 
may lead to additional complications by themselves and further compound complications of 
the existing disease as well. To treat the anemia common interventions include splenectomy 
and transfusions that increase hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations while iron chelation and 
cholecystectomy treat the common complications of the hemolytic anemia, described in more 
detail below. Hematopoietic allogeneic stem cell transplantation, although potentially 
curative, is rarely performed because of a relatively high morbidity and mortality rate 
compared with supportive care (Grace and Barcellini, 2020; van Straaten et al, 2018). 
Mitapivat, a pharmacologic activator of PKR, would be the first product indicated for the 
treatment of PK deficiency in adult patients if approved.  
Approximately half (59%) of all patients diagnosed with PK deficiency undergo total 
splenectomy, with median age at splenectomy of 4.1 years, either to reduce the need for 
transfusion (in patients who are regularly receiving transfusions) or to increase Hb (in 
patients who are not regularly receiving transfusions but who tolerate their anemia poorly). 
Splenectomy may not ameliorate anemia or alleviate the need for transfusions because 
hemolysis continues at other anatomical sites (Grace et al, 2019). In addition, splenectomy 
exposes patients to the risk of infection, which can require prolonged prophylactic antibiotic 
therapy and strict vaccination compliance, and increases the risk of thrombosis, pulmonary 
hypertension, and iron overload (Crary and Buchanan, 2009; Evans, 1985; Jones et al, 2016). 
Partial splenectomy has been considered as an alternative to total splenectomy in multiple 
types of congenital hemolytic anemias due to the emergence of antibiotic‐resistant 
pneumococci and the risk of post‐splenectomy thrombosis. The goal of partial splenectomy, 
in which at least 80%-90% of the spleen is removed, is to decrease hemolysis while leaving 
behind a functioning splenic remnant for phagocytic function. There are a few case reports 
documenting the results of partial splenectomy in patients with PK deficiency with 2 
documented failures and 1 documented success with an increase in the baseline Hb and 
reduction in transfusions (Diesen et al, 2008; Rice et al, 2003; Sandoval et al, 1997). In 
practice, most clinicians do not recommend partial splenectomy for PK deficiency (Grace et 
al, 2019).  
Another common intervention is RBC transfusion. The decision to transfuse a patient with 
PK deficiency is based on each patient’s tolerance of anemia, their lifestyle, and quality of 
life (QOL) considerations; there are no guidelines defining recommended transfusion 
regimens (Al-Samkari et al, 2020; Grace et al, 2019). Patients with similar Hb concentrations 
and symptom severity can differ in their chosen transfusion frequency; therefore, transfusion

Mitapivat 
frequency should not be used as an indicator of disease severity (Al-Samkari et al, 2020). 
Although transfusions can temporarily increase Hb, they have been shown to lead to 
increases in iron overload, which may result in further complications and negatively affect 
QOL. In the PK Deficiency Natural History Study, patients who were regularly receiving 
transfusions after splenectomy had higher median ferritin and were more likely to require 
chelation therapy (94% vs 44%) than patients who discontinued regular transfusions after 
splenectomy (Grace et al, 2018). Patient surveys indicate that patients are concerned about 
the risks of iron overload and the need for chelation therapy associated with regular 
transfusions, as well as the prospect of being dependent on transfusions for their entire lives 
(Al-Samkari et al, 2020; White et al, 2020).  
Iron chelation is commonly used because of iron overload caused by PK deficiency itself and 
by other supportive care treatments such as transfusion. However, compliance is often poor, 
limiting its benefit, and there are risks associated with its use. For example, decreases in 
serum creatinine clearance and increases in transaminases, requiring frequent monitoring, are 
common with deferasirox. Cases of hepatitis and serious hypersensitivity reaction have also 
been reported (Exjade (deferasirox) Summary of Product Characteristics, 2016; Exjade 
(deferasirox) Package Insert, 2019; Jadenu (deferasirox) Package Insert, 2019). 
Besides the supportive treatments targeting improvement of hemolytic anemia, there are other 
treatments focused on additional complications of the disease. For instance, another frequent 
complication of PK deficiency is gallstones due to increased levels of unconjugated bilirubin; 
these are frequently treated with cholecystectomy (Grace et al, 2019; Grace et al, 2015). 
However, patients who have undergone cholecystectomy can still develop biliary lithiasis, 
which can result in chronic liver damage. Furthermore, patients with PK deficiency often 
have osteopenia and osteoporosis and endocrine dysfunction, such as thyroid disease, which 
all need to be appropriately managed. 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity:  
An observational study to obtain critical information regarding the natural history of PK 
deficiency and the range and incidence of related symptoms, treatments, and complications—
known as the PK Deficiency Natural History Study (NCT02053480)—has been developed by 
Boston Children’s Hospital (Boston, Massachusetts, United States [US]) and was funded and 
supported by Agios. This multicenter, global Natural History Study was designed as a 
longitudinal cohort study with retrospective, baseline, and annual collection of data over a 
2-year period and has identified 254 pediatric and adult subjects. Patients with PK deficiency 
present with anemia and a range of comorbidities, such as splenectomy, thrombosis, sepsis, 
iron overload with secondary organ damage, gallstones, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and 
bone abnormalities (Grace et al, 2018). 
Important comorbidities: 
Splenomegaly is present in 80%-85% of individuals with PK deficiency, with variable 
degrees of enlargement (Grace et al, 2019). Possible causes of splenomegaly include 
deposition of iron and dead RBCs in the spleen from hemolysis and extramedullary 
erythropoiesis. Hypersplenism can occur in the setting of splenomegaly and should be 
suspected in patients with an increasing transfusion burden, mild thrombocytopenia, or 
neutropenia. Individuals with palpable splenomegaly may be at risk for splenic injury with 
trauma to the abdomen (Grace et al, 2019).

Mitapivat 
Splenectomy is a common procedure in subjects with PK deficiency, which causes a loss of 
immunological defense, placing patients at risk for infections and sepsis with encapsulated 
organisms (Zahid and Bains, 2017). Antibiotics for infection prophylaxis and a more 
intensive immunization schedule are indicated after splenectomy. The ideal duration for 
prophylactic antibiotics is not clear. Some physicians recommend a lifetime of prophylactic 
antibiotics, and others will recommend discontinuation after 1 year if patients live close to a 
medical center and agree to seek urgent medical care for all fevers (Grace et al, 2019). In the 
PK deficiency Natural History Study, post‐splenectomy sepsis was reported in 7% of patients 
(Grace et al, 2018). 
Because PK deficiency causes severe hemolytic anemia, patients are more susceptible to 
developing jaundice and gallbladder disease. In healthy adults, RBCs are phagocytized and 
broken down by macrophages, with the heme group in Hb being converted to unconjugated 
bilirubin. The unconjugated bilirubin is then exported from the macrophage, binds to 
albumin, and is taken up by hepatocytes. Once in the hepatocyte, the bilirubin is conjugated 
and excreted into bile. In cases of hemolysis, increasing amounts of unconjugated bilirubin 
are produced and unconjugated bilirubin builds up in the blood, leading to high total bilirubin 
values. Severity of hemolysis and modifiers of bilirubin metabolism determine the degree of 
indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Nearly every patient with PK deficiency will have an elevated 
indirect bilirubin level, due to increased unconjugated bilirubin, and will experience frequent 
complications of jaundice and gallstones. Gallstones are a frequent complication of PK 
deficiency, occurring at all ages and reported in 30%-45% of patients (Grace et al, 2019; 
Zanella et al, 2007). 
Another common comorbidity of PK deficiency is iron overload. Iron overload in PK 
deficiency, similar to other hemolytic anemias, develops because of ineffective 
erythropoiesis, which causes the suppression of hepcidin, the key systemic regulator of iron 
metabolism, which leads to increased intestinal iron absorption and release of iron from iron 
stores (Finkenstedt et al, 2009; Rider et al, 2011a). Furthermore, iron overload can be 
secondary to regular transfusions, which has been used to treat severe forms of the disease 
such as hemolytic episodes, severe symptoms of anemia, and aplastic crisis. The human body 
lacks a physiologic mechanism for removal of the excess iron load resulting from blood 
transfusion. Each unit of transfused packed RBCs contains approximately 200 to 250 mg of 
elemental iron. In the presence of iron overload, after transferrin binding is saturated, non-
transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) is readily transported through calcium channels into the 
hepatocytes, cardiac myocytes, and endocrine glands. The accumulation of iron in different 
organs leads to the different clinical complications of iron overload. Reactive oxygen species 
produced by the metabolism of NTBI contribute to the cellular dysfunction, apoptosis, and 
necrosis in target organs. Iron overload has been associated with multiple comorbidities 
including heart failure secondary to cardiac siderosis, cardiac arrythmia, liver fibrosis, 
chronic viral hepatitis, pulmonary hypertension, leg ulcers, and endocrine disease 
(hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, growth retardation, hypogonadism, 
osteoporosis/osteopenia, and diabetes). Patients with transfusion-dependent treatment tend to 
develop clinical iron overload after 10-20 transfusions while non-transfusion-dependent 
patients will develop clinical iron overload later in life at approximately 10-15 years of age 
(Grace et al, 2019).  
Patients with PK deficiency are likely to develop osteopenia throughout their lifetimes. The 
pathogenesis of PK deficiency osteopenia is multifactorial. Anemia itself, along with iron 
overload and its associated complications, can all have detrimental effects on bone health. 
Ineffective erythropoiesis can cause an exponential increase in the number of erythroid

precursors produced, resulting in bone marrow expansion. Iron overload directly disrupts 
bone formation, has toxic effects on osteoblasts, and induces a decrease in the recruitment of 
cells of the osteoblastic lineage, and transfusion-related iron deposition in endocrine glands 
can cause impaired growth (Balogh et al, 2018). Patients with PK deficiency are at risk for 
low bone mineral density (BMD), fractures, and bone pain. Adults with PK deficiency have a 
15.6% higher chance of developing osteoporosis compared with the general population, with 
the chances increasing to 21.2% in patients who have ever received a transfusion 
(Boscoe et al, 2020). Correspondingly, in a large cohort study, universal dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) scanning has revealed that over three-quarters of adults with PK 
deficiency had osteopenia or osteoporosis (median age of 36 years), irrespective of 
transfusion requirements (Al-Samkari, Grace, et al, 2020). Bone fractures have been reported 
in 17% of adult subjects with PK deficiency (Grace et al, 2018). 
Similar to other hemolytic disorders, pulmonary hypertension is a complication of PK 
deficiency. The dysfunction and destruction of erythrocytes leads to numerous changes in the 
cardiovascular system, both as compensatory mechanisms and as pathologic consequences of 
the disease. Anemia results in reduced blood viscosity, elevated cardiac output, decreased 
cardiac filling pressures, and reduced systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. In addition 
to changes resulting directly from anemia, organ dysfunction may contribute to pathologic 
changes in the cardiovascular system. Liver disease, cardiac dysfunction, renal impairment, 
and splenic changes may all be confounding factors when examining the mechanisms by 
which pulmonary hypertension develops in chronic hemolytic anemia (Fraidenburg and 
Machado, 2016). Pulmonary hypertension, diagnosed by echocardiogram and confirmed with 
cardiac catheterization, is a complication in 3% of patients with PK deficiency after 
splenectomy (Bachmeyer et al, 2009; Grace et al, 2018). 
Extramedullary hematopoiesis, driven by ineffective erythropoiesis, occurs in approximately 
10% of patients (Grace et al, 2018). This occurs most commonly in the liver and spleen but 
also occurs in the paravertebral area and mediastinum (Aizawa et al, 2003; Plensa et al, 
2005). Rarely, extramedullary hematopoiesis occurs in the central nervous system, eye, 
lymph nodes, lung, or pleura. 
Leg ulcers have also been reported in patients with PK deficiency. The etiology is 
multifactorial, although it is important to note that erythrocytes in hemoglobinopathies are 
rigid and inflexible and can cause occlusion of smaller blood vessels, vascular obstruction, 
and subsequently tissue necrosis. Other potential contributing factors to consider are 
infections, abnormal autonomic control with excessive vasoconstriction, thrombosis, decrease 
in oxygen carrying capacity due to anemia, and impaired endothelial function (Alavi and 
Kirsner, 2015).

Mitapivat 
Part II: Module SII – Nonclinical part of the safety specification 
A series of nonclinical pharmacology, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion 
(ADME), pharmacokinetic, and toxicology studies have been conducted to support the 
Marketing Authorisation Application for mitapivat for the treatment of PK deficiency in adult 
patients.  
Key Safety Findings  
(from nonclinical studies) 
Toxicity 
Single- or Repeat-Dose Toxicity Studies 
The main toxicities from the nonclinical single- 
or repeat-dose toxicity studies were 
hypersensitivity (anaphylactoid reactions) 
observed in dogs, reproductive findings in rats, 
and emesis observed in monkeys. No evidence 
of liver injury (unrelated to hypertrophy) was 
observed in any of the toxicity studies. 
Hypersensitivity: In a non–Good Laboratory 
Practice (GLP)-compliant, single-dose study of 
mitapivat in beagle dogs, clinical observations 
consistent with anaphylactoid reactions, 
including swelling (ear, eyelid, mouth, paw) 
and/or discoloration (reddening of the mouth, 
thoracic region, abdominal region, or whole 
body) were observed at ≥30 mg/kg. Emesis was 
observed at ≥62.5 mg/kg. Lethargy, prostration, 
and reduced activity were noted in dogs given 
125 mg/kg on Day 1. The maximum tolerated 
dose was 62.5 mg/kg, which correlated with area 
under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from 
time 0 to 12 hours (AUC0-12hr) and maximum 
(peak) concentration (Cmax) values of 8,580 
hr•ng/mL (2.4-fold the human AUC0-12hr value 
[3,580 hr•ng/mL] at 50 mg twice daily [BID]) 
and 4,890 ng/mL, respectively. The 
no-observed-effect level (NOEL)/no-observed-
adverse-effect level (NOAEL) in dogs was 
10 mg/kg, which correlated with mitapivat 
AUC0-12hr and Cmax values of 1,200 hr•ng/mL 
(0.34-fold the human AUC0-12hr value at 50 mg 
BID) and 447 ng/mL (0.46-fold the human Cmax 
value at 50 mg BID), respectively. Based on the 
results of the single-dose studies, the rat and the 
monkey were chosen as the toxicology species 
for further evaluation. The dog was considered 
the less appropriate higher species because of 
anaphylactoid reactions, to which dogs are 
known to be more sensitive than humans. These 
reactions would have limited the exposure in 
subsequent dog studies, thereby compromising 
the full evaluation of toxicity at high exposure 
Relevance to Human Use 
Hypersensitivity: The clinical signs seen in the 
single-dose dog study were typical of anaphylactoid 
reactions described in dogs (Dowling, 2009; Hacker 
et al, 1981; Lorenz et al, 1977; Lorenz et al, 1982; 
Waddell, 2010), which have been noted after 
administration of lipid and nonlipid detergents, 
radiocontrast media, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs, analgesics, and morphine (Szebeni, 2005). 
Anaphylactoid reactions have been observed after 
oral administration of drugs in dogs in early 
development programs. Importantly, it is well known 
that dogs are very sensitive to anaphylactoid 
reactions compared with rats or humans (Lorenz et 
al, 1977; Lorenz et al, 1982). Additionally, the liquid 
formulation administered in dogs was different from 
the tablet or capsule formulation administered to 
humans. No events suggestive of an anaphylactoid 
reaction have been reported with mitapivat in clinical 
studies in healthy adult subjects and subjects with PK 
deficiency. 
Hypersensitivity adverse events (AEs) were observed 
in subjects with PK deficiency who received 
mitapivat. In the clinical development program, 
hypersensitivity AEs were reported for 26 subjects 
(26 of 155, 16.8%) with PK deficiency and 6 subjects 
(6 of 155, 3.9%) had hypersensitivity AEs assessed 
as related to treatment by the Investigator 
(Table 19-3.1, Table 18.3.1-10.6b). There were no 
Grade ≥3 AEs of hypersensitivity or serious adverse 
events (SAEs) of hypersensitivity in studies with 
mitapivat (Table 19-3.1, Table 19-4.1). The 
incidence of events of hypersensitivity was higher in 
subjects who received placebo in

multiples over those expected clinically, and 
dogs were not used in any further toxicology or 
safety pharmacology studies (Module 2.6.6, 
Section 2.2.1). 
Gastrointestinal (emesis) and hepatic findings: 
In a 28-day GLP-compliant repeat-dose monkey 
study, administration of mitapivat resulted in 
nonadverse higher liver weights in the 
150 mg/kg/day group males and females with no 
correlating microscopic observations. The 
NOEL was determined to be 50 mg/kg/day and 
the NOAEL was 150 mg/kg/day for both sexes. 
The dosage level of 150 mg/kg/day resulted in 
Day 27 mitapivat AUC0-12hr and Cmax values of 
13,400 hr•ng/mL (3.7-fold the human AUC0-12hr 
value at 50 mg BID) and 3,510 ng/mL, 
respectively, in males and 12,700 hr•ng/mL 
(3.5-fold the human AUC0-12hr value at 50 mg 
BID) and 3,260 ng/mL, respectively, in females 
(Module 2.6.6, Section 3.2.4).  
In a 13-week GLP-compliant repeat-dose 
monkey study, administration of mitapivat 
resulted in nonadverse clinical observations of 
emesis at all dose levels, transient body weight 
loss during Week 0 in the 100 and 
200 mg/kg/day group males and females, and 
microscopic changes of hepatocellular 
hypertrophy correlating with higher liver 
weights in the ≥50 mg/kg/day group males and 
females. Based on these results, the NOAEL was 
200 mg/kg/day. The dosage level of 
200 mg/kg/day resulted in Day 90 mean Cmax 
values of 2,420 ng/mL and 3,180 ng/mL, and 
mean AUC0-12hr values of 10,400 hr•ng/mL and 
14,600 hr•ng/mL (2.9- and 4.1-fold the human 
AUC0-12hr value at 50 mg BID), for males and 
Relevance to Human Use 
double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of adult 
patients with PK deficiency who were not 
regularly transfused, compared with subjects who 
received mitapivat. During the 24-week period, 
hypersensitivity AEs were reported for 10 subjects 
(10 of 39, 25.6%) with PK deficiency who received 
placebo and 4 subjects (4 of 40, 10%) with PK 
deficiency who received mitapivat 
(Table 18.3.1-10.6a). 
Hypersensitivity was observed in humans; however, 
the observed AEs were mild in severity, nonserious, 
and resolved without treatment discontinuation. 
Hypersensitivity is a potential risk that is not 
considered important for inclusion in the list of safety 
concerns in the risk management plan (RMP). 
Hypersensitivity is a potential risk with minimal 
clinical impact on patients (in relation to the severity 
of the indication treated) (Module SVII.1.1).  
Hepatic findings: No evidence of liver injury 
(unrelated to hypertrophy) was observed in any of the 
single or repeat-dose toxicity studies. This is 
important as (quantitative) structure-activity 
relationship models have predicted mitapivat to have 
hepatotoxic potential due to the presence of the 
sulfonamide substructure, as well as the known link 
to hepatotoxicity of sulfonamide class of antibiotic 
drugs (4-aminobenzene-sulfonamides). These agents 
are characterized by a 5- or 6-membered 
nitrogen-containing ring attached to the nitrogen 
(N1) of the sulfonamide group and an arylamine 
group (N4) at the para position from the sulfonamide 
moiety (Brackett, 2007; Brackett et al, 2004; 
Choquet-Kastylevsky et al, 2002; Hemstreet and 
Page, 2006; Knowles et al, 2001; Smith and Jones, 
2008; Strom et al, 2003; Tornero et al, 2004; Verdel 
et al, 2006). The liver toxicity associated with the 
sulfonamide antibiotics is part of a spectrum of 
adverse reactions believed to be caused by 
metabolites of the antibiotics, which are specific to 
the N1 and N4 structural context (Brackett, 2007; 
Brackett et al, 2004; Choquet-Kastylevsky et al, 
2002; Hemstreet and Page, 2006; Knowles et al, 
2001; Naisbitt et al, 1999; Tornero et al, 2004). 
Mitapivat is structurally distinct from the 
sulfonamide antibiotics. Mitapivat does not belong to 
the 4 aminobenzene-sulfonamide class and, more 
importantly, does not have the N1 or the N4 moieties 
highlighted previously. Mitapivat will be 
metabolized distinctly and cannot produce the 
metabolites thought to be responsible for 
sulfonamide antibiotic-related liver toxicity.

females, respectively (Module 2.6.6, 
Section 3.2.5).  
In a 9-month GLP-compliant repeat-dose 
monkey study, a minimal nonadverse increase in 
emesis was noted. At necropsy, increased liver 
and adrenal weights, correlating with 
hepatocellular hypertrophy and hypertrophy of 
the zona fasciculata, respectively, at or above 
50 mg/kg/day. Minimal subcapsular 
hepatocellular pressure necrosis, secondary to 
adaptive hepatocellular hypertrophy, was 
observed in the 100 and 200 mg/kg/day males 
and 200 mg/kg/day females and was considered 
adverse. Increased incidence of pigmented 
macrophages in lungs, liver, and lymph nodes in 
all mitapivat groups was considered a 
nonadverse exacerbation of what was seen in 
control animals. Based on the results of this 
study, the NOAEL was considered to be 
50 mg/kg/day for males and 100 mg/kg/day for 
females. These dosage levels corresponded to 
mean AUC0-12hr values of 4,370 and 
8,040 hr•ng/mL (1.2- and 2.2-fold the human 
AUC0-12hr value at 50 mg BID) and mean Cmax 
values of 1,570 and 2,350 ng/mL for males and 
females, respectively, on Day 270 (Module 
2.6.6, Section 3.2.6).  
Reproductive findings: In a GLP-compliant 
28-day rat study, histologic effects consistent 
with off-target aromatase inhibition were 
observed in the male and female reproductive 
tract at the mid- and high-dosage levels, which 
were associated with AUC0-12hr values 
≥79,000 hr•ng/mL. The NOAEL was considered 
to be 600 mg/kg/day for males and 
20 mg/kg/day for females. Dosage levels of 
600 mg/kg/day for males and 20 mg/kg/day for 
females resulted in Day 27 mitapivat AUC0-12hr 
values of 118,000 and 10,400 hr•ng/mL (33- and 
2.9-fold the human AUC0-12hr value at 50 mg 
BID), respectively, and mitapivat Cmax values of 
27,500 and 4,730 ng/mL, respectively (Module 
2.6.6, Section 3.1.3).  
In a 13-week GLP-compliant repeat-dose rat 
study, adverse microscopic findings included 
spermatid retention, tubular degeneration, and 
increased incidence and/or severity of Leydig 
cell hypertrophy in males at ≥150 mg/kg/day 
and uterine atrophy in females at 
100 mg/kg/day. Based on the results of this 
study, the NOAEL was considered to be 
Relevance to Human Use 
In Study AG348-C-001, a Phase 1 single-ascending 
dose clinical study in healthy subjects, 1 subject who 
received a single dose of mitapivat 120 mg 
experienced a Grade 2 alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) and Grade 1 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
increase without increased bilirubin on Day 17 that 
resolved without treatment. An additional 6 subjects 
experienced transient Grade 1 laboratory increases in 
ALT and/or AST (CSR AG348-C-001).  
In Study AG348-C-002, a Phase 1 multiple-
ascending dose clinical study in healthy subjects, 1 
subject who received mitapivat 700 mg BID 
experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of Grade 
3 increase in ALT and AST and an increase of 
bilirubin to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal 
(ULN) after 11 days. Treatment was stopped, and the 
subject’s liver test results returned to normal. The 
sponsor and Investigator assessed the elevated liver 
tests as related to mitapivat and they were considered 
a DLT. An additional 10 subjects had transient Grade 
1 laboratory increases in ALT and/or AST across 
dosing levels (CSR AG348-C-002). 
Transaminase increases were observed in subjects 
with PK deficiency who received mitapivat. In the 
clinical development program, transaminase 
increased AEs were reported for 24 subjects (24 of 
155, 15.5%) with PK deficiency and 10 subjects (10 
of 155, 6.5%) had transaminase increased AEs 
assessed as related to treatment by the Investigator 
(Table 19-3.1, Table 18.3.1-10.6b). There were no 
SAEs of transaminase increased reported in subjects 
with PK deficiency treated with mitapivat (Table 
19-4.1). The incidence of events of transaminase 
increased was higher in subjects who received 
placebo in Study AG348-C-006 compared with 
subjects who received mitapivat, possibly due to 
untreated hemolysis associated with PK deficiency. 
During the 24-week period, transaminase increased 
AEs were reported for 6 subjects (6 of 39, 15.4%) 
with PK deficiency who received placebo and only 1 
subject (1 of 40, 2.5%) with PK deficiency who 
received mitapivat (Table 18.3.1-10.6a). A higher 
percentage of subjects in Study AG348-C-007, an

females. Dosage levels of 60 mg/kg/day for 
males and 50 mg/kg/day for females resulted in 
Day 90 mitapivat AUC0-12hr values of 16,800 and 
39,400, respectively (4.7 and 11-fold the human 
AUC0-12hr value at 50 mg BID), and mitapivat 
Cmax values of 5,550 and 13,600, respectively 
(Module 2.6.6, Section 3.1.4).  
In a 6-month GLP-compliant repeat-dose rat 
study, potentially adverse microscopic findings 
included retained spermatids and occasional 
vacuolation of the seminiferous epithelium in 
males at ≥150 mg/kg/day and uterine atrophy 
and increased vaginal mucification in the 
200 mg/kg/day group females. All test article-
related findings recovered or partially recovered 
during the recovery period except for mean body 
weights, which remained similar to the end of 
the dosing period; however, body weight gains 
during the recovery period were similar to those 
of the control group animals. Based on the 
results of this study, the NOAEL was considered 
to be 60 mg/kg/day in males and 50 mg/kg/day 
in females. The 60 mg/kg/day dosage level in 
males corresponded to a mean AUC0-12hr value of 
23,900 hr•ng/mL (6.7-fold the human AUC0-12hr 
value at 50 mg BID) and a mean Cmax value of 
9,770 ng/mL, and in females, the 50 mg/kg/day 
dosage level corresponded to a mean AUC0-12hr 
value of 66,000 hr•ng/mL (18-fold the human 
AUC0-12hr value at 50 mg BID) and a mean Cmax 
value of 16,700 ng/mL for mitapivat on Study 
Day 180 (Module 2.6.6, Section 3.1.5).

GLP-compliant definitive embryo-fetal 
development studies were conducted in Sprague 
Dawley rats and New Zealand white rabbits. 
Developmental toxicities were observed in rats 
but not rabbits. Fetal adverse effects in rats were 
considered likely due to changes in sex 
hormones related to aromatase inhibition. 
In the definitive study in pregnant female 
Sprague Dawley rats, oral administration of 
mitapivat to pregnant female rats resulted in 
maternal toxicity at a dosage level of 
200 mg/kg/day as evidenced by moribundity of a 
single female, as well as test article–related 
clinical findings of clear nasal discharge, clear 
material around the mouth, and salivation during

clinical studies with subjects with PK deficiency. The 
sponsor conducted intensive investigation and 
assessment of all AESI and transaminase increased 
AEs reported. There were no clinically relevant 
trends identified in the events reported that would 
indicate mitapivat as the perpetrator of the AEs. 
Transaminase increase is not considered a risk for

findings of enlarged or fused placentae and a 
distended amniotic sac. In addition, a test 
article–related lower mean body weight gain 
with corresponding reduced mean food 
consumption was noted at 200 mg/kg/day after 
the initiation of dose administration. No 
evidence of maternal toxicity was noted at 10, 
20, or 50 mg/kg/day. An increased mean litter 
proportion of post-implantation loss with a 
corresponding decrease in the mean number and 
litter proportion of viable fetuses was noted in 
the 200 mg/kg/day group. In addition, lower 
mean fetal weights and test article–related 
external, soft tissue, and skeletal malformations 
were noted for fetuses in the 200 mg/kg/day 
group. Intrauterine growth, survival, and fetal 
morphology were unaffected by test article 
administration at 10, 20, and 50 mg/kg/day. 
Based on these results, teratogenicity consistent 
with changes in sex hormones due to aromatase 
inhibition was observed in the embryo-fetal 
development study at AUC0-12hr values [of 
227,000 hr•ng/mL] 63-fold the human AUC0-12hr 
value at 50 mg BID. A dosage level of 
50 mg/kg/day was considered the NOAEL for 
maternal and embryo-fetal developmental 
toxicity when mitapivat was administered orally 
by gavage to bred Sprague Dawley rats. A 
dosage level of 50 mg/kg/day resulted in 
AUC0-12hr values of 23,900 and 46,800 hr•ng/mL 
(6.7- and 13-fold the human AUC0-12hr value at 
50 mg BID) and Cmax values of 8,400 and 
11,400 ng/mL on Gestation Day (GD) 6 and 17, 
respectively (Module 2.6.6, Section 6.2.1.2).  
In the definitive reproductive toxicity study in 
time-mated New Zealand white rabbits, based on 
adverse clinical findings (decreased defecation), 
body weight deficits, and corresponding reduced 
food consumption at 125 mg/kg/day, a dosage 
level of 60 mg/kg/day was considered to be the 
NOAEL for maternal toxicity. Lower mean fetal 
body weights were noted at 125 mg/kg/day; 
therefore, a dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day was 
considered to be the NOAEL for embryo-fetal 
development when mitapivat was administered 
orally by gavage to time-mated New Zealand 
white rabbits. A dosage level of 125 mg/kg/day 
resulted in AUC0-12hr values of 9,190 and 
11,200 hr•ng/mL (2.6- and 3.1-fold the human 
AUC0-12hr value at 50 mg BID) and Cmax values 
of 4,270 and 5,390 ng/mL on GD 7 and 20, 
respectively. A dosage level of 60 mg/kg/day

the reproductive organ NOEL in the repeat-dose 
toxicity study in which this occurred was 
5,150 hr•ng/mL (1.4-fold the human AUC0-12hr value 
[3,580 hr•ng/mL] at 50 mg BID). All findings with 
the potential to impair fertility in the Sprague Dawley 
rats were reversible after discontinuation of the study 
drug. 
Women of reproductive potential and men with 
partners who are women of reproductive potential 
were included in the clinical studies but were 
required to be abstinent as part of their usual 
lifestyle, or agree to use 2 forms of contraception, 1 
of which must have been considered highly effective, 
from the time of giving informed consent, during the 
study, and for at least 1 month after the last dose of 
study treatment for women and 90 days after the last 
dose of study treatment for men. This is in 
accordance to the clinical trial facilitation group 
(CTFG) guidance because mitapivat is classified as 
an investigational medical product with possible 
human teratogenicity/fetotoxicity in early pregnancy 
(CTFG, 2014). In Study AG348-C-003, a Phase 2, 
open-label, randomized, dose-ranging study in adult 
subjects with PK deficiency, 1 subject, a 
-year-old 
female, became pregnant after receiving mitapivat 
25 mg BID for approximately 11 months. Upon 
report of the pregnancy, treatment with mitapivat was 
immediately discontinued by the Investigator. The 
subject received mitapivat 25 mg BID for 39 days 
between her last menstrual period and the positive 
home pregnancy test. The pregnancy proceeded 
normally with no events reported in the mother or 
fetus. The subject gave birth to a normal healthy 
baby 
 by scheduled 
caesarian section. The projected exposure of the 
subject was 19 times lower than the exposure in the 
rat at the dose where no adverse effects were 
observed on the fetus and the mother (ie, the 
NOAEL) (CSR AG348-C-003, Section 14.3.3). 
Additionally, 1 pregnancy was reported in a partner 
of a male subject who was receiving mitapivat 25 mg 
BID in Study AG348-C-003. The subject received

experiencing postpartum hemorrhage, which led to 
prolongation of hospitalization. There was a manual 
removal of placenta 
(CSR AG348-C-003, Section 
14.3.3). 
The SmPC Section 4.6 states that women of 
childbearing potential should avoid becoming 
pregnant while receiving Pyrukynd. Women of 
childbearing potential should use contraception 
during treatment with Pyrukynd and for at least 1 
month after the last dose. Mitapivat may decrease the 
systemic exposure of hormonal contraceptives that 
are sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 (see SmPC 
Sections 4.4 and 4.5). Additional or alternative 
methods of contraception should be considered. 
The SmPC Section 4.6 states that there are no or a 
limited amount of data from the use of mitapivat in 
pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see SmPC Section 5.3). 
Pyrukynd is not recommended during pregnancy and 
in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception. The SmPC Section 4.6 states that there 
are no human data on the effect of mitapivat on 
fertility. Animal studies have shown reversible 
effects on reproductive organs of males and females 
(see SmPC Section 5.3). While taking mitapivat, 
there may be an impact on the ability of a woman and 
a man to conceive. Section 5.3 of the SmPC 
describes the relevant nonclinical findings pertinent 
to effects on male and female reproductive organs 
and sperm quality, considered related to the sex 
hormone changes due to the inhibition of aromatase 
by mitapivat. 
Although human data on pregnancies are limited, 
there is no evidence of human teratogenicity based 
on genotoxic potential and the 2 successful 
pregnancies. Although nonclinical reproductive 
toxicity studies did not demonstrate 
teratogenicity/fetotoxicity at maternal exposures 
comparable to those in humans administered 
mitapivat at 50 mg BID (proposed clinical dose), 
these studies demonstrated embryo-fetal toxicity at 
high dose levels. Based on these nonclinical findings, 
embryo-fetal toxicity is considered an important 
potential risk (Module SVII.3.1).  
Key Safety Findings  
(from nonclinical studies) 
resulted in AUC0-12hr values of 3,930 and 
5,360 hr•ng/mL (1.1- and 1.5-fold the human 
AUC0-12hr value at 50 mg BID) and Cmax values 
of 2,320 and 2,430 ng/mL on GD 7 and 20, 
respectively (Module 2.6.6, Section 6.2.2.3).   
Fertility and Early Embryonic Development 
A GLP-compliant, combined fertility and early 
embryonic development study was conducted to 
evaluate oral administration of mitapivat in male 
and female Sprague Dawley rats before 
cohabitation, through mating and implantation, 
and through recovery. The results of the 
combined fertility and early embryonic 
development study demonstrated effects on 
maternal and paternal parameters; however, no 
effects on mating or fertility were observed. The 
paternal NOEL for mitapivat was 60 mg/kg/day. 
Reduced body weights and body weight gains 
were observed in the males at 300 mg/kg/day 
and reduced food consumption was observed at 
150 and 300 mg/kg/day. At 300 mg/kg/day, a 
mitapivat-related macroscopic observation of 
bilateral small testes was observed, and 
mitapivat-related microscopic findings were 
observed at ≥150 mg/kg/day in the testes and 
epididymides, including degeneration of the 
seminiferous tubules, spermatid retention, and 
atypical residual bodies in the testes as well as 
an increased incidence of cellular debris in the 
epididymides. These pathologic findings 
correlated with decreased sperm motility and 
density and increased numbers of abnormal 
sperm (detached or no head). The findings 
observed in the treated male rats did not affect 
mating parameters at doses up to and including 
300 mg/kg/day and were determined to be 
reversible during the 10-week recovery period. 
The paternal NOAEL was determined to be the 
high dose of 300 mg/kg/day as no effect on 
mating and fertility parameters was observed up 
to an including this dose. The Day 84 AUC0-12hr 
value correlating with this dose was 
160,000 hr•ng/mL (45-fold the human AUC0-12hr 
value at 50 mg BID). 
The maternal NOEL for mitapivat was 
50 mg/kg/day. Reductions in food consumption 
and decreases in progesterone levels were 
observed at 200 mg/kg/day. There were also 
decreases in the number of estrous stages during 
the precohabitation period at 200 mg/kg/day, but 
this change was not considered adverse because

there were no effects on the number of females 
that mated or were pregnant. There were no test 
article–related histopathologic findings observed 
in the female rats at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day. 
All findings in females resolved during the 4-
week recovery period. The maternal NOAEL for 
mitapivat was determined to be the high dose of 
200 mg/kg/day as no effect on mating and 
fertility parameters was observed up to and 
including this dose. The Day 29 AUC0-12hr value 
correlating with this dose was 174,000 hr•ng/mL 
(49-fold the human AUC0-12hr value at 50 mg 
BID) (Module 2.6.6, Section 6.1.1).  
Developmental and Perinatal/Postnatal 
Reproduction  
A GLP-compliant oral gavage developmental 
and perinatal/postnatal reproduction study was 
conducted in Sprague Dawley rats to detect 
adverse effects of mitapivat on maternal rats and 
development of the offspring consequent to 
exposure of the maternal rats from implantation 
through lactation and weaning (Module 2.6.6, 
Section 6.3.1). Mitapivat was administered to 
females (F0 generation) beginning on GD 7 and 
continuing through Lactation Day (LD) 20. 
Administration of ≥50 mg/kg/day mitapivat was 
not tolerated in F0 generation females and 
resulted in unscheduled mortality due to 
dystocia/prolonged parturition. Maternal 
mitapivat-related clinical observations were 
observed at ≥50 mg/kg/day, primarily in animals 
that experienced unscheduled mortalities or 
dams euthanized due to no surviving pups. 
Reduced mean maternal body weights, body 
weight gains, and food consumptions, and 
increases in mean duration of gestation and 
percentage of dams with stillborn pups or no 
liveborn pups were observed only at 
200 mg/kg/day. Reduced postpartum pup 
viability was observed at 200 mg/kg/day, 
resulting in significant reductions in offspring 
(F1 generation) up to postpartum Day 10, and 
because of excessive mortality, no F1 generation 
rats in the 200 mg/kg/day group were weaned or 
included for postweaning assessment. There 
were no mitapivat-related effects on any reflex 
and development parameter in preweaning F1 
pups at any dose; however, the limited number 
of litters surviving at 200 mg/kg/day for 
evaluation precluded accurate interpretation of 
findings at that dose. Maternal doses

Maternal doses of mitapivat as high as 
50 mg/kg/day did not affect learning and 
memory, mating and fertility, macroscopic 
observations, sperm evaluation, or any ovarian 
and uterine parameter in the F1 generation rats 
or naïve female rats mated with F1 generation 
males. Based on these results, the NOAEL for 
general toxicity in the F0 generation females 
was 20 mg/kg/day, and reproductive toxicity in 
the F1 generation males and females was 
considered to be 50 mg/kg/day. Per protocol, 
toxicokinetic (TK) parameters were determined 
in this study; however, based on GD 17 
exposures observed in the definitive rat embryo-
fetal development study, the maternal NOAEL 
would correspond with maternal AUC0-12hr 
values of 12,500 hr•ng/mL (3.5-fold the human 
AUC0-12hr value at 50 mg BID), and the NOAEL 
for reproductive toxicity in F1 rats would 
correspond with maternal AUC0-12hr values of 
46,800 hr•ng/mL (13-fold the human AUC0-12hr 
value at 50 mg BID). 
Lactation 
There are no nonclinical data on excretion of 
mitapivat in milk. 
Studies in Juvenile Animals 
In a non–GLP-compliant 28-day range-finding 
oral gavage toxicity study in juvenile Sprague 
Dawley rats, mitapivat was administered from 
Postnatal Day (PND) 7 through 35 or PND 21 
through 49 (Report AG348-N-101) (Module 
2.6.6, Section 6.4.1). Regardless of dose or the 
period of dose administration, oral 
administration of mitapivat did not produce 
mortality, adverse clinical observations, 
differences in mean body weights, mean body 
weight gains, mean food consumption values, or 
macroscopic observations in males or females.

Lactation: 
Safety in this population is currently not known. The 
SmPC Section 4.6 states that it is unknown whether 
mitapivat and/or its metabolites are excreted in 
human milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be 
excluded. A decision must be made whether to 
discontinue breast-feeding or to abstain from 
Pyrukynd therapy taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy 
for the woman.  
Use during lactation is not considered part of the 
safety concerns in the RMP. 
Findings in the GLP-compliant juvenile toxicology 
study largely recapitulated findings observed in 
previous toxicology and reproductive and 
development studies using adult Sprague Dawley 
rats, with only few novel findings as outlined below. 
Most findings were attributable to changes in sex 
hormones due to aromatase inhibition and/or 
perturbations in CYP enzyme expression.  
Consistent with studies in adult rats, reproductive 
effects were observed upon sexual maturity in 
juvenile rats administered mitapivat; all evaluable 
reproductive effects outlined below were reversible 
after a non-dosing recovery period. Delayed sexual

to mean body weights and brain weights were 
increased in males in the 20 and 100 mg/kg/day 
dose groups on PND 21. Based on these results, 
the NOAEL in males and females after mitapivat 
administration from PND 7 to 35 was 
100 mg/kg/day (AUC0-12hr range of 20,900 to 
76,300 hr•ng/mL and Cmax range of 6,690 to 
20,500 ng/mL). The NOAEL for males and 
females administered mitapivat from PND 21 to 
49 was 300 mg/kg/day (AUC0-12hr 
39,400 hr•ng/mL and Cmax 7,500 ng/mL) and 
100 mg/kg/day (AUC0-12hr 71,800 hr•ng/mL and 
Cmax 22,200 ng/mL), respectively. 
In a GLP-compliant 13-week study in juvenile 
Sprague Dawley rats (Report AG348-N-102) 
(Module 2.6.6, Section 6.4.2), mitapivat was 
administered from PND 7 through PND 97 (in 
main study animals) or from PND 7 through 
PND 125/LD 6 (in reproductive subset animals) 
to juvenile Sprague Dawley rats, with a 
Recovery Phase of approximately 11 weeks 
(males) and approximately 6 weeks (females).  
Reproductive effects were observed upon sexual 
maturity in juvenile rats administered mitapivat; 
all evaluable reproductive effects were 
reversible after a nondosing recovery period. 
Delayed sexual maturity was observed in males 
at ≥150 mg/kg/day; there was no effect of 
mitapivat on sexual maturity in females. Lower 
percentage of motile sperm and epididymal 
sperm density were observed at 300 mg/kg/day. 
Negative effects of mitapivat on male mating 
and fertility parameters and litter and uterine 
examinations after mating with untreated female 
cohorts at ≥150 mg/kg/day and longer precoital 
interval and lower mating, fertility, and 
pregnancy indices were observed, as well as 
lower pregnancy rates and lower implantation 
sites and live pups/litter. In females, longer 
estrous cycle length was observed at 
200 mg/kg/day. Mitapivat administration to 
juvenile female rats resulted in dystocia/ 
prolonged parturition upon sexual maturation at 
≥50 mg/kg/day, manifesting as adverse clinical 
observations, mortality, prolonged gestation, 
higher numbers of stillborn pups and poor pup 
viability/survival.

of mitapivat on male mating and fertility parameters 
and litter and uterine examinations after mating with 
untreated female cohorts at AUC0-12hr values ≥79,000

Clinical pathology findings in juvenile rats 
administered mitapivat were similar to those in adult 
rats with a few exceptions as outlined below. 
Reversible hematology findings of lower 
reticulocytes and/or higher red cell distribution width 
were observed in juvenile males and females at all 
doses of mitapivat and AUC0-12hr values 
≥5,430 hr•ng/mL, or ≥1.5-fold the human AUC0-12hr 
value at 50 mg BID; in studies in adult rats, this 
finding was most prominent in female rats and 
occurred only sporadically in males. Reversible 
higher urine pH was observed in males at all doses at 
AUC0-12hr values ≥5,430 hr•ng/mL, or ≥1.5-fold the 
human AUC0-12hr value at 50 mg BID, and this 
finding was not previously observed in adult rats. 
Reversible or partially reversible lower triglycerides 
were observed in females at all doses and AUC0-12hr 
values ≥6,480 hr•ng/mL, or ≥1.8-fold the human 
AUC0-12hr value at 50 mg BID, and in males only at 
the high dose and AUC0-12hr values 223,000 
hr•ng/mL, 62-fold the human AUC0-12hr value at 50 
mg BID; lower triglycerides were not commonly 
observed in adult rat toxicology studies and were 
seen only in males at high doses. A unique finding in 
juvenile rats was lower cholesterol observed only in 
the recovery period in males and females at all doses.  
In females, higher thyroid and ovary weights were 
observed at AUC0-12hr values ≥72,000 hr•ng/mL, or 
≥20-fold the human AUC0-12hr value at 50 mg BID,

period. Higher ovary weights were observed in 
toxicology studies using adult female rats. Higher 
thyroid weights were a novel finding in juvenile rats; 
however, the proliferative thyroid findings were 
attributable to chronic CYP enzyme induction after 
initiation of dosing and were observed in the rat

finding in adult rat toxicology studies, and both 
findings were conspicuously absent in juvenile rats. 
It is likely that initiation of dosing of mitapivat in 
neonatal rats (PND 7) resulted in persistently altered 
expression of CYP enzymes in treated animals and is 
related to the persistent changes in the recovery 
period of ovarian and thyroid weights, as well as 
altered cholesterol homeostasis evident in the 
recovery period (Piekos et al, 2017).  
Bone changes including lower bone density and mass 
were observed at all doses and AUC0-12hr values

≥72,000 hr•ng/mL, or ≥20-fold the human AUC0-12hr 
value at 50 mg BID, in females; bone changes were 
at least partially reversible after the recovery period. 
The pediatric population is included as a special 
population in the Pyrukynd SmPC Sections 4.2 and 
5.2. Per Section 4.2 of the Pyrukynd SmPC, the 
safety and efficacy of Pyrukynd in children and 
adolescents less than 18 years old have not been 
established. No data are available. Non-clinical 
studies in juvenile animals have been conducted (see 
Section 5.3 of the SmPC). In the Pyrukynd SmPC 
Section 5.2, it states that the pharmacokinetics of 
mitapivat in children and adolescent patients less 
than 18 years old have not been studied. Also, the 
indication statement for Pyrukynd in the SmPC 
(Section 4.1) clearly states that the medicinal product 
is for use in adult patients.  
Use of mitapivat in pediatric subjects has not yet 
been evaluated in the clinical development program. 
As the target indication does not cover pediatric 
patients, pediatric use is not a risk.  
Key Safety Findings  
(from nonclinical studies) 
was observed in males at all doses. Reversible or 
partially reversible lower triglycerides were 
observed in females at all doses and in males 
only at the 300 mg/kg/day dose. Lower 
cholesterol was observed only in the recovery 
period in males and females at all doses.  
Organ weight changes in male juvenile rats 
included higher testis weights correlating 
histologically with seminiferous tubule 
dilatation at all doses and higher epididymis 
weights correlating with epididymal cellular 
debris 300 mg/kg/day; all findings partially 
resolved after the recovery period. In females, 
higher thyroid and ovary weights were observed 
at ≥50 mg/kg/day, and weights remained higher 
after the recovery period. Higher liver weights 
with correlative hepatocellular hypertrophy 
consistent with cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme 
induction were a prominent finding in adult rat 
toxicology studies, and both findings were 
conspicuously absent in juvenile rats. Bone 
changes including lower bone density and mass 
were observed at all doses in males and at 
≥50 mg/kg/day mg in females; bone changes 
were at least partially reversible after the 
recovery period.  
The NOAEL for general toxicity could not be 
established in males due to adverse microscopic 
findings in reproductive organs at all dose 
levels. In females, the NOAEL for general 
toxicity was 10 mg/kg/day based on adverse 
clinical observations in females occurring at the 
end of the gestation period/during parturition. 
The NOAEL for F1 growth and development 
was 30 mg/kg/day in males and 
200/100 mg/kg/day in females due to effects on 
sexual maturation that were observed in males. 
The NOAEL for mating and fertility was 
30 mg/kg/day in males and 200/100 mg/kg/day 
in females based on effects on multiple mating 
and fertility parameters in males and the absence 
of effects on mating and fertility parameters at 
any dose level in females. The NOAEL for 
reproductive toxicity in females was 
10 mg/kg/day based on mortality and adverse 
clinical observations as a result of 
dystocia/prolonged parturition. The NOAEL for 
F2 generation preweaning growth and

Genotoxicity 
Mitapivat was nonmutagenic and nonclastogenic 
in GLP-compliant assays including bacterial 
reverse mutation assays, an in vitro 
micronucleus assay in human peripheral blood 
lymphocytes, and an in vivo micronucleus assay 
in Sprague Dawley rats (Reports AG348-N-002-

AG348-N-045-R1) (Module 2.6.6, 
Section 4.1.1).  
Carcinogenicity 
In a GLP-compliant 2-year study in juvenile 
Sprague Dawley rats, mitapivat was 
administered for at least 104 consecutive weeks 
to determine the carcinogenicity and TK 
characteristics of mitapivat. Mitapivat 
administration was associated with neoplastic 
lesions in the liver and thyroid of males at 
300 mg/kg/day and preneoplastic lesions in the 
liver of males at all dose levels and females at 
200 mg/kg/day, which is most likely related to 
known effects of mitapivat on CYP enzyme 
induction and associated hepatocellular changes 
(centrilobular hypertrophy). Beyond this effect, 
there was no evidence that mitapivat caused de 
novo tumor types or promoted rare tumor types 
within the liver. Additionally, in the pancreas of 
males, acinar adenoma and hyperplasia were 
observed at an increased incidence and/or 
severity at ≥30 mg/kg/day; however, the 
pancreatic findings were within the range of 
historical control data at ≤100 mg/kg/day and 
were outside the historical control data range

hepatocellular adenoma/carcinoma in males given 
300 mg/kg/day, an increased incidence and/or 
severity of foci of cellular alteration at 
≥30 mg/kg/day in males and at 200 mg/kg/day in 
females, a dose-related increased incidence and 
severity of centrilobular hypertrophy in both sexes at 
all doses, and an increased incidence of biliary cysts 
in females at 200 mg/kg/day. In the thyroid gland, 
administration of mitapivat was associated with 
increased incidence of follicular cell adenoma and 
diffuse follicular cell hypertrophy in males given 
300 mg/kg/day. The higher incidence of 
hepatocellular adenoma/carcinoma, hepatocellular

In a GLP-compliant 26-week carcinogenicity

mitapivat was administered for 26 weeks to 
determine the potential carcinogenicity and TK

feature in previous rat toxicology studies. These 
findings were considered rodent-specific and not 
relevant for human safety assessment (Hall et al, 
2012). 
In the ovaries, an increased incidence and/or severity 
of granulosa and/or luteal/granulosa cell hyperplasia 
was noted in females at 200 mg/kg/day. This finding 
occurred only at mitapivat AUC0-12hr values well 
above the range observed in humans (>100-fold) and 
was therefore not considered relevant for human 
safety assessment. 
In the pancreas, acinar adenoma and hyperplasia 
were observed at an increased incidence and/or 
severity in males from all dose groups; the incidence 
of acinar hyperplasia was outside the historical 
control data range for males at 300 mg/kg/day while 
it was considered equivalent to the maximal historic 
incidence for males at 100 mg/kg/day (6.67% vs 
6.15%) and within the historic control data range for 
males at 30 mg/kg/day. The pancreatic findings were 
not considered to represent a significant risk for 
human safety based on a weight of evidence 
assessment that considered the following: 1) No 
malignancies occurred; 2) The incidence of the 
pancreatic findings was outside the range observed 
historically in the test strain only at 300 mg/kg/day 
(47-fold the human AUC0-12hr at 50 mg BID), and the 
findings of acinar hyperplasia and adenoma likely 
reflect an exacerbation of a background finding in the 
rat test system; 3) The off-target aromatase inhibitory 
activity of mitapivat creates a hormonal milieu (high 
testosterone, low estrogen) known to potentiate 
pancreatic acinar adenomas in rats. Rats are more 
sensitive to the inhibitory effect of mitapivat on 
aromatase than humans, suggesting aromatase 
modulation would not promote proliferative 
processes in the pancreas at relevant mitapivat 
exposures in humans; 4) The molecular pathogenesis 
of ductal adenocarcinoma in humans is very different 
from that of rat acinar tumors; and 5) Pharmacologic 
activation of pyruvate kinase is not known to be 
carcinogenic, and mitapivat itself was nongenotoxic 
in all assessments of mutagenicity and clastogenicity. 
In the clinical development program, no events 
suggestive of mitapivat having a carcinogenic signal 
have been reported to date.  
Carcinogenicity is not considered a risk for 
mitapivat. As the nonclinical carcinogenicity findings 
are not considered to represent a safety risk in 
humans and no clinical data suggestive of mitapivat

Cardiovascular System, Including Potential 
Effect on the QT Interval 
Multiple nonclinical studies were conducted to 
address the potential cardiovascular (CV) effects 
of mitapivat, including automated and manual 
patch clamp assays for potential inhibition 
against currents known to be associated with 
prolonged heart rate–corrected QT interval 
(QTc) (Reports AG348-N-006-R1, 
AG348-N-014-R1, and AG348-N-023-R1) and a 
single-dose CV safety pharmacology study in 
cynomolgus monkeys (Report 
AG348-N-048-R1) (Module 2.7.2, 
Section 3.5.1). 
In both the automated and manual patch clamp 
assays for potential inhibition of human ether-à-
go-go related gene (hERG) currents, mitapivat 
was determined to have low potential for 
inhibition of the hERG current. 
Mitapivat was also tested in vivo for CV effects 
in a GLP-compliant CV safety pharmacology 
study in cynomolgus monkeys. Under the 
conditions of this study, the NOEL was 
75 mg/kg, the highest level tested. The mitapivat 
AUC0-12hr and Cmax in plasma at 75 mg/kg/dose 
were 23,600 hr•ng/mL (6.6-fold the human 
AUC0-12hr at the recommended dose) and 
5,470 ng/mL (5.7-fold the human Cmax at the 
recommended dose), respectively.  
having a carcinogenic potential have been reported to 
date. 
The clinical relationship of change from baseline in 
heart rate–corrected QT interval (QTc) and plasma 
concentrations of mitapivat was characterized with 
results from Study AG348-C-004 and AG348-C-014.  
In Study AG348-C-004, the pharmacokinetics and 
safety of mitapivat after a single dose of 5, 50, or 
200 mg were evaluated in healthy Japanese and 
healthy non-Asian subjects. The results of the study 
predicted a change from baseline in QTc by 
Fridericia’s method (ΔQTcF) of 0.000707 
milliseconds (ms) (relative SE = 51%) per ng/mL 
increase in mitapivat concentration in the study 
population. The final model was used to predict mean 
(90% CI) for ΔQTcF at the observed Cmax after a 
single administration of mitapivat 50 mg and 200 mg. 
At a mitapivat concentration of 1,080 ng/mL, the 
geometric mean Cmax for the 50 mg dose in this study 
(N=20), ΔQTcF was predicted to be 1.28 ms (90% CI 
-2.03, -0.53 ms). At a mitapivat concentration of 
5,052 ng/mL, the geometric mean Cmax for the 
200 mg dose in this study (N=20), ΔQTcF was 
predicted to be 1.53 ms (90% CI -1.27, 4.32 ms). 
This concentration-QTc analysis showed that the 
change from baseline in QTcF with mitapivat was 
well below the 10 ms threshold established by the 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E14 
guideline (US FDA, 2005) and subsequent E14 Q&A 
(R3) (ICH, 2015) (Module 2.7.2, Section 3.5.2.1). 
In Study AG348-C-014, the pharmacokinetics, 
safety, and tolerability of mitapivat after a single oral 
dose of mitapivat 100 mg in the fasted state, 
mitapivat 100 mg in the fed state, mitapivat 300 mg 
in the fasted state, and placebo were evaluated. In the 
concentration-QTc analysis (fasted arms only), a full 
model including both mitapivat and its metabolite 
(AGI-8702) was selected as the primary model. The 
estimated slope of mitapivat and AGI-8702 was 
shallow and not statistically significant: 0.000048 ms 
per ng/mL (90% CI −0.0004501, 0.0005467) for 
mitapivat and 0.0046 ms per ng/mL (90% CI 
−0.00398, 0.01322) for AGI­8702, with a small but 
statistically significant treatment-effect intercept of 
0.96 ms. The predicted effect on placebo-corrected 
∆QTcF (∆∆QTcF) was estimated to 3.17 ms (90% CI 
1.94, 4.41) and 3.12 ms (90% CI 1.78, 4.45) at the 
geometric mean concentration pairs of mitapivat and 
AGI-8702, respectively, for the mitapivat 300 mg

dose group. Based on this concentration-QTc 
analysis, a QTcF effect (∆∆QTcF) exceeding 10 ms 
can be excluded within the observed plasma 
concentrations of mitapivat and AGI-8702 up to 
~14,200 and ~689 ng/mL, respectively. The observed 
plasma concentration of mitapivat up to 
~14,200 ng/mL is 14.7-fold above the mitapivat 
median Cmax at steady state from the population PK 
analysis at 50 mg BID mitapivat in subjects with PK 
deficiency (CSR AG348-C-014, Module 2.7.2, 
Section 3.5.2.2). 
The cardiovascular system, including the potential to 
effect the QT interval, is not considered a risk for 
mitapivat. 
As there were no treatment-related clinical 
observations in the central nervous system in the 
animal study, there is no relevance to human use. 
As there were no treatment-related clinical 
observations in the respiratory system in the animal 
study, there is no relevance to human use. 
Central Nervous System and Respiratory 
System 
In a GLP-compliant study to evaluate the effects 
of mitapivat (30, 150, and 300 mg/kg 
administered orally) on the gross behavioral, 
physiological, and neurologic state of male 
Sprague Dawley rats using a modification of a 
primary observation test, specifically the Irwin 
test (Irwin, 1968), mitapivat did not affect the 
gross behavioral, physiologic, or neurologic 
state of any animals. Under the conditions of this 
study, the NOEL was 300 mg/kg mitapivat, the 
highest level tested. The mitapivat AUC0-12hr and 
Cmax values at 300 mg/kg/dose were 
188,000 hr•ng/mL (53-fold the human AUC0-12hr 
at the recommended dose) and 31,400 ng/mL 
(33-fold the human Cmax at the recommended 
dose), respectively (Module 2.6.2, 
Section 4.2.1). 
Respiratory System 
A GLP-compliant study was conducted to 
evaluate the acute respiratory effects of 
mitapivat when administered orally to male 
Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 0, 30, 150, or 
300 mg/kg. A single oral gavage administration 
of mitapivat to male Sprague-Dawley rats at 30, 
150, or 300 mg/kg did not alter respiratory 
frequency, tidal volume, or minute volume. 
Under the conditions of this study, the NOEL 
was 300 mg/kg, the highest dose tested. The 
mitapivat AUC0-12hr and Cmax values at 
300 mg/kg/dose were 188,000 hr•ng/mL

Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions 
Mitapivat metabolism was examined using 
human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP 
enzymes (Report AG348-N-096). Results from 
this study suggest that mitapivat is primarily 
metabolized by CYP3A4/5, with minor 
contributions from CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and 
CYP1A2. In the same superseding study (Report 
AG348-N-096), in vitro metabolism of mitapivat 
was studied in human liver microsomes with and 
without CYP enzyme-specific inhibitors, and 
recombinant CYP isoforms. The results from 
this study indicate that mitapivat is mainly 
metabolized (approximately 94%) by 
CYP3A4/5. The other CYP enzymes appear to 
have only minimal contributions to the 
metabolism of mitapivat. 
Based on in vitro transporter studies, mitapivat 
appears to be a substrate and an inhibitor of 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (91% and 99% inhibition 
at 41 and 411 µM, respectively), but not breast 
cancer resistance protein (BCRP) (half-maximal 
inhibitory concentration [IC50] >100 μM) 
(Report AG348-N-057). The uptake ratio of 
mitapivat in organic anion transporting 
polypeptide (OATP)1B1- and OATP1B3-
expressing cells was <2, and it was neither time 
nor concentration dependent, suggesting that 
mitapivat is not a substrate of OATP1B1 or 
OATP1B3 (Report AG348-N-097). Mitapivat 
appears to be a weak inhibitor of BSEP, 
OATP1B1, organic anion transporter (OAT)3, 
multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE)1, 
and organic cation transporter (OCT)2, with IC50 
values of 22.0, 29.0, 12.1, 7.17, and 7.76 μM, 
respectively (Reports AG348-N-089 and 
AG348-N-097). 
In vitro, mitapivat appeared to be a weak 
inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 enzymes (IC50 values 
>100 μM) (Report AG348-N-054). IC50 shift 
experiments indicated the potential for 
metabolism-based inhibition of CYP2C19 
(largely reversible) and of CYP3A4/5 (largely 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC includes a general statement 
regarding the potential for drug-drug interactions. It 
states that co-administration of specific medicinal 
products with mitapivat may result in increased risk 
of insomnia or changes in efficacy of mitapivat or 
changes in efficacy of the coadministered medicinal 
products (See SmPC Section 4.5). Potential drug-
drug interactions should be considered whenever 
beginning or discontinuing treatment with mitapivat 
or other medicinal products concomitantly 
administered with mitapivat. 
In addition, there is a statement in the SmPC Section 
4.5 that mitapivat is primarily metabolised by 
CYP3A4 and is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp). 
Mitapivat induces CYP3A4 and may also induce 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and uridine 
diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 
(UGT1A1). Mitapivat may inhibit CYP3A4. 
Mitapivat may induce and inhibit P-gp (see SmPC 
Section 5.2). 
In addition, the SmPC Section 5.2 states that 
mitapivat exhibits pH-dependent solubility. High 
solubility is observed up to pH 5.5, with decreasing 
solubility at higher pH which may decrease mitapivat 
absorption. 
Effect of Other Medicinal Products on Mitapivat 
Inhibitors of CYP3A4:  
A clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study was 
conducted to assess the effect of a strong CYP3A4 
and P-gp inhibitor (itraconazole) on the 
pharmacokinetics of mitapivat (Study 
AG348-C-012). Systemic exposure of mitapivat 
increased in the presence of itraconazole compared 
with mitapivat alone, with the geometric mean AUC 
from hour 0 to the last time point (AUC0-t), AUC 
from hour 0 to infinity (AUC∞), and Cmax ratios of 
mitapivat in the presence and absence of itraconazole 
being 4.7, 4.9, and 1.7, respectively. These results 
show that coadministration of mitapivat with 
CYP3A4 inhibitors increased mitapivat plasma 
concentrations (Module 2.7.2, Section 2.4.1). Based 
on an exposure/response analysis, increased 
mitapivat plasma concentrations may increase the

irreversible). In addition, mitapivat appears to be 
a weak inhibitor of uridine 5ʹ-diphospho-
glucuronosyl transferases (UGTs) 1A3, 1A4, 
and 1A9, with IC50 values of 15.4 ±0.9, 
60.6 ±8.5, and 22.6 ±5.8 μM, respectively 
(Report AG348-N-090). Mitapivat also appears 
to be a weak inducer of human CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4/5, and 
UGT1A1 at clinically relevant concentrations 
(Reports AG348-N-055-R1 and AG348-N-103).

risk of insomnia. The Pyrukynd SmPC Section 4.5 
states that the concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors 
with Pyrukynd should be avoided (see SmPC Section 
4.4). If concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inhibitor is 
unavoidable, patients should be monitored for 
increased risk of insomnia (see SmPC Section 4.2).  
Inducers of CYP3A4  
A clinical DDI study was conducted to assess the 
effect of a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampicin) on 
the pharmacokinetics of mitapivat (Study AG348-C-
012). Systemic exposure of mitapivat in the presence 
of rifampicin was lower compared with that of 
mitapivat alone, with the geometric mean AUC0-t, 
AUC∞, and Cmax ratios of mitapivat in the presence 
and absence of rifampicin being 0.09, 0.09, and 0.23, 
respectively (Module 2.7.2, Section 2.2.1.5.2). This 
shows that coadministration of mitapivat with 
CYP3A4 inducers decreased mitapivat plasma 
concentrations. Decreased mitapivat plasma 
concentrations may reduce the efficacy of mitapivat. 
The Pyrukynd SmPC Section 4.5 states that the 
concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers with Pyrukynd 
should be avoided (See SmPC Section 4.4). If 
concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inducer is 
unavoidable, patients should be monitored for 
reduced efficacy of mitapivat. 
Inhibitors of transporters:  
Mitapivat is not a substrate for BCRP, OATP1B1, or 
OATP1B3; hence, coadministration with strong 
inhibitors of these transporters is not expected to alter 
mitapivat disposition. Mitapivat is a P-gp substrate, 
so it is possible that strong inhibitors of P-gp may 
alter the disposition of mitapivat. In Study 
AG348-C-009, the ADME and absolute 
bioavailability of mitapivat were investigated in 
8 healthy male subjects after oral administration of a 
single 120-mg dose of [14C]mitapivat and 
concomitant single intravenous 0.1 mg microdose of 
[13C6]mitapivat. The study showed that the total 
(mean ± SD) recovery of administered radioactive 
dose over a period of 240 hours was 89.1% ±2.20%, 
with 49.6% ±3.99% in the urine and 39.6% ±3.38% 
in the feces. Most (81.9%) of the administered 
radioactivity was recovered in the first 96 hours 
postdose. The mean absolute bioavailability of 
mitapivat estimated from this study was 72.7%. The 
systemic clearance of mitapivat after intravenous 
dosing was 9.53 L/h. Because unchanged mitapivat 
accounted for <1% of the dose in feces, the derived 
fraction absorbed (Fa) is assumed to be 0.99. Based

on these data, the Fa•Fg (Fg is the fraction of drug 
passing though the gut wall without metabolism) was 
calculated to be >0.8. Because mitapivat has a high 
absorption fraction in the absence of strong P-gp 
inhibitors (Fa•Fg >0.8), it can be presumed that there 
will be no more than a 20% increase in exposure 
(AUC) of mitapivat due to P-gp inhibition in the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract (Module 2.7.2, Section 
3.3.1.3).  
The SmPC Section 4.5 states that based on in vitro 
data, mitapivat may induce and inhibit P-gp (see 
SmPC Section 5.2) and may alter systemic exposure 
of substrates (eg, dabigatran etexilate) of this 
transporter. Concomitant use of Pyrukynd with 
substrates of P-gp was not evaluated in a clinical 
drug-drug interaction study. Alternative therapies 
that are not P-gp substrates should be considered 
during treatment with Pyrukynd (see SmPC Section 
4.4). If co-administration of Pyrukynd with P-gp 
substrates is unavoidable, patients should be carefully 
monitored especially for those substrates with a 
narrow therapeutic index (eg, colchicine, digoxin). 
Gastric acid–reducing agents:  
Mitapivat exhibits pH-dependent solubility but has 
high solubility up to pH 5.5. Proton-pump inhibitors 
(except for ranitidine) and H2-receptor antagonists 
do not increase gastric pH above 5.5.  Based on this, 
the exposure of mitapivat is not expected to be 
altered by gastric acid-reducing agents. The SmPC 
Section 4.5 states that mitapivat exhibits pH-
dependent solubility (see SmPC Section 5.2) and 
coadministration with gastric acid reducing agents 
(e.g., famotidine) may decrease mitapivat absorption 
(see SmPC Section 4.4).  Concomitant use of 
Pyrukynd with medicinal products that elevate the 
gastric pH was not evaluated in a clinical drug-drug 
interaction study. If concomitant use of gastric acid-
reducing agents is unavoidable, patients should be 
monitored for reduced efficacy of mitapivat. The 
SmPC Section 5.2 states that mitapivat exhibits pH-
dependent solubility. High solubility is observed up 
to pH 5.5, with decreasing solubility at higher pH 
which may decrease mitapivat absorption. 
Effect of mitapivat on other medicinal products: 
In vitro studies suggest that mitapivat has the 
potential to induce human CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19 CYP3A4 and UGT1A1. The 
Pyrukynd SmPC Section 4.4 states that mitapivat 
may decrease the systemic exposure of hormonal

contraceptives that are sensitive substrates of 
cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) (eg 
ethinylestradiol) (see SmPC Section 4.5). Women of 
childbearing potential should be counselled regarding 
the use of additional or alternative contraception 
methods (see SmPC Section 4.6). 
The SmPC Section 4.5 states that mitapivat induces 
and may inhibit CYP3A4 and co-administration with 
sensitive CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. midazolam) may 
alter systemic exposure of these medicinal products. 
Concomitant use of Pyrukynd with substrates of this 
enzyme was not evaluated in a clinical drug-drug 
interaction study. Alternative therapies that are not 
sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 should be considered 
during treatment with Pyrukynd (see SmPC Section 
4.4). If co-administration of Pyrukynd with sensitive 
CYP3A4 substrates is unavoidable, patients should 
be carefully monitored especially for those substrates 
with a narrow therapeutic index (eg, alfentanil, 
carbamazepine, cyclosporine, ergotamine, fentanyl, 
pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus). In 
addition, the SmPC Section 4.5 states mitapivat may 
alter the systemic exposure of hormonal 
contraceptives that are sensitive substrates of 
CYP3A4 (eg, ethinylestradiol) (see SmPC Section 
4.4) and may affect their efficacy (see SmPC Section 
4.6). The SmPC Section 4.6 states that mitapivat may 
decrease the systemic exposure of hormonal 
contraceptives that are sensitive substrates of 
CYP3A4 (see SmPC Sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Additional or alternative methods of contraception 
should be considered. 
A clinical DDI study with midazolam to assess the 
magnitude of interaction between mitapivat and 
CYP3A4 substrates will be conducted as a post-
authorization measure (REC).  
Based on in vitro data, mitapivat may induce 
UGT1A1, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and 
CYP2C19 (see SmPC Section 5.2) and may decrease 
systemic exposure to substrates of these enzymes (eg, 
irinotecan [UGT1A1]; bupropion [CYP2B6]; 
omeprazole [CYP2C19]; repaglinide [CYP2C8]; 
warfarin [CYP2C9]). Concomitant use of Pyrukynd 
with substrates of these enzymes was not evaluated 
in a clinical drug-drug interaction study. Alternative 
therapies that are not UGT1A1 substrates or sensitive 
substrates of CYP2B6 or CYP2C should be 
considered during treatment with Pyrukynd (see 
SmPC Section 4.4). If co-administration is 
unavoidable, patients should be monitored for loss of 
therapeutic effect of substates of these enzymes, 
especially for those with a narrow therapeutic index 
(eg, irinotecan [UGT1A1]; cyclophosphamide 
[CYP2B6]; valproic acid [CYP2C19]; paclitaxel

noted in the SmPC Section 4.5. 
Based on the Cmax at a 50-mg dose of mitapivat and 
the IC50 values calculated from in vitro data, the risk 
of DDIs with substrates of OATP1B1, OAT3, 
MATE1, and OCT2 is expected to be low.  
Drug-drug interactions is not considered important 
for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP. Drug-drug interactions is a known risk that 
does not affect the benefit-risk profile (Module 
SVII.1.1). 
Consistent with findings in nonclinical studies, mild 
to moderate GI disorders have been observed in 
subjects with PK deficiency who received mitapivat. 
In the clinical development program, GI disorders 
AEs were reported for 78 subjects (78 of 155, 50.3%) 
with PK deficiency, and 41 subjects (41 of 155, 
26.5%) had GI disorders AEs assessed as related to 
treatment by the Investigator (Table 18.3.1-10.6b, 
Table 19-3.1). There were 3 (3 of 155, 1.9%) subjects 
who had events of Grade 3 severity, all not related to 
mitapivat (Table 19-3.1). In Study AG348-C-006, 
during the 24-week period, GI disorders AEs were 
reported for 17 subjects (17 of 39, 43.6%) with PK 
deficiency who received placebo and 14 subjects (14 
of 40, 35.0%) with PK deficiency who received 
mitapivat (Table 18.3.1-10.6a). 
Gastrointestinal disorders were observed in humans; 
however, they were generally mild in severity, 
nonserious, and resolved without treatment 
discontinuation. The SmPC Section 4.8 states Nausea 
is a very common adverse reaction. Gastrointestinal 
disorders is a potential risk not considered important 
for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP. Gastrointestinal disorders is a potential risk 
with minimal clinical impact on patients (Module 
SVII.1.1). 
The negative 3T3 assay indicates that mitapivat does 
not form reactive species after absorption of 
UV-visible light. Mitapivat is not considered to be 
phototoxic and therefore phototoxicity is not 
considered a risk for mitapivat.

(55%), opiate κ (58%), opiate µ (59%), and 
serotonin 5HT4 (55%). Based on these results, 
the following IC50 determinations were made: 
histamine H2 (6.4 µM), histamine H3 
(1.25 µM), serotonin 5HT4 (4.9 µM), 
muscarinic M2 (4.4 µM), muscarinic M3 
(5.4 µM), muscarinic M4 (1.4 µM) (Reports 
AG348-N-007-R1 and AG348-N-015-R1). In 
follow-up functional assays to determine agonist 
and antagonist activity against all receptors for 
which IC50 determinations were made, mitapivat 
had no functional activity against any of the 
receptors except for the histamine H3 receptor, 
for which antagonist/inverse agonist activity was 
noted (antagonist IC50 activity of 0.102 µM and 
inverse agonist half-maximal effective 
concentration (EC50) activity of 0.012 µM) 
(Report AG348-N-008-R1).  
Changes in sex hormones due to aromatase 
inhibition: In an endocrine panel, significant 
results (percent inhibition >50%) at 10 μM were 
limited to aromatase (CYP19; 91%). Mitapivat 
was assessed for the potential to inhibit 
aromatase from human recombinant insect cells, 
human placental microsomes, and rat ovarian 
microsomes (Reports AG348-N-052-R1 and 
AG348-N-076-R1). Mitapivat inhibited human 
placental aromatase (IC50 2.05 µM) and rat 
ovarian aromatase (IC50 0.493 µM). 
Relevance to Human Use 
wakefulness and cognition (Schwartz, 2010). 
Therefore, histamine H3 antagonism/inverse agonism 
may lead to AEs of insomnia. In the clinical 
development program, insomnia AEs were reported 
for 51 subjects (51 of 155, 32.9%) with PK 
deficiency, and 39 subjects (39 of 155, 25.2%) had 
insomnia AEs assessed as related to treatment by the 
Investigator (Table 18.3.1-10.6b, Table 19-3.1). 
There were 2 (2 of 155, 1.3%) subjects that had 
events that were Grade 3 in severity (Table 19-3.1). 
In Study AG348-C-003, there was an apparent 
relationship between increased dose and occurrence 
of insomnia AEs, with events of insomnia occurring 
more frequently in subjects who received mitapivat 
>50 mg BID (Table 18.3.1-10.6a, 
Table 18.3.1-10.6b). In Study AG348-C-006, during 
the 24-week period, insomnia AEs were reported for 
7 subjects (7 of 39, 17.9%) with PK deficiency who 
received placebo and 6 subjects (6 of 40, 15.0%) with 
PK deficiency who received mitapivat 
(Table 18.3.1-10.6a). 
Insomnia AEs were observed in humans; however, 
they were generally mild in severity, nonserious, and 
resolved without treatment discontinuation. Insomnia 
is an identified risk not considered important for 
inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP. 
Insomnia is an identified risk with minimal clinical 
impact on patients (Module SVII.1.1). 
Changes in sex hormones due to aromatase 
inhibition: In male subjects treated with mitapivat in 
Study AG348-C-002, compared with placebo-treated 
male subjects, the aromatase-dependent hormone 
studies demonstrated an increase in total and free 
testosterone mean serum concentrations and 
decreased concentrations of estradiol and estrone at 
all doses of mitapivat, including the lowest dose of 
15 mg BID. Changes in aromatase-dependent 
hormone levels in the male subjects treated with 
mitapivat are consistent with changes in sex 
hormones due to off-target aromatase inhibition and 
were reversible within 14 days upon cessation of 
dosing (CSR AG348-C-002, Section 12.5.5). 
In clinical studies in subjects with PK deficiency, 
subjects were monitored for potential clinical effects 
of changes in sex hormones due to aromatase 
inhibition by the collection of serial assessments of 
sex hormone levels. For male subjects during the 
cumulative period, a decrease in estrone and estradiol 
levels and increase in testosterone and free 
testosterone levels have been observed between

Relevance to Human Use 
baseline and the on-treatment period (Module 2.7.4, 
Section 2.1.6.2.1). 
A Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) Version 23.1 pooled list of Preferred 
Terms (PTs) of endocrinological interest 
(Table SVII.4) was used to search for AEs potentially 
due to sex hormone changes caused by aromatase 
inhibition. In the clinical development program, a 
total of 25 subjects (25 of 155, 16.1%) with PK 
deficiency had at least 1 AE of endocrinological 
interest, and 11 subjects (11 of 155, 7.1%) had AEs 
that were treatment related as reported by the 
Investigator (Table 18.3.1-10.6b, Table 19-3.1). 
There were no Grade ≥3 AEs of endocrinological 
interest or SAEs of endocrinological interest in 
studies with mitapivat (Table 19-3.1, Table 19-4.1). 
In Study AG348-C-006, during the 24-week period, 
AEs of endocrinological interest were reported for 
4 subjects (4 of 39, 10.3%) with PK deficiency who 
were receiving placebo and 4 subjects (4 of 40, 
10.0%) with PK deficiency receiving mitapivat 
(Table 18.3.1-10.6a). 
Changes in sex hormones is an identified risk not 
considered important for inclusion in the list of safety 
concerns in the RMP. Changes in sex hormones is an 
identified risk with minimal clinical impact on 
patients (Module SVII.1.1). 
Bone mineral density decrease due to aromatase 
inhibition: Bone mineral density measured by DXA 
was analyzed in Studies AG348-C-003, 
AG348-C-006, AG348-C-007, and AG348-C-011 as 
the worst on-treatment T-score compared with 
baseline T-score. No clinically meaningful changes 
in BMD have observed in subjects with PK 
deficiency who received mitapivat. Most subjects 
remained within the same baseline category during 
treatment (Module 2.7.4, Section 2.1.6.2.2).  
Bone mineral density decrease due to aromatase 
inhibition is a potential risk not considered important 
for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP. Bone mineral density decrease due to 
aromatase inhibition is a potential risk with minimal 
clinical impact on patients (Module SVII.1.1). 
The safety concerns from nonclinical data are summarized above based on whether the 
findings have been confirmed by clinical data (identified risk), have not been adequately 
refuted by clinical data and/or are of unknown significance (potential risk), or require further 
research (missing information). Important risks are identified risks or potential risks that 
could have an impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product or have implications for

Part II: Module SIII – Clinical trial exposure 
The mitapivat clinical development program was initiated in March 2014 in the US and in 
July 2015 in Europe. As of the data lock point of 19 November 2020, a total of 16 clinical 
studies are completed or ongoing, including 4 studies in subjects with PK deficiency, 1 study 
in subjects with non–transfusion-dependent thalassemia, 2 Investigator-sponsored studies in 
sickle cell disease (SCD), and 9 clinical pharmacology studies in healthy subjects. A 
cumulative total of 444 adult subjects have been exposed to mitapivat in Agios-sponsored 
studies, including 155 subjects with PK deficiency, 269 healthy subjects, and 20 subjects with 
thalassemia. In addition to the 444 subjects who have been exposed to mitapivat in 
Agios-sponsored studies, 14 subjects with stable SCD have been enrolled in ongoing

Mitapivat 
The primary studies providing evidence of safety and efficacy of mitapivat in the proposed 
indication for the treatment of PK deficiency in adult patients are Studies AG348-C-006 and 
AG348-C-007, with supportive evidence provided from Studies AG348-C-003 and 
AG348-C-011.  Study AG348-C-008 (Peak Registry) will also provide supportive evidence 
for patients that are receiving mitapivat.   
Study AG348-C-003 is an ongoing Phase 2, open-label, 2-arm, multinational, randomized, 
dose-ranging, safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical 
activity study in adult subjects with PK deficiency, in which mitapivat was administered as a 
single agent.  
Study AG348-C-006 is a completed Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and health-related quality of life study in adult subjects 
with PK deficiency, in which mitapivat was administered as a single agent. 
Study AG348-C-007 is a completed Phase 3, single-arm, efficacy and safety study in 
regularly transfused adult subjects with PK deficiency, in which mitapivat was administered 
as a single agent. 
Study AG348-C-008 is an ongoing Agios-sponsored, global, retrospective and prospective, 
longitudinal observational study of pediatric and adult patients with PK deficiency (Category 
3 PASS study, See Table III.1). 
Study AG348-C-011 is an ongoing Phase 3, multinational, open-label extension study open to 
subjects who have completed Study AG348-C-006 or AG348-C-007 and meet all other 
eligibility criteria for Study AG348-C-011 (Category 3 PASS study, See Table III.1). 
A total of 155 subjects with PK deficiency were administered mitapivat in Studies 
AG348-C-003, AG348-C-006, AG348-C-007, and AG348-C-011 at doses ranging from 5 mg 
3 times a week to 300 mg BID. Analyses of the data from the 155 subjects with PK 
deficiency across all doses administered are considered pertinent to the evaluation of the 
safety profile for the intended indication. 
Exposure data for mitapivat across the PK deficiency clinical development program are 
presented in Table SIII.2 to Table SIII.6. The pooled analyses in studies in subjects with PK 
deficiency include data as of 19 November 2020, which serves as the data lock point for this 
RMP. Final data are provided from the pivotal studies (Studies AG348-C-006 and AG348-C-
007) in subjects with PK deficiency. Data from the ongoing extension Study 011 and the 
ongoing Extension Period of Study AG348-C-003 are based on interim data cuts of 12 
November 2020 and 28 August 2020, respectively.

In the pivotal studies AG348-C-006 and AG348-C-007, the important exclusion criteria and 
implications with respect to predicting the safety of mitapivat in the postmarketing setting are 
presented below.  
Subjects who are homozygous for the R479H mutation or have 2 nonmissense mutations 
without the presence of another missense mutation in the PKLR gene, as determined per 
the genotyping performed by the study central genotyping laboratory 
Reason for exclusion: 
Subjects who were homozygous for the R479H mutation or had 2 nonmissense mutations 
without the presence of another missense mutation in the PKLR gene were excluded to 
provide an enriched population with the best opportunity to determine treatment response in 
an ultra-rare disease population.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale:  
While for clinical trial enrichment and stratification purposes, patients are sometimes 
categorized according to their type of gene mutation (ie, missense/missense, 
missense/nonmissense, nonmissense/nonmissense), there are some important limitations to 
this categorization. For example, some missense mutations might result in marked protein 
instability or functional inactivity, and some nonmissense mutations might not have a 
significant impact on protein structure (Bianchi et al, 2020). In addition, a possible effect of 
yet unidentified genetic modifiers on the expression of pyruvate kinase might contribute to 
the clinical variability and could affect potential response to a pyruvate kinase activating

molecule. Current understanding of the genetic heterogeneity of PK deficiency supports that 
an effect of mitapivat cannot be excluded based on genotype or gene mutation category 
alone, and that there is a potential for benefit in the real-world setting for all patients 
regardless of genotype classification. While genotyping for PKLR is important to verify 
disease status, it will not be essential for the safe use of the drug while clinical benefit is 
being determined in adult patients with PK deficiency in the real-world setting given that 
mitapivat has been demonstrated to have a manageable safety profile in patients with PK 
deficiency, regardless of mutation status. Treatment should not be limited by gene mutation 
status; this is not considered missing information.  
Subjects with cardiac dysrhythmias judged as clinically significant by the Investigator 
or QTcF >450 ms except for subjects with right or left bundle branch block 
Reason for exclusion: 
Subjects with cardiac dysrhythmias judged as clinically significant by the Investigator or with 
QTcF >450 ms were excluded because development of studies evaluating drug effects on 
QT/QTc interval in healthy subjects was ongoing during the start of the pivotal trials. 
Including these subjects could have interfered with the safety and efficacy evaluation of 
mitapivat. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale:  
In nonclinical studies, mitapivat was determined to have low potential for inhibition of the 
hERG current (Module SII). In Study AG348-C-004, the results predicted a mean increase in 
QTcF at the geometric mean Cmax for the supratherapeutic dose of 200 mg of 3.19 ms and 
90% CI upper bound of 5.65 ms. In Study AG348-C-014, based on a concentration-QTc 
analysis, a QTcF effect (∆∆QTcF) exceeding 10 ms could be excluded within the observed 
plasma concentrations of mitapivat and AGI-8702 up to ~14,200 and ~689 ng/mL, 
respectively. The available nonclinical and clinical data indicate that mitapivat does not have 
a significant QT/QTc prolongation effect, as the results from this study showed that the 
effects of mitapivat and its metabolite AGI-8702 on QTcF change from baseline were well 
below the 10-ms threshold established by the ICH E14 guideline (US FDA, 2005) and 
subsequent E14 Q&A (R3) (ICH, 2015).  
Subjects with clinically symptomatic cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. Prior 
cholecystectomy is not exclusionary. Subjects with symptomatic cholelithiasis or 
cholecystitis may be rescreened once the disorder has been treated and clinical 
symptoms have resolved.  
Reason for exclusion: 
Pyruvate kinase deficiency can cause severe, ongoing hemolysis that can potentially lead to 
intrahepatic bile duct obstruction and ultimately progressive cholestatic liver injury. 
Including subjects with clinically symptomatic cholelithiasis or cholecystitis may have 
affected the safety assessment of mitapivat.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale:  
By nature of the indication, patients with PK deficiency are likely to develop gallbladder 
disease because during times of hemolysis, increasing amounts of indirect bilirubin are 
produced, leading to elevated plasma bilirubin values and subsequent complications of

Mitapivat 
cholelithiasis and cholecystitis. In clinical practice, mitapivat treatment may not be delayed in 
patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis or cholecystitis given the potential benefit of 
treatment for the patient. It is likely that in clinical practice, some patients will develop 
cholelithiasis or cholecystitis, but this should not preclude mitapivat administration because 
by restoring the underlying defect and reducing hemolysis, mitapivat reduces indirect 
bilirubin. In the clinical development program, significant improvements in indirect bilirubin 
levels were observed and maintained in subjects with PK deficiency receiving mitapivat 
(Module 2.5, Table 12). Treatment should not be limited by clinically symptomatic 
cholelithiasis or cholecystitis; this is not considered missing information.  
Subjects with a diagnosis of any other congenital or acquired blood disorder or any 
other hemolytic process, except mild alloimmunization, as a consequence of transfusion 
therapy. Genetic findings that in isolation are predicted to be insufficient to explain the 
observed clinical phenotype may be allowed (eg, heterozygous status for certain 
recessive RBC disorders). 
Reason for exclusion: 
Including these subjects could have interfered with the safety and efficacy evaluation of 
mitapivat in the study because the other congenital or acquired blood disorder may confound 
the clinical and laboratory assessment of the study subjects. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale:  
The efficacy and safety of mitapivat is not expected to be altered in patients with PK 
deficiency who also have other congenital or acquired blood disorders. Available data 
indicate that because mitapivat specifically targets the pyruvate kinase enzyme, the potential 
for clinically relevant interactions with other congenital or acquired blood disorders is low. 
Mitapivat has been administered and well tolerated in 1 subject who was diagnosed with both 
PK deficiency and sickle cell trait in Study AG348-C-003.  
Subjects who have an active infection requiring the use of parenteral antimicrobial 
agents or Grade ≥3 in severity (per National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]) within 2 months before the first 
dose of study drug  
Reason for exclusion: 
Infection is one of the most commonly reported hemolytic triggers in subjects with PK 
deficiency. Including subjects who had an active infection requiring the use of parenteral 
antimicrobial agents or Grade ≥3 in severity within 2 months before the first dose of study 
drug could have interfered with the evaluation of mitapivat in the study because hemolysis 
caused by the recent or active infection may have affected the subjects’ baseline hematologic 
lab parameters or impacted the subjects’ safety.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale:  
In clinical practice, mitapivat treatment may not be delayed in patients with an active 
infection, given the potential benefit of treatment for the patient. Mitapivat may be used in 
patients with severe infections because infections are common complications in patients with 
PK deficiency who have had a splenectomy (Grace et al, 2019; Rider et al, 2011b). Infections 
are likely to occur in clinical practice, as was found in the clinical development program. In 
Confidential

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Mitapivat 
the clinical development program, a total of 96 subjects (96 of 155, 61.9%) with PK 
deficiency treated with mitapivat experienced an AE of infection (Table 18.3.1-2.1b). Of 
these subjects, 9 subjects (9 of 155, 5.8%) reported infection AEs with a severity of Grade ≥3 
(Table 18.3.1-2.2b). Infection is recognized as a common comorbidity in patients with 
hemolytic anemias who have been previously splenectomized, requiring patients to undergo 
prolonged prophylactic antibiotic therapy and maintain strict vaccination compliance 
(Module SI). It is likely that in clinical practice, some patients will develop infections, but 
this should not preclude mitapivat administration because mitapivat is not an 
immunosuppressive agent and was not associated with development or clinically meaningful 
changes in the severity or rate of infections over time in the clinical development program. 
Based on the available data of mitapivat use in subjects with active infections in the clinical 
development program, treatment should not be limited by active infection requiring the use of 
parenteral antimicrobial agents or Grade ≥3 in severity; this is not considered missing 
information. 
Subjects with a current splenectomy scheduled during the study drug period or who 
have undergone splenectomy within 12 months before signing informed consent  
Reason for exclusion: 
Subjects with a current splenectomy scheduled during the study drug period or who had 
undergone splenectomy within 12 months before signing informed consent were excluded 
because their inclusion could have affected the safety assessment of mitapivat in the clinical 
study. Furthermore, because splenectomy usually results in a rise in Hb of 1‐3 g/dL in 
patients with PK deficiency (Zanella et al, 2007; Zanella et al, 2005), a splenectomy 
scheduled during the study drug period or one that was undergone within 12 months before 
signing informed consent could have confounded the efficacy assessment of mitapivat.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale:  
A total of 118 of 155 subjects with PK deficiency (76.1%) treated with mitapivat in the 
clinical development program had a history of splenectomy (Table 19-2.3). Splenectomy is a 
procedure commonly performed in patients with PK deficiency because it has been shown to 
be an effective therapy for decreasing or eliminating the need for regular transfusions (Grace 
et al, 2019; Grace et al, 2015; Zanella et al, 2007; Zanella et al, 2005). Therefore, it is likely 
that in clinical practice, some patients will have current or recent history of a splenectomy 
procedure, but that should not preclude mitapivat administration because mitapivat was not 
associated with a different safety profile in patients with or without a history of splenectomy. 
Based on the available data of mitapivat use in subjects with a history of splenectomy in the 
clinical development program, treatment should not be limited by recent splenectomy status; 
this is not considered missing information. 
Subjects who are currently receiving medications that are strong inhibitors of CYP 
3A4, strong inducers of CYP3A4, strong inhibitors of P-gp, or digoxin (a P-gp sensitive 
substrate medication) that have not been stopped for a duration of at least 5 days or a 
time frame equivalent to 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose of study 
drug 
Reason for exclusion: 
At the time of initiating the pivotal clinical studies, metabolism and transporter studies had 
been conducted only in vitro. In vitro, mitapivat is a substrate of P-gp; therefore, including 
Confidential 
47 
Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Mitapivat 
patients who required strong inhibitors of P-gp in the study could have increased the exposure 
of mitapivat. Additionally, mitapivat is a P-gp inhibitor, which could have increased the 
exposure of digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate. Additionally, in vitro studies suggested that 
mitapivat was primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, so mitapivat pharmacokinetics may be 
affected by strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and strong inducers of CYP3A4. Therefore, 
including patients who required strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or strong inducers of CYP3A4 
in the clinical study could have affected the safety and efficacy of mitapivat, respectively. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale:  
In parallel with the pivotal trials, clinical DDI and ADME studies provided additional 
information on the risk for DDIs with mitapivat. Study AG348-C-012, an open-label, fixed-
sequence study in healthy adult subjects, was conducted to evaluate the effect of multiple 
doses of itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor, and rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 
inducer, on the pharmacokinetics and safety of mitapivat. The study found that systemic 
exposure of mitapivat increased in the presence of itraconazole and decreased in the presence 
of rifampicin compared with mitapivat alone. Study AG348-C-009 demonstrated that 
mitapivat has a high absorption fraction in the absence of strong P-gp inhibitors (Fa•Fg >0.8), 
so it can be presumed that there will be no more than 20% increase in exposure (AUC) of 
mitapivat due to P-gp inhibition in the GI tract. The new clinical ADME data from Study 
AG348-C-009 were evaluated after the pivotal studies had finished enrollment, so the 
exclusion criterion was retained but no longer applies because risk of DDIs with P-gp 
inhibitors is expected to be low. Based on this new clinical DDI and ADME studies, this is 
not considered missing information. 
Subjects who are currently receiving anabolic steroids, including testosterone 
preparations, within 28 days before the first dose of study drug 
Reason for exclusion: 
Mitapivat inhibits human aromatase activity; therefore, mitapivat may increase total and free 
testosterone mean serum concentrations and decrease concentrations of estradiol and estrone. 
Including patients who were currently receiving anabolic steroids, including testosterone 
preparations, within 28 days before the first dose of study drug could have affected the safety 
assessment of mitapivat, specifically regarding changes in aromatase-dependent hormone 
levels and downstream effects on BMD. Furthermore, as testosterone stimulates 
erythropoiesis (Fried and Gurney, 1968), use of anabolic steroids, including testosterone 
preparations, within 28 days before the first dose of study drug could have confounded the 
efficacy assessment of mitapivat. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale:  
The efficacy and safety of mitapivat are not expected to be altered in patients taking anabolic 
steroids, including testosterone preparations, as testosterone levels have been observed to 
remain in the normal range for most subjects treated with mitapivat. Available data from 
studies in healthy adults and adults with PK deficiency show no reports of AEs that would be 
suggestive of a signal of clinical consequences associated with hormone changes due to 
off-target changes in sex hormones due to aromatase inhibition. Furthermore, BMD measured 
by DXA was analyzed in Studies AG348-C-003, AG348-C-006, AG348-C-007, and AG348-
C-011 as the worst on-treatment T-score compared with baseline T-score. No clinically

Mitapivat 
meaningful changes in BMD were observed in subjects who received mitapivat. Most 
subjects remained within the same baseline category during treatment (Table 18.3.7-2). 
Mitapivat is not recognized to cause significant changes in sex hormones due to aromatase 
inhibition that may lead to BMD decrease and subsequent AEs (Module SVII.1.1). Based on 
available endocrine data in subjects treated with mitapivat, treatment should not be limited by 
concurrent or recent use of anabolic steroids, including testosterone preparations; this is not 
considered missing information. 
SIV.2 Limitations to detect adverse reactions in clinical trial development

The clinical development program is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions such 
as rare adverse reactions, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those caused by prolonged 
exposure.

Patients with relevant 
comorbidities:  
•  Patients with hepatic 
impairment 
Study inclusion criteria 
required subjects to have 
adequate organ function 
defined as meeting the 
following criteria:  
Serum AST ≤2.5× the ULN, 
unless the increased AST is 
assessed by the Investigator as 
due to hemolysis and/or 
hepatic iron deposition, and 
ALT ≤2.5×ULN, unless the 
increased ALT is assessed by 
the Investigator as due to 
hepatic iron deposition. 
Either normal or elevated 
levels of serum bilirubin. In 
subjects with serum bilirubin 
>ULN, the elevation must be 
attributed to hemolysis with or 
without Gilbert’s syndrome 
and must not be attributed to 
cholecystitis, 
choledocholithiasis, biliary 
obstruction, or hepatocellular 
disease. 
Use of mitapivat in patients with hepatic impairment has not been evaluated 
in the clinical development program.  
Hepatic elimination plays an important role in the clearance of mitapivat. 
The metabolic stability of mitapivat was evaluated in rat, dog, monkey, and 
human liver microsomes (Report AG348-N-066-R1). After 45 minutes of 
incubation with mitapivat (1 µM) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
phosphate (NADPH) (2 mM), liver microsomal intrinsic clearance (Clint) of 
mitapivat was 32.1, 22.8, 18.1, and 6.82 L/hr/kg in rats, dogs, monkeys, and 
humans, respectively. The hepatic clearance calculated based on the CLint 
was 2.99, 1.75, 2.27, and 1.05 L/hr/kg in rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans, 
respectively. The hepatic extraction ratio was estimated to be 0.91, 0.92, 
0.87, and 0.85 in rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans, respectively. These data 
suggest that mitapivat liver metabolism clearance was high (Module 2.6.4, 
Section 5.1.1.2). 
Mitapivat is known to be metabolized after oral administration with 
approximately 40% and 50% of administered radioactivity in the human 
ADME study appearing as metabolites in the feces and urine, respectively 
(Module 2.7.2, Section 3.1.4). Therefore, there is a potential for hepatic 
impairment to affect mitapivat exposure. 
Use of mitapivat in subjects with hepatic impairment has not been 
evaluated in the clinical development program. By nature of the indication, 
patients with PK deficiency are likely to experience chronic and acute 
hemolysis that may lead to increases in unconjugated bilirubin (Module SI). 
Due to this, analysis of the effect of hepatic parameters such as bilirubin on 
mitapivat PK is limited. The effect of hepatic parameters on mitapivat PK 
was assessed as part of a population pharmacokinetics analysis. Most 
subjects in the dataset had normal AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP) at baseline. No apparent difference in steady-state AUC was 
observed in subjects with normal AST, ALT, or ALP levels versus those 
with elevated levels. Most subjects with PK deficiency in the dataset had 
elevated total bilirubin level at baseline; nevertheless, steady-state AUC 
appeared to be similar among the subjects with PK deficiency with total 
bilirubin at the ranges between 1 to 2×ULN, 2 to 3×ULN, and >3×ULN 
(Module 2.7.2, Section 3.2.2). Additionally, analysis of the degree of 
hepatic impairment in the PK deficiency clinical development program is 
unavailable as conventional hepatic dysfunction stratification tools (Child-
Pugh, National Cancer Institute-Organ Dysfunction Working Group, and 
model for end-stage liver disease) all use bilirubin as a criterion of their 
classifications. Use of mitapivat in patients with hepatic impairment is 
considered missing information (Module SVII.3.2).

(0.742 if female) × (1.212 if African American) (SI units) where Scr is SI units of

Results from the human ADME study showed that <3% of the dose of 
mitapivat is eliminated unchanged in the urine and that renal clearance 
accounts for 3.4% of total clearance (Module 2.7.2, Section 3.2.1). These 
data suggest that renal impairment would not be expected to have a 
clinically relevant impact on mitapivat exposure.  
The effect of renal impairment on mitapivat pharmacokinetics was assessed 
as part of the population pharmacokinetics analyses. Steady-state AUC was 
similar between subjects with normal renal functions, mild renal 
impairment, and for a limited number of subjects with moderate renal 
impairment. No data are available in subjects with severe renal impairment

Current understanding of the genetic heterogeneity of PK deficiency 
supports that an effect of mitapivat cannot be excluded based on genotype

the real-world setting for all patients regardless of genotype classification 
While genotyping for PKLR is important to verify disease status, it will not 
be essential for the safe use of the drug while clinical benefit is being 
determined in adult patients with PK deficiency in the real-world setting 
given that mitapivat has been demonstrated to have a manageable safety

Use in pediatric patients 
Pediatric subjects were 
excluded from the clinical 
development program. 
Exposure 
Use of mitapivat in pediatric subjects has not been evaluated in the clinical 
development program. The current proposed indication for mitapivat is for 
the treatment of PK deficiency in adult patients. 
One accidental exposure to mitapivat has been reported in a pediatric 
subject; 
100 mg BID for 6 days 
. The subject received mitapivat 
. The subject 
experienced AEs of Headache, Vomiting, and Rash pustular during 
mitapivat administration. All the AEs were low grade (Grade 1) and 
resolved shortly after mitapivat discontinuation. The child’s exposure in 
this case of 100 mg BID is thought to be similar to the exposure of a 60-kg 
adult receiving 300 mg BID when looking at the exposure on a milligram 
per kilogram basis, 
 (CSR AG348-C-010, Appendix 16.1.8). The 300-mg BID dose 
was well tolerated in adults for 6 months in Study AG348-C-003 with the 
most frequently reported AEs being headache and insomnia.

 Changes in sex hormones (Identified risk) 
Changes in sex hormones is an identified risk associated with mitapivat treatment based on 
nonclinical and clinical safety findings (Module SII). 
In nonclinical studies, mitapivat inhibited human placental and rat ovarian aromatase with an 
IC50 of 2.05 and 0.493 µM, respectively (Module SII). In healthy male subjects treated with 
mitapivat in Study AG348-C-002, compared with placebo-treated male subjects, the 
aromatase-dependent hormone studies demonstrated an increase in total and free testosterone 
mean serum concentrations and decreased concentrations of estradiol and estrone at all doses 
of mitapivat, including the lowest dose of 15 mg BID. Changes in aromatase-dependent 
hormone levels in the male subjects treated with mitapivat are consistent with inhibition of 
human aromatase and were reversible within 14 days upon cessation of dosing (CSR AG348-
C-002, Section 12.5.5). Male subjects receiving mitapivat in Study AG348-C-003 
experienced an expected increase in total testosterone and free testosterone and a decrease in 
estradiol and estrone. Testosterone levels have been observed to remain in the normal range 
for most subjects treated with mitapivat. However, even at the lowest actual dose level of 
mitapivat, there appears to be a corresponding decrease in male estradiol. Aromatase-
dependent hormone levels in the female subjects treated with mitapivat were also collected 
but were difficult to interpret due to subject age (premenopausal vs postmenopausal) and 
contraceptive use (hormonal vs nonhormonal contraception); these data were considered not 
informative for analysis of mitapivat changes in sex hormones due to aromatase inhibition 
potency.  
The in vitro potency of mitapivat and 3 marketed aromatase inhibitors (exemestane, 
anastrozole, and letrozole) on aromatase inhibition in rat ovarian and human placental tissue 
is provided in Table SVII.2.

Mitapivat was observed to inhibit human aromatase in secondary pharmacology in vitro 
studies, with the in vitro IC50 for aromatase inhibition in rat ovarian and human placental 
tissue being 5- to 248-fold higher than the 3 marketed aromatase inhibitors. This 
demonstrates that mitapivat is a far less potent inhibitor of aromatase in vitro compared with 
the 3 marketed aromatase inhibitors. 
The area under the curve (AUCτ,ss), average total concentration (Cavg,ss,tot) and average free 
concentration (Cavg,ss,free) of mitapivat and 2 of the 3 marketed aromatase inhibitors at

Letrozole is a reversible aromatase inhibitor. The clinical Cavg,ss,free of letrozole at 2.5 mg 
(approved dose for treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive 
early breast cancer is 2.5 mg QD; (Femara Package Insert, 2014)) is 148.40 nM, ~18-fold

receptor-positive early breast cancer is 25 mg QD; (Aromasin (exemestane) Package Insert, 
2018) is 0.436 nM, ~910-fold below the in vitro IC50 for aromatase inhibition in human 
placental tissue. As the drug binds irreversibly, the dose can be a lot lower than reversible 
aromatase inhibition doses as effect accumulates during treatment (Lonning et al, 2003).  
Mitapivat behaves like a reversible aromatase inhibitor in clinical and nonclinical assays. The 
clinical Cavg,ss,free of mitapivat at 50 mg BID (highest dose being administered to adults in the 
ongoing pivotal trials) is 6.86 nM, ~298-fold below in vitro IC50 for human aromatase 
inhibition, suggesting that the concentration of mitapivat in humans at the highest expected 
clinically efficacious dose is well below the concentration required for 50% aromatase 
inhibition; this is confirmed by clinical observations.  
In clinical studies in subjects with PK deficiency, subjects were monitored for potential 
clinical effects of aromatase inhibition by the collection of serial assessments of sex hormone 
levels. For male subjects during the cumulative period, a decrease in estrone and estradiol 
levels and increase in testosterone and free testosterone levels was observed between baseline 
and the on-treatment period. A total of 13 (34.2%) male subjects who had normal estrone 
levels at baseline had low estrone levels on treatment, 8 (21.1%) male subjects who had high 
estrone levels at baseline had low levels on treatment, and 10 (26.3%) male subjects with 
high estrone levels at baseline had normal levels on treatment. Estradiol levels in male 
subjects decreased but generally did not fall below the lower limit of normal (LLN). A total 
of 35 (50.0%) male subjects who had normal free testosterone levels at baseline had high 
levels during the cumulative period. Eight (11.6%) male subjects who had normal 
testosterone levels at baseline had a high level on treatment, and 2 (2.9%) male subjects who 
had normal testosterone levels at baseline had testosterone below the LLN on treatment. 
Changes observed in hormone levels were reversible upon study drug discontinuation 
(Module 2.7.4, Section 2.1.6.2.1). 
Sex hormone data in female subjects treated with mitapivat was difficult to interpret due to 
physiologic variations in hormone levels expected throughout the normal menstrual cycle, 
subject biologic age (premenopausal vs postmenopausal), and contraceptive use (hormonal vs 
nonhormonal contraception). Sex hormone levels were generally unchanged from baseline to 
the on-treatment period in female subjects who received mitapivat or placebo. Menstrual 
diaries were collected from menstruating women; no changes in menstrual cycles after 
initiation of mitapivat treatment were observed from menstrual diaries (Module 2.7.4, 
Section 2.1.6.2.1). 
To monitor for any clinical consequences from sex hormone changes due to off-target 
aromatase inhibition by mitapivat, a MedDRA Version 23.1 pooled list of PTs of 
endocrinological interest (Table SVII.4) was used to search for potential AEs due to 
aromatase inhibition.

In the clinical development program, a total of 25 subjects (25 of 155, 16.1%) with PK 
deficiency had at least 1 AE of endocrinological interest, and 11 subjects (11 of 155, 7.1%) 
had AEs that were treatment related as reported by the Investigator (Table 18.3.1-10.6b, 
Table 19-3.1). The AEs of Dysmenorrhoea, Menstruation irregular, and Night sweats were 
among the most commonly reported AEs of endocrinological interest (reported in 
≥2 subjects) (Table 18.3.1-10.6b). There were no Grade ≥3 or SAEs of endocrinological 
interest reported in PK deficiency studies with mitapivat (Table 19-3.1, Table 19-4.1). There 
was a total of 24 treatment-related AEs, with outcomes of recovered (23 of 24, 95.8%) or 
ongoing (1 of 24, 4.2%) (Table 19-4.1). Among the 25 subjects who reported AEs of 
endocrinological interest, the median time to the first onset of the AE was 11.14 weeks (range 
0.3, 66.6 weeks), and the median AE duration was 3 days (range 1, 699 days) 
(Table 18.3.1-10.5b). The incidence of AEs of endocrinological interest was comparable in 
subjects who received placebo in Study AG348-C-006 compared with subjects who received 
mitapivat during the 24-week period, with 4 subjects (4 of 39, 10.3%) receiving placebo and 
4 subjects (4 of 40, 10.0%) receiving mitapivat (Table 18.3.1-10.6a). 
In the Pyrukynd SmPC Section 4.8, adverse reactions in the Investigations System Organ 
Class (SOC) include Oestrone decreased (males) with a frequency of very common (≥1/10) 
and Blood testosterone increased (males) and Oestradiol decreased (males) with a frequency 
of common (≥1/100 to <1/10). 
Sex hormone changes due to off-target aromatase inhibition with mitapivat were identified 
preclinically and confirmed with aromatase-dependent hormone changes in healthy male 
adult subjects and subjects with PK deficiency. The evaluated changes in aromatase-

Mitapivat 
dependent sex hormone levels have been observed to remain in the normal range for most 
subjects treated with mitapivat. In the clinical development program, there were no data 
suggesting that there is an increase in the risk of AEs that could be reasonably associated with 
sex hormone changes due to off-target aromatase inhibition by mitapivat. Despite this effect 
on aromatase-dependent hormone levels, changes in sex hormones is not considered 
important for inclusion in the list of mitapivat safety concerns in the RMP because mitapivat-
induced changes in sex hormone levels are not associated with development of AEs. The risk 
of changes in sex hormones will be monitored and discussed in the PSURs. 
•  Bone mineral density decrease due to aromatase inhibition (potential risk) 
Bone mineral density decrease due to aromatase inhibition is a potential risk associated with 
mitapivat treatment based on nonclinical and clinical safety findings (Module SII). 
Patients with PK deficiency have an inherent risk for developing osteopenia and osteoporosis 
throughout their lifetimes because of anemia and iron overload caused by ineffective 
erythropoiesis. Patients with PK deficiency are at risk for low BMD, fractures, and bone pain 
(Module SI).  
Bone mineral density measured by DXA was analyzed in Studies AG348-C-003, 
AG348-C-006, AG348-C-007, and AG348-C-011 as the worst on-treatment T-score 
compared with baseline T-score. The analysis showed that no clinically meaningful changes 
in BMD were observed in subjects who received mitapivat. Most subjects remained within 
the same baseline category during treatment (Module 2.7.4, Section 2.1.6.2.2). Data from the 
long-term extension period of Study AG348-C-003 including 31 subjects who were treated 
for more than 12 months suggested no clinically meaningful worsening of BMD. 
Additionally, long-term data from Study AG348-C-011 showed no worsening in BMD based 
on worst on treatment T-score compared with baseline T-score.  
Bone mineral density decrease AEs were identified by searching the Standardized MedDRA 
Query (SMQ) (Broad) of Osteoporosis/Osteopenia. In Studies AG348-C-003, AG348-C-006, 
AG348-C-007, and AG348-C-011, 13 (13 of 155, 8.4%) subjects treated with mitapivat 
experienced an event of BMD decrease. Of these events, 7 (7 of 155, 4.5%) subjects reported 
Osteopenia, 4 (4 of 155, 2.6%) subjects reported Osteoporosis, 1 (1 of 155, 0.6%) subject 
reported Bone density decreased, and 3 (3 of 155, 1.9%) subjects reported a type of bone 
fracture (Table 18.3.1-10.6b). All subjects who reported an event of BMD decrease had either 
a medical history or baseline DXA indicating osteopenia or osteoporosis. There were 2 (2 of 
155, 1.3%) subjects who reported an event that was Grade ≥3 in severity (PTs Femur 
fracture, Rib fracture, Tibia fracture) (Table 19-3.1, Table 18.3.1-2.2b). None of the bone 
fracture AEs were assessed as related to mitapivat by the Investigator as all of the events 
were either traumatic bone fractures or occurred in subjects who were considered 
osteoporotic or osteopenic at baseline. Only 1 AE assessed as treatment related by the 
Investigator (PT Osteoporosis) was considered serious, and it resolved, with the subject 
continuing to receive mitapivat treatment in Study AG348-C-003 (Table 19-4.1). Among the 
13 subjects who reported AEs of BMD decrease, the median time to the first onset of the AEs 
was 43.71 weeks (range 6.6, 103.4 weeks), and the median AE duration was 211 days (range 
3, 734 days) (Table 18.3.1-10.5b). In Study AG348-C-006, during the 24-week period, BMD 
decreased AEs were reported for 1 subject (1 of 39, 2.6%) who received placebo 
(PT Osteoporosis) and 2 subjects (2 of 40, 5.0%) who received mitapivat (PTs Osteopenia, 
Rib fracture) (Table 18.3.1-10.6a). 
Bone mineral density decrease due to aromatase inhibition is not considered important for 
inclusion in the list of mitapivat safety concerns in the RMP because short- and long-term 
Confidential

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Mitapivat 
BMD data based on DXA scans have shown no correlation of sex hormone changes due to 
aromatase inhibition and BMD, and no treatment-related fractures have been reported. 
Mitapivat is not recognized to cause significant aromatase inhibition that may lead to BMD 
decrease and subsequent AEs. The risk of bone mineral density decrease due to aromatase 
inhibition will be monitored and discussed in the PSURs. 
•  Gastrointestinal disorders (potential risk) 
Gastrointestinal disorders are a potential risk associated with mitapivat treatment based on 
nonclinical and clinical safety findings (Module SII).  
Treatment-emergent AEs of GI disorders have occurred in studies with mitapivat in subjects 
with PK deficiency and in healthy subjects. A dose relationship was observed for GI events in 
studies with healthy subjects; all GI events occurred in subjects who received mitapivat doses 
of ≥700 mg BID (Module 2.7.4, Section 2.1.6.4).  
Gastrointestinal disorders AEs were identified by searching with the MedDRA Version 23.1 
SMQ (Narrow) of Gastrointestinal nonspecific symptoms and therapeutic procedures. In the 
clinical development program, GI AEs were reported for 78 subjects (78 of 155, 50.3%) with 
PK deficiency, and 41 subjects (41 of 155, 26.5%) had GI AEs assessed as related to 
treatment by the Investigator (Table 18.3.1-10.6b, Table 19-3.1). The AEs of Nausea, 
Diarrhoea, Vomiting, Dyspepsia, and Abdominal pain were among the most commonly 
reported AEs of GI disorders (reported in ≥5% of subjects) (Table 18.3.1-10.6b). Most 
treatment-related AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2. Adverse events with a severity of Grade ≥3 
were reported in 3 subjects (3 of 155, 1.9%), and none of these events were assessed as 
treatment related by the investigator (Table 19-3.1). Only 2 subjects reported SAEs (PTs 
Colitis, Enteritis); none of the SAEs were considered treatment related by the investigator, 
and all SAEs resolved (Table 19-4.1). There was a total of 79 treatment-related AEs, with 
outcomes of recovered (74 of 79, 93.7%) or ongoing (5 of 79, 6.3%) (Table 19-4.1). Among 
the 78 subjects who reported AEs of GI disorders, the median time to the first onset of a GI 
AE was 3.93 weeks (range 0.1, 141.7 weeks), and the median AE duration was 3 days (range 
1, 1,232 days) (Table 18.3.1-10.5b). In Study AG348-C-006, during the 24-week period, GI 
disorders AEs were reported for 17 subjects (17 of 39, 43.6%) who received placebo and 14 
subjects (14 of 40, 35.0%) who received mitapivat (Table 18.3.1-10.6a).  The SmPC Section 
4.8 states Nausea is a very common adverse reaction. 
Gastrointestinal disorders is not considered important for inclusion in the list of mitapivat 
safety concerns in the RMP because most of the treatment-related AEs were mild in severity, 
nonserious, and resolved without treatment discontinuation.  
•  Hypersensitivity (potential risk) 
Hypersensitivity is a potential risk associated with mitapivat treatment based on nonclinical 
and clinical safety findings (Module SII).  
Hypersensitivity AEs were identified by searching with the MedDRA Version 23.1 SMQ 
(narrow) of Hypersensitivity. In the clinical development program, hypersensitivity AEs were 
reported for 26 subjects (26 of 155, 16.8%) with PK deficiency, and 6 subjects (6 of 155, 
3.9%) had hypersensitivity AEs assessed as related to treatment by the Investigator 
(Table 18.3.1-10.6b, Table 19-3.1). The AEs of Rash, Rhinitis allergic, Hypersensitivity, 
Eczema, Drug hypersensitivity, Dermatitis atopic, Dermatitis contact, and Rash 
maculo-papular were among the most commonly reported hypersensitivity AEs (reported in 
≥2 subjects) (Table 18.3.1-10.6b). There were no Grade ≥3 or serious hypersensitivity AEs 
reported in PK deficiency studies with mitapivat (Table 19-3.1, Table 19-4.1). There was a 
Confidential

Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Mitapivat 
total of 9 treatment-related AEs with outcomes of recovered (9 of 9, 100%) (Table 19-4.1). 
Among the 26 subjects who reported Hypersensitivity AEs, the median time to the first onset 
of hypersensitivity was 11.00 weeks (range 0.1, 204.1 weeks), and the median AE duration 
was 21.5 days (range 1, 242 days) (Table 18.3.1-10.5b). The incidence of events of 
hypersensitivity was higher in subjects who received placebo in Study AG348-C-006 
compared with subjects who received mitapivat. During the 24-week period, hypersensitivity 
AEs were reported for 10 subjects (10 of 39, 25.6%) who received placebo and 4 subjects 
(4 of 40, 10.0%) who received mitapivat (Table 18.3.1-10.6a). 
Hypersensitivity is not considered important for inclusion in the list of mitapivat safety 
concerns in the RMP because most of the AEs were mild in severity, nonserious, and 
resolved without treatment discontinuation.  
•  Insomnia (identified risk) 
Insomnia is an identified risk of mitapivat based on nonclinical and clinical safety findings 
(Module SII).  
The MedDRA Version 23.1 High Level Term of Disturbances in initiating and maintaining 
sleep was used to search for events of insomnia. In the clinical development program, 
insomnia AEs were reported for 51 subjects (51 of 155, 32.9%) with PK deficiency, and 
39 subjects (39 of 155, 25.2%) had insomnia AEs assessed as related to treatment by the 
Investigator (Table 18.3.1-10.6b, Table 19-3.1). Of these events, 15 (15 of 155, 9.7%) 
subjects reported Initial insomnia, 13 (13 of 155, 8.4%) subjects reported Middle insomnia, 
26 (26 of 155, 16.8%) subjects reported Insomnia, and 3 (3 of 155, 1.9%) subjects reported 
Terminal insomnia (Table 18.3.1-10.5b). Most treatment-related AEs were Grade 1 or 
Grade 2. Adverse events with a severity of Grade ≥3 were reported in 2 subjects (2 of 155, 
1.3%). Only 1 AE assessed as treatment related by the investigator (PT Initial insomnia) was 
considered serious and resolved, with the subject continuing to receive mitapivat treatment in 
Study AG348-C-003 (Table 19-4.1). There was a total of 56 treatment-related AEs with 
outcomes of recovered (46 of 56, 82.1%) or ongoing (10 of 56, 17.9%) (Table 19-4.1). 
Among the 51 subjects who reported AEs of insomnia, the median time to the first onset of 
an insomnia AE was 6.14 weeks (range 0.1, 164.6 weeks), and the median AE duration was 
40 days (range 1, 761 days) (Table 18.3.1-10.5b). In Study AG348-C-003, there was an 
apparent relationship between increased dose and occurrence of insomnia AEs; 61.8% of AEs 
occurred at doses >50 mg BID (Module 2.7.4, Section 2.1.6.3). Additionally, based on an 
exposure-response analysis, increased mitapivat plasma concentrations may increase the risk 
of insomnia (AG348-PMx-002). In Study AG348-C-006, during the 24-week period, 
insomnia AEs were reported for 7 subjects (7 of 39, 17.9%) who received placebo and 
6 subjects (6 of 40, 15.0%) who received mitapivat (Table 18.3.1-10.6a). 
Insomnia is not considered important for inclusion in the list of mitapivat safety concerns in 
the RMP because most of the treatment-related AEs were mild in severity, nonserious, and 
resolved without treatment discontinuation.  
In the Pyrukynd SmPC Section 4.8, adverse reactions in the Psychiatric disorders SOC 
include insomnia (pooled PTs of Initial insomnia, Insomnia, Middle insomnia, and Terminal 
insomnia) with a frequency of very common (≥1/10).  
•  Triglycerides increased (potential risk) 
Increased triglycerides is a potential risk of mitapivat based on clinical safety findings. The 
MedDRA Version 23.1 PTs of Blood triglycerides increased and Hypertriglyceridaemia were 
used to search for events of triglycerides increased. In the clinical development program, a

total of 17 subjects (17 of 155, 11.0%) with PK deficiency had at least 1 AE of triglycerides 
increased, and 10 subjects (10 of 155, 6.5%) had AEs assessed as related to treatment by the 
Investigator (Table 18.3.1-10.6b, Table 19-3.1). Of these events, 13 (13 of 155, 8.4%) 
subjects reported Hypertriglyceridaemia and 5 (5 of 155, 3.2%) subjects reported Blood 
triglycerides increased (Table 18.3.1-10.6b). Adverse events with a severity of Grade ≥3 were 
reported in 9 subjects (9 of 155, 5.8%). One treatment-related SAE of Grade 4 
Hypertriglyceridaemia that led to discontinuation of study drug occurred in a subject in Study 
AG348-C-003 who had Grade 3 triglycerides levels at baseline (CSR AG348-C-003, 
Section 14.3.3). There was a total of 11 treatment-related AEs with outcomes of recovered 
(8 of 11, 72.7%) or ongoing (3 of 11, 27.3%) (Table 19-4.1). Among the 17 subjects who 
reported AEs of triglyceride increased, the median time to the first onset of a triglyceride 
increased AE was 13.14 weeks (range 0.1, 141.3 weeks), and the median AE duration was 
125.5 days (range 7, 1,173 days) (Table 18.3.1-10.5b). Because elevated triglyceride levels 
may signal risk for acute pancreatitis, acute pancreatitis AEs were reviewed. Acute 
pancreatitis AEs were identified by searching the MedDRA Version 23.1 SMQ (Narrow) of 
Acute pancreatitis. There were no AEs of Pancreatitis reported in any subject on study. One 
subject who received placebo in Study AG348-C-006 experienced a Grade 3 SAE of 
Obstructive pancreatitis. The subject had increased ALT levels that qualified the event as an 
AESI. The event was considered to be not related to study treatment (Module 2.7.4, Section 
2.1.6.5. In Study AG348-C-006, during the 24-week period, triglycerides increased AEs were 
reported for 1 subject (1 of 39, 2.6%) who received placebo and 3 subjects (3 of 40, 7.5%) 
who received mitapivat (Table 18.3.1-10.6a). Additionally, in Study AG348-C-006 during 
the 24-week period, increased triglyceride labs of any grade occurred in 48.7% of subjects 
who received placebo and 37.5% of subjects who received mitapivat (Module 2.7.4, 
Section 3.1.4). 
Triglycerides increased events were transient in nature with triglyceride levels returning to 
baseline without concomitant treatment medications and without mitapivat dose modification. 
There have been no reported AEs that would indicate a long-term effect on triglycerides. 
Many of the subjects who experienced Grade 3 and 4 events had confounding factors such as 
being overweight or obese, and some subjects had slight or moderate weight gain during the 
study. Some laboratory tests were performed without fasting. Additionally, many subjects 
who experienced Grade 1 AEs of Hypertriglyceridaemia had elevated triglycerides at 
baseline, and some subjects had severe triglyceride elevations at baseline. Most subjects who 
had elevated triglyceride levels on study had low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) at baseline. 
These subjects did not experience hypertension or other cardiovascular events in association 
with hypertriglyceridemia events. No safety trends were observed with cholesterol, low-
density lipoprotein, HDL, hypertriglyceridemia, or QT prolongation (Module 2.7.4, 
Section 2.1.6.5).  
Triglycerides increased is not considered important for inclusion in the list of mitapivat safety 
concerns in the RMP because most of the AEs were mild in severity, nonserious, and 
resolved without treatment discontinuation. Additionally, there were no identified trends with 
other lipid analytes or associations with cardiovascular clinical consequences such as 
hypertension or heart disease. There was no evidence of a sustained effect in triglycerides as 
most events resolved transiently.

Drug-drug interactions  
The potential for DDIs with mitapivat has been comprehensively investigated (Module SII). 
In vitro studies demonstrate that mitapivat is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4/5.  
The pharmacokinetics of mitapivat was evaluated in 14 healthy adult subjects in the presence 
and absence of itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4/5 and P-gp inhibitor using an open-label, 
fixed-sequence study design (Study AG348-C-012, Part 1). In Part 1, subjects received a 
single oral dose of 20 mg mitapivat on Day 1 of Treatment Period 1. In Treatment Period 2, 
subjects received oral itraconazole (200 mg QD) from Day 1 through Day 9, with a single 
oral dose of 20 mg mitapivat on Day 5. Systemic exposure of mitapivat increased in the 
presence of itraconazole compared with mitapivat alone, with the geometric mean AUC0-t, 
AUC∞, and Cmax ratios of mitapivat in the presence and absence of itraconazole being 4.7, 
4.9, and 1.7, respectively (Module 2.7.2, Section 2.2.1.5.1). This result shows that 
coadministration of mitapivat with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increased mitapivat plasma 
concentrations (Module 2.7.2, Section 2.4.1). Based on an exposure/response analysis, 
increased mitapivat plasma concentrations may increase the risk of insomnia. The Pyrukynd 
SmPC Section 4.4 states that co-administration of specific medicinal products with mitapivat 
may result in increased risk of insomnia or changes in efficacy of mitapivat or changes in 
efficacy of the co-administered medicinal products (see SmPC Section 4.5). Potential drug-
drug interactions should be considered whenever beginning or discontinuing treatment with 
mitapivat or other medicinal products concomitantly administered with mitapivat. Section 4.5 
of the SmPC states that the concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors with Pyrukynd should be 
avoided (see SmPC Section 4.4). If concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inhibitor is unavoidable, 
patients should be monitored for increased risk of insomnia (see SmPC Section 4.2). 
The pharmacokinetics of mitapivat was evaluated in 14 healthy adult subjects in the presence 
and absence of rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4/5 inducer, using an open-label, fixed-sequence 
study design (Study AG348-C-012, Part 2). In Part 2, healthy subjects received a single oral 
dose of 50 mg mitapivat on Day 1 of Treatment Period 1. In Treatment Period 2, subjects 
received oral rifampicin (600 mg QD) from Day 1 through Day 12, with a single oral dose of 
50 mg mitapivat on Day 8. Systemic exposure of mitapivat in the presence of rifampicin was 
lower compared with that of mitapivat alone, with the geometric mean AUC0-t, AUC∞, and 
Cmax ratios of mitapivat in the presence and absence of rifampicin being 0.09, 0.09, and 0.23, 
respectively (Module 2.7.2, Section 2.2.1.5.2). This result suggests that strong inducers of 
CYP3A4 have the potential to decrease the exposure of mitapivat. Decreased mitapivat 
plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of mitapivat. The Pyrukynd SmPC Section 4.5 
states that the concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers with Pyrukynd should be avoided (see 
SmPC Section 4.4). If concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inducer is unavoidable, patients should 
be monitored for reduced efficacy of mitapivat. 
Based on the Cmax at a 50-mg dose of mitapivat and the IC50 values calculated from in vitro 
data, the risk of DDIs with substrates of OATP1B1, OAT3, MATE1, and OCT2 is expected 
to be low.

Mitapivat 
In vitro, mitapivat induced human CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4; 
therefore, mitapivat has the potential to decrease the exposure of sensitive substrates of these 
enzymes. The Pyrukynd SmPC Section 4.4 states that mitapivat may decrease the systemic 
exposure of hormonal contraceptives that are sensitive substrates of cytochrome P450 3A4 
(CYP3A4) (eg ethinylestradiol) (see SmPC Section 4.5). The SmPC Section 4.5 states that 
mitapivat may alter the systemic exposure of hormonal contraceptives that are sensitive 
substrates of CYP3A4 (e.g., ethinylestradiol) (see SmPC Section 4.4) and may affect their 
efficacy (see SmPC section 4.6). The SmPC Section 4.6 states that women of childbearing 
potential should use contraception during treatment with Pyrukynd and for at least 1 month 
after the last dose. Mitapivat may decrease the systemic exposure of hormonal contraceptives 
that are sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 (see SmPC Sections 4.4 and 4.5). Additional or 
alternative methods of contraception should be considered. 
The Pyrukynd SmPC Section 4.5 states that mitapivat induces and may inhibit CYP3A4 and 
co-administration with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates (eg, midazolam) may alter systemic 
exposure of these medicinal products. Concomitant use of Pyrukynd with substrates of this 
enzyme was not evaluated in a clinical drug-drug interaction study. Alternative therapies that 
are not sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 should be considered during treatment with Pyrukynd 
(see SmPC Section 4.4). If co-administration of Pyrukynd with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates 
is unavoidable, patients should be carefully monitored especially for those substrates with a 
narrow therapeutic index (eg, alfentanil, carbamazepine, cyclosporine, ergotamine, fentanyl, 
pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus). A clinical DDI study with midazolam to assess 
the magnitude of interaction between mitapivat and CYP3A4 substrates will be conducted as 
a post-authorization measure (REC).  
Section 4.5 of the SmPC states that based on in vitro data, mitapivat may induce UGT1A1, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 (see SmPC Section 5.2) and may decrease 
systemic exposure to substrates of these enzymes (eg, irinotecan [UGT1A1], bupropion 
[CYP2B6]; omeprazole [CYP2C19]; repaglinide [CYP2C8]; warfarin [CYP2C9]). 
Concomitant use of Pyrukynd with substrates of these enzymes was not evaluated in a 
clinical drug-drug interaction study. Alternative therapies that are not UGT1A1 substrates or 
sensitive substrates of CYP2B6 or CYP2C should be considered during treatment with 
Pyrukynd (see SmPC Section 4.4). If co-administration is unavoidable, patients should be 
monitored for loss of therapeutic effect of substates of these enzymes, especially for those 
with a narrow therapeutic index (eg, irinotecan [UGT1A1]; cyclophosphamide [CYP2B6]; 
valproic acid [CYP2C19]; paclitaxel [CYP2C8]; warfarin, phenytoin [CYP2C9]). Section 5.2 
of the SmPC states that mitapivat induces CYP3A4 and may also induce CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and UGT1A1. Mitapivat may inhibit CYP3A4. 
The SmPC Section 4.5 states that mitapivat exhibits pH-dependent solubility (see SmPC 
Section 5.2) and coadministration with gastric acid reducing agents (eg, famotidine) may 
decrease mitapivat absorption (see SmPC Section 4.4). Concomitant use of Pyrukynd with 
medicinal products that elevate the gastric pH was not evaluated in a clinical drug-drug 
interaction study. If concomitant use of gastric acid-reducing agents is unavoidable, patients 
should be monitored for reduced efficacy of mitapivat. Section 5.2 states that mitapivat 
exhibits pH-dependent solubility. High solubility is observed up to pH 5.5, with decreasing 
solubility at higher pH which may decrease mitapivat absorption. 
Mitapivat is not a substrate for BCRP, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3; hence, coadministration 
with strong inhibitors of these transporters is not expected to alter mitapivat disposition. 
Mitapivat is a P-gp substrate, so it is possible that strong inhibitors of P-gp may alter the 
disposition of mitapivat. In Study AG348-C-009, the ADME and absolute bioavailability of

Mitapivat 
mitapivat were investigated in 8 healthy male subjects after oral administration of a single 
120-mg dose of [14C]mitapivat and concomitant single intravenous 0.1 mg microdose of 
[13C6]mitapivat. The study showed that the total (mean ±SD) recovery of administered 
radioactive dose over a period of 240 hours was 89.1% ±2.20%, with 49.6% ±3.99% in the 
urine and 39.6% ±3.38% in the feces. Most (81.9%) of the administered radioactivity was 
recovered in the first 96 hours postdose. The mean absolute bioavailability of mitapivat 
estimated from this study was 72.7%. The systemic clearance of mitapivat after intravenous 
dosing was 9.53 L/h. Because unchanged mitapivat accounted for <1% of the dose in feces, 
the derived Fa is assumed to be 0.99. Based on these data, the Fa•Fg was calculated to be 
>0.8. Because mitapivat has a high absorption fraction in the absence of strong P-gp 
inhibitors (Fa•Fg >0.8), it can be presumed that there will be no more than 20% increase in 
exposure (AUC) of mitapivat due to P-gp inhibition in the GI tract (Module 2.7.2, 
Section 3.3.1.3). The risk of DDIs with P-gp inhibitors is expected to be low. Section 4.5 of 
the SmPC states that based on in vitro data, mitapivat may induce and inhibit P-gp (see 
SmPC Section 5.2) and may alter systemic exposure of substrates (eg, dabigatran etexilate) of 
this transporter. Concomitant use of Pyrukynd with substrates of P-gp was not evaluated in a 
clinical drug-drug interaction study. Alternative therapies that are not P-gp substrates should 
be considered during treatment with Pyrukynd (see SmPC Section 4.4). If co-administration 
of Pyrukynd with P-gp substrates is unavoidable, patients should be carefully monitored 
especially for those substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (eg, colchicine, digoxin). 
Section 5.2 states that mitapivat is a substrate for P-gp and may induce and inhibit P-gp. 
The DDIs described above are not considered important risks of mitapivat and can be 
managed by adhering to the guidance in the Pyrukynd SmPC.

Important Identified Risk 1: Acute hemolysis  
Acute hemolysis is an important identified risk as it is a severe condition that may lead to 
acute exacerbation of the patient’s underlying health condition if left untreated. Acute 
hemolysis is the rapid return to pretreatment levels of hemolysis after sudden mitapivat 
withdrawal. It occurs only in patients who are Hb responders when abrupt withdrawal of 
mitapivat (without a gradual reduction in dosing) leads to a rapid and marked return to 
pretreatment Hb levels, accompanied by signs and symptoms of hemolysis. Acute hemolysis 
has been observed after abrupt mitapivat withdrawal in the clinical development program.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Mitapivat 
In the clinical development program, 2 subjects (2 of 155; 1.3%) with PK deficiency 
experienced acute hemolysis upon abrupt withdrawal of mitapivat dosed at 300 mg BID. The 
treatment-related AEs experienced by the 2 subjects included 2 Grade 3 SAEs of acute 
hemolysis (PTs Haemolytic anaemia and Haemolysis) and 1 nonserious Grade 2 case of acute 
hemolysis (PT Haemolysis). Both subjects had a high reticulocyte percent and low Hb at 
baseline indicating active ineffective erythropoiesis and ongoing hemolysis. In both subjects, 
a rapid Hb increase and correction in reticulocyte percent during the first 3 weeks of 
mitapivat treatment at 300 mg BID, followed by an abrupt discontinuation of mitapivat 
without taper, resulted in acute hemolysis and anemia. These events of hemolysis had an 
extreme and specific change in Hb, reticulocyte, and bilirubin levels in response to the start 
and the end of mitapivat dosing, where there is a strong biological rationale and sufficient 
evidence to consider these events to be caused by the use of mitapivat (Part SVII.3.1).  
By contrast, subjects who missed only a few doses of mitapivat later in their treatment 
course, or for whom the dose was tapered, did not experience events indicative of acute 
hemolysis, and their Hb concentrations were either not recorded immediately after the short 
interruption or decreased gradually after the dose reduction. During the Extension Period of 
Study AG348-C-003, 14 subjects underwent a dose taper to reduce their mitapivat dose per 
protocol (starting at 300 mg BID and decreasing by 100 mg increments for 3 weeks). Eleven 
of the 14 subjects subsequently had decreases in their Hb. The rate at which Hb decreased 
varied by subject, but the most rapid decrease was approximately 1.1 g/dL per week, which 
stopped when the subject adjusted to a new dose level (CSR AG348-C-003). 
Two additional subjects in Study AG348-C-003 experienced treatment-related SAEs of 
Haemolytic anaemia. One subject was a confirmed nonresponder. It was determined that 
these events were not due to sudden withdrawal of mitapivat but were more likely attributed 
to the subjects’ ongoing anemia (CSR AG348-C-003, Section 14.3.3).  
Since the establishment of this important identified risk, in the clinical development program, 
subjects are no longer started at a very high dose of mitapivat. The maximum dose in subjects 
with PK deficiency is 50 mg BID, and subjects are dose escalated to their optimal dose to 
avoid rapid increase in Hb. Dose taper strategies are recommended when mitapivat dose 
cessation is planned to reduce the risk of hemolysis and a rapid decrease in Hb. In an 
emergency setting, mitapivat dosing can be stopped immediately as long as the patient is 
properly monitored for changes in Hb and signs and symptoms of acute hemolysis. No 
additional events of acute hemolysis have been reported in subjects with PK deficiency where 
the dose taper has been followed as per protocol. 
Benefit-risk impact:  
Patients with PK deficiency experience lifelong hemolytic anemia with subsequent associated 
comorbidities. These patients have a serious unmet medical need for safe and effective 
targeted therapies as there are currently no approved products to manage or treat PK 
deficiency. The benefit of mitapivat as an effective treatment for PK deficiency outweighs the 
risk of acute hemolysis, which has been observed only in Hb-responding subjects at 6 times 
the recommended mitapivat dose and can be managed in clinical practice by adhering to the 
guidance in the SmPC. Acute hemolysis is included as a special warning and precautions for 
use in the Pyrukynd SmPC Section 4.4 and Package Leaflet (PL) Section 2. The Pyrukynd 
SmPC Section 4.4 states that acute haemolysis with subsequent anaemia has been observed 
following abrupt interruption or discontinuation of Pyrukynd (see SmPC Section 4.8). Abrupt 
interruption or discontinuation of treatment with Pyrukynd should be avoided. A gradual 
reduction in dosing rather than abrupt cessation is recommended (see SmPC Section 4.2). If

Mitapivat 
discontinuing treatment abruptly, patients should be monitored for signs of acute haemolysis 
and anaemia which may include among other symptoms and signs: jaundice, scleral icterus 
and dark urine. Section 4.2 of the SmPC states that to minimise the risk of acute haemolysis, 
abrupt interruption or discontinuation of Pyrukynd should be avoided. The dose should be 
tapered to gradually discontinue the medicinal product over a 1-2 week period (see Table 2 of 
the SmPC). Patients should be monitored for signs of acute haemolysis with worsening of 
anaemia (see SmPC Sections 4.4 and 4.8). Acute hemolysis is also included in the SmPC 
Section 4.8 under Description of Selected Adverse Reactions, which states that abrupt 
interruption or discontinuation of Pyrukynd can lead to acute haemolysis (see SmPC 
Section 4.4). For guidance on how to interrupt or discontinue treatment see SmPC 
Section 4.2. 
Important Potential Risk 1: Embryo-fetal toxicity 
There are limited data on mitapivat exposure in pregnant women because subjects who were 
pregnant were not treated with mitapivat in the clinical development program 
(Module SIV.3). One pregnancy was reported in a subject receiving mitapivat. This was a 
-year-old female in Study AG348-C-003 who carried and delivered a full-term healthy 
 baby 
 via scheduled caesarean section at 39 weeks. Additionally, 1 
pregnancy was reported in a partner of a male subject who was receiving mitapivat in Study 
AG348-C-003. The subject’s partner was a 
-year-old female who was on a contraceptive 
pill at time of conception and had ultrasound-confirmed normal pregnancy. The subject’s 
partner gave birth to a normal healthy baby 
(CSR AG348-C-003, Section 14.3.3).  
 by vaginal episiotomy 
In embryo-fetal development studies, fetal adverse effects were observed at AUC0-12hr (Day 
last) values 63-fold (rats) and 3.1-fold (rabbits) the human AUC0-12hr value at 50 mg BID 
(3,580 hr•ng/mL).  
In a rat embryo-fetal toxicity study, oral administration of mitapivat was associated with fetal 
adverse events, including a decrease in the mean number and litter proportion of viable 
fetuses, lower mean fetal weights, and test article-related external, soft tissue, and skeletal 
malformations. The maternal and fetal NOAEL occurred at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day and 
correlated with maternal AUC0-12hr (Day last) values of 46,800 hr•ng/mL. The findings 
observed in rats are consistent with effects reported for aromatase inhibitors and are therefore 
likely due to sex hormone changes caused by aromatase inhibition.

Mitapivat 
In a rabbit embryo-fetal toxicity study, oral administration of mitapivat resulted in lower 
mean fetal body weights. No effects on fetal morphology were observed. The maternal and 
fetal NOAEL occurred at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day and correlated with maternal AUC0-12hr 
(Day last) values of 5,360 hr•ng/mL.  
Although human data on pregnancies are limited, there is no evidence of human 
teratogenicity based on genotoxic potential and the 2 successful pregnancies. Although 
nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies did not demonstrate teratogenicity/fetotoxicity at 
maternal exposures comparable to those in humans administered mitapivat at 50 mg BID 
(proposed clinical dose), they did demonstrate embryo-fetal toxicity at high dose levels: 
AUC0-12hr values 63- and 3.1-fold higher than the human AUC0-12hr value at 50 mg BID. 
Based on these non-clinical findings, embryo-fetal toxicity is considered an important 
potential risk (Module SVII.3.1). 
It is proposed that post-marketing monitoring for pregnancy and lactation will occur 
via routine pharmacovigilance. A pregnancy-, lactation-, and embryo-fetal toxicity-
specific follow-up form will be utilized by the case processing team, or extension 
thereof, when reports of pregnancy are received and then throughout the course of the 
pregnancy and delivery, as applicable. The follow-up form is attached in Annex 4. 
Benefit-risk impact:  
Patients with PK deficiency experience lifelong hemolytic anemia with subsequent associated 
comorbidities. These patients have a serious unmet medical need for safe and effective 
targeted therapies as there are currently no approved products to manage or treat PK 
deficiency. The benefit of mitapivat as an effective treatment for PK deficiency outweighs the 
potential risk of embryo-fetal toxicity that has yet to be confirmed in humans and can be 
managed by adhering to the recommendations in the Pyrukynd SmPC. The Pyrukynd SmPC 
Section 4.6 states that there are no or limited amount of data from the use of mitapivat in 
pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see SmPC Section 
5.3). Pyrukynd is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential 
not using contraception. Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant 
while receiving Pyrukynd. Women of childbearing potential should use contraception during 
treatment with Pyrukynd and for at least 1 month after the last dose. Mitapivat may decrease 
the systemic concentrations of hormonal contraceptives that are sensitive substrates of 
CYP3A4 (see SmPC Sections 4.4 and 4.5). Additional or alternative methods of 
contraception should be considered. In addition, SmPC Section 4.4 states that mitapivat may 
decrease the systemic concentrations of hormonal contraceptives that are sensitive substrates 
of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) (eg ethinylestradiol) (see SmPC Section 4.5). Women of 
childbearing potential should be counselled regarding the use of additional or alternative 
contraceptive methods (see SmPC Section 4.6). Section 5.3 of the SmPC describes the 
relevant preclinical safety data. 
Missing Information 1: Use in patients with hepatic impairment 
Hepatic elimination plays an important role in the clearance of mitapivat. The metabolic 
stability of mitapivat was evaluated in rat, dog, monkey, and human liver microsomes 
(Report AG348-N-066-R1). After 45 minutes of incubation with mitapivat (1 µM) and 
NADPH (2 mM), the liver microsomal intrinsic clearance (CLint) of mitapivat was 32.1, 22.8, 
18.1, and 6.82 L/hr/kg in rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans, respectively. The hepatic 
clearance (CLhep) calculated based on the CLint was 2.99, 1.75, 2.27, and 1.05 L/hr/kg in rats, 
dogs, monkeys, and humans, respectively. The hepatic extraction ratio was estimated to be 
Confidential 
68 
Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Mitapivat 
0.91, 0.92, 0.87, and 0.85 in rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans, respectively. These data 
suggest that mitapivat liver metabolism clearance was high (Module 2.6.4, Section 5.1.1.2). 
Mitapivat is known to be metabolized after oral administration with approximately 40% and 
50% of administered radioactivity in the human ADME study appearing as metabolites in the 
feces and urine, respectively (Module 2.7.2, Section 3.1.4). Therefore, there is a potential for 
hepatic impairment to affect mitapivat exposure.  
Use of mitapivat in patients with hepatic impairment has not been evaluated in the clinical 
development program. By nature of the indication, patients with PK deficiency are likely to 
experience chronic and acute hemolysis that may lead to increases in unconjugated bilirubin 
(Module SI). Due to this, analysis of the effect of hepatic parameters such as bilirubin on 
mitapivat pharmacokinetics is limited. The effect of hepatic parameters on mitapivat 
pharmacokinetics was assessed as part of a population pharmacokinetics analyses. Most 
subjects in the dataset had normal AST, ALT, and ALP at baseline. No apparent difference in 
steady-state AUC was observed in subjects with normal AST, ALT, or ALP levels versus 
those with elevated levels. Most subjects with PK deficiency in the dataset had elevated total 
bilirubin levels at baseline; nevertheless, steady-state AUC appeared to be similar among the 
subjects with PK deficiency with total bilirubin at the ranges between 1 to 2×ULN, 2 to 
3×ULN, and >3×ULN (Module 2.7.2, Section 3.2.2). Additionally, analysis of the degree of 
hepatic impairment in the PK deficiency clinical development program is unavailable as 
conventional hepatic dysfunction stratification tools (Child-Pugh, NCI-Organ Dysfunction 
Working Group [ODWG], and model for end-stage liver disease [MELD]) all use bilirubin as 
a criterion of their classifications.  
Mitapivat has not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment. No dose 
recommendations can be made, and the safety and efficacy of mitapivat have not been 
established in such subjects. Because there is a potential for hepatic impairment to affect 
mitapivat exposure, it will be important to assess the findings from the planned hepatic 
impairment Study AG348-C-0HEP to determine if dose adjustments of mitapivat are required 
for subjects with hepatic impairment.  
Use in subjects with hepatic impairment is considered an area of missing information as 
mitapivat has not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment.  
Benefit-risk impact: 
Patients with PK deficiency experience lifelong hemolytic anemia with subsequent associated 
comorbidities. These patients have a serious unmet medical need for safe and effective 
targeted therapies as there are currently no approved products to manage or treat PK 
deficiency. The benefit of mitapivat as an effective treatment for PK deficiency outweighs 
any unknown safety concerns in patients with hepatic impairment.  
Use in subjects with hepatic impairment will be further characterized in the planned hepatic 
impairment Study AG348-C-0HEP to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability 
of mitapivat in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment or normal hepatic function 
(Part III.2) which is aligned with the CHMP guidance on the ‘Evaluation of the 
pharmacokinetics of medicinal products in patients with impaired hepatic function’ (2005).  
Hepatic impairment is included as a special population in the Pyrukynd SmPC Sections 4.2 
and 5.2. In the Pyrukynd SmPC Section 4.2, it states that there are no data available in 
patients with hepatic impairment. No dose recommendations can be made. In the Pyrukynd 
SmPC Section 5.2, it states that the pharmacokinetics of mitapivat in patients with mild,

moderate, or severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. The SmPC will be updated 
once data from the study in patients with hepatic impairment are available. 
Missing Information 2: Long-term use  
The primary studies providing evidence of long-term use of mitapivat in the proposed 
indication for the treatment of PK deficiency in adult patients are Studies AG348-C-003 and 
AG348-C-011. Study AG348-C-008 (Peak Registry) will also provide supportive evidence 
for subjects that are receiving mitapivat. 
Study AG348-C-003 is an ongoing Phase 2, open-label, 2-arm, multicenter, randomized, 
dose-ranging study assessing the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity of mitapivat in adult subjects with PK deficiency. 
The study consists of a completed 24-week Core Period and an ongoing 8-year Extension 
Period. This study initiated on 26 June 2015 and last patient last visit is anticipated in May 
2025. In this study, subjects have received doses ranging from 5 mg 3 times a week to 
300 mg BID. As of 28 August 2020 (the interim data-cut for this study), 52 subjects have 
initiated treatment with 18 subjects ongoing treatment in the study.  
Study AG348-C-011 is an ongoing Phase 3, multicenter, open-label extension study for 
subjects who have completed Study AG348-C-006 or AG348-C-007 and meet all other 
eligibility criteria for Study AG348-C-011. The overall duration of the study is approximately 
5 years. This study initiated on 21 March 2019 and last patient last visit is currently 
anticipated in November 2024. As of 12 November 2020 (interim data-cut for this study), 
88 subjects had initiated treatment with 78 subjects still ongoing treatment in the study. This 
is a Category 3 PASS study, see Table III.1 Ongoing and Planned Additional 
Pharmacovigilance Activities.  
The long-term safety profile of mitapivat is consistent with the safety profile during the 
24-week on-treatment period. The most commonly reported events during the cumulative 
period were similar to those reported during the 24-week on-treatment period, and most 
events continued to be Grade 1 or 2 in severity. The slight increase in percentage of subjects 
experiencing these events is considered consistent with what would be expected with 
continued treatment for a longer duration in this patient population. 
The Peak Registry was designed to understand better the natural history of PK deficiency, 
including diagnosis, demographic and clinical characteristics, burden of disease, treatment 
patterns, and clinical outcomes in a real-world setting. The registry enrolled its first patient in 
April 2018 and will continue enrolling through Q2 2025. The study is expected to be 
completed in Q2 2027 with database lock in Q3 2027, providing at least 2 years and up to 9 
years of patient follow-up data. As of 08 March 2022, the Peak Registry had 240 patients 
enrolled from 48 sites in 16 countries, predominantly located in North America and Europe. 
This is a Category 3 PASS study, see Table III.1 Ongoing and Planned Additional 
Pharmacovigilance Activities. 
The effects of long-term use of mitapivat in subjects with PK deficiency are not known. All 
risks and associated long-term safety data will continued to be monitored and characterized. 
Benefit-risk impact: 
Patients with PK deficiency experience lifelong hemolytic anemia with subsequent associated 
comorbidities. These patients have a serious unmet medical need for safe and effective 
targeted therapies as there are currently no approved products to manage or treat PK 
deficiency. The benefit of mitapivat as an effective treatment for PK deficiency outweighs 
any unknown safety concerns associated with long-term mitapivat treatment.

The Pyrukynd SmPC Section 5.1 states that the median duration of treatment of mitapivat 
was 24.1 weeks in AG348-C-006 (ACTIVATE) and median duration of treatment in AG348-
C-007 (ACTVATE-T) was 40.3 weeks. In addition, the SmPC Section 4.2 states that 
treatment with Pyrukynd is intended to be long-term.  Pyrukynd should be discontinued if a 
patient does not experience an improvement of haemolytic anaemia at the maximum 
recommended dose, based on the totality of laboratory results and clinical status of the 
patient, unless there is another explanation for response failure (eg, bleeding, surgery, other 
concomitant illnesses). 
The effects of long-term use of mitapivat in subjects with PK deficiency will continue to be 
further characterized in Study AG348-C-011 (Category 3, PASS), AG348-C-008 Peak

SVII.3 Details of important identified risks, important potential risks, and 
missing information  
SVII.3.1 Presentation of important identified risks and important potential risks 
Important Identified Risk: Acute Hemolysis 
Potential mechanisms: 
Mitapivat is a potent, activator of alleles of PKR. Pyruvate kinase R is 1 of 4 pyruvate kinase 
isoenzymes expressed in human tissues from 2 separate genes. Both PKR and the 
liver-specific form of pyruvate kinase (PKL) are splice isoforms of the PKLR gene, while 
pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme (PKM)1 and PKM2 are both expressed from the PKM gene. 
Mitapivat is an allosteric activator of PKR, PKL, and PKM2 isoenzymes, with similar 
activity for each. Mature RBCs rely almost exclusively on the process of glycolysis to 
generate the energy carrier molecule ATP. Thus, PKR is a key enzyme for maintaining 
energy homeostasis in erythrocytes.  
Mitapivat acts by directly binding to the PKR tetramer and allosterically enhancing its 
affinity for PEP. Patients with PK deficiency who harbor mutations of the PKR enzyme 
experience a disruption in glycolytic pathway activity that leads to abnormal RBC 
metabolism and a shortened RBC life span, resulting in chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic 
anemia. In patients with PK deficiency, RBCs and their progenitors are characterized by 
changes in metabolism associated with defective glycolysis, including a build-up of PEP and 
the intermediate 2,3-DPG, and lowered levels of ATP. It is hypothesized that AG-348 
restores the ability of RBCs to convert PEP + adenosine diphosphate to pyruvate + ATP and 
thereby normalizes RBC metabolism in patients with PK deficiency. 
The potential for rapid hemolysis upon abrupt withdrawal of mitapivat is anticipated from the 
drug’s known mechanism of action to activate the erythrocyte pyruvate kinase enzyme. In Hb 
responders, it is anticipated that abrupt withdrawal of the drug, which does not permanently 
cure the enzymatic defect, could result in a return to the pyruvate kinase–deficient state, 
which would lead to recurrent hemolysis.  
Evidence source and strength of evidence: 
In the clinical development program, 2 subjects (2 of 155; 1.3%) with PK deficiency 
experienced acute hemolysis upon sudden withdrawal of mitapivat dosed at 300 mg BID. In 
both subjects, a rapid Hb increase during the first 3 weeks of mitapivat treatment at 300 mg 
BID was followed by an abrupt discontinuation of mitapivat without taper, resulting in acute 
hemolysis and anemia. Two additional subjects in Study AG348-C-003 experienced 
treatment related SAEs of Haemolytic anaemia. One subject was a confirmed nonresponder. 
It was determined that these events were not due to sudden withdrawal of mitapivat but were 
more likely attributed to the subjects’ ongoing anemia. Since the establishment of this 
important identified risk, in the clinical development program, subjects are no longer started 
at a high dose of mitapivat. The maximum dose in subjects with PK deficiency is 50 mg BID. 
Subjects are dose escalated to their optimal dose to avoid rapid increase in Hb as well as 
rapid decrease in case drug therapy needs to be stopped for any reason. No additional events 
of acute hemolysis have been reported in subjects with PK deficiency where the dose taper 
has been followed as per protocol. Clinical trials can provide an estimation of the frequency 
and nature of an adverse reaction that is expected to occur in clinical practice.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Mitapivat 
Characterization of the risk: 
Acute hemolysis is a severe condition that may lead to acute exacerbation of the patient’s 
underlying health condition if left untreated. Acute hemolysis occurs in patients who are Hb 
responders when upon subsequent withdrawal of mitapivat without a gradual reduction in 
dosing, subjects experience a rapid and marked decrease in Hb accompanied by signs and 
symptoms of hemolysis. Clinical signs and symptoms of acute hemolysis are synonymous 
with those of a hemolytic episode and involve a range of signs and symptoms that may 
include acute anemia, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, decreased haptoglobin, increased lactate 
dehydrogenase, hemoglobinuria, back pain, fatigue, pallor, tachycardia, dyspnea, scleral 
icterus, and jaundice. Back pain and hemoglobinuria are key symptoms of acute hemolysis 
because they signal the onset of renal failure. 
Hemolysis treatment-related AEs were identified by searching with the MedDRA Version 
23.1 PTs Haemolysis and Haemolytic anaemia were used to search for events of acute 
hemolysis. Treatment-related hemolysis AEs were manually evaluated to identify events of 
acute hemolysis after abrupt mitapivat withdrawal.  
In the clinical development program, 6 (6 of 155, 3.9%) subjects with PK deficiency 
experienced acute hemolysis AEs, and of these subjects, 4 subjects (4 of 155, 2.6%) 
experienced at least 1 treatment-related event of acute hemolysis (Table SVII.6). There were 
only 2 subjects (2 of 155; 1.3%) identified after manual evaluation who had hemolysis AEs 
that were classified as Acute hemolysis after sudden mitapivat discontinuation.

overlap or the start date of a subsequent AE is within 1 day of the end date of an earlier AE. An AE episode is 
considered as related if any AE within the episode is reported as related. The outcome of the AE episode is the 
outcome of the last (end date) AE record. 
In both subjects, a similar clinical course was observed for the onset and laboratory 
presentation of the AEs. In both cases, the subject’s high baseline reticulocyte counts rapidly 
decreased over the first few days of mitapivat exposure, and bilirubin decreased, suggesting a 
rapid decrease in the subject’s hemolysis. At the same time the stability of the RBCs was 
confirmed by the rapid increase in Hb. When the drug was stopped, a sharp increase in 
bilirubin, suggesting increased hemolysis, matched with a sharp decrease in Hb was 
observed. In both subjects, the decrease in Hb occurred rapidly over 48 hours. The 
reticulocyte count did not increase as rapidly or return to predose levels during the period 
when the subjects did not receive drug. Both subjects recovered without sequelae and 
continued to participate in the clinical study at lower treatment doses than originally initiated. 
By contrast, subjects who missed only a few doses of mitapivat later in their treatment 
course, or for whom the dose was tapered, did not experience events indicative of acute 
hemolysis, and their Hb concentrations were either not recorded immediately after the short 
interruption or decreased gradually after the dose reduction. 
This risk will continue to be monitored via routine pharmacovigilance. Adverse events of 
acute hemolysis will be identified by using the MedDRA PTs of Haemolysis and Haemolytic 
anaemia as the search strategy.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Mitapivat 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
All patients treated with mitapivat for PK deficiency who experience sustained increases in 
Hb are at risk of acute hemolysis upon subsequent interruption or withdrawal of mitapivat 
without a gradual reduction in dosing.  
Preventability:  
Acute hemolysis due to mitapivat withdrawal can be prevented. The highest recommended 
dose of 50 mg BID for adult patients with PK deficiency is lower than the 300-mg BID dose 
taken by the subjects in the clinical development program who experienced acute hemolysis 
upon abrupt withdrawal of mitapivat. Acute hemolysis is included as a special warning and 
precautions for use in the Pyrukynd SmPC Section 4.4. The Pyrukynd SmPC Section 4.4 
states that acute haemolysis with subsequent anaemia has been observed following abrupt 
interruption or discontinuation of Pyrukynd (see SmPC Section 4.8). Abrupt interruption or 
discontinuation of treatment with Pyrukynd should be avoided. A gradual reduction in dosing 
rather than abrupt cessation is recommended (see SmPC Section 4.2). If discontinuing 
treatment abruptly, patients should be monitored for signs of acute haemolysis and anaemia, 
which may include among other symptoms and signs: jaundice, scleral icterus and dark urine.  
The SmPC Section 4.2 states that if a dose reduction is required for adverse event 
management and/or tolerability, the dose may be reduced to the next lower dose level, 20 mg 
twice daily or 5 mg twice daily. If a patient needs to discontinue the medicinal product due to 
an adverse event, the dose taper schedule (SmPC Table 2) should be followed. In situations 
where the risk to the patient due to the adverse event is greater than the risk of acute 
haemolysis due to sudden withdrawal of the medicinal product, treatment may be stopped 
without taper and patients should be monitored for signs of acute haemolysis with worsening 
of anaemia. 
In addition, in Section 4.2 of the SmPC it states that to minimize the risk of acute haemolysis, 
abrupt interruption or discontinuation of Pyrukynd should be avoided. The dose should be 
tapered to gradually discontinue the medicinal product over a 1-2 week period (see SmPC 
Table 2 [and see Table SVII.8 below]). Patients should be monitored for signs of acute 
haemolysis with worsening of anaemia (see SmPC Section 4.4 and 4.8). 
Acute hemolysis is also described in the SmPC Section 4.8 under description of selected 
adverse reactions stating abrupt interruption or discontinuation of Pyrukynd can lead to acute 
haemolysis (see SmPC Section 4.4). For guidance on how to interrupt or discontinue 
treatment see SmPC Section 4.2.

For patients receiving mitapivat 20 mg BID the Pyrukynd 20 mg film-coated tablets + 
Pyrukynd 5 mg film-coated tablets pack would be provided. This is a single carton containing 
14 tablets in 2 blister wallets containing 7 × 20 mg and 7 × 5 mg tablets. The blister cards 
will have Days 1-7 (in this case on blister cards of 20 mg) and days 7-14 (in this case on 
blister cards of 5 mg tablets) marked against each blister pocket so that the patient is aware of 
which tablet needs to be taken each day (thereby minimizing risk of medication errors). 
For patients receiving mitapivat 5 mg BID the Pyrukynd 5 mg film-coated tablets pack would 
be provided. This is a single carton containing 7 tablets of 5 mg mitapivat tablets. The blister 
cards will have Days 1-7 marked against each blister pocket so that the patient is aware which 
tablet needs to be taken each day (thereby minimizing risk of medication errors). 
Impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product: 
Acute hemolysis is a serious condition that may lead to acute exacerbation of the patients 
underlying health condition if left unmanaged. Patients with PK deficiency experience 
lifelong hemolytic anemia with subsequent associated comorbidities. They have a serious 
unmet medical need for safe and effective targeted therapies, as currently no product is 
specifically approved to manage or treat PK deficiency. The benefit of mitapivat as an 
effective treatment for PK deficiency outweighs the risk of acute hemolysis, which has been 
observed only in Hb-responding subjects at 6 times the recommended mitapivat dose and can 
be managed in clinical practice by adhering to the guidance in the Pyrukynd SmPC. Acute 
hemolysis is included as a special warning and precautions for use in the Pyrukynd SmPC 
Section 4.4 and PL Section 2. The Pyrukynd SmPC states that abrupt interruption or 
discontinuation of treatment with Pyrukynd should be avoided. A gradual reduction in dosing 
rather than abrupt cessation is recommended (see Section 4.2 of the SmPC). If discontinuing 
treatment abruptly, patients should be monitored for signs of acute haemolysis and anaemia, 
which may include among other symptoms and signs: jaundice, scleral icterus, and dark 
urine. The important identified risk will be monitored using routine pharmacovigilance (Part 
III.1). 
Public health impact: 
Treatment-related acute hemolysis after abrupt mitapivat withdrawal occurred in 2 (1.3%) 
subjects with PK deficiency treated with mitapivat in the clinical development program. 
Acute hemolysis is included as a special warning and precautions for use in the Pyrukynd 
SmPC Section 4.4 and PL Section 2. Pyruvate kinase deficiency is an extremely rare 
condition (Module SI); therefore, the overall public health impact is expected to be low.

Mitapivat 
Important Potential Risk: Embryo-fetal toxicity 
Potential mechanisms: 
Non-clinical studies  
As described in Part II of the RMP, the GLP-compliant definitive embryo-fetal development 
study in Sprague Dawley rats and New Zealand white rabbits demonstrated that fetal adverse 
effects were observed at AUC0-12hr values 63-fold (rats) and 3.1-fold (rabbits) the human 
AUC0-12hr value at 50 mg BID.  Fetal adverse effects in rats were considered likely due to sex 
hormone changes caused by aromatase inhibition. 
In the GLP-compliant combined fertility and early embryonic development study in 
Sprague Dawley rats, no effect on mating or fertility was observed at any dosage in either 
males or females. The highest dosages tested were 300 mg/kg/day in males and 
200 mg/kg/day in females, correlating with AUC0-12hr (day last) values [160,000 hr•ng/mL] 
45-fold and [174,000 hr•ng/mL] 49-fold the AUC0-12hr value in humans at 50 mg BID, 
respectively. The lowest AUC0-12hr value at which microscopic reproductive findings have 
been observed in animals was 10,900 hr•ng/mL (Module 2.6.6, Section 3.1.4), and the 
reproductive organ NOEL in the repeat-dose toxicity study in which this occurred was 
5,150 hr•ng/mL (1.4-fold the human AUC0-12hr value [3,580 hr•ng/mL] at 50 mg BID). All 
findings with the potential to impair fertility in the Sprague Dawley rats were reversible after 
discontinuation of the study drug.  
The effects of sex hormone changes due to aromatase inhibition were observed only at AUC 
values considerably higher than those observed with the 50 mg BID dose in adult humans. 
The plausible biological mechanism for the potential risk of embryo-fetal toxicity is as a 
result of blocking the production of estrogens from androgens that could lead to a decrease of 
fetal implantation, an increase of fetal death, and a variety of non-specified teratogenic 
effects (Tiboni and Ponzano, 2016).  
Evidence source and strength of evidence: 
Although human data on pregnancies are limited, there is no evidence of human 
teratogenicity based on genotoxic potential and the 2 successful pregnancies. Although 
nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies did not demonstrate teratogenicity/fetotoxicity at 
maternal exposures comparable to those in humans administered mitapivat at 50 mg BID 
(proposed clinical dose), they did demonstrate embryo-fetal toxicity at high dose levels: 
AUC0-12hr values 63- and 3.1-fold higher than the human AUC0-12hr value at 50 mg BID. 
Based on these non-clinical findings, embryo-fetal toxicity is considered an important 
potential risk (Module SVII.3.1). 
Confidential

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Mitapivat 
Characterization of the risk: 
Based on in vitro data, mitapivat is a weak aromatase inhibitor. Furthermore, based on 
nonclinical and clinical data, sex hormone changes is an identified risk (not considered 
important) associated with treatment. In clinical and nonclinical studies, mitapivat behaves 
like a reversible aromatase inhibitor. Analysis of the data suggests that the concentration of 
mitapivat in humans at the highest expected clinically efficacious dose is well below the 
concentration required to inhibit aromatase by 50%. In the clinical development program, 
there were no data suggesting that there is an increase in the risk of AEs that could be 
reasonably associated with hormone changes due to off-target aromatase inhibition by 
mitapivat. 
In animal studies, harmful effects of sex hormone changes due to aromatase inhibition 
were observed only at AUC values considerably higher than those observed with the 
50 mg BID dose in adult humans. In GLP–compliant definitive embryo-fetal 
development studies in Sprague Dawley rats and New Zealand white rabbits, effects 
consistent with sex hormone changes due to aromatase inhibition were only observed in 
rats. In rats, fetal adverse effects were observed at doses associated with day last AUC 
from 0 to 12 hours (AUC0-12hr) values 63-fold the steady-state AUC0-12hr value in 
subjects with pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK deficiency) administered mitapivat 50 mg 
BID. This included a decrease in the mean number and litter proportion of viable 
fetuses, lower mean fetal weights, and test article-related external, soft tissue, and 
skeletal malformations (Module 2.6.6, Section 6.2.1.2). The maternal and fetal NOAEL 
was seen at maternal doses associated with day last AUC0-12hr values 13-fold the steady-
state AUC0-12hr value in subjects administered mitapivat 50 mg BID. The adverse 
effects observed in rats are consistent with effects reported for aromatase inhibitors and 
are therefore likely due to sex hormone changes caused by aromatase inhibition. 
In clinical studies, aromatase-dependent hormone levels in female subjects treated with 
mitapivat were collected but were difficult to interpret due to subject menopausal status and 
contraceptive use (premenopausal vs menopausal, hormonal vs nonhormonal 
contraception); therefore, these data were considered not informative for analysis of 
mitapivat changes in sex hormones due to aromatase inhibition effects. Menstrual cycle 
diaries were originally introduced in clinical studies in 2015 to record any effects on the 
menstrual cycle of female subjects taking mitapivat. These data were subjective and not 
collected systematically; however, based on an aggregate review, no meaningful trends 
were identified that could be attributed to changes in sex hormones due to aromatase 
inhibition. 
There have been 2 pregnancies reported during the mitapivat clinical development program: 
1.  One subject became pregnant and mitapivat was immediately interrupted. The 
subject gave birth to a normal healthy baby girl at 39 weeks by planned caesarean 
section. The subject resumed mitapivat treatment after completion of breastfeeding. 
The projected exposure of the subject was 19 times lower than the exposure in rats 
at the dose where no adverse effects were observed on the fetus and the mother (ie, 
the NOAEL) (CSR AG348-C-003, Section 14.3.3). 
2.  Paternal exposure during pregnancy was reported for a male subject. The male 
subject had been receiving mitapivat for approximately 4 years before his partner 
became pregnant. The subject’s partner gave birth to a normal healthy baby at 40 
weeks via vaginal episiotomy. The subject’s partner experienced postpartum 
hemorrhage, which led to prolongation of hospitalization and red blood cell

Mitapivat 
transfusion; the postpartum hemorrhage was not considered to be related to study 
treatment. The subject’s partner subsequently recovered and was discharged (CSR 
AG348-C-003, Section 14.3.3). 
Use of mitapivat during pregnancy has not been formally studied, and a limited number of 
subjects have reported a pregnancy. Therefore, mitapivat is not recommended for use during 
pregnancy or in females of childbearing potential who are not using contraception. As the 
safety and efficacy of mitapivat in this population is not currently known, embryo-fetal 
toxicity is considered an important potential risk. 
Embryo-fetal toxicity will be monitored via routine pharmacovigilance. Adverse events of 
embryo-fetal toxicity will be identified by using the MedDRA SMQ (Broad) of Pregnancy, 
labour and delivery complications and risk factors as the search strategy.  
Post-marketing monitoring for pregnancy and lactation will occur via routine 
pharmacovigilance. A pregnancy-, lactation-, and embryo-fetal toxicity-specific follow-up 
form will be utilized by the case processing team, or extension thereof. A follow-up form is 
attached in Annex 4. 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
Risk groups include women of child-bearing potential taking mitapivat that may become 
pregnant and male partners taking mitapivat where a partner becomes pregnant.  
Preventability:  
Routine risk minimization is considered adequate to minimize the risk of embryo-fetal 
toxicity. In the Pyrukynd SmPC Section 4.6, it states that there is no or limited amount of 
data from the use of mitapivat in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see SmPC Section 5.3). Pyrukynd is not recommended during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. Women of 
childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant while receiving Pyrukynd. Women of 
childbearing potential should use contraception during treatment with mitapivat and for at 
least 1 month after the last dose. Mitapivat may decrease the systemic exposure of hormonal 
contraceptives that are sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 (see SmPC Sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Additional or alternative methods of contraception should be considered. In addition, the 
SmPC Sections 4.4 and 4.5 state that mitapivat may decrease the systemic concentrations of 
hormonal contraceptives that are sensitive substrates of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) 
(eg, ethinylestradiol). Therefore, women of childbearing potential should be counselled 
regarding the use of additional or alternative contraception methods. Section 5.3 of the SmPC 
describes the relevant preclinical safety data. 
Impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product: 
It is currently unknown what the impact of embryo-fetal toxicity might be. Clear wording 
will be included in the SmPC and PL to minimize the risk of pregnancy. The important 
identified risk will be monitored using routine pharmacovigilance whereby any use in 
pregnancy in clinical practice will be monitored using routine pharmacovigilance, including 
the pregnancy-, lactation-, and embryo-fetal toxicity-specific follow-up form (Part III.1).  
Public health impact: 
Use in pregnant patients is expected to be minimal as PK deficiency is an extremely rare 
condition (Module SI). With the routine risk minimization, it is considered that the risk will 
be adequately minimized.

Mitapivat 
SVII.3.2 Presentation of the missing information 
Missing Information 1: Use in patients with hepatic impairment 
Evidence source:  
Hepatic elimination plays an important role in the clearance of mitapivat. The metabolic 
stability of mitapivat was evaluated in rat, dog, monkey, and human liver microsomes 
(Report AG348-N-066-R1). After 45 minutes of incubation with mitapivat (1 µM) and 
NADPH (2 mM), liver microsomal CLint of mitapivat was 32.1, 22.8, 18.1, and 6.82 L/hr/kg 
in rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans, respectively. The CLhep calculated based on the CLint 
was 2.99, 1.75, 2.27, and 1.05 L/hr/kg in rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans, respectively. The 
hepatic extraction ratio was estimated to be 0.91, 0.92, 0.87, and 0.85 in rats, dogs, monkeys, 
and humans, respectively. These data suggest that mitapivat liver metabolism clearance was 
high (Module 2.6.4, Section 5.1.1.2). 
Mitapivat is known to be metabolized after oral administration with approximately 40% and 
50% of administered radioactivity in the human ADME study appearing as metabolites in the 
feces and urine, respectively (Module 2.7.2, Section 3.1.4). Therefore, there is a potential for 
hepatic impairment to affect mitapivat exposure. 
Use of mitapivat in subjects with hepatic impairment has not been evaluated in the clinical 
development program. By nature of the indication, subjects with PK deficiency are likely to 
experience chronic and acute hemolysis that may lead to increases in unconjugated bilirubin 
(Module SI). Due to this, analysis of the effect of hepatic parameters such as bilirubin on 
mitapivat PK is limited. The effect of hepatic parameters on mitapivat pharmacokinetics was 
assessed as part of a population pharmacokinetics analyses. Most subjects in the dataset had 
normal AST, ALT, and ALP at baseline. No apparent difference in steady-state AUC was 
observed in subjects with normal AST, ALT, or ALP levels versus those with elevated levels. 
Most subjects with PK deficiency in the dataset had elevated total bilirubin levels at baseline; 
nevertheless, steady-state AUC appeared to be similar among the subjects with PK deficiency 
with total bilirubin at the ranges between 1 to 2×ULN, 2 to 3×ULN, and >3×ULN (Module 
2.7.2, Section 3.2.2). Additionally, analysis of the degree of hepatic impairment in the PK 
deficiency clinical development program is unavailable as conventional hepatic dysfunction 
stratification tools (Child-Pugh, NCI-ODWG, and MELD) all use bilirubin as a criterion of 
their classifications.  
Use in subjects with hepatic impairment is considered an area of missing information as 
mitapivat has not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment and the potential for 
hepatic impairment to affect mitapivat exposure. No dose recommendations can be made, and 
the safety and efficacy of mitapivat have not been established in such subjects.  
The effect of subjects with hepatic impairment who receive mitapivat will be monitored via 
Study AG348-C-0HEP and via routine pharmacovigilance by review of AEs in subjects with 
a medical history consistent with hepatic impairment. 
Population in need of further characterization: 
Mitapivat has not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment. No dose 
recommendations can be made, and the safety and efficacy of mitapivat have not been 
established in such subjects. Because there is a potential for hepatic impairment to affect 
mitapivat exposure, it will be important to assess the findings from the planned hepatic

impairment Study AG348-C-0HEP to determine if dose adjustments of mitapivat are required 
for subjects with hepatic impairment 
Study AG348-C-0HEP is designed to evaluate the PK, safety and tolerability of mitapivat in 
subjects each with moderate or normal hepatic function (Part III.2) which is aligned with the 
CHMP guidance on the ‘Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products in patients 
with impaired hepatic function’ (2005).  
Hepatic impairment is included as a special population in the Pyrukynd SmPC Sections 4.2 
and 5.2. In the Pyrukynd SmPC Section 4.2, it states that there are no data available in 
patients with hepatic impairment. No dose recommendations can be made. In the Pyrukynd 
SmPC Section 5.2, it states that the pharmacokinetics of mitapivat in patients with mild, 
moderate, or severe hepatic impairment have not been studied.  
Missing Information 2: Long-term use  
Evidence source:  
The primary studies providing evidence of long-term use of mitapivat in the proposed 
indication for the treatment of PK deficiency are Studies AG348-C-003 and AG348-C-011. 
Study AG348-C-008 (Peak Registry) will also provide supportive evidence for subjects that 
are receiving mitapivat. 
Study AG348-C-003 is an ongoing Phase 2, open-label, 2-arm, multicenter, randomized, 
dose-ranging study assessing the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity of mitapivat in adult subjects with PK deficiency.  
The study consists of a completed 24-week Core Period and an ongoing 8-year Extension 
Period. This study initiated on 26 June 2015 and last patient last visit is anticipated in May 
2025. In this study, subjects have received doses ranging from 5 mg 3 times a week to 
300 mg BID. As of 28 August 2020 (the interim data-cut for this study), 52 subjects have 
initiated treatment with 18 subjects ongoing treatment in the study.  
Study AG348-C-008 is an ongoing Agios-sponsored, global, retrospective and prospective, 
longitudinal observational study of pediatric and adult patients with PK deficiency.  
The Peak Registry was designed to understand better the natural history of PK deficiency, 
including diagnosis, demographic and clinical characteristics, burden of disease, treatment 
patterns, and clinical outcomes in a real-world setting. The registry enrolled its first patient in 
April 2018 and will continue enrolling through Q2 2025. The study is expected to be 
completed in Q2 2027 with database lock in Q3 2027, providing at least 2 years and up to 9 
years of patient follow-up data. As of 08 March 2022, the Peak Registry had 240 patients 
enrolled from 48 sites in 16 countries, predominantly located in North America and Europe. 
This is a Category 3 PASS study, see Table III.1 Ongoing and Planned Additional 
Pharmacovigilance Activities 
Study AG348-C-011 is an ongoing Phase 3, multicenter, open-label extension study for 
subjects who have completed Study AG348-C-006 or AG348-C-007 and meet all other 
eligibility criteria for Study AG348-C-011. The overall duration of the study is approximately 
5 years. This study initiated on 21 March 2019 and last patient last visit is currently 
anticipated in November 2024. As of 12 November 2020 (interim data-cut for this study), 
88 subjects had initiated treatment with 78 subjects still ongoing treatment in the study. This 
is a Category 3 PASS study, see Table III.3.1 Ongoing and Planned Additional 
Pharmacovigilance Activities.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Mitapivat 
The long-term safety profile of mitapivat is consistent with the safety profile during the 
24-week on-treatment period. The most commonly reported events during the cumulative 
period were similar to those reported during the 24-week on-treatment period, and most 
events continued to be Grade 1 or 2 in severity. The slight increase in percentage of subjects 
experiencing these events is considered consistent with what would be expected with 
continued treatment for a longer duration in this patient population. 
No trends in TEAEs that may be a result of long-term changes in sex hormones were 
observed, including no overall trend in decreasing BMD, signals pertaining to psychological 
disorders such as anxiety or depression, or cardiovascular disorders. Furthermore, other 
events that may be considered a long-term tolerability concern with mitapivat, such as 
repeated or worsening insomnia, were not frequently reported. Events such as triglyceride 
increases or transaminase increases were transient, and long-term safety impacts of transient 
increases in these parameters were not observed. 
Population in need of further characterization: 
The effects of long-term use of mitapivat in subjects with PK deficiency will be further 
characterized in ongoing Study AG348-C-011 and the Peak Registry (AG348-C-008) which 
are both Category 3 PASS studies. Study AG348-C-011 allows for subjects to be treated with 
mitapivat for an additional 5 years after transitioning from Study AG348-C-006 and Study 
AG348-C-007. This study has been ongoing since 21 March 2019. The Peak Registry has 
been ongoing since April 2018 and will provide up to 9 years of patient follow-up data for 
subjects that are receiving mitapivat. 
The Pyrukynd SmPC Section 4.2 of the SmPC states that treatment with Pyrukynd is 
intended to be long-term. Pyrukynd should be discontinued if a patient does not experience 
an improvement of haemolytic anaemia at the maximum recommended dose, based on the 
totality of laboratory results and clinical status of the patient, unless there is another 
explanation for response failure (eg, bleeding, surgery, other concomitant illnesses). 
The SmPC Section 5.1 states that the median duration of treatment of mitapivat was 
24.1 weeks in AG348-C-006 and median duration of treatment in AG348-C-007 was 40.3 
weeks.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of risk management plan for Pyrukynd (mitapivat) 
This is a summary of the RMP for Pyrukynd. The RMP details important risks of Pyrukynd, 
how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained about 
Pyrukynd’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Pyrukynd’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give 
essential information to health-care professionals and patients on how Pyrukynd should be 
used.  
This summary of the RMP for Pyrukynd should be read in the context of all of this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Pyrukynd’s RMP. 
1.  The Medicine and What It Is Used for 
Pyrukynd is authorized for treatment of pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK deficiency) in adult 
patients (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains mitapivat as the active substance and it 
is taken orally. 
Further information about the evaluation of Pyrukynd’s benefits can be found in Pyrukynd’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage <link to the EPAR summary landing 
page>. 
2.  Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or Further 
Characterize the Risks 
Important risks of Pyrukynd, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Pyrukynd’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, 
in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare 
professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorized pack size – the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status – the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, 
with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analyzed, including periodic safety update report (PSUR) assessment so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Pyrukynd is not yet available, it is 
listed under “missing information” below.

II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Pyrukynd are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Pyrukynd. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and 
needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Important Identified Risk: Acute Hemolysis 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Risk minimization 
measures 
Acute hemolysis is an important identified risk as it is a severe condition that 
may lead to acute exacerbation of the patient’s underlying health condition if 
left untreated. In clinical trials with Pyrukynd, 2 subjects with PK deficiency 
dosed at 300 mg BID (2 of 155; 1.3%) experienced acute hemolysis upon 
sudden withdrawal of Pyrukynd.  
All patients treated with Pyrukynd for PK deficiency who experience 
sustained increases in hemoglobin are at risk of acute hemolysis upon 
subsequent interruption or withdrawal of Pyrukynd without a gradual 
reduction in dosing. 
Routine risk minimization measures: 
To communicate and reduce the risk of acute hemolysis 
•  SmPC: Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, and 6.5 
•  PL: Sections 2, 4 and 6

development plan. 
Important Potential Risk: Embryo-fetal toxicity 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Although human data on pregnancies are limited, there is no evidence of 
human teratogenicity based on genotoxic potential, and nonclinical 
reproductive toxicity studies did not demonstrate teratogenicity/fetotoxicity at 
maternal exposures comparable to those in humans administered mitapivat at

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Mitapivat 
Important Potential Risk: Embryo-fetal toxicity 
50 mg BID (proposed clinical dose). In addition, mitapivat-induced changes 
in aromatase-dependent hormone levels are not associated with development 
of adverse events. However, with regard to the use of mitapivat during 
pregnancy, sex hormone changes due to off-target aromatase inhibition will 
be further monitored. 
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Embryo/fetus following a pregnancy when a female treated with mitapivat 
becomes pregnant, or a male treated with mitapivat who’s partner becomes 
pregnant.

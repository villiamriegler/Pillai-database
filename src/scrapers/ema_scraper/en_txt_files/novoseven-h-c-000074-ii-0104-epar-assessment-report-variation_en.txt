2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
18 October 2018 
NovoSeven is indicated for the treatment of bleeding episodes and for the prevention of bleeding in those 
undergoing surgery or invasive procedures in the following patient groups: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
in patients with congenital haemophilia with inhibitors to coagulation factors VIII or IX > 5 
Bethesda Units (BU) 
in patients with congenital haemophilia who are expected to have a high anamnestic response to 
factor VIII or factor IX administration 
in patients with acquired haemophilia 
in patients with congenital FVII deficiency 
in patients with Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia (GT) with antibodies to GP IIb - IIIa and/or HLA, and 
with past or present refractoriness to platelet transfusions  
The  recommended  dose  regimen  in  GT  is  90  µg  (ranging  from  80  to  120  µg)  per  kg  body  weight  at 
intervals of 2 hours (ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 hours). At least 3 doses should be administered to secure 
effective haemostasis. 
Purpose of this variation application 
The MAH applies to extend use of Novoseven in patients with GT to: 
●  patients  with  Glanzmann’s  thrombasthenia  with  past  or  present  refractoriness  to  platelet 
transfusions, with or without antibodies to platelets, or where platelets are not readily available. 
Brief regulatory history 
NovoSeven  (rFVIIa)  was  first  granted  marketing  authorisation  in  the  EU  in  February  1996  for  the 
indications in patients with congenital haemophilia with inhibitors to coagulation factors VIII or IX and in 
acquired haemophilia. Approval for the above mentioned GT and FVII deficiency indications was granted 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690988/2018  
Page 5/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in January 2004. In the variation procedure for the indication in GT, the MAH had applied for approval for 
the following indication: 
EMA noted that “platelet transfusion is the  current standard treatment of GT  when local measures or 
antifibrinolytic  drugs  fail  to  stop  bleeding  or  during  invasive/surgical  bleeding.  Even  patients  with 
anti-GPIIb/IIIa and/or anti-HLA antibodies are not per definition refractory to platelets”, therefore the 
current GT indication was approved. 
Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia (GT)  
GT  is  a  rare  (prevalence  estimated  ~  1/1,000,000  in  Western  populations)  congenital  autosomal 
recessive bleeding disorder caused by deficiency or abnormality of the platelet membrane glycoprotein 
IIb-IIIa (GPIIb-IIIa), a fibrinogen receptor. On activated platelets, the GPIIb-IIIa complex is involved in 
platelet aggregation mediated by fibrinogen binding to this complex.  
In  Type  I  GT  there  are  less  than  5%  of  normal  GPIIb-IIIa  levels  and  in  Type  II  these  are  5−20%  of 
normal. In variant-type the level of GPIIb-IIIa is above 20% with dysfunctional proteins or the level is not 
defined. Bleeding in GT may be mild to severe. 
Women with GT are particularly disadvantaged since they in addition to the other bleeding symptoms also 
can have excessive bleeding during menstruation, pregnancy and childbirth. 
Management of GT 
As  the  bleeding  tendency  and  severity  varies  in  patients  with  GT,  the  treatment  demands  vary 
considerably. 
Mild  and  moderate  bleeding  episodes  often  can  be  controlled  by  conservative  methods  such  as  local 
compression,  local  haemostatic  agents  (fibrin  glue)  and  anti-fibrinolytic  drugs.  However,  when  such 
treatment fails, the treatment approach is transfusion of platelets.  
Platelet transfusion is the standard therapy to control severe bleeding episodes and to prepare patients 
for surgical interventions. Large amounts of platelets may be required. 
In GT, refractoriness to platelet transfusion can be considered when platelet transfusions are clinically 
ineffective in achieving haemostasis e.g. due to infection, bleeding, splenomegaly or medication. Immune 
causes  of  refractoriness  include  allo-immunisation  to  human  leucocyte  antigen  (HLA)  and/or  human 
platelet  antigen  (HPA)  due  e.g.  most  often  to  prior  exposure  from  transfusion,  pregnancy  or 
transplantation. 
Mechanism of action of rFVIIa in GT 
Local  enhancement  of  thrombin  generation,  mediated  by  rFVIIa,  is  able  to  increase  adhesion  of 
GPIIb/GPIIIa-deficient platelets. Enhancement of adhesion does not result in a stable platelet plug, but 
provides an increase of pro-coagulant surface at the site of injury, thus facilitating a further enhancement 
of thrombin generation and subsequent fibrin formation. Activated GT platelets cannot bind fibrinogen, as 
they lack the fibrinogen receptor (GPIIb/IIIa). However, binding of fibrin/polymeric fibrin to an as yet 
unidentified platelet surface receptor can mediate aggregation of the GT platelets at the wound site. This 
fibrin-mediated GT platelet aggregation was partially dependent on binding of thrombin to GPIb. Fibrin 
appeared an active participant in mediating platelet aggregation partly in a receptor-mediated manner as 
opposed to being passively trapped, since aggregation was less efficient if viable platelets were replaced 
by fixed platelets.

Glanzmann’s Thrombasthenia Registry 
The  condition  for  approving  the  variation  application  was  the  commitment  by  Novo  Nordisk  A/S  to 
establish  a  post-marketing  efficacy  and  safety  data  collection  system  collecting  specified  clinical  data 
from  patients  with  GT  treated  with  rFVIIa.  The  focus  should  be  on  the  administered  dose  regimens, 
efficacy and safety (especially the occurrence of thromboembolic complications in relation to concomitant 
use of anti-fibrinolytics). 
Reporting from the GTR 
The  GTR  was  initiated  in  2004  and  after  initial  delays  in  order  to  optimise  its  operation;  five  interim 
reports  were  submitted  by  Novo  Nordisk.  These  reports  have  been  assessed  by  the  Rapporteur,  and 
assessment  reports  have  been  issued  in  October  2007,  December  2008,  May  2009,  July  2010  and 
September 2011 respectively. The commitment was fulfilled with the submission of the 5th GTR report to 
the EMA in February 2011. However, the GTR was continued until its closure in December 2011 and a final 
GTR report version 6.0 was prepared (report date 23 August 2013). 
Expert panel meetings – statement 
Several  expert  panel  meetings  were  conducted  during  the  registry.  The  expert  panel  meeting  in 
November 2010 resulted in a statement from the expert panel regarding the following points: 
●  Definition of platelet refractoriness in GT 
●  Concomitant use of rFVIIa and platelets – are the patients refractory? 
●  GT indication: the relevance of both platelet refractoriness and platelet antibodies as prerequisite to 
use rFVIIa 
●  Re-bleeding/post-surgical bleeding – definitions 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The  Applicant  states  that  since  the  Glanzmann  Thrombasthenia  Registry  (referred  to  as  GTR) 
(F7HAEM-3521  (F7GLANZ))  was  based  on  clinical  data  collected  from  general  clinical  practice;  the 
patient’s records met the standards of the participating sites. Good Clinical Practice (GCP) required for 
clinical trials could not be expected to be met. However, to ensure a certain data quality, randomly chosen 
sites (corresponding to about 10% to 20% of the reported cases) and sites where Novo Nordisk identified 
a need were monitored. All serious adverse events were to be monitored and data validated by Novo 
Nordisk A/S. 
Data Sources 
To  support  this  extension  of  the  indication,  data  from  the  GTR,  (a  post-marketing,  observational, 
multinational web-based registry), literature review and adverse events reported spontaneously to Novo 
Nordisk are used. An overview of data source is provided in Table 1 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690988/2018  
Page 7/57 
 
 
 
 
 
Source data are included in the dossier as follows: 
●  GTR. 
●  Published literature. 
●  Novo Nordisk safety database with spontaneous reports, solicited reports from post observational 
studies/registries and cases published in the literature. 
Published literature was searched for the period 01 January 1999 to 01 December 2017 and included only 
medical literature published in English. Overall, there were 143 literature references identified during the 
search, 14 of which contained sufficient predefined assessments of efficacy to warrant inclusion.

retraction and prolonged bleeding time or prolonged platelet function analyser closure time. The 
patients have normal platelet counts and platelet morphology. Optional diagnosis criteria are 
quantitative or qualitative evaluation of GPIIb/IIIa receptors including flow cytometry and 
identification of gene defects. 
●  Signed informed consent by the patient or next of kin or legally acceptable representative to 
collect data on treatment of a given bleeding episode or surgical event as specified in the protocol. 
Consent must also be obtained from the patient as soon as he or she is able to do so. Informed 
consent must be obtained before entry of data into the registry. 
Both retrospective (as of 2004) and prospective cases were entered into the registry. 
Exclusion criteria: 
Patients with acquired thrombasthenic states caused by autoimmune disorders (acute or chronic) or 
drugs were to be excluded from entering the registry. 
Treatments 
The registry collected data from patients with GT treated with rFVIIa. The registry also collected data from 
patients with GT treated with other systemic haemostatic treatments (with or without antifibrinolytic 
drugs or other agents) used in the clinics. 
All patients in the GTR were treated in accordance with local treatment practices and patients exposed to 
rFVIIa were treated according to the EU package insert for Novoseven or based on medical judgement by 
the primary physician in an open-label manner. No drugs were supplied for this registry. 
For comparison, information about the efficacy of other haemostatic treatments in patients with GT is also 
included in the registry. 
Concomitant therapy 
For the rFVIIa treated patients, any other haemostatic medication and non-haemostatic treatment at the 
time of a bleeding episode or surgical event was registered as concomitant medication. 
Objectives 
The objectives of the registry were: 
●  To evaluate the efficacy and safety of rFVIIa during bleeding episodes and for the prevention of 
bleeding during invasive procedures/surgery in patients with GT with past or present 
refractoriness to platelet transfusions. Attention was directed towards complications related to 
thromboembolic events and concomitant medications, especially anti-fibrinolytics. 
●  To describe the outcome of bleeding episodes and surgeries requiring systemic haemostatic 
treatment (with or without antifibrinolytic drugs or other agents) in patients with GT in real-life 
clinical settings. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy of treatments given for a bleeding episode or for surgery was evaluated. 
Efficacy variables recorded in the treatment of bleeding episodes 
●  Cause of bleed (spontaneous, traumatic and other [non-surgical]) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690988/2018

●  Post-infusion complications/adverse events (yes/no) 
●  Efficacy evaluation 
The rFVIIa administrations could be entered in the registry with dose, date and time for a maximum of 10 
administrations. All administrations above 10 could only be entered as the total dose given for all 
additional administrations. 
Efficacy evaluation of bleeding episodes 
An overall efficacy evaluation was performed for patients treated on-demand for a bleeding episode by 
the end of the treatment according to the following scale and definitions presented in Table 2. 
The time between the first rFVIIa dose administration and performance of the overall efficacy evaluation 
was assessed and entered into the GTR. 
Table 2  Efficacy evaluation scale and definition during bleeding episodes 
If the treatment was considered partially effective or ineffective, the treatment used instead was 
specified: 
1. Treatment stopped and alternative treatment started 
The treatment was evaluated as partially effective or ineffective (as appropriate) and the effect of the 
alternative treatment was entered. 
2. Treatment continued and additional treatment added 
The combined effect was evaluated using the standard evaluation scheme. Additional treatment should 
be entered in ‘Concomitant treatment’. A note on combined effect of treatment and concomitant 
treatment could have been entered. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690988/2018  
Page 10/57 
 
 
 
 
 
Re-bleeding  
Re-bleeding was defined as a bleeding starting more than 6 hours, but less than 48 hours after arrest of 
previous bleed.  
In case of re-bleeding, the location, bleeding intensity, days after treatment start and time after last 
treatment dose were assessed and entered into the GTR.  
Prophylactic treatment during surgery 
If the patient was treated prophylactically before and during surgery (including invasive or dental 
procedures), the following information was recorded: 
●  Type of surgery (elective or emergency) 
● 
Indication for surgery and type of surgery 
●  Date and time of surgery (start and stop time) 
●  Treatment prior to, during and after surgery 
●  Platelet transfusion (type and dose) 
● 
rFVIIa administration (date, time and dose for all doses given) 
●  Anti-fibrinolytics (type) 
●  Other haemostatic treatments (type) 
●  Heparin prophylaxis (yes/no) 
●  Other concomitant medications (other than haemostatics) (yes/no) 
●  Concomitant illness (yes/no) 
●  Complications/adverse events (yes/no) 
●  Haemostatic evaluation 
The rFVIIa administrations could be entered in the registry with dose, date and time for a maximum of 20 
administrations prior to, during and after surgery (thus a maximum of 60 rFVIIa administrations could be 
entered). All administrations above 20 could only be entered as the total dose given for all additional 
administrations (prior to, during and after surgery). 
Haemostatic evaluation of surgery 
Similarly, an overall haemostatic evaluation was performed for patients treated in relation to surgery 
according to the scale and definitions presented in Table 3. 
Table 3  Overall haemostatic evaluation scale and definition during surgery 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690988/2018  
Page 11/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following results were reported for patients treated during surgery (including invasive or dental 
procedures): 
●  Haemoglobin level prior to and 24 hours after surgery (g/dL or mmol/L)  
●  Units of RBC given during surgery, within 24 hours after surgery and from 24 hours after surgery 
to time of hospital discharge (units) 
●  Time spent in hospital post-operation (total days) 
Safety variables 
The following safety variables were recorded: 
●  Adverse events 
●  Clinical laboratory adverse events 
●  Serious adverse events 
●  Non-serious adverse events 
●  Medical events of special interest which included thromboembolic events, immunogenicity, 
medication errors (wrong drug administration or wrong route of administration) and suspected 
transmission of an infectious agent via the product. 
Reporting of adverse events 
All adverse events either observed by the treating physician or reported spontaneously by the patient 
were collected from the first administration of pharmaceutical products and until 24 hours after the last 
dose and subsequently entered into the GTR. The physician was required to report serious adverse events 
and medical events of special interest involving rFVIIa to Novo Nordisk A/S within 24 hours of obtaining 
knowledge about the event. The physician informed regulatory authorities and independent ethics 
committee/institutional review board (IEC/IRB) of serious adverse events not related to rFVIIa treatment 
in accordance with local requirements. 
Clinical laboratory tests 
Assessments of prothrombin time, platelet count and fibrinogen were optional. If the assessments were 
performed, values obtained at the time of administration and 2 hours after the administration of rFVIIa 
were to be entered into the GTR. If more doses of rFVIIa were given, laboratory values obtained at the 
same time points were to be entered into the GTR. 
Sample size 
According to the protocol, sample size was not calculated prospectively as data collection was to run until 
adequate efficacy and safety information is accumulated or for a maximum of six years. All patients in the 
registry were included in the GTR report. 
Data handling 
The patients were assigned randomly generated numbers. No personal information was entered in the 
registry. All data management and data validation were performed by Novo Nordisk A/S. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690988/2018  
Page 12/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cases were considered complete if: they contained sufficient medical information to allow for a medical 
evaluation of the event; all data points on the query list were filled in and the case did not contain internal 
conflicting information. The data in the GTR eCRF have systematically been reviewed by an internal 
medical haematologist analysing all cases in the GTR. 
Queries were sent out to sites in case of missing, inconsistent or ambiguous information. Answers to 
queries were entered in the eCRF. Subsequently these answers have been cleared by medical check for 
validity. After completion of checks for each case, the case was locked, thus preventing further changes 
by centres or data managers. 
Randomisation 
Not applicable.  
Blinding (masking) 
This trial is an observational study without any blinding issues. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
In the GTR report no analysis sets were defined, but all data from all subjects/admissions are presented. 
This did not compromise the protocol, since all efficacy and safety data are presented for all 
subjects/admissions where data are available. 
Descriptive statistics 
All evaluations were summarised. Summary tables for numerical variables included mean, standard 
deviation, median, min. and max. Categorical variables were summarised as numbers and percentages. 
Statistical analyses were to be performed where applicable. 
Efficacy variables and analyses 
Efficacy evaluations were summarised as number of subjects, number of admissions, number and 
percentage of admissions with each efficacy evaluation according to the SAP . 
Safety variables and analyses 
●  Frequency of adverse events and serious adverse events during and after administration of rFVIIa 
either on-demand or prophylactically 
●  Changes in laboratory parameters (prothrombin time, platelet count, fibrinogen) if available 
Protocol amendments 
Protocol version 1.0 was dated 21 December 2004. 
Only amendment points considered to be relevant are mentioned here. 
Protocol Version 2.0, dated 20 July 2005 
Adding the possibility for the physician to enter data on a paper case report form versus electronic entries. 
This increased the number of participating sites by allowing investigators who did not have internet 
access to enter data on a paper CRF. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690988/2018  
Page 13/57 
 
 
 
 
Protocol Version 3.0, dated 10 January 2008 
−  Planned inclusion of first patient changed from Q1 2005 to Q1 2007. 
−  Planned recruitment period changed from 2 - 6 years to 2 - 4 years. 
−  Cases generated from 2004 may be entered into the registry retrospectively. 
Protocol Version 4.0, dated 11 February 2008 
Reporting frequency changed to twice a year. 
A second substantial amendment was prepared in which planned changes to protocol version 4.0 
included: 
−  a clarification of the timelines of the study (planned data capture period was to be changed to 2-6 
years), 
−  a clarification of re-bleeding for bleeding episodes and  
− 
the voluntary inclusion of DNA analysis for diagnosis of GT.  
In most of the countries involved in the registry and as per local regulations, the DNA test would have 
implied the study to be changed from ‘observational’ to ‘interventional’. Thus, this amendment was not 
accepted. 
Queries sent to all sites participating in the registry revealed that in most cases this diagnosis is not 
performed by analysis of genetic defect/mutation. 
Sites were informed of the clarification of re-bleeding for bleeding episodes and also of the definition of 
post-surgical bleeding.

There were a total of 218 patients with GT with 1073 admissions included in the registry. 
Recruitment 
Patients were recruited to the registry at 45 sites from 15 countries worldwide (one site in the USA, one 
in Pakistan, 6 in Algeria and the rest in 13 countries in Europe). The GTR was initiated on 31 December 
2004 (first entry of data was 10 May 2007). Since admissions could be entered retrospectively, the first 
admission date is 1January 2004. The GTR was closed on 16 December 2011. 
Seven treatment groups were defined as shown in Table 4.

Some patients and admissions were not included in the registry due to various reasons: 
−  Admission date is prior to 01-01-2004 (n=19 admissions). 
−  Not accepted as case was entered into the database after the cut-off date of 20-10-2011 (n=9 
admissions). 
−  No systemic, haemostatic treatment given (n=18 admissions). 
−  Deleted by investigator, no reason provided (n=5 admissions). 
Deleted by investigator, as information on treatment regimen was not available. (n=1 admission). 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations 
All patients included in the registry met the inclusion criteria, and none met the exclusion criteria. 
There were no procedural deviations as patients were treated according to general local practice with no 
specific procedures requested. 
Baseline data 
All Patients in the GTR 
Patient demographics in the GTR are summarised in Table 5.  
Of the 218 patients in the registry 127 patients (58%) were females. The mean age was 20.4 years 
(range 0-80 years).  
In (34%) of patients the diagnosis was type I GT, 10% had Type 2 GT and disease type was unknown.  
In 114 (52%) patients (in 2 patients the information was missing). The genetic defect was specified in 23 
patients.

Patients treated with Novoseven 
Demographics for the GTR population treated with NovoSeven are shown in Table 6. 
Of the 133 patients treated with NovoSeven, 75 (56%) were female. The mean age was 24.1 years 
(range: 0−80 years). The populations included a substantial number of young children (31% aged <12 
years) and adults (56% aged ≥18 years). The majority of patients were Caucasian (54%). 
The majority of patients (47%) had type I GT and in 41% of patients disease type was unknown.

Numbers analysed 
Patients treated with Novoseven 
133 patients (492 admissions) were treated with NovoSeven with or without other haemostatic 
treatment. 
−  94 patients with 333 admissions for bleeding episodes and 
−  77 patients with 159 admissions for surgical procedures  
NovoSeven was given alone or in combination with platelets and/or another haemostatic treatment 
resulting in the following 4 treatment groups and numbers who received those treatments for an 
admission (Table 7).

Note that patients could have both bleeding episodes and surgeries registered, and that the treatment 
could vary between the admissions; thus, the sum of the number of patients in each treatment group 
does not always add up to the total number of patients in the presented tables, but may be a higher 
number (see also red boxed information in Table 8).

Outcomes and estimation 
Definition of refractoriness 
In GT, refractoriness to platelet transfusion can be considered when platelet transfusions are clinically 
ineffective in achieving haemostasis.  
In the GTR, past or present refractoriness to platelets was defined clinically as: 
●  Persistence of bleeding despite an adequate amount of platelet infusions, or 
●  Re-bleeding within 24 hours despite an adequate amount of platelet infusions, or 
●  Bleeding during surgery despite an adequate amount of platelet infusions. 
An ‘adequate amount’ was determined by the clinician. 
Platelet refractoriness and antibodies 
Data presented from the GTR in relation to refractoriness and antibody status are defined per patient as: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690988/2018  
Page 18/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
●  Positive (POS): at least one positive answer at any admission. 
●  Negative (NEG): 
no positive answers, but at least one negative. 
●  Unknown (UNK): 
only unknown or missing answers. 
It can be recalled that 133 patients in the GTR were treated with NovoSeven (Table 9 and Table 10). 
Table 9 
Refractoriness to platelets and presence of antibodies 
Primarily, results for the following 3 categories are described: 
● 
(NEG/NEG):  without refractoriness and antibodies to platelets  (37/133 [27.8%]  196 
admissions) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690988/2018  
Page 19/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
● 
(POS/POS): 
  with refractoriness and antibodies to platelets  (22/133 [16.5%]; 76 
admissions) 
● 
(POS/NEG):  with refractoriness but without antibodies to platelets  (8/133 [6.0%] 43 
admissions) 
The proportion of Novoseven treated patients without antibodies to platelets (irrespective of 
refractoriness status) (49% [65 of 133 patients], was similar to the proportion of patients with antibodies 
to platelets (45% [60 of 133 patients]) Table 9 and Table 10.  
The proportion of Novoseven treated patients without refractoriness to platelets (irrespective of antibody 
status) was 47% (63 of 133 patients) compared to with refractoriness to platelets 23% (31 of patients 
Table 9 Table 10.  
Further details of numbers of patients and admissions according to possible combinations of 
refractoriness and antibody status by treatment group are given in Table 10. 
A similar pattern was seen for bleeding episodes and surgery.  
Table 10 Refractory and antibody categories by NovoSeven treatment 
With regard to treatment, the overall pattern in refractoriness and antibody status was similar for 
bleeding episodes and surgery. Further, for both bleeding episodes and surgery, the proportion of 
patients within each refractoriness and antibody category, was comparable between the treatment 
groups; however, the number of patients in some of the categories was rather small. 
Platelet refractoriness and antibodies by age 
Overall, the pattern in relation to refractoriness and antibody status was similar for the 3 age groups and 
in line with the overall results in all patients. The number of patients in the age group 12−17 years was 
low (19 patients) compared to the age groups <12 years and ≥18 years (41 and 77 patients, respectively 
Table 11). 
Generally, a similar pattern in refractoriness and antibody status was seen for bleeding episodes and 
surgery and in line with the overall results in all patients.

Dosing and efficacy – bleeding episodes 
Dosing in bleeding episodes  
Though there was large variation, the median dose per infusion of NovoSeven in all patients (90 μg/kg) 
was in line with the recommended and approved dose regimen in GT; that being 90 μg/kg (range 80-120 
μg/kg) at intervals of 2 hours (1.5–2.5 hours). The median dose was similar for all 4 treatment groups (90 
μg/kg) Table 12. In Table 13 the dose according to bleed severity is given.

Paediatric population 
Dose 
Regardless of age or treatment group, the median dose per infusion was similar, except for the N7P 
group, with only 1 admission in the adolescent group and a dose of 288 µg/kg. 
Efficacy 
In the N7 group, the treatment was effective in 84 (79%) bleeds in children, in 9 (82%) bleeds in 
adolescents and 35 (95%) bleeds in adults. In the N7OH group the proportion of effective treatments in 
children (84%) was higher than that of adults (76%) or adolescents (61%). In the N7POH group the 
proportion of effective treatments in children (69%) and adults (71%) were similar (Table 15). 
Table 15  Efficacy in bleeding episodes by age 
Efficacy by treatment and by refractoriness and antibody status 
In all patients, treatment with NovoSeven was evaluated as effective in 79% of the bleeding episodes 
(262 of 333 admissions). Further, in each treatment group, the majority of admissions were evaluated to 
be effective (range: 65%−86%). A summary of efficacy for bleeding episodes for the 4 treatment groups 
is shown in Table 16. 
Irrespectively  of  refractoriness  and  antibody  status,  the  majority  of  admissions  were  evaluated  as 
effective (range: 56%−100%). When comparing the 3 categories ’without refractoriness and antibodies 
to platelets’ (Refr NEG/AB NEG), ‘with refractoriness but without antibodies to platelets’ (Refr POS/AB 
NEG)  and  ‘with  refractoriness  and  antibodies  to  platelets’  (Refr  POS/AB  POS),  the  effectiveness  was 
similar in patients in these 3 categories (85%, 74% and 72%, respectively) and in line with effectiveness 
in all patients treated with NovoSeven (79%) Table 16.

In  the  age  groups  <12  years,  12−17  years  and  ≥18  years,  the  effectiveness  in  patients  without 
refractoriness and antibodies to platelets (Refr NEG/AB NEG),  was 83%, 82% and 95%, respectively. In 
patients with refractoriness but without antibodies to platelets (Refr POS/AB NEG), the effectiveness was 
81%, 0% and 67%, respectively (in the age group 12−17 years, only 1 patient had 1 admission which 
was evaluated as ‘partially effective’). In patients with refractoriness and antibodies to platelets (Refr 
POS/AB POS), the effectiveness were 68% and 76% (age groups <12 years and ≥18 years; there was no 
patients in the age group 12−17 years in this category) (Table 6). 
Dosing and efficacy - surgery 
Dosing by treatment 
As seen for bleeding episodes, there was a large variation in the dose per infusion of NovoSeven; 
however, the median dose in all patients (92 μg/kg; Table 4–8) was in line with the recommended and 
approved dose regimen in GT (90 μg [range 80−120 μg] per kg). The median dose was similar for all 4 
treatment groups (90−95 μg/kg) (Table 17).

Dose 
The median dose in the surgeries in the 6 adolescent patients was 120 µg/kg and was 90 µg/kg in the rest 
of the paediatric surgical admissions. 
Efficacy 
Efficacy in surgeries by age are shown in Table 18. Efficacy was lowest in children (50%) and adults 
(79%) treated in the N7POH group (Table 18).

Dosing by refractoriness and antibody status 
The median dose per infusion was generally similar across the refractoriness and antibody status 
categories (~90 μg/kg [range: 90−142 μg/kg]); however, for patients with refractoriness to platelets but 
without antibodies the median dose was slightly higher (142 μg/kg) Table 19 . 
A large variation in total dose of NovoSeven and duration of treatment was seen; however, both total 
dose and duration of treatment was similar for patients without refractoriness and antibodies to platelets, 
patients with refractoriness but without antibodies to platelets and patients with refractoriness and 
antibodies to platelets (median total dose: 270 μg/kg, 315 μg/kg and 300 μg/kg, respectively; mean 
duration of treatment: 4.8 hours, 6.0 hours and 4.0 hours, respectively) Table 19.

Efficacy by treatment and by refractory and antibodies 
In all patients, a treatment including NovoSeven was evaluated as effective in 88% of the admissions 
(140 of 159 admissions). As seen for bleeding episodes, the majority of admissions in each treatment 
group were evaluated to be effective (range: 68%−100%). A summary of efficacy for all NovoSeven 
treatment groups is shown in Table 20. 
Irrespectively of refractoriness and antibody status, the vast majority of admissions were evaluated as 
effective (range: 67%−100%). As seen for bleeding episodes, the effectiveness was similar in patients in 
the categories ’without refractoriness and antibodies to platelets’, ‘with refractoriness but without 
antibodies to platelets’ and ‘with refractoriness and antibodies to platelets’ (95%, 67% and 95%, 
respectively) and in line with effectiveness in all patients treated with NovoSeven (88%). In the category 
‘with refractoriness but without antibodies to platelets’, where 67% of the admissions was evaluated as 
effective (8 of 12 admissions), the remaining 33% (4 of 12 admissions) were evaluated as partially 
effective (Table 20)

Due to the low number of patients in the age groups <12 years and 12−17 years (0−5 patients) a 
comparison of these age groups in the 3 categories ‘without refractoriness and antibodies to platelets’, 
‘with refractoriness but without antibodies to platelets‘, and ‘with refractoriness and antibodies to 
platelets‘, is not considered relevant. In the age group ≥18 years, effectiveness in patients in the 3 
categories was similar (100%, 73% and 94%, respectively) (Table 9). 
Published literature 
A literature search was performed by Novo Nordisk Global Information and Analysis (GLIA) using BIOSIS 
Previews, Current Contents Search, Embase and MEDLINE. The literature review covered data from 01 
January 1999 to 01 December 2017 and included only medical literature published in English. In all, 143 
literature references were identified during the search, 14 of which contained sufficient predefined 
assessments of efficacy to warrant inclusion. All GT cases of treatment and prevention of bleedings 
(during delivery and surgery) in all ages and both genders in the reported period have been evaluated. 
The MAH concludes that, overall, the published literature showed that a treatment regimen of NovoSeven 
alone, or based mainly on NovoSeven, reduces platelet transfusions, and seems to be effective and safe 
in patients with GT without antibodies to platelets, or where platelets are not readily available.  
The MAH has provided detailed information on each of the 14 literature references in Appendix 2 of the 
Clinical Overview.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The F7GLANZ study (Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia registry (GTR)) was designed as an observational, 
multinational registry to collect and evaluate the efficacy and safety of rFVIIa in patients with GT and 
past/present refractoriness to platelet transfusions. 
The GTR was established in order to fulfil the commitment imposed by the EMA at the time of approval of 
the indication in GT requiring that efficacy and safety data were to be collected from patients with GT 
treated with rFVIIa. The focus was to be on dose regimens, efficacy and safety (especially the occurrence 
of thromboembolic complications in relation to concomitant use of anti-fibrinolytics). 
Data were collected in 15 countries on the use of Novoseven as well as other treatments from January 
2004 to December 2011 in GT bleeding episodes as well as prophylaxis for surgery. An external expert 
panel was responsible for giving scientific input regarding development, establishment and conduct of the 
GTR. 
The GTR was a disease registry but was owned by Novo Nordisk A/S. Patients were treated in accordance 
with local treatment practices and no drugs were supplied.  
Patient population 
The only disease specific inclusion criterion was a diagnosis of GT, which could be made on the basis of 
platelet  function  /  aggregation  tests.  As  quantitative  or  qualitative  evaluation  of  GPIIb/IIIa  receptors 
including flow cytometry and identification of gene defects were optional diagnosis criteria, determination 
of the type of GT based on amount of GPIIb/IIIa i.e. Type I or Type II did not have to be performed. Thus 
it is not surprising that disease type was unknown in 114 (52%) patients. 
There  were  no  inclusion  criteria  specifying  refractoriness  to  platelet  transfusion  or  presence  of 
anti-platelet antibodies. There were thus several possible combinations of refractoriness and presence of 
anti-platelet antibodies resulting in corresponding subgroups, some of which are very small. 
Treatments 
Any treatment considered justified by the physician could be used which is considered appropriate in this 
observational study. This may or may not have included Novoseven. 
Sample size 
With the data submitted in the 5th interim report, it was considered by the Rapporteur that sufficient data 
had been obtained to fulfil FUM 21. 
The sample sizes of relevance to this Type II variation concern 
−  all  patients  in  the  GTR  who  were  treated  with  Novoseven  (n  =  133)  as  they  could  potentially  be 
patients “for whom platelets are not readily available.”.  
− 
the following subgroups of Novoseven treated patients: 
− 
all  patients  refractory  to  platelet  transfusions  as  they  include  patients  with  or  without 
antibodies to platelets (n = 31/133 (23%)) and 
− 
patients  refractory  to  platelet  transfusions  but  who  are  without  antibodies  to  platelets 
(n=8/133  (6%))  as  they  were  not  covered  by  the  currently  approved  indication  of  GT 
patients  “ in patients with Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia with  antibodies to GP IIb - IIIa 
and/or HLA, and  with past or present refractoriness to platelet transfusions.” This group is 
very small and efficacy has to be extrapolated from the other refractory patients and as well 
as from the other patients treated with Novoseven. 
Efficacy outcomes 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690988/2018  
Page 30/57 
 
 
 
 
The main efficacy outcome was haemostasis based on a rating of clinical response (defined in Table 2 and 
Table  3)  is  reasonably  in  line,  for  example,  with  that  mentioned  in  the  Guideline  on  the  clinical 
investigation 
of 
recombinant 
and 
human 
plasma-derived 
factor 
VIII 
products 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009 rev. 1).  in which it is recommended that response should be assessed 
as “none”, “moderate”, “good” or “excellent” by the physician. 
Considerations on data obtained from a registry 
An  advantage  of  this  registry  design  is  that  data  can  be  obtained  over  several  years  from  a  quite 
significant number of patients with a rare disease who are treated according to practice which is current 
at the treatment centres.  
However, the observational nature of the study carries with it important limitations. For example, the 
reason for a patient to be given a particular therapy is according to physician’s choice and open to bias. 
There is also the possibility of underreporting of negative experiences as recognised by the MAH. 
The GTR should give a picture of “real world” treatment of GT but this also introduces a confounding 
factor: although treatment with Novoseven was to be according to EU product information, physicians 
could use Novoseven in an open label manner according to their own medical judgement. 
Within  the  GTR,  meaningful  comparisons  between  treatments  are  hardly  possible  as  there  are  no 
pre-defined comparable subgroups. However, evaluation of the efficacy of Novoseven compared to other 
treatments was not the purpose of the registry. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the 6th Report, which included all patients up to closure of the registry in December 2011, the number 
of patients in the GTR  had increased to 218 (1073 admissions) of whom 133 (492 admissions) were 
treated with Novoseven. 152 patients (581 admissions) had received treatment other than Novoseven. 
(Patients may have been treated with or without Novoseven in different admissions meaning that the sum 
of patients who received Novoseven and those who did not is >218)).  
The 5th report had included 120 individuals (483 admissions) of whom 80 (197 admissions) were treated 
with Novoseven and 74 patients (286 admissions) received treatment other than Novoseven. 
Thus  at  closure  of  the  GTR,  of  218  patients,  more  than  half  (133  (61%)  received  treatment  with 
Novoseven either alone or in combination with platelet transfusion and/or other haemostatic therapy. 
As the sequence of the haemostatic treatments used may be related to the efficacy of N7, in order to 
better understand the use of N7, the MAH was asked to provide the number of admissions for bleeding 
events where the first line treatment contained N7 (alone or combined) and to comment on a possible 
relation to efficacy of treatment with rFVIIa. From the information provided on efficacy rates according to 
treatment sequence (N7 as first line alone or in combination), it is not possible to conclude if it might be 
more beneficial to give N7 before administering other treatments. 
Interestingly,  as  can  be  seen  in  Table  8,  Novoseven  was  part  of  the  treatment  in  38%  (333/870)  of 
bleeding admissions compared to 78% (159/204) of surgical admissions. It is described in the 6th GTR 
report that the majority of procedures were elective (90%) and that rFVIIa was used prior, during and 
after surgery. In the majority of the rFVIIa-treated surgeries, rFVIIa was administered prior to surgery 
(141 of the 159 surgeries), and in many cases also after surgery (126 of 159 admissions). In 10 surgeries 
rFVIIa was used during the procedure. There was thus apparently a physician’s choice to use Novoseven 
prior to elective surgery. 
Notably, only 22/133 patients (16.5%) who received Novoseven in the GTR in any treatment combination 
were Refract POS / AB POS and received it in line with the currently approved GT indication. 
Number of patients treated with Novoseven for any admission (bleed or surgery):  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690988/2018  
Page 31/57 
 
 
 
 
Of the 133 patients treated with Novoseven, 94 patients with 333 bleeding episode admissions and 77 
patients with159 surgery admissions received Novoseven either alone (n=62 patients) or in combination 
with platelets and/or other haemostatic treatments. 
Demographics and patient history have been presented.  The MAH presented the baseline characteristics 
of patients and bleedings/surgeries separately for those treated with N7 and without N7. This included 
patient  characteristics  (age,  sex,  pregnancy,  and  disease  type),  location  and  severity  of  the  bleeding 
episodes, type of surgery (minor/major). 
These data showed that the main differences between the patients with bleeding episodes treated with N7 
(n=94) and without N7 (n = 139) is that the first group is older (mean age 21.0 vs 15.7 years), presents 
more often with antibodies (41% vs 19%) and refractoriness (22% vs 9%). Similar differences are found 
in the surgical patients with N7 (n = 77) compared to those without N7 (n=36) with older age (mean 28.5 
vs 24.6 years), antibodies (51% vs 36%), and refractoriness (29% vs 11%). 
From  information  provided,  it  is  evident  that  the  characteristics  of  the  bleeding  episodes  are  not 
comparable, and therefore, no comparison between the efficacy of treatments with and without N7 can be 
performed.  
Information  on  both  refractory  and  antibody  status  was  present  for  only  88  patients  treated  with 
Novoseven.  
Numbers  of  refractory  patients  (n=  31)  and  haemostatic  efficacy  rating  according  to  antibody 
categories and NovoSeven treatment were: 
Refract POS / AB POS:     22 patients with 76 admissions (current indication). 
Efficacy was rated as effective in 72% (26/36) of admissions for bleeds and 95% (38/40) for surgery. 
14 patients in 31 admissions were treated only with Novoseven. 
Refract POS / AB NEG:     8  patients with 43 admissions  (covered by proposed modified (indication). 
Efficacy was rated as effective in 74% (23/31) of admissions for bleeds and 67% (8/12 with rest partially 
effective) for surgery. 
4 patients in 12 admissions were treated only with Novoseven. 
Refract POS / AB unknown:  1 patient  with 7 admissions. 
Efficacy was rated as effective in all 6 admissions for bleeds and the single admission for surgery. 
4 admissions were treated only with Novoseven. 
Numbers of non-refractory patients (n = 63) and haemostatic efficacy rating according to antibody 
categories and NovoSeven treatment were: 
Refract NEG / AB POS:     21 patients with 72 admissions (covered by proposed modified indication). 
Efficacy was rated as effective in 64% (30/47) of admissions for bleeds and 84% (21/25)for surgery. 
6 patients in 12 admissions were treated only with Novoseven. 
Refract NEG / AB NEG:      37 patients with 196 admissions  (covered by proposed modified indication). 
Efficacy was rated as effective in 85% (135/159) of admissions for bleeds and 95% (35/37) for surgery. 
18 patients in 125 admissions were treated only with Novoseven. 
Refract NEG / AB unknown:  5 patients  with 10 admissions. 
Efficacy was rated as effective in 56% (5/9) of admissions for bleeds and the single admission for surgery. 
One  patient in one admission was treated only with Novoseven. 
Keeping in mind the observational nature of the data and the fact that some subgroups are very small 
these  haemostatic  efficacy  ratings  can  be  considered  to  be  similar  over  the  various  subgroups  of 
refractoriness to platelet transfusions and antibody status. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690988/2018  
Page 32/57 
 
 
 
 
Notably, similar efficacy ratings were reported in refractory patients (n=31 of whom 22 antibody positive 
patients were covered by the current indication) and in patients (n=63) not refractory to platelets who 
received Novoseven (off-label use) but who could potentially be treated on-label in the proposed modified 
indication as patients for whom platelets are not readily available. 
In the admissions for bleeding events which were treated only with Novoseven (n=155) or with N7OH 
(n=110) – thus without platelets - the rate of effective treatment was approximately 80%. This is of 
relevance for the treatment of patients for whom platelets are not immediately available. 
Severe bleeds / major surgery 
Efficacy in bleeding events treated with Novoseven, was rated as effective in approximately 80% of the 
265 admissions for bleeds of moderate severity (ineffective in 3 admissions) and approximately 60% to 
70% of the 68 admissions for severe bleeds (ineffective in 1 admission). 
This is in contrast with the small difference observed for bleedings treated without N7: 309/386 (80%) vs 
119/151  (79%),  respectively  (Summary  Table  14.2.9  in  CSR).  There  was  no  explanation  for  this 
observation e.g.  bleeding characteristics in the data could not provide an explanation for differences in 
bleeding efficacy in bleeding events treated with Novoseven compared to bleedings treated without N7. 
The registry data show that clinicians rarely administered N7 as first line treatment in severe bleedings in 
contrast with moderate bleedings. Although it cannot be concluded from the registry data that this is the 
sole explanation for the difference in outcomes as other bleeding characteristics were also different, in the 
view of the CHMP starting treatment with N7 as early as possible appears logical. 
Efficacy in surgeries treated with Novoseven, was rated as effective in approximately 90% of the 133 
admissions  for  minor  surgeries  (ineffective  in  2  admissions)  and  in  approximately  70%  of  the  19 
admissions for major surgeries (ineffective in 1 admission).  
Dosing 
The median doses of Novoseven administered (~ 90 μg/kg) both in the treatment of bleeding episodes 
and in relation to surgical procedures, were as recommended in the approved posology for GT and the 
median intervals between doses (mostly 2 to 3 hours were close to that recommended for GT (every 1.5 
to  2.5  hours).  Doses  used  were  similar  regardless  of  refractory  or  antibody  status  but  there  was  an 
apparent trend towards a higher median number of doses in patients refractory to platelet transfusions 
than in those not refractory. 
The number of doses, total dose per admission and duration of treatment were higher in severe compared 
to moderate bleedings and in major surgery compared with minor surgery. 
There was a wide range of doses used (28 to 450 µg/kg), wider than the SmPC recommendation (80-120 
µg/kg). The MAH supplied histograms of the dose per infusion and the total dose per admission by type 
of surgery, by refractoriness/antibody status, and by age. The data of the registry indicate that clinicians 
in general follow SmPC recommendations. 
Rationale  for  treatment  of  GT  patients  with  Novoseven    irrespective  of  refractoriness  to  platelet 
transfusion or anti-platelet antibody status 
Although not completely understood, haemostatic efficacy of rFVIIa in GT is thought to be due to local 
enhancement  of 
thrombin  generation,  mediated  by  rFVIIa,  which 
increases  adhesion  of 
GPIIb/GPIIIa-deficient  platelets  which  eventually  facilitates  fibrin  formation  and  subsequent  platelet 
aggregation. Mechanistically, there is not a reason to expect that rFVIIa would work differently in patients 
who are refractory to platelet transfusions either because of clinical factors at the time of bleeding or 
because of antiplatelet antibodies. 
The desirability of being restrictive with platelet transfusions in subjects with a severe GT phenotype, for 
whom immunisation to platelets may present a serious and possibly life threatening risk of lack of efficacy 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690988/2018  
Page 33/57 
 
 
 
 
of  platelet  transfusions  at  a  time  of  major  bleeds,  is  also  a  factor  for  consideration  in  relation  to  the 
possibility of alternative treatment with rFVIIa. 
The need to prevent immunisation in women of childbearing age, which might cause immune mediated 
foetal or neonatal thrombocytopenia, is another  reason for restricting use of (unmatched) platelets if 
possible. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Overall  in  the  paediatric  age  range,  dosing  and  haemostatic  efficacy  in  the  treatment  of  bleeds  and 
surgical procedures were similar to that reported in patients ≥18 years. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In admissions for both the treatment of bleeding events and in the prevention of bleeding in patients 
undergoing surgical interventions the following can be concluded: 
•  Median  dose  range  and  dosing  interval  for  Novoseven  were  within  the  currently  recommended 
posology 
•  High rates of haemostatic efficacy and very few reports of treatment being ineffective with Novoseven 
were  seen  in  the  majority  of  admissions  with  treatment  in  64%  up  to  80%  rated  as  effective  for 
bleeding admissions and 67% up to 95% rated as effective in surgical admissions. 
• 
There was no apparent difference in the ratings of haemostatic efficacy in the different subgroups 
according to treatment combinations (with platelets and/or other haemostatic therapy) or according 
to refractoriness to platelet transfusions or antibody status. 
The efficacy of eptacog alfa for this updated indication is considered sufficiently demonstrated. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The evaluation of safety in this variation application is based on: 
●  The GTR, 
●  Single-cases with adverse drug reactions published in the literature, and 
●  Novo Nordisk safety surveillance database (ARGUS) with spontaneous reports, solicited reports 
from post-authorisation studies and registries, and reports published in the literature. 
The safety analysis population from the GTR includes all patients treated with NovoSeven in the registry. 
Given that no adverse events have been reported in patients with GT exposed to NovoSeven during 
clinical trials, and all adverse events reported are obtained from post-marketing spontaneous report and 
the published literature, the frequency of adverse drug reactions cannot be assessed. 
Patient exposure 
Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia registry 
In all, 133 patients with 492 admissions were treated with NovoSeven; 94 patients with 333 admissions 
for bleeding episodes and 77 patients with 159 admissions for surgical procedures. 
A summary of overall exposure per patient, including number of admissions, number of infusions, median

dose/infusion, median total dose per admission as provided by the MAH in response to the RfSI is given 
below (Table 21). 
Table 21  Summary of rFVIIa Dosing for Bleeding Episodes and Surgeries Treated with rFVIIa 
Adverse events 
In the GTR, 15 adverse events were reported in 9 patients. Of these 15 adverse events, 8 were 
non-serious and 7 were serious (Table 22).  Narratives on these 9 patients are provided in Table 23. No 
deaths were reported in patients receiving NovoSeven. 
 Table 22 Summary of admissions and adverse events in the GTR (all treatments) 
Two patients treated with NovoSeven had adverse events that were assessed by the investigator as 
'possibly/probably’ related to NovoSeven; ‘Nausea’, ‘Dyspnoea’ and ‘Headache’ in 1 patient (non-serious) 
and ‘Deep vein thrombosis’ in 1 patient (serious). 
The type and severity of adverse events do not indicate a difference between patients with or without 
refractoriness and patients with or without antibodies to platelets. However, the number of adverse 
events reported in the GTR is rather low and is a limiting factor for comparing the categories.

29 May 2009 at 09:30. The patient received 1 unit RBC 12 hours prior to 
surgery. The patient was treated with 0.5 units of HLA-compatible 
platelets 30 minutes prior to and during surgery. The patient was also 
treated with tranexamic acid prior to and after surgery. The patient 
received 180 μg/kg NovoSeven 7 hours after the surgery began. The 
adverse event was non-serious and judged to be unlikely related to 
NovoSeven. The patient recovered completely..

(non-serious) 
The patient (9 years at admission, unknown GT) had bleeding from a 
tooth falling out on 9 March 2010 at 19:00. The patient was treated with 
NovoSeven (2 doses of 186 and 185 μg/kg, 8 hours apart), 500 mg 
tranexamic acid, and 1 unit of platelets. The treatment was evaluated as 
effective. The adverse event was non-serious and judged to be unlikely 
related to NovoSeven. The patient recovered completely.

The patient (25 years at admission, type I GT) underwent an emergency 
laparotomy (ovarian cyst and haematoma with bilateral ureteral  
(serious) 
compression) on 06 June 2011 at 22:00. The patient was treated with 19 
doses of 142 μg/kg NovoSeven at 2−3 hour intervals starting at 22:00 
and treatment was partially effective. The patient was also treated with 
5 units of RBC within 24 hours after surgery and 3 units of platelets. The 
patient developed deep vein thrombosis. The adverse event was serious 
and judged to be probably or possibly related to NovoSeven. The patient 
did not recover.

Company comment: In this patient, the use of platelets transfusions and 
the surgical procedure (usually associated with immobilisation) are 
confounding aetiology factors for the venous thromboembolic event.

dyspnea and  
The patient (25 years at admission, type I GT and antibodies against 
headache 
GPIIb-IIIa) had flare-up of menorrhaghia 5 days after first dose of 
triptoreline. There was a drop of haemoglobin level from 8 g/dL to 6.4 
(non-serious) 
g/dL within 24 hours 4 days after the last dose of NovoSeven (96 hours). 
The patient received NovoSeven (total dose 1840 μg/kg), RBC and 
tranexamic acid. After doses of NovoSeven injected on 21 March 2010 
the patient had nausea, dyspnea and headache. A pulmonary embolism 
or a cerebral thromboembolic event were ruled out by a cerebral 
tomodensitometry and a pulmonary angioscanner. Both were normal. 
NovoSeven was interrupted 24 March 2010 at 20:00 hours because 
judged not enough effective to stop bleeding episode moreover 
concomitant nausea and dyspnea were noticed after injections. The 
investigator judged the events as probably or possibly related to 
NovoSeven, however commented: ‘effects of concomitant hormonal 
treatment, anemia and transfusions of RBC may have also played a role’. 
Washed RBCs were given to avoid anti-platelet immunisation. 
Bleeding was significantly decreased after NovoSeven reintroduction on 
25 March 2010 14:00 hours, indicating a significant effect (even partial) 
and therefore was continued until 30 March 2010. However, complete 
cessation of bleeding might be related to the effect of the hormonal 
therapy and the end of the flare-up phenomenon (typical duration of 6 
days). The adverse events were serious and judged to be probably or 
possibly related to NovoSeven. 
2290 
Rectorragia 
Refractoriness: Unknown. Antibodies: Positive. 
(1094) 
(serious) 
The patient (45 years at admission, type I GTa) underwent a 
colonoscopy with polypectomy on 06 July 2005. The patient was treated 
with 87 μg/kg NovoSeven prior to the procedure and 13 doses (87 
μg/kg) NovoSeven and tranexamic acid after the procedure. The 
treatment was evaluated as partially effective. The adverse event was 
serious and judged to be unlikely related to NovoSeven. The patient 
recovered completely. 
Post marketing experience 
Post-marketing safety data including cases published in the literature 
Safety data from the marketed use of NovoSeven has been collected in the Novo Nordisk safety database 
ARGUS since the first marketing authorisation on 28 December 1995, and specifically for GT since the first 
approval in EU in 2004. 
Up to 01 December 2017, 53 cases (34 from spontaneous sources, 2 solicited and 17 from the scientific 
literature), comprising 77 adverse drug reactions (43 serious and 34 non-serious; 47 spontaneous, 2 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690988/2018

solicited and 28 from the scientific literature) have been reported cumulatively from post-marketing 
sources within the indication of GT.  
Six case reports had a fatal outcome (1 reported in the literature and 5 reported spontaneously). Of 
these, 3 cases concerned patients with severe haemorrhage, and 2 concerned thromboembolic adverse 
drug reactions; no information is available on the sixth case. The analysis of the fatal cases did not raise 
any safety concerns. The fatal cases are described separately below. 
Important identified risks 
Based on the cumulative experience with NovoSeven, the important identified risks relevant for 
NovoSeven in GT and the number of adverse drug reactions reported post-marketing are presented in 
Table 24 and discussed below. Immunogenicity is only an identified risk for congenital factor VII 
deficiency and is therefore not described for GT. 
Table 24  Important identified risks and number of adverse drug reactions in Glanzmann’s 
thrombasthenia (post-marketing, including serious adverse drug reactions from the GTR) 
Arterial thromboembolic events 
One case comprising a serious adverse drug reaction was reported as ’Ischaemic stroke’. It concerned a 
54-year old female who was treated simultaneously with NovoSeven and platelets. After 72 hours of this 
concomitant therapy, the patient developed mental confusion. An MRI showed an ischaemic lesion of the 
left insular area with left M2 occlusion. The patient recovered from the event. No information about 
refractoriness or platelet antibodies was reported for this patient. 
Venous thromboembolic events 
A total of 8 cases comprising 9 serious adverse drug reactions concerning venous thromboembolic events 
have been reported cumulatively. Of these, 3 serious cases were reported as ’Pulmonary embolism’ (1 
with a fatal outcome, described below and also co-reported with 2 mixed thromboembolic events) and 4 
as ’Deep vein thrombosis’ (1 case was reported as both ’Deep vein thrombosis’ and ’Pulmonary 
embolism’). One case of ‘deep vein thrombosis’ was reported from the GTR. The other 2 serious cases 
were reported as ’Jugular vein thrombosis’ and ’Retinal vein thrombosis’. The analysis of these cases did 
not raise any safety concerns. 
Mixed thromboembolic events 
Three cases (2 serious and 1 non-serious) concerned mixed (arterial and venous) thromboembolic 
events. The non-serious case was reported as ’Cerebrovascular accident’ in a 30-year old female patient 
who recovered with sequelae. The 2 serious cases were reported as ’Disseminated intravascular 
coagulation’ and ’Thrombosis’ (with a fatal outcome) and as ’Atrial thrombosis’ and ’Intracardial

thrombus’ (also with a fatal outcome and with co-reported as ’Pulmonary embolism’). The fatal cases are 
described below. The analysis of these cases did not raise any safety concerns. 
Lack of efficacy 
A total of 21 cases concerned lack of efficacy. Of these, 7 were serious cases and all were reported in 
female patients. Six of the serious cases were reported in the literature and concerned patients who 
underwent major surgical procedures (4 cases) and 2 concerned patients with unsuccessful treatment of 
epistaxis. The last case was spontaneous and concerned a patient who underwent a dental extraction. 
There were 14 non-serious cases reported, 5 from the literature and 9 from spontaneous sources. Of the 
14 non-serious cases, 13 were reported as ’Drug ineffective’ and 1 as ’Therapeutic response decreased’. 
The analysis of these cases did not raise any safety concerns. Of the 21 cases concerning lack of efficacy, 
information about positive refractoriness or antibodies against platelets was reported for only 4 of the 
cases. The rest of the cases (17) did not have this information available or reported. 
Allergic reactions 
Two spontaneous serious cases concerned allergic reactions. The first case concerned an 8-year old male 
patient who underwent a surgical procedure and developed angioedema 2 hours after NovoSeven 
administration. The patient also received tranexamic acid and thrombocytes concentrate, which are 
confounding aetiology factors. The other case concerned a 39-year old female patient who experienced 
an anaphylactic reaction with angioedema and urticaria during treatment with NovoSeven. The analysis 
of these cases did not raise any safety concerns. 
Fatal cases 
In total, 6 cases with a fatal outcome have been reported cumulatively; 1 reported in the literatureand 5 
reported spontaneously. For none of the cases, information on refractoriness or platelet antibodies was 
available. The analysis of the 6 cases with a fatal outcome did not raise any safety concerns. A brief 
narrative of each case is provided below and detailed narratives on the fatal cases are provided in 
Appendix 3 of the Clinical Overview. 
Literature case 
The case (case 321755; ‘Atrial thrombosis’)38 concerned a 30-year old female who experienced 
uncontrollable epistaxis, unsuccessfully treated with several red blood cells and platelet transfusions. 
After undergoing transcatheter embolisation of various cephaleal arteries, she developed severe 
haematuria, melena, conjuntival, oropharyngeal, vaginal and diffuse alveolar haemorrhages for which 
she was treated with 3 doses of NovoSeven. The following day she was found in asystole and attempts to 
resuscitate her failed. Autopsy results revealed thrombi in the right atrium and ventricle and within the 
pulmonary vessels. 
Spontaneous cases 
One case (case 234505; ‘Intestinal ischaemia’) concerned a 15-year old male who underwent surgery due 
to perforated appendicitis. Three days after the appendicectomy the patient underwent a laparatomy 
which revealed bowel necrosis, and subsequently another laparatomy performed 6 days after the 
appendicectomy revealed that his entire stomach and bowels were necrotic. The patient was treated with 
NovoSeven in various occasions before, during, and after the appendicectomy.  
One case (case 261368; ‘Disseminated intravascular coagulation’, ‘Thrombocytopaenia, ‘Postoperative 
renal failure’, ‘Thrombosis’, and ‘Cerebral haemorrhage’) concerned a 46-year old female who underwent 
vaginal hysterectomy. Despite prophylaxis with NovoSeven, the patient had diffuse bleeding during the 
surgery and postoperatively and was treated with various infusions of platelets. The patient then 
developed disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombocytopenia and renal failure, and posteriorly

generalised microthrombosis, for which she was treated with heparin, leading to intracranial 
haemorrhage. She underwent a craniotomy for removal of the haematoma and died 1 month later. 
One case (case 413570; ‘Haemorrhage’) concerned a 7-year old female patient who was admitted to the 
hospital due to severe haemorrhage (type not reported). The patient was treated with NovoSeven (dates 
and doses unknown). It was reported that the patient died due to serious bleeding complications. No 
further information is available. 
One case (case 425990; ‘Death’) was reported by a nurse for a patient (age and gender unknown) who 
was treated with NovoSeven and died (dates of treatment, doses and date of death unknown). No further 
information is available for this case. 
One case (case 477168; ‘Vaginal haemorrhage’) concerned a 13-year old female who was admitted to the 
hospital due to vaginal haemorrhage. The patient was treated with NovoSeven and developed 
complications (not specified) and died. No further information is available about this case. 
Refractoriness and antibodies against platelets 
Of the 53 cases reported in the Novo Nordisk safety database ARGUS up to 01 December 2017, 
information on refractoriness and/or antibodies to platelet is available on 11 cases; an overview of these 
cases is provided in Table 25 and details are given in narrative line listings in Appendix 3 of the Clinical 
Overview. For the remaining 42 cases, no information on refractoriness and antibody status is available. 
Due to the low number of cases with information on refractoriness and/or antibodies to platelet (11 of the 
53 cases), a comparison between the categories with and without refractoriness and/or antibodies to 
platelet is not possible. However, the type and severity of adverse events in patients with refractoriness 
and/or antibodies to platelet does not indicate that the safety profile of NovoSeven differs from patients

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Adverse events reported in the GTR 
In the GTR there was a low number of AEs reported in patients who had received Novoseven with 15 AEs 
in 9 patients in 11 admissions (133 patients had been treated with Novoseven in 492 admissions). There 
was one report of deep vein thrombosis (judged to be probably or possibly related to rFVIIa treatment), 
3 reports of bleeding (judged to be unlikely related to rFVIIa treatment), 2 reports of infection and 2 
reports of headache and a report of nausea and dyspnoea (pulmonary embolism ruled out by imaging 
investigation). 
For  comparison,  152  individuals  had  received  treatment  which  did  not  include  Novoseven  in  581 
admissions.  There  were  31  adverse  events  in  11  patients  reported  in  20  admissions  in  which  the 
treatment included other haemostatic treatment than rFVIIa or treatment was not registered.  
These AEs consisted mainly of allergic reactions and fever/ chills (14 cases), almost all of which occurred 
in patients who had received erythrocyte or platelet transfusions and 5 reports of infections. There were 
no reports of thromboembolic AEs. 
Thus in the GTR, adverse events were reported in 9/133 (~7%) of Novoseven treated patients in 11/492 
(~2%) admissions. AEs were reported in 11/152 (also ~7%) of patients treated without Novoseven in 
20/581 (~3.5%) admissions. These rates of AE reporting are very similar. 
Overall, the type of AEs reported from the GTR can be considered as being consistent with the known 
safety profile of the treatments being given and of the bleeding diathesis seen with GT. 
Adverse events from post-marketing data 
Of the 24 serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs), 14 were thromboembolic events, 7 were lack of efficacy 
and 3 were allergic reactions. Of the 18 non-serious ADRs, one was a thrombotic event and 17 were lack 
of efficacy. 
Looking at the narratives in the Clinical overview, there were some reports dating from 1999, early 2000’s 
and  a  considerable  number  in  the  last  decade  including  up  to  2017.  These  reports  illustrate  the 
complications  and  adverse  events  which  can  arise  in  the  treatment  of  (serious)  bleeds,  especially 
mucocutaneous bleeds such as epistaxis, vaginal bleeding and gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with 
GT. 
Some reports show the events occurring in patients when bleeding is difficult to treat, requiring additional 
haemostatic treatment but also increasing the risk of thrombotic events while at the same time the bleed 
is not adequately controlled.  
The most striking reports are those of the 6 fatal cases (for 3 of which there is little information available) 
dated between 2003 and 2016, one from the literature and five from spontaneous reporting.  
For  example  Case  261368  concerned  a  46  year  old  woman  undergoing  vaginal  hysterectomy  who 
received concentrated platelets, tranexamic acid and Novoseven pre-operatively. For continued diffuse 
bleeding during the operation and also post-operatively she received Novoseven, concentrated platelets 
and  erythrocyte  transfusions.  Post-operatively  she  developed  disseminated  intravascular  coagulation, 
thrombocytopenia and renal failure and received heparin. Intracerebral bleeding occurred, for which she 
received  Novoseven,  FXIII  and  other  coagulation  factors.  This  patient  died  about  5  weeks  after  the 
hysterectomy. 
It  is  noted  that  in  4  of  the  serious  post-marketing  cases  Novoseven  was  administered  by  continuous 
infusion.  In  all  of  these  there  was  lack  of  efficacy  reported  (this  is  mentioned  in  association  with 
continuous infusion in the treatment of GT in the Novoseven SmPC) and in 2 of these there was also a 
venous thrombosis (one case of DVT and one of pulmonary embolus).

Page 42/57 
 
 
 
 
The fatal cases 3 of which were in patients aged 15 years, 7 years and 13 years, also show that treatment 
of haemorrhage due to GT, in some cases possibly with complications arising from treatment or with poor 
response to treatment may still result in death even in paediatric patients. 
Adverse events in relation to refractoriness to platelet transfusions or antibody status 
GTR 
With regard to safety in the proposed modified indication as reported in the GTR, there were 9 Novoseven 
treated patients who experienced 15 AEs.

Post-marketing data 
For the 53 post-marketing and literature reported cases, there was information on refractoriness and 
antibody status in only 11 cases.  
For these, 3 cases were refractory only, 6 with antibodies (and one “immunised” ) but not refractory and 
in one case the patient was refractory and had antibodies. 
The  small  number  of  adverse  events  reported  in  Novoseven  treated  patients  in  the  GTR  and  the  few 
patients  in  the  literature  reports  with  information  on  refractory/antibody  status,  mean  that  definite 
conclusions on safety for subgroups according to refractoriness or antibody status cannot be drawn. On 
the  other  hand  there  are  no  suggestions  that  the  safety  profile  of  Novoseven  should  differ  in  these 
subgroups.  
However, it is of importance that patients can be treated at least with HLA matched platelets in order to  
prevent refractoriness to platelet transfusion.   
For both  the GTR reports and the post-marketing reports, the adverse events and safety profile according 
to concomitant haemostatic treatment have not been presented. It is not immediately obvious that this 
information may be relevant to the proposed modification of the indication. However, there may be an 
increased risk of thrombosis including disseminated intravascular coagulation in patients not responding 
to  treatment  with  platelet  transfusions  and  requiring  intensive  haemostatic  treatment  to  control 
continuing bleeding (e.g. Case 261368 in which the patient died).  
One of the objectives of the GTR was to focus on the administered dose regimens, and safety (especially 
the occurrence of thromboembolic complications in relation to concomitant use of anti-fibrinolytics). As 
additional post-marketing safety data is available since the 5th interim report from the GTR and as almost 
half the patients treated with Novoseven in the GTR  were <18 years old,  the MAH was asked to present 
and to discuss adverse events, both from post-marketing sources and from the GTR: 
− 
− 
− 
in  relation  to  treatment  with  Novoseven  concomitantly  with  platelet  transfusions  and  other 
haemostatic therapies such as antifibrinolytic agents, 
in relation to the Novoseven dosing regimen (including continuous infusion),  
in  relation  to  whether  the  patient  was  refractory  to  platelet  transfusions  or  had  antibodies  to 
GPIIb/IIIa or HLA and 
−  according to the age groups <12 years, 12 to <18 years and ≥18 years. 
−  The MAH is asked to consider if additions or changes to the safety information in the Novoseven SmPC 
would be appropriate based on this analysis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690988/2018  
Page 43/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH provided a detailed overview of these points which leads to the following conclusions: 
The post-marketing data on the occurrence of TEE in patients treated with Novoseven showed that in a 
high proportion of these cases there was concomitant therapy with antifibrinolytic agents. However, there 
was also a confounding factor involved in 7 of these 8 cases. 
Furthermore, in post-marketing data only cases of adverse events are reported, it is not known how large 
the population of GT patients is in which antifibrinolytic agents are used concomitant to Novoseven. There 
are  thus  no  comparative  data  in  which  to  assess  the  frequency  of  TEE  in  GT  patients  treated  with 
Novoseven with or without concomitant antifibrinolytic agents or other additional haemostatic therapy. 
While it seems plausible that combined use of Novoseven with antifibrinolytic agents in patients with GT 
would increase the risk of TEE, no firm conclusion can be drawn from the available data. 
From the information provided, almost of the reported doses were close to or within the recommended 
dosing range for GT and overall no concerns arise from the reported doses. 
With the small number of subjects and AEs reported in the GTR (15 AEs reported in 9 subjects), it is not 
possible to make any relation between AEs and age or between AEs and status with respect to antibodies 
or refractoriness to platelet transfusions. In any case there was no predominance of an age group in the 
reporting of AEs in the GTR. 
In the post-marketing reports, the majority of patients (18 of 29) were aged >18 years, 2 were aged 2 – 
17 years and 6 aged <12 years. There is thus only limited information on patients aged <18 years and no 
information about the age distribution in the patient population from which these reports originate. 
No relationship was evident between refractoriness to platelet transfusions or presence of antibodies to 
GPIIb/IIIa or HLA. 
Based on the further analysis of the safety data obtained in the GTR and post-marketing, there is no need 
for additions or changes to the current safety information in the SmPC for Glanzmann’s Thrombasthenia 
patients. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
Based on available data, the safety profile in the paediatric population does not appear to be different to 
that in adults. Paediatric patients with GT are also at risk of thromboembolic complications in relation to 
treatment with Novoseven. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Definite  conclusions  on  safety  for  subgroups  according  to  refractoriness  or  antibody  status  cannot  be 
drawn.  However, there are no suggestions that the safety profile of Novoseven should differ in these 
subgroups and no safety issues have been identified which would preclude broadening of the indication in 
GT to: 
“Glanzmann’s  thrombasthenia  with  past  or  present  refractoriness  to  platelet  transfusions  or  where 
platelets are not readily available.” 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

Some of the existing important identified risks (lack of efficacy, allergic reaction) and important potential 
risks (use outside approved indications) were removed from the list of safety concerns as a result of the 
transition to the new RMP template revision 2 in accordance with the new GVP module V. The MAH should 
continue to provide an update of allergic reactions in the PSURs. The MAH should continue to monitor use 
outside of approved indications in the PSURs, including a separate description of adverse events reported 
with use outside of the approved indication.  
Pharmacovigilance plan 
Routine pharmacovigilance is considered sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product. 
The following routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal 
detection are in place:  
• 
• 
Immunogenicity questionnaire 
Embolic and thrombotic events questionnaire 
•  Antibody testing is offered. 
Routine pharmacovigilance remains sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation 
measures.  
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do 
not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This extension of indication is for the treatment of patients with Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia with past or 
present refractoriness to platelet transfusions, or where platelets are not readily available. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
As the bleeding tendency and severity varies in patients with GT, the treatment demands vary 
considerably. Mild and moderate bleeding episodes often can be controlled by conservative methods such 
as local compression, local haemostatic agents (fibrin glue) and antifibrinolytic drugs. However, when 
such treatment fails, the treatment approach is transfusion of platelets.  
Platelet transfusion is the standard therapy to control severe bleeding episodes and to prepare patients 
for surgical interventions.  However, the use of platelet therapy may also be limited by a short platelet 
shelf-life (5-7 days) and potentially low availability in some hospitals or blood banks, especially if 
leuco-depleted platelets or leuco-reduced platelets from single donor (if possible HLA compatible) are 
requested to prevent transfusion reactions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690988/2018  
Page 49/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In GT, refractoriness to platelet transfusion can be considered when platelet transfusions are clinically 
ineffective in achieving haemostasis. Immune causes of refractoriness include alloimmunisation to 
human leucocyte antigen (HLA) and/or human platelet antigen (HPA) due e.g. most often to prior 
exposure from transfusion, pregnancy or transplantation. 
The only potentially curative treatment for GT is bone marrow transplantation, and this is only indicated 
if the bleeds are severe and when the patient is refractory to platelet transfusions 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Efficacy and safety data to support the extension of the indication in Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia (GT) 
have come from the post-marketing study F7HAEM-3521 (F7GLANZ), also referred to as the Glanzmann’s 
Thrombasthenia Registry (GTR).  
There were 218 patients in the registry: 87 (40%) were children (age <12 years), 19 (9%) were 
adolescents (age 12 to ≤18 years) and 110 (50%) were adults (>18 years). In the registry, 133 patients 
received treatment which included Novoseven with similar proportions of patients per above mentioned 
age category (31%, 12% and 56% respectively). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The  218  patients  in  the  registry  had  1073  admissions  for  bleeding  episodes  and/or  invasive 
procedures/surgeries).  
The total number of patients in the GTR treated with Novoseven for any admission (bleed or surgery) was 
as follows:  
133 patients with 492 admissions (94 patients with 333 bleeding episode admissions and 77 patients with 
159  surgery  admissions)  received  Novoseven  either  alone  (n=62  patients)  or  in  combination  with 
platelets and/or other haemostatic treatments. 
In  admissions  in  which  treatment  with  Novoseven  was  given,  efficacy  was  rated  as  effective  in  79% 
(262/333) of all bleeding admissions and in 88% (140/159) of all surgical admissions. 
In the admissions for bleeding events which were treated only with Novoseven (n=155) or with N7OH 
(n=110)  (thus  without  platelets),  the  rate  of  effective  treatment  was  approximately  80%.  In  the 
admissions for surgery which were treated only with Novoseven (n=62) or with N7OH (n=71), the rate of 
effective treatment was approximately 90%. 
Refractory patients 
The numbers of patients refractory to platelet transfusions (n=31) according to antibody categories and 
NovoSeven treatment with rating of haemostatic efficacy were: 
Refract POS / AB POS (current indication):   22 patients with 76 admissions. 
Efficacy was rated as effective in 72% (26/36) of admissions for bleeds and 95% (38/40) for surgery. 
14 patients in 31 admissions were treated only with Novoseven. 
Refract POS / AB NEG (covered by proposed modified (indication):   8 patients with 43 admissions.  
Efficacy was rated as effective in 74% (23/31) of admissions for bleeds and 67% (8/12 with rest partially 
effective) for surgery. 
4 patients in 12 admissions were treated only with Novoseven. 
Refract POS / AB unknown:  1 patient with 7 admissions  
Efficacy was rated as effective in all 6 admissions for bleeds and the single admission for surgery. 
4 admissions were treated only with Novoseven. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690988/2018  
Page 50/57 
 
 
 
 
 
Non-refractory patients 
The numbers of patients not refractory to platelet transfusions (n=63) according to antibody categories 
and NovoSeven treatment with rating of haemostatic efficacy were: 
Refract NEG / AB POS:     21 patients with 72 admissions (covered by proposed modified indication). 
Efficacy was rated as effective in 64% (30/47) of admissions for bleeds and 84% (21/25)for surgery. 
6 patients in 12 admissions were treated only with Novoseven. 
Refract NEG / AB NEG:      37 patients with 196 admissions (covered by proposed modified indication). 
Efficacy was rated as effective in 85% (135/159) of admissions for bleeds and 95% (35/37) for surgery. 
18 patients in 125 admissions were treated only with Novoseven. 
Refract NEG / AB unknown:  5 patients with 10 admissions. 
Efficacy was rated as effective in 56% (5/9) of admissions for bleeds and the single admission for surgery. 
One patient in one admission was treated only with Novoseven. 
Overall, the haemostatic efficacy of treatments for bleeding events in which Novoseven was used was 
rated  as  effective  in  75%  of  admissions  in  patients  refractory  to  platelet  transfusions  and  79%  of 
admissions in patients not known to be refractory.  
Similarly, for surgical admissions in which Novoseven formed part of the treatment, haemostatic efficacy 
was rated as effective 89% in admissions in in patients refractory to platelet transfusions and 90% of 
admissions in patients not known to be refractory. 
Severe bleeds / major surgery 
Efficacy in bleeding events treated with Novoseven, was rated as effective in approximately 80% of the 
265 admissions for bleeds of moderate severity (ineffective in 3 admissions) and approximately 60% to 
70% of the 68 admissions for severe bleeds (ineffective in 1 admission).  
Efficacy in surgeries treated with Novoseven, was rated as effective in approximately 90% of the 133 
admissions  for  minor  surgeries  (ineffective  in  2  admissions)  and  in  approximately  70%  of  the  19 
admissions for major surgeries (ineffective in 1 admission).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are limitations due to the observational nature of the registry data; for example, the reason for a 
patient to be given a particular therapy is according to physician’s choice and open to bias. Within the 
GTR, meaningful comparisons between treatments are hardly possible as there are no pre-defined 
comparable subgroups.  
Novoseven could be used alone and/or in combination with platelet transfusions and/or other haemostatic 
therapies such as antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid) resulting in many patient subgroups some of 
which are very small. The treatment groups/sequences defined by the MAH for the evaluation of efficacy 
make it difficult to evaluate the efficacy of Novoseven alone or in combination with other treatments. In 
particular, it is not possible to compare efficacy rates across the different treatment groups treated with 
Novoseven (alone, with OH and/or platelets) and with the groups treated without Novoseven. 
Information on both refractory and antibody status was present for only 88 patients. A minority of 
patients (31/133 (23.3%)) were known to be refractory to platelet transfusions. 
Only 22/133 patients (16.5%) who received Novoseven in the GTR in any treatment combination were 
Refract POS / AB POS thus few patients were known to have been treated exactly according to the 
approved indication for Novoseven in GT. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690988/2018  
Page 51/57 
 
 
 
 
 
Only 8/133 patients (6%) who received Novoseven in the GTR in any treatment combination were Refract 
POS / AB NEG corresponding to that part of the proposed modified indication “refractory to platelet 
transfusions without antibodies to platelets”. 
Despite the above mentioned concerns, it can be concluded that there is a high rate of haemostatic 
efficacy with Novoseven with treatment in 64% up to 80% rated as effective for bleeding admissions and 
67% up to 95% rated as effective in surgical admissions. In addition, there was no apparent difference in 
the ratings of haemostatic efficacy in the different subgroups according to treatment combinations (with 
platelets and/or other haemostatic therapy) or according to refractoriness to platelet transfusions or 
antibody status. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the GTR, in patients treated with Novoseven, 15 adverse events 7 serious and 8 non-serious, were 
reported in 9 patients. Post-marketing, 53 cases, comprising 77 adverse drug reactions (43 serious and 
34 non-serious; have been reported cumulatively up to December 2017 from post-marketing sources 
within the indication of GT. 
There  was  one  serious  arterial  thromboembolic  event  of  ’Ischaemic  stroke’;  9  serious  venous 
thromboembolic events; 4 serious and one non-serious mixed thromboembolic events; 7 serious and 17 
non-serious cases of lack of efficacy and 3 reports of serious allergic reactions. 
Six of the post-marketing case reports had a fatal outcome. Three of these cases concerned patients with 
severe  haemorrhage,  and  2  concerned  thromboembolic  adverse  drug  reactions;  no  information  is 
available on the sixth case. 
The risk of thrombotic events as well as the risk of allergic or anaphylactic-type reactions was already 
covered in Section 4.4. of the SmPC.   
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
As the GTR provides only observational data there is possible underreporting of adverse events. 
Adverse events were reported in 9 patients in the GTR with only 2 or 3 patients per subgroup of 
refractoriness / antibody status. For the post-marketing reports, information about whether the patients 
were refractory to platelet transfusions or had antibodies to HLA or to GP IIb - IIIa is available for only 11 
of the 53 cases. Of these 11 cases, 3 cases were refractory only, 6 with antibodies (and one “immunised”) 
but not refractory and in one case the patient was refractory and had antibodies. 
The post-marketing data on the occurrence of TEE in patients treated with Novoseven show that in a high 
proportion of these cases there was concomitant therapy with antifibrinolytic agents. However, there was 
also a confounding factor involved in 7 of these 8 cases. 
Furthermore, in post-marketing data only cases of adverse events are reported, it is not known how large 
the population of GT patients is in which antifibrinolytic agents are used concomitant to Novoseven. There 
are thus no comparative data in which to assess the frequency of TEE in GT patients treated with 
Novoseven with or without concomitant antifibrinolytic agents or other additional haemostatic therapy. 
While it seems plausible that combined use of Novoseven with antifibrinolytic agents in patients with GT 
would increase the risk of TEE, no firm conclusion can be drawn from the available data. 
However, based on the further analysis of the safety data obtained in the GTR and post-marketing there 
is no need for additions or changes to the current safety information in the SmPC for Glanzmann’s 
Thrombasthenia patients.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Impaired platelet adhesion and aggregation due to reduced or absent GP IIb – IIIa, as in Glanzmann’s 
thrombasthenia  results  in  inadequate  primary  haemostasis  which  leads  in  particular  to  mucotaneous 
bleeding. Recommended treatment for patients with GT experiencing more serious bleeds or undergoing 
surgery is with platelet transfusions in order to provide functioning platelets to promote establishment of 
a haemostatic plug. Anti-fibrinolytics and local haemostatic products (e.g. fibrin sealants) are also used. 
These measures may not be sufficient in patients refractory to platelet transfusions (which may be due to 
antibodies to GPIIb-IIIa or to HLA) and in such cases the haemostatic effect achieved with rFVIIa can be 
of major importance. 
In the GTR, haemostatic efficacy was rated as effective during bleeding episodes if bleeding stopped or 
haemostasis  was  achieved  for  6  hours  or  more  and  for  surgery,  “effective”  was  defined  as  achieving 
normal haemostasis, both clinically relevant assessments of efficacy. The combined rates of haemostatic 
efficacy of treatments which included Novoseven, in patients refractory to platelet transfusions, in whom 
adequate haemostasis may not be possible, were approximately 75% of bleeding admissions and 89% of 
surgical admissions. Similar high rates of haemostatic efficacy were also seen in patients not refractory to 
platelet transfusions: 79% of bleeding admissions and 90% of surgical admissions. 
In  admissions  for  bleeding  and  for  surgery  (refractory  and  non-refractory  patients  not  evaluated 
separately), treatment which included Novoseven but not platelets was rated as effective in 80% and 
90%  of  the  admissions  respectively.  There  is  thus  a  high  likelihood  of  Novoseven  promoting  and 
contributing to effective haemostasis in patients who are refractory and/or in patients for whom platelets 
are not readily available. In situations where bleeding is difficult to control, and platelet transfusion is 
necessary, this may allow some extra time to obtain the platelets. 
Few adverse events in Novoseven treated patients were reported in the GTR during the 4.5 years over 
which  data  was  collected.  Most  of  the  reports  of  adverse  events  in  GT  patients  from  literature  and 
post-marketing sources dated from 2003 up to 2017. In that perspective, 53 cases is not a high number 
but some of the cases with serious ADRs are striking. In the post-marketing data including serious ADRs 
from the GTR, there were 14 serious ADRs of thrombotic events in 10 cases which had fatal outcomes in 
2  patients,  showing  that  life  threatening  thrombotic  events  can  co-exist  with  continued  bleeding  in 
patients with GT receiving multiple therapies. The risks of thrombosis associated with use of rFVIIa in 
various  settings  (including  off-label  use)  is  well  known  and  is  an  important  factor  to  be  taken  into 
consideration in the benefit / risk of treatment with Novoseven in the individual patient. Warning and 
precautions are reflected accordingly in section 4.4. of the SmPC. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Platelet  transfusion  is  the  treatment  of  choice  for  serious  bleeds  in  patients  with  Glanzmann’s 
thrombasthenia and this is also stated in the Novoseven SmPC Section 4.2 directly after the GT posology 
recommendation. However, in patients who are refractory to platelet transfusions, their use will be less 
effective  or  ineffective.  Matched  single  donor  platelet  transfusions  may  be  necessary  in  patients 
refractory due to antibodies against GPIIb-IIa or to hHLA but are not immediately available for use in 
acute situations. It is generally recommended that use of platelet transfusions in patients with GT should 
be reserved for serious bleeding in order to prevent immunisation which would reduce efficacy in future 
bleeds. A restrictive approach is also recommended in girls and in women of childbearing age in order to 
prevent immunisation and formation of anti-platelet antibodies which might result in foetal or neonatal 
thrombocytopenia. Based on the above considerations, an option for an alternative treatment for any 
Assessment report

patient with GT i.e. who is refractory to platelet transfusion and for any GT patient for whom a platelet 
transfusion is not available is of value in this disorder which can cause severe bleeding which is difficult to 
control. 
The  haemostatic  effectiveness  achieved  with  treatments  using  Novoseven  and  rates  at  which  it  was 
similarly observed in both refractory and in non-refractory patients (about half the patients in the GTR), 
and in patients with antibodies or patients without antibodies to GPIIb-IIIa or HLA (also about half the 
patients in the GTR), support the currently approved indication for Novoseven in GT and also support the 
proposed extension of the indication to non-refractory patients and to patients without antibodies. 
The  most  important  ADRs  reported  with  rFVIIa  used  in  the  treatment  of  GT  are  venous  and  arterial 
thrombotic events and disseminated intravascular coagulation which are potentially very serious or even 
fatal. In the Novoseven SmPC, venous thromboembolic events are listed as uncommon and both arterial 
thromboembolic events and disseminated intravascular coagulation are listed with a frequency of rare. 
The information on adverse events from the 133 patients treated with Novoseven in the GTR does not 
suggest a different ADR profile or frequencies than currently reflected in the SmPC. There was no sign of 
a trend towards different rates of adverse events in refractory or non-refractory patients or in patients 
with or without antibodies but numbers of AEs are too low to draw definite conclusions on this.  
There  was  similar,  clinically  relevant,  haemostatic  efficacy  in  patients  refractory  or  not  refractory  to 
platelet transfusions and in patients with or without antibodies to GPIIb-IIIa or HLA. No safety issues have 
been  identified  which  would  preclude  extending  the  indication  for  treatment  with  Novoseven  in  GT 
patients not refractory to platelet transfusions or without antibodies. 
There is also a medical need to avoid, if possible, exposure to platelet transfusions in order to prevent 
immunisation to platelets.  
Based on these considerations it is considered justified that the indication is not restricted to Glanzmann’s 
thrombasthenia  patients  with  antibodies  to  GP  IIb  -  IIIa  and/or  HLA,  and  with  past  or  present 
refractoriness to platelet transfusions and reworded as: 
Glanzmann’s  thrombasthenia  with  past  or  present  refractoriness  to  platelet  transfusions  or  where 
platelets are not readily available. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Novoseven is positive.

Extension of Indication to include patients with Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia with past or present 
refractoriness to platelet transfusions, or where platelets are not readily available, based on a prospective 
observational registry and literature references. As a consequence, sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC are 
updated. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make 
minor editorial changes in section 4.8 of the SmPC and in Package Leaflet. The updated RMP version 7.1 
has been agreed within this procedure. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. 
5.  EPAR changes

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for hydrochlorothiazide / irbesartan, 
the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In the approved EU SmPC for irbesartan + hydrochlorothiazide products the risk of thrombocytopenia is 
included as an adverse drug reaction (ADR) reported with the use of hydrochlorothiazide alone; however, 
in the PRAC Recommendation issued at the conclusion of the latest irbesartan PSUSA procedure 
(EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/001782/201508) the ADR of thrombocytopenia was identified and included in the EU 
SmPC for irbesartan single ingredient. To be consistent with this PRAC recommendation the MAH should 
include thrombocytopenia also in the table of adverse reactions reported with the use of irbesartan alone 
in the product information of irbesartan + hydrochlorothiazide combination products. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for hydrochlorothiazide / irbesartan the CHMP is of the opinion 
that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing hydrochlorothiazide / irbesartan is 
unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

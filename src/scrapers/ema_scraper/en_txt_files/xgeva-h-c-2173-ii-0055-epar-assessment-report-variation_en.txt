2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Multiple myeloma is a bone marrow malignancy of clonal plasma cells, which produce a specific 
monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig; paraprotein or M protein). Clinically, multiple myeloma is characterized 
by osteolytic bone destruction, hypercalcemia, renal failure, anaemia, potential light chain deposition, and 
reduction in normal gamma globulins, which results in increased risk of infections. 
Currently, intravenous (IV) bisphosphonates, specifically pamidronate and zoledronic acid, are used for 
the prevention of SREs in patients with multiple myeloma. Dose reduction may be required in renal 
impairment and bisphosphonate use is generally not recommended or is contraindicated in cases of 
severe renal dysfunction. 
Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG2 antibody to RANKL that binds with high affinity and 
specificity to both the soluble and transmembrane forms of human RANKL (Kostenuik et al, 2009). This 
binding of denosumab to RANKL prevents RANK activation and inhibits the formation, activation, and 
survival of osteoclasts; denosumab thus may offer an alternative to bisphosphonates for the prevention 
of SREs in patients with multiple myeloma. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data has been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody. It is a sequence of amino acids and a protein and in 
accordance with the CHMP guideline on environmental risk assessment (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) is 
exempt from testing. There is no concern for any environmental risk.  
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data has been submitted to support the present application. This is acceptable.  
A minor editorial change has been implemented in section 4.6 of the SmPC. This is acceptable. There are 
no changes to section 5.3. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Considering the above data, denosumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
There is no objection to an approval of this variation from a non-clinical point of view.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Key pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of denosumab were evaluated in a dedicated 
phase 3 study (Study 20090482). 
In Study 20090482, blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected predose on study day 1, 
then predose at weeks 5, 9, 13, 25, 49, and the end of treatment phase visit.  A validated, conventional 
sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantify serum denosumab concentrations. 
A total of 1718 subjects were enrolled and randomized into 1 of the 2 treatment groups (Full Analysis 
Set), 1702 subjects (99.1%) received investigational product (Safety Analysis Set), and 185 subjects 
were included in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set.  A total of 1183 subjects were still on study as of the 
primary analysis cut-off date (19 July 2016). 
The study population consisted of 54.4% men and 45.6% women with a mean (SD) age of 63.4 (10.6) 
years and a range of 29 to 91 years; 45.5% of subjects were ≥ 65 years old, including 15.9% who were 
≥ 75 years old. The majority of subjects were white (82.1%), followed by Asian (12.1%), black (3.8%), 
and other (1.7%). 
After multiple dose administrations of denosumab 120 mg Q4W to subjects with newly diagnosed multiple 
myeloma, mean (SD) serum denosumab trough concentration were 7760 (3 160) ng/mL at month 1, 12 
900 (5 730) ng/mL at month 2, 18 100 (8 180) ng/mL at month 3, 24 000 (11 900) ng/mL at month 6, 
and 24 000 (12 600) ng/mL at month 12  and appeared to reach steady state by month 6.  Exposures, 
based on denosumab trough concentrations, were comparable at month 6 and month 12, indicating that 
the pharmacokinetics of denosumab did not change with time after month 6 (see figure below).

Myeloma After Subcutaneous Administration of Denosumab 120 mg Q4W 
Anti-denosumab antibodies 
Samples were collected throughout Study 20090482 to assess the development of anti denosumab 
antibodies, and the impact of any antibody development on the safety, pharmacokinetics, and 
pharmacodynamics of denosumab was characterized, when data allowed. 
In Study 20090482 1 subject tested positive for antidenosumab antibodies at baseline and 1 subject 
tested positive for developing antidenosumab antibodies. Both samples tested negative for neutralizing 
activity. No neutralizing antibodies have been reported in any denosumab clinical study to date. Of the 62 
denosumab-treated subjects within the pharmacokinetics subset, all subjects tested negative for binding 
antibodies. Consequently, the impact of antidenosumab antibodies on denosumab exposure could not be 
assessed. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
In Study 20090482, urine samples for the determination of urine N-telopeptide (uNTX) concentrations 
corrected for creatinine clearance (uNTX/Cr) were collected predose on study day 1, then at weeks 5, 9, 
13, 25, 49, and the end of the treatment phase visit. 
After the first dose of investigational product, at week 5, decreases in concentrations of the bone 
resorption marker uNTX/Cr were observed in both treatment groups with a median percent change from 
baseline of  75.0% and -69.6% for the denosumab and zoledronic acid groups, respectively.  At weeks 9, 
13, and 25 uNTX/Cr concentrations remained below baseline with median percent changes from baseline 
ranging from -67.9 to -78.1 in both treatment groups.  At week 49, the median percent change from 
baseline in uNTX/Cr concentrations was -78.9% in the denosumab group and -79.5% in the zoledronic 
acid group. 
After the first dose of investigational product, at week 5, increases in concentrations of the bone 
formation marker BSAP were observed in both treatment groups with a median percent change from 
baseline of 11.4% and 2.5% for the denosumab and zoledronic acid groups, respectively.  At weeks 9, 
13, and 25 BSAP concentrations decreased with median percent changes from baseline ranging from -

14.0 to -43.8 in both treatment groups.  At week 49, BSAP concentrations were further reduced from 
baseline in both treatment groups with a median percent change from baseline of -54.9% and -41.5% for 
the denosumab and zoledronic acid groups, respectively. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out with the objectives: 
• 
• 
to quantitatively characterize denosumab pharmacokinetics after intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) 
administration and to quantify its inter-individual variability 
to evaluate effects of subjects' demographic characteristics and other covariates on the pharmacokinetic 
parameters of denosumab  
Data from 16 clinical studies, including 8 phase 1 studies (20010123, 20010124, 20030148, 20030164, 
20040176, 20050227, 20060286 and 20060446) in healthy subjects or subjects with advanced cancer; 4 
phase 2 studies (20040113, 20040114, 20040215 and 20050134) in subjects with breast cancer, other 
solid tumors, giant cell tumor of the bone, or multiple myeloma; and 4 phase 3 studies (20050103, 
20050136, 20050244 and 20090482) in subjects with breast cancer, prostate cancer, other solid tumors, 
and multiple myeloma were used in the denosumab population pharmacokinetic analysis. In these 16 
studies, denosumab was administered as a single IV dose (N = 36) or as single or multiple SC doses (N = 
1228) ranging from 0.1 to 3.0 mg/kg (weight-based) or 6 to 210 mg (fixed) administered Q4W, once 
every 3 months or once every 6 months for up to 48 months. The analysis dataset consisted of 15574 
serum denosumab concentrations from 1264 subjects, including 495 healthy subjects and 769 subjects 
with cancer. A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted using a nonlinear mixed-effects 
modeling approach and software (NONMEM v 7.2). 
The denosumab PK was described using a 2-compartment pharmacokinetic model with linear distribution 
to the peripheral compartment and parallel linear and nonlinear elimination. The nonlinear elimination 
was described by the capacity-limited binding of free denosumab to free receptor activator of nuclear 
factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) using the quasi-steady-state approximation of the target-mediated drug 
disposition model. External validation with VPC confirmed that the previously developed denosumab 
population pharmacokinetic model for healthy subjects, and subjects with bone metastases from solid 
tumors adequately described denosumab pharmacokinetics in MM subjects from study 20090482. The 
final model using the combined dataset was the same as the published model with the addition of an MM 
specific factor for linear clearance, similar to the cancer specific factors estimated on linear clearance for 
other cancer types. Population PK parameters are provided in the table below. 
Linear clearance was 1.46-fold faster in multiple myeloma subjects compared to healthy volunteers and 
similar to the linear clearance for other cancer types. Denosumab is likely eliminated through a 
nonspecific (linear) pathway and a target-mediated (nonlinear) pathway specifically mediated by free 
RANKL. Linear clearance was estimated to be 3.22 mL/hr for a typical 66 kg subject. The nonlinear 
elimination (mediated by RANKL binding) was dominant at very low serum denosumab concentrations of 
≤ 22.1 ng/mL (1/10th of Kss). As free denosumab concentrations increased to > 22.1 ng/mL, the 
nonlinearity in denosumab pharmacokinetics become more apparent, and nonlinear elimination reached 
half capacity at a concentration of 221 ng/mL (Kss). The saturation of the target-mediated elimination 
pathway is > 90% during the time that the denosumab serum concentration is > 2210 ng/mL (10x Kss). 
At doses of ≥ 60 mg (or ≥ 1 mg/kg), denosumab pharmacokinetics are essentially linear with dose, since 
the target-mediated pathway is almost fully saturated and denosumab disposition is mainly driven by the 
linear elimination (nonsaturable) clearance. Following 120 mg Q4W dosing, the estimated target (RANKL) 
occupancy at steady state exceeded 98% for a typical multiple myeloma subject during the entire dose

interval. Even in subjects with high body weight and high clearance, the model-predicted target 
occupancy at steady state exceeds 97.5% in a large (> 95%) proportion of subjects.

such as linear elimination clearance and volume of distribution, and was identified as the covariate with 
the largest effect on denosumab pharmacokinetics. Steady-state exposures following repeat 
subcutaneous administration of 120 mg every 4 weeks to 45 kg and 120 kg subjects were 48% higher 
and 46% lower than exposure of the typical 66 kg subject. However, based on model-predicted 
exposures and given the high affinity of denosumab for RANKL, a fixed dose of 120 mg will provide 
comparable decreases in free RANKL from baseline across a wide range of body weights, where the 
estimated RANKL inhibition at steady state for 45 kg and 120 kg subjects were only 0.27% higher and 
0.71% lower, respectively, than the RANKL inhibition at steady state for the typical 66 kg subject. In 
addition, the differences in target inhibition are small in relation to the overall between subject variability 
in denosumab pharmacokinetics. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Denosumab PK was evaluated in a study of patients with multiple myeloma. Further, these study data 
were analysed together with denosumab PK data from other indications in using population 
pharmacokinetic modeling. It was shown that the exposure to denosumab was similar in MM patients 
compared to other indications. Further, the inhibition of RANKL at the therapeutic dose was modeled and 
shown to be high, approximately 98%. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of denosumab was studied in patients with multiple myeloma. The exposure is in 
line with the exposure seen in other denosumab indications. There was no observation of neutralizing 
antibodies to denosumab in patients with multiple myeloma. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The application is based on a single pivotal study supported by three previously assessed clinical trials in 
other malignancies for which MAA has been already approved (Table 1).

Randomisation was to be stratified according to intent to undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell 
(PBSC) transplantation (yes, no), first-line therapy (novel therapy, non-novel therapy), stage at diagnosis 
(ISS I, II, III), previous SRE (yes, no), and region (Japan yes, no). 
All subjects were to receive first-line antimyeloma treatment as standard of care, with subsequent 
myeloma treatments in the event of disease progression allowed at the discretion of the investigator. 
Radiation or surgery to the bone that was currently indicated at the time of consideration for enrolment 
must have been completed before randomisation. 
All subjects were recommended to receive vitamin D and calcium supplementation unless documented 
hypercalcaemia developed on study; calcium and vitamin D was administered as necessary to treat or 
prevent hypocalcaemia. 
The duration of the treatment was event driven; participants were to receive blinded denosumab or 
zoledronic acid Q4W treatment until an estimated 676 subjects experienced at least 1 on-study SRE and 
the primary efficacy and safety analysis was completed. The estimated duration on the primary blinded 
treatment phase for an individual subject was approximately 50 months. If in the primary analysis 
denosumab was determined to have a positive benefit-risk profile compared with zoledronic acid in this 
study, all subjects currently undergoing Q4W scheduled assessments were to be offered open-label 
denosumab at a dose of 120 mg SC for up to 2 years; if the benefit-risk profile was not considered 
positive, all subjects were to be followed for survival for 2 years after the last dose of blinded 
investigational product. A data monitoring committee (DMC) was to review safety and efficacy data at 
regular intervals at least 2 times per year. Since in trial 20090482 denosumab was determined to have a 
positive benefit-risk profile compared with zoledronic acid, all subjects who were undergoing scheduled 
assessments were offered open-label denosumab at a dose of 120 mg SC Q4W for up to 2 years; this 
part of the study is ongoing.

Treatments 
Participants received either:  
denosumab 120 mg SC Q4W and placebo for zoledronic acid IV Q4W  
or  
placebo for denosumab SC Q4W and zoledronic acid 4 mg IV Q4W.  
The IV solution was to be administered as a single IV infusion over a minimum of 15 minutes. 
All subjects were recommended to receive daily supplements of ≥500 mg elemental calcium and ≥400 IU 
vitamin D. 
Investigators were permitted to prescribe chemotherapy for multiple myeloma and any other concomitant 
medication or treatment except bisphosphonates other than zoledronic acid (bisphosphonates were 
permitted for treatment of hypercalcaemia of malignancy) and unapproved investigational products or 
devices. All concomitant medications were to be recorded. 
Denosumab was supplied in blinded-label, single-use glass vials and the placebo in matched containers; 
the placebo formulation was identical to denosumab with the exception of the protein content. 
Zoledronic acid and its placebo were supplied as sterile liquid concentrate solutions for IV infusion. 
Zoledronic acid was sourced from commercially available EU-branded (Zometa) material. Declarations 
obtained from the manufacturer (Novartis) confirmed that the formulation and site of manufacturing was 
identical for US- and EU-sourced Zometa. Additionally, analytical testing comparing EU- and US-sourced 
zoledronic acid indicated that all lots were equivalent as regards appearance, pH, assay, and related 
substance.  
Manufacturing batch numbers for denosumab and zoledronic acid have been provided. 
The active comparator zoledronic acid IV Q4W is considered acceptable.

Statistical methods 
Hypotheses: 
Denosumab will be non-inferior to intravenous (IV) zoledronic acid on time to first on-study SRE in 
subjects with multiple myeloma. It is anticipated that the true hazard ratio of denosumab compared with 
zoledronic acid is 0.95. 
Non-inferiority margin: 
In the non-inferiority design, historical data from the literature were used to estimate the hazard ratio of 
placebo relative to the active control, zoledronic acid. 
Table 2. Relevant Historical Trials 
Within each tumour type, calculation of the combined estimate of zoledronic acid’s effect relative to 
placebo was based on a three-step approach, if applicable. 1) Data from the trials comparing 
pamidronate with placebo were combined in order to estimate the hazard ratio for placebo relative to 
pamidronate. 2) The results of step 1 were combined with the results of the trials comparing zoledronic 
acid with pamidronate in order to estimate the hazard ratio for placebo relative to zoledronic acid. 3) The 
results of step 2 were combined with the results of the trials comparing zoledronic acid with placebo to 
obtain an overall estimate of the hazard ratio of placebo relative to zoledronic acid within each tumour 
type. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/333703/2018 
Page 17/69 
 
  
  
 
 
As there is limited historical data in multiple myeloma subjects, the estimate of zoledronic acid’s effect 
relative to placebo used in the non-inferiority design was calculated based on the random-effects meta-
analysis pooled across all tumour types. 
Table 3. Estimate of Zoledronic Acid’s Effect Relative to Placebo 
The statistical methods for non-inferiority analysis was based on the following two-stage approach:  
1) The fixed margin approach will be used to ensure denosumab has an effect greater than placebo (i.e., 
the non-inferiority margin M1, i.e., the lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval 1.28, is 
ruled out). 2) The synthesis approach will be used to ensure preservation of at least 50% of the 
zoledronic acid effect.   
The statistical inferences of the treatment effect on secondary efficacy endpoints (time to the first on 
study SRE [superiority] and time to first and subsequent on study SRE [superiority, multiple event 
analysis]) will be carried out if denosumab is declared non-inferior to zoledronic acid. To control the 
overall type I error for multiple comparisons at a significant level of 0.05, these secondary efficacy 
endpoints will be tested simultaneously using Hochberg procedure.  
If superiority of denosumab over zoledronic acid is established for both time to first SRE and time to first 
and subsequent SRE, the additional secondary endpoint (overall survival) will be tested at a significance 
level of 0.05. Because interim DMC looks have occurred before the primary analysis, the final critical p-
value (boundary) for testing OS will be calculated based on the alpha spending function specified in the 
DMC charter and the actual number of deaths observed in the primary analysis (Proschan et al, 2006). 
The significance level for each exploratory efficacy endpoint will be 0.05 without adjusting for multiplicity. 
All statistical testing will be 2-sided. Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates of the survival function for time to first 
on-study SRE for each treatment group, and hazard ratio (with CI) based on a Cox proportional hazards 
model stratified by randomization stratification factors will be used for analysis of the primary endpoint.  
Sensitivity analyses will be performed  by repeating the primary method using the per-protocol set, the 
primary method using FAS and the actual stratum, the primary method by censoring subjects without 
SRE at the date of their last on-study skeletal survey, the primary method by using the inverse 
probability of censoring weighted (IPCW) Cox proportional hazards model stratified by randomization 
stratification factors.  
The principal analysis for the primary and secondary endpoints (time to first on-study SRE and time to 
first-and-subsequent on-study SRE) will employ the FAS approach and per-protocol approach will be 
considered supportive. The analysis for the additional secondary endpoint (OS) will employ the FAS 
approach. 
Interim analyses, conducted for DMC reviews were planned every 6th months for this study. The study 
was not to be stopped early simply based on overwhelming evidence of noninferiority. For superiority, the 
study was not to be stopped unless the primary endpoint achieved a p < 0.0005. Due to the conservative 
nature of this rule, no adjustment was made to the final significance level of this study. 
The analysis based on the per protocol analysis set is considered equally important as the FAS analysis. 
The non-inferiority margin and analysis were planned and performed according to the FDA Guidance for 
industry on Non-inferiority Clinical Trials to Establish Effectiveness. Hence no discussion about clinical 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/333703/2018

relevant preservation in absolute values has been provided. When the study has been performed and the 
results are available it is not relevant to set such a NI margin. However the results need to be discussed 
in terms of preserved effect, see the results section. 
The non-inferiority design with the margin based on historical data assumes constancy from study to 
study, i.e. that the estimate of the historical active-control effect is applicable in the current study. The 
constancy assumption, in terms of the zoledronic acid effect on time to first SRE, was evaluated based on 
the historical data used in deriving the hazard ratio and the observed data from this study, that is, the 
design features were comparable between this study and the historical Novartis Studies. That is, 
population comparability: baseline characteristics were compared between historical data and the data 
from this study. 
Anti-myeloma therapy has undergone major improvement over the last decade and the constancy 
assumption postulates that there is no interaction between myeloma therapy and the activity of 
bisphosphonates, specifically zoledronic acid. This assumption was questioned by CHMP, please refer to 
the section Discussion of Efficacy. 
Sample size 
To achieve 85% power to rule out the non-inferiority margin M1 (1.28) at a 1-sided 2.5% significance 
level, approximately 404 first on-study SREs are required based on the fixed margin approach. This 
calculation assumes a true hazard ratio (denosumab versus zoledronic acid) of 0.95. 
To achieve 85% power to demonstrate that denosumab preserves at least 50% of the effect of zoledronic 
acid at a 1-sided 2.5% significance level, approximately 676 first on-study SREs are required based on 
the synthesis approach (Hung et al, 2003). This calculation assumes a true hazard ratio (denosumab 
versus zoledronic acid) of 0.95. As observed in XGEVA Study 20050244 and Myeloma IX (Morgan et al, 
2011), the risk of first on-study SRE was relatively high in the first 6 months, and decreased and became 
stabilized afterwards. Assume a piece-wise exponential distribution for the time to first SRE in the 
zoledronic acid group with an risk of about 7.2% and 1% per month for the first 6 months and afterwards 
respectively in this study, resulting in a median time to first SRE of approximately 32 months. Assuming 
45 months enrolment, the sum of a lost to follow-up rate and a death rate of 25% per year, a total of 
1700 subjects are needed to achieve the target number of events within a 50-month study duration. 
Assuming the median OS is 50 months (San-Miguel et al, 2008, San-Miguel et al, 2009) for the zoledronic 
acid group in this trial, and a lost to follow-up rate of 5% per year, the 95% CIs of the hazard ratios 
(denosumab versus zoledronic acid) are calculated (Table 4). If a hazard ratio of 1.0 was observed, then 
the upper bound of the 95% CIs is 1.19 for OS, which allows the exclusion of a detrimental effect for 
denosumab compared with zoledronic acid above this level.

Amgen will monitor the rate of first on-study SRE pooled by treatment group; if it is lower than expected, 
Amgen and Daiichi Sankyo may choose to modify the sample size.

There was no clinical justification of the chosen non-inferiority limit provided, instead the approach has 
been chosen were 50% of the effect of zoledronic acid should be preserved. However it should be noted 
that the limit of 1.28 only ensures an effect of denosumab compared to a putative placebo as estimated 
from historical data .  
The sample size was increased by 180 subjects and the power decreased to 85% in the 3rd amendment 
during the study. This was due to a lower event rate than anticipated. It is not considered to have a 
major impact on the validity of the study. Of note, the relevance of the assumptions underlying these 
calculations was challenged by the CHMP due to major improvement of myeloma therapy.  
Randomisation 
Subjects will be randomized by the IVRS in a 1:1 ratio to denosumab or zoledronic acid.  
Randomization will be stratified based on the following criteria at the time of study entry: 
intent to undergo autologous PBSC transplantation: yes or no 
the anti-myeloma agent being utilized/planned to be utilized in first-line therapy: 
novel therapy-based or non-novel therapy-based (novel therapies include bortezomib, lenalidomide, or 
thalidomide)

This study was conducted at 259 centres across 29 countries in Europe, North America, Asia, 
Australia/New Zealand, and Japan. The first subject was enrolled on 17 May 2012 and the data cut-off 
date for this primary analysis was 19 July 2016. This period is referred to as the primary blinded 
treatment phase. Results from the blinded treatment phase after the primary analysis cut-off date (i.e., 
the extended blinded treatment phase) and open-label treatment phase will be reported separately.

A total of 1718 subjects were enrolled and randomized into 1 of the 2 treatment groups (Full Analysis 
Set); 1702 subjects (99.1%) received investigational product (Safety Analysis Set) and 185 subjects 
(10.8%) are included in the PK Analysis Set. A total of 1183 subjects were still on study as of the primary

The frequencies of discontinuation of study drug were similar across arms in the pivotal study, including 
due to death and adverse events. Discontinuation of study was numerically higher in denosumab arm 
(31.7 vs 30.6%), where numerically higher discontinuation rates due to adverse vent (1.5 vs 0.5%) and

discontinuation due to death was numerically lower in the denosumab arm (14.0 vs 14.8%).  
Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations 
CSR p. 60: 
Two hundred twenty-three subjects (13.0%) had important protocol deviations during the study; the 
incidence was 13.2% for the denosumab group and 12.8% for the zoledronic acid group. The most 
frequently reported categories of important protocol deviations were receiving the wrong treatment or 
incorrect dose (6.2% in both treatment groups) and missing data (5.6% denosumab group, 6.3% 
zoledronic acid group). The incidence of specific protocol deviations was similar between treatment 
groups. Based on their nature and incidence, it is unlikely that these deviations affected the interpretation 
of the study results; this is supported by the finding that per protocol analyses of the efficacy results 
were consistent with results for the Full Analysis Set.  
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol (dated 16 March 2011) was modified 3 times. The most current version, Amendment 
3, is dated 12 August 2015. The changes are summarised in Table 6.  
Assessment report

Table 6. Summary of Protocol Amendments 
Sample size was changed in the third amendment. The protocol states that:  
“Amgen will monitor the rate of first on-study SRE pooled by treatment group; if it is lower than 
expected, Amgen and Daiichi Sankyo may choose to modify the sample size.”(Study protocol s.9)  
Am 3: “The protocol is being amended to: 
Increase the study sample size by 180 subjects and decrease power to 85%. It was observed that the 
rate of skeletal-related events was significantly lower than statistically predicted. The sample size 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/333703/2018

specified in the initial protocol was not large enough to achieve the number of skeletal-related events 
required for the study within the defined study period. Predictive modeling showed that increasing the 
sample size by 180 subjects (1520 to 1700) and decreasing the power to 85% (number of events from 
800 to 676) would allow the study to be completed within a similar time frame.” 
The amendment is considered acceptable. 
Baseline data 
Baseline demographics were well balanced between treatment groups. The study population consisted of 
54.4% men and 45.6% women with a mean (SD) age of 63.4 (10.6) years and a range of 29 to 91 years; 
45.5% of subjects were > 65 years old, including 15.9% who were ≥ 75 years old. The majority of 
subjects were white (82.1%), followed by Asian (12.1%), black (3.8%), and other (1.7%).

Demographic and baseline characteristics as well as disease history do not indicate clinically relevant 
differences between treatment groups. 
The high proportion of patients with pathological fractures and cord compression, radiation etc. is noticed.  
According to the study title, denosumab was compared with zoledronic acid to prevent SREs in subjects 
with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The MAH clarified that subjects were required to have evidence 
of at least 1 osteolytic lesion for enrolment and therefore a high incidence of SREs at diagnosis in this 
study was expected.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
Time to first on-study SRE (non-inferiority) 
The Using the 2-stage approach, denosumab was demonstrated to be non-inferior to zoledronic acid (NI 
margin 1.28) for the primary endpoint of time to first on-study SRE (p = 0.010). The HR (95% CI) of 
denosumab compared with zoledronic acid for time to first SRE was 0.98 (0.85, 1.14).  
The MAH states: The constancy assumption was not violated, indicating validity of the non-inferiority 
result. Similar results were seen for the Per-Protocol Analysis Set and for supportive analyses that used 
actual strata, alternative censoring, and inverse probability of censoring weighting for early dropout. 
Figure 3. Time to First On-Study SRE in Study 20090482 (Full Analysis Set) 
The median time to first on-study SRE was 22.8 (95% CI: 14.7, not estimable) months for denosumab 
and 24.0 (95% CI: 16.6, 33.3) months for zoledronic acid in Study 20090482. 
A high event rate up to month 3 is noticed. The MAH clarified that subject demographics and baseline 
characteristics, disease history, and laboratory analyte values were generally similar between the 
denosumab and zoledronic acid treatment groups among subjects who had their first on-study SRE within 
3 months.  Overall, 454 subjects (224 in the denosumab group and 230 in the zoledronic acid group) had 
their first on-study SRE within 3 months.

Source: SCE, Table 11 
The KM estimates of probability of subjects with SRE at different time-points were very similar across 
arms in the pivotal study, whereas a larger numerical difference was observed in the integrated 
supportive Phase 3 studies.  
Secondary endpoints 
Superiority of denosumab versus zoledronic acid in time to first on-study SRE 
Denosumab was not superior to zoledronic acid for time to first SRE. The median (95% CI) time to first 
SRE were 695.0 (448.0, not estimable) and 730.0 (504.0, 1014.0) days for denosumab and zoledronic 
acid, respectively. 
Homogeneity testing for time to first on-study SRE showed no evidence of inconsistent effects across the 
4 SRE components pathological fracture, radiation to bone, surgery to bone, and spinal cord compression 
(p=0.37). 
Superiority of Denosumab for First and Subsequent On-study SREs 
There was no significant difference between denosumab and zoledronic acid groups in time to first and 
subsequent SRE (p=0.84). The rate ratio (95% CI) of denosumab compared to zoledronic acid was 1.01 
(0.89, 1.15). The average number of events per patient was 0.66 in both groups.  
Similar results were seen for the Per-Protocol Analysis Set and for supportive analyses that used actual 
stratification and alternative censoring.

Denosumab was not superior to zoledronic acid for time to first SRE. There was also no significant 
difference between denosumab and zoledronic acid groups in time to first and subsequent (≥21 days) 
SRE using a multiple event analysis.

There was no significant difference between groups in overall survival (p=0.41). The adjusted HR (95% 
CI) of denosumab compared with zoledronic acid was 0.90 (0.70, 1.16). 
Ancillary analyses 
Progression-free survival

Disease progression was determined by the investigator. 
Median progression-free survival (95% CI) were 1403.0 (1044.0, not estimable) and 1077.0 (919.0, not 
estimable) days for denosumab and zoledronic acid groups, respectively, favouring denosumab [HR (95% 
CI) 0.82 (0.68, 0.99)] (exploratory). This was an exploratory endpoint and secondary endpoints 
furthermore failed to meet the objectives. In addition protocol amendment 2 changed the assessments of 
myeloma disease response and progression, including M protein measurements and radiographic images 
for lytic lesions and plasmacytomas, from central analysis to local analysis as per standard of care in the 
management of multiple myeloma. Therefore claims related to this outcome measure were not accepted 
for the SmPC.

Time to First On-Study Skeletal Related Event or Hypercalcaemia of Malignancy 
No significant difference between treatment groups was seen in the time to first on-study skeletal related 
event or hypercalcaemia of malignancy [HR (95% CI) 0.98 (0.85, 1.12)].  
Time to First On-Study Radiation to Bone 
Figure 6. Time to First On-Study Radiation to Bone – Pivotal Study 20090482, Primary Analysis, Full Analysis Set) 
No significant difference between treatment groups was seen in the time to first on-study radiation to 
bone [HR (95% CI) 0.78 (0.53, 1.14)]. 
Progression of Disease in Bone 
After protocol amendment 2 disease assessment procedure was changed to be performed locally and only 
first disease progression was reported and whether the first progression was in bone was determined. 
The number of subjects with progression in bone as the first disease progression, based on a blinded data 
review, was low in both groups [n (%;95% CI based on normal approximation of crude incidence) 
zoledronic acid 27 (3.1; 2.0, 4.3); denosumab 32 (3.7; 2.5, 5.0)].  
Proportion of Subjects with a SRE by Primary Analysis Data Cut-Off  
The proportion of subjects (95% CI based on normal approximation of crude incidence) with a SRE by the 
primary analysis data cut-off was 43.8% (40.5, 47.1) and 44.6% (41.3, 47.9) for denosumab and 
zoledronic acid, respectively.

Brief Pain Inventory – Short Form (BPI-SF): ‘worst’ pain score, pain severity, pain interference  
For pain measures based on the BPI-SF, the point estimate (95% CI) of the area under the curve (AUC) 
of worst pain, relative to baseline, was -1.04 (-1.32, -0.77) for denosumab and -0.69 (-0.95, -0.43) for 
zoledronic acid (p=0.072), and the point estimate (95% CI) of the AUC of the pain severity score was 
-0.72 (-0.92, -0.51) for denosumab and -0.40 (-0.59, -0.20) for zoledronic acid (p=0.024); other 
measures showed similar results between denosumab and zoledronic acid. 
Denosumab and zoledronic acid showed similar results in time to and proportion by visit for ≥2 point 
decrease, ≥2 point increase, and >4 point in worst pain score. 
Analgesic Use 
No significant differences between treatment groups were seen as regards analgesic use. The point 
estimate (95% CI) of the treatment difference on analgesic score relative to baseline was 0.06 (-0.08, 
0.21). 
Assessments of Health Status and Quality of Life 
Assessments of health status (EuroQol-5 Dimensions) and quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-
MY20) did not show significant differences between treatment groups.  
Percent Change in Bone Specific Alkaline Phosphatase Bone Turnover Marker Urinary N-Telopeptide 
Assessments of bone specific alkaline phosphatase and urinary N-telopeptide (uNTx) did not show 
significant differences between treatment groups. 
No significant difference between treatment groups was seen in the time to first on-study SRE or 
hypercalcaemia of malignancy, the Brief Pain Inventory – Short Form, in analgesic use, and the provided 
analyses of health status (EuroQol-5 Dimensions) and quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-
MY20). 
The number of subjects with progression in bone as the first disease progression was low and did not 
indicate relevant differences between groups. 
The proportion of subjects with a SRE by the primary analysis data cut-off was comparable between 
groups. Bone specific alkaline phosphatase and uNTx did not show significant differences between 
treatment groups.

The pivotal study’s overall HR of 0.98 for denosumab vs. ZA is mirrored in most subgroups, with a few 
notable exceptions. The small Japanese subgroup (n=42, 2.4% of overall study population) had a 
distinctly better (and statistically significant) HR compared with the non-Japanese subgroup. This may be 
a chance finding due to variation in a small subpopulation.

The results indicate that denosumab is statistically non-inferior to zoledronic acid with 
regard to time to first on-study SRE given an upper limit for the on-inferiority margin 
of 1.28 for the HR. The results for the PP population (HR: 1.03, 95%-CI: 0.89 – 1.19) 
are in line with the results reported above. However, the validity of the chosen non-
inferiority approach needs further justification.

2.4.2.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Table 9.Summary of main efficacy endpoints in the Pivotal Study 20090482 Compared with the Integrated 
Supportive Phase 3 Studies (20050136, 20050244, and 20050103) (Full Analysis Set) 
It is noted that with regard to the direct SRE outcomes, the hazard ratio (HR) point estimates for the 
comparison of denosumab vs. zoledronic acid are generally higher in the present MM study compared 
with the pooled supportive studies, while with regard to myeloma disease outcomes (PFS, OS), lower HR 
point estimates are observed in the present study. (See Table 9 above, and related KM curves.) The latter 
might potentially indicate an effect on the underlying MM disease. Statistical significance was however 
only observed for PFS (and the closely related outcome TTP). The Applicant confirmed that there were no 
differences in background MM therapy between study arms in the current study that might explain the 
finding in PFS.

Figure 9. Time to First On-Study SRE in the Integrated Supportive Phase 3 Studies, 20050136, 20050244, and 
20050103 (Full Analysis Set) 
The median time to first on-study SRE was 27.7 months for denosumab and 19.4 months for zoledronic 
acid. (SCE; section 3.2.1) 
The event rate at 3 months in the MM study was about 30+% vs. less than 20% in the integrated 
analysis, due to the more advanced bone disease in Study 20090482 compared with the integrated 
studies (proportion of subjects with a history of SREs prior to enrolment was approximately 40% in the 
integrated pivotal SRE studies, compared with approximately 67% in Study 20090482). The event rate 
after 3 months was in addition lower in the MM study compared with the integrated analysis. 
For KM estimates of probability of subjects with SRE at different time-points in the integrated supportive 
Phase 3 studies compared with the pivotal study, see Table 8 above.

Overall survival 
Figure 10. Overall Survival in Integrated Supportive Phase 3 Studies (20050136, 20050244, and 20050103; Full 
Analysis Set) 
Results of study 20090482 have been compared with integrated efficacy results from the supportive 
phase 3 studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103 investigating denosumab in the prevention of SREs 
in subjects with advanced malignancies involving bone, including multiple myeloma. Data from these 
supportive studies were the primary data for the approval of denosumab in the prevention of SREs in 
patients with bone metastases from solid tumours and have been evaluated in previous procedures.  
Baseline demographics in study 20090482 were generally comparable to the baseline demographics of 
the integrated supportive phase 3 studies. As regards baseline disease characteristics subjects in study 
20090482 were newly diagnosed and therefore the average time from initial diagnosis to randomisation 
was shorter than in the integrated dataset. 
In both datasets denosumab was non-inferior to zoledronic acid for the time to first on-study SRE.  
In study 20090482 denosumab was not superior to zoledronic acid for the time to first on-study SRE, 
while in the integrated analysis Kaplan Meier estimates indicated a consistent risk reduction for 
denosumab compared to zoledronic acid.  
Overall survival was not significantly different between groups in either dataset. The median time to 
disease progression excluding death favoured denosumab in study 20090482; in the integrated analysis 
the time to overall disease progression excluding death was shorter, but balanced between groups. Also 
the median progression-free survival favoured denosumab in study 20090482, while in the integrated 
analysis median progression-free survival was comparable in both groups.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application is based on a single pivotal study 20090482: A randomized, double-blind, multicenter 
study of Denosumab Compared With Zoledronic Acid in the Treatment of Bone Disease in Subjects With 
Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma. Patients with at least 1 lytic bone lesion planned to receive or 
receiving primary frontline anti-myeloma therapies were included. 
The study design was in line with previous denosumab oncology studies and the application is supported 
by these previously assessed clinical trials in other malignancies for which MAA has been already 
approved.  
The primary endpoint was Time to the first on-study SRE (non-inferiority), secondary endpoints were 
Time to the first on-study SRE (superiority), Time to the first-and-subsequent on-study SRE (superiority, 
using multiple event analysis) and Overall survival (OS). 
The main hypothesis was that Denosumab will be non-inferior to intravenous (IV) zoledronic acid on time 
to first on-study SRE in subjects with multiple myeloma. In the non-inferiority design, historical data from 
the literature were used to estimate the hazard ratio of placebo relative to the active control, zoledronic 
acid. 
The non-inferiority design with the margin based on historical data assumes constancy from study to 
study, i.e. that the estimate of the historical active-control effect is applicable in the current study. This 
was questioned by the CHMP. Patients responding well to myeloma therapy may also show a reduced risk 
for skeletal events and historically the CR rate was clearly below 10% whilst the majority of patients 
today show CR in response to modern therapy. The only published study identified by the MAH of some 
relevance for this application was the Medical Research Council (MRC) study Myeloma IX (2010, 2011, 
and 2012). This is a complex study with factorial design assuming absence of interaction between 
myeloma therapy and the tested bisphosphonates. The published papers did not allow for a detailed 
assessment of possible interactions, but superiority of zoledronic acid over clodronate was shown, i.e. 
activity was demonstrated also in case of, at that time, standard therapy. SRE are otherwise not reported 
in detail in recent publications, but the high early SRE rate is observed not only in the pivotal study for 
this application. It is also acknowledged that denosumab has shown superior activity compared with 
zoledronic acid in case of skeletal metastases for solid tumours. Altogether it has not been possible to 
confirm that the selected non-inferiority margin used in the planning and interpretation of the study 
results was appropriate, but circumstantial evidence, the high early event rate and the tight acceptance 
criteria provide a reasonable basis for accepting that efficacy has been demonstrated. 
Updated clinical guidelines recommend the use of skeletal targeting therapies irrespective of background 
myeloma therapy, but also that need for further therapy may be reconsidered in case of e.g. minimal 
residual disease negativity. In the absence of data supporting this notion, the SmPC includes no 
recommendations regards duration of therapy.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The frequencies of discontinuation of study drug were similar across arms in the pivotal study Baseline 
demographics were well balanced between treatment groups. 
Primary endpoint 
Time to first on-study SRE (non-inferiority) 
Using the 2-stage approach, denosumab was demonstrated to be non-inferior to zoledronic acid (NI 
margin 1.28) for the primary endpoint of time to first on-study SRE (p = 0.010). The HR (95% CI) of 
denosumab compared with zoledronic acid for time to first SRE was 0.98 (0.85, 1.14).  
Secondary endpoints 
Denosumab was not superior to zoledronic acid for time to first SRE. There was also no significant 
difference between denosumab and zoledronic acid groups in time to first and subsequent (≥21 days) 
SRE using a multiple event analysis 
There was no significant difference between groups in overall survival (p=0.41). The adjusted HR (95% 
CI) of denosumab compared with zoledronic acid was 0.90 (0.70, 1.16). 
No significant difference between treatment groups was seen in the time to first on-study radiation to 
bone. No significant difference between treatment groups was seen in the time to first on-study SRE or 
hypercalcaemia of malignancy, the Brief Pain Inventory – Short Form, in analgesic use, and the provided 
analyses of health status (EuroQol-5 Dimensions) and quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-
MY20).The number of subjects with progression in bone as the first disease progression was low and did 
not indicate relevant differences between groups. The proportion of subjects with a SRE by the primary 
analysis data cut-off was comparable between groups. Bone specific alkaline phosphatase and uNTx did 
not show significant differences between treatment groups. 
Results of study 20090482 have been compared with integrated efficacy results from the supportive 
phase 3 studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103 investigating denosumab in the prevention of SREs 
in subjects with advanced malignancies involving bone, including multiple myeloma. In both datasets 
denosumab was non-inferior to zoledronic acid for the time to first on-study SRE.  
In study 20090482 denosumab was not superior to zoledronic acid for the time to first on-study SRE, 
while in the integrated analysis Kaplan Meier estimates indicated a consistent risk reduction for 
denosumab compared to zoledronic acid.  
Overall survival was not significantly different between groups in either dataset.  
Median progression-free survival (95% CI) favoured denosumab [HR (95% CI) 0.82 (0.68, 0.99)]. This 
was an exploratory endpoint and secondary endpoints failed to meet the objectives. In addition protocol 
amendment 2 changed the assessments of myeloma disease response and progression, including M 
protein measurements and radiographic images for lytic lesions and plasmacytomas, from central analysis 
to local analysis as per standard of care in the management of multiple myeloma. Therefore claims 
related to this outcome measure were not accepted for the SmPC. 
Overall, therefore it has not been possible to confirm that the selected non-inferiority margin used in the 
planning and interpretation of results from study 20090482 was appropriate, but overall circumstantial 
evidence, the high early skeletal event rate and the tight acceptance criteria provide a reasonable basis 
for accepting that efficacy has been demonstrated.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The magnitude of efficacy of denosumab in terms of a reduction of SRE has not been possible to quantify, 
but qualitatively benefit has been shown in this large zoledronic acid comparative study conducted in 
patients with multiple myeloma. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety data is presented from the primary analysis of Study 20090482, a phase 3 study in subjects with 
multiple myeloma. Integrated data is presented from 3 supportive studies of denosumab in subjects with 
advanced cancer involving bone (phase 3 SRE Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103), which 
served as the basis for the currently approved indication of prevention of SREs in patients with bone 
metastases from solid tumors.   
The Safety Analysis Set for Study 20090482 includes all subjects who were randomized and received at 
least 1 dose of investigational product in the primary blinded treatment phase. Subjects were analyzed 
according to their treatment received, regardless of treatment assigned (ie, the treatment received by a 
subject was determined based on the first investigational product dose administered). The Primary 
Advanced Cancer Safety Analysis Set for the Integrated Supportive Phase 3 Studies 20050136, 
20050244, and 20050103 (ie, the SRE integrated analysis set) includes data for all subjects who were 
randomized in either Study 20050103, 20050136, or 20050244 and received ≥ 1 dose of investigational 
product in the primary blinded treatment phase of the study. 
The following adverse events of interest for denosumab were summarized separately for Study 
20090482: 1. hypocalcaemia; 2. adjudicated positive osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ); 3. adjudicated 
positive atypical femoral fracture (AFF); 4. adverse events potentially associated with hypersensitivity; 5. 
musculoskeletal pain; 6.cardiac disorders; 7.vascular disorders; 8. infections and infestations; 9. new 
primary malignancy; 10. osteonecrosis excluding the jaw.  
Although not an adverse event of interest for denosumab, Treatment-emergent events associated with 
renal toxicity were summarized and a post hoc analysis of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
Potentially Associated with Acute Phase Reactions During the First 3 Days was performed.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In Study 20090482, 110 (12.9%) in the denosumab group and 98 subjects (11.5%) in the zoledronic acid 
group had adverse events leading to investigational product discontinuation. The most frequently 
reported adverse events leading to discontinuation of investigational product (≥ 0.5% in either treatment 
group) (denosumab, zoledronic acid) were ONJ (2.5%, 1.6%), plasma cell myeloma (0.9%, 0.5%), 
cardiac failure (0.5%, 0.0%), pneumonia (0.4%, 0.6%), blood creatinine increased (0.2%, 0.8%), and 
sudden death (0.1%, 0.5%).

Adjudicated events of osteonecrosis of the jaw 
Table. Adjudicated events of osteonecrosis of the jaw 
In study 20090482, subject-year adjusted incidence rates (event rate per 100 subject-years) were 2.7 
events per 100 subject-years in the denosumab group and 1.9 events per 100 subject-years in the 
zoledronic acid group. A post hoc analysis of the subject-year incidence rate of adjudicated ONJ by time 
period showed that incidence rates were numerically higher in the second and third years compared with 
the first year for both treatment groups. 
As of 04 January 2017, ONJ had resolved in 12 subjects (35%) and 6 subjects (25%); ONJ was ongoing 
in 10 subjects (29%) and 8 subjects (33%) in the denosumab and zoledronic acid groups, respectively. 
The remaining subjects had either withdrawn consent, had a fatal event unrelated to the ONJ, or had 
unknown outcome for their ONJ. 
In the current study, the vast majority of ONJ events were grades 2-3. As the duration of ONJ is per 
definition >8 weeks, these events are considered to have a significant impact in the quality of life of the 
affected patient 
ONJ was treated with antibiotics and oral rinses in approximately 50% of the cases. Surgical treatments 
for ONJ (i.e. sequestrectomy, debridement and curettage) were required in 16/34 subjects in the 
denosumab group and 10/24 subjects in the zoledronic acid group. In addition, 2 subjects in each 
treatment group required bone resection.  
Sixteen of 35 subjects in the denosumab group and 13 of 24 subjects in the zoledronic acid group 
withdrew from investigational product due to ONJ. 
In study 20090482, patients with active dental or jaw condition or planned invasive dental procedures 
were excluded. However, ONJ was more common in this study than in the integrated supportive phase 3 
studies.  
Osteonecrosis of the jaw is an important identified risk for denosumab and subject for additional risk 
minimization measures.  
The MAH has confirmed that, overall, osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) occurred with a higher incidence 
among subjects randomized to denosumab compared to zoledronic acid across the 4 Xgeva clinical 
studies. The absolute difference in this risk was largest in the multiple myeloma population (Study 
20090482) where ONJ was reported at highest frequency.

In the current study, an imbalance in new primary malignancy 22 (2.6%) vs 12 (1.4%) was noted. New 
primary malignancy is listed as a potential important risk for denosumab but has so far been based 
mostly on theoretical concerns. RANKL is expressed on activated T and B cells and in the lymph nodes 
and some reports have described immune modulatory effects of RANKL inhibition. If denosumab did 
affect immune function, a hypothetical association with malignancies linked to immune modulation could 
exist. 
Advanced cancer populations are at increased risk for new primary malignancy because of their existing 
malignancy, possible genetic predisposition, and exposure to chemotherapy and radiation treatment 
(Anand et al, 2008; WHO, 2010). 
Estimates of new primary malignancy pooled for pivotal studies in approved indications that all used 
zolendronic acid as a comparator: 20090482, 20050136, 20050244 and 20050103 are presented..  
It is acknowledged that the incidence and event rates for any new primary malignancy (NPM) were low 
and the absolute differences in event rates were small – but, however, detectable and higher for 
denosumab. No treatment-related pattern in individual cancers or cancer groupings was apparent. A 
substantial proportion of cases occurred early in the XGEVA studies (within 6 to 12 months) which does 
not exclude involvement a potential mechanism related to impaired immune surveillance.

10.  Osteonecrosis excluding the jaw 
Osteonecrosis events excluding ONJ were assessed in Study 20090482. One (0.1%) subject in the 
denosumab group and 2 subjects in the zoledronic acid group experienced osteonecrosis (preferred term) 
Osteonecrosis events excluding ONJ were not tabulated for the Integrated Supportive Phase 3 Studies 
20050136, 20050244, and 20050103. 
11.  Adverse Events Potentially Associated With Renal Toxicity 
Based on denosumab's mechanism of action and pharmacologic profile, no adverse effects on renal 
function were expected with denosumab administration. However, patients with renal impairment are of 
greater risk of serious hypocalcemia following denosumab administration. Both pamidronate and 
zoledronic acid are not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment. 
In Study 20090482, the most frequently reported adverse event Associated With Renal Toxicity was blood 
creatinine increased (denosumab 3.8%; zoledronic acid 8.7%).  There was no clear pattern regarding 
other renal adverse events: acute kidney injury (denosumab 3.4%; zoledronic acid 4.5%), renal failure 
(2.2%; 4.5%), and renal impairment (0.7%; 1.6%). Serious adverse events potentially associated with 
renal impairment reported by more than 1 subject were renal failure (denosumab 0.5%; zoledronic acid 
0.6%), and blood creatinine increased (0.2%; 0.4%). 
In the Integrated Supportive Phase 3 Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103, adverse events 
potentially associated with renal toxicity were reported for 5.1% of subjects in the denosumab group 
(2.5% serious) and 6.8% of subjects in the zoledronic acid group (3.5% serious). 
12.  Post-hoc analysis of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Potentially Associated with 
Acute Phase Reactions During the First 3 Days  
Acute phase reactions (including pyrexia, musculoskeletal discomfort, and flu-like symptoms) are known 
side effects of zoledronic acid administration and were not anticipated with denosumab treatment. In 
Study 20090482 a post hoc analysis was conducted to determine the subject incidence of adverse events 
potentially associated with acute phase reactions during the first 3 days of the study. 
These events were reported for 5.4% of subjects in the denosumab group and 8.7% of subjects in the 
zoledronic acid group. The difference was mainly due to pyrexia (denosumab 0.6%, zoledronic acid 3.6%) 
whereas other symptoms such as bone pain (denosumab 1.4%, zoledronic acid 1.5%) and fatigue (1.4%, 
1.5%) and asthenia (0.6%, 0.8%) were similar in both groups.   
Laboratory findings 
For Calcium levels, please see the section above. 
Phosphorus: 182 (21.4%) subjects in the denosumab group and 134 (15.7%) subjects in the zoledronic 
acid group had grade 3 below normal results. In Study 20090482, median percent decreases of -13% and 
-11%, were observed in the denosumab and zoledronic acid groups, respectively, at week 5. Phosphorus 
values remained at these levels through week 97, then continued to decline through week 141 (median 
decrease from baseline -18.4% and -15.1%, respectively). 
In the Integrated Supportive Phase 3 Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103, similar to the 
changes observed in Study 20090482, median percent decreases of -18.8% and -11.8%, were observed 
in the denosumab and zoledronic acid groups, respectively, at week 5. Phosphorus values remained at 
approximately 5% to 10% below baseline values. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/333703/2018 
Page 54/69 
 
  
  
Overall, 417 (14.7%) subjects in the denosumab group and 205 (7.2%) subjects in the zoledronic acid 
group had grade 3 decreases in phosphorus; 18 (0.6%) subjects and 4 (0.1%) subjects had grade 4 
decreases. 
Creatinine: 
In Study 20090482, median creatinine values at baseline were 79.56 μmol/L (0.90 mg/dL) for both 
treatment groups. The median percent change in creatinine values was approximately -11% for both 
treatment groups through week 25. 
Subsequently, creatinine values returned to baseline by week 33 in the zoledronic acid group and by 
week 61 in the denosumab group. The incidences of CTCAE toxicity grade 3 and 4 elevated serum 
creatinine, respectively, were 0.7% and 0.2% in the denosumab group and 1.6% and 0.2% in the 
zoledronic acid group. 
In the Integrated Supportive Phase 3 Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103, median creatinine 
values at baseline were 71.60 μmol/L (0.81 mg/dL) for both treatment groups. Creatinine values reached 
a nadir at week 5 (median percent change from baseline was -6.25% in the denosumab group and -
1.41% in the zoledronic acid group, subsequently returning to baseline values by week 17. 
The incidences of CTCAE toxicity grade 3 and 4 elevated serum creatinine, respectively, were 0.7% and 
0.0% in the denosumab group and 0.7% and 0.3% in the zoledronic acid group. 
Other laboratory values were without significant imbalances between groups. 
Antidenosumab Antibody Formation 
In Study 20090482 1 subject tested positive for antidenosumab antibodies at baseline and 1 subject 
tested positive for developing antidenosumab antibodies. Both samples tested negative for neutralizing 
activity. No neutralizing antibodies have been reported in any denosumab clinical study to date. Of the 62 
denosumab-treated subjects within the pharmacokinetics subset, all subjects tested negative for binding 
antibodies. Consequently, the impact of antidenosumab antibodies on denosumab exposure could not be 
assessed. 
Safety in special populations 
Age:  
For the subgroup analysis of adverse events for subjects < 65 years vs ≥ 65 years, > 95% of subjects in 
both treatment groups and age groups experienced adverse events. The most frequently reported 
adverse events occurred at generally similar rates between the treatment groups in both the < 65 years 
and ≥ 65 years age groups. In the denosumab group, there were no adverse events occurring at higher 
rates (> 5% difference) in the ≥ 65 years age group compared to < 65 years. However, subjects in the < 
65 years group experienced diarrhoea, nausea, pyrexia, fatigue, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, 
insomnia, and rash at higher rates than in the ≥ 65 years age group. 
Impaired renal function: 
As a result of its mechanism of action (ie, lowering rates of bone resorption), denosumab has the 
potential to lower serum calcium values; this may be especially relevant in patients with impaired renal 
function. 
Assessment report

The pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of denosumab were evaluated in a phase 1 study in healthy 
volunteers and subjects with impaired renal function (Study 20040245) and in subjects with severe CKD 
(creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) and CKD on dialysis (end-stage renal disease [ESRD]) (Study 
20101361). The results of this study indicate that no dose adjustments of denosumab are required when 
administered to patients with renal impairment. 
Postmarketing data 
Denosumab was initially approved on 26 May 2010 (International Birth Date) in the European Union (EU) 
for indications related to bone loss under the proprietary name of Prolia. As of 26 September 2016, the 
cumulative worldwide marketing authorization status for Prolia includes approvals in the US, European 
Economic Area (EEA), Japan, and over 80 countries worldwide. 
Denosumab was initially approved on 18 November 2010 in the United States and on 13 July 2011 in the 
EU/EEA for the prevention of SREs in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors under the 
proprietary name of XGEVA. XGEVA was also approved on 13 June 2013 in the US for the treatment of 
adults and skeletally mature adolescents with GCTB that is unresectable or where surgical resection is 
likely to result in severe morbidity. As of 26 September 2016, the cumulative worldwide marketing 
authorization status for XGEVA includes approvals in the US, EU/EEA, Japan, and over 70 countries or 
administrative districts worldwide. 
From the Periodic Safety Update Reports (cut-off date of 26 September 2016), it has been estimated that 
a total of 6541836 patient-years of exposure to Prolia and 533356 patient-years exposure to XGEVA has 
occurred through commercial distribution since marketing approval. 
As of 26 September 2016, Amgen received cumulatively a total of 109604 (17150 XGEVA, 92454 Prolia) 
adverse drug reactions associated with denosumab from medically confirmed and unconfirmed 
spontaneous sources. Of the 17150 case reports for XGEVA, 7083 were serious adverse drug reactions 
and 10067 were nonserious adverse drug reactions. 
Cumulatively through 26 September 2016, the most frequently reported adverse events for XGEVA were 
in the system organ classes of musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (3508 events), 
metabolism and nutrition disorders (2384 events), general disorders and administration site conditions 
(2151 events), and gastrointestinal disorders (1750 events). From postmarketing experience, adverse 
reactions of severe symptomatic hypocalcaemia, including fatal cases, hypersensitivity reactions including 
anaphylactic reactions, and musculoskeletal pain including severe cases have been observed in patients 
receiving XGEVA. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In the Xgeva SmPC, very common adverse reactions include musculoskeletal pain, diarrhoea and 
dyspnoea. In the RMP, important identified risks for denosumab 120 mg per month in cancer patients 
include hypocalcaemia, osteonecrosis of the jaw, hypersensitivity reactions and musculoskeletal pain. 
Atypical femoral fracture, another important identified risk, may be likely a more relevant risk in the 
osteoporosis population treated with denosumab due to potential longer treatment duration. 
In the RMP, the important potential risks for denosumab 120 mg per month in cancer patients include 
infection, cardiovascular events, malignancy, osteonecrosis outside the jaw including external auditory 
canal, immunogenicity and thyroid function disorder.  
Safety data was presented from the primary analysis of the pivotal study of this application, study 
20090482, a phase 3 study in subjects with multiple myeloma. Integrated data was presented from 3 
Assessment report

supportive studies of denosumab in subjects with advanced cancer involving bone (phase 3 SRE Studies 
20050136, 20050244, and 20050103), which served as the basis for the previously approved indication 
of prevention of SREs in patients with bone metastases from solid tumours. In all these studies, 
zoledronic acid served as active comparator. Hypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia, cardiovascular events, 
hypersensitivity reactions, musculoskeletal pain and osteonecrosis of the jaw are labelled adverse events 
also for zoledronic acid.  
Patients were treated approximately 4-5 months longer in study 20090482 than on average in the 
integrated supportive phase 3 studies. A total of 75 patients were treated with denosumab ≥ 3 years in 
study 20090482 compared to only 6 patients in the integrated supportive phase 3 studies (by the primary 
analysis cut-off; not including any open-label extension).   
Overall, the number of serious adverse events and deaths seem comparable between treatment groups in 
both study 20090482 and integrated supportive phase 3 studies. 
Hypocalcaemia is an identified important risk for denosumab. The data indicates that both reported 
adverse events of hypocalcaemia, serious hypocalcaemia and low calcium laboratory values are more 
common in denosumab treated patients compared to zoledronic acid. This is now reflected in additional 
information provided in the SmPC section 4.8. Careful monitoring of S-Ca is previously advised for Xgeva 
in the SmPC.  
In study 20090482, patients with active dental or jaw condition or any planned invasive dental 
procedures were excluded. However, ONJ was still more common in this study than in the integrated 
supportive phase 3 studies. The MAH provided several plausible explanations for the increased frequency 
of adverse events of ONJ in the multiple myeloma population compared to patients with bone metastasis 
from solid tumours. These include duration of exposure, multiple myeloma bone physiology and 
concomitant use of glucocorticoids. This increased risk of ONJ is reflected in additional information 
provided in the SmPC section 4.8, should be taken into account when assessing optimal treatment 
duration and is also reflected in advice on proposed precautionary measures in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
The maximal severity of ONJ events according to AAOMS ONJ severity staging criteria is missing in the 
study report. The severity of events cannot be estimated on treatments used alone as the patients’ 
general health status may affect the choice of treatment approach (conservative vs surgery). The AAOMS 
staging criteria is established and defines severity grades of osteonecrosis of the jaw. Stage 2 is defined 
as: Exposed bone with pain and with clinical evidence of infection and stage 3 is defined as:  Exposed 
bone with pain, infection, and one or more of the following: pathologic fracture, extra-oral fistula, or 
osteolysis extending to the inferior border. However, in actual studies, investigators should assess 
adverse event severity using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3 
grading scale. This scale does not define specific symptoms for osteonecrosis of the jaw. However, the 
CTCAE grades 2 and 3 seem roughly correspond AAOMS stages 2 and 3 for this specific adverse event.  
Both stages are symptomatic and require medical intervention: patient education, antibacterial rinses and 
antibiotics. Stage 2 does require at most superficial debridement whereas grade 3 is treated with surgery, 
depending on the patient general condition. In the current study, the vast majority of ONJ events were 
grades 2-3. As the duration of ONJ is per definition >8 weeks, these events are considered to have a 
significant impact in the quality of life of the affected patient. 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw is an important identified risk for denosumab and subject for additional risk 
minimization measures. The MAH has confirmed that, overall, osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) occurred 
with a higher incidence among subjects randomized to denosumab compared to zoledronic acid across 
the 4 Xgeva clinical studies. The absolute difference in this risk was largest in the multiple myeloma 
population (Study 20090482) where ONJ was reported at highest frequency. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/333703/2018 
Page 57/69 
 
  
  
In controlled clinical studies with denosumab vs zoledronic acid, more adverse events of new primary 
malignancy were noted and the results were statistically significant. In contrast, there was no difference 
in these events in other denosumab clinical studies with placebo as a comparator.  
Hypothetically, this could be explained as protective effect of zoledronic acid. Alternative explanation 
could be that patients in the denosumab/zoledronic acid studies had generally a more advanced cancer 
disease (or multiple myeloma) and could be more vulnerable to the theoretical mechanism of impaired 
immune surveillance.   
It is acknowledged that the incidence and event rates for any new primary malignancy (NPM) were low 
and the absolute differences in event rates were small – but, however, detectable and higher for 
denosumab. No treatment-related pattern in individual cancers or cancer groupings was apparent. A 
substantial proportion of cases occurred early in the XGEVA studies (within 6 to 12 months) which does 
not exclude involvement of a potential mechanism related to impaired immune surveillance.  
The difference between denosumab and zolendronic acid groups is mainly driven by the current study 
20090482 in multiple myeloma RR 1.86 (0.98, 3.54) and study 20050103 in treatment of bone 
metastases in men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer 1.80 (0.84, 3.89).  The Subject-year 
Adjusted Rate Ratio was 1.50 (0.83, 2.73) in Study 20090482 and 1.55 (0.73, 3.29) in Study 20050103. 
Only few events occurred in the other somewhat shorter SRE studies in patients with bone metastasis. 
The CHMP considers that this imbalance in the current study 20090482 in multiple myeloma does not 
preclude approval of this new indication. However, continued follow-up of the issue of ‘new primary 
malignancy’ is required and foreseen in the next PSUR.  
Creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min was an inclusion criteria of the study. The incidences of CTCAE toxicity 
grade 3 and 4 elevated serum creatinine, respectively, were 0.7% and 0.2% in the denosumab group and 
1.6% and 0.2% in the zoledronic acid group. Pyrexia within 3 days after treatment was reported 0.6% in 
denosumab group and 3.6% of the zoledronic acid group. Prophylactic treatment of acute phase reaction 
with antipyretic agents was not included in the study treatments. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety concerns from the pivotal study 20090482 in multiple myeloma are in line with the 
known safety concerns in previous studies of denosumab in subjects with advanced cancer involving 
bone.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The application is based on a single pivotal study 20090482: A randomized, double-blind, multicentre 
study of denosumab compared with zoledronic acid in the treatment of bone disease in subjects with 
newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Patients with at least 1 lytic bone lesion planned to receive or 
receiving primary frontline anti-myeloma therapies were included. 
The study design was in line with previous denosumab oncology studies and the application is supported 
by these previously assessed clinical trials in other malignancies for which the product has been already 
approved.  
The primary endpoint was Time to the first on-study Skeletal-related event (SRE) (non-inferiority); 
secondary endpoints were Time to the first on-study SRE (superiority), Time to the first-and-subsequent 
on-study SRE (superiority, using multiple event analysis) and Overall survival (OS). 
The main hypothesis was that denosumab will be non-inferior to intravenous (IV) zoledronic acid on time 
to first on-study SRE in subjects with multiple myeloma.  
In the non-inferiority design, historical data from the literature were used to estimate the hazard ratio of 
placebo relative to the active control, zoledronic acid. 
The frequencies of discontinuation of study drug were similar across arms in the pivotal study and 
baseline demographics were well balanced between treatment groups. 
Primary endpoint: Time to first on-study SRE (non-inferiority) 
Assessment report

Using the 2-stage approach, denosumab was demonstrated to be non-inferior to zoledronic acid (NI 
margin 1.28) for the primary endpoint of time to first on-study SRE (p = 0.010). The HR (95% CI) of 
denosumab compared with zoledronic acid for time to first SRE was 0.98 (0.85, 1.14).  
Secondary and ancillary endpoints 
Denosumab was not superior to zoledronic acid for time to first SRE. There was also no significant 
difference between denosumab and zoledronic acid groups in time to first and subsequent (≥21 days) 
SRE using a multiple event analysis. 
There was no significant difference between groups in overall survival (p=0.41). The adjusted HR (95% 
CI) of denosumab compared with zoledronic acid was 0.90 (0.70, 1.16). 
No significant difference between treatment groups was seen in the time to first on-study radiation to 
bone. No significant difference between treatment groups was seen in the time to first on-study SRE or 
hypercalcaemia of malignancy, the Brief Pain Inventory – Short Form, in analgesic use, and the provided 
analyses of health status (EuroQol-5 Dimensions) and quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-
MY20). The number of subjects with progression in bone as the first disease progression was low and did 
not indicate relevant differences between groups. The proportion of subjects with a SRE by the primary 
analysis data cut-off was comparable between groups. Bone specific alkaline phosphatase and uNTx did 
not show significant differences between treatment groups. 
Median progression-free survival (95% CI) were 1403 (1044, not estimable) and 1077 (919, not 
estimable) days for denosumab and zoledronic acid groups, respectively, favouring denosumab, HR (95% 
CI) 0.82 (0.68, 0.99) (exploratory endpoint). 
Results of study 20090482 have been compared with integrated efficacy results from the supportive 
phase 3 studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103 investigating denosumab in the prevention of SREs 
in subjects with advanced malignancies involving bone, including multiple myeloma. In both datasets 
denosumab was non-inferior to zoledronic acid for the time to first on-study SRE. Overall survival was not 
significantly different between groups in either dataset.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The main hypothesis was that denosumab will be non-inferior to intravenous (IV) zoledronic acid on time 
to first on-study SRE in subjects with multiple myeloma. In the non-inferiority design, historical data from 
the literature were used to estimate the hazard ratio of placebo relative to the active control, zoledronic 
acid. 
The non-inferiority design with the margin based on historical data assumes constancy from study to 
study, i.e. that the estimate of the historical active-control effect is applicable in the current study. In this 
case the main issue was whether the activity of background myeloma therapy influences the add-on 
activity of zoledronic acid. This is of importance as major improvement has been shown in relation to the 
introduction of new classes of myeloma drugs. 
During the procedure, the MAH provided data referring to a new study Myeloma IX, a UK Medical 
Research Council sponsored study. This is a rather complex study with two pathways, patients eligible for 
high dose therapy with stem cell support and patients not eligible for high dose therapy. In both 
pathways more intensive therapy was compared with standard therapy by randomisation, plus 
randomised add-on zoledronic acid vs. clodronate. 
Of special interest is the pathway where the old standard melphalan+prednisolone (MP) was compared 
with cyclophosphamide, thalidomide and dexamethasone (CTD), a reasonably modern myeloma regimen 
showing a clear improvement in ORR compared with the old standard MP. The study was reported as a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/333703/2018 
Page 65/69 
 
  
  
2x2 factorial design study without assumed interaction between myeloma therapy and bisphosphonates 
with favourable skeletal event outcomes in the zoledronic acid arm. The results of interaction tests, 
however, were not reported for the skeletal event endpoints and not by outcome in relation to 
background myeloma therapy, of special interest MP vs. CTD. These results from the MRC study were not 
available to the MAH, but Myeloma IX at least confirms the activity of zoledronic acid in terms of SRE in 
myeloma.  
Available data from recent confirmatory studies were also scrutinized with the aim to define whether 
there is an interaction between MM therapy and bisphosphonates as regards SRE. There are potentially 
informative biomarkers available as regards to skeletal turnover, but those were not used in any 
confirmatory study, not even SRE rate was consequently reported. No data supporting or refuting this 
rather straightforward hypothesis were identified. As CR rate has improved from <<10%, utilized in the 
studies defining the non-inferiority margin, to close to 90% in modern first-line four drug combinations, 
this is considered a relevant issue. In an exploratory analysis of the Myeloma IX study, it was reported 
that only in patients in CR after high-dose therapy, there was no difference in SRE between clodronate 
and zoledronic acid, implying the need for bone targeting therapy also in patients with very good partial 
response.     
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In the Xgeva SmPC, very common adverse reactions include musculoskeletal pain, diarrhoea and 
dyspnoea. In the RMP, important identified risks for denosumab 120 mg per month in cancer patients 
include hypocalcaemia, osteonecrosis of the jaw, hypersensitivity reactions and musculoskeletal pain.  
Safety data was presented from the primary analysis of pivotal Study 20090482, a phase 3 study in 
subjects with multiple myeloma. Integrated data was presented from 3 supportive studies of denosumab 
in subjects with advanced cancer involving bone (phase 3 SRE Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 
20050103), which served as the basis for the previously approved indication of prevention of SREs in 
patients with bone metastases from solid tumours.  
Overall, the number of serious adverse events and deaths seem comparable between treatment groups in 
both study 20090482 and integrated supportive phase 3 studies. 
Hypocalcaemia is an identified important risk for denosumab. The data indicates that both reported 
adverse events of hypocalcaemia, serious hypocalcaemia and low calcium laboratory values are more 
common in denosumab treated patients compared to zoledronic acid. This is now reflected in the SmPC 
4.8 wording. Careful monitoring of S-Ca was already advised for Xgeva in the SmPC.  
In study 20090482, patients with active dental or jaw condition or any planned invasive dental 
procedures were excluded. However, ONJ was still more common in this study than in the integrated 
supportive phase 3 studies. There are several plausible explanations for the increased frequency of 
adverse events of ONJ in the multiple myeloma population compared to patients with bone metastasis 
from solid tumours. These include duration of exposure, multiple myeloma bone physiology and 
concomitant use of glucocorticoids. 
In the pooled analysis of results from phase 3 studies 20090482, 20050136, 20050244 and 20050103, 
osteonecrosis of the jaw was significantly more common in denosumab than in zoledronic acid treated 
patients. This is now reflected in the SmPC 4.8 wording. 
Creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min was an inclusion criteria of the study. The incidences of CTCAE toxicity 
grade 3 and 4 elevated serum creatinine, respectively, were 0.7% and 0.2% in the denosumab group and 
1.6% and 0.2% in the zoledronic acid group. Pyrexia within 3 days after treatment was reported 0.6% in 
Assessment report

denosumab group and 3.6% of the zoledronic acid group. Prophylactic treatment of acute phase reaction 
with antipyretic agents was not included in the study treatments. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
In all large pivotal Xgeva studies, Zoledronic acid served as active comparator. Hypocalcaemia, 
hypophosphataemia, cardiovascular events, hypersensitivity reactions, musculoskeletal pain and 
osteonecrosis of the jaw are labelled adverse events also for zoledronic acid. Theoretically, the risk of 
these adverse events with Xgeva is likely to be higher if compared with placebo.  
MM therapy has evolved rapidly over the last few years. It is unclear how the choice of these treatments 
predisposes the patients for specific side effects. 
New primary malignancy is listed as a potential risk in the Xgeva RMP.  In the current study, a numerical 
imbalance in new primary malignancies, 22 (2.6%) with denosumab vs. 12 (1.4%) with zoledronic acid, 
was noted. Estimates of new primary malignancy pooled for pivotal studies in approved indications that 
all used zoledronic acid as a comparator (studies 20090482, 20050136, 20050244 and 20050103) were 
presented in this variation. An increased risk with RR 1.64 (95% CI: 1.07-2.52) was noted in the pooled 
analysis. It is acknowledged that the incidence and event rates for any new primary malignancy (NPM) 
were low and the absolute differences in event rates were small and the clinical impact may be limited. 
However, the difference was detectable and higher for denosumab. No treatment-related pattern in 
individual cancers or cancer groupings was apparent. A substantial proportion of cases occurred early in 
the XGEVA studies (within 6 to 12 months) which does not speak against involvement of a potential 
mechanism related to impaired immune surveillance.  
The CHMP considers that this imbalance does not preclude approval of this new indication. However, 
continued follow-up of the issue of ‘new primary malignancy’ is required and foreseen in the next PSUR.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
As a composite, the events pathologic fracture, radiation to bone, spinal cord compression, or surgery to 
bone are defined as skeletal-related events (SREs). Sequelae of the severe cases may include debilitating 
pain, impairment of ambulation, and numbness or weakness, urinary or faecal incontinence, and 
paralysis. As such SRE is a patient relevant outcome measure. 
In patients with newly diagnosed, high-risk myeloma, as in the current study, the early SRE rate is high, 
despite modern myeloma therapy and bone targeting agents (BTA), with about 30% over the first 3 
months. This high event rate is expected to be difficult to reduce by a more effective myeloma therapy, 
whilst patients later reaching CR or MRD negative status may stop BTA after a period of well controlled 
myeloma, but in no case there are clinical data to support this notion. The Myeloma IX trial indicates that 
zoledronic acid is active and significantly superior to clodronate in terms of reducing SREs. Furthermore, 
the time to first SRE is very similar in the zoledronic acid and the denosumab arms of study 20090482 
(see figure above) and denosumab has been shown to be superior to zoledronic acid in solid tumours with 
skeletal metastases. The pathophysiology differs between bone metastases caused by solid tumours and 
by lesions caused by myeloma, but osteoclast activation is a common element and therefore a target for 
both bisphosphonate and denosumab activity. Based on these lines of reasoning it is accepted that the 
benefit of denosumab is sufficiently demonstrated in patients with myeloma.      
ONJ is a lesion occurring in the oral cavity as an area of exposed alveolar or palatal bone, unhealed for > 
8 weeks. Approximately half of the subjects with positively adjudicated ONJ in clinical denosumab trials 
had surgical treatment for ONJ, few cases required bone resection. Over 50% of the ONJ study cases 
were unresolved or continued until death in pivotal SRE and CRPC studies for XGEVA. 
Hypocalcaemia can be associated with life-threatening conditions, if untreated, such as QT prolongation 
and cardiac arrhythmia.  
There were no imbalances compared to zoledronic acid in the current study for following important 
identified risks for Xgeva: severe hypersensitivity reactions and musculoskeletal pain. 
The use of intravenous bisphosphonates, the current standard of care for the prevention of SREs in 
patients with multiple myeloma, is associated with renal toxicity, which may be an important clinical 
problem in patients with renal impairment. Renal impairment is present in up to half of newly diagnosed 
patients with multiple myeloma. It should be noted, however, that hypocalcaemia (more common in 
denosumab treated patients compared to zoledronic acid) is an important ADR of denosumab, which is 
increased especially in patients with impaired renal function, with fatal cases reported and therefore 
requiring careful monitoring of serum-calcium in these patients. 
The proposed indication has been revised during the procedure and now reads:  
“Prevention of skeletal related events (pathological fracture, radiation to bone, spinal cord compression or 
surgery to bone) in adults with advanced malignancies involving bone (see section 5.1)”

Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit of delaying skeletal related events is considered to outweigh the risk of treatment with XGEVA 
in patients with advanced malignancies involving bone.

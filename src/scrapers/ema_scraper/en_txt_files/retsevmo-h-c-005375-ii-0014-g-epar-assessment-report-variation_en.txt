2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The MAH is seeking an extension of indication of selpercatinib for the first line treatment of advanced 
RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC).  
Selpercatinib has a conditional approval for previously treated advanced RET mutant MTC (cabozantinib 
and/or vandetanib). 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Thyroid cancer can be broken down into 4 main types: papillary, follicular, medullary and anaplastic. Of 
these 4, medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a rare subtype representing about 3% to 5% of all thyroid 
cancers (Accardo et al. 2017). Medullary thyroid cancer is an uncommon malignant tumour arising from 
the calcitonin- producing parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid. Robust epidemiology data specific to 
MTC are sparse. 
In adults, MTC occurs as a sporadic entity in 70% to 80% of cases and as familial MTC in 25% of cases. 
In paediatrics, the aetiology is reversed, with most cases familial in nature and the minority of cases 
being sporadic. RET point mutations, insertions, or deletions are present in most MTCs, including both 
familial (i.e., multiple endocrine neoplasia [MEN] and other familial MTC syndromes) and sporadic cases 
(Ji et al. 2015; Heilmann et al. 2016). An estimated 65% to 90% of sporadic MTCs contain RET mutations 
(Moura et al. 2009; Romei et al. 2018; Larouche et al. 2019). 
Biologic features 
RET  is  a  receptor tyrosine  kinase  critical to  development of  the  enteric  nervous  system  and  kidneys. 
Genetic alterations in RET have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several human cancers including 
NSCLC,  poorly  differentiated  thyroid  cancers,  and  MTCs.  RET  can  become  oncogenically  activated 
through two primary mechanisms: 
1-  chromosomal  rearrangements,  which  produce  cytoplasmically  localised  oncogenic  hybrid 
proteins that fuse the RET kinase domain with a partner protein dimerisation domain and lead 
to ligand-independent constitutive activity,  
and 
2-  point  mutations,  insertions,  and  deletions  (indels),  which  directly  or  indirectly  activate  the 
kinase. 
RET point mutations, insertions, or deletions are present in most MTCs (Ji et al. 2015; Heilmann et al. 
2016).

Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Although the overall 10-year survival rate for patients with MTC is high (75% to 85%), the clinical course 
of MTC is highly heterogeneous, varying from indolent tumours that remain unchanged for many years 
to aggressive cancers associated with high mortality. However, survival decreases with locally invasive 
and locally advanced disease. Although surgery can be curative for approximately 85% of patients who 
present with localized disease, recurrence develops in up to 50% of all patients after surgery (Wells et 
al. 2015). Metastatic MTC is considered incurable and MTC patients with distant metastasis have a 5-
year 
survival 
of 
38% 
after 
initial 
diagnosis 
(American 
Cancer 
Society 
[https://www.cancer.org/cancer/thryoid-cancer/detectiondiagnosis-  staging/survival-rates]).  Distant 
metastasis is the main cause of death in MTC patients. Oncogenic RET mutations occur in the majority 
of MTCs (Ji et al. 2015), including more than 90% of hereditary MTCs and 50% to 60% sporadic MTC 
(Donis-  Keller et al. 1993; Mulligan  et al.  1993; Eng et  al. 1994; Hofstra et  al. 1994; Agrawal et al. 
2013; Ji et al. 2015). 
Management 
MTC is not sensitive to  radioactive iodine  and is only  curable through surgical resection (Pacini et al. 
2012), but recurrent disease occurs in approximately 50% of patients after resection (Wells et al. 2015). 
Locally recurrent disease is treated with reoperation and/or external beam radiation therapy. However, 
these treatments are associated with significant morbidity and are often not curative. Metastatic MTC is 
managed  with  resection,  radiation,  or  systemic  therapies  as  noted  below,  but  is  currently  incurable. 
Children and adolescents with MTC are treated in the same manner as adults, with initial thyroidectomy 
then re-resection, radiation, or systemic therapy with recurrent disease (Starenki and Park 2015). 
There  are  no  RET-specific  inhibitors  licensed  for  the  treatment  of  first-line  RET-mutant  MTC.  The 
unselective  MKIs  vandetanib  and  cabozantinib  are  approved  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic MTCs, in adults and including children over the age of 5 in 
the case of vandetanib, irrespective of the RET status and irrespective of prior treatment. Cabozantinib 
and vandetanib have shown tumour response  rates  in MTC of 28% and 45% and PFS improvements 
(over placebo) of 7.2 and 11.2 months, respectively; neither drug has demonstrated an OS benefit (Elisei 
et al. 2013; Wells et al. 2015). 
Patients with advanced RET-mutant MTC have a poor prognosis and a significant unmet medical need. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Selpercatinib is an inhibitor of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase (including KIF5B-RET and CCDC6-RET). 
RETSEVMO (Selpercatinib) was granted a CMA on 11 Feb 2021 for  
1) the treatment of metastatic RET fusion-positive NSCLC in adult patients who require systemic therapy 
following prior treatment with immunotherapy and/or platinum-based chemotherapy,  
2)  RET  fusion-positive  thyroid  cancer  who  require  systemic  therapy  following  prior  treatment  with 
sorafenib and/or lenvatinib and  
3)  RET-mutant  MTC  in  adult  and  pediatric  patients  12  years  of  age  and  older  who  require  systemic 
therapy following prior treatment with cabozantinib and/or vandetanib. 
The conditional MA was approved based on ORR and  DOR  observed in the ongoing Phase  1/2 study, 
LIBRETTO-001.

EMA/681951/2022

The presence of a RET gene fusion (NSCLC and non-medullary thyroid cancer) or mutation (MTC) should 
be confirmed by a validated test prior to initiation of treatment with Retsevmo. 
The recommended dose of Retsevmo based on body weight is: 
-Less than 50 kg: 120 mg twice daily. 
-50 kg or greater: 160 mg twice daily. 
If  a  patient  vomits  or  misses  a  dose,  the  patient  should  be  instructed  to  take  the  next  dose  at  its 
scheduled time; an additional dose should not be taken.  
Treatment should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
On 21 June 2022, an extension of indication of selpercatinib for the first line treatment of metastatic RET 
fusion-positive NSCLC Not previously treated with a RET inhibitor was granted. 
The MAH is seeking an extension of indication of selpercatinib for the first line treatment of advanced 
RET mutant MTC 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Selpercatinib is currently being investigated in the Phase 1/2 study, LIBRETTO-001 (LOXO-RET-
17001). It is a multicenter, single-arm, multicohort, open-label, dose-escalation study in patients 12 
years or older with advanced solid tumours, including RET fusion-positive solid tumours, RET-mutant 
MTC, and other tumours with RET activation. 
LIBRETTO-001 was initiated in May 2017. The Phase 1 portion of the study has been completed, and 
the Phase 2 portion is ongoing.   
CHMP protocol assistance was sought on the design of LIBRETTO-001 to support an indication in RET-
mutant MTC, including whether the inclusion of a small number of patients (at least 10) without prior 
vandetanib/cabozantinib therapy could support an initial MAA for a broader indication including TKi-
naïve patients. CHMP considered that ORR data from such a small number of patients would likely not 
be sufficient to establish a benefit-risk in first line patients.  
Data at the DCO date of 15 June 2021 are submitted to support the use of selpercatinib for the 
treatment of RET mutant advanced MTC regardless of line of therapy. The exploratory objectives are 
not presented at the DCO. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The  MAH  stated  that  the  clinical  trial  LOXO-RET-17001  that  support  the  proposed  indication  of 
selpercatinib was conducted in accordance with Consensus  ethics principles derived from international 
ethics  guidelines,  including  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki  and  Council  for  International  Organizations  of 
Medical  Sciences  (CIOMS),  International  Ethical  Guidelines  for  Biomedical  Research  Involving  Human 
Subjects,  and  the  International  Conference  on  Harmonisation  (ICH)  Good  Clinical  Practices  (GCP) 
Guideline (E6). 
The  clinical  trial  LOXO-RET-17001  (LIBRETTO-001)  conducted  outside  the  European  Union  meets  the 
ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Study  LOXO-RET-17001  was  subject  to  independent  audit  by  regulatory  authorities.  The  audits 
performed as of 15 June 2021 were:

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The specific inhibitory activity of selpercatinib against RET-dependent tumours has been demonstrated 
in several in vitro and in vivo studies. Single and repeat dose pharmacokinetic studies have 
characterized the ADME profile in animals. Repeated-dose toxicity studies of up to 3 months duration 
were conducted in rats and minipigs. Toxicities common to both species and specific to each were 
observed and reported in the SmPC. The genotoxicity study revealed an equivocal result in the in vivo 
micronucleus test. The toxicity study program is satisfactory under ICH S9. 
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Selpercatinib is an inhibitor of the RET tyrosine kinase (encoded by the RET proto-oncogene). 
It is used to treat some cancers caused by abnormal changes in the RET gene, which have spread 
and/or which cannot be removed by surgery: 
- non-small cell lung cancer, in adults, 
- thyroid cancer in adults, 
- medullary thyroid cancer, in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age. 
The prevalence calculations are admissible and comply with guidance document EMEA/CHMP/4447/00. 
The predicted environmental concentration PECsw of selpercatinib in surface water is at 0.033 µg/L, 
therefore higher than the limit value (0.01 µg/L) set by the guide document EMEA/CHMP/4447/00. 
Additional phase II trials were therefore conducted. 
Regarding phase II studies :  
Part A: Fate in the environment  
The adsorption coefficient Koc was established on 4 soils and 3 sludges from treatment plants (OECD 
106). Adsorption is particularly strong on soils (320285 L/kg on average) whereas it is 988 L/kg on 
average on sludge. 
The high adsorption properties of selpercatinib are also noted in the aquatic sediment degradation 
study (OECD 308) in which selpercatinib rapidly partitioned into the sediment layer with a half-life in 
water of less than 'one day. The hydrolysis of selpercatinib (OECD 111) shows that the product is not 
very hydrolysable with a half-life greater than 1 year regardless of the pH. Aerobic transformation in a 
sludge system is evaluated according to the OECD 314B protocol. Selpercatinib undergoes multiple 
transformations with a product representing more than 10% of the initial radioactivity. The time of 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/681951/2022  
Page 11/66 
 
 
 
 
disappearance of 50% of the product (DT50) is 3.46 days in the test and, after adjusting the 
temperatures, it is established at 7.4 days. 
The aerobic transformation in an aquatic sedimentary system is evaluated according to the OECD 308 
protocol. The time of disappearance of 50% of the product (DT50) is, after temperature adjustment, 
257 and 338 days depending on the sediment tested. Consequently, a test on sedimentary organisms 
(chironomids) was carried out in Phase II Tier B. 
Tier A: Effects on aquatic organisms 
A respiration inhibition test on activated sludge was performed according to the OECD 209 protocol. 
The no observed effect concentration (NOEC) for activated sludge microorganisms is 1000 mg/L. An 
algae growth inhibition test was performed according to the OECD 201 protocol. The no observed 
effect concentration (NOEC) for algae is 1700 µg/L. A reproduction test on Daphnia magna daphnia 
was carried out according to the OECD 211 protocol. 
The NOEC for daphnids is 97 µg/L for mortality, reproduction and growth. A test on Pimephales 
promelas fish was carried out according to the OECD 210 protocol. The NOEC for fish is 160 µg/L. A 
test on sedimentary organisms (chironomids) was carried out according to the OECD 218 protocol. The 
NOEC for chironomids is 298 mg/kg. Based on these ecotoxicity test results, the predicted PNEC no-
effect concentrations for the different organisms are established. The PEC/PNEC ratios were calculated 
and are all well below 1. Selpercatinib therefore does not appear to present a risk to aquatic organisms 
in the environment. 
Tier B 
The bioconcentration factor in BCF fish was measured (OECD 305) since the log Kow of selpercatinib is 
greater than 3 at pH 7 and pH 9. The normalized values of BCF being 98 and 42 L/kg, they are lower 
than the threshold of 2000 L/kg. Selpercatinib therefore does not meet the criterion for 
bioaccumulation. 
PBT potential 
The OECD 308 sediment transformation test shows that selpercatinib is very persistent in sediments 
and fulfills the vP criterion. However, it does not meet the vB criterion since the OECD fish 
bioaccumulation test showed that the BCF bioconcentration factor is below the regulatory classification 
thresholds. It is neither bioaccumulable (BCF<2000 L/kg), nor very bioaccumulable (BCF<5000 L/kg). 
Selpercatinib is therefore not classified as vPvB.

2.2.3.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The ERA for Retsevmo (selpercatinib) file is complete and generally well constructed. It does not give 
rise to any particular comments and the MAH's conclusions are acceptable. Selpercatinib does not 
appear to pose a risk to aquatic organisms in the environment and is not classified as a PBT or vPvB. 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of selpercatinib.  
The MAH is however recommended to amend the calculations and information regarding the study on 
aerobic transformation in aquatic sediment systems according to OECD 308 as follows: 
i) The MAH should use the SFO kinetic instead of DFOP for the DT50 derivation of total system 1, 
Brandywine creek.  
ii) The MAH should correct the study summaries in the ERA and in the study report in terms of the 
kinetic used to derive the DT50 value for total system 2, Choptank River. 
iii) The MAH should recalculate the DT50 values for the water compartments using the FOMC kinetic.  
iv) The MAH should provide a table in the ERA summarising all DT50 values at 20 and 12 °C. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community

Study Title 
LOXO-RET-17001 
A Phase 1/2 Study of Oral LOXO-292 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumours, 
Including RET Fusion-Positive Solid Tumours, Medullary Thyroid Cancer, and Other 
Tumours with RET Activation (LIBRETTO-001) 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of selpercatinib were sufficiently characterized in the initial MAA.  
There  are  neither  new  PK  data  that  would  change  the  main  PK  features  of  selpercatinib  nor  special 
populations. Also, no revision of section 5.2 PK properties of the SmpC is claimed.  
The PK data provided in support of this submission include: 
• 
Descriptive,  noncompartmental  methods  of  analysis  of  selpercatinib  PK  data  from  all  MTC 
patients enrolled in the pivotal study LOXO-RET-17001 (LIBRETTO-001) as of the submission 
data cut-off date (10 June 2021) and,

The PK data of MTC patients from the pivotal study LOXO-RET-17001 are presented in the paragraph 
“PK  in  target  population”.  For  DDI  data,  Please  refer  to  the  paragraph  “Pharmacokinetic  interactions 
studies”. 
Pharmacokinetic in target population 
PK data from study LOXO-RET-17001 as of the data cutoff of 10 June 2021 were previously reported 
in the NSCLC CSR (please refer to EMEA/H/C/005375/II/0011). Of the 757 patients with evaluable PK 
data, 313 were MTC patients.  
Table 1 presents the available steady-state exposure (AUC0-24 and Cmax at steady state [C1D8]) of 
selpercatinib for patients with MTC taking 160 mg selpercatinib BID with (MTC: +Cab/+Van) or without 
(MTC:-Cab/-Van; naïve patients) a previous treatment by cabozantinib and/or vandetanib. Figure 1 
presented the associated box-plots to visualize the PK parameters distribution.

Figure 1: Boxplots of plasma selpercatinib Cmax and AUC0-24 following selpercatinib 160 mg BID 
administrations (C1D8) 
The steady-state exposure for selpercatinib in MTC: -Cab/-Van patients and MTC: +Cab/+Van patients 
was comparable. The geometric mean AUC0-24and Cmax PK parameters were similar and the 95%CI 
overlapped substantially in MTC: -Cab/-Van and MTC: +Cab/+Van patients.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Selpercatinib is an inhibitor of the rearranged during transfection (RET) receptor tyrosine kinase. 
Certain point mutations in RET or chromosomal rearrangements involving in frame fusions of RET with 
various partners can result in constitutively activated chimeric RET fusion proteins that can act as 
oncogenic drivers by promoting cell proliferation of tumour cell lines. In in vitro and in vivo tumour 
models, selpercatinib demonstrated anti-tumour activity in cells harboring constitutive activation of 
RET protein resulting from gene fusions and mutations, including CCDC6 RET, KIF5B RET, RET V804M, 
and RET M918T. In addition, selpercatinib showed anti-tumour activity in mice intracranially implanted 
with a patient-derived RET fusion-positive tumour. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
No new data have been submitted as part of this application. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
No new data have been submitted as part of this application. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In the current submission, PK data in MTC patients from the pivotal study LOXO-RET-17001 (cut-off date 
of 10 June 2021, N=313) were provided.  Using a NCA approach, PK exposure parameters at steady-
state  (AUC0-24h,  Cmax)  were  determined  from  MTC  patients  RET-naïve  (max  n=128)  and  RET-prior 
(max n=125). Overall,  steady state systemic exposure of  selpercatinib in patients with MTC naïve vs 
those with prior systemic therapy appears to be similar.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, no significant difference in PKs characteristics of selpercatinib is observed in patients with MTC 
RET-naïve (-Cab/-Van) compared to patients with MTC RET-prior systemic therapy (+Cab/+Van). 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
Study LIBRETTO-001 is an open-label, multicentre, global Phase 1/2 study of selpercatinib in patients 
with RET-altered advanced solid tumours that was initiated in May 2017. The Phase 1 portion of the 
study allowed to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose of 
selpercatinib. A dose of 160 mg BID was selected for Phase 2. 
The approved dose as recommended in the SmPC is 160 mg taken orally twice daily (body weight 50 
mg or greater).

Treatments 
The RP2D of selpercatinib (160 mg BID) was selected in Phase 1 and has been used as the starting 
dose for patients in the Phase 2 dose expansion phase of the study. 
Patients continued selpercatinib dosing in 28-day cycles until PD, unacceptable toxicity, or other 
reason for treatment discontinuation. Patients with PD could continue selpercatinib if, in the opinion of 
the Investigator, the patient was deriving clinical benefit from continuing study treatment, and 
continuation of treatment was approved by the Sponsor.

Objectives and endpoints 
Table 2. Objectives and endpoints of LIBRETTO-001 (Phase 2) 
Sample size 
Under the planned primary analysis of effectiveness, a true ORR of ≥ 40% is hypothesized when LOXO-
292 is administered to patients with RET-mutant MTC who require systemic therapy, have progressed 
following prior treatment and have no acceptable alternative treatment options. 
A sample size of 55 patients is estimated to provide 89% power to achieve a lower boundary of a 2-
sided 95% exact binomial confidence interval (CI) about the estimated ORR that exceeds 20%. Ruling 
out a lower limit of 20% for ORR is considered clinically meaningful patients who have failed prior 
multikinase inhibitor therapy (eg, cabozantinib and/or vandetanib), are in need of systemic therapy, 
and have limited treatment options for their advancing disease. Under the primary analysis, the lower 
limit of the 95% CI will exceed 20% when the estimated ORR is 33% or greater (Clopper-Pearson 
method). 
Randomisation 
The study was not randomised. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was not blinded. 
Statistical methods 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/681951/2022  
Page 19/66 
 
 
 
 
The protocol (appendix [Protocol and Addenda]) and the SAPs approved prior to database lock 
(appendix [Documentation of Statistical Methods]) provide the planned analyses for the study, 
comparisons, statistical tests, and determination of sample size. 
This interim report provides clarification regarding the derivation of the analysis sets that support 
evaluation of the MTC data for selpercatinib. 
Analysis Sets 
Patients enrolled into the Phase 1 dose escalation as well as the Phase 1 and Phase 2 dose expansion 
cohorts were grouped to derive the analysis sets. 
The goal of the arrangement of these various data sets was to: 
-maximize information through the consolidation of data from both Phase 1 and Phase 2 parts of 
LIBRETTO-001, and 
-define groupings based on clinically meaningful distinctions, resulting in similarity of patients within a 
group, thus, facilitating the interpretation of results. 
Efficacy Analysis Set for RET-Mutant MTC 
Patients with RET-mutant MTC who had received at least 1 dose of selpercatinib and achieved at least 
6 months of potential follow-up time from the first dose of selpercatinib (or disease progression or 
death, whichever occurred first), as of 15 June 2021, were considered eligible for efficacy analyses. 
Response is assessed approximately every 2 months, and 6 months of follow up provides sufficient 
time for initial responses to be confirmed. 
The evaluation of efficacy consists of RET-mutant MTC analysis sets as defined in Table 3.1 (the basis 
for the initial regulatory submissions) and includes patients enrolled into Phase 2 Cohorts 3, 4, and 5. 
Cohort 6 includes patients who have received prior treatment with a selective RET inhibitor but 
discontinued due to intolerance and are therefore not included in the efficacy analysis; these patients 
were excluded in LIBRETTO-001 until Cohort 6 was introduced in protocol version 8. 
The efficacy analysis for RET-mutant MTC primarily focused on 1) patients not previously treated with 
cabozantinib and vandetanib (primary efficacy analysis set) and 2) patients previously treated with 
cabozantinib and/or vandetanib (supportive efficacy analysis set). A total of 314 RET-mutant MTC 
patients were considered part of the efficacy evaluable dataset. Efficacy was further assessed using the 
supportive efficacy analysis sets described in Table 3.

Table 3: Description of Efficacy Analysis Sets 
The efficacy analysis sets were derived to facilitate the regulatory review of the LIBRETTO-001 data. 
These analysis sets are distinctive from those specified in the protocol and documented in the SAP. 
This interim CSR follows the SAP (appendix [Documentation of Statistical Methods]) prepared to 
document and specify the statistical methods used for analyses to demonstrate the effectiveness and 
the safety of selpercatinib in patients with RET-mutant MTC. 
There were no changes in the planned analyses for the study.

Protocol Deviations 
Important protocol deviations were defined as those which could potentially impact the study 
assessment, participant rights, and the study integrity. Protocol deviations were reviewed by the 
Sponsor and none of these deviations were considered to have a marked impact on safety or efficacy 
evaluations. 
Important protocol deviations for this interim analysis were the same as those reported in the previous 
NSCLC CSR (15 June 2021 data cutoff).

Numbers analysed 
At the DCO date, 314 patients with RET mutant MTC are included in the efficacy analysis as they had 
achieved at least 6 months of potential follow-up time from the first dose. 
The primary efficacy analysis set to support the proposed first-line indication included 142 patients not 
previously treated with Cabozantinib and/or Vandetanib (MTC:-Cab/-Van patients); of these 115 patients 
were naïve to any systemic therapy (MTC:TrtNaive Patients);and 27 patients were naïve to Cabozantinib 
and Vandetanib but previously treated with other systemic therapy (MTC:TrtOther). 
The main supportive analysis sets include:

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The provided efficacy data in support of the currently intended indication “treatment of adults and 
adolescents 12 years and older with advanced RET mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) not 
previously treated with a RET inhibitor” is based on results from the ongoing study LOXO-RET-17001 
(LIBRETTO-001) as of the cut-off date of 15 June 2021. This was an open-label, multicentre, phase 1/2 
study which consisted on a dose escalation phase (phase 1) to determine the MTD and RP2D of 
selpercatinib followed by a Phase 2 expansion with diverse RET-altered cancer cohorts (6 cohorts), 
among them NSCLC (1L/2L), MTC, and other tumours.  
The Phase 1 portion of the study has been completed. The Phase 2 portion is ongoing and continuing 
to enrol patients with advanced solid tumours.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
LIBRETTO-001 is non-randomized and non-blinded single arm study. The absence of a control arm is an 
important limitation and a source of bias for a confirmatory study. Overall, inclusion and exclusion criteria 
are considered acceptable. Amendments made on eligibility criteria since the initial submission of the 
CMA (DCO of June 2019) are not expected to have a substantial impact on study population or efficacy 
data. A new cohort, cohort 6, was introduced by amendment protocol (version 9) to include patients who 
discontinued another selective RET inhibitor because of intolerance. Efficacy data from patients with MTC 
in this cohort is not yet available and this was adequately reflected in the therapeutic indication. 
The RP2D of selpercatinib (160 mg BID) was selected in Phase 1 and has been used as the starting dose 
for patients in the Phase 2 of the study. Patients continued selpercatinib dosing in 28-day cycles until 
PD, unacceptable toxicity, or other reason for treatment discontinuation. Patients with PD could continue 
selpercatinib if, in the opinion of the investigator,  they deriving clinical benefit from  continuing study 
treatment.  
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  ORR  based  on  RECIST  v1.1.  Given  the  uncontrolled  design  of  the 
clinical trial, ORR could be an acceptable primary endpoint. PFS, OS and DOR were assessed as secondary

endpoints. It is important to consider that even if results in term of ORR are outstanding, interpretation 
of benefit in term of survival endpoints is difficult and uncertain in uncontrolled setting. FDA censoring 
rules were used for DoR and PFS. Patients enrolled into the Phase 1 dose escalation as well as the Phase 
1  and  Phase  2  dose  expansion  cohorts  were  grouped  to  derive  the  analysis  sets.  Patients  with  RET-
mutant MTC who had received at least 1 dose of selpercatinib and achieved at least 6 months of potential 
follow-up time from the first dose of selpercatinib (or disease progression or death, whichever occurred 
first), as of 15 June 2021, were considered eligible for efficacy analyses. 
As of the 15 June 2021 data cutoff, 796 patients had been enrolled in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 cohorts 
and were treated with at least 1 dose of selpercatinib. Of these, 314 patients were RET mutant MTC and 
are considered eligible for efficacy analyses. Of the 314 efficacy eligible patients with RET-mutant MTC, 
221 (70.4%) patients were still on treatment. The most common reason for treatment discontinuation 
for patients was PD (40 [12.7%]). A total of 21 patients (6.7%) discontinued treatment due to an AE. 
Of  the  142  MTC:-Cab/-Van  patients,  83.1%  of  patients  were  still  on  treatment.  The  main  reason  for 
treatment discontinuation was AE (5.6%) followed by withdrawal of consent (4.2%). 
Of the 151 MTC:+Cab/+Van patients, 57.0% of patients were still on treatment. The main reason for 
treatment discontinuation was progressive disease (23.2%) followed by AE (7.9%). 
The MAH provides information on study conduct from Protocol version 8.0 up to Protocol version 9.0 (03 
June 2020). Some of the changes introduced with Protocol v8 are the addition of a new cohort (Cohort 
6) to allow the inclusion of patients previously treated with another RET-selective inhibitor with around 
50 patients planned to be enrolled. Efficacy data from this cohort are not yet available. Moreover, with 
protocol  v9  the number  of  patients  to  be  enrolled  in  Cohort  1  and  Cohort 5  is  increased,  in  order  to 
accommodate  enrolment  demand  and  allow  for  the  characterization  of  AEs  that  may  occur  with  low 
frequency.  
A  tabulated  summary  of  important  protocol  deviations  for  RET-Mutant  MTC  safety  population  was 
provided  The Applicant clarified that none of these deviations were considered to have a marked impact 
on safety or efficacy evaluations. 
The MTC population is relatively young and could be considered representative of the disease as in most 
of the cases this is a hereditary condition of early onset. The median age for cab and van naïve patients 
was 57 years old, with patients enrolled from 15 up to 87 years old and the most numerous age group 
was 45 – 64 years. The total population under 18 years old were 2 patients. A total of 47.2% of patients 
had a baseline ECOG score of 1. 
The majority of the MTC:-Cab/-Van patients were stage IV at the diagnosis. Median time from diagnosis 
to study entry was 54.4 months, which is line with relatively long survival of the disease. At study entry, 
almost all of the patients were metastatic and present at least one measurable lesion per investigator. 
Of the 142 MTC: -Cab/-Van patients, 115 patients (81%) were treatment naïve and 27 patients (19%) 
received  prior  systemic  therapy  including  other  therapies  than  cabozantinib  and/or  vandetanib 
(chemotherapy, immunotherapy, sorafenib, lenvatinib, radioactive iodine). 
Regarding RET mutation, M918T was the most common mutation (60% of patients) although other less 
frequent mutations were also present (i.e. extracellular cysteine [23.2%], V804M/L [4.2%], and others 
[12%]). In most cases the method used for RET determination was NGS on tumour (75.4%), followed 
by PCR (13.4%).  
The median time on treatment for the MTC safety population (N=319) was 24.4 months, ranging from 
0.2  to  47.8  months.  Concerning  the  dose  exposure  to  selpercatinib,  not  all  the  patients  reached  the 
intended dose (160 mg BID). Median TOT was 24.4 months in the MTC Safety Population.

Baseline demographics and disease characteristics for patients previously treated with platinum based 
chemotherapy remain consistent with those provided at the DCO of June 2019. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The evidence supporting of the claimed indication in first line Ret mutant MTC came from the 142 cab/van 
naïve  patients.  Of  these  –cab/-van,  115  patients  were  naïve  to  any  systemic  therapy  (MTC:TrtNaive 
patients); and 27 patients were naïve to Cabozantinib and Vandetanib but previously treated with other 
systemic therapy (MTC:TrtOther). 
Supportive  evidence  came  mostly  from  the  151  patients  previously  treated  with  Cabozantinib  and/or 
Vandetanib.  
Cabozantinib and/or Vandetanib naïve mutant MTC: -Cab/-Van patients. 
As of the cut-off date of 15 June 2021, the ORR among 142 -Cab/-Van naïve patients was 81.0%; (95% 
CI:  73.6,  87.1)  by  IRC  and  77.5%  (95%CI:  69.7,  84)  by  Investigator’s  assessment.  The  overall 
concordance rate between IRC and Investigator assessments was 86.6%. 
At the time of the DCO, 26 of the 58 responders (44.8%) had progressed or died. The median DOR by 
IRC assessment was not reached, with a median follow-up of 20.3 months (95% CI: 17.7, 22.1) with 
81.7% of responders were still on treatment. The rate of DoR at 12 months was 91.9% (95% CI: 85.0, 
95.7); at 24 months, 83.7% (95% CI: 73.0, 90.4).  
The clinical benefit rate, defined as proportion of patients with a CR or PR, or SD  lasting 16 or more 
weeks, was 94.4% (134 out of 142 patients; 95% CI: 89.2, 97.5). 
The disease control rate, defined as proportion of patients with CR, PR, or SD (of any duration) as their 
best response, was 96.5% (137 out of 142 patients; 95% CI: 92.0, 98.8). 
As determined by IRC assessment, the majority  of  patients demonstrated a reduction in tumour size 
from baseline. For the 115 responders in the RET-mutant MTC:-Cab/-Van, the median TTR and TTBR by 
IRC assessment was 3.5 months and 3.6 months, respectively. 
Median PFS by IRC was not reached with a median follow-up of 24.5 months (95% CI: 22.0, 25.2). At 
the  time  of  data  cutoff,  75.2%  of  patients  were  still  on  treatment  with  no  documented  disease 
progression. The rate of PFS at 12 months was 91.0% (95% CI: 84.7, 94.8); at 24 months, 81.1% (95% 
CI: 72.4, 87.3). 
Median duration of observed OS was not estimable with 90.1% of patients remaining alive at a median 
follow-up of 26.3 months (95% CI: 24.3, 27.8). The rate of OS at 12 months was 99.3% (95% CI: 94.9, 
99.9), at 24 months was 95.0% (95% CI: 89.0, 97.7), and at 36 months was 89.7% (95% CI: 76.2, 
95.8). The OS data is not yet considered mature. 
The biochemical response rate for calcitonin was 95.1% (95% CI: 90.1, 98.0) and for CEA was 79.4% 
(95% CI: 71.6, 85.9). 
Analysis  by  subgroups  in  MTC:-Cab/-Van  patients  did  not  reveal  any  remarkable  difference  to  main 
analysis. Overall, ORR were mostly in line with the main analysis. 
Prior +Cab/+Van MTC patients 
The ORR in the 151 MTC:+Cab/+Van patients, was of 73.5% (95% CI: 65.7, 80.4) by IRC and 70.9% 
(95% CI: 62.9, 78.0) by Inv with a concordance rate of 80.1%. There was 14 CR (9.3%). 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

The median DoR by IRC assessment was not reached, with a median follow-up of 22.9 months (95% CI: 
20.3, 25.4) with 54.1% of patients were still on treatment. The rate of DoR at 12 months was 82.8% 
(95% CI: 74.1, 88.8); at 24 months, 64.5% (95% CI: 52.9, 73.9). The mDOR by inv was 31.7 months 
(95%CI: 26.1, NE). 
The CBR, was 91.4% (138 out of 151 patients; 95% CI: 85.7, 95.3) per IRC assessment. The ORR of 
70.9% for selpercatinib (including 95 patients who did not achieve response on their last prior therapy), 
was remarkably higher than the ORR of 9.9% (n=15) for the last prior therapy. 
The median TTR and TTBR by IRC assessment was 3.5 months and 3.7 months, respectively. 
Estimated median duration of PFS by IRC was 34.0 months (95% CI: 25.7, NE) with a median follow-up 
of 27.6 months (95% CI: 24.929.8). At the time of data cutoff, 45.0% of patients by IRC assessment 
were  still  on  treatment  with  no  documented  disease  progression.  The  rate  of  PFS  at  12  months  was 
78.7%  (95%  CI:  70.9,  84.6);  at  24  months,  64.4%  (95%  CI:  55.4,  72.0).  Observations  based  on 
Investigator assessments were in line with IRC assessments (33.4 months (95% CI: 24.7, NE)) 
Median OS was not reached with 67.5% of the patients remaining alive and continuing OS follow-up at 
a median follow-up time of 28.8 months (95% CI: 22.8, 34.5). The rate of OS at 12 months was 87.7% 
(95% CI: 81.2, 92.1), at 24 months was 77.2% (95% CI: 69.3, 83.4), and at 36 months was 65.5% 
(95% CI: 53.7, 75.0). The OS data is not yet considered mature. 
The biochemical response rate for calcitonin was 91.9% (95% CI: 86.3, 95.7) and for CEA was 74.0% 
(95%  
Overall results were consistent with those of the primary analysis that led to the initial CMA. 
The  efficacy  results  among  the  27  patients  who  were  naïve  to  Cabozantinib  and  Vandetanib  but 
previously treated with other systemic therapy (MTC:TrtOther) are overall consistent with those of naïve 
to any systemic therapy (MTC:TrtNaive Patients). 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Selpercatinib is also intended to be used in adolescent patients (i.e. ≥12 years) with RET-mutant MTC. 
In the study LIBRETTO-001, a total of three adolescent patients (15, 16 and 17 years, respectively) 
were included. Since according to the PIP (P/0369/2019) at least 2 evaluable subjects must be 
included for the primary analysis this measure was considered compliant with the PIP. The proposed 
dose of selpercatinib in adolescent patients with MTC is the same as for adults (i.e. 160 mg BID). 
However, in the study LOXO-RET-18036, an ongoing study in paediatric patients, including adolescent 
patients, a dose of 92 mg/m2 BID (with a maximum dose of 160 mg BID) was considered appropriate. 
Thus, further justification was requested on the selected dose for adolescent patients with MTC. In 
study LIBRETTO-001, the same dose was selected for adults and adolescent patients, since from the 
perspective of drug metabolism, patients 12 years or older can be considered adults. In the case of 
selpercatinib, it is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, which by the age of 12 may have reached its adult 
level of expression. With regard to study LOXO-RET-18036 (LIBRETTO-121), in paediatric patients (6 
to 21 years), the planned initial dose (i.e. 92 mg/m2 BID) is intended to result in a similar exposure 
than the 160 mg/m2 in adults. The Applicant indicated that any new information, from study 
LIBRETTO-121 regarding dosing in younger patients will be applied if required.  
Of these patients, 2 had a starting dose of 160 mg BID whereas 1 patient had a starting dose of 80 mg 
BID and escalated to 160 mg BID. Two patients achieved a partial response and 1 had a stable disease 
lasting longer than 16 weeks. All these 3 patients remain on treatment as of the cut-off date.

Differences in exposure for extreme body weights do not seem to have a worrying impact in safety 
based on data provided but the limited number of <50 kg patients included and duration of exposure 
make it hard to reach any final conclusion about dose adjustment recommendation in these low weight 
patients. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
The main limitations in relation to the efficacy of selpercatinib are related to the uncontrolled nature of 
the pivotal evidence which hampers the assessment of the time-to-event endpoints and the limited 
number of patients included. 
To confirm the benefits observed in study LIBRETTO-001 and in order to fulfil a CMA, a global phase 3 
study is projected to complete enrolment by August 2023 (LIBRETTO 531 in RET-mutant MTC).  
This phase 3 study will be conducted in patients with previously untreated RET-mutant MTC. As of 01 
March 2022, the study is approximately 64% enrolled (161 of the planned initial 250 patients).  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The updated efficacy results from the ongoing phase 1/2 study LIBRETTO-001 in patients previously 
treated with cabozantinib and/or vandetanib are consistent with those provided in the original 
submission. For Cab/Van naïve patients (MTC:-Cab/-Van), the obtained ORR of 82% could be 
considered clinically meaningful. Although immature, K-M estimates for DOR, PFS and OS at several 
time-points are promising.  
Since efficacy results are based on a single clinical trial with immature time-to-event endpoints, data 
corresponding to a longer follow-up are still required as well as efficacy results from the ongoing phase 
3 study LIBRETTO-531 (the SOB study related to the CMA). 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
- In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of selpercatinib in the treatment of patients with 
RET fusion-positive NSCLC, RET fusion -positive thyroid cancer and RET mutant MTC, the MAH should 
submit the final study report from the pivotal study LIBRETTO-001 by 31 December 2023 
- In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of selpercatinib in the treatment of patients with 
RET-mutant MTC, the MAH should submit the clinical study report of the Phase 3 study J2G-MC-JZJB 
(LIBRETTO-531) comparing selpercatinib to physician’s choice of cabozantinib or vandetanib in patients 
with progressive, advanced, kinase inhibitor-naive, RET-mutant MTC. The CSR should be submitted by 
30 September 2025. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety data are available from a total of 796 patients in the LIBRETTO 001 study which is still ongoing. 
Of  these,  319  (~  49%)  had  RET-mutant  MTC  and  includes  142  (44.5%)  who  were  cabozantinib  and 
vandetinib naive. All patients in the ITT population received at least one dose of selpercatinib as of the 
data cut-off date of 15 June 2021.

Table 24. Description of Safety Analysis Sets (data Cut-off: 15 June 2021) 
Patient exposure 
Through 15 June 2021, a total of 796 patients have  been treated with selpercatinib at doses ranging 
from  20  mg  QD  to  240  mg  BID,  most  patients  (96%  )  received  at  least  1  dose  of  the  selpercatinib 
recommended dose (Phase 2 dose) of 160 mg BID. 
Five hundred thirty-nine (539) patients (68%) were still on study, of which 462 patients (58%, including 
118 patients with MTC: -Cab/-Van) were still receiving selpercatinib and 77 patients (10%, including 10 
patients with MTC: -Cab/-Van) were in follow-up, but off treatment. 
The most common reason for treatment discontinuation in the Overall  Safety  Population was disease 
progression (23%), followed by AE (8%). 
The  most  common  reason  for  treatment  discontinuation  in  the  MTC  Safety  Population  was  disease 
progression (12, 5%), followed by AE (6.9%). 
In the MTC Safety Population, 96.6% patients received at least 1 dose of selpercatinib 160 mg BID and 
90% patients had a selpercatinib starting dose of 160 mg.

Table 25: Treatment and study disposition (MTC Safety Population) 
The median time on treatment was 21.3 and 24.4 months, respectively, for the Overall Safety Population 
and MTC Safety Population. 
The most reported dose modification was dose  withheld (72.9% in the Overall Safety Population  and 
71.5% in the MTC Safety Population) primarily attributed to adverse events (AEs) (40.8% in the Overall 
Safety Population and 36.4% in the MTC Safety Population).

Hypertension 
The incidence of any-grade hypertension was reported in similar proportion in both the Overall Safety 
Population (41%) and MTC safety population (44.8%), 20% and 22% were Grade ≥3 in the Overall and 
MTC  Safety  Population,  respectively.  Patients  with  a  documented  history  of  hypertension  displayed  a

respectively). This trend is the same in the MTC safety population (30.9% versus 15.3, respectively). 
Hypersensitivity 
The overall incidence of any-grade hypersensitivity was 5.9% in the Overall Safety Population. A total of 
15 patients (1.9%) in the Overall Safety and 3 patients (0.9%) in the MTC Safety Population had Grade 
3 hypersensitivity 
QT prolongation 
Electrocardiogram QT prolonged was reported as a TEAE in similar proportion of the patients in both the 
Overall  (21.1%)  and  MTC  (22.9%)  Safety  Populations.  Most  patients  had  TEAEs  of  Grade  1  or  2  in 
severity in both the Overall Safety (16.3%) and MTC safety (18.8%) population. 
Laboratory findings 
The  highest  incidence  of  any  grade  treatment-emergent  laboratory  abnormality  across  haematology 
parameters  was  reported  for  decreased  lymphocyte  count  (51.8%  and  48.6%)  and  decreased  white 
blood cell count (48.7% and 41.8%) in both the Overall Safety Population and the MTC Safety Population, 
respectively.

decreased (58.7 and 66.4 %), and albumin decreased (55.7% and 53.3%) in both the Overall Safety 
Population and the MTC Safety Population, respectively. 
Safety in special populations 
There were no significant differences in the incidence of TEAEs among the age, sex, and race 
subgroups in the Overall Safety and MTC Safety Populations. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The most frequently reported TEAEs leading to doses being withheld in 5% or more patients in both the 
Overall  Safety  Population  and  Treatment-Naïve  Patients  (MTC:-Cab/-Van)  were  ALT  increase,  AST 
increased, diarrhoea, and hypertension. 
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  leading  to  a  dose  reduction  in  5%  or  more  patients  in  both  the 
Overall Safety Population and Treatment-Naïve Patients (MTC:-Cab/-Van) were ALT and AST increase. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of selpercatinib in 4 or more 
patients in the Overall Safety Population were ALT increased, fatigue, AST increase, and sepsis. All other 
AEs occurred in less than 4 patients. In Treatment-Naïve Patients (MTC:-Cab/-Van) no events leading to 
permanent discontinuation of selpercatinib were reported in more than 1 patient. 
Post marketing experience 
As of November 2021, Selpercatinib was approved in 36 countries including those in the EU, the US and 
Switzerland for treatment of patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC, RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer 
and  RET-mutant  medullary  thyroid  cancer.  Specific  patient  populations  and  dosing  guidance  vary  by 
country.  Cumulatively,  up  to  the  08  November  2021,  an  estimated  1000  patients  were  exposed  to 
selpercatinib worldwide. The data reported from the post marketing setting, is generally consistent with 
the  known  safety  profile  of  selpercatinib.  Most  events  were  reported  as  non-serious  and  the  most 
frequently reported events were recognised ADRs for selpercatinib or clinically expected in the target 
indication.  Overall,  no  new  significant  safety  information  has  been  identified  from  post  marketing 
sources. The periodic safety update report/periodic benefit-risk evaluation report with a data lock of 08 
November 2021 confirmed and supported the previously established favourable benefit-risk profile for 
selpercatinib in the currently approved indications. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety  was  evaluated  in  patients  in  the  Overall  Safety  Population  (N=796)  and  in  the  MTC  Safety 
Population (N=319) who received at least 1 dose of selpercatinib as of the data cut-off date of 15 June 
2021. 
In terms of exposure, the median time on treatment was 21.29 and 24.4 months, respectively, for the 
Overall Safety Population and MTC Safety Population. In the Treatment-Naïve Population (n=142), the 
median treatment duration is 25.3 months (range: 0.2 to 44.4 months) and 83.8% of patients were on 
treatment for at least 24 months. 
The median relative dose intensity was similar for the Overall Safety Population (94.6%) and the MTC 
Safety Population (95.0%). 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/681951/2022  
Page 54/66 
 
 
 
The most reported dose modification was dose  withheld (72.9% in the Overall Safety Population  and 
71.5% in the MTC Safety Population) primarily attributed to adverse events (AEs) (40.8% in the Overall 
Safety Population and 36.4% in the MTC Safety Population). 
The types and incidence rates of AEs leading to doses being withheld, dose reductions, and treatment 
discontinuation  were  consistent  between  the  Overall  Safety  Population  and  Treatment-Naïve  Patients 
(MTC -Cab/-Van). 
The most frequent TEAEs occurring in 30% or more patients in both the Overall Safety Population and 
Treatment-Naïve Patients (MTC -Cab/-Van) were oedema, and dry mouth. 
The most frequent Grade ≥3 TEAEs reported in 5% or more patients in both the Overall Safety Population 
and Treatment-Naïve Patients (MTC -Cab/-Van) were hypertension, followed by ALT increased and AST 
increased.  
The most frequent TESAEs reported in 2% or more patients both in the  Overall Safety Population and 
Treatment-Naïve Patients (MTC -Cab/-Van) were pneumonia and abdominal pain. 
Fatal TEAEs were reported in 21 patients at the initial MAA compared with 45 patients at the 15 June 
2021 data cut-off. In Treatment-Naïve Patients, a fatal (Grade 5) TEAE was experienced by a total of 8 
patients (5.6%), including 3 patients who died of AE within 28 days of the last dose of selpercatinib. 
None in the MTC Safety Population were reported by the investigator as treatment-related. 
The  adverse  events  of  special  interest  (AESIs)  analysed  did  not  change  compared  to  those  reported 
previously. 
The safety profile observed in the data from the 15 June 2021 cut-off remains consistent with previously 
reported  data.  No  new  ADRs  or  AESIs  have  been  identified  since  initial  authorisation  and  the  safety 
profile  is  consistent  between  the  Treatment-Naïve  Patients  (MTC  -Cab/-Van)  and  the  Overall  Safety 
Population. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
Additional  safety  data  including  comparative  data  will  be  provided  as  part  of  the  studies  imposed  as 
specific obligations. Longer follow-up from LIBRETTO-001 will allow a better characterisation of the long-
term safety and the randomised phase 3 study LIBRETTO-531 will allow a contextualisation of the safety 
data compared to the control arm. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The overall safety profile of selpercatinib in Treatment-Naïve Patients (MTC -Cab/-Van) is consistent with 
that of the Overall Safety Population. The updated results provided in this analysis show the safety profile 
of selpercatinib is consistent with that reported previously, even with longer duration of treatment. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
- In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of selpercatinib in the treatment of patients with 
RET fusion-positive NSCLC, RET fusion -positive thyroid cancer and RET mutant MTC, the MAH should 
submit the final study report from the pivotal study LIBRETTO-001 by 31 December 2023 
- In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of selpercatinib in the treatment of patients with 
RET-mutant MTC, the MAH should submit the clinical study report of the Phase 3 study J2G-MC-JZJB 
(LIBRETTO-531) comparing selpercatinib to physician’s choice of cabozantinib or vandetanib in patients

with progressive, advanced, kinase inhibitor-naive, RET-mutant MTC. The CSR should be submitted by 
30 September 2025.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The proposed revisions do not significantly affect the overall readability. It is not considered necessary 
to conduct consultation with target patient groups further to that performed for the initial MAA. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The  MAH  is  seeking  an  extension  of  indication  for  Retsevmo  (selpercatinib)  as  monotherapy  for  the 
treatment of adults and adolescents 12 years and older with advanced RET-mutant medullary thyroid 
cancer (MTC) not previously treated with a RET inhibitor. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
No selective agents are approved specifically for patients with RET-mutant MTC as a first-line therapy; 
after first-line therapy, selpercatinib is the only selective RET inhibitor approved in the EU. 
The  unselective  MKIs  vandetanib  and  cabozantinib  are  approved  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic MTCs, in adults and including children over the age of 5 in 
the case of vandetanib, irrespective of the RET status and irrespective of prior treatment.

Table 30: Response and Survival Rates of Current Standard of Care in MTC 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Clinical  safety  and  efficacy  of  selpercatinib  in  treatment-naive  patients  with  advanced  RET-mutant 
medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) are based on analyses of interim data from LIBRETTO-001 (LOXO-RET-
17001). 
LIBRETTO-001 is a global, multi-cohort, open-label, phase 1/2 study in adult and adolescent patients 
with advanced RET-altered tumours. The phase 2 portion evaluates efficacy in cohorts based on tumour 
type, type of RET alteration, and prior treatment. The primary objective was to determine ORR by IRC 
assessment according to RECIST 1.1. DOR, PFS and OS were secondary endpoints. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
At the data cut-off 15 June 2021, 142 MTC:-Cab/-Van patients were efficacy evaluable and the ORR 
was 81.0% (95% CI: 73.6, 87.1) by IRC and 77.5% (95% CI: 69.7, 84.0) by investigator assessment. 
22 patients (15.5%) exhibited a confirmed CR and 93 patients (65.5%) experienced PR.  
The median TTR was 3.45 months by IRC and 3.53 by investigator. The rate of DoR at 12 months was 
91.9% (95% CI: 85.0, 95.7); at 24 months, 83.7% (95% CI: 73.0, 90.4). Median DoR was not 
reached with a median follow-up of 20.3 months (95% CI: 17.7, 22.1) by IRC and 21.2 months (95% 
CI: 17.5, 23.1) by investigator. 
The median PFS (IRC) was not reached, with 17% events observed and median follow-up of 24.5 
months (95% CI: 22.0, 25.2). The rate of PFS at 12 months was 91.0% (95% CI: 84.7, 94.8), at 24 
months 81.1% (95% CI: 72.4, 87.3). 
Median OS was not reached at the time of the DCO (5.6% of events observed). The rate of OS at 12 
months was 99.3% (95% CI: 94.9, 99.9), at 24 months was 95.0% (95% CI: 89.0, 97.7), and at 36 
months was 89.7% (95% CI: 76.2, 95.8). Efficacy of selpercatinib seems consistent across most 
important subgroups.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The uncertainties and limitations are mainly related to the uncontrolled nature of the pivotal trial which 
hampers the interpretation of the time-to-event endpoints (PFS, OS).  
Even though updated efficacy data have been provided for RET mutant MTC patients regardless of line 
therapy, the median DOR, OS and PFS continued to be not estimable. The KM estimates for time-to-
event endpoints (PFS, OS) seem promising, but they remain immature. 
These limitations will be addressed post authorisation with the submission of updated data and longer 
follow-up from the LIBRETTO-001 study and the conduct of LIBRETTO-531, a randomised phase III trial 
in patients with progressive, advanced, kinase inhibitor-naive, RET-mutant MTC.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Safety data are available from a total of 796 patients in the LIBRETTO-001 study. 
Safety  was  evaluated  in  patients  in  the  Overall  Safety  Population  (N=796)  and  in  the  MTC  Safety 
Population (N=319) who received at least 1 dose of selpercatinib as of the data cut-off date of 15 June 
2021. 
In terms of exposure, the median time on treatment was 21.29 and 24.4 months, respectively, for the 
Overall Safety Population and MTC Safety Population. In the Treatment-Naïve Population (n=142), the 
median treatment duration is 25.3 months (range: 0.2 to 44.4 months) and 83.8% of patients were on 
treatment for at least 24 months. 
The median relative dose intensity was similar for the Overall Safety Population (94.6%) and the MTC 
Safety Population (95.0%). 
The most reported dose modification was dose  withheld (72.9% in the Overall Safety Population  and 
71.5% in the MTC Safety Population) primarily attributed to adverse events (AEs) (40.8% in the Overall 
Safety Population and 36.4% in the MTC Safety Population). 
The types and incidence rates of AEs leading to doses being withheld, dose reductions, and treatment 
discontinuation  were  consistent  between  the  Overall  Safety  Population  and  Treatment-Naïve  Patients 
(MTC -Cab/-Van). 
The most frequent TEAEs occurring in 30% or more patients in both the Overall Safety Population and 
Treatment-Naïve Patients (MTC -Cab/-Van) were oedema, and dry mouth. 
The most frequent Grade ≥3 TEAEs reported in 5% or more patients in both the Overall Safety Population 
and Treatment-Naïve Patients (MTC -Cab/-Van) were hypertension, followed by ALT increased and AST 
increased.  
The most frequent TESAEs reported in 2% or more patients both in the Overall Safety Population and 
Treatment-Naïve Patients (MTC -Cab/-Van) were pneumonia and abdominal pain. 
Fatal TEAEs were reported in 21 patients at the initial MAA compared with 45 patients at the 15 June 
2021 data cut-off. In Treatment-Naïve Patients, a fatal (Grade 5) TEAE was experienced by a total of 8 
patients (5.6%), including 3 patients who died of AE within 28 days of the last dose of selpercatinib. 
None in the MTC Safety Population were reported by the investigator as treatment-related. 
The  adverse  events  of  special  interest  (AESIs)  analysed  did  not  change  compared  to  those  reported 
previously.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Data supporting this application are based on one single-arm trial (LIBRETTO-001), which make 
interpretation of time to event endpoints and any potential long-term benefit challenging. 
Nevertheless, this approach is acceptable in the context of a CMA for a product intended for a 
population with an unmet medical need as long as the effect observed in ORR is outstanding and 
durable.  
For cabozantinib and/or vandetanib naïve patients, clinical data from a larger and more mature dataset 
of patients are available (median follow-up time of 21 months). The obtained ORR of 81% is 
considered meaningful in patients with RET-mutant MTC in first-line setting. Median DOR was not 
reached at a median follow-up time of 20.27 months and K-M estimates at landmark time points for 
PFS and OS allow to anticipate lasting benefits from treatment. The ORR benefit for the intended 
population was observed with selpercatinib regardless of the line of therapy. 
Although, other approved front-line therapies with established benefit exist, efficacy with selpercatinib 
is considered compelling. Indirect comparisons of available results (KM estimates of PFS and OS) with 
selpercatinib against those reported with MKIs cabozantinib and vandetinib seem promising and give 
some support to the benefit of the treatment in the first line. The ORRs for selpercatinib are higher 
than those reported for cabozantinib and vandetinib. Although PFS and OS data are not yet mature, 
the median follow-up of 24.54 and 26.25 months, respectively, provide robust data of the 24 months 
PFS and OS landmark rates. The 24-month PFS landmark rate (with a PFS rate of 81.1% [95% CI: 
72.4, 87.3]) exceeds median PFS for the cabozantinib study. The median follow-up time has not yet 
exceeded the estimated 30.5 months median PFS in the vandetinib study; however, the PFS rate for 
selpercatinib at 30 months was 79.7% (95% CI: 70.6, 86.3). 
The safety profile observed in the data from the 15 June 2021 cut-off remains consistent with previously 
reported  data.  No  new  ADRs  or  AESIs  have  been  identified  since  initial  authorisation  and  the  safety 
profile is consistent between the Treatment-Naïve Patients and the Overall Safety Population. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The provided results from LIBRETTO-001 have shown efficacy in term of tumour shrinkage. Responses 
seem durable and independent of treatment line. However, given the remaining uncertainties mostly 
related to the uncontrolled design of the pivotal study, comparative data from the phase 3 study 
(LIBRETTO-531 or J2G-MC-JZJB) together with further follow-up data from the pivotal trial LIBRETTO-
001 are required as confirmatory evidence (SOBs). 
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
As comprehensive data on the product are also not available in the first-line treatment of RET mutant 
MTC, a conditional marketing authorisation was requested by the applicant for this extension of 
indication. The new indication for this product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 concerning conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-
threatening disease. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
CHMP group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/681951/2022  
Page 62/66 
 
 
 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed above.  
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. The applicant will 
provide confirmatory data from the ongoing LIBRETTO-531 study, an open-label randomised 
phase 3 study comparing selpercatinib to physician’s choice of cabozantinib or vandetanib in 
patients with progressive, advanced, kinase inhibitor-naive, RET-mutant MTC (J2G-MC-JZJB). 
This study is currently recruiting and the submission of the final clinical study report (CSR) is 
expected by 30 September 2025. As of 01 March 2022, the study is approximately 64% 
enrolled (161 of the planned initial 250 patients) with approximately 60% of patients coming 
from EU countries. An extension of indication to include the first-line treatment of patients with 
MTC is not expected to have an impact on study recruitment. Results of the LIBRETTO-531 
study are intended to provide a comprehensive data package and potentially convert the 
conditional MA into a full MA. There are currently supply constraints related to sourcing of 
vandetanib (Caprelsa) in the EU due to limited stock availability from the MAH. At this time, 
there has been no impact to patient treatment, nor is it anticipated that treatment will be 
impacted (even though amendments to the CTA have been submitted to mitigate any potential 
impact). 
•  Unmet medical need will be addressed, as selpercatinib is a selective treatment showing a 
response rate of such a magnitude that a clinical benefit would be expected compared to first 
line available unselective MKI options, vandetanib and cabozantinib. A major therapeutic 
advantage over existing therapies can therefore be concluded. In addition, selpercatinib has a 
differential safety profile compared to existing therapies with a significantly lower rate of TEAEs 
leading to permanent treatment discontinuation.  
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the 
fact that additional data are still required. Given the positive benefit/risk and the unmet 
medical need in the applied indication as described above, this is considered fulfilled. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Retsevmo for the treatment of adults and adolescents 12 years and older with 
advanced RET mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) not previously treated with a RET inhibitor is 
positive subject to the specific obligations and conditions imposed in order to obtain further clinical 
data to generate a comprehensive clinical data set and inform the long-term efficacy and safety profile 
of the product in this new indication.

Extension of indication to include first-line treatment of advanced RET-mutant medullary thyroid 
cancer (MTC) in adults and adolescents 12 years and older based on interim results from Study 
LIBRETTO-001 (LOXO-RET-17001) on the clinical safety and efficacy of selpercatinib in patients with 
RET-mutant MTC who are cabozantinib and vandetanib treatment-naïve (MTC:-Cab/-Van). LIBRETTO-
001 is a global, multicohort, open-label, Phase 1/2 study in adult and adolescent patients with 
advanced RET-altered tumours.  As a consequence, sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The 
Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.  Version 3.0 of the RMP has also been submitted.   
As part of the application the MAH is requesting a 1-year extension of the market protection. 
The application also includes an updated Phase II Environmental Risk Assessment in order to reflect 
the patient population as per the approved indication. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the group of variations, amendments to Annexes I, IIIB and to the 
Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
There are no new conditions but this recommendation is subject to the following specific obligations in

patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC, RET fusion -positive thyroid cancer and RET 
mutant MTC, the MAH should submit the final study report from the pivotal study 
LIBRETTO-001 by  
In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of selpercatinib in the treatment of 
28 February 2025 
patients with RET-mutant MTC, the MAH should submit the clinical study report of the 
Phase 3 study J2G-MC-JZJB (LIBRETTO-531) comparing selpercatinib to physician’s 
choice of cabozantinib or vandetanib in patients with progressive, advanced, kinase 
inhibitor-naive, RET-mutant MTC. The CSR should be submitted by  
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Retsevmo is not similar to Cometriq within the meaning 
of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers, that the new therapeutic indication 
brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 2).

2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2008 was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
cystic fibrosis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to be affecting 
approximately 1.2 in 10,000 persons in the Community, at the time the application was made; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life threatening due to respiratory failure and reduced 
overall survival; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
Community, justifications have been provided that N-(2,4-Di-tert-butyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)-1,4-
dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxamide may be of significant benefit to those affected by the 
condition . 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
type II variation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
This review is in the context of a variation of the existing MA of Kalydeco (Ivacaftor) (Type II C.I.6 
variation; EMEA/H/C/002494/II/0063/G) to include the Symkevi (tezacaftor/ivacaftor, TEZ/IVA) 
combination regimen indication as a consequence of the required dosing regimen for the Symkevi 
marketing authorization application.  
The therapeutic indication granted by the CHMP is “Symkevi is indicated in a combination regimen with 
ivacaftor 150 mg tablets for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 12 years and older 
who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation and 
have one of the following mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 
gene: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 
2789+5G→A, 3272‑26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T"  
The authorised therapeutic indication falls within the scope of the designated orphan indication 
“treatment of cystic fibrosis”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
As the proposed marketing authorization application foresees that Kalydeco would be used in a 
combination regimen with Symkevi, the intention to treat is based on the same clinical studies. 
Symkevi is a fixed dose combination of tezacaftor, a CFTR corrector that facilitates the cellular 
processing and trafficking of normal or multiple mutant forms of CFTR to increase the amount of 
functional CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface and ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator that potentiates 
the channel-open probability (or gating) of CFTR at the cell surface. Symkevi is currently under 
assessment for being marketed with ivacaftor (Kalydeco) in a combination regimen (Symkevi in the 
morning and ivacaftor in the afternoon).  
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/716663/2018 
Page 5/16 
 
 
 
 
Based on the CHMP assessment, the intention to treat the condition has been justified.  
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
There have been no changes in the seriousness of cystic fibrosis since the time of orphan designation, 
or the initial marketing authorisation of Kalydeco. The condition is chronically debilitating and life 
threatening due to the recurrent and resistant respiratory infections with development of 
bronchiectasis and terminal respiratory failure. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
There have been no significant changes in the prevalence of the condition since the time of orphan 
designation or the initial marketing authorisation of Kalydeco. The sponsor provided a comprehensive 
overview of the prevalence of cystic fibrosis in Europe, based on the European Cystic Fibrosis Society 
Patient Registry (ECFSPR) 2014 report. Based on the registry data and relative to the whole population 
of the EU the estimated prevalence of CF in the EEA (including Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) is 
0.93 per 10,000 individuals, corresponding to 47,975 cases. This estimate is acceptable. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
A number of medicinal products are authorised in Europe for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, including 
antibiotics and mucolytics. The mucolytics include N-acetylcysteine, which acts as a mucolytic by 
breaking down disulfide bonds in mucus found in CF patients, RhDNAse, Pulmozyme, and inhaled 
mannitol (Bronchitol). 
In addition bronchodilators and corticosteroids, both inhaled and systemic, are used as supportive 
treatment in patients with CF, even though they are not specifically authorised for this purpose and 
their efficacy in CF is very limited. Hypertonic saline solutions, administered as an aerosol, are also 
used to decrease mucus viscosity by changing the osmolarity of airway mucus.  
Antibiotics approved for use in CF in Europe include: Tobramycin, Colistin, aztreonam lysine, and 
levofloxacin.  
The CFTR potentiator Kalydeco (the product in questions for this procedure) is already authorised in 
the European Union for the treatment of patients with CF due to gating (class III) mutation in the CFTR 
gene (G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R) and in patients 
aged 18 years and older who have the R117H mutation. The fixed-dose combination of ivacaftor and 
lumacator (Orkambi) is authorized for patients homozygous for the F508D mutation. 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor based the discussion on significant benefit on a better efficacy of Symkevi (TEZ/IVA) plus 
Kalydeco (IVA)versus Orkambi (LUM/IVA) in patients homozygous of F508del, and on the clinical 
efficacy versus placebo on top of usual standard of care in F508del heterozygous patients with one of 
the mutations listed in the therapeutic indication (P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 
711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272‑26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T), for 
which no CFTR modulator was yet authorized. The sponsor defines the mutations listed in the 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/716663/2018 
Page 6/16 
 
 
 
 
therapeutic indication approved by the CHMP as ‘residual function’ (RF) mutations, based on the in 
vitro response to CFTR modulators, namely in this case TEZ/IVA. They encompass mutations belonging 
to different classes according to the current classification, and characterized by different severity and 
clinical course. In vitro, TEZ/IVA was considered effective when (1) a statistically significant increase in 
chloride transport over baseline normal; (2) a ≥10 pp increase in chloride transport over baseline as a 
percentage of normal CFTR; and (3) a statistically significant increase in chloride transport compared 
to treatment with ivacaftor alone were demonstrated.  
The sponsor based the significant benefit discussion on three main studies:  
•  Study 106 of Symkevi plus Kalydeco versus placebo in patients homozygous for F508del and the 
indirect comparison of this study with the Orkambi clinical studies 103 and 104;  
•  Study 108 in patients heterozygous for F508del and a residual function mutation, a three arms 
cross-over study comparing tezacaftor/ivacaftor with ivacaftor alone and with placebo; and  
•  Study 114 of Symkevi plus Kalydeco in patients who had to discontinue Orkambi due to respiratory 
side effects such as persistent cough and bronchospasm.  
• 
The sponsor also mentions study 110, a continuation of study 106 and 108, therefore enrolling 
both homozygous F508del/F508del and heterozygous F508del/residual function. Some data from 
this study are already available and the sponsor describes them but no conclusion from study 110 
is yet available.   
The whole significant benefit discussion is based on the use of Symkevi in combination with Kalydeco 
(here always mentioned as ‘Symkevi plus Kalydeco’) as this is the recommended treatment regimen 
and the regimen used in the pivotal studies for the approval of Symkevi and the MA extension of 
indication of Kalydeco to be used with Symkevi.  
Homozygous F508del 
Patients homozygous for F508 del (F/F) represent the largest CF patient population, and also the 
largest target population of the Symkevi plus Kalydeco MA application.  
The sponsor claimed significant benefit in F/F patients (12 years of age and older, as per authorized 
indication) versus Orkambi (LUM/IVA), the only CFTR modulator authorized for this patient population, 
based on better efficacy from indirect comparison of the Symkevi plus Kalydeco and Orkambi studies, 
and on the establishment of efficacy in patients that cannot tolerate Orkambi due to respiratory side-
effects in study 114 of Symkevi plus Klaydeco.  
Efficacy of Symkevi plus Kalydeco in relation to authorized medicinal products for the treatment of CF: 
The sponsor performed an indirect comparison between study 106 of the Symkevi development 
programme (the pivotal study supporting the MA in this indication; 248 patients) and two pooled 
Orkambi studies (LUM/IVA-103 and LUM/IVA-104; 369 patients).   
Study 106 was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of tezacaftor/ivacaftor plus ivacaftor (100 mg TEZ/150 mg IVA daily 
for 24 weeks + 150 mg IVA daily for 24 weeks). The primary endpoint was the absolute change from 
baseline in percentage predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) through Week 24, and secondary endpoints included: 
relative change in ppFEV1; number of pulmonary exacerbations; absolute change in BMI from 
baseline; and absolute change in CFQ-R Respiratory Domain Score. Studies LUM/IVA-103 and 
LUM/IVA-104 were Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of Orkambi (LUM/IVA) versus placebo. The Orkambi dose chosen for 
the indirect comparison with study 106 was the current recommended therapeutic dose.

The difference in percentage predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) changes from baseline of Orkambi and Symkevi 
plus Kalydeco was established by the indirect comparison at 2.3 percentage points, as shown in table 
1. The difference at the week 24 (48 weeks of total treatment) extension visit was smaller with 0.7 
percentage points [2.7 for Orkambi (95% CI 1.8, 3.6) and 3.4 for Symkevi/Kalydeco (95% CI 2.3, 
4.54)] (data not shown). It was noted that the placebo groups of the two studies had a different 
ppFEV1 decline: -0.4 in the Orkambi placebo group vs. -1.3 in the Symkevi plus Kalydeco placebo 
group, which further reduces the actual difference between Symkevi and Orkambi. The placebo values 
used for the ppFEV1 comparison took into account the values measured at each visit (shown in table 3) 
in the MMRM analysis used for the indirect comparison.

The MMRM methodology in the table above allows correcting for inter-visit variability in FEV1 values in 
the active and placebo group, therefore increasing the robustness of the comparison. Nevertheless the 
difference between the placebo groups remain and the final difference of 2.3% in FEV1 is difficult to 
interpret from a point of view of clinical relevance. This is because the available literature describes 
that yearly decline in ppFEV1 levels are influenced by a number of factors, including age cohort and 
clinical factors such as pancreatic insufficiency, baseline FEV1, exacerbation, and Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa infection/colonization among others, and there is no consensus regarding a minimally 
clinically relevant difference in FEV1 decline for clinical trials and more in general therapeutic response 
purposes. 
From the available literature, rates of FEV1 decline in young adults with CF have been indeed shown to 
diminish with successive birth cohorts, and patients infected with Pseudomonas traditionally had a 
greater average decline in FEV(1) (-1.6% v -1.1%) (Que, 2006). Konstan et al (2010) report mean 
rates of FEV1 change in a population of CF > 6 years and with baseline FEV1 above 70%. Median age 
specific year to year changes in FEV1 % predicted (Liou, 2010) vary from close to 0% up to 4% during 
adolescence and young adulthood. One important aspect when considering yearly FEV1 changes is also 
the rather large short-term variability identified by most authors. In a Danish registry study (Taylor-
Robinson 2012) short-term variability of FEV1 was 6.3%, and during an EMA expert workshop on 
endpoints for CF, held in 2012, it was stated that although the median changes are low, the variability 
of ppFEV1 is high, with 5 to 20% of the population having changes more than 10% predicted. A mean 
(SD) year to year change in FEV1 of only -1.22 (9.17) was reported in the Belgian population (De 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

Boeck, 2011). The MMRM analysis of the applicant of the different FEV1 time points is expected to 
correct for variability, and this was acknowledged.  
Because of all these reasons, in the EMA workshop report it was concluded, besides on the lack of 
consensus on the minimally clinical important difference in FEV1 in cystic fibrosis, that long-term 
stability of FEV1 is a relevant aspect when looking at treatment effect size. Since the observation 
period compared in the Orkambi and Symkevi plus Kalydeco studies is of 24 weeks only, the sponsor 
modelled the gain in median predicted survival based on the Symkevi plus Kalydeco trial data and 
compared it to that of Orkambi, showing an estimated gain of median predicted survival (of additional 
0.83 years with Symkevi plus Kalydeco versus Orkambi. It was noted however that in the model the 
treatment effect of Symkevi plus Kalydeco was assumed to impact three out of the 9 factors 
influencing survival in CF , therefore uncertainty remains around the interpretation of the results. The 
COMP also noted that there were no relevant differences between Orkambi and the combination 
Symkevi plus Kalydeco in most secondary endpoints, including exacerbations, as shown in table 2.  
Considering all the above, the COMP acknowledged that there are slightly better results in FEV1 with 
Symkevi plus Kalydeco than with Orkambi but this was not considered to be a significant benefit.  This 
because the effect size of the difference in ppFEV1 decline between Symkevi plus Kalydeco and 
Orkambi was small and considered not clinically relevant, taking into account the different FEV1 decline 
described in different studies, the lack of consensus in the scientific community on the minimum 
clinically relevant difference in FEV1 in CF studies, and the lack of difference in clinically relevant 
secondary endpoints such as exacerbations.   
The significant benefit versus the current non-CFTR modulator standard of care (SoC), including 
bronchodilators, mucolytics and antibiotics, was considered justified based on the fact that all Symkevi 
plus Kalydeco study arms, including placebo, continued to receive their existing SoC non-modulator 
therapies and that subgroup analyses showed improvement in ppFEV1 in all subgroups regardless of 
concomitant CF medication use, as shown in Figure 1

Efficacy and tolerability of Symkevi plus Kalydeco in patients who cannot tolerate Orkambi: 
The  sponsor  also  claimed  that  Symkevi  was  better  tolerated  than  Orkambi  and  to  support  this  they 
presented new data from study 114 as a response to the list of questions. This was a study of Symkevi 
plus Kalydeco in patients who had to discontinue Orkambi due to respiratory side effects such as chest 
discomfort, dyspnea, and respiration abnormal (chest tightness). In the SmPC, the use of Orkambi is 
associated  with  increased  risk  of  transient  respiratory  events  such  as  chest  discomfort,dyspnoea  and 
respiration abnormal (chest tightness) at the start of dosing, more frequently in patients with a ppFEV1 
less than 40 %, i.e. in the most severe patients, based on the results from the clinical trials. In real-life, 
routine  safety  reporting  systems  (spontaneous  and  solicited  reports),  and  recent  published  literature 
(2016 to date) have shown discontinuation rates of Orkambi in range between 17 to 40% due to the 
same side-effects reported in the clinical studies, mainly respiratory AEs (chest discomfort , dyspnoea, 
and  respiration  abnormal  (chest  tightness  ),  and  mainly  in  patients  with  low  FEV1  (below  40% 
predicted).  
Study 114 was a phase 3b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial to assess 
the safety and efficacy of Symkevi plus Kalydeco (TEZ/IVA) in patients who discontinued Orkambi due 
to a Respiratory adverse event of Special Interest (RAESI). Target sample size was 90 subjects with 
ppFEV1 at screening visit ≥25% and ≤90%. The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of 
respiratory adverse events and the key secondary efficacy endpoints included the absolute change in 
ppFEV1 from baseline to the average of Day 28 and 56. Table 4 shows the rates of respiratory adverse 
events in the placebo and treated group in study 114.  
Table 4.  Rates of respiratory adverse events in the placebo and treated group in study 114. 
The results presented at table 4 showed that Symkevi plus Kalydeco was well tolerated in patients who 
discontinued Orkambi, with a rate of respiratory adverse events comparable to that of the placebo 
group (table 4). The ppFEV1 improvement was similar to the one described in the Orkambi studies, as 
shown in table 5; therefore based on the results from the available studies Symkevi plus Kalydeco 
appears better tolerated than Orkambi, with comparable efficacy.

Heterozygous F508del and homozygous F508del/residual function (F/RF) 
The group of Heterozygous F508del/RF mutations approved by the CHMP included the following 
mutations: P67L, R117C, L206W, R352Q, A455E, D579G, 711+3A→G, S945L, S977F, R1070W, 
D1152H, 2789+5G→A, 3272‑26A→G, and 3849+10kbC→T. No CFTR modulator medicinal product is 
authorized in the European Union for these mutations (Kalydeco is approved in the US).  
The significant benefit in F/RF mutations was based on the efficacy results of study 108, three arms 
cross-over study comparing TEZ/IVA with IVA alone and with placebo. The study was performed on a 
larger number of residual function mutations than those authorized by the CHMP. The efficacy results 
of ppFEV1 of the single mutations included in the authorized indication are shown in table 6 below.

E831X and D110H; therefore, these mutations are not included in this table. The 1 subject with E831X was not 
randomized to the TEZ/IVA arm, and the 1 subject with D110H did not have ppFEV1 improvement during TEZ/IVA 
treatment. 
In general, most mutations included in the therapeutic indications of Symkevi plus Kalydeco are rare, 
therefore their phenotype is not very well known. Nevertheless from the data in the table above it can 
be seen that, in spite of the variability of effect within these mutations, the overall FEV1 results appear 
favourable for all mutations, ranging from of 2.9 to 10.1% improvement in ppFEV1. These results were 
on top of the usual standard of care treatment and it was considered that the improvement in ppFEV1 
in these mutations (6.9% on average), as well as the efficacy on the secondary endpoints were 
sufficient to support a significant benefit based on efficacy.  
Conclusions 
The COMP expressed a positive opinion based on a majority vote, on the grounds that study 114 
showed that patients who had to discontinue Orkambi due to respiratory adverse events could be 
treated with Symkevi plus Kalydeco. Based on literature and post-marketing data, approximately 17 to 
40% of patients have to discontinue Orkambi due to respiratory adverse events. In study 114 in 
patients who discontinued Orkambi, the combination of Symkevi plus Kalydeco was well tolerated, with 
a frequency of respiratory adverse events similar to placebo, and a ppFEV1 improvement similar to the 
one described in the Orkambi studies. The COMP therefore was of the opinion that Symkevi plus 
Kalydeco can be considered of significant benefit for the homozygous F508del patient population that 
cannot tolerate Orkambi. 
Regarding the claim of better efficacy of Symkevi plus Kalydeco versus Orkambi in the F508del 
homozygouspopulation, although a trend towards a better ppFEV1 was noted in the indirect 
comparison provided by the sponsor, the COMP considered that the difference of 2.3% ppFEV1 
between Symkevi plus Kalydeco versus Orkambi could not be considered clinically relevant. This is 
because of lack of consensus in the scientific community on the minimum clinically relevant difference 
in FEV1, as well as the variability in FEV1 measurements in CF reported in the literature. The indirect 
comparison also did not show difference in key secondary endpoints such as exacerbations.  The COMP 
was of the opinion that the results of the indirect comparison showed comparable efficacy of Symkevi 
plus Kalydeco with Orkambi, therefore a claim of superior efficacy was not considered justified.  
The significant benefit in the patients heterozygous for F508del and the residual function mutations 
listed in the approved therapeutic indication was considered justified based on clinical trial 108 showing 
efficacy in theseCF patients, for which so far no specific CFTR modulator treatments was authorized. In 
study 108, patients were treated with Symkevi plus Kalydeco on top of the current standard of care, 
including antibiotics, bronchodilators and mucolytics, and the results in the primary endpoint of 
ppFEV1, showing an average 6.9% improvement on top of the current treatment, were considered to 
justify the significant benefit in this patient population. 
Three Committee members expressed a divergent opinion, appended in this report.

4.  COMP position adopted on 13 September 2018 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of cystic fibrosis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded in to be less than 1 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to recurrent and resistant 
respiratory infections with development of bronchiectasis and terminal respiratory failure; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, the assumption that Kalydeco will be of significant benefit to those affected by the orphan 
condition is confirmed. This is based on clinical data showing the better tolerability of Symkevi in 
combination with Kalydeco in patients with homozygous F508del mutation who had to discontinue 
treatment with Orkambi, with comparable efficacy. The significant benefit of Symkevi in 
combination with Kalydeco in patients heterozygous for F508del and one of the residual function 
mutations included in the authorized therapeutic indication, for whom no specific CFTR modulator 
treatment is authorized, was considered justified based on clinical data showing improved efficacy 
versus placebo.   
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Kalydeco, N-(2,4-Di-tert-butyl-
5-hydroxyphenyl)-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxamide, ivacaftor, EU/3/08/556 for treatment of 
cystic fibrosis is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

Annex 
Divergent position expressed by some members of the COMP 
Although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, the assumption that Kalydeco may be of potential significant benefit to those affected by the 
orphan condition does not hold. 
• 
• 
The members were of the opinion that the clinical data in the homozygous F508del patient 
population, which represents the majority of the population covered by the therapeutic indication 
of this application, were not sufficient to demonstrate the significant benefit versus Orkambi, 
already authorised for the same patient population.  
In particular, it was considered that the sponsor did not sufficiently demonstrate that the difference 
of 2.3 in percentage predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) from the indirect 
comparison between Orkambi and the combination of Symkevi and Kalydeco is clinically relevant. 
This conclusion took into account the higher decline in the placebo group in the Symkevi plus 
Kalydeco studies compared to the Orkambi data presented by the applicant, not allowing to 
conclude on the true treatment difference of Symkevi and Kalydeco versus Orkambi. The 
conclusion is supported by the lack of significant difference in the secondary endpoints of 
exacerbations and symptoms score.  
• 
In relation to the claimed better safety of the combination of Symkevi and Kalydeco versus 
Orkambi, the members were of the opinion that the data presented by the sponsor were not 
sufficient to justify that the respiratory side-effects of Orkambi would be clinically relevant and 
persistent.

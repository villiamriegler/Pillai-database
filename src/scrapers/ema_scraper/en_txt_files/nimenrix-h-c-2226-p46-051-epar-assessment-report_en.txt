1.  Introduction 
On 7 December 2017, the MAH submitted  a paediatric clinical study report in accordance with Article 
46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. MEN-ACWY-TT-106 was an open-label, multi-centre 
study  to  evaluate  the  immunogenicity,  reactogenicity  and  safety  of  a  single  dose  of  MenACWY-TT 
vaccine (Nimenrix) administered at 6 years after vaccination at ~12-18 month of age with either Hib-
MenC-TT  vaccine  (Menitorix)  or  Hiberix  (PRP-T)  and  Meningitec  (MenC-CRM197).  The  study  included 
follow-up to evaluate antibody persistence at 2 years.  
The  MAH  (now  Pfizer  Limited)  has  reviewed  the  immunogenicity  and  safety  results  from  MEN-ACWY-
TT-106  and  has  concluded  that  the  data  do  not  change  the  benefit-risk  profile  of  Nimenrix.  The 
immunogenicity and safety outcomes are in line with the approved Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SmPC) for Nimenrix and therefore no updates to the SmPC are proposed. 
A short critical expert overview has been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
This submission provides the final CSR for the study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies 
Nimenrix was developed specifically for use in children and adults. The same formulation and dose is 
used across the full age range approved but the regimen (number of doses) differs by age (see SmPC). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The study was conducted at 7-8 centres in Australia between 2013 and 2017.  
2.3.2.  Clinical studies 
MenACWY-TT-106 
The primary objective of the study was: 
To  evaluate  the  immunogenicity  of  MenACWY-TT  vaccine  at  one  month  post-dose  in  terms  of  the 
percentages  with  a  vaccine  response  (see  definition  below)  based  on  rSBA-MenA,  rSBA-MenC,  rSBA-
MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY titres. 
Secondary immunogenicity objectives were: 
At one month post-dose: 
To evaluate the immunogenicity of a dose  of  Nimenrix  based on  percentages with rSBA-MenA, rSBA-
MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 and rSBA-MenY antibody titres ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:128 and on the GMTs; 
To evaluate the percentages with anti-TT concentrations ≥ 0.1 IU/mL and GMCs.

At 2 years post-dose: 
To evaluate antibody persistence based on percentages with rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135 
and rSBA-MenY titres ≥ 1:8 and ≥ 1:128 and on the GMTs. 
Eligible  subjects  were  to  be  aged  84  to  95  months  at  Visit  1  (see  figure  below)  and  had  to  have 
completed initial vaccination in study HIB-MENC-TT-016 as per protocol. Excluded were subjects with 
any  history  of  meningococcal  disease  and  previous  administration  of  any  non-study  meningococcal 
vaccine. There were 320 and 108 subjects in the HibMenC and Hib+MenCC groups, respectively, in the 
primary study and this open-label study planned to enrol ~240 subjects who were to be derived in a 
3:1 ratio from the two treatment groups in HIB-MENC-TT-016 as follows: 
HibMenC  group:  subjects  vaccinated  with  Hib-MenC-TT  +  Priorix  in  study  HIB-MENC-TT-016  and 
MenACWY-TT in study MENACWY-TT-106; 
Hib+MCC  group:  subjects  vaccinated  with  Meningitec  +  Hiberix  +  Priorix  in  study  Hib-MenC-TT-016 
and MenACWY-TT in study MENACWY-TT-106. 
The overall design is summarised in the figure. 
All subjects received  one  dose  of Nimenrix.  Blood samples were  taken  before vaccination and  at one 
and 24 months after vaccination. The intervals allowed between study visits at which vaccination and 
sampling were performed are shown below.

Results 
There  were  156  subjects  vaccinated  (see  below)  and  139  completed  the  study.  No  subject  was 
withdrawn due to a SAE or AE.  
Table 3 Number of subjects vaccinated, completed and withdrawn with reason for 
withdrawal (Total Vaccinated cohort) 
There were 139 included in ATP cohort for immunogenicity at Month 73 and 133 were included in the 
ATP cohort for persistence at Year 2. The mean age at the time of vaccination (month 73) was 7 years 
with 44.6% female and 55.4% male subjects.  
Vaccine  responses  exceeded  97%  for  all  meningococcal  serogroups  at  one  month  after  Nimenrix.  In 
each  case,  response  rates  were  lower  for  the  small  sub-groups  who  were  seropositive  at  pre-
vaccination.

Table 4 Vaccine response for rSBA-MenA, rSBA-MenC, rSBA-MenW-135, and rSBA-MenY 
antibody titres one month after booster vaccination (ATP cohort for immunogenicity at 
Month 73) 
At one month after Nimenrix, at least 97.1% of subjects had rSBA titres ≥ 1:8 for each serogroup. In 
each sub-group defined by prior  vaccination  history the highest  rSBA  GMTs  were  observed for MenW 
and the lowest for MenA. The comparisons between the sub-groups suggested slightly lower responses 
at one month and/or at 2 years in the Hib+MCC group but the 95% CI  overlapped.  At 2  years post-
dose the lowest percentages with ≥1:8 or ≥1:128 occurred for rSBA-MenA.

and rSBA-MenY titres equal to or above the cut-off values of 1:8 and 1:128 and GMTs 
(Adapted ATP cohort*) 
All subjects had anti-T antibody concentration ≥ 0.1 IU/mL at one month post-dose in both sub-groups 
defined by prior vaccination.

During  the  4-day  (Days  0-3)  post-dose  follow-up  period  for  solicited  local  symptoms,  pain  was 
reported  slightly  less  often  in  the  Hib+MCC  sub-group  but  rates  for  redness  and  swelling  were 
comparable. Grade 3 pain was reported by one subject (0.8%) in the HibMenC sub-group and Grade 3 
redness and swelling were reported by no more than 5.4% of subjects in the two sub-groups.

18.9%  in  the  HibMenC  and  Hib+MCC  sub-groups,  respectively,  while  Grade  3  unsolicited  AEs  were 
reported by 6.7% and 5.4% (see table below). Unsolicited AEs assessed by the investigator as causally 
related to vaccination were reported by 6.7% of subjects in the HibMenC sub-group, one of which was 
Grade 3.  
No  SAEs  or  AEs  leading  to  premature  discontinuation  of  study  vaccine  and/or  study  were  reported. 
Also, there were no NOCIs or pIMDs reported.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Children  enrolled  into  MEN-ACWY-TT-106  had  received  either  Menitorix  (MenC-T  and  PRP-T)  or 
Meningitec  (MenC-CRM197)  plus  Hiberix  (PRP-T)  at  about  one  year  of  age.  At  7  years  of  age,  the 
proportions still seropositive for MenC  were 19/104 (18%)  in the Menitorix group and 5/34 (15%) in 
the Meningitec group. Some of these Australian children had naturally acquired antibody to MenA, W or 
Y but pre-vaccination seropositive rates were mostly <20%.  
For each meningococcal serotype, all children who were seronegative at 7 years of age had a vaccine 
response (as defined in the protocol) after  a single dose of Nimenrix compared to about 80% for the 
smaller subsets of children who were seropositive at pre-vaccination.  
For  MenC,  102/104  primed  with  Menitorix  and  34/35  primed  with  Meningitec  had  rSBA-MenC  titres 
≥1:128 at one month after a dose of Nimenrix, with GMTs of 11,819 and 7420, respectively. The 95% 
CI around these GMTs overlapped and the imbalance in denominators should be noted. This difference 
in  rSBA-MenC  titres  persisted  at  2  years  post-dose,  when  the  percentages  with  titres  ≥1:128  were 
90% vs. 78.8% and the GMTs were 333 and 175 in respective priming groups. Whilst the differences 
between groups may not be clinically important (with 100% and 94% having titres at least 1:8 at 96 
months), the findings would be in keeping with observations made in several previous studies in which 
the  same  or  different  conjugates  were  used  for  priming  and  boosting.  It  should  be  noted  that  the 
MAH’s claim that Nimenrix “boosted” the rSBA-MenC titres cannot be verified based solely on the data 
presented.  However,  several  previous  studies  have  conclusively  demonstrated  the  ability  of  Nimenrix 
to boost rSBA-MenC titres regardless of the type of conjugate used for priming. 
For MenA, W and Y the percentages with rSBA titres at the 1:8 and 1:128 cut-offs and the GMTs at one 
month  and  at  2  years  post-dose  were  numerically  higher  in  the  group  primed  with  Menitorix  but  all 
95%  CI  overlapped.  It  is  difficult  to  comment  further  due  to  the  imbalance  in  numbers  and  the 
possibility that the results reflect just a few subjects with unusually low responses.  
Between one month and 2 years post-dose, the largest drops in percentages with rSBA titres at least 
1:8  or  1:128  were  observed  for  MenA.  This  finding  is  in  keeping  with  previous  studies  in  which  SBA 
titres  have declined more notably for MenA compared to  the other serogroups. The hSBA titres were 
not estimated in this study. If they had been it would be expected that they would show even larger 
drops in titres vs. MenA compared to the rSBA data. 
The safety profile of a single dose of Nimenrix at age 7 years was as expected. Although slightly higher 
total rates of solicited symptoms were reported in the sub-group primed with Menitorix, there was no 
excess of Grade 3 or related AEs in this sub-group.  
In conclusion 
There  results  reported  at  up  to  2  years  after  a  dose  of  Nimenrix  administered  to  7-year-old  children 
who  had  been  primed  with  a  meningococcal  serogroup  C  conjugate  vaccine  were  very  much  as 
expected. There were no issues raised by the safety data. There is no need to make any changes to 
the SmPC based on these results.

A Safety Topic Review was undertaken to evaluate reports 
Group of two type II variations to update sections 
4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC and section 4 of the PL 
II and PL 
of anaphylactic reactions in patients treated with 
pomalidomide, identified as a potential safety signal during 
routine signal detection activities. The SmPC has been

with information on anaphylactic reactions with a not 
known frequency and section 4.8 of SmPC with 
hypothyroidism following a safety review. This group 
also includes a Type IB Variation to update section 
6.6 of the SmPC in order to include 
recommendations to minimise the risk of unintended 
occupational exposures in healthcare professionals. 
The MAH has also proposed minor updates to section 
4.4 of the SmPC and Annex IID regarding the 
educational materials, prescribing and dispensing 
restrictions in order to provide more clarity about the 
recommended maximum duration of treatment.

updated to include information on anaphylactic reactions in 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 (with a not known frequency).  
Patients with a prior history of serious allergic reactions 
associated with thalidomide or lenalidomide, may be at 
higher risk of hypersensitivity and should not receive 
pomalidomide. Pomalidomide must be discontinued 
permanently for angioedema and anaphylactic reactions; 
widespread rash, high body temperature, enlarged lymph 
nodes and other body organs involvement (Drug Reaction 
with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms which is also 
known as DRESS or drug hypersensitivity syndrome, Toxic 
Epidermal Necrolysis or Stevens-Johnson Syndrome). 
Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of 
these reactions by their prescribers and should be told to 
seek medical attention immediately if they develop these 
symptoms. Patients with a history of severe rash associated 
with thalidomide treatment should not receive 
pomalidomide. 
Cases of hypothyroidism which may cause symptoms such 
as tiredness, lethargy, muscle weakness, slow heart rate, 
weight gain have been reported (SmPC section 4.4) as an 
uncommon side-effect. Optimal control of co-morbid 
conditions influencing thyroid function is recommended 
before start of treatment. Baseline and ongoing monitoring 
of thyroid function is recommended. 
Section 6.6 of the SmPC is updated in order to include a 
recommendation to wear disposable gloves to minimise the 
risk of unintended occupational exposures in healthcare 
professionals and caregivers. Women who are pregnant or 
suspect they may be pregnant should not handle the blister 
or capsule. 
The MAH has also proposed minor updates to section 4.4 of 
Page 5/17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the SmPC and Annex IID regarding the educational 
materials, prescribing and dispensing restrictions in order 
to provide more clarity about the recommended maximum 
duration of treatment and handling of the product. 
The SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 6.6 and Annex IID 
have been updated. The PL section 4 on allergic reaction 
and hypothroidism side effects has been updated 
accordingly.

patients with renal impairment. On haemodialysis days, 
patients should take their pomalidomide dose following 
haemodialysis. 
Pomalidomide doses as high as 50 mg as a single dose in 
healthy volunteers and 10 mg as once-daily multiple doses 
in multiple myeloma patients have been studied without 
reported serious adverse events related to overdose. 
Pomalidomide was removed by haemodialysis. 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that the 
pomalidomide pharmacokinetic parameters were not 
remarkably affected in renally impaired patients (defined by 
creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular filtration rate 
[eGFR]) compared to patients with normal renal function 
(CrCl ≥60 mL/minute). Mean normalized AUC exposure to 
pomalidomide was 98.2% with a 90% confidence interval

[77.4% to 120.6%] in moderate renal impairment patients 
(eGFR ≥30 to ≤45mL/minute/1.73 m2) compared to 
patients with normal renal function. Mean normalized AUC 
exposure to pomalidomide was 100.2% with a 90% 
confidence interval [79.7% to 127.0%] in severe renal 
impairment patients not requiring dialysis (CrCl <30 or 
eGFR <30 mL/minute/1.73 m2) compared to patients with 
normal renal function. Mean normalized AUC exposure to 
pomalidomide increased by 35.8% with a 90% CI [7.5% to 
70.0%] in severe renal impairment patients requiring 
dialysis (CrCl <30mL/minute requiring dialysis) compared 
to patients with normal renal function. The mean changes 
in exposure to pomalidomide in each of these renal 
impairment groups are not of a magnitude that require 
dosage adjustments.

As requested by CHMP at the time of the initial MA, the 
This is a grouped application of 3 Type II variations 
based on three clinical pharmacology study reports 
as follows:  
• Update of sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC to 
reflect clinical data from a hepatic impairment study 
(CC-4047-CP-009) on pomalidomide exposure in 
subjects with hepatic impairment 
• Update of sections 5.2 of the SmPC to reflect data 
from study CC-4047-CP-011 on the effect of food, 
smoking and elderly age on pomalidomide exposure 
MAH carried out a study in non-malignant subjects to 
evaluate pomalidomide use in patients with hepatic 
impairment. The final results of this study were submitted 
with this variation. Sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC were 
updated to reflect the clinical finding that hepatic 
impairment has a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
pomalidomide, thus no adjustment of the starting dose of 
pomalidomide is required for patients with hepatic 
impairment. 
In addition, the final study report of a study that evaluated 
Page 11/17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Update of sections 4.2, 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC (& 
PL) to reflect data from study CC-4047-CP-012 on 
co-administration of pomalidomide and CYP1A2 
inhibitors 
The MAH is taking this opportunity to propose four 
other minor modifications to the SmPC text that do 
not require assessment:  
a. Addition of the SmPC of instructions on 
discontinuation of pomalidomide therapy in section 
4.2 (text added for consistency with the same 
message already approved for the warnings section 
4.4 for angioedema/rash in the context of procedure 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010127/201408) 
b. Correction of data in SmPC section 4.5 and 5.2 
from the clinical pharmacology study CC-4047-CP-
008 to reflect AUC0–∞ instead of the AUC0–t 
c. Minor editorial change to SmPC 4.2 statement 
"There is no relevant use of Imnovid in children aged 
0-17 years for the indication of multiple myeloma." 
d. Replacing the term ‘patients’ with ‘subjects’, as 
per QRD template

the PK of pomalidomide administered with the CYP1A2 
inhibitor fluvoxamine was submitted. Fluvoxamine co-
administration resulted in an approximate doubling of 
exposure to pomalidomide.  Sections 4.2, 4.5 and 5.2 of 
the SmPC were updated to instruct that if strong inhibitors 
of CYP1A2 (e.g. ciprofloxacin, enoxacin and fluvoxamine) 
are co-administered with pomalidomide, the dose of 
pomalidomide should be reduced by 50%.  
Finally, the MAH conducted a study to evaluate the effects 
on pomalidomide PK of food in elderly people. This study 
also evaluated CYP1A2 induction by comparing PK 
parameters in smokers and non-smokers. The SmPC 
section 5.2 information that pomalidomide can be taken 
without regard to food intake only underwent minor 
amendments, and its spirit remained unchanged. Wording 
informing that administration of pomalidomide in smokers 
had no clinically relevant effect on exposure to 
pomalidomide compared to that exposure to pomalidomide 
observed in non-smokers was also added to Section 5.2.

Pancytopaenia and tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) have been 
ADRs ‘pancytopenia’ and ‘tumour lysis syndrome’. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In 
addition, editorial changes are included in Sections 
4.2, 5.3, 6.1 of the SmPC and the Package Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
seen in clinical trials and the post-marketing setting in 
association with pomalidomide use. A causal association 
between pomalidomide and these safety concerns seems 
likely. Although some cases of pancytopaenia were 
confounded in the setting of advanced multiple myeloma, 
supportive factors for pomalidomide causality include the 
temporal relationship, positive dechallenge followed by 
negative rechallenge with pomalidomide dose reduction and 
biological plausibility. With regards to TLS, there was a 
close relationship to the initiation of pomalidomide therapy 
and also biological plausibility. Only 1 report of TLS was 
confounded by concomitant carfilzomib therapy.  
Both reactions are listed for the related immunomodulatory 
compounds, lenalidomide and thalidomide.  
Pancytopaenia and tumour lysis syndrome were added to 
section 4.8 of the pomalidomide SmPC. 
This does not alter the benefit-risk balance of 
pomalidomide.

C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
pomalidomide as an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein using Caco-
2 cells. This study confirmed that pomalidomide is not an 
inhibitor of Pgp and therefore interactions with drugs that 
are substrates for this transporter would not be expected. 
Study CC-4047-DMPK-1653 was conducted in HEK293 cells 
(expressing OATP1B1 and OATP1B3) and control cells to 
evaluate the substrate potential of pomalidomide. The cell 
uptake studies demonstrate that pomalidomide is not a 
substrate for the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and 
OATP1B3, therefore interactions with drugs that are 
substrates or inhibitors of this transporter would not be 
expected. 
The final results of Study CC-4047-CP-008, a phase 1 
open-label study to evaluate the effect of CYP and Pgp 
inhibition and induction on the pharmacokinetics of 
pomalidomide in healthy male subjects, were also

submitted at the time of the initial marketing authorisation. 
Co-administration of a strong CYP3A4/Pgp inhibitor 
(ketoconazole) or CYP3A4 inducer (carbamazepine) with 
pomalidomide had no clinically relevant effect on mean 
exposure to pomalidomide. Co-administration of a strong 
CYP1A2 inhibitor (fluvoxamine) with pomalidomide in the 
presence of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor approximately 
doubled the mean exposure to pomalidomide. 
Pomalidomide was generally well tolerated by healthy 
subjects when administered as single 4-mg oral doses with 
multiple oral doses of ketoconazole, fluvoxamine, and/or 
carbamazepine. 
The current wording that ‘If strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 are 
co-administered with pomalidomide, patients should be 
closely monitored for the occurrence of side-effects’ is 
therefore judged to be sufficient and no changes are 
required to the product information.

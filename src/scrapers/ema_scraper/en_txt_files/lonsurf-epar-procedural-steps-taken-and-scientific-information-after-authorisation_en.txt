accordingly. The updated RMP version 8.0 has also 
been agreed. In addition, the Marketing authorisation 
holder (MAH) took the opportunity to bring the RMP 
in line with the template revision 2 of the good 
Pharmacovigilance practice module V guideline and

escalation is not permitted after it has been reduced. 
Administration is not recommended in patients with end 
stage renal disease as there are no data available for these 
patients.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for pembrolizumab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Cumulatively,  a  total  of  785  reports  containing  819  events  of  pneumonia  were  identified  in  the 
safety database. Of the 785 reports, 757 were considered serious and in 134 events the outcome 
was fatal. Given the seriousness of the event, the lack of imbalance observed in clinical trials against 
comparators (chemotherapy and ipilimumab) associated with the occurrence of pneumonia and the 
reflection  of  the  adverse  drug  reaction  (ADR)  in  the  SmPC  of  similar  products  (ipilimumab, 
nivolumab), a causal relationship between pembrolizumab and pneumonia cannot be excluded. The 
PRAC therefore recommends adding this possible ADR to the SmPC with a frequency of uncommon 
and to update the Package Leaflet accordingly.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pembrolizumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pembrolizumab is unchanged subject 
to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

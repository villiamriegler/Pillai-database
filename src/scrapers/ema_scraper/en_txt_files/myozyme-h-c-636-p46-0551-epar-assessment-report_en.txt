Introduction 
On  29.06.2015,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  MYOZYME,  in  accordance  with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure PAM 055. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
On 23.10.2015, the MAH submitted its response to CHMP comment on the Clinical Study Report (CSR) 
of the Advance study (AGLU09411). 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
The  MAH  stated  that  study  AGLU09411  "A  Phase  4,  open-label,  prospective  study  in  patients  with 
Pompe disease to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alglucosidase alfa produced at the 4000L scale" is 
a stand-alone study. 
The  MAH  confirmed  that  study  ADVANCE  (AGLU09411)  is  not  part  of  an  approved  Paediatric 
Investigation  Plan.  The  MAH  has  not  identified  any  new  paediatric  information  from  this  study  that 
would need to be added to the EU Product Information. 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Alglucosidase  alfa  has  been  developed  as  an  ERT  for  the  treatment  of  Pompe  disease.  Clinical  trials 
have  been  completed  in  patients  with  infantile  and  late-onset  Pompe  disease,  thus  covering  the 
extremes of severity of the disease spectrum.  
In  the  United  States  (US),  alglucosidase  alfa  is  currently  manufactured  at  two  different  production 
scales.  Alglucosidase  alfa  manufactured  at  the  160L  scale  (initial  pilot  scale)  has  a  brand  name  of 
Myozyme® (alglucosidase alfa) and alglucosidase alfa manufactured at the 4000L (final manufacturing 
scale)  has  a  brand  name  of  Lumizyme.  The  present  study  aimed  to  clinically  assess  the  efficacy  and 
safety of treatment with alglucosidase alfa produced at the 4000L scale in patients with Pompe disease 
previously treated with alglucosidase alfa 160L. The data obtained in this study were expected by the 
MAH  to  allow  greater  access  to  alglucosidase  alfa  produced  in  larger  quantity  at  the  4000L  scale  for 
patients currently being treated with alglucosidase alfa 160L. 
In Europe, alglucosidase alfa (brand name Myozyme) produced at the 4000L scale since 2008. 
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final reports for: 
• 
AGLU 09411: A phase 4, open-label, prospective study in patients with Pompe disease to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of alglucosidase alfa produced at the 4000 L scale.

1.3.2.  Clinical study 
Description 
AGLU 09411 is an open-label, prospective study of US patients aged 1 year or older at time of consent 
who  had  a  confirmed  diagnosis  of  Pompe  disease  and  were  previously  treated  with  alglucosidase  alfa 
160 L 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The  aim  of  the  study  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  treatment  with  alglucosidase  alfa 
produced at the 4000 L scale in patients previously treated with 160 L scale alglucosidase alfa. 
Study design 
This was an open-label, prospective study of US patients aged 1 year or older at time of consent who 
had a confirmed diagnosis of Pompe disease and were previously treated with alglucosidase alfa 160 L. 
All  eligible  patients  received  an  intravenous  (IV)  infusion  of  alglucosidase  alfa  (recombinant  human 
acid  α-glucosidase)  produced  at  the  4000  L  scale  for  52  weeks  at  the  same  dose  and  dose  regimen 
used for their routine treatment prior to the study.  
Following  the  52-week  treatment  period,  patients  had  the  option  to  continue  treatment  with 
alglucosidase alfa 4000 L in an extension period until the label expansion of Lumizyme was approved 
by the FDA.  
Patients  should  have  remained  on  a  stable  dose  of  alglucosidase  alfa  for  the  duration  of  the  study  if 
clinically  feasible.  If  a  patient  experienced  clinical  worsening  as  defined  by  the  primary  efficacy 
objective that was sustained on repeated measurement, the patient may have been managed per the 
discretion of the Investigator which may have included return to treatment with alglucosidase alfa 160 
L. 
Study population /Sample size 
Screened  patients  were  defined  as  any  patient  who  signed  the  informed  consent,  and  who  met  the 
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria: 
Main inclusion criteria: 
• 
• 
The patient must have been at least 1 year of age at the time of informed consent. 
The  patient  had  a  diagnosis  of  Pompe  disease  and  must  have  received  treatment  with 
alglucosidase alfa 160 L prior to screening.

• 
The  patient,  if  female  and  of  childbearing  potential,  must  have  had  a  negative  pregnancy  test 
(urine  beta-human  chorionic  gonadotropin)  at  baseline.  Note:  all  female  patients  of  childbearing 
potential  and  sexually  mature  males  must  have  agreed  to  use  a  medically  accepted  method  of 
contraception throughout the study. 
Main exclusion criteria: 
• 
• 
The patient had within the past 3 months prior to screening received or was at time of screening 
receiving  any  investigational  product  other  than  alglucosidase  alfa  160  L  or  was  at  time  of 
screening participating in another clinical treatment study. 
The  patient,  in  the  opinion  of  the  Investigator,  was  clinically  unstable  and  would  not  have  been 
expected to survive to completion of the 52-week treatment period. 
Sample size 
Sample  size  of  this  study  was  not  determined  based  on  statistical  power.  All  eligible  patients  among 
those  who  were  receiving  alglucosidase  alfa  160  L  in  the  US  and  met  eligibility  criteria  may  have 
enrolled into the study. 
Treatments 
The investigational medicinal product (IMP) in this study was Alglucosidase alfa an rhGAA produced at 
the 4000 L manufacturing scale. 
All  eligible  patients  were  to  receive  an  intravenous  (IV)  infusion  at  the  same  dose  and  dose  regimen 
used for their routine treatment prior to the study. If clinically feasible, patients should have remained 
on a stable dosing regimen throughout the duration of the study.  
Patients  were  required  to  remain  in  the  hospital  or  the  infusion  center  for  observation  of  AEs  for  2 
hours after each infusion.  
Patients may have had the option for home infusions. Home infusion may have begun after receiving 2 
alglucosidase  alfa  infusions  during  study  participation  with  infusions  monitored  in  a  hospital  or  an 
infusion  center  and  no  history  of  moderate  or  severe  infusion  associated-reaction  IARs  or  SAEs. 
Because  of  the  possibility  of  anaphylactic  reactions,  personnel  competent  in  recognizing  and  treating 
adverse  reactions  (including  anaphylactic  reactions)  were  readily  available  throughout  the  home 
infusion. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy  was  assessed  through  echocardiographic  evaluation  of  left  ventricular  mass  (dimensions  and 
function),  evaluation  of  respiratory  function,  pulmonary  function  testing,  and  gross  motor  function 
measurement using the GMFM-88 scale. 
The GMFM-88 scale was designed to measure gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy and 
specifically  detected  quantitative  changes  in  gross  motor  function.  There  was  no  age  cut-off  for  the 
GMFM-88. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was the proportion of patients transitioned to treatment 
with 4000 L scale alglucosidase alfa who were clinically stable or improved at Week 52, defined as the 
absence of any of the following definitions of clinical worsening: 
• Death due to disease progression or new dependency on invasive ventilation

• Decline in cardiac status from baseline with an increase in LVM-Z of >1 Z-score above a Z-score of 2 
(ie, outside the normal range) 
•  Decline  in  motor  function  from  baseline  as  measured  by  an  absolute  decrease  in  GMFM-88  Total 
Percent Score of ≥8% 
•  Decline  in  pulmonary  function  from  baseline  with  a  decrease  of  ≥15%  in  absolute  value  in  FVC 
percent predicted in the sitting position 
•  Decline  in  cardiac  status,  motor  function,  and  pulmonary  function  had  to  be  confirmed  by  retest 
within 4 weeks. 
The secondary endpoints of this study were: 
• Percent survival at Week 52 
• Percent invasive ventilator-free survival at Week 52 
• Change from baseline on LVM-Z at Week 52 
• Change from baseline on GMFM-88 Total Percent Score at Week 52 
• Change from baseline in FVC percent predicted in sitting position at Week 52 
Statistical Methods 
Four analysis populations were defined for this study: the full analysis (FA) set, per protocol (PP) set, 
safety set, and PK analysis set. Patients who received at least one infusion of study drug were included 
in the FA set. All patients in the FA set and who satisfied the following conditions were included in the 
PP set: 
• Received alglucosidase alfa in 4000 L scale only throughout the trial 
• Completed the study at Week 52 
• The safety set was the same as the FA set. Patients who consented to participate in the PK analysis 
and provided at least one blood sample pre- and post-infusion were included in the PK Set. 
Results  were  summarized  descriptively  and  no  formal  hypothesis  testing  was  performed.  Categorical 
variables  were  summarized  using  frequency  count  and  percentage  distribution.  Continuous  variables 
were  summarized  using  number  of  observations,  mean,  standard  deviation,  median,  minimum  and 
maximum.  For  variables  with  skewed  distributions,  additional  25th  and  75th  percentiles  and  inter-
quartile  range  were  also  provided.  The  95%  confidence  intervals  CI  were  presented  for  a  selected 
number of variables as described in the sections below. As appropriate, exact method was used for the 
derivation of 95% CI.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Study Initiation Date (first patient consented): 09 March 2012 
Study Completion Date (last patient completed): 29 December 2014 
In total, 114 patients were screened, and 113 patients were treated. Of these, 100 patients (88.5%) 
completed the Week 52 visit.  
Two patients did not meet all inclusion criteria but were treated in the study with the agreement of the 
Sponsor’s  Medical  Officer:  A  patient  was  receiving  investigational  gene  therapy  at  the  time  of 
screening,  and  a  patient  was  consented  prior  to  1  year  of  age  although  the  patient  did  not  receive 
treatment with alglucosidase alfa 4000 L until after reaching 1 year of age. 
Of  the  13  patients  who  discontinued  before  Week  52,  8  patients  discontinued  when  the  study  was 
terminated  by  the  Sponsor  upon  approval  of  the  Lumizyme  label  expansion  and  transitioned  to 
commercial treatment, 2 patients died, and 2 patients refused further treatment in the study and died 
shortly after withdrawal. One patient was discontinued due to physician decision. 
Of the 100 patients who entered the extension phase, 45 patients (39.8%) received study drug within 
the  extension  part  of  the  trial  for  at  least  18  months.  A  total  of  55  patients  (48.7%)  terminated  the 
study  before  Month  18  of  the  extension  phase.  Of  these,  4  patients  (3.5%)  died  and  51  (45.1%) 
discontinued  due  to  transitioned  to  commercially  available  alglucosidase  alfa  either  because  of 
physician decision  or when the study was terminated by the Sponsor upon approval of the Lumizyme 
label expansion.

Patient disposition - full analysis population 
Note: There were 2 patients who did not meet all inclusion criteria but were treated in the study with the agreement of the Sponsor's 
Medical Officer: a patient was receiving investigational gene therapy at the time of screening, and a patient was consented prior to 1 
year of age, but did not receive Lumizyme until 1 year of age. One patient passed screening but was not treated in the study,because 
he/she went onto commercial Lumizyme upon FDA approval. Note: Percentages are based on total number of patients treated.

The number of male and female patients was comparable at 60 (53.1%) and 53 (46.9%), respectively. 
The majority of patients were white (71 patients, 62.8%) while 26 (23.0%) patients were Black and 7 
(6.2%) were Asian. 
The  median  age  at  first  infusion  of  Myozyme  was  0.6  years  (range:  0.0  to  11.4).  Of  the  113  treated 
patients, 46 patients received Myozyme treatment prior to 6 months of age, and 26 additional patients 
were treated between 6 months and < 1 year of age (by definition, a total of 72 [63.6%] patients had 
classical infantile-onset Pompe disease). 
All patients who were 12 months of age or older on alglucosidase alfa 160 L treatment, regardless of 
phenotype (infantile-onset versus late-onset), were given the opportunity to enroll into this study. The 
median age at first infusion of alglucosidase alfa 4000 L was 3.8  years (range: 1.0 to 18.7), and the 
majority  of  patients  (84.1%)  were  under  the  age  of  8  years  at  the  time  of  first  infusion  with 
alglucosidase alfa 4000 L.

Pompe disease characteristics at baseline: 
The patients experienced the first symptoms of Pompe disease at a median  age of 0.3 years (range: 
0.0 to 8.9 years), and the median age of being diagnosed with Pompe disease was 0.5 years (range: 
0.0 to 8.8 years). The mean duration of disease (as defined as the years since symptom onset to first 
infusion of Myozyme 160L) was 1.1 years (median, 0.2 years; range: 0 to 11.4 years). Approximately 
half of the patients had disease duration of less than 0.24 years. 
The majority of patients (65 patients, 57.5%) were not currently ambulatory, with 11 of these patients 
having  been  ambulatory  at  some  point.  Overall,  43  (38.1%)  patients  were  on  mechanical  ventilator 
support, with 32 (28.3%) on invasive ventilator support at the Screening Visit. The median duration of 
dependence on invasive ventilator support was 3.9 years (range: 0.1 to 17.0 years).

Myozyme treatment 
Most  patients  received  20  mg/kg  Myozyme  qow  (81  patients  [71.7%])  or  20  mg/kg  weekly  (13 
patients [11.5%]) prior to the study. 10 patients received Myozyme treatment at 40 mg/kg qow prior 
to entering the study. Mean duration of prior treatment was 3.1 years, ranging from 0.0 to 12.8 years.

PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of  patients  transitioned  to  treatment  with  4000  L 
scale alglucosidase alfa who were clinically stable or improved at Week 52. At Week 52, 83.7% (95% 
CI: 75.1%, 90.2%) of patients were clinically stable or improved.  
For  the  17  patients  who  declined,  the  most  frequent  reasons  were  GMFM  decreased  ≥8%  (12  of  90 
patients  [13.3%]),  FVC  decreased  ≥15%  (2  of  22  patients  [9.1%]),  and  dependency  on  invasive 
ventilator  (5  out  of  71  patients  [7.0%]).  Of  the  patients  who  declined,  2  patients  died  prior  to  52 
weeks on study.

SECONDARY EFFICACY ENDPOINTS 
Percent survival at Week 52 
The percent of patients surviving remained steady throughout the study from 3 to 12 months from the 
first 4000 L infusion. At 12 months, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival was 98.1% (95% CI: 92.73, 
99.53). 
Percent invasive ventilator-free survival at Week 52 
The  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  of  invasive  ventilator-free  survival  decreased  slightly  from  3  months 
(95.1%; 95% CI: 87.38,  98.12) to 12 months (92.4%; 95% CI: 83.89, 96.53) from the first 4000 L 
infusion. 
Change from baseline on LVM-Z at Week 52 
The mean LVM Z-score was stable throughout the study, with a mean (SD) change from baseline of -
0.5 (1.71) at Week 52. 
Change from baseline on GMFM88 Total Percent Score at Week 52 
GMFM-88  total  score  increased  from  baseline,  indicating  an  improvement  in  motor  function,  with  a 
mean (SD) change from baseline in total percent score of 3.7 (17.46) at Week 52. 
Change from baseline in FVC percent predicted in sitting position at Week 52 
Few patients (22 of 113) were included in the analysis of FVC percent predicted at Week 52 because 
PFTs  were  not  required  for  young  patients  unable  to  reliably  undergo  testing  and  PFTs  were 
unobtainable in patients who received invasive ventilation.

At Week 52, the mean (SD) change from baseline in FVC percent predicted was 2.3 (11.80). 
Pharmacokinetic Evaluation in Study AGLU09411  
Because  participation  in  PK  testing  was  optional  in  this  study,  plasma  concentration  results  are 
available only for 3 patients. Due to the limited data set, PK results and drug concentrations for these 
patients are listed only and have not been analysed. 
CHMP comments on efficacy:  
The  objectives  of  study  AGLU09411  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  alglucosidase  alfa 
produced  in  larger  quantity  in  the  4000  L  scale  in  patients  previously  treated  with  alglucosidase  alfa 
produced at 160L scale. 
This study is a phase IV prospective open label non comparative study in which all US patients aged 1 
year or older at time of consent, who had a confirmed diagnosis of Pompe disease and were previously 
treated with alglucosidase alfa 160L were eligible regardless of phenotype (infantile-onset versus late-
onset Pompe disease). 
Proportion of female and male was comparable. The patients experienced the first symptoms of Pompe 
disease at a median age of 0.3 years, and the median age of being diagnosed with Pompe disease was 
0.5 years. Of the 113 treated patients, 72 [63.7%] patients received alglucosidase alfa 160L treatment 
prior to 1 year of age patients (corresponding to a classical infantile-Pompe disease). 
The  majority  of  patients  (84.0%)  were  under  the  age  of  8  years  at  the  time  of  first  infusion  with 
alglucosidase alfa 4000L (median age 3.8 years). 
From a statistical point of view, no formal hypothesis testing was performed for this study and results 
were only descriptive. 
113  patients  were  treated  of  then,  110  completed  then  52-week  treatment.  13  patients  discontinued 
for the following reasons: 8 due to study termination, 2 died, 2 refused further treatment and one due 
to physician decision. All patients entered the extension phase. 
The  primary  endpoint  was  the  percentage  of  patient  transitioned  to  treatment  with  4000L  scale 
alglucosidase alfa who did not met one of the predefined worsening criteria.  
The  predefined  worsening  criteria  were  death  due  to  disease  progression  or  new  dependency  on 
invasive  ventilation,  decline  in  cardiac  status  (evaluated  by  LVM-Z  score),  decline  in  motor  function 
from baseline (decrease in GMFM-88 Total Percent  Score of ≥8%) and decline in pulmonary function 
from baseline (decrease in FVC percent predicted in sitting position ≥15%). 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, 83.7% of patients (87/104 patients; 95% CI: 75.1%, 90.2%) were 
clinically  stable  or  improved  at  Week  52.  The  most  frequent  reason  for  decline  was  GMFM  decreased 
≥8% (12 of 90 patients [13.3%]). 
 Only  assessment  of  gross  motor  function  could  be  obtained  in  a  consistent  manner  in  all  study 
participants  (n=90),  while  pulmonary  function  testing  could  not  be  performed  in  the  majority  of 
patients  (n=22),  due  to  either  the  patient’s  young  age  or  their  dependency  on  invasive  ventilation. 
Moreover  acquisition  difficulties  of  echocardiography  data  in  a  number  of  study  participants  led  to 
incomplete data sets. 
Regarding  Pharmacokinetic  results,  plasma  concentration  results  were  only  available  for  3  patients 
thus  no  conclusion  can  be  drawn  regarding  the  comparability  of  the  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  profile  of 
alglucosidase alfa produced at the 4000 L and 160 L scales.

•  Safety results 
Extent of exposure 
The  113  patients  who  received  alglucosidase  alfa  4000L  in  AGLU09411  study  comprise  the  safety 
population  for  this  report.  All  113  patients  were  previously  treated  with  Myozyme  prior  to  enrollment 
into this study. 
The  median  duration  of  study  drug  treatment  was  929  days  (range:  41  to  985  days).  A  total  of  100 
patients  received  at  least  52  weeks  of  treatment.  The  median  number  of  study  drug  infusions  per 
patient was 27 infusions (range: 6 to 53 infusions). 
Of  note,  after  receiving  treatment  with  alglucosidase  alfa  4000L,  2  patients  temporarily  received 
treatment  with  alglucosidase  alfa  160L.  As  per  request  of  the  Investigator,  a  patient  received 
treatment with alglucosidase alfa 160 L from 27 June 2012 to 11 October 2012, and was then returned 
to treatment with alglucosidase alfa 4000 L. A patient was approved to go on 160 L in January 2014, 
but did not start on 160 L product until 04 August 2014 through 20 October 2014. 
The  following  patients  have  received  immunomodulation  treatment:  4  patients  received  concomitant 
methotrexate,  6  patients  received  concomitant  rituximab,  and  9  patients  received  concomitant 
immunoglobulins  for  immunomodulation,  immune  deficiency  or  immune  suppression.  A  patient 
received prophylactic ITI treatment during participation in Study AGLU03807. 
The majority of patients (81 patients, 71.7%) received 20 mg/kg qow of alglucosidase alfa 4000L. 
Adverse events 
Brief summary of adverse events 
A  total  of  2752  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  were  reported  in  113  patients  (overall 
safety  population).  All  113  patients  reported  at  least  1  TEAE.  An  overall  summary  of  TEAEs  is 
presented in Table 2.

The majority of AEs were non-serious (89.6% of total AEs), mild to moderate in severity (95.5%) and 
assessed as unrelated to the study drug  (93.9%). A majority of treatment-related AEs (88.7%) were 
IARs and were reported in 35 patients.  
One  hundred  and  twenty-four  AEs  (4.5%  of  total  AEs)  were  assessed  as  severe  in  44  patients.  The 
only severe TEAEs experienced by more than 5% of patients were pneumonia (12 patients [10.6%]), 
respiratory distress (9 patients [8.0%]), and respiratory failure (7 patients [6.2%]). 
The  treatment-emergent  adverse  events,  without  regard  to  causality,  are  summarised  in  Table 
14.3.1.2.3 of Appendix 16.2.7 “Adverse event data”. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs, regardless of relationship to alglucosidase alfa, were pyrexia (234 
events in 63 patients [55.8%]), diarrhoea (122 events in 55 patients [48.7%]), upper respiratory tract 
infection  (106  events  in  50  patients  [44.2%]),  vomiting  (114  events  in  43  patients  [38.1%]),  cough 
(107 events in 37 patients [32.7%]), rash (43 events in 32 patients [28.3%]), pneumonia (65 events 
in 30 patients [26.5%]), rhinorrhoea (42 events in 24 patients [21.2%]), and otitis media (35 events 
in 23 patients [20.4%]). 
Adverse Event by relationship to treatment 
There  were  168  events  that  were  considered  related  to  alglucosidase  alfa  in  38  patients  (33.6%),  of 
which  the  most  common  was  pyrexia  (11  patients).  Related  treatment  emergent  adverse  events 
occurring in ≥2 patients are listed in Table 26 below.

Adverse events by 6-month time interval 
The  percentage  of  patients  who  reported  TEAEs  was  similar  across  intervals,  ranging  from  87.0%  in 
the >12 to 18 months interval to 94.7% in the 0 to 6 months interval. There was no consistent trend 
in TEAE incidence by time interval. 
In each time interval (0-6, >6-12, >12-18, >18-24, and >24 months of treatment), the most frequent 
TEAEs were pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, vomiting, and cough. 
Adverse events by infusion time period 
The  majority  of  the  events  occurring  during  the  infusion  (78/112  events)  and  up  to  2  hours  post-
infusion (17/35 events) were considered to be IARs. During 2-24 hours post-infusion, the majority of 
TEAEs were not considered to be IARs (8/62 events) and 1 patient experienced IARs between 24 and 
72 hours post-infusion. 
The majority of these TEAEs occurred during the infusion or within 24 hours of the infusion. There were 
a total of 112 events (41.5%) that occurred during the infusion, 35 events (13%) that occurred 0 to 2 
hours  post-infusion,  62  events  (23%)  that  occurred  2  to  24  hours  post-infusion,  43  events  (15.9%) 
that occurred 24 to 48 hours post-infusion, and 18 events (6.7%) that occurred 48 to 72 hours post-
infusion. 
There  were  2  TEAEs  that  occurred  in  at  least  5% of  patients  in  any  given  infusion/post-infusion  time 
interval: pyrexia occurred during infusion (12 events in 8 patients [7.1%]), 0-2 hours post-infusion (7 
events in 6 patients [5.3%]), and 2 to 24 hours post-infusion (12 events in 10 patients [8.8%]) and 
diarrhea occurred 2-24 hours post-infusion (7 events in 6 patients [5.3%]). 
The most frequent TEAEs that occurred in ≥3 patients by infusion time period were as follows: 
•  During  the  infusion:  blood  pressure  increased,  erythema,  flushing,  pyrexia,  tachycardia,  urticaria, 
and vomiting 
• During the 0-2 hours post-infusion: pyrexia 
• During the 2-24 hours post-infusion: diarrhea, vomiting, and pyrexia 
• During the 24-48 hours post-infusion: pyrexia 
• During the 48-72 hours post-infusion period: pyrexia 
Adverse events by gender subgroup 
Analysis of AEs by gender did not reveal any meaningful differences in the types of TEAEs experienced 
between the genders. The 60 (100%) male patients experienced 1,271 TEAEs and 53 (100%) female 
patients experienced 1,481 TEAEs. 
Adverse events by age subgroup 
The most frequent TEAEs  occurring in at least 5 or  more patients in the age  group of <2  years were 
pyrexia,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  diarrhea,  vomiting,  rhinorrhea,  respiratory  distress,  cough, 
rash, pneumonia, ear infection, viral infection, nasal congestion, nasopharyngitis and constipation. 
The  most  frequent  TEAEs  occurring  in  at  least  5  or  more  patients  in  the  2-5  year  age  category  were

procedural  pain,  blood  creatine  phosphokinase  MB  increase,  muscle  weakness,  headache,  nasal 
congestion, and oropharyngeal pain. 
The  most  frequent  TEAEs  occurring  in  at  least  5  or  more  patients  in  the  5-8  year  age  category  were 
pyrexia,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  diarrhea,  cough,  headache,  otitis  media,  abdominal  pain 
upper, tachycardia, viral infection, fall, vomiting, urticaria, and rash. 
The most frequent TEAEs occurring in at least 5 or more patients in the 8-12 year age category were 
pyrexia and diarrhea. 
The  most  frequent  TEAE  occurring  in  at  least  5  or  more  patients  in  the  >12  year  age  category  was 
pneumonia. 
Adverse events by dosing regimen 
Treatment-emergent  AEs  are  summarized  by  dosing  regimen  in  16-2-7-ae-data  [Table  14.3.1.6.3]. 
Few patients were included in the 10 mg/kg Weekly (n=1), 20 mg/kg Weekly (n=13), 30 mg/kg qow 
(n=3), and 30 mg/kg Weekly (n=1) regimens.  
Adverse events by immunogenicity parameters 
A summary of safety by immunogenicity parameters, including by seroconversion status and quartiles 
of  peak  IgG  titer,  sustained  high  antibody  titers,  and  inhibitory  antibodies,  is  presented  in  Table  29, 
Table 30, and Table 31.

A total of 28 SAEs were reported for the 4 out of the 5 patients with sustained and elevated titers: 
-  Patient  10325027  experienced  SAEs  of  chest  pain,  dyspnea,  hyperhidrosis,  sinus  tachycardia,  and 
urinary tract infection. Of the 5 SAEs reported for this patient, none were considered as IARs. Per 16-
2-7-ae-data [Table 14.3.2.2.17.1], the patient experienced 1 additional non-serious IAR of headache. 
The patient recovered from all the events. 
-  Patient  10015011  experienced  SAEs  of  oxygen  saturation  decreased  (2  events),  abdominal  pain, 
tracheitis,  cholecystitis  acute,  dehydration,  diarrhea,  dyspnea, 
intussusception,  pyrexia,  and 
respiratory  failure.  Of  the  11  SAEs  reported  for  this  patient,  3  were  considered  as  IARs:  abdominal 
pain,  diarrhea,  and  pyrexia.  Per  16-2-7-ae-data  [Table  14.3.2.2.17.1],  the  patient  experienced  14 
additional non-serious IARs of flushing (3 events), urticaria (3 events), dyspnea (2 events), diarrhea, 
heart rate increased, macule, respiratory distress, tachycardia, and wheezing. 
-  Patient  10555058  experienced  SAEs  atelectasis,  pneumonia,  bradycardia,  chest  pain,  cough, 
hypotension, left ventricular hypertrophy; all 7 SAEs were considered not related to study treatment. 
No IARs were reported for Patient 10555058. 
-  Patient  10015106  experienced  SAEs  of  feeding  tube  complication,  respiratory  distress  (2  events), 
pyrexia,  cardio-respiratory  arrest.  Of  the  5  SAEs  reported  for  this  patient,  none  were  considered  as 
IARs.  Per  16-2-7-ae-data  [Table  14.3.2.2.17.1],  the  patient  experienced  hypertension,  tachycardia, 
pyrexia  (2  events),  body  temperature  increased,  and  tachycardia.  See  Section  15.3.3  for  detailed 
patient narratives for these 2 patients. 
A single patient tested positive for inhibitory antibodies for enzyme uptake at baseline. This patient had 
a  baseline  titer  of  25  600,  a  peak  titer  of  102  400  (at  Week  30),  and  a  last  titer  of  25  600  at  Week 
117. This patient reported the following 5 SAEs: pneumonia (2 events), pneumonia parainfluenza viral, 
sepsis,  and  device  related  infection.  The  2  events  of  pneumonia  and  the  event  of  pneumonia 
parainfluenza  viral  sepsis  were  considered  severe  in  intensity  and  both  sepsis  and  device  related 
infection  were  considered  moderate  and  not  related  to  study  treatment.  The  patient  had  recovered 
from the events, with sequelae for the event of pneumonia parainfluenza viral. 
Death and study discontinuations for safety reasons 
One hundred patients completed AGLU09411 study. 
There were no AEs leading to discontinuation from the study. 
Two patients temporarily received alglucosidase alfa 160L during the trial. 
Six patients (5.3%) died during the study. All of the deaths were unrelated to alglucosidase alfa 4000L 
treatment and were due to disease progression (respiratory failure and pneumonia; cardio-respiratory

arrest and cerebral ischemia; respiratory failure (2); respiratory distress; cardiac arrest). In addition, 2 
patients  (10015106,  10735032)  died  shortly  after  withdrawal  (from  unknown  cause  and  respiratory 
failure, respectively). 
Other serious adverse events 
A total of 287 treatment-emergent SAEs (10.4% of total AEs) were experienced by 73 patients during 
the study. 
All  SAEs  experienced  during  treatment  with  alglucosidase  alfa  are  summarized  by  relationship  to 
treatment in Table 14.3.2.1.4 of Appendix 16.2.7 “Adverse event data”. 
The  majority  of  SAEs  were  unrelated  to  study  drug.  Eight  patients  (7.1%)  experienced  SAEs 
considered  related  to  the  study  drug:  a  Patient  (abdominal  pain,  diarrhoea,  and  pyrexia),  another 
(vomiting),  (self-injurious  ideation),  (pyrexia  [2  events],  chills  [2  events],  rhonchi,  tremor),  another 
patient  (gross  motor  delay  [2  events]),  another  patient  (oedema  peripheral),  another  patient  (left 
ventricular  hypertrophy  identified  as  an  ECG  finding,  however  was  not  associated  with  changes  in 
ECHO or changes in clinical signs or symptoms; the event was assessed by the investigator as due to 
decreased  response  to  treatment),  and  another  patient  (chills,  pyrexia,  nausea).  All  of  these  events 
were  considered  IARs  except  for  the  events  of  gross  motor  delay  (2  events)  and  left  ventricular 
hypertrophy. 
Of the 73 patients who experienced SAEs, 39 (34.5%) patients experienced severe events, 31 (27.4%) 
patients experienced moderate events, and 3 (2.7%) patients experienced mild events. The majority of 
SAEs were resolved. 
SAEs by 6-month time intervals 
During  the  first  6  months  in  the  study,  33  of  113  patients  (29.2%)  reported  SAEs.  During  the  later 
time  intervals,  36  of  107 patients  (33.6%)  reported  SAEs  from  >6  to  12  months,  33  of  100  patients 
(33.0%) reported SAEs from >12 to 18 months, 26 of 91 patients (28.6%) reported SAEs from >18 to 
24 months, and 28 of 83 patients (33.7%) reported SAEs after 24 months on treatment. 
The most frequent SAEs reported in at least 5 patients occurring in each interval were: 
• 0 to 6 month: pyrexia (5 [4.4%] patients), respiratory distress (6 [5.3%] patients), and pneumonia 
(5 [4.4%] patients) 
• >6 to 12 months: pneumonia (10 [9.3%] patients) and respiratory distress (7 [6.5%] patients) 
• >12 to 18 months: pneumonia (4 [4.0%] patients) 
• >18 to 24 months: pneumonia (7 [7.7%] patients) and Respiratory distress (5 [5.5%] patients) 
• >24 months: pneumonia (5 [6.0%] patients) 
As  presented  in  16-2-7-ae-data  [Table  14.3.2.1.4],  all  of  the  SAEs  of  pneumonia  were  considered 
unrelated to alglucosidase alfa.

SAEs by infusion time period 
Thirty-seven SAEs were experienced by 26 patients during infusion or up to 72 hours post-infusion. Of 
the 37 SAEs, more events were experienced during infusion or between 2-24 hours post-infusion (15 
events [40.5%] in 11 patients [9.7%]) compared to the other infusion time periods. 
The  only  SAEs  occurring  in  ≥2  patients  during  any  infusion  time  period  were  supraventricular 
tachycardia (48-72 hours post-infusion), pyrexia (0-2 hours post-infusion), and respiratory failure (0-2 
hours  post-infusion).  The  SAEs  experienced  during  infusion  and  up  to  72  hours  post-infusion  are 
consistent with the known safety profile of alglucosidase alfa. 
The majority of the AEs occurring during the infusion and up to 2 hours post-infusion were considered 
to be IARs. During 2-24 hours post-infusion, the majority of AEs were not considered to be IARs and 
there  were  no  IARs  reported  between  24  and  48  hours  post-infusion  and  2  IARs  between  48  and  72 
hours post-infusion (16-2-7-ae-data [Table 14.3.2.2.2]). 
Serious adverse events by gender subgroup 
Analysis of SAEs by gender did not reveal any meaningful differences in the types of SAEs experienced. 
Out  of  60  male  patients,  38  (63.3%)  patients  had  155  events.  Out  of  53  female  patients,  35  (66%) 
patients had 132 events. 
Serious adverse events by age subgroup 
Events  across  age  categories  were  consistent  with  the  manifestations  and  complications  of  the 
underlying Pompe disease or the known safety profile of alglucosidase alfa in this patient population. 
Serious adverse events by dosing regimen 
Serious  adverse  events  are  summarized  by  dosing  regimen  in  16-2-7-ae-data  [Table  14.3.2.1.8]. 
Analysis  of  SAEs  by  dosing  regimen  did  not  reveal  any  meaningful  differences  in  the  types  of  SAEs 
experienced. 
Other significant adverse events 
Infusion-associated reactions 
An IAR was defined by Genzyme as any events occurring on the day of infusion and up to 48 hours (2 
days) after infusion. 
One hundred and forty-nine (149) IARs (at any severity grade) were reported in 35 patients.  
The  most  frequent  IARs  occurring  in  ≥2  patients  were:  pyrexia,  tachycardia,  urticaria,  flushing,  and 
vomiting. 
Of  the  35  patients  with  IARs,  all  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity  and  the  majority  of  IARs  were 
considered non-serious. 
Of  the  patients  who  experienced  IARs,  the  majority  of  patients  were  IgG  positive  with  a  peak  titer 
range of 200 to 102 400. None of the patients experiencing IARs tested positive for IgE antibodies. Of 
the  patients  who  were  seronegative  at  baseline,  10  patients  seroconverted,  of  which,  2  patients  had 
IARs: Patient 10405047 seroconverted at Study Day 225, and had a peak titer of 400 at Weeks 64 and 
78;  and  Patient  10735048  seroconverted  at  Study  Day  87,  and  had  a  peak  titer  of  800  at  Weeks  64 
and 78 and a last titer of 400 at Week 52.

Eight patients experienced an IAR with the Day 1 infusion: a patient (IgG titer range at time of IARs: 
3200 to 12 800), another patient (not seropositive at time of IAR), another patient (IgG titer at time of 
IAR not available), another patient (IgG titer at time of IAR: 25600-25600), another patient (IgG titer 
at  time  of  IAR:  3200),  another  patient  (not  seropositive  at  time  of  IAR),  another  patient  (not 
seropositive  at  time  of  IAR),  another  patient  (IgG  titer  at  time  of  IAR:  1600).  Two  of  these  patients 
had received immunomodulation treatment: 10015011 and 10665015. 
IARs by 6-month time interval 
During  the  first  6  months  in  the  study,  22  of  113  patients  (19.5%)  had  IARs.  During  the  later  time 
intervals, 13 of 107 patients (12.1%) had IARs from >6 to 12 months, 11 of 100 patients (11.0%) had 
IARs from >12 to 18 months, 12 of 91 patients (13.2%) had IARs from >18 to 24 months, and 13 of 
83 patients (15.7%) had IARs after 24 months on treatment. 
First 6 months on treatment, the most frequent IARs occurring in ≥2 patients were: pyrexia, vomiting, 
tachycardia,  nausea,  urticaria,  headache,  flushing,  abdominal  pain,  diarrhea,  chills,  blood  pressure 
increased, and wheezing. During the >6 to 12-month time interval, the IARs occurring in ≥2 patients 
were:  pyrexia,  cough,  urticaria,  and  flushing.  During  the  >12  to  18-month  interval,  no  IARs  were 
reported in more than 1 patient. During the >18 to 24-month time interval, the IARs occurring in ≥2 
patients were: pyrexia, urticaria, headache, and abdominal pain upper. 
After 24 months on treatment, the only IAR reported in more than 1 patient was urticaria. 
IARs by infusion time interval 
The majority of IARs were experienced during infusion or within 24 hours post-infusion. There were no 
events assessed as IARs between 24 and 48 hours. 
There were 2 events assessed as IARs between 48 and 72 hours. 
The  most  frequent  IARs  occurring  in  ≥2  patients  during  infusion  were:  urticaria,  pyrexia,  flushing, 
nausea, vomiting, headache, throat irritation, tachycardia, blood pressure increased, and erythema. 
One  IAR  occurred  in  ≥2  patients  during  0-2  hour’s  post-infusion:  pyrexia,  and  1  IAR  occurred  in  ≥2 
patients during 2-24 hours post-infusion: diarrhea. There were no IARs experienced in patients during 
24-48 hours post-infusion. 
IARs by Infusion Rate 
There does not appear to be an association between IARs and infusion rate from >0 to ≤3 mg/kg/hr to 
>7 mg/kg/hr. Twelve patients (10.6%) experienced IARs at infusion rates of >0 to ≤3 mg/kg/hr. Eight 
patients  (7.1%)  each  experienced  IARs  at  infusion  rates  of  >3  to  ≤5  mg/kg/hr  and  >5  to  ≤7 
mg/kg/hr. Six patients (5.3%) experienced IARs at an infusion rate of >7 mg/kg/hr.  
There were 4 serious IARs in 1 patient (0.9%) that occurred at the >7 mg/kg/hr infusion rate. 
A total of 6 patients experienced an IAR at an infusion at rate >7 mg/kg/hr; these patients are listed in 
Table 35 with the IARs they experienced at an infusion rate >7 mg/kg/hr, IARs they experienced after 
completion  of  an  infusion  associated  with  IAR  at  an  infusion  rate  >7  mg/kg/hr,  and  their 
immunogenicity  results.  All  6  patients  continued  to  receive  study  treatment  for  the  duration  of  the 
study.  All  of  the  IARs  were  of  mild  or  moderate  intensity  and  the  outcome  was  recovered,  and  no 
consistent  relationship  with  immunogenicity  results  was  apparent.  Pyrexia  (4  events,  1  patient)  was 
the most frequent of the 25 events reported for these 6 patients.

Infusion-associated reactions by gender subgroup 
A summary of IARs by gender is presented in 16-2-7-ae-data [Table 14.3.2.2.12]. Analysis of IARs by 
gender  did  not  reveal  any  meaningful  differences  in  the  types  of  IARs  experienced.  Out  of  60  male 
patients, 19 (31.7%) patients had 70 events. Out of 53 female patients, 16 (30.2%) patients had 79 
events. 
Infusion-associated reactions by age subgroup 
A  summary  of  IARs  by  age  at  first  infusion  is  presented  in  16-2-7-ae-data  [Table  14.3.2.2.11].  The 
IARs occurring in 2 or more patients in the <2 years category were: pyrexia and tachycardia. The IARs 
occurring  in  2  or  more  patients  in  the  2  to  5  years  category  were:  diarrhea,  urticaria,  flushing  and 
pyrexia. The IARs occurring in 2 or more patients in the 5 to 8 years category were: abdominal pain 
upper, pyrexia, cough, flushing, and urticaria. The IARs occurring in 2 patients or more patients in the 
8 to 12 years category were: nausea and rash. No IARs were experienced by 2 or more patients in the 
>12 years category. 
Infusion-associated reactions by dosing regimen 
A  summary  of  IARs  by  dosing  regimen  is  presented  in  16-2-7-ae-data  [Table  14.3.2.2.13].  The 
majority of patients (81 out of 113 patients) were receiving the 20 mg/kg qow dosing regimen. Due to 
the small size of the 10 mg/kg qw, 20 mg/kg qw, 30 mg/kg qow, and 30 mg/kg qw, 40 mg/kg qow, 
and  40  mg/kg  qw  and  the  “Others”  group  which  included  a  number  of  different  dose  and  frequency 
combinations  (see  Table  23),  it  is  difficult  to  draw  any  conclusions;  therefore,  these  groups  are  not 
further discussed by the MAH. 
The  IARs  occurring  in  ≥ 2  patients  in  the  20  mg/kg  qow  dosing  regimen  group  were:  pyrexia, 
tachycardia,  diarrhea,  flushing,  vomiting,  urticaria,  blood  pressure  increased,  rhonchi,  headache, 
erythema, and cough.

Potential infusion reactions and potential delayed reactions 
Potential infusion reactions were defined in the SAP as: all AEs occurring during an infusion or within 2 
hours  after  the  completion  of  an  infusion  will  be  considered  as  potential  IARs.  This  definition  for 
potential  IARs  does  not  rely  on  the  Investigators’  assessment  of  an  AE’s  relationship  to  the  study 
treatment. 
During  the  infusion  period  or  within  2  hours  after  completion  of  infusion,  49  (43.4%)  out  of  113 
patients reported 147 potential infusion reactions (Table 36) regardless of causality. A total of 35 out 
of 113 (31%) patients experienced IARs 16-2-7-ae-data [Table 14.3.2.2.1] and the majority occurred 
during  infusion  or  within  24  hours  post-infusion.  There  were  no  IARs  reported  between  24  and  48 
hours. Two events of diarrhea in 1 patient were reported between 48 and 72 hours post infusion [Table 
14.3.2.2.2]. 
The potential infusion reactions occurring in  ≥2 patients regardless of causal  relationship were: sinus 
tachycardia,  tachycardia,  catheter  site  extravasation,  extravasation,  body  temperature  increased, 
respiratory  failure,  wheezing,  erythema,  vomiting,  nausea,  chest  pain,  chills,  pyrexia,  urinary  tract 
infection,  blood  pressure  increased,  headache,  anxiety,  dyspnea,  rhonchi,  throat  irritation,  urticaria, 
flushing, and cough. The events of potential IARs regardless of causality occurring up to 2 hours post-
infusion  are  consistent  with  the  previous  alglucosidase  alfa  experience  as  described  in  the  product 
prescribing information. 
Potential  delayed  reactions  were  defined  in  the  SAP  as:  all  AEs  which  occur  between  2  to  48  hours 
after  an  infusion.  This  is  irrespective  of  the  Investigator’s  assessment  of  an  AE’s  relationship  to  the 
study  drug.  Potential  delayed  reactions  are  summarized  by  infusion  time  periods  in  16-2-7-ae-data 
[Table 14.3.2.2.10] and listed by patient in [Table 14.3.2.2.17.2]. Refer to Section 11.3.4.1 as well as 
[Table 14.3.2.2.2] for analysis of IARs by infusion time intervals. 
A total of 69 (61.1%) of 113 patients reported 231 potential delayed reactions occurring between 2-48 
hours  post-infusion.  The  majority  of  events  were  assessed  as  not  related  or  unlikely  related  to 
treatment  and  were  considered  to  be  related  to  the  underlying  complications  and  manifestations  of 
Pompe  disease  in  this  patient  population.  The  potential  delayed  reactions  occurring  in  ≥2  patients 
regardless of causal relationship were: vomiting, diarrhea, bradycardia, constipation, pyrexia, bacterial 
tracheitis, device related infection, ear infection, hordeolum, nasopharyngitis, otitis media, pneumonia, 
tracheitis,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  urinary  tract  infection,  oxygen  saturation  decreased,  pain 
in  extremity,  headache,  cough,  hemoptysis,  respiratory  distress,  rash,  anemia,  tachycardia,  nausea, 
secretion discharge, and pseudomonas infection. 
Fifteen patients experienced 26 events which were assessed as possibly related or related to treatment 
and  occurred  on  the  same  day  of  infusion  or  up  to  72  hours  post-infusion  (16-2-7-ae-data  [Table 
14.3.2.2.17.2]).  The  majority  of  these  events  occurred  on  the  same  day  or  2-24  hours  post-infusion 
including  diarrhea,  vomiting,  abdominal  pain/discomfort,  urticaria,  arthralgia,  arthropathy,  myopathy, 
cough,  eyelid  ptosis,  edema,  edema  peripheral,  rash,  electrocardiogram  ST  segment  elevation,  heart 
valve  incompetence,  electrocardiogram  abnormal,  right  ventricular  hypertrophy,  hematuria,  and 
pyrexia.  Events  occurring  ≥48  hours  post-infusion  included  pulmonary  function  test  decreased, 
pyrexia, and diarrhea. 
Anaphylactic and significant allergic reactions 
Four  patients  experienced  reactions  which  met  the  composite  criteria  of  the  standard  MedDRA  query 
for anaphylaxis. Upon review of these AEs for these 4 patients, 3 patients experienced IARs suggestive 
of allergic reactions. The summaries of all 4 cases are listed below:

This patient had a 
screening titer of 12 800 
and an anti-rhGAA IgG 
antibody peak titer of 51 
200 (reached at Week 
126); the last titer was 51 
200. The patient was IgE-
negative, but tested 
positive for complement 
activation at Week 0 and 
Week 36. 
The patient had an anti-
rhGAA IgG antibody peak 
titer of 200 (at Weeks 49 
and 53); the last titer was 
200. 
This case represents an 
IAR of erythema and is not 
considered to be an 
allergic reaction. The 
patient had a peak titer of 
800 (at Weeks 64 and 
78); the last titer was 400. 
The patient had a 
screening titer of 6400 and 
a peak titer of 25 600 (at 
Weeks 4 and 8); the last 
titer was 3200. 
A  patient  was  included  previously  in  the  interim  clinical  study  report  listing  of  potential  anaphylactic 
reaction  but  excluded  in  the  final  clinical  study  report  listing  because  both  events  of  cough  and 
hypotension  started  at  11:08  AM  on  13  Dec  2012,  before  the  closest  infusion  at  11:48  AM  the  same 
day. 
Immune-mediated reactions 
Twelve  patients  were  identified  to  have  experienced  14  events  that  satisfied  the  search  criteria  as 
described  in  16-2-7-ae-data  [Table  14.3.2.3].  Adverse  events  included  lymphadenopathy,  influenza 
like  illness,  arthralgia,  arthropathy,  myalgia,  proteinuria  and  skin  lesion.  All  of  the  events  were 
considered  non-serious  and  mild  in  intensity  except  for  one  event  of  moderate  intensity  for  influenza 
like  illness.  All  patients  recovered  from  the  events  with  the  exception  of  the  events  of  arthropathy, 
proteinuria, and arthralgia. 
Two  patients  experienced mild,  non-serious  adverse  events  of  skin  lesions,  which  occurred  under  the 
tracheostomy tie in 1 patient which was assessed as unrelated to treatment.  
Five  patients  experienced  events  of  arthralgia  or  arthropathy,  which  resolved.  All  events  of 
arthralgia/arthropathy were assessed as unrelated to alglucosidase alfa treatment except for 1 event in 
a patient and 1 event in another patient which were assessed as IARs.  
A  patient  experienced  a  mild,  non-serious,  unrelated  event  of  lymphadenopathy  and  recovered  from 
the event.  
A patient experienced a mild, non-serious, unrelated event of myalgia and recovered from the event.  
A patient experienced a moderate, non-serious, unrelated event of influenza like symptoms. A patient 
experienced a single event of mild, non-serious proteinuria at Week 38, assessed as unlikely related to 
alglucosidase alfa treatment and recorded as not resolved.

Upon review of the cases described above meeting the search criteria, no patients were considered to 
have experienced an immune-mediated reaction. 
Hearing loss 
Five  (4.4%)  patients  had  TEAEs  of  hearing  loss:  conductive  deafness,  deafness,  deafness  unilateral, 
mixed deafness, and deafness neurosensory in 1 patient each (16-2-7-ae-data [Table 14.3.2.4]).  
None  of  the  events  were  SAEs  [Table  14.3.2.1.12].  Deafness  unilateral  was  mild  and  resolved  while 
the  other  events  were  moderate  in  intensity  and  were  recorded  as  not  resolved.  None  of  the  events 
were  considered  related  to  study  drug.  Occurrence  of  some  degree  of  hearing  loss  in  Pompe  disease 
patients while being treated with ERT has been reported in the literature (Prater SN, 2012). 
Immunogenicity  
Anti-rhGAA IgG antibodies 
Patients with sustained and elevated IgG titres were defined as those  who have a peak titre ≥25,600 
and a last titre which is equal to the peak titre or is 1 dilution level lower than the peak titre; 5 out of 
77 patients at baseline who were seropositive had sustained and elevated IgG titres. A total of 28 SAEs 
were reported for the 4 out of the 5 patients with sustained and elevated titres. 
IgG seroconversion and time to seroconversion 
Of  the  113  patients,  77  tested  seropositive  at  baseline  and  24  of  the  36  patients  who  were 
seronegative  at  baseline  remained  negative  throughout  the  entire  study  period.  Twelve  patients 
seroconverted after study entry. 
For patients who were seronegative at baseline and seroconverted, the median time for IgG conversion 
from  date  of  first  infusion  was  113  days  (range:  21.0  to  643.0  days)  and  the  median  titer  value  at 
seroconversion was 100 (range: 100.0 to 1600.0) 
IgG peak titer and time to peak titer 
The  mean  time  from  first  infusion  to  first  occurrence  of  IgG  peak  titre  for  patients  who  tested 
seronegative at baseline was 362.7 days (range: 21.0 to 826.0 days) and the mean time for patients 
who tested seropositive at baseline was 178.4 days  (range: 14.0 to 924.0 days). The overall median 
IgG peak titre was 1,600 (range: 0 to 102,400; n=113) for patients who were ever IgG positive. The 
median  IgG  peak  titre  for  the  patients  who  tested  IgG-negative  at  baseline  was  400  (range:  100  to 
1,600),  markedly  lower  than  the  median  IgG  peak  titre  for  patients  seropositive  at  baseline  1,600 
(range:  0  to  102,400).  The  median  time  from  first  infusion  to  first  occurrence  of  IgG  peak  titre  for 
patients  who  were  seronegative  at  baseline  was  117.5  days  (range:  0  to  686  days)  on  study 
treatment, and titre levels did not increase markedly over the course of the study.

IgG titer over time 
There  were  36  patients  who  were  seronegative  at  baseline.  At  Week  52,  24  out  of  the  36  patients 
remained  seronegative  at  the  end  of  the  study  period.  For  the  77  patients  who  were  seropositive  at 
baseline,  titer  levels  did  not  increase  markedly  over  the  course  of  the  study.  The  range  for  titer  at 
Week 52 was 0.0 to 51 200; the median last titer was 800 for the patients who were seropositive at 
baseline. The range for titer at extension 18 months was 0.0 to 102 400. 
Patients with sustained high IgG antibody, decreasing titer, or tolerization 
Of the 113 patients, 7 patients (6.2%) tolerised, 27 (23.9%) patients had diminishing IgG antibodies 
over the course of the study, and 24 (21.2%) of patients remained seronegative throughout the study 
period. Only 5 (4.4%) of the 113 patients met the protocol defined criteria for high sustained antibody 
titres. 
Neutralizing antibodies of enzyme activity or uptake 
One patient (10595046) tested positive for enzyme uptake inhibition at Day 1 and Weeks 4 and 52.  
No patients ever tested positive for inhibitory enzyme activity throughout the study. 
Additional laboratory tests for moderate, severe, or recurrent infusion-associated reactions suggestive 
of hypersensitivity reaction 
Six patients were tested for both complement activation and serum tryptase; 4 patients tested positive 
for complement activation and all serum tryptase results were within the normal range (≤12.5 μg/L). 
Eight patients were tested for anti-rhGAA IgE antibodies and all were negative. 
Circulating immune complex 
In  the  event  that  a  patient  exhibited  evidence  of  symptoms  suggestive  of  immune  complex  disease 
(eg,  proteinuria),  circulating  immune  complex  was  tested.  No  patients  were  tested  for  circulating 
immune complexes. 
Laboratory parameters 
Individual patient changes in laboratory values  
Chemistry 
Laboratory  assessment  shift  from  baseline  in  normality  status  for  chemistry  values  is  summarized  in 
16-2-8-clin-lab-data [Table 14.3.4.1.2]. 
For selected laboratory assessments, little change was observed from Week 26 to Week 52 in results 
classified  by  the  central  lab  to  be  at  the  panic  level  or  requiring  notifying  the  site  or  patient  by 
telephone  call:  ALT  (Week  26:  63,  Week  52:  64),  alkaline  phosphatase  (AP)  (Week  26:  0,  Week  52: 
1), AST (Week 26: 70, Week 52: 71), calcium (Week 26: 1, Week 52: 1), CK (Week 26: 73, Week 52: 
71), CK-MB (Week 26: 0, Week 52: 0), GGT (Week 26: 3, Week 52: 3), LDH (Week 26: 47, Week 52: 
52), and serum glucose (Week 26: 0, Week 52: 0). 
Hematology 
Laboratory  assessment  shift  from  baseline  in  normality  status  for  hematology  assessments  is 
summarized in 16-2-8-clin-lab-data [Table 14.3.4.1.4]. 
Results for selected hematology assessments were classified by the central lab to be at the panic level 
or  requiring  notifying  the  site  or  patient  by  telephone  call:  hemoglobin  (Week  26:  0,  Week  52:  0),

leukocytes (Week 26: 2, Week 52: 3), neutrophils (Week 26: 0, Week 52: 0), and platelet (Week 26: 
1, Week 52: 1). 
Urinalysis 
Laboratory  assessment  shift  from  baseline  in  normality  status  is  summarized  in  16-2-8-clin-lab-data 
[Table 14.3.4.1.6]. 
No urinalysis results were classified by the central lab to be at the panic level or requiring notifying the 
site or patient by telephone call at Week 52. 
Individual clinically relevant abnormalities in laboratory values 
Chemistry 
Elevated  levels  of  creatine  kinase  (CK),  creatine  kinase  muscle-brain  isoform  (CK-MB),  aspartate 
transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) have been observed in untreated infantile-onset 
Pompe  patients  (van  den  Hout,  2003,  Pediatrics),  and  are  consistent  with  the  underlying  muscle 
disease, and are not related to liver pathology. Study patients typically exhibited abnormal values for 
selected laboratory assessments (ALT, AST, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase). 
Chemistry laboratory results reaching panic values or requiring immediate notification were reported as 
an SAE in 1 patient. Patient’s 10655000 AST values were at immediate notification levels at screening 
and  at  Week  26  and  increased  to  high  panic  level  at  Weeks  36  and  52.  The  SAE  was  not  related  to 
alglucosidase alfa treatment, which were assessed as unlikely related to alglucosidase alfa treatment. 
The patient had SAEs of ALT increased, GGT increased, and blood albumin decreased at the same time, 
which  were  assessed  as  not  related  to  alglucosidase  alfa  treatment.  These  laboratory  values  did  not 
reach immediate notification or high panic levels. 
Chemistry laboratory results reaching panic values or requiring immediate notification were reported as 
non-serious AEs in 8 patients:

Hematology 
Hematology laboratory results reaching panic values or requiring immediate notification were reported 
as non-serious AEs in 3 patients: 
- For a patient, neutrophil and leukocyte values reached immediate notification level at Week 26, and 
the patient had non-serious AEs of neutrophil count increased and white blood cell count increased at 
the same time. Both events resolved and were considered unlikely related to study drug. 
-  For  a  patient,  elevated platelets  were  at  immediate  notification  levels  at  screening  and  at  Week  26 
and  hematocrit  and  hemoglobin  were  at  low  panic  levels  at  Week  26.  The  patient  had  a  non-serious 
AEs of platelet count increased and hemoglobin decreased on Day 183 and a non-serious AE of anemia 
on Day 19. The 3 events were considered not related to the study drug and were recorded as ongoing. 
- For a patient, decreased neutrophils were at low telephone notification levels at Week 26. The patient 
had  a  non-serious  AE  of  mild  neutropenia  on  Day  190  that  was  considered  not  related  to  the  study 
drug and was recorded as ongoing. 
Urinalysis 
For  2  patients,  AEs  of  elevated  urine  creatinine  were  reported:  (Week  52),  (Week  52),  and  another 
patient  (Week  38).  All  events  were  assessed  as  being  mild  in  severity  and  unlikely  related  to 
alglucosidase alfa treatment. 
A  non-serious  AE  of  proteinuria  was  reported  in  a  patient  at  Week  38  (mild  in  severity  and  unlikely 
related to alglucosidase treatment). The event was recorded as not resolved. 
A  non-serious  AE  of  protein  urine  was  reported  in  a  patient  at  Week  104  (mild  in  severity  and  not 
related to alglucosidase treatment). The event was recorded as not resolved. 
A non-serious AE of protein urine present was reported in a patient at Week 131 (mild in severity and 
unlikely related to alglucosidase treatment). The event was recorded as not resolved. 
Vital signs, physical findings, and other safety observations 
Vital signs 
At  Week  52,  mean  changes  from  baseline  (standard  deviation,  number  of  patients)  were:  diastolic 
blood pressure 3.0 mmHg (12.46, n = 99), systolic blood pressure 2.5 mmHg (15.07, n = 99), heart 
rate -2.9 beats/min (19.48, n = 99), respiratory rate 1.0 breaths/min (7.01, n = 99), and temperature 
0.0°C (0.54, n = 95).

Physical exam 
Physical  examination  findings  are  listed  by  patient  in  16-2-7-other-safety  [Listing  16.2.8.1].  Height 
and weight are summarized by study visit in [Table 14.3.5.2.1] and listed in [Listing 16.2.8.2]. 
Electrocardiogram results 
Of  the  36  patients  who  had  normal  ECG  values  at  baseline,  23  had  normal  values  at  Week  52.  Nine 
patients  with  initially  abnormal  but  not  clinically  significant  results  at  baseline  and  6  patients  with 
clinically  significant  abnormal  results  at  baseline  showed  normal  ECG  results  at  Week  52.  Three 
patients  had  abnormal  values  that  were  not  considered  clinically  significant  and  10  patients  had 
clinically  significant  abnormalities  at  Week  52.  In  addition,  3  of  13  patients  who  had  abnormal  ECG 
values that were not clinically significant at baseline and 25 of 35 patients who had clinically significant 
abnormalities at baseline had abnormal values at Week 52.  
Adverse events associated with abnormal ECG findings are presented in the TEAE section. Arrhythmias 
may  persist  in  Pompe  disease  patients  despite  improvement  in  cardiomyopathy  and  the  conduction 
system while receiving enzyme replacement therapy (McDowell R, 2008). They may, at least in part, 
be  related  to  myocardial  fibrosis  and/or  ventricular remodeling  associated  with  progressive long-term 
pathological changes in the heart (Prater SN, 2012). 
CHMP comments on safety:  
One of the objectives of study AGLU09411 was to determine the safety and immunogenicity profile of 
alglucosidase alfa produced at the 4000 L scale. 
The  safety  population  of  study  AGLU09411  included  113  patients,  all  previously  treated  with 
alglucosidase  alfa  at  the  160L  scale.  When  clinically  feasible,  patients  continued  to  be  treated  at  the 
same dose and dose regimen (every week or every other week) used for their routine treatment with 
160  L  alglucosidase  alfa  prior  to  screening  and  remained  on  a  stable  dose  for  the  duration  of  the 
treatment period. 
One  hundred  patients  (88.5%)  completed  the  study.  There  were  no  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation 
from the study. Six patients (5.3%) died during the study due to disease progression.  
Two  patients  (2.9-year-old  female  and  5.7-year-old  male  infantile-onset  Pompe  patients)  temporarily 
received treatment with alglucosidase alfa 160L. However, the precise reasons for treatment switching 
and the consequences of the action taken in these two patients remain unclear.  
No clear explanation has been found in the following case narratives which described in the 1st patient:  
- SAEs of abdominal pain, diarrhoea and dehydration (thereafter “The patient’s alglucosidase alfa 4000 
L treatment was switched to alglucosidase alfa 160 L on 27 June 2012 [Week 11]”);  
- SAEs of dyspnea and oxygen saturation decreased (thereafter “The alglucosidase alfa 4000 L infusion 
was restarted on 18 October 2012 [Week 27]”) 
No mention regarding the switch has been retrieved in the case narratives for SAEs in the 2nd patient. 
The MAH is requested to discuss about these aspects. 
All  patients  experienced  AEs.  A  total  of  2752  AEs  were  reported  during  the  52-week  study.  The 
majority  of  AEs  were  non-serious  (89.6%  of  total  AEs),  assessed  as  mild  to  moderate  in  severity 
(95.5%),  and  unrelated  to  the  treatment  (93.9%).  Thirty-eight  patients  (33.6%  of  total  patients)

experienced  168  AEs  (6.1%  of  total  AEs)  that  were  assessed  by  the  investigator  as  related  to 
alglucosidase  alfa,  of  which  the  most  common  was  pyrexia.  Regardless  of  causality,  AEs  belonged  to 
the  main  following  SOCs:  Infections  and  infestations  (23.0%),  Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal 
disorders  (15.1%),  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (14.1%),  and  General  disorders  and  administration  site 
conditions (13.5%).  
One hundred and forty-nine treatment-related AEs (88.7%) were characterized as IARs in 35 patients 
(31.0%).  The  majority  of  treatment-related  IARs  were  non-serious,  all  were  mild  or  moderate  in 
severity; among the 35 patients who experienced treatment-related IARs 29 recovered, 1 patient was 
recovering and 5 patients did not recover with AEs reported as ongoing (including 1 patient who also 
had resolved AE of worsening ptosis with sequelae).  
No  specific  trend  in  the  occurrence  of  AEs  with  alglucosidase  alfa  4000L  by  6-month  time  interval, 
infusion time period or gender subgroup was found. Events across age categories were consistent with 
the  manifestations  and  complications  of  the  underlying  Pompe  disease  or  the  known  safety  profile  of 
alglucosidase  alfa  in  this  patient  population.  Analysis  of  AEs  by  dosing  regimen  did  not  reveal  any 
meaningful  differences  in  the  types  of  AEs  experienced  but  no  conclusion  could  be  drawn  since  few 
patients  were  included  in  the  10  mg/kg  Weekly  (n=1),  20  mg/kg  Weekly  (n=13),  30  mg/kg  qow 
(n=3), and 30 mg/kg Weekly (n=1) regimens. 
Four  cases  of  anaphylactic/allergic  reactions  (characterized  as  IARs)  were  reported  but  1  patient 
experienced an IAR of erythema which was not considered to be an allergic reaction.  
No patients were identified to have experienced an immune-mediated reaction. 
There was no treatment-related case of hearing loss. 
Five out of 77 patients at baseline who were seropositive for anti-rhGAA IgG antibodies had sustained 
and elevated IgG titres. 
The  small  number  of  patients  having  sustained  high  antibody  titers  or  testing  positive  for  inhibitory 
antibodies, prevent from drawing any definite conclusion on AEs by immunogenicity parameters. There 
was  no  consistent  relationship  between  incidence  of  AEs,  SAEs,  and  IARs  when  stratified  by 
seroconversion status and the quartiles of peak IgG titer. Considering that only 2 patients experiencing 
IARs  seroconverted,  we  concur  that  no  conclusions  can  be  made  regarding  the  relationship  between 
time to seroconversion and onset of IARs. No consistent relationship between titer levels, peak titers, 
and occurrence of IARs has been evidenced. 
There  was  one  case  of  enzyme  uptake  inhibition  at  3  timepoints,  and  no  patient  tested  positive  for 
enzyme activity inhibition. IgE testing was performed in 8 patients, which was negative. Complement 
activation and serum tryptase testing were performed in 6 patients, of which 4 patients tested positive 
for  complement  activation  and  all  serum  tryptase  results  were  normal.  No  patients  were  tested  for 
circulating immune complexes. 
No  concerning  trends  in  laboratory  parameters,  vital  signs,  physical  exam  and  ECG  parameters  have 
been identified. 
Based  on  the  data  provided  by  the  MAH  dealing  with  the  final  results  of  study  AGLU09411,  no  new 
safety  concerns  have  been  identified  with  alglucosidase  alfa  at  the  4000L  scale  as  compared  to 
previous studies and experiences in infantile- and late-onset Pompe patients treated with alglucosidase 
alfa  160  L  at  a  dose  of  20  mg/kg  qow.  However,  the  MAH  should  provide  clarifications  on  the 
underlying reasons for switching temporarily 2 patients from alglucosidase alfa 4000L to 160 L during 
the study and the consequences in these patients.

The  assessment  of  AEs  by  immunogenicity  parameters  is  hampered  by  the  small  number  of  patients 
having sustained high antibody titers or tested for other immunogenicity parameters.  
Regarding  patients  who  received  other  dosing  regimen,  no  relevant  comparative  assessment  of  AEs 
frequency  and  immunogenicity  could  be  made  due  to  the  small  number  of  patients  included  in  these 
groups. 
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  data  submitted  by  the  MAH  is  an  observational  study  without  comparator  arm  and  non  a  priori 
formal hypothesis testing. The aim of this study was to assess efficacy and safety of a treatment with 
alglucosidase  alfa  produced  at  the  4000  L  scale  in  patients  previously  treated  with  160  L  scale 
alglucosidase alfa. 
Due  to  the  design  of  study  AGLU07510  which  included  any  patient  aged  over  1  year  with  Pompe 
disease  previously  treated  with  alglucosidase  alfa  produced  at  the  160  L  scale,  the  gross  motor, 
respiratory and cardiac functions at baseline in the study population were heterogeneous. 
The  majority  of  patients  (84.0%)  were  under  the  age  of  8  years  at  the  time  of  first  infusion  with 
alglucosidase alfa 4000L and 63.7% received alglucosidase alfa 160L treatment prior to 1 year of age. 
Regarding the primary endpoint, it appears that 83.7% of patients (87/104 patients; 95% CI: 75.1%, 
90.2%) transitioned to treatment with 4000L scale alglucosidase alfa were clinically stable or improved 
at  Week  52.  The  most  frequent  reason  for  decline  was  GMFM  decreased  ≥8%  (12  of  90  patients 
[13.3%]).  Nevertheless,  due  to  the  patients’  age  and  dependency  on  invasive  ventilation,  pulmonary 
function testing could not be performed and majority of echocardiography data are incomplete.  
Thus, given the absence of comparative arm and the heterogeneity of the population at baseline it is 
difficult to draw any firm conclusion on this study. Moreover no comparison of those results to previous 
clinical trials and no extrapolation to all subtypes of Pompe disease can be done. 
During AGLU09411 study, treatment-related AEs (mainly IARs) were reported in 38 out of 113 patients 
treated with alglucosidase alfa produced at the 4000 L scale. Based on the data provided by the MAH 
regarding  the  final  results  of  study  AGLU07510,  no  new  safety  concerns  have  been  identified  as 
compared to previous studies and experiences in infantile- and late-onset Pompe patients treated with 
alglucosidase alfa 160 L at a dose of 20 mg/kg qow. However, the MAH should provide clarifications on 
the  underlying  reasons  for  switching  temporarily  2  patients  from  alglucosidase  alfa  4000L  to  160  L 
during the study and the consequences in these patients.  
The  assessment  of  AEs  by  immunogenicity  parameters  is  hampered  by  the  small  number  of  patients 
having  sustained  high  antibody  titers  or  tested  for  other  immunogenicity  parameters,  which  prevent 
from any definite conclusion.  
Regarding  patients  who  received  other  dosing  regimen,  no  relevant  comparative  assessment  of  AEs 
frequency and immunogenicity could be drawn, due to the small number of patients included in these 
groups.

2.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled 
Due  to  the  design  of  study  AGLU07510,  the  absence  of  comparative  arm,  the  heterogeneity  of  the 
population  at  baseline  no firm  conclusion  can  be  drawn  on  this  study  and  to  compare  those  result to 
previous clinical trials and extrapolate them to all subtypes of Pompe disease. 
Based on the data provided by the MAH regarding the final results of study AGLU07510, no new safety 
concerns have been identified as compared to previous studies and experiences in infantile- and late-
onset Pompe patients treated with alglucosidase alfa 160 L at a dose of 20 mg/kg qow. The additional 
clarifications  provided  on  the  underlying  reasons  for  switching  temporarily  2  patients  from 
alglucosidase  alfa  4000L  to  160  L  during  the  study  and  the  consequences  in  these  patients  did  not 
raise any new safety concern.  
Due  to  the  small  number  of  patients  having  sustained  high  antibody  titers  or  tested  for  other 
immunogenicity  parameters,  no  definite  conclusion  could  be  drawn  regarding  AEs  by  immunogenicity 
parameters.  As  regards  patients  who  received  other  dosing  regimen,  no  relevant  comparative 
assessment  of  AEs  frequency  and  immunogenicity  could  be  performed,  due  to  the  small  number  of 
patients included in these groups. 
3.  Additional clarification requested 
The  MAH  should  discuss  about  the  underlying  reasons  for  switching  temporarily  2  patients  from 
alglucosidase  alfa  4000L  to  160  L  during  the  study  and  the  consequences  in  these  patients  as  the 
reporting information in the corresponding case narratives remains unclear on these aspects. 
MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
Both  patients  (10015011  and  10585007)  received  temporary  treatment  with  alglucosidase  alfa  160L 
while enrolled in the ADVANCE study (AGLU09411). The treatment change was based on requests by 
the  investigator  and  in  accordance  with  the  study  protocol  rescue  criteria:  if  a  patient  experienced 
clinical  worsening  as  defined  by  the  primary  efficacy  objective  that  is  sustained  on  repeated 
measurement,  the  patient  may  be  managed  per  the  discretion  of  the  Investigator  which  may  include 
return to treatment with 160 L alglucosidase alfa.  
As  noted  in  the  final  clinical  study  report,  Patient  10015011  was  enrolled  in  the  ADVANCE  study 
(AGLU09411)  and  initiated  alglucosidase  alfa  4000  L  treatment  on  12  April  2012.  The  investigator 
requested  a  switch  in  treatment  after  reporting  related  serious  adverse  event  (SAE)  of  diarrhoea.  
However,  the  patient  had  a  relevant  medical  history  of  recurrent  Clostridium  difficile  colitis,  fecal 
transplant,  bloody  stools,  gastric  dysmotility,  recurrent  constipation  and  recurrent  diarrhea,  that 
provides an alternate explanation for the reported events. Furthermore, according to Data Safety and 
Monitoring  Board,  there  were  multiple  alternative  explanations  for  the  patient’s  diarrhea,  including 
recurrent C. difficile infections and post gastroenteritis feeding intolerance. Patient received treatment 
with alglucosidase alfa 160 L from 27 June 2012 to 11 October 2012. The patient was again returned 
to treatment with alglucosidase alfa 4000 L on 18 October 2012 per request of the Investigator. After 
switching back to 4000 L patient continued in the study till 11 September 2014.  
Patient  10585007  was  enrolled  in  the  ADVANCE  study  (AGLU09411)  and  received  his  first  infusion  of 
alglucosidase alfa 4000 L treatment on 16 April 2012. The investigator requested a switch in treatment

to 160 L after reporting 2 related SAEs of worsening of gross motor function decline and non-serious 
related  events  of  right  ventricular  hypertrophy,  abnormal  electrocardiogram  and  heart  valve 
incompetence.  The  patient  had  a  relevant  medical  history  of  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy,  invasive 
mechanical  ventilation,  bilateral  diaphragmatic  palsy  and  supraventricular  tachycardia.  The  patient 
received  treatment  with  alglucosidase  alfa  160  L  from  04  August  2014  to  20  October  2014.  All  the 
above  mentioned  AEs  remained  ongoing  till  the  study  end  even  after  switching  to  alglucosidase  alfa 
160 L treatment. The patient was switched back to the commercially available alglucosidase alfa 4000 
L  when  the  ADVANCE  study  (AGLU09411)  was  terminated  following  approval  of  alglucosidase  alfa 
4000L in the US for all Pompe patients. 
In conclusion, as discussed above, both patients switched treatment based on investigator request and 
in  accordance  with  the  rescue  criteria  outlined  in  the  ADVANCE  study  (AGLU09411)  clinical  study 
protocol. The benefit –risk assessment of alglucosidase alfa was not affected by the above 2 cases and 
the  safety  profile  of  alglucosidase  alfa  4000  L  observed  in  this  study  is  consistent  with  the  previous 
alglucosidase alfa experience as described in the alglucosidase alfa product labels.

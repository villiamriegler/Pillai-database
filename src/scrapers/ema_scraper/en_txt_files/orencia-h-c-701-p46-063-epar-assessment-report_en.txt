1.  Introduction 
On 29 January 2019, the MAH submitted a clinical study report and a clinical study report addendum 
related  to  a  completed  paediatric  study  (study  number  IM101365)  for  ORENCIA,  in  accordance  with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended. 
The MAH had issued a CSR for study IM101365 in December 2016 to support a supplemental Japanese 
New  Drug  Application  in  Juvenile  Idiopathic  Arthritis  (JIA);  the  CSR  summarised  results  based  on  a 
1-year  data  cut-off  (52  weeks  from  last  patient  first  treatment)  up  to  a  database  lock  in  September 
2016. The study continued after the September 2016 database lock and was closed on 30 July 2018. A 
CSR  addendum  was  prepared,  summarising  the  results  during  the  cumulative  period  up  to  the  July 
2018  database  lock.  The  current  submission  includes  both  CSR’s  [Study  IM101365  CSR  (1-year  data 
cutoff  -  September  2016  database  lock);  Study  IM101365  CSR  addendum  (cumulative  period  -  July 
2018 database lock)]. 
A clinical expert overview, summarising the results of the study, was also provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study number IM101365, entitled “A Phase III, Multicenter, Open-Label Study to 
Assess  Efficacy,  Safety,  Pharmacokinetics  and 
Immunogenicity  of  Abatacept  Administered 
Intravenously in Japanese Children and Adolescents with Active Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Who Have 
a  History  of  an  Inadequate  Response  or  Intolerance  to  Methotrexate  or  Biologics”  is  a  stand  alone 
study. 
The  MAH  stated  that,  in  accordance  with  Article  16(2)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004,  the  data 
submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance for ORENCIA and therefore do not require further 
regulatory action to be taken on the marketing authorisation for this product. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The  study  product  was  Abatacept  for  IV  infusion,  250  mg/vial.  Before  use,  the  product  was 
reconstituted with 10 mL of sterile water for injection or normal saline.

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study IM101365 
Description 
Study IM11365 was a Phase 3 non-comparative (single arm), open label, multicenter study to evaluate 
the  efficacy,  safety,  pharmacokinetics  and  immunogenicity  of  IV  abatacept  in  Japanese  children  and 
adolescents  with  active  JIA  and  a  history  of  an  inadequate  response  or  intolerance  to  methotrexate 
(MTX)  or  biologics.  The  study  comprised  a  16-week  short-term  (ST)  period,  followed  by  a  long-term 
(LT) period of variable duration. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  the  primary  efficacy  as  assessed  by  American  College  of 
Rheumatology  Pediatric  (ACR  Ped)  30  response  rate  at  Week  16  (Day  113)  in  Japanese  active  JIA 
subjects. 
Secondary objectives were to assess the following after the 16-week ST period: 
•  ACR Ped 50, ACR Ped 70, ACR Ped 90 response rates and inactive disease rate 
• 
Physical  function  as  measured  by  the  disability  index  of  the  Childhood  Health  Assessment 
Questionnaire (CHAQ) 
•  Safety and tolerability 
• 
• 
Pharmacokinetics 
Immunogenicity 
Exploratory objectives were to assess: 
•  ACR Ped 30, 50, 70, 90 response rates and the inactive disease rate in the ST + LT period of 
the study. 
•  Changes of the JIA Core Set Variables (ACR Pediatric components) in the ST + LT period of the 
study. 
•  Remission rate, minimal disease activity rate and the change from baseline in disease activity 
as measured by the Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score 27 (JADAS27)-CRP in the ST + LT 
• 
• 
•

Study design 
The study was a non-comparative, open label study, comprising a screening period, a 16 week short-
term (ST) period, followed by a long-term (LT) period that was to end when the product was approved 
in Japan (hence the variable duration of the LT period). See Figure 1 for a graphical depiction. 
Figure 1. Study design 
In  the  ST  period,  IV  abatacept  was  to  be  administered  as  combination  therapy  with  MTX  or  as 
monotherapy. The dose of MTX  was to be  stable in  the ST period. After completion of the ST period, 
subjects  were  to  enter  the  LT  period  automatically  and  continue  to  receive  open-label  IV  abatacept 
until  IV  abatacept  is  approved  for  the  indication  of  JIA  or  until  the  MAH  elects  to  terminate 
development for the indication of JIA. During the ST and the LT period, non-biologic DMARDs (except 
MTX)  and  biologics  were prohibited;  minimum  wash-out  for  biologics  was  5  terminal  half-lives  before 
first dose of study medication. Stable low doses of oral corticosteroids and NSAIDs (oral formulations 
and rectal suppositories) were permitted in the ST period. 
Subjects who discontinued abatacept prematurely in the ST or LT period, or completed the LT period, 
were  to  have  follow-up  visits  at  28,  84  and  168  days  after  the  last  dose  of  study  drug.  If  a  subject 
started  commercial  abatacept  after  completion  of  the  LT  period,  the  follow-up  period  was  considered 
completed at the start of commercial abatacept; subjects switching to commercial abatacept during the 
LT period were not permitted to enter the follow-up period. 
According to the MAH, the study design was selected based on the efficacy of abatacept already having 
been  demonstrated  in  a  global  JIA  study  (IM101033),  whereby  it  was  considered  unethical  to 
randomise  subjects  to  placebo,  as  well  as  on  local  feasibility  considerations.  Its  main  aim  was  to 
compare results with the global study IM101033 and thus enable bridging between Japanese and non-
Japanese patients. The study design was based on a formal consultation with the Japanese PMDA. 
Study population /Sample size 
Key inclusion criteria for subjects were: 
•  Male or female, age 4 to 17 years (inclusive) at enrolment. 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/191269/2019  
Page 5/16 
 
 
 
 
•  Diagnosis  of  JIA  by  International  League  of  Associations  for  Rheumatology  (ILAR)  criteria  of 
one  of  the  following  types:  oligoarticular;  polyarticular  rheumatoid  factor  positive  (RF+); 
polyarticular rheumatoid factor negative (RF-); or systemic with a polyarticular-course. 
•  A history of an inadequate therapeutic response or intolerance, in the opinion of the examining 
physician, to at least one biologic or MTX. 
•  A  history  of  at  least  5  joints  with  active  disease  and  active  articular  disease  at  enrolment  as 
defined by: 
o  2 or more active joints (e.g. presence of swelling, or if no swelling is present, limitation 
of motion (LOM) accompanied by pain, tenderness, or both) at screening and at Day 1 
(Week 0). 
o  2 or more joints with LOM at screening and at Day 1 (Week 0). 
(The same joint could separately meet the definition of an active joint and a joint with LOM) 
Key exclusion criteria were: 
•  Systemic  onset  JIA  with  any  of  the  following  manifestations  within  the  last  6  months  prior  to 
enrolment:  intermittent  fever  due  to  JIA,  rheumatoid  rash,  hepatosplenomegaly,  pleuritis, 
pericarditis, or macrophage activation syndrome. 
• 
Presence of any other rheumatic disease or major chronic infectious/inflammatory/immunologic 
disease 
(e.g. 
inflammatory  bowel  disease,  psoriatic  arthritis,  spondyloarthropathy, 
hypogammaglobulinemia, or systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.) 
The planned number of subjects to be treated was 20. Of these 20 subjects, 3 subjects were to have a 
history of use of biologic therapies, and 5 subjects were to be treated with abatacept monotherapy in 
the ST period. The sample size was determined based on regional operational feasibility, and there was 
no  formal  statistical  hypothesis  for  this  study.  In  the  global  JIA  study  IM101033,  ACR  Ped  30  (CRP) 
response rate had been 63.7%, and based on an assumption of a 65% ACR Ped 30 response rate, the 
chosen sample size would provide a two sided exact 95% confidence interval (CI) of 40.8% to 84.6%. 
Treatments 
The dose of abatacept was based on weight at each study visit and tiered as follows: 
•  < 75 kg: 10 mg/kg 
•  75 to 100 kg: 750 mg 
•  >100 kg: 1000 mg 
Abatacept  was  administered  on  Day  1  (Week  0),  Day  15  (Week  2),  Day  29  (Week  4)  and  every 
28 days thereafter for the duration of the study. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  endpoint  was  the  ACR  Ped  30  response  rate  at  Day  113.  ACR  Ped  30  response  was 
defined as meeting both of the following: 
• 
• 
≥ 30% improvement in at least 3 of the 6 JIA core set variables 
≥ 30% worsening in no more than 1 of the 6 JIA core set variables

Secondary endpoints were: 
•  ACR Ped 50, 70, 90 response rates and inactive disease rate at Week 16 (Day 113) 
• 
The  disability  index  of  the  Childhood  Health  Assessment  Questionnaire  (CHAQ)  at  Week  16 
(Day 113) 
•  Safety (proportion of subjects with AEs, deaths, SAEs, and AEs of special interest) during the 
ST period 
• 
• 
Pharmacokinetics (Cmax and Ctrough) during the ST period 
Immunogenicity positive rates during the ST period 
Exploratory endpoints were: 
•  ACR  Ped  30,  50,  70,  90  response  rates  and  inactive  disease  rate,  overall  period  (ST  +  LT 
period) of the study 
•  Changes from baseline of individual ACR pediatric components, including the disability index of 
the CHAQ, overall period (ST + LT period) of the study 
•  Remission rate, minimal disease activity rate and the change from baseline in disease activity 
as measured by JADAS27-CRP, overall period (ST + LT period) of the study 
• 
• 
Long-term safety summary (proportion of subjects with AEs, deaths, SAEs, and AEs of special 
interest), overall period (ST + LT period) of the study 
Immunogenicity positive rates during treatment and up to 6 months following discontinuation 
•  Assessment  of  anti-GAD  and  anti-TPO  auto-antibodies  and  TSH  during  treatment  and  up  to 
6 months following discontinuation 
Statistical Methods 
The various response rates were computed with their respective two sided exact 95% CI. Summaries 
were provided for both the ST period  and the cumulative period (ST + LT period) of the study. For the 
ST period analyses, an ACR non-responder status was imputed for prematurely discontinued subjects 
for  all  post-discontinuation  visits  up  to  Day  113.  Analyses  of  the  cumulative  period  were  based  on 
observed data. 
All efficacy analyses were  descriptive, and no formal statistical testing took place. CIs  for proportions 
were computed using an exact method based on the binominal distribution. 
CHMP comment: 
It is understood that the study design and conduct were based on local considerations and needs; the 
study  thus  can  be  accepted  as  a  supplementary,  bridging  piece  of  evidence  within  a  global 
development  program  rather  than  a  formal  attempt  to  provide  proof  of  efficacy  or  safety  within  a 
study.  The  global  study  IM101033  was  a  randomised  withdrawal  study  and  the  design  thus  differs 
fundamentally  from  study  IM101365;  detailed  comparison  of  results  is  therefore  deemed  beyond  the 
scope of the current assessment.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A  total  of  23  subjects  were  enrolled  and  20  subjects  were  treated.  Of  the  20  subjects  treated, 
4 subjects had a history of biologics use, and 4 subjects were treated with abatacept monotherapy. 
Baseline data 
The age range of enrolled subjects was 5 - 16 years, and the majority were female. Mean duration of 
disease was 1.9 years, and most subjects had polyarticular JIA. Table 1 summarises the demographic 
characteristics, and Table 2 summarises baseline disease characteristics.

Table 2. Baseline disease characteristics 
CHMP comment: 
The  study  population  in  study  IM101365  is  not  entirely  comparable  to  that  in  the  global  study 
IM101033;  for  example,  the  population  in  IM101365  was  slightly  younger  (median  age  10.5  years 
compared  to  13  years  in  the  global  study),  had  a  shorter  disease  history  (mean  duration  1.91  years 
compared  to  4.4  years)  and  fewer  joints  with  active  disease  (mean  number  of  active  joints:  7.1  vs. 
16.2). Polyarticular disease types, either RF+ or RF-, were most common in both studies. 
The differences notwithstanding, the recruited sample in itself can be considered representative of JIA 
for purposes of evaluation of safety and efficacy. 
Efficacy results 
Short-Term Period 
At Day 113 (Week 16), 90% of subjects (18/20 subjects, exact 95% CI: 68.3, 98.8) met the ACR Ped 
30  response  criteria.  The  proportions  of  subjects  meeting  the  other  ACR  Ped  responder  criteria  are 
depicted in Table 3.

Table 3. Proportion of subjects meeting ARC Ped response criteria - Day 113 
The  median  percent  improvement  in  CHAQ-DI  from  baseline  to  Day  113  was  43%;  median  percent 
improvement  in  the  Physician  Global  Assessment  was  81%,  and  median  percent  improvement  in  the 
Parent Global Assessment was 57%. 
Cumulative Period 
In  general,  the  response  was  maintained  over  longer  periods  of  time;  for  illustrative  purposes,  the 
proportions  of  subjects  meeting  the  various  ACR  Ped  responder  criteria  at  12  months  and 
approximately 26 months of follow-up are displayed in Tables 4 and 5.

Table 5. Proportion of subjects meeting ARC Ped response criteria - 26 months follow up 
Corresponding  decreases  were  seen  with  JADAS27-CRP;  at  Month  12,  78%  of  subjects  had  minimal 
disease activity and 50% of subjects were in remission, and at Month 26, 94% of subjects had minimal 
disease activity and 75% of subjects were in remission. 
Results consistent with maintenance of effect in the longer term were also seen on other exploratory 
endpoints; median percent improvements from baseline to Month 12 and Month 26 of follow-up were 
reported  as  80%  and  67%  for  CHAQ-DI,  97%  and  100%  for  Physician  Global  Assessment,  and  78% 
and 85% for Parent Global Assessment, respectively. 
Safety results 
Subject Disposition 
Overall subject disposition is given in Table 6. Of the 4 subjects who discontinued during the LT period, 
the reasons for the discontinuation were subject request in 1 subject and lack of efficacy in 3 subjects. 
The subject who discontinued study medication due to her request did not wish to enter the follow-up 
period. Overall, 5 subjects (3 who had discontinued and 2 who had completed the LT period) entered 
the follow-up period and all 5 completed the follow-up period. A total of 14 subjects who completed the 
LT period did not enter the follow-up period because they were switched to commercial abatacept after 
the product was approved in Japan.

Extent of Exposure 
In the cumulative period, the median duration of exposure to IV abatacept was 42.1 months (range: 7-
54 months), and the median number of abatacept infusions was 45 (range: 8-58). 
Adverse Events 
A summary of the adverse event data is presented in Table 7. In the cumulative period, all 20 subjects 
experienced  at  least  one  AE.  AEs  that  occurred  in  4  or  more  subjects  were  nasopharyngitis 
(17 subjects);  pharyngitis  (12  subjects);  influenza  (10  subjects);  stomatitis,  headache,  and  ligament 
sprain  (7  subjects  each);  upper  respiratory  tract  inflammation  and  contusion  (6  subjects  each); 
bronchitis,  diarrhoea,  acne,  arthralgia  and  seasonal  allergy  (5  subjects  each);  gastroenteritis,  upper 
respiratory tract infection, nausea and pyrexia (4 subjects each). Severe or very severe AEs were not 
reported  in  the  cumulative  period,  except  for  a  severe  gastroenteritis  in  1  subject  (described  below 
within section on SAEs). No deaths and no discontinuations due to an AE were reported.

Table 7. Summary of adverse events during the cumulative period 
A  total  of  8  SAEs  in  6  subjects  were  reported  in  the  study  (Table  8);  among  these,  2  SAEs  in  one 
subject  were  deemed  related  to  study  drug.  These  SAEs  concerned  two  occurrences  of  acute 
gastroenteritis in one subject. The first episode, with onset on Day 21 and a  duration of 3 days,  was 
deemed  mild.  The  second  episode,  with  onset  on  Day  362  and  a  duration  of  4  days,  was  deemed 
severe. No action with study medication was taken on either occasion.

The  MAH  defined  infections,  malignancies,  autoimmune  disorders,  and  infusion  reactions  as  AEs  of 
special interest (AESI) and assessed these through pre-specified MedDRA queries: 
• 
Infections  were  reported  in  all  20  subjects  in  the  cumulative  period.  The  most  common 
infections  were  nasopharyngitis  in  17  subjects,  followed  by  pharyngitis  in  12  subjects  and 
influenza in 10 subjects. Apart from the case of severe gastroenteritis (described above within 
section  on  SAEs),  no  other  severe  or  very  severe  infections  were  reported  in  the  cumulative 
period. 
•  No malignancies were reported in the study. 
• 
In  total,  an  autoimmune  disorder  was  reported  in  3  subjects  during  the  cumulative  period 
(alopecia areata in 1 subject and JIA in 2 subjects). Alopecia areata was mild in intensity and 
considered as unrelated to study medication. 
•  One acute infusional AE (i.e. an AESI occurring during the first hour after start of infusion) was 
reported. This was a case of mild pyrexia. 
• 
Peri-infusional AEs (i.e. AESIs occurring during the  first 24 hours after start of infusion) were 
reported in 6 subjects: nausea in 3 subjects; pyrexia in 2 subjects; injection site swelling and 
myalgia in 1 subject each. All of them were mild in intensity. Except for 1 case of nausea, the 
events were considered as unrelated to study medication. 
The  most  frequently  reported  laboratory  abnormalities  were  elevated  eosinophil  counts;  mostly 
isolated occasions of elevated eosinophils were reported in 8 subjects overall. 
During  the  cumulative  period,  2  subjects  converted from  a  negative  anti-GAD  status  at  baseline  to  a 
positive  status,  and  2  subjects  converted  from  a  negative  anti-TPO  status  at  baseline  to  a  positive 
status. No subject had abnormal TSH values during the cumulative period. 
Immunogenicity 
During  the  cumulative  period,  a  total  of  4  subjects  were  determined  as  positive  for  antibodies  to 
abatacept, CTLA4 and possibly Ig. Seropositivity was transient and of a low titer in 3 cases.  
Abatacept  concentrations  greater  than  1  ug/mL  were  present  in  the  seropositive  samples  in  3  cases, 
and neutralising antibodies could therefore only be analysed for one subject.According to the MAH, the 
presence of anti-drug antibodies appeared to have no effect on PK, safety and efficacy of abatacept. 
Pharmacokinetic results 
Serum  abatacept  Ctrough  and  Cmax  data  was  provided  for  the  ST  period.  Geometric  mean  Ctrough 
levels of abatacept increased from Day 15 to Day 29 following the IV infusion of abatacept on Days 1 
and 15, and then decreased on Day 57 following the IV infusion on Day 29 (Table 9). Geometric mean 
Ctrough  levels  appeared  to  be  at  steady  state  starting  on  Day  57  and  were  maintained  above  the 
target  therapeutic  Ctrough  level  of  10  μg/mL  during  the  ST  period;  on  Day  113,  Ctrough  level  was 
above  10  μg/mL  in  15  out  of  the  19  subjects  included  in  the  PK  analysis  population.  In  addition, 
geometric mean Cmax levels were relatively constant from Day 57 to 113 (Table 10).

The  efficacy  results  in  this  small  study  are  in  line  with  those  previously  reported  for  abatacept. 
Consistent with the small sample size, the confidence intervals for the point estimates are wide. 
The safety results are also consistent with previous experience. Infectious events are dominant within 
the  safety  data,  but  this  is  not  unexpected  and  should  also  be  viewed  in  light  of  the  long  follow-up 
periods  of  several  years  in  most  cases.  The  nature  of  the  reported  SAEs  was  consistent  with  what 
would  be  expected  in  a  corresponding  general  population,  and  SAEs  were  mostly  deemed  to  be 
unrelated to study medication. 
Based on the reported PK data, the achieved exposures were in line with expectations and comparable 
to those reported in the global study. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Both  from  an  efficacy  and  a  safety  perspective,  the  results  of  this  small  study  are  consistent  with 
previous experience and use of abatacept in the treatment of JIA. Although detailed comparisons are 
not possible due to the limited sample size in study IM101365, there seems to be no marked difference 
in the efficacy or safety profile of abatacept between a Japanese population vs. the global study that 
did not include Japanese subjects. 
Based on the results of this small paediatric study, the MAH has proposed no changes to the product 
information.  The  MAH’s  view  is  supported.  The  overall  benefit-risk  profile  of  abatacept  remains 
unchanged.

3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
The data reported in this small study is generally consistent with other data reported for ORENCIA and 
does  not  change  its  general  benefit-risk  profile.  No  changes  to  the  current  product  information  are 
warranted. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

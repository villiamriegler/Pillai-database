request and/or new mutations from literature. For each 
mutation the MAH submitted an analytical study report, 
confirming whether the tested mutations are amenable or 
non-amenable to migalastat. As a result of this variation, 
section 5.1 of the SmPC is being updated to include 66 
newly tested mutations, 15 mutations that did not qualify

the efficacy and safety of migalastat to enzyme

This variation fulfils a post approval commitment Cat

minor editorial changes to the SmPC and to update 
the contact details of some local representatives in

therapy (ERT) in patients with Fabry disease who were 
receiving ERT prior to study entry and who had a 
migalastat-responsive GLA mutation were submitted in this 
variation. These data showed a similar consistent trend on 
eGFR and LVMi/LVH under continued treatment with 
migalastat, as seen during the first 18 months of the study. 
All other secondary endpoints follow a similar trend. 
Therefore, based on the submitted data no new or 
unexpected efficacy findings were observed apart from a 
10% increase in renal events that warrants follow up 
information. Section 5.1 of the SmPC reflects these results.  
These 30 months data did not result in unexpected safety 
findings. The adverse events (AEs) reported were in line for 
what was reported in the 18 months comparative part of 
the study. Based on the overall commonly reported AEs 
“pain in the extremity” and “pain (general)” were added to 
section 4.8 of the SmPC.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This centralised application concerns a generic application according to article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
for Lenalidomide Accord 2.5mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg & 25 mg hard capsules.  
Lenalidomide has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-proliferative and antiangiogenic properties. It 
inhibits the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-12 from 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (Muller GW., et al., 1999 and 
Corral LG., et al., 1999). It also increases production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 by LPS-
stimulated PBMC and consequently inhibits the expression, but not the enzymatic activity, of cyclooxygenase-
2 (Fujita J., et al., 2001). Lenalidomide induces T-cell proliferation and IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-γ production 
(Corral LG., et al., 1999 and Schafer PH et al., 2003) and it augments cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells 
Davies (FE., et al., 2001) (Armoiry X., et al., 2008). 
The originator product is Revlimid; Lenalidomide was first approved in Europe on 14 June 2007 as Revlimid 5 
mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 25 mg (MAA No: EU/1/07/391/001-0011, Celgene Europe Limited, UK).

Revlimid as monotherapy is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed 
multiple myeloma who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation.  
Revlimid as combination therapy (see section 4.2) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant.  
Revlimid in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult 
patients who have received at least one prior therapy.  
Myelodysplastic syndromes  
Revlimid as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia 
due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with an isolated deletion 5q 
cytogenetic abnormality when other therapeutic options are insufficient or inadequate.  
Mantle cell lymphoma  
Revlimid as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle 
cell lymphoma (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
One bioequivalence (BE) study has been performed using the originator. The test product (Lenalidomide 
Accord 25 mg hard capsule, Batch number: RLCH0616A) and the reference product (Revlimid 25 mg hard 
capsule, Batch number: A2106I-A) were compared in the fasting conditions (Study No. 1605010). 
The generic Lenalinomide Accord claims only the originators indications in Multiple myeloma:  
- 
- 
- 
Lenalidomide Accord as monotherapy is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients 
with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation. 
Lenalidomide Accord as combination therapy (see section 4.2) is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant. 
Lenalidomide Accord in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of multiple 
myeloma in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy. 
The originator’s indications related to MS and MCL have not been applied for, as these indications are under 
“Orphan Market Exclusivity” until 17/06/2023 and 12/07/2026, respectively. Additionally, Celgene has a 
patent covering the MCL indication until 02/08/2027 (EP2046331). 
Lenanidomide Accord will be presented as hard capsules in the same strengths as the originator’s: 2.5mg, 5 
mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg & 25 and with the same dose and posology in the above indications.

The product is available in OPA AL PVC/aluminium foil perforated unit dose blisters in a pack size of 7x1 or 
21x1 capsules as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of lenalidomide is 3-(4-amino-1-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindol-2-yl) piperidine-2,6-dione 
corresponding to the molecular formula C 13H13N3O3. It has a relative molecular mass of 259.2 g/mol and the 
structure shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
Lenalidomide active substance is an off-white to pale yellow solid powder, non-hydroscopic, soluble in organic 
solvent/water mixtures, and buffered aqueous solvents. Lenalidomide is generally more soluble in organic 
solvents but exhibits the greatest solubility in 0.1 N HCl buffer. The solubility of lenalidomide in water and at 
pH 1.21 is <1.5 mg/mL and 18 mg/mL, respectively.  
The chemical structure of lenalidomide was elucidated and confirmed by a combination of proton nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR), carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C NMR), 
mass spectrometry (MS), infra-red spectroscopy and elemental analysis. 
Lenalidomide has an asymmetric carbon atom and can therefore exist as the optically active forms S(-) and 
R(+). Lenalidomide is produced as a racemic mixture with a net optical rotation of zero. It has been 
demonstrated, by specific optical rotation results on 3 batches, that the active substance manufacturer 
consistently produces the racemate. 
Lenalidomide exhibits polymorphism. Literature shows that lenalidomide exists in at least 8 different 
crystalline forms (Forms A-H) in addition to an amorphous form. The polymorphic form of lenalidomide active 
substance was measured by X-ray powder diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry. It has been 
demonstrated that the active substance manufacturer consistently produces the same polymorphic form. The 
polymorphic form is controlled in the final active substance via identification testing by XRPD and DSC. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of 
an ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. The ASMF holder is the single supplier of lenalidomide. A number 
of sites are involved in the manufacturing process.

Lenalidomide is synthesized in four main steps using well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications.  
During the procedure, a major objection was raised in relation to the choice of starting materials. In 
response, the applicant provided further justification of the choice of one of the starting materials. The other 
initially proposed starting material was re-designated as an intermediate and the starting material was 
redefined further upstream. The details of the justification and updated synthetic route (reaction conditions, 
times, controls etc..) are in the restricted part of the ASMF. Based on this additional information this major 
objection was resolved. 
The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been 
presented. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The characterisation of the active 
substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances.  
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. Presented 
specified process related organic impurities are well characterised by chemical name, structural formula, 
origin, specification and elucidation of structure (1H NMR, 13C NMR and MS). Potential degradation products 
of lenalidomide are described in detail.  
During the procedure, the absence of a discussion on impurities with a genotoxic potential was raised as a 
major objection. In response a detailed discussion on impurities with a genotoxic potential risk was provided. 
Lenalidomide active substance itself is known to be teratogenic. The ASMF holder provided data on potential 
genotoxic impurities in the active substance and applies an acceptable control strategy for genotoxic 
impurities by setting appropriate limits, calculated with respect to the TTC, in in-process controls, 
intermediate specifications and active substance specifications. As a result of the redefinition of the starting 
material, additional impurity characterisation studies were performed and an updated impurity control 
strategy was provided. Based on the responses and additional information provided this major objection was 
resolved. 
Information in relation to residual solvents and catalysts has been provided. Class-II solvents  used in the 
last step of the synthesis are controlled in the active substance specification. No class-1 solvents are used in 
the synthesis.  
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program, changes implemented during development were described and justified.  
The active substance packaging material has been described.s,  It complieswith the EC directive 2002/72/EC 
and EC 10/2011 as amended.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification (IR, HPLC, XRPD, DSC), 
solubility (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), related 
substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC-HS, GC), microbial limit test (Ph. Eur.) and particle 
size distribution. 
Impurities limits have been set below the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A and in line with the 
TTC according to ICH M7.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data three production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from one production scale batch of active substance stored for up to 12 months under long 
term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), and three production scale batches stored under accelerated conditions 
(40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. These batches were produced by the 
proposed manufacturer using the commercial synthetic route and were stored in the intended commercial 
package. 
Supportive stability data from three production scale batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer using a slightly different synthetic route stored in the intended commercial package for up to 
48 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
(40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were also provided. These batches are considered to be 
representative and therefore support the shelf-life, as the only difference when using different bases is an 
increase in yield without any impact on product quality. 
The stability indicating parameters as outlined in the specification above were tested. The analytical methods 
used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. All tested parameters were within the 
specifications. 
Results on stress conditions studies under acid, base, oxidation, thermal, photolytic and humidity conditions) 
were provided on one batch. Assay and degradation products were tested. Lenalidomide active substance is 
degraded under acid, base, oxidation forced degradation conditions. 
The stress stability study of lenalidomide was carried out for determination of polymorphic form under stress 
stability study. The results of polymorphic form by XRPD confirmed that lenalidomide polymorphic form is 
stable under stress condition of humidity and temperature. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period and storage conditions in the proposed 
container.

All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The main objective of the formulation development was to develop a stable and robust formulation of 
“Lenalidomide 2.5mg, 5mg, 7.5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg and 25mg hard capsules” which is essentially similar 
to reference product Revlimid® hard capsules marketed by Celgene Europe Limited, United Kingdom.  
Quality  by  Design  (QbD)  principles  were  applied  during  the  development  of  Lenalidomide  Accord  hard 
capsules. The formulation development strategy involved:  
• 
Physicochemical characterisation of reference product  
•  Risk assessment of formulation variables  
• 
• 
Formulation development 
Formula optimisation 
•  Stability studies 
•  Update of risk assessment of formulation variables 
The  quality  target  product  profile  (QTPP)  was  defined  based  on  the  properties  of  the  active  substance, 
reference  product  characterization  and  intended  patient  population  as  immediate  release  hard  capsules,  for 
oral  administration,  which  meet  the  compendial  requirements  for  relevant  quality  attributes,  with  adequate 
stability  in  the  chosen  blister  pack  container.  Pharmaceutical  development  was  focused  on  CQAs  and  how 
these were impacted by changes on formulation or manufacturing process. The CQAs identified were assay, 
content uniformity, dissolution and related substances. Risk assessment was used throughout development to 
identify risks in formulation and process variables and to determine which studies were necessary to improve 
product and process understanding to develop a suitable control strategy. The QTPP is considered appropriate 
in  view  of the  intended  use  of the  product.  The  choice  of the  CQA  that  were  studied  during  development  is 
considered reasonable. Some of the process parameters initially anticipated to have significant effect on the 
release  profile  drug  product  were  further  studied  and  found  to  have  insignificant  effect  on  the  drug  release 
characteristics.  Taking  this  under  consideration  not  all  CQAs  are  part  of  the  finished  product  specification. 
This  approach  is  justified  based  by  the  presented  development  data.  The  formulation  composition  was 
finalised based on development and optimisation studies.

A  bioequivalence  study  was  performed  of  Lenalidomide  Accord  25  mg  hard  capsule  versus  the  reference 
product, Revlimid 25 mg hard capsules. The bio-batch represents a registration (commercial) batch size and 
has  been  fully  characterised.  In  support  of  the  request  for  a  biowaiver  to  cover  the  lower  strengths  in  the 
product range, the Applicant presented comparative dissolution studies of Lenalidomide Accord hard capsules 
2.5mg,  5mg,  7.5mg,  10mg,  15mg,  20mg  with  Lenalidomide  Accord  hard  capsules  25mg.  For  all  strengths, 
more than 85% of the labelled amount of lenalidomide was released in 0.01N HCl, pH 4.5 acetate buffer and 
pH 6.8 phosphate buffer, within 15 minutes. Therefore, the dissolution profiles are considered similar without 
further  mathematical  calculations.  As  supportive  data,  the  applicant  also  presented  comparative  dissolution 
studies of Lenalidomide Accord hard capsules 2.5mg, 5mg, 7.5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg, 25 mg with Revlimid 
hard capsules 2.5mg, 5mg, 7.5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg and 25 mg, respectively. 
According  to  the  EMA  product-specific  bioequivalence  guidance  for  lenalidomide  hard  gelatin  capsules, 
lenalidomide is a compound with complete absorption. The development of the generic product Lenalidomide 
hard capsules concerns all strengths that are registered in the EU: 2.5mg, 5mg, 7.5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg 
and 25mg. As presented in Table 1, the qualitative composition of the reference and the generic products are 
similar; only silica colloidal anhydrous is added to the Lenalidomide Accord. The justification for the inclusion 
of silica colloidal anhydrous is related to the manufacturing process.  
Table 1 Comparison of list of excipients in test product and reference product 
A discussion on the potential impact of the differences in excipients quantitative contents on bioequivalence 
was provided. During the procedure a major objection was raised in relation to the difference in composition 
between the 2.5 mg and 5 mg strengths, and whether this impacts the acceptability of the biowaiver for the 
2.5  mg  strength.  Based  on  the  applicant’s  responses,  it  was  concluded  that,  from  the  quality  point  of  view 
there  is  little  difference  in  composition  between  the  2.5  and  5  mg  capsules,  and  considering  the  rapid 
dissolution  of  the  active  substance  across  the  pH  range,  no  differences  that  would  merit  a  bioequivalence 
study are expected. To justify this approach, the Applicant provided literature data and results carried out in 
vitro.  Lenalidomide  is  a  BCS  class-I  drug,  has  high  solubility  and  high  permeability.  Therefore,  according  to 
these results, the bioavailability of lenalidomide should not be affected by the amount of lactose used in the 
formulation.  While  the  questions  raised  during  the  procedure  asked  the  applicant  to  focus  on  the  general 
biowaiver  criteria,  the  applicant’s  responses  focused  on  the  BCS-biowaiver  criteria.  Nevertheless,  based  on 
the total information provided, the CHMP concluded that a further BE study is not required and the biowaiver 
for 2.5 mg strength can be accepted.  
The impurity profile of Lenalidomide capsules manufactured by finished product manufacturer as per the final 
formula  was  compared  with  the  impurity  profile  of  reference  product.  The  impurity  profiles  of  the  two 
products  were  found  to  be  comparable.  A  risk  assessment  on  elemental  impurities  in  accordance  with  ICH

Q3D was also presented and considered acceptable. Justification for selection of the QC dissolution medium 
and apparatus has been provided. The discriminatory power of dissolution method was investigated and has 
been demonstrated. 
The  primary  packaging  is  OPA  AL  PVC/Aluminium  foil  perforated  unit  dose  blisters  in  a  pack  size  of  7x1  or 
21x1 capsules. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of below main steps:  
1.  Sifting and blending  
2.  Pre-lubrication  
3.  Lubrication / blending  
4.  Filling of the capsules  
5.  Packaging. 
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. The in-process controls and intermediate 
specifications  are  adequate  for  this  type  of  manufacturing  process  and  pharmaceutical  form.  Major  steps  of 
the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It  has been demonstrated that the 
manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible 
manner.  
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form.  They 
include: description/appearance, identification (HPLC, UV), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), average fill 
weight, water content (Ph. Eur.), disintegration time (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), related 
substances (HPLC) and microbial enumeration test (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three full scale batches of each strength confirming the consistency of 
the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  three  production  scale  batches  of  each  strength  of  finished  product  stored  for  up  to  12 
months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for  up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
(40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches are identical to those proposed 
for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for description, average fill weight, disintegration time, water content, dissolution, 
assay, related substances and microbial enumeration. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
No significant changes have been observed.

Two batches of low and high strength (2.5mg & 25 mg) capsules were subjected to forced degradation 
studies under the following stress conditions: acid degradation, base degradation, peroxide degradation 
(oxidation), thermal degradation, heat and humidity degradation. The test methods were demonstrated to be 
stability indicating.  
One batch (25 mg strength) was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. The results showed the product is not significantly sensitive to photo 
degradation, so no special storage precaution is required for Lenalidomide Accord capsules.  
Two batches of low and high strength (2.5mg & 25 mg) capsules were subjected to a temperature excursion 
study to evaluate the effect of transportation on the stability of the product in final its packaging (Alu-Alu 
blister pack). Samples were stored under -20ºC for 2 days followed by exposure to 60ºC and 75% RH for 2 
days. This thermal cycle was repeated 3 times and samples were withdrawn at the end of each cycle. The 
samples were found to be stable.  
Stability study results for bulk capsules packed in double lined polybag, placed in stainless steel container, 
and stored up to 60 days, before being primary packaging were also provided. There were no significant 
changes in tested parameters up to 60 days. Therefore, a 30 day hold time for the bulk capsules is accepted.    
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years with no special storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Appropriate statements confirming TSE/BSE compliance were provided from the suppliers of the excipients 
derived from animal origin, i.e. lactose and gelatin. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between 
Lenalidomide Accord 25 mg hard capsule and the reference product, Revlimid 25 mg hard capsules, and 
biowaivers have been accepted for the other strengths; 2.5mg, 5mg, 7.5mg, 10mg, 15mg, and 20mg. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The report refers 33 publications up to year 2017. The 
overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics 
and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. 
The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable. 
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the Applicant as the introduction of 
Lenalidomide 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 mg hard capsules manufactured by Accord is considered unlikely 
to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all lenalidomide containing products 
and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not 
increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of lenalidomide are well known. As 
lenalidomide is a well-known active substance, the Applicant has not provided additional studies and further 
studies are not required. Overview based on literature review is, thus, appropriate. 
The CHMP considers that the non-clinical overview on the pre-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and 
toxicology is adequate. The Applicant presented a non-clinical discussion, including a description of expected 
impurities and their acceptability thresholds, which is acceptable. The non-clinical data is reflected in the 
appropriate sections of the SmPC. In line with the requirements for generic products, no new non-clinical 
data was submitted and none is expected. 
There are no objections to approval of Lenalidomide Accord 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 mg hard capsules 
from a non-clinical point of view. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In line with the requirements for generic products, no new non-clinical data was submitted, which is 
acceptable.  
The non-clinical information for Lenalidomide as in the PI of Revlimid applies also to Lenalidomide Accord and 
reflected in the RMP and risk minimization measures as necessary.

2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This marketing authorisation application under the centralised procedure concerns a generic application 
according to article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC for Lenalidomide Accord 2.5mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 
mg, 20 mg & 25 mg hard capsules. The originator product is Revlimid 2.5mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 
20 mg & 25 mg hard capsules. Lenalidomide was first approved in Europe on 14 June 2007 as Revlimid 5 mg, 
10 mg, 15 mg, 25 mg (MAA No: EU/1/07/391/001-004, Celgene Europe Limited, UK). 
One bioequivalence (BE) study has been performed using the originator. The test product (Lenalidomide 
Accord 25 mg hard capsule) and the reference product (Revlimid 25 mg hard capsule) were compared in the 
fasting conditions(Study No. 1605010). The clinical overview dated 26.04.2017; the report refers to 39 
publications up to year 2017. It seems adequate in term of bibliographic data on clinical pharmacology, 
efficacy and safety of lenalidomide. This is accepted by CHMP. 
For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) 
as well as the Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09) are of particular 
importance.  
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Exemption  
Lenalidomide 20mg, 15mg, 10mg, 7.5mg, 5mg capsules (test product) were compared with Lenalidomide 25 
mg capsules (test bio-batch). An In-vivo bioequivalence study of Lenalidomide 25 mg Hard Capsules with 
Revlimid® 25 mg Hard Capsules was conducted under fasting conditions and test product was found 
bioequivalent to reference product. 
Based on the acceptable bio-equivalence study for Lenalidomide 25 mg capsules, a request for waiver of bio-
study on remaining strength i.e. 2.5/5/7.5/10/15/20 mg is being placed based on the following general 
requirements contained in the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev. 1). 
According to the EMA guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence; following general requirements must 
be met where a waiver for additional strength(s) is claimed: 
a)  All the strengths i.e. 2.5/5/7.5/10/15/20 mg and 25 mg of proposed pharmaceutical product are 
manufactured by the same manufacturing process, 
b)  The qualitative composition of the Lenalidomide capsules 2.5/5/7.5/10/15/20 mg is same as that of 
Lenalidomide capsules 25 mg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/563114/2018 
Page 17/46 
 
  
  
 
c)  The composition of the all strengths i.e. 5/7.5/10/15/20 mg and 25 mg are quantitatively 
proportional i.e. the ratio between the amount of each excipient to the amount of active substance(s) 
is same for all the strengths. 
d)  In-vitro dissolution data on all the strengths confirms the adequacy of waiving additional in-vivo 
bioequivalence testing 
Lenalidomide is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. Following single and multiple doses of 
Revlimid in patients with MM the maximum plasma concentrations occurred between 0.5 and 6.0 hours post-
dose. The single and multiple dose pharmacokinetic disposition of lenalidomide is linear with AUC and Cmax 
values increasing proportionally with dose. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose regimen does not result 
in drug accumulation. Elimination is primarily renal. Following a single oral administration of [14C]-
lenalidomide (25 mg) to healthy subjects, approximately 90% and 4% of the radioactive dose is eliminated 
within ten days in urine and feces, respectively. Approximately 82% of the radioactive dose is excreted as 
lenalidomide in the urine within 24 hours. The same has been reported in the innovator literature that 
lenalidomide has been classified as BCS Class I molecule. Lenalidomide capsules were developed as a scale 
down dose proportional formulation for 25, 20, 15, 10, 7.5 & 5 mg capsules. 
Comparative in-vitro dissolution study: 
The dissolution profile of Lenalidomide hard capsules 20/15/10/7.5/5 mg (Exhibit batches) was compared 
with Lenalidomide 25 mg hard capsules (test bio-batch) manufactured by Reliance life sciences Pvt. Ltd.  
Table 2: Dissolution conditions: 
Comparative dissolution studies of Lenalidomide hard capsules 20 mg, 15 mg, 10 mg, 7.5 mg, 5 mg with 
Revlimid hard capsules 20 mg, 15 mg, 10 mg, 7.5 mg, 5 mg and Lenalidomide hard capsules 25 mg were 
carried out. More than 85% of Lenalidomide were released within 15 minutes. Therefore, dissolution profiles 
may be accepted as similar without any mathematical calculation for similarity.  
In Vitro Dissolution Testing of Batches Used in Bioequivalence Study 
The Applicant’s batch of Lenalidomide 25 mg hard capsules and batch of Revlimid 25 mg hard capsules were 
used in the bioequivalence study. Dissolution study of Lenalidomide hard capsules 25 mg with Revlimid hard 
capsules 25 mg were carried out. More than 85% of Lenalidomide were released within 15 minutes.  
Moreover, additional comparative dissolution studies of Lenalidomide hard capsules 20 mg, 15 mg, 10 mg, 
7.5 mg, 5 mg with Revlimid hard capsules 20 mg, 15 mg, 10 mg, 7.5 mg, 5 mg were carried out . As in the 
case of 25 mg hard capsules, more than 85% of Lenalidomide or Revlimid were released within 15 minutes. 
Therefore, dissolution profiles may be accepted as similar. 
Based on the dissolution results obtained, it can be concluded that test and reference product for all the 
strengths are releasing more than 85% of drug within 15 minutes. Release profiles of test product strengths 
are similar to each other and with the corresponding strengths of reference product. 
The Applicant provided in-vitro dissolution profile comparison between test bio-batch strength (25 mg) and 
biowaiver strengths (20 mg, 15 mg, 10 mg, 7.5 mg and 5mg) in accordance with EMA guidance (Guideline on 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/563114/2018 
Page 18/46 
 
  
  
 
the Investigation of Bioequivalence - CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **, section 4.2.2). Dissolution 
data obtained confirms the adequacy of waiving additional in-vivo bioequivalence testing. 
The Applicant provided in-vitro dissolution profile comparison between test bio-batch strength (25 mg) and 
biowaiver strengths (20 mg, 15 mg, 10 mg, 7.5 mg and 5mg). In all cases, the dissolution test revealed that 
more than 85% of the drug was dissolved within 15 min (range 91-100%). Therefore, according to the 
relevant guideline the dissolution profiles of the drugs were accepted as similar without further mathematical 
evaluation. 
Bio-waiver for 2.5 mg strength 
Lenalidomide capsules were developed as a scale-down dose proportional formulation for 25, 20, 15, 10, 7.5 
and 5 mg capsules.  
Absorption Profile 
As per the pharmacokinetics parameter available in the literature Lenalidomide is rapidly absorbed following 
oral administration. Following single and multiple doses of REVLIMID in patients with MM the maximum 
plasma concentrations occurred between 0.5 and 6.0 hours post-dose. The single and multiple dose 
pharmacokinetic disposition of lenalidomide is linear with AUC and Cmax values increasing proportionally with 
dose. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose regimen does not result in drug accumulation. The same has 
been reported in the innovator literature that Lenalidomide has been classified as BCS Class I molecule. 
Solubility Profile 
To demonstrate the highly soluble nature of the molecule, the highest dose of the drug substance i.e. 25 mg 
of Lenalidomide was taken and dissolved in 250 mL of various physiological buffer in the range of pH 1.2, 4.5 
& 6.8 along with water, were studied using a stability indicating method, each pH was studied in replicate and 
for 24 hours. The pH before and after were recorded as per the required guideline. 
Sample preparation procedure 
Accurately weighed and transferred about 25 mg of Lenalidomide API into a 500 mL flask. Added 250 mL of 
respective media. Kept on shaker at 37°C for 24 hours at 50 rpm. 
Table 3: Solubility profile 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/563114/2018 
Page 19/46 
 
  
  
 
 
As per the definition in the guidelines, the solubility results reveal that Lenalidomide belongs to a class of 
highly soluble drugs with maximum dose i.e. 25 mg is dissolving in less than 250 ml of media across the pH 
profile.  
Therapeutic index  
BCS-based biowaiver is restricted to highly soluble drug substances with known human absorption and 
considered not to have a narrow therapeutic index. Lenalidomide does not have a narrow therapeutic index 
and highly soluble BCS class I drug substance. 
The dissolution results indicate that both the test and reference formulation are releasing more than 85 % of 
the drug product within 15 minutes hence classifying the formulation as very rapidly releasing formulation. 
The test product 25 mg capsules have shown bio-equivalence to reference product 25 mg capsules and has 
similar qualitative composition to test product 2.5 mg capsules. 
Excipients 
The test product does not contain any excipient which is known to alter the bioavailability of the active 
moiety and the excipients incorporated are qualitatively similar to the reference product except Silica, 
colloidal anhydrous which is added as a processing aid in a minute concentration. Other excipients are used 
in the usual effective concentrations ranges well below IID levels. 
Table 4: Excipients 
The Applicant presented comparative dissolution studies of Lenalidomide hard capsules 20 mg, 15 mg, 10 
mg, 7.5 mg, 5 mg with Revlimid hard capsules 20 mg, 15 mg, 10 mg, 7.5 mg, 5 mg and Lenalidomide hard 
capsules 25 mg, that were carried out . More than 85% of Lenalidomide were released within 15 minutes. 
The sampling time points are sufficient. Bearing in mind that more than 85% of the labelled amount of the 
drug was released within 15 minutes from each tested formulations (all the batches), the dissolution profiles 
could be considered as similar without further mathematical calculations. Bearing in mind the fact that all 
requirements contained in the guideline CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr** for 25, 20, 15, 10, 7.5 and 
5 mg capsules (the same manufacturing process, proportional formulation for all strength, similar qualitative 
and quantitative compositions) are fulfilled, these strength may be considered for biowaiver.

Methods 
Study design  
The Applicant has submitted a comparative bioequivalence study. The Principal Investigator (PI) provided the 
IEC with all appropriate study documents. 
This was a randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-treatment, two-sequence, two-period, crossover 
bioequivalence study of test Lenalidomide 25 mg hard capsule with reference Revlimid® (containing 25 mg of 
Lenalidomide) of Celgene Europe Limited, in healthy, adult, male subjects under fasting conditions. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/563114/2018 
Page 21/46 
 
  
  
 
 
objectives of the study were: a) To assess the bioequivalence of single dose test formulation of Lenalidomide 
25 mg Hard Capsules with reference Revlimid® (containing 25 mg of Lenalidomide) of Celgene Europe 
Limited, in normal, healthy, adult, male subjects under fasting conditions.; b) to monitor the adverse events 
and ensure the safety and to collect other pharmacokinetic data of the Test and Reference formulations. 
The administration of test and reference products to each subject of the study was determined according to 
the randomization schedule. The personnel involved in the dispensing of investigational products would be 
accountable for ensuring compliance to randomization schedule. All subjects who were randomized into the 
study are included. The randomization schedule was provided in submitted documentation. 
The study was conducted between 18/10/2016 and 02/11/2016 and bioanalysis was performed between 
05.11.2016 – 19.11.2016.  
Within this clinical trial, there were 2 different treatments. The treatments were defined as follows: 
• 
• 
oral fasted administration of one hard capsule of test product 
oral fasted administration of one hard capsule of reference product 
The administration of Test and reference products to each subject of the study was determined according to 
the randomization schedule. The personnel involved in the dispensing of investigational products would be 
accountable for ensuring compliance to randomization schedule. The analyst concerned did not have access 
to randomization schedule during the course of analysis. 
During all treatment periods, blood samples of approximately 6 ml volume were taken. Blood samples were 
taken at the following time points. 
The blood samples were collected in pre-labelled (mentioning study number, subject number, period and 
sampling time point) sodium heparin vaccutainer. 
All the collected blood samples were taken for centrifugation in a refrigerated centrifuge, in order to separate 
plasma. The resulting plasma from each blood sample were divided into two aliquots and stored in suitably 
pre labelled polypropylene tubes, until the assay was performed. 
The quantification of lenalidomide in plasma was performed using a validated Liquid Chromatography Coupled 
with Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).  
The study was performed under fasting conditions. According to the reference product SmPC 
recommendation (Revlimid, SmpC), the drug can be taken with or without food. According to the Guidance 
on the investigation of bioavailability and bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **), in such 
circumstances a bioequivalence study should be conducted under fasting conditions.  The subjects were 
administered a single oral dose of 25 mg of Lenalidomide of either the test or reference product at a 
particular stage of the study.   
The sampling periods are acceptable with sample time points around Tmax for lenalidomide and with an 
adequate wash-out period (at least 6 treatment-free days) at greater than five times the t1/2 (2.5 hours for 
lenalidomide). The sampling frequency allowed for adequate estimation of Cmax. The sampling schedule 
covered the plasma concentration time curve that was long enough to provide a reliable estimate of the 
extent of exposure. 
The sample shipment condition, method of temperature control during transportation and timespan between 
blood sampling and freezing of samples are documented in sample transfer records.

Test and reference products   
The reference product Revlimid (25 mg) is approved in the European Union (MA Holder: Celgene Europe 
Limited) and was purchased from the UK market. Prior to start of the clinical trial the reference product was 
checked with respect to the relevant parameters of pharmaceutical quality, especially in-vitro dissolution and 
content. Batches used for the clinical trial were of appropriate quality and were manufactured according to 
GMP standards.  
Certificates of analysis for both the test and reference products have been provided. Assay values of 96.8% 
and 100.3% for the test and reference are reported respectively. The assayed content of the batch used as 
test product did not differ more than 5% from that of the batch used as reference product which is in 
accordance with the Guideline on the investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 01 
Corr**).   
Population(s) studied  
The current study was done with 54 subjects to demonstrate bioequivalence between Test formulation and 
the corresponding Reference product. Based on literature data, the maximum intra-subject variability 
observed for primary pharmacokinetic parameter (AUC and Cmax,) was found to be 22% for Lenalidomide. 
The sample size computation was determined considering the following assumptions: 
o  T/R ratio ~ 90-111 % 
o 
Intra-Subject C.V (%) ~22 % 
o  Significance Level = 5%

In the presented study sample size calculation was properly conducted. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are acceptable and drawn up according to the protocol. All subjects are 
observed and treated according to the same rules. The data from all treated subjects was treated in the same 
way. 
The study population is appropriate and the main inclusion and exclusion criteria are in line with the 
requirements of the Guideline on the investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 01). 
According to the protocol calculations, 54 subjects were considered to be enough to power the study with 52 
subjects completing the study. 
The Applicant presented a list of pre-specified reasons that may be used to remove subjects form therapy 
assessment. Some of them may be deemed clearly arbitrary (eg. Investigator’s discretion and sponsor’s 
decision). The Applicant is asked to explain what precisely lies behind these statements?     
Analytical methods   
Lenalidomide in plasma samples was analysed by use of a validated Liquid Chromatography Coupled with 
Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Lower Limit of Quantitation (LLOQ) for lenalidomide was 2.015 ng/ml. In the 
presented clinical trial a bioanalytical method based on LC with MS/MS detection after liquid-liquid extraction 
from plasma was utilized.  
Validation of the test method 
The method has been validated. The following parameters were addressed: selectivity for lenalidomide and 
internal standard (investigation of interference caused by blank plasma, by haemolysed blank plasma and 
hyperlipidaemic blank plasma), carryover, matrix effect (influence of haemolysed plasma and hyperlipidaemic 
plasma), linearity, lower limit of quantification (with acceptable precision and accuracy), precision, accuracy, 
recovery rate and stability. Each parameter has been assessed and the limits are justified. This is deemed 
acceptable.  
The analytical method used to determine the concentration of lenalidomide in human plasma seems to be 
adequately described; the validations were performed according to the requirements of the EMA “Guideline 
on bioanalytical method validation” (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2**)”. Acceptance criteria 
are in a plausible range. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/563114/2018 
Page 25/46 
 
  
  
The validation activity was initiated by using structural analogue “Indapamide” which is also compatible with 
lenalidomide as an internal standard. The method was fully validated using Indapamide as internal standard. 
Upon the availability of isotopic labelled compound, the method was partially validated using isotopic labelled 
internal standard. 
The analytical methods used are acceptable. The calibration curves are appropriate and the stability testing 
justifies the conditions the samples were exposed to during collection and testing. The Applicant has also 
provided relevant supportive data together with certificates of analysis for the analyte standard and internal 
standards used in the analytical method validation. Moreover, the partial validation report due to changing of 
internal standard is also presented. 
Bioanalytical report 
The bioanalytical report dated 02 Nov 2016 was submitted. The quantification of lenalidomide in plasma was 
performed using a validated Liquid Chromatography-Mass spectrometry/Mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) 
method. The lower limit of quantitation of the method was 2.0 ng/ml, the upper limit of quantitation was 
751.0 ng/ml for lenalidomide. Lenalidomide 13C5 was used as internal standard. 
The total number of analysed study samples was 2226. The total number of repeated samples was 53. 
The study samples were identified by the study number, subject number and sampling time point. Details for 
dropout subjects and missing samples are available in sample transfer record. Study samples will be stored 
under frozen conditions at -70±15ºC and records shall be maintained in respective logbooks.  
In this study the total number of study samples measured was 2226. In total 2.38 % of the samples were 
repeated. 
The Applicant presented bioaanalysis results of the BEQ study. The quantification of lenalidomide in plasma 
was performed using a validated Liquid Chromatography-Mass spectrometry/Mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) 
method. The lower limit of quantitation of the method was 2.0 ng/ml, the upper limit of quantitation was 
751.0 ng/ml for lenalidomide. Lenalidomide 13C5 was used as internal standard. The bioanalysis was 
performed between 05.11.2016 to 19.11.2016. The total number of analysed study samples was 2226. 
During the bioanalysis fifty three study samples had to be reanalysed. Fifty one samples needed to be 
reanalysed due to concentration above upper limit of quantification. This contributes to only 2.3% of the total 
study samples. Additionally, dilution integrity experiment was already completed during the method 
validation for handling such cases. During repeat analysis, diluted quality control (QC) samples were also 
processed to check the acceptance of the dilution applied during the analysis. As diluted QC samples were 
well within the acceptance limits, it is proposed that the effect of dilution will not have any impact on study 
results. 
During conduct of the study, documentation of haemolysed samples was done in Sample Receipt and 
Accountability Form for each time point. A total of 62 samples were haemolysed. There was no defined 
procedure for identification of lipemic samples in Clinical Pharmacology Unit (CPU) at the time of conduct of 
the study. In reference to this regulatory query, the identification of lipemic samples was done 
retrospectively. The samples stored in deep freezer were retrieved by Clinical Trial Supplies Management 
Representative and received by Bioanalytical Lab (BL). The identification of lipemic samples was done by CPU 
representative, manually checking the physical appearance of each sample, in presence of representative 
from BL and Quality Assurance group on 23 Nov 2017. A total of 63 samples were found to be lipemic. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/563114/2018 
Page 26/46 
 
  
  
There is a high chance of false positive or false negative interpretation during identification of lipemic 
samples due to following reasons. 
• Identification was done manually by checking physical appearance of samples. 
• These samples had already undergone multiple freeze thaw cycles (not more than five) which could lead to 
hazy appearance of some samples. Similarly some lipemic may have cleared due to prolonged storage. 
Further, we would like to inform agency that two lots each of haemolysed and lipemic samples are processed 
and analysed in selectivity and matrix effect experiment during method validation. The response of lipemic 
and haemolysed samples were in precision with the other normal lots in both the above experiments, hence 
there is no impact of these samples on the quantitation of analyte. 
Storage period of study samples  
The bioanalysis was performed between 05.11.2016 to 19.11.2016. Long term stability was determined for 
55 days at -200C and -700C. This time span was sufficient as time between withdrawal of first PK sample and 
last analytical measurement did not exceed 31 days.  
Incurred Sample Reanalysis 
In this study the scheduled total number of subject samples was 2226. Incurred sample reanalysis was 
performed on 168 samples (7.55%). As a criterion of acceptance two thirds of the repeat samples should 
agree within ± 20 %. In total, 97.62 % of the repeat samples agreed within ± 20 %. Therefore the 
acceptance criteria were fulfilled and incurred sample reanalysis was in accordance with the European 
guideline.  
The analytical portion of the bioequivalence study (Study No. RLS/0715/019) was conducted according to a 
validated method (ACC Project-No.: VR-16-004-LLM) and EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2** 
guideline on Shimadzu LC20 and AB Sciex (API-3000 and API-3200), using Lenalidomide 13C5 as internal 
standards (IS). Some issues need to be elucidated.    
Pharmacokinetic Variables 
The following pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from the time and concentration data of 
Lenalidomide, using non-compartmental model of Phoenix WinNonLin® version 6.4 Pharsight application or 
higher version: 
Cmax Maximum measurable plasma concentration. 
AUC0-t Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from drug administration to last observed 
concentration at time t. 
AUC0-∞ Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero extrapolated to infinity. 
Tmax Time of maximum measured plasma concentration. If the maximum value occurs at more than one 
time point, Tmax is defined as the first time point. 
t1/2 Elimination or terminal half-life. 
Kel Elimination rate constant. 
For all the above computations, actual time points of the sample collection were used. No value of Kel, AUC0-
∞ and/or t1/2 was reported for cases that do not exhibit a terminal log-linear phase in the concentration

Page 27/46 
 
  
  
versus time profile; however, if Cmax and Tmax could still be reliably estimated then these PK parameters 
were included in the statistical analysis. 
Pharmacokinetics parameters evaluated in presented study were appropriate to determine bioequivalence. 
The primary pharmacokinetic variables were Cmax, and AUC0-t. Also software used in analyse was well 
known and sufficient. 
Statistical methods 
The statistical analysis was performed on pharmacokinetic parameters of Lenalidomide using SAS®, 
statistical software Version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc., USA. The number of subjects (N), Geometric Mean, 
Arithmetic Mean, Median, Standard deviation, Minimum, Median, Maximum, Coefficient of variation were 
calculated. Summary statistics were calculated for plasma concentrations of Lenalidomide, at each time point 
as well as for the pharmacokinetic parameters for the Test and Reference product separately. 
Ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ and untransformed pharmacokinetic 
parameters Cmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, Tmax, Kel, AUC0-t/ AUC0-∞ and t1/2 were evaluated statistically using 
the PROC GLM procedure of SAS®. For Average bioequivalence approach, the statistical model ANOVA 
contained main effects of sequence, period, products & subject within sequence. The F test were performed 
to determine the statistical significance of the effects involved in the model at 5% level of significance 
(p=0.05). Two one-sided 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of means between Test and Reference 
products were calculated for Ln-transformed data of pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-t and were 
found to be within 80% to 125% to establish bioequivalence. For untransformed Tmax non parametric test 
(Wilcoxon sign rank test) was applied. 
The protocol contained section about missing data management and outliers as follows: the data from 
subjects with missing concentration values (missed blood samples, lost samples, samples unable to be 
quantified) may be used if pharmacokinetic parameters can be estimated using remaining data points, 
otherwise data from these subjects will be excluded from the final analysis. Any missing samples or non-
reportable concentration values will be reported as "Missing" or "Non-Reportable Values" (NRV). No 
concentration estimates will be calculated for missing values. BLQ values will be treated as zero for 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis. 
The raw data generated during the course of the study including the clinical, analytical and statistical 
operations along with the final report underwent quality assurance audit for conformance to the study 
protocol and all the governing SOPs, by auditors from the Quality Assurance Unit. 
For retrospective calculation of study power, SAS system 9.3 was used. The equivalence test mean ratio 
statistical test was used for computation of power. From the study, the observed mean ratio and observed 
CV% has been used to compute power for sample size of 52 subjects who were considered for PK analysis 
with BE limits 80.00-125.00% and level of significance (α=0.05%). As stated above the variables used for 
computation of power for all primary PK parameters are presented below which shows that computed power 
for all PK parameters are >80%. The post study power calculation for Cmax and AUC showed that study was 
adequately powered to test the equivalence between test and reference arm. 
Descriptive statistics and data handling procedures (missing data management and outliers detecting 
methods) were properly designed and clearly presented. As the visualizations of study results were legible. 
Statistical methodology established in SAP was mostly consistent with guidelines and properly conducted.

Statistical evaluation of pharmacokinetic data was performed with analysis of variance methodology, with 
fixed effects. Significant formulation effect was observed for lnAUC0-t. However the applicant has provided 
detailed explanation related to this result. 
Results 
Pharmacokinetic Parameters

The geometric means T/R ratios for lnCmax, lnAUC0-t and lnAUC0-∞ were 104.13%, 102.20% and 102.24% 
respectively which were within the range of 80 to 125%. For T Vs R, the 90% confidence intervals ranges for 
lnCmax from, 97.89 - 110.77 for lnAUC0-t 100.51 - 103.92 and for lnAUC0-∞ 100.59 - 103.91 which were 
within the limit of 80.00-125.00%. 
Analysis of Tmax 
The Tmax is comparable between Test and Reference product and no significant difference was observed 
between two arms as assessed by Wilcoxon scores (Rank sums) test for Tmax (P=0.93).

The ratios of the mean of the ln-transformed data (T/R ratio) for lnCmax and lnAUC0-t were 104.13 and 
102.20 respectively for Lenalidomide. For mean ratio T/R, the 90% confidence intervals for lnCmax ranges 
from 97.89 - 110.77 and for lnAUC0-t ranges from 100.51 - 103.92 which were within the bioequivalence 
range of 80.00% - 125.00% for Lenalidomide. It can be concluded Test Lenalidomide 25 mg hard capsule is 
bioequivalent with reference Revlimid® (containing 25 mg of Lenalidomide) of Celgene Europe Limited, in 
normal, healthy, adult, male subjects under fasting conditions.

Safety data 
Extent of exposure 
Fifty-two subjects received 1 tablet of Test and Reference products. As subject no. 032 did not report for 
period II check-in and subject no. 035 did not participate in period II (as he was found positive for alcohol 
breath test during period II check in), two subjects received 1 tablet of Test product. Therefore, drug 
exposure was 1 x 25 mg of lenalidomide in each period. Hence, total dose of 52 subject was 2 x 25 mg 
resulting in 50 mg lenalidomide. Extent of exposure in the case of subjects no. 032 and 035 was 1 x 25 mg 
lenalidomide in total.  
Adverse events (AEs) 
In this study, 2 adverse events were reported. There were 2 (3.70%) subjects reported with adverse events 
in Reference arm. Both the AEs reported in the reference arm were mild in severity. One AE was possibly 
related and another was probably reported. There was no adverse event reported in Test arm. The one AE 
was from general disorders and administration site conditions system organ class (SOC) and second AE was 
from investigation SOC class. 
Analysis of Adverse Events 
Subject no. 029 following administration of reference product in period I had fever on 20/10/16 at 14:24 hrs. 
It was mild in severity and probably related to study drug. It resolved on 20/10/16 at 14:24 hrs. Subject no. 
019 following administration of reference product in period II had high fasting glucose level i.e. 133.0 mg/dl 
on 27/10/16 at 09:09 hrs during post study safety evaluation. The first repeat was performed on 29/10/16 
and fasting blood glucose level decreased to 129.1 mg/dl. It was clinically significant. The second repeat was 
performed on 02/11/16 and fasting blood glucose level increased to 130.8 mg/dl. It was clinically significant. 
The third repeat was performed on 10/11/16 and random blood glucose level decreased to 89.7 mg/dl. It was 
within normal limit. The AE was mild in severity and possibly related to study drug. It resolved on 10/11/16 
at 15:50 hrs. 
The overall incidence of AEs was small. They occurred in the Reference group only. The AE was mild in 
severity and possibly related to study drug. 
Clinical laboratory evaluation 
All the values of pre-study laboratory measurements were within the normal laboratory range and any values 
that were slightly outside the normal laboratory range were judged to be clinically not significant. 
Evaluation of each laboratory parameter 
Laboratory parameters including hematology, biochemistry profile and urine analysis of the study subjects, 
undertaken at pre-study screening and post-study safety assessment revealed that the values of most 
parameters were within the normal range for most of the subjects. There were some cases that were slightly 
outside the normal laboratory range and according to the clinician were not considered to be clinically 
significant, either due to the value being not significantly elevated or reduced, being an isolated finding with 
no other abnormal laboratory findings or not being associated with any clinical findings. 
Laboratory values over time 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/563114/2018 
Page 32/46 
 
  
  
Screening laboratory examinations were performed for all randomised subjects. Following the exclusion 
criteria in the study protocol for certain laboratory parameters (CRP, ASAT, ALAT, bilirubin and creatinine) 
thresholds were defined.  
In the screening laboratory examinations some subjects presented abnormal haematological values 
(haemoglobin (Hb), total white blood cells count (WBC), total red blood cells count (RBC), differential WBC 
count, platelet count and hematocrit). 
The eligibility of subjects is assessed based on overall health status of the volunteers considering medical 
history, physical examination findings and laboratory reports. Work instruction titled “Acceptable Laboratory 
Test Range” (CP/WI/26) is referred to judge health status of subjects during conduct of the study. This 
document provides normal laboratory value ranges as well as guidance for assessing the clinical significance 
of laboratory values outside the normal range. Please refer to Appendix 5 for Acceptable Laboratory Test 
Range. 
The lab reports received on the check in day before deciding eligibility of the volunteers were also checked. 
No subjects with clinically significant abnormality were included in the study. If any abnormalities were 
present; they were deemed not clinically significant by the investigator. 
Vital signs, physical findings and other observations related to safety 
No clinically relevant changes in the ECG parameters, vital signs and physical parameters related to safety 
were observed between screening and end of study examination. 
Safety conclusions 
Subjects who received at least a single dose of the study drug lenalidomide capsules (either test or 
reference) in the study were included in the safety analyses. In this study, all subjects were included in the 
safety analysis. No clinically significant change was noted with respect to blood pressure, body temperature 
and other vital parameters from baseline to end of the study.  
In this study, 2 adverse events were reported. There were 2 (3.70%) subjects reported with adverse events 
in Reference arm. Both the AEs reported in the reference arm were mild in severity. One AE was possibly 
related and another was probably reported. There was no adverse event reported in Test arm. All adverse 
events reported in the study were resolved. No serious adverse event was observed in the study. The 
adverse events observed in this study were in line with the known safety profile of the product and were mild 
in severity. No major safety concerns were noted during this study with Test or Reference formulation. Based 
on safety analysis, it can be concluded that, both Test and Reference formulations are well tolerated during 
study. 
Both products were found to be safe and well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events (AEs) reported 
in this study. The adverse events were not life threatening nor did they required the subjects to be 
hospitalized. After study drug intake, 2 subjects showed 2 AEs - 2 after reference treatment. This two AEs 
were classified as having possible or probable relationship to the investigational product. All AEs reported 
after study drug intake resolved completely. No subject dropped out due to AEs.

considered bioequivalent with Revlimid.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country.  
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  bioequivalence study 1605010 was designed as a randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-treatment, 
two sequence, two-period, crossover bioequivalence study of test Lenalidomide 25 mg hard capsule with 
reference Revlimid® (containing 25 mg of Lenalidomide) of Celgene Europe Limited, in healthy, adult, human 
subjects under fasting conditions. 
Sample size calculation was properly conducted based on the observed coefficient of variation (CV) as the 
study should have 54 evaluable subjects (with 10% dropout rate) to show the bioequivalence with a power 
greater than 80% at 5% level of significance; 54   healthy, adult, human subjects participated under fasting 
conditions and 52 subjects completed both the periods of the study. Subject no. 032 did not report for period 
II check-in. Subject no. 035 did not participate in period II as he was found positive for alcohol breath test 
during period II check in. For comparative pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis, 52 subjects were 
considered. All 54 subjects were considered for safety evaluation. The study population is appropriate and the 
main inclusion and exclusion criteria are in line with the requirements of the Guideline on the investigation of 
Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 01). According to the protocol calculations, 54 subjects were 
considered to be enough to power the study with 52 subjects completing the study.   
Pharmacokinetics parameters evaluated in presented study were appropriate to determine bioequivalence. 
The primary pharmacokinetic variables were Cmax, and AUC0-t. Also software used in analyse was well 
known and sufficient. Methodological assumptions, descriptive statistics and data handling procedures 
(missing data management and outliers detecting methods) were properly designed and clearly presented. 
Statistical methodology established in SAP was mostly consistent with guidelines and properly conducted. 
Statistical evaluation of pharmacokinetic data was performed with analysis of variance methodology, with 
fixed effects.   
Safety evaluation by physical examination, vital signs, monitoring adverse events as clinical signs and 
symptoms during the study, and laboratory investigations performed at the end of the study revealed 
comparable safety profile. The adverse events observed in this study were in line with the known safety 
profile of the product. No new significant safety concerns were noted during this study with Test or Reference 
formulation. The adverse events observed in this study were in line with the known safety profile of the 
product and were mild in severity. No SAE was observed in the study. Upon conclusion of clinical portion, the 
results from the subjects who completed post study procedures including laboratory tests confirmed the 
absence of significant changes in the subject’s state of health. 
The observed concentration data for Lenalidomide was analysed. To assess the bioequivalence of the test 
product, the 90% confidence intervals were calculated for the geometric least square mean ratios (T vs R) of

reference formulations shows mean Cmax was 671.83 and 651.61 ng/mL, AUC0-t was 2308.83 and 2257.62 
(ng X hr/mL) and AUC0-∞ was 2333.56 and 2281.29 (ng X hr/mL) respectively. The median Tmax observed 
for both Test and Reference formulations was comparable (0.83 hrs for both Test and Reference product). 
The Tmax is comparable between Test and Reference product and no significant difference was observed 
between two arms as assessed by Wilcoxon scores (Rank sums) test for Tmax (P=0.93). The half-life of both 
Test and Reference formulations was comparable. (Mean T1/2 for T Vs R – 03.67 Vs 03.63 hrs). 
Bioequivalence assessment showed that the ratios of the geometric least square mean of ln-transformed data 
(T/R ratio) for lnCmax, and lnAUC0-t were 104.13% [90% CI (97.89 - 110.77)], 102.20% [90% CI (100.51 - 
103.92)] respectively which were within acceptable bioequivalence range. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) of 
the lnCmax and lnAUC0-t obtained from the Test and Reference formulations shows no sequence and period 
effect with respect all ln transformed PK parameter.   
The analytical method for the determination of lenalidomide in human plasma seems to be described 
adequately; the validations were performed according to the requirements of the EMA “Guideline on 
bioanalytical method validation” (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2**)”. Acceptance criteria are 
in a plausible range. The analytical methods used are acceptable and appropriate.  
The post study power calculation for primary pharmacokinetic parameters showed that study was adequately 
powered to test the equivalence between test and reference arm. In this study, 2 adverse events were 
reported. There were 2 (3.70%) subjects reported with adverse events in Reference arm. Both the AEs 
reported in the reference arm were mild in severity. One AE was possibly related and another was probably 
reported. There was no adverse event reported in Test arm. All adverse events reported in the study were 
resolved. No serious adverse event was observed; the adverse events in this study were in line with the 
known safety profile of the product and were mild in severity. No major safety concerns were noted during 
this study with Test or Reference formulation.  
It can be concluded Test Lenalidomide 25 mg hard capsule is bioequivalent to reference Revlimid (containing 
25 mg of Lenalidomide) of Celgene Europe Limited. All relevant information from the PI of Revlimid is 
reflected in the PI of Lenalidomide Accord.  
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
The presented study was designed and conducted according to recommendations of the EMA Guideline on the 
Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **). Based on the results obtained in 
the bioequivalence study (Study No.: 1605010, Protocol No.: RLS/0715/019), the Lenalidomide 25 mg hard 
capsule (Test) and Revlimid® (containing 25 mg of Lenalidomide) (Reference), is considered bioequivalent. 
Moreover, bearing in mind that all requirements contained in the guideline CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ 
Corr** for 25, 20, 15, 10, 7.5, 5 and 2.5 mg capsules are fulfilled the results of the bioequivalence study 
could be extrapolate on these strengths.   
The clinical aspects in Revlimid PI are reflected in the PI of Lenalidomide Accord.

2.6.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Product information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of 
a bridging report making reference to Revlimid. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been 
found acceptable. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Lenalidomide Accord is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it has conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal 
product.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of Lenalidomide hard capsule. The reference product Revlimid is 
indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who have 
undergone autologous stem cell transplantation; as combination therapy for the treatment of adult patients 
with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant; in combination with 
dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult patients who have received at least one prior 
therapy; as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- 
or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with an isolated deletion 5q cytogenetic 
abnormality when other therapeutic options are insufficient or inadequate; as monotherapy is indicated for 
the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/563114/2018 
Page 39/46 
 
  
  
 
aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the 
bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, 
sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was 
validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Lenalidomide Accord met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when 
compared with Revlimid. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, 
AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 
125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. The information included 
in the PI of Revlimid is reflected appropriately in the PI of Lenalidomide Accord.  The risk minimisation plan 
and risk minimisation measures agreed for Revlimid apply also to Lenalidomide Accord.  
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Lenalidomide Accord is favourable in the following indication: 
Multiple myeloma 
Lenalidomide Accord as monotherapy is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with newly 
diagnosed multiple myeloma who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation. 
Lenalidomide Accord as combination therapy (see section 4.2) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant. 
Lenalidomide Accord in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of multiple myeloma 
in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

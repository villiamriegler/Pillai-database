2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease 
Influenza is an infectious acute respiratory disease of global importance that occurs in annual 
epidemics in the northern hemisphere (NH) and southern hemisphere (SH). The influenza virus is 
transmitted by respiratory droplets or aerosols containing the influenza virus particles and subsequent 
inhalation of infectious particles or self-inoculation from a contaminated surface. Clinical manifestation 
of influenza virus infection is characterized by an abrupt onset of nonspecific respiratory and systemic 
effects, such as fever, myalgia, headache, malaise, non-productive cough, sore throat and rhinitis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 9/194 
 
 
 
Some individuals are more prone than others to develop complications from influenza, e.g. bacterial 
pneumonia or other organ dysfunction. Severe influenza and complicated influenza potentially leading 
to hospitalisation and death are more likely to occur in vulnerable populations, such as older people 
(≥65 years of age, in part due to the age related decline of the immune response 
(immunosenescence)), pregnant women, younger children (especially up to 24 months of age), and 
patients with chronic underlying diseases. These groups are considered at risk and represent the 
priority target for influenza vaccination programmes in the EU. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, prevention 
Influenza is an infectious acute respiratory disease of global importance that occurs in annual 
epidemics in the NH and SH during winter months. In temperate climates, influenza generally affects 
people from November to March in the NH and from May to September in the SH. It can occur all year 
round in tropical climates.  
Influenza in humans can be caused by the influenza virus type A, B and C, of which type A and B 
viruses are most clinically relevant. Type A viruses are associated with annual epidemics and 
pandemics, and B viruses contribute to annual epidemics. The type A viruses are further divided into 
different subtypes, of which the A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 viruses are the most clinically relevant for annual 
influenza disease burden. For influenza B, only a single type is known to exist, but 2 distinct genetic 
lineages are identified: Yamagata and Victoria. 
Worldwide, annual influenza epidemics result in about 90 million cases with approximately 3 to 5 
million cases of severe illness, and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths, of which 28,000 to 111,500 
occur in children. The main prevention strategy to minimize influenza burden is through annual 
prophylactic vaccination. Influenza vaccines are designed to protect against illness from the circulating 
virus strains, and the most commonly used vaccines have been inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV). 
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends seasonal influenza vaccination for specific group of 
people which are more at risk of complications and death: pregnant women, elderly individuals (≥65 
years of age), individuals with chronic medical conditions, health care workers, and children aged from 
6 months to 5 years. Additionally, some public health authorities are moving towards vaccination 
strategies to reduce the risk of influenza in all age groups in an effort to decrease overall disease 
burden and spread to those in the population who are most at risk. In the WHO European Region, an 
average of over 44,000 deaths occur annually (ranging between 15,000 to 70,000 deaths per season) 
from influenza related causes with approximately 75% of these deaths occurring in individuals ≥65 
years of age. 
Traditionally and until 2012, seasonal influenza vaccines included antigens from 3 influenza strains in 
their composition, 2 influenza A strains (largely A/H1N1 and A/H3N2), and a strain from 1 of the 2 
influenza B lineages (B/Yamagata or B/Victoria). This is because the majority of global influenza 
disease cases in humans since 1977 have been caused by circulating A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and influenza B 
strains viruses. Influenza B strains from the 2 lineages have co-circulated yearly since 1980s, when 
they emerged, with either or both types prevalent within any given year with no cross protection 
between the lineages.  
The difficulty of choosing the correct B lineage to include in influenza vaccine formulations raises the 
possibility of a mismatch between the influenza B strain contained in the influenza vaccine and the 
influenza B strain predominantly circulating in the community in any given season. In order to avoid 
vaccine mismatch, quadrivalent influenza vaccines that include influenza B strains from both lineages 
have been recommended and these are expected to provide protection against the additional B strain. 
The first QIV was approved in the United States of America (US) prior to the 2012/13 Northern 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 10/194 
 
 
 
Hemisphere influenza season. A US study estimated that, in a season with a B strain mismatch, 
availability of quadrivalent influenza virus vaccines could reduce annual influenza cases (range: 2200–
970,000), hospitalizations (range: 14–8200), and deaths (range: 1–485) in the US.  
QIV is a quadrivalent vaccine including B strains of both lineages, and is therefore expected to improve 
protection in target populations, especially in children where significant disease due to influenza B 
strains occurs and the potential for vaccine B strain mismatch has existed with trivalent influenza virus 
vaccines. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The influenza virus is an orthomyxovirus that can be classified into 3 biologically similar, but 
antigenically different types, A, B, and C, of which type A and B viruses are the most clinically 
significant. The influenza type A virus can be further divided into subtypes based on the hemagglutinin 
(HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface glycoprotein antigens. The subtype refers to major antigenic 
variation with respect to the HA and/or NA virion antigens. Of the influenza type A virus subtypes, the 
A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 subtypes are the most clinically important for annual influenza disease burden. 
Influenza type B viruses show extensive variation in antigenicity. Although no true B subtype is known 
to exist, during the early part of the 1980s, 2 antigenically and genetically distinct lineages of influenza 
B emerged: B/Yamagata and B/Victoria.  
The 3 influenza virus types share no common virus-coded antigens and differ in epidemiology and to 
some degree in the severity of illness caused. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation 
Clinical manifestation of influenza virus infection is characterized by an abrupt onset of nonspecific 
respiratory and systemic effects, such as fever, myalgia, headache, malaise, non-productive cough, 
sore throat and rhinitis (Monto et al. 2000). Influenza is generally self-limited and an uncomplicated 
disease. It can, however, be associated with severe morbidity and mortality in healthy children and 
certain groups of children and adults who are at increased risk of severe or complicated illness from 
influenza. Complications such as febrile convulsions, croup, acute otitis media, lower respiratory 
infections and encephalitis may arise in children as a consequence of the primary influenza infection, or 
as a result of secondary bacterial infections (Heikkinen et al. 1991). In older adults, pulmonary 
complications of influenza are most common and include secondary bacterial infection. Among others, 
acute respiratory infections can exacerbate asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
or lead to decompensation of patients with congestive heart failure or diabetes mellitus and 
subsequently lead to an increased risk of myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident (Gordon 
and Reingold 2018). 
2.1.5.  Management  
There is no effective treatment for influenza, and clinical management is based mostly on symptomatic 
treatment. Few antiviral drugs are available which may be able to reduce disease severity and 
duration, but they need to be taken soon after infection in order to be effective and can induce drug-
resistant mutants. Influenza antivirals target the viral NA protein (zanamivir and oseltamivir), or the 
M2 protein (amantadine and rimantadine). The latter two are no longer recommended due to high level 
of resistance (>99%) in circulating viruses since 2009. Viruses resistant to the NA inhibitors have also 
increased dramatically after 2007 with the majority of seasonal H1N1 viruses (pre-pandemic 2009) 
exhibiting oseltamivir resistance.  
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 11/194 
 
 
 
Vaccination is considered the best approach to lower the burden of influenza disease. Currently, 
different seasonal inactivated (split virion or subunit) influenza vaccines (quadrivalent and trivalent) 
are licensed for children, adolescents and adults aged 6 months and older, as well as a live attenuated 
influenza vaccine licensed for children and adolescents aged 2 years to 17 years of age. 
In order to prevent influenza, annual vaccination against influenza is recommended in most risk groups 
for older adults (≥60 or ≥65 years) and individuals with underlying conditions, such as COPD, heart 
conditions, diabetes, that leave them at high risk of influenza disease and associated complications. In 
addition, some countries have general recommendations for influenza vaccination of healthy children.  
The protection afforded by conventional inactivated influenza vaccines is driven by how well the strains 
in the vaccine match the viruses that circulate during influenza season (antigenic match).  
Further, the protection provided by conventional inactivated influenza vaccines in young children can 
be more limited than in older children and adults due to the immaturity of their immune system. In 
older adults, immune responses against conventional trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines have been 
shown to be lower than in younger adults, and, in line with this, clinical vaccine efficacy estimates were 
lower in older adults (17% to 53 %) as compared to younger adults (70% to 90%) (Goodwin et al. 
2006). 
About the product 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product (FP) is presented as a suspension for injection containing adjuvanted influenza 
virus surface antigens (haemagglutinin and neuraminidase), inactivated, as active ingredients.  
Each single dose contains either 7.5 mcg or 15 mcg of haemagglutinin from each of the four influenza 
virus strains recommended by the WHO and endorsed by CHMP/EMA for the manufacture of influenza 
vaccine for the current seasons. The adjuvant is MF59C.1 (MF59), which is an oil-in-water emulsion 
containing squalene as the internal oil phase, sodium citrate – citric acid buffer as the external 
aqueous phase and polysorbate and sorbitan trioleate as emulsifiers.  
The product was developed as 0.25 ml (7.5 mcg HA/strain) and 0.5 ml (15 mcg HA/strain) suspensions 
for injection in pre-filled syringe (type I glass) with plunger stopper (bromobutyl) and is presented with 
or without attached needle. During the procedure the Applicant withdrew the paediatric indication; the 
0.25 ml strength, which was intended for use in the paediatric population, is therefore not authorised.  
Other ingredients are: sodium chloride, potassium chloride, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 
disodium phosphate dihydrate, magnesium chloride hexahydrate, calcium chloride dihydrate and water 
for injections. 
Fluad tetra is also referred to as the adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine (aQIV) finished product 
in this application. Initially, the applicant claimed NAS status for the active substance contained in 
aQIV finished product. However, based on the initial review of the data by CHMP, the active substances 
contained in the medicinal product Fluad Tetra were not qualified as a new active substance in 
comparison to the products previously authorised in the European Union. The NAS application was 
withdrawn by the Applicant. Thus, this application does not now include a new active substance claim.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The active substance (AS) is a sterile suspension containing, predominantly the purified outer 
membrane proteins, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) antigens from the four influenza 
virus strains recommended every year by the WHO/CHMP. Although there are actually four active 
substances from each of the four influenza strains, they are collectively referred to as the active 
substance in this report. Traces of viral envelope parts may be present. 
Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on the HA and NA proteins on the surface of the 
virus. Influenza B is not classified according to subtype. Both the influenza A subtypes and influenza B 
viruses can be further broken down into different strains that change as the influenza viruses evolve. 
Each year, the four strains used in the seasonal influenza vaccine consist of one influenza A (H1N1) 
virus, one influenza A (H3N2) virus, and two influenza B viruses. There are two lineages of the B 
strains, B Victoria and B Yamagata. Both influenza type A and B viruses undergo minor antigenic 
variation within a subtype, probably resulting from a series of point mutations and selection. This may 
effectively challenge subtype-specific immunity within an inter-pandemic period. 
Fluad tetra consists of four separate inactivated subunit influenza virus antigen concentrates which are 
prepared in embryonated chicken eggs, each referred to as a monovalent pooled harvest (MPH). The 
MPH from each of the four selected viral strains is combined to produce the quadrivalent bulk product. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The four AS are produced and tested by Seqirus Vaccines Ltd (Liverpool, UK). This is also the site of 
manufacture and release testing for master and working seeds. Testing for mycoplasma for the 
working seed is performed by a contract laboratory. Appropriate evidence of GMP compliance for all 
sites has been provided. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The monovalent pool manufacturing process can be divided into two primary production stages: 
production of the inactivated bulk fluid and production of the sterile filtered monovalent pooled harvest 
(MPH) post sterile-filtration, where some parameters are listed as strain specific.  
It is acknowledged that the settings of some process steps need to be amended due to strain-specific 
characteristics and therefore some flexibility in the process descriptions is considered acceptable. 
These production/control steps comprise the seed preparation, virus cultivation (incubation conditions), 
virus inactivation conditions, purification conditions, splitting conditions, and optimisation of the 
reference standards for the single radial immunodiffusion (SRID) test (identity and potency test). 
Briefly, embryonated chicken eggs are inoculated with a virus inoculum prepared from the working 
seed (WS). Then, the eggs are incubated at an optimum temperature depending on the strain for 
maximum virus yield. After incubation, the eggs are cooled before harvesting of the allantoic fluid. The 
harvested allantoic fluid is then centrifuged, filtered, and concentrated. After concentration, virus 
inactivation is achieved by adding a formaldehyde solution and heating, for a period of time, under 
strain-specific conditions. 
Inactivated allantoic fluid is concentrated and purified (strain-specific concentrations). The inactivated 
virus is collected and diafiltered. 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 13/194 
 
 
 
After diafiltration, the pool is adjusted to give a whole virus concentrate with protein content suitable 
for the solubilisation process (strain-specific adjustment). The surface antigens are then solubilised 
using a detergent polysorbate 80 and the antigens split from the virus core using a splitting agent, 
CTAB. The residual sub-viral particles and residual CTAB are removed. Then, a stabilising solution is 
added to the subunit supernatant pool which is sterile filtered to produce the MPH (AS) into bio process 
containers (BPC). 
Alternatively, select strains may undergo an alternative pathway in which they are concentrated via an 
ultrafiltration/diafiltration step, followed by filtration. This final step is required for strains which are 
not high yielding. 
Reprocessing is not claimed. The sterile MPH is transferred to the formulation site via refrigerated (2 to 
8°C) trucks. Upon arrival, the integrity of the shipment (including temperature data and controls as 
well as documentation) is verified and the pools are placed in storage at 2 to 8°C. 
A section containing a list of steps that require strain specific modifications together with the general 
outline of the studies used to investigate the strain specific conditions are included in the CTD. 
The batch size for the production of a single monovalent bulk is determined by the number of 
harvested production eggs. The resulting number of vaccine doses is dependent upon the HA 
concentration of the individual monovalent bulk lots. The manufacturing process controls are suitably 
defined. 
Control of materials 
A list of the compendial raw materials used in the production of monovalent bulk antigen is provided. 
These materials do not contain any human or animal-derived components, sera, or dyes.  
A list of the non-compendial raw materials is also provided.  
The chicken embryonated eggs used for the preparation of master and working seeds are produced by 
chicken flocks free from specified pathogens (SPF). The SPF status of the flock is established according 
to the Ph. Eur. monograph Chapter 5.2.2 ‘Chicken Flocks free from Specified Pathogens for the 
Production and Quality Control of Vaccines’. Production eggs are derived from clinically healthy flocks 
from several farms, which are periodically audited by Seqirus.  
Example certificates of analysis (CoA) for each of the vendor-supplied materials are provided. All non-
compendial ingredients are tested to ensure compliance with their specification. Information related to 
the buffers and solutions used during the manufacturing process is also submitted.  
Influenza virus strains are selected, based on the annual regional health authority recommendations, 
based on surface antigen composition for the quadrivalent vaccine. Influenza virus reference strains, 
as recommended annually by national regulatory authorities, are provided by WHO collaborating 
centres and used to prepare master seed (MS) and working seed (WS) lots for each season. MS and 
WS may be carried over from one season to the next if the same strains are needed.  
The MS is produced within the allantoic cavity of Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) eggs using the strain-
specific incubation parameters. The MS is tested for haemagglutinating titre and sterility.  
The WS represents a single passage from the MS and is produced at a larger scale, again using strain-
specific incubation parameters. The WS is tested for HA and NA identity, mycoplasma, sterility and 
infectivity. 
Gene sequence data for influenza strains used for the first time will be provided for future annual strain 
submissions or as a separate follow-on submission, as for other EU inactivated influenza vaccines.  
The provided information on the starting materials is considered appropriate.

Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The in-process controls (IPCs) used in the manufacturing process of the AS are reported. Critical 
process parameters have also been defined. 
Relevant process attributes are monitored and controlled by alert/action limits. Overall, the control 
strategy is considered acceptable. 
Process validation 
Validation reports of the entire MPH manufacturing process, viral inactivation and splitting efficiency for 
each influenza strain, together with shipping studies have been provided. The most recent, commercial 
scale, process validation, encompassing the whole AS production process was performed. 
Sufficient information has been provided in support of the inactivation procedures. These procedures 
will assure a sufficient safety margin in terms of risk of residual infective influenza particles potentially 
being present in the AS. It is noted that the inactivation characterisation validation studies (for 
inactivation and splitting) are performed for every new influenza strain which will be introduced 
following the annual WHO recommendation and these studies will be assessed as part of the Annual 
Update variation procedure. For process steps that may require strain specific modification, a general 
outline of the studies used to investigate the strain specific conditions, and the specific modifications 
required are presented. Overall, the release and in-process data presented demonstrate suitable 
validation of the AS manufacturing process. 
Manufacturing process development 
The AS manufacturing process for aQIV has been developed based upon that of the trivalent products -
TIV (Agrippal)/adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine -aTIV (Fluad) approved in Europe. The AS 
manufacturing process was developed at Seqirus’ predecessor’s sites in Italy prior to it being 
transferred to the commercial manufacturing site, which is now known as Seqirus Vaccines Ltd. 
(Liverpool, UK). 
Following initial development of the manufacturing process, process changes were introduced in the 
MPH manufacturing process between 1994 and 1997 to improve the purity. Additional changes in the 
MPH manufacturing process were performed after the 2001/2002 influenza season. 
In 2010/2011, the MPH production process through to the pre sterile-filtration stage was transferred 
from Seqirus’ predecessor’s sites in Italy to Seqirus Vaccines Ltd (Liverpool, UK) and successfully 
validated. Therefore, all MPH production since this time has been at Seqirus, Liverpool. 
Since 2011, several changes have been introduced in the MPH manufacturing process. The changes 
introduced since 2011 are described and supported by comparative batch analysis results for batches 
manufactured with the current and the proposed manufacturing processes. These changes have been 
proven to have no impact upon the subsequent MPH manufacturing process and are further supported 
by comparability and process validation. Additional changes to the production process/controls have 
been introduced after the process performance qualification (PPQ) and clinical batch manufacture. It 
has been shown that there are no differences in quality attributes between concentrated or non-
concentrated product and that all product quality specifications were met.  
There is a long manufacturing history leading to significant product/process understanding which is 
mainly gained by ‘traditional’ development approaches and, to some extent, by enhanced product 
development in more recent years using state-of-the-art Quality by Design approaches by performing 
small scale development studies. The proposed commercial production process and controls can be 
considered typical for classical influenza vaccine production. Details of the AS batches (from Seqirus 
Vaccines Ltd. [Liverpool] and Seqirus’ predecessor’s site in Italy) used in each FP batch produced at 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 15/194 
 
 
 
Seqirus’ predecessor’s site in Italy (clinical batches) and Seqirus Inc. (Holly Springs, US) (PPQ batches) 
have been presented including the scale of production and date of production. The presented data 
sufficiently demonstrate comparability between the AS batches used in the FP clinical lots and PPQ 
batches/commercial process (acknowledging the differences due to strain-specific characteristics). 
Characterisation 
The AS for each of the four influenza strains selected each year is a sterile suspension containing 
predominantly the purified outer membrane HA and NA proteins of the influenza virus strains 
recommended every year by the WHO/CHMP. The viral envelope parts (core proteins) may be present 
in traces. 
The crystal structure of HA has been determined to atomic resolution for the native HA; for HA bound 
to a number of different receptor analogues; for proteolytic fragments of HA which have gone through 
the conformational changes required for mediating membrane fusion and for HA complexed with 
neutralising antibody. 
The structure of the NA protein has been determined with structural studies of NA complexed with 
specific monoclonal antibodies, by electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography amino acid sequencing, 
and gene sequencing. 
HA and NA characterisation studies will be performed on the first three lots of each new influenza 
strain to confirm the identity, purity, and suitability of the two antigens (HA and NA). The testing 
program is comprised of: SRID measurements; SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide 
gel electrophoresis); and NA identity (and NA enzymatic activity) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA).  
The presented characterisation data on the vaccine antigens is considered appropriate to verify the 
relevant quality attributes beyond the quality attributes routinely tested for batch release purposes. 
Although the presented data and characterisation strategy are accepted, the applicant is recommended 
to extend the information about the analytical procedures used for characterisation purposes, where 
these do not concern the validated and routinely applied analytical methods for batch release purposes 
(see recommendations).  
The impurities of MPH have been characterised. Impurities were classified as process-related impurities 
(which include ovalbumin, bioburden, endotoxin, formaldehyde, polysorbate 80, CTAB, antibiotics and 
hydrocortisone) and product-related impurities (for which adequate control is described). Ovalbumin, 
formaldehyde, CTAB, and endotoxin are controlled as part of routine MPH release testing. Bioburden is 
controlled and the AS release specification includes a sterility test. Only traces of hydrocortisone and 
antibiotics may be present in the AS. In conclusion, the level of control of product-related and process-
related impurities meets the Ph.Eur. requirements for influenza vaccine (surface antigen, inactivated) 
as outlined in Ph.Eur. monograph 07/2019:0869. These impurities have been present in product used 
in clinical studies. 
Specification 
The specifications proposed for all MPHs include general tests (appearance), identity tests 
(haemagglutinin identity and content, neuraminidase identity), and tests for purity (sterility, viral 
inactivation, non-HA protein, endotoxin, process-related impurities). IPC tests include pH and non-HA 
protein. The proposed IPCs and specification tests and acceptance criteria are acceptable. 
The control AS strategy, including a specification for appearance and the IPC tests, is considered 
appropriate.

Analytical methods 
A description of each analytical method performed is provided. The quality attributes (QAs) routinely 
tested at the level of the MPH are in line with the Ph.Eur. monograph on Influenza vaccine (surface 
antigen, inactivated) (07/2019:0869). 
SRID is used to determine both HA titre (potency) and identity. The sample being assayed is treated to 
allow the diffusion of antigens into an agarose gel containing either homologous or heterologous 
antiserum. In homologous antiserum, the antigens will form a precipitation ring which is then 
visualised using Coomassie blue staining. The diameter of the precipitation ring is then compared with 
those obtained using dilutions of known standard reference antigen in order to determine HA titre. 
Identity is confirmed by precipitation in homologous antiserum and a lack of precipitation in the 
heterologous antiserum. The HA titre is determined using the parallel line association method. Data 
generated under the parallel line methodology is further calculated to provide the 95% lower 
confidence limit. 
Description of the analytical procedures and their validation is sufficiently detailed. Appropriate 
information about the validation of the analytical procedures is provided. Sufficient information has 
been provided in support of the applied SRID to determine the HA content in the vaccine. The annual 
SRID verification will be provided as part of all future aQIV annual strain update submissions to 
document assay performance in support of the campaign product formulation. 
Batch analysis 
Certificates of analysis (CoAs) of an appropriate number of batches for each influenza strain (H1N1, 
H3N2, B-Yamagata and B-Victoria lineages) manufactured at commercial scale at Seqirus Vaccines Ltd. 
(Liverpool, UK) (used in the MPH process qualification) have been provided. All of them comply with 
the specifications. Batch data comprising three MPHs for each new strain will be provided as part of the 
Annual Update variation. 
Reference materials 
Influenza reference antigens for strain characterisation and Influenza antiserum reagents for vaccine 
standardisation are provided by WHO Collaborating Centres. The reference antigen and antiserum 
reagents are used to calibrate the haemagglutinin content of inactivated Influenza vaccines by the 
SRID test. The procedure for SRID reagents qualification is provided and an example reagent 
qualification report is also included. The antigen/antiserum reagents used during seasonal campaigns 
will be qualified, and the reagent qualification reports provided. 
Container closure 
The monovalent bulk is stored in 50-200L Bio-Process Containers (BPCs). The BPCs comply with US 
and European requirements (Ph.Eur. 3.2.2.1 on Plastic containers for aqueous solutions for parenteral 
infusions. Certificates of analysis including certificates of irradiation and results from an extractable 
study have been submitted. It has been justified why additional leaching studies are not needed. 
Stability 
A shelf life and storage conditions for the AS were proposed by the company. The shelf life was 
supported by results of stability studies with an appropriate number of lots produced at commercial 
scale and according to the commercial manufacturing process for each specified strain filled into a 
container representative of the production containers and stored at the intended storage conditions 
and at accelerated storage conditions.  
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 17/194 
 
 
 
In addition, each year an appropriate number of production batches for each strain will be entered into 
the stability program at the intended storage condition, as well as under accelerated and stressed 
conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed 
shelf life and storage conditions in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a combination of MPH, MF59C.1 adjuvant and buffer solutions. The vaccine is 
presented as a 0.5 mL single dose sterile suspension for injection in a milky-white emulsion, contained 
in a Type I glass pre-filled syringe with or without an affixed needle. It is an adjuvanted inactivated 
subunit influenza vaccine. 
The surface antigens are isolated from two influenza A subtypes, H1N1 and H3N2, and two influenza B 
strains, one from the B-Yamagata lineage and one from the B-Victoria lineage. The antigens are the 
viral surface proteins haemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Each year virus strains from H1N1 and H3N2 
and B influenza strains from the B-Yamagata lineage and the B-Victoria lineage are selected for 
inclusion in the aQIV finished product.  
The naturally occurring form of the HA protein, as a component of the influenza virus, is a trimer – 
three identical “subunits” come together, via non-covalent bonds, to create the active protein. This is 
the structure that allows the virus to infect a cell and to which the most effective immune response is 
generated. The surface antigens are formulated with MF59C.1 adjuvant in the final aQIV finished 
product. The aQIV formulation contains a nominal total of 60 μg of HA antigen per 0.5 ml dose. The 
excipient concentration is the same as used in Fluad trivalent (aTIV) (including the MF59C.1 adjuvant). 
The excipients used for the aQIV formulation include: sodium chloride (isotonic aid); potassium 
chloride (buffer); potassium dihydrogen phosphate (buffer); disodium phosphate dihydrate (buffer); 
magnesium chloride hexahydrate (stabiliser); calcium chloride dihydrate (stabiliser); MF59C.1 
(adjuvant -squalene, polysorbate 80, sorbitan trioleate, sodium citrate); water for injections (diluent). 
All components comply with the current edition of the USP and Ph. Eur. monographs, as applicable, 
except for squalene for which no monograph currently exists, and which complies with an in-house 
specification. There are no novel excipients used. An overfill of 0.1 mL is included to permit withdrawal 
of the nominal syringe volume. An HA overage is also included (which is specific to a particular strain). 
The batches used to perform clinical trials were manufactured at Seqirus’ predecessor’s site in Italy. 
Vaccines with different antigenic composition have been used in clinical trials, based on the WHO 
recommendations for the indicated years. A technical transfer of the formulation, filling, and packaging 
process of the egg-based adjuvanted influenza vaccine from at Seqirus’ predecessor’s site in Italy to 
the commercial FP manufacturing site Seqirus Inc. (Holly Springs, USA), where the batches relevant 
for the present MAA submission were manufactured, was performed. A comparability strategy was 
employed between the Italian and Holly Springs sites, addressing facilities and equipment, raw 
materials, consumables, process parameters and controls, hold times, specifications, product 
equivalency and critical quality attributes, primary packaging, and leachables and extractables. An 
analytical comparability assessment confirming that the transfer from the Italian site to the Holly 
Springs site has not affected the formulation manufacturing process or the quality of the final product 
was provided.

MF59C.1 adjuvant 
MF59C.1 adjuvant is an oil-in-water emulsion with a squalene internal oil phase and a sodium citrate – 
citric acid buffer external aqueous phase. The emulsion is stabilised by inclusion of two non-ionic 
surfactants (polysorbate 80-tween 80 and sorbitan trioleate-span). The primary ingredient of MF59C.1 
adjuvant is squalene, which is a highly unsaturated hydrocarbon that naturally occurs in many animals 
and some plants.  
The mechanism of action of MF59 to enhance the immune response is well known. Normal tissue-
resident monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells are activated by MF59 in the muscle, and 
respond by inducing a mixture of chemokines, which results in the migration of immune cells into the 
injection site. The recruited cells, including monocytes and granulocytes, also produce the same factors 
on contact with MF59 to further amplify the building chemokine gradient. This results in dramatic 
signal amplification and a significant influx of phagocytic cells. The higher number of cells available 
results in more efficient transport of antigen to the lymph nodes. In addition, MF59 may enhance and 
accelerate the differentiation of cells toward dendritic cells and alter their phenotype. According to the 
company, no significant interaction between the adjuvant and antigen is expected based on literature 
and their product development strategy. 
MF59C.1 manufacture is performed by Seqirus Inc. (Holly Springs, US). Testing and release is 
performed by Seqirus Inc. (Holly Springs, US) and Seqirus Vaccines Ltd (Liverpool, UK). 
The nature and composition of MF59C.1 has changed throughout the development of the aQIV finished 
product. The changes in nature and composition of MF59C.1 were introduced before the clinical trials 
with the aQIV Influenza finished product. Comparability between MF59C.1 manufactured before and 
after the changes was demonstrated. Comparability studies sufficiently show that these materials are 
comparable. 
MF59C.1 bulk adjuvant is produced at a 350 L scale. Reprocessing is not permitted at any stage of the 
MF59C.1 bulk adjuvant process. To prepare the emulsion, the components are added to the pre-mixing 
tank. The material is passed through an inline mixer to form a crude premix. The crude premix is then 
passed back and forth through a microfluidiser to produce a fine emulsion. The microfluidised bulk is 
sterile filtered and filled into sterile Flexbag containers. The product contact layer of the flexible bags is 
compliant with Ph. Eur. requirements for Containers and Tubing for Parenteral Nutrition Preparations 
and is certified TSE/BSE free. The filtered bulk is stored at 2-8ºC for up to 5 years. 
A list of the materials used in the production of MF59C.1 bulk adjuvant is provided. With the exception 
of squalene, these materials do not contain any human or animal-derived components. Details 
regarding the specifications and test methodologies used for control are also provided. All other 
materials are compendial. Appropriate process controls (including critical process parameters and in-
process controls) are defined for its manufacture. The MF59C.1 bulk adjuvant process validation has 
been successfully completed with three consecutive batches at representative scale at Seqirus Inc. 
(Holly Springs, US). The process validation parameters were within the respective normal operating 
ranges and met all acceptance criteria specified. 
The specifications for release of MF59C.1 include tests for identity (appearance, squalene identity and 
content), pH, particle size, content of the emulsifying agents, endotoxin and bioburden, and carbonyl 
content.  
Batch analyses for several lots are presented (including validation/stability lots) all produced at Seqirus 
Inc. (Holly Springs, US). All batches complied with the specifications approved at the time of release. 
Manufacture has also been appropriately validated.

Sterile MF59C.1 bulk adjuvant is stored at 2-8ºC up to 6 months. Photostability, long-term stability, 
and accelerated stability studies were performed to establish appropriate storage conditions and shelf 
life for MF59C.1 Adjuvant Bulk. The shelf-life of MF59C.1 Bulk Adjuvant and storage conditions have 
been agreed in the dosser, when the bulk adjuvant is stored in flex bags and protected from light. 
Additional long-term stability studies are currently on-going and accelerated (stability studies have 
been performed using flex bag containers from the approved vendor on the process validation batches. 
All parameters tested remained within specification up to the tested time-point. The available data 
support the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions. 
The information provided was acceptable. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
aQIV vaccine finished product manufacturing, packaging, testing and batch control sites are specified 
in the dossier. 
The finished product will be released at: 
•  Seqirus Vaccines Ltd., Liverpool, UK 
•  Seqirus Netherlands B.V., Amsterdam, the Netherlands 
Prior to implementation of Brexit, Seqirus Vaccines Ltd (Liverpool) will be a site responsible for 
importation into the EU. Seqirus Netherlands B.V. is the site responsible for EU release testing and 
batch release. The UK site will need to be removed by variation as a site responsible for importation 
into the EU at the time of Brexit implementation.  
The target batch size for Fluad tetra is specified. aQIV is manufactured as an aseptic formulation in a 
closed system. Formulation involves the addition of the required four MPHs, phosphate buffered saline 
(PBS), water for injection (WFI), a stabilising solution and MF59C.1 adjuvant to a formulation vessel. 
The components are mixed and sampled for testing. The influenza monovalent bulks, PBS buffer and 
MF59C.1 adjuvant produced from the stored bulk adjuvant are sterile filtered prior to formulation.  
During the procedure, the applicant was requested to introduce a point of fill filtration (sterilising filter 
immediately prior to formulation transfer to an intermediate small volume container, ahead of filling 
into the final container). The applicant subsequently provided a detailed plan to improve the sterility 
assurance further for the aQIV filling although it was accepted that the existing information does 
support sufficient sterility assurance for authorisation (see recommendations). The batch formula for 
the aQIV finished product depends on the hemagglutinin (HA) content of the monovalent bulk. The HA 
antigen content of each strain varies from lot to lot. Therefore, based on the HA concentration of each 
monovalent bulk, the weight of HA antigen for each of four strains is calculated and the amount of the 
other finished product components are adjusted according to a defined quantitative formulation. 
Reprocessing is not permitted at any stage of the finished product manufacturing process. Appropriate 
critical process parameters are provided together with their proven acceptable ranges. These ranges 
are adequately justified by process development studies.  
The process is composed of three process steps each of which has been validated: sterile filtration of 
MF59C.1; formulation process; filling process. The scope of the process validation at the commercial 
site, Holly Springs included production of formulated bulk and filling of formulated bulk and was 
performed at the commercial production scale. Validated analytical methods have been used during 
process validation.  
The influenza strains used for manufacture of the PPQ aQIV batches were described. Process 
performance qualification runs were performed for the MF59C.1 sterile filtration into bags. All key 
Assessment report

process parameters, critical process parameters and performance parameters (critical and non-critical 
quality attributes), were evaluated for each of the PPQ runs. The hold time for sterile MF59C.1 
adjuvant was also validated.  
An appropriate number of PPQ runs were successfully executed for finished product formulation and 
filling. All data generated for the PPQ were assessed against the established acceptance criteria, 
including CPPs, KPPs, and performance parameters (critical and non-critical quality attributes). Data 
evaluation included process automation historical data, batch reports, and in-process and release test 
results. Inspection, labelling, packaging and shipping of filled units was independently qualified and 
performed during process validation. 
The maximum process times and temperatures for the formulation process and filling process and the 
maximum hold times and storage temperatures of the sterile MF59C.1 and formulated bulk along with 
a justification of these maximum process times/hold times were provided.  
Finished product Container closure system 
aQIV is supplied to the market in single dose 0.5 mL pre-filled syringes. It should be noted that 
according to EU legislation, a type II variation should be submitted for any change in immediate 
packaging of a sterile biological finished product. The primary container is a barrel made of neutral 
clear glass, type I (Ph.Eur.) which has a total volume of 1 ml with or without a needle. The plunger 
stopper is made of latex-free bromobutyl rubber formulation, type I (Ph.Eur.). The syringe without a 
needle contains a Luer-Lock adaptor to ensure a better and stronger connection of the disposable 
needle to the syringe.  
An extractables and simulation study was performed to identify and to estimate the compounds that 
may be extracted from the tip caps and plunger stoppers for aQIV syringes upon contact with model 
solvents. The study concluded that there is negligible toxicological concern for any of the leachables 
detected in the study as they are present at very low levels. 
Product specification 
The specifications proposed for release of the final quadrivalent bulk vaccine contains appropriate tests 
for identity (appearance, haemagglutinin identity for each of the 4 strains, squalene identity), potency 
(haemagglutinin content for each of the four strains), squalene content, purity (non-HA protein, 
ovalbumin, CTAB, sterility, absence of live virus, endotoxin), and physicochemical attributes (particle 
size, osmolality, pH).  
The specification for the final filled vaccine includes appropriate tests for identity (appearance, 
haemagglutinin identity for each of the four strains, squalene identity), potency (haemagglutinin 
content for each of the four strains), squalene content, purity tests (sterility, endotoxin), 
physicochemical attributes (particle size, pH), and extractable volume.  
The specification for the packed product contains appropriate tests for identity (appearance, 
haemagglutinin identity for each of the four strains) and pH.  
The proposed release specifications for the finished product, filled vaccine and packed product are 
acceptable and are based on the Ph. Eur. monographs 0869 (influenza vaccine; surface antigen, 
inactivated) and 0153 (Vaccines for human use) supplemented with tests to control the adjuvant 
characteristics. 
Labelled syringes are packaged in cartons and placed in cases for final storage and shipment.

Analytical methods 
There are seven non-compendial analytical procedures used for release testing, all of which have been 
validated. The compendial methods used have been appropriately validated/verified. See AS analytical 
section for details of the SRID assay. 
Batch analysis 
An appropriate number of process performance qualification batches of aQIV were formulated and filled 
into pre-filled syringes at the Seqirus Inc. (Holly springs, US) site. All the results for the five PPQ 
batches met the acceptance criteria.  
The only process impurities in the finished product are those carried over from the manufacture of MPH 
and MF59C.1. These impurities are controlled at the MPH and MF59C.1 manufacturing stage. Process-
related impurities from the active substance manufacturing process include (but are not limited to) 
ovalbumin, residual chemicals, including formaldehyde, CTAB, and polysorbate 80. Seqirus updated the 
Section 3.2.P.5.5 Characterisation of Impurities by the addition of a detailed risk assessment for 
elemental impurities in accordance with ICH Q3D as part of the D180 response. Appropriate microbial 
detection assays, sterility and endotoxin assays are in place. All specified impurities have been present 
in product used in clinical studies. Testing is performed to confirm that no live virus is present, with a 
specification limit of ‘absence of live virus’. 
Reference materials 
The reference antigen and antiserum reagents used to calibrate the SRID assay are provided every 
year by WHO Collaborating Centres. 
Stability of the product 
A 12-month shelf life is proposed for the FP at 2-8°C, protected from light. 
The stability evaluation of aQIV in the proposed commercial packaging for an appropriate number of 
PPQ batches has been completed through 18 months from the date of manufacture at the intended 
storage condition of 5 ± 3°C and under accelerated and stressed conditions for up to four weeks. The 
studies were performed in line with ICH Q5C Stability Testing of Biotechnological/Biological Products. 
All data generated on these PPQ batches under the intended storage condition have met the proposed 
stability specification and demonstrated no significant change for any quality attributes assessed, 
which included appropriate stability-indicating parameters.  
In addition, supportive data of two 0.5 ml batches used in clinical studies has been presented. It can 
be concluded that stability of the 0.5 ml presentation is sufficiently substantiated.  
Additionally, upon approval, representative commercial batches will also be placed on long-term 
stability in line with 3.2.P.8.2 Post Approval Stability Commitment.  
At 2-8 °C no relevant changes were observed with the exception of the HA content. As can be 
expected, a decline in potency was observed during storage, particularly for the H1N1 and H3N2 
strains. The applicant confirmed that the long-term stability results of the PPQ batches met the 
proposed EU specification for the HA lower confidence limit of ≥ 80% of label claim. 
Each year, three batches of finished product are entered into the stability program at the intended 
storage condition of 5 ± 3°C, as well as at least one lot under accelerated and stressed conditions.  
A 12-month shelf life for the FP at 2-8°C, protected from light, is supported by the provided data.

Post approval change management protocol(s)  
Seqirus plans to transfer the finished product formulation and fill/finish operations to other sites post 
approval.  
The company has submitted an adequate post approval change management protocol containing all 
the information as indicated in EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/586330/2010 Questions and answers on post 
approval change management protocols.  
Adventitious agents 
Data of viral inactivation studies carried out in 1993 and 1994 have been presented. These inactivation 
studies were not performed according to the requirements of Ph. Eur. 0158. The applicant explains 
that, since 1999, viral inactivation has however been tested according to the Ph. Eur. requirements on 
the first three production lots of every new strain. This is acceptable. A re-qualification of the 
inactivation and splitting steps was carried out in 2002/2003 due to an increase in the number of 
production eggs.  
Additional viral clearance studies were also performed many years ago for Avian Leucosis Virus (as 
relevant virus) and Bovine Adenovirus (as a model for adenoviruses). Based on the results inactivation 
process parameters were set.  
Results of the validation studies for the removal/inactivation of mycoplasma are also presented.  
Although the results presented were reassuring, the applicant was requested to update the text to 
include reference to the current supplier of eggs and the controls implemented at the site. Three egg 
suppliers are currently approved and qualified. These are now listed in Section 3.2.A.2.7 and the 
specific requirements presented. The risk assessment addresses the control of the adventitious agents 
by the most current manufacturing process.  
The applicant has followed the EMA GL on Influenza Vaccine –Quality module. The potential risks as 
regards the introduction of adventitious agents at the different stages (prior) of seed preparation and 
AS, FP production have been addressed.  
With regards to TSE, the only animal derived materials identified are the eggs and the squalene from 
the adjuvant. Both are considered to pose no TSE risk. This is accepted. In addition, the applicant 
concludes that the extraction process for squalene, which includes steps for alkaline treatment, 
elevated temperature and distillation, is expected to inactivate and/or eliminate any viral contaminant. 
Considering the clinical experience accumulated with this adjuvant, no further requests are considered 
necessary 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Fluad Tetra (aQIV) is a seasonal surface antigen inactivated influenza vaccine, adjuvanted with 
MF59C.1. aQIV contains predominantly HA and NA surface antigens from each of the four influenza 
strains (Type A/H1N1, Type A/H3N2, Type B (Yamagata Lineage) and Type B (Victoria Lineage)), 
recommended annually by the WHO and subsequently CHMP for the EU market. aQIV includes the 
adjuvant MF59C.1 (MF59), a squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion. 
Overall, the Quality Module 3 is of acceptable quality and most of the deficiencies detected were 
satisfactorily addressed, with some post approval recommendations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 23/194 
 
 
 
 
The manufacturing process and formulation of aQIV are similar to those of the registered adjuvanted 
trivalent Influenza vaccine (aTIV, Fluad) (some changes have been introduced in the active substance 
manufacturing process), with the exception of an additional B strain included in aQIV. aTIV has been 
registered in the EU since 1997 (as well as in many other countries worldwide, including US) for use in 
adults of 65 years of age and older. 
The AS (Monovalent Pooled Harvest, MPH) manufacturing process was developed at Seqirus’ 
predecessor’s sites in Italy prior to being transferred (and successfully validated) to Seqirus Vaccines 
Ltd, (Liverpool, UK) in 2010/2011. Therefore, all MPH production since this time has been at Seqirus, 
Liverpool. Information on the AS batches used in the manufacturing of the FP batches used in the 
(pivotal) clinical studies for the current MAA has been presented. 
Regarding the analytical procedures used for AS characterisation, the applicant is recommended to 
extend the description of these analytical procedures, where these do not concern the validated and 
routinely applied analytical methods for batch release purposes (recommendation 002). 
MF59C.1 Bulk Adjuvant is a stable oil-in-water emulsion in which oil droplets are dispersed within a 
citrate buffer continuous phase. Extensive information is provided on the starting materials/raw 
materials, (validation of) manufacturing and control of the MF59C.1 Bulk Adjuvant.  
The FP (aQIV vaccine) was originally manufactured at at Seqirus’ predecessor’s site in Italy and all 
clinical batches were manufactured at this site. Subsequently, as part of the company strategy, the 
manufacture of the FP along with MF59C.1 adjuvant were transferred to Seqirus Inc. (Holly Springs, 
US) and this is where the manufacture of the PPQ submission batches took place. The impact 
assessment of the identified differences between both sites did not give rise to concerns. Additional 
information was provided confirming that the transfer from the previous site to the Holly Springs site 
had not affected the formulation manufacturing process or the quality of the final product. Moreover, 
batch analysis data of the final formulated bulk and final FP of the batches used in the clinical studies 
could not be found in module 3 of the eCTD. This was considered a major objection as it could not be 
properly assessed whether the commercial product was similar to the product used in clinical trials. 
The major objection was solved because the submitted release testing data sufficiently indicated that 
the Bulk FP and Filled Product produced for the clinical trial and PPQ (and thus commercial production) 
can be considered comparable, taking into account the different strain composition of the tested 
vaccine lots. Although the CHMP agrees that the sterility assurance level is sufficient for this type of 
product, it is noted that the highest level of sterility assurance was not obtained by the chosen 
sterilisation process conditions. Seqirus has therefore provided a plan to improve sterility assurance by 
introduction of either a point of fill filtration (sterilising filter immediately prior to formulation transfer 
to an intermediate small volume container, ahead of filling into the final container) or point of use 
filtration (sterilising filter immediately prior to transfer to a bulk container into which the entire 
formulation is filled) in the manufacturing of the finished product (recommendation 003).  
Questions were raised on the specification (particularly the SRID potency assay) and FP stability that 
were appropriately solved. The applicant has committed to submit a study to demonstrate that the FP 
SRID using a mixed B standard is able to detect degradation of one B strain over the other. As the 
standards are strain specific, the study can be part of the next annual update (recommendation 004). 
A PACMP is included to transfer the finished product formulation and fill/finish operations to contract 
manufacturing sites.  
It is recommended that the applicant reviews the entire CTD and corrects inconsistencies related to the 
different products mentioned in the dossier (recommendation 001). Finally, based on the initial review 
of the data, the active substances contained in the medicinal product Fluad Tetra were not qualified as 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 24/194 
 
 
 
a new active substance in comparison to the products previously authorised in the European Union 
(Fluad and Agrippal) for the following reasons:  
• 
The product contains four active substances, not one active substance from a combination of 
four different strains, as claimed by the applicant. It has to be noted that strains from both lineages of 
influenza B have been components of approved trivalent influenza vaccines in previous influenza 
seasons, i.e. no new lineage of influenza B which could be qualified as NAS, is included in the Fluad 
Tetra composition. The same applies to the two influenza A subtypes. 
• 
The active substance manufacturing process is similar to the one registered for Fluad and 
Agrippal. This does not result in a novel type of active substance. 
• 
Influenza vaccines have a specific legal provision which permits change of the influenza 
antigens without leading to a new MA every influenza season even if a new influenza strain is included 
in an authorised vaccine. Therefore, qualification of the active substance of Fluad Tetra as NAS would 
thus be inconsistent with the legal provision. 
• 
From a regulatory perspective, an adjuvant is not part of the active substance(s). Therefore 
the adjuvant MF59C.1 (MF59) in Fluad Tetra cannot be considered in the context of the NAS 
assessment.  
• 
The active substances in Fluad Tetra do not differ significantly in properties with regard to 
safety and efficacy from the previously authorised substances. 
The CHMP’s scientific objection to this claim was also classified as a major objection. At D120 the NAS 
application was withdrawn by the applicant. Thus, this application does not now include a new active 
substance claim. This issue has therefore been solved. 
In summary, from a quality point of view, Fluad Tetra can be recommended for approval, together with 
a number of recommendations. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends four points for future quality development.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The Applicant has based the non-clinical development for the aQIV on studies performed with: aQIV, 
Fluad (aTIV), Agrippal (TIV), Aflunov/Foclivia (monovalent pandemic and pre-pandemic surface antigen 
adjuvanted formulations) and with the adjuvant. Pharmacology studies performed with Fluad 
formulations are relevant to aQIV because the similar active substance is used in both vaccines, 
although aQIV contains additional B strain antigen. Both vaccines contain the same amount of 
adjuvant and the manufacturing process is the same. The addition of antigen from a second B strain is 
not expected to change the pharmacological effect of the vaccine. Aflunov also contains the same 
amount of MF59 as aQIV, and the antigens in both vaccines are manufactured using a comparable 
process. Since the immune response has been adequately characterized with trivalent and monovalent 
formulations, and data are relevant to aQIV, limited work has been performed with aQIV.  
The Table 2 presents the composition of the various related vaccines and adjuvant formulations that 
are relevant to this dossier. The antigens in all the vaccines listed are manufactured using the licensed 
egg-based Agrippal process. During the non-clinical development of aTIV, various versions of the 
adjuvant were tested, including a water-based formulation (referred to as MF59 (water) or MF59-0). 
This formulation was later optimized by the addition of citrate buffer to provide increased stability 
(MF59C.1). Results with both formulations are relevant, as immunogenicity and safety are unaffected 
by the presence of citrate buffer. Both vaccines aQIV and aTIV contain MF59C.1.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The pharmacodynamic studies of vaccines involve measuring immunogenicity and protection induction 
by the vaccine. The pre-clinical program has been performed over a long period of time and includes 
testing seasonal HA antigens from different viral strains. In addition, a summary of studies performed 
with the monovalent H5N1 pandemic vaccine has also been provided. H5N1 and Fluad contain the 
same amount of MF59, and the antigens in both vaccines are manufactured using the same process to 
aQIV. The data obtained with H5N1 and aTIV are considered supportive of the adjuvant role of MF-59.  
Pharmacology studies examined the subcutaneous and intramuscular (the one intended to be used in 
humans) routes and included three animal species (mice, rabbits and ferrets), which are generally 
considered as adequate models to study influenza virus immunogenicity and viral infection. Several of 
the studies were performed with an old version of the adjuvant (that lacked citrate buffer). Although 
this change is not expected to have a major impact on the immunogenicity of the vaccine, these data 
can formally only be considered supportive of the immunogenicity of the MF-59 adjuvant. The studies 
performed included analyses of the humoral (using HI and microneutralization assays) and cellular 
immune response as well as proof of concept (challenge with pathogenic virus) studies.  
The pharmacology section included a study in mice (study. SEQ-01) in which the animals were 
administered different doses of adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine and with the same doses of 
HA from a single vaccine strain (either H1N1, H3N2, B Yamagata, or B Victoria) combined with MF59. 
This study showed that the elicitation of hemagglutinin inhibiting and neutralizing antibodies occurs in 
a dose-dependent manner. It was observed that MF59-adjuvanted antigens, formulated as aQIV or as 
individual strains, induced a CD4+ T cell response. 
The studies 94-0184 and 93-847 were old non-GLP studies where the animals were immunized 
subcutaneously (not intramuscular as intended in humans) with TIV with and without an old version of 
the adjuvant. The studies were indicative of the adjuvant role of MF-59 both in old and young mice and 
in animals seropositive at baseline due to a previous infection with an influenza virus.  
Data from non-GLP studies 94-0307, 94-0214 and 94-0215 were also performed long time ago. The 
animal model selected was mice. The animals were immunized intramuscularly with different doses of 
HA antigen with PBS or with an old version of the adjuvant. Antibody responses increased dose 
dependently. The addition of MF59 increased antibody responses. In studies MF-1/MF-2 2003/04 in 
which in old and young mice were dosed with the current version of MF-59 wherein different doses of 
antigen were tested. The data confirmed the previous studies conclusion regarding the capability of the 
adjuvant employed to enhance the immunization responses.  
The challenge experiments described in mice were designed as a continuation of the studies 94-0307, 
94-0214 and 94 0215. The mice were challenged with an intranasal infection by wild type influenza 
virus. The results reveal that mice immunized with the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine were protected 
against a challenge with an intranasal infection by wild type influenza virus.  
Four GLP studies performed in rabbits are recent studies (studies Nos. 486688, 6560-106, 488182 and 
AB09779) aimed to assess immunogenicity of aTIV or a formulation equivalent to aQIV (60µg per 
dose), the vaccines showed in all cases to be immunogenic and the antibody titers increased following 
a second or a third injection of the vaccine. However the studies did not include animals immunized 
with a non-adjuvanted vaccine so the adjuvant effect of MF-59 could not be tested. 
The data provided from the rabbit study in pregnant females reveals that titers were detected in 
female rabbits, their foetuses, and F1 kits. 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 27/194 
 
 
 
A brief summary of the preclinical immunogenicity data obtained with the pandemic H5N1 vaccine has 
been provided. The studies were performed in several animal species (mice, rabbit and ferret) using 
the final formulation of the MF-59 adjuvant but the vaccine tested is not a seasonal one since the 
strain included only one HA antigen from a virus of the H5 subtype (i.e. H5N1). The results from these 
studies showed that the vaccine was immunogenic and elicited an immune response that protected 
animals against an intranasal challenge with a homologous H5 viral strain.  
Overall, the pharmacology studies are in line with the requirements of current relevant. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No dedicated studies were performed regarding secondary pharmacodynamic. This is endorsed due to 
the nature of the product. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No dedicated studies were performed regarding safety pharmacology. This is endorsed due to the 
nature of the product and the available non clinical, clinical and post-marketing data with similar 
adjuvanted vaccines. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No dedicated studies were performed regarding secondary pharmacodynamic. This is endorsed due to 
the nature of the product. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
In accordance with current guidelines, pharmacokinetic studies are not required for the vaccine 
assessment. The distribution data obtained in mice with the adjuvant MF-59 do not raise any specific 
safety concern (Dupuis et al., 1999). The results in mice indicate that MF59 and a soluble antigen gD2 
from type 2 herpes simplex virus (HSV) distribute and are cleared independently after intramuscular 
injection. In another study in mice (Tegenge et al., 2016) in which a formulation similar to MF59 was 
administered with and without H5N1 antigen suggests that adjuvant AUC was slightly higher in the 
presence of the antigen. A population pharmacokinetic model based statistical analysis identified body 
weight and H5N1 antigen as covariates influencing the clearance of squalene. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicology program supporting the clinical development of aQIV consists of one GLP repeat dose 
rabbit toxicology study which tested a formulation equivalent to aQIV, and GLP studies with aTIV. 
Toxicology studies performed with aTIV are directly relevant to aQIV because although aQIV contains 
additional antigen, the same active substance is used in both vaccines, both vaccines contain the same 
amount of MF59, and the manufacturing process is similar. The addition of antigen from a second B 
strain does not substantially alter the impurity profile or the tolerability of the vaccine.  
The toxicology assessment has been carried out in a number of GLP non-pivotal and pivotal studies in 
guinea pigs and rabbits. Delayed contact hypersensitivity was assessed using the Magnusson-Kligman 
Maximization Test in guinea pigs while local and systemic was evaluated in rabbits.  
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 28/194 
 
 
 
 
The toxicology program is shown in the  
Table 3 below. 
Table 2: Outline of toxicity studies 
Single dose toxicity 
The lack of single dose toxicity studies is considered acceptable. The repeat dose toxicity assessment is 
considered sufficient for the evaluation.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Three GLP repeat dose toxicity studies are designated non-pivotal. These rabbit studies assessed aTIV 
compared to TIV or MF59 alone (study 940292), or aTIV compared to aTIV with a second experimental 
adjuvant (study 6560-106 and study 486688). Two intramuscular doses of vaccine were administered 
in each of these studies. The results were consistent with the established safety profile for aTIV, and 
there was no evidence of local or systemic toxicity. 
Study 488182 is considered a pivotal GLP study. The animal model was rabbit. The rabbits received 
saline, Fluad (aTIV), Fluad High B (aQIV equivalent) and Fluad High (H3+IC31) influenza vaccine 
formulations by 3 intramuscular injections. Although the aQIV was not among the formulations 
administered, one group received an “aQIV equivalent” since in addition to A/H3N1 and A/H1N1 
antigens (15 μg of HA per strain) it contained 30 μg of HA from a single B strain, rather than 15 μg of 
HA from each of 2 different B strains. Although it differs from the product to be marketed this is 
considered acceptable for the evaluation since the differences are not expected to result in a 
significantly dissimilar safety profile. In this study, the aQIV equivalent formulation was comparable to 
aTIV. The vaccines were well tolerated, and no evidence of toxicity was observed. Results showed no 
significant systemic toxicity but for some findings in lymph nodes that are compatible with the 
expected effects of vaccination.  
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 29/194 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were carried out due to the nature of the product and in line with the guidance 
on vaccines. The results of genotoxicity studies carried out using the adjuvant formulations of MF59 
have been submitted (refer to section “other toxicity studies”). 
Carcinogenicity 
The lack of carcinogenicity studies is endorsed due to the nature of the product and in line with current 
relevant guidelines. In addition, there are not toxicology findings that could be of concern and the final 
product does not contain any known formulation components or impurities at dose levels that would be 
expected to be of concern. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The reproductive and fertility data (study No. AB09779) reported in rabbits dosed with aTIV including 
MF59 compared to saline control did not reveal relevant product related concerns. Although the aQIV 
product was not tested it is not expected that one additional antigen may result in different safety 
profile. The vaccine evaluated with aTIV vaccine in rabbits was well-tolerated, did not cause maternal 
or embryofoetal toxicity, was not teratogenic, and had no effects on post-natal development. 
Local Tolerance  
The local tolerance effects of the product was assessed in rabbits in repeated dose toxicity studies. No 
significant local tolerance effects were reported, and the findings reported are consistent with the 
nature of the product. Reported inflammatory changes were partially or fully reversible. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Delayed contact hypersensitivity potential was assessed in guinea pigs (study No. 564110). The results 
are suggestive that the product assessed aTIV is not considered a dermal sensitizer (Guinea pig). 
Adjuvant 
A comprehensive package of GLP toxicology studies has been submitted in order to characterize the 
potential for local and systemic toxicity of MF59.  
In non-clinical studies, MF59 has not been associated with systemic toxicity, and it has a low level of 
local reactogenicity. In repeat dose rabbit studies, clinical pathology findings of increased fibrinogen 
and minor inflammatory and degenerative changes at injection sites are consistent with the effects of 
intramuscular injections of an immunological adjuvant. These findings are reversible within days to 1 
to 2 weeks. In repeat dose toxicology studies in dogs, there were no effects on cardiovascular or 
central nervous system (safety pharmacology) parameters. 
MF59 is not genotoxic (Ames test) or clastogenic (mouse micronucleus), is not a dermal sensitizer 
(Guinea pig), and was not teratogenic (rat and rabbit) or a developmental toxicant (rat).  
MF59 is not a new adjuvant, and ample experience exists in relation to human use when combined 
with influenza antigen made using the current manufacturing process. MF59 has been used in 
marketed vaccines for more than 20 years, and MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccines have been 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 30/194 
 
 
 
approved for the age indication proposed in this submission. No clinical safety issues requiring 
nonclinical investigation have been identified. The safety profile of MF59- adjuvanted influenza 
vaccines has been well established (Black, 2015, Schultze et al., 2008). 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No concerns are expected for the environment as a result of the product administration to humans. 
Proteins from the influenza virus naturally circulate in the environment, and the strains used in the 
vaccine formulation are naturally occurring viruses. Protein vaccines are normally exempted from the 
requirement to conduct environmental risk assessment studies as specified in the relevant guideline. 
Consequently, the lack of ERA studies is acceptable. 
Not applicable to vaccines according to the guideline Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use (CPMP/SWP/4447/00). 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The primary pharmacodynamics of aQIV have been investigated adequately. Studies on secondary 
pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology and pharmacodynamics drug interactions have not been 
performed and are considered not necessary in accordance with the Guideline on Influenza Vaccines 
(EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014). 
Pharmacokinetics studies have not been performed with aQIV and are considered not necessary in 
accordance with the Guideline on Influenza Vaccines (EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014). 
The toxicology of aQIV has been investigated adequately, including the adjuvant MF59. No effects were 
observed other than local findings and enlargement of lymph nodes as can be expected after 
intramuscular injection of a vaccine. 
The present application has the non-clinical and clinical support of other vaccines, namely aTIV, that 
have the same manufacturing process and adjuvant. Data derived from aTIV are considered directly 
relevant to aQIV because although aQIV contains additional antigen, the same active substance is used 
in both vaccines, both vaccines contain the same amount of MF59, and the manufacturing process is 
similar. The addition of an additional antigen has not resulted in a significant change in the 
pharmacology or toxicology of the product. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers the vaccine is considered approvable from a non-clinical perspective.

Planned Studies 
V118_24, a clinical disease endpoint trial in subjects 65 years of age and older with Fluad Quadrivalent 
(this is the tradename of Fluad Tetra in the US). This study is planned to be completed in March 31, 
2024. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies were not conducted in the development program of aQIV and aTIV, in line 
with current guidelines. Pharmacokinetic studies are not required for influenza vaccines as the kinetics 
properties of vaccines do not provide useful information for establishing adequate dosing 
recommendations.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Fluad Tetra provides active immunisation against four influenza virus strains (two A subtypes and two 
B types) contained in the vaccine. Fluad Tetra induces humoral antibodies against the 
haemagglutinins. These antibodies neutralise influenza viruses. 
The pharmacodynamic profile of vaccines is defined by their immunogenicity profile, as detailed in the 
CHMP guideline “Guideline on Clinical Evaluation of New Vaccines” (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005).  
Specific levels of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers post-vaccination with inactivated 
influenza vaccine have not been correlated with protection from influenza virus, but the HI antibody 
titers have been used as a measure of vaccine efficacy. Antibody against one influenza virus type or 
subtype confers limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibody to one antigenic 
variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or 
subtype. As indicated in this guideline the pharmacodynamic profile for vaccines is defined by its 
immunogenicity profile. These data are discussed in the “Clinical Efficacy” section. 
Fluad Tetra contains the adjuvant MF59C.1 (MF59), which is designed to increase and broaden the 
antigen-specific immune response and to extend the duration of the immune response. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology  
The current formulation of aQIV, presented as a thimerosal-free, sterile suspension for injection, in 
prefilled syringes consists of 2 admixed components: inactivated antigens and MF59 in a citrate buffer. 
aQIV is a quadrivalent seasonal surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted influenza vaccine prepared 
from virus propagated in the allantoic cavity of embryonated hens’ eggs. aQIV contains influenza virus 
surface antigens (hemagglutinin [HA] and neuraminidase) of each of the 4 influenza virus strains 
(A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Yamagata, B/Victoria) that are recommended by the World Health Organization 
(WHO) for use in the vaccination campaigns in advance of the respective northern and southern 
hemisphere seasons. aQIV has the same antigen content as aTIV, with an additional influenza B strain 
from the alternate lineage as the one contained in the licensed aTIV. The manufacturing process and 
formulation of aQIV and Fluad (aTIV) are the same, with the exception of an additional B strain 
included in aQIV. Therefore, clinical study experience with aTIV provides relevant and valuable data for 
assessment of the overall immunogenicity and safety of aQIV. 
The MF59 component of aQIV is an oil-in-water emulsion composed of squalene stabilized by a water-
soluble surfactant (polysorbate 80, also known as Tween 80) and an oil-soluble surfactant (sorbitan 
trioleate, also known as Span 85), in a low ionic strength buffer. The MF59 adjuvant was developed in 
the 1980s and clinical studies using pandemic influenza antigens and seasonal influenza antigens 
demonstrate that MF59 adjuvanted vaccine increases the humoral response to a diverse set of 
influenza strains (Del Giudice et al. 2006; Ansaldi et al. 2008; Galli et al. 2009; Ansaldi 2010). The 
antigen dose and vaccination schedule were based on approved trivalent or quadrivalent inactivated 
influenza vaccines at the time of conduct of the clinical development program, i.e. the aTIV/aQIV 
formulations used contained either 7.5 or 15 µg of hemagglutinin (HA) of each viral strain per 0.25 or 
0.5 mL dose, respectively. The formulation of the final product is in compliance with the European 
Pharmacopoeia (monograph 0869). Throughout this application, the terms aTIV and aQIV refer to the 
formulation of MF59-adjuvanted TIV and MF59-adjuvanted QIV, as described here. 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 37/194 
 
 
 
The use of the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay as the primary assay to assess vaccine 
immunogenicity in clinical trials is in line with the recommendations of the Guideline on Influenza 
Vaccines (EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014). While HI titers are not a true surrogate marker, it has been 
widely shown that higher HI titers tend to correlate with better protection. The CHMP guideline on 
influenza vaccines also recommends measuring the immunogenicity of the vaccine in terms of Cell 
Mediated Immunity (CMI), Microneutralization (MN) and Anti-Neuraminidase (anti-NA) assays in a 
subset of individuals. These assessments were performed on at least one study. The MN, anti-NA and 
CMI assays were performed by the same laboratory, which avoids inter-laboratory bias that could 
result if different testing laboratories had been used. For pivotal trial V118_05 and the revaccination 
studies V118_05E1 and V118_05E3 all HI testing was performed at the same laboratory whereas for 
other supportive studies with aTIV and the dose-finding study (V104P2) the HI tests were performed at 
different laboratory. Although this aspect does not question the validity of the results for these trials, it 
should be taken into account when comparing HI results from these different studies. The validation 
report provided in relation to the HI test performed by the lab was included in the dossier and 
concluded that the test was satisfactorily validated. Moreover, validation reports for microneutralisation 
assay to detect functional antibodies that prevent infection of cells in tissue culture; and enzyme-linked 
lectin assay (ELLA) to measure Neuraminidase antibody titers, were submitted. Assay validation 
reports of the HI assay used for the pivotal aQIV study V118_20 and the key supportive aTIV study 
V70_27 (elderly indication) were also provided and concluded that the test was validated. 
Comparing HI titers in terms of GMTs is considered adequate. Similarly, the definition of 
seroconversion rate defined as, the percentage of subjects achieving either: 1) a prevaccination 
(baseline) HI titer <1:10 and postvaccination HI titer ≥1:40 after vaccination; or 2) a prevaccination 
(baseline) HI titer ≥1:10 and a ≥4-fold increase in postvaccination HI titer) is also considered 
appropriate. 
The former criteria recommended by CHMP to assess immunogenicity of influenza vaccines (CHMP 
guidance for licensure of seasonal influenza vaccines, 1997) and the current criteria recommended by 
CBER (2007) for paediatric population have been used for some of the trials included in this Marketing 
Authorisation Application (MAA). It is considered that the data on fulfilment of these two criteria (CBER 
and CHMP) are deemed informative, but not critical for the immunogenicity assessment of the vaccine, 
since the CBER criteria are not a requirement for approval in the EU, and that the CHMP criteria are 
(since a few years ago) no longer required for approval of influenza vaccines (see current CHMP 
guideline: The Guideline on Influenza Vaccines - Non-clinical and Clinical Module 
(EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014). Moreover, it should be noted that there have never been CHMP 
criteria for subjects younger than 18 years of age. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP considers that all aspects dealing with clinical pharmacology have been well addressed by 
the Applicant. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.5.1.  Dose response study  
Paediatric indication development 
The only dose-finding study was the trial V104P2. 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 38/194 
 
 
 
Study V104P2 was a randomized, observer-blind, dose-ranging, multicentre, incomplete factorial design 
study in unprimed healthy children from 6 months to less than 3 years of age. The study was designed 
to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of different combinations of two different doses 
of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, different doses of MF59 and /or a second influenza B strain. 
There were 410 subjects randomised in 17 study groups. This was an explorative study. The results of 
this study are suggestive of the following: 
• 
• 
• 
The addition of adjuvant resulted in a clear increase in GMTs and further small increases in GMT 
with increasing MF59 dose. Although pairwise comparisons between antibody responses induced 
by  half  the  MF59  adjuvant  and  antigen of  the  adult adjuvanted  vaccine  and  lower  MF59  dose 
levels (¼ and ⅛) did not reach statistical significance, point estimates were generally in favour 
of the ½ dose level, especially against the B strain, the proposed dose for children 6-36 months. 
The presence of adjuvant (any level) improves the response to heterologous strains for influenza 
A/H1N1, H3N2 and influenza B after two vaccinations. This observation regarding the ”paediatric” 
formulation of Fluad (7.5μg TIV+½MF59) is particularly relevant considering the prevalence of 
“drifted” or mismatched B strain disease in young children. 
The reactogenicity data provides no suggestion that reactogenicity might increase with adjuvant 
or  antigen  dose.  Similarly,  there  is  no  apparent  pattern  of  increased  rates  of  unsolicited  AEs, 
including  possibly  related  AEs  with  increasing  adjuvant  content  or  increase  antigen  dose. 
However numbers are very low and differences in patterns of adverse events are unlikely to be 
detected in this study. 
The WHO currently recommends that vaccine-naive children from 6 months through 9 years of age 
should receive 2 vaccine doses separated by ≥4 weeks (World Health Organization 2012). Additionally, 
at the time of study conduct, the available influenza vaccines were recommended at a dose of 0.25 mL 
in children <3 years and at a dose of 0.5 mL in children ≥3 years of age. At this moment, most 
influenza vaccines indicated in this age group leave the decision to prescribers to give a 0.25 mL or a 
0.5 mL dose. 
Subjects in the pivotal aQIV study V118_05 were vaccinated according to the dosing and vaccination 
schedule in Table 6. 
In the context of this MAA, the following definitions apply: 
•  Vaccine non-naïve (previously vaccinated) subjects were defined as those subjects that 
received 2 or more doses of seasonal influenza vaccine since July 1, 2010. 
•  Vaccine naïve (not previously vaccinated) subjects were defined as subjects that had not 
received 2 or more doses of seasonal influenza vaccine since July 1, 2010 or who did not know 
their influenza vaccination history.

Elderly indication development 
In two dose finding studies (V104P3 and V7P38) in elderly, different dosages of antigen and adjuvant 
were evaluated. Study V104P3 tested different dose levels of MF59 adjuvant (none, ¼, ½, full) and two 
different  levels  of  A/H3N2  antigen  (15μg  vs  30μg). Study  V7P38 tested  different dose levels of  MF59 
adjuvant  (none,  ½,  full)  and  two  different  levels  of  antigen  (7.5μg  vs  15μg).  There  were  numerous 
immunogenicity  objectives  related  to  identifying  the  optimal  adjuvant-antigen  dose  combination  in 
comparison with the marketed formulation (Fluad, 15μg TIV + MF59).  
In  both  studies,  the  addition  of  the  adjuvant  led  to  an  increase  in  immune  response,  but  also  to  an 
increase of reactogenicity. In study V7P38, seroconversion rates were highest in the aTIV (100% MF59, 
15µg HA/strain) group, Fluad. Study V104P3 showed a similar picture, however the group receiving a 
higher  amount  of  A/H3N2  antigen  had  a  higher  response  to  A/H3N2  and  for  this  strain  there  was  no 
difference  between  the  50%  adjuvant  and  100%  adjuvant  group.  Immunogenicity  was  also  to  be 
evaluated  against  heterologous  influenza  strains.  The  addendum  presenting  results  for  heterologous 
strains was not included in the current submission.  
The addition of the adjuvant resulted in a higher reactogenicity, with the highest rate of pain reported 
for  the  groups  who  received  the  highest  level  of  adjuvant.  As  most  adverse  events  were  mild  or 
moderate, the benefit of the increased immune response weighs out against the risk of the increased 
reactogenicity. Therefore these studies support the current proposed dose of antigen and adjuvant.

Treatments 
Three vaccines were used in the trial. The candidate vaccine was: 
1)  aQIV: A 0.5 mL dose of aQIV (MF59C.1 adjuvanted influenza vaccine) administered to subjects 
≥36 months (or 0.25 mL for subjects <36 months), containing nominally 15 μg (or 7.5 μg for 
subjects <36 months) of HA of each of the 2 influenza type A strains and each of the 2 influenza 
type B strains for a total of 60 μg (or 30 μg for subjects <36 months) of HA in the vaccine. The 
strain  composition  was  that  recommended  by  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  for  QIV 
contemporaneous to the timing of the study. The NH formulations of the vaccines used in the 
study (Season 1: 2013/2014; Season 2: 2014/2015) contained A/California/7/2009 pdm09-like 
virus  (H1N1),  A/Texas/50/2012  (H3N2),  B/Massachusetts/2/2012  (B/Yamagata)  and 
B/Brisbane/60/2008  (B/Victoria).  The  vaccine  strain  composition  was  unchanged  between 
Seasons 1 and 2. The 0.25 mL vaccine formulation consists of 50% of all vaccine components of 
the 0.5 mL vaccine formulation. 
The two non-adjuvanted comparator vaccines used were:  
2)  Fluzone  (TIV):  A  0.5  mL  (or  0.25  mL  for  subjects  <36  months)  dose  of  Fluzone  containing 
nominally 15 μg (or 7.5 μg) of HA of each of the 2 influenza A strains and of one influenza B 
strain for a total of 45 μg (or 22.5 μg) of HA in the vaccine. 
3)  Fluzone (QIV): A 0.5 mL (or 0.25 mL for subjects <36 months) dose of QIV Fluzone containing 
approximately 15 μg (or 7.5 μg) of HA of each of the 2 influenza type A strains and each of the 
2 influenza type B strains for a total of 60 μg (or 30 μg) of HA in the vaccine. 
NH formulations of the vaccines were used in the study. A/California/7/2009 pdm09-like virus 
(H1N1), A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2) and B/Massachusetts/2/2012 (B/Yamagata) were included in 
the  comparator  vaccine  used  in  Season  1.  A/California/7/2009  pdm09-like  virus  (H1N1), 
A/Texas/50/2012  (H3N2),  B/Massachusetts/2/2012  (B/Yamagata)  and  B/Brisbane/60/2008 
(B/Victoria) were included in the comparator vaccine in Season 2. 
Based on previous influenza vaccination history (vaccine status), subjects received either 1 (vaccine on 
Day 1 for vaccine non-naïve subjects) or 2 doses (vaccine on Days 1 and 29 for vaccine naïve subjects) 
of either aQIV or non-adjuvanted comparator (Fluzone TIV in the first influenza season, and Fluzone QIV 
in the second season).  
Study V118_05 was conducted over 2 consecutive influenza seasons using the NH vaccine formulations 
(Season  1:  2013/2014;  Season  2:  2014/2015).  For  Season  1,  aQIV  was  compared  to  TIV-1,  and  for 
Season 2, QIV-1 was used as a comparator.  
Objectives 
The primary and secondary relative efficacy objectives were measured in all subjects in relation to cases 
occurring at ≥21 days and ≤180 days after the last vaccination (unless specified otherwise) or until the 
end of the influenza season whichever was longer. In all cases, efficacy  was determined on influenza 
cases caused by any of the influenza strains related to the 2 A subtypes and the B lineage(s) common 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020

to adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine (aQIV) and trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) (i.e., A/H1N1, 
A/H3N2  and  B/Yamagata  during  the  first  influenza  season),  and  common  to  aQIV  and  quadrivalent 
influenza vaccine (QIV) (i.e., A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and both B lineages during the second season and through 
to the end of the study). Data from all seasons were combined. 
The Primary Efficacy Objective was to demonstrate the relative efficacy of aQIV compared to non-
adjuvanted  comparator  as  determined  by  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  first-occurrence  reverse 
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed influenza A and/or B of any influenza strain 
in subjects ≥6 to <72 months of age. 
The following secondary objectives were evaluated in all subjects and in the following age groups: ≥6 
to <24 months of age, ≥6 to <36 months of age and ≥36 to <72 months of age. 
• 
• 
To evaluate the relative efficacy of aQIV compared to non-adjuvanted comparator as determined by 
the  proportion  of  subjects  with  first-occurrence  RT-PCR-confirmed  influenza  A  and/or  B  of  any 
influenza strain. 
To evaluate the relative efficacy of aQIV compared to non-adjuvanted comparator as determined by 
the  proportion  of  subjects  with  first-occurrence  influenza  caused  by  culture-confirmed  strains  A 
and/or B regardless of antigenic match to those contained in the vaccines, antigenically matched to 
those contained in the vaccines and antigenically unmatched to those contained in the vaccines. 
The  following  secondary  objectives  on  first-occurrence  RT-PCR  and  first-occurrence  culture-confirmed 
influenza as described above were evaluated in subjects ≥6 to <72 months of age: 
• 
• 
To evaluate the relative efficacy of aQIV compared to non-adjuvanted comparator in subjects at high 
risk of influenza complications. 
To evaluate the relative efficacy of aQIV compared to non-adjuvanted comparator in (vaccine) naïve 
subjects and non-naïve subjects separately. 
The following secondary objectives were intended to evaluate early efficacy: 
• 
To evaluate the relative efficacy of aQIV compared to non-adjuvanted comparator as determined by 
the  proportion  of  subjects  with  first-occurrence  RT-PCR-confirmed  influenza  A  and/or  B  of  any 
influenza  strain  in  subjects  ≥6  to  <72  months  of  age  at  ≥7  days  and  at  ≥14  days  after  the  first 
vaccination up to the day of the second vaccination in vaccine naïve subjects only; occurring at ≥7 
days  and  ≤21  days  after the last  vaccination,  in  all  subjects;  occurring  at  ≥7  days  to  ≤180 days 
after  the  last  vaccination  or  until  the  end  of  the  influenza  season,  whichever  was  longer  in  all 
subjects. 
The  relevant  immunogenicity  objectives  combine  data  from  both  Season  1  and  Season  2  for  the 
overall age group of 6 to <72 months. As the vaccine composition remained unchanged this is possible. 
For strain comparisons in the combined seasons, B/Victoria results from Season 2 only were taken into 
account in view of the lack of this strain from the comparator vaccine in Season 1. In addition, subgroup 
analysis by season, by age group (≥6 to <24 months of age, ≥6 to <36 months of age, ≥36 to <72 
months of age) and by season and age group are presented. The main immunogenicity objective was to 
evaluate the HI response according to the CBER criteria defined for children. Therefore the focus is on 
the additional immunogenicity objectives, which were: 
• 
To demonstrate non-inferiority and superiority of HI antibody responses to aQIV vs. TIV/QIV against 
each of the 3 strains contained in TIV (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B/Yamagata) and against each of the 4 
strains  as  contained  in  QIV  (A/H1N1,  A/H3N2,  B/Yamagata  and  B  Victoria)  in  terms  of  ratio  of 
geometric mean titre (GMT) and differences in the proportion of subjects with seroconversion (SC) 
21 days after the last vaccination in subjects ≥6 to <72 months of age.  
Assessment report

• 
• 
To compare the antibody response 180 days after the last vaccination to aQIV and TIV/QIV to each 
of the 3 strains contained in TIV (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B/Yamagata) and against each of the 4 strains 
as contained in QIV (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Yamagata and B Victoria), in terms of ratio of GMTs and 
% of subjects who achieve a HI titre of ≥1:40, in subjects ≥6 to <72 months of age. 
To compare the HI antibody response to aQIV and TIV/QIV of healthy subjects vs. subjects at high 
risk 3 weeks after the last vaccination in subjects ≥6 to <72 months of age. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint: The primary measure of efficacy was the estimate of rVE of aQIV relative 
to  non-adjuvanted  comparator  for  preventing  first-occurrence  RT-PCR-confirmed  influenza  disease 
caused  by  influenza  strains  related  to  those  contained  in  aQIV  and  non-adjuvanted  comparator  in 
children ≥6 to <72 months of age, for ILI cases occurring at ≥21 days and ≤ 180 days after the last 
vaccination or until the end of the influenza season, whichever was longer. 
For  the  efficacy  objectives,  the  subject  had  to  fulfil  the  case  definition  of  influenza  disease.  Active 
surveillance for ILI for each subject was conducted via telephone contacts, emails and/or text messages 
weekly from Day 1 up to 180 days after the last vaccination or until the end of the influenza season, 
whichever was longer.  
The  protocol-defined  criteria  for  Influenza  like  illnesses  (ILI)  were  in  accordance  to  the  CDC  criteria 
modified for young children: body temperature of ≥100.0°F / ≥37.8°C along with any of the following: 
cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, or runny nose. 
Subjects  who  met  the  protocol  definition  for  ILI  had  an  unscheduled  clinic  visit  in  order  to  have  a 
nasopharyngeal (NP) swab collected for evaluation of the presence of influenza virus. The NP swabs were 
targeted for collection within 3 days of onset of ILI to ensure optimal viral yield, however samples were 
accepted if collected up to 6 days following ILI-onset day. Clinical specimens were analysed by RT-PCR. 
All samples were also cultured for the growth of the clinical strain of influenza obtained from the subjects, 
allowing for antigenic characterization (to determine whether the clinical isolate is antigenically matched 
or antigenically unmatched to the vaccine strain). All samples were also cultured for the growth of the 
clinical  strain  of  influenza  obtained  from  the  subjects,  including  evaluating  antigenic  characterization. 
Antigenically matched and unmatched strains were those with a <8 and ≥8-fold difference in titre as 
compared to the vaccine strain, respectively. 
Samples that were culture-positive, were set for viral expansion. In case the HA titre of the expanded 
sample was ≥1:8, the expanded sample was shipped to the laboratory for subsequent antigenic typing 
by means of HI assays. If the viral expansion resulted in HA titre <1:8, a swab aliquot was shipped to 
another laboratory. Following the culture of the virus at this laboratory, antigenic typing was performed 
by means of MN assay for influenza A and by HI assay for influenza B. 
The  analysis  of  VE  against  A/H3N2  influenza  antigenically  matched  to  vaccine  strains  combined  the 
results of the samples tested at both laboratories, one using the HI assay and the other the MN assay. 
There was no A/H3N2 sample which was tested in both laboratories at this stage. After unblinding, the 
results from the 2 labs resulted to be totally opposite: according to the lab using the HI assay, 7.5% of 
the cases were unmatched, whereas 98.5% were unmatched when tested at the lab using the MN assay. 
Apparently, the reason for this discrepant result was due to the HA antigen used to generate the ferret 
antiserum  used  in  the  assays.  This  HA  antigen  used  by  the  two  laboratories  had  differences  in  their 
amino acid sequence being the one used by the lab using the HI assay more similar to a cell-based virus 
whereas the one used by the lab using the MN assay being the egg based virus. Thus, all the samples 
tested initially at the lab using the HI assay were retested at the lab using the MN assay, and then 87.5% 
Assessment report

of  them  were  found  to  be  unmatched.  This  result  was  in  agreement  with  epidemiological  data  of  H3 
viruses  isolated  during  that  season.  The  Company  then  concluded  that  considering  the  antigenic 
difference between the cell-derived A/H3N2 strain, used in the lab using the HI assay to generate the 
ferret antiserum, and the egg-derived vaccine strain, the results obtained by the lab using the MN assay 
are  the  one  that  more  accurately  reflect  antigenic  matching  of  the  influenza  cases  detected  in  study 
V118_05. These are the results described in the application.  
The applicant did not retest A/H1N1, B/Yamagata and B/Victoria strains at the lab using the MN assay 
for the following reasons: 
•  WHO recommendations to use MN assay for antigenic characterisation were limited to A/H3N2 strains 
only; 
• 
• 
• 
The majority of circulating A/H1N1 and B clinical isolates have sufficient hemagglutination titre and 
could therefore be tested using HI assay; 
There was no egg-adaptation for A/H1N1 and B strains described during the NH 2014/15 season that 
would lead to modification of antigenicity; 
The results of antigenic characterisation for circulating A/H1N1 and B strains were consistent with 
available epidemiological data (Appiah 2015; Hammond 2015). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints:  
The  RT-PCR  case  definition  and  culture-confirmed  case  definition  was  used  for  secondary  efficacy 
objectives. Endpoints evaluated in all subjects in the age groups ≥6 to <72 months of age, ≥6 to <24 
months of age, ≥6 to <36 months of age and ≥36 to <72 months of age were: 
• 
on  first-occurrence  of  RT-PCR-confirmed  influenza  cases  on  first-occurrence  of  RT-PCR-confirmed 
influenza cases ≥7 days after the last vaccination up to ≤ 180 days after the last vaccination or until 
the end of the influenza season, whichever was longer in all subjects. 
Immunogenicity endpoints 
Relevant endpoints for immunogenicity measured in aQIV and non-adjuvanted comparator as 
determined by HI included:  
•  GMTs in vaccine naïve and non-naïve subjects on the different time points (D1, D22/50, D181) and 
GMRs (after vaccination/before vaccination) of HI in these populations. 
•  Ratio of HI GMT of aQIV vs comparator in vaccine naïve and non-naïve subjects at different 
timepoints. 
•  Seroconversion rates at different time points (D1, D22/50, and D181) in vaccine naïve and non-
naïve subjects and in those who received aQIV vs TIV/QIV. 
•  Differences of HI antibody response to aQIV and comparator vaccines in healthy subjects vs 
subjects with high risk 3 weeks after the last vaccination. 
Endpoints were assessed for homologous strains in PPS Immunogenicity and FAS Immunogenicity and 
for non-matching (heterologous) strains in FAS Immunogenicity Heterologous. In addition, 
immunogenicity results for two homologous strains measured by microneutralisation (MN) assay were 
reported for a subset of 600 subjects.  
Sample size 
Assuming a relative vaccine efficacy of 36% and an event rate (ER) of influenza of 2.50% in the non-
adjuvanted comparator arm (Fluzone TIV in a first influenza season and Fluzone QIV in a second 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 45/194 
 
 
 
season and possible subsequent seasons) and therefore 1.62% in the aQIV arm, the sample size of 
approximately 8,124 evaluable subjects aged ≥6 months to<72 months of age for the aQIV arm and 
8,124 for the non-adjuvanted comparator arm and with that a number of 323 influenza events predicts 
ca. 97.5% power for the adjusted 2.02% level one-sided log-rank test for equality of survival curves to 
detect the difference between the two groups. 
Assuming a drop-out rate of 15% percent, approximately 9,558 subjects should be enrolled for each 
vaccine group (aQIV and non-adjuvanted comparator). 
Randomisation 
Enrolled subjects were randomly assigned to one of 2 study groups (aQIV or non-adjuvanted comparator) 
in a prespecified ratio of 1:1 with stratification factors as study site, age group (≥6 to <36 months of 
age/ ≥36 to <72 months of age, ratio 1:1), vaccine status (naïve/ non-naïve) and for presence of high 
risk medical condition (at risk/not at risk). All subjects enrolled in the first season were enrolled into the 
immunogenicity  subset.  In  the  second  season,  of  the  first  approximately  4,000  enrolled  subjects,  a 
subset of 1,424, healthy subjects and 356 subjects at high risk were randomized into the immunogenicity 
subset at a 1:1 ratio to aQIV or non-adjuvanted comparator respectively with the stratification factors 
country, age group (≥6 to <36 months of age/ ≥36 to <72 months of age, ratio 1:1) and vaccine status 
(naïve/ non- naïve).  
Blinding (masking) 
The trial was designed as an observer-blind study. Neither the subject nor any of the investigator staff 
who were involved in the treatments or clinical evaluation of the subject was aware of the vaccine 
administered. Only the designated nurse or physician who is responsible for administering the study 
vaccines was unblinded. 
Investigators,  sponsor  study  team,  all  laboratory  personnel  involved  in  processing  samples  and 
performing immunogenicity or swab sample assays and others who were involved in the conduct of the 
study or in the analysis of the final study results, or who had contact with study sites, were to remain 
blinded to the treatment codes and interim analysis results (if applicable) until all monitoring decisions 
had been made by the DMC and the database had been locked for final analysis.

FAS Early Efficacy: All subjects in the Enrolled Set who actually received a study vaccination and were 
evaluated for efficacy at least 7 days after the last vaccination. 
- Exploratory Efficacy and Immunogenicity Objectives 
FAS  Immunogenicity  Microneutralization  (MN):  All  subjects  in  the  Enrolled  Set  who  received  a  study 
vaccination AND provided evaluable serum samples for MN analysis for both before (baseline) and after 
vaccination. 
Exploratory efficacy or immunogenicity objectives were only evaluated for the FAS (FAS Efficacy / FAS 
Immunogenicity MN). 
- Modified Full Analysis Set (MFAS) Efficacy 
All subjects in the FAS Efficacy who received exclusively study vaccination. Subjects who received an 
additional non-study influenza vaccine prior to 180 days after last study vaccination or the end of the 
influenza season, whichever was longer, were excluded from this analysis set. 
The  MFAS  is  provided  for  sensitivity  analyses  to  provide  evidence  of  the  robustness  of  the  primary 
analysis. 
- Per Protocol Set (PPS) Efficacy/Immunogenicity 
The PPS included all subjects or data points of subjects in the FAS Efficacy/Immunogenicity which were 
not excluded due to reasons defined prior to unblinding or analysis defined prior to unblinding or analysis. 
Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The HR and the related 95% confidence interval (CI), for onset of RT-PCR confirmed influenza was 
estimated by a Cox proportional hazards regression model with treatment effect as a fixed effect and 
the stratification factors (country, age cohort, vaccine status and presence of high risk medical 
condition) as well as Season considered as random effect. Instead of the stratification factor centre, 
the factor country was used in the model.  
The study is successful if the upper-limit (UL) of the two-sided 95% confidence interval of the hazard 
ratio is lower than 1, or equivalently if the lower-limit (LL) of the two-sided 95% confidence interval of 
the relative vaccine efficacy, rVE, is above 0. 
The Efficacy FAS population will be used for the primary efficacy analysis. 
Secondary Immunogenicity Analyses 
For each strain and time point, the logarithmically (base 10) transformed titre values were analysed 
using an analysis of covariance with the factors vaccination group, age, naivety, health status, season 
and with covariable the logarithmically transformed baseline.

The applicant considered missing immunogenicity values as MCAR’s.  
Multiplicity 
No a-priori confirmation strategy or multiplicity correction was defined. This means that, except for the 
primary analyses, all other analyses, including subgroup analyses, will be considered explorative. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Overall,  10,644  subjects  ≥6  to  <72  months  of  age  were  enrolled/randomized  to  receive  aQIV  or 
comparator  vaccine  (Fluzone  TIV  in  Season  1  and  Fluzone  QIV  in  Season  2)  in  a  1:1  ratio.  Of  these, 
5,352 subjects were enrolled in the aQIV group and 5,292 subjects in the comparator vaccine group. Of 
these, 10,612 were vaccinated, 5,338 (99.5%) subjects in the aQIV group and 5,274 (99.5%) subjects 
in the comparator vaccine.

Of the 10,644 enrolled subjects, 9,113 (85.6%) subjects completed the study. A total of 4,568 (85.4%) 
to 4,545 (85.9%) of subjects across vaccine groups completed the study with the same proportion of 
early terminations between the 2 vaccine groups. The reasons for termination were similar between the

vaccine groups. Across both vaccine groups, the most common reasons for early terminations were lost 
to  follow-up  (486  [4.6%]  subjects)  and  enrollment  in  the  V118_05E1  study  (461  [4.3%]  subjects). 
V118_05E1 was the revaccination study in which some of the subjects enrolled in Season 1 of the current 
V118_05 study could be enrolled to receive another vaccination in the next influenza season.  
A similar analyses was performed according to stratification by age (aged ≥6 to <36 months and ≥36 
to  <72  months)  or  by  season.  In  both  cases,  no  significant  asymmetry  was  observed  for  the  several 
parameters analysed.  
Exclusions from Efficacy Population 
There  were  no  notable  differences  in  the  proportion  of  subjects  excluded  from  the  PPS  Efficacy  Set 
between the aQIV and comparator vaccine groups. 
Overall, 1,247 subjects (11.7%) in the All Enrolled Set were excluded from the PPS Efficacy population. 
The proportion of subjects excluded from the PPS Efficacy population was similar between the vaccine 
groups (11.1% in aQIV and 12.3% in comparator vaccine groups). The main reasons for exclusion were 
second vaccination performed out of window (4.5%) and second vaccination not done (3.0%). 
Recruitment 
A total of 1,486 subjects were enrolled in Season 1 and 9,158 in Season 2. Subjects were enrolled in the 
following countries in Season 1: Canada (N=90 [6.2%]), Finland (N=150 [10.3%]) and United States of 
America  (N=1216  [83.5%]).  Subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  following  countries  in  Season  2:  Canada 
(N=90  [1.0%]  subjects),  Finland  (N=492  [5.5%]  subjects),  Italy  (N=206  [2.3%]  subjects),  The 
Philippines  (N=2270  [25.2%]  subjects),  Poland  (N=440  [4.9%]  subjects),  Spain  (N=49  [0.5%] 
subjects), Taiwan (N=280 [3.1%] subjects), Thailand (N=2028 [22.5%] subjects), and United States of 
America (N=3160 [35.1%] subjects). 
Subjects were enrolled in Season 1 from November 2013- January 2014 and in Season 2 from September 
2014 -January 2015 (NH countries: Season 2a) and January- March 2015 (Tropical countries: Thailand 
and Philippines: Season 2b). Active surveillance for ILI was conducted from Day 1 to 180 days after last 
vaccination or the end the influenza season, whichever is longer. The end of June (NH countries) or end 
of October (Thailand and Philippines) was defined as the end of influenza season. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
There  were  5  amendments  to  the  original  protocol (dated  28  March  2013).  No  subjects  were  treated 
under the original protocol and Protocol Amendment 1. At the time of first subject first visit (FSFV), 03 
Nov 2013, Protocol Amendment 2 (Protocol Version 3.0) was in place. There were no key non-editorial 
changes from Protocol Amendment 3 (dated 06 Jun 2014) and Protocol Amendment 5 (dated 28 Sep 
2015).  
Out-of-Specification and Use of Commercial Vaccine in Season 1 
During the conduct of Season 1, the 5-month stability test on the supplied aQIV batch demonstrated 
that the HA content measured by single radial immunodiffusion (SRID) assay for aQIV was below the 
specification of 27 μg HA/mL for 3 out of 4 of the influenza strains included in the vaccine. Both influenza 
B strains and A/H1N1 were below the specification. The A/H3N2 HA content was well within specification. 
As a result of the out-of-specification observation, enrollment was stopped on 29 Jan 2014. In addition, 
it was decided to hold administration of the second vaccine dose intended for naïve subjects. At the time 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020

of the Sponsor’s decision to stop enrollment, 1486 children ≥6 to <72 months of age had been enrolled 
with 1481 subjects exposed to at least one study vaccination. 
The majority (N=88%) of vaccine naïve subjects received a second dose of study vaccine in Season 1. 
From the 124 vaccine naïve subjects not receiving a second vaccination, 65 subjects did not receive a 
second  vaccination  because  of  the  out-of-specification  and  59  subjects  did  not  receive  a  second 
vaccination because of another reason. In view of the time required to obtain the reconsent of the parents 
after  the  hold,  there  was  a  delay  in  the  administration  of  second  vaccinations  in  149  vaccine  naïve 
subjects (range Day 37-91, median Day 43). The last study vaccinations in Season 1 were administered 
on March 5, 2014. Subjects vaccinated out of window were included in the FAS but excluded from PPS 
Efficacy and immunogenicity analyses. 
Since a decrease in HA content would potentially reduce the immunogenicity of the vaccine, inclusion of 
these  results  in  the overall  analysis  would tend  to  bias  towards  a  conservative  estimation of  immune 
response or efficacy for aQIV as compared to the nonadjuvanted influenza vaccine. Moreover, in view of 
the relatively small portion of subjects enrolled during Season 1, i.e., approximately 14% of the overall 
number of enrolled subjects in the study, the potential impact on the overall efficacy data was estimated 
to be minimal.  
Baseline data 
Summary  of  the  demographic  and  other  baseline  characteristics  for  the  All  Enrolled  Set  overall  is 
presented in  
Table 7. 
The total enrolled population comprised of predominately Asian (44.2%) and White (39.9%) subjects. 
In relation to age baseline, 47.3% in the ≥6 to <36 months age group, 52.7% in the ≥36 to <72 months 
age group, 25.2% of the subjects were in the ≥6 to <24 months age group and 74.8% in ≥24 to <72 
months  age  group.  Overall,  the  proportion  of  males  and  females  was  similar  (50.8%  vs.  49.2%, 
respectively).  There  were  more  vaccine-naïve  than  vaccine  non-naïve  subjects  enrolled  in  the  study 
(67.7%  vs.  32.3%,  respectively).  There  were  more  subjects  enrolled  in  Season  2  than  in  Season  1 
(86.0%  vs.  14.0%,  respectively).  The  majority  of  subjects  were  healthy  (91.3%)  and  8.7%  of  the 
subjects were considered to be at high risk of influenza complications. Protocol criteria for inclusion were 
met for 98.8% of subjects. Subjects in the aQIV and comparator vaccine groups were well balanced with 
respect to mean age, as well as with respect to vaccine naivety status, race, sex, ethnic origin and risk 
factor.

Outcomes  
Analysis of Efficacy  
For any subject who had multiple confirmed influenza infections, only the first occurrence confirmation 
was counted under ANY strain. However, for all confirmed influenza infections, the first-occurrence for 
each strain was counted separately under each respective individual confirmed strain.

There were 5 subjects who had a culture-confirmed influenza although the original swab material tested 
RT-PCR negative for the influenza strain. All 5 swabs were collected via the NP route within a few days 
from ILI-onset. All were first-occurrence cases.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis 
A total of 508 first-occurrence influenza cases were confirmed by RT-PCR (256 (4.9%) in the aQIV arm 
and 252 (4.9%) in the comparator arm).  
The criterion for demonstrating a difference in rVE between aQIV and the comparator vaccine group was 
not met in subjects ≥6 to <72 months of age in the FAS, since the pre-specified statistical criterion (LL 
of  the  2-sided  95%  CI  for  the  rVE  >0%)  of  the  rVE  estimate  was  <0  (rVE  -0.67  [95%  CI:  -19.81; 
15.41]). 
Similarly, the criterion for demonstrating a difference in rVE between aQIV group and the comparator 
vaccine group was not met in subjects ≥6 to <72 months of age in the PPS (rVE -0.02 [95% CI: -20.07; 
16.68]). The PPS data confirmed FAS output and robustness of data.

Relative Vaccine Efficacy: RT-PCR-Confirmed Influenza by Strain  
A total of 24 A/H1N1, 396 A/H3N2, 72 B/Yamagata and 23 B/Victoria first-occurrence influenza cases 
were confirmed by RT-PCR. aQIV had better rVE than comparator vaccine against the RT-PCR-confirmed 
A/H1N1 strain; rVE 59.39 (95% CI: 2.06; 83.16). No difference in rVE between aQIV and comparator 
was demonstrated for the RT-PCR-confirmed A/H3N2 and B strains in subjects ≥6 to <72 months of age.

efficacy 
Relative Vaccine Efficacy: Culture-Confirmed Influenza 
A total of 286 subjects experienced at least 1 case of first-occurrence influenza which was confirmed by 
culture.  No  difference  in  rVE  between  aQIV  and  comparator  was  demonstrated  for  any  strain  or  the 
matched and unmatched culture-confirmed A and B strains in subjects ≥6 to <72 months of age. 
Post-hoc analysis of Relative Vaccine Efficacy: Culture-Confirmed Influenza 
Study V118_05 had the majority of cases in the 2014-15 season, which was known to be a mismatched 
season for A/H3N2 (i.e., the strain that was circulating in the season was antigenically distinct from the 
vaccine  strain).  Upon  evaluation  of  the  data,  there  appeared  to  be  a  discrepancy  between  the 
percentages  of  antigenically  matched  cases  for  the  A/H3N2  strain  in  this  study  versus  the  influenza 
epidemiology from the season in which the majority of cases were obtained. 
As  described  in  detail  above,  firstly,  samples  were  antigenically  typed  by  a  laboratory  using  a 
hemagglutination  inhibition  (HI)  assay  and  if  no  result  could  be  obtained  the  samples  were  typed  by 
another  lab  using  a  microneutralization  (MN)  ViroSpot.  According  to  the  lab  using  the  HI  assay,  a 
significantly greater fraction of cases reported to be matched compared to the seasonal epidemiology 
results. Samples initially tested by the lab using the HI assay were therefore retested by the other lab 
using the same MN ViroSpot assay. The results of this additional analysis is shown in the next Table. The 
values in italics indicate new data from the post-hoc analysis, including supplemental typing results for 
A/H3N2 vaccine strain.

Table 11: Number of subjects with cultured-confirmed influenza (overall, antigenically 
matched and unmatched strains) and relative vaccine efficacy (95% CI) in subjects ≥6 to 
<72 months of age for all seasons – FAS efficacy 
From this post hoc analysis it can be seen that: 
• 
The vast majority of A/H3N2 influenza cases after re-analysis were determined to be unmatched to 
the  vaccine  strain;  4  cases  in  aQIV  and  6  cases  in  comparator  group  were  reported  as  matched 
A/H3N2 cases in the supplemental analysis. 
•  Upon the supplemental A/H3N2 antigenic typing, the number of matched cases decreased and the 
number of unmatched cases increased. The decrease in the number of matched cases resulted in 
wider 95% confidence intervals for the vaccine group comparisons. 
• 
The  conclusions  from  the  original data  (CSR  dated 22  June  2017)  with  regards  to  rVE  for  culture 
confirmed matched and unmatched strains remain unaltered, i.e., there was no difference in relative 
efficacy  between  aQIV  and  comparator  vaccine  for  culture-confirmed  matched  or  unmatched 
influenza strains in subjects ≥6 to <72 months of age.

As  discussed  earlier,  the  data  in  the  Table  above  are  the  ones  that  reflect  the  real  situation  of  trial 
V118_05  since  it  was  found  that  the  laboratory  using  the  HI  assay  used  an  inadequate  reagent  for 
antigenically characterizing the H3N2 influenza cases. 
Relative Vaccine Efficacy by Age. 
RT-PCR-Confirmed Influenza by Age.  
The rVE was 4.03 (95% CI: -24.02; 25.74) for ≥6 to <36 months age group, -4.88 (95% CI: - 32.94; 
17.26) for ≥36 to <72 months age group and -14.99 (95% CI: -40.93; 6.18) for ≥24 to <72 months 
age group. 
However, in the ≥6 to <24 months age group, the LL of the 2-sided 95% CI was >0 and rVE estimate 
for any RT-PCR-confirmed strain was 31.37 (95% CI: 3.14; 51.38). No statistically significant difference 
in vaccine efficacy was observed in >24 to <72 months. 
The relative vaccine efficacy by age subgroup (≥6 to <12 months, ≥12 to <24 months, and ≥24 to 
<36 months) is presented in the table below. The rVE of aQIV is similar in subjects 6 to <12 months 
and ≥12 to <24 months of age were 35.73% and 28.83%, respectively). None of these rVE estimates 
were statistically significant.  
Table 12: relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) against any PCR-confirmed influenza of aQIV vs the 
comparator vaccine, by age category – FAS Efficacy  
The estimated adjusted rVE against any PCR-confirmed influenza and influenza attack rates in each study 
group for vaccine-naïve and non-vaccine-naïve subjects ≥6 to <24 months and ≥24 to <72 months of 
age is presented below (see Table 14).  
The majority of subjects (1,130 of 1,299; 87%) in age group ≥6 to <24 months were vaccine-naïve. 
The rVE in the vaccine naïve subjects ≥6 to <24 months was 34.08% (95% CI: 5.28, 54.12). The rVE 
of vaccine non-naïve children in this age group was -0.88% (95% CI: -212.80, 67.46). 
There  was  no  difference  in  rVE  of  aQIV  in  vaccine-naïve  and  vaccine  non-naïve  subjects  ≥24  to  <72 
months (-15.19% and -15.03%, respectively). The ≥24 to <72 months age subgroup included a lower 
proportion of vaccine naïve subjects relative to the younger age subgroup (61% vaccine naïve and 39% 
vaccine  non-naïve).  Additionally,  with  an  influenza  annual  attack  rate  of  10%  to  30%  in  children  <6 
years (Bodewes 2011; Jayasundara 2014) it is expected that a substantial proportion of subjects in this 
age group will be serologically non-naïve, regardless of influenza vaccination history.

Culture-Confirmed Influenza by Age 
No significant differences were observed in any of the age groups including 6 to 24 when the data from 
cell-culture confirmed cases were analyzed.  
Relative Vaccine Efficacy by Prior Vaccination Status and by season 
No statistically significant results were obtained in these subgroups when the rVE was calculated using 
either RT-PCR or cell culture confirmed influenza cases. 
Relative vaccine efficacy by sex 
As shown in Table below, rVE of aQIV compared with comparator vaccine, was greater in males than 
females. The rVE estimates were statistically superior in both cases since excluded zero. However, the 
immunogenicity data do not show a similar pattern, since similar GMT titers were reached in males and 
females within each of the two arms.

Early Efficacy 
The vaccine efficacy was  additionally evaluated before the start of the efficacy period for the primary 
objective (≥21 days to <180 days after last vaccination). In vaccine naïve subjects, the efficacy of the 
first vaccine was evaluated ≥7 and ≥14 days after first vaccination until second vaccination. 
The rVE was 54.66 (95% CI: 18.08; 74.91) and 70.56 (35.19; 86.62) for ≥7 and ≥14 days after first 
and up to second vaccination, respectively in vaccine naïve subjects (Table 16) indicating higher early 
efficacy of the aQIV than the comparator vaccine. In all subjects (pooled naïve and non-naïve), the rVE 
was 3.70 (95% CI: -14.29; 18.85) ≥7 days and ≤180 days after last vaccination or until end of season, 
whichever was longer.

in the ≥24 to <72 months age groups against any strain of RT-PCR-confirmed influenza in vaccine naïve

(95% CI) at 21 Days after last vaccination in subjects ≥6 to <72 months of age – all 
seasons – FAS immunogenicity 
The percentage of subjects with HI titer of ≥1:110, ≥1:151, ≥1:215, ≥1:330 and ≥1:629 was higher in 
aQIV  group  than  in  the  comparator  vaccine  group  for  all  homologous  strains  in  subjects  ≥6  to  <72 
months of age at 21 days after the last vaccination. 
The percentage difference (aQIV - comparator) in subjects achieving an HI titer of 1:629 against the 
homologous A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 strains were 24.1% and 21.1%, respectively, for V118_05. The same 
trends in differences in percentages of subjects reaching the specified threshold titers were observed for 
the B vaccine strains  
In  both  Study  V118_05  these  differences  in  proportion  of  subjects  reaching  threshold  titers  between 
aQIV and comparator started around HI titers of ≥1:215 in the A strains, but at lower HI titers of ≥1:40 
or ≥1:110 in the B strain(s). 
Immune Response by Vaccine Naivety Status 
Overall, in all comparisons the aQIV group had higher GMT values, SCRs, and percentages of subjects 
with  HI  titer  ≥1:40  than  the  comparator  group  after  the  first  (non-naïve)  and  second  vaccinations 
(naïve).  After  the  first  vaccination  the  GMT  titers  for  vaccine  naïve  subjects  were  lower  than  those 
obtained in non-naïve vaccine subjects.  
Dose Group  
In Study V118_05, subjects received a dose of 0.25 mL if they were aged 6 to <36 months at study Day 
1, or 0.50 mL if they were aged 36 to <72 months at study Day 1.

As indicated in Table 21 aQIV elicited a superior immunogenic response based on the lower limit of the 
95% CI of the GMT ratio [GMTaQIV/GMTcomparator]) above 1 for all homologous strains tested relative 
to the comparator vaccine for the pre-specified groups of 0.25 mL dose and 0.5 mL dose. Higher GMT 
ratios were observed in subjects from the 0.25 mL dose group.

vaccine strains (superiority) at 21 days after last vaccination in subjects by dose group

Heterologous Immune Response 
Heterologous A/H1N1 immune responses postvaccination were close to baseline for both vaccines. 
The GMTs at 21 days after last vaccination are reported for heterologous strains in  
Table 22, for the FAS. 
The baseline GMTs for all heterologous strains were comparable for aQIV and comparator vaccine groups 
in subjects ≥6 to <72 months of age. The GMTs for heterologous A/H3N2 and the B heterologous strains 
were higher in aQIV group than in the comparator vaccine group at 21 days after the last vaccination. 
The LL of the 2-sided 95% CI of the GMTr was >1.5 for heterologous A/H3N2 and the B heterologous 
strains.

Correlate of Protection 
A  correlate  of  protection  (CoP)  analysis  was  performed  to  estimate  the  relationship  between  post 
vaccination HI titers and protection from influenza disease.  
The  numbers  of  reported  influenza  cases  due  to  A/H1N1,  B/Yamagata,  and  B/Victoria  strains  in  the 
immunogenicity subset were low and insufficient for the analysis. The CoP analysis was therefore limited 
to the A/H3N2 strain. The majority of A/H3N2 influenza cases were reported during Season 2 and were 
assessed to be mismatched to the vaccine strain.  
An observed CoP HI titer for homologous A/H3N2 of 1,041.1 (95% CI: 705.42; 1,536.46) was associated 
with 50% protection against RT-PCR confirmed A/H3N2 infection, i.e., including the infections resulting 
from the A/H3N2 drifted strains. This observed CoP was significantly higher than previously reported in 
the  literature  for  studies  performed  in  A/H3N2  matched  seasons,  which  suggest  that  the  protection 
threshold may vary from year to year and may depend on the level of similarity between the vaccine 
strain and circulating strains. 
Immune Responses Measured by Microneutralization 
From  the  Immunogenicity  subset,  an  additional  subset  (600  subjects)  was  randomly  selected  after 
enrollment was completed.

The  antibody  response  (GMT,  geometric  mean  ratio  [GMR],  and  GMTr)  against  the  most  prevalent 
influenza strains (A/H3N2 and B/Yamagata) during the study period was assessed by an MN assay as an 
exploratory analysis. 
The GMTs and GMRs at 21 days and 180 days after last vaccination in subjects ≥6 to <72 months of age 
are reported in the Table below for the FAS MN Immunogenicity. 
Table 22: Geometric Mean MN Titers, Geometric Mean Ratios, GMT Ratios and GMT Ratios 
(95% CI) Against A/H3N2 and B/Yamagata Vaccine strains at Day 22/50 and Day 181/209 
in subjects ≥6 to <72 months of age – FAS MN Immunogenicity
As can be seen in the Table GMTs were consistently higher at Day 22/50 in the aQIV group than in the 
comparator  for  both  strains  tested  and  enhanced  persistence  of  immune  response  with  aQIV  was 
observed  in  that  Day  181/209  GMTs  were  consistently  higher in  aQIV  for  both  strains  tested.  At  Day 
22/50, the GMTr was >2-fold with a lower limit (LL) of the 95% CI above 1.5 for both strains. 
Other  analyses  performed  comparing  seroprotection  and  seroconversion  rates,  as  well  as  subgroup 
analyses age group and vaccination status, generally showed that aQIV was  more immunogenic than 
the comparator vaccine 
Ancillary analyses 
Persistence of Immune Response against Homologous Strains 
The greater immunogenicity of aQIV relative to the comparator vaccine in subjects 6 to <72 months of 
age was evident at 180 days after the last vaccination in Study V118_05. Persistent immune response

6 months after vaccination was also observed in the two revaccinations studies (see data below), and 
supported by the findings in the aTIV studies (CSR V70_29 and CSR V70P2). Persistence of the greater 
antibody response up to 12 months after vaccination was evident from the baseline titers obtained in 
both revaccination studies one season following priming in V118_05.  
In V118_05E1 (revaccination after Season 1 of V118_05), the vaccine strains were identical to those 
received  during  priming  in  Study  V118_05.  Results  show  the  greater  baseline  titers  for  aQIV  (versus 
QIV-1)  in  the  revaccination  study  V118_05E1  for  both  A  strains  and  B/Yamagata.  Comparisons  of 
B/Victoria are not presented as this strain was not included during priming with the comparator vaccine 
(TIV-1) during Season 1 in V118_05.  
In  V118_05E3  (revaccination  after  Season  2  of  V118_05),  baseline  titers  were  combined  for  the 
treatment groups (aQIV/aQIV and aQIV/QIV-1 as well as for QIV-1/aQIV and QIV 1/QIV 1) and presented 
for the A/H1N1 and B/Victoria strains that were the same as used during priming in V118_05 one year 
earlier. 
In all cases, the lower limit of the 95% CI of the GMT ratio of aQIV versus comparator for the HI titers 
at least 6 months following vaccination is equal or above 1.3 (Table 24).

Immune Response upon Revaccination  
Study V118_05 was conducted over two seasons. After Season 1, subjects from a selected group of sites 
were  invited  to  enroll  in  revaccination  study  V118_05E1.  Similarly,  after  Season  2,  subjects  from  a 
selected group of sites were invited to enroll in revaccination study V118_05E3. 
Study V118_05E1 was a revaccination study, wherein subjects were vaccinated approximately 9 to 12 
months  after  the  initial  vaccinations  in  the  parent  study  V118_05  and  the  randomization  was  carried 
over from V118_05: subjects received the same influenza vaccine and the same strains as administered 
in  the  pivotal  study,  i.e.,  aQIV  or  licensed  non-adjuvanted  comparator  influenza  vaccine.  However, 
subjects assigned to the licensed comparator group received the trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV 1) in 
clinical study V118_05 and were therefore not previously exposed to B/Victoria (B/Brisbane/60/2008) 
strain. 
Study V118_05E3 was a revaccination study in which subjects were re-randomized to receive the same 
or different quadrivalent vaccine type (adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted) from what they had received in 
Study  V118_05,  which  resulted  in  4  treatment  groups  (aQIV/aQIV;  aQIV/QIV-1;  QIV-1/aQIV;  QIV-
1/QIV-1). Vaccine strains for A/H1N1 and for B/Victoria where the same as those included in the V118_05 
study,  while  the  A/H3N2  and  B/Yamagata  strains  were  updated  in  accordance  with  the  latest  WHO 
recommendations. 
Study populations in the revaccination studies were, as expected due to the sequential nature, slightly 
older  compared  to  the  parent  study,  but  otherwise  largely  similar  for  gender  distribution  and  health 
status. Differences in race originated from difference in countries that were enrolling subjects.  
HI data  
An overview of the GMTs against the homologous strains at baseline and on Day 22 and Day 181 and 
vaccine  group  comparisons  by  means  of  GMT  ratios  on  Day  22  and  Day  181  were  provided  in  the 
application. The main results are summarized here: 
• 
Baseline GMTs were higher across all strains in subjects who received aQIV in the parent study when 
compared to subjects who received QIV-1 or TIV-1 in the parent study, reflecting higher persistence 
of immune response in the aQIV group. 
• 
For subjects who were primed with aQIV in Study V118_05, significantly higher immune response 
was  observed  for  3  out  of  4  strains  (A/H1N1  and  both  B  strains)  upon  revaccination  with  aQIV 
compared to QIV-1 (V118_05E3). 
• 
The  immune  responses  of  the  treatment  groups  with  different  vaccines  used  for  priming  and 
revaccination  (i.e.,  aQIV/QIV-1  and  QIV-1/aQIV)  were  intermediate  between  the  repeated 
adjuvanted and repeated non-adjuvanted groups, in general (V118_05E3). 
• 
After  repeat  vaccination  with  aQIV  in  V118_05E1  and  V118_05E3,  a  significantly  higher  immune 
response was observed when compared to subjects that received repeat non-adjuvanted vaccine 
for all strains, except for A/H3N2 on Day 22 in study V118_05E3.

Adjusted MN GMTs and GMRs on Day 22 and Day 181 were presented for the 4 homologous strains for 
the PPS.  
In general, MN GMTs were highest in aQIV/aQIV, results for aQIV/QIV and QIV/aQIV were similar and 
slightly lower, and MN GMTs were lowest for the QIV/QIV group. 
Antibody response against homologous strains by anti-NA assay 
The antibody response (anti-NA GMT, GMR, and GMTr) against the homologous strains contained in the 
study vaccine was additionally assessed by anti-NA assay, to further characterize the immune response 
in a subset of 240 subjects. 
• 
• 
For  all  strains  tested,  baseline  (Day  1)  anti-NA  GMTs  were  generally  higher  in  the  aQIV  primed 
group compared to the QIV-1 primed group in the parent study. 
Both on Day 22 and on Day 181, anti-NA GMTs were similar in the aQIV/aQIV, aQIV/QIV-1, and 
QIV-1/aQIV groups and were notably higher compared with the repeated nonadjuvanted group in 
all strains except for N2 antibodies, which showed no notable difference between treatment 
groups

results 
•Efficacy results: only the most relevant results are shown: 
•There was no difference in relative efficacy between aQIV and comparator 
vaccine for any culture-confirmed or matched or unmatched influenza strains 
in subjects ≥6 to <72 months of age. 
Secondary endpoint 
results 
• Greater vaccine efficacy was demonstrated in children ≥6 to <24 months; 
the rVE estimate for any strain detected by RT-PCR was 31.37 (95% CI: 3.14; 
51.38). 
•There was a benefit of aQIV relative to the comparator vaccine in preventing 
early  cases  of  influenza  shortly  after  vaccination.  rVE  was  54.66  (95%  CI: 
18.08; 74.91) and 70.56 (35.19; 86.62) ≥7 and ≥14 days after first and up 
to second vaccination, respectively in vaccine naïve subjects indicating higher 
early efficacy of aQIV than the comparator vaccine. 
Immunogenicity results: only the most relevant results are shown: 
• aQIV elicited a superior immunogenic response (as reflected by GMT ratio 
[GMTaQIV/GMTcomparator]),  having  a  lower  95%  CI  limit  >1  and  SC 
difference  with  a  lower  95%  CI  limit  >0  for  all  homologous  strains  tested 
relative to the comparator vaccine for all prespecified age groups. The LL of 
the 2-sided 95% CI of the GMTr exceeded 1.5 for all homologous strains. The 
highest  GMT  ratios  were  observed  in  subjects  aged  ≥6  to  <  24  months 
ranging from 2.58 (95% CI: 2.2; 3.0) for A/H3N2 to 3.84 (95% CI: 2.9; 5.0) 
for B/Victoria. 
2.5.3.  Supportive studies (paediatric indication) 
Supportive Studies with aTIV  
This section summarizes immunogenicity results individually from the 5 supportive studies that compare 
the  immunogenicity  of  aTIV  versus  TIV.  An  overview  of  these  studies  has  been  shown  in  the  table 
overview of clinical studies. 
Evaluation of Immune Response against Homologous Strains 
The summary provided here for each study is based on the primary analysis population pre-specified in 
the protocol and its accompanying SAP; this was typically the PPS unless specified otherwise.  
Overall, there was a consistent trend of greater immunogenicity in adjuvanted vaccine groups compared 
to non-adjuvanted vaccine groups across all 6 aQIV/aTIV clinical studies in terms of GMTs at Day 22/Day 
50 (approximately 3 weeks after last vaccination), GMRs, and SCRs against homologous strains (Table 
30).  In  pivotal  study  V118_05,  the  aQIV  group’s  GMTs,  GMRs,  and  SCRs  were  higher  than  for  the 
comparator  group  for  all  4  strains.  Similarly,  the  5  aTIV  studies  consistently  elicited  a  greater 
postvaccination immune response in terms of GMTs, GMRs, and SCRs than non-adjuvanted groups. The 
greater  immune  response  is  confirmed  by  the  higher  GMT  ratios  at  Day  22/Day  50  (approximately  3 
weeks after last vaccination) against homologous strains in adjuvanted vaccine groups compared to non-
adjuvanted vaccine groups across all 6 aQIV/aTIV studies, as indicated in Table 29.

Altogether, the supportive studies show that vaccination with aTIV produces a robust immune response 
which is higher compared to non-adjuvanted influenza vaccines. 
2.5.4.  Main studies (elderly indication) 
The clinical development program to support licensure of aQIV in individuals ≥65 years of age is based 
on the results of the pivotal aQIV immunogenicity and safety study V118_20. 
The data package also includes a key supportive aTIV study V70_27, 7 supportive aTIV studies, 7 aTIV 
revaccination studies, and 2 aTIV effectiveness studies. Additionally, the safety profile is supported by 
more than 20 years of aTIV postmarketing data. 
Moreover, data from study V118_18 was submitted during the evaluation.

Treatments 
There were three treatment groups: 
1)  aQIV group (candidate vaccine): A 0.5 mL dose of aQIV contains nominally 15 mcg of HA of 
each of the 2 influenza type A strains and each of the 2 influenza type B strains for a total of 60 
mcg of HA in the vaccine. The strains used in this study were compliant with recommendations 
by  the  World  Health  Organization  for  the  2017-2018  Northern  Hemisphere  influenza  season 
(WHO  2017)  for  quadrivalent  vaccines:  A/  Michigan/45/2015  (H1N1)-like  virus;  A/  Hong 
Kong/4801/2014  (H3N2)-like  virus;  B/  Phuket/3073/2013-like  virus  (Yamagata  lineage);  B/ 
Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (Victoria lineage). 
2)  aTIV-1  group:  A  0.5  mL  dose  of  aTIV-1  contains  nominally  15  mcg  of  HA  of  each  of  the  2 
influenza type A strains and the recommended influenza type B strain for a total of 45 mcg of 
HA in the vaccine. The strains used in this study were compliant with recommendations by the 
World  Health  Organization  for  the  2017-2018  Northern  Hemisphere  influenza  season  (WHO 
2017) for trivalent vaccines: A/ Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)-like virus; A/ Hong Kong/4801/2014 
(H3N2)-like virus; B/ Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (Victoria lineage). 
3)  aTIV-2  group:  A  0.5-mL  dose  of  aTIV-2  contains  nominally  15  mcg  of  HA  of  each  of  the  2 
influenza type A strains and 1 influenza type B s train for a total of 45 mcg of HA in the vaccine. 
The influenza A strains used in the study were compliant with recommendations by the World 
Health Organization for the 2017-2018 Northern Hemisphere influenza season (WHO 2017) for 
trivalent  vaccines.  The  influenza  B  strain  included  in  this  vaccine  was  the  second  influenza  B 
strain  recommended  for  inclusion  in  quadrivalent  vaccines  (i.e.,  the  alternate  B  strain):  A/ 
Michigan/45/2015  (H1N1)-like  virus;  A/  Hong  Kong/4801/2014  (H3N2)-like  virus;  B/ 
Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (Yamagata lineage). 
Objectives 
Study Objectives: 
Co-Primary Immunogenicity Objectives: 
1.  To demonstrate that vaccination with aQIV elicits an immune response that is not inferior to that 
of  an  aTIV  containing  the  same  virus  strains  as  the  licensed  adjuvanted  influenza  vaccine 
(FLUAD, aTIV-1), and an aTIV containing the alternate B strain (aTIV-2) among adults ≥65 years 
of age. 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 75/194 
 
 
 
2.  To assess the immunogenicity of aQIV in adults ≥65 years of age based on the CBER (Center for 
Biologics Evaluation and Research) recommendations. 
Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives: 
The secondary immunogenicity objectives of the study were to assess the following, among adults aged 
≥65 years: 
1.  To characterize the immunogenicity of aQIV, the aTIV-1 containing the same virus strains as the 
licensed adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine, and the aTIV-2 containing the alternate B strain, 
by hemagglutination inhibition (HI). 
2.  To demonstrate the immunological superiority of aQIV compared to aTIV-1 and aTIV-2 for the B 
strain that is not included in each TIV vaccine separately. 
Secondary Safety Objective: 
1.  To assess safety and tolerability of aQIV, aTIV-1, and aTIV-2 among adults >65 years of age. 
Exploratory Immunogenicity Objectives: 
1.  To  explore  the  association  between  HI  immune  response  after  administration  of  aQIV  or  the 
aTIV-1, containing the same virus strains as the licensed adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine, 
and the aTIV-2 containing the alternate B strain by baseline characteristics. 
2.  Characterization of the immunogenicity of aQIV using other immunological assays (e.g.,  virus 
neutralization [MN] or anti-neuraminidase antibody assays may be performed). 
Note:  Additional  immunogenicity  testing  (e.g.,  virus  neutralization  [microneutralization])  was  not 
performed as part of this study; therefore, exploratory immunogenicity objective #2 was not assessed. 
All study objectives were performed using homologous strains. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Co-Primary Immunogenicity Endpoints 
The  immunogenicity  of  study  vaccines  was  assessed  21  days  (i.e.,  on  Day  22)  after  vaccine 
administration  by  measuring  the  HI  antibody  titers  to  the  4  virus  homologous  strains  included  in  the 
investigational vaccine. 
The  noninferiority  of  aQIV  compared  to  aTIV-1  and  to  aTIV-2  was  assessed  for  the  8  co-primary 
endpoints of HI geometric mean titer (GMT) and seroconversion rate (SCR) for each virus strain included 
in the vaccines as follows: 
•  GMT ratio* for the A/H1N1 strain 
•  GMT ratio for the A/H3N2 strain 
•  GMT ratio for the B strain (Yamagata lineage) 
•  GMT ratio for the B strain (Victoria lineage) 
•  Difference between the SCR** for the A/H1N1 strain 
•  Difference between the SCR for the A/H3N2 strain 
•  Difference between the SCR for the B strain (Yamagata lineage) 
•  Difference between the SCR for the B strain (Victoria lineage) 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 76/194 
 
 
 
*The GMT ratio was defined as the geometric mean of the postvaccination (Day 22) HI titer for aTIV-1 
(or aTIV-2) over the geometric mean of postvaccination (Day 22) HI titer for aQIV. 
**The SCR was defined as the percentage of subjects with either a prevaccination HI titer <1:10 and a 
postvaccination  HI  titer  ≥1:40  or  a  prevaccination  HI  titer  ≥1:10  and  a  ≥4-fold  increase  in 
postvaccination HI titer. 
Immunogenicity  results  obtained  from  aTIV-1  and  aTIV-2  for  both  A/H1N1  and  A/H3N2  strains  were 
pooled for comparison with aQIV. 
The  second  co-primary  immunogenicity  objective  for  aQIV  was  assessed  21  days  after  vaccine 
administration by applying CBER criteria for the elderly population for each of the 4 strains included in 
aQIV: 
•  Percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion for HI antibody 
•  Percentage of subjects achieving an HI antibody titer ≥1:40 
Success Criteria for Co-Primary Objectives 
To Demonstrate Noninferiority 
aQIV  was  considered  to  be  noninferior  to  aTIV-1,  containing  the  same  virus  strains  as  the  licensed 
adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine, and aTIV-2, containing the alternate B strain if, for each of the 4 
strains, the following statistical criteria were met: 
•  The upper bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of the GMTs did not 
exceed 1.5. The GMT ratio was calculated as GMTaTIV/GMTaQIV. 
•  The upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference between the SCRs did not exceed 
10%. The difference in SCRs was calculated as SCRaTIV–SCRaQIV. 
To Demonstrate Sufficiency of the Immune Response According to CBER Criteria 
The sufficiency of immune response after aQIV was  assessed as measured by  percentage of subjects 
achieving seroconversion and HI titer ≥1:40 at Day 22 according to the criteria presented in the CBER 
Guidance for Licensure of Seasonal Inactivated Influenza Vaccines (CBER FDA 2007), namely: 
•  The  lower  bound  of  the  two-sided  95%  CI  for  the  percentage  of  subjects  achieving 
seroconversion for HI antibody should have met or exceeded 30%; 
•  The  lower  bound  of  the  two-sided  95%  CI  for  the  percentage  of  subjects  achieving  a 
postvaccination HI antibody titer ≥1:40 should have met or exceeded 60%. 
The  statistical  evaluation  consisted  of  the  observed  proportion  together  with  the  lower  bound  of  the 
corresponding two-sided 95% CI per strain. No adjustment for type I error for multiplicity was made. 
Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints 
Secondary immunogenicity endpoints included: 
For Secondary Objective 1, the measures of immunogenicity of aQIV, aTIV-1, and aTIV-2, as determined 
by the HI assay against homologous strains at Day 1 and 22 (unless indicated otherwise), included the 
following: 
•  GMT: Geometric mean of HI titers on Day 1 (prevaccination) and Day 22 (postvaccination); 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 77/194 
 
 
 
 
•  Geometric mean ratio (GMR*): the geometric mean of the fold increase of postvaccination HI 
titer over the prevaccination HI titer (Day 22/Day 1); 
•  The percentage of subjects with HI titer ≥1:40 at Day 1 and Day 22; 
•  SCR: the percentage of subjects with either a prevaccination HI titer <1:10 and a postvaccination 
HI titer ≥ 1:40 or a prevaccination titer ≥ 1:10 and a ≥4-fold increase in postvaccination titer 
on Day 22. 
*GMR was defined as the geometric mean of the fold increases of postvaccination antibody titer over the 
prevaccination antibody titer. 
For each treatment group and strain, summary tables were presented for GMT and 95% CIs, percentage 
of subjects with a titer ≥1:40 (number and percentage of subjects) at Day 1 and Day 22 SCR (number 
and percentage of subjects at Day 22) and GMR (mean and 95% CIs). 
For  Secondary  Objective  2,  the  immunologic  superiority  of  HI  antibody  responses  for  the  alternate  B 
strain (e.g., the influenza B strain included in the aQIV but not in the aTIV formulation) were assessed 
for each aTIV separately, using the endpoints of the ratio of HI GMT and the difference of SCR for each 
B virus strain 21 days after vaccination. 
•  For comparisons between aQIV and aTIV-1, the alternate B strain was B/Yamagata; 
•  For comparisons between aQIV and aTIV-2, the alternate B strain was B/Victoria. 
Success Criteria for Superiority Demonstration (Secondary Objective 2) 
Superiority was declared if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in seroconversion 
rates  (SCRaTIV–SCRaQIV)  was  <0,  and  the  upper  limit  of  the  two-sided  95%  CI  for  the  GMT  ratio 
(GMTaTIV/GMTaQIV) was <1 for both B strains. 
Exploratory Immunogenicity Endpoints 
Analyses of the exploratory immunogenicity endpoints for homologous strains (namely postvaccination 
GMTs and SCR) were performed with adjustment for covariates including prevaccination titer, vaccination 
history,  age,  and  gender  to  evaluate  the  contribution  of  these  factors  to  variations  in  the  immune 
response. The covariate adjustment was performed with all of the specified covariates in the GLM. 
No other exploratory analyses were performed. 
Sample size 
Approximately 1,778 were planned to be randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio (aQIV:aTIV-1:aTIV-2). This study 
was powered to achieve 80% power to demonstrate noninferiority over 8 co-primary endpoints, SCRs 
for 4 strains, and GMT for 4 strains using a 1-sided alpha of 0.025 for each comparison. No adjustment 
for multiple comparisons was made. 
For comparisons of SCR, a noninferiority margin of 10% (aTIV–aQIV) was employed. It was assumed 
that the SCRs for A-H1N1, A-H3N2, and B strains for TIV were 73%, 73%, and 40%, respectively. These 
estimates were based on the estimated SCR rates of historical data, namely study Protocol V70_27. It 
was assumed that there was no difference in terms of SCR between aQIV and aTIV for all strains. For 
comparison of the GMT ratio, a noninferiority of 1.5 (aTIV/aQIV) was employed. It was assumed that 
there was no difference between aQIV and aTIV (i.e., a ratio of 1) and that the standard deviation of log 
(titer) was 1.2. 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 78/194 
 
 
 
Under these assumptions, the number of subjects in the FAS Immunogenicity equalled 800 in the aQIV 
group and 400 subjects in each aTIV group, providing 800 subjects and 800 subjects receiving aQIV and 
aTIV, respectively, for comparisons of A strains, and 800 subjects and 400 subjects receiving aQIV and 
aTIV,  respectively,  for  comparisons  of  B  strains.  This  provided  a  total  FAS  Immunogenicity  of  1,600. 
These  numbers  provided  99.45%  power  to  detect  differences  in  SCR  for  each  A  strain  and  91.29  % 
power for each B strain, providing overall 82.42% power for the 4 SCR tests. 
For  GMT  ratio  tests,  each  A  strain  test  had  100%  power  and  each  B  strain  test  had  99.98%  power, 
providing 99.96% power for the 4 GMT ratio tests and, consequently, 82.39% power for the 8 co-primary 
endpoints. A total of N=1778 subjects were to be recruited considering a 10% drop-out rate and 1600 
subjects for FAS Immunogenicity requirement. 
Randomisation 
An Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system was used for subject randomization, which assigned 
a unique subject identification number. Subjects who provided informed consent and who met all criteria 
for enrollment were randomly assigned in a 2:1:1 ratio to receive aQIV, aTIV-1, or aTIV-2. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. There were no visible differences between the investigational aQIV vaccine 
and the 2 comparator aTIV vaccines. Vaccines were selected and administered according to the Pack ID 
assigned to the subjects by the IRT system. Neither the subject nor any of the investigative staff involved 
in administering the vaccines or clinical evaluation of the subject were aware of the vaccine administered. 
No unblinding occurred during the study. The Protocol had prespecified unblinding procedures for the 
handling  of  medical  emergency  or  accidental  unblinding.  The  unblinding  should  only  have  been 
performed  when  knowledge  of  the  assigned  treatment  would  have  affected  a  subject’s  management. 
Except in the case of medical necessity, a subject’s treatment should not have been unblinded without 
the approval of the Sponsor. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Sets 
There were 5 analysis sets defined for the study analyses. 
All Enrolled Set: The All Enrolled Set included all subjects who provided informed consent, received a 
subject  identification  number,  and  provided  demographic  and/or  baseline  screening  information, 
regardless of randomization and treatment status in the study. 
Exposed  Set:  The  Exposed  Set  included  all  subjects  in  the  All  Enrolled  Set  who  received  study 
vaccination. 
Full Analysis Set Immunogenicity: The Full Analysis Set (FAS) Immunogenicity included all subjects 
in  the  All  Enrolled  Set  who  were  randomized,  received  at  least  1  study  vaccination,  and  provided 
immunogenicity data at Day 1 and Day 22. 
In the case of a vaccination error, subjects in the FAS Immunogenicity were analyzed “as randomized” 
(i.e., according to the vaccine the subject was randomized to receive, which may have differed from the 
vaccine  the  subject  actually  received).  If  a  subject  was  unblinded  during  the  study,  that  subject  was 
included in the FAS Immunogenicity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 79/194 
 
 
 
Per Protocol Set Immunogenicity: The Per Protocol Set (PPS) Immunogenicity comprised all subjects 
in the FAS Immunogenicity who did not have any major PDs that were assessed as potentially impacting 
on immunogenicity results. Examples of subjects excluded from the PPS due to other reasons than major 
protocol deviations were: subjects who withdrew informed consent, subjects who had RT-PCR‒confirmed 
ILI  before  Day  22  (as  documented  by  the  central  laboratory),  and  unblinding  of  vaccine  assignment 
(except in the case of a SUSAR). 
Safety Set: The Safety Set included all subjects in the Exposed Set who received at least 1 dose or a 
partial dose of study vaccine and provided any evaluable follow-up safety data 
− Solicited Safety Set: All subjects in the Exposed Set with any solicited AE data. 
− Unsolicited Safety Set: All subjects in the Exposed Set with unsolicited AE data. 
− Overall Safety Set: All subjects who were in the solicited safety set or in the unsolicited safety set. 
In case of vaccination error, subjects were analyzed as “treated” (i.e., according to the vaccine a subject 
received rather than the vaccine to which the subject was randomized). 
If a subject received the correct study vaccine (dose, batch) from another ongoing study at the site, the 
subject’s safety data were included in the safety analysis. If a subject was unblinded during the study, 
he/she was included in all safety sets. 
Immunogenicity Data Analysis 
All statistical analyses for HI titers were performed on the logarithmically transformed (base 10) values. 
Individual HI titers below detection limit (<10) were set to half of that limit (5).  
Co-primary  immunogenicity  endpoints  of  GMT  and  SCR  for  each  virus  strain  contained  in  the  vaccine 
was assessed for subjects ≥65 years overall. For A-H1N1 and A-H3N2 strains, the two aTIV treatment 
groups were pooled. 
Primary  analysis  was  performed  for  subjects  ≥65  years  using  the  Per  Protocol  Set.  The  difference  in 
SCRs was presented with exact 95% (CIs). Miettinen and Nurminen method was used if convergence 
issues (Miettinen and Nurminen 1985). Each of the 4 strains was analyzed separately. 
To  determine  the  GMT  ratio  (adjusted  analysis),  a  general  linear  model  (GLM)  was  fitted  on  log 
transformed  (base  ten)  postvaccination  HI  titer  as  the  outcome  variable  and  terms  for  covariates: 
vaccine  treatment,  prevaccination  HI  titer,  age  stratum,  gender,  vaccination  history,  age-by  vaccine 
interaction  and  study  site.  Potential  covariate  interaction  effects  were  also  examined  in  the  fit  of  the 
GLM. From the model, an adjusted difference in least square means (on the log scale) was produced 
with 95% confidence limits. The estimated difference and the confidence limits were back transformed 
to  obtain  an  adjusted  GMT  ratio  with  95%  confidence  limits.  Each  of  the  4  strains  was  analyzed 
separately. The adjusted GMT ratio was the result for which the noninferiority assessment of the HI GMT 
co-primary endpoint was based on. 
Unadjusted  GMTs,  GMRs  and  pertaining  two-sided  95%  CIs  were  calculated  assuming  lognormal 
distribution  of  the  titers  and  were  completed  by  providing  minimum,  maximum  and  median  titers  for 
each vaccine group. 
Binary data (i.e., percentages of subjects with seroconversion and with titer ≥1:40) were summarized 
for  each  group  using  crude  estimates  and  reported  together  with  two-sided  exact  95%  CIs.  No 
multiplicity adjustment to the CI levels was implemented. 
Missing immunogenicity values were considered missing completely at random and, therefore, did not 
contain information that affected the result of the analysis (i.e., not informative). 
Therefore, imputation methods were not used.

The  PPS  was  used  for  the  primary/secondary  immunogenicity  noninferiority  analyses,  as  well  as 
supplementary  analyses,  and  FAS  was  used  for  secondary  superiority  analysis.  Duplicate  tables  of 
primary  and  secondary  immunogenicity  analyses  have  been  produced  based  on  the  FAS/PPS 
immunogenicity if there was >1% difference in the total number of subjects between the PPS and the 
FAS Immunogenicity. 
Subgroup Analysis 
Additional subgroup analyses were conducted for both safety and immunogenicity assessments, based 
on following subgroups: 
•  Age at enrollment (≥65 to 74, ≥75 to 84, and ≥85 years) 
•  Gender 
•  Race 
•  Previous influenza vaccination in the past 5 years (yes/no) 
•  Comorbidity/risk (yes/no, defined as assessment score <50 or ≥50 based on scale described in 
Section 5.1.2 of the Protocol (Appendix 16.1.1) 
Results 
Participant flow 
In total 1,778 subjects were enrolled and randomized into the study, with 1,776 (99.9%) subjects in the 
Exposed  Set  receiving  1  vaccination  of  aQIV,  aTIV-1,  or  aTIV-2.  The  total  number  of  subjects  who 
completed the full study was 1,760 (99.0%).

In  total,  1,778  subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  study.  Two  randomized  subjects  did  not  receive  study 
vaccination  and  were  excluded  from  the  Exposed  Set.  Overall,  1,776  subjects  received  the  study 
vaccination. Five subjects (1 subject from aQIV group, 1 subject from aTIV-1 group, and 3 subjects from 
aTIV-2  group)  were  early  terminated  prior  to  Day  22.  One  subject  from  aQIV  group  did  not  provide 
evaluable blood sample at Day 22. These 6 subjects were excluded from the FAS Immunogenicity. In 
total, 1770 subjects were included in the FAS. 
Overall, 29 subjects were excluded from the PPS (14 subjects in the aQIV group; 7 subjects in aTIV-1; 
and 8 subjects in aTIV-2). 
Overall, the main reasons for exclusion of subjects from the PPS were balanced between study groups. 
Recruitment 
Study V118_20 was conducted in the US during the 2017-2018 Northern Hemisphere influenza season 
and enrolled a total of 1,778 male and female subjects ≥65 years of age.  
Subjects were recruited before the start of the influenza season, in 2017, and had two stages of study 
participation: Treatment Period (Day 1 through Day 22) and Follow-up Period (Day 23 through Day 
181). Thus, subjects were followed-up during 6 months after vaccine administration. 
Conduct of the study 
There  were  no  amendments  made  to  the  protocol.  No  unblinding  occurred  during  the  study.  Overall, 
there were 88 (4.9%) subjects who had at least 1 major protocol deviation. The most common major 
protocol deviations were associated with missed study visits or visits outside of the protocol-specified 
time intervals (1.9%). 
Baseline data 
The median overall age of subjects was 71 years; the minimum age in each group was 65 years, and 
the maximum was 90 to 97 years. A majority of subjects (56.6%) were female vs. 43.4% male. 
The  enrolled  population  was  predominantly  white  race  (91.6%)  and  non-Hispanic  or  Latino  ethnicity 
(92.5%). Mean weights were 83.24 kg to 84.24 kg across study groups. The median BMI was high in all 
study groups, ranging from 28.62 to 28.96. Most subjects (86.7%) had previous influenza vaccination. 
Overall,  based  on  the  Risk  Scores,  the  enrolled  population  was  considered  to  be  low  risk  for 
hospitalization due to pneumonia or influenza and death from any cause; however, subjects ≥75 years 
of age tended to be higher risk for influenza-related hospitalizations and death from any cause. 
There  were  no  other  notable  differences  observed  in  the  baseline  characteristics  and  demographics 
across vaccine groups in the overall enrolled population. 
The  distribution  of  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  by  vaccine  groups  in  the  FAS  and  PPS 
analysis sets were generally similar compared with the Enrolled Set. Similar to the enrolled set, subjects 
in the FAS and PPS who were ≥75 years tended to be at higher risk for influenza-related hospitalization

Numbers analysed 
Overall,  1,778  subjects  were  enrolled  and  randomized  into  the  study,  with  1,776  (99.9%)  subjects 
receiving  study  vaccination  of  aQIV,  aTIV-1,  or  aTIV-2,  with  1,770  (99.6%)  subjects  included  in  the 
immunogenicity Full Analysis Set (FAS) and 1,741 (97.9%) subjects included in the immunogenicity Per 
Protocol Set (PPS). 
In the ≥65 to 74 year age cohort, 1,220 subjects were enrolled and randomized, with 1,218 (99.8%) 
subjects receiving 1 vaccination of aQIV, aTIV, or aTIV-2, and 1,213 (99.4%) subjects included in the 
immunogenicity FAS and 1198 (98.2%) subjects included in the immunogenicity PPS. 
In the ≥75 to 84 year age cohort, 499 subjects were enrolled and randomized, with 499 (100%) subjects 
receiving  1  vaccination  of  aQIV,  aTIV,  or  aTIV-2,  and  498  (99.8%)  subjects  included  in  the 
immunogenicity FAS and 484 (97.0%) subjects included in the immunogenicity PPS. 
In  the  ≥85  year  age  cohort,  59  subjects  were  enrolled  and  randomized,  with  59  (100%)  receiving  1 
vaccination of aQIV, aTIV, or aTIV-2, and 59 (100%) subjects included in both immunogenicity FAS and 
PPS. 
Outcomes 
Analysis of immunogenicity was performed on the PPS Immunogenicity (primary analysis) and on the 
FAS Immunogenicity, as more than 1% of the vaccinated subjects with postvaccination immunological 
results  were  eliminated  from  the  PPS  for  immunogenicity.  The  primary  analysis  of  immunological 
superiority  for  the  B  strains  (secondary  objective  2)  was  based  on  the  FAS  with  supportive  analysis 
performed on the PPS. 
Immunogenicity was assessed by the HI assay conducted on serum samples collected before vaccination 
on Day 1 and on Day 22 by titrating antibodies against homologous influenza strains. Homologous strains 
are antigenically similar to the strains in the vaccine. Testing of samples was performed with Day 1 and 
Day 22 sera tested in the same assay run.  
The  WHO  recommended  homologous  strains  used  in  the  assessment  of  antigenicity  were  A/ 
Singapore/GP1908/2015 
IVR-180  (H1N1)-like;  A/  Hong  Kong/4801/X-263B  (H3N2)-like,  B/ 
Brisbane/9/2014-like (Yamagata lineage) and B/ Brisbane/60/2008-like (Victoria lineage). 
Additional immunogenicity testing (e.g., MN) was not performed as part of this study. 
Testing  was  conducted  by  Seqirus-designated  qualified  laboratory  personnel  who  were  blinded  to  the 
treatment assignment and the visit. 
First Co-primary Immunogenicity Objective: Non-inferiority of aQIV vs. aTIV Comparators (aTIV-1 and 
aTIV-2) 
Geometric Mean Titer Ratios 
Table 31 presents the postvaccination HI antibody GMTs and analyses of noninferiority of aQIV relative 
to aTIV for each strain 22 days postvaccination in adults ≥65 years. 
The prespecified noninferiority criteria for the adjusted GMT ratio were met for all 4 homologous strains. 
The upper bounds of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the adjusted GMT ratios (aTIV/aQIV) did 
not exceed 1.5 (A-H1N1=1.27, A-H3N2=1.09, B-Yamagata=1.08 and B-Victoria=1.08).

Seroconversion Rate Difference 
The  SCR  was  defined  as  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  either  a  titer  of  <1:10  before  vaccination 
achieving a HI antibody titer of ≥1:40 after vaccination, or with a HI titer of ≥1:10 before vaccination 
achieving a 4-fold or greater increase in HI titer after vaccination. 
The table below presents seroconversion rates and analyses of noninferiority of aQIV relative to aTIVs 
for each strain 22 days postvaccination in adults ≥65 years in the PPS. 
The prespecified noninferiority criteria for the difference in the SCR between aTIV and aQIV were met 
for all 4 homologous strains. The upper bounds of the 95% CI of the intergroup difference for SCR (aTIV 
minus  aQIV)  did  not  exceed  the  noninferiority  margin  of  10%  for  all  4  strains  (A-H1N1=7.76,  A-
H3N2=4.96, B-Yamagata=3.27, and B-Victoria=2.55).

Second Co-Primary Immunogenicity Objective: Adequate Immunogenicity According to CBER Criteria 
The second co-primary objective was to demonstrate adequate immunogenicity based on CBER criteria 
as measured by the percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion for HI antibodies and percentage 
of subjects achieving an HI antibody titer ≥1:40. 
Success  criteria  was  met  if  the  lower  limit  of  the  two-sided  95%  CI  for  the  percentage  of  subjects 
achieving seroconversion for HI antibody met or exceeded 30% AND the lower limit of the two-sided 
95%  CI  for  the  percentage  of  subjects  achieving  an  HI  antibody  titer  ≥1:40  met  and  exceeded  60% 
(CBER  Guidance  Clinical  Data  Needed  to  Support  the  Licensure  of  Seasonal  Inactivated  Influenza 
Vaccines) (FDA 2007). 
Percentage of Subjects Achieving Seroconversion 
As  presented  in  Table  11  for  the  PPS,  the  lower  limit  of  the  two-sided  95%  CI  for  the  proportion  of 
subjects achieving seroconversion for HI antibody for A-H1NI and A-H3N2 strains were above 30%, but 
were below 30% for both B strains (B-Yamagata and B-Victoria). Therefore, the CBER success criteria 
for seroconversion were met for A strains, but not for B strains. Seroconversion rates for B strains in the 
aTIV-1 and aTIV-2 B groups were similar (lower limits of the 95% CI below 30%). 
Percentage of Subjects Achieving Hemagglutination Inhibition ≥1:40 
The lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the proportion of subjects achieving an HI antibody titer 
≥1:40  for  A-H1N1  and  A-H3N2  strains  were  above  60%,  but  were  below  60%  for  both  B  strains; 
therefore, the CBER success criteria for proportion of subjects with HI titer ≥1:40 were met for A strains, 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020

but not for B strains. The proportion of subjects with HI titer ≥1:40 against B strains in the aTIV-1 and 
aTIV-2 groups were similar (lower limits of the 95% CI below 60%). 
Table 32: Immunogenicity as Measured by Percentages of subjects with HI titer >1:40 and 
seroconversion rate to each homologous strain 22 days after vaccination (PPS) 
Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints 
The  secondary  immunogenicity  objective  was  to  demonstrate  the  immunological  superiority  of  aQIV 
compared to aTIV-1 and aTIV-2 for the B strain that was not included in each TIV vaccine, as measured 
by SCR difference and GMT ratio, and to further characterize the immunogenicity of study vaccines, as 
measured by HI assay. 
• 
Immunologic Superiority of aQIV Relative to aTIV for the Alternate B Strain 
Superiority of aQIV vs. aTIV-1 and aTIV-2 for the alternate B strain was assessed using the GMT ratio 
(GMTaTIV/GMTaQIV) and difference in SCR (SCRaTIV–SCRaQIV) at Day 22. 
Superiority was declared if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the GMT ratio (aTIV/aQIV) was 
<1, and the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in SCRs (aTIV–aQIV) was <0,  for 
both B strains. 
Based  on  the  FAS,  the  prespecified  criteria  for  immunological  superiority  for  the  alternate  B  strain  of 
aQIV (as measured by SCR difference and GMT ratio) relative to each aTIV vaccine were met. The results 
were similar in the PPS.

Table 33: Analyses of superiority of aQIV relative to aTIV for the Alternate B strain (FAS)
•  Geometric mean titer and geometric mean ratio 
The  PPS  baseline  GMTs  were  comparable  between  aQIV  and  aTIV  groups.  The  GMR 
(postvaccination/prevaccination) was also comparable in aQIV and aTIV groups for all strains: 3.36 aQIV 
vs. 3.29 pooled aTIV for A-H3N2 strain, and 2.99 aQIV vs. 3.40 pooled aTIV for A-H1N1 strain; 1.76 in 
aQIV vs. 1.68 in aTIV-1 for B-Victoria strain; and 2.03 in aQIV vs. 1.93 in aTIV-2 for B-Yamagata strain. 
The highest baseline GMTs were observed against the A-H3N2 strain (73.27 aQIV, 71.83 pooled aTIV) 
and A-H1N1 (19.07 aQIV, 18.77 pooled aTIV), followed by B-Victoria (14.15 aQIV, 15.18 in aTIV-1), and 
B-Yamagata (10.41 aQIV, 10.76 aTIV-2). 
Postvaccination GMT also tended to be higher for the A strains compared with the B strains. The results 
for the FAS were consistent with data obtained in the PPS. Baseline and postvaccination GMTs, as well 
as GMRs, were comparable across vaccine groups but tended to be higher for A strains compared with 
the B strains. 
•  Seroconversion rates for hemagglutination inhibition antibodies 
As presented in Table below, seroconversion rates were comparable between aQIV and aTIV groups. 
Seroconversion  rates  tended  to  be  higher  for  A-H3N2  (39.33  aQIV,  39.70  pooled  aTIV)  and  AH1N1 
strains (35.21 aQIV, 38.43 pooled aTIV), compared with B-Yamagata (16.40  aQIV, 15.47 in aTIV-2), 
and B-Victoria (13.42 aQIV, 12.16 aTIV-1).

Table 34: Seroconversion Rates of HI antibody titers by vaccine group – As Randomised (PPS) 
• 
Percentage of subjects with a hemagglutinin inhibition titer ≥1:40 at day 1 and day 22 
The proportions of subjects with HI titers ≥1:40 were comparable between vaccine groups for each of 
the 4 influenza strains at prevaccination and postvaccination. 
At Day 1 (prevaccination) in the PPS, the proportion of subjects with HI titers ≥1:40 tended to be higher 
in the A-H3N2 strain (70.64 aQIV and 70.66 pooled aTIV) and A-H1N1 (33.26 aQIV and 31.07 pooled 
aTIV) compared to B-Victoria (19.72 aQIV, 22.71 to aTIV-1) and B-Yamagata (11.12 aQIV, 11.55 aTIV-
2). Similarly at postvaccination, the proportion of subjects with HI titers ≥1:40 tended to be higher for 
the A strains compared with the B strains. 
The results of immunogenicity analysis based on the FAS were consistent with the PPS. 
•  Reverse cumulative curves of hemagglutinin inhibition antibodies 
The reverse cumulative distribution curves of Hemagglutinin Inhibition Antibodies by vaccine group and 
by strain at Day 22 for the PPS were provided within the application. There were no notable differences 
observed in the postvaccination HI titers across vaccine groups. Postvaccination HI titers tended to be 
higher for the A strains compared with the B strains. The same trend was also observed in the FAS. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses by age, gender, race, comorbidity, and vaccination history was conducted for each 
influenza vaccine strain for percentages of subjects with HI titer ≥1:40, GMTs, GMRs, and seroconversion 
rates. 
•  Age 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020

The total number of subjects included in the analysis was 1,198 subjects in age group ≥65 to 74 years 
(602 aQIV/596 pooled aTIV); 484 subjects in age group ≥75 to 84 years (239 aQIV/245 pooled aTIV), 
and 59 subjects in age group ≥85 years (31 aQIV/28 pooled aTIV). 
Within the aQIV group at postvaccination, there were no notable differences in the proportion of subjects 
with HI titer ≥1:40 against A-H1N1, A-H3N2, and B-Victoria strains in subgroup of subjects ≥65 to 74 
years,  ≥75  to  84  years,  and  ≥85  years.  The  proportion  of  subjects  with  HI  titer  ≥1:40  against  B-
Yamagata appeared to be reduced with age (Table 36). There were no notable differences observed in 
the proportion of subjects with HI ≥1:40 between aQIV and aTIV groups across subgroup of subjects of 
≥65 to 74 years, ≥75 to 84 years, and ≥85 years (Table 36). 
Regarding seroconversion rates, comparison of SCRs within each vaccine group across age subgroups 
tended to indicate a higher immune response in the ≥65 to 74 year vs. ≥75 to 84 and ≥85 year age 
subgroups. In general, the ≥85 years of age subgroup tended to have wider 95% CI across all influenza 
strains most likely due to small sample size. No substantial differences were observed for SCR between 
aTIV and aQIV across subgroup of subjects in the ≥65 to 74 years, ≥75 to 84 years, and ≥85 years. 
In the measurements of GMT and GMR, overall across aQIV and aTIV groups, there is a trend to reduction 
of GMR for all influenza strains with age, with a higher GMR observed in subjects ≥65 to 74 years. No 
substantial differences were observed for baseline and postvaccination GMTs and GMRs between aTIV 
and aQIV groups across subgroup of subjects in the ≥65 to 74 years, ≥75 to 84 years, and ≥85 years.

postvaccination by Age Subgroup (PPS) 
•  Gender 
Overall,  a  greater  number  of  female  subjects  (N=983)  were  enrolled  in  the  study  and  data  analyzed 
compared  to  male  subjects  (N=758).  At  day  22  postvaccination  the  percentage  of  individuals  who 
achieved  HI  titer  ≥1:40  were  similar  between  aQIV  and  aTIV  for  male  and  female  subgroups  for  all 
strains, with no substantial differences in response by gender. This was also true for the seroconversion 
rates and for GMTs and GMR.

•  Race 
The majority of subjects enrolled in the study were white (1,593) followed by black/African American 
(124) subjects. Other ethnicities within the race subgroup in the study were too small for meaningful 
comparisons. 
Overall, there are no significant differences in the responses obtained in the different races assessed in 
this study. 
•  Comorbidity/Risk Score 
Comorbidity risk scores were assessed among other baseline characteristics as a validated predictor of 
risk of influenza complications in subjects ≥65 years of age. A score of <50 was considered low risk and 
a  score  of  ≥50  was  considered  high  risk  for  hospitalization  due  to  pneumonia  or  influenza  and  death 
from any cause. At study entry, scores <50 and ≥50 were observed in the PPS for n=1,133 subjects and 
n=608 subjects, respectively. 
The proportion of subjects with HI titer ≥1:40 postvaccination was similar in both aQIV and aTIV groups 
regardless of comorbidity risk scores. 
Regarding seroconversion rates, GMT and GMR, no substantial difference was observed between aQIV 
and aTIV vaccines for all strains, but a trend to a lower response was observed in the high risk group for 
both vaccines. 
•  Vaccination history 
A significantly greater number of subjects reported having a vaccination history (1,512 subjects) vs. 229 
subjects reporting no vaccination history. 
Baseline and postvaccination proportion of subjects with HI titer ≥1:40 tended to be higher for A strains 
compared with the B strains in the subgroup of subjects with and without vaccination history. Subjects 
in both aQIV and aTIV vaccine groups had similar immune responses regardless of vaccination history. 
Overall, subjects without vaccination history within the last 5 years tended to have a higher GMR and 
SCR than subjects with a history of vaccination, however, the postvaccination HI titers are comparable 
in these subgroups for A-H1N1 and A-H3N2 strains.

Exclusion criteria 
Any suspected impairment of the immune system are excluded, besides the regular exclusion criteria, 
and history of Guillain-Barré syndrome. 
Treatments 
Subjects  were  to  receive  either  1 of  the  3 lots  of  aTIV  (lots 1,  2,  or  3) or  TIV  vaccine.  aTIV  and  TIV 
contained two A-strains (A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like strain and A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like strain) 
and one B-strain (B/Brisbane/60/2008-like strain).  
Objectives 
Primary objective 
To evaluate the superiority of aTIV compared to TIV with regards to at least 2 homologous strains and 
to  demonstrate  the  noninferiority  of  aTIV  compared  to  TIV  with  regards  to  all  homologous  strains  in 
adults ≥65 years of age as measured by GMT ratios and seroconversion rate differences at day 22. 
In addition there was a co-primary objective with regards to lot to lot consistency for three consecutive 
production  lots  of  aTIV  as  measured  by  HI  GMTs  at  day  22  for  each  virus  strain.  As  this  has  limited 
relevance to the current application, this objective is not further discussed in this overview.  
Main secondary objectives 
To evaluate the superiority of aTIV compared to TIV with regards to at least 2 heterologous strains and 
to demonstrate the noninferiority of aTIV compared  to TIV with regards to all heterologous strains in 
adults ≥65 years and in high-risk subjects with predefined comorbidities as measured by GMT ratios and 
seroconversion rate differences at day 22. 
To assess the difference between aTIV and TIV with regards to homologous and heterologous strains in 
subjects included in the antibody persistence group as measured by GMT ratios and seroconversion rate 
differences at day 181 and day 366. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The immunogenicity endpoints based on the HI titre were comparisons between pairs of aTIV lots and 
comparisons of the aTIV with the TIV vaccines for the variables shown below. Co-primary endpoints were 
evaluated at day 1 and day 22, and secondary endpoints were evaluated at day 1, day 22, day 181, and 
day 366. 
•  GMT, GMR of day X/day 1 HI titres (where day X is day 22, day 181, or day 366); 
•  Percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion; 
•  Percentage of subjects achieving HI titre ≥40. 
Seroconversion  was  defined  as  for  subjects  with  negative  pre-vaccination  HI  serum  titre  (<10)  a 
postvaccination titre ≥40 or, for subjects with a non negative prevaccination titre (≥10), at least a 4-fold 
increase in HI serum titre from baseline

Randomisation 
Subjects were randomised to receive either 1 of the 3 lots of aTIV (investigational vaccine; lots 1, 2, or 
3) or TIV vaccine (active control) with ratio 1:1:1:3 and were stratified into 2 age cohorts, 65 to 75 years 
and >75 years. According to the protocol the age groups should have been 65 to 74 years and ≥ 75 
years, which is different from the performed randomisation. 
Blinding (masking) 
The administration of the vaccines was performed by an unblinded designated person. All other personnel 
was planned to be blind. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Sets: 
Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS),  Immunogenicity  Day  22:  All  randomised  subjects  who  received  a  study 
vaccination and provided evaluable serum samples both at day 1 and at day 22.  
Per Protocol Set (PPS), Immunogenicity Day 22: All subjects in the FAS who received the correct vaccine 
and had no major protocol deviation prior to unblinding. 
FAS,  Antibody  Persistence  Testing:  All  randomised  subjects  at  US  sites  who  (i)  received  a  study 
vaccination  and  (ii)  provided  evaluable  blood  samples  at  day  1,  day  22,  day  181,  and  day  366.  This 
subset of 700 subjects was randomly selected from among all subjects at United States sites, thus the 
antibody persistence subset was not representative of the entire study population. 
Modified Full Analysis Set (mFAS), Effectiveness: All subjects included in the Effectiveness FAS, but for 
those subjects who received a non-study influenza vaccination during the follow-up phase, any ILI/health 
care  utilization/exacerbation  of  pre-existing  chronic  diseases/deaths  occurring  after  the  non-study 
vaccination were not included in the analysis. 
Primary Immunogenicity Analysis  
Non-Inferiority 
All non-inferiority analyses were performed on the PPS Immunogenicity Day 22.  
GMT at Day 22: For each of the 3 strains, log-transformed GMT values were analysed by using ANCOVA 
model  with  factors  vaccine  group,  country,  age  and  with  covariate  log-transformed  pre-vaccination 
antibody titre. Point estimates and 2-sided 95% CIs for ratios of GMTs (aTIV/TIV) were based on these 
analyses. 
SCR at Day 22: For each of the 3 strains, seroconversion rates (binary data) were analysed by using 
log-linear models with factors vaccine group, country, and age. Vaccination group differences (aTIV – 
TIV) along with 95% CIs were based on this model. 
To assess non inferiority of a TIV vs. TIV, the lower limit of the 95% CI for GMT ratio needs to be >0.67 
and the lower limit of the 95% CI for the SCR difference needs to be >-10% for all 3 strains. 
Superiority 
All superiority analyses were performed on the FAS Immunogenicity Day 22 
The family of six superiority hypotheses was tested applying a multiple test procedure that keeps the 
familywise error rate at 1-sided α=2.5%. The Holm–Bonferroni method was applied. 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 93/194 
 
 
 
GMT  and  SCR  at  Day  22  were  analysed  using  the  same  models  as  was  used  for  the  non-inferiority 
analyses. Point estimates and multiplicity unadjusted 2-sided 95% confidence intervals for ratios of GMTs 
and difference of SCR were based on these models.  
To adjust for multiplicity, adjusted p-values were calculated using the method described by Dmitrienko 
et  al  (2010).  Simultaneous  confidence  intervals  for  step-wise  procedures  with  differently  scaled 
endpoints (binary and normal distributed in the present study) are not available. Therefore all confidence 
intervals provided will not take multiplicity into consideration. 
To assess superiority of aTIV vs. TIV, the lower limit of the 95% CI for GMT ratio needs to be >1.5 and 
the lower limit of the 95% CI for the SCR difference needs to be >10% for at least 2 of the 3 strains. 
Interim Analysis: The final results were based on data from the interim analysis. 
Multiplicity 
The confirmatory testing strategy was planned in a sequential order. 
First,  the  lot-to-lot  consistency  was  to  be  tested.  Then  if,  and  only  if,  consistency  is  confirmed  (i.e., 
rejection of null hypothesis), the non-inferiority test for the 6 primary endpoints was to be conducted. 
Then if, and only if, non-inferiority was confirmed, the superiority test for the 6 primary endpoints was 
conducted. The study was powered to show lot-to-lot consistency and the co-primary objective. 
The Holm-Bonferroni method was used for the multiplicity introduced by the superiority objective. 
Handling Missing data: The applicant considered missing immunogenicity values as MCAR’s.  
Sensitivity  analyses:  All  primary  immunogenicity  analyses  were  performed  for  both  the  FAS 
Immunogenicity Day 22 population and for the PPS Immunogenicity Day 22 population. 
Statistical Analysis Plan Amendments 
The SAP was amended 2 times. After unblinding of the data several additional analyses were performed 
and  were  specified  in  3  addendums.  One  was  an  additional  superiority  testing  with  other  superiority 
margins  1.0  and  0%  besides  superiority  margins  1.5  and  10%  as  was  chosen  for  the  primary 
immunogenicity objective.

Recruitment 
Study V70_27 was conducted 38 centres distributed along Colombia (4), Panama (2), The Philippines 
(11) and United States (21). The study is conducted in the 2010/2011 influenza season. 
Conduct of study 
There were 4 protocol amendments, and 9% of the subjects had at least one major protocol deviation.  
Baseline data 
The  baseline  and  demographic  characteristics  of  subjects  in  the  day  22  FAS  were  closely  matched 
between the two vaccine groups. The mean age of all subjects was 72 years (range: 65 to 97 years), 
with 28% of subjects over 75 years of age (28% and 27% in the aTIV and TIV groups, respectively). A 
higher proportion of females than males was enrolled (65% overall) with similar proportions in the two 
vaccine  groups.  The  main  racial  and ethnic  groups represented  were  Asian  (53%),  Caucasian  (28%), 
and Hispanic (18%) in each of the vaccine groups. The demographic and baseline characteristics of the 
FAS are provided in the table below. About 36% (n=2,573) of all randomized subjects in the day 22 FAS 
were high-risk; most of these subjects were included in the day 22 PPS (34% of randomized subjects; 
n=2,385).

Numbers analysed 
As  per  protocol,  1,768  subjects  (25%  of  randomized  subjects  across  vaccine  groups)  were  randomly 
selected  for  inclusion  in  the  day  22  FAS  for  immunogenicity  analysis  using  heterologous  strains.  The 
majority of these subjects were retained for the day 22 PPS for heterologous testing (1,649 subjects; 
23% of all randomized subjects). Baseline characteristics of the FAS immunogenicity are in line with the 
overall enrolled population.

For the A/H1N1 and B strains, the vaccine group GMT ratios (aTIV:TIV) were 1.37 (lower bound of 95% 
CI: 1.29) and 1.14 (lower bound of 95% CI: 1.08), respectively; for the A/H3N2 strain, the ratio was 
1.6 (lower bound of 95% CI: 1.51). Only the LL of the 95% CI for the day 22 GMT ratio for the A/H3N2 
strain was >1.5, meeting the predefined criterion for superiority. However, after adjusting for multiple 
comparisons  the  p-value  was  0.055.  Therefore  superiority  could  not  be  claimed  according  to  the 
predefined criteria. 
The adjusted day 22 GMTs against each of the 3 homologous strains in the aTIV group were higher than 
those of the TIV group.  
Table 37: Geometric mean HI titres (95% CI) and vaccine group ratios against homologous 
strains day 22 FAS (V70_27) 
Superiority of aTIV to TIV defined as ∆ SCR >10% was achieved for A/H3N2. The lower bound of the 
95%  CI  for  the  aTIV  minus  TIV  difference  in  day  22  seroconversion  rates  for  the  A/H3N2  strain  was 
>10%  (∆=13.8%,  95%  CI:  11.7,  16),  with  an  unadjusted  p-value  for  superiority  of  0.0004,  after 
adjusting for multiple comparisons the p-value was 0.002. 
The adjusted difference in percentage of subjects who seroconverted by day 22 was higher in the aTIV 
group than in the TIV group for each of the homologous strains tested. For the A/H1N1 and B strains, 
the differences were 9.6% (95% CI: 7.4, 11.8) and 3% (95% CI: 1, 7), respectively.

Superiority of aTIV compared with TIV for heterologous strains 
The day 22 GMTr was 1.49 (95% CI: 1.29, 1.72), 1.38 (95% CI:1.24, 1.52) and 1.09 (95%CI: 0.99, 
1.21) for the three strains respectively. This means that aTIV showed higher GMT values compared with 
TIV. The results for the GMRs were similar. 
The difference in SCR (aTIV-TIV) was 12.8% (95% CI: 8.4, 17.2) for A/H1N1, 12.5% (95%CI: 0.1, 17) 
for A/H3N2 and 4.2% (95%CI: 0, 8.4) for the B-strain against heterologous test strains. The adjusted 
differences in percentage of subjects that seroconverted to both of the A/H3N2 strains, but not the B 
strain, by day 22 were higher in the aTIV group compared with the TIV. 
Comparison of aTIV and TIV in antibody persistence subset 
Antibody persistence was assessed by GMT and seroconversion rates in serum samples from day 181 (6 
months) and day 366 (1 year) postvaccination.

By day 181, GMTs against homologous strains in both vaccine groups had declined compared with 
day 22. However, as shown, GMTs against the homologous A/H3N2 strain at day 181 and day 366 
were higher in the aTIV group than in the TIV group (day 181: 1.35 [95% CI: 1.06-1.71] and day 366: 
1.3 [95% CI: 1.01- 1.67]). Similar results were seen for seroconversion rates with a significantly 
greater percentage of subjects in the aTIV group than in the TIV group with seroconversion against the 
homologous A/H3N2 strain (difference of 11.9%) at day 181. By day 366, the difference had decreased 
to 3.8% (NS). 
By day 181, antibody levels against heterologous strains had declined in both vaccine group subsets 
with no significant difference in GMTs at day 181 or day 366 against the heterologous strains tested. 
Similarly, no difference at day 181 and day 366 between the vaccine groups was found considering the 
SCR. 
Ancillary analyses 
Age  
The applicant presented the immune response in the following age strata: ≥65 – 75 years and  
>75 years. At day 22, the adjusted GMT ratios indicated a higher response in the aTIV group than in the 
TIV group against all 3 homologous strains in both age cohorts, and the size of the benefit was sustained 
in the older age group as the GMT ratios were similar. The response was higher in persons age 65- 75 
years  for  the  A-strains  (i.e.  the  GMR  D22/D1  was  higher  in  ≥65-75  vs  >75  years)  but  not  for  the  B

Study V118_18, a Phase III, Randomized, Observer-Blind, Controlled, Multicenter Clinical Study to 
Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety and Immunogenicity of an MF59-Adjuvanted Quadrivalent Influenza 
Vaccine Compared to Non-influenza Vaccine Comparator in Adults ≥ 65 Years of Age. 
Methods 
The  goal  of  this  randomized,  observer-blind,  controlled  study  was  to  demonstrate  that  Fluad  Tetra 
prevents  influenza  in  elderly  adults.  Direct  comparison  with  a  non-influenza  comparator  vaccine 
(Boostrix) licensed for use in this age group, enabled an estimation of the absolute efficacy of aQIV in 
preventing influenza in elderly adults while simultaneously providing benefit to subjects randomized to 
not receive influenza vaccine. The study was conducted during the NH 2016/17 and SH 2017 influenza 
seasons. 
The  study  enrolled  male  and  female  adults  ≥  65  years  old  who  were  healthy  or  had  co-morbidities. 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio and were subsequently followed up for 12 months. Each subject 
had two stages of study participation: Treatment Period (Day 1 to Day 22) and Follow-up Period (Day 
23 to Day 366).  
Whenever  nasopharyngeal  swabs  were  collected,  they  were  processed  for  viral  culture  and  RT-PCR 
confirmation. The viral culture was used for viral expansion to enable antigenic characterization of the 
influenza virus (e.g. antigenic match). 
The  secondary  immunogenicity  objective  was  assessed  by  HI  assay  conducted  on  serum  samples 
collected before vaccination on Day 1 and on Day 22 by titrating antibodies against homologous influenza 
strains.  
A protocol specified unblinded interim analysis was conducted by the Data Monitoring Committee on 03 
Aug 2017 for evaluation of the primary efficacy objective (VE against any influenza) using 167 RT-PCR 
confirmed influenza cases exclusively from the NH 2016/17 season. 
Study participants 
Planned: In order to obtain 238 PCR-confirmed influenza cases and assuming a drop-out rate of 10%, 
approximately 10692 subjects ≥65 years, 5,346 per vaccine group were to be randomized to receive 
either aQIV or non-influenza comparator (Boostrix) in a 1:1 allocation ratio.  
Treatments 
The products to be used in the clinical trial are: 
1.  Investigational Vaccine: aQIV a 0.5 mL dose of aQIV (quadrivalent MF59C.1 adjuvanted influenza 
vaccine) contained 60 μg of hemagglutinin (HA): 15 μg of HA of each of the two influenza type 
Assessment report

Page 101/194 
 
 
 
A strains and each of the two influenza type B strains recommended by WHO for the 2016-2017 
NH and 2017 SH influenza seasons for quadrivalent. 
2.  Boostrix  is  a  combined  Tetanus  Toxoid,  Reduced  Diphtheria  Toxoid  and  Acellular  Pertussis 
Vaccine 
Objectives 
The  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  objectives  were  measured  in  all  subjects  in  relation  to  cases  of 
influenza occurring from ≥21 through ≤180 days after vaccination or until the end of influenza season, 
whichever was longer. In all cases, efficacy was determined based on influenza cases caused by A (H1N1 
and H3N2) and either B lineage. 
Primary Efficacy Objective: 
1.  To  demonstrate  absolute  vaccine  efficacy  (VE)  of  aQIV  versus  non-influenza  comparator 
(Boostrix)  when  administered  as  a  single  dose  to  prevent  first  occurrence  RT-PCR  confirmed 
influenza, due to any strain of influenza regardless of antigenic match to the strains selected for 
the seasonal vaccine, in subjects ≥ 65 years of age. 
Key Secondary Efficacy Objective:  
1.  To demonstrate absolute VE of aQIV versus non-influenza comparator when administered as a 
single dose to prevent first occurrence culture-confirmed influenza, due to strains antigenically 
matched to the strains selected for the seasonal vaccine.  
Secondary Efficacy Objectives:  
2.  To evaluate absolute VE of aQIV versus non-influenza comparator when administered as a single 
dose  to  prevent  first  occurrence  culture-confirmed  influenza,  due  to  any  strain  of  influenza 
regardless of antigenic match to the strains selected for the seasonal vaccine.  
3.  To evaluate absolute VE of aQIV versus non-influenza comparator when administered as a single 
dose  to  prevent  first  occurrence  culture-confirmed  influenza,  due  to  strains  antigenically 
unmatched to the strains selected for the seasonal influenza vaccine.  
4.  To evaluate the absolute efficacy of aQIV versus non-influenza comparator when administered 
as  a  single  dose  to  prevent  first  occurrence  RT-PCR  confirmed  influenza  due  to  any  strain  of 
influenza regardless of antigenic match from 7 days to 180 days after vaccination or at the end 
of influenza season, whichever was longer (early efficacy).  
Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives:  
5.  To evaluate the immunogenicity of aQIV measured by Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer 21 
days after vaccination, against influenza strains homologous to the seasonal vaccine.  
Exploratory Immunogenicity Objective:  
6.  To  characterize  the  immunogenicity  of  aQIV  using  other  immunological  assays  (such  as 
microneutralization [MN] assay).  
7.  To explore potential immune correlates of protection based on HI and/or other immunological 
assays (such as MN assay).

Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  and  the  secondary  efficacy  objectives  1-4  were  analyzed  using  two  ILI  definitions  for 
influenza. Below are found the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Primary Endpoints 
- Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary Efficacy Endpoint was the time to first occurrence of RT-PCR confirmed influenza from 21 
through 180 days after vaccination or end of the influenza season, whichever was longer. The end of the 
influenza season was defined as the end of June for NH influenza season and the end of December for 
SH  influenza  season.  For  tropical  countries,  the  season  was  defined  using  the  strains  in  the  vaccine 
formulation  (i.e.  strains  as  recommended  for  the  NH  or  the  SH  influenza  season)  and  the  timing  of 
vaccination. 
The  primary  protocol-definition  of  ILI  was  used  to  determine  success  for  the  primary  and  secondary 
efficacy endpoints. All primary and secondary efficacy objectives were also analysed using the modified 
CDC ILI definition. 
Randomisation 
aQIV or non-influenza comparator (Boostrix) in a 1:1 allocation ratio. 
Blinding (masking) 
The administration of the vaccines was performed by an unblinded designated person.  
Statistical methods 
The Statistical Analysis Plan version 2.0 provides the description of the analysis for the active study 
period and safety follow-up through to the final evaluation (12 months following last study vaccination 
dose), sample size, and power considerations. 
Analysis Sets: 
•

Analysis of Efficacy Objectives  
Primary and key secondary VE data were analyzed using the FAS Efficacy and PPS Efficacy sets. All 
non-key secondary VE objectives were analyzed using FAS Efficacy and repeated on PPS.  
Primary and Secondary Efficacy Objectives:  
The primary measure of absolute efficacy was tested in elderly subjects ≥ 65 years of age according to 
the following null (H0) and alternative (H1) hypotheses: H0: 1- HR = VE ≤ 0.4 versus H1: VE > 0.4 
where HR is the hazard ratio of the incidence of protocol-defined ILI in aQIV versus a non-influenza 
comparator estimated by the proportional hazards model and VE is vaccine efficacy. One interim 
analysis was performed. To control the overall type 1 error alpha ≤ 0.05, the CIs for the final analysis 
of primary efficacy objective were adjusted accordingly. The primary efficacy and key secondary 
efficacy objectives were considered achieved if the lower limit (LL) of the adjusted two-sided 95% CI of 
absolute VE exceeded 40%.  
Post-hoc Analysis: VE using the standard CDC ILI Definition and the WHO ILI definition: VE estimates 
were calculated using similar analyses as the primary and secondary efficacy objectives.  
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity data were analyzed using FAS Immunogenicity and repeated using PPS 
Immunogenicity if more than 5% of subjects were excluded from FAS Immunogenicity. All statistical 
analyses for HI titers were performed on the logarithmically (base 10) transformed values. Individual 
HI titers below detection limit (< 10) were set to half of that limit (5). Crude estimates for GMTs, GMRs 
and pertaining two-sided 95% CIs were calculated assuming lognormal distribution of the titers and 
were completed by providing minimum, maximum and median titers for each vaccine group.  
Binary data (i.e., percentages of subjects with seroconversion and with titer ≥ 1:40) were summarized 
for each group using unadjusted estimates and was reported together with two-sided 95% CIs.  
Immunogenicity endpoints at Day 22 were assessed according to the criteria for sufficient immune 
response described in Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Guidance ‘Clinical Data 
Needed to Support the Licensure of Seasonal Inactivated Influenza Vaccines’ (2007) states the 
following: 
• 
• 
Results  
The lower limit (LL) of the two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the percent of 
subjects achieving seroconversion for HI antibody should have met or exceeded 30%.  
The LL of the two-sided 95% CI for the percent of subjects who achieved an HI antibody 
titer ≥ 1:40 should have met or exceeded 60%. 
The following changes were made to the planned analysis: 
 •  Since  the  study  failed  to  reach  primary  objectives,  the  key  secondary  objectives  were  tested  at 
alpha=0.05. 
The exploratory immunogenicity objectives (immunogenicity of aQIV using other immunological assays 
and potential immune correlates of protection) were not evaluated as part of the current analyses. 
No significant amendments were performed on the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
Changes Following Study Unblinding and Post-hoc Analyses: Additional post-hoc analyses to demonstrate 
VE using WHO and standard CDC definition for ILI were performed.

Participant flow  
Overall, 6,790 subjects were enrolled in this study. Of these, 6,761 (99.6%) subjects were exposed to 
study treatments with a similar number of subjects exposed to aQIV and Boostrix (3,379 received aQIV 
and  3,382  received  Boostrix).  Most  enrolled  subjects  (6,536  [96.3%])  completed  the  study.  The 
proportion of subjects that discontinued the study was low (254 subjects [3.7%]). 
Recruitment 
This study was conducted between 30 September 2016 and 23 July 2018 at 89 sites in 12 countries: 
11 sites in Bulgaria, 7 sites in Colombia, 5 sites in Czech Republic, 6 sites in Estonia, 4 sites in Latvia, 
7 sites in Lithuania, 8 sites in Malaysia, 6 sites in the Philippines, 15 sites in Poland, 8 sites in 
Romania, 4 sites in Thailand, and 8 sites in Turkey. 
Conduct of the study 
Interim Analysis 
According to the prespecified rule described above, one unblinded interim analysis was conducted by the 
DMC on 03 Aug 2017 for evaluation of the primary efficacy objective (VE against any RT-PCR confirmed 
influenza) using 167 RT-PCR confirmed influenza cases exclusively from the NH 2016/17 season. The 
DMC informed Seqirus that “based solely on the charter’s statistical rule for stopping, the study reached 
the pre-specified stopping p-value for futility for the primary efficacy objective, however, Seqirus may 
choose to continue the study to completion for clinical or epidemiological reasons given that there is no 
safety reason to stop the study.” Seqirus opted to continue the study while remaining completely blinded. 
As  a  consequence  of the  interim  analysis,  the  CIs  of  the  final  primary  efficacy  analysis  were updated 
from 95% to 97.45% to control the overall type I error under 5%.  
Baseline data 
Overall,  the  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  of  subjects  enrolled  in  this  study  were  well 
balanced between the two vaccine groups with similar age, sex, ethnicity, race, and BMI. 
Twenty-seven percent (27.2%) of subjects had a high comorbidity score (≥ 50). Most of the subjects 
(6130 [90.3%]) were non-smokers. Approximately 60% of the subjects were enrolled in the NH 2016/17 
season and 40% in the SH 2017 season. 
Numbers analysed 
Overall,  6,761  subjects  received  study  treatment  according  to  the  randomization  schedule  (3,379 
subjects received aQIV and 3382 subjects received Boostrix).  
The FAS Efficacy consisted of 6,740 subjects (3,368 in the aQIV group and 3372 in Boostrix group). The 
PPS Efficacy consisted of 6,603 subjects (3,291 in the aQIV group and 3312 in the Boostrix group).

FAS Efficacy 
Using the protocol defined ILI, there were 273 cases of RT-PCR confirmed influenza due to any strain. 
Most of these cases (214 cases) were caused by an H3N2 virus. Around 50% of RT-PCR confirmed cases 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 106/194 
 
 
 
 
(139  cases)  were  culture-confirmed.  118  of  these  cases  were  due  to  strains  antigenically  unmatched 
(defined as ≥ 8-fold difference in titer as compared to the vaccine strain) to the vaccine strains; so only 
21 cases were as matched to the strains contained in Fluad Tetra. 
Primary Efficacy Objective: Vaccine Efficacy for any RT-PCR Confirmed Influenza  
The efficacy of aQIV in preventing RT-PCR confirmed influenza A and/or B due to any seasonal strain 
was 19.80% (97.45% CI: -5.27%, 38.91%) using the protocol-defined ILI definition. 
Thus, the pre-specified success criterion to demonstrate VE of aQIV was not met for the primary efficacy 
objective, since this criterion was that the LL of the of the two-sided 97.45% CI of VE estimate would 
exceed 40%. The original objective established a 95% CI but it was modified to 97.45% CI taking into 
account the interim analyses conducted during the trial. 
Primary confirmatory objective of demonstrating the efficacy of aQIV in adults 65 years and above in 
protecting against any RT-PCR confirmed influenza A and/or B diseases was not met.  
The results of primary efficacy objective using the PPS Efficacy (21.14% [97.45% CI: -4.36%, 40.41%]) 
indicated similar results as for the FAS Efficacy.  
Key Secondary Efficacy Objective: Vaccine Efficacy  for Influenza Antigenically Matched to the Vaccine 
Strains  
The key Secondary Efficacy Objective was to assess VE against influenza disease caused by strains that 
were antigenically matched to the vaccine strains. 
Protocol-defined ILI  
Overall, the proportion of antigenically matched cases was low. The study did not meet the pre-specified 
success criteria to demonstrate the VE against culture-confirmed influenza, due to strains antigenically 
matched to the vaccine strains as the lower bound of the CI was not above 40%. The VE against any 
vaccine matched cases was 49.94% (95% CI: -24.03%, 79.79%).

Protocol-defined ILI 
The VE against first occurrence of culture-confirmed influenza, due to any strain regardless of antigenic 
match to the vaccine strains, was 28.66% (95% CI: 0.05%, 49.08%). The VE results were consistent 
for  A/H3N2  strain  (30.50%  [95%  CI:  0.60%,  51.41%])  and  B  strains  (24.83%  [95%  CI:  -116.66%;

Days After Vaccination or at the End of Influenza Season (Early Efficacy).  
Protocol-defined ILI  
Overall, 303 cases of RT-PCR confirmed influenza cases occurring from 7 to 180 days or until the end of 
the  influenza  season  were  reported  in  the  study  and  included  in  the  FAS  Early  Efficacy  analysis;  140 
were in the aQIV group, and 163 were in the Boostrix group. The vaccine group comparison yielded an 
overall VE of 14.44% (95% CI: -7.25%, 31.74%).

The  success  criterion  of  the  study  for  the  primary  and  key  secondary  efficacy  objective  was  that  the 
lower  limit  of  the  two-sided  95%  CI  of  VE  estimate  exceeds  40%.  As  shown  above  when  using  the 
Protocol-defined ILI neither the primary nor the key secondary objective was met, as the LL of the 95% 
CI of VE estimates did not exceed 40%.

Similarly,  when  the  modified  CDC  ILI  definition  was  used,  the  success  criterion  of  the  study  for  the 
primary objective, for the key secondary efficacy objective and for the four secondary objectives was 
that the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI of VE estimate exceeds 40%. In none of these cases, the 
success criterion was met.

Post-hoc Analyses 
In addition to the analyses performed with the two prespecified ILI definitions. 
• 
Protocol-defined  ILI:  At  least  one  of  the  following  respiratory  symptoms:  sore  throat,  cough, 
sputum  production,  wheezing,  or  difficulty  breathing;  concurrently  with  at  least  one  of  the 
following  systemic  symptoms:  temperature  of  >37.2°C/99°F,  chills,  tiredness,  headache,  or 
myalgia;  
•  Modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ILI Definition: Fever [temperature of 
>37.2°C/99°F] with cough or sore throat;  
A post-hoc analysis of VE was performed using the two following ILI definitions: 
•  Standard CDC ILI Definition (post-hoc): Fever [temperature of ≥37.8°C/100°F] with cough or 
sore throat (CDC 2017);  
•  WHO  ILI  Definition  (post-hoc):  Fever  [temperature  of  ≥38°C/100.4°F]  with  cough  (Fitzner 
2017). 
The post-hoc analyses were conducted for the primary and three secondary efficacy objectives for all 
subjects in relation to cases of influenza occurring from 21 through 180 days after vaccination or through 
the end of the influenza season, whichever was longer. Efficacy was determined based on influenza cases 
caused by A (H1N1 and H3N2) and either B lineages. The three secondary objectives analysed were: a) 
Culture-confirmed influenza antigenically matched to the vaccine strains; b) Culture-confirmed influenza 
regardless  of  antigenic  match  to  the  vaccine  strains;  and  c)  culture-confirmed  influenza  antigenically 
unmatched to the vaccine strains. 
Summary of these analyses is shown in the next table. 
Table 47: Study V118_18 overview of VE results – FAS Efficacy 
An important observation in study V118_18 was that the clinical criteria used to define ILI appeared to 
have an impact on the estimated efficacy of aQIV. Three definitions of ILI were used for the statistical

analysis of this study and included in the CSR. The primary protocol definition of ILI required the presence 
of at least 1 respiratory and at least 1 systemic symptom and was used to identify potential cases of 
influenza during the surveillance period of the study, but did not require the presence of fever. This was 
consistent with another influenza vaccine efficacy study conducted in this age population (Diaz Granados 
et al. 2014) and represents the most sensitive definition of influenza. Cases defined in this way that were 
confirmed by RT-PCR are likely to include milder disease with limited symptomatology. In contrast, the 
secondary  ‘modified  CDC’  and  post-hoc  'standard  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (CDC)' 
definitions of ILI, which required presence of fever >37.2°C or ≥37.8°C, respectively, with cough or sore 
throat,  are  less  sensitive,  but  more  specific  for  clinical  significant  influenza  disease.  Moreover,  the 
addendum to the CSR includes a fourth post-hoc analysis using the WHO ILI definition (fever ≥38.0 °C 
with  cough)  as  the  most  specific  definition  of  influenza  infection.  (Casalegno  et  al.  2017).  Efficacy  of 
aQIV  was  19.80%  [95%  CI  -5.27,  38.91]  using  the  protocol-specified  ILI  definition,  32.1%  [95%  CI 
10.23, 48.67] using the modified CDC ILI definition, 41.87% [95% CI 18.64, 58.46] using the standard 
CDC ILI definition, and 51.08% [95% CI 28.21, 66.67] using the WHO ILI definition (CSR V118_18).  
In summary, aQIV showed moderate vaccine efficacy against RT-PCR-confirmed and culture-confirmed 
influenza in adults 65 years of age and above. Although the V118_18 study did not meet the primary 
and  key  secondary  efficacy  objectives,  the  study  results  show  reasonable  protection  during  influenza 
seasons with an antigenic mismatch between the circulating and vaccine influenza strains. The observed 
efficacy  of  aQIV  in  V118_18  is  in  line  with  the  effectiveness  estimates  for licensed  influenza  vaccines 
(15%  to  38%),  obtained  during  the  same  influenza  seasons  (Flannery  2019;  Rondy  2017;  Sullivan 
2017). aQIV provided statistically significant protection against more clinically relevant influenza disease 
(influenza cases associated with a higher fever as shown by results using the standard CDC and WHO 
ILI  definitions).  These  results  indicate  that  aQIV  may  prevent  more  severe  and  clinically  relevant 
influenza cases, which is particularly important in this vulnerable elderly population where the medical 
and economic burden of influenza illness is high (Smetana 2018; Matias 2017).  
Immunogenicity results 
Evaluation  of  the  immunogenicity  objectives  was  done  in  the  immunogenicity  sub-cohort  of  subjects. 
The primary analysis was based on the FAS Immunogenicity and a complementary analysis, was also 
performed  on  the  PPS  Immunogenicity  since  more  than  5%  of  subjects  were  excluded  from  the  PPS 
analysis. The FAS cohort for immunogenicity consisted of 1656 subjects (1324 in the aQIV group and 
322 in the Boostrix group). 
The immunogenicity endpoints were assessed at baseline (Day 1) and 3 weeks after the study vaccination 
(Day 22) using HI assay. The Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) and Geometric Mean Ratios (Day 22/Day 1) 
(GMR) results are presented in the following Table

Page 111/194 
 
 
 
Table 48: GMT on Day 1 and Day 22 and GMR (Day22/Day1) of HI – FAS Immunogenicity 
The GMT and GMR results show that: 
 • The GMTs at Day 1 were generally similar between the two vaccine groups for all strains (12.77 to 
31.86 for the aQIV group and 12.26 to 36.19 for the Boostrix group).  
• At Day 22, post-vaccination HI GMTs for the aQIV group were 438.79 (A/H1N1), 572.80 (A/H3N2), 
104.26 (B/Victoria) and 86.77 (B/Yamagata), compared to 29.43, 27.06, 11.25, and 12.49, respectively, 
for the Boostrix group.  
• GMRs (Day 22/Day 1) obtained for the aQIV group (14.17 [A/H1N1], 22.65 [A/H3N2], 8.59 [B/Victoria] 
and 6.58 [B/Yamagata]) were significantly higher than those for Boostrix group (0.89, 1.08, 0.94, and 
0.97, respectively). 
Percentages of Subjects Who Achieved Seroconversion.

The primary measure of absolute efficacy was tested in elderly subjects ≥ 
65 years of age according to the following null (H0) and alternative (H1) 
hypothesis: 
H0: 1- HR = VE ≤ 0.4 versus H1: VE > 0.4 
Where HR is the hazard ratio of the incidence of protocol-defined ILI in aQIV 
versus a non-influenza comparator estimated by the proportional hazards 
model and VE is vaccine efficacy. 
One interim analysis was performed. To control the overall type 1 error 
alpha ≤ 0.05, the CIs for the final analysis of primary efficacy objective 
were adjusted accordingly. 
The primary efficacy and key secondary efficacy objectives were considered 
achieved if the lower limit (LL) of the adjusted two-sided 95% CI of absolute 
VE exceeded 40%. 
Post-hoc Analysis: VE using the standard CDC ILI Definition: 
VE estimates were calculated using similar analyses as the primary and 
secondary efficacy objectives. 
Immunogenicity: 
Immunogenicity data were analyzed using FAS Immunogenicity and repeated 
using PPS Immunogenicity if more than 5% of subjects were excluded from 
FAS Immunogenicity. 
All statistical analyses for HI titers were performed on the logarithmically 
(base 10) transformed values. 
Individual HI titers below detection limit (< 10) were set to half of that limit 
(5). 
Crude estimates for GMTs, GMRs and pertaining two-sided 95% CIs were 
calculated assuming lognormal distribution of the titers and were completed 
by providing minimum, maximum and median titers for each vaccine group. 
Binary data (i.e., percentages of subjects with seroconversion and with titer 
≥ 1:40) were summarized for each group using unadjusted estimates and 
was reported together with two-sided 95% CIs. 
Immunogenicity endpoints at Day 22 were assessed according to the criteria 
for sufficient immune response described in Center for Biologics Evaluation 
and Research (CBER) Guidance ‘Clinical Data Needed to Support the 
Licensure of Seasonal Inactivated Influenza Vaccines’ (2007) states the 
following: 
• The lower limit (LL) of the two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the 
percent of subjects achieving seroconversion for HI antibody should have 
met or exceeded 30%. 
• The LL of the two-sided 95% CI for the percent of subjects who achieved 
an HI antibody titer ≥ 1:40 should have met or exceeded 60%.

Efficacy Results 
In total, 273 cases of RT-PCR confirmed influenza due to any strain were 
reported in the study; 122 were in the aQIV group, and 151 were in the 
comparator group.  
Of 273 RT-PCR-confirmed cases, 214 cases were caused by influenza 
A/H3N2 virus, 35 cases by B strains, 9 cases by A/H1N1 strain. 
In total, 139 of the 273 influenza cases were culture-confirmed, and 21 of 
the 273 influenza cases were defined as matched to the strains contained in 
the aQIV vaccine. 
Primary Efficacy Objective: 
• The efficacy of aQIV in preventing RT-PCR confirmed influenza A and/or B 
due to any seasonal strain was 19.80% (97.45% CI: -5.27%, 38.91%) 
using the protocol-defined ILI definition. 
• Greater VE was observed using the modified CDC ILI definition; the 
efficacy of aQIV in preventing RT-PCR confirmed influenza due to any strain 
was 32.12% (95% CI: 10.23%, 48.67%). 
• Greater VE was obtained during the NH 2016/17 influenza season as 
compared to the SH 2017. 
The VE for any strain detected by RT-PCR using the protocol-defined ILI was 
26.60% (95% CI: 0.60%, 45.80%) for the NH 2016/17 season versus 
7.27% (95% CI: -36.76%, 37.12%) in the SH 2017 season. 
In summary, the majority of influenza cases were caused by A/H3N2 strains 
and were antigenically unmatched to the vaccine strain. The pre-specified 
success criterion to demonstrate efficacy of aQIV against any RT-PCR 
confirmed influenza (the primary objective) was not met as the LL of the 
95% CI of VE estimate did not exceed 40%. The pre-specified success 
criterion to demonstrate efficacy of aQIV against culture-confirmed influenza 
due to antigenically matched strains (the key secondary objective) was also 
not met given the low number of matched cases, as the LL of the 95% CI of 
VE estimates did not exceed 40%. aQIV provided higher VE estimates, with 
lower bounds above zero when the modified CDC ILI and standard CDC ILI 
definitions were used. 
Immunogenicity Results: 
Immunogenicity was assessed using HI assay at baseline (Day 1) and post-
vaccination (Day 22) in a subset of subjects. aQIV elicited a robust post-
vaccination immune response against all four strains contained in the 
vaccine. 
GMTs: 
• At Day 1, GMTs were generally similar between the two vaccine groups for 
all strains (12.77 to 31.86 for the aQIV group and 12.26 to 36.19 for the 
Boostrix group). 
• At Day 22, post-vaccination HI GMTs for the aQIV group were 438.79 
(A/H1N1), 572.80 (A/H3N2), 104.26 (B/Victoria) and 86.77 (B/Yamagata),

compared to 29.43, 27.06, 11.25, and 12.49, respectively, for the Boostrix 
group. 
GMRs: 
• GMRs (Day 22/Day 1) obtained for the aQIV group (14.17 [A/H1N1], 
22.65 [A/H3N2], 8.59 [B/Victoria] and 6.58 [B/Yamagata]) were 
significantly higher than those for Boostrix group (0.89, 1.08, 0.94, and 
0.97, respectively). 
Percentage of subjects with HI titer ≥ 1:40: 
• At Day 1, the percentage of subjects with HI titers ≥ 1:40 were similar in 
both the vaccine groups (21.2 to 49.7% for the aQIV group and 18.7 to 
50.5% for the Boostrix group). 
• At Day 22, post-vaccination, a significantly higher proportion of subjects 
achieved seroconversion in the aQIV group (96.2% [A/H1N1], 95.6% 
[A/H3N2], 81.6% [B/Victoria], and 79.2% [B/Yamagata]) as compared to 
the Boostrix group (46.7%, 41.7%, 18.4%, and 21.5%, respectively). The 
CBER criteria were achieved for all four strains in the aQIV group at Day 22 
(LL of the 95% CI for proportion of subjects with HI antibody titer ≥ 1:40 
was > 60%). 
Seroconversion: 
• A higher proportion of subjects achieved seroconversion in the aQIV group 
(78.0% [A/H1N1], 84.6% [A/H3N2], 65.5% [B/Victoria], and 60.8% 
[B/Yamagata]) as compared to the Boostrix group (2.1%, 3.9%, 2.1%, and 
3.6%, respectively). 
• The CBER criteria were achieved for all four strains in the aQIV group at 
Day 22 (LL of the 95% CI the proportion of subjects achieving an HI 
antibody seroconversion exceeded 30%). 
Subgroups (age, comorbidity status, previous vaccination, gender, and 
race): 
• Subgroup analyses confirmed adequate immune response of aQIV in 
subjects of different age groups (≥ 65-74, ≥ 75-84, ≥ 85 years), 
comorbidity status, previous influenza vaccination history, gender and race. 
In summary, aQIV elicited a robust immune response against all four strains 
contained in the vaccine which met CBER criteria of sufficient 
immunogenicity for this age group

Success Criterion for Key Secondary Efficacy Objective 
The key secondary objective was achieved if the LL of the two-sided 95% CI 
of absolute VE estimate was > 0.4. As for the primary efficacy objective, the 
CI level was to be adjusted to reflect adjustment of type 1 error in case of an 
interim analysis.

results 
Success Criteria for Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives 
The endpoints of percent of subjects achieving seroconversion and HI titer ≥ 
1:40 at Day 22 were assessed against the criteria described in CBER 
Guidance Clinical Data Needed to Support the Licensure of Seasonal 
Inactivated Influenza Vaccines (2007): 
• The LL of the two-sided 95% CI for the percentage of subjects achieving 
seroconversion for HI antibody should meet or exceed 30%. 
• The LL of the two-sided 95% CI for the percentage of subjects achieving an 
HI antibody titer ≥1:40 should meet or exceed 60%. 
Key Secondary Efficacy Objective 1: 
• A low number of influenza cases met the definition as antigenically 
matched to the vaccine strain; 21 of the 273 influenza cases. 
• The point estimate for efficacy of aQIV in prevention of culture-confirmed 
influenza A and/or B due to antigenically-matched vaccine strains was in the 
expected range (VE of 49.94% [95% CI: -24.03%, 79.79%] for the 
protocol-defined ILI and 61.50% [95% CI: -7.98%, 86.28%] for modified 
CDC ILI). 
Secondary Efficacy Objective 2: 
• The efficacy of aQIV in preventing culture-confirmed influenza A and/or B 
due to any strain was consistent with the results obtained for any RT-PCR 
confirmed influenza: VE of 28.66% (95% CI: 0.05%, 49.08%) for the 
protocol-defined ILI and 33.47% (95% CI: 2.56%, 54.57%) for modified 
CDC ILI. 
Secondary Efficacy Objective 3: 
• The efficacy of aQIV in preventing culture-confirmed influenza A and/or B 
due to antigenically unmatched strains was 23.79% (95% CI: -9.69%, 
47.05%) for the protocol-defined ILI and 26.11% (95% CI: -11.71%, 
51.13%) for modified CDC ILI definition. Greater VE was obtained during 
the NH 2016/17 influenza season as compared to the SH 2017: 42.10% 
(95% CI: 7.72%, 63.67%) for the NH 2016/17 and -22.13% (95% CI: -
124.23%, 33.48%) for the SH 2017, for protocol-defined ILI. 
Secondary Efficacy Objective 4: 
• The efficacy of aQIV against any RT-PCR confirmed influenza during the 
period from 7 days to 180 days after vaccination was in the same range as 
the estimate obtained as from 21 days to 180 days post-vaccination: 
14.44% (95% CI: -7.25%, 31.74%).

2.5.5.  Supportive studies (elderly indication) 
This  section  summarizes  immunogenicity  results  from  the  7  supportive  studies  that  compare 
immunogenicity of a single dose of aTIV versus TIV. There were also two open label noninterventional 
studies  comparing  aTIV  versus  TIV,  which  were not  sponsored  by  the  Applicant,  but  that  will  also  be 
commented.  The  summary  provided  for  each  study  is  based  on  the  primary  analysis  population 
prespecified  in  the  protocol  and  its  accompanying  SAP;  this  was  typically  the  PPS,  unless  specified 
otherwise. 
The  7  supportive  studies  evaluated  different  aspects  of  the  immunogenicity  of  aTIV  versus  TIV: 
immunogenicity as determined by HI assay at baseline and at approximately 3-4 weeks postvaccination 
against  homologous  or  heterologous  strains,  antibody  persistence  at  6  months  postvaccination, 
immunogenicity (homologous or heterologous strains) as determined by microneutralization (MN) assay, 
cell mediated response (CMI) to vaccination with aTIV and immunogenicity in subjects receiving up to 3 
consecutive (annual) vaccinations. 
The two open label noninterventional studies comparing aTIV versus TIV were conducted to assess the 
relative risk (RR) of hospitalizations for influenza disease or pneumonia (C70P1 conducted in Italy) and 
to assess vaccine effectiveness for influenza disease (V70_49OBTP conducted Canada).  
The summary table of immunogenicity results provided for many of the 7 studies below refers to the 
criteria established in 1996 by the CHMP (CPMP/BWP/214/96) which were current at the time of conduct 
of  the  studies.  While  some  of  these  studies  were  conducted  prior  to  the  criteria  coming  into  force, 
immunogenicity  results  for  endpoints  corresponding  to  each  criterion  were  included  in  each  of  the  7 
studies; therefore, these results were used to provide an objective and standardized assessment of the 
immunogenicity of aTIV.  
A summary of the immunogenicity results of the 7 supportive studies follows. Overall, there was a trend 
of  greater  immunogenicity  in  adjuvanted  vaccine  (aTIV)  groups  compared  to  nonadjuvanted  vaccine 
(TIV) groups across all supportive studies in terms of GMTs at approximately 3 weeks after vaccination, 
GMRs, and SCRs.

Immune response after revaccination 
Five of the supportive studies (V7P3, V7P5, V7P7, V7P8 and V7P25), evaluated the immunogenicity after 
revaccination  with  aTIV  versus  revaccination  with  TIV.  Subjects  received  a  second  and  even  a  third 
annual  injection  with  the  same  vaccine  received  approximately  1  year  (or  two  years)  earlier  in  the 
corresponding study that compared aTIV with TIV. 
Overall, the responses obtained in the aTIV groups were higher than those from the TIV groups, but not 
in all cases and in all strains. In any case, the antibody response in the subjects that received aTIV was 
at least non-inferior to the response in the subjects that received TIV. 
Effectiveness studies with aTIV 
The applicant submitted two publications regarding vaccine effectiveness of aTIV instead of two clinical 
study reports. Based upon these publications claims in section 5.1 are made. 
Study C70P1 
Study C70P1 was a noninterventional prospective cohort study performed in the 5 Northern Italian health 
districts during the 2006/2007, 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 influenza seasons (Mannino et al 2012).  
The study objectives were to assess the relative risk of hospitalizations for influenza or pneumonia during 
the  influenza  season  amongst  subjects  ≥65  years  of  age  who  received  either  aTIV  or  nonadjuvanted 
TIV. The choice of influenza vaccine for each study subject, either aTIV or TIV (Agrippal), was left to the 
individual provider to be determined on the basis of local influenza vaccination policy. 
The study outcome was defined as a hospital discharge diagnoses for influenza or pneumonia at least 3 
weeks following vaccination during defined periods of the influenza season based on the epidemic curves 
of the national influenza surveillance. The primary analysis was based on outcomes occurring during and 
including adjacent weeks to the peak of the influenza season. Laboratory based confirmation of influenza 
was not available. 
Over  the  3  influenza  seasons,  the  study  enrolled  107,661  subjects  of  ≥65  years  of  age,  with  43,667 
subjects  participating  for  more  than  1  year.  Overall,  170,988  vaccinations  were  administered  by  the 
subjects’ health care providers comprising of 88,449 doses of aTIV and 82,539 doses of TIV. Due to local 
immunization policy, subjects who received aTIV had worse baseline health status than those subjects 
who received TIV. After adjusting for confounding variables (baseline health status, others), the risk of 
hospitalization for influenza or pneumonia was 25% lower for aTIV relative to TIV (relative risk = 0.75, 
95% CI: 0.57-0.98). Outside of the influenza season, the baseline risk of hospitalization was higher for 
aTIV than for TIV recipients indicating that the analysis had not removed all confounding. To the extent 
that there is residual bias, this would suggest the true protective effect of aTIV would be even stronger. 
Study V70_49OBTP 
Study  V70_49OBTP  was  a  noninterventional  study  using  a  test-negative  design  to  estimate  vaccine 
effectiveness  of  aTIV  versus  a  nonadjuvanted  TIV  (standard  TIV  predominantly  Fluviral),  or  no 
vaccination in subjects ≥65 years of age in three Canadian Health Authorities. 
Cases were defined as patients with ILI who were influenza polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive, 
and controls were defined as patients with ILI but who were influenza PCR-negative as analyzed at a 
central provincial laboratory. In total, 282 subjects (84 cases and 198 controls) were enrolled among 
whom 227 subjects had received routine vaccination, comprising of 165 subjects vaccinated with aTIV, 
62 with a nonadjuvanted TIV and 55 non-vaccinated subjects. The majority of the participants reported 
at least a one chronic disease (89%). The most commonly reported chronic diseases categories were 
cardiac  (72%)  followed  by  neurological  (39%)  and  respiratory  condition  (30%).  After  adjustment  for 
confounding variables (age, sex, residency in long-term care facility, chronic conditions, region and week

of testing), the absolute vaccine effectiveness for aTIV was 58% (95% CI: 5%, 82%; P < 0.04) whereas 
nonadjuvanted  TIV  was  ineffective  compared  to  no vaccination.  The  relative  vaccine  effectiveness  for 
aTIV was 63% (95% CI: 4%, 86%; P = 0.04) as compared to nonadjuvanted TIV.  
Concomitant administration 
To support concomitant administration of aTIV with PPSV23 and PCV13 two publications were included 
in the literature references. 
PPSV23 
Song et al, Immunogenicity and safety of concomitant MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine and 23-valent 
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine administration in elderly. Vaccine 33 (2015) 4647-4652. 
In this study, subjects aged ≥65 years (N = 224) were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive aTIV alone, aTIV 
+ 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) in contralateral arms, aTIV + PPSV23 in the 
same arm or PPSV23 alone. HI assays were used to evaluate the response for the influenza antigens. 
Validated multiplex opsonophagocytic killing assay (MOPA) was used to evaluate the response against 
pneumococcal antigens. Target strains (expressing capsule types 5, 6B, 18C and 19A, respectively) were 
derived from wild-type strains. HI antibody titres and OIs were expressed as geometric means with 95% 
confidence intervals. Non-inferiority was defined as met if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for 
the GMT ratio [(aTIV + PPSV23)/PPSV23 or (aTIV + PPSV23)/aTIV] at one month post-vaccination was 
>0.5 (2-fold criterion). Results were considered statistically significantly lower, if the upper limit of the 
95% CI for the GMT ratio was <1.0.  
After concomitant administration, the non-inferiority criterion of HI GMT ratios was met for all influenza 
subtypes except the influenza A/H3N2 virus: for group 3 compared to group 1, the lower limit of the 
95% CI was 0.49, just below the cut-off of >0.5 (2- fold criterion). The non-inferiority criterion for the 
OI GMT ratio was met for all four pneumococcal serotypes in group 3 compared to group 4. The response 
against the other 19 pneumococcal serotypes was not determined. 
PCV13 
Song  et  al  Immunogenicity  and  safety  of  a  13-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  and  an 
MF59-adjuvanted  influenza  vaccine  after  concomitant  vaccination  in  ≥60-year-old  adults.  Vaccine  35 
(2017) 313–320 
Subjects aged ≥ 60 years were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive aTIV+ 13-valent pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine (PCV13) (Group 1), PCV13 (Group 2), or aTIV (Group 3). HI and OPA assays were 
used to compare immunogenicity after single or concomitant vaccination. Non inferiority criteria were a 
lower limit of the 95% CI of the GMT ratios >0.5. In total of 1149 subjects (Group 1, N = 373; Group 2, 
N  =  394;  Group  3,  N  =  382)  were  available  for  the  assessment  of  immunogenicity  and  safety.  After 
concomitant  administration,  the  non-inferiority  criteria  of  GMT  ratios  were  met  for  all  three  influenza 
subtypes  and  13  pneumococcal  serotypes.  Point  estimates  for  the  ratios  of  all  three  influenza  strains 
were below 1 and the point estimates for the ratios of the pneumococcal serotypes were all except one 
(serotype 6B) below 1. 
Additional expert consultation 
As a request from the CHMP, in line with current CHMP guidance, the VWP discussed that inference of 
superior efficacy for aQIV vs. QIV in children aged 6-36 months based on superior humoral immune 
responses is not possible. It remains essential that approval of aQIV is founded on a demonstration of 
superior efficacy vs. a licensed QIV in this age range. It is also necessary to demonstrate that the 
safety profile of the aQIV is not sufficiently different from that of QIV to cause any concern. On this 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 126/194 
 
 
 
matter, the VWP agreed that the safety data for the aQIV would not preclude an approval for use in 
children aged 6-36 months if there was an adequate demonstration of efficacy.  
The VWP noted that most cases of influenza accrued during the pivotal efficacy trial V118_05 were 
collected in the second season (2014-2015), which was a H3N2 dominated season where the 
circulating strains were largely unmatched to the vaccine strain. This mismatch would be expected to 
impact on the efficacy of the aQIV and QIV vaccines. Importantly, the benefit of the adjuvant might 
however be limited if the antigenic distance between the vaccine strain and circulating strains is 
beyond the breadth of antibody responses commonly induced by the adjuvanted vaccine. The fact that 
superiority was not shown for aQIV over QIV in this setting indicates that adding the adjuvant did not 
result in improved efficacy against poorly matched strains.  
The trial failed the primary endpoint. 
The trial was not powered for the pre-defined secondary analyses. Nevertheless, among these 
secondary analyses, the applicant points out: i) statistically superior rVE for the H1N1 matched strains 
in the 6m-72m age group [59.39%, 95%CI (2.06, 83.16)]; ii) statistically superior rVE in children 6 to 
<24 months of age [31.37% (3.14, 51.38)]; and iii) early rVE at 7 and 14 days after the first and up 
to the second vaccination [54.66% (18.08, 74.91) and 70.56% (35.19, 86.62) respectively]. However, 
some results of secondary analyses are inconsistent by subgroup without biological plausibility for the 
finding (e.g. superior efficacy for aQIV was shown in male but not female subjects despite the lack of 
any difference in immune response between sexes).  
Since the youngest children are the most likely to be influenza-naïve and therefore might be the group 
most likely to derive some additional benefit from an adjuvanted vaccine, the VWP particularly noted 
the rVE in the subset of the 6-24-month-olds, with a lower bound of the 95% CI just above zero 
(3.14). It was also discussed that there remains an unmet need for influenza vaccines that achieve 
priming of the influenza-naïve paediatric population since only unadjuvanted vaccines are currently 
licensed for use in this age range. Nevertheless, the VWP was not persuaded that the data are 
sufficiently robust to grant a restricted indication in children aged 6-24 months. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy (paediatric indication) 
The CDC and the WHO recommend the use of two doses (separated by 4 weeks) of inactivated 
influenza vaccine for subjects 6 months to < 9 years of age who have previously received only 1 dose 
of influenza vaccine, or who have never received influenza vaccine previously. One dose is 
recommended for those who have previously received 2 or more total doses of any influenza vaccine. 
This same approach has been followed in the CTs performed with Fluad Tetra. 
The use of half dose of Fluad Tetra (0.25 ml) in younger children (6 to < 36 months) and a full dose 
(0.5 ml) for older children (36 to 72 months) derives from the dose-finding study V104P2 and the 
pivotal clinical efficacy trial V118_05. The results from these two studies provided support also for the 
2-dose schedule in subjects influenza naïve. 
The use of the Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) assay as the primary assay to assess vaccine 
immunogenicity in CTs is in line with the recommendations of the Guideline on Influenza Vaccines 
(EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014). However, it should be noted that HI titers are not a true surrogate 
marker in the sense that there is not an accepted cut-off titer that defines clinical protection.  
Comparing HI titers in terms of GMTs and GMRs is considered appropriate. Similarly, the definition of 
Seroconversion rate (defined as the percentage of subjects achieving either: 1) a prevaccination 
(baseline) HI titer <1:10 and postvaccination HI titer ≥1:40 after vaccination; or 2) a prevaccination 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 127/194 
 
 
 
(baseline) HI titer ≥1:10 and a ≥4-fold increase in postvaccination HI titer) is also considered 
appropriate. 
For the efficacy assessment, all swab samples from ILI cases were assayed by RT-PCR and sequencing 
(only for B strains) assays to obtain laboratory confirmation of influenza positive samples, which is 
considered an adequate approach. These assays were validated and the corresponding reports are 
considered adequate. Another sample of the swab was used to isolate the influenza virus in cell culture 
using MDCK cells and/or rhesus monkey kidney cells. To try determining if the infected strains 
matched or not the vaccine strain, two test were used, a HI and a microneutralization (MN) test 
specifically designed for identifying antigenic match. The results of the two tests were discrepant, 
being those obtained with the MN test more in line with the epidemiological data from that season 
(2014-15), which was known to be a mismatched season for A/H3N2 (i.e., the strain that was 
circulating in the season was antigenically distinct from the vaccine strain). During assessment of the 
MAA, it was clear that there was a problem with the serological HI assay used by one of the labs that 
performed the H3 testing so that many true unmatched H3 strains were erroneously classified as 
matched strains. When the samples originally tested at this lab were retested at the second lab it was 
shown that only 5% of H3 influenza cases observed in the CT V118_05 matched the H3 component of 
the vaccine.  
The Clinical Development Plan (CDP) was based on the supportive immunogenicity clinical trials in the 
paediatric population with an aTIV (Fluad). In addition, the Applicant provides in this MAA data 
obtained with aQIV, including the results from a dose-finding study (V104P2) and the pivotal trial 
(V118_05) in which clinical efficacy and immunogenicity was measured using subjects vaccinated with 
a non-adjuvanted vaccine as the comparator arm.  
Since the manufacturing process and formulation of aQIV and Fluad (adjuvanted Trivalent Influenza 
Vaccine, aTIV) are the same, with the exception of an additional B strain included in aQIV, it is 
considered that clinical study experience with aTIV in subjects 6 months to <6 years of age provides 
relevant and valuable data for assessment of the overall immunogenicity and safety of aQIV. 
Dose finding study 
Overall, study V104P2 was well designed and performed. This trial provided clear support for the use 
of the MF59 adjuvant in population from 6 to <36 months of age, since all MF59 adjuvanted 
formulations induced statistically superior antibody responses compared to a nonadjuvanted vaccine 
against both homologous vaccine A strains in terms of GMTs.  
The second vaccination with the MF-59 adjuvanted formulations increased the GMT titers obtained 
after the first vaccination, which gives support for the 2-dose schedule in influenza vaccine naïve 
subjects.  
In conclusion, results from trial V104P2 provides clear support for the using the MF59 adjuvant, and a 
2-dose-schedule.  
Pivotal clinical study 
Overall, the study design (V118_05) was in agreement with a CHMP Scientific advice and it was 
considered adequate. Importantly, as stated in the current CHMP guideline on influenza vaccines, 
clinical efficacy for children 6 to 36 months of age was to be demonstrated against laboratory 
confirmed influenza disease.  
The study (V118_05) was a randomised, active controlled observer blind study. Due to difference in 
appearance of the study vaccines, as well as the unavailability of a 0.25 mL pre-filled syringe 
formulation for aQIV in Study V118_05, this study was conducted under observer-blind conditions. The 
fact that the pivotal trial was not a double-blinded trial is acceptable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 128/194 
 
 
 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered adequate. In fact, most of the subjects enrolled in 
the trial were healthy children. Subjects being at high risk of complications from influenza (like 
subjects with asthma, chronic lung disease, heart disease, kidney or liver disorders, etc.) were not 
excluded in this CT. This approach is considered adequate since across European Union Countries there 
is a general recommendation for vaccinating this risk group.  
The vaccine strain composition for the aQIV was unchanged between Seasons 1 and 2, and contained 
the strain composition recommended for the Northern Hemisphere. 
For Season 1, aQIV was compared to TIV-1, and for Season 2, QIV-1 was used as a comparator. The 
use of a trivalent comparator at the time of study initiation was due to the fact that the QIV-1 
comparator was only recently licensed for use in the US and not available in sufficient quantities.  
A majority (85%) of the subjects were enrolled during Season 2 and the majority of influenza cases 
came from Season 2. Therefore, the inclusion of TIV-1 as the comparator in Season 1 of study 
V118_05 is not considered to have an impact on the overall study outcome.  
Enrolled subjects were randomly assigned to one of 2 study groups (aQIV or non-adjuvanted 
comparator) in ratio of 1:1 with stratification factors as study site, age group (≥6 to <36 months of 
age/ ≥36 to <72 months of age, ratio 1:1), vaccine status (naïve/ non-naïve) and for presence of high 
risk medical condition (at risk/not at risk). This approach is considered adequate to eliminate biases 
that could result from these parameters, particularly form the age and the vaccine status.  
The definition of the different populations for the assessment of the clinical efficacy and 
immunogenicity are considered appropriate. The immunogenicity subset was to contain all subjects 
enrolled in season 1 and from the first 4,000 subjects enrolled in season 2 a subset of 1,780 subjects 
would be included.  
The primary measure of efficacy was the estimate of rVE of aQIV relative to non-adjuvanted 
comparator for preventing first-occurrence RT-PCR-confirmed influenza disease caused by influenza 
strains related to those contained in aQIV and non-adjuvanted comparator in children ≥6 to <72 
months of age, for ILI cases occurring at ≥21 days and ≤ 180 days after the last vaccination or until 
the end of the influenza season, whichever was longer. This as well as the ILI definition applied can be 
considered appropriate since the primary endpoint is clinically relevant. 
During the procedure, the Applicant presented then data showing the relative vaccine efficacy by age 
subgroup (≥6 to <12 months, ≥12 to <24 months, and ≥24 to <36 months). The rVE of aQIV is 
similar in subjects 6 to <12 months and ≥12 to <24 months of age (35.76% and 28.83%, 
respectively). CHMP concluded that from the data provided it was however clear that none of these rVE 
estimates were statistically significant. Most of the influenza cases in the age group ≥6 to <24 months 
were due to H3 strains, which were unmatched to the vaccine H3 component.  
All swab samples from ILI cases were also cultured for the growth of the clinical strain of influenza 
obtained from these subjects, to allow for antigenic characterization. i.e., determining whether the 
clinical isolate is antigenically matched or antigenically unmatched to the vaccine strain. This 
information was then used to calculate vaccine efficacy according to the antigenic match to the vaccine 
strain. This approach is considered appropriate. 
From a statistical perspective, the interpretation of the analyses on the efficacy secondary objectives is 
not considered adequate (see further discussion below). Due to the numerous analyses with the same 
level of alpha (5%) is highly probable that it has caused a multiplicity problem.  
Overall, the immunogenicity endpoints are considered adequate and are in line with the requirements 
of section 6.1.2 of the current CHMP guideline on influenza vaccines (EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014). 
The immunogenicity objectives aimed at showing non-inferiority/ superiority of HI antibody responses 
Assessment report

Page 129/194 
 
 
 
of aQIV vs TIV/QIV against each of the influenza strains are relevant to assess the effect of the MF-59 
adjuvant and to help understanding the clinical efficacy data. These analyses were performed 
measuring the effect in terms of GMTs and SC rates, which are considered relevant parameters. 
The statistical methods to assess immunogenicity objectives are considered adequate. The non-
inferiority and superiority margins used for ratio of GMTs and differences in SC rates are commonly 
used in influenza vaccines, and are described in the CBER guideline “guidance on Seasonal Influenza 
Vaccines May 2007)”. These margins are considered adequate.  
One of the secondary objectives is the evaluation of the antibody response according to the Center for 
Biologics Evaluation, Research, and Review (CBER) criteria (2007). This analysis is considered 
informative but not critical for the immunogenicity assessment of the vaccine.  
The secondary objectives related to Healthcare Utilization and Health Economic Outcomes, are not 
considered critical for the risk/benefit analysis of this vaccine. 
No relevant amendments were made to the original protocol.  
Conduct of the study 
Practically all subjects enrolled were exposed to the vaccine. Approximately 15% of the exposed 
subjects did not complete the protocol. Although this figure is relatively high, it was similar in both 
arms. Moreover, the reasons for discontinuation were similar in the aQIV and the comparator group, 
being the most important lost to follow-up [around 4.6%] subjects) and enrollment in the V118_05E1 
study (4.3%] subjects). Analyses of these data did not show any indication of selective discontinuation 
for safety reasons.  
The study was conducted in 9 countries, including several European countries, being most of the 
subjects recruited in USA. Subjects from tropical countries were also recruited. As detailed below, no 
difference by race and ethnicity was observed upon subgroup analysis. It is thus considered that the 
data obtained from this population can be extrapolated to the EU population  
All baseline characteristics in efficacy and immunogenicity sets well balanced between the two arms. A 
similar conclusion was reached when baseline characteristics were analysed according to other 
parameters such as baseline HI titer, age, naivety, risk, gender and by season. Of interest, 8.7% of 
enrolled subjects were considered at high risk of influenza complication.  
A substantial proportion of vaccine naïve subjects had antibody HI titres ≥1:10 and 1:40 at baseline 
(variable for strains), reflecting that this is not an influenza naïve group but a vaccine naïve group. 
Within the responses to D120 LoQ, the Applicant submitted these data by age group (6-24 m, 24-36 
m, 36-72 m). 
Clinical efficacy Results 
The primary endpoint aimed at demonstrating a difference in rVE between aQIV and the comparator 
vaccine group was not met in subjects ≥6 to <72 months of age in the FAS, since the pre-specified 
statistical criterion (LL of the 2-sided 95% CI for the rVE >0%) of the rVE estimate was <0 (rVE -0.67 
[95% CI: -19.81; 15.41]). A similar result was obtained in the PPS. It is considered that this result 
precludes granting a marketing authorization for subjects ≥6 to <72 months of age.  
The Company has performed secondary efficacy analyses that include a large number of comparisons 
assessing rVE in a number of subgroups.  
Before discussing on these secondary efficacy analysis it is important to mention that most of the 
influenza cases detected in the trial (396 of the 508) (78%) were caused by an H3 virus and that 95% 
of these H3 cases were due to strains antigenically unmatched to the H3 vaccine component of the 
Assessment report

vaccine. In fact, from 56% of RT-PCR confirmed influenza cases it was possible to isolate the virus in 
cell culture and then analyse whether the virus was antigenically matched or unmatched to the viral 
antigens present in the vaccine. As shown above (in section Relative Vaccine Efficacy: Culture-
Confirmed Influenza), the original MAA included two different analyses and it is clear now that there 
was a problem with the serological assay used by one of the labs that performed the testing so that 
many true unmatched H3 strains were erroneously classified as matched strains. Thus, the data that 
reflect the situation of trial V118_05 are those described in the previous section, which indicates that 
only 5% of H3 influenza cases observed in the CT V118_05 matched the H3 component of the vaccine. 
The CT V118_05 was conducted during two seasons (2013/2014 NH and 2014/2015 NH, with over 
85% of the subjects enrolled during the second season) and that 98% influenza cases were reported 
during the second 2014/2015 NH influenza season. The observation that most of H3 cases in trial 
V118_05 were antigenically different from the vaccine component was in agreement with the 
epidemiological data gathered from that season.  
It is important to note that due to major mismatch for the predominant A/H3N2 strain, all 2014/2015 
influenza vaccines exhibited especially low effectiveness in all age groups, including children <6 years 
of age (CDC 2019). Moreover, Zimmerman et al (Clinical Infectious diseases 2016: 6-63) showed that 
in season 2014/15, influenza vaccines offered little protection against the predominant influenza H3N2 
virus since in the USA the adjusted vaccine efficacy against H3-associated illness was 6% (95CI, -5% 
to 17%). As discussed below, most likely, both vaccines in trial V118_05 showed the same lack of 
efficacy. 
All these issues have important implications regarding the usefulness of trial V118_05 to assess the 
rVE of Fluad Tetra vs the non-adjuvanted comparator. 
The secondary efficacy comparisons made were: 
1) For the age group ≥6 to <72 months of age:  
-  According to RT-PCR-Confirmed Influenza by strain 
-  According to Culture-Confirmed Influenza by strain.  
-  According to Prior Vaccination Status (two analyses: RT-PCR- and cell culture Confirmed 
influenza cases) 
-  According to Risk status (two analyses: RT-PCR- and cell culture -Confirmed cases) 
-  According to season (two analyses: RT-PCR- and cell culture Confirmed cases). 
2) In different age groups. The four age subgroups chosen were: ≥6 to <36 months, ≥36 to <72 
months age group; ≥6 to <24 months and ≥24 to <72 months. For each group, rVE was calculated: 
-  According to RT-PCR -Confirmed Influenza  
-  According to cell-culture confirmed influenza (all, matched and unmatched strains) 
3) Additional secondary analyses were performed according to what the Company consider to be “early 
efficacy”, i.e. 
- 
assessing rVE in vaccine naïve subjects for two periods of time: ≥7 and ≥14 days after first 
and up to second vaccination. It is important to mention that the second vaccination was given 
at day 28. So in fact, rVE is being measured for a very short period of time, for only 14 or 21 
days. 
- 
assessing rVE in all subjects for two periods of time: ≥7 and <21 days after last vaccination 
and for ≥7 and <180 days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 131/194 
 
 
 
For the analyses performed with cell culture confirmed cases, additional calculations of rVE were made 
depending on whether the isolated viral strains were matched or not to the vaccine strains. Moreover, 
for all of the analyses indicated above, calculation of rVE was made in relation to cases caused by “any 
influenza strain” and by each of the four individual viral components (H1, H3 and the two B strains). 
Thus, in total more than 200 secondary calculations of rVE were made. All these rVE calculations used 
the same alpha (5%) error.  
Assessment of these secondary analyses would have been very relevant in case the primary efficacy 
objective had been met. In that case, the secondary analyses could have provided clues on the 
particular subgroups or factors that were responsible for the better efficacy of the aQIV vs the non-
adjuvanted comparator. However, since the primary efficacy endpoint was not met, it is complicated to 
infer any solid conclusion to support granting a marketing authorization from these secondary efficacy 
analyses. In fact, according to the Guideline on the investigation of subgroups in confirmatory clinical 
trials (EMA/CHMP/539146/2013) “the use of a subgroup to rescue a trial that has formally failed…from 
a formal statistical point of view, no further confirmatory conclusions are possible in a clinical trial 
where the primary null hypothesis cannot be rejected”, accordingly, from a regulatory perspective, the 
post hoc analyses proposed by the Applicant are not valid to rescue the trial. Once the superiority for 
the primary objective is not met, there is no possibility to spend alpha in any subgroup analysis.  
Based on the RT-PCR confirmed cases, it was observed that most of the cases were due to H3N2 
viruses (396 cases out of 515). No difference in rVE between aQIV and comparator was demonstrated 
for the RT-PCR-confirmed A/H3N2 and B strains in subjects ≥6 to <72 months of age, and only a 
marginally better rVE than comparator vaccine was seen against the RT-PCR-confirmed A/H1N1 
strains; rVE: 59.39 (95% CI: 2.06; 83.16).  
395 out of the 396 H3 cases occurred in the second season, in which the circulating strain was 
antigenically different from that of the vaccine. As discussed below, data from the trial showed that rVE 
for H3 unmatched strains was not statistically significant [3.14 (95%CI: -30.61; 28.17)], which most 
likely is a consequence of none of the two vaccines being efficacious against this H3 antigenic variant. 
So, of the 395 H3 cases in season 2 (and according to the serological characterization of cases), it is 
expected that 95% of them (375 cases) were unmatched to the vaccine. As indicated above, no clinical 
protection against H3 cases it is expected to be provided by the vaccine, and thus if these H3 cases 
were excluded from the primary objective analyses, the total number of cases observed in the trial 
would be 133 cases (508 minus 375). It is important to highlight that this figure is much lower than 
the minimum number of 323 cases that was needed (according to the clinical statistical plan: sample 
size and Power Considerations of Primary Objectives in section 9.7.2 of the CSR) to be able to evaluate 
the primary objective. In fact, the Company states: “In the situation when the dominant circulating 
influenza strains have a major antigenic difference with the vaccine strain, resulting in a low vaccine 
efficacy, it is not possible to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in clinical efficacy between 
adjuvanted influenza vaccine and comparator and meet the prespecified success criteria for the 
primary endpoint.” 
Thus, in conclusion, and in agreement with the Applicant, the fact that most of the influenza cases 
observed during the trial were due to an H3 variant antigenically different from the vaccine component 
makes it “not possible to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in clinical efficacy between 
adjuvanted influenza vaccine and comparator”. Thus, it is considered that the data from the trial are 
inconclusive and thus they cannot serve as a support for granting a paediatric indication. 
Immunogenicity Results 
In terms of immunogenicity, aQIV elicited a robust postvaccination immunogenic response against all 4 
strains contained in the vaccine which met CBER’s immunogenicity criteria. Moreover aQIV elicited a 
superior immunogenic response (as reflected by GMT ratio [GMTaQIV/GMTcomparator]), having a 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 132/194 
 
 
 
lower 95% CI limit >1 and SC difference with a lower 95% CI limit >0 for all homologous strains 
tested relative to the comparator vaccine for all prespecified age groups. In fact, the LL of the 2-sided 
95% CI of the GMTr exceeded 1.5 for all homologous strains.  
In relation to the heterologous immune response, it has been shown that the GMTs for heterologous 
A/H3N2 and the B heterologous strains were higher in aQIV group than in the comparator vaccine 
group at 21 days after the last vaccination. These results do not appear to have any clinical relevance 
in terms of protection of clinical disease since rVE was not superior for unmatched strains.  
A number of subgroup analyses was also performed regarding age, dose, vaccine naivety, baseline 
serological naivety, risk status, sex, and race. The subgroup analyses immunogenicity results focus on 
a comparison of GMTs and SCRs. Overall, in all comparisons the aQIV group had higher GMT values, 
SCRs, and percentages of subjects with HI titer ≥1:40 than the comparator group after the first (non-
naïve) and second vaccinations (naïve).  
The GMTr was higher in the ≥6 to <36 months age group (ranging from 2.08 to 2.58) than in the ≥36 
to <72 months age group (ranging from 1.33 to 1.94) for all homologous strains at 21 days after last 
vaccination. The GMTr was higher in the ≥6 to <24 months age group (ranging from 2.48 for the 
homologous A/H3N2 to 3.72 for homologous B/Victoria) than in the 24 to <72 months age group 
(ranging from 1.47 for homologous A/H3N2 to 1.77 for homologous B/Yamagata) at 21 days after last 
vaccination. This suggests a potential greater benefit of the adjuvant in younger children. Similarly, 
greater GMT ratios were seen in vaccine naïve subjects as compared to vaccine non-naïve subjects, as 
well as in subjects who had pre-vaccination titres <1:40 as compared to those with pre-vaccination 
titres ≥1:40. This could suggest that aQIV induces a better priming response as compared to non-
adjuvanted influenza vaccines, which would be in line with the purported advantages of the MF59 
adjuvant.  
In relation to the dose used, aQIV elicited a superior immunogenic response for all homologous strains 
tested relative to the comparator vaccine for both groups of 0.25 mL dose and 0.5 mL dose.  
Data on long-term persistence of the antibodies showed that the greater immunogenicity of aQIV 
relative to the comparator vaccine in subjects 6 to <72 months of age was also evident at 180 days 
after the last vaccination in Study V118_05. 
In addition to HI responses, the immune response was also determined with a microneutralisation 
(MN) assay and were reported for the A/H3N2 strain and B/Yamagata strain, with superior responses 
in the aQIV group compared. The MN results for the A/H3N2 strain and the B/Yamagata strain appear 
to follow the same patters as the HI results.  
Immune response upon revaccination 
Two studies measured the immune response after revaccination (V118_05E1 and V118_05E3). 
Subjects recruited for these studies were a subset of those included in the pivotal trial V118_05. After 
Season 1 of trial V118_05, some subjects were invited to enroll in revaccination study V118_05E1. 
Similarly, after Season 2, some subjects were invited to enroll in revaccination study V118_05E3. 
In study V118_05E1 subjects received the same influenza vaccine and the same strains as 
administered in the pivotal study, i.e., aQIV or licensed nonadjuvanted comparator influenza vaccine. 
In study V118_05E3 subjects were re-randomized to receive the same or different quadrivalent 
vaccine type (adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted) from what they had received in Study V118_05, which 
resulted in 4 treatment groups (aQIV/aQIV; aQIV/QIV-1; QIV-1/aQIV; QIV-1/QIV-1). 
The immune response was measured by three assays: HI, microneutralization (MN) and anti-
Neuraminidase antibodies. Overall, the results from the three assays were in the same line and showed 
that: 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 133/194 
 
 
 
-  Baseline titers were generally higher for subjects that received aQIV than the non adjuvanted 
comparator. This has already been described above in this assessment report in section 
“persistence of immune response” 
- 
In general, there were similar antibody titers in the aQIV/aQIV, aQIV/QIV-1, and QIV-1/aQIV 
groups and these titers were higher compared with the repeated nonadjuvanted group. It is 
mentioned that this conclusion was observed in most cases, but there were some exceptions 
depending on the strains and the assay used. 
In conclusion, the results from these studies showed an adequate immune response following the 
revaccination of subjects that received aQIV, both when revaccinated with aQIV or with a non 
adjuvanted vaccine.  
The results show that although the GMTs and GMRs are higher for all strains when vaccinated with 
aQIV two years in a row as compared to being vaccinated with aQIV and subsequently with QIV, the 
differences is not substantial. As such, immunological benefits of annual revaccination with aQIV is not 
firmly established within study V118_05E3.  
It is agreed with the Applicant that altogether, the supportive studies with aTIV showed that 
vaccination with aTIV produces a robust immune response (in terms of GMTs, and SCRs) which is 
higher compared to nonadjuvanted influenza vaccines. These results provide additional support for the 
role of MF59 as an adjuvant. Importantly, the results are broadly in line with the immunogenicity data 
obtained with the aQIV. 
2.5.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy (paediatric indication) 
Overall, the study design of the pivotal efficacy trial V118_05 was in agreement with a CHMP Scientific 
advice and it was considered adequate.  
In terms of immunogenicity, it is shown that aQIV elicited a superior immunogenic response (as 
reflected by GMT ratio [GMTaQIV/GMTcomparator]), having a lower 95% CI limit >1 and SC difference 
with a lower 95% CI limit >0 for all homologous strains tested relative to the comparator vaccine for 
all prespecified age groups.  
Nonetheless, this superior immunogenicity of aQIV does not translate into a better vaccine efficacy 
since the primary endpoint aimed at demonstrating a difference in rVE between aQIV and the 
comparator vaccine group was not met in subjects ≥6 to <72 months of age in the FAS, since the pre-
specified statistical criterion (LL of the 2-sided 95% CI for the rVE >0%) of the rVE estimate was <0 
(rVE -0.67 [95% CI: -19.81; 15.41]). A similar result was obtained in the PPS.  
Since the primary efficacy endpoint was not met, it is complicated to infer any solid conclusion to 
support granting a marketing authorization from these secondary efficacy analyses. In fact, according 
to the Guideline on the investigation of subgroups in confirmatory clinical trials 
(EMA/CHMP/539146/2013) “the use of a subgroup to rescue a trial that has formally failed…from a 
formal statistical point of view, no further confirmatory conclusions are possible in a clinical trial where 
the primary null hypothesis cannot be rejected”, accordingly, from a regulatory perspective, the 
secondary analyses proposed by the Applicant are not acceptable. 
It is considered that this result precludes granting a marketing authorization for the paediatric subjects 
≥6 to <72 months of age.  
The Applicant withdrew the paediatric indication during the procedure.

2.5.8.  Discussion on clinical efficacy (elderly population)  
Adjuvanted Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (aQIV) is a seasonal, surface antigen, inactivated influenza 
vaccine, adjuvanted with MF59C.1 (MF59). The manufacturing process, dose and formulation of aQIV 
and Fluad (EU authorized adjuvanted Trivalent Influenza Vaccine, aTIV) are the same, with the 
exception of an additional B strain included in aQIV. aTIV is authorised in many EU countries since 
1997 and it is indicated for subjects >65 years of age. 
This vaccine contains the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigen from four egg-grown viral strains, and 
the adjuvant MF-59. The dose of 15 μg HA (in 0.5 ml) per viral strain (in 0.5 mL) is in agreement with 
the Eur. Ph. requirements and is also the one used in all approved trivalent or quadrivalent inactivated 
influenza vaccines marketed in the EU. Thus, this dosage of HA is considered adequate.  
It is also considered adequate that the selection of influenza viral strains in each formulation of aQIV 
and aTIV has been/will be done following the WHO annual (seasonal) recommendations.  
Vaccine Dose and Schedule  
The vaccine dose and dosing schedule of aQIV and aTIV are considered appropriate. They are based on 
those of licensed influenza vaccines and pertinent data from ranging dose clinical studies V104P3 and 
V7P38.  
Assays supporting immunogenicity assessment 
Overall the assays performed to support the Immunogenicity assessment are considered adequate. 
During assessment several topics were additionally justified.  
The use of the Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) assay as the primary assay to assess vaccine 
immunogenicity of the vaccine in CTs is in line with the recommendations of the Guideline on Influenza 
Vaccines (EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014). However, it should be noted that even when several studies 
of influenza infection have indicated that HI antibody titres of 1:40 or greater are associated with 
protection from influenza illness, HI titers are not a true surrogate marker in the sense that there is 
not an accepted cut-off titer that defines clinical protection. The validation report provided in relation 
to the HI test performed by the different labs is considered adequate. The applicant compares HI titers 
in terms of GMTs and that is agreeable. Similarly, the definition of Seroconversion rate (defined as the 
percentage of subjects achieving either: 1) a prevaccination (baseline) HI titer <1:10 and 
postvaccination HI titer ≥1:40 after vaccination; or 2) a prevaccination (baseline) HI titer ≥1:10 and a 
≥4-fold increase in postvaccination HI titer) is also considered appropriate. 
The burden of influenza disproportionately falls on individuals <5 years of age and ≥65 years of age. 
The higher burden of influenza among older adults relative to younger adults is in part related to the 
age-related decline of the immune response (immunosenescence), which increases their susceptibility 
to influenza and risk of serious complications, leading to increased influenza related hospitalizations 
and deaths. Influenza also contributes substantially to the mortality rate among ≥65 years of age.  
The clinical development program of Fluad Tetra to support the indication for subjects ≥ 65 years of 
age is based on the assumption that aQIV, which is manufactured and formulated in the same way as 
aTIV (Fluad) with the exception of the additional B strain included in aQIV, is safe and will lead to 
protection against influenza disease as demonstrated previously for aTIV, with the additional benefit of 
protection against both B strains. It should be noted that Fluad was approved in Italy in 1997 and 
subsequently in other EU countries, US and Australia and that more than 102 million doses have been 
distributed worldwide, mostly for use in older adults.  
According to the CHMP Guideline on Influenza Vaccines (Non-clinical and Clinical Module), the main 
requirement for a (new) adjuvanted surface antigen vaccine in the elderly is to demonstrate an 
Assessment report

advantage in terms of immune responses, which may be based on superior immunogenicity vs a non-
adjuvanted but otherwise comparable authorised vaccine.  
An advantage for the adjuvanted vs. non-adjuvanted formulation could include a higher seroconversion 
rate, higher antibody titres (based on GMTs or proportions reaching a predefined cut-off titre) or other 
immune response parameters, including increased breadth or duration of response.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies  
The clinical development plan (CDP) for Fluad Tetra to support the indication for subjects ≥ 65 years, 
is found acceptable and it is based on a pivotal trial with aQIV (V118_20), which evaluated that the 
second B strain elicited an antibody response and that it did not interfere in the immunogenicity 
elicited by the other three strains. Additionally, there is another pivotal study (V70_27) aimed at 
demonstrating the advantage of the inclusion of the adjuvant, comparing aTIV versus TIV. Additionally, 
a supportive absolute efficacy study (V118_18) and several supportive studies with aTIV. Also, two 
effectiveness studies are presented carried out with aTIV.  
Dose-finding studies 
These studies were all performed with aTIV. The two dose-ranging studies V104P3 and V7P38 
evaluated the effect of various antigen and MF59 dose levels on immune response to aTIV using a 
validated HI assay. Overall studies V104P3 and V7P38 are considered well designed and performed. 
These trials provided clear support for the use of the proposed HA dose and MF59 adjuvant in elderly 
population, since all MF59 adjuvanted formulations induced statistically superior antibody responses 
compared to a nonadjuvanted vaccine.  
Pivotal study V70_27  
Study V70_27 is a randomized observer-blind, controlled multicentre study conducted in the 
2010/2011 season in the USA, Philippines, Colombia, and Panama. The immunogenicity of aTIV was 
compared to TIV in terms of the HI response against homologous strains (vaccine strains) and against 
heterologous strains to determine breadth of immune response. Persistence (duration) was also 
measured 6 and 12 months after vaccination.  
In study (V70_27), the first (lot-to-lot consistency) and third (noninferiority according to CHMP 
criteria) co-primary objectives were met. Regarding the second co-primary objective, noninferiority of 
aTIV relative to TIV was demonstrated against the 3 homologous influenza strains according to CBER 
criteria, but superiority of aTIV to TIV for at least 2 homologous strains was not demonstrated. In a 
posthoc analysis, it was shown that aTIV elicited significantly higher GMT levels and SCR than TIV 
against all 3 homologous strains, demonstrating the benefit of the MF-59 adjuvant in subjects ≥65 
years of age. 
The design of the study is considered appropriate. The HI response was expressed as GMT ratio’s 
(aTIV/TIV) and SCR differences (aTIV-TIV) at day 22, three weeks after vaccination. Persistence 
(duration) was also measured 6 and 12 months after vaccination (D181, 366). These endpoints are 
considered relevant and are agreed for the determining whether there is an immunological advantage 
of the adjuvant. Effectiveness, i.e. the relative rate of influenza like illness between the two groups, 
was also determined however no laboratory confirmation of ILI cases was performed therefore these 
analyses are of limited value. The protocol prespecified that superiority could be concluded if the LL of 
the 95% CI around the GMTratio (aTIV/TIV) was >1.5 and the LL of the 95% CI around the SCR 
difference was >10%. Note superiority margins were 1 and 0% for GMT ratio’s and SCR difference in 
study V118_20.

Overall, responses are relatively consistent between the different age cohorts, keeping in mind the 
relatively wide CIs in particular in the oldest age group due to a small number of subjects. 
Randomisation was stratified by age with 65 to 74 years versus ≥75 years, and this is considered 
acceptable.  
The 7 supportive studies that compare immune response following aTIV versus TIV vaccination show a 
generally higher antibody response with the adjuvanted vaccine. Therefore, all these data are in the 
same line than those observed in the pivotal aQIV study V118_20 and both sets of data show that the 
adjuvanted vaccine is more immunogenic than the non-adjuvanted comparator.  
The approval of the aTIV was based on its better immunogenicity as compared to a non-adjuvanted 
vaccine, taking into account that the slightly higher reactogenicity of aTIV compared to TIV did not 
significantly alter the B/R of aTIV compared to TIV. The better protection of adjuvanted vaccines 
versus non-adjuvanted vaccines is inferred by the higher antibody response that they trigger, but as 
commented before there is no true immunological marker that correlates with protection against the 
influenza disease. It should be kept in mind that there is no demonstration that immunogenicity is a 
valid surrogate measure for efficacy.  
Pivotal study (V70_27) evaluated antibody persistence at 6 and 12 months after vaccination, in 
homologous and heterologous strains. In all tested strains, only A/H3N2 demonstrated a statistically 
significant difference in GMT ratio comparing aTIV with TIV at 6 and 12 months. No strong conclusion 
can be made of a better persistence of antibodies for the adjuvanted vaccine as compared to that of 
the non-adjuvanted vaccine.  
Regarding the revaccination studies, in general the results show that the immunogenicity elicited by 
the successive administration of the aTIV is in many cases higher than with the TIV, but in any case 
always non-inferior. These are adequate results for a vaccine that is intended to be administered 
annually to its target population.  
Pivotal study V118_20 
Pivotal aQIV study V118_20 was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled, parallel-
group, multicentre study conducted in 2017/2018, in which the immunogenicity of aQIV is compared to 
two aTIVs (aTIV-1, aTIV-2), each containing one of the two B strains contained in aQIV. The main 
objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of the immune response to aQIV to that of aTIV-1, 
containing the B-Vic strain, and aTIV-2, containing the B Yam strain based upon the GMT ratio and 
SCR.  
The design of study V118_20 is found appropriate as it is in line with the CHMP Guideline on influenza 
vaccines, Non-clinical and Clinical module.  
As stated by the Applicant, study V118_20 enrolled 1778 subjects in total, 771 (43.4%) male and 
1007 (56.6%) female ≥65 years old. Although there is an imbalance in the gender of the enrolled 
participants, the applicant has justified that this is consistent with the population demographics in the 
US, where the study was carried out.  
Most common medical conditions are well balanced between the study arms. In study V118_20 high-
risk subjects had 1 or more of the following predefined comorbidities, with no substantive differences 
between vaccine groups: congestive heart failure (6%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; 
13% to 14%), asthma (12%), hepatic diseases (<1% to 1%), renal insufficiency (4% to 5%), and the 
most commonly reported neurological/neuromuscular or metabolic conditions including diabetes 
mellitus (82% to 83%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 137/194 
 
 
 
The applicant stratified the response by sex (male, female), and by previous vaccination history and 
found no notable differences between the aQIV group and the aTIV groups. For subjects without 
vaccination history seroconversion rates appear to be higher for all four strains for the aQIV as well as 
the aTIV groups. The applicant has also analysed the data for subjects with pre-existing comorbidities 
at risk of severe influenza versus subjects without pre-existing comorbidities at risk of complications 
after influenza, and these seem to respond in a similar way to the vaccine. 
Apart from the issues that have been mentioned above, the study inclusion and exclusion criteria are 
considered adequate.  
Study V118_20 was conducted entirely in the US and during one influenza season (2017-2018). Study 
participants received one single vaccination. One of the two vaccines used as comparators in the study 
(aTIV-1) was a commercial vaccine (Fluad) and the other one (aTIV-2) was only formulated for the 
V118_20 study, since it contained the alternate B strain that was contained in the aQIV vaccine but not 
present in Fluad. The three vaccines used as treatment in this study are acceptable.  
The co-primary objectives, to demonstrate non-inferiority of aQIV in comparison to the aTIV vaccines 
with the two alternate B strains and to assess the immunogenicity in accordance to the CBER criteria, 
are considered adequate. Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that the CBER criteria are presented 
in order to comply with FDA requirements, but do not apply to the EU requirements.  
Regarding the secondary immunogenicity objectives, to characterize the immunogenicity of aQIV, 
aTIV-1 and aTIV-2 and to demonstrate superiority of aQIV for the B strain that is not included in the 
corresponding aTIV, are also found to be acceptable.  
The co-primary and secondary endpoints are clearly defined and have clinical relevance. The 
immunogenicity and safety endpoints are adequate and are in line with the requirements of the current 
CHMP guideline on influenza vaccines (EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014) and in line with the Center for 
Biologics Evaluation, Research and Review (CBER) criteria (2007).  
The randomization was carried out without any stratification by age, comorbidities or any other 
criteria, although an analysis of the results is carried out taking these subgroups into account. The 
CHMP guideline on influenza vaccines (EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014) recommends that the elderly 
population is stratified by age, and highlights that every effort should be made to enroll a 
representative sample of subjects above 75 years of age and to stratify according to age. It would 
have been optimal to randomize taking the age of the subjects into consideration, in order to have a 
representative number of subjects from each age subgroup (65-74, 75-84 and ≥85 years of age). The 
Applicant explains the imbalance between the age strata for subjects enrolled in study V118_20 by 
showing that this imbalance reflects the US population demographics for the 65-74 and the 75-84 age 
groups. This is not the case in the ≥85 age group, in which the proportion of the V118_20 study 
population is much smaller than in the US resident population. This discrepancy is explained by the 
great number of medical conditions in this group that lead to the exclusion from the enrollment for the 
study. 
Regarding the sets defined for the study analyses, the five populations were well defined and are found 
acceptable. Also, the subgroups that will be analyzed and the statistical methods to assess the 
immunogenicity objectives are adequate for the type of vaccine and kind of population.  
Practically all subjects enrolled were exposed to the vaccine. Only 1-2% of the exposed subjects did 
not complete the study protocol. The reasons for discontinuation are similar in the three arms. There 
are no notable differences in the proportion of subjects excluded from the PPS Immunogenicity 
between all groups.

Taking into consideration the particularities of influenza vaccines (their seasonal variability, the fact 
that the vaccine strain does not always match with the circulating viruses, etc.) to conduct the study in 
only one season is considered adequate. Additionally, it is considered that the race and ethnicity of the 
US population that has participated in the study can be extrapolated to the EU population. Therefore, 
the recruitment of the study is acceptable.  
Regarding the subject distribution, the imbalance in the gender has been explained as it reflects US 
demographics for that age group. The rest of the demographic and baseline characteristics are either 
well balanced or easily explained.  
Regarding the medical history and concomitant medication, having in mind the advanced age of the 
subjects in this study and that the study participants included subjects with comorbidities that 
increased their risk of complications from influenza infection, it is expected that many (97.7%) of the 
participants had at least one disorder in medical history. Concomitant medications have been recorded 
in the Concomitant Medication case report form (CRF), and in case it would be necessary, this 
information could be used to interpret a possible effect in the clinical study results. The percentages of 
subjects taking one or more concomitant medications were similar (aQIV, 93.6%; aTIV-1, 92.1%, 
aTIV-2, 94.8%. Additionally, the proportions of each of the medications taken by >5% of subjects 
across vaccine groups were, in general, relatively similar. 
In study V118_20, the first co-primary objective (to demonstrate non-inferiority of aQIV as compared 
to aTIV-1 and aTIV-2 in terms of GMT ratios and differences in SC rates), was met for all four strains. 
The second co-primary objective (to demonstrate adequate immunogenicity according to CBER criteria) 
was met for the two A strains but not for the two B strains). The fact that the CBER criteria are not 
met for the B strains does not preclude granting a marketing authorization, since the current CHMP 
guideline for the clinical assessment of influenza vaccines to be used in the EU does not require these 
criteria to be achieved. Moreover, it is noted that the previous CHMP criteria required for annual update 
of influenza vaccines were similar to those from CBER, and it was common to have the same situation 
described here, i.e., not all three criteria were met. In fact, for annual update, it was required to meet 
only one of the three criteria.  
All of the secondary objectives were met, both in the PPS population and in the FAS population. 
Importantly, immunologic superiority of aQIV relative to aTIV for the alternate B strain was met. 
Consistently in all of the secondary outcomes, the obtained results tended to be higher for the A 
strains (A-H3N2 and A-H1N1) than for the B strains, but always inside the margins established for 
success.  
It should be noted that the immunogenicity was only measured for the homologous strains. Immune 
response against heterologous strains has not been assessed in this study. As mentioned above, the 
applicant has stated that response against heterologous strains was not assessed in study V118_20 for 
aQIV because in their opinion sufficient data from aTIV studies was already available. Regarding the 
subgroup analyses, they were carried out, by age, gender, race, comorbidity, and vaccination history 
for each influenza vaccine strain for percentages of subjects with HI titer ≥1:40, GMTs, GMRs, and 
seroconversion rates. Overall, there were no significant differences in the obtained results in this 
subgroup assessment.  
Nevertheless, some differences in the immune response were observed when subjects were stratified 
by age (age subgroups 65-74, 75-84 and ≥85 years), with an inferior lower immune response in the 
more elderly group (≥ 85 years), which can be explained by the immunosenescence that affects 
subjects more as they are older. Another difference that can be underlined is the one observed 
between subgroups with a different comorbidity risk score. Those subjects with a high risk of 
complications after an influenza infection had a lower immune response than those at low risk of 
complications. This could be an expected result if the high-risk factor was in some way correlated with 
Assessment report

a weaker immune system, but this is unknown. The differences are not very large. And finally, in the 
subgroups made by vaccination history, the results show that subjects that have not been vaccinated 
against influenza in the last 5 years tended to have a higher GMR and SCR than subjects with a recent 
history of vaccination. This is a common situation observed for influenza vaccines and relates to the 
fact that the baseline of those previously vaccinated tends to be higher than those not vaccinated 
previously and thus the ratio of titres (in terms of GMT and SC rates) pre and post vaccination tend to 
be higher in those not previously vaccinated.  
All the observed results by subgroup analysis are found acceptable and respond to the particularities of 
the subjects enrolled in this study, which is a population with an age and comorbidities that have a 
strong influence in the immune response.  
Supportive study V118_18 
The applicant has submitted the Clinical Study Report of a Phase 3 absolute efficacy study (V118_18) 
to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of aQIV compared to a non-influenza vaccine 
comparator in subjects ≥65 years of age.  
The results of study V118_18 were not submitted at the time of initiating this MAA since they were not 
available at that time. In response to the D120 LoQ, the Applicant submitted the CSR for this study.  
The goal of this study was to demonstrate that Fluad Tetra prevents influenza in elderly adults. Direct 
comparison with a non-influenza comparator vaccine (Boostrix) licensed for use in elderly adults, 
enabled an estimation of the absolute efficacy of aQIV in preventing influenza in elderly adults. 
The design of study V118_18 was discussed in a previous CHMP Scientific Advice 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/404125/2016). As indicated in the CHMP report to this SA, the overall design of the 
study was considered acceptable. As it was indicated in the report, the trial should be conducted in 
regions in which vaccination of the elderly is not part of the routine immunization program. The 
Applicant has conducted the study in countries that either do not have a national recommendation 
regarding seasonal influenza vaccination in elderly patients or where the rates of vaccination are 
reported to be significantly below 50%. This is accepted. 
Participants in the study were males and females ≥65 years old who were healthy or had co-
morbidities.  
The primary and secondary efficacy objectives aimed at demonstrating absolute VE of Fluad Tetra vs a 
non-influenza comparator (based on RT-PCR or cell-culture confirmed cases) are clearly defined and 
have clinical relevance. The efficacy endpoints were analysed using two ILI definitions for influenza 
(protocol-defined ILI and modified CDC ILI definition), but the protocol-definition of ILI was used to 
determine success for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. This ILI definition was wider and 
as shown below captured milder influenza disease. It was also considered adequate that there was a 
secondary objective to characterize the immunogenicity of Fluad Tetra measured according to HI titers.  
The primary efficacy and key secondary efficacy objectives were considered achieved if the lower limit 
(LL) of the adjusted two-sided 95% CI of absolute VE exceeded 40%. This success criterion is 
considered adequate. 
It was planned to randomize 10,692 subjects, 5,346 per vaccine group (Fluad Tetra or Boostrix) but 
the final number of enrolled subjects were 6,790 subjects. There was a significant discrepancy between 
the planned and the actual number of subjects enrolled (10,692, versus 6,790). The Applicant clarifies 
that the statistical power of the proposed analysis only depends on the numbers of RT-PCR confirmed 
influenza cases and not on the numbers of subjects enrolled.

The CHMP guideline on influenza vaccines (EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014) recommends that the 
elderly population is stratified by age, and highlights that every effort should be made to enrol a 
representative sample of subjects above 75 years of age and to stratify according to age. In 
accordance with this requirement randomization was stratified by age (cohorts 65 to 74 years and 75 
years and above).  
It is considered adequate that the Primary VE analysis was based on the FAS Efficacy. Practically all 
subjects enrolled were exposed to the vaccine and only 2.7% of the exposed subjects did not complete 
the study protocol. Overall, the main reasons for exclusion of subjects from the FAS and PPS Efficacy 
Sets were balanced between the vaccine groups.  
The overall demographic and baseline characteristics of subjects in the different sets were well 
balanced between the two vaccine groups with similar age, sex, ethnicity, race, and BMI. However, 
very few subjects (around 2%) were older than 85 years of age. 
Efficacy results 
Using the protocol-defined ILI, the VE against RT-PCR confirmed influenza due to any strain was 
19.80% and the LL of the 97.45% CI was -5.27%. Thus, the primary objective of demonstrating the 
efficacy of aQIV in adults 65 years and above in protecting against any RT-PCR confirmed influenza A 
and/or B diseases was not met since the pre-specified statistical success criterion (the LL of the two-
sided 97.45% CI of VE should exceed 40%) was not satisfied. Similarly, none of the four secondary 
efficacy objectives were met.  
The majority of influenza cases were A/H3N2 strains and most of them (91%) were antigenically 
unmatched to the vaccine strain (112 out of 124 cases based on the protocol-defined ILI). Melidou et 
al (2017; Vaccine 35 4828–4835) analysed the influenza virus that circulated in the World Health 
Organization (WHO) European Region between week 40/2016 to week 5/2017. They showed that H3 
virus were the predominant ones, in agreement with the cases observed from trial V118_18. However, 
Melidou et al found that around 66% of the H3 cases were antigenically similar to the H3 vaccine 
component. The Applicant hypothesized of this discrepancy by the fact that Melidou et al may have 
performed the antigenic typing testing against the cell-propagated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 strain. 
The circulating A/H3N2 strains matched the cell-propagated reference strain but not the egg-
propagated reference strain. The Applicant did not perform studies to confirm this. In addition, it is 
also discussed the fact that Melidou et al could not type one third of the H3 viruses from influenza 
cases whereas this problem was not seen by the Company. The Company considers that this different 
result could have been due to the fact that Meliodou et.al. used an HI analysis whereas the Company 
used a MN assay for antigenic classification. The Applicant did not perform studies to confirm this.  
An observation made in this study was that the clinical criteria used to define influenza-like illness 
appears to have an impact on the estimated efficacy of aQIV. The protocol of the trial specified the 
primary ILI case definition, and the modified CDC ILI. A post-hoc analyses was then performed using 
the standard CDC ILI and WHO ILI definitions. The protocol defined ILI was the most sensitive among 
the different ILI definitions used but with a low specificity. As all cases were confirmed to be influenza 
by RT-PCR, it is likely that this ILI definition captured milder disease, associated with less fever and 
symptomatology. As the specificity of the ILI case definition increased to that of the WHO (the ILI 
definition with the highest specificity- requiring fever ≥38°C), the magnitude of benefit of the aQIV 
vaccine increased. Importantly, VE in all these comparisons did not meet the success criterion for the 
primary endpoint. It is not straightforward to get any conclusion from these analyses using different 
ILI definitions, but overall these results appear to show moderate efficacy against any RT-PCR 
confirmed influenza.

Subgroup analyses by age, comorbidity score, previous vaccination status, smoking status, sex, race 
and country was conducted for the primary and the secondary efficacy endpoints. There were no 
notable subgroup differences in the VE of aQIV observed by age, comorbidity score, previous 
vaccination, smoking status, sex, and race. While there may be some subgroups that tended to show 
higher or lower VE, the CIs were generally overlapping. Other subgroups were too small to draw any 
meaningful conclusions. 
The subgroup analyses made by country revealed that some subgroups have different VEs. In fact, 
some countries the Philippines (62.45% [95% CI: 18.81%, 82.64%]), Latvia (53.44 [-86.91, 88.40]) 
and Estonia (50.94% [95% CI: 6.41%, 74.28%]) showed higher VE estimates than others. It could be 
observed that most confidence intervals were generally overlapping. The study was not designed to 
estimate vaccine efficacy at country level. Nevertheless, the Applicant have carried out an exploratory 
analysis that shows that there is a correlation between the genetic distance of the circulating strains 
compared to the vaccine strains, which is smaller in those countries with a higher VE. The Applicant 
also mention that the circulation of different influenza virus types (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 or B) in each of 
these countries is another possible reason for the observed inter-country differences in vaccine 
efficacy. 
During this procedure, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the aQIV for use in 
adults 65 years of age and older, with a postmarketing requirement to conduct study V118_24, a 
clinical disease endpoint trial in subjects 65 years of age and older with Fluad Quadrivalent (this is the 
tradename of Fluad Tetra in the US). This study is planned be completed in March 31, 2024. Given that 
the efficacy study V118_18 has failed to meet its primary endpoint, the CHMP would benefit from 
reviewing the data derived from this planned study (clinical recommendation). 
Immunogenicity results  
It was shown that Fluad Tetra elicited a robust immune response against all four strains (in terms of 
GMTs and seroprotection rates) contained in the vaccine which met CBER criteria of sufficient 
immunogenicity for this age group. 
Subgroups (age, comorbidity status, previous vaccination, gender, and race) confirmed adequate 
immune response of aQIV in subjects of different age groups (≥ 65-74, ≥ 75-84, ≥ 85 years), 
comorbidity status, previous influenza vaccination history, gender and race. When the analysis was 
done according to previous vaccination status it was found that subjects who were not vaccinated with 
an influenza vaccine in the past 5 years, had lower GMTs at Day 1 for all strains, compared to those 
who were vaccinated. However, at Day 22, post-vaccination GMTs were consistently higher for all 
strains in subjects without previous influenza vaccination in the aQIV group. The GMRs for subjects in 
the aQIV group were consistently higher for all strains in subjects without previous influenza 
vaccination. The Company considers that the higher post vaccination titres observed against B strains 
in subjects without previous influenza vaccination can be explained by the fact that a lower 
postvaccination HI titers may have been reached in subjects receiving repeated annual vaccination 
with unaltered B vaccine strains. This explanation is considered sensible. 
Concomitant administration (aTIV) 
There is currently no data on concomitant administration of Fluad Tetra with other vaccines. 
Effectiveness studies  
The Applicant has presented two effectiveness studies that compare the performance of aTIV versus 
TIV in the real-world situation.  
Study C70P1 was carried out in Italy during three influenza seasons (2006/2007 through 2008/2009). 
The study objectives were to assess the relative risk of hospitalizations for influenza or pneumonia 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 142/194 
 
 
 
during the influenza season amongst subjects ≥65 years of age who received either aTIV or non-
adjuvanted TIV. One important caveat that this study presents is that there is no laboratory 
confirmation of influenza cases. Also, the Applicant explains that in general the health care providers 
administered aTIV to subjects with worse baseline health status than those subjects who received TIV. 
Although the confounding variables have been adjusted to try to avoid biases in the conclusions of the 
study, the reliability of the results from this study is not clear.  
Study V70_49OBTP was carried out in Canada to assess vaccine effectiveness of aTIV versus a 
nonadjuvanted TIV (standard TIV predominantly Fluviral), or no vaccination. In this study there was a 
PCR confirmation of all ILI cases, but very few subjects participated as to have reliable results. Of all 
the subjects, 89% reported at least one chronic disease, but as there were different categories of 
chronic diseases, an adjustment for confounding variables was carried out. After the adjustment, the 
absolute vaccine effectiveness for aTIV was 58% (95% CI: 5%, 82%; P < 0.04) whereas non-
adjuvanted TIV was ineffective compared to no vaccination. The Applicant’s explanation for the non-
effectiveness of the non-adjuvanted TIV is that influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) varies responding 
to complex factors and that in recent years there are multiple examples of IVE estimates showing little 
or no effectiveness, especially for H3N2 strains. Also, for all figures presented from this study the lower 
limit for the confidence intervals are very low (probably due to the low number of participants), and 
thus the results should be considered with caution.  
The Applicant commits to continue to monitor the performance of aQIV during the post-authorisation 
phase by means of an effectiveness study conducted in the context of the DRIVE project, as specified 
in the RMP. 
2.5.9.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy (elderly indication) 
Overall, the study design of the pivotal efficacy trial V118_20 was in agreement with the CHMP 
guideline on influenza vaccines (EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014) and it was considered adequate.  
In terms of immunogenicity, the primary endpoint was met, and showed that aQIV elicited a non-
inferior immune response as compared to aTIV-1 and aTIV-2 in terms of GMT ratios and differences in 
SC rates. Additionally, the secondary endpoint regarding immunologic superiority of aQIV relative to 
aTIV for the alternate B strain was also met. 
The trial V70_27 was also considered adequate. In study (V70_27), the first (lot-to-lot consistency) 
and third (non-inferiority according to CHMP criteria) co-primary objectives were met. Regarding the 
second co-primary objective, non-inferiority of aTIV relative to TIV was demonstrated against the 3 
homologous influenza strains according to CBER criteria, but superiority of aTIV to TIV for at least 2 
homologous strains was not demonstrated. In a posthoc analysis, it was shown that aTIV elicited 
significantly higher GMT levels and SCR than TIV against all 3 homologous strains, demonstrating the 
benefit of the MF-59 adjuvant in subjects ≥65 years of age. 
The immunogenicity of Fluad (trivalent formulation) is relevant to Fluad Tetra because both vaccines 
are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions. 
Regarding absolute efficacy trial V118_18, The pre-specified success criterion to demonstrate VE of 
aQIV against any RT-PCR confirmed influenza cases (primary efficacy objective) was not met as the LL 
of the 95% CI of VE estimates did not exceed 40%. The pre-specified success criterion to demonstrate 
VE of aQIV against antigenically matched influenza cases (key secondary efficacy objective) was also 
not met given the low number of matched cases as the LL of the 95% CI of VE estimates did not 
exceed 40%. aQIV provided higher VE, with lower bounds above zero when the modified CDC ILI and 
standard CDC ILI definitions were used.

It should be noted that during this procedure, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has 
approved the aQIV for use in adults 65 years of age and older, with a postmarketing requirement to 
conduct study V118_24, a clinical disease endpoint trial in subjects 65 years of age and older with 
Fluad Quadrivalent (this is the tradename of Fluad Tetra in the US). This study is planned to be 
completed in March 31, 2024. Given that the efficacy study V118_18 has failed to meet its primary 
endpoint, the CHMP would benefit from reviewing the data derived from this planned study. Therefore, 
the Clinical Study Report from study V118_24 will be added as a recommendation.  
In conclusion, it is considered that an indication for elderly can be granted. 
2.6.  Clinical safety (paediatric indication) 
Patient exposure 
Assessment of the aQIV safety profile in children is primarily based on 1 pivotal study in children 6 to 
<72 months of age (Study V118_05) and further supported by 6 aQIV/aTIV studies and 2 aQIV 
revaccination studies. There are three main sets of pooled safety data on which the applicant has 
based its discussion of safety  
• 
• 
• 
Pivotal Pooling  
Supportive Pooling  
Revaccination studies  
In the pivotal aQIV study V118_05, 5,339 subjects were exposed to aQIV. Of these, the following 
season 317 were revaccinated with aQIV in study V118_05E1 and 403 in study V118_05E3. In 
addition, 402 subjects exposed to non-adjuvanted comparator in V118_05 were vaccinated with aQIV 
in the revaccination study V118_05E3.  
In the 6 supportive studies, 3,123 subjects from study V70_29 with aTIV were included in the Pivotal 
Pooling, and 546 subjects from the 5 additional supportive studies with aQIV/aTIV (V70_50, V70P2, 
V70P6, V70_34, and V104P2) were included in the Supportive Pooling. 
In the 3 aQIV clinical studies, safety and tolerability was determined by the collection of solicited local 
and systemic adverse events (AEs) for 7 days after each vaccine dose; and any unsolicited AE during 
the treatment period (Day 1 to 21). Occurrence of SAEs, AEs leading to study withdrawal, AESIs, and 
AEs leading to a new onset of chronic disease (NOCD) were monitored for up to 12 months after 
receipt of the last dose of study vaccine. All solicited and unsolicited AEs are summarized individually 
for Studies V118_05, V118_05E1, and V118_05E3. 
Unsolicited AEs are summarized for the 3 aQIV studies individually through a general overview of these 
events, including severity and causality, and more detailed Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) analyses of frequent AEs (≥2% total 
incidence for pooled data).  
Studies V118_05 and V70_29 comprise the Pivotal Pooling analysis that provides the key safety data 
to support the use of aQIV in paediatric subjects. The Pivotal Pooling analysis provides safety data 
across 15,208 subjects from 6 to <72 months of age, with 8,462 unique subjects having been exposed 
to aQIV or aTIV. The key pooled safety data presented include SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, AEs 
following immunization (AEFIs), AESIs, and NOCDs. Both studies had a 12-month follow-up period 
after vaccine administration, as well as prospective AESI collection.  
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 144/194 
 
 
 
The Supportive Pooling analysis includes 1,099 subjects 6 to <72 months of age of whom 546 were 
vaccinated with aQIV or aTIV across 5 clinical studies. The Supportive Pooling included studies in which 
safety evaluations were performed in a similar manner as for the pivotal studies, follow-up periods for 
studies in the Supportive Pooling analyses were up to 6 months. 
Overall, 6,483 subjects were exposed to aQIV throughout the clinical studies; 3,647 subjects were 
exposed to the trivalent formulation aTIV and 7,692 to a comparator vaccine. 
All unsolicited AEs that occurred, regardless of investigator causality assessment, were included in the 
(pooled) analyses. Pivotal Pooling and Supportive Pooling summaries are provided for AEs including 
deaths, AEs leading to withdrawal, SAEs, AESIs, and AEFIs; NOCDs are reported for Pivotal Pooling 
only.  
All pooled studies applied the dosing recommendations from the WHO i.e., children less than 3 years of 
age received a 0.25 mL dose of aQIV or aTIV (or non-adjuvanted comparator) containing 7.5 μg of 
influenza virus HA for each of the 3 or 4 influenza strains. Children ≥3 years of age received a 0.5 mL 
dose of aQIV or aTIV (or non-adjuvanted comparator), containing 15 μg of HA per influenza strain. 
Adverse events 
Pivotal Study V118_05  
In the overall population (subjects 6 to <72 months of age), a higher proportion of subjects in the aQIV 
group had at least one solicited AE compared to the non-adjuvanted vaccine group after any vaccination 
(72.95%  vs.  64.12%,  respectively).  The  same  pattern  was  also  observed  for  any  solicited  local  AEs, 
systemic  AEs  or  other  indicators  of  reactogenicity  (use  of  antipyretics/analgesics).  The  majority  of 
subjects reported local and systemic AEs that were of mild or moderate severity and resolved within 3 
to 4 days. Only a small percentage (<1% for local and <5% for systemic events) of solicited AEs persisted 
after 7 days and there were no differences between aQIV and the comparator.

Solicited Local AEs 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020

The most frequently reported solicited local AEs in both vaccine groups in the overall age population of 
tenderness and erythema. The proportion of subjects with any tenderness was higher in the aQIV group 
(43.19%) than in the comparator group (33.86%). The proportion of subjects with erythema was similar 
in each age group for both vaccine groups. 
A  slightly  higher  proportion  of  subjects  experienced  moderate  or  severe  tenderness,  erythema  or 
induration after aQIV as compared to the comparator vaccine. 
Solicited Systemic AEs 
The most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs reported were irritability, sleepiness and change in 
eating habits in both vaccine groups. The proportion of subjects with reported irritability, sleepiness and 
change in eating habits was slightly higher in aQIV than comparator vaccine group (27.07% vs. 22.52% 
for irritability, 26.25% vs. 21.25% for sleepiness, and 22.53% vs. 17.49% for change in eating habits). 
The proportion of subjects reporting severe irritability (1.30% aQIV vs. 0.81% comparator), sleepiness 
(0.76% aQIV vs. 0.38% comparator), and change in eating habits (0.97% aQIV vs. 0.95% comparator) 
was low in both vaccine groups. Other solicited less frequent systemic AEs were diarrhoea, vomiting and 
chills, with frequencies slightly higher in aQIV than comparator vaccine group. 
A  greater  proportion  of  subjects  experienced  fever  ≥38°C  from  6  hours  through  Day 7  after  any 
vaccination in the aQIV group than in the comparator vaccine group (19.1% vs. 10.5%). The majority 
of subjects with fever in both vaccine groups had body temperature <39°C. A fever ≥39.0°C to <40°C 
was reported in 4.1% of subjects in the aQIV group and 2.3% of subjects in the comparator vaccine 
group.  Overall,  only  a  small  proportion  of  subjects  had  high  fever  ≥40°C,  which  was  similar  for  both 
vaccine groups (0.4% aQIV, 0.3% comparator vaccine group).  
Solicited AEs after First and Second Vaccination 
Within each vaccine group, the proportion of vaccine-naive subjects with any solicited AE was slightly 
lower after Vaccination 2 as compared to after Vaccination 1 (54.07% vs. 63.45% for aQIV and 43.45% 
vs. 55.14% for comparator group).  
Tenderness  was  less  frequently  reported  after  Vaccination  2  than  after  Vaccination  1  in  both  vaccine 
groups: 27.76% vs. 32.20% with aQIV and 21.07% vs. 24.82% with comparator vaccine. For systemic 
AEs, irritability and sleepiness were less frequently reported after Vaccination 2 than after Vaccination 1 
for both vaccine groups (irritability: 16.74% vs. 22.06% for aQIV and 13.04% vs. 18.71% for comparator 
group;  sleepiness:  15.02%  vs.  21.16%  for  aQIV  and  10.49%  vs.  17.98%  for  comparator,  after 
Vaccination 2 and 1, respectively).  
The proportion of vaccine-naive subjects with fever (defined as ≥38°C) was similar after Vaccination 2 
and Vaccination 1 for both vaccine groups, and as well as after the first vaccination was higher in the 
aQIV group (14.4% vs. 13.1% for aQIV and 6.8% vs. 7.1% for the comparator after Vaccination 2 and 
Vaccination  1,  respectively).  The  proportion  of  subjects  with  high  fever  ≥40°C  was  similar  after 
Vaccination 2 and Vaccination 1 for both groups (0.3% vs. 0.2% for the aQIV group and 0.2% vs. 0.2% 
for  the  comparator  vaccine  group).  The  use  of  antipyretics/analgesics  was  similar  after  Vaccination  2 
and Vaccination 1 for both vaccine groups and higher in the aQIV group. 
Revaccination Study V118_05E1 
Overall,  a  higher  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  aQIV  group  than  in  the  QIV-1  group  had  at  least  one 
solicited  AE  between  6  hours  and  7  days  after  vaccination  (63.72%  vs.  51.39%,  respectively).  The 
majority of subjects experiencing local and systemic AEs reported events that were mild to moderate in 
severity and resolved within 4 days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 146/194 
 
 
 
 
The  most  frequently  reported  solicited  local  AEs  in  both  vaccine  groups  after  revaccination  were 
tenderness,  erythema  and  induration.  The  proportion  of  subjects  with  tenderness,  erythema  and 
induration was higher in the aQIV group than in QIV-1 group (46.69% vs. 28.15% for tenderness, 9.93% 
vs. 3.33% for erythema, and 7.28% vs. 2.59% for induration).  
The most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs reported were irritability, sleepiness and change in 
eating habits in both vaccine groups. The proportion of subjects with reported irritability, sleepiness and 
change in eating habits was higher in aQIV than QIV-1 (26.82% vs. 16.67% for irritability, 24.50% vs. 
19.63% for sleepiness, and 17. 88% vs. 10.37% for change in eating habits). The proportion of subjects 
reporting  severe  irritability,  sleepiness,  and  change  in  eating  habits  was  low  in  both  vaccine  groups 
(0.33% and 0% for irritability, 1.66% and 0% for sleepiness, and 0.99% and 0.37% for change in eating 
habits). 
A  greater  proportion  of  subjects  experienced  fever  ≥38°C  from  6 hours  through  Day  7  after  any 
vaccination in the aQIV group than in the QIV-1 group (9.8% vs. 4.5%). High fever ≥40°C was reported 
in 1 subject in the aQIV group, who experienced a febrile convulsion on Day 6.  
The use of analgesic or antipyretic medication for treatment was reported by 19.39% of aQIV subjects 
and 7.22% of comparator subjects. These results are concordant with those of the pivotal study. 
Revaccination Study V118_05E3 
The incidence of solicited AEs in the revaccination study V118_05E3 was greater in subjects who received 
aQIV compared to QIV-1, regardless of the vaccine allocation (aQIV or non-adjuvanted comparator) in 
Study V118_05. 
Overall, a higher proportion of subjects in the aQIV/aQIV group than in the QIV-1/QIV-1 group had at 
least one solicited AE between 6 hours and 7 days after vaccination (64.76% vs. 40.71%, respectively). 
The  same  pattern  was  observed  for  any  solicited  local  AEs,  systemic  AEs  or  Others  (use  of 
antipyretics/analgesics). 
The most frequently reported solicited local AE across all four groups after revaccination was tenderness. 
For 8 subjects, the tenderness was reported as severe (5 [1.24%] subjects in the aQIV/aQIV group, 2 
[0.50%] subjects in the aQIV/QIV-1 group, and 3 [0.75%] subjects in the QIV-1/aQIV group). No subject 
in the QIV-1/QIV-1 group reported tenderness as severe.  
Fever (body temperature ≥38°C) was the most commonly reported solicited systemic AE and occurred 
more  frequently  in  subjects  who  received  aQIV  (aQIV/aQIV:  21.59%;  QIV-1/aQIV:  11.69%)  than  in 
subjects who received QIV-1 (aQIV/QIV-1: 7.44%; QIV-1/QIV-1: 7.38%). High fever ≥40.0°C was rare 
and experienced by 1 subject each group except for the aQIV/QIV-1 group (no subjects).  
Sleepiness was the solicited systemic AE experienced with the next highest frequency in any treatment 
group  after  fever  (aQIV/aQIV:  19.35%;  aQIV/QIV-1:  11.17%;  QIV-1/aQIV:  13.68%,  QIV-1/QIV-1: 
6.11%). Irritability and change in eating habits followed a similar pattern to that seen for sleepiness, in 
that the subjects in the aQIV treated groups experienced these events more frequently than those in the 
QIV-1 treated groups. The proportion of subjects reporting severe sleepiness, irritability, and change in 
eating habits was low and occurred only in treatment groups that included aQIV (sleepiness: aQIV/aQIV: 
0.50%;  irritability:  aQIV/aQIV:  0.50%;  change  in  eating  habits:  aQIV/aQIV:  0.99%,  aQIV/QIV-1: 
0.25%). No subjects in the QIV-1/QIV-1 group experienced severe sleepiness, irritability or change in 
eating habits. 
In the overall study population, use of analgesic or antipyretic medication for prevention from 6 hours 
through Day 7 was reported by 9.23% of aQIV/aQIV subjects, 4.14% of aQIV/QIV-1 subjects, 6.35% of 
QIV-1/aQIV subjects, and 4.80% of QIV-1/QIV-1 subjects. The use of analgesic or antipyretic medication

for treatment in this time frame was reported by 22.69% of aQIV/aQIV subjects, 8.56% of aQIV/QIV-1 
subjects, 13.81% of QIV-1/aQIV subjects, and 7.91% of QIV-1/QIV-1 subjects.

Unsolicited Adverse Events 
Pivotal Study V118_05  
In the overall age group (6 months to <72 months), the proportion of subjects with any unsolicited AEs 
was similar for the aQIV and comparator groups (68.21% vs. 68.65%).  
The  most  commonly  reported  AEs  and  related  AEs  according  to  SOC  were  ‘general  disorders  and 
administration side conditions’, and ‘infections and infestations’ during the overall and treatment period. 
The  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  unsolicited  AEs  was  similar  for  the  vaccine  groups  (68.21%  vs. 
68.65%  during  overall  period,  and  49.91%  vs.  50.05%  during  treatment  period,  for  the  aQIV  and 
comparator groups, respectively).

The  most  frequently  reported  unsolicited  AEs  in  either  vaccine  group  during  the  overall  period  and 
treatment  period  were  influenza-like  illness  (ILI)  (51.34%  in  aQIV  group  and  51.66%  in  comparator 
vaccine group during overall period; 19.57% vs. 18.47% during treatment period) and upper respiratory 
tract infection (9.78% vs. 10.54% during overall period; 9.77% vs. 10.46% during treatment period). 
The majority of unsolicited AEs in either group were mild in severity.  
The proportion of possibly related unsolicited AEs was 13.08% for the aQIV group and 10.33% for the 
comparator in the overall period and 12.76% for the aQIV group vs. 10.08% for the comparator during 
the treatment period.  
The most frequently reported related unsolicited AE was ILI in both vaccine groups (5.95% and 4.20% 
during  overall  period,  5.59%  and  3.93%  during  treatment  period.  The  majority  of  unsolicited  AEs 
considered  related  to  the  study  vaccine  during  both  the  overall  and  treatment  periods  were  mild  in 
severity.

Revaccination Study V118_05E1  
Unsolicited AEs were reported in a comparable proportion of subjects in the aQIV group (56.47%) and 
the QIV-1 group (52.08%) during the total study period. The proportion of subjects reporting AEs was 
generally comparable between vaccine groups on a SOC and PT level.  
In the treatment period, unsolicited AEs were reported in a slightly higher proportion of subjects in the 
aQIV  group  than  in  the  QIV-1  group  (26.81%  vs.  20.83%),  but  the  proportion  of  subjects  reporting 
related AEs was similar between vaccine groups (15 [4.73%] for aQIV and 15 [5.21%] for QIV-1). The 
most frequently reported AEs in treatment period in either vaccine group were upper respiratory tract 
infection (15 [4.73%] vs. 9 [3.13%]) and ILI (13 [4.10%] vs. 16 [5.56%]).

A small proportion of subjects across all groups experienced unsolicited AEs, which were considered by 
the investigator to be at least possibly related to the vaccination: from 3.82% (QIV-1/QIV-1) to 6.20% 
(aQIV-1/aQIV-1) of subjects.  
Table 56: Study V118_05E3 – Overview of Unsolicited Adverse Events Reported After Any 
Vaccination in All Subjects, Overall Period – Unsolicited Safety Set 
The most frequently reported AEs in this period in either treatment group were upper respiratory tract 
infection (4.33% to 4.73%) and ILI (5.34% to 6.72%).  
In the treatment period, severe events were reported in 2 subjects: 1 subject with injection site erythema 
and  injection  site  pain  in  the  aQIV/QIV-1  group  and  1 subject  with  gastroenteritis  in  the  QIV-1/aQIV 
group.  The  injection  site  erythema  and  injection  site  pain  were  considered  probably  related  and  the 
gastroenteritis was unrelated to the study vaccine.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
A total of 13 SAEs with the outcome of death in paediatric subjects 6 to <72 months of age were reported 
in 3 of the 9 clinical studies included in this safety summary (4 in V118_05, 8 in V70_29, and 1 in V70P6). 
Only  2  deaths  occurred  from  subjects  in  an  adjuvanted  vaccine  group.  None  of  the  deaths  were 
considered  to  be  vaccine-related.  Additional  details  about  individual  cases  are  located  in  the  subject

The majority of SAEs in Study V118_05 were reported in the SOC Infections and infestations (Table 2-
22).  Overall,  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  SAEs  was  similar  for  the  aQIV  and  comparator  vaccine 
groups (234 [4.46%] subjects vs. 230 [4.46%] subjects) during the overall period. The most frequently 
reported SAEs were pneumonia (38 [0.72%] and 28 [0.54%]), gastroenteritis (23 [0.44%], 23 [0.45%]) 
and animal bite (24 [0.46%], 19 [0.37%]). During the treatment period, the proportion of subjects with 
SAEs  was similar for the aQIV and comparator vaccine groups (41 [0.78%] subjects vs. 44 [0.85%], 
respectively). 
Related SAEs 
Related SAEs were reported in 6 subjects in aQIV group and in 1 subject in comparator vaccine group. 
The 6 SAEs in the aQIV group included Type I hypersensitivity, febrile convulsion, allergy to arthropod 
bite, anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity, and papule. The possibly related SAE in the QIV-1 group 
included diarrhoea and vomiting.

Table 57 Pivotal pooling – Overview of AE and SAE, including Risk Ratios, in All Subjects-
Safety Set 
In total, 643 out of 15,208 subjects in the Pivotal Pooling experienced at least one SAE (4.1% aQIV/aTIV 
group and 4.4% QIV-1/TIV-1 group). 
From 643 SAES 8 were assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccine and the vast majority, 
7, were in the aQIV/aTIV group and only 1 the pooled QIV-1/TIV-1 group. However, risk ratios did not 
indicate a statistically significant difference between aQIV/aTIV and QIV 1/TIV 1 regarding frequency of 
overall SAEs in all subjects. All individual SAEs (by PT) occurred in less than 1% of the subjects in either 
vaccine group.  
The most frequently reported SAEs were pneumonia (68 [0.8%] and 47 [0.7%]), animal bite (46 [0.5%], 
33 [0.5%]), and gastroenteritis (41 [0.5%], 35 [0.5%]). All other SAEs occurred in less than 0.5% in 
either vaccine group.  
In the pivotal pooling the risk ratios of SAEs by PT did not show an increased risk for the individual SAEs 
after vaccination with aQIV/aTIV as compared with QIV 1/TIV 1 except for Febrile convulsion (Nervous 
System Disorders) that showed a risk ratio of 1.85, and 95% CI 0.89-3.85 (p value 0.0981).

Of the febrile convulsions that were reported as an SAE, 4 of the cases (<0.1%) occurred in the treatment 
period (3 aQIV/aTIV and 1 QIV 1/TIV 1). 
Related SAEs 
In the overall population of subjects from 6 to <72 months of age, 8 subjects (at most 0.1% per vaccine 
group and overall) reported SAEs during the overall period that were considered by the study investigator 
to be at least possibly related to the study. Although there were no statistically significant differences in 
relative risk between aQIV/aTIV and QIV-1/TIV-1 for subjects with related SAEs, 7 subjects were in the 
aQIV/aTIV  group  (allergy  to  arthropod  bite,  anaphylactic  reaction,  hypersensitivity,  Type I 
hypersensitivity,  Type  III  immune  complex  mediated  reaction,  febrile  convulsion,  and  papule)  and  1 
subject in the QIV-1/TIV-1 group (diarrhoea and vomiting [both events in the same subject]). 
Revaccination Study V118_05E1 
Eleven subjects experienced SAEs in the revaccination study V118_05E1; 7 (2.21%) subjects in the aQIV 
group, and 4 (1.39%) subjects in the QIV-1 group. None of the SAEs were reported in the treatment 
period and none of the SAEs were considered to be related to the study vaccine. 
Revaccination Study V118_05E3 
There were 36 subjects who experienced SAEs in revaccination study V118_05E3. For those who received 
aQIV in the revaccination study, 10 subjects (2.48%) in the aQIV/aQIV group and 7 subjects (1.74%) 
in the QIV-1/aQIV group, experienced SAEs. 
For those who received QIV-1 in the revaccination study, 11 subjects (2.73%) in the aQIV/QIV-1 group 
and 8 subjects (2.04%) and QIV-1/QIV-1 group, experienced SAEs. None of the SAEs were considered 
to be related to the study vaccine.  
Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory data were collected in Study V70_29. A total of 200 subjects (99 in the aTIV group, 
49 in the TIV-1 group, and 52 in the TIV-2 group) were evaluated by clinical laboratory analyses of 
blood samples taken at Day 1 and Day 8. Clinical chemistry and haematology laboratory toxicity 
assessments indicated that nearly all the subjects were at Grade 0 (none) or Grade 1 (mild) levels of 
toxicity for all the measures tested (91% – 100% of subjects for each measure). None of the subjects 
had a grade of 3 (severe) or 4 (potentially life-threatening) for any of the measures tested. 
Safety in special populations 
Safety from subgroup analyses includes data from Study V118_05, as this was the largest pivotal aQIV 
study comprising the majority of paediatric subjects.  
Analyses by Age 
In Study V118_05 the demographic and baseline characteristics observed in the overall population of 
subjects from 6 to <72 months of age were similar to that of the 2 age subgroups including subjects 
from  6  to  <24  months  of  age  and  from  24  to  <72 months  of  age.  The  younger  and  the  older  age 
subgroups appeared generally well balanced on demographics and baseline characteristics, with a slightly 
higher  number  of  naive  subjects  in  the  6  to  <24 months  of  age  group  when  compared  to  the  older 
subjects (24 to <72 months). The reporting period for AEs was approximately 4 weeks longer for naive 
subjects  (receiving  2 vaccinations  4 weeks  apart)  than  for  non-naive  subjects  (receiving  single 
vaccination).

Solicited Adverse Events 
For both age subgroups, 6 to <24 months and 24 to <72 months, the proportion of subjects with any 
solicited AEs after any vaccination was higher in the aQIV group than in the comparator group (Table 
59). The vaccine group difference (aQIV vs. comparator vaccine group) was larger in the older age group. 
Table 58: Study V118_05 – Subjects with at Least one Solicited Adverse Event, Report from 
6 Hours through Day 7, by Vaccination in subjects 6 to <24 months and 24 to <72 months of 
age – Solicited Safety Set 
The proportion of subjects with solicited local AEs was lower in younger subjects (6 to <24 months) than 
in older subjects in both vaccine groups. In both age groups, the most frequently reported solicited local 
AEs were tenderness and erythema.  
Solicited Systemic AEs 
For solicited systemic AEs, the proportion of subjects reporting events after any vaccination in the 6 to 
<24  months  group  was  61.15%  in  the  aQIV  and  56.12%  in  the  comparator  vaccine.  In  the  24  to 
<72 months age group the vaccine group difference was higher, 50.09% in the aQIV group vs. 38.42% 
in the comparator group.  
In  both  age  groups,  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  systemic  AEs  after  any  vaccination  were 
irritability,  sleepiness  and  change  in  eating  habits  in  both  vaccine  groups.  For  systemic  events,  the 
proportion of subjects with irritability was higher in the younger than the older subjects in both vaccine 
groups. The proportion of subjects with sleepiness and change in eating habits was higher in younger 
subjects in both vaccine groups. 
Fever  
For both age subgroups, a greater proportion of subjects experiencing fever ≥38°C from 6 hours through 
Day 7 after any vaccination in the aQIV group than in the comparator vaccine group.  
In the aQIV group, the proportion of subjects with fever was 20.0% in the 6 to <24 months age group 
and 18.8% in post hoc 24 to <72 months age group. In the comparator vaccine group, the proportion 
of subjects with fever was lower in the post hoc 24 to <72 months age group older age group (9.4%) 
than in the 6 to <24 months group (13.6%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 154/194 
 
 
 
 
The proportion of subjects with fever ≥40ºC was low for both vaccine groups in both age groups. In the 
6 to <24 months of age group, 7 cases (0.6%) of fever ≥40ºC were reported in aQIV group and 4 cases 
(0.3%) in comparator vaccine group. 
Antipyretics/analgesics 
The use of antipyretics/analgesics was similar in the aQIV group for both age groups (31.76% in the 6 
to <24 months age group; 29.28% in the post hoc 24 to <72 months group). In the comparator group 
slightly higher use was reported in the 6 to <24 months subjects, 21.87%, compared to 16.57% in the 
older subjects. 
Unsolicited Adverse Events 
During  the  overall  period  in  Study  V118_05,  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  any  unsolicited  AEs  was 
higher  in  younger  than  older  subjects  in  both  vaccine  groups.  No  notable  difference  was  observed 
between aQIV and comparator vaccine in any of the age groups (Table 5-2). The same pattern, i.e., a 
higher proportion of related unsolicited AEs and unsolicited SAEs was observed in younger subjects. In 
the aQIV group the proportion of subjects with related AEs was 16.87% and 11.84% for the 6 to <24 
months and 24 to <72 months age group respectively. In the comparator group the proportions were 
slightly lower 13.78% and 9.13%, for the same age groups respectively.  
During the treatment period after any vaccination the pattern was similar and the proportion of subjects 
reporting unsolicited AEs was higher in the younger subjects (6 to <24 months) than in the older subjects 
(24 to <72 months) for both vaccine groups. There were no notable vaccine group differences for most 
frequently reported AEs (i.e., ILI and upper respiratory tract infection).  
Analyses by Dose 
For  Study  V118_05,  subjects  received  a  0.25 mL  vaccine  dose  from  6  to  <36  months  of  age,  and  a 
0.5 mL vaccine dose from 36 to <72 months of age. 
Solicited Adverse Events 
The proportion of subjects who reported at least one solicited AE was comparable in all dose groups. A 
greater percentage of subjects reported solicited AEs in the aQIV vs. comparator vaccine groups. The 
difference between vaccine groups tended to be smaller in the 0.25 mL dose group. 
Unsolicited Adverse Events 
The proportion of subjects with any unsolicited AEs was higher in the 0.25 mL dose group (subjects 6 to 
<36 months old) than the 0.5 mL dose group (subjects 36 to <72 months old) for both adjuvanted and 
non-adjuvanted vaccine groups. There were no notable differences between vaccine groups (aQIV vs. 
comparator) for any of the dose groups. The same pattern was observed for unsolicited SAEs and any 
unsolicited AEs leading to hospitalization. 
Analyses by Sex 
For any solicited AEs in study V118_05, the proportion of subjects with events was similar in males and 
females  for  both  vaccine  groups:  72.63%  vs.  73.27%  in  aQIV  group  and  63.35%  vs.  64.93%  in 
comparator vaccine group. The same pattern i.e., no difference between male and female subjects was 
also observed for any solicited local AEs, systemic AEs and Others after any vaccination. 
The proportion of male and female subjects with any unsolicited AE was similar in both vaccine groups 
(68.57%  vs.  67.84%  for aQIV  group  and  68.66% vs.  68.64%  for  comparator  vaccine  group).  In  line 
with overall results, no vaccine group differences were noted within the sex subgroups.

Analyses by Race 
Solicited Adverse Events 
In  Study  V118_05,  the  Overall  Safety  Set  population  comprised  of predominately  Asian  (44.3%)  and 
white (39.8%) subjects. For any solicited AEs, the proportion of subjects with events was higher in white 
subjects than Asian subjects for both vaccine groups: 77.89% vs. 72.94% in aQIV group and 71.65% 
vs. 61.30% in comparator vaccine group. Overall, the lowest incidence of solicited AEs reported from 6 
hours  through  Day 7  after  any  vaccination  was  found  in  black  or  African  American  subjects  (aQIV: 
55.59%;  comparator  vaccine  group:  48.65%).  A  similar  pattern,  i.e.,  higher  percentages  in  white 
subjects, was observed for solicited local AEs and systemic AEs. 
In both vaccine groups, a greater proportion of Asian subjects experienced fever ≥38°C from 6 hours 
through Day 7 after any vaccination than white subjects (aQIV: 26.37% vs. 13.53%; comparator vaccine 
group: 13.12% vs. 8.61%). In Asian subjects, also the use of antipyretics/analgesics was higher (Asian: 
39.22%  and  22.30%;  white:  22.11%  and  14.10%  in  the  aQIV  and  comparator  vaccine  groups, 
respectively).  
Unsolicited Adverse Events 
The proportion of subjects with unsolicited AEs was higher in Asian subjects than white subjects for both 
vaccine  groups:  77.91%  vs.  66.44%  in  the  aQIV  group,  respectively,  and  74.98%  vs.  69.74%  in 
comparator vaccine group. Overall, the lowest incidence of unsolicited AEs after any vaccination during 
the overall period was in black or African American subjects (aQIV: 40.03%; comparator vaccine group: 
42.09%). The proportion of subjects with possibly or probably related AEs was comparable for Asian and 
white subjects, but lower in black or African American subjects. 
A similar pattern was observed for SAEs, i.e., higher percentages of reports in Asian subjects, (Asian: 
7.23% and 6.56%; white: 2.34% and 2.86%; black or African American: 1.62% and 2.15% in the aQIV 
and comparator vaccine groups, respectively. SAEs which were considered related to study vaccine by 
the investigator only occurred in Asian subjects. 
NOCDs  occurred  more  frequently  in  white  subjects  (2.86%  and  3.01%  in  the  aQIV  and  comparator 
vaccine groups) than in Asian (0.60% in both vaccine groups) and black or African American subjects 
(1.33% and 2.30%). 
Analyses by Risk of Influenza Complications  
In Study V118_05, the majority of subjects were healthy (aQIV: 91.2%, comparator vaccine: 91.4%) 
and 8.7% of the subjects were considered to be at high risk of influenza complications (aQIV: 8.8%, 
comparator vaccine group: 8.6%).  
For any solicited AEs, the proportion of subjects with at least one event was similar in healthy subjects 
and subjects at high risk of influenza complications for both vaccine groups: 73.06% vs. 71.78% in aQIV 
group  and  63.88%  vs.  66.75%  in  comparator  vaccine  group.  No  relevant  difference  between  healthy 
and at high risk subjects, was also observed for any solicited local and systemic AEs. 
The proportion of subjects with any unsolicited AEs was similar for healthy subjects and subjects at high 
risk of influenza complications in both vaccine groups (68.56% vs. 64.50% for aQIV group and 68.72% 
vs.  67.88%  for  comparator  vaccine  group).  The  most  frequently  reported  unsolicited  AEs  in  healthy 
subjects and subjects at high risk were ILI and upper respiratory tract infection for both vaccine groups. 
Extrinsic Factors: Vaccine Naivety Status 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 156/194 
 
 
 
For Study V118_05, analyses of solicited and unsolicited AE data are also provided by vaccine naivety 
status (i.e., whether or not a subject was reported to having had been previously vaccinated with an 
influenza vaccine).  
Solicited Adverse Events 
Overall  in  both  vaccine  groups,  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  local  AEs  were  tenderness  and 
erythema and most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs were irritability, sleepiness and change in 
eating  habits.  Non-naive  subjects  tended  to  have  somewhat  more  solicited  local  reactions,  mainly 
tenderness (48.12% aQIV and 36.91% comparator in vaccine non-naive subjects vs. 32.20% aQIV and 
24.82% comparator in vaccine naive subjects). This is in agreement with the age subgroup data and the 
fact that non-naive subjects tend to be older.  
Similar trends in solicited systemic AEs and fever were seen as in the age subgroups, with 13.1% aQIV 
and 7.1% comparator for vaccine-naive subjects vs. 10.3% aQIV and 5.7% comparator for vaccine non-
naive subjects reporting fever ≥38°C after first vaccination. 
Unsolicited Adverse Events  
The proportion of subjects with any unsolicited AEs was higher in the vaccine naive than in the vaccine 
non-naive  subjects  for  both  vaccine  groups  (overall  period:  71.72%  vs.  60.96%  for  aQIV  group  and 
71.94%  vs.  61.71%  for  comparator  vaccine  group;  treatment  period:  57.36%  vs.  34.54%  for  aQIV 
group and 57.29% vs. 34.80% for comparator vaccine group). The reporting period for AEs was longer 
for naive subjects, who received 2 vaccinations, than for vaccine non-naive subjects, who only received 
a single vaccination.  
Immunological events 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) 
In  the  aQIV  clinical  studies  (V118_05,  V118_05E1,  and  V118_05E3),  subjects  were  assessed  for  any 
new  medical  events  or  signs  or  symptoms  that  could  possibly  indicate  a  potential  immune-mediated 
disease  (AESIs).  These  events  were  prospectively  defined  and  reported  during  the  clinical  study 
according  to  a  list  of  medical  terms  as  specified  in  the  protocols,  which  was  the  same  for  all  3  aQIV 
studies.  
Prospectively assessed AESIs are presented for all 3 individual aQIV studies. For the pooled data and for 
the  revaccination  studies  (V118_05E1  and  V118_05E3),  the  evaluation  of  AESIs  was  additionally 
conducted as a retrospective analysis using the list of MedDRA PTs (provided). 
Study V118_05 
In  Study  V118_05,  5  AESIs  were  reported  after  vaccination  with  aQIV  (Henoch-Schönlein  purpura, 
Crohn’s disease, Type I diabetes mellitus, Kawasaki’s disease and Encephalitis autoimmune) and 4 AESIs 
were reported after vaccination with the comparator vaccine (Type I diabetes mellitus, Henoch-Schönlein 
purpura, Immune thrombocytopenia and Coeliac Disease). None of the AESIs were considered related 
to study vaccine.  
Pivotal Pooling 
In the overall Pivotal Pooling population, 12 AESI cases were identified: 7 in the aQIV/aTIV group and 5 
in  the  QIV-1/TIV-1  group.  There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  in  relative  risk  between 
aQIV/aTIV  and  QIV-1/TIV-1  for  subjects  reporting  any  AESIs  during  the  overall  study  period.  All 
retrospectively  determined  AESIs  occurred  in  1  subject  in  each  vaccine  group  and  were  considered 
unrelated to study vaccine.  
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 157/194 
 
 
 
During  the  retrospective  assessment,  2  additional  AESI  cases  were  identified  in  Study V118_05  as 
compared  to  the  prospective  assessment.  Based  on  the  clinical  context,  these  2  cases  were  not 
prospectively defined by the study investigator as AESI with the following reasons. In the first instance, 
the retrospectively assessed AESI of Kawasaki’s disease occurred in a subject who already had a history 
of Kawasaki’s disease (reported term: ‘Kawasaki's disease [sequelae from pre-existing condition]’). In 
the second instance, the retrospectively assessed AESI of 6th Nerve paralysis was a side effect of surgery 
(reported term: ‘6th nerve palsy right eye [side effect of surgery to remove ependymoma]’). 
Revaccination Studies V118_05E1 and V118_05E3 
Unsolicited AESIs were prospectively reported for 2 subjects in V118_05E1 revaccination study. Immune 
thrombocytopenic purpura was reported for 1 subject in the aQIV group and Type I diabetes mellitus 
was reported for 1 subject in the QIV-1 group. Both events were not assessed by the investigator as 
related to study vaccine. 
An unsolicited AESI, Kawasaki’s disease, was prospectively reported for 1 subject (0.25%) in 
revaccination study V118_05E3 from the QIV-1/QIV-1 group. 
Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFIs) 
The safety analyses were supplemented by a second retrospective analysis that included 2 categories of 
clinically  important  AEFIs:  hypersensitivity-type  events  (including  PTs  from  the  SMQ  Anaphylactic 
Reaction and Angioedema), indicated as AEFIs of ‘Hypersensitivity’ and Generalized Convulsive Seizures 
Following  Immunization,  indicated  as  AEFIs  of  ’Febrile  Convulsion’.  The  identification  of  AEFI  was 
restricted  to  the  first  7  days  after  each  vaccination  for  PTs  from  the  Angioedema  SMQ  and  from  the 
Generalised  Convulsive  Seizures  Following  Immunization  SMQ  and  restricted  to  the  first  2 days  after 
each vaccination for events from the Anaphylactic Reactions SMQ. 
Pivotal Pooling 
In the Pivotal Pooling, AEFIs were identified in 32 (0.2%) subjects (20 [0.2%] aQIV/aTIV and 12 [0.2%] 
QIV-1/TIV-1 group). In the ‘Hypersensitivity’ category, AEFIs were identified in 27 subjects (16 [0.2%] 
aQIV/aTIV and 11 [0.2%] QIV-1/TIV-1). In the ‘Febrile Convulsion’ category 5 subjects were identified 
(4 [<0.1%] in aQIV/aTIV and 1 [<0.1%] in QIV-1/TIV-1). 
Hypersensitivity 
The  retrospective  analysis  of  AEFI  hypersensitivity  largely  identified  non-serious  events  of  mild  to 
moderate  urticaria  (overall  22  out  of  27,  with  12  in  the  aQIV/aTIV  group  and  10  in  the  QIV-1/TIV-1 
group).  In  addition,  the  following  events  were  identified  in  the  aQIV/aTIV  group:  1 serious  event  of 
moderate urticaria; 2 related SAEs of Type I hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis; and 1 AE of angioedema. 
In the QIV-1/TIV-1 group, 1 event of mild pharyngeal oedema was reported. 
There  were  only  2  events  with  immediate  onset,  both  in  the  aQIV  group.  These  were  a  Type  I 
hypersensitivity  which  consisted  primarily  of  cutaneous  symptoms  and  without  respiratory, 
gastrointestinal or cardiovascular symptoms and an event of anaphylaxis (both events were reported as 
SAEs  and  are  detailed in  the  SAEs  Section).  The  occurrence  of  these  AEFI  reactions  was  rare  overall 
(<0.1%). Given the nature of these events, hypersensitivity AEFIs were not identified as a risk associated 
with aQIV/aTIV. 
Febrile Convulsions 
In the Pivotal Pooling study population, AEFIs of Febrile convulsion were identified in 5 subjects overall 
(4 subjects [<0.1%] in the aQIV/aTIV group and 1 [<0.1%] subject in the QIV-1/TIV-1 group). 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 158/194 
 
 
 
The retrospective analysis of AEFI Febrile convulsions using the search criteria identified 3 non-serious, 
mild  events  and  2  serious,  moderate  events  that  were  resolved.  All  subjects  received  2  doses  of  the 
vaccine, with the incidence of the febrile convulsion only noted after either the first or the second dose, 
but  not  after  both.  Although  the  reported  febrile  convulsions  were  temporally  associated  with  the 
vaccination,  additional  comorbidities  were  reported  for  4  of  the  5  cases  (A/H1N1  influenza  infection, 
herpangina, pneumonia, and otitis media) which cannot be excluded as potentially contributory to the 
incidence of febrile convulsion.  
Supportive Pooling 
In the overall Supportive Pooling study population, 5 AEFIs were identified: 3 [0.5%] in the aQIV/aTIV 
group  and  2  [0.4%]  in  the  TIV  group.  All  5  cases  were  reported  in  the  ‘Hypersensitivity’  category  as 
urticaria in the Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders SOC.  
None of the AEFI cases in the Supportive Pooling population occurred in the ‘Febrile Convulsion’ category.  
Revaccination Study V118_05E1 
After revaccination, 2 (0.4%) of the 543 subjects included in the safety set experienced an AEFI. One 
23-month-old subject in the aQIV group experienced a febrile convulsion that started on Day 6, and one 
46-month-old subject in the QIV-1 group experienced a mild urticaria that started on Day 5. Both events 
were considered unrelated to the study vaccine. 
Revaccination Study V118_05E3 
In the revaccination study V118_05E3, after revaccination, 2 (0.5%) of the 1601 subjects included in 
the  safety  set  experienced  an  AEFI.  Both  cases  were  urticarias  and  ‘Hypersensitivity’  AEFIs.  One 
77-month-old Asian female subject in the aQIV/aQIV group experienced a mild urticaria that started on 
Day 4 that was considered related to the study vaccine. One 24-month-old Asian male subject in the 
aQIV/QIV-1 group also experienced a mild urticaria that started on Day 6 that was considered unrelated 
to the study vaccine. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The studies included in this Marketing Authorisation Application were not designed to prospectively 
assess interactions with concomitant vaccinations or drugs. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study V118_05 
There were 19 subjects (10 [0.19 %] in the aQIV group and 9 [0.17%] in the comparator vaccine group) 
who  reported  AEs  leading  to  premature  withdrawal.  Of  these  19  subjects,  11  were  withdrawn  from 
vaccine (7 subjects in the aQIV group and 4 subjects in the comparator vaccine group).  
Four  of  the  19  cases  concerned  unrelated  AEs  with  the  outcome  of  death  (1  aQIV  vs.  3 comparator 
group). Five of the 19 subjects experienced other SAEs of which 3 cases were related to study vaccine 
(all in the aQIV group). Of the remaining 10 non-serious cases, 7 were related to study vaccine (4 in the 
aQIV group and 3 in the comparator group). The 4 related non-serious cases in the aQIV group included 
peripheral  swelling  and  rash  (same  subject),  injection  site  pruritus,  ILI,  and  hypersensitivity;  the  3 
related cases in the comparator group included sleep terror, injection site pain and ILI.  
In general, numbers of AEs leading to withdrawal were evenly spread over multiple SOCs for both vaccine 
groups, except for the SOC Immune system disorders, where there were 4 subjects in the aQIV group

(1  subject  with  allergy  to  arthropod  bite  and  3  subjects  with  hypersensitivity  events;  all  4  were  SAE 
cases), and none in the comparator group.  
Pivotal Pooling 
In the overall study population of the Pivotal Pooling, 25 of the 15,208 subjects (0.2%) experienced AEs 
that led to vaccine or study withdrawal with no statistically significant differences in risk between the 
vaccine groups. Of these, 23 subjects were vaccine naive and in 14 of them, the second vaccination was 
not administered (7 in each vaccine group). In 10 subjects (7 aQIV/aTIV, 3 QIV-1/TIV-1) the AEs were 
considered related to study vaccination by the investigator.  
No  increased  risk  was  found  for  subjects  with  related  AEs  leading  to  vaccine  or  study  withdrawal  for 
aQIV/aTIV. 
Supportive Pooling 
In the Supportive Pooling study population, 6 of the 1099 subjects (0.1%) experienced AEs that led to 
vaccine or study withdrawal (2 [0.4%] aQIV/aTIV and 4 [0.7%] TIV group).  
Revaccination Studies V118_05E1 and V118_05E3 
In revaccination studies V118_05E1 and V118_05E3 none of the unsolicited AEs after study vaccination 
led to premature withdrawal from the study for any of the subjects. 
Post marketing experience 
There is limited paediatric post marketing experience with aTIV in children 6 months to <6 years (only 
approximately 4,000 doses of aTIV were distributed in Canada). Thus, since they are considered relevant 
post-marketing  safety  data  from  the  adjuvanted  pandemic  vaccine  aH1N1  (Focetria,  Seqirus)  that 
contains  one  of  the  four  strains  (A/H1N1)  of  influenza  virus  included  in  the  aQIV  formulation  and  is 
adjuvanted with MF59 have been submitted. 
It is estimated that approximately 1.2 million doses of Focetria have been administered in children aged 
6 months to <6 years following declaration of pandemic in 2009. The cumulative post marketing reports 
of important identified and potential risks listed in the Focetria Risk Management Plan up to the data lock 
point of 30 November 2018 are presented. 
Overall, AEs relevant to the important identified or potential risks were reported in very small numbers 
in children 6 months to <6 years of age vaccinated with Focetria. Convulsion is the only event with a 
reporting frequency greater than 1 per 100,000 vaccinated children. 
Eighteen  reports  of  convulsion  were  retrieved  and  8  of  the  18  convulsion  reports  described  febrile 
seizures (i.e., reporting rate of 0.67 per 100 000 doses). Overall, the majority of reports of convulsions 
described confounding factors, such as prior history of seizure or underlying condition associated with 
seizure  activity,  concurrent  infections,  and  concomitant  vaccination.  No  report  was  associated  with 
neurologic sequelae following the convulsive episode. There was one case of febrile convulsions with a 
fatal outcome, and a brief summary of the case is described. 
Case ID PHHY2010AR35307 concerned a 2.5-year-old child vaccinated with 2 doses of Focetria. The child 
has a history of febrile seizure following childhood immunizations and seasonal influenza vaccine.  
On the same day after receipt of the second Focetria dose, the child developed fever and experienced a 
convulsive  episode  that  lasted  two  hours.  The  patient  was  treated  with  diazepam  and  then  with 
phenytoin. During the transfer to the hospital the child experienced a cardio-respiratory arrest that lasted 
for  15  minutes  and  lead  to  encephalic  death.  The  child  lived  in  a  rural  area  with  limited  emergency

medical  service.  The  fatal  outcome  seems  to  be  primarily  attributable  to  the  lack  of  appropriate  and 
timely medical assistance.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety (paediatric indication) 
In the initial submission, the Applicant sought a paediatric indication for children 6 to < 72 months of 
age. Following the responses of the D180 LoOI the Applicant tightened the age indication to children 6 
to < 24 months of age. The paediatric indication was withdrawn by the Applicant within the responses 
of the 2nd D180 LoOI. 
The total number of subjects 6 to <72 months of age exposed to aQIV in the pivotal study V118_05 
was 5,339, this is above the 3,000 subjects recommended in the Guideline for Influenza Vaccines 
(EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014), and constitutes an adequate safety database on itself. The study was 
performed in agreement with PIP EMEA-001715-PIP01-14-M01.  
In addition, the applicant has submitted supportive data from clinical studies with Fluad, an adjuvanted 
trivalent influenza vaccine (aTIV), performed in children 6 to <72 months of age. 
The safety database also includes two revaccination studies (V118_05E1 and V118_05E3) in which 
paediatric subjects that received aQIV in the pivotal study V118_05 were revaccinated with aQIV/QIV 
the following season.  
Supportive data is included in two pooled safety analyses. In the pivotal pooling, safety data from the 
pivotal aQIV study V118_05 and the pivotal aTIV study V70_29 are included. The reason for this 
pooling is the safety evaluation of infrequent adverse events. However, in general the pooled results 
are considered of limited value as the comparator non-adjuvanted vaccines were different in the 
different studies.  
Overall, 6,483 children were exposed to aQIV throughout the clinical studies, 3,647 children were 
exposed to the trivalent formulation aTIV and 7,692 to a comparator vaccine. The pivotal study in 
support of the paediatric indication included children at high risk of influenza due to underlying 
comorbidities. Children with compromised immune function were however excluded. 
Solicited Adverse Events 
The safety data from pivotal aQIV study V118_05 in subjects 6 to <72 months of age shows that the 
incidence of any solicited AEs is higher in subjects that were administered the aQIV vaccine compared 
to the non-adjuvanted vaccine after any vaccination (72.95% vs. 64.12%, respectively). The same 
pattern is also observed for any solicited local AEs, systemic AEs or other indicators of reactogenicity 
(use of antipyretics/analgesics). 
The most frequently reported solicited local AEs in both vaccine groups in the 6 to <72 months of age 
population were tenderness and erythema. The proportion of subjects with any tenderness was higher 
in the aQIV group (43.19%) than in the comparator group (33.86%) and a slightly higher proportion of 
subjects experienced moderate or severe tenderness, erythema or induration after aQIV as compared 
to the comparator. 
The most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs reported were irritability, sleepiness and change in 
eating habits in both aQIV and comparator vaccine groups.  
Assessment report

The proportion of subjects with reported irritability, sleepiness and change in eating habits was slightly 
higher in aQIV than comparator vaccine. A low proportion of subjects reported severe irritability, 
sleepiness, and change in eating habits. 
In the aQIV group a greater proportion of subjects experienced fever ≥38°C than in the comparator 
vaccine group (19.1% vs. 10.5%), fever ≥39.0°C to <40°C was also reported in a higher proportion in 
subjects in the aQIV group than in the comparator group (4.1% vs. 2.3%). A low percentage of 
subjects had body temperature ≥40°C, which was similar for both vaccine groups (0.4% aQIV, 0.3% 
comparator vaccine group). The therapeutic use of analgesics/antipyretics was higher with aQIV as 
well (aQIV: 29.89%; comparator: 17.94%). 
Within vaccine naïve subjects, that received two doses of the vaccine, the proportion of subjects with 
any solicited local and systemic AE after vaccination 2 was higher for the aQIV group than for the 
comparator group. 
Although infrequent, the number of subjects reporting moderate to severe solicited AEs was higher in 
the groups that received the aQIV vaccine. 
In the two aQIV revaccination studies similar to the results obtained in pivotal aQIV study, 
reactogenicity (local and systemic) was consistently higher after vaccination with aQIV than with the 
comparator vaccine.  
The applicant concluded that the observed increased reactogenicity is to be expected for an adjuvanted 
vaccine. Data from the three independent aQIV studies consistently demonstrates that the aQIV 
vaccine causes significantly more local and systemic adverse events than the non adjuvanted 
comparator vaccine in the paediatric population. Further, in pivotal study V118_05 the severity of 
practically all the local and systemic adverse events is higher in the recipients of the aQIV vaccine. The 
small differences in frequencies of moderate-to-severe solicited AEs, and the fact that the majority 
spontaneously resolved within 3 to 4 days, make these findings not clinically significant. This 
conclusion is not supported, and since an improved clinical efficacy of the aQIV vaccine has not been 
demonstrated this increased reactogenicity upholds the negative benefit risk balance of the aQIV 
vaccine for the paediatric population. 
In revaccination study V118_05_E03 the proportion of subjects with solicited AEs, was higher with 
aQIV compared to QIV, regardless of the vaccine allocation (aQIV or non adjuvanted comparator) in 
the parent study. This increased proportion solicited AEs is more marked when the aQIV groups are 
combined. In this study the incidence of any solicited AE was clearly higher in subjects in the 
aQIV/aQIV group compared with the QIV/QIV group (64.76% vs. 40.71%).  
Additionally, in this study 21.6% of subjects who received an aQIV two years in a row reported fever 
compared to 11.7% of subjects who received an aQIV after having received a non-adjuvanted vaccine 
in the year previous. In those who received a non-adjuvanted vaccine, the fever rate was 
approximately 7.5%. For other systemic reactions a similar pattern was seen, with higher rates in 
subjects who received aQIV two years in a row compared to those who received aQIV following a non-
adjuvanted vaccine in the year previous. Although the majority of reactions were mild, this is a 
potential safety signal with implications for the B/R of annual revaccination with aQIV and required 
further investigation. The applicant points to inconsistency in fever rates between the revaccination 
studies (on different seasons) suggesting that the fever rates in study V118_05E3 might not be 
representative.  
Although systemic reactions were mostly mild, an aQIV/aQIV regimen resulted in higher systemic 
reactogenicity as compared to an aQIV/QIV regimen but also as compared to an QIV/aQIV regimen. 
This may translate into an increased rate of more severe reactions to revaccination with aQIV as 
compared to initial vaccination with aQIV or revaccination with QIV following priming with aQIV, yet 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 162/194 
 
 
 
this cannot be determined based on the available data. Nonetheless, an increase in reactogenicity of 
this magnitude could only be acceptable if there is clear evidence of an additional benefit. As this 
increased reactogenicity is not off set by a clear and consistent immunological benefit of revaccination 
with aQIV the B/R of annual revaccination with aQIV in children is considered negative.  
Unsolicited AEs /SAEs 
The proportion of unsolicited AEs in pivotal aQIV study V118_05 during the treatment period was 
similar for the aQIV and comparator groups (49.91% versus 50.05%). The most frequently reported 
unsolicited AEs included ILI, upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis. 
The proportion of possibly related unsolicited AEs was slightly higher in the aQIV group than the 
comparator group during the treatment period (12.76% vs. 10.08%) as well as during the overall 
study period (13.08% for vs. 10.33%). The most frequently reported related AE during the treatment 
period was ILI. 
In study V118_05 severe AEs were reported in a 4.46% for both vaccine groups. Possible/probably 
related SAEs according to the investigator were reported in 6 subjects in aQIV group and in 1 subject 
in comparator vaccine group.  
In the Pivotal Pooling the proportion of subjects that experienced at least one SAE was similar in the 
adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccine groups. One additional related SAE identified in the aTIV 
group was reported, therefore from the 8 SAEs related to the vaccine 7 was in the aQIV/aTIV group. 
The majority of SAEs was reported in the SOC Infections and infestations. The most frequently 
reported PTs were pneumonia, animal bite, and gastroenteritis. 
The applicant’s conclusion is that an increased risk of related AEs or SAEs has not been identified for 
the aQIV vaccine since differences in risk ratios between aQIV/aTIV and QIV-1/TIV-1 groups were not 
statistically significant. This conclusion was not entirely supported. In response to the request to 
discuss of these findings the applicant confirmed that in study V118_05 the frequency of related 
unsolicited AEs was higher in the aQIV group than the comparator group (13.08% vs 10.33%) and 
that the proportion of possibly or probably related severe AEs was 0.11% in the aQIV group and 
0.02% in the comparator group. The differences are confirmed but the small number of events 
recorded renders them inconclusive.  
There were no vaccine-related deaths throughout the clinical studies.  
AES leading to Withdrawal from Study Drug 
In the pivotal study 19 subjects, reported AEs leading to premature withdrawal. Four cases were due 
to deaths that were unrelated to the vaccines. Five subjects experienced SAEs of which 3 cases were 
related to study vaccine (all in the aQIV group). Of the 10 non-serious AEs, 4 were related to study 
vaccine in the aQIV group and 3 in the comparator group. The 4 related non-serious cases in the aQIV 
group included peripheral swelling and rash (same subject), injection site pruritus, ILI, and 
hypersensitivity; the 3 related cases in the comparator group included sleep terror, injection site pain 
and ILI. In the SOC Immune system disorders, there were 4 SAE reported in the aQIV group and none 
in the comparator group, all cases were reported in study V118_05.  
Only 6 more cases (25 in total) of AEs that led to vaccine or study withdrawal were reported in the 
pivotal pooling. Of these 7 AEs were considered related to vaccination by the investigator in the 
aQIV/aTIV group and 3 AEs in the QIV 1/TIV 1 group. Of the related AEs in the QIV-1/TIV-1 group 
“sleep terror” was considered to be an AE related to the vaccine and not to the vaccine 
“administration”. However, the observed relative risk differences between aQIV/aTIV and comparator 
vaccines for related AEs leading to discontinuation was no statistically significant.

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
In study V118_05, 9 AESIs were reported after vaccination: 5 AESIs in the aQIV group and 4 in the 
comparator group. In the Pivotal Pooling, the overall incidence of retrospectively identified AESIs was 
≤0.2% in each vaccine group. Of the 12 cases reported, 7 were identified in the aQIV/aTIV group and 
5 in the QIV-1/TIV-1 group. The identified AESIs in pivotal study V118_05, were unlikely to be causally 
related to the vaccine. 
Five AESIs were reported after vaccination with aQIV (Henoch-Schönlein purpura, Crohn’s disease, 
Type I diabetes mellitus, Kawasaki’s disease and Encephalitis autoimmune) and four after vaccination 
with comparator vaccines in the pivotal studies (Type I diabetes mellitus, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, 
Immune thrombocytopenia and Coeliac Disease). In the revaccination studies an additional three 
AESIs were reported, one in the aQIV group (Immune thrombocytopenic purpura), and two in the QIV 
group (Type I diabetes mellitus and Kawasaki). The applicant indicated that none of these events were 
related to the vaccines. For a case of Kawasaki disease there was an error in the original CSR 
regarding the relation to the vaccine. This was corrected in the CSR addendum. The issue was 
considered resolved provided that future potential cases of Kawasaki’s disease will be monitored via 
routine pharmacovigilance activities (including signal detection and the PSURs).  
The pivotal pooling doesn’t add any information as 11 of the 12 retrospectively identified AESIs were 
reported in the pivotal aQIV study (7 in aQIV, 4 QIV) and only 1 AESI (in the TIV group) was 
retrospectively found in supportive aTIV study.  
Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFIs)  
Due to their low frequency AEFIs were analysed in the Pivotal Pooling which integrated data from 
pivotal study V118_05 with aQIV and aTIV supportive study V70_29. 
In subjects 6 to <72 months of age AEFIs were identified in 20 subjects (0.2%) in the aQIV/aTIV 
group and 12 (0.2%) in the QIV-1/TIV-1 group. Of those the majority were included in the 
hypersensitivity category: 16 (0.2%) in the aQIV/aTIV group and 11 (0.2%) in the QIV-1/TIV-1 group. 
Of the 8 SAEs reported in subjects aged 6 to <72 months in the aQIV/aTIV group considered by the 
study investigator to be at least possibly related to the study vaccine six cases were hypersensitivity 
type reactions. The assessment of the applicant, that “the nature and severity of these related 
hypersensitivity-like SAEs events did not raise any safety concerns with aQIV” it is not completely 
endorsed. 
Although reactions were varied in timing in relation to vaccination and in appearance, there was an 
imbalanced reporting of serious hypersensitivity reactions following aQIV compared to comparator 
vaccines. This could be coincidental, however it cannot be excluded, based upon the available data, 
that vaccination with aQIV might increase the risk of hypersensitivity and this would indeed raise a 
safety concern. The listing of these reactions in the SmPC is acknowledged however further monitoring 
via routine pharmacovigilance is required.  
The applicant was asked to address the increased number of hypersensitivity-like potentially related 
SAEs associated to the aQIV/aTIV vaccines, to review reports of hypersensitivity reactions with MF59 
adjuvanted influenza vaccines, and to examine if there are potential factors that might predict the risk. 
Based upon the information provided by the applicant it is concluded that there is no evidence of an 
increased risk of anaphylactic reactions associated with MF59 adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine 
(A/H1N1pdm09) in children, neither is evidence of an increased risk of anaphylactic reactions 
associated with MF59 seasonal influenza vaccine in older adults. The applicant’s plan to analyse 
hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis in future PSURs is agreed.

Regarding febrile convulsions in subjects 6 to <72 months 4 cases (<0.1%) were reported in the 
aQIV/aTIV group and 1 case (<0.1%) in QIV-1/TIV-1 group. Three cases were considered possibly 
related to aQIV/aTIV, all occurred within a week of vaccination. Although there were factors for each 
case that could have contributed to the occurrence of the febrile convulsion, it cannot be excluded that 
vaccination with aQIV may have contributed as well. Moreover, from the pivotal pooling it appears that 
the risk is slightly higher following aQIV/aTIV (n=26, 0.3%) compared to QIV/TIV (n=10, 0.1%) with a 
RR of 1.85 (0.89-3.85). The risk ratios of febrile convulsions in the aQIV/aTIV group as compared to 
QIV-1/TIV-1 group did not reach statistical significance due to the low numbers reported. The applicant 
states that the reported febrile convulsions were temporally associated with the vaccination, but 
additional comorbidities were reported for 4 of the 5 cases and that it cannot be excluded their 
potential contribution to the incidence of febrile convulsion. As such, the applicant concludes it is not 
possible to attribute an increased risk for febrile convulsions, to the aQIV vaccine. The draft SmPC 
submitted as part of the initial dossier included Febrile convulsions as listed AE. Following withdrawal 
of the paediatric indication, the agreed SmPC does not include febrile convulsion. 
As requested the applicant provided new tables in which infrequent events, if there were events 
recorded, the percentages were displayed as <0.1% rather than 0.0%.  
New Onset of Chronic Disease  
In study V118_05, the proportion of subjects reporting unsolicited AEs leading to NOCD as assessed by 
the investigator was similar for the aQIV group and comparator vaccine groups (<2%). The most 
frequently reported NOCDs during the overall period were asthma, seasonal allergy and attention 
deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The incidence of theses NOCDs was similar in both vaccine groups. 
Overall, the nature and frequency of these clinical symptoms that are reported as NOCDs does not 
constitute a risk associated with aQIV/aTIV. 
Subjects at high risk of influenza complications 
In Study V118_05, an 8.7% of the subjects were considered to be at high risk of influenza 
complications (aQIV: 8.8%, comparator vaccine group: 8.6%). No difference apparent was observed in 
the group of subjects at high risk of influenza complications.  
Age, Race etc. 
The impact of age on the rate of solicited adverse events is variable dependent on the type of solicited 
AE and there is no overall pattern of a relative increase in solicited adverse events in younger children. 
The fever rates are similar over all age groups in the aQIV recipients, ranging from 17.8% and 20.3%, 
whilst the rates increase with decreasing age in the non-adjuvanted vaccine group. 
Safety data for males and females was similar for both vaccine groups.  
The safety of the aQIV or the aTIV vaccines in immunocompromised subjects 6 to <72 months of age 
has not been studied.  
No safety data related to the interaction of aQIV or aTIV vaccines with other vaccines administered to 
children 6 to 72 months of age has been provided. The reactogenicity of the aQIV vaccine could be 
further increased when co-administered with other vaccines, this should be clearly indicated in the 
SmPC. 
Post-marketing studies 
Only approximately 4000 doses of the trivalent adjuvanted vaccine Fluad have been administered in 
children 6 months to <6 years of age, authorized in Canada. As supportive data the applicant has 
presented the post-marketing safety data from the adjuvanted pandemic vaccine aH1N1 Focetria that 
contains one of the four strains (A/H1N1) of influenza virus included in the aQIV formulation and is 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 165/194 
 
 
 
adjuvanted with MF59. Approximately 1.2 million doses of Focetria were administered in children aged 
6 months to <6 years in 2009. The results show that convulsion is the most commonly reported AE 
and the only event with a reporting frequency greater than 1 per 100,000 vaccinated children. These 
results are consistent with the findings reported in the aQIV of clinical trials in which a higher 
proportion of febrile convulsions have been identified in the aQIV group than in the comparator 
vaccine. In one of the reported Focetria cases a 2.5 year old child after receipt of the second Focetria 
dose developed fever and experienced a long lasting convulsive episode that lead to death. The 
applicant agrees that postvaccination reaction and febrile convulsion will be events of interest requiring 
close monitoring in a postmarketing setting, although no specific safety concern has been observed to 
date. It is planning to conduct monitoring for the occurrence of febrile convulsion through routine 
postmarketing surveillance complemented by enhanced safety surveillance (EMA/PRAC/222346/2014). 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety (paediatric indication) 
The safety data from the three independent aQIV studies consistently demonstrates that in children >6 
to <72 months the aQIV vaccine causes more local and systemic adverse events that the non-
adjuvanted comparator vaccine. Of note high fever is more frequent in children that received the aQIV 
vaccine. Further, the severity of the local and systemic adverse events tends to be higher in the 
recipients of the aQIV vaccine.  
In addition, the differences in reactogenicity between the aQIV group and the comparator group are 
amplified when the aQIV vaccine is administered the following season. A potential signal of increased 
reactions in subjects who received aQIV in two subsequent years is of concern. As this increased 
reactogenicity is not offset by a clear and consistent immunological benefit of revaccination with aQIV, 
the B/R of annual revaccination with aQIV in children is considered negative.  
When looking at total number of cases, although not statistically significant, an increase risk of 
unsolicited AEs and SAEs related to the vaccine, for example hypersensitivity reactions and febrile 
convulsions, is observed in children vaccinated with the aQIV vaccine in comparison with those that 
received the non-adjuvanted QIV vaccine. However, these reactions occur very rarely (<0.1%).  
Since a superior clinical efficacy of the aQIV vaccine against influenza infection has not been 
demonstrated the increase in proportion and severity of local and systemic solicited adverse events 
associated to the administration of aQIV upholds the negative benefit risk balance of the aQIV vaccine 
for the paediatric population. 
2.7.  Clinical safety (elderly indication) 
Patient exposure 
The Phase III pivotal study, V118_20, comparing aQIV versus the adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccines 
(aTIV-1, Fluad) and aTIV-2 (containing the alternate B strain), enrolled 1,778 subjects, of which 888 
were exposed to aQIV, 444 subjects to aTIV-1 and 444 subjects to aTIV-2. 
Overall, 6,790 subjects were enrolled in the Phase III study, V118_18. Of these, 6,761 subjects were 
exposed  to  study  treatment  with  a  similar  number  of  subjects  exposed  to  aQIV  and  non-  influenza 
comparator, Boostrix (3381 received aQIV and 3380 received Boostrix). Most enrolled subjects (96.3%) 
completed the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 166/194 
 
 
 
For the safety evaluation, a subset of 1,332 subjects had solicited safety assessments beyond 30 minutes 
and were included in the Solicited Safety Set. Overall, 6,757 exposed subjects provided unsolicited safety 
data and were included in the Unsolicited Safety Set. 
Therefore,  the  study  V118_18  provides  additional  safety  data  and  contributes  to  increase  the  safety 
database  including  665  subjects  ≥  65  years  of  age  exposed  to  aQIV  to  be  assessed  for  the  solicited 
safety subset, and 3,380 subjects for the assessment of Unsolicited AEs, SAEs and deaths, NOCDs, and 
AESI. The proportion of subjects included in the safety analysis sets was similar between aQIV and non-
influenza vaccine comparator Boostrix. 
The study V70_27, comparing aTIV versus the registered non-adjuvanted TIV (Agriflu) enrolled 7,109 
subjects, of which 7,082 were exposed to the study vaccines, being 3,545 exposed to aTIV (Fluad) and 
3,537 to TIV (Agriflu).  
Safety data from revaccination studies with aTIV were pooled by year of vaccination and included all the 
subjects who had received the vaccination in Year 1. Subjects from Year 1 were invited to participate in 
an annual revaccination study for 2 (Year 2) or 3 (Year 3) consecutive seasons and received the same 
vaccine upon revaccination.  
1,214 subjects included in studies V7P3, V7P5, V7P7, V7P8, V7P25 received Vaccination 1 (Year 1). 822 
of them were included in the respective extension studies (V7P3X1, V7P5X1, V7P7X1, V7P8X1, V7P25X1) 
for Year 2. 237 of them received the third vaccination (Year 3: V7P3X2, V7P5X2). The number of subjects 
exposed to aTIV or TIV in Years 1, 2 or 3 are summarized in the Table below.

Demographics and Other Characteristics of Study Population 
Demographic and baseline characteristics data for studies V118_20, V118_18 and V70_27 are presented 
individually. For the 12 supportive aTIV studies included in the revaccination pooling, demographic and 
baseline characteristics data are presented as an integrated summary. 
Study V118_20 
Demography 
There  were  no  notable  differences  observed  in  the  baseline  characteristics  and  demographics  across 
vaccine groups in the overall enrolled population. The median age was 71 years overall with a minimum 
age of 65 years, and a maximum age of 97 years.  
Study V118_20 was conducted in the US. The majority of the enrolled subjects were female (56.6%) 
and predominantly white (91.6%) and non-hispanic (92.5%). The majority of subjects (68.8%) were 65 
to 74 years of age and only 3.3% of all subjects were ≥85 years of age.

Medical History 
The  97.7%  subjects  had  at  least  1 disorder  recorded  in  their  medical  history.  Prior  medical  disorders 
were  reported  in  similar  proportions  of  subjects  across  vaccine  groups  (aQIV  97.8%,  aTIV-1  97.3%, 
aTIV-2 98%).  
The  most  common  disorders  in  medical  histories  were  vascular  disorders  63.0%;  metabolism  and 
nutrition  disorders  59.4%;  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  54.6%;  immune  system 
disorders 42.4%; gastrointestinal disorders 40.5%; and eye disorders 37.8%. 
Concomitant Use of Medications 
From the 1778 (100%) subjects enrolled in the study no major differences were seen between vaccine 
groups.  However,  the  aTIV-1  group  had  a  higher  average  number  of  subjects  taking  medications 
compared to the aQIV and aTIV-2 vaccine groups. 
The frequency of medications used was generally similar across groups. 
Study V118_18 
Demography 
Study V118_18 was conducted in total at 89 sites in 12 countries. Overall, the demographic and baseline 
characteristics of subjects enrolled in this study were well balanced between the two vaccine groups with 
similar age, sex, ethnicity, race, and BMI. The mean age was 71.9 years and 71% of subjects were in 
the 65-74 year age group. 
More than half of the subjects were female (61.8%). The majority of subjects were either White (48.2%) 
or Asian (33.8%).

Notes: 
Percentages are based on the number of subjects in each vaccine group.  
Influenza vaccination history collected for past 5 years. 
Medical History 
All the subjects enrolled were healthy or had co-morbidities. At least one medical disorder in medical 
history  was  reported  for  6151  (90.6%)  subjects;  the  percentages  of  subjects  with  medical  disorders 
were similar in the two vaccine groups. Twenty seven percent (27.2%) of subjects had a comorbidity 
score ≥ 50. Most of the subjects were non-smokers (90.3%). 
Concomitant Use of Medications 
All subjects in aQIV and Boostrix groups used at least one concomitant medication. Of these, 41.2% and 
39.4% of subjects in the aQIV and Boostrix groups, respectively, received at least one unique medication. 
The concomitant medications taken were generally similar across both vaccine groups.  
A higher number of subjects had not received a seasonal influenza vaccine in the past 5 years (70.4%).  
Study V70_27 
Demography 
There  were  no  differences  observed  in  the  baseline  characteristics  and  demographics  across  vaccine 
groups in the overall enrolled population.  
Study V70_27 was conducted in the Philippines, US, Colombia, and Panama. The majority of the enrolled 
subjects were female (65%) and predominantly Asian (53%) and White (28%).  
The median age was 71 years overall with a minimum age of 65 years, and a maximum age of 97 years. 
The study was stratified in two age groups (65 to 74 years and 75 to 84  years), as seen in Table 1-
6).The majority of subjects (72%) were 65 to 74 years of age.

Medical History 
The  medical  history  conditions  were  similar  between  vaccine  groups  (i.e.,  within  1-2%).  The  most 
frequently reported medical history conditions in the total subject population were essential hypertension 
(55%), disorders of lipid metabolism (26%) and other postsurgical states (25%). 
Concomitant Use of Medications 
The majority of subjects in both vaccine groups in study V70_27 reported use of one or more concomitant 
medications (73% of subjects). Percentages of subjects receiving each of these concomitant medications 
were similar between vaccine groups.

Adverse events 
The collection of safety data in clinical studies with aQIV and aTIV included an evaluation of solicited and 
unsolicited adverse events (AEs), AEs leading to study withdrawal, Serious AEs (SAEs), AEs of special 
interest (AESIs), and new onset chronic diseases (NOCDs). 
Solicited AEs: Solicited AEs were predefined and were categorized as local AEs, systemic AEs and any 
use of antipyretics/analgesic for prevention or treatment of pain and/or fever.  
In  studies  V118_20,  V118_18  and  V70_27,  solicited  AEs  were  recorded  at  approximately  30  minutes 
after  vaccination  and  then  daily  from  6  hours  following  vaccination  until  Day  7.  Solicited  local  and 
systemic  AEs  reported  within  7  days  of  vaccination  were  considered  as  related  to  vaccination  and 
therefore are reported as adverse reactions. 
Unsolicited AEs: All unsolicited AEs were collected for 3 weeks (Day 1 to Day 22) after vaccination in 
studies V118_20, V118_18 and V70_27. Solicited AEs that were ongoing at 4 or 7 days after vaccination 
were to be recorded as unsolicited AEs. Unsolicited AEs were followed until resolution. The severity and 
the relationship to the study vaccine were determined by the investigator. 
In addition, AESIs (for study V118_20 and V118_18) and NOCDs (for studies V118_20, V118_18 and 
V70_27) were collected prospectively during the overall study period. SAE, AEs leading to withdrawal, 
AESIs and AEs leading to NOCD were collected for a 6 month period in study V118_20 and a 12 month 
period in study V118_18 and V70_27.  
The applicant has submitted the list of events considered AESIs for study V118_20. 
An overview of AEs for studies V118_20, V118_18, and V70_27 is provided below in Table 66.

Solicited Adverse Events 
Study V118_20 
The percentage of subjects with any solicited AE reported from Day 1 to Day 7 after vaccination was 
51.8% in the aQIV group, 48.7% in the aTIV-1 group, and 48.2% in the aTIV-2 group. 
At least 1 local solicited local AE (43.6%, 38.7% and 38.1% in the aQIV, aTIV-1, and aTIV-2 groups, 
respectively), and at least 1 solicited systemic AE (26.2%, 24.4% and 25.1% in the aQIV, aTIV-1, and 
aTIV-2 groups, respectively) were reported by a slightly higher percentage of subjects receiving aQIV 
than those who received the aTIV comparators.  
The most commonly reported local solicited AEs were any injection site pain (31.9%,28.1% and 25.5% 
in the aQIV, aTIV-1, and aTIV-2 groups, respectively), followed by erythema (7.6%, 7.4%, and 8.6% in 
the aQIV, aTIV-1, and aTIV-2 groups, respectively) and induration (7%, 5.4%, and 5.3% in the aQIV, 
aTIV-1, and aTIV-2 groups, respectively). 
The most commonly reported systemic solicited AEs were fatigue (16.0% 15.4% and 11.6% in the aQIV, 
aTIV-1,  and  aTIV-2  groups,  respectively),  headache  (12.0%,  10.6%  and  11.3%  in  the  aQIV,  aTIV-1, 
and aTIV-2 groups, respectively), and arthralgia (9.1%, 8.5% and 7.1% in the aQIV, aTIV-1, and aTIV-
2 groups, respectively). 
Most solicited reactions (local and systemic) were reported as mild to moderate in severity. Few severe 
solicited  AEs  were  reported  in  any  group,  being  all  of  them  below  1%,  except  for  fatigue  in  the 
comparator aTIV-2 (1.4%).  
Analgesics and/or antipyretics for prevention or treatment of pain and/or fever were taken by 5.4% of 
the subjects in the aQIV group versus 2.7 to 3.9% of the subjects in both aTIV comparator groups. 
Study V118_18 
Subjects who were vaccinated with a single dose of aQIV or non-influenza comparator on Day 1 were 
observed for at least 30 minutes post vaccination on Day 1 for any immediate reactions. 
A subset of randomly selected subjects (1053 per vaccine group, assuming a 5% drop-out rate) were 
chosen to participate in a solicited safety subset. They were asked to fill out the Subject Diary cards from 
Day 1 to 7. Data from 665 and 667 subjects receiving aQIV and Boostrix respectively were obtained to 
assess the solicited adverse events. 
The  percentage  of  subjects  with  any  solicited  AE  reported  from  Day  1  (6  hours)  through  Day  7  after 
vaccination was 34.3% in the aQIV group and 32.2% in the Boostrix group. 
The proportions of subjects with local and systemic AEs were slightly higher in the aQIV group compared 
to the Boostrix group (24.4% vs. 19.6% for local reactions, and 19.2% vs. 16.3% for systemic reactions, 
respectively, see table 2-1 from 2.4.7 Summary of clinical safety). 
The majority of local AEs were of mild or moderate intensity. The frequency of severe solicited AEs was 
low and similar in both vaccine groups (0 to 0.5% for local reactions in both vaccine groups, and 0% to 
1.1% for aQIV and 0.2% to 0.6% for Boostrix for systemic reactions). 
The most common local solicited AE was injection site pain, (16.3% and 11.2% in the aQIV and Boostrix 
groups,  respectively),  followed  by  erythema  (10.8%  and  10.5%  in  the  aQIV  and  Boostrix  groups, 
respectively) and induration (10.3 and 7.9% % in the aQIV and Boostrix groups, respectively). 
The most commonly reported systemic solicited AEs were headache (10.8% and 8.3% in the aQIV, and 
Boostrix groups, respectively), fatigue (10.5% and 8.8% in the aQIV and Boostrix groups, respectively), 
and myalgia (7.7 and 6.1% in the aQIV and Boostrix groups, respectively).

Other indicators of reactogenicity, defined as use of antipyretics/analgesic for prevention of pain and/or 
fever within 7 days after vaccination was reported by 4.7% and 2.5% subjects in the aQIV and Boostrix 
groups, respectively. Overall, 3.8% and 2.8% of subjects in the aQIV and Boostrix vaccine groups used 
antipyretics/analgesics for treatment of pain and/or fever, respectively. 
Study V70_27 
The incidence of solicited AEs was higher in the aTIV group (46%) compared to the TIV group (33%).  
At least 1 local solicited local AEs (aTIV, 32% versus TIV, 17%), and at least 1 solicited systemic AEs 
(aTIV,  32%  versus  TIV,  26%)  were  reported  by  a  higher  percentage  of  subjects  receiving  aTIV  than 
those who received the TIV. See table 2-4 and 2-5 from 2.4.7 Summary of Clinical Safety. 
The most commonly reported local solicited AEs were any injection site pain (aTIV, 29% versus TIV 12%) 
followed by tenderness (21%, and 11% in the aTIV and TIV respectively). Erythema, induration, and 
swelling (>25 mm in diameter) were reported by ≤1% of subjects in both groups during that period 
The most commonly reported systemic solicited AEs were myalgia (15% and 10% in the aTIV and TIV 
groups, respectively), headache (13% and 11% in the aTIV and TIV groups, respectively), and fatigue 
(13% and 10% in the aTIV and TIV groups, respectively). Overall the incidence of fever was comparable 
between aTIV and TIV (3.6 % versus 3.4%). Most solicited reactions (local and systemic) were mild to 
moderate in severity. There were a few severe solicited AE in any group, all of them were reported to be 
≤1%, severe fever (≥40ºC) was noted in 3 subjects (0.3%) in the aTIV group and 0 subjects in the TIV 
group. Most of the solicited local reactions were resolved by day 4 and were of mild or moderate intensity. 
Furthermore, the use of analgesics/antipyretics (5% versus 4%) was low and similar between the aTIV 
and TIV groups, respectively. 
Unsolicited Adverse Events 
Study V118_20 
In study V118_20, there were no notable imbalances in the percentages of subjects reporting unsolicited 
AEs in the aQIV, aTIV-1 and aTIV-2 vaccine groups.  
At least 1 unsolicited AE was reported during the entire study period by 19.8% of subjects in the aQIV 
group .The most commonly reported AE (≥1%) by preferred term (PT) were influenza-like-illness (aQIV, 
2% versus aTIV-1, 2.7% versus aTIV-2, 2.9%), injection site bruising (aQIV, 1.1% versus aTIV-1, 1.4% 
versus aTIV-2, 1.4%), injection site erythema (aQIV, 0.7% versus aTIV-1, 0.9% versus aTIV-2, 1.1%), 
upper respiratory tract infection (aQIV, 0.7% versus aTIV-1, 0.9% versus aTIV-2, 1.1%) and headache 
(aQIV,  0.6%  versus  aTIV-1,  0.7%  versus  aTIV-2,  1.8%).  The  percentage  of  subjects  with  possibly 
related unsolicited AEs were comparable across the vaccine groups (aQIV, 4.4% aTIV-1, 3.8% versus 
aTIV-2,  4.3%).  In  the  aQIV  group,  unsolicited  AEs  considered  possibly  related  to  treatment  included 
injection site bruising (1.0%), injection site erythema (0.7%), injection site induration (0.5%), injection 
site pruritus (0.5%), fatigue (0.3%) arthralgia (0.3%), myalgia (0.2%), headache (0.2%), and diarrhoea 
(0.3%).

Study V118_18 
For all subjects, any unsolicited AE and concomitant medication use, after vaccination from Day 1 to Day 
22 were collected. The percentage of subjects having unsolicited AEs was calculated from 3380 and 3377 
subjects exposed to aQIV and Boostrix respectively. 
The  proportion  of  subjects  with  unsolicited  AEs  during  the  treatment  period  was  similar  between  the 
vaccine groups (21.5% in aQIV group and 21.2% in Boostrix group). Most of them were reported as mild 
or moderate in severity. The proportion of subjects with unsolicited AEs that were assessed as related 
to the study vaccine were similar, although slightly higher in aQIV vs the Boostrix group (9.0% vs 7.7%, 
respectively, see Table 38). 
The most frequently reported unsolicited AEs by System Organ Class (SOC) in the aQIV and Boostrix 
groups  were  General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (10.7%  and  9.7%,  respectively); 
Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (4.7%  and  3.4%,  respectively)  and  Infections  and 
infestations (3.6% and 3.4%, respectively) 
The most frequently reported unsolicited AE by Preferred Term (PT) in the aQIV and Boostrix groups was 
ILI (4.6%). 
Study V70_27 
In study V70_27, At least one unsolicited AE was reported by 16% of the subjects in both groups. See 
table 2-7 from 2.4.7 Summary of Clinical Safety). 
The most commonly reported AES (≥1%) by preferred term were nasopharyngitis (aTIV, 2% versus TIV, 
2%),  headache  (1%  versus  2%),  cough  (1%  per  group),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (1%  per 
group), and dizziness (1% per group). All other AEs had a frequency of <1%. The percentage of subjects 
with possibly related unsolicited AEs were comparable across the vaccine groups (aTIV, 4% versus TIV, 
5%). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In  study  V118_20,  subjects  were  followed  for  SAEs  from  Day  1  to  Day  181  following  vaccination.  In 
study V118_18 and V70_27, subjects were followed for SAEs through Day 366 following vaccination. 
Study V118_20 
Deaths 
A total of 2 subjects experienced SAEs with outcomes of death. Both deaths occurred in the aQIV group. 
The first case occurred 115 days after vaccination (08-02-2018), the second had an unknown onset day 
however was reported to occur in 01-2018. Both cases were considered not related to the study vaccine. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
Overall, 83 (4.7%) subjects had at least 1 SAE during the study (4.2% of subjects in the aQIV group, 
6.3% in aTIV-1 group and 4.1% in aTIV-2 group). In total, 114 SAEs were reported in the study.  
The  most  common  SAEs  by  SOC  included  “infections  and  infestations”,  “cardiac  disorders”, 
“gastrointestinal disorders” but in each group the percentages of subjects were below 1%. 
No SAEs were assessed as related to the study vaccines.

Adverse Events leading to New Onset of Chronic Disease  
The percentages of subjects who reported a new onset of Chronic Disease (NOCDs) were similar across 
the study groups (2.6% of subjects in the aQIV group, 3.6% in aTIV-1 group and 3.2% in aTIV-2 group). 
None of these events were considered related to the study vaccine 
The  most  common  SOCs  for  these  were  “Cardiac  disorders”  (0.5%  to  0.9%  subjects  across  study 
groups),  “Musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders”  (0.3%  to  1.1%)  and  “renal  and  urinary 
disorders” (0.2% to 0.7%). No imbalance between study groups was observed and the percentages of 
subjects were below 1% in each group. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
In study V118_20, a total of 2 (0.1%) subjects had a reported AESI in the study; both AESIs occurred 
during the follow-up study period (Day 23 through Day 181). One subject in the aTIV-1 group developed 
Addison’s  disease  and  one  subject  in  the  aQIV  group  had  polymyalgia  rheumatica,  both  cases,  the 
investigators conclude that these two AESIs were not related to the study vaccines. 
Study V118_18 
Deaths 
Sixty seven deaths (33 in the aQIV group and 34 in the Boostrix group) occurred during the study and 
were considered by the investigator to be unrelated to the study vaccines. 
Other Serious Adverse Events Two hundred thirty eight (7.0%) subjects in the aQIV group and 234 
(6.9%) subjects in the Boostrix group reported at least one SAE during the study period; the proportions 
of subject with SAEs were similar between the vaccine groups. 
One subject in the aQIV group experienced one SAE of rheumatoid arthritis. The event was considered 
moderate in intensity and possibly related to aQIV. One subject in the Boostrix group experienced two 
SAE,  acute  myocardial  infarction,  and  ILI.  Acute  myocardial  infarction  was  assessed  as  severe  and 
possibly related to the vaccine. ILI was assessed as mild and probably related to the vaccine. 
Adverse Events leading to New Onset of Chronic Disease (NOCDs) 
The frequencies of unsolicited AEs leading to NOCDs were similar in the vaccine groups (9.5% in the 
aQIV  and  9.0%  in  Boostrix  group).  AEs  were  heterogeneous  in  nature  and  consistent  with  clinical 
conditions spontaneously occurring in the elderly population. 
Three AEs, reported for subjects in the aQIV group, were assessed to be possibly related to the study 
vaccines; (non-serious hyperglycaemia and radiculopathy and moderate rheumatoid arthritis). 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
Four  subjects  in  the  aQIV  group  and  6  subjects  in  the  Boostrix  group  experienced  AESIs.  All  AESIs, 
except one event of rheumatoid arthritis experienced by one subject in the aQIV group, were considered 
not related to study treatment. 
Study V70_27 
Deaths 
A total of 98 subjects (1.4%) experienced SAEs with outcomes of death (52 subjects (1.5%) in the aTIV 
and 46 subjects (1.3%) in TIV). One subject (female, 70 years of age) who received the non adjuvanted 
TIV  vaccine  had  an  AE  of  Guillain-Barré  syndrome  (which  developed  227  days  after  vaccination) that 
eventually led to death and was assessed by the investigator as possibly related to the study vaccine. 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 179/194 
 
 
 
 
 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
The percentage of subjects reporting SAEs were comparable overall, with a rate of 7% in each vaccine 
group through 1 year following vaccination 
The  most  common  SAEs  by  SOC  included  “infections  and  infestations”  (2%  each  group),  “cardiac 
disorders” (2% each group), the rest of SOC were reported with a percentage of subjects ≤1% in each 
group.  
Adverse Events leading to New Onset of Chronic Disease  
The percentages of subjects who reported a new onset of Chronic Disease (NOCDs) were the same in 
the study groups (6% each). None of these events were considered related to the study vaccine. 
The most common SOCs for these were “vascular disorders”, “metabolism and nutrition disorders”, 
“musculoskeletal, connective tissue, and bone disorder” and “cardiac disorders” (1% in both groups for 
each of these categories).  
Laboratory findings 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluation 
Pivotal  study  V118_20  and  V118_18  did  not  include  scheduled  clinical  laboratory  assessments.  No 
laboratory  assessments  of  haematology,  blood  chemistry,  or  urine  chemistry  were  specified  in  the 
protocol.  
Pivotal  study  V70_27  included  clinical  laboratory  assessments  as  a  scheduled  safety  component.  A 
further subset of 200 subjects (n=97 aTIV, n=103 TIV) was selected for safety laboratory testing on Day 
1 (pre vaccination) and Day 8. Haematology tests included haemoglobin, platelet, red blood cell (RBC), 
and white blood cell (WBC) counts. Serum chemistry tests included alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and 
aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST).  No  clinically  meaningful  differences  in  group  mean  changes  from 
baseline were observed between or within vaccine groups for laboratory parameters. 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Overall, there were no clinically significant vital signs, physical findings, or other observations related to 
safety other than those reported as AEs or medical history 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic factor 
Assessment  of  safety  by  subgroup  is  presented  for  study  V118_20,  V118_18  and  V70_27.  Subgroup 
analyses were performed for age, gender and race. 
Age  
In  study  V118_20,  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  solicited  AEs  was  higher  in  the  age  group  65  to 
74 years compared to those aged between 75-84 years: 47.5% versus 35.8% in the aQIV group and 
27.7% versus 21.1% in the aTIV groups. In the age group ≥85 years rates with solicited were 38.7% 
and 32.3%. In study V118_18, the percentage of subjects with solicited AEs was higher in the age group 
65 to 74 years compared to those aged between 75-84 years: 37.9% versus 14.5% in the aQIV group. 
In the aTIV study V70_27, subjects >75 years of age reported fewer reactions than subjects 65 to 75 
years of age  
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 180/194 
 
 
 
 
Sex  
In study V118_20, females reported more AEs (61.6 % versus 52.5%). Solicited AEs were also reported 
more  frequently  by  females  compared  to  males:  48.4%  versus  37.7%  in  the  aQIV  group  and  29.6% 
versus 21.0% in the aTIV group. In study V118_18 solicited AEs were slightly higher in females: 34.3% 
versus 31.0%. Solicited local and systemic adverse events were not presented by sex for study V70_27. 
Unsolicited adverse events were reported by relatively more females (n=765, 17%) than males (n=356, 
14%).  
Extrinsic factors 
No subgroup analyses for extrinsic factors have been performed in study V118_20. 
Evaluation of safety was performed by country for solicited and unsolicited AEs in study V118_18 and 
for unsolicited AEs in study V70_27. Overall, no notable findings were observed across vaccine groups. 
Pregnancy and Lactation 
Since aQIV is proposed for indication in individuals ≥65 years of age, use in pregnancy and lactation is 
not applicable. aQIV has not been studied in pregnant or lactating women. Similarly, aTIV has not been 
studied in pregnant or lactating women. 
Immunological events 
No  cases  have  been  identified.  Overall,  no  safety  concerns  associated  with  vaccine-related 
hypersensitivity have been raised.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Pivotal aQIV study V118_20 and V118_18 were not designed to prospectively assess interactions with 
concomitant vaccinations or drugs. However, there are data regarding the concomitant administration 
of  Fluad  (aTIV  registered  vaccine)  with  an  approved  23-valent  pneumococcal  polysaccharide  vaccine 
(PPSV23) and an approved 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in older adults. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the study V118_20, no AEs leading to withdrawal were reported in the study  
In study V118_18, the proportion of subjects who experienced any unsolicited AE that led to premature 
withdrawal was similar between the vaccine groups (1.1%). One AE, pyrexia, reported in the aQIV group 
at Day 24 was considered assessed as possibly related to vaccination. 
In  study  V70_27,  in  each  vaccine  group,  approximately  1%  of  subjects  withdrew  from  the  study 
prematurely due to 1 or more AEs (52 subjects in the aTIV group and 49 subjects in the TIV group; CSR 
V70_27, Table 14.3.2.4). Most of these withdrawals occurred because of death (52 subjects in aTIV died 
and  46  subjects  in  TIV  died).  There  were  no  notable  differences  between  the  vaccine  groups  in 
percentages of subjects who withdrew  
Analysis of Adverse Events upon Annual Revaccination: aTIV Revaccination 
Pooling  
In the aTIV revaccination pooling studies, the assessment of the safety profile included 12 studies (5 
primary  and  7  revaccination  studies).  Subjects  who  received  Vaccination  1  but  did  not  receive  a 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 181/194 
 
 
 
 
subsequent vaccination in an extension study were also included in the pooling. The first (Vaccination 2) 
and second (Vaccination 3) revaccination dataset in the pooling only included data from a subgroup of 
subjects vaccinated in the primary vaccination study (Vaccination 1) who subsequently were enrolled in 
the revaccination studies. 
Vaccination 1 
Overall, solicited AEs after Vaccination 1 were higher in the aTIV group (41.5%) compared with the TIV 
group (34.8%). This difference was primarily due to the higher percentage of subjects reporting solicited 
local AEs in the aTIV group (22.9% aTIV versus 12.6% TIV). 
Solicited  systemic  AEs  were  similar  between  the  vaccine  groups  (15.1%  aTIV  versus  14.8%TIV). 
Unsolicited AEs were similar between the vaccine groups (17.8% aTIV and 21.0% TIV) as well as SAEs 
and AEs leading to hospitalization and SAEs leading to death. 
Vaccination 2 
The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  AEs  after  Vaccination  2  in  all  AE  categories  was  higher  after 
Vaccination  2  compared  to  Vaccination  1.  The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  solicited  AEs  were 
comparable in the aTIV and TIV groups (48.8% aTIV and 45.8% TIV).  
The percentage of subjects reporting unsolicited events after Vaccination 2 was 32.3% in the aTIV group 
and 41.2% in the TIV group, which was higher than after Vaccination 1 (15.7% aTIV and 15.8% TIV). 
The percentage of subjects with SAEs following Vaccination 2 was comparable between the aTIV and TIV 
groups (6.1% aTIV and 5.5% TIV).  
SAEs leading to death were generally low and were reported in 17 (3.5%) versus 6 (1.8%) subjects in 
the aTIV and TIV groups respectively.  
Vaccination 3 
The Vaccination 3 dataset (V7P3X2, V7P5X2) included data reported for the subset of subjects vaccinated 
in  the  first  year  (Vaccination  1)  who  subsequently  received  a  second  (Vaccination  2)  and  a  third 
(Vaccination 3) vaccination of aTIV or TIV (aTIV N=150, TIV N=87).  
After Vaccination 3, the percentage of subjects reporting AEs in all categories was lower than the AEs 
observed following Vaccination 1 and Vaccination 2.  
SAEs were reported infrequently after Vaccination 3 and the percentages were similar between vaccine 
groups. There were no AEs leading to withdrawal or death reported following Vaccination 3. 
Post marketing experience 
Currently there are no post marketing data available for aQIV. Nevertheless, the post marketing safety 
experience  after  using  aTIV  compiles  from  1st  May  1997  to  31th  May  2019  as  recorded  in  the  aTIV 
Periodic  Safety  Update  Report  (PSUR).  During  this  period,  over  127  million  doses  of  aTIV  were 
distributed, and 4,376 spontaneous/literature aTIV-confirmed individual case safety reports (ICSR) were 
received. 
The three most commonly reported SOCs (≥10%) overall were general disorders and administration site 
conditions (33.55%), injury, poisoning and procedural complications (13.72%) and musculoskeletal and 
connective  tissue  disorders  (10.96%).  Analysis  of  important  identified  and  potential  risks  for  aTIV  as 
compared to TIV using disproportionality method (PRR) shows no risks fulfilling criteria for a serious drug 
reaction (Table 67). A sensitivity analysis restricting cases containing older adults shows no change in 
risks fulfilling criteria for an SDR.

2.7.1.  Discussion on clinical safety (elderly indication) 
The safety profile of aQIV in elderly has been evaluated in 4,269 subjects ≥ 65 years of age. Furthermore, 
it  is  supported  by  study  data  from  aTIV  in  more  than  5,000  subjects  as  well  as  over  20 years  of 
postmarketing data with aTIV. 
Overall, the clinical development program to support registration of aQIV in individuals 65 years of age 
and  above  builds  on  a  pivotal  aQIV  study  (V118_20),  the  phase  III  study  V118_18,  the  pivotal  aTIV 
study  (V70_27),  several  supportive  aTIV  revaccination  studies  (12  supportive  studies)  and  the 
cumulative post marketing experience with aTIV. 
The total size of the aQIV safety database in the group of >65 years of age is in line with the “Guideline 
for the evaluation of new vaccines” (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005) recommendation. Additionally, the 
safety  data  provided  in  all  supportive  studies  accounted  of  5,146  adult  subjects  receiving  the  aTIV 
licensed  vaccine  (Fluad)  or  aTIV-2  (containing  the  alternate  B  strain)  support  the  safety  data  set  of 
subjects receiving the aQIV. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics 
The  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  were  generally  comparable  between  vaccine  groups  in 
V118_20, V118_18 and V70_27. However, in V118_20 the median BMI (body mass index) was high in 
all study groups, ranging from 28.62 to 28.96, comparing V70_27 (ranging from 25.32 to 25.40). 
The data of the percentage of subjects having at least one disorder recorded in their medical history in 
both  studies  have  been  provided.  These  data  are  slightly  lower  in  V70_27  (86.6%)  than  in  V118_20 
(97.7%) and in V118_18 (90.6%).  
The percentages of subjects having one or more concomitant medication in the pivotal V118_20, phase 
III V118_18 and V70_27 are similar across vaccine groups. Lower percentages have been observed in 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 183/194 
 
 
 
 
subjects  included  in  the  V70_27.  The  different  populations  enrolled  in  each  study  could  explain  this 
difference. 
Solicited Adverse events  
In the pivotal Study V118_20, similar rates of solicited events from Day 1 to  Day 7 after vaccination 
were  observed  in  adults  who  received  aQIV  or  aTIV  (51.8%  in  aQIV  group,  48.2%  to  48.7%  in  aTIV 
comparator groups). 
The most common reported solicited AE for aQIV was injection site pain, reported by 31.9%, followed 
by fatigue (16.0%) and headache (12.0%). Most solicited reactions were reported as mild or moderate 
in intensity and resolved within the first 3 days after vaccination.  
When the safety profile of aQIV is compared to that of aTIV, the percentage of subjects with solicited 
adverse events was slightly higher in the aQIV group compared to the aTIV groups. This is mainly driven 
by the local solicited adverse events. No remarkable differences in frequencies of moderate and severe 
solicited  local  and  systemic  AEs  were  observed  across  aQIV  and  aTIV  groups.  The  use  of  analgesics 
and/or antipyretics for prevention or treatments of pain and/or fever were low but higher in aQIV group 
than  in  one  comparator  vaccine  (5.4%,  2.7%,  3.9%  in  the  aQIV,  aTIV-1,  and  aTIV-2  groups, 
respectively).  
These  findings  indicate  that  the  addition of  the  fourth  influenza  strain  causes  a  numerical  increase in 
mainly local reactogenicity of aQIV compared to aTIV. However, this difference is small and concerns 
mostly AEs of mild intensity and short duration and is therefore considered acceptable. 
The reactogenicity of the vaccine within 30 minutes postvaccination was insignificant, with no difference 
between vaccine groups overall, by age groups and by gender.  
In the pivotal Study V70_27, the reactogenicity profile was higher in subjects who received aTIV vaccine 
than TIV (46% in aTIV group and 33% in the TIV group). The higher percentage in solicited AEs for the 
aTIV group was primarily due to a higher incidence of pain and tenderness at the injection site, as well 
as myalgia following vaccination with aTIV, indicating that the addition of the adjuvant causes a clear 
increase in reactogenicity of the aTIV compared to TIV. In the pivotal study V70_27 no difference in the 
use  of  analgesics or  antipyretics  for  prevention or  treatment  between  aTIV  and  comparator  TIV  were 
observed.  
In study V118_18, similar rates of subjects reporting any solicited AE from Day 1 through Day 7 after 
vaccination were observed: 34.3% in the aQIV group and 32.2% in the Boostrix group. The proportions 
of subjects with local and systemic AEs were slightly higher in the aQIV group compared to the Boostrix 
group (24.4% vs. 19.6% for local reactions, and 19.2% vs. 16.3% for systemic reactions, respectively). 
The majority of local AEs were of mild or moderate intensity. 
The  most  common  reported  local  solicited  AE  for  aQIV  was  injection  site  pain,  reported  by  16.3%, 
followed by erythema (10.8%) and induration (10.3%). Most solicited reactions were reported as mild 
or moderate in intensity and resolved within the first 3 days after vaccination. 
The  most  commonly  reported  systemic  solicited  AEs  were  headache  (10.8%),  fatigue  (10.5%),  and 
myalgia (7.7%). 
When comparing the data between this study and pivotal study V118_20, overall a lower percentage of 
subjects  experiencing  solicited  AEs  has  been  observed  in  this  additional  study  V118_18  (34.3%  and 
51.8% in V118_18 and V118_20 respectively for any solicited AEs). Not only it has been observed for 
any solicited AE but also for every AE reported separately (each solicited listed AE, local and systemic). 
Moreover, these new data have been reported as lower than the ones observed in the other pivotal study 
V70_27, where subjects were exposed to the aTIV vaccine. As a response to the D180 LoOI it is not 
Assessment report

Page 184/194 
 
 
 
 
obvious that a change in the antigens could be responsible of the different reactogenicity observed in 
different trials. It can be assumed that some differences in number of reported adverse reactions can be 
due to the clinical trial being conducted in different countries and in different populations.  
Unsolicited Adverse Events 
The percentage of unsolicited AEs reported in V118_20 and V118_18 were very similar across the vaccine 
groups and between the data reported in the pivotal study V70_27.  
In pivotal study V118_20, at least 1 unsolicited AE was reported during the entire study period by 19.8% 
of subjects in the aQIV group. The most commonly reported unsolicited AEs were influenza-like illness 
(2.0%),  injection  site  bruising  (1.1%),  injection  site  erythema  (0.7),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection 
(0.7%), and headache (0.6%). There were 39 subjects (4.4%) with an unsolicited AE considered possibly 
related to treatment, which mostly included injection site bruising (1.0%), and injection site erythema 
(0.7%).  
No cases of immediate hypersensitivity reactions 30 minutes after vaccination have been identified in 
studies V118_20, V118_18 and V70_27.  
In V118_18, the proportion of subjects with unsolicited AEs that were assessed as related to the study 
vaccine  were  similar,  although  slightly  higher  in  aQIV  vs  the  Boostrix  group  (9.0%  vs  7.7%, 
respectively). ILI was the most frequently reported unsolicited AE by Preferred Term (PT) in the aQIV 
and Boostrix groups (4.6%).  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
There were no deaths judged related to aQIV. Two deaths in the study V118_20 and 33 deaths in the 
study V118_18 occurred in the aQIV group, none of these deaths was considered related to the vaccine. 
Based upon the information in the narratives for both subjects, this assessment can be agreed.  
A  total  of  98  deaths  were  reported  during  the  V70_27;  one  case  of  Guillain-Barré  syndrome  was 
considered possibly related to the non adjuvanted vaccine (TIV).  
In V118_20 there were no SAEs judged related to aQIV.  
In study V70_27 there was one SAE judged by the investigator as possibly related to aTIV, namely as a 
case  of  bronchitis  with  onset  8  days  after  receipt  study  vaccine.  There  was  no  medical  history  of 
bronchitis. As there is no pathophysiological mechanism to explain this AE, it is considered unlikely that 
bronchitis is possibly related to the vaccine. 
In V118_18one subject in the aQIV group experienced one SAE of rheumatoid arthritis. The event was 
possibly related to aQIV.  
The frequencies of unsolicited AEs leading to NOCDs were similar in the vaccine groups in study V118_18. 
Three AEs, reported for subjects in the aQIV group, were assessed to be possibly related to the study 
vaccines (non-serious hyperglycaemia and radiculopathy and moderate rheumatoid arthritis). 
The percentage of subjects with medically attended AEs within 30 days after the first occurrence of RT-
PCR  confirmed  influenza-like  illness  (ILI)  showed  rates  generally  similar  in  the  aQIV  group  (0.7% 
subjects) and Boostrix group (0.4% subjects). 
Adverse events of special interest 
The occurrence of new onset of chronic disease was well balanced between study groups in the studies 
V118_20,  V118_18  and  V70_27.  None  of  these  events  were  considered  related  to  the  study  vaccine 
(aQIV or aTIV) in V118_20 and V70_27.  
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 185/194 
 
 
 
 
In V118_18, four subjects in the aQIV group and 6 subjects in the Boostrix group experienced AESIs. All 
AESIs,  except  one  event  of  rheumatoid  arthritis  experienced  by  one  subject in  the  aQIV  group,  were 
considered not related to study treatment. 
Special subgroups 
Age 
It is expected that with increasing age the reactogenicity decreases. This was indeed observed in study 
V118_18 and V70_27 but not in study V118_20. However, it should be noted that the number of subjects 
included ≥ 85 years of age in study V118_20 was very small, therefore no firm conclusions can be drawn. 
Gender 
In  study  V118_20  overall female  reported  more  AEs  compared  to  male  (for  aQIV  any  61.6 %  versus 
52.5% for female and male, respectively). Also, solicited local and systemic AEs were more frequently 
reported by female for aQIV 48.4% and 29.6% versus 37.7% and 21.0% for male. Indicating that the 
vaccine is somewhat more reactogenic in female compared to male.  
For study V70_27 and V118_18 reactogenicity was slightly higher in females as compared to males, both 
for solicited local as solicited systemic reactions. A similar pattern is seen for the unadjuvanted influenza 
vaccine included in study V70_27  
Safety in special populations 
Safety in special populations (immunocompromised individuals, pregnant, breast feeding women) has 
not been analysed.  
Since aQIV is proposed for indication in individuals ≥65 years of age, the use in pregnancy and lactation 
is not applicable.  
Immunocompromised individuals have been considered as an exclusion criterion in the aQIV study and 
have been included as missing information.  
Revaccination 
There are no revaccination data with aQIV in the population of older adults.  
Data  obtained  with  aTIV  suggests  that  reactogenicity  of  aTIV  and  TIV  increases  after  the  second 
vaccination. The percentage of subjects with solicited AEs is still within a range that can be expected 
after vaccination (48.8% and 45.8%), and the increase from the first to the second season is similar for 
aTIV and TIV. Following the third vaccination the rate decreased. However, it should be noted that the 
numbers after the third vaccination are rather low so no firm conclusions can be drawn. This data does 
not preclude the use of aQIV for revaccination in the elderly. 
Post marketing data 
Post marketing data with aTIV showed that the observed AEs post marketing were in line with the safety 
profile described in the studies. Most AEs are general disorders and administration site conditions.  
When the Proportional Reporting Rate of important identified and potential risks for aTIV was compared 
with TIV no risks fulfilling the criteria for a signal of disproportionality reporting was observed. Indicating 
that the addition of the adjuvant did not influence the important identified and potential risks. 
In summary, the aQIV studies demonstrated that the addition of a fourth strain does not alter the safety 
profile of aQIV. The safety profile of aQIV was slightly worse versus aTIV with no statistical significance, 
so they are considered to be similar. Minimal differences were observed in rates of solicited events and 
unsolicited AEs judged by the investigator as possibly/probably related between aQIV and aTIV. No new 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 186/194 
 
 
 
 
safety signals were detected. The reactogenicity of the vaccine within 30 minutes postvaccination was 
insignificant,  with  no  difference  between  vaccine  groups  overall,  by  age  groups  and  by  gender,  and 
overall, no safety concerns associated with vaccine-related hypersensitivity have been raised.  
No SAEs, NOCD and deaths in adult population were judged by the investigator as possibly/ probably 
related to the study vaccine. Except in V118_18, where one subject in the aQIV group experienced one 
SAE of rheumatoid arthritis, possibly related to aQIV. One subject in the Boostrix group experienced two 
SAE,  acute  myocardial  infarction  and  ILI,  assessed  as  possible  and  probably  related  to  the  vaccine 
respectively. 
Safety in special populations and drug interactions have not been analysed in aQIV studies.  
2.7.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety (elderly indication) 
After the review of the submitted data collected in the pivotal aQIV study (V118_20), the pivotal aTIV 
study (V70_27), the study V118_18, and the supportive aTIV revaccination studies it can be expected 
that the aQIV safety profile would be in general comparable to that of the aTIV comparators. No new 
safety signal has been observed in the submitted clinical database. It can be concluded that the increase 
in antigen amount due to the additional B strain does not have any clinically relevant impact in the safety 
of the vaccine.  
The safety profile of aQIV is considered adequate to support the indication for the prophylaxis of influenza 
in subjects≥65 years of age.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.3 is acceptable.  
2.9.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The PSUR should be submitted in compliance with the currently existing EURD list entry for “'influenza 
vaccine (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted)”. 
2.10.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that influenza vaccine (surface antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) has not been 
previously authorised in a medicinal product in the European Union. 
Fluad Tetra is a seasonal adjuvated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (aQIV). aQIV is a surface antigen 
inactivated influenza vaccine containing influenza surface antigens (haemagglutinin (HA) and 
neuraminidase (NA)) from each of the four influenza strains (Type A/H1N1, Type A/H3N2 and Type B 
Yamagata Lineage and Victoria Lineage), recommended annually by the WHO and subsequently CHMP 
for the EU market. The adjuvant is MF59C.1. (MF59), a squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion 
previously approved for human use in Fluad (trivalent seasonal, adjuvated inactivated influenza 
vaccine, aTIV). 
According to the applicant, the active substance in Agrippal and Fluad is a combination of HA and NA 
surface antigens from each of the three influenza strains recommended annually by the WHO for 
trivalent influenza vaccines. 
Also the applicant stated that the active substances in aTIV and aQIV differ by the presence of HA and 
NA of a second B strain in aQIV and aQIV has not yet been approved. The active substance in aQIV 
(combination of HA and NA surface antigens from each of the four influenza strains recommended 
annually by the WHO for quadrivalent influenza vaccines) was therefore claimed as a new active 
substance, aQIV. The combination of this new active substance with adjuvant MF59, was claimed to be 
a new drug product.  
However, based on the initial review of the data by CHMP, the active substances contained in the 
medicinal product Fluad Tetra were not qualified as a new active substance in comparison to the 
products previously authorised in the European Union (Fluad and Agrippal) for the following reasons:  
• 
The product contains four active substances, not one active substance from a combination 
of four different strains, as claimed by the applicant. It has to be noted that strains from 
both lineages of influenza B have been components of approved trivalent influenza vaccines 
in previous influenza seasons, i.e. no new lineage of influenza B which could be qualified as 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 188/194 
 
 
 
 
NAS, is included in the Fluad Tetra composition. The same applies to the two influenza A 
subtypes. 
The active substance manufacturing process is similar to the one registered for Fluad and 
Agrippal. This does not result in a novel type of active substance. 
Influenza vaccines have a specific legal provision which permits change of the influenza 
antigens without leading to a new MA every influenza season even if a new influenza strain 
is included in an authorised vaccine. Therefore, qualification of the active substance of Fluad 
Tetra as NAS would thus be inconsistent with the legal provision. 
From a regulatory perspective, an adjuvant is not part of the active substance(s). Therefore 
the adjuvant MF59C.1 (MF59) in Fluad Tetra cannot be considered in the context of the NAS 
assessment.  
The active substances in Fluad Tetra do not differ significantly in properties with regard to 
safety and efficacy from the previously authorised substances. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The CHMP’s scientific objection to this claim was classified as a major objection. The NAS application 
was withdrawn by the Applicant. Thus, this application does not now include a new active substance 
claim.  
2.11.  Significance of paediatric studies 
Not applicable. 
2.12.  Product information 
2.12.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.12.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Fluad Tetra (influenza vaccine (surface 
antigen, inactivated, adjuvanted) is included in the additional monitoring list as it is a biological 
product that is authorised after 1 January 2011.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Influenza is an infectious acute respiratory disease of global importance that occurs in annual 
epidemics in the northern hemisphere (NH) and southern hemisphere (SH). The influenza virus is 
transmitted by respiratory droplets or aerosols containing the influenza virus particles and subsequent 
inhalation of infectious particles or self-inoculation from a contaminated surface. Clinical manifestation 
of influenza virus infection is characterized by an abrupt onset of nonspecific respiratory and systemic 
effects, such as fever, myalgia, headache, malaise, non-productive cough, sore throat and rhinitis.  
Some individuals are more prone than others to develop complications from influenza, e.g. bacterial 
pneumonia or other organ dysfunction. Severe influenza and complicated influenza potentially leading 
to hospitalisation and death are more likely to occur in vulnerable populations, such as older people 
(≥65 years of age, in part due to the age related decline of the immune response 
(immunosenescence)), pregnant women, younger children (especially up to 24 months of age), and 
patients with chronic underlying diseases. These groups are considered at risk and represent the 
priority target for influenza vaccination programmes in the EU. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies 
Vaccination is considered the best approach to lower the burden of influenza disease. Different 
seasonal inactivated (split virion or subunit) influenza vaccines (quadrivalent and trivalent) are licensed 
for children aged 6 months and older, adolescents and adults, as well as a Live Attenuated Influenza 
Vaccine licensed for children and adolescents aged 2 years to 17 years.  
Differences between the circulating strains and those included in the vaccine as a result of antigenic 
drift poses another key challenge for conventional influenza vaccines as it decreases vaccine efficacy. 
This is particularly relevant since A/H3N2 shows a high rate of evolution among the influenza subtypes 
currently circulating with antigenically distinct strains emerging on average every 2 to 5 years.  
In elderly, immune responses against conventional (trivalent) inactivated influenza vaccines has been 
shown to be lower than in younger adults due to immunosenescence. In line with this, clinical vaccine 
efficacy estimates were lower in older adults (17% to 53 %) as compared to younger adults (70% to 
90%) (Goodwin et al. 2006). Therefore, there is a need for improved influenza vaccines for these age 
groups, i.e. children and elderly. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical development program to support licensure of aQIV in individuals ≥65 years of age is based 
on the results of the pivotal aQIV immunogenicity and safety study V118_20. The data package also 
includes a key supportive aTIV study V70_27. 
In addition, 7 supportive aTIV studies, 7 aTIV revaccination studies, and 2 aTIV effectiveness studies 
were submitted. Additionally, the safety profile is supported by more than 20 years of aTIV 
postmarketing data. 
Moreover, data from study V118_18 was submitted during the evaluation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/200444/2020  
Page 190/194 
 
 
 
 
V118_20 is a randomised controlled double blind multicentre study in 1,778 adults ≥65 years which 
set out to demonstrate non-inferiority of the immune responses to the aQIV vaccine as compared to 
adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccines (Fluad, aTIV 1, and an aTIV containing the alternate B strain, 
aTIV-2), forming the bridge to the evidence generated with aTIV.  
V70_27 is a randomised controlled observer-blind multicentre study in 7,109 adults ≥65 years of age, 
which set out to demonstrate superiority of the immune response to the MF59 adjuvanted trivalent 
influenza vaccine Fluad (aTIV, subject to receive either 1 of the 3 lots of aTIV (lots 1, 2, or 3)) as 
compared to a non-adjuvanted trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV).  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The clinical development program was based on the assumption that Fluad Tetra, based on the same 
manufacturing platform as aTIV (Fluad, EU approved vaccine), is as safe and would induce similar 
protection against influenza disease as demonstrated in prior studies with aTIV, with the additional 
benefit of protecting against both influenza B lineages.  
Data derived from aTIV are considered directly relevant to aQIV because although aQIV contains 
additional antigen, the same active substance is used in both vaccines, both vaccines contain the same 
amount of MF59, and the manufacturing process. 
In study V118_20, non-inferiority of aQIV over aTIV could be claimed as the estimated GMT ratio 
(aTIV/aQIV) against homologous strains contained in aTIV was 1.16 (95% CI 1.05, 1.27) for A/H1N1, 
0.99 (95% CI: 0.90, 1.09) for H3N2, 0.99 (95% CI 0.90, 1.08) for B/Yamagata and 0.99 (95% 0.90, 
1.08) for B/Victoria. The estimated difference in SCR (aTIV-aQIV) was 3.23 (95% CI -1.30, 7.76), 0.37 
(95% CI: -4.23, 4.96), -0.93 (95% CI -5.13, 3.27) and -1.26 (95% CI -5.07, 2.55) for the four strains 
respectively. 
In terms of immunogenicity, the primary endpoint was met, and showed that aQIV elicited a non-
inferior immune response as compared to aTIV-1 and aTIV-2 in terms of GMT ratios and differences in 
SC rates. Additionally, the secondary endpoint regarding immunologic superiority of aQIV relative to 
aTIV for the alternate B strain was also met. 
In study V70_27, the estimated GMT ratio (aTIV/TIV) against homologous strains 21 days after 
vaccination was 1.37 (95% CI: 1.29, 1.46) for A/H1N1, 1.6 (95% CI: 1.51, 1.68) for A/H3N2, and 
1.14 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.2) for the B strain. The estimated difference in seroconversion rate (SCR, aTIV-
TIV) was 9.6% (95% CI: 7.4, 11.8), 13.8% (95% CI: 11.7, 16) and 3% (95% CI: 1%, 5%) for the 
three strains respectively. Non-inferiority was demonstrated for GMT ratios and SCR differences for all 
3 strains. 
For heterologous strains, the estimated difference in SCR was 12.8% (95% CI: 8.4, 17.2) for A/H1N1, 
12.5% (95%CI: 0.1, 17) for A/H3N2, and 4.2% (95%CI: 0, 8.4) for the B strain. GMT ratios were 1.49 
(95% CI: 1.29, 1.72), 1.38 (95% CI: 1.24, 1.52) and 1.09 (95%CI: 0.99, 1.21) for the three strains 
respectively. 
After 181 days after vaccination, the estimated GMT for the response against homologous A/H3N2 and 
B were higher in the aTIV group compared to the TIV group. This was also seen for the A/H3N2 strain 
366 days after vaccination (GMT ratio 1.3 (95% CI 1.01, 1,67), but not for the B strain. There was no 
important difference for A/H1N1 between both groups at both time points; the estimated GMTr was 
1.05 (95% CI: 0.82, 1.33) and 0.94 (95%CI: 0.73, 1.22) at D181 and D366 respectively.

In a posthoc analysis, it was shown that aTIV elicited significantly higher GMT levels and SCR than TIV 
against all 3 homologous strains, demonstrating the benefit of the MF-59 adjuvant in subjects ≥65 
years of age. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Although the HI response was higher in subjects who received aTIV as compared to those who 
received TIV in study V70_27, superiority could not be claimed according to the predefined superiority 
criteria. The clinical relevance of the superiority in terms of increased HI titres following vaccination 
with the adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine as compared to non-adjuvanted inactivated influenza 
vaccine is not known, but it is expected that higher HI titres will translate into a better protection 
against the strains included in the vaccine. 
There are no data in elderly with a compromised immune system, and little data in the frail elderly.  
The applicant has presented the CSR for study V118_18, aimed at evaluating the efficacy, safety and 
immunogenicity of aQIV compared to an non-influenza comparator in adults ≥ 65 years of age. In this 
study, the primary objective of demonstrating the efficacy of aQIV in adults 65 years and above in 
protecting against any RT-PCR confirmed influenza A and/or B diseases was not met, since the pre-
specified statistical success criterion (the LL of the two-sided 97.45% CI of VE should exceed 40%) 
was not satisfied. Similarly, the key secondary objective was not met. Therefore, this study could not 
support to the demonstration of efficacy in the ≥65 age group. 
Two other limitations that affect all influenza vaccines are: 
- 
- 
The efficacy depends on the degree of antigenic match between vaccine and circulating strains 
and therefore the efficacy of the seasonal influenza vaccines could vary in different seasons. 
In general, all influenza vaccines, show reduced efficacy (in terms of immunogenicity) in the 
elderly due to immune senescence. However, the immunogenicity results obtained with Fluad 
Tetra in subjects >65 years of age were similar with results obtained with the authorised aTIV, 
indicating similar acceptable levels of efficacy.  
Effectiveness studies will be conducted yearly and should be able to generate useful data to monitor 
the performance of the vaccines over time and in special population subgroups during routine use. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety of Fluad Tetra in elderly subjects 65 years of age and older was evaluated in two clinical 
studies (V118_20 and V118_18), in which 4,269 received Fluad Tetra.  
Following vaccination with aQIV, in study V118_20, 51.8% of subjects ≥65 years reported at least one 
solicited AE, of whom 43.6% a local solicited AE and 26.2% a systemic solicited AE. The most common 
solicited AEs were injection site pain (31.9%), fatigue (16.0%) and headache (12.0%).  
In study V118_18, lower percentage of subjects experiencing solicited AEs than in the pivotal study 
V118_20 (34.3%, of whom 24.4% a local solicited AE and 19.2% a systemic solicited AE). The most 
common reported solicited AE for aQIV was injection site pain (16.3%), erythema (10.8%), headache 
(10.8%), and induration (10.3%).  
It can be expected that the aQIV safety profile would be in general comparable to that of the aTIV 
comparators. No new safety signal has been observed in the submitted clinical database. It can be 
concluded that the increase in antigen amount due to the additional B strain does not have any 
clinically relevant impact in the safety of the vaccine.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There is a safety database with aQIV, which is limited in size to determine the occurrence of rare 
(<0.1%) adverse events. In the studies in elderly, subjects were generally healthy with few 
comorbidities and it is likely that the extremely frail elderly were excluded. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
The immunogenicity of Fluad (trivalent formulation) is relevant to Fluad Tetra because both vaccines 
are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions. 
It has been demonstrated that aTIV has an immunological benefit over non-adjuvanted influenza 
vaccine in adults ≥65 years, as three weeks after vaccination an increased HI response to all three 
homologous strains was observed. The size of this benefit was variable between strains and sustained 
over 12 months for one of the three strains. As non-inferiority between aQIV and aTIV with two 
alternating B strains has been demonstrated, the findings with aTIV can be extrapolated to aQIV. 
Whether this immunogenic benefit translates into better protection is not known. Studies with aTIV 
submitted as supportive have pointed towards a clinical benefit of the adjuvanted inactivated influenza 
vaccine over non-adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccines, in terms of decreased hospitalisation. 
According to the CHMP guideline for influenza vaccines (Non clinical & clinical module) it is sufficient for 
this population to demonstrate an advantage in terms of immune responses to justify the inclusion of 
an adjuvant. The increase in reactogenicity due to the inclusion of the adjuvant is within limits and 
reactions remain mostly mild to moderate and transient. 
As an immunological advantage of the adjuvant has been demonstrated in comparison to a non-
adjuvanted influenza vaccine and as the reactogenicity observed in clinical trials is, albeit increased 
compared to non-adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccines, within limits of what can be expected for 
influenza vaccines, the Benefit Risk balance can be considered positive. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Fluad Tetra is positive.

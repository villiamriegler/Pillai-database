Special populations 
Patients with clinically significant renal or hepatic 
impairment might experience more adverse reactions (see 
sections 4.2 and 5.2). Patients with severe hepatic 
impairment have not been studied. Therefore, if Exelon is 
used in this patient population close monitoring is 
necessary. 
Section 4.2 of the oral formulations SmPCs has also been 
revised to now include the following: 
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to 
moderate renal or hepatic impairment. However, due to 
increased exposure in these populations, dosing 
recommendations to titrate according to individual 
tolerability should be closely followed as patients with 
clinically significant renal or hepatic impairment might 
In addition, minor linguistic amendments have been

(CVA) in the overall Prometax group relative to placebo and 
a slight imbalance in the incidence of CVA with Prometax 
patch. In consequence, the following updates of the 
Prometax SPCs were initially proposed by the MAH:  
- 'myocardial infarction' is added as a rare adverse reaction 
(SPC section 4.8) of the Prometax oral formulations SPCs 
and referred to in the text of section 4.8 of the Prometax 
patch SPCs. 
- 'cerebrovascular accident' is added as an uncommon 
adverse reaction (SPC section 4.8) of Prometax patch SPCs 
and referred to in the text of section 4.8 of the Prometax 
oral formulations SPCs. 
- the adverse events 'anxiety', 'delirium', and 'pyrexia' are 
added in the SPC of Prometax hard capsules and oral 
formulation in section 4.8 as common adverse events 
occurring with Prometax patches.  
After assessing the data submitted by the MAH, the CHMP 
concluded that the results from provided studies are not

robust enough either to justify addition of myocardial 
infarction event as a rare adverse reaction or 
cerebrovascular event as an uncommon adverse reaction in 
the SPCs of Prometax hard capsules and oral solution.  
Section 4.8 of the SPCs of Prometax hard capsules and oral 
formulation were amended to include the adverse events 
'anxiety', 'delirium', and 'pyrexia' as common adverse 
events. 
The Detailed Description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
as described by the MAH (version 2.0) fulfils the legislative 
requirements as concluded by the CHMP and the 
Committee therefore recommended an update of Annex II 
accordingly.

the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be 
adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore 
considered that the benefit/risk profile of Prometax 
continues to be favourable.  
The CHMP was also of the opinion that the renewal can be

Following the occurrence of 3 cases of oesophageal rupture,

case of severe vomiting associated with rivastigmine 
treatment, appropriate dose adjustments as recommended 
in section 4.2 must be made. Some cases of severe 
vomiting were associated with oesophageal rupture. After a 
review of its Clinical and Safety database, the MAH updated 
the product information to add 'Severe vomiting associated 
with oesophageal rupture' with the frequency 'very rare'. 
Such events appeared to occur particularly after dose 
increments or high doses of rivastigmine.  
The frequency of 'Elevated liver function tests' was also 
modified from very rare to uncommon. 
In addition some clarifications have been introduced in 
section 5.1 of the SPC and the MAH also applied for a 
combined PL for the hard capsules, updated the annexes in 
accordance with the latest QRD template and introduced 
minor linguistic corrections in some of the languages.

1.  Introduction 
On 27 March 2018, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Menveo, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
Menveo is indicated for active immunization of children (from 2 years of age), adolescents and adults 
at risk of exposure to Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, W135 and Y, to prevent invasive disease. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
Menveo should be administered as a single dose (0.5 ml). To ensure optimal antibody levels against all 
vaccine  serogroups,  the  primary  vaccination  schedule  with  Menveo  should  be  completed  one  month 
prior to risk of exposure to Neisseria meningitides groups A, C, W135 and Y. 
In the parent study V102_02 Menveo was used as a comparator vaccine. In study V102_02E2 the 
antibody persistence at approximately 48 months after vaccination performed in study V102_02 was 
evaluated. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program

2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final reports for: 
• 
A phase 2, open-label, controlled, multi-centre extension study to evaluate 4-year antibody 
persistence and booster response following MenABCWY vaccination in healthy adolescents and young 
adults who previously participated in studies V102_02 and V102_02E1  (Protocol V102_02E2) 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
V102_02E2 
Description 
Study V102_02E2 is an extension study of V102_02 aimed at 1) measuring the antibody persistence 
approximately 4 years after receiving MenABCWY vaccination or MenACWY and 2) evaluating the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

response to against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y and serogroup B test strains 30 days 
after a single dose of MenABCWY in previously vaccinated subjects, and in vaccine-naïve subjects of 
similar age. 
Methods 
Objectives 
Primary objectives 
1. To assess antibody persistence against Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y and 
serogroup B test strains in subjects who previously received MenABCWY+outer membrane vesicle 
(OMV) or MenACWY approximately 4 years earlier, as measured by the percentage of subjects with 
serum bactericidal assay (SBA) using human complement (hSBA) titers ≥ lower limit quantitation (LLQ) 
and other thresholds, hSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs) and geometric mean ratios (GMRs). 
2. To evaluate immune response against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y and serogroup B 
test strains 30 days after a single dose of MenABCWY+OMV in previously vaccinated subjects, and in 
vaccine-naïve subjects of similar age, as measured by the percentage of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 
LLQ and other thresholds, hSBA GMTs and GMRs. 
Secondary objectives 
Secondary objectives included the evaluation of safety and reactogenicity of the MenABCWY vaccine 
given as 1 or 2 doses in subjects previously vaccinated with MenABCWY+OMV or MenACWY, and in 
vaccine-naïve subjects; the evaluation of the kinetics of the immune response using different 
immunogenicity endpoints following a dose of MenABCWY, in subjects who previously received 2 doses 
of MenABCWY or 1 dose of MenACWY, and following 1 and 2 doses of MenABCWY in vaccine-naïve 
subjects; and the evaluation of the immunogenicity of 2 doses of MenABCWY+OMV in subjects who 
previously received 1 dose of MenACWY and vaccine-naïve subjects, using different endpoints.  
Assessor's comment: 
in the present procedure the focus will be on Menveo. Therefore, results for all the objectives described 
above will not be evaluated in this report, only when it concerns the response to or persistence after 
receiving Menveo.  
Study design 
The study is an open label controlled extension study of parent study V102_02 and extension study 
V102_02E1. Subjects who received 2 doses of MenABCWY+OMV in the V102_02 parent study were 
scheduled to receive a single booster dose of MenABCWY+OMV on day 1 only. Other subjects were to 
receive 2 doses of MenABCWY+OMV on days 1 and 31. The duration of this extension study was 
approximately 1 month for subjects in ABCWY+OMV group, and approximately 2 months for subjects 
in the ACWY and Naïve groups. An overview of the vaccinations received in relation to the study groups 
is provided in the table below.

Study population /Sample size 
All subjects who met predefined eligibility criteria (i.e. received either MenABCWY or MenACWY in the 
parent study and who received no other meningococcal vaccines and gave informed consent) were to 
be asked to participate in the extension study. Additionally, a proportional number of vaccine-naïve 
subjects aged 15 through 23 years were to be recruited at each site. 
Assessor’s comments 
Subjects in the Naïve group had received no meningococcal vaccines previously, and received 2 doses 
of MenABCWY+OMV in V102_02E2.The MAH should confirm that ‘vaccine naïve subjects’ did indeed not 
receive any meningococcal vaccines, including monovalent MenC vaccines. 
Treatments 
Subjects received either a single or two doses of MenABCWY investigational vaccine. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary immunogenicity endpoints 
•  hSBA GMTs against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y and serogroup B test strains. 
•  Percentages of subjects with hSBA titres ≥ 8 against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y. 
•  Percentages of subjects with hSBA titres ≥ 5 against serogroup B test strains. 
•  Percentages of subjects with hSBA titres ≥ LLQ against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and 
Y and serogroup B test strains. 
•  Between group GMRs comparing GMTs against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y and 
serogroup B test strains.

•  Within group GMRs comparing baseline GMTs to GMTs at later time points against N 
meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y and serogroup B test strains. 
The high throughput hSBA (HT-hSBA) is an automated version of the SBA, and was to be used in this 
study to measure immunogenicity to N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, Y, and serogroup B test 
strains. All assays were to be performed in GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, in a blinded manner towards 
the treatment arm and the visit and subject. 
Secondary safety endpoints: 
Safety of the study vaccine was to be assessed in all subjects in terms of the frequency and 
percentage of reported AEs including: 
•  Any unsolicited and solicited AEs reported within 30 minutes after vaccination; 
•  Solicited local (ie, pain, erythema and induration) and systemic (ie, chills, loss of appetite, 
headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, fever (body temperature ≥ 38°C [100.4°F]) 
AEs reported from day 1 (6 hours) through day 7 after each vaccination; 
•  All unsolicited AEs reported during the entire study period; 
•  Medically attended AEs reported during the entire study period; 
•  AEs leading to premature withdrawal from the study during the entire study period; 
•  SAEs reported during the entire study period. 
Statistical Methods 
There were no statistical hypotheses associated with the primary objectives. All analyses were to be 
run descriptively. The sample size was estimated based on the number of subjects from the parent 
study V102_02 and the previous extension study V102_02E1 who could be available for this extension 
study.  
For immunogenicity endpoints based on unadjusted GMTs, the estimates were to be provided along 
with the associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) obtained by exponentiating (base 10) the 
unadjusted means and the lower and upper limits of the 95% CIs of the log transformed titers (base 
10), for each study group and N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y and serogroup B test strains 
on days 1, 31, and 61. 
The percentages of subjects with hSBA titer ≥ LLQ and associated 2-sided 95% CIs were to be 
computed for each study group and N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y and serogroup B test 
strains on days 1, 31, and 61. The analysis was to be repeated for percentages of subjects with hSBA 
titer ≥ 8 against serogroups A, C, W, and Y and ≥ 5 against serogroup B test strains. No statistical 
criteria were established to assess adequacy of the antibody persistence. 
Analyses related to the secondary objectives were to be descriptive; no statistical tests were to be 
performed. 
Safety analyses were to be performed on the appropriate safety sets.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
In the parent study V120_02, a total of 495 subjects were enrolled, 83 of which were randomized to 
Group VI (MenACWY/Placebo). In the first extension study, V120_02E1, a total of 440 subjects were 
enrolled. In Group VI (1 dose of MenACWY), 73 subjects were enrolled and received study vaccination 
and 72 subjects completed the extension study following the protocol. 
A total of 129 subjects were enrolled – 46 in the MenACWY group. All of the enrolled subjects received 
at least one dose of the study vaccine and completed the study. The first subject was enrolled on 30 
June 2015, the last subject completed the study on 10 December 2015. 
Centres were located in Colombia, Panama and Chile. 
Assessor’s comments 
There is a decline in the number of subjects with each extension study – from 495 in the parent study 
to 129 in this second extension study; for the MenACWY group from 83 in V120_02, 73 in V120_02E1 
to 46 in this study. The MAH is requested to demonstrate that there is no inadvertent selection in 
subjects included in the extension study, i.e. that the response to MenACWY vaccination as measured 
in the parent study was comparable between the 46 subjects included in V102_02E2 and the 37 
subjects NOT included in study V102_02E2 – considering both immunogenicity endpoints as 
reactogenicity endpoints.  
Baseline data 
The mean age of the subjects was 18.4 ± 2.04 years. There were lesser number of males than females 
in MenABCWY+OMV (33% males vs 67% females) and MenACWY (41% males vs 59% females) 
groups. All of the subjects, except for one subject in the ABCWY+OMV group, were of the Hispanic or 
Latino ethnic origin. 
Efficacy results 
4-year Persistence for Serogroups A, C, W, and Y  
At 4 years after the last vaccination in study V102_02 the persistence of immunity in subjects who 
previously received MenACWY was: 
-  hSBA ≥ 8 were 41% against serogroup A, 43% against serogroup C, 78% against serogroup 
W, and 59% against serogroup Y.  
-  hSBA GMTs were numerically higher than those in the Naïve group against all serogroups: A 
(6.64 vs 1.20), C (6.62 vs 5.11), W (25 vs 8.37), and Y (12 vs 2).

Assessor’s comments 
The table below is taken from appendix 16.1.9.5.6 of the final study report of V102_02E1, showing the 
% subjects with hSBA>1:8 at 0,1,3,6,7 and 12 months after vaccination in the 1ACWY arm.

Four years after vaccination, 41%, 43%, 78% and 59% respectively had hSBA >1:8 against Men 
A,C,W and Y – the decline in % subjects with hSBA>1:8 continued between M12 and M48. 
In comparison with vaccine naïve subjects, it can be concluded that there is persistence of vaccine 
induced immunity against MenA, W and Y, as rates with hSBA>1:8 and GMTs are significantly higher 
compared to the vaccine naïve group. Whilst 43% of subjects still had hSBA >1:8 against MenC 4 
years after vaccination, the rate is similar as for those subjects who were not vaccinated. Also subjects 
who received MenACWY in the parent study V120_02 appear to have similar GMTs for MenC as 
compared to those who are vaccine naïve. Of course this could be a result of natural circulation of 
MenC however this would indicate that the persistence of vaccine induced immunity following Menveo 
for MenC is minimal to non-existent after 4 years, which is not in line with the information currently 
included in the SmPC. The MAH is requested to comment. 
Safety results 
There are no new safety results for Menveo, as Menveo was not given in this study. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This report contains the clinical study report of V102_02E2. This study was conducted as part of the 
development program of the investigational meningococcal combination vaccine MenABCWY, intended 
to protect against the five most common Neisseria meningitides serogroups (A, B, C, W and Y). 
Menveo was only given as a comparator vaccine in one control arm in the parent study V102_02.  
V102_02E2 was an open-label, extension study conducted to evaluate 4-year antibody persistence and 
booster response following MenABCWY vaccination in healthy adolescents and young adults who 
previously participated in studies V102_02 and V102_02E1 and had received either 2 doses of 
MenABCWY+OMV vaccine or 1 dose of ACWY Vaccine. The study also enrolled vaccine naïve subjects 
who had not previously received any meningococcal vaccine. In response to RSI, the MAH clarified that 
these vaccine naïve subjects did indeed not receive any meningococcal vaccines including monovalent 
MenC vaccine.

For the present P46 AR, only the measurement of persistence of antibodies 4 years after vaccination is 
directly relevant to Menveo. Menveo was not administered in the extension study. 
A total of 129 subjects were enrolled – 46 in the MenACWY group; in the parent study V120_02 83 
subjects were included in the MenACWY group, in V120_02E1, 73 subjects were enrolled in the 
MenACWY group. This is a marked decline; the MAH was requested to demonstrate that there is no 
inadvertent selection in subjects included in the extension study, i.e. that the response to vaccination 
as measured in the parent study in those subjects included in V102_02E2 is similar to the response in 
those NOT included in study V102_02E2 – considering both immunogenicity endpoints as 
reactogenicity endpoints in V120_02. The MAH in their response provided evidence to suggest that the 
response as measured in the parent studies in those subjects included in V102_02E2 is similar to the 
response of ALL subjects included in the parent study considering the immunogenicity. In a further 
post-hoc analysis, the MAH showed that the response to vaccination as measured in the parent study 
in those subjects included in V102_02E2 was similar to the response in those NOT included in study 
V102_02E2 considering both immunogenicity endpoints as reactogenicity endpoints. 
Four years after vaccination, 41%, 43%, 78% and 59% of subjects who received Menveo in the parent 
study V120_02 had hSBA >1:8 against Men A,C,W and Y respectively. When compared to the vaccine 
naïve group, which included age matched subjects who had received no meningococcal vaccines 
previously – ‘vaccine naïve subjects’, the rates of subjects with hSBA>1:8 and GMTs are significantly 
higher in those who received Menveo in V120_02 for Men A, W and Y suggesting persistence of 
vaccine-induced immunity.  
For MenC however, the rates of subjects with hSBA>1:8 are similar compared to the vaccine naïve 
group. Whilst 43% of subjects still had hSBA >1:8 against MenC 4 years after vaccination, the rate is 
similar as for those subjects who were not vaccinated; GMTs are also similar. This could be a result of 
natural circulation of MenC however this would indicate that the persistence of immunity following 
Menveo for MenC is minimal after 4 years, which is not in line with the information currently included 
in the SmPC. As results are based on small numbers and the study was not designed nor powered to 
detect differences between Menveo-primed and vaccine naïve individuals it is possible that differences 
result from chance therefore no update to the SmPC is needed. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
As study V120_02E2 focused on the evaluation of an experimental MenABCWY vaccine, and subjects 
only received Menveo in a control group in parent study V120_02, there is only few new data for 
Menveo contained in this study. 
An update of the SmPC is not considered necessary. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required. 
4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1.  The MAH is requested to demonstrate that there is no inadvertent selection in subjects 
included in the extension study, i.e. that the response to vaccination as measured in the parent 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/906862/2019

study in those subjects included in V102_02E2 is similar to the response in those NOT included 
in study V102_02E2 – considering both immunogenicity endpoints as reactogenicity endpoints 
in V120_02. 
2.  The MAH should confirm that ‘vaccine naïve subjects’ enrolled in study V102_02E2 did indeed 
not receive any meningococcal vaccines, including monovalent MenC vaccines. 
3.  Whilst 43% of subjects still had hSBA >1:8 against MenC 4 years after vaccination in study 
V102_02E2, the rate is similar as for those subjects who were not vaccinated (‘vaccine naïve 
subjects’); GMTs are also similar. This could be a result of natural circulation of MenC however 
this would indicate that the persistence of immunity following Menveo for MenC is minimal 
after 4 years, which is not in line with the information currently included in the SmPC. This 
should be adequately discussed by the MAH. 
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop. 
MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
1.  The MAH is requested to demonstrate that there is no inadvertent selection in subjects included in 
the extension study, i.e. that the response to vaccination as measured in the parent study in those 
subjects included in V102_02E2 is similar to the response in those NOT included in study 
V102_02E2 – considering both immunogenicity endpoints as reactogenicity endpoints in V120_01. 
Response MAH 
The Company acknowledges the Rapporteur request and would like to clarify the following: 
V102_02E2 study was a phase 2, open-label, controlled, multi-center extension study to evaluate 
approximately 4-year antibody persistence of 2 MenABCWY+OMV doses or one Menveo dose and 
MenABCWY+OMV boostability in healthy adolescents and young adults who previously participated in 
studies V102_02 and V102_02E1. 
Participation to V102_02E2 study for follow-on subjects was solely based on fulfilment of all inclusion 
criteria and no exclusion criteria and subjects’ willingness and consent to participate to this second 
extension study. Participation to V102_02E2 study was not based on immune responses or 
reactogenicity/safety outcomes observed in the parent study or in its extension 1. 
This is generally accepted as an appropriate method to avoid selection bias and it was deemed 
accurate to enable that the subset of subjects included in study V102_02E2 was representative of the 
whole sample. 
The available data that helps descriptively comparing V102_02 and its extension 2 populations enrolled 
in the Menveo arm is provided in the table below. Table 1 in fact shows V102_02 immune responses 
after a single dose of Menveo in two populations: 
- 
- 
all subjects enrolled in the V102_02 Menveo arm (Group A); 
the subset of subjects enrolled in the V102_02 Menveo arm that also subsequently participated 
to V102_02E2 study (Group B). 
Immune responses one month after one Menveo dose are similar in the overall group of subjects 
enrolled in the parent study (Group A) and in those subsequently enrolled in the extension study 
(Group B), with 95% CIs overlapping for any of the Neisseria meningitidis serogroups, indicating that

the subset of subjects enrolled in V102_02E2 are representative of the overall enrolled subjects in the

The MAH was requested to demonstrate that the response to vaccination as measured in the parent 
study in those subjects included in V102_02E2 is similar to the response in those NOT included in 
study V102_02E2.  
Rather the MAH provided evidence that the response of subjects included in V102_02E2 is not 
significantly different to the response of all subjects in the V102_02 Menveo arm. This provides some 
reassurance however is not what was asked for. As the issue as to why the observations regarding the 
(pattern of) persistence of antibodies against the MenC component in this study is not in line with 
earlier observations has not been clarified (see also Q2) the MAH is requested to provide the requested 
data. The question remains open.  
Conclusion 
Issue not solved. 
2.  The rates of subjects who received MenACWY in parent study V120_02 with hSBA>1:8 against 
MenC approximately four years after vaccination are similar compared to the vaccine naïve group; 
43% (95%CI: 28.9%-58.9%) compared to 45% (95% CI: 30.7%-59.8%). GMTs are also similar. 
This would indicate that the persistence of vaccine induced immunity following Menveo for MenC is 
minimal after 4 years, which is not in line with the information currently included in the SmPC. The 
MAH is requested to comment and discuss whether the information in the SmPC should be 
updated, in particular the warning in section 4.4 regarding the persistence for MenA. 
Response MAH 
The Company acknowledges the Rapporteur’s request and would like to clarify that evidence coming 
from V102_02E2 study is not proposed to modify current Menveo SmPC considering the following 
factors: 
-  V102_02E2 study was a purely descriptive phase 2 study, with a small sample size, aimed to 
assess persistence and boostability of the MenABCWY+OMV investigational vaccine. The number of 
subjects enrolled in the Menveo group is low (N=46), and as such, any results should be 
interpreted with caution. Indeed, the Menveo group was only intended to serve as a control for 
descriptive comparisons of persistence and boostability with the MenABCWY+OMV vaccine; 
- 
The assay used for antibody titer estimation in the V102 studies is a highthroughput hSBA (HT-
hSBA). This assay is different than the one used for studies in the Menveo clinical development 
(manual hSBA), and from which the Menveo SmpC is based. The HT-hSBA is only used for phase 2 
assessments for the investigational MenABCWY+OMV vaccine; 
- 
In the Updated Assessment Report dated 23 Feb 2017 for study V102_03E1 
(EMEA/H/C/001095/P46/034), for trends of apparent lower antibody persistence for serogroups W 
and Y in the Menveo group compared with previously generated persistence data for Menveo, the 
Authority concurred that results obtained using different assays, which have different sensitivity 
aspects, cannot be directly compared; 
- 
Furthermore, in a study recently conducted in the US (V59_77, 2016-2017) assessing persistence 
of bactericidal antibody titers 4-6 years after administration of either Menveo or Menactra and 
response to a booster dose of Menveo, the manual hSBA was used for titer estimation. 
Seroprotection rates against MenC was 61.82% (95% CI: 56.02%-67.38%) among subjects

vaccinenaïve control subjects. These data are in line with previously generated persistence data

after Menveo priming (reference is made to the Art.46 clinical expert statement for V59_77 
submitted to EMA on August 11, 2018. 
-  Based on all the above mentioned considerations, the Company does not foresee an update of 
current Menveo SmPC. 
Assessment Response 
In their response the MAH points to 1) the limited size of the study therefore limited power and ability 
to make any inferences; 2) the difference in assay preventing direct comparisons with other studies – 
a point which has earlier been accepted by CHMP and 3) that the observations are not in line with 
other studies, specifically referring to study V59_77. 
It is not agreed with the company that because of these reasons the observation that the persistence 
in the MenC arm is similar as compared to the age matched, vaccine-naïve enrolled control subjects, 
can be disregarded. Whilst the small numbers in this study, all persistence data in the SmPC is based 
upon small numbers.  
Nonetheless, this is always kept in mind during assessments – e.g. the observation can be due to 
chance and is in fact not a (lack of) effect of the vaccine. First however other causes have to be 
dismissed. Subject selection and use of other MenC vaccines are two that have been provided by the 
assessor- there may be others the MAH can think of. 
Regarding the difference in assays, it is acknowledged that a direct comparison between titres 
generated in one study to titres generated in a different study should be avoided in particular if the 
assays were different. However the issue here is different – it is the observations that after 4 years 
titres were comparable to those in a age matched vaccine-naïve group that is of concern. This has not 
been seen in other studies for the MenC component, as correctly pointed out by the MAH, nor is this 
risk included in the labelling.  
The latter – inclusion in the labelling - will only be done if it is considered that the risk is vaccine 
related, and this remains unclear. This should be adequately discussed by the MAH. 
Conclusion 
Issue not solved. Whether or not inclusion in the labelling is deemed necessary will depend on whether 
the risk is vaccine related which depends on the answers to the two remaining questions.  
3.  In addition, the MAH should confirm that ‘vaccine naïve subjects’ did indeed not receive any 
meningococcal vaccines, including monovalent MenC vaccines. 
Response MAH 
For study V102_02E2, subjects eligible to be enrolled in the Menveo arm were those who received 
MenACWY vaccine in the parent study V102_02 and received no subsequent meningococcal vaccines. 
Indeed, history of any meningococcal vaccine administration other than vaccination given in the parent 
V102_02 study was an exclusion criterion. 
Furthermore, all 46 subjects enrolled in the Menveo arm in the study met the predefined eligibility 
criteria (Table 14.1.1.3.1 of V102_02E2 CSR).

Assessment Response 
The MAH did not clarify whether the enrolled, age-matched, vaccine naïve subjects received a 
Meningococcal C vaccine or an other meningococcal vaccine – which might explain the similar levels of 
hSBA compared to subjects who received Menveo 4 years previous. The MAH is requested to confirm 
that ‘vaccine naïve subjects’ did indeed not receive any meningococcal vaccines, including monovalent 
MenC vaccines. 
Conclusion 
Issue not solved.  
5.  Additional clarification requested 
1.  The MAH is requested to demonstrate that there is no inadvertent selection in subjects 
included in the extension study, i.e. that the response to vaccination as measured in the parent 
study in those subjects included in V102_02E2 is similar to the response in those NOT included 
in study V102_02E2 – considering both immunogenicity endpoints as reactogenicity endpoints 
in V120_02. 
Response MAH 
GSK would like to underline that study V102_02E2 was a purely descriptive study not powered nor 
designed to formally assess any group difference. GSK provided the investigators of study V102_02E2 
with a complete list of all subjects who completed the previous studies (parent study V102_02 and its 
first extension study V102_02E1) and who were eligible for screening. Subjects were eligible to be 
enrolled into the Menveo group in the V102_02E2 extension trial if they: 
• 
• 
• 
received a single dose of Menveo followed by a dose of placebo in parent study V102_02, 
with the last study vaccine (placebo) in parent study V102_02 given approximately 48 to 
56 months before study V102_02E2 
received Tdap vaccine only in study V102_02E1 (the first extension to study V102_02) 
received no other meningococcal vaccines prior to enrolment in study V102_02E2. 
There were no other criteria (eg, immunogenicity and/or safety results in previous trials) employed to 
select participants in this trial. This is generally accepted as an appropriate method to avoid selection 
bias in vaccine clinical trials and it was deemed sufficient to ensure that the subset of subjects included 
in study V102_02E2 was representative of the whole sample. 
Post-hoc analysis 
To further explore whether subjects who participated in study V102_02 and were enrolled in study 
V102_02E2 differed in terms of vaccine responses from those who enrolled in the parent trial but not 
in the second extension study, GSK analysed immunogenicity and safety endpoints in both groups of 
subjects, as requested by the Agency. The results of these post-hoc analyses are provided with the 
submission and a summary of the results is presented below. 
Immunogenicity

month after vaccination in study V102_02, both for subjects who subsequently participated in study 
V102_02E2 and for those who did not, are presented in Table 1.  
Point estimates for GMTs and the percentages of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 8 at 1 month after 
vaccination in study V102_02 were lower for serogroup C in the group that enrolled in study 
V102_02E2, whereas for serogroups A, W, and Y they were generally higher in the group that enrolled 
in study V102_02E2. In all cases, however, confidence intervals (CIs) were wide and largely 
overlapping. 
Safety 
Solicited adverse events 
In study V102_02, solicited adverse events (AEs) were reported by 72% of subjects who enrolled in 
extension study V102_02E2 and by 64% of subjects who did not enrol in the extension study (Table 
2). Overall in V102_02 study, 67% and 59% of subjects subsequently enrolled in the second extension 
study reported local and systemic solicited AEs, respectively. For subjects not enrolled in V102_02E2, 
local and systemic solicited AEs were both reported by 50% of subjects. 
The most frequently reported local solicited AEs were pain (59%) and induration (30%) in subjects 
enrolled in study V102_02E2, and pain (39%) and erythema (25%) in subject not enrolled in study 
V102_02E2 (V102_02 Post-hoc analysis Table 5). 
The most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs were headache and myalgia in both groups of 
subjects (41% and 42% of subjects enrolled in V102_02E2; 42% and 33% of subject not enrolled in 
V102_02E2).

Results for all solicited local and systemic AEs by event are provided in V102_02 Post-hoc analysis 
Table 5 and Table 6, respectively. 
Unsolicited adverse events 
The results of the post-hoc analysis of V102_02 data show that 35% of subjects who enrolled in 
extension study V102_02E2 and 39% of subjects not enrolled in study V102_02E2 reported any 
unsolicited AE (Table 3). At least possibly related unsolicited AEs were reported by 11% of subjects 
who enrolled in V102_02E2 and by 19% of subjects not enrolled in V102_02E2. 
The most frequently reported at least possibly related unsolicited AEs were induration (9%) and 
myalgia (4%) in subject enrolled in V102_02E2, and headache (6%) in subjects not enrolled in 
V102_02E2 (V102_02 Post-hoc analysis Table 8). Results for all unsolicited AEs by event are provided 
in V102_02 Post-hoc analysis Table 7 (all AEs) and Table 8 (possibly or probably related AEs). No 
serious adverse events were reported by any subject in the Menveo group of the parent study 
V102_02.

Conclusions from the post-hoc analysis 
When looking at the point estimates, the results of the post-hoc analysis show small differences in the 
immune response and reactogenicity between subjects who enrolled and those who did not enrol into 
study V102_02E2. These results of the post-hoc analysis, however, should be interpreted with caution 
considering that:  
• 
• 
• 
for GMTs and percentages of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 8 at 1 month after vaccination in 
study V102_02 the CIs were wide and largely overlapping between the 2 groups of subjects; 
the numbers of subjects included in both groups were relatively low; 
there were no statistical criteria for formal comparison between the 2 groups of subjects. 
Any potential difference in terms of immune response or reactogenicity between subjects enrolled in 
the extension study and subjects not enrolled in the extension study is therefore likely to be due to 
chance. 
Assessment Response 
The MAH was requested to demonstrate that the response to vaccination as measured in the parent 
study in those subjects included in V102_02E2 is similar to the response in those NOT included in 
study V102_02E2. With their post hoc analysis the MAH has done so.  
Whilst there is some variation in vaccine response (immunogenicity) between those who did and did 
not continue in study V102_02E2, these differences do not all point in the same direction for the 
different serotypes. And indeed as the MAH states, numbers are small and CIs are wide. Therefore it is 
likely that these differences are due to chance. Further, the safety in the two groups (subjects included 
in V102_02E2 vs subjects not included in V102_02E2) is similar. 
So it is agreed with the MAH that inadvertent selection of subjects has not taken place. 
Conclusion 
Issue solved.  
2.  The MAH should confirm that ‘vaccine naïve subjects’ enrolled in study V102_02E2 did indeed 
not receive any meningococcal vaccines, including monovalent MenC vaccines.

GSK confirms that vaccine-naïve subjects enrolled in study V102_02E2 did not receive any 
meningococcal vaccines, including monovalent MenC vaccines, prior to or during study V102_02E2 
(except for study vaccine). 
Assessment Response 
The MAH provided the requested clarification.  
Conclusion 
Issue solved.  
3.  Whilst 43% of subjects still had hSBA >1:8 against MenC 4 years after vaccination in study 
V102_02E2, the rate is similar as for those subjects who were not vaccinated (‘vaccine naïve 
subjects’); GMTs are also similar. This could be a result of natural circulation of MenC however 
this would indicate that the persistence of immunity following Menveo for MenC is minimal 
after 4 years, which is not in line with the information currently included in the SmPC. This 
should be adequately discussed by the MAH. 
Response MAH: 
Phase 2 study V102_02E2 was designed to evaluate responses to the investigational pentavalent 
MenABCWY+OMV vaccine. Subjects in the Menveo arm in V102_02E2 study served as a control for 
descriptive purposes. The study was not designed, nor powered, to determine any statistical or clinical 
differences between Menveo-primed and vaccine-naïve subjects, and results from study V102_02E2 
can’t be extrapolated to a wider population. 
Enrolment of subjects in the Naïve group in study V102_02E2 with higher baseline hSBA titers due to 
natural circulation of serogroup C might have occurred, and could potentially account for the relatively 
small differences between primed and vaccine-naïve subjects seen in this study. These potential 
differences, however, are most likely due to chance.  
As part of the Menveo clinical development plan, GSK recently conducted a study in the United States 
(study V59_77) to assess the immunogenicity and safety of one dose of Menveo administered to 
subjects primed with either Menveo or Menactra (Sanofi Pasteur’s quadrivalent meningococcal 
serogroups A, C, W, and Y vaccine) and to vaccinenaïve subjects. Antibody titers against serogroups A, 
C, W, and Y at 4-6 years after primary vaccination with either Menveo or Menactra was assessed at 
day 1 (prevaccination) of this study in a much larger group of subjects (N=296), compared to study 
V102_02E2. The hSBA GMTs and percentages of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 8 in both study groups at 
day 1 (pre-vaccination) in study V59_77 are presented in xxx 
The results from V59_77 show higher hSBA GMTs and percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥ 8 in the 
MenACWY-primed groups, irrespective of the quadrivalent vaccine received 4 to 6 years before, 
compared to the vaccine-naïve subjects. Percentages of subjects with hSBA titers ≥ 8 were higher for 
Menveo-primed subjects (61.82%) than in vaccine-naïve subjects (35.42%), with non-overlapping CIs. 
The same was observed for hSBA GMTs (15.99 and 5.24 in Menveo-primed and vaccine-naïve 
subjects, respectively). The results from study V59_77 are in line with the persistence data already 
reported in the Menveo SmPC.

Given (1) the limitations of the results from study V102_02E2 described above, (2) the very low 
number of subjects in study V102_02E2, and (3) the fact that the data in the SmPC, as well as in 
study V59_77, were generated using a different assay (manual hSBA) compared to study V102_02E2 
(HT-hSBA), GSK does not foresee an update of the SmPC with the data coming from the phase 2 
MenABCWY+OMV study V102_02E2. 
Assessment Response 
Even though the study was not designed to evaluate differences to determine any statistical or clinical 
differences between Menveo-primed and vaccine-naïve subjects, the differences observed were striking 
and form a potential signal that needs to be carefully scrutinized. In their initial analysis the MAH failed 
to adequately discuss all potential explanations for the observed differences.  
Two potential reasons which had not been adequately dismissed were: receipt of prior monovalent 
MenC vaccine in the ‘vaccine naïve group’ and inadvertent selection of subjects into the extension 
cohort. The MAH now confirmed that indeed the vaccine naïve group had not received monovalent 
MenC vaccine prior to enrolment. Further, their post hoc analysis shows that albeit there is some 
variation in vaccine response between those who did and did not continue in study V102_02E2, these 
differences do not all point in the same direction for the different serotypes and therefore it is likely 
that these are due to chance. So it is agreed with the MAH that selection of subjects will unlikely have 
resulted in differences observed between Menveo-primed and vaccine-naïve subjects. 
The MAH suggests that enrolment of subjects in the naïve group in study V102_02E2 with higher 
baseline hSBA titers due to natural circulation of serogroup C might have occurred, and could 
potentially account for differences between primed and vaccine-naïve subjects seen in this study. 
Additionally the MAH considers the differences small and considers that these would be due to chance.  
After determining that the observed difference between the Menveo-primed and vaccine-naïve subjects 
can not be a result of subject selection into study V102_02E2 nor can it be explained by priming of 
vaccine naïve individuals with MenC vaccine it is agreed with the applicant that it is likely the 
differences are indeed due to chance.  
Conclusion 
Issue solved.  As results are based on small numbers and the study was not designed nor powered to 
detect differences between Menveo-primed and vaccine naïve individuals it is possible that differences 
result from chance therefore no update to the SmPC is needed.

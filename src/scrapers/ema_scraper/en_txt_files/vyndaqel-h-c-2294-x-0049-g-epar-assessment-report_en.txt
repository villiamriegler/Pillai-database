1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
Pfizer Europe MA EEIG submitted on 7 January 2019 a group of variations consisting of extension of 
the marketing authorisation and the following variation: 
Variation(s) requested 
C.I.4 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new quality, 
preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
Type 
II 
Extension application to: 
- introduce a new strength (61 mg soft capsules, pack-size of 30 and 90 capsules) and a new 
indication for the "treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis in adult patients with wild-type or hereditary 
cardiomyopathy to reduce all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalisation (ATTR-CM)" 
- introduce qualitative change in declared active substance (tafamidis) not defined as a new active 
substance; 
This is grouped with a type II variation (C.I.4) to update sections 4.6 of the Vyndaqel (tafamidis 
meglumine) 20 mg soft capsules SmPC to add wording pertaining to the Tafamidis Enhanced 
Surveillance for Pregnancy Outcomes (TESPO) programme. 
In addition, the submission of an updated RMP version 9.0 in order to include the proposed new 
dosage/indication, review of the additional data collected from the ATTR-CM clinical program and post 
marketing reporting, reclassification of the safety concerns, removal of HCP educational leaflet.  
Relevant changes are also proposed for Annex II of the product information.  
The MAH is also proposing an update to Section 16 Information in Braille of Annex IIIa - Labelling 
(carton) to differentiate between the dosage forms. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 – Group of variations 
Vyndaqel was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the 2 following conditions, covering the 
claimed targeted ATTR-CM indication:  
- 
Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP, now ATTR-PN) (EU/3/06/401) on 28 August 2006. 
At the time of designation, hereditary ATTR affected below 0.1 in 10,000 people.  In 2012, the 
COMP confirmed that the existing orphan designation for ‘treatment of TTR-FAP’ includes all 
phenotypes of hereditary ATTR, including variant ATTR-CM, even in the absence of 
polyneuropathy symptoms. 
-  Senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA; EU/3/12/1066) on 8 November 2012. At the time of 
designation, ATTR wild type (previously known as SSA) affected approximately 3 in 10,000 
people in the EU.  
In accordance with Art 5(12) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products shall review the criteria provided therein and issue an opinion on the maintenance of the 
orphan designation, which will subsequently be provided to the European Commission to be taken into 
consideration in the decision making process.

Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
(decision number: P/147/2010; waiver number: EMEA-000884-PIP01-10) issued on 11 June 2010 on 
the granting of a product-specific waiver in all subsets of the paediatic population for the condition 
"neuropathic heredofamilial amyloidosis", on the grounds that tafamidis does not represent a 
significant therapeutic benefit for paediatric patients as clinical studies are not feasible in this patient 
population. 
In January 2018, the PDCO confirmed that ‘treatment of cardiomyopathy due to wild-type or variant 
transthyretin in adults’ is considered covered by the condition in the previously mentioned decision.  
Additionally, it was confirmed in February 2018 that this waiver covers applications where it will be 
established that tafamidis free acid is the same active substance as tafamidis meglumine (e.g, an 
extension to existing tafamidis meglumine marketing authorisation). 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products Onpattro and Tegsedi.  
Derogation(s) from market exclusivity 
Not applicable.  
Additional Data exclusivity/Marketing protection 
The MAH requested consideration of one year marketing protection in regards of its application for a 
new indication in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004.  
Scientific Advice 
The MAH received scientific advice from the CHMP on the development for the indication from the 
CHMP on 21 June 2012 (EMEA/H/SA/1074/2/2012/III), 30 May 2013

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication claimed by the Applicant for VYNDAQEL 61mg (micronized tafamidis) is the treatment of 
transthyretin amyloidosis in adult patients with wild-type or hereditary cardiomyopathy to reduce all-
cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalisation.  
This disease, also called ATTR-CM in this document, is caused by the accumulation of misfolded 
transthyretin (TTR) amyloid fibrils in the myocardium. It leads to restrictive cardiomyopathy and heart 
failure, and ultimately death.  
ATTR CM can be of 2 types:  
- hereditary ATTR-CM, also called familial, mutant or variant ATTR-CM, when inherited by mutation in 
the TTR gene, 
- wild-type ATTR-CM, also called senile or non-variant ATTR-CM, when TTR becomes structurally 
unstable with age.    
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Hereditary ATTR-CM is a rare disease. When including all phenotypes of hereditary ATTR (characterized 
by cardiac and/or and polyneuropathy symptoms), the prevalence was estimated to be below 0.1 in 
10,000 people in the EU. 
The Val122Ile mutation allele associated with variant ATTR-CM occurs in 3.3% to 4.0% of the US 
African-American population and is exceedingly rare in White patients (Buxbaum et al. 2006, Quarta et 
al. 2015).   
The prevalence of wild-type ATTR-CM is also defined as rare. This cardiac disease is part of a senile 
systemic amyloidosis (or wild-type ATTR) characterized by combination of various symptoms, 
depending on the organ involve (mostly in the kidneys, heart, gastrointestinal tract, skin and 
tenosynovial tissue). Common clinical features are cardiac dysfunction, renal dysfunction, carpal tunnel 
syndrome and spinal canal stenosis. The prevalence of wild-type ATTR was estimated to be 
approximately 3 in 10,000 people in the EU. 
Though prevalence of wild-type ATTR-CM is uncertain, studies report a prevalence of 13% in heart 
failure patients with preserved ejection fraction (Gilmore et al. 2016, Gonzalez-Lopez 2015), 16% in 
patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis (Castano et al. 
2016), and 5% of patients with presumed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Damy et al. 2016). 
ATTR-CM typically occurs in patients aged 60 years or older, though the Leu111Met variant may 
express ATTR-CM in patients at an earlier age (Rapezzi et al. 2010).  
ATTR-CM is currently associated with mean progression to death within 2 to 3 years (median survival 
25.6 months) of diagnosis for variants and up to 5 years (median survival 43.0 months) for wild type, 
with most patients dying from cardiac causes (Ruberg et al. 2012 and Grogan et al.2016). 
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 9/95 
 
 
 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
TTR amyloidosis is a disease caused by the destabilisation and dissociation of the native TTR tetramer 
which can result in misfolding and the formation of amyloid fibrils and progressive amyloid deposition 
in tissues.     
The 2 major phenotypes which form the spectrum of ATTR amyloidosis are ATTR-CM which primarily 
affects the myocardium, and ATTR-PN, also referred to as transthyretin familial amyloid 
polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP), which primarily affects the peripheral and autonomic nerves. These clinical 
manifestations may occur in isolation or together. Both result in progressively impaired function, and 
ultimately in death.   
ATTR-CM is a fatal disorder, characterised by the deposition of misfolded TTR amyloid fibrils in the 
ventricular walls (extra-myocardial), causing progressive disruption in the ability of the heart to 
effectively pump blood through the circulatory system. In ATTR-CM, the myocardium is the key site of 
ATTR deposition, and accumulation can lead to diastolic dysfunction progressing to restrictive 
cardiomyopathy and heart failure.  
ATTR-CM can be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait caused by mutation in the TTR gene (also 
known as familial amyloid cardiomyopathy), or by deposition of wild-type TTR protein, previously 
called senile systemic or senile cardiac amyloidosis (Jacobson et al. 1997, Saraiva 1995). 
There are more than 120 mutations in the TTR gene which cause a variable phenotype determined by 
the relative extent of amyloid deposition in the myocardium and peripheral nerves. ATTR-CM is 
associated with genetic variants of TTR such as Val122Ile and Leu111Met (Rosenblum et al. 2018, 
Jacobson et al. 1997). 
In wild-type disease, TTR may become structurally unstable with age and result in deposition of 
amyloid fibrils, primarily in heart tissue (Saraiva 2001, Hammarström et al. 2002, Quintas et al. 2001).  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The deposition and accumulation of misfolded TTR amyloid fibrils in the myocardium can lead to 
diastolic dysfunction progressing to restrictive cardiomyopathy and heart failure, with most patients 
dying from cardiac causes, including sudden death, congestive heart failure (CHF), and myocardial 
infarction.   
ATTR-CM (due to both wild-type and variant TTR) uniformly presents with the typical symptoms of 
heart failure (restrictive cardiac disease), including shortness of breath, dyspnoea on exertion, 
orthostatic hypotension, syncope and dysrhythmias including atrial fibrillation.  
Signs of ATTR-CM are assessed via tests performed as part of routine heart failure assessment, 
including electrocardiography, echocardiography, and cardiac biomarkers (eg, NT-proBNP). Findings 
from these objective measures of cardiac involvement include abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) with 
findings including low voltage, left and right ventricular wall thickening by echocardiogram, and 
elevated cardiac biomarkers (Connors et al. 2009). These findings are non-specific for heart failure 
and/or co-morbid conditions are associated with congestive heart failure (i.e, diabetes, hypertension, 
etc), making the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis difficult, resulting in diagnosis delays and under 
diagnosis of ATTR-CM (Rapezzi et al. 2010, Ando et al. 2013, Connors et al. 2016).  
The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification provides a simple way of classifying the extent of 
heart failure. It classifies patients in one of four categories based on their limitations during physical 
activity; the limitations/symptoms are in regards to normal breathing and varying degrees in shortness 
of breath and or angina pain. It is hypothesized that most diagnosed ATTR-CM patients have already 
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 10/95 
 
 
 
symptoms of heart failure, mild symptoms (NYHA Class II), marked limitation (NYHA Class III) or 
severe limitation even at rest (NYHA IV). Mostly hereditary ATTR-CM can be detected early, in a family 
context affecting multiple generations, even before cardiac symptoms (NYHA Class I).  
More specific procedures are necessary for the identification of the disease:  
- Genotyping: The genotyping test is a major tool that should be performed in patients of all age with 
suspicion of ATTR-CM, to identify whether it is hereditary ATTR-CM or not. 
- Biopsy and bone scintigraphy: Definitive diagnosis of ATTR-CM had been dependent upon tissue 
biopsy, in combination with presence of symptomatic heart failure, when the pivotal study B3461028 
was initially designed (Rapezzi et al. 2010). More recently, a non-biopsy approach using technetium-
labeled bone scintigraphy tracers has emerged. This approach is considered highly sensitive and 
specific for diagnosing ATTR-CM in both hereditary and wild-type subjects (Gillmore et al. 2016, 
Castano et al. 2016, Bokhari et al. 2013). It could detect TTR amyloidosis prior to an increase in left 
ventricular wall thickness or the development of clinical syndrome of heart failure and a rise in cardiac 
biomarkers, making early identification and treatment more likely (Hag et al. 2017, Glaudemans et al. 
2014, Galat et al. 2014).  
- TTR identification: TTR precursor protein identification by immunohistochemistry or mass 
spectrometry and exclusion of light-chain amyloidosis (other types of amyloidosis, including AL 
amyloidosis, associated with multiple myeloma, which is an absolute emergency) has to be part of the 
diagnosis too, in order that patients receive the most immediate and adequate treatment for such 
severe disease.  
Due to the different specific tests necessary to identify ATTR-CM without error of diagnosis, some 
specific algorithm for diagnosis of ATTR-CM should be used in order to allow better prognosis with early 
and adequate treatment of patients.  
Wild-type ATTR-CM can be considered as a rare disease for the moment, but this may be partly due to 
underdiagnosis, in the absence of specific symptoms, and with the presence of high comorbidities, high 
age, and with the fact that the disease is unrecognised for the moment. However, there could be a risk 
of overdiagnosis or misuse, if the new tests for diagnosis are overspread, or criteria of diagnosis not 
well followed. 
2.1.5.  Management 
There is currently no approved pharmacologic treatment specifically for ATTR-CM.  
Treatments to manage ATTR-CM symptoms include a broad range of medications used to treat heart 
failure including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor 
blockers, beta-blockers, and second generation calcium channel blockers. Except for these medications 
and pacemaker placement for cardiac arrhythmias, the only treatment option currently available for 
some ATTR-CM patients might be cardiac transplantation, or for some patients with variant type 
disease, orthotopic liver and/or heart transplant might be an option. Transplantation of the liver 
removes the primary production site of amyloidogenic variant TTR protein (Falk 2011, Lewis WD et al. 
1994, Holmgren et al. 1993). Liver transplant may be combined with heart transplant, depending on 
organ availability, patient capacity to tolerate the combined transplant, and the severity of cardiac 
amyloidosis at the time of transplant. However, transplantation is often not an option for ATTR-CM 
patients given their advanced age at diagnosis, as well as their co-morbid burden of illness which 
increases the likelihood of morbidity and mortality associated with the procedure.   
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 11/95 
 
 
 
Given there are currently no approved pharmacological treatments for ATTR-CM, an ultimately fatal 
disease, and the risks and organ availability challenges associated with liver and heart transplantation, 
there is a significant unmet medical need for an effective and safe treatment to slow the progression of 
disease and improve patient outcomes. 
Given the unmet medical need, Vyndaqel 20mg has been available at national level in some Member 
states to treat ATTR-CM (e.g more than 400 treated patients identified in France with VYNDAQEL 20mg 
once daily in April 2019).     
Some other products are also studied in ATTR-CM with recruiting, ongoing or completed clinical trials, 
e.g antisense oligonucleotide (inotersen), small interfering RNA (revusiran, patisiran) or old products 
also known to disrupt amyloid fibrils (doxycycline, diflunisal). Some of them have already been 
approved in the EU, like tafamidis, in ATTR polyneuropathy: Tegsedi (inotersen) approved for the 
"treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hereditary transthyretin 
amyloidosis (hATTR)" and Onpattro (patisiran) for the "treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated 
amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) in adult patients with stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy".

Tafamidis is a compound that binds to TTR at the thyroxine binding sites and inhibits TTR tetramer 
dissociation, the rate limiting step in the amyloidogenic process. By stabilising the tetrameric native 
state of TTR, tafamidis increases the activation barrier associated with tetramer dissociation and 
therefore mimics the tetrameric stabilisation effect observed with naturally occurring protective 
trans-suppressor variants. The result disrupts the amyloid cascade and fibril formation and interrupts 
disease progression.  
It was first intended for the oral treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis in adult patients with 
symptomatic polyneuropathy. Then, it had been hypothesised that tafamidis would stop or slow the 
progression of ATTR-CM.  
Tafamidis stabilised both the wild-type TTR tetramer and the tetramers of 14 TTR variants tested 
clinically after once-daily dosing. Tafamidis also stabilised the TTR tetramer for 25 variants tested ex 
vivo, thus demonstrating TTR stabilisation of 40 amyloidogenic TTR genotypes.     
The specificity of the binding to TTR also limits tafamidis to the treatment of TTR amyloidosis only, with 
no activity anticipated for other types of amyloidosis. 
Vyndaqel 20mg (tafamidis meglumine) is already authorized in the treatment of ATTR in adult patients 
with Stage 1 symptomatic polyneuropathy to delay peripheral neurologic impairment. The MA granted 
in the EU has been approved under exceptional circumstances on the basis of completed ATTR-PN 
Study Fx-005 (B3461020) which was an 18-month, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled phase 2/3 study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of once-daily 20 mg tafamidis 
meglumine in 128 patients with TTR amyloid polyneuropathy with the V30M mutation and primarily 
stage 1 disease. The SOB 0001 related to disease progression and long term safety in the non-
Val30Met patients is assessed annually within the annual re-assessment.   
In the present extension application, the indication claimed by the Applicant for VYNDAQEL 61mg (new 
strength, with micronized tafamidis) is the treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis in adult patients with 
wild-type or hereditary cardiomyopathy to reduce all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related 
hospitalisation. 
Tafamidis is intended for chronic administration on the basis of an objective diagnosis of ATTR-CM. The 
recommended dose is 61 mg tafamidis orally once daily.

Efficacy was demonstrated in a multicentre, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
randomised 3-arm study in 441 patients with wild-type or hereditary ATTR-CM, for both doses studied, 
20mg and 80mg, once daily (B3461028).  
A tafamidis 61 mg formulation was developed to provide a single oral dosage form for the 80 mg dose, 
to aid patient convenience, and claimed as bioequivalent to 4 × 20 mg tafamidis meglumine at 
steady-state. Thus, a dose recommendation of tafamidis 61 mg, bioequivalent to tafamidis meglumine 
80 mg, is proposed for adult patients with ATTR-CM.  
The dose and dosage regimen (tafamidis meglumine 20 mg or 80 mg capsules QD used in the Phase 
2/3 ATTR-CM clinical program) is generally referred to throughout this document as ‘tafamidis’, except 
in those instances where the dosage or regimen were different (ie, Phase 1 studies using both 
tafamidis meglumine and tafamidis free acid).   
The CHMP granted the following new indication within current procedure: “Vyndaqel is indicated for the 
treatment of wild-type or hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis in adult patients with cardiomyopathy 
(ATTR-CM).” 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine) received a Marketing Authorisation in the EU under exceptional 
circumstances on 16 November 2011 on the basis of completed ATTR-PN Study B3461020 (Fx 005), 
and is currently approved for treatment of ATTR-PN in 41 countries and is commercially available in the 
following 25 countries: Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, 
Netherlands,  Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom. 
The approved indication in the EU is for the 'treatment of ATTR in adult patients with stage 1 
symptomatic polyneuropathy to delay peripheral neurologic impairment'.  As a condition of approval, 
and pursuant to Article 14(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the Marketing Authorisation Holder 
(MAH) committed to undertake the following Specific Obligation, Follow-up Measure (FUM) 001: 
Within the planned post-authorisation sub-study of the THAOS [Transthyretin Associated Amyloidosis 
Outcomes Survey] registry, the MAH shall evaluate in non V30M patients the effects of Vyndaqel on 
disease progression and its long term safety as detailed in a Committee for Medicinal Products for 
Human Use (CHMP)-agreed protocol, and shall provide yearly updates on the collected data within the 
annual re-assessment. 
Vyndaqel has 2 separate Orphan Designations in the EU, covering both the approved ATTR-PN 
indication and the claimed targeted ATTR-CM indication:   
- Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP, now ATTR-PN) (EU/3/06/401) on 28 August 2006. At the 
time of designation, hereditary ATTR affected below 0.1 in 10,000 people. In 2012, the COMP 
confirmed that the existing orphan designation for ‘treatment of TTR-FAP’ includes all phenotypes of 
hereditary ATTR, including variant ATTR-CM, even in the absence of polyneuropathy symptoms. 
- Senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA; EU/3/12/1066) on 8 November 2012. At the time of designation, 
ATTR wild type (previously known as SSA) affected approximately 3 in 10,000 people in the EU. It was 
estimated to represent for instance around 22 000 patients in France, 11 000 in Spain, 28 000 in 
Germany, 18 000 in Italy and 13 000 in the UK.  
Several scientific advices were given to the Applicant relating to the proposed pre-clinical/clinical 
development programme for ATTR-CM, including the ATTR-CM phase 3 study design (B3461028) and 
the development of a high-dose tafamidis solid oral dosage form.  
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 13/95 
 
 
 
Scientific advices were also given on the pharmacokinetic comparability of a proposed high-dose 
tafamidis solid PO dosage form (48.8 mg tafamidis free acid capsule formulation) with 4 x 20 mg 
tafamidis meglumine capsules, then, on 3 exploratory relative bioavailability studies, and on a single-
dose, fasted, 2-way crossover BE study comparing 61 mgA tafamidis free acid soft gelatin capsules 
(Test) and 4 x 20 mg tafamidis meglumine soft gelatin capsules (Reference). 
A total of 377 ATTR-CM patients received tafamidis meglumine in completed/ongoing Phase 2/3 
studies. In addition, 348 healthy subjects have received tafamidis (meglumine salt or free acid 
formulations).   
The proposed indication is primarily supported by the efficacy results from a multicentre, international, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised 3-arm phase 3 study (B3461028) in 441 patients with 
wild type or hereditary ATTR-CM, assessing the 2 doses, 20mg and 80mg, once daily.   
Supportive data in patients with ATTR-CM are provided from the phase 2 open-label study B3461025, 
its long-term extension study B3461026, and the long-term extension study B3461045 of the phase 3 
study B3461028.  
Pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers (ascending dose studies B3461015 and B3461040) and 
clinical phase 2 studies assessing PK/PD of tafamidis (B3461020, B3461021 and B3461022 in ATTR-
PN, B3461025 in ATTR-CM) are provided to justify the choice of the new dose of 80mg, i.e 4x20mg of 
tafamidis meglumine once daily, mainly based on analysis of TTR stabilisation according to dose.   
The Applicant replaced the posology of 4x20mg of tafamidis “meglumine” by a new posology with a 
single unit of a new soft gelatine capsule formulation with 48.8mgA of tafamidis (mgA) “free acid”. 
Indeed, the commercial formulation, Vyndaqel, soft gelatin capsule, containing 20 mg tafamidis 
meglumine was considered equivalent to 12.2 milligrams of active tafamidis (mgA) free acid. 
Therefore, the intended high “free acid” formulation was firstly a soft gelatin capsule formulation 
containing 48.8 mgA tafamidis free acid (i.e 4x12.2 mgA of tafamidis (mgA) free acid equivalent to 80 
mg tafamidis meglumine).  
Biopharmaceutic exploratory studies assessed the BA of several tafamidis “free acid” formulations, 
including 1x12.2mgA, 4x12.2 mgA, 5x12.2mgA, 48.8mgA and finally 61mgA (B3461030, B3461050, 
B3461051, B3461052, B3461053).   
Then, following results of the phase I studies, with the approval of the SAWP, it was considered that 
the high “free acid” formulation to be further tested should rather be a soft gelatin capsule formulation 
containing 61 mgA tafamidis free acid to be equivalent to 80mg tafamidis meglumine.  
Lastly, 2 bioequivalence studies have been conducted to compare the new formulation of 61mgA “free 
acid” tafamidis and the 4x20mg tafamidis meglumine commercial formulation.  Study A B3461054 was 
single-dose, fasted, 2-way crossover BE study comparing 61 mgA tafamidis free acid soft gelatin 
capsules (Test) and 4 x 20 mg tafamidis meglumine soft gelatin capsules (Reference). Study B3461056 
was an open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2-sequence, crossover, multiple dose pivotal BE study in 
fasted healthy volunteers comparing, at steady state, 61 mgA tafamidis free acid soft gelatin capsules 
(Test) versus 4 × 20 mg commercial tafamidis meglumine soft gelatin capsules (Reference).

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Tafamidis  meglumine,  the  meglumine  salt  form  of  tafamidis,  is  the  active  substance  contained  in the 
already authorised Vyndaqel 20mg soft capsules (EU/1/11/717/001-002). Tafamidis, the free acid was 
developed for the proposed high dose (61mg) active substance due to concentration-dependent gelling 
produced by the tafamidis meglumine salt in aqueous media. Full information of the active substance 
tafamidis free acid is provided in the dossier. 
General information 
The chemical name of tafamidis is 2-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-1,3-benzoxazole-6-carboxylic acid 
corresponding to the molecular formula C14H7Cl2NO3. It has a relative molecular mass of 308.12 g/mol 
and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of tafamidis was elucidated by a combination of mass spectroscopy, NMR 
analysis (1H-, and 13C-NMR) and FTIR. 
The active substance is a non-hygroscopic white to pink powder. Solubility studies with tafamidis 
showed that the active substance has water solubility < 2 µg/mL at pH 5 and below.  
The active substance has a non - chiral molecular structure.  
While multiple polymorphs are possible for tafamidis, Form 1, the thermodynamically most stable 
anhydrous crystalline form under standard storage and processing conditions, is the form that has 
been developed and is intended for commercial manufacture.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Tafamidis  is  synthesized  in  3  main  steps  using  well  defined  starting  materials  with  acceptable 
specifications. The manufacturing process involves two chemical reaction steps and one recrystallization. 
An  alternative  process  has  been  proposed  to  remove  foreign  matter  by  first  converting  it  to  the 
meglumine salt and then back to the free acid. The alternative process is not anticipated to be necessary, 
but if required, will be validated prior or concurrent with implementation.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Changes to the manufacturing process of the active substance as a result of this extension application 
do not impact on the risk assessment for the presence of nitrosamine impurities. A full risk assessment 
for nitrosamine impurities will be undertaken for the already authorised Vyndaqel product. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
An enhanced development program was executed in accordance with ICH Q8 and ICH Q11. A structured 
quality risk management approach was employed to identify potential critical process parameters and 
critical material attributes based on risk of impact to the tafamidis CQAs. For each step, a combination 
of univariate and multivariate design of experiment (DOE) has been used, although no design space is 
claimed. Ranges for individual parameters were determined utilizing all the combined experimental data. 
The provided DOE data for Step 1 and Step 2 are identical to those submitted and approved for tafamidis 
meglumine. For the third step, a significant level of detail has been provided regarding its development; 
the proposed ranges have been properly justified.  
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  two  sealed,  low  density  polyethylene  (LDPE)  bags.  The  bagged 
material is then inserted in a high density polyethylene (HDPE) drum or equivalent secondary container. 
The  packaging  material  complies  with  the  EC  10/2011  as  amended  on  plastic  materials  and  articles 
intended to come in contact with food. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), particle size (laser light 
diffraction), identification (HPLC, IR), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), inorganic impurities 
(residue on ignition), and organic impurities (HPLC). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
Microbial testing is not included on the specification for tafamidis in accordance with guidance from ICH 
Q6A decision tree  based on the manufacturing process, inability of the finished product to support 
microbial growth and evidence of microbicidal nature of the active substance, routine microbial limits 
testing is not necessary to confirm the microbial quality of the product.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used has been presented. 
Batch analysis data of 14 commercial and pilot scale batches of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020

Stability 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturers 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months at long term (25ºC/60% RH) and 6 
months at accelerate conditions (40ºC/75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
Supportive stability information for the active substance, manufactured at another manufacturer, by 
the proposed commercial process, is also provided for 1 stability batch up to 36 months at 25ºC/60% 
RH and 6 months at 5°C and 40ºC/75% RH. 
The stability samples were evaluated for appearance, assay, degradation products, water content, and 
solid state form (Form 1). Results from stability studies at long term and accelerated conditions 
demonstrate that there are no trends in any of the measured parameters.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 1 batch. The results 
demonstrated that the active substance was not affected by light. 
Results on stress conditions under forced degradation conditions (acid, base, oxidation, thermal, and 
light) to confirm the suitability of the assay and purity methods to separate, quantify tafamidis and 
potential degradation products, and confirm that the methods are stability-indicating were also 
provided on 1 batch. No significant degradation was observed in the thermal/humidity solid samples or 
in the sample solutions exposed to hydrogen peroxide or auto-oxidation. Degradation occurred in the 
acid and base sample solutions heated to 40°C and 60°C, respectively. The solid tafamidis was 
unaffected by light exposure. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months when stored in 
the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Tafamidis will be provided as a size 9.5 oblong reddish brown soft gelatin capsule filled with a white to 
pink coloured suspension. The capsule is printed with “VYN 61” in white. 
The aim of the development of this finished product was to develop an immediate release soft gelatin 
capsule. 
The formulation and process development of tafamidis soft gelatin capsules focused on the quality 
attributes defined in a Quality Target Product Profile (QTTP).  
A single 80 mg tafamidis meglumine soft gelatin capsule was not technically feasible because of 
concentration-dependent gelling produced by the tafamidis meglumine salt in aqueous media. Several 
alternative salts, as well as tafamidis free acid, were evaluated. No gelling was observed with the free 
acid, but gelling was observed with other salts. This result is consistent with the lower solubility of the 
free acid under these pH conditions (6.8, 4.5, and 1.0), compared to the salt forms, which leads to 
lower solution concentrations of tafamidis and the absence of gel formation.  Extensive experimental 
polymorph screening and computational predictions indicated that the anhydrous crystalline free acid 
Form 1 is the thermodynamically stable form at relevant storage conditions. In conclusion, the free 
acid form of tafamidis showed the most suitable physical and chemical properties for development of 
high-dose formulations. The active substance is micronized to increase dissolution rate considering the 
low aqueous solubility, and for better control over particle size distribution and uniformity for

manufacturing. Particle size specifications have been established based on the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and experience with the active substance. 
The excipients were selected based on the need to have a water-dispersible suspension to achieve an 
acceptable dissolution profile. The compatibility of the selected excipients with the active substance is 
based on stability data of the finished product, which is acceptable. The main excipients selected are 
well established, common for this type of formulations, are described in Ph. Eur. except the ink which 
is of in house standard and their functions and amounts are well described. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of 
the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The development approach is based on an understanding of the relationships between formulation inputs 
and process parameters on the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the finished product. 
A  risk  assessment  was  performed  based  upon  prior  knowledge  (including  literature  and  platform 
understanding), as well as the knowledge that had been gained during the transfer of the manufacturing 
process. 
Once the proposed commercial formulation and manufacturing process for the finished product was 
established, an understanding of the relationships between the finished product quality attributes 
identified in the QTPP and the materials and processing parameters used in manufacture was 
developed. A risk assessment was conducted to highlight those process parameters which could 
potentially have an impact on finished product quality attributes. 
The  control  strategy  for  the  finished  product  consists  of  control  of  material  attributes,  control  of  the 
critical process parameters, critical in process controls and release testing. 
Formulation development for the tafamidis capsule was based on the previous knowledge of the tafamidis 
meglumine capsule fill composition. The option to use the same fill formula was quickly ruled out as the 
tafamidis  rapidly  agglomerated  and  separated  from  the  bulk  liquid  fill.  Exploratory  dissolution  testing 
also proved to be slow. 
A  suspension-filled  capsule  was  therefore  targeted  for  development.  For  the  liquid  suspension 
formulation,  the  following  was  desired:  a  base  excipient  that  readily  dispersed  in  aqueous  media,  a 
surfactant to promote dispersion and dissolution of the active substance in the formulation, a viscosity-
enhancing  agent  to  promote  suspension  homogeneity  during  manufacture,  and  an  antioxidant  to 
minimize the risk of oxidative degradation and gelatin cross-linking. 
PEG 400 was chosen as the water miscible liquid base because it promotes rapid dispersion of tafamidis 
suspension following mixing with aqueous media, and it is a commonly used component of soft gelatin 
capsule formulations. Polysorbate 20 was selected as the surfactant based on the degree to which it is 
miscible  with  PEG  400  and  able  to  maintain  a  homogeneous  bulk  fill.  In  combination,  PEG  400  and 
polysorbate  20  constitute  a  base  to  which  other  excipients  were  added  and  assessed  separately  in 
prototypes manufactured exclusively for stability. Povidone K-90 was included to enhance viscosity in 
PEG-based liquids and reduce settling during manufacture. Based on the outcome of the stability testing 
and extensive use in products globally, BHT was selected as the antioxidant for the proposed commercial 
product. 
Studies describing the development of the dissolution method were presented. There are two proposed 
dissolution mediums (Tier 1 and Tier 2).Tier 2 medium will only be used when the presence of gelatin 
shell pellicle formation is observed. However, the CHMP recommends withdrawing Tier 2 medium when 
more stability results will allow confirming the absence of crosslinking. The discriminatory power of the 
dissolution method was investigated using capsules filled with suspensions made with active substance 
of different particle size (milled and unmilled active substance). The dissolution profiles are presented 
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 18/95 
 
 
 
and the f2 similarity comparison for these two profiles demonstrated the profiles are not similar, thus 
supporting the discriminatory capacity of the dissolution method for a relatively small difference in active 
substance  particle  size.  The  discriminatory  power  of  the  dissolution  method  was  also  tested  against 
variant capsule formulations prepared with the intention of disrupting the ability of the drug to readily 
disperse. Again, results support the discriminatory power of the dissolution method. 
The  finished  product  is  a  soft  capsule  for  which  the  same  typical  equipment  (mixer  homogenizer, 
encapsulator, a tumbler dryer followed by tray drying in a tunnel) and scale as the currently authorised 
Vyndaqel 20 mg are used providing a strong basis of knowledge for the development strategy. An overall 
quality risk management approach was employed to identify potentially critical process parameters (raw 
materials,  homogenizer  speed,  mixing  time,  deaeration  time,  gelatin  mass  age,  capsule  fill  weight, 
tumble dry cycle, number of capsules on tray, in process fill moisture, washing cycle, packaging) and 
assess their impact on the finished product quality attributes (appearance, identity, assay, uniformity of 
dose, dissolution, impurities, fill moisture, stability).  
The  primary  packaging  is  PVC/PA/Alu/PVC-Alu/PET/Paper  perforated  unit  dose  blisters.  The  material 
complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 9 main steps: mixing, homogenizing, deaerating, in-line printing, 
encapsulation, drying, washing, drying, and packaging. The process is a standard manufacturing process. 
Critical step of the process are encapsulation and capsule drying. Associated in-process controls were 
described.  
The manufacturing process used to manufacture the registration batches is a standard process for the 
manufacture of soft gelatin capsules. Therefore, validation on production scale batches will be 
completed prior to release of the product for commercial use. The in-process controls are adequate for 
this type of manufacturing.  
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form  appearance  (visual),  identification  (HPLC,  UV),  assay  (HPLC),  content  uniformity  (Ph.  Eur.), 
degradation products (HPLC), dissolution (Ph, Eur.), capsule fill moisture (KF), BHT assay (HPLC), and 
microbial limits (Ph. Eur.).  
There is no degradation observed during manufacture and stability of the finished product. Therefore, 
there is no specified degradant in the finished product specification. The limit established for 
unspecified degradation products is consistent with ICH Q3A. A total degradation product acceptance 
criterion has been established. Analysis of the batches indicated that all batches met the acceptance 
criteria. 
Analysis of the batches revealed no unspecified unidentified impurities exceeding the 
identification threshold, for a maximum daily dose of 61 mg. 
An elemental impurities risk assessment was performed on the finished product. Based on the data, no 
controls or acceptance criteria for individual elemental impurities are proposed, as the risk of elemental 
impurities being present at levels above their PDEs has been established to be negligible by the risk 
assessment process and supporting analytical data.  
Assessment report

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. There are no additional reference standards or materials used for 
testing of the finished product. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 4 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing, 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 12 months under long 
term  conditions  (30°C/75%  RH  and  25  ºC  /  60%  RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of the medicinal 
product  are  representative  to  those  proposed  for  marketing,  but  the  packaging  is  different  from  the 
commercial  one  (3-ply  blister  material  whereas,  a  4-ply  blister  material  and  peel/push  lidding  was 
selected for the commercial blister). As the stability packaging has been demonstrated equivalent to the 
commercial  one,  no  additional  stability  data  were  provided  with  the  commercial  packaging.  As  post 
approval  stability  protocol  and  stability  commitment,  the  applicant  commits  to  inform  the  competent 
authorities  of  any  out  of  specification  stability  results  for  Vyndaqel  61  mg  capsules  packaged  in  the 
proposed commercial packaging. 
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay,  degradation  impurities,  BHT,  dissolution,  capsule  fill 
moisture content, and microbial limits. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. The data 
from the primary stability study demonstrates that there are no significant trends in any of the measured 
parameters. 
A photostability study in 3 batches was carried out according to the ICH Guideline Q1B on Photostability 
Testing  of  New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  All  parameters  measured  for  the  confirmatory 
photostability study met the specifications. No significant difference was noted between the initial results, 
control and exposed samples. Therefore, it is concluded that the finished product is stable to light and 
no precautionary packaging or labelling is required with respect to light. 
To determine the effect of extreme temperature variation, one representative batch was cycled through 
-20˚C for four days followed by 40°C for four days. A second cycle was then performed for -20˚C for 
three  days  followed  by  40°C  for  three  days,  prior  to  the  samples being  tested.  The  results  from  the 
thermal cycling study from one representative batch showed that fluctuations in temperatures from -20
°C to 40°C over two cycles for a total of 1 week at each condition, did not affect any of the capsule 
quality parameters evaluated. 
Forced  degradation  experiments  were  performed  to  establish  the  extent  and  nature  of  potential 
degradation  pathways  and  to  confirm  the  suitability  of  the  HPLC  assay  and  purity  method.  The 
experiments included thermal, thermal humidity, and photolysis studies. Data showed no degradation

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and finished 
product and their manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the 
manufacturing process of the active substance and finished product 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- To withdraw Tier 2 medium when more stability results will allow confirming the absence of 
crosslinking 
2.3.  Nonclinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
This Line Extension application introduces a new indication (ATTR-CM) with a new human recommended 
dose (61 mg QD), including replacement by a different salt (tafamidis free acid). Only few modifications 
have been made in the submitted nonclinical package in comparison of the nonclinical package previously 
authorised in MAA for treatment of ATTR-PN. In order to detail,  
-  regarding  drug  substance  modification,  the  original  MA  was  obtained  with  tafamidis  meglumine  as 
active substance. Tafamidis meglumine, is the meglumine salt form of tafamidis free acid, the only active 
ingredient  contained  in  tafamidis  meglumine.  The  nonclinical  studies  have  been  performed  with  both 
tafamidis  meglumine  or  tafamidis  free  acid  and  were  contributive  to  the  toxicological  profile  for  both 
tafamidis forms (salt or free acid). 
- regarding drug product modification, since the current MAA is requested for tafamidis free acid, a new 
formulation is developed in order to obtain soft capsules, same as in the previous MAA, however, the 
excipients are different. The final formulation has not been assessed in nonclinical studies, it is acceptable 
since the used excipients are usual and does not raise any specific concerns.   
- regarding the new indication (ATTR-CM), there are no new primary pharmacodynamics (PD) studies 
since the time of the current Vyndaqel MA and subsequent variations. Tafamidis is as a specific stabilizer 
of transthyretin (ATTR) tetramer and has been developed in ATTR-PN and ATTR-CM. In vitro data with 
tafamidis meglumine and/or tafamidis free acid have been reported to decrease fibril formation of WT, 
and amyloidogenic mutants of TTR (variant forms of the ATTR-PN form and variant forms of ATTR-CM) 
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 21/95 
 
 
 
and no relevant animal disease model to evaluate TTR stabilizers were available. The absence of new 
studies is acceptable.  
- finally, regarding the recommended dose increase, the Applicant has reviewed every calculated margin 
of exposure or safety margins since at a clinical dose of 20 mg/day tafamidis meglumine the measured 
steady state mean human Cmax and AUC24 are 2.66 µg/mL and 49.6 µg• h/mL respectively and at a clinical 
dose of 61 mg/day tafamidis, the steady state mean human Cmax and AUC24 are 8.55 µg/mL and 170 µg
• h/mL  respectively.  Consequently,  the  Applicant  has  modified  the  SPC  according  to  these  new  lower 
safety margins. There are no safety margins for liver effects at the new clinical recommended 61 mg 
tafamidis free acid and the SPC section 5.3 was therefore updated.  
Since the time of the MA and subsequent variations, a total of 11 new nonclinical studies were conducted 
and  have  been  reported  in  the  nonclinical  package.  Only  these  11  new  studies  are  presented  in  this 
report and the previous overviews of pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and toxicology are updated with 
the 11 new studies and the lower safety margins. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
No new primary pharmacodynamic studies since the time of the current Vyndaqel MA and subsequent 
variations are provided.  
Familial amyloidosis, the most frequently inherited amyloidosis, is caused by an accumulation of insoluble 
fibrillar proteins (amyloid) in the tissues in sufficient amount to impair normal functioning. The two major 
phenotypes 
include  transthyretin  amyloid  polyneuropathy  (also  known  as 
familial  amyloid 
polyneuropathy,  or  ATTR-PN),  primarily  affecting  the  peripheral  nerves  and  TTR  amyloid 
cardiomyopathy,  (also  known  as  familial  amyloid  cardiomyopathy  or  ATTR-CM  when  associated  with 
variant  TTR,  or  senile  systemic  amyloidosis  or  SSA  when  associated  with  wild-type  TTR)  primarily 
affecting the myocardium. 
TTR is a transport protein for thyroxine (T4) and retinol-binding protein-retinol complex. It is secreted 
by the liver as homotetramers and is present in this form in plasma. By binding to both tetrameric wild-
type and amyloidogenic variants of TTR, tafamidis inhibits tetramer dissociation, the rate limiting step in 
the formation of TTR amyloid, thereby disrupting the progression of ATTR. 
Tafamidis free acid binds to TTR with negative cooperativity with dissociation constants of 2-3 nM (Kd1) 
and 154-278 nM (Kd2) and with a stoichiometry of 0.81 ± 0.02 thus demonstrating specificity to TTR 
over  all  other  plasma  protein.  Under  physiological  conditions,  tafamidis  free  acid  almost  completely 
stabilized  tetramer  dissociation  at  a  concentration  Tafamidis:TTR  of  1.5.  Under  acidic  conditions  that 
induce  fibril  formation,  tafamidis  free  acid  stabilized  wild-type  TTR  and  the  two  disease-related  TTR 
variants V30M and V122I and prevented fibril formation with an EC50 of the order of TTR physiological 
concentration. TTR tetramers dissociate into unfolded monomers in the presence of urea, thus preventing 
their reassociation into a tetramer. Under urea denaturation conditions, tafamidis meglumine and free 
acid  stabilized  in  a  concentration-dependant  manner  TTR  tetramers  in  plasma  of  normal  individuals, 
V30M or V122I mutation-carrying patients. Tafamidis was also shown to be effective in the stabilization 
of 26 other TTR variants. 
The Applicant submitted only in vitro primary pharmacodynamics studies. The absence of in vivo studies 
is  acceptable  since  no  validated  model  of  ATTR  disease  was  available  at  the  time  of  nonclinical 
development. 
The binding selectivity of tafamidis was investigated. In an assay testing the binding of tafamidis to more 
than 50 enzymes or receptors, tafamidis free acid was found to notably bind to δ-2 opioid receptor with 
an  IC50  of  8.3  µM.  It  exerted  a  concentration-dependant  agonistic  activity.  There  is  a  possible 
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 22/95 
 
 
 
mechanistic link between agonism of δ-2 opioid receptors and the dose-related emesis observed in the 
dog,  it  was  demonstrated  that  it  only  happens  at  supra-clinical,  and  therefore  nonrelevant,  doses  of 
tafamidis.  NSAIDs  are  known  to  bind  to  TTR.  Specific  assays  were  conducted  to  know  if  tafamidis 
meglumine  also  shares  their  COX-inhibiting  properties.  The  results  showed  no  significant inhibition  of 
COX-1  or  COX-2  activities.  This  is  consistent  with  the  outcome  of  the  in  vitro  receptor  and  enzyme 
binding  assay.  Furthermore,  it  is  expected  that  tafamidis  will  preferentially  bind  to  TTR,  even  in  the 
presence of diflunisal or diclofenac, and that no significant pharmacodynamic drug interaction would be 
observed. 
Regarding safety pharmacology, tafamidis underwent the core battery studies. Tafamidis meglumine 
was tested for its effects on CNS in an acute neurotoxicity study in rats. Tafamidis meglumine induced 
no adverse neurological effects up to 100 mg/kg. In vivo, no changes in respiratory, body 
temperature, or blood gases were recorded in telemetered dogs up to 300 mg/kg. Regarding effects on 
cardiovascular system, no effects on heart rate or hemodynamic parameters were found in conscious 
telemetered dogs administered up to 300 mg/kg. However, a dose-dependent stimulation of Ikr 
current attaining up to 9.3% at 30 µM was detected in vitro. In vivo, dog electrocardiograms showed a 
prolongation of QRS interval (3% and 6% at 100 and 300 mg/kg respectively) and a shortening of QTc 
interval (3% to 6% at 100 mg/kg and 4 to 6% at 300 mg/kg). However, given the severity of the 
disease and since no concern arose from clinical assessment, it could be considered that the 
benefit/risk ratio is favourable. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Eight  new  in  vitro  DDI  studies  were  presented  by  the  Applicant  in  this  current  MAA.  Therefore,  PK 
overview has been updated with these new data. 
Absorption 
In in vitro studies, tafamidis meglumine was well absorbed through transcellular transport. It was not a 
substrate of OAT, OCT, MRP2 or P-gp transporters but it showed an inhibitory effect on the OATP and/or 
BCRP  and  MRP  transporters  while  a  slight  inhibition  was  observed  on  P-gp  transporter  at  higher 
concentrations.  In  vivo,  different  vehicles  were  used  during  preclinical  development.  After  single 
administration, exposure was greater when tafamidis meglumine was formulated as a solution in 7.5% 
Vitamin TGPS instead of a suspension in 0.5% CMC in rats and in dogs. Food seems to decrease exposure 
to tafamidis in non-fasted rats. The bioavailability was complete or almost complete (108% in rats and 
91% in dogs) based on 24-hour studies. Plasmatic half-life is 29-43 hours in rats and 55-62 hours in 
dogs. Distribution volumes were small (316 mL/kg in rats and 317 mL/kg in dogs) and correspond to 
extracellular  water  content.  Repeated  dose  studies  showed  saturation  of  absorption  in  dogs  and 
accumulation in mice, rats and dogs after repeated dosing. 
Distribution 
Tafamidis  is  widely  distributed  in  rats.  The  highest  concentrations  were  found  in  harderian  glands, 
stomach and liver. After 168 hours, tafamidis was still present in a majority of tissues. Regarding protein 
binding, in vitro studies determined a percentage of binding of 97.1% in mice, 99.0%in rats, 99.1% in 
dogs and 99.2% in humans. Binding to human plasma is predominantly due to significantly binding to 
the  HSA  component  (>99.6%  with  Human  Serum  Albumin  and  12%  with  α-1-Acid  Glycoprotein). 
Distribution in blood cells revealed that it is not particularly associated with blood cells. Tafamidis crosses 
the placental barrier, rat fetuses receiving to up 4% of the administered dose to the dams.

Metabolism 
In vitro, tafamidis was not readily metabolised by rat, dog or human S9 and was stable in presence of 
mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and human hepatic microsomes, 94% of unchanged tafamidis remaining at the 
end of  incubation.  In  vivo,  tafamidis  plasma  metabolism  was  studied  in  mice,  rats,  rabbits,  dogs  and 
humans. The metabolism was not extensive. Three metabolic pathways are proposed: glucuronidation 
mediated by UGT (mainly 1A9, 1A1 and 1A3 and in a minor extent 1A6, 1A7, 1A8 and 2B7), sulphation 
and oxidation. In humans, the only metabolite was acylglucuronide. Acylglucuronide metabolite was also 
the  major  metabolite  in  all  tested  species  excepting  in  rabbits  where  the  only  metabolite  was  the 
monoxide  also  found  in  mice.  The  dog  showed  a  sulphate  conjugate  not  found  in  any  other  species. 
Acylglucuronides  have  been  increasingly  identified  as  reactive  electrophilic  metabolites,  capable  of 
undergoing  intermolecular  reactions  with  proteins  leading  to  covalent  drug-protein  adducts,  initiating 
toxicity/immune responses, the liver being the target organ (Bailey and Dickinson, 2003; Skonberg et 
al, 2008).  
Tafamidis did not significantly inhibit CYP2C9/19, 1A2, 2D6 and 3A4. It showed an inhibitory effect on 
CYP2C8. Tafamidis induced CYP3A4 in cryopreserved human hepatocyte cultures from female donors but 
not from males. This effect is minimal in presence of albumin. 
Excretion 
Excretion is slow: only 88% of the administered dose is excreted after 168 hours. Mass balance studies 
with cannulated rats showed that tafamidis is subjected to enterohepatic recycling. The main excretion 
route  is  the  bile  (~48%)  while  feces  represents  21-24%  of  total  excretion  and  urine  19-21%.  Renal 
elimination  of  tafamidis  as  parent  compound  is  low,  the  major  urinary  metabolite  being  the 
acylglucuronide.  Tafamidis  is  excreted  in  milk  and  is  systemically  absorbed  by  pups  from  the 
gastrointestinal tract.  
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
The potential for tafamidis to cause enzyme-mediated DDI from systemic inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 is 
unlikely. Tafamidis may inhibit the intestinal activities of UGT1A1. Tafamidis did not induce CYP1A2, but 
did  induce  CYP2B6  and  CYP3A4,  however  20  mg  tafamidis  meglumine  did  not  significantly  affect  the 
pharmacokinetics  of  midazolam  in humans.  Based  on  these negative  CYP3A4  induction  results,  it  can 
also be concluded that the likelihood of CYP2B6 clinical induction is low. The potential for tafamidis to 
cause  transporter-mediated  DDI  by  inhibiting  MDR1  (P-gp)  (systemically  and  in  the  GI  tract),  OCT2, 
OATP1B1,  OATP1B3,  MATE1,  and  MATE2K  is  unlikely.  However,  tafamidis  has  the  potential  to  inhibit 
BCRP (systemically and in the GI tract), OAT1, and OAT3 at clinically relevant concentrations. Additional 
DDI  risk  assessments  were  performed  for  BCRP,  OAT1,  and  OAT3  inhibition  using  mechanistic  static 
models  to  estimate  the  maximal  increase  in  AUC  of  substrates  of  these  transporters  when  co-
administered with tafamidis. The maximal increase in the plasma AUC of rosuvastatin due to inhibition 
of BCRP in the GI tract is estimated to be 92% when dosed with 20 mg/day tafamidis meglumine and 
98% when dosed with 61 mg/day tafamidis free acid. The maximal estimated increase in AUC of OAT1 
and OAT3 substrates was determined to be less than 25% for both the 20 mg/day tafamidis meglumine 
and  61  mg/day  tafamidis free  acid  doses.  The  potential  interactions  of  tafamidis  at  clinically  relevant 
concentrations are reflected in the SPC. In conclusion, pharmacokinetic data support the use of tafamidis 
for  the  treatment  of  transthyretin  amyloidosis  in  adult  patients  with  wild  type  or  hereditary 
cardiomyopathy to reduce all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalization.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Three new in vitro genotoxicity studies on starting material/impurity were presented by the Applicant in 
this current MAA. Therefore, toxicology overview has been updated with these new data. 
Single dose toxicity was assessed only in dogs. No mortality or serious adverse effects were observed 
up to 600 mg/kg. The acute oral toxicity of tafamidis in dogs can be considered as low. 
In repeat dose toxicity studies, tafamidis was tested in mice up to 28 days, in rats up to 26 weeks and 
in dogs up to 39 weeks. At high doses, tafamidis caused mortality in mice, rats, and dogs. Target organs 
identified  in  these  studies  included  liver,  kidney,  and  gastrointestinal  tract.  Other  findings  related  to 
administration of tafamidis included clinical observations (some indicative of an effect on the CNS) and 
effects on clinical pathology parameters, lymphoid tissues, bone marrow, and heart. 
Stomach necrosis and distension in rats and emesis and abnormal faeces in dogs were observed. 
The liver appeared as target organ for toxicity in the different species tested (increased liver weight and 
increased total bilirubin in rats and dogs associated with some changes in liver enzymes). The mechanism 
has not been determined. However, the hepatic findings were observed at safety margins >3 for 20 mg 
of tafamidis meglumine and ≥0.7 for 61 mg of tafamidis free acid. These findings are monitorable via 
standard clinic endpoints and have generally been shown to be reversible. Given the available clinical 
data from patients treated with the 61 mg dose of tafamidis, the safety margins were updated, and in 
light of these new safety margins, no safety margin was able to be defined for liver effects and this the 
only relevant finding requiring an update of Section 5.3 of the SmPC (see comment on SPC section 5.3). 
Renal  nephrosis  was  observed  in  male  Tg.rasH2  mice  with  a  higher  incidence  and  severity  at  90 
mg/kg/day and not observed at ≤30 mg/kg/day, with corresponding AUC24 values, which were ≤9.6x 
and ≤2.8x the human steady state AUC24 at clinical doses of 20 mg tafamidis meglumine and 61 mg 
tafamidis, respectively. These findings are monitorable via standard clinic endpoints and have generally 
been shown to be reversible. 
Lymphoid  depletion,  especially  thymus  depletion  and  atrophy  was  shown  in  rodents.  Red  blood  cells 
parameters were decreased in rats whereas they were increased in dogs. In female animals, tafamidis 
induced estrous disruption in mice, increased ovaries and uterus weight in rats, but decreased ovaries 
weight in dogs. The NOEL was 10 mg/kg in mice and the NOAELs were 30 mg/kg in rats and 45 mg/kg 
in dogs. 
Tafamidis  underwent  the  conventional  genotoxicity  battery.  The  Ames  test  and  the  micronucleus  rat 
were  negative.  In  the  chromosomal  aberration  assay,  a  dose-dependent  increase  of  polyploidy  was 
observed in the presence of S9.  
No carcinogenic potential was observed in transgenic rasH2 mice treated up to 90 mg/kg for 26 weeks 
and in Sprague-Dawley rats up to 30 mg/kg for 2-years. General signs of toxicity consisting in hepatic 
and  renal  lesions  in  mice  and  in  rats  and  these  finding  are  consistent  with  those  seen  previously  in 
toxicity studies. 
The fertility study did not reveal any concern regarding reproductive toxicity in males or in females. In 
rats, tafamidis induced maternotoxicity (mortality at 45 mg/kg, decreased body weight at 30 mg/kg). It 
showed foetotoxicity at ≥30 mg/kg (decreased body weight). It was not teratogenic. 
In rabbits, tafamidis induced maternotoxicity at low doses: at ≥2 mg/kg, reduced body weight gain was 
shown and at 8 mg/kg, two does aborted and were subsequently sacrificed. In the 8 mg/kg group, the 
number of late resorptions was increased. Regarding development, skeletal abnormalities were seen at 
≥2  mg/kg  and  the  number  of  foetuses  and  litters  with  any  alteration  was  increased.  They  mainly 
consisted in head and eye abnormalities seen in 3 foetuses from 2 litters. 
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 25/95 
 
 
 
In the peri- and postnatal study, tafamidis induced mortality in F0 dams at 15 mg/kg and higher. The 
dams of the 30 mg/kg high dose group were sacrificed because there were no surviving pups in 20 litters 
out of 25. In the F1 generation, all pups of the high dose group died between PND 1 to 4and 2 pups of 
the mid dose group died during the post-weaning period and had lower body weight. Pups from the mid-
dose  group  also  showed  head  and  eye  abnormalities,  retardation  in  male  sexual  maturation  and 
decreased  learning  performance.  The  F1  generation  had  no  alteration  of  mating  or  reproductive 
performance, but F2 generation had lower foetal body weight and rotated limbs. 
Tafamidis was not phototoxic in a study in pigmented rats and did not affect T-cell dependent antibody 
responses (TDAR) in mice. A synthetic starting material and 2 potential impurities were not mutagenic 
in bacterial assays. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A new ERA is submitted by this Applicant according to the current guideline since the environment 
exposure will increase with a higher population exposure (new indication and higher posology). Fpen 
refinement is different with addition of the second indication (more patients affected in ATTR-CM) and 
consequently the calculated PEC increase. Moreover, the higher posology conducted also at a higher 
PECsw. As a result, the Applicant highlighted that PECsw reached the PEC action limit of 0.01 µg/L. No 
phase II data have been provided; however the Applicant has already planned a phase II tier A and 
will be available 4Q 2020. This proposed approach and timetable are acceptable.   
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Since the time of the MA for ATTR-PN indication and subsequent variations, a total of 11 new non-clinical 
studies were conducted and have been reported in the nonclinical package. These new studies revealed 
no special hazard for humans.  
GLP  
All pivotal studies in the original non-clinical package were GLP-compliant. For the 11 new studies, the 
8 in vitro DDI studies were not GLP-compliant, and 3 genotoxicity studies with impurities were GLP-
compliant. This was considered acceptable. 
Regarding the recommended dose increase in the new agreed indication (20 mg tafamidis meglumine to 
61 mg tafamidis free acid), the applicant has updated PK parameters collected in clinical trials in patients 
treated by 61 mg tafamidis free acid. The safety margins cited in section 5.3 of the SmPC of Vyndaqel 
61 mg were therefore updated (compared to these cited in section 5.3 of Vyndaqel 20 mg). There is no 
safety margin for liver effects in different species tested and for reprotoxicity in rats and rabbits. The 
updated wording of section 5.3 of the SmPC has reflected this new absence of safety margin. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
It is considered that the toxicological package available with tafamidis supports the marketing 
authorization of Vyndaqel for the proposed indication (ATTR-CM).  
The wording of the section 5.3 of the SmPC for Vyndaquel 61 mg meglumine reflects the absence of 
the safety margins for liver effects in different species tested and for reprotoxicity in rats and rabbits.

Bioavailability 
No study was performed on Tafamidis free acid absolute bioavailability. 
Bioequivalence 
Bioequivalence of Tafamidis free acid, and particularly the 61 mg free acid capsule, compared to the 
commercial 20 mg Tafamidis meglumine (at the dose of 80 mg) was explored in Studies B3460154 
(single dose fast and fed state) and B3461056 (multiple doses, fasted state). 
Comparing the two treatments in Study B3461054 after a single dose in fasted state, there was 
underexposition with 61mg Tafamidis free acid (0.80 fold for Cmax) compared to 80 mg Tafamidis 
meglumine. In fed state there was overexposition with 61mg Tafamidis free acid (1.21 and 1.24 fold 
for AUClast and Cmax) compared to 80 mg Tafamidis meglumine. 
At steady state under fasted condition, however, with Study B3461056, bioequivalence could be 
proven between 61 mg Tafamidis free acid and 80 mg Tafamidis meglumine. 
Bioequivalence between 61 mg Tafamidis free acid and 80 mg Tafamidis meglumine was proven at 
steady state (fasted). However, it could not be proven after single dose, which is the most relevant 
and discriminant according to the guideline for evaluation of bioequivalence. Therefore, it cannot be 
considered that bioequivalence has strictly been proven (and this term should be taken off in the 
SmPC), which is a serious concern since most efficacy data come from 4*20 mg Tafamidis meglumine 
treatments. Please refer to the B/R discussion for relevance of this non-bioequivalence on benefit-risk.   
The applicant justified why steady state conditions are the most relevant here. They acknowledged 
that bioequivalence has not been proven, but in the context, changes in exposure, and higher Cmax in 
particular, are not expected to be relevant.  
Influence of food 
Assessing food effect for both treatments, for the 61 mg Tafamidis free acid, there was over-exposition 
in fed state (1.32 fold for Cmax), and for the 80 mg Tafamidis meglumine there was under-exposition 
in fed state (0.85 fold for Cmax). AUCs were never impacted by food effect. 
B3461054 study was a single-dose cross-over relative bioavailability study under fasted and fed 
conditions. One objective of this study was to estimate the effect of food on the once daily tafamidis 61 
mg formulation. The relative bioavailability (90% CI) of tafamidis 61 mg fed compared to fasted were 
106.10% (98.40%, 114.39%), 108.10% (101.71%, 114.88%) and 132.41% (121.02%, 144.87%) for 
AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax, respectively. Therefore, co-administration of tafamidis 61 mg with a meal 
demonstrated increases in AUCinf (6%) and Cmax (32%). 
Simulations using the population PK model suggest the difference in steady-state Cmax under fed 
conditions is <10% compared to fasted conditions, which is considered not to be clinically meaningful 
(Study Report PMAR-EQDDB346aOther-452). 
All Phase 2/3 efficacy and safety trials with tafamidis meglumine and tafamidis formulations have been 
performed without regard to meals. Given the clinically unimportant differences in exposure under fed 
conditions, no dosage adjustments or time restrictions between meal and drug intake are necessary.

Regarding food effect, the scientific advice accepted that the multiple dose study could be performed 
under fasted condition, however it also noted that “If a significant food effect will be detected for the 
61 mgA tafamidis free acid formulation, it might be necessary to adapt the method of administration 
wording in the SmPC from can be "taken with or without food" to "to be taken on empty stomach”. 
The CHMP agreed that the wording of the method of administration of tafamidis 61 mg in section 4.2 of 
the SmPC is "taken with or without food".  
Distribution 
Tafamidis is highly protein bound (>99%) in plasma. The binding of tafamidis (10 μM or 3.08 μg/mL) 
to human serum albumin or α1-Acid Glycoprotein is >99.6% and 12%, respectively. Tafamidis binds to 
albumin with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.1 to 2.5 μM or 0.65 to 0.77 μg/mL. 
The apparent steady-state volume of distribution for tafamidis meglumine is approximately 16 L (11.5 
L central compartment and 4.51 L peripheral compartment). 
Elimination 
Based on population PK results, the mean steady-state half-life is approximately 49 hours, and the 
apparent oral clearance of tafamidis meglumine is 0.228 L/h 
Excretion 
The results from the human mass balance study (B3461017 [Fx1A- 107] Report Body Section 11.4) 
indicated that faecal excretion represented the major pathway for elimination with mean faecal 
recovery accounting for 58.5% of the total dose administered versus 22.4% recovered in urine. This is 
consistent with nonclinical data which demonstrated biliary excretion and evidence of enterohepatic 
recycling. 
Most of the radioactivity in plasma and faeces was accounted for by unchanged parent drug, tafamidis, 
while in urine the major radiolabeled compound was a glucuronide metabolite. 
Metabolism 
In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that tafamidis is metabolized by glucuronidation to an 
acylglucuronide (Studies 400477, 401242, 400699, 400553, and 401485). Given the predicted lack of 
reactivity for tafamidis acylglucuronide relative to other structural motifs, the low extent of metabolism 
through this pathway, the low incidence of events that could represent hypersensitivity reactions, the 
clinical relevance of this potential toxic mechanism seems low. The Phase II conjugating enzymes 
uridine 5'- diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A9, UGT 1A1, and UGT 1A3 appear to be the 
major isoforms responsible for the formation of the acylglucuronide, while minor activity was observed 
with UGT isoforms 1A6, 1A7, 1A8, and 2B7 (Study 401242). 
Interconversion, PK of metabolites, and consequences of possible genetic polymorphism 
Not applicable, this was discussed in the first application. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality and time dependency of tafamidis free acid was not explored, the applicant should 
discuss if changes in absorption with the free acid could occur at different dose, or if the changes in 
absorption with the free acid impact time dependency.

Intra and inter-subject variability 
Variability for AUCtau and Cmax, based on %CV ranged from 18% to 23% for both formulations. 
Intrasubject variability for the free acid form has not been explored. 
PK in target population 
Population PK modelling (described afterwards) showed that steady state exposure change for patients 
with ATTR-PN compared to healthy volunteers and patients with ATTR-CM was less than 10%. 
Special populations 
• 
• 
Impaired renal function: The effects of creatinine clearance on tafamidis PK were evaluated in 
the population PK analysis (Report PMAR-EQDD-B346a-Other-452); PK estimates indicated no 
difference in steady-state clearance of tafamidis in patients with creatinine clearance <80 
mL/min compared to those with creatinine clearance >80 mL/min. Therefore, no dosage 
adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment. 
Impaired hepatic function: Study Fx1A-105 (B3461016) evaluated the PK of tafamidis 
meglumine in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Subjects with severe hepatic 
impairment were not evaluated. Based on these data and previously known PK of tafamidis, no 
dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. No 
data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
•  Gender: Based on population PK results, the pharmacokinetics of tafamidis were not 
significantly affected by gender. This is consistent with Study B3461018 that demonstrated 
similarity in the observed noncompartmental PK parameters between males and females. 
•  Race: Based on population PK results, the PK of tafamidis were not significantly affected by 
race. Study B3461009 evaluated the PK of tafamidis meglumine in Japanese and Western 
healthy volunteers but no statistical comparison was performed. 
•  Weight: In the population Pk modelling, Body weight was a structural covariate in the model as 
exponents for CL/F, Vc/F, Q/F and Vp/F. The estimates were 0.618 for CL/F and Q/F, and 
0.545 for Vc/F and Vp/F. However, the effect of body weight on tafamidis steady-state 
exposure was less than 20% and clinically not meaningful. 
• 
Elderly: Based on population PK results, subjects above 65 years had an average 15% lower 
estimate of Tafamidis clearance at steady-state compared to subjects <65 years. This 
difference in clearance results in <20% increases in mean Cmax and AUC compared to 
younger subjects and is not clinically significant. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary 
in subjects above 65 years. 
•  Children: There is no relevant use of Tafamidis in the paediatric population. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
The most relevant data for exposure for safety evaluation are from steady state after 61 mg tafamidis 
free acid QD: 
•  Cmax,ss : 8.553 microg :mL (CV 23%), 
•  AUCtau,ss : 170 microg.h/mL (CV 23%).

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action and Primary pharmacology (from initial application in ATTR-PN):  
Tafamidis meglumine is a novel, specific stabilizer of tetrameric wild-type and amyloidogenic TTR that 
binds to the native tetrameric form of TTR and thereby inhibits tetramer dissociation and TTR amyloid 
formation. This novel class of TTR stabilizer drug has the potential to slow the progression of ATTR. 
Dissociation of the TTR tetramer to monomers is the rate limiting step in the pathogenesis of TTR 
amyloidosis. The folded monomers undergo partial denaturation to produce alternatively folded 
monomeric amyloidogenic intermediates. These intermediates then misassemble into soluble 
oligomers, profilaments, filaments, and ultimately, amyloid fibrils. All disease-associated mutations 
characterized thus far destabilize the TTR tetramer and many influence the velocity of rate-limiting 
tetramer dissociation.  
A proprietary stabilisation assay has been developed and validated by the Applicant to directly 
determine the effects of tafamidis in plasma samples from patients receiving tafamidis. The method is 
based on the determination of the abundance of the tetrameric form of TTR, measured by 
immunoturbidimetry, after a 2-day denaturation in 4.8 M urea. The denaturation of TTR in urea 
requires the dissociation of the tetramer to the monomer. Therefore, in urea, the abundance of the 
tetrameric form of TTR is directly linked to the rate of tetramer dissociation and the stability of the TTR 
fold.  
The TTR stabilisation was calculated as follows: the fraction of initial tetramer concentration was 
calculated before and after treatment (FOI dosed) with tafamidis at different timepoints. The percent 
stabilisation of TTR tetramer is defined as follows: 
Percent stabilisation = [average FOIdosed – average FOIbaseline]/ average FOIbaseline  x 100. 
Consequently, a percent stabilisation value of 100% has a two-fold increase in the fraction of initial 
value over baseline and a percent stabilisation of 200% has a three-fold increase in the fraction of 
initial value over baseline. 
The main results on TTR stabilisation were presented in study after single and repeated administration 
of tafamidis (Fx-002):  
The percent of TTR stabilisation varies with the average concentration of tafamidis at Tmax. The dose 
selection is based on the demonstration that a plateau is reached from TTR stabilisation (with range of 
differences from baseline:117-234), determining a tafamidis:TTR stoichiometry of 1.2-1.4.  
Based on single-dose PK data extrapolated to steady-state for tafamidis a dose of 20 mg tafamidis per 
day  corresponds  to  a  range  of  tafamidis:TTR  stoichiometry  of  1.2  to  2  which  is  compatible  with  TTR 
stabilisation. 
The selection of 20 mg as the therapeutic dose relies on an extrapolation from other doses, based on 
the  linearity  demonstrated  for  tafamidis  for  doses  between  15  and  30  mg,  as  no  data  after  repeated 
administration of 20 mg tafamidis were generated. 
Secondary pharmacology  
QTc prolongation: No inhibition of the hERG potassium channel current in transfected human kidney 
embryo 293 cells was observed at tafamidis concentrations of 1, 3, 10 and 30 µM. No effect on QTc 
interval prolongation was observed when a supra-therapeutic, single dose of 400 mg tafamidis 
meglumine was administered to healthy volunteers in study B3461031.

NT-proBNP: this a cardiac biomarker has been used in study B3461028 firstly to select patient 
population, then to try to analyse efficacy results and find a difference between the 2 tested doses (see 
effccacy part).  
Genetic differences in PD response  
Tafamidis stabilized both the wild-type TTR tetramer and the tetramers of 39 TTR variants tested 
either clinically or ex vivo.   
In Study B3461028 there were 2 genotypes (Pro24Ser and Val20Ile) for whom stabilization was not 
calculable at any time point during the 30-month study. Relationship between plasma concentration 
and effect (new modelling approach for the ATTR-CM application)  
An exposure-response analysis was completed evaluating the % TTR stabilization relative to 
tafamidis:TTR (TTRR) stoichiometry using all available data. The model was developed using a 
nonlinear mixed effect modelling approach using the NONMEM software, Version 7.4.1. Factors 
investigated for their potential impact on model parameters were race (non-Japanese vs. Japanese), 
patient type (healthy volunteer, ATTR-PN, ATTR-CM), and genotype. For the genotype, the absence or 
presence (0/1) of effect corresponds to Non-Val30Met vs Val30Met for patients with ATTR-PN, and wild 
type vs variant for patients with ATTR-CM.   
A total of 3662 stabilization observations from 102 healthy volunteers, 152 patients with ATTR-PN (20 
Non-Val30Met), and 406 patients with ATTR-CM (340 wild type) were included in the analyses. The 
relationship between % TTR stabilization and TTRR stoichiometry was adequately described by a 
sigmoid Emax model. The median stoichiometric molar ratio required to provide a half maximal response 
(EC50) in patients with ATTR-CM was 0.897 (95% CI: 0.741, 1.21) with a maximum response (Emax) of 
236% (95% CI: 218, 265). A linear time-dependent reduction in maximum stabilization was noted on 
Emax with an average decline of 12.8% per year.   
Based on Monte Carlo simulations from the final model, the predicted mean (95% CI) % TTR 
stabilization in patients with ATTR-CM at 6 months is approximately 147.5% (140.4%, 154.8%) and 
approximately 205.2% (194.3%, 216.7%) following treatment with tafamidis meglumine 20 mg and 
80 mg, respectively. This indicates a greater stabilization with tafamidis meglumine 80 mg compared 
to 20 mg.  Conclusions from this analysis include:  
•  Relationship between % TTR stabilization and molar ratio of tafamidis:TTR obtained in 11 studies 
were adequately described by a sigmoid Emax model. 
•  Subject status (healthy volunteers, patients with ATTR-PN and patients with ATTR-CM) were 
important predictors for both Emax and EC50. Healthy volunteers demonstrated the largest 
maximum stabilization (354%), followed by patients with ATTR-PN (279%) and patients with 
ATTR-CM (236%).  A common EC50 (molar ratio of tafamidis to TTR concentration) was estimated 
for patients with ATTR-CM and ATTR-PN (0.897).  The EC50 in healthy volunteers was higher 
(2.23). 
• 
The model indicated that Emax decreased over time. However, the mean decay rate was slow 
(12.8% per year). 
•  Mean % TTR stabilization is greater in the tafamidis meglumine 80 mg treatment group (205%) 
compared to the 20 mg group (148%). 
An ascending dose study (single oral doses of tafamidis meglumine 240 mg, 350 mg, and 480 mg in 
healthy subjects) suggested that TTR % stabilization continued to increase beyond the 20mg dose 
(B3461040).

EMA/3391/2020  
Page 32/95 
 
 
 
In the context of the results from the clinical pharmacology Study B3461040 and mean TTR 
concentrations observed at baseline in patient studies, the 80 mg dose was added to the pivotal phase 
3 study in ATTR-CM.  
It was assumed for the calculations that: a 20 mg QD tafamidis dose at steady state produces a mean 
MR in the range of 1.2 to 3.2 from mean minimum concentration at steady state (Cmin,ss) to 
maximum concentration at steady state (Cmax,ss), which is below the plateau region and that Mean 
Cmin,ss to Cmax,ss following tafamidis doses of 80 mg were expected to produce tafamidis:TTR molar 
ratios of 3.5 to 9.6, which are approaching or on the plateau region of TTR % stabilization.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
New dose selection 
A new dose of 80mg was selected based on pharmacodynamic studies assessing the relationship 
between % TTR stabilization and molar ratio (MR) of tafamidis:TTR and clinical studies providing mean 
TTR concentrations observed in ATTR-CM patients.  
Based on the new data, it was assumed for the calculations that: a 20 mg QD tafamidis dose at steady 
state produces a mean MR in the range of 1.2 to 3.2 from mean minimum concentration at steady 
state (Cmin,ss) to maximum concentration at steady state (Cmax,ss), which is below the plateau 
region and that Mean Cmin,ss to Cmax,ss following tafamidis doses of 80 mg were expected to 
produce tafamidis:TTR molar ratios of 3.5 to 9.6, which are approaching or on the plateau region of 
TTR % stabilization.  
Bioequivalence between 80mg tafamidis meglumine and 61mg free acid tafamidis formulations  
Study B3461054 – bioequivalence study, single dose:  
This bioequivalence study is considered as most relevant and discriminant, since it has been conducted 
on single dose, according to the guideline for evaluation of bioequivalence.  
However, in this study, demonstration of bioequivalence has not been established.   
In fasted state, there was underexposition with 61mg Tafamidis free acid (0.80 fold for Cmax) compared 
to 80 mg Tafamidis meglumine.  
In fed state there was overexposition with 61mg Tafamidis free acid (1.21 and 1.23 fold for AUClast 
and Cmax) compared to 80 mg Tafamidis meglumine. 
Assessing food effect in Study B3461054 for both treatments,  
- for the 61 mg Tafamidis free acid, there was overexposition in fed state (1.32 fold for Cmax),  
- for the 80 mg Tafamidis meglumine there was underexposition in fed state (0.85 fold for Cmax)  
- AUCs were never impacted by food effect. 
Study B3461056 - assessing BE at steady state: 
Initially this study was intended mostly to confirm modelings performed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 33/95 
 
 
 
As single dose comparison (study B3461054) did not meet BE criteria, this multiple dose study was 
presented by the Applicant to demonstrate BE under steady-state conditions.     
At steady state, under fasted condition, bioequivalence could be proven between 61 mg Tafamidis free 
acid and 80 mg Tafamidis meglumine. 
Of note, scientific advice given to the applicant included points relevant for bioequivalence. In 
particular, regarding how to consider the study of BE at steady state, it was stated that if the BE at 
single dose failed, “Such an outcome may not necessarily preclude product approval”. However, this 
will be a matter of thorough assessment of all data (including all other comparative pharmacokinetic 
results) as they are finally considered as a whole.” It was also stated that if BE could not be proven, it 
should be analyzed whether potential differences at steady state in AUC, Cmax and Cmin between the 
61 mgA and the 80 mg tafamidis meglumine dose, could be relevant for TTR% stabilisation.  
The applicant justified why steady state conditions are the most relevant here. They acknowledged 
that bioequivalence has not been proven, but in the context, changes in exposure, and higher Cmax in 
particular, are not expected to be relevant. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Selection of a new high dose of 80mg tafamidis meglumine to conduct the phase 3 study:  
The dose of 80mg has been selected based on PK/PD assessment with the objective to reach the 
maximal TTR % stabilization with adequate safety margin. The final assessment of the results of the 
phase 3 study, based on efficacy, safety and tolerability data, permitted to conclude on the dose 
recommended in the SmPC. 
New 61mg tafamidis free acid formulation to replace the assessed 4x20mg tafamidis meglumine 
posology: 
As already raised, the bioequivalence could not be formally demonstrated, considering that the 
multiple dose study is not in line with the Guideline requirements and BE has not been proven after 
single dose (Cmax values being outside the range 80-125%).  
Consequently, it is essential to keep in mind that, on one hand, the formal bioequivalence between 
both dosages (80mg vs. 61 mg) has not been provided. On the other hand, no clinical efficacy/safety 
data is available with the 61mg formulation in the sense that the 61mg formulation has not been 
administered in the randomised blinded clinical pivotal trial. The only expected clinical data for the 
61mg formulation will be safety data from the open extension study or observational data.  
Thus, the CHMP requested that applicant discuss the clinical relevance of the difference in Cmax, 
considering that the upper bound of Cmax Confidence Interval at fed state was higher than 125%, and 
consequently the exposure of the 61mg dose is potentially higher than the expected 80mg exposure. 
The applicant justified why steady state conditions are the most relevant here. They acknowledged 
that bioequivalence has not been proven, but in the context, changes in exposure, and higher Cmax in 
particular, are not expected to be relevant.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose response study was conducted with tafamidis in ATTR-CM patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 34/95 
 
 
 
The 20mg dose has already been approved for the treatment of ATTR-PN patients and has also been 
used in the phase 2 study B3461025 conducted in 35 patients with ATTR-CM to evaluate the effects of 
tafamidis on TTR stabilisation in patients with ATTR-CM due to either variant or wild-type TTR and 
whether TTR stabilisation can modify cardiac outcomes. 
The selection of an additional dose of 80mg for the main study B3461028 was based on PK/PD 
simulations in order to reach the plateau for maximum TTR stabilisation. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
Study B3461028 
Methods 
Study B3461028 was a Phase 3, multicentre, international, 3-arm, parallel design, placebo-controlled, 
randomised study with a 30 month double-blind treatment phase, to determine the efficacy, safety, 
and tolerability of tafamidis in ATTR-CM patients with either variant or wild-type TTR.

a 6-minute walk test of >100 m; so patients with advanced stage disease (NYHA functional 
class IV), unlikely to benefit, were not enrolled. Patients with variant TTR-CM, potentially more 
likely to have a mixed neurologic/cardiac phenotype, may also be more likely to experience 
difficulties completing this test, 
a plasma NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) concentration ≥600 pg/mL; to 
ensure patients included in the study have a cardiac cause for their symptoms and to ensure a 
sufficient event rate within the 30-month duration of the study. 
Major exclusion criteria include a confirmed diagnosis of light-chain amyloidosis, previous treatment 
with tafamidis, an estimated glomerular filtration rate of <25 mL/min/1.73 m2, and concurrent 
treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tauroursodeoxycholate and doxycycline, 
diflunisal, calcium channel blockers, or digitalis. Additional exclusion criteria include modified body 
mass index of <600 kg/m2·g/L and heart failure not because of TTR-CM. 
Treatments 
This study administered tafamidis at 20 mg and 80 mg doses (1× 20 mg capsule of tafamidis 
meglumine plus 3 × placebo capsules or 4 × 20 mg capsules of tafamidis meglumine) compared with a 
matched placebo (4 × placebo capsules).  
Patients were treated for up to 30 months. Vital status at month 30 was obtained for all patients, 
including those who discontinued from the study, resulting in mortality data for all patients. Upon 
completion of the study at the Month 30 visit, patients were eligible for treatment with tafamidis in a 
separate extension study (B3461045).   
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of an oral dose of 20 mg or 80 mg 
tafamidis meglumine soft gel capsules based on all-cause mortality and on frequency of 
cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, as well as to assess safety and tolerability in comparison to 
placebo.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary analysis used in this study was the method of Finkelstein-Schoenfeld applied to the 
hierarchical combination of all-cause mortality and frequency of CV-related hospitalisations (defined as 
the number of times a patient is hospitalised [ie, admitted to a hospital] for CV-related morbidity) 
during the trial, comparing the pooled tafamidis patient group (20 mg and 80 mg dose groups 
combined) to placebo.   
Key secondary endpoints were change from Baseline to Month 30 in the 6MWT and the KCCQ-OS score 
and were controlled for multiplicity.   
A 6MWT was conducted during the Screening period and at the Baseline visit and at Month 6, 12, 18, 
24, and 30 visits (or Early Study Discontinuation).  6MWT correlates with quality of life, NYHA class, 
peak exercise capacity, and hospitalisation and mortality rates in patients with CHF. 6MWT is 
considered an appropriate measurement of response to medical intervention in patients with moderate 
to severe CHF; 
Patients completed the KCCQ at the Baseline visit and at Months 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 (or Early Study 
Discontinuation). The KCCQ is a 23-item patient completed questionnaire that assessed health status 
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020

and health related quality of life in patients with heart failure. Items assess the ability to perform 
activities of daily living, frequency and severity of symptoms, the impact of these symptoms, and 
health related quality of life. Scoring yields scores for 8 domains (Physical limitation, Symptom 
stability, Symptom frequency, Symptom Burden, Total Symptom, Self-efficacy, Social limitation, and 
Quality of life) as well as a Clinical Summary score and an Overall Summary score. Domain scores are 
transformed to a 0 to 100 range; higher scores indicate better health status.     
The remaining secondary and exploratory analyses/endpoints were not adjusted for multiplicity.  
Secondary endpoints included CV-related mortality, frequency of CV-related hospitalisation, all-cause 
mortality, and TTR stabilisation at Month 1.   
Randomisation and blinding 
There were 441 patients enrolled into the study, randomised 2:1:2 to the 3 arms of the study in the 
following manner: n=177 in the placebo arm, n=88 in the tafamidis meglumine 20 mg arm, and 
n=176 in the tafamidis meglumine 80 mg arm. 
Patients were stratified by TTR genotype (variant and wild-type), Baseline NYHA classification (NYHA 
Class I and NYHA Classes II and III combined) and region (US and ex-US). Enrolment of wild-type 
patients was stopped to allow enrolment of more patients with variant type, with the goal of enrolment 
of at least 30% of each variant and wild-type.   
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis applied the method of Finkelstein-Schoenfeld to the hierarchical combination of 
all-cause mortality and frequency of CV-related hospitalisations during the study, combining the 
patients in the tafamidis 20 mg and tafamidis 80 mg groups (including patients in 80 mg group that 
may have had a dose reduction to 40 mg) into 1 pooled group. This pooled group (tafamidis) was 
compared with the placebo group as the prespecified primary comparison of interest. To maintain the 
experiment-wise type 1 error rate at or below the specified level of 0.05, a pre-specified hierarchical 
order for testing the primary and key secondary endpoints was used. The multiplicity procedure was 
applied to the ITT analysis set only.     
The Finkelstein-Schoenfeld test, a generalisation of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, is based on the 
principle that each patient in the study is compared to every other patient within each stratum in a pair 
wise manner.  The method recognises the higher importance of all-cause mortality. The pair wise 
comparison proceeds in hierarchical fashion using all-cause mortality first, assigning a +1 to the 
“better” patient and a -1 to the “worse” patient.  If both patients are dead, then the patient with a 
longer survival time is assigned +1 and the one with the shorter survival time a -1. If 1 patient is alive 
and the other is not, the live patient receives a +1 and the deceased one a -1.  If both patients are 
alive, the comparison uses CV-related hospitalisation to assign scores.  The patient with the fewer 
CV- related hospitalisation (frequency) receives a +1 while the other receives -1.  A score, 
, 
represents the pair-wise comparison and indicates whether patient i has the more favourable outcome 
than patient j. The test statistic is based on the sum of these scores. The “cardiovascular-related 
hospitalisation” in all analyses, unless otherwise specified, combines hospitalisations adjudicated as 
CV-related with hospitalisations adjudicated as indeterminate.     
Patients who discontinued for transplantation (ie, heart transplantation and combined heart and liver 
transplantation) or for implantation of a cardiac mechanical assist device, were handled in the primary 
analysis and all analyses involving survival (except select sensitivity analyses) in the same manner as 
death.

Exploratory sensitivity analyses with multiple imputation were also performed to account for missing 
hospitalisation data. Dropouts were the only source of missing hospitalisation data. A total of 258 
patients completed the study.

Outcomes and estimation 
According to the primary analysis performed with the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld method, treatment with 
tafamidis was superior to placebo over 30 months (p<0.001). Finkelstein-Schoenfeld analysis of all-
cause mortality and frequency of CV-related hospitalisations for the pooled active treatment is 
provided in Table 3 below.

Note: Heart transplants and cardiac mechanical assist device implantation were treated as death.  
 [1] CV-related hospitalisations per year is calculated as (Patients’ number of CV-related hospitalisations) / (duration on study in years).  
[2] The Finkelstein-Schoenfeld test is a hierarchical comparison of mortality and cardiovascular-hospitalisation. Within each stratum, each patient 
in the clinical study is compared with every other patient within each stratum in a pairwise manner. 
The primary analysis tests if the hierarchical combination of all-cause mortality and frequency of CV-related hospitalisations is different between 
the tafamidis and placebo treatment groups. 
Only CV-related hospitalisations where the patient is admitted to a hospital during the trial are included in this analysis; any hospitalisations 
prior to randomisation date are not included. 
0.0006 
The win ratio method (number of pairs of the treated patient wins divided by number of pairs of 
placebo patient wins) may be helpful in interpreting the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld result.  In a post hoc 
analysis, the win ratio for the primary analysis is 1.695 (95% CI 1.255, 2.289), indicating that a 
tafamidis-treated patient had a 69.5% higher chance of having a better outcome based on a 
hierarchical combination of all-cause mortality and CV-related hospitalisation relative to a placebo 
patient. 
A Kaplan-Meier plot of all-cause mortality with heart transplants and cardiac mechanical assist devices 
handled in the same manner as death is presented in Figure 5. Overall, all-cause mortality for the 
pooled tafamidis and placebo groups was 78 patients (29.5%) and 76 patients (42.9%), respectively.  
There were 186 patients (70.5%) and 101 patients (57.1%) in the pooled tafamidis and placebo 
groups, respectively, censored because they were alive at the time of analysis. The hazard ratio from 
the all-cause mortality Cox-proportional hazard model for pooled tafamidis was 0.698 (95% CI 0.508, 
0.958), indicating a 30.2% reduction in the risk of death relative to the placebo group (p=0.0259).

Note: o Indicates censored observations 
Regarding the frequency of CV-related hospitalisations for the pooled active treatment, there were 
138 (52.3%) and 107 (60.5%) patients with at least 1 CV-related hospitalisation in the pooled 
tafamidis and placebo groups, respectively. The frequency of CV-related hospitalisation per year was 
0.4750 (95% CI 0.4181, 0.5396) and 0.7025 (95% CI 0.6174, 0.7993) for the pooled tafamidis and 
placebo groups, respectively. The treatment difference (hereafter referred to as relative risk ratio) 
between the pooled tafamidis and placebo groups was 0.6761, indicating a significant reduction in the 
risk of CV-related hospitalisation in the tafamidis group relative to placebo (p <0.0001).     
6MWT - Change from Baseline to Month 30 in Distance Walked 
There was a statistically significant and clinically meaningful difference favouring the tafamidis-treated 
group versus the placebo group in the change from Baseline to Month 30 in the distance walked during 
the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT).   
At Baseline, mean (standard deviation [SD]) 6MWT distance in metres were similar for the pooled 
tafamidis (350.55 [121.296]) and placebo groups (353.26 [125.983]). At Month 30, the LS mean 
(standard error [SE]) change from Baseline for the pooled tafamidis and placebo groups was -54.87 
(5.068) metres and -130.55 (9.798) metres, respectively. The pooled tafamidis least squares (LS) 
mean (standard error [SE]) change from baseline difference from placebo was 75.68 (9.236) metres 
(p<0.0001). A statistically significant treatment effect favouring tafamidis was first observed at 
Month 6 (p=0.0067) and remained significant through Month 30 (Figure 6).

KCCQ-OS - Change from Baseline to Month 30 in KCCQ-OS Score 
There was a statistically significant and clinically meaningful difference in quality of life favouring the 
tafamidis-treated group versus the placebo group as measured by the change from Baseline to Month 
30 on the KCCQ-OS score.  
At Baseline, mean (SD) KCCQ-OS scores were similar for the pooled tafamidis (67.274 [21.3561]) and 
placebo groups (65.898 [21.7357]). At Month 30, the LS mean (SE) change from Baseline for the 
pooled tafamidis and placebo groups was -7.16 (1.415) and -20.81 (1.971), respectively. The pooled 
tafamidis LS mean (SE) difference from placebo was 13.65 (2.130) points (p<0.0001). A significant 
treatment effect favouring tafamidis was first observed at Month 6 (p=0.0113) and remained 
consistent through Month 30 (Figure 7).

CV-related Mortality – Secondary Endpoint 
Tafamidis-treated patients had a significantly reduced CV-related mortality relative to placebo-treated 
patients. The hazard ratio from the CV-related mortality Cox-proportional hazard model was 0.691 
(95% CI 0.488, 0.980), indicating a 30.9% reduction in the risk of death in the pooled tafamidis group 
relative to the placebo group (p=0.0383). Heart transplantation and combined heart and other organ 
transplantation, or the implantation of a cardiac mechanical assist device, were handled in the same 
manner as death.

0.663 (95% CI 0.461, 0.954), indicating a 33.7% reduction in the risk of death in the pooled tafamidis 
group relative to the placebo group (p=0.0267). 
TTR Stabilisation at Month 1 – Secondary Endpoint 
At Month 1 (pre-dose sample), significantly more patients in the pooled tafamidis group (211 patients, 
86.1%) demonstrated TTR stabilisation than was observed for patients in the placebo group (6 
patients, 3.5%), (p<0.0001). Similar results were obtained from the sample collected which targeted 
the time of maximum concentration (Month 1, 4 hours 30 minutes).  
In study B3461028, there were 2 genotypes (Pro24Ser and Val20Ile) in 3 patients for whom 
stabilisation was not calculable at any post-baseline time point. All 3 patients were NYHA Class II at 
Baseline and randomised to the tafamidis meglumine 80 mg arm.

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup Analyses  
Study B3461028 was not powered to evaluate response by subgroups such as tafamidis dose, TTR 
genotype, or Baseline NYHA classification. However, pre-specified exploratory analyses were conducted 
to understand the effect of the 2 doses administered, as well to explore efficacy within the subgroups.   
Subgroup  Analyses  of  the  primary  analysis  endpoint,  its  individual  components  (all-cause 
mortality  and  frequency  of  CV-related  hospitalisation)  and  secondary  endpoint  CV-related 
mortality 
A forest plot of treatment effects by dose, TTR genotype, and Baseline NYHA classification (Figure 9) 
illustrates the treatment effect favouring tafamidis over placebo for all-cause mortality in all 
subgroups, and for CV-related hospitalisations in all subgroups except NYHA Class III. 
Key findings included:  
•  A significant treatment effect favouring both the 20 mg and 80 mg tafamidis doses compared 
with placebo (p=0.0048 and 0.0030, respectively). The clinical efficacy of tafamidis in the 
overall ATTR-CM population was comparable across the 20 and 80 mg dose groups.  
•  A significant treatment effect favouring tafamidis compared to placebo was observed in 
patients with the wild-type TTR genotype (n=335, p=0.0009). The treatment effect observed 
between pooled tafamidis and placebo patients with the variant TTR genotype was directionally 
consistent with the data in wild-type patients (n=106, p=0.3001). 
A significant treatment effect favouring tafamidis was found for patients with NYHA Class I and 
II combined baseline classification (p=0.0005).  However, a significant treatment effect for 
tafamidis was not observed for patients with baseline NYHA Class III classification (p=0.7819). 
Though the treatment effect was not statistically significant, the mortality benefit was 
directionally consistent and favourable with tafamidis (Figure 9). However, the significantly 
higher hospitalisation rate observed in the tafamidis-treated NYHA III subgroup compared to 
placebo may be attributable to longer survival with an advanced phenotype which may be 
associated with more frequent hospitalisations.

Treatment effects favouring tafamidis over placebo in CV-related mortality were also observed across 
both tafamidis doses, in patients with both variant and wild-type TTR genotype, and for NYHA Class I 
and Class II patients.    
Subgroup analyses for the key secondary endpoints (6MWT distance and KCCQ-OS score at 
Month 30) 
6 MWT distance - This benefit is further reflected in the subgroup analyses where results by tafamidis 
dose, genotype, and baseline NYHA classification demonstrated a significant treatment effect favouring 
tafamidis vs placebo in the change from Baseline to Month 30 in the distance walked during the 6MWT.  
A significant treatment effect favouring both the tafamidis 20 mg and tafamidis 80 mg doses versus 
placebo was first observed at Month 6 (p=0.0339 and p=0.0240, respectively) and remained 
consistent through Month 30. The treatment effect was comparable between the doses of 20 mg and 
80 mg. Significant treatment effects favouring tafamidis were first observed at Month 24 (p=0.0172) 
for patients with variant TTR and at Month 6 (p=0.0170) for patients with wild-type TTR. Both 
treatment effects remained consistent through Month 30. Significant treatment effects favouring 
tafamidis were first observed at Month 6 (p=0.0013) for NYHA Class I and II combined, which 
remained significant through Month 30. A significant treatment effect was observed only at Month 24 
(p=0.0096) for patients with NYHA Class III baseline classification.  
KCCQ-OS - Analysis by subgroups (tafamidis dose, TTR genotype, and baseline NYHA classification) 
demonstrated treatment effects favouring tafamidis over placebo across subgroups. A significant 
treatment effect favouring the 80 mg tafamidis dose was first observed at Month 6 (p=0.0273), and 
for the tafamidis 20 mg dose a significant treatment effect favouring tafamidis was first observed at 
Month 12 (p=0.0005). Both remained significant through Month 30. The treatment effect was 
comparable between the doses of 20 mg and 80 mg. Significant treatment effects favouring tafamidis 
were first observed at Month 12 (p=0.0034) for patients with variant TTR and at Month 6 (p=0.0412) 
for patients with wild-type TTR. A significant treatment effect favouring tafamidis in NYHA Class I and 
II combined baseline classification was first observed at Month 6 (p=0.0100) and remained significant 
through Month 30. Significant treatment effects were observed for patients with NYHA Class III 
baseline classification at Months 18 and 30 (p=0.0264 and p=0.0090, respectively).  
TTR Stabilisation – Exploratory Endpoint 
At Month 1, a significantly greater proportion of subjects in the tafamidis 20 mg group (67/81 [82.7%] 
subjects) and tafamidis 80 mg group (144/164 [87.8%] subjects) demonstrated TTR stabilization than 
was observed for subjects in the placebo group (6/170 [3.5%] subjects) (p <0.0001). Similar results 
were obtained from the sample collected which targeted the time of maximum concentration (Month 1 
- 4 hours 30 minutes). 
At Month 1, a significantly greater proportion of subjects in the tafamidis group with variant (33/56 
[58.9%] subjects) or wild-type (178/189 [94.2%] subjects) demonstrated TTR stabilization than was 
observed for subjects in the placebo group (0/39 [0%] and 6/131 [4.6%] subjects, respectively) (p 
<0.0001). 
NT-proBNP and Troponin I – Exploratory Endpoints 
Change from Baseline in NT-proBNP concentration in the pooled tafamidis group was an exploratory 
endpoint in Study B3461028. NT-proBNP has prognostic value for ATTR-CM patients with heart failure 
or left ventricular dysfunction and was shown to be a significant predictor for mortality in an 
exposure-efficacy longitudinal analysis.  
The LS mean (SE) Month 30 change from Baseline difference in NT-proBNP concentration from the 
placebo group was -2180.54 (583.218) (p=0.0002) for the pooled tafamidis group. Post-hoc analyses 
of change from Baseline in NT-proBNP concentration by dose at Month 12 and Month 30 were also 
conducted.

Clinical studies in special populations 
N/A 
Supportive studies 
Supportive study B3461025 (Fx1B-201)   
Study B3461025 was an open-label, multicentre, single-treatment, 12-month Phase 2 study to 
evaluate the effects of tafamidis on TTR stabilisation in patients with ATTR-CM due to either variant or 
wild-type TTR and whether TTR stabilisation can modify cardiac outcomes. Potential treatment effects 
across a number of clinical outcomes were also assessed.  Although there was no comparator group, 
data from 29 patients with ATTR-CM (11 patients with Val122Ile, 18 patients with wild-type) in Study 
B3461024 (TRACS), was used as a historical control group.  In Study B3461025, 35 enrolled patients 
were treated with tafamidis 20 mg soft gelatin capsules once daily for 6 weeks, and those who 
completed 6 weeks continued for up to a total of 12 months. The enrolled patients were elderly, with 
significant disease duration at the time of enrollment, and significant co-morbidities.     
Tafamidis was effective in achieving and maintaining TTR stabilisation in both wild type and Val122Ile 
patients. TTR stabilisation, as assessed by the immunoturbidimetric assay, was achieved in 97.1% of 
patients at Week 6.  At Months 6 and 12, TTR stabilisation was 88.2% and 87.5%, respectively. 
Following 12 months treatment with tafamidis, along with routine standard of care, 2/35 patients 
(5.7%) died, 9/35 patients (25.7%) experienced at least 1 CV hospitalisation, and 9/35 patients 
(25.7%) experienced the composite endpoint of death or CV hospitalisation. Results were similar 
between the TTR genotype groups.  These data were numerically better than that reported in the 
TRACS historical control cohort, during which the 12-month rate of death, CV hospitalisations and 
death/CV hospitalisations combined were 6/29 (20.7%), 10/29 (34.5%) and 13/29 (44.8%), 
respectively. 
At baseline, the extensive cardiac involvement in all patients was clearly demonstrated by multiple 
assessments, including echocardiography, cardiac MRI, chest X-ray, cardiac biomarkers, ECG/Holter 
monitoring, the health-related quality of life questionnaires, and the 6MWT. In general, changes 
observed across the assessments were minimal, and did not represent clinically relevant changes over 
the 12-month treatment period.  Of note, there was a decrease in percent of left ventricular mass with 
amyloid (by cardiac MRI) and some beneficial effect in cardiac autonomic function (improved heart rate 
variability). When compared to changes in the TRACS study, a relatively smaller increase in NT-proBNP 
and a slower progression of disease, as assessed by the distance walked in 6MWT, PGA, and SF-36, 
was observed at 12 months. Changes in echocardiography parameters and KCCQ at 12 months were 
not clinically relevant. 
In summary, outcomes in those patients treated with tafamidis for 12 months appeared somewhat 
improved compared to patients observed over 12 months without intervention in TRACS. These trends 
included overall better survival, less CV hospitalisations, stabilisation of cardiac function (as assessed 
by cardiac biomarkers), results from echocardiographic and cardiac MRI testing, and better functional 
status. 
Patients who successfully completed Study B3461025 could continue into extension Study B3461026, 
which is an ongoing open label study designed to obtain additional, long-term safety data for tafamidis 
in patients with ATTR-CM, and to continue to provide patients with 20 mg oral tafamidis soft gelatin

capsule. This extension study is provided in the submission to support the safety profile of tafamidis as 
part of the All Tafamidis Cohort. 
Supportive study B3461045  
The objective of this ongoing extension study is long-term safety of tafamidis 20mg and 80mg. See the 
safety part of this AR.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The applicant’s claimed indication for tafamidis is supported by single pivotal trial.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study B3461028 in ATTR-CM patients  
This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomised, double-blind, 3-arm, placebo-controlled study in 441 ATTR-
CM patients (548 screened, 441 randomised) with a 30-month duration of double-blind treatment.  
Subjects were randomised to receive tafamidis 80mg once daily, tafamidis 20mg once daily or placebo 
with a ratio 2:1:2, in the following manner: n=177 in the placebo arm, n=88 in the tafamidis 
meglumine 20 mg arm, and n=176 in the tafamidis meglumine 80 mg arm. In this study, tafamidis 
treatment administered was actually tafamidis “meglumine” (the salt form), which is the already 
approved VYNDAQEL 20mg, soft capsules (i.e in the arm tafamidis 80mg, 4 capsules of VYNDAQEL 
20mg were absorbed once daily in a blinded fashion). However, for practical reasons related to 
observance, a new formulation was developed later to replace the 4 capsules of VYNDAQEL 20mg by a 
single claimed as bioequivalent capsule of micronized tafamidis 61mg (the free acid form). This new 61 
mg capsule is used in the extension study B3461045, and is proposed for current extension 
application. 
The recommended dose for the claimed cardiac indication is 61 mg once a day. The proposed new 
formulation (with active substance as an acid) has not been assessed in the pivotal clinical study of 30 
month duration, but only in short term PK/PD studies, including the bioequivalence study. However for 
the dose of 20mg, which was assessed in the 30 month pivotal clinical study, and which is already 
approved in ATTR-PN indication, the cardiac indication was not claimed by the Applicant.   
Regarding the target population, the study was designed to include both types of transthyretin amyloid 
cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM): variant and wild-type TTR genotype. Diagnosis and patients’ selection 
were based on the following criteria: 
-  ≥18 to ≤90 years of age,  
- 
a history of heart failure evidenced by at least one prior hospitalization for heart failure or 
clinical evidence of heart failure (without hospitalization) manifested in signs or symptoms of 
volume overload or elevated intracardiac pressures requiring treatment with a diuretics for 
improvement,  
- 
- 
a predominant cardiac phenotype; specifically, documented TTR-CM with either wild-type 
transthyretin or a variant transthyretin genotype (assessed by genotyping),  
evidence of cardiac involvement by echocardiography with an end-diastolic interventricular 
septal wall thickness >12 mm. Since many patients >70 year-old have septal wall 
thickness >12 mm, notably with increased blood pressure, this criteria of diagnosis is not 
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 52/95 
 
 
 
sufficient in clinical practice. Echocardiography criteria in accordance with the ESC guidelines is 
particularly important when restrictive cardiomyopathy or HF with preserved EF is suspected.  
- 
in all patients, the presence of transthyretin amyloid deposits in biopsy tissue obtained from 
cardiac and noncardiac sites (e.g., fat aspirate, gastrointestinal sites, salivary glands, or bone 
marrow; amyloid demonstrated per appropriate stain such as Congo red or alcian blue stain). 
Biopsy is currently rarely performed with a suspicion of ATTR-CM in clinical practice because it 
is an invasive act. However, a non biopsy approach is now recommended.     
- 
in patients without variant TTR genotype, the presence of TTR precursor protein confirmed by 
immunohistochemistry or mass spectrometry. Bone scintigraphy was not an inclusion criteria 
but it is now considered as the most recommended confirmatory test of TTR involvement.  
- 
a plasma NT-proBNP concentration ≥600 pg/mL to ensure patients included in the study have 
a cardiac cause for their symptoms. BNP should rather have been considered as inclusion 
criteria in non-acute HF because less sensitive to age and creatinine.  
- 
a 6-minute walk test of >100 m to exclude patients with advanced stage disease (NYHA 
functional class IV) and patients with a mixed neurologic/cardiac phenotype who may be more 
likely to experience difficulties completing this test.  
Other major exclusion criteria include a confirmed diagnosis of light-chain amyloidosis, heart failure 
not caused by TTR-CM, history of liver or heart transplantation; implanted cardiac device; eGFR <25 
mL/min/1.73m²; BMI <600kg/m²; previous treatment with tafamidis and concurrent treatment with 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tauroursodeoxycholate, doxycycline, diflunisal, calcium channel 
blockers or digitalis.    
The demographic characteristics were generally well balanced between groups. The majority of 
subjects were male (90%), white (80%), wild-type TTR genotype (76%), NYHA Class II (60%), from 
US (63%) and mean age was 74 years (range: 46 to 89). Other notable groups with fewer patients 
were non-US (37%), NYHA Class III (32%), variant TTR genotype (24%), black patients (14%). The 
goal of enrollment of at least 30% of variant TTR genotype patients was not achieved. Additionally, 
patients with NYHA I were less than 10%. This confirms difficulties to diagnosis NYHA I patients, in 
particular in the absence of symptoms of heart failure. Therefore, a special attention has been given to 
results in this patients group in order to identify the clinical relevance of the proposed indication. In 
addition, an accurate diagnosis cannot be formally established without a number of procedures 
(biopsy, scinthigraphy…).  
The discontinuations rate was high, with a total of 183 patients, and were higher in the placebo group 
compared to the tafamidis groups (+17.5%): 34.5% vs 52.0%. The most frequent reasons for 
discontinuation were for 17.5% of patients due to death, 14.1% of patients no longer willing to 
participate, 6.3% of patients due to adverse events. Regarding patients no longer willing to participate 
in the study, they were twice more in the placebo group compared to the tafamidis groups (+11.4%): 
9.5% vs 20.9%. 
The primary analysis used was the method of Finkelstein-Schoenfeld applied to the hierarchical 
combination of all-cause mortality and frequency of CV-related hospitalisations (defined as the number 
of times a patient is hospitalised [ie, admitted to a hospital] for CV-related morbidity) during the trial 
(duration of 30 months), comparing the pooled tafamidis patient group (20 mg and 80 mg dose groups 
combined) to placebo. The sample size calculation was based on an expected reduction of mortality 
between 30% and 50%, with a mortality rate in the placebo group of 25%.   
Key secondary endpoints were change from Baseline to Month 30 in the 6MWT and the KCCQ-OS score 
and were controlled for multiplicity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 53/95 
 
 
 
The remaining secondary and exploratory analyses/endpoints were not adjusted for multiplicity, 
including CV-related mortality, frequency of CV-related hospitalisation, all-cause mortality, TTR 
stabilisation at Month 1, change in NT-proBNP concentration. Thus, these endpoints are exploratory 
and should be interpreted with caution.   
The design aspects of the study such as the 2:1:2 randomisation, inclusion of broad baseline disease 
severity, pooled primary analysis, the use of Finkelstein-Schoenfeld methodology, were discussed 
within the framework of a scientific advice from the EMA in 2012. The SA given by EMA to the applicant 
considered that the proposed strategy regarding clinical endpoints was acceptable.  
A request for routine GCP inspection has been adopted for this single pivotal study. The Applicant was 
requested to provide clarifications on the impact of the findings regarding the eligibility of up to 10% of 
the patients with regards to an echocardiographic inclusion criterion, regarding the adjudication of 
hospitalisations and regarding biological samples, on the study results. The Applicant justified that 
these findings had no impact on study results.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
According to the primary analysis performed with the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld method, treatment with 
tafamidis was superior to placebo over 30 months (p<0.001). 
All-cause mortality at month 30 was reduced by 30.2% in the tafamidis groups compared to placebo: 
29.5% with pooled tafamidis vs 42.9% with placebo, statistically significant (p=0.0259). These results 
are consistent with the expected reduction of mortality between 30% and 50% hypothesized by the 
Applicant. However, from a clinical point of view, and based on all-cause mortality criteria, the 
statistically significant differences between groups is observed only after 16 months of treatment.  
The frequency of CV-related hospitalizations per year (% of subjects with at least one CV 
hospitalization) for the ITT analysis set was reduced by 32.3% with pooled tafamidis compared to 
placebo: 52.3% with tafamidis vs 60.5% with placebo, statistically significant (p<0.0001).  
In a post hoc analysis, the win ratio (number of pairs of the treated patient wins divided by number of 
pairs of placebo patient wins) for the primary analysis is 1.695 (95% CI 1.255, 2.289), indicating that 
a tafamidis-treated patient had a 69.5% higher chance of having a better outcome based on a 
hierarchical combination of all-cause mortality and CV-related hospitalisation relative to a placebo 
patient. 
Regarding key secondary endpoints, tafamidis reduced, at month 30, the decline in the distance 
walked during the 6-minute test as compared with placebo (75.68 m [SE, ±9.24; p<0.001]) and in the 
KCCQ-OS score as compared with placebo (13.65 [SE, ±2.13; p<0.001]). 
The same trend as the primary endpoint was observed for CV-related mortality with a reduction by 
30.9% in the tafamidis groups compared to placebo: 20.1% with pooled tafamidis vs 28.2% with 
placebo, (p=0.0383), and a difference between groups observed after 16 months of treatment. 
Regarding the secondary endpoint TTR stabilisation at Month 1, significantly more patients in the 
pooled tafamidis group (86.1%) demonstrated TTR stabilisation than was observed for patients in the 
placebo group (3.5%), (p<0.0001).    
The post hoc exploratory endpoint (reduction of NT-proBNP at Month 30) was presented by the 
Applicant to confirm the favourable effect of tafamidis over placebo (p=0.0002).  
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 54/95 
 
 
 
Regarding the comparison of the 2 dose groups, both doses of tafamidis were superior to placebo over 
30 months on the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld primary analysis of all-cause mortality and frequency of CV-
related hospitalisations: p=0.0048 with the 20mg and p=0.0030 with the 80mg group.  
Furthermore, there was a trend to lower events in the 20mg dose group compared to the 80mg dose 
group on all the clinical endpoints: all-cause deaths (27.3% with the 20mg vs 30.7% with the 80mg), 
CV-related hospitalization (47.7% with the 20mg vs 54.5% with the 80mg) and also CV-related deaths 
(21.6% with the 20mg vs 25.6% with the 80mg). This is confirmed when focusing on the win-ratio of 
both doses, respectively 1.81 and 1.64 for the 20 mg and 80 mg. Based on these results, it cannot be 
concluded that the 80mg dose may have more benefit than the 20mg dose.   
On the key secondary endpoints, tafamidis 20mg and 80mg were also comparable: significant 
treatment effects at month 30 on both doses over placebo on the decline in the distance walked during 
the 6-minute test and the KCCQ-OS score.  
Across prespecified subgroups, on TTR genotype and NYHA Class, the difference in all-cause mortality 
and frequency of CV-related hospitalisations favoured tafamidis over placebo, except in patients with 
NYHA class III disease at baseline, among whom the rates of CV-related hospitalisations were higher 
among patients receiving tafamidis than among those receiving placebo (76.9% vs 58.7%). Also, CV-
related mortality (51.3% vs 49.2%) tended to be higher with tafamidis compared to placebo in 
patients with NYHA class III.   
Further analyses according to the doses and time course are necessary to better characterise the effect 
of tafamidis, notably in more severe patients who may not benefit from this treatment. Regarding the 
issue of tafamidis efficacy between older and younger patients, consistent results are observed for 
both the 20 mg and 80 mg doses in all patients, above and below the median age of 75 years.  
Results on TTR stabilisation between 20mg and 80mg are comparable: 82.7% and 87.8%, with no 
significant difference between groups. No benefit of the 80mg over the 20mg dose can be claimed 
based on these analyses. This is consistent with the primary efficacy results.  
Less TTR stabilization in variant patients than in wild patients is observed: 58.9% and 94.2%.  
An exploratory analysis of the NT-proBNP concentrations was provided by the Applicant. From a 
methodological point of view, such post-hoc analysis, without predefined hypothesis and sample size 
calculation, cannot be endorsed. Furthermore, NT-proBNP has questionable clinical value in this study, 
since no validated values directly correlated to clinical improvement exist with the observed values in 
this study: LS mean of 1185 pg/ml with 20mg and 633 pg/ml with 80mg at month 12 and 2542.23 
pg/ml with 20mg and 1371.71 pg/ml with 80mg at month 30, making the distinction between 20mg 
and 80mg not really clear. For the same reasons, the results on troponin I could not be considered 
sufficiently relevant to distinguish both doses.  
The supportive studies B3461025 and B3461045 are consistent with the results of study B3461028, 
since no increase in mortality is observed with either the 20mg or 80mg doses. However, they do not 
allow any comparison between the efficacy of the 20mg and the 80mg doses, contrary to the Applicant 
claim that all-cause mortality is reduced on the 80mg dose relative to the 20mg in study B3461045.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, tafamidis has clearly demonstrated consistent efficacy across the primary, key secondary and 
other secondary endpoints for both tafamidis meglumine 20 mg and 80 mg doses. Regarding the 
comparison of the 2 dose groups, both doses of tafamidis were superior to placebo over 30 months on 
the primary analysis of all-cause mortality and frequency of CV-related hospitalisations: p=0.0048 with 
Assessment report

Page 55/95 
 
 
 
the 20mg and p=0.0030 with the 80mg group. The 61 mg is considered effective in the requested 
indication.  
Although the MAH did not apply for an approval of the ATTR CM indication for the 20mg dose, the MAH 
was, based on the similar effects shown for this lower dose, asked to justify the dose selection and 
possible appropriateness of use of the 20mg. However, this point has not been fully understood.  
The MAH has not provided fully convincing arguments to select 61 mg (80 mg equivalent) dose as 
compared to 20 mg regarding hard parameters of clinical efficacy. The selected approach regarding 
NT-proBNP and the other PK parameters related to TTR stabilization and fostered outcomes are not in 
line with what has been clinically observed in study B3461028. However, the 80 mg dose has the 
largest evidence base that is twice as large than for the 20 mg dose. Moreover, tafamidis was similarly 
well tolerated across both dose groups. 
Therefore, considering also that there are no clear biomarker target levels, signs, or symptoms to steer 
dosing and the therapy has shown morbi/mortality benefit it is agreed that the 61mg dose is an 
appropriate dose in this particular context of severe and evolutive disease. The benefit-risk balance of 
the 61 mg dose was considered positive for the following agreed indication: 
Vyndaqel is indicated for the treatment of wild-type or hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis in adult 
patients with cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). 
- Regarding the assessment tools for diagnosis:  
The severity of the disease can be distinguished between the variant and the wild-type forms. Indeed, 
when considering the mechanism of the disease, variant TTR is inherited by mutation in hereditary 
forms, while in wild-type forms, TTR is becoming unstable with age, without clear origin. Variant forms 
can be detected earlier, in a family context, even before the onset of cardiac symptoms, and can be 
associated with neurologic phenotype. Wild-type patients are around 75 year-old at diagnosis and are 
also associated with multiple non-cardiac symptoms such as deafness, carpa tunnel syndrome or 
lumbar canal stenosis, and may be common in the elderly population (>80-85 year-old). It seems that 
the evolution of the disease differs between these 2 types, with median survival of 25.6 months for 
variants and 43.0 months for wild-type.  
Consequently, since the medical need may not be the same, with a more severe and evolutive disease 
in the variant patients, the management of patients may differ. It is specified in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC that the etiologic diagnosis must be done by a physician knowledgeable in the management of 
amyloidosis or cardiomyopathy to confirm ATTR-CM and exclude AL amyloidosis before starting 
tafamidis, using appropriate assessment tools such as: bone scintigraphy and blood/urine assessment, 
and/or histological assessment by biopsy, and transthyretin (TTR) genotyping to characterise as 
wild-type or hereditary. 
The HealthCare Professional Guide (HCP Guide) was updated with key message on the clinical criteria 
for the diagnosis of ATTR-CM in the Healthcare Professional Guide. The THAOS Protocol is in the process 
of being amended. This will be submitted as a PASS protocol amendment early 2020.

Intrinsic Factors 
Population PK Analyses of Tafamidis in Healthy Volunteers, Patients with Hepatic Impairment, 
and Patients with Transthyretin Amyloidosis  
In order to examine the effect of certain intrinsic factors including age, gender, race, health status, and 
renal function on the PK of tafamidis, a population PK analysis was conducted (Module 5.3.3.5 Report 
PMAR-EQDD-B346a-Other-452). Results from this analysis showed that no dosage adjustment is 
necessary with tafamidis for intrinsic or extrinsic factors, including gender, race, age, nor for subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 68/95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with renal impairment or mild and moderate hepatic impairment.  No data are available in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment. The results from these studies support tafamidis once-daily oral 
dosing. 
Patients with ATTR-CM were older (mean of 74.7 years versus 34.8 or 44.5 years in healthy volunteers 
and patients with ATTR-PN, respectively) and had a lower baseline creatinine clearance (mean of 56.4 
mL/min versus 123.7 or 101.7 mL/min in healthy volunteers and patients with ATTR-PN, respectively) 
than healthy volunteers or patients with ATTR-PN. Patients with ATTR-PN also tended to have a smaller 
body weight than other populations (mean of 65.1 kg versus 76.1 or 80.1 kg in healthy volunteers and 
patients with ATTR-CM, respectively). The distribution of other continuous covariates was relatively 
similar among different populations. 
Based on the population PK analyses, subjects ≥65 years had an average 15% lower estimate of 
tafamidis clearance at steady state compared to subjects < 65 years.  This difference in clearance 
results in <20% increases in mean Cmax and AUC compared to younger subjects and is not clinically 
significant.  Therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary in subjects ≥65 years.  
In Study B3461028, patients with Baseline NYHA Class IV were excluded.  
Based on these analyses, the large nonclinical safety margins, and the tolerability profile as 
demonstrated in the clinical studies, no dose adjustment is recommended for any intrinsic or extrinsic 
factor. 
In ATTR-CM patients, the impact of age, race, gender, TTR genotype, baseline NYHA classification, and 
geographic region on incidence of TEAEs (all-causality and treatment-related), SAEs, AEs leading to 
discontinuation, and deaths was evaluated. The review of key safety data from the B3461028 Cohort 
revealed a potential subset, although small, of ATTR-CM patients who might have higher risk for 
certain events. Patients identified at baseline as NYHA Class III demonstrated higher rates of AEs, 
SAEs, and AEs and SAEs leading to discontinuations, and deaths than those patients identified at 
baseline as NYHA Class I/II. These elevations in exposure-adjusted incidence rates were apparent in 
the placebo and tafamidis treatment groups; however in each case, the incidence of the key safety 
event was numerically lower for tafamidis-treated patients than for placebo-treated patients. With 
regard to discontinuations from study, the reason for discontinuation with the largest increase in the 
NYHA Class III versus NYHA Class I/II was deaths, for placebo and tafamidis treatment groups. See 
Module 5.3.5.3 B3461028 Cohort Safety Table 2.2.6.a.  
Extrinsic Factors 
There was no assessment of the effects of extrinsic factors such as tobacco or alcohol use on the safety 
of tafamidis. As noted in Module 2.7.2.3.3.6, the effect of food on absorption was minimal and is not 
expected to impact the safety of tafamidis. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation  
Female patients who were pregnant or lactating were excluded from all clinical trials in the 
development program of tafamidis. There are no adequate data on the use of tafamidis in pregnant 
women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (Module 2.4.4.6). There was no evidence 
of adverse effects of tafamidis on fertility or reproductive performance in the rat (Module 2.4.4.6.1). In 
a developmental toxicity study in rabbits, a slight increase in skeletal malformations and variations, 
reduced embryo/foetal survival, and reduction in foetal weights were observed at or below the human 
equivalent dose (HED) (Module 2.4.4.6.3). Post-natal mortality and developmental anomalies were 
observed in rats at dose levels ≥14x, ≥3.4x and ≥2.8x the doses of 20 mg tafamidis meglumine, 80 
mg tafamidis meglumine, and 61 mg tafamidis, respectively. However, the potential risk for humans is 
unknown. Tafamidis should not be administered to pregnant women or women planning to become 
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 69/95 
 
 
 
 
 
pregnant. Contraceptive measures should be used by women of childbearing potential during 
treatment with tafamidis and, given the long half-life of tafamidis, for 1 month after stopping 
treatment. 
The effect of tafamidis on nursing infants after administration to the mother has not been studied.  
However, animal data demonstrate that tafamidis is secreted in the milk of lactating rats (Module 
2.4.3.6).  Therefore, lactating women should not receive treatment with tafamidis. No information is 
available on the presence of tafamidis in human breast milk. 
As of 15 June 2018, there were 22 cases of exposure in utero to tafamidis during or within 1 month 
prior to pregnancy in the overall tafamidis program (clinical and non-interventional studies). Of these 
22 cases, 12 were described as maternal exposure during pregnancy, 10 were exposure via father. The 
pregnancy outcomes of these 22 cases (includes 24 foetuses) were: 14 normal newborns (including 1 
low birth weight and 2 pre-term infant), 5 unknown outcomes, 2 spontaneous abortions, 1 medical 
termination (twins), and 1 voluntary abortion. In one case, intense vaginal haemorrhage occurred 
during 1st trimester in 31-year-old patient expecting twins. Upon discovery of pregnancy, tafamidis was 
stopped during 11th week of gestation; however, vaginal bleeding continued and patient underwent a 
medical termination of pregnancy as a consequence of intense vaginal bleeding. No further reports of 
tafamidis exposure during pregnancy have been received spontaneously within the post-marketing 
experience. 
The Tafamidis Enhanced Surveillance Pregnancy Outcomes (TESPO) program follows the progress and 
outcome of reported pregnancies in women exposed to tafamidis. The objective of TESPO is to 
evaluate outcomes of pregnancy (including major birth defects and/or developmental abnormalities in 
live born children) in patients with ATTR-PN with exposure to tafamidis during or within 1 month prior 
to pregnancy. This surveillance is undertaken to further monitor the important potential risk of 
reproductive toxicity for tafamidis arising from findings in animal developmental toxicity studies 
(Module 2.4.4.6; Module 2.4.4.6.4). Of the 14 normal newborns born to mothers directly and indirectly 
(through their partner) exposed to tafamidis, 7 had post-natal follow-up at 1 year. All 7 infants 
survived the first year of life and have met their age-appropriate development milestones. No infant 
had any congenital malformations.    
Overdose 
In clinical studies of ATTR-CM patients, the highest daily dose provided was tafamidis 80 mg, with the 
longest duration of exposure being 111 months. Two patients in Study B3461045 experienced an acute 
overdose during clinical trials. Both involved the accidental ingestion of a single tafamidis dose of 160 
mg without the occurrence of any associated adverse events (Module 5.3.5.3 All Tafamidis Cohort 
Listing 16.9.1). The highest dose of tafamidis given to healthy volunteers in a clinical trial was 480 mg 
in a single dose. There was one reported treatment-related adverse event of mild hordeolum at this 
dose. (Module 5.3.3.1 Study B3461040 Report Body). 
Dogs were administered tafamidis (in 0.5% methylcellulose) at single doses up to 600 mg/kg 
(333 mg/kg HED) via oral gavage without apparent adverse effects.  This dose level was approximately 
1904x, 476x, and 382x the clinical doses of 20 mg tafamidis meglumine, 80 mg tafamidis meglumine, 
and 61 mg tafamidis, respectively.  Thus, the risk for inadvertent or intentional overdose in humans is 
considered to be low. 
Drug Abuse 
There is no evidence that tafamidis has dependence potential. No drug abuse of this medication has 
been observed or is anticipated based on the pharmacology and receptor binding. 
Withdrawal and Rebound 
No effects of withdrawal and rebound of this medication have been observed. There were no adverse 
effects noted in patients who abruptly terminated treatment with tafamidis (e.g., patients who went to 
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 70/95 
 
 
 
liver transplant were required to discontinue treatment with tafamidis prior to transplant). This 
medication is intended for long-term use. 
Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental Ability 
No studies on the effects of tafamidis on the ability to drive or use machines have been performed; 
however, there have been no adverse reactions identified that would be expected to affect the ability 
of a patient to drive or operate machinery.

Tafamidis is not expected to significantly induce or inhibit cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzymes or 
inhibit uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes at clinically relevant 
concentrations.   
Tafamidis showed a low potential to inhibit MDR1 (P-gp) (systemically), organic cation 
transporter (OCT), OCT2, multidrug and toxin exclusion transporter (MATE), MATE1 and 
MATE2K, organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP), OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 at clinically 
relevant concentrations. 
Tafamidis meglumine inhibits the uptake transporters OAT1 and OAT3 (organic anion 
transporters) and may cause drug-drug interactions at clinically relevant concentrations with 
substrates of these transporters (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, bumetanide, 
furosemide, lamivudine, methotrexate, oseltamivir, tenofovir, ganciclovir, adefovir, cidofovir, 
zidovudine, zalcitabine) following 20 mg or 80 mg. 
Tafamidis has the potential to inhibit breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) (systemically and 
in the GI tract) and may increase exposure of substrates of this transporter (eg, methotrexate, 
rosuvastatin, imatinib) following 20 mg or 80 mg tafamidis meglumine administration.   
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuation from study treatment due to TEAEs 
Patients experiencing TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of treatment occurred more 
frequently in the placebo group (28.8%) than in the tafamidis 20 mg group (18.2%) and tafamidis 
80 mg group (22.7%) (Module 5.3.5.3 B3461028 Cohort Safety Table 4.1.1.a).   
For the B3461028 Cohort, the SOC most commonly associated with discontinuations from study 
treatment was cardiac disorders, with 25 (14.1%) in placebo, 10 (11.4%) in tafamidis 20 mg, 20 
(11.4%) in tafamidis 80 mg, and 30 (11.4%) in the pooled tafamidis group. The most frequently 
reported adverse events leading to discontinuation in any treatment group were cardiac failure, 
congestive cardiac failure, cardiac amyloidosis and disease progression. 
For the B3461028 Cohort, permanent discontinuation of study treatment due to SAEs occurred more 
frequently in the placebo group (28.2%) compared to any tafamidis group; 17%, 22.2%, and 20.5% in 
the tafamidis 20 mg, 80 mg and pooled tafamidis, respectively. The most common SOC for SAEs 
leading to study treatment discontinuations were cardiac disorders, with percentages in the placebo, 
tafamidis 20 mg, and tafamidis 80 mg treatment groups of 14.1%, 10.2%, and 11.4%, respectively. 
The most frequent SAEs associated with study treatment discontinuation were similar to those for 
TEAEs as noted above.

Interruptions and dose reduction due to adverse events 
For the B3461028 Cohort, requests for dose reductions due to adverse events were infrequent, and 
occurred more often in the placebo group (4 patients) than in the tafamidis group (2 patients, 
tafamidis 80 mg). Actual dose reductions to 40 mg daily due to adverse events occurred in 2 patients 
in the tafamidis 80 mg group (0.8% of tafamidis-treated patients overall) (Module 5.3.5.3 B3461028 
Cohort Safety Table 13.3.a) and were for AEs of moderate urinary tract pain and moderate headache, 
occurring 15 and 113 days after first dose of blinded study medication, respectively (S0115 Module 
5.3.5.3 Study B3461028 Report Body Table 14.3.1.1.3.1).The urinary tract pain resolved 4 days after 
dose reduction, and the patient continued treatment with tafamidis 40 mg into Study B3461045. The 
event of headache resolved 3 days after dose reduction, and 3 months later the patient withdrew from 
the study, per protocol guidelines, due to a heart and kidney transplant.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of tafamidis for the treatment of ATTR-CM has been evaluated from the completed 
pivotal Phase 3 Study B3461028. In addition, data from the ongoing long-term extension (LTE) Study 
B3461045, as well as the completed Phase 2 Study B3461025 and associated ongoing LTE, Study 
B3461026 are included.  Data provided for both ongoing LTEs utilized a cut-off date of 15 Feb 2018. 
Additional supportive data from ATTR-PN patients in clinical trials and from post-marketing experience 
in ATTR-PN patients (cut-off date 15 June 2018) are also included, as well as further supportive safety 
data from tafamidis-treated patients enrolled in Study B3461001 (Transthyretin-Associated 
Amyloidosis Outcomes Survey [THAOS]; cut-off date 15 February 2018). 
As general comment, the presentation of the scattered data in different modules made the analysis 
difficult. The provided supplied computer links did not allow to retrieve easily the complete information 
regarding the extension request.  
On the other hand, the MAH provided data associating results of studies from line extension in ATTR-
CM and those resulting from the indication in ATTR-PN. Supplemental data for phase I studies were not 
presented separately.  
Furthermore, regarding studies in ATTR-CM, the MAH mostly analysed safety data by comparing 
placebo to pooled Tafamidis 20mg and 80mg together and did not compare the two dosages 20mg and 
80mg between them. This does not allow to compare the safety profiles according to the dose. 
There were no differences in demographic characteristics between patients groups and study 
B3461028, Broad cohort and all tafamidis cohort. In study B3461028, regarding ethnicity data, the 
MAH divided the patients between “Hispanic or latino” and “not Hispanic or latino”. ATTR-CM, known as 
familial amyloid cardiomyopathy, is associated with genetic variants of TTR such as Val122Ile and 
Leu111Met. The variant TTR genotype (Val122Ile TTR) occurs in 3,3% to 4% of the US African-
American population and is exceedingly rare in White patients.  
Variant TTR genotype was well balanced between the two treatments arm tafamidis 20mg and 80mg: 
about 24% of patients in each group in the pivotal study B3461028, and 21% in the Broad study. 
However, in the Broad Study, “Hispanic or latino” patients were slightly higher in the tafamidis 20mg 
arm compared to the tafamidis 80mg arm (3,5% vs 1,8%). 
The company explained why “Hispanic or latino” ethnic group has been separated from the other patients. 
The classification categories of ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino OR not Hispanic or Latino) recommended in 
the  guidance  are  social-political  constructs  and  should  not  be  interpreted  as  being  scientific  or 
anthropological in nature. These ethnicity categorisation subgroups were not used for analysis purposes.   
Overall, results from the pivotal Phase 3 Study B3461028 demonstrate that oral tafamidis meglumine 
dosed at either 20 mg or 80 mg once daily was well tolerated with a safety profile comparable to 
placebo when used for the treatment of adult patients with ATTR-CM due to either variant or wild-type 
TTR. The majority of events were mild to moderate in severity. Severe related adverse events were 
slightly reported compared to mild or moderate related TEAEs in all treatment groups. 
A smaller proportion of patients discontinued due to adverse events in the tafamidis-treated groups 
compared to placebo.  Distribution of TEAEs (non-serious and serious) was generally similar among 
placebo and tafamidis-treated patients. Overall, no new major safety concerns were identified in 
patients with ATTR-CM treated with tafamidis as compared to the safety profile identified in ATTR-PN 
patients. 
If comparison between placebo and tafamidis treatment does not show any major discrepancies, the 
comparison between tafamidis 20mg and tafamidis 80mg revealed interesting differences.

Some adverse events were reported more frequently with tafamidis 80mg compared to tafamidis 
20mg:  Diarrhea and nausea were reported more often in patients treated with tafamidis 80mg 
compared to tafamidis 20mg: 8% vs 2,3% for diarrhea and 5,7% vs 1,1% for nausea. As well for “Pain 
in extremity” more reported with tafamidis 80mg (15,3%) compared with tafamidis 20mg (6,8%). 
At the opposite, UTI was more frequently reported with tafamidis 20mg than with tafamidis 80mg 
(5,7% vs 2,3%). 
Regarding AEs reported in the “Cardiac disorders” SOCs, “cardiac failure acute” was more reported in 
patients treated with tafamidis 80mg (13,6%) compared to patients treated with 20mg (4,5%).  
Cardiac failure acute in patients treated with tafamidis 80mg remained higher through all treatment 
periods compared to patients treated with tafamidis 20mg. Frequencies of cardiac failure acute 
reported with tafamidis 80mg was similar to those reported with placebo (see table summarizing 
number of subjects treated by period and by arm and number of subjects with acute cardiac failure). 
The MAH discussed why “cardiac failure acute” are more reported in the tafamidis 80mg treatment arm 
compared to tafamidis 20mg. Due to the fact that verbatim terms utilized by different investigators 
may vary when describing similar adverse events, heart failure may be coded as “cardiac failure” or 
“cardiac failure acute” when MedDRA coding is programmatically applied at the Preferred Term (PT) 
level. That’s why the MAH reviewed all relevant PTs in the “Cardiac Failure” Standardised MedDRA 
Query (SMQ) [Narrow]. The data presented do not differentiate doses of 20mg and 80mg or placebo in 
terms of TEAEs that are quite comparable. The discrepancy for acute cardiac failure probably stems 
from the fact that the term Narrow « Cardiac Failure acute » fluctuates between the groups but is 
compensated for by other “narrow” terms equally valid for defining acute heart failure. When all the 
“narrow” terms are cumulated there is no difference. Moreover, list of TEAEs by MedDRA SOC and PT 
(Table 14.3.1.2.3.3.1) do not show any difference between the 2 tafamidis dosages regarding SOC 
Cardiac disorders (60.2%, 55.1% and 61.6% of TEAEs reported respectively in tafamidis 20mg, 
tafamidis 80mg and placebo group). Therefore question related to pharmacological reason no longer 
seems to be justified.   
Concerning cases with fatal outcome included in study B3461028, 144 cases of death were retrieved 
during the study. 94/144 were reported to disease under study. 50 cases were reported from other 
ethiology (42 other and 8 unknown). This represents 6 patients (6,8%) with tafamidis 20mg, 21 
patients (12%) with tafamidis 80mg and 23 patients (13%) with placebo. Number of deaths not due to 
disease progression was slightly higher in the tafamidis 80mg arm compared to the 20mg arm.  
The MAH discussed the 50 death cases not due to disease progression in study B3461028.  Cases 
related to pneumonia, septic shocks or cardiac failure were all assessed as unrelated to study drug.  
Regarding dose reduction due to adverse events, two subjects included in the tafamidis 80mg 
treatment group presented dose reduction due to related adverse events (moderate urinary tract pain 
and moderate headache).  
The possibility of dose reduction in case of adverse events may be a problem with the choice of a single 
high dose (61mg). The MAH suggests that because there are only 2 cases of dose-reduction and that 
the safety profile of the tafamidis 80mg group was comparable to the placebo or tafamidis 20mg groups, 
the need for a dose reduction is not warranted. Even if the safety profile of tafamidis 80mg appears to 
be well tolerated, there are no safety data available with tafamidis 61mg in phase 3 clinical trials. In the 
phase 1 clinical trials (B3461054 and B3461056), “headache” is described as the most reported TEAEs. 
The few cases concerning dose reduction with tafamidis 80mg does not allow to state that there will be 
no safety problem with the 61mg dosage.  
Laboratories abnormalities and their potential clinical impact. 
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 74/95 
 
 
 
Low neutrophils count was the abnormal laboratory values often reported in the tafamidis group in 
healthy subjects (8 HV patients (2,7%) vs 1 (1,4%) in placebo group). In the B3461028 pivotal study, 
low neutrophils count was also more often observed with tafamidis (80mg and 20mg) compared to 
placebo: Neutrophils <0.8 x LLN 1,9% with tafamidis 80mg, 1,2% with tafamidis 20mg and 0,6% with 
placebo. It is to be noted that pneumonia were mostly reported in patients treated with tafamidis 
(pooled data 20mg and 80mg) compared to the placebo (12,25% vs 9,5%). Moreover 6 cases of 
pneumonia and 6 cases of septic shock were reported in the line-listing of deaths for study B3461028.  
In the last PSUSA 00002842/201805 20 of the 25 septic cases issued from clinical trials concerned 
studies performed in ATTR-CM patients.  
The MAH discussed the risk of sepsis or infections in the ATTR-CM patients treated with tafamidis, taking 
into account the biological results observed for neutrophils count. The incidence for sepsis and sepsis-
related TEAEs, as for serious TEAEs, in study B3461028 are comparable among the treatment groups. 
Provided safety data did not highlight a relationship between tafamidis and infections and dose-related 
effect. Regarding evolution of neutrophil counts during study B3461028, changes from Baseline by visit 
up to 30 months shows no evidence of sustained decrease in neutrophil counts for both tafamidis groups 
compared to placebo group. Moreover, as discussed in Question 84, death cases related to pneumonia 
and septic shocks were all assessed as unrelated to study drug. The provided data are reassuring.  
Regarding treatment related hepatic events (table 49), “liver function test increased” was mostly 
reported with tafamidis 80mg compared to placebo and tafamidis 20mg (3,4% vs 0,6% vs 0% 
respectively). Gamma-glutamyltransferase was more reported with tafamidis (3,4%with tafamidis 
80mg and 2,3% with tafamidis 20mg) compared to placebo (2,8%).  
Among the 19 hepatic events possibly related to tafamidis, 15 concerned patients treated with 
tafamidis 80mg (only 4 patients on tafamidis 20mg). The two reported case of dose interruption 
(10011004, 10011004) due to increase of liver function concerned patients treated with tafamidis 
80mg. Dose was not changed in 17 cases; Cases resolved without dose change in 9 cases. Although 
the 19 reported cases did not raise significant hepatic risk, the cases were mostly reported with 
tafamidis 80mg.  
To be noted in non-clinical studies, Tafamidis-associated hepatic alterations were observed at 
exposures approximately ≥0.7-times the human exposure at a dose of 61 mg tafamidis and 2.5-times 
the human exposure at a dose of 20 mg tafamidis meglumine. 
Hepatotoxicity is an important potential risk mentioned in the risk management plan (RMP) of 
Vyndaqel 20 mg.  
Given these data, although biological results and clinical data did not raise significant risk of hepatic 
damage, hepatotoxicity should continue to be closely monitor with tafamidis, especially with the high 
dosage. 
Due to the high affinity binding of tafamidis to the thyroxine receptor, there is a theoretical risk of 
thyroid function abnormalities related to displacement of thyroxine from the thyroxine binding site on 
the transthyretin tetramer.  
In the B3461028 Cohort, a decrease from baseline in mean total thyroxine values was observed in 
both the tafamidis 20 mg and tafamidis 80 mg groups with greater decrease in tafamidis 80 mg: 
Thyroxine <0,8x LLN 29,9% with tafamidis 80mg, 12,3% with tafamidis 20mg and 4,5% with placebo.   
Treatment-related thyroid-related TEAEs by patient in all tafamidis cohort were reported: 8 cases were 
reported; one case of hyperthtyroidism and 7 cases of hypothyroidism. Among the 7 cases of 
hypothyroidism, 5 concerned tafamidis 80mg. Changes in thyroid dysfunction are an important 
potential risk in the RMP of Vyndaqel 20mg.  
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 75/95 
 
 
 
Although biological results and clinical data did not raise significant risk of thyroid damage, changes in 
thyroid function should continue to be closely monitored with tafamidis, especially with the high dose 
as reflected in the agreed RMP. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
N/A 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of tafamidis for the treatment of ATTR-CM did not reveal any major safety concern. 
Results from the pivotal Phase 3 Study B3461028 demonstrate that oral tafamidis meglumine dosed at 
either 20 mg or 80 mg once daily was generally well tolerated with a safety profile comparable to 
placebo. The majority of events were mild to moderate in severity.  
However, even if the safety profile of tafamidis 80mg appears to be well tolerated, it should be kept in 
mind that there are no safety data available with tafamidis 61mg in phase 3 clinical trials. The few cases 
concerning dose reduction with tafamidis 80mg do not allow to state that there will be no safety problem 
with the 61mg dosage.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The target indication is for the treatment wild-type or hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis in adult 
patients with cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). 
The disease, also called ATTR-CM in this document, is caused by the accumulation of misfolded 
transthyretin (TTR) amyloid fibrils in the myocardium, leading to restrictive cardiomyopathy, heart 
failure, and ultimately in death.    
The aim of new treatment is to reduce all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalisation.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are currently no approved pharmacologic treatments for ATTR-CM.  
All drugs authorized to treat patients with hereditary TTR amyloidosis are only indicated in patients 
with symptoms of polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN): tafamidis 20mg (VYNDAQEL), inotersen (TEGSEDI), 
patisiran (ONPATTRO).  
Treatments to manage ATTR-CM symptoms include a broad range of medications used to treat heart 
failure, pacemaker placement for cardiac arrhythmias. Liver and/or heart transplantation may be an 
option for some patients (Falk 2011). 
Hereditary ATTR-CM, inherited by a mutation in the TTR gene, appears aggressive with a median 
survival of about 26 months. Wild-type ATTR-CM is a more progressive disease, caused by the 
deterioration of TTR with age, with a median survival of about 43 months (Ruberg et al. 2012). 
It can be concluded that there is a significant unmet medical need in both hereditary and wild-type 
ATTR-CM patients for an effective and safe treatment to slow the progression of disease and improve 
patient outcomes. 
Of note, early access demands of Vyndaqel 20mg to treat ATTR-CM patients are handled at national 
levels in some of the Member States. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy submitted is a single phase 3, multicenter, randomised, double-blind, 3-
arm, placebo-controlled study comparing 2 arms with tafamidis (20mg dose arm and 80mg dose arm) 
versus placebo in 441 hereditary and wild-type ATTR-CM patients with a 30-month duration of double-
blind treatment. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Favourable effects of tafamidis pooled 20mg and 80mg:  
According to the primary analysis performed with the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld method, treatment with 
tafamidis (pooled 20mg and 80mg arms) was superior to placebo over 30 months (p<0.001).   
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 82/95 
 
 
 
Regarding the components of the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld analysis: 
- all-cause mortality at month 30 was reduced by 30.2% in the tafamidis groups compared to placebo: 
29.5% with pooled tafamidis vs 42.9% with placebo, statistically significant (p=0.0259), with a 
difference between groups observed after 16 months of treatment.  
- the frequency of CV-related hospitalizations per year for the ITT analysis set was reduced by 32.3% 
with pooled tafamidis compared to placebo: 52.3% with tafamidis vs 60.5% with placebo, statistically 
significant (p<0.0001). 
The win ratio for the primary analysis is 1.695 (95% CI 1.255, 2.289), indicating that a 
tafamidis-treated patient had a 69.5% higher chance of having a better outcome based on a 
hierarchical combination of all-cause mortality and CV-related hospitalisation relative to a placebo 
patient. 
Regarding key secondary endpoints, tafamidis reduced, at month 30, the decline in the distance 
walked during the 6-minute test as compared with placebo (difference of 75.68 metres [SE, ±9.24; 
p<0.001]) and in the KCCQ-OS score as compared with placebo (difference of 13.65 points [SE, 
±2.13; p<0.001]). 
The same trend as the primary endpoint was observed for CV-related mortality, which was a secondary 
endpoint, with a reduction by 30.9% in the tafamidis groups compared to placebo: 20.1% with pooled 
tafamidis vs 28.2% with placebo, (p=0.0383), and a difference between groups observed after 16 
months of treatment. 
Regarding the secondary endpoint TTR stabilisation at Month 1, significantly more patients in the 
pooled tafamidis group (86.1%) demonstrated TTR stabilisation than was observed for patients in the 
placebo group (3.5%), (p<0.0001).    
Regarding subgroup analyses, the following favourable results are of interest:   
- Regarding TTR genotype, results were consistent for both hereditary and wild-type ATTR-CM, with 
favorable results observed with tafamidis compared to placebo, for the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld primary 
analysis on all-cause mortality and CV-related hospitalizations, its components, the distance walked 
during the 6-minute test and the KCCQ-OS score, CV-related mortality and TTR stabilization at Month 
1. 
- Regarding NYHA Class I-II, favorable results were observed with tafamidis compared to placebo for 
the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld primary analysis on all-cause mortality and CV-related hospitalizations, its 
components, the distance walked during the 6-minute test and the KCCQ-OS score, CV-related 
mortality and TTR stabilization at Month 1. 
- Regarding NYHA Class III, favorable results were observed with tafamidis compared to placebo for 
all-cause mortality only in the composite primary endpoint, and key secondary endpoints at Month 30 
(distance walked during the 6-minute test and the KCCQ-OS score).  
Favourable effects of separate doses (tafamidis 20 mg or tafamidis 80 mg):  
The study was not powered to conclude on a difference between doses. In fact, the observed results do 
not allow at all to distinguish better favourable effects of the 80mg over the 20mg dose on any clinical 
endpoints. Even, there was a trend to slightly reduced events in the 20mg compared to the 80mg on 
the main clinical efficacy endpoints. 
- Both separate 20 mg and 80 mg doses of tafamidis were superior to placebo over 30 months on the 
Finkelstein-Schoenfeld primary analysis of all-cause mortality and frequency of CV-related 
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 83/95 
 
 
 
hospitalisations: p=0.0048 with the 20 mg and p=0.0030 with the 80 mg group. This is confirmed 
when focusing on the win-ratio of both doses, respectively 1.81 and 1.64 for the 20 mg and 80 mg. 
The same favorable results were observed with both separate 20 mg and 80 mg doses for both of the 
components of the primary analysis (all-cause mortality and CV-related hospitalizations, key secondary 
endpoints at Month 30 (distance walked during the 6-minute test and the KCCQ-OS score), other 
secondary endpoints (CV-related mortality, TTR stabilization at Month 1), exploratory endpoints (NT-
proBNP and troponin I).   
- Separate dose of 80mg: A higher favourable effect of the 80mg compared to the 20mg was only 
presented on the post hoc exploratory endpoints on the reduction of NT-proBNP and troponin I at 
Month 30 (p=0.0468 and p=0.2479).  
- Separate dose of 20mg: A trend to a higher favourable effect of the 20mg compared to the 80mg 
was observed with lower events in the 20mg dose group compared to the 80mg dose group on all the 
clinical endpoints: all-cause deaths (27.3% with the 20mg vs 30.7% with the 80mg), CV-related 
hospitalization (47.7% with the 20mg vs 54.5% with the 80mg) and also CV-related deaths (21.6% 
with the 20mg vs 25.6% with the 80mg).   
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
- Patients without symptoms of heart failure - NYHA Class I: a medical need and a clinical benefit 
cannot be clearly drawn from clinical pivotal results, considering the weak number of included NYHA 
Class I patients (<10%)     
There are some uncertainties regarding patients with NYHA Class I. Indeed, the diagnosis ATTR-CM 
cannot be formally established without a number of specific procedures (biopsy, scintigraphy, TTR 
identification, genotyping…). Such heavy clinical management could be questionable in patients 
without symptoms of heart failure, while a clinical benefit can be considered as expected, despite the 
weak number of included NYHA Class I patients in clinical pivotal study (<10%). There is a risk of 
misuse in the elderly in the absence of clear diagnosis of ATTR-CM. A genotyping test in a family 
context is not the only reason to diagnose ATTR-CM in NYHA Class I patients.      
- Patients with NYHA class III: unlikely to benefit        
In patients with NYHA class III, the rates of CV-related hospitalisations were higher among patients 
receiving tafamidis than among those receiving placebo (76.9% vs 58.7%) and CV-related mortality 
tended to be higher with tafamidis compared to placebo (51.3% vs 49.2%).  
Further analyses according to the doses and time course have been provided to better characterise the 
effect of tafamidis, notably in more severe patients who may not benefit from this treatment.  
Regarding when does tafamidis shows evidence of effect, it is clear from the 6MWT and the KCCQ OS Ls 
means that it does start to effect early: as early as 6 months, which is very relevant in this population 
with untreated short survival. Unlike expected, there was no evidence that the higher dose had a distinct 
effect  on  clinical  response,  even  when  the  biological  biomarkers  of  MoA  (tafamidis  stabilisation)  and 
disease severity (NTproBNP) detach also early. 
As from above, there is unfortunately no clinical evidence that treating with a higher dose starts working 
earlier, or that the benefit is sure at 30 months time. The biomarker data cannot be a sufficiently robust 
assurance of better effect.  
 - Choice of the 80mg dose rather than 20mg 
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 84/95 
 
 
 
The data presented to distinguish a pharmacological benefit between 80mg and 20 mg were not 
considered relevant. The post hoc exploratory endpoints NT-proBNP and troponin I were not endorsed 
from methodological and clinical points of view. 
The Applicant argumentation based on a differentiation between the doses on the all-cause mortality 
analysis from B3461045 data (reduction in risk of death for patients on the tafamidis 80 mg dose 
relative to 20 mg) was not endorsed from a methodological point of view. However, data regarding 
group analysis of the re-randomised placebo arm to 20 mg or 80 mg of tafamidis have been provided. 
Further sensitivity analysis, considering relevant co-factors such as NYHA class, age, NT-proBNP and 
mortality have also been performed. 
From the provided results, it can be admitted that in the studied population as a group, the 80 mg 
dose may seem a bit more effective than the 20 mg dose. Still, the imbalances in the re-randomized 
population cannot allow an absolute certitude. Analysis favoured 80 mg dose; but even when adjusted 
for age, NT-proBNP, and 6MWT did not have the 95CI detached from 1.0.  
A trend of a higher favourable effect of the 20mg compared to the 80mg was observed with lower 
events in the 20mg dose group compared to the 80mg dose group on all the clinical endpoints: all-
cause deaths (27.3% with the 20mg vs 30.7% with the 80mg), CV-related hospitalization (47.7% with 
the 20mg vs 54.5% with the 80mg), confirmed when focusing on the win-ratio of both doses (1.81 for 
the 20 mg and 1.64 for the 80 mg), and also CV-related deaths (21.6% with the 20mg vs 25.6% with 
the 80mg). However the Applicant chose not to apply for the cardiology indication for the 20mg.   
TTR % stabilisation values  
estimated in the pharmacological program for the 80mg dose selection were questionable, since results 
from the phase III pivotal study reveal comparable rates at 12 months between the 2 doses arms: 
82.7% with the 20mg and 87.8% with the 80mg. This was disturbing since the study was more 
powered for the 80mg group, with twice more patients than in the 20mg group and the dose of 80mg 
was 4 time higher than the 20mg.  
- New formulation of 61 mg tafamidis free acid: bioequivalence to 4 x 20 mg formulation  
This formulation has been studied only in short term PK/PD studies and failed to formally prove 
bioequivalence with the 4x20 mg formulation on single dose study in accordance to guidelines. Efficacy 
and safety data from clinical study in the target population with the 61mg formulation are lacking.      
However, considering the reassuring safety data and the efficacy benefits in a large range of daily 
doses (20mg and 80mg), the approval of the 61mg formulation was agreed in this particular case, 
despite the above mentioned limits.  
The applicant justified why steady state conditions are the most relevant here. They acknowledged 
that formal bioequivalence has not been proven, but in the context, changes in exposure, and higher 
Cmax in particular, are not expected to be relevant.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Regarding safety, overall, the results from the pivotal Phase 3 Study B3461028 demonstrate that oral 
tafamidis meglumine dosed at 80 mg once daily was well tolerated with a safety profile comparable to 
placebo when used for the treatment of adult patients with ATTR-CM due to either variant or wild-type 
TTR. The majority of events were mild to moderate in severity. Severe related adverse events were 
slightly reported compared to mild or moderate related TEAEs in all treatment groups. A smaller 
proportion of patients discontinued due to adverse events in the tafamidis-treated groups compared to 
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 85/95 
 
 
 
placebo. Overall, no major safety concerns were identified in patients with ATTR-CM treated with 
tafamidis as compared to the safety profile identified in ATTR-PN patients. 
- Patients with NYHA class III: unlikely to benefit     
In patients with NYHA class III, the rates of CV-related hospitalisations were higher among patients 
receiving tafamidis than among those receiving placebo (76.9% vs 58.7%) and CV-related mortality 
tended to be higher with tafamidis compared to placebo (51.3% vs 49.2%).   
In this context, the decision to start or maintain treatment should be taken at the discretion of the 
cardiologist, as mentioned in section 4.2 of the SPC.   
- Safety of pooled tafamidis:  
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAs) “asthenia” and “pneumonia” were mostly reported in 
patients treated with tafamidis (pooled data 20mg and 80mg) compared to the placebo: 11,3% vs 
6,2% for asthenia and 12,25% vs 9,6% for pneumonia.  
Low neutrophils count (<0.8 x LLN) was the abnormal laboratory values reported more in the tafamidis 
group compared to placebo: 1,9% with tafamidis 80mg, 1,2% with tafamidis 20mg and 0,6% with 
placebo.   
- Safety of 80mg tafamidis:  
Some adverse events were more reported with tafamidis 80mg compared to tafamidis 20mg:  diarrhea 
and nausea (8% vs 2,3% for diarrhea and 5,7% vs 1,1% for nausea), pain in extremity (15,3% vs 
6,8%), cardiac failure acute (13,6% vs 4,5%), syncope (3,4% vs 0%). 
Cardiac failure acute in patients treated with tafamidis 80mg remained also higher through all 
treatment periods compared to patients treated with tafamidis 20mg. Frequencies of cardiac failure 
acute reported with tafamidis 80mg was similar to those reported with placebo (9,6%). This trend for 
acute cardiac failure with tafamidis 80mg is also observed in the Broad cohort (11,5% vs 5,2% with 
the 20mg).   
Regarding treatment related hepatic events, “liver function test increased” was mostly reported with 
tafamidis 80mg compared to placebo and tafamidis 20mg (3,4% vs 0,6% vs 0% respectively). 
Gamma-glutamyltransferase was more reported with tafamidis (3,4% with tafamidis 80mg and 2,3% 
with tafamidis 20mg) compared to placebo (2,8%). Among the 19 hepatic events possibly related to 
tafamidis, 15 concerned patients treated with tafamidis 80mg (only 4 patients on tafamidis 20mg). The 
2 reported case of dose interruption due to increase of liver function concerned patients treated with 
tafamidis 80mg. Hepatotoxicity is an important potential risk mentioned in the RMP of Vyndaqel and 
should continue to be closely monitored with tafamidis, especially with the high dosage. 
One severe case of pancreatitis was reported with tafamidis 80mg. 
A decrease of thyroxine level was mostly reported in the tafamidis 80mg arm (29,9%) compared to 
tafamidis 20mg arm (12,3%) or placebo arm (4,5%). Among the 7 cases of hypothyroidism, 5 
concerned tafamidis 80mg. Changes in thyroid dysfunction are an important potential risk mentioned 
in the PGR of Vyndaqel 20mg and should continue to be closely monitored with tafamidis, especially 
with the high dosage. 
- Safety of 20mg tafamidis: 
Some adverse events were more reported with tafamidis 20mg compared to tafamidis 80mg: UTI 
(5,7% vs 2,3%), cardiac failure congestive (15,9% vs 11,9%), acute kidney injury (10,2% vs 7,4%).

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
- Patients without symptoms of heart failure - NYHA Class I:  
There is a risk of misuse in the elderly in the absence of clear diagnosis of ATTR-CM in patients without 
symptoms.       
A Healthcare Professional Guide (HCP Guide) is proposed as a one-time distribution to all potential 
prescribers, including physicians knowledgeable in the management of patients with amyloidosis 
and/or cardiomyopathy, in each Member State where Vyndaqel 61 mg is launched for ATTR-CM.  
Key message on the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of ATTR-CM in the HCP Guide were agreed and 
reflected in Annex II of the product information and the RMP.  
The potential off-label use will be monitored in the THAOS registry, which will be extended to cardiac 
settings until 2023 and will allow to collect: additional safety data on patients with ATTR-CM, from all 
NYHA Class (including NYHA Class IV), and information regarding diagnosis criteria.  
- New formulation of 61 mg tafamidis free acid: There is no possibility to reduce the dose in case of 
adverse events with the choice of a single high dose (61mg). However, both doses of tafamidis tested 
in main clinical study were relatively well tolerated.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Given there are currently no approved specific pharmacological treatment for ATTR-CM, an ultimately 
fatal disease, there is a significant unmet medical need for an effective and safe treatment to slow the 
progression of disease and improve patient outcomes.  
In this context, study B3461028 is the first phase 3 study demonstrating a reduction of all-cause 
mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalisation in a selected population of patients with ATTR-CM.  
The reduction of all-cause mortality at month 30 and frequency of CV-related hospitalizations per year 
can be considered of main importance. A relevant positive effect on walking function assessed with the 
6MWT and on quality of life assessed with the KCCQ-OS score as key secondary endpoints is another 
point of interest for this degenerative disease, but the magnitude of the effect is more difficult to 
appreciate.  
Regarding safety, overall, results demonstrate that oral tafamidis meglumine dosed at either 20 mg or 
80 mg once daily was well tolerated with a safety profile comparable to placebo in the target 
population. No major safety concerns were identified in patients with ATTR-CM treated with tafamidis 
as compared to the safety profile identified in ATTR-PN patients. 
Efficacy results are consistent for both hereditary and wild-type ATTR-CM, but there is a tendency to 
higher clinical events and lower TTR stabilization in the variant TTR genotype group, compared to the 
wild-type TTR genotype group, that will need further assessment.  
The severity of the disease can be distinguished between the variant and the wild-type forms. Indeed, 
when considering the mechanism of the disease, variant TTR is inherited by mutation in hereditary 
forms, while in wild-type forms, TTR is becoming unstable with age, without clear origin. Variant forms 
can be detected earlier, in a family context, even before the onset of cardiac symptoms, and can be 
associated with neurologic phenotype. Wild-type patients are around 75 year-old at diagnosis and are 
also associated with multiple non-cardiac symptoms such as deafness, carpa tunnel syndrome or 
lumbar canal stenosis, and may be common in the elderly population (>80-85 year-old). It seems that 
the evolution of the disease differs between these 2 types, with median survival of 25.6 months for 
variants and 43.0 months for wild-type.  
Consequently, since the medical need may not be the same, with a more severe and evolutive disease 
in the variant patients, the management of patients may differ. In this context, TTR genotyping was 
added to section 4.2 of the SmPC among the assessment tools for diagnosis.   
There are some uncertainties regarding patients with NYHA Class I. Indeed, the diagnosis ATTR-CM 
cannot be formally established without a number of specific procedures (biopsy, scintigraphy, TTR 
identification, genotyping). Such heavy clinical management could be questionable in patients without 
symptoms of heart failure, while a clinical benefit can be considered as expected, despite the weak 
number of included NYHA Class I patients in clinical pivotal study (<10%). There is a risk of misuse in 
the elderly in patients with signs of heart failure without ATTR-CM, which will be mitigated with the 
distribution of the Healthcare Professional Guide, intended to cardiologists, providing them the clinical 
criteria for the diagnosis of ATTR-CM and informing them about the importance to participate to the 
THAOS registry.  
There are some uncertainties regarding the clinical benefit in the subgroup of NYHA Class III, since the 
tafamidis was not superior to placebo on the main clinical endpoints, which questions on the relevance 
of late treatment initiation (related to the severity of symptoms or age). In this context, the decision to 
Assessment report  
EMA/3391/2020  
Page 90/95 
 
 
 
start or maintain treatment should be taken at the discretion of the cardiologist, as mentioned in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC.   
Furthermore, it should be noted that the risk of off-label use cannot be considered low.  
In this context, the key message on the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of ATTR-CM were revised in 
the Healthcare Professional Guide and the revised protocol of the THAOS registry will be submitted as 
post-authorisation measure in 2020.  
The MAH has not provided fully convincing arguments to select 61 mg (80 mg equivalent) dose as 
compared to 20 mg regarding hard parameters of clinical efficacy. The selected approach regarding 
NT-proBNP and the other PK parameters related to TTR stabilization and fostered outcomes are not in 
line with what has been clinically observed in study B3461028. However, the 80 mg dose has the 
largest evidence base that is twice as large than for the 20 mg dose. Moreover, tafamidis was similarly 
well tolerated across both dose groups. 
Therefore, considering also that there are no clear biomarker target levels, signs, or symptoms to steer 
dosing and the therapy has shown morbi/mortality benefit it is agreed that the 61mg dose is an 
appropriate dose in this particular context of severe and evolutive disease. The benefit-risk balance of 
the 61 mg dose was considered positive.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The overall balance benefit risk of tafamidis to treat ATTR-CM patients is favourable from pooled 
tafamidis doses in the overall population, and tafamidis 80mg/61mg doses was considered effective in 
the claimed indication. The benefit-risk balance of the 61 mg dose is positive.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Vyndaqel is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Vyndaqel is not similar to Onpattro and Tegsendi within 
the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Derogation from market exclusivity 
Not applicable, since Vyndaqel is not deemed to be “similar” to any authorised orphan medicinal 
product.

Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of, Vyndaqel 61 mg soft capsules is favourable in the following indication: 
Vyndaqel is indicated for the treatment of wild-type or hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis in adult 
patients with cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for Vyndaqel to 
introduce a new strength (tafamidis 61 mg soft capsules) and to introduce qualitative change in 
declared active substance (tafamidis) not defined as a new active substance subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription. 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to the launch of Vyndaqel (tafamidis) in each Member State, the MAH must agree on the content 
and format of the Healthcare Professional Guide, including communication media, distribution 
modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority. 
The Healthcare Professional Guide is aimed at raising prescribers awareness around:

avoidance of pregnancy and the need to use effective contraception methods. 
Advising female patients to inform their doctor immediately in case of exposure to tafamidis 
during (or within 1 month prior to) pregnancy for physicians’ reporting and assessment. 
Joining the Tafamidis Enhanced Surveillance for Pregnancy Outcomes (TESPO) program in case 
of exposure to tafamidis during pregnancy to collect additional data on pregnancy outcome, 
birth, neonate/infant health and 12 month follow-up with milestones reached; details on how 
to report pregnancies for women receiving Vyndaqel (tafamidis) will be provided. 
Advising patients to contact their doctor about any adverse events while taking tafamidis and 
reminding physicians and pharmacists of the requirement to report suspected adverse 
reactions related to Vyndaqel (tafamidis). 
The clinical criteria for the diagnosis of ATTR-CM before prescribing tafamidis, to avoid 
administration to non-qualifying patients. 
Encouraging patients to enter the Transthyretin-Associated Amyloidosis Outcome Survey (THAOS). 
Details will be provided on how to enrol patients into this international disease registry through 
participating sites (list of EU participating sites will be provided). 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where tafamidis is marketed, all Healthcare 
Professionals who are expected to prescribe tafamidis have access to/are provided with the following 
educational material: 
The Healthcare Professional Guide with a list of EU participating sites for the Transthyretin-Associated 
Amyloidosis Outcome Survey (THAOS) study. 
Specific Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures for the 
marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
This being an approval under exceptional circumstances and pursuant to Article 14(8) of Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004, the MAH shall conduct, within the stated timeframe, the following measures: 
Description 
Due date 
Within the planned post-authorisation sub-study of the THAOS registry the MAH 
Annual 
shall evaluate in non-V30M patients the effects of Vyndaqel on disease

Not applicable. 
Additional Data exclusivity/Marketing protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the Pfizer Europe MA EEIG, taking into account 
the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new 
Assessment report

therapeutic indication brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see 
appendix 2). 
This additional 1 year of marketing protection can only be granted if the authorisation of the variation 
related to this new indication is granted within the first 8 years of the 10 years of marketing 
protection. 
However, for the present application, the period of the eight years has elapsed before the MAH 
obtained an authorisation for this new therapeutic indication which, during the scientific evaluation was 
considered to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies and hence the 
additional 1 year of marketing protection cannot be granted.  
In addition, CHMP recommends the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation, concerning 
the following change(s): 
Variations requested

IIIB 
Type II variation (C.I.4) to update Annex II to add to the key elements of the risk minimisation 
measures wording pertaining to the Tafamidis Enhanced Surveillance for Pregnancy Outcomes (TESPO) 
programme and to update sections 2, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.1 and 6.5 of the 
SmPC of Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine) 20 mg soft capsules, Annex II and IIIA and IIIB to align it to 
Vyndaqel 61 mg soft capsule.  
In addition, it was agreed to update to Section 16 Information in Braille of Annex IIIa - Labelling 
(carton) to differentiate between the dosage forms. 
In addition, an updated RMP version 9.3 was agreed.

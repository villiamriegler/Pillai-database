(FIGO Stages III and IV) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in 
response (complete or partial) to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Rubraca is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-

Incidence and prevalence:  
  The majority of cases of ovarian cancer are of epithelial origin (∼90%).1 
  Based upon estimates obtained from Globocan 2020, the 5-year prevalence of ovarian cancer in 
women in the 27 EU member states (EU-27) population is 49.58 per 100,000.2  
  Using the Globocan 2020 database, the incidence of ovarian cancer in females in EU-27 is 45,470. 
The 5-year prevalence are 12,824.2 
  Based on European data, the prevalence of ovarian cancer provided in the 2016 Orphanet Report is 
30.0 per 100,000.4  
  The incidence of ovarian cancer varies across the continent with the highest incidence rates (> 15.7 
per 100,000) reported in Latvia, Poland, Bulgaria, Lithuania, United Kingdom (UK), and Estonia; and 
the lowest incidence rates (< 10.3 per 100,000) reported in Portugal, Netherlands, Cyprus, Germany, 
and Austria. A similar pattern was reported for prevalence.1,5 
  Based on data recorded by Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) between 2009 and 
2013, the age-adjusted number of new cases of ovarian cancer in the United States (US) was 11.9 per 
100,000 women per year.6 
  Approximately 1.3% of women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer at some point during their 
lifetime, based on 2010 to 2012 SEER data.6 
Breast cancer gene (BRCA)1/2 mutations: 
  Approximately 10% to 15% of all cases of ovarian malignancies are associated with germline 
mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Somatic mutations occur less frequently in 5% to 10% of ovarian 
cancers.7 
  The estimated lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is 25% to 65% among BRCA1 mutation carriers and 
15% to 20% among BRCA2 mutation carriers, which is dramatically increased compared to that of 
the general population (1.5%).8,9 
Non-BRCA homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) Mutations: 
  Mutations in non-BRCA HRD genes have also been associated with an increased risk of ovarian 
cancer. For example, germline mutations in BRCA1 interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1 
(BRIP1), BRCA1/BRCA2-containing complex, subunit 5 (RAD5)1C and RAD51D confer a lifetime 
risk up to age 70 of 5.8%, 5.2%, and 12.0%, respectively.10-12

EU-RMP/Part II/SI 
Demographics of the population in the proposed indication – age, gender, racial and/or ethnic 
origin and risk factors for the disease:  
  Ovarian cancer is predominantly a disease of older, post-menopausal women with the majority 
(> 80%) of cases being diagnosed in women over 50 years.1 
  The age-adjusted incidence of new ovarian cases per 100,000 women is slightly higher among Whites 
(12.5) and Non-Hispanics (12.0) than Hispanics (10.6), American Indian/Alaskan Natives (10.4), 
Blacks (9.6), and Asian/Pacific Islanders (9.3).6 
Risk factors 
  Approximately 90% of ovarian cancer cases are thought to be sporadic.8 However, women with a 
family history of ovarian cancer have an increased risk for the disease.6,13 Women with a first-degree 
relative who has ovarian cancer have more than a two-fold increase in risk of ovarian cancer 
compared with women with no family history.1 
In women with a BRCA1 mutation, risk of ovarian cancer onset begins to increase by age 36 to 
39 years with a 2% to 3% risk by 40 years of age. For BRCA2 mutations, risk begins to increase by 
44 to 46 years, with a 2% to 3% risk by 50 years of age.8 
 
  There is a higher incidence of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations in individuals with Ashkenazi Jewish 
heritage, conferring a 16% lifetime risk for ovarian cancer.8,13,14 
  Mutations in non-BRCA HRD genes have also been associated with an increased risk of ovarian 
cancer. For example, germline mutations in BRIP1, RAD51C and RAD51D confer a lifetime risk up 
to age 70 of 5.8%, 5.2%, and 12.0%, respectively.10-12  
  Use of oral contraceptives is associated with a reduction in ovarian cancer risk of 40% to 50% after 
 
3 years’ cumulative use.8 
In a matched case-control study of 3223 women, the use of oral contraceptives reduced the risk of 
ovarian cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers (odds ratio [OR] = 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.45-0.71; p < 0.0001) and BRCA2 mutation carriers (OR = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.23-0.66; p = 0.0004). 
Parity was associated with a reduced risk for carriers of BRCA1 mutations (OR = 0.67; 95% CI, 
0.46-0.96; p = 0.03), but with an increased risk for those with BRCA2 mutations (OR = 2.74; 95% CI, 
1.18-6.41; p = 0.02). Breastfeeding was associated with a reduced risk for carriers of BRCA1 
mutations (OR = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56-0.97; p = 0.03).15 
  Significant positive association between inactivity and epithelial ovarian cancer risk (OR = 1.34; 95% 
CI, 1.14-1.57) has been reported.16 
  There is a higher risk of relapse in patients for which surgical resection was not complete. In a 
retrospective review of data from 1895 patients with International Federation of Gynaecology and 
Obstetrics stage III epithelial ovarian cancer, compared with patients with microscopic residual 
disease, patients with 0.1 to 1.0 cm and > 1.0 cm residual disease had an increased risk of recurrence 
(hazard ratio [HR] = 1.96; 95% CI, 1.70-2.26; and HR = 2.36; 95% CI, 2.04-2.73, respectively) and 
death (HR =2.11; 95% CI, 1.78-2.49; p < 0.001; and HR = 2.47; 95% CI, 2.09-2.92, respectively).17 
The main existing treatment options 
The standard approach to treatment of advanced ovarian cancer is cytoreductive surgery (either at the time 
of diagnosis or interval debulking), with the goal of minimising residual tumour to no visible residual 
disease, a major prognostic indicator for improved survival. If initial cytoreduction is not performed, 
interval debulking surgery is considered. This surgery may be carried out after 3 or 4 cycles of primary 
chemotherapy, followed by a further 3 cycles of chemotherapy. Six to eight cycles of platinum- and 
taxane-based chemotherapy is the global standard of care.

Maintenance therapy: 
The use of maintenance therapy following a response to standard treatment provides an opportunity to 
extend the progression-free period and delay the time to relapse. The anti-angiogenesis antibody, 
bevacizumab, given with chemotherapy in the first-line setting and then as maintenance showed 
significant improvements in PFS in two studies (GOG 0218 and ICON7), and as a result bevacizumab 
was incorporated into standard of care for first-line ovarian cancer. 
PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy was initially approved as a strategy for improving outcomes in 
recurrent second line and beyond, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer and more recently has been shown to 
be an effective strategy for improving outcomes in the first-line setting following cytoreductive surgery 
and platinum-based chemotherapy.  
PARP inhibitor first-line maintenance therapy: 
Olaparib is recommended as first-line maintenance therapy in the following indications: 
•  Maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced (FIGO stages III and IV) BRCA 1/2-
mutated (germline and/or somatic) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary 
peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line 
platinum-based chemotherapy, and 
•  Maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced (FIGO stages III and IV) BRCA 1/2-
mutated (germline and/or somatic) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary 
peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line 
platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab and whose cancer is associated 
with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) positive status defined by either a BRCA 1/2 
mutation and/or genomic instability.  
Niraparib has also been granted marketing authorisation as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of 
adult patients with advanced epithelial (FIGO Stages III and IV) high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or 
primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line 
platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Recurrent ovarian cancer: 
  Surgery is rarely used for recurrent ovarian cancer.1 
  The most common treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer is platinum-based combination 
chemotherapy (where likely to be tolerated) in platinum-sensitive relapsed disease, typically 
carboplatin or cisplatin in combination with paclitaxel, liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, or 
gemcitabine.17,18 
  Patients who respond to platinum-based chemotherapy (in complete or partial response) may receive 
a PARP inhibitor as a later-line maintenance therapy. 
o  Olaparib is indicted as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with 
platinum-sensitive relapsed BRCA-mutated (germline and/or somatic) high grade serous 
epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (compete 
response or partial response) to platinum-based chemotherapy. 
o  Both rucaparib and niraparib are approved as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of 
adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian 
tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) to platinum-
based chemotherapy. 
  Trabectedin in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is indicated for the treatment of 
patients with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.19

  Hormonal therapy with tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor can be used for women with recurrent, 
platinum-resistant ovarian cancer or in those wishing to avoid or delay further chemotherapy, 
particularly where their original tumour is expressing the oestrogen receptor.18 
  Other therapy, including targeted therapy: 
o  Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody, bevacizumab, is approved in Europe for the 
treatment of advanced or recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer in combination with other agents 
including carboplatin and paclitaxel or gemcitabine. 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including mortality and 
morbidity 
  The age-standardised mortality rate of ovarian cancer in the EU-27 population in 2000 varied from 
6.3 to 15.2 per 100,000 across EU countries, based upon estimates obtained from the European 
Cancer Information System.20 
Increasing age is associated with increased risks for disease progression (HR = 1.06; 95% CI, 
1.02-1.11 for an increase every 10 years) and death (HR = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.06-1.18).17 Based on 
SEER 2009 to 2013 data, the percent of ovarian cancer deaths in the US is highest among women 
aged 65 to 74 years (25.8%), 75 to 84 years (25.0%), and 55 to 64 years (21.4%).6 
 
  The majority of patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer present with advanced stage disease. At the 
time of diagnosis, 14.8% of ovarian cancers were localised, 19% were regional, and 60% were 
distant. The 5-year relative survival rates for localised, regional, and distant ovarian cancers were 
92.1%, 73.1%, and 28.8%, respectively.6,21 
Important co-morbidities 
As the incidence of ovarian cancer increases sharply with age, many patients have one or more other 
chronic diseases. Co-morbidity is an important predictor of prognosis in patients with chronic diseases, 
including cancer.22 In a study of 1540 Danish women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer between 
2000 and 2011, the proportion of patients with co-morbidity was 25% between 2000 and 2002, and 35% 
between 2009 and 2011.22 
Important co-morbidities in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer are presented in Table 1. 
Table 1. 
Important Co-morbidities in Patients with Ovarian Cancer 
Cardiovascular 
Disease 
  A study of 10,174 elderly (≥ 66 years) women in the US with ovarian cancer, 
reported that 3- and 12-month incidence rates (per 1000 person-years) of most 
conditions were significantly higher in cancer than in matched cancer-free 
patients (5087 women in each group): hypertension (177.3 and 47.4, 
respectively); thromboembolic event (145.3 and 5.5, respectively); congestive 
heart failure (113.3 and 28.6, respectively); infection (664.4 and 55.2, 
respectively); and anaemia (408.3 and 33.1, respectively) at 12 months.23 
  Cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and 
 
 
peripheral vascular disease) were reported in 7.4% of newly diagnosed ovarian 
cancer cases in Denmark between 2000 and 2011.22 
In a German study of 1213 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, 
cardiovascular disease was the most frequent co-morbidity (47.5%).24 
In a German open-label trial of 51 women aged 65 years or older with relapsed 
ovarian cancer after failure of platinum-containing therapy, blood pressure and 
heart were the sites of co-morbidity in 18 (14.8%) and 13 (10.7%) of the 
122 concomitant diseases, respectively.25

Cerebrovascular disease was reported in 5.8% (89/1540) of newly diagnosed ovarian 
cancer cases in Denmark between 2000 and 2011.22 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was reported in 5.3% (81/1540) of 
newly diagnosed ovarian cancer cases in Denmark between 2000 and 2011.22 
The true incidence of malignant intestinal obstruction due to progressive disease 
(not a primary diagnosis) is not known.18 
In a German open-label trial of 51 women aged 65 years or older with relapsed 
ovarian cancer after failure of platinum-containing therapy, the lower GI tract was 
the site of co-morbidity in 11 (9.0%) of the 122 concomitant diseases.25 
In a Danish study of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer cases between 2000 and 2011, 
any cancer was the most prevalent co-morbidity, registered in 7.9% (121) of the 
ovarian cancer patients.22 
Patients with ovarian cancer are at increased risk of developing a second primary 
malignancies (SPM). In a nationwide, retrospective, population-based study in 
Taiwan, 12,127 patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer were followed 
between 1997 and 2010. The study period represented a follow-up of 56,214 person-
years. During this time, 707 cancers developed. The Standardised Incidence Ratios 
(SIRs) for haematologic cancer and leukaemia after > 1 year follow-up were 1.72 
(95% CI, 0.96-2.84) and 3.98 (95% CI, 1.99–7.12), respectively. Chemotherapy was 
an independent risk factor for SPM (HR = 1.27; 95% CI, 1.02–1.59, p = 0.033). 
Among the chemotherapy agents included (cyclophosphamide, gemcitabine, 
fluorouracil, platinum, anthracyclines, and taxanes), fluorouracil was associated 
with a significantly increased risk of SPM (HR = 5.18; 95% CI, 3.66–7.33, 
p < 0.001).26 
Female BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers have an increased risk of fallopian 
tube and breast cancer. An estimated 26% to 34% of female BRCA2 carriers will 
develop breast cancer by age 50. Other cancers associated with BRCA2 mutations 
are pancreatic cancer, gall bladder/bile duct cancer, stomach cancer, and 
melanoma.18 
Diagnoses of therapy-related myeloid leukaemia and MDS are recognised 
complications of cytotoxic therapy.27 In patients with ovarian cancer receiving 
platinum-based treatment, a frequency of MDS/AML of 0.33% has been reported.28 
Fulcher et al. reported that the incidence of MDS and AML expressed as cases per 
1,000 patient-years in the ovarian cancer cohort was 0.51 (0.2%) and 0.39 (0.1%) 
and in ovarian cancer-BRCA patients, 0.62 and 0.25, respectively. The incidence of 
MDS and AML in ovarian cancer patients was higher in patient subcohorts exposed 
to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damaging agents than in the overall cohort.29  
Most women with ovarian cancer are post-menopausal at the time of diagnosis and 
others become menopausal due to surgical removal of ovaries, resulting in oestrogen 
deficiency–related health effects, such as increased risk of cardiovascular disease 
and hyperlipidaemia.8 
In a German open-label trial of 51 women aged 65 years or older with relapsed 
ovarian cancer after failure of platinum-containing therapy, the musculoskeletal 
system was the site of co-morbidity in 18 (14.8%) of the 122 concomitant diseases.25 
Depression is a major outcome in cancer patients. In a study of 99 elderly (aged over 
70 years) women with advanced ovarian cancer, undergoing first-line carboplatin 
chemotherapy, 15 (15%) were depressed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for depression, and 39% were depressed 
according to psychiatric clinical interview.30

Part II: Module SII - Non-clinical part of the safety specification 
Key Safety Findings (from Nonclinical Studies) 
Nausea and vomiting 
The oral toxicity of rucaparib was evaluated in a total of 
12 studies, including 10 studies in rats and dogs by single and 
repeated oral dose administration for up to 91 days of daily 
treatment. The GI system was one of the primary target organs 
identified in these studies. In the dog, GI manifested 
principally as clinical signs, which included abnormal stool 
(non-formed, water, liquid, mucoid) and vomiting. Nausea 
cannot be directly assessed in rats and dogs; however, the 
clinical signs associated with GI effects, which included 
emesis for dogs, is consistent with nausea. The GI effects in 
the dog were not dose-limiting and did not affect the general 
health of the animals, but were associated with some body 
weight loss. The toxicities induced in rats and dogs were 
generally reversible after a 4-week recovery period and no 
additional targets were identified in animals following 
prolonged oral dosing. 
Myelotoxicity 
The oral toxicity of rucaparib was evaluated in a total of 
12 studies, including 10 studies in rats and dogs by single and 
repeated oral dose administration for up to 91 days of daily 
treatment. The findings in the rat and dog non-clinical studies 
with rucaparib included changes in the hematopoietic and 
lymphopoietic systems. Data from both the rat and dog 13-
week studies established that, based on hematologic and 
histologic evaluations (bone marrow, spleen, liver, gut-
associated lymphoid tissue, thymus, and lymph nodes), 
changes in hematopoietic tissues were not progressive over 
time. Partial to complete recovery occurred with all changes in 
hematologic parameters and bone marrow cellularity in both 
the rat and dog. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Rats were given oral rucaparib at doses ranging from 50 to 
1000 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 7 to 17 in a non-Good 
Laboratory Practice (GLP) dose range finding embryo-foetal 
development study. Rucaparib caused maternal toxicity at 
doses ≥ 500 mg/kg/day, and was embryotoxic (100% early 
resorptions) at doses ≥ 50 mg/kg/day.  In addition, rucaparib 
induced structural chromosomal aberrations in cultured human 
peripheral blood lymphocytes, with or without metabolic 
activation. 
No animal studies have been performed regarding the 
excretion of rucaparib in breast milk. 
Page 17 of 80 
Relevance to Human Usage 
The GI system was one of the primary 
target organs identified in toxicology 
studies with oral rucaparib. Similarly, 
nausea and vomiting are common 
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
observed in patients.  
The hematopoietic system was one of 
the primary target organs identified in 
toxicology studies with oral 
rucaparib. Similarly, myelotoxicity is 
a common ADRs observed in 
patients. 
Rucaparib can cause embryo or foetal 
harm when administered to a pregnant 
woman. Rucaparib should not be used 
during pregnancy. Embryotoxicity 
and teratogenicity are important 
potential risks for rucaparib. 
Appropriate warnings and precautions 
regarding use during pregnancy are 
provided in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) (SmPC; 
Sections 4.4 and 4.6). To minimise 
the risk of potential harm to an 
embryo or foetus, Section 4.6 of the 
SmPC advises female patients to use 
effective contraception during

Nephrotoxicity 
No evidence of nephrotoxicity was observed in general 
toxicology studies with rucaparib. 
Rucaparib is a potent inhibitor of multidrug and toxic 
compound extrusion (MATE)1 and MATE2-K. 
Hepatotoxicity 
No evidence of hepatotoxicity was observed in general 
toxicology studies with rucaparib.  
Genotoxicity 
Rucaparib camsylate generated by the current commercial 
manufacturing process was negative in a Bacterial Reverse 
Mutation (Ames) Assay. Rucaparib was clastogenic in an in 
vitro chromosomal aberration assay in cultured human 
lymphocytes. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed with 
rucaparib.

treatment and for 6 months following 
the last dose of rucaparib.  
A contraindication regarding use 
during breast feeding is provided in 
the SmPC (SmPC; Section 4.3). 
These results suggest rucaparib has a 
limited potential for nephrotoxicity in 
humans. 
Rucaparib inhibits MATE1/2K 
transporters and consequently inhibits 
MATE1/2 K mediated tubular 
creatinine secretion.  
The clinical significance of increases 
in creatinine due to MATE1/2K 
transporter inhibition is currently 
unknown.  
Based on nonclinical studies, 
rucaparib has a low potential for 
causing hepatotoxicity in humans.  
Whilst elevations of alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) were seen in 
the clinical development programme, 
these were transient and most 
elevations resolved with or without 
modifications of rucaparib dosing. 
Hepatotoxicity is not considered to be 
an important safety concern in 
humans. 
The clastogenic response in 
mitotically-stimulated cells was 
anticipated based on the mechanism 
of action of rucaparib and indicates 
potential genotoxicity in humans. 
Appropriate warnings and precautions 
regarding pregnancy and a nursing 
mother are provided in the SmPC 
based on the positive genotoxicity 
results. 
Carcinogenicity studies are typically 
not performed for therapeutics 
intended to treat patients with 
advanced cancer.

Fertility 
No standalone fertility study was conducted with rucaparib. 
Male reproductive assessment endpoints were evaluated in a 
3-month repeat-dose study in rat and dog. No rucaparib-
related effects on sperm total count, density, motility, or 
morphology, or effects on spermatogenesis were noted at 100 
mg/kg/day in the rat and 20 mg/kg/day in the dog with 
systemic exposures of approximately 30% and 9%, 
respectively, of the human exposure (area under the 
concentration-time curve (AUC)0-24h) at 600 mg twice daily 
(BID). The male and female reproductive organs were not 
identified as target organs with rucaparib dosing in rat or dog. 
However, based on published studies, PARP inhibitors may 
have the potential to impair spermatogenesis and reduce 
fertility.31-34 
General Safety Pharmacology 
Cardiovascular 
Rucaparib had a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) 
value of 22.6 µM in the human ether-a-go-go-related gene 
(hERG) assay; approximately 13-fold higher than the unbound 
maximum plasma drug concentration (Cmax) of 1.79 µM in 
patients treated with 600 mg BID rucaparib. Cardiac effects, 
which were described as myocardial degeneration in the rat 
and a higher incidence of endocardial haemorrhage in dog, 
were observed at necropsy following intravenous (IV) 
administration of rucaparib whereas no effects were observed 
with oral dosing of rucaparib, the intended commercial 
formulation, in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs. 
Exposure data indicated that cardiac lesion development 
following IV dosing was likely Cmax driven as cardiac effects 
were correlated to high Cmax values after IV dosing. The 
cardiac effects observed in nonclinical toxicology studies were 
shown to occur with use of the IV formulation and at doses 
delivering Cmax values ≥5 fold greater than those observed in 
patients at the recommended oral dose of 600 mg BID.  
However, no cardiac effects were observed in any of the 
studies conducted with the oral formulation. 
Nervous system 
There were no neurobehavioural findings in the 91-day repeat-
dose study in rat. In addition, there was a low uptake of [14C] 
rucaparib in brain and spinal cord in rats and based on in vitro 
transporter studies, rucaparib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein 
(P-gp) and breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP).  
Mechanisms for Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) 
Rucaparib as a victim drug 
Rucaparib showed slow in vitro enzymatic turnover rate in 
human liver microsomes and hepatocytes. In another in vitro 
study, recombinant human cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6, and 
Page 19 of 80 
EU-RMP/Part II/SII 
Cumulatively, there were no cases 
concerning the effects of rucaparib on 
fertility received from clinical trials 
sponsored by Clovis Oncology nor 
from post-marketing data. 
The results of the nonclinical studies 
suggest that when given orally, 
rucaparib poses a low risk for 
development of cardiac lesions in 
patients. 
However, a potential risk cannot be 
excluded (SmPC; Section 5.3), and 
QTc interval prolongation is 
considered an important potential 
risk. 
It is unlikely that rucaparib activity in 
the central nervous system (CNS) 
would translate to any significant 
effects in patients.

to a lesser extent CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, could metabolise 
rucaparib.  
In vitro, rucaparib is a dual substrate of P-gp and BCRP. 
Rucaparib as a perpetrator drug 
In vitro studies showed that rucaparib is a reversible inhibitor 
of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, and to a 
lesser extent of CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and uridine 5'-diphospho-
glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A1. Rucaparib induced 
CYP1A2, and down regulated CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 in 
human hepatocytes at clinically relevant exposures. Rucaparib 
is a potent inhibitor of MATE 1 and MATE2-K, a moderate 
inhibitor of organic cation transporter (OCT)1, and a weak 
inhibitor of OCT2. In addition, rucaparib is an in vitro 
inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP. 
EU-RMP/Part II/SII 
showed that patients with different 
CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 genotypes had 
similar rucaparib PK. Contribution of 
CYP3A4 to rucaparib metabolism in 
vivo cannot be excluded. 
Clinical P-gp and BCRP-related DDIs 
with rucaparib as a substrate cannot 
be excluded. 
Rucaparib as a perpetrator drug 
Study CO-338-044 (Part I) showed 
that at steady state of 600 mg BID, 
rucaparib showed moderate inhibition 
of CYP1A2 (≥2 but <5-fold increase 
in AUC), mild inhibition of CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 (≥1.25 but 
<2-fold), and marginal inhibition of 
P-gp transporter (>1 but <1.25-fold 
increase in AUC). When co-
administering medicinal products 
metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2C9, 
CYP3A4, particularly medicines 
which have a narrow therapeutic 
index, dose adjustments may be 
considered based on appropriate 
clinical monitoring. Study CO-338-
095 (Part I) showed that rucaparib 
marginally increased Cmax of 
ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel 
(1.09- to 1.2-fold) and weakly 
increased the AUC0-last for both 
ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel to 
1.43- to 1.56-fold. 
Rucaparib is a potent inhibitor of 
MATE 1 and MATE2-K, a moderate 
inhibitor of OCT1, and a weak 
inhibitor of OCT2. As inhibition of 
these transporters could decrease 
metformin renal elimination and 
decrease liver uptake of metformin, 
caution is advised when metformin is 
co-administered with rucaparib. In 
addition, rucaparib is an inhibitor of 
the BCRP and Study CO-338-095 
(Part I) showed that rucaparib weakly 
increased the exposure to rosuvastatin 
(a BCRP substrate) up to 
approximately 1.29- to 1.35-fold as 
measured by Cmax, AUC0-last, and 
AUC0-inf . The clinical relevance of

UGT1A1 inhibition by rucaparib is 
not clear. Caution should be used 
when rucaparib is co-administered 
with UGT1A1 substrates (i.e. 
irinotecan) to patients with 
UGT1A1*28 (poor metabolizer) due 
to a possible increase in SN-38 
exposure and associated toxicities. 
Other Toxicity-related Information or Data 
•  Local tolerance 
The distribution of radioactivity following a single oral dose of 
[14C]-rucaparib in male pigmented Long-Evans rats was 
qualitatively similar to that in albino rats, with the exception of 
the uveal pigment of the eyes and the pigmented skin where a 
higher concentration of radioactivity was observed, suggesting 
an association of radioactive drug-related material with 
melanin. However, rucaparib was not found to be phototoxic 
in a study conducted in Long-Evans pigmented rats given 
rucaparib camsylate via oral gavage for 5 days at a dose of up 
to 750 mg/kg/day. 
Although phototoxicity was not 
observed in nonclinical studies, 
photosensitivity has been observed in 
patients treated with rucaparib 
(SmPC; Section 4.8). Appropriate 
warnings and precautions regarding 
spending time in direct sunlight and 
the use of protective clothing and 
sunscreen are provided in the SmPC 
(SmPC; Section 4.4). 
•  Secondary pharmacology 
Rucaparib demonstrated limited activity in radioligand binding 
assays against 39 receptors, ion channels, and transporters, as 
well as by functional enzymatic profiling against 530 wild 
type and mutant kinases. 
These results suggest rucaparib has a 
limited potential for off-target effects 
in humans. 
Based on the above it is evaluated that there are no safety issues that should warrant additional non-
clinical studies.

Part II: Module SIII - Clinical trial exposure   
Rucaparib has been developed as an antineoplastic agent. Nonclinical evaluation has demonstrated 
sensitivity of BRCA1 and BRCA2 homozygous mutant cell lines to rucaparib, which is attributed to 
PARP inhibition alone, and provides a rationale for the clinical assessment of rucaparib as monotherapy 
in patients with hereditary (germline) and acquired (somatic) deficiencies of BRCA1 and BRCA2. The 
rucaparib clinical development programme also identified patients without BRCA mutations who had 
benefit from rucaparib through examination of molecular tumour characteristics identified by next 
generation sequencing of tumour DNA. Rucaparib is the INN and United States Adopted Name (USAN) 
for CO-338 and is used to indicate the active moiety.

Exposure by Dose 
The dose of 600 mg BID rucaparib was selected as the appropriate starting dose for subsequent Phase 2 
and Phase 3 studies based on the overall PK, safety, and preliminary efficacy profile observed in the Phase 
1 dose-escalation portion of Study CO-338-010. 
In the Phase 1 dose-escalation portion (Part 1) of Study CO-338-010, the initial rucaparib dose level 
evaluated was 40 mg QD. Dose escalation in a standard 3+3 design was based on toxicities appearing in 
the initial 21-day treatment period. In total, 10 dose levels (40, 80, 160, 300, and 500 mg QD and 240, 
360, 480, 600, and 840 mg BID) were evaluated. Patients could then continue treatment with rucaparib in 
the optional treatment-extension period beyond Cycle 1. 
In the Phase 2 portion of Study CO-338-010, the starting dose of rucaparib was 600 mg BID, the RP2D 
determined from Phase 1 (Part 1) of the study.

Studies CO-338-010, CO-338-017, CO-338-014 (ARIEL3), CO-338-043 (ARIEL4), and CO-338-087 
(ATHENA-MONO) excluded the enrolment of patients with pre-existing moderate to severe hepatic or 
renal impairment. The inclusion criteria for Studies CO-338-010, CO-338-017, CO-338-014 (ARIEL3), 
and CO-338-043 (ARIEL4) specified that for hepatic function, AST and ALT ≤ 3 × upper limit of normal 
(ULN) (if liver metastases, then ≤ 5 × ULN) (AST and ALT ≤ 1.5 x ULN in ATHENA-MONO); and 
bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN (< 2 × ULN if hyperbilirubinaemia was due to Gilbert’s syndrome) were required. 
For renal function, serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN was specified. In accordance with the National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) Organ Dysfunction Working Group (ODWG) criteria,34 mild hepatic impairment is defined 
as AST > ULN with total bilirubin ≤ ULN or any AST level with total bilirubin > 1.0-1.5 × ULN. Renal 
impairment is defined according to European Medicines Agency (EMA)-specified renal impairment 
classifications: normal (creatinine clearance (CLcr ≥ 90 mL/min), mild (CLcr 60-89 mL/min), and 
moderate impairment (CLcr 30 to 59 mL/min). Study CO-338-078 (Part 1) included 8 patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment.

SIV.2  Limitations to detect adverse reactions in clinical trial development programmes 
In Studies CO-338-010 and CO-338-017, a total of 565 patients were exposed to rucaparib, in Study 
CO-338-014 (ARIEL3), a total of 372 were exposed to rucaparib, in Study CO-338-043 (ARIEL4), a total 
of 232 were exposed to rucaparib, and in Study CO-338-087 (ATHENA-MONO), a total of 425 patients 
were exposed to rucaparib.  
Overall, with exposure of a total of 1,594 patients, ADRs with a frequency of between 1/100 to 1/1000 (ie, 
uncommon) could be detected.   
Overall, in the Pooled Ovarian Cancer Safety Population (Studies CO-338-010, CO-338-017, CO-338-
014, CO-338-043, and CO-338-087 [ATHENA-MONO]), 368 (23.1%) patients who were exposed to 
rucaparib had a duration of exposure of at least 18 months corresponding to a person time of 552.0 years. 
A total of 243 (15.2%), 91 (5.7%), and 71 (4.5%) patients were exposed for at least 24, 30, and 36 months, 
respectively, corresponding to person time of 486.0, 227.5 and 213.0 years, respectively.

Population with relevant different ethnic origin 
In the Pooled Ovarian Cancer Safety Population, 108 
(6.8%) patients who were exposed to rucaparib had 
mild hepatic impairment. Patients with moderate 
(defined as any ALT/AST level and total bilirubin > 
1.5-3 × ULN) or severe hepatic impairment (defined as 
any ALT/AST level and total bilirubin > 3 × ULN) 
were not included in the clinical development. 
Study CO-338-078 (Part 1) included 8 patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment.  
Among the patients in the Pooled Ovarian Cancer 
Safety Population who received rucaparib, there were 
653 (41.0%) patients with no renal impairment, 656 
(41.2%) with mild renal impairment, and 285 (17.9%) 
with moderate renal impairment. No patients with 
severe renal impairment or on dialysis were enrolled in 
rucaparib trials.  
Not included in the clinical development programme 
In the Pooled Ovarian Cancer Safety Population, the 
majority of patients who were exposed to rucaparib 
were White (79.5%). The remaining patients were 
Other (11.5%) or Unknown (9.0%). 
Subpopulations carrying relevant genetic polymorphisms  CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 play a limited role in rucaparib

Part II: Module SV - Post-authorisation experience 
SV.1 Post-authorisation exposure 
SV.1.1  Method used to calculate exposure 
With the exception of EU, UK, Israel, and Switzerland commercial exposure data, patient exposure from 
marketing experience is presented by the number of individual patients exposed to Rubraca since the 
marketing authorisation was granted in the US on 19 December 2016. 
For EU territories, Israel, Switzerland, and the UK where Rubraca is commercially available, zr pharma& 
has entered into agreements with appointed contractual partners who directly distribute Rubraca to 
patients via a health care provider. In addition, Rubraca is distributed directly to wholesalers or health care 
providers and exposure data for individual patients is not available. Due to these methods of product 
distribution for Rubraca, the exposure data are limited to the amount (number of packs) of Rubraca 
provided to the contractual partners and does not include individual patients exposed to Rubraca. Due to 
this method of  distribution for Rubraca, the exposure data are limited to the amount (number of packs) of 
Rubraca provided to the contractual partners and does not include individual patients exposed to Rubraca. 
This contrasts with the US method of distribution, where Rubraca is provided to health care providers and 
their patients directly using an in-office dispensing pharmacy or a Specialty Pharmacy. As a result, EU 
and UK commercial Rubraca exposure has been calculated as treatment days. 
SV.1.2  Exposure 
Cumulative number of patients up to 19 December 2022 who have been exposed worldwide to Rubraca, 
as well as the number of “treatment days” within the

SVII.1.2 Risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP 
Important Identified Risk 1: Myelosuppression 
Risk-benefit impact: Myelosuppression was a common ADR; however, the rate of serious 
myelosuppression was low. Myelosuppression can be managed with routine medical care and/or dose 
interruption and/or dose reductions for more severe cases. The risk of myelosuppression can be serious 
and potentially life-threatening, and proper monitoring and treatment is required to minimise the risk of 
the consequences of myelosuppression and to ensure an acceptable risk-benefit balance. 
Important Identified Risk 2: Nausea and vomiting 
Risk-benefit impact: Nausea and vomiting were the most common ADR; however, the rate of serious 
nausea and vomiting was low. Nausea and vomiting can be managed with routine medical care and/or 
dose interruption and/or dose reductions or antiemetics for more severe cases. Nausea/vomiting for a 
prolonged duration can be a serious condition and it may result in malnutrition and electrolyte 
disturbances and thus proper treatment is required to minimise the risk and its consequences and to ensure 
an acceptable risk-benefit balance. 
Important Potential Risk 1: MDS/AML 
Risk-benefit impact: During clinical development, there were a few events of MDS/AML; however, there 
is insufficient scientific evidence to conclude that MDS and AML were causally related to rucaparib 
treatment. If MDS/AML is suspected, the patient should be referred to a haematologist for further 
investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sampling for cytogenetics. If, following 
investigation for prolonged haematological toxicity, MDS/AML is confirmed, Rubraca should be 
discontinued. This potential risk will be further evaluated in the post-marketing period.

EU-RMP/Part II/SVIII 
Missing information 4: Safety in patients with severe renal impairment 
Risk-benefit impact: Rucaparib has not been evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment. 
Rucaparib may only be used in patients with severe renal impairment if the benefit outweighs the potential 
risk, in which case the patient should be carefully monitored for renal function and adverse reactions. The 
risk of use in patients with severe renal impairment cannot be defined based on available evidence and 
thus the safety profile in this population will be derived from routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
Missing information 5: Safety in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment 
Risk-benefit impact: Rucaparib has not been evaluated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment. The risk of use in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment cannot be defined 
based on available evidence and thus the safety profile in this population will be derived from routine 
pharmacovigilance activities and a Phase 1, open-label, parallel-group study to determine the PK, safety 
and tolerability of rucaparib in patients with an advanced solid tumour and either moderate hepatic 
impairment or normal hepatic function (Study CO-338-078). 
Missing information 6: Characterisation of metabolites of rucaparib 
Risk-benefit impact: The metabolites of rucaparib are not fully known. The characterisation of rucaparib’s 
metabolites, and enzymes responsible for the metabolism is ongoing. The effect of strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors and inducers on rucaparib PK is not available.  
Missing information 7: DDI with oral contraceptives  
Risk-benefit impact: Interactions between rucaparib and oral contraceptives and BCRP substrates have not 
been studied. Results from Study CO-338-044 suggest that steady state rucaparib is likely to have a 
limited impact on the exposure of oral contraceptives. DDI with oral contraceptives cannot be defined 
based on available evidence. A Phase 1, open label, DDI study is planned to determine the impact of 
rucaparib on PK of oral contraceptives in female patients with advanced solid tumours (Study CO-338-
095 Arm B). 
Missing information 8: Efficacy and safety of rucaparib in patients previously treated with olaparib 
or another PARP inhibitor 
Risk-benefit impact: Patients who received prior treatment with a PARP inhibitor were excluded from the 
clinical development programme. Efficacy and safety of rucaparib in patients previously treated with 
olaparib or another PARP inhibitor cannot be defined based on available evidence and thus the safety 
profile in this population will be derived from routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
SVII.2  New safety concerns and reclassification with a submission of an updated RMP 
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) previously classified as an 
important potential risk is to be reclassified as important identified risk. In conclusion of 
PSUSA/00010694/202206 procedure, given that the risk is listed as an ADR in the SmPC and considering 
that MDS/AML is an identified risk in the RMPs for olaparib and niraparib, the MAH was recommended 
by PRAC to reclassify MDS/AML as an important identified risk.

Potential mechanisms: 
The mechanism(s) contributing to or driving the occurrence of secondary malignancies have not been 
identified. It is possible that DNA-repair deficiencies resulting from PARP inhibition and/or BRCA 
mutations may be involved; however, patients with relapsed ovarian cancer have typically been heavily 
pretreated with cytotoxic chemotherapy which makes it difficult to determine the causality of secondary 
malignancies. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
During clinical development, some events of MDS/AML were reported. However, there is insufficient 
scientific evidence to conclude that the cases of MDS and AML were causally related to rucaparib. 
MDS/AML is serious, potentially life-threatening and would require medical intervention and hence it 
is an important potential risk.  
Characterisation of the risk: 
Frequency 
Clinical (cumulative up to DLP of 30 May 2023) 
Analysis of events that occurred on or after rucaparib treatment and had an onset date on or prior to 30 
May 2023 showed that in a total of approximately 3,025 patients treated with oral rucaparib (includes 
the number of patients who received rucaparib in ongoing studies as well as completed studies, but 
excluding IITs), there were 38 patients (1.2%) who developed MDS or AML (including MDS 
transforming into AML), including long-term follow-up. These included: 
Study CO-338-010 (N=2): two patients with MDS;
•
• ARIEL3 (N=14): five patients with MDS, including refractory anaemia with excess blasts; five
patients AML, and four patients with MDS transforming into AML;
• ARIEL2 (N=7): five patients with MDS and two patients with AML;
• ARIEL4 (N=7): six patients with MDS and one patient with AML;
• ATHENA (N=8): two patients with MDS and two patients with AML in ATHENA-MONO and
two patients with MDS and two patients with AML in ATHENA-COMBO (treatment blinded).
For these 38 patients, the duration of rucaparib treatment prior to the diagnosis of MDS/AML ranged 
from 1.9 months to approximately 71.9 months. Fifteen patients (two patients from Study CO-338-010, 
two patients from ARIEL2, six patients from ARIEL3, three patients from ARIEL4, and two patients 
from ATHENA-MONO) had an event with an onset during treatment or during the 28-day safety follow 
up. 
Six placebo-treated patients in ARIEL3 developed MDS (n = 5) or AML (n = 1) more than 28 days 
after discontinuing placebo.

Important Identified Risk 1: Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) 
Events of MDS/AML were typically considered treatment related in patients who had received 
rucaparib, often due to the inability to rule out rucaparib as a contributing factor (due to temporal 
association or the knowledge of the occurrence of MDS/AML in other PARP inhibitor treated patients). 
However, causality assessment is confounded by factors such as history of prior platinum-based 
chemotherapy, also known to be associated with MDS/AML.  
All of the patients diagnosed with MDS or AML had received prior chemotherapy, and many patients 
received multiple platinum- and/or taxane-containing regimens. Treatment with chemotherapy could be 
considered an alternative aetiology to the events. 
Post-marketing experience (cumulative up to DLP of 30 May 2023) 
From the time of first launch of Rubraca in the US on 19 December 2016 to the DLP of 30 May 2023, 
there were 31 cases reporting 36 serious events that included 14 events of MDS, including one of MDS 
with excess blasts, and 13 events of AML. 
Severity and Nature of Risk:  
Depending on the subtype of MDS the disease can range from mild to severe. About a third of patients 
with MDS develop AML. Based on the International Prognostic Scoring System median survival ranges 
from 5 months to 5.7 years.49 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
Therapy-related myeloid leukaemia and MDS are recognised complications of cytotoxic therapy.27 
Therapy-related leukaemia is a complication of chemoradiotherapy used to treat a variety of primary 
malignancies including ovarian cancer.50 Travis et al reported a case-control study of secondary 
leukaemia in a population-based cohort in North America and Europe. Between 1980 and 1993, 28,971 
patients with invasive ovarian cancer were followed.28 It was concluded that platinum-based treatment 
increases the risk of secondary leukaemia in patients with ovarian cancer. Among the patients who 
received platinum-based combination chemotherapy, the relative risk (RR) of leukaemia was 4.0 (95% 
CI, 1.4-11.4). 
In a Danish study of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer cases between 2000 and 2011, any other 
concomitant cancer was the most prevalent co-morbidity, registered in 7.9% (121) of the ovarian cancer 
patients.22 
In the placebo arm of a randomised, Phase 3 maintenance study of niraparib in patients who had 
received two or more previous lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy, MDS/AML occurred in 1.2% of 
patients.51,52 
The majority of patients with AML and MDS are elderly. Based on data from the Haematological 
Malignancy Research Network, in a cohort of patients with a newly diagnosed haematological 
malignancy, between 2004 and 2009, the median age at diagnosis for AML and MDS was 68.7 and 
76.1 years, respectively. These diseases are more common in men. The sex-rate ratio (male/female) for 
AML and MDS was 1.25 (95% CI, 1.07–1.45) and 2.09 (95% CI, 1.78–2.48), respectively.53 
Obesity is a risk factor for AML. In a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies, seven studies 
reported on the correlation between AML and body mass index (BMI). Obesity was associated with a 
significantly increased incidence of AML (RR = 1.53; 95% CI, 1.26–1.85; p < 0.001).54 
There were 5 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) leading to death in the tBRCA population 
treated with rucaparib. Of these, 4 occurred in the gBRCA group and 1 occurred in a patient for whom 
the germline/somatic status was unknown. Three of these TEAEs were assessed as not related to 
rucaparib, including 2 of the TEAEs (malignant neoplasm progression [n=1] and cardiac arrest [n=1]) 
within the germline subgroup and 1 TEAE (histiocytosis haematophagic) within the germline/somatic 
unknown group.   
Within the gBRCA group, there were TEAEs of AML and MDS that led to death (n=1 each). Both 
patients had received multiple regimens and cycles of prior chemotherapy, including platinum- and/or 
taxane-containing regimens.   
While there appeared to be a difference within the gBRCA population as compared to those with 
somatic or unknown germline/somatic BRCA status, the TEAEs leading to death were either assessed

EU-RMP/Part II/SVIII 
Important Identified Risk 1: Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) 
as unrelated to rucaparib or, for the TEAEs of MDS and AML, the causality was confounded by the 
exposure to prior chemotherapy. Despite the very small number of patients involved, it remains 
possible/plausible that patients with gBRCA mutations are more likely to develop (fatal) 
haematological malignancies.  
Preventability: 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC advises that MDS/AML, including cases with fatal outcome, have been 
reported in patients who received rucaparib. The duration of therapy with rucaparib in patients who 
developed MDS/AML varied from < 2 months to approximately 6 years. If MDS/AML is suspected, the 
patient should be referred to a haematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis 
and blood sampling for cytogenetics. If, following investigation for prolonged haematological toxicity, 
MDS/AML is confirmed, Rubraca should be discontinued.  
Section 4.8 of the SmPC advises that MDS/AML are serious adverse reactions that occur uncommonly 
(0.5%) in patients on treatment and during the 28-day safety follow up, and commonly (1.1%) for all 
patients including during the long-term safety follow up (rate is calculated based on overall safety 
population of 3,025 patients exposed to at least one dose of oral rucaparib in all clinical studies). In the 
placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies, ARIEL3 and ATHENA-MONO, the incidence of MDS/AML 
during therapy in patients who received rucaparib was 1.6% and 0.5%, respectively. Although no cases 
were reported during therapy in patients who received placebo, six cases have been reported in placebo-
treated patients during the long-term safety follow up. All patients had potential contributing factors for 
the development of MDS/AML; in all cases, patients had received previous platinum-containing 
chemotherapy regimens and/or other DNA damaging agents.   
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities will further characterise the risk of MDS/AML with respect to 
number of reports, seriousness, outcome, and risk factors and that the data are consistent with the 
information already known for this risk.   
Routine risk minimisation will be used to communicate information regarding this potential risk.  
Public health impact: 
Minimal impact due to the rarity of the risk. 
Important Potential Risk 1: New primary malignancy 
MedDRA Terms: System organ class (SOC) of Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified 
(including cysts and polyps) 
Potential mechanisms: 
The increased concentration of DNA damage marker in tissues of patients treated with PARP inhibitors 
implies an accumulation of double strand breaks in normal tissues that could lead to an increased risk of 
cancer secondary to DNA damage. 55 PARP inhibition impairs the ability of cells to repair DNA single 
strand breaks and, in cells that have a deficient homologous recombination pathway, this leads to the 
accumulation of un-repaired double strand breaks that eventually cause the death of the target cell. 
Although normal cells are expected to repair the double strand breaks induced by inhibiting PARP, 
there is a risk of increased breaks in all dividing cells which may contribute to development of new 
primary malignancies. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
Secondary malignancy is consistent with the known outcomes of immunosuppression resulting from 
chemotherapy. During clinical development, some events of new primary malignancy were reported. 
However, these events were either deemed not related to rucaparib or there were confounding factors 
such as other chemotherapy agents. New primary malignancy is serious, potentially life-threatening and 
would require medical intervention and hence it is an important potential risk.

Post-marketing experience (cumulative up to DLP of 30 May 2023) 
From the time of first launch of Rubraca in the US on 19 December 2016 to the DLP of 30 May 2023, 
there were 40 cases that reported events of possible new malignancies including Neoplasm malignant 
(N=4), Leukaemia (N=4), Breast cancer (N=3), Brain neoplasm (N = 3) Hepatic neoplasm (N=2), 
Neoplasm (N=2), Malignant melanoma (N=2), Bladder cancer (N = 2) and Basal cell carcinoma (N=2). 
The following events were reported once: Adenocarcinoma of colon, Brain neoplasm, Pelvic neoplasm, 
Squamous cell carcinoma of lung, Breast neoplasm, Colon cancer , GI neoplasm, Squamous cell 
carcinoma, Vaginal neoplasm, Squamous cell carcinoma of skin, Abdominal neoplasm, Lymphoma, 
Lung neoplasm malignant, Lip and/or oral cavity cancer, Thyroid cancer and Papillary thyroid cancer. 
A paucity of data makes it difficult to determine in some of the cases whether a secondary malignancy 
or progression of underlying malignancy was being described. 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
Prior DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs represents a risk factor for development of new 
malignancies.55  
Preventability: 
None proposed 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities will further characterise the risk of new primary malignancy with 
respect to number of reports, seriousness, outcome, and risk factors and whether experience in the post 
marketing setting is consistent with the information already known for this risk from clinical trial data.  
Routine risk minimisation will be used to communicate information regarding this potential risk. 
Public health impact: 
Minimal impact due to the rarity of the risk. 
Important Potential Risk 2: QTc interval prolongation 
MedDRA Terms: Standardised MedDRA Queries (SMQ) was Torsade de Points/QT prolongation 
Potential mechanisms: 
HERG potassium channels allow the rapid component of myocardial repolarisation; when a drug 
interferes with their function, the potassium inflow decreases leading to prolongation of repolarisation. 
In the hERG assay, rucaparib had an IC50 value that was approximately 13-fold higher than the unbound 
Cmax of 1.79 µM in patients treated with 600 mg BID rucaparib. 
Page 47 of 80 
Rucaparib 
zr pharma& 
EU-RMP/Part II/SVIII 
Important Potential Risk 2: QTc interval prolongation 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
In vitro studies showed that rucaparib at high concentrations may interfere with the activity of the 
hERG potassium channels and thus has the potential to induce QTc interval prolongation. An open-
label single-arm study in 56 patients showed that a clinically significant QTcF increase (ie > 20 msec) 
over baseline is unlikely following administration of 600 mg BID rucaparib. During clinical 
development, there were a few events that were associated with the QT prolongation but all were 
confounded by other factors. QTc interval prolongation is serious, potentially life-threatening event and 
hence it is an important potential risk.   
Characterisation of the risk:

Post-marketing experience (cumulative up to DLP of 30 May 2023) 
From the time of first launch of Rubraca in the US on 19 December 2016 to the DLP of 30 May 2023, 
there were 35 (33 serious and two non-serious) cases that reported 37 events of interest including Loss 
of consciousness (N=19), Syncope (N=12), Electrocardiogram QT prolonged (N=3), Cardiac arrest

Important Potential Risk 2: QTc interval prolongation 
(N=1), Ventricular tachycardia (N=1) and Cardio-respiratory arrest (N=1). Events of Loss of 
consciousness, Syncope, Cardiac arrest, Ventricular tachycardia, and Cardio-respiratory arrest had 
numerous alternative causes and there was no evidence for an association with QTc prolongation. The 
review of post marketing safety data has not raised any additional safety concerns. 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
Patients with certain congenital and or acquired cardiac abnormalities may be at risk of QTc 
prolongation. Additionally, factors that predispose to QT prolongation and higher risk of torsades de 
pointes include older age, female sex, low left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular hypertrophy, 
ischemia, slow hear rate, and electrolyte abnormalities including hypokalaemia and hypomagnesemia. 
Certain drugs also predispose to QT prolongation.56 
Preventability: 
None 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities will further characterise the risk of QTc interval prolongation with 
respect to number of reports, seriousness, outcome, and risk factors and whether experience in the post 
marketing setting is consistent with the information already known for this risk from clinical trial data.   
Routine risk minimisation will be used to communicate information regarding this potential risk. 
Public health impact: 
Minimal impact due to the rarity of the risk. 
Important Potential Risk 3: Embryotoxicity and teratogenicity 
MedDRA Terms: SOC Pregnancy, Puerperium and Perinatal 
Potential mechanisms: 
PARPs promote the repair of DNA single-strand breaks and coordinate cellular responses to stress. 
Mice deficient for PARP1 or PARP2 are hypersensitive to γ-irradiation and alkylating agents, and 
demonstrate increased genomic instability with elevated sister chromatid exchanges. Parp1-/- and Parp2-
/- mice are viable, however, Parp1-/- Parp2-/- double mutant mice die early in embryogenesis, 
demonstrating the essential requirement for nuclear poly- ADP-ribosylation during embryogenesis.58 
Effective PARP inhibition with olaparib and veliparib induce genomic instability in all human cells 
examined, resulting in a marked increase of sister chromatid exchanges frequencies and chromatid-type 
aberrations.59 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
There were no reports of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity during clinical development. 
Characterisation of the risk:

Risk factors and risk groups: 
Not applicable 
Preventability: 
Rubraca can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism of 
action and findings from animal studies. In an animal reproduction study, administration of rucaparib to 
pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryo-foetal toxicity at exposures below 
those in patients receiving the recommended human dose of 600 mg BID (SmPC; Section 4.4). 
Pregnancy/contraception 
Pregnant women should be informed of the potential risk to a foetus. Women of reproductive potential 
should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last 
dose of Rubraca. A pregnancy test before initiating treatment is recommended in women of 
reproductive potential (SmPC; Section 4.4).

EU-RMP/Part II/SVIII 
Important Potential Risk 3: Embryotoxicity and teratogenicity 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving 
rucaparib. Patients should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months 
following the last dose of rucaparib. A pregnancy test before initiating treatment is recommended in 
women of reproductive potential (SmPC; Section 4.6). 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited data from the use of rucaparib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity. Based on its mechanism of action and preclinical data, rucaparib may 
cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rubraca should not be used during 
pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with rucaparib (SmPC; Section 
4.6). 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities will further characterise the risk of embryotoxicity and 
teratogenicity with respect to number of reports, seriousness, outcome, and risk factors. Routine risk 
minimisation will be used to communicate information regarding this potential risk. 
Public health impact: 
There are limited data on the effects of rucaparib on pregnancy outcomes and embryofoetal toxicity and 
hence limited ability to assess public health impact. 
SVII.3.2 Presentation of the missing information 
Missing information 1: Safety in patients with severe renal impairment 
Evidence source: 
Rucaparib has not been evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment or patients on dialysis. 
Clinical (cumulative up to DLP of 30 May 2023) 
Cumulatively, there were three serious case that could be identified as use in patients with medical 
history of severe renal impairment, which was retrieved from clinical trials sponsored by zr pharma&. 
Post-marketing experience (cumulative up to DLP of 30 May 2023) 
Cumulatively, there were six cases that could be identified as use in patients with medical history of 
severe renal impairment retrieved from post-marketing data. Examination of the cumulative information 
does not modify the current knowledge regarding this missing information and examination of future 
data is still required. 
Population in need of further characterisation: 
The risk of use in patients with severe renal impairment or patients on dialysis cannot be defined based 
on available evidence and thus the safety profile in this population will be derived from routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
Missing information 2: Safety in patients with moderate hepatic impairment 
Evidence source: 
Clinical (cumulative up to DLP of 30 May 2023) 
Patients with moderate hepatic impairment enrolled in Study CO-338-078 (Part 1) reported a higher 
incidence of TEAEs and a higher incidence of events with higher toxicity grades compared to those 
patients with normal hepatic function. Due to the small sample size and as the safety data were 
collected following a single dose of rucaparib, the interpretation of the results as related to the safety 
profile of rucaparib in patients with moderate hepatic impairment is limited. 
Post-marketing experience (cumulative up to DLP of 30 May 2023) 
Cumulatively, there were no cases that could be identified as use of Rubraca in patients with medical 
history of moderate hepatic impairment (defined as 7 ≤ Child-Pugh score ≥ 9). 
Population in need of further characterisation:

EU-RMP/Part VI 
Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan  
Summary of risk management plan for Rubraca (Rucaparib) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Rubraca. The RMP details important risks of 
Rubraca, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about 
Rubraca’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Rubraca's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential information 
to healthcare professionals and patients on how Rubraca should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Rubraca should be read in the context of all this information including the 
assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the European 
Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Rubraca's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Rubraca is indicated as: 
• monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced (FIGO Stages III
and IV) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response
(complete or partial) to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.
• monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed
high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response
(complete or partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy. It contains rucaparib as the active
substance and it is given by oral administration.
Further information about the evaluation of Rubraca’s benefits can be found in Rubraca’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage 
( https://www.ema.europa.eu/medicines/human/EPAR/rubraca). 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further
characterise the risks
Important risks of Rubraca, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for 
learning more about Rubraca's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•
•
•
•
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the
medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) assessment so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Rubraca is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Rubraca are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate 
or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a 
link with the use of Rubraca. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal 
product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks
Important identified risk 1: Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/Acute myeloid leukaemia 
(AML) 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
During clinical development, some events of MDS/AML were 
reported. However, there is insufficient scientific evidence to 
conclude that the cases of MDS and AML were causally related to 
rucaparib. MDS/AML is serious, potentially life-threatening and 
would require medical intervention and hence it is an important 
potential risk.  
Therapy-related myeloid leukaemia and MDS are recognised clinical 
syndromes, which are complications of cytotoxic therapy.27 Therapy-
related leukaemia is a complication of chemoradiotherapy used to 
treat a variety of primary malignancies including ovarian cancer.50 
Travis et al reported a case-control study of secondary leukaemia in 
a population-based cohort in North America and Europe. Between 
1980 and 1993, 28,971 patients with invasive ovarian cancer were 
followed.28 It was concluded that platinum-based treatment 
increases the risk of secondary leukaemia in patients with ovarian 
cancer. Among the patients who received platinum-based 
combination chemotherapy, the RR of leukaemia was 4.0 (95% CI, 
1.4-11.4). 
In a Danish study of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer cases between 
2000 and 2011, any other concomitant cancer was the most 
prevalent co-morbidity, registered in 7.9% (121) of the ovarian 
cancer patients.22 
Recently, in the placebo arm of a randomised, Phase 3 maintenance 
study of niraparib in patients who had received two or more previous 
lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy, MDS/AML occurred in 1.2% of 
patients.51,52 
The majority of patients with AML and MDS are elderly. Based on 
data from the Haematological Malignancy Research Network, in a 
cohort of patients with a newly diagnosed haematological 
malignancy, between 2004 and 2009, the median age at diagnosis 
for AML and MDS was 68.7 and 76.1 years, respectively. These 
diseases are more common in men. The sex-rate ratio 
(male/female) for AML and MDS was 1.25 (95% CI, 1.07–1.45) and 
2.09 (95% CI, 1.78–2.48), respectively.53 
Obesity is a risk factor for AML. In a meta-analysis of prospective 
cohort studies, seven studies reported on the correlation between 
AML and BMI. Obesity was associated with a significantly increased 
incidence of AML (RR = 1.53; 95% CI, 1.26–1.85; p < 0.001).54 
There were 5 TEAEs leading to death in the tBRCA population 
treated with rucaparib. Of these, 4 occurred in the gBRCA group and 
1 occurred in a patient for whom the germline/somatic status was 
unknown. Three of these TEAEs were assessed as not related to 
rucaparib, including 2 of the TEAEs within the germline subgroup 
(malignant neoplasm progression [n=1] and cardiac arrest [n=1]) 
and 1 within the germline/somatic unknown group (histiocytosis 
haematophagic).  
Within the gBRCA group, there were TEAEs of AML and MDS that led 
to death (n=1 each). Both patients had received multiple regimens 
Page 59 of 80 
Rucaparib 
zr pharma& 
EU-RMP/Part VI 
and cycles of prior chemotherapy, including platinum- and/or 
taxane-containing regimens.  
While there appeared to be a difference within the gBRCA population 
as compared to those with somatic or unknown germline/somatic 
BRCA status, the TEAEs leading to death were either assessed as 
unrelated to rucaparib or, for the TEAEs of MDS and AML, the 
causality was confounded by the exposure to prior chemotherapy. 
Despite the very small number of patients involved, it remains 
possible/plausible that patients with gBRCA mutations are more 
likely to develop (fatal) haematological malignancies.

Important potential risk 1: New primary malignancy 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Secondary malignancy is consistent with the known outcomes of 
immunosuppression resulting from chemotherapy. During clinical 
development, some events of new primary malignancy were 
reported. However, these events were either deemed not related to 
rucaparib or there were confounding factors such as other 
chemotherapy agents. New primary malignancy is serious, 
potentially life-threatening and would require medical intervention 
and hence it is an important potential risk.  
Prior DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs represents a risk factor 
for development of new malignancies. 55

Important potential risk 2: QTc interval prolongation 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
In vitro studies showed that rucaparib at high concentrations may 
interfere with the activity of the hERG potassium channels and thus 
has the potential to induce QTc interval prolongation. An open-label 
single-arm study in 56 patients showed that a clinically significant 
QTcF increase (ie > 20 msec) over baseline is unlikely following 
administration of 600 mg BID rucaparib. During clinical 
development, there were a few events that were associated with the 
QT prolongation but all were confounded by other factors. QTc 
interval prolongation is serious, potentially life-threatening event 
and hence it is an important potential risk.  
Patients with certain congenital and or acquired cardiac 
abnormalities may be at risk of QTc prolongation. Additionally, 
factors that predispose to QT prolongation and higher risk of 
torsades de pointes include older age, female sex, low left 
ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular hypertrophy, ischaemia, 
slow hear rate, and electrolyte abnormalities including hypokalaemia 
and hypomagnesemia. Certain drugs also predispose to QT 
prolongation. 56

Epidemiology  
Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynaecological cancers in the US and Europe, ranking 
as the fifth most common cause of cancer death in women (American Cancer Society 2019, Ferlay et al 
2013). In 2019, it is estimated that there will be 22,530 newly diagnosed ovarian cancer cases in the US 
and approximately 13,980 women will die from ovarian cancer (American Cancer Society 2019). Across 
Europe, the estimated age standardised rate of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer cases in 2020 is 
15.5/100,000 and the mortality is 10.3/100,000 (ECIS 2020).  
The disease is predominantly diagnosed in post-menopausal women over 50 years of age (>80%) and the 
aetiology is unknown although family history and a woman’s reproductive history are important risk factors 
(Ledermann  et  al  2013).  Family  history  (patients  having  2  or  more  first  degree  relatives  with  ovarian 
cancer) including linkage BRCA1 and BRCA2 genotypes is associated with early-onset disease. 
Ovarian cancer remains one of the most difficult cancers to diagnose at an early curable stage; 75% of 
patients present with advanced disease at initial diagnosis (Stage III or IV) (Hennessy et al 2009). Most 
patients die from their disease, with 5-year survival rates of only 29% for advanced stages (American 
Cancer Society 2019, Siegel et al 2019).  
Biologic features 
More than 90% of malignant ovarian tumours are of epithelial origin, designated epithelial ovarian cancer 
(EOC). The most common and most lethal EOC is high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). 
High grade epithelial ovarian cancers have two principal phenotypic characteristics that suggests PARP 
inhibitor sensitivity. Firstly, epithelial ovarian cancers are highly responsive to platinum-based 
chemotherapy. Underpinned by a similar dependence on HRR for the repair of platinum-induced DNA 
damage, in the relapsed setting, platinum sensitivity has been demonstrated as a useful biomarker of 
PARP inhibitor sensitivity (Gelmon et al 2011, Ledermann et al 2012). Secondly, using known measures 
of HRR-deficiency, approximately 50% of high grade serous ovarian cancers are expected to be HRR-
deficient at diagnosis (Konstantinopoulos et al 2015). HRR-deficiency in ovarian tumours can arise 
through a number of different mechanisms including loss of function mutations in genes that encode 
proteins with essential roles in HRR (including BRCA1 and BRCA2) as well as epigenetic silencing of HRR 
genes (Kondrashova et al 2018).  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Ovarian  cancer  is  often  asymptomatic  in  the  early  stages  and  is,  therefore,  first  detected  in  advanced 
stages,  when  prognosis  is  poor.  For  women  who  do  experience  symptoms  in  the  early  stages,  ovarian 
cancer  is  sometimes  misdiagnosed  because  the  majority  of  symptoms  are  nonspecific.  These  symptoms 
may overlap those of gastrointestinal and other diseases, and as a result, many patients may be treated 
incorrectly for months or years. 
The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate in advanced ovarian cancer patients decreases from 42% for Stage 
IIIA, 32% for Stage IIIC, and 19% for Stage IV. 
Management 
Cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy are considered treatments of choice for patients 
with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer (NCCN Ovarian 2019, Karam et al 2017, Ledermann et al 
2013). Even though most newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer patients achieve complete response 
Assessment report  
EMA/523504/2020 
Page 11/150 
 
 
  
  
at the end of first line treatment, approximately 70% relapse within the first three years of diagnosis 
(Ledermann et al 2013). Once ovarian cancer relapses, the disease becomes largely incurable.  
The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor bevacizumab, given in combination with 
carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by bevacizumab as maintenance, is the first biological treatment to be 
approved in the first line ovarian cancer treatment setting. The approval of bevacizumab in EU was based 
on the primary analysis of the GOG-0218 (Bevacizumab SmPC 2018, Burger et al 2011) and ICON7 
(BO17707) (Perren et al 2011, Oza et al 2015) studies.  
Most recently, results of the SOLO1 trial led to the approval of olaparib as first targeted maintenance 
treatment for newly diagnosed advanced BRCAm ovarian cancer patients in the EU in June 2019. The 
results from SOLO1 demonstrated a substantial 70% reduction in risk of disease progression or death (HR 
0.30; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.41). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Olaparib,  is  a  potent  oral  human  PARP  inhibitor  that  exploits  deficiencies  in  DNA  repair  pathways  to 
preferentially  target  cancer  cells  carrying  such  deficiencies.  Dysfunctional  HRR  in  tumour  cells  results  in 
reliance  on  error-prone  repair  pathways,  leading  to  an  accumulation  of  DNA  damage  and  cell  death  in 
tumour cells. 
Lynparza is approved in EU for the treatment of ovarian cancer, breast cancer and adenocarcinoma of the 
pancreas. 
Lynparza presented as tablet formulation is currently indicated in the following indications for the treatment 
of ovarian cancer: 
-As monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced (FIGO stages III and IV) 
BRCA1/2-  mutated  (germline  and/or  somatic)  high-grade  epithelial  ovarian,  fallopian  tube  or  primary 
peritoneal  cancer  who  are  in  response  (complete  or  partial)  following  completion  of  first-line  platinum-
based chemotherapy. 
-As monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high-
grade  epithelial  ovarian,  fallopian  tube,  or  primary  peritoneal  cancer  who  are  in  response  (complete  or 
partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The recommended dose of Lynparza in monotherapy is 300 mg (two 150 mg tablets) taken twice daily, 
equivalent to a total daily dose of 600 mg. The 100 mg tablet is available for dose reduction. 
The  initially  claimed  indication  was  for  olaparib  (300  mg  twice  daily  [bd],  tablet  formulation)  for  the 
following indication: 
“Lynparza in combination with bevacizumab for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced 
(FIGO stages III and IV) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are 
in  response  (complete  or  partial)  following  completion  of  first-line  platinum-based  chemotherapy  with 
bevacizumab”. 
Pre-clinical data have suggested a potential clinical synergistic benefit may be achieved when combining 
VEGF and PARP inhibitors, as there have been multiple observations around the impact of hypoxia on cell 
stress, including the DNA damage response and specifically inhibition of HRR.  
The clinical rationale for investigating the role of the combination of olaparib/bevacizumab in the PAOLA-1 
trial was based on available non-clinical and clinical data to combine two effective targeted treatments in 
ovarian  cancer  after  completion  of  platinum  based  chemotherapy,  in  the  first  line  maintenance  setting 
Assessment report  
EMA/523504/2020 
Page 12/150 
 
 
  
  
where  improvement  in  clinical  outcomes  can  be  most  impactful  to  patients  with  significant  delay  in 
progression and relapse and potentially improvement in cure rates. 
The recommended indication by CHMP is as follows:  
Lynparza in combination with bevacizumab is indicated for the: 
•  maintenance  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  advanced  (FIGO  stages  III  and  IV)  high-grade 
epithelial  ovarian,  fallopian  tube  or  primary  peritoneal  cancer  who  are  in  response  (complete  or 
partial)  following  completion  of  first-line  platinum-based  chemotherapy  in  combination  with 
bevacizumab  and  whose  cancer  is  associated  with  homologous  recombination  deficiency  (HRD) 
positive status defined by either a BRCA1/2 mutation and/or genomic instability (see section 5.1). 
Before Lynparza with bevacizumab treatment is initiated for the first-line maintenance treatment of EOC, 
FTC  or  PPC,  patients  must  have  confirmation  of  either  deleterious  or  suspected  deleterious  BRCA1/2 
mutation and/or genomic instability determined using a validated test. 
The  recommended  dose  of  Lynparza  in  combination  with  bevacizumab  is  300 mg  (two  150 mg  tablets) 
taken  twice  daily,  equivalent  to  a  total  daily  dose  of  600 mg.  The  100 mg  tablet  is  available  for  dose 
reduction. 
When Lynparza is used in combination with bevacizumab for the first-line maintenance treatment of high-
grade  epithelial  ovarian,  fallopian  tube,  or  primary  peritoneal  cancer  following  completion  of  first-line 
platinum-based  therapy  with  bevacizumab,  the  dose  of  bevacizumab  is  15  mg/kg  once  every  3  weeks. 
Please refer to the full product information for bevacizumab (see section 5.1). 
Patients can continue treatment with Lynparza until radiological disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity or for up to 2 years if there is no radiological evidence of disease after 2 years of treatment. 
Patients with evidence of disease at 2 years, who in the opinion of the treating physician can derive 
further benefit from continuous Lynparza treatment, can be treated beyond 2 years. Please refer to the 
product information for bevacizumab for the recommended overall duration of treatment of a maximum 
of 15 months including the periods in combination with chemotherapy and as maintenance (see section 
5.1). 
Detection of BRCA1/2 mutations 
Genetic testing should be conducted by an experienced laboratory using a validated test. Local or central 
testing of blood and/or tumour samples for germline and/or somatic BRCA1/2 mutations have been used 
in different studies. DNA obtained from a tissue or blood sample has been tested in most of the studies, 
with testing of ctDNA being used for exploratory purposes. Depending on the test used and the 
international classification consensus, the BRCA1/2 mutations have been classified as 
deleterious/suspected deleterious or pathogenic/likely pathogenic. Homologous recombination deficiency 
(HRD) positive status can be defined by detection of a BRCA1/2 mutation classified as 
deleterious/suspected deleterious or pathogenic/likely pathogenic. Detection of these mutations could be 
combined with positive HRD score (below) to determine HRD positive status. 
Detection of genomic instability 
HR deficiency-associated genomic alterations that have been investigated in Paola-1 include genome-wide 
loss of heterozygosity, telomeric allelic imbalance and large scale transition, which are continuous 
measures with pre-defined criteria and score. Composite genomic instability score (GIS, also called HRD 
score) is determined when the combined measures and respective scores are used to assess the extent of 
specific genomic aberrations accumulated in tumour cells. Lower score defines lower likelihood of HR 
deficiency of tumour cells and higher score determines higher likelihood of HR deficiency of tumour cells

at the time of the sample collection relative to exposure to DNA damaging agents. Validated cut-offs 
should be used to determine GIS positive status.   
HRD positive status can be defined by a composite GIS score for HR deficiency-associated genomic 
alterations tested by an experienced laboratory using a validated test. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The risk of an adverse environmental impact from the use of the drug substance olaparib has already been 
evaluated  and  approved  by  the  EMA  (EMEA/H/C/003726).  The  present  submission  seeks  approval  for  a 
change to the ovarian cancer indication, to register Lynparza, in combination with bevacizumab, for the 
maintenance  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  advanced,  high-grade  epithelial  ovarian,  fallopian  tube  or 
primary  peritoneal  cancer  who  are  in  response  (complete  response  or  partial  response)  to  first  line 
platinum-based chemotherapy with bevacizumab. 
Although  the  indication  has  been  amended,  potentially  increasing  the  patient  population  contributing  to 
environmental exposure, the dose has not changed, and the indication and patient population used in the 
original  environmental  risk  assessment  (ovarian  cancer)  is  considered  sufficiently  broad  to  cover  the 
proposed indication change for this variation. The approval of this variation will have no significant effect 
on the predicted environmental exposure concentration presented in the original indication. Therefore, in 
accordance with the European Medicines Agency guidance (CHMP 2006 and CHMP 2016), an environmental 
risk assessment for olaparib has not been provided with this variation. 
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. Both olaparib and bevacizumab have an indication in the first line maintenance treatment of 
ovarian cancer patients. The contribution of olaparib in the combination is assessed as add-on therapy to 
bevacizumab used in both arms concurrently with chemotherapy and in maintenance setting as indicated 
in the SmPC. 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of olaparib.  
Considering the above data, olaparib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
The  proposed  application  is  mainly  based  on  data  from  the  pivotal  study,  PAOLA-1.  In  addition  to  the 
original package, one additional phase I clinical study (study D0810C00022) has been submitted to support 
the proposed indication with the aim to assess the safety and tolerability of olaparib in combination with 
bevacizumab and to compare exposure to olaparib when given alone and in combination with bevacizumab. 
Main PK properties of olaparib (ADME) 
Olaparib  is  a  biopharmaceutics  classification  system  class  IV  compound  possessing  low  solubility  and 
moderate permeability. The commercial tablet dose and strengths are 2 x 150 mg tablets for 300 mg bd 
with the 100 mg strength tablet available to support dose reductions. It is also recommended that olaparib 
tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, crushed, dissolved or divided. 
PK parameters associated with rich PK sampling data, fasting conditions, olaparib as monotherapy and in 
normal renal and hepatic function groups are summarized below. 
• 
Olaparib  was  rapidly  absorbed  following  oral  dosing  in  fasting  conditions,  with  peak  plasma 
concentrations observed typically after 1.5 hours post-dose and declined in a biphasic manner. After 300 
mg single dose, the arithmetic mean values of elimination half-life (t1/2) and apparent clearance (CL/F) 
were respectively 14.9 hours (SD of 8.2 hours) and 7.40 L/h (SD of 3.9 L/h). The pooled tablet population 
PK analyses characterised the absorption phase of olaparib as a sequential zero- and first-order absorption 
and showed a significant impact of olaparib tablet strength on the absorption rate constant. 
• 
Co-administration  of  olaparib  tablet  formulation  with  a  high  fat  meal  showed minimal  impact  on 
AUC (8% increase), the observed effect was a result of decrease in absorption rate: olaparib median time 
to reach maximum concentration (tmax) was 4 hours and mean Cmax was reduced by 21% compared to 
fasted  data.  These  changes  are  not  considered  to  be  clinically  relevant,  therefore  the  olaparib  tablet 
formulation can be given with or without food. 
• 
Olaparib exhibited a high apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of 158 L (SD of 136). The plasma 
protein binding in vitro was moderate (81.9% at clinically relevant concentrations of 10 μg/mL). 
Assessment report  
EMA/523504/2020 
Page 16/150 
 
 
  
  
 
• 
Following  single  dosing,  exposure,  measured  by  the  area  under  the  plasma  concentration-time 
curve (AUC), increased approximately proportionally with dose for the tablet single dose range 25 to 450 
mg; maximum observed plasma concentration of olaparib (Cmax) increased slightly less than proportionally 
for the same dose range. 
• 
Following a single 100 mg dose of radiolabelled olaparib capsule, unchanged olaparib and oxidised 
metabolites were detected in plasma, urine and faeces. Metabolite profiles of plasma indicated that olaparib 
was  the  major  component  (70%  of  the  circulating  radioactivity).  There  were  three  major  drug  derived 
components  in  plasma  M12  (AZ14102299,  ring-open  piperazin-3-ol),  M15  (AZ14102296,  4-fluorophenol 
(hydroxy)methyl) and M18 (AZ14102567, piperazin-3-ol); each of them accounted for 9-14% of the plasma 
radioactivity. Drug-related material was eliminated in the urine (44% mean recovery) and in the faeces 
(42% mean recovery), predominantly as metabolites. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Exposure, measured by area under plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUC), increased 
approximately proportionally with dose for the single dose tablet range 25 to 450 mg; maximum plasma 
concentration (Cmax) increased slightly less than proportionally for the same dose range.  
Following bd dosing, an AUC mean accumulation ratio of 1.8 was observed at steady state. At the 300 mg 
bd  dose,  olaparib  PK  appeared  to  be  time  dependent,  with  mean  temporal  change  parameter  (TCP 
calculated as AUC during the dosing interval at steady state [AUCss]/AUC single dose) of 1.53 (SD 0.59). 
Special populations 
The key observations related to the intrinsic factors impacting olaparib PK are summarised below.  
• 
The latest population PK analysis pooling PK data from studies with the tablet formulation did not 
identify  gender,  race,  tumour  location,  age  or  body  weight  as  significant  covariates  (Olaparib-MS-08). 
BRCA1/2 status was not identified as a significant covariate either, but there were 36% of missing values 
for this covariate. In addition, no race difference in the PK of olaparib was shown from the phase I Japanese 
PK studies with the tablet or capsule formulations (respectively D081BC00001 and D0810C00001 [Study 
01]) or from the phase I Chinese PK study using the tablet formulation (D081BC00002). Therefore, dose 
adjustment based on race, gender, age or body weight is not required. The PK of olaparib in prostate cancer 
patients was similar to other cancer patients supporting the dose regimen of 300 mg bd in these patients.  
• 
In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Classification A), AUC increased by 15% and 
Cmax increased by 13%. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Classification B), AUC 
increased by 8% and Cmax decreased by 13%. The changes in AUC and Cmax of olaparib in patients with 
mild  or  moderate  hepatic  impairment  were  not  considered  to  be  clinically  relevant.  No  olaparib  dose 
adjustment is warranted in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. In the absence of safety 
and PK data, olaparib is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
classification C). 
• 
The effect of renal impairment on exposure to olaparib has been studied. In patients with mild renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] 51 mL/min to 80 mL/min), there was a small increase in mean 
olaparib exposure compared to patients with normal renal function; 15% for Cmax and 24% for AUC. This 
was not considered to be clinically relevant. No olaparib dose adjustment is warranted in patients with mild 
renal impairment. In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 31 mL/min to 50 mL/min), Cmax and 
AUC values increased by 26% and by 44% compared to patients with normal renal function. Patients with 
moderate renal impairment are recommended to take an olaparib tablet dose of 200 mg bd (equivalent to 
Assessment report  
EMA/523504/2020 
Page 17/150 
 
 
  
  
a total daily dose of 400 mg). Olaparib is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment or 
end-stage renal disease (CrCL ≤30 mL/min) since there are no data in such patients.  
• 
No  studies  have  been  conducted  to  investigate  the  pharmacokinetics  of  olaparib  in  paediatric 
patients. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Study D0810C00022 
The potential for drug-drug interaction of the co-administered drugs, olaparib and bevacizumab, has been 
investigated in the formal PK study D0810C00022 performed in the early development of olaparib. This 
investigation was conducted with the hard gelatin capsule formulation. This study is described below. 
Study dates: 
First patient enrolled: 13 June 2008  
Last patient last visit: 25 March 2009  
Objectives  
The primary objective of this study was to determine the safety and tolerability of twice daily (bd) oral 
doses of olaparib (also known as AZD2281, KU-0059436) when administered in combination with 
bevacizumab to patients with advanced solid tumours by assessment of adverse events (AEs), vital signs, 
electrocardiograms (ECG), clinical chemistry, haematology, urinalysis and physical examination.  
The secondary objective was to compare exposure to olaparib when given alone and in combination with 
bevacizumab, by assessment of appropriate derived pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters.  
Study design  
Successive cohorts of 4 to 6 patients received increasing doses of olaparib (100, 200 and 400 mg bd) 
continuously in combination with intravenous (iv) bevacizumab at a fixed dose of 10 mg/kg given every 
14 days (1 cycle). A safety review of the data was performed at the end of each cycle of bevacizumab to 
determine if any dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) would prevent escalation to the next dose of olaparib. Dosing 
with bevacizumab started on Day 8 and continued for a minimum of 2 cycles. To be evaluable for PK 
assessment and potential dose escalation, patients had to complete at least 1 cycle of bevacizumab, and 
have a full PK profile for olaparib taken both in the monotherapy setting (on Day 4) and on the day of 
first administration of bevacizumab.  
Target patient population and sample size  
Up to 18 patients with histologically confirmed metastatic cancer, not amenable to surgery or radiation 
therapy with curative intent, with a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks and Eastern Co-operative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status 0 to 2.  
Investigational product and comparator: dosage, mode of administration and batch numbers  
Olaparib 50 mg capsules given orally bd at doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg.  
Duration of treatment  
A minimum of two 14-day cycles of bevacizumab. Patients could continue combinational study treatment 
indefinitely until they met a withdrawal criterion if, in the investigator’s opinion, they were receiving some 
benefit.

Criteria for evaluation - pharmacokinetics (main variables)  
Maximum and minimum plasma concentrations at steady state (Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss), time to Cmax (tmax) 
and area under the plasma concentration-time curve during the dosing interval at steady state (AUCss).  
Criteria for evaluation - safety (main variables)  
AEs, vital signs, ECG, haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, physical examination.  
Statistical methods  
There was no formal statistical analysis of PK variables or of safety and tolerability data. Data have been 
listed and summarised.   
Patient population  
Twelve patients (4 in each treatment group) with a mean age 49.7 years (range 22 to 71 years) were 
enrolled and received study treatment (olaparib and bevacizumab). Most patients (11/12) were White and 
10/12 were female. Three patients were still receiving their initial treatment (olaparib and bevacizumab) 
at data cut-off (Last patient last visit: 25 March 2009). No patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity and 
so each dose of olaparib was received by 4 patients. Three patients were excluded from the PK analyses 
due to protocol deviations.   
Summary of pharmacokinetic results  
A summary of the PK parameters of olaparib for 200 and 400 mg bd, alone and in combination with 
bevacizumab, is presented in Table 1.  
For both the 200 mg and 400 mg bd groups, the geometric mean (Gmean) AUCss, in combination with 
bevacizumab, were similar to that when given alone (26.57 ng.h/mL compared to 25.79 ng.h/mL for the 
200 mg bd group, and 50.33 ng.h/mL compared to 58.08 ng.h/mL for the 400 mg bd group), with similar 
inter-patient variability (%CVs).  
Similar results were observed for the Gmean Cmax,ss. The mean ratios of olaparib AUCss and Css,max 
(olaparib in combination with bevacizumab to olaparib alone) for both the 200 mg bd and 400 mg bd 
groups were both near to 1.0, at 1.030 and 0.867 for AUCss and 1.105 and 0.889 for Cmax,ss, respectively. 
Of the 7 assessable patients, 4 patients had AUCss values in combination with bevacizumab that were 
within 10% of those values for olaparib alone, and 3 patients had values that were within 20%. These 
results were reflected in the data for the individual ratios of Cmax,ss. For the 2 patients administered 
100 mg olaparib bd that had Cmax,ss data, 1 patient had a Cmax,ss value in combination with bevacizumab 
that was within 15% of that for olaparib alone. The other patient showed approximately an apparent 40% 
decrease.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No new study was submitted. 
Olaparib is a potent inhibitor of human poly (ADP ribose) polymerase enzymes (PARP 1, PARP 2, and 
PARP 3), and has been shown to inhibit the growth of selected tumour cell lines in vitro and tumour 
growth in vivo either as a standalone treatment or in combination with established chemotherapies.  
PARPs are required for the efficient repair of DNA single strand breaks and an important aspect of PARP 
induced repair requires that after chromatin modification, PARP auto modifies itself and dissociates from 
the DNA to facilitate access for base excision repair (BER) enzymes. When olaparib is bound to the active 
site of DNA associated PARP it prevents the dissociation of PARP and traps it on the DNA, thus blocking 
repair. In replicating cells this also leads to the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) when 
replication forks meet the PARP DNA adducts. In normal cells, homologous recombination repair (HRR) 
pathway is effective at repairing these DNA DSBs. In cancer cells lacking critical functional components 
for efficient HRR such as BRCA1 or 2, DNA DSBs cannot be repaired accurately or effectively, leading to 
substantial homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). Instead, alternative and error prone pathways 
are activated, such as the classical non homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, leading to a high degree 
of genomic instability. After a number of rounds of replication, genomic instability can reach insupportable 
levels and result in cancer cell death, as cancer cells already have a high DNA damage load relative to 
normal cells. HRR pathway may be compromised by other mechanisms, although the causative aberrancy 
and penetrance are not fully elucidated. Absence of fully functional HRR pathway is one of the key 
determinants of platinum sensitivity in ovarian and possibly other cancers. 
In BRCA1/2 deficient in vivo models, olaparib given after platinum treatment resulted in a delay in 
tumour progression and an increase in overall survival compared to platinum treatment alone that 
correlated with the period of olaparib maintenance treatment.

Evaluation of biomarkers associated with homologous recombination deficiency in PAOLA-1 
Prospective tBRCA testing was conducted in all screened patients at recommended institutions in France. 
Patients  were  stratified  based  on  their  screening  laboratory  tBRCAm  result.  Note  patients  classified  as 
“absence  of  deleterious  mutation  (tBRCAwt/VUS/unk)”  also  included  patients  who  failed  testing.  gBRCA 
testing was not mandatory in the study; however, information regarding gBRCA status was requested for 
all randomised patients.  
A blood sample collection for central germline BRCA testing of all patients was not included in the PAOLA-
1 study. All sites were requested, but not required, to enter local gBRCA test results in the CRF (negative, 
positive  or  inconclusive,  and  where  available,  the  mutation  name).  The  laboratories  that  carried  out 
screening tBRCA testing, also carried out gBRCA testing for patients enrolled at study sites in France. Of 
the 806 patients randomised into PAOLA-1, 404 (50.1%) patients reported a gBRCA result and 402 (49.9%) 
did not have a gBRCA result reported in the CRF. Out of the 404 patients with gBRCAm results in the CRF, 
120 patients were reported to carry gBRCA mutation (29.7%). 
Available tumour samples from PAOLA-1 patients were retrospectively tested post-randomisation (but prior 
to database lock) using the Myriad myChoice HRD Plus test in order to investigate efficacy in pre-defined 
biomarker subgroups. HRD positive status was determined as either tBRCAm and/or a genomic instability 
score (GIS) ≥ 42. 
The Myriad myChoice CDx test has been developed using BRCA mutant breast and ovarian tumours. The 
GIS  score  is  a  continuous  variable  composed  of  an  assessment  of  three  different  tumour  measures  of 
genomic instability (loss of heterozygosity, telomeric allelic imbalance and large-scale transition) and the 
42-threshold is based on the 5th percentile of genome instability scores (GIS) observed in BRCA mutant 
tumours (i.e. 95% of ovarian BRCAm tumours have a GIS ≥42; Telli et al 2016). The ability of the myChoice 
test  to  discriminate  patients  that  benefit  from  maintenance  PARP  inhibitors  has  been  explored  across  a 
number of ovarian cancer studies, as well as the data from PAOLA-1. The 42-theshold has been evaluated 
prospectively  in  the  NOVA  (Mirza  et  al  2016)  and  PRIMA  (Gonzalez-Martin  et  al  2019)  studies  and 
retrospectively in Study 19 (Hodgson et al 2018). 
Considering the patients that had a local gBRCA result available in the CRF and had a germline/somatic 
status available from Myriad (n=91); this excludes patients with co-occurring BRCA mutations (one patient 
had  2  gBRCA1  mutations),  the  concordance  between  the  CRF  result  and  the  Myriad  prediction  was 
considered high (91.0% PPA; 95.8% NPA). 
Based on the local gBRCA status available in the CRF and the Myriad germline/somatic prediction, patients 
were  allocated  an overall tBRCAm  classification  of  germline,  somatic or  not determined:  160  patients in 
PAOLA-1  were  determined  to  be  gBRCAm  and  51  sBRCAm.  For  38  Myriad  tBRCAm  patients, 
somatic/germline status could not be determined, which included 7 cases where somatic/germline status 
was discordant based on local germline results and Myriad predictions. For the subset of patients that have 
a GIS/HRD score available, somatic and germline BRCAm patients have a similar distribution of GIS/HRD 
scores.

BRCA1 vs BRCA2 mutations and large genomic rearrangements 
The proportion of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutated patients, expressed as a fraction of total BRCAm patients, in 
PAOLA-1  (67.7%  BRCA1m,  31.9%  BRCA2m  and  0.4%  BRCA1m  and  BRCA2m)  was  consistent  with  the 
SOLO1 study (72.8% BRCA1m, 26.4% BRCA2m and 0.8% BRCA1m and BRCA2m) and across recent first 
line ovarian cancer maintenance studies (GOG-218, Norquist et al 2018, and VELIA, Coleman et al 2019) 
with  65.5-69.2%  of  BRCAm  patients  carrying  a  BRCA1  mutation  and  30.8%-34.5%  carrying  a  BRCA2 
mutation. 
In PAOLA-1 (tBRCA) and SOLO1 (gBRCA), the proportion of large rearrangement in BRCA1 and BRCA2 were 
4.2% and 5.7% respectively.  
BRCA-locus specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH) data 
BRCA-gene specific LOH was reported by Myriad using RUO methodology as part of the myChoice HRD plus 
assay. Of 235 Myriad tBRCAm patients, 193/235 (82.1%) were evaluable for determination of BRCA-locus 
specific LOH status. Bi-allelic loss of BRCA was determined in 183/193 (94.8%) of evaluable tumours. In 
10/193 (5.2%) samples, BRCA loss was heterozygous, of which 9 were BRCA2m (5 gBRCA2m, 2 sBRCA2m 
and 2 somatic/germline status unknown) and 1 was BRCA1m (gBRCA1m). 
TP53 mutations 
Sequencing  data  for  TP53  was  available  for  the  PAOLA-1  tumour  samples  analysed  using  the  Myriad 
myChoice  HRD  Plus  assay.  It  has  been  previously  shown  that  TP53  mutations  are  present  in  almost  all 
cases of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (Ahmed et al 2010) and 697/755 (92.3%) of PAOLA-1 tumour 
samples sequenced at Myriad harboured a mutation in TP53 predicted to affect protein function. Using the 
same classification schemes as described for Study 19 (Molina-Vila et al 2014; Poeta et al 2007), 350/697 
(50.2%)  of  TP53  mutations  in  PAOLA-1  were  predicted  to  be  disruptive  and  340/697  (48.9%)  non-
disruptive  in  nature.  For  7/697  (1.0%)  patients  the  disruptive  vs  non-disruptive  status  of  the  mutation 
could not be determined.  
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Olaparib tablets as monotherapy, is already approved in adult patients with advanced (FIGO stages III and 
IV) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete 
or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Olaparib PKs (ADME) as well as 
the influencing intrinsic factors have been fully characterized and already evaluated with the hard gelatine 
capsules and the tablets.  
The variation under review consists of the use of olaparib tablets in combination with bevacizumab in the 
same  indication.  The  claimed  dose  of  olaparib  for  the  combination  is  identical  to  that  approved  in  the 
monotherapy indication. The combination indication is not claimed for the hard gelatine capsule. 
No  new  clinical  PK  investigations  pertaining  the  claimed  variation  was  submitted.  No  PK  investigation 
(sparse sampling or formal PK) have been included in the pivotal PAOLA-1 study.  
The results of Study D0810C00022, an open label, dual-centre, Phase I study to assess the safety and 
tolerability of olaparib when used in combination with bevacizumab in patients with advanced solid 
tumours were presented. The design of the study is far less than optimal to pertain to the claimed 
variation. The tested formulation is hard gelatin capsule and the tested doses were 200 and 400 mg. 
While the variation under review concerns the tablets and the daily dose is 600 mg. Bearing in mind that 
the absolute bioavailability of the capsule is much lower than that of tablets, the olaparib dose tested in 
this DDI interaction study is too low. Also, the very limited number of patients enrolled in each arm of the 
study (n=3-4) is an additional pitfall in the study., Although. no firm conclusion can be drawn due to

study limitations, the study did not indicate significant difference in the systemic exposure to olaparib 
when co-administered with bevacizumab.  
Furthermore, as bevacizumab is not a cytokine modulator, it is not expected to have any effect on 
CYP450 enzymes (Kenny et al 2013) and on the PK/exposure of olaparib.  
The impact of co-administration of olaparib on the PKs of bevacizumab was neither investigated nor 
discussed. The MAH argued that at the therapeutic dose of 15 mg/kg Q3W in PAOLA-1, the clearance of 
bevacizumab is predominantly mediated by catabolism and not by TMDD. Therapeutic mAbs which are 
cleared primarily by TMDD, typically exhibit dose-dependent PK (Betts et al 2018). Therefore, olaparib is 
unlikely to affect the clearance of bevacizumab via the TMDD pathway or via any other putative or 
plausible mechanisms. It is agreed that TMDD elimination pathway is plausibly saturated. Thus, the 
absence of interaction investigation is acceptable. 
No investigation of Exposure-Safety Relationships for olaparib and bevacizumab has been carried out. 
This is mainly justified by the difficulty in deriving an unbiased and predictive multivariate ER model 
based on available data from PAOLA study. Therefore, no supportive data are available and the safety 
should be appreciated solely on the observational safety data collected in the PAOLA study. No 
investigation of Exposure-efficacy Relationship has been carried out as well. 
Several biomarkers have been used to date to assess the extent of homologous recombination deficiency 
(HRD) in tumours. Based on mechanistical rationale, mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (of germline 
and somatic origin) have been associated with HRD and have been largely used in clinical studies to 
inform on HRD status, although mutations in these genes might neither be necessary nor sufficient for 
response to PARPi. Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) positive status can be defined by 
detection of a BRCA1/2 mutation classified as deleterious/suspected deleterious or pathogenic/likely 
pathogenic. Other biomarkers can be used to inform on the extent of HRD in tumour cells. Detection of 
BRCA1/2 mutations could be combined with positive HRD score to determine HRD positive status. 
HR deficiency-associated genomic alterations that have been investigated in Paola-1 include genome-wide 
loss of heterozygosity, telomeric allelic imbalance and large scale transition, which are continuous 
measures with pre-defined criteria and score. Composite genomic instability score (GIS, also called HRD 
score) is determined when the combined measures and respective scores are used to assess the extent of 
specific genomic aberrations accumulated in tumour cells. Lower score defines lower likelihood of HR 
deficiency of tumour cells and higher score determines higher likelihood of HR deficiency of tumour cells 
at the time of the sample collection relative to exposure to DNA damaging agents. HRD positive status 
can be defined by a composite GIS score for HR deficiency-associated genomic alterations tested by an 
experienced laboratory using a validated test. 
With regards to the evaluation of gBRCAm status, the concordance between the CRF result and the 
Myriad prediction was considered high (91.0% PPA; 95.8% NPA). The bi-allelic LOH was reported in the 
majority of tumours (95%). The OS data are currently too immature in PAOLA-1 to conduct a subgroup 
analysis for OS based on TP53 status. Submission of subgroup analyses is expected when final OS data 
become available (REC). The MAH is also recommended to submit additional exploratory analyses of 
tumour samples at progression upon finalisation in 2023. (REC) 
Overall, there are no PK/PD data provided in support for the claimed dose of the combination in the applied 
indication. The currently approved doses of each drug in ovarian tumours was selected for the development 
of the combination (Study PAOLA-1). As discussed above, it is not expected that bevacizumab could have 
any effect on the PK/exposure of olaparib and vice-versa.

Treatments 
• Olaparib tablets per os 300 mg twice daily, 
• Placebo tablets per os twice daily. 
It was recommended that patient begins study treatment as soon as possible after randomization, within 7 
days and ideally concomitant with bevacizumab administration. 
Bevacizumab, as standard of care therapy, was administered in both arms as followed: 
• 15 mg/kg, d1, q3w, for a total duration of 15 months / 22 cycles (including combination with platinum-
based chemotherapy). 
Patients continued bevacizumab in the maintenance setting and started treatment with Lynparza after a 
minimum  of  3  weeks  and  up  to  a  maximum  of  9  weeks  following  completion  of  their  last  dose  of 
chemotherapy.  Treatment  with  Lynparza  was  continued  until  progression  of  the  underlying  disease, 
unacceptable toxicity or for up to 2 years. Patients who in the opinion of the treating physician could derive 
further benefit from continuous treatment could be treated beyond 2 years. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
To  determine  the  efficacy  by  progression  free  survival  (PFS1)  investigator  based  according  to  modified 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.1) of olaparib maintenance compared to 
placebo in high grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer that are in clinical complete 
response or partial response following first line platinum-taxane based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, 
and planned to pursue bevacizumab in the maintenance phase up to a total of 15 months. 
Secondary objectives: 
1. To determine: 
Assessment report  
EMA/523504/2020 
Page 28/150 
 
 
  
  
 
-time to earliest progression by RECIST or Cancer Antigen-125 (CA-125) or death, 
-time from randomization to first subsequent therapy or death (TFST), 
- time from randomization to second progression (PFS2), 
- time from randomization to second subsequent therapy or death (TSST), 
- overall survival (OS). 
2. To assess the safety and tolerability of olaparib and bevacizumab maintenance compared to bevacizumab 
alone. 
3. To compare the effects of olaparib maintenance compared to placebo on Health-Related Quality of Life 
(HRQoL) and patient reported outcomes (PROs), with consideration of patient preference. 
4. To evaluate the impact of treatment and disease on resource use. 
Exploratory objectives: 
1. To explore pre planned subgroup analyses of efficacy (including PFS1 and OS) based on relevant potential 
prognostic factors, including, but not limited to stratification factors, clinical characteristics and tumour HR 
deficiency status (BRCAm, mutations in other HR genes and Myriad HRD scar status) 
2.  Explore  the  time  to  next  severe  toxicity  (grade  4  neutropenia  lasting  >  7  days,  grade  ≥3  febrile 
neutropenia, grade 4 thrombocytopenia with bleeding or platelet transfusion, grade ≥ 3 non-hematological 
toxicity) in both arms. 
3. To explore the correlation between geriatric assessment and efficacy and tolerance of olaparib versus 
placebo for patients > 70 years old. 
4. To explore the efficacy of olaparib by assessment of overall survival (OS) adjusting for the impact of 
spontaneous switching (outside of study design) to Polyadenosine 5’diphosphoribose [poly (ADP ribose)] 
polymerization (PARP) inhibitors or other potentially active investigational agents. 
5.  Biological  biomarkers  analysis:  to  determine  the  frequency  of  somatic  BRCA  mutation  (sBRCAm)  in 
tumour samples and to compare this with germline BRCA mutation (gBRCAm) status. To determine a HR 
deficiency signature correlated with olaparib efficacy combined with bevacizumab. 
6. To explore whether resistance mechanisms to olaparib can be identified through analysis of tumour and 
blood  samples  –  archival  tumour  and  blood  sample  at  baseline  (mandatory),  tumour  biopsy  and  blood 
sample on progression (optional). 
7. Future exploratory research into factors that may influence response to study treatment (where response 
is  defined  broadly  to include  efficacy,  tolerability or safety)  and  may  be  performed  on  the  collected  and 
stored archival tumour samples that were mandatory for entry onto the study or on optional tumour biopsy 
samples collected during the course of the study. 
8. To collect and store DNA (according to each country’s local and ethical procedures) for future exploratory 
research into genes/genetic variation that may influence response (i.e., distribution, safety, tolerability and 
efficacy) to study treatments and or susceptibility to disease (optional). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
PFS was defined as the time from randomization until the date of the first objective radiological disease 
progression  according  to  investigator  assessment  of  RECIST  version  1.1  or  death  (by  any  cause  in  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/523504/2020 
Page 29/150 
 
 
  
  
absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdraws from randomized study treatment or 
receives another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression. 
Secondary endpoints: 
1. OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause. Any patient 
not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which 
the patient was known to be alive. 
2.  Time  to  earliest  progression  by  RECIST  v.  1.1  or  CA-125  or  death  was  defined  as  the  time  from 
randomization to the earliest date of RECIST or CA-125 progression or death by any cause. Progression 
according to CA-125 was assessed according to GCIG 
3.  PFS2.  Time  from  randomization  to  second  progression  is  defined  as  the  time  from  the  date  of 
randomization  to  the  earliest  of  the  progression  event  subsequent  to  that used  for  the  primary  variable 
PFS1, or date of death. The date of second progression will be recorded by the investigator and defined 
according  to  local  standard  clinical  practice  and  may  involve  any  of;  objective  radiological,  CA-125  or 
symptomatic  progression  or  death.  Second  progression  status  will  be  reviewed  regularly  following  the 
progression event used for the primary variable PFS (PFS1) and recorded. Patient alive and for whom a 
second disease progression has not been observed should be censored at the last time known to be alive 
and without a second disease progression, i.e. censored at the latest of the tumor assessment date if the 
patient has not had a second progression or death). 
4.  TFST  is  defined  as  the time  from  the  date  of  randomization  to the earliest of  the  date  of  anti-cancer 
therapy start date following study treatment discontinuation, or death.  
5.  TSST  is  defined  as  the  time  from  the  date  of  randomization  to  the  earliest  of  the  date  of  second 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy start date following study treatment discontinuation, or death. 
6. Patient reported outcomes (PROs) variables (EORTC QLQ-C30 and OV-28), with consideration of patient 
preference. 
7. Geriatric assessment will be performed using the Geriatric Vulnerability Score (GVS). 
Sample size 
The  study  was  calibrated  to  detect  a  treatment  effect  hazard  ratio  (HR)  of  0.75,  translating  in  an 
improvement in median PFS1 from 15.8 months (control arm) to 21.1 months (olaparib arm), (Herzog et 
al., 2014) with a 2:1 randomization, allowing patients to have only 1 chance out 3 to get placebo. A total 
of 458 events in the study would have approximately > 80% power to show statistically significant PFS1 at 
a 2-sided alpha. Considering a recruitment duration of 24 months and a 21-month follow-up for the last 
included patient (estimated total duration from first randomized patient to PFS1 assessment: 45months), 
assuming a common exponential dropout rate of 1%, 762 patients will be randomized in the study (508 
patients  in  the  olaparib  arm  and  254  patients  in  the  placebo  arm)  so  that  maturity  of  the  PFS1  data  is 
approximately 60%. 
Approximately 24 patients were planned to be randomized in Japan by the Gynecologic Oncology Trial and 
Investigation Consortium of North Kanto (GOTIC) in addition to the 762 randomized patients. The patients 
randomized in Japan were to be included in the Full Analysis Set provided there are no clinical data from 
the  ongoing  olaparib  program  suggesting  different  efficacy  or  safety  with  olaparib  tablet  in  Japanese 
patients with high grade epithelial ovarian cancer.

Randomisation 
Approximately 762 patients were planned to be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the treatments with olaparib 
or placebo.  
Stratification was to be done by: 
• First line treatment outcome at screening as defined below: 
1. No Evidence of Disease (*) with complete macroscopic resection at initial debulking surgery, 
2.  No  Evidence  of  Disease/  Complete  response  (*)  with  complete  macroscopic  resection  at  interval 
debulking surgery, 
3. No Evidence of Disease (*) / Complete Response at screening, in patients who had either incomplete 
resection (at initial or interval debulking surgery) or no debulking surgery (Debulking surgery considered 
as not feasible), 
4. Partial Response. 
 (*) Patients without assessable disease after initial debulking surgery will be considered to have NED at 
the  end  of  first-line  chemotherapy  and  surgery  strategy  if  the  disease  has  not  progressed.  Those  with 
measurable or assessable disease after initial surgery or at the start of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and 
whose disease is no more detectable at the end of the chemotherapy and surgery strategy will be considered 
to have achieved a complete response (CR).

Blinding (masking) 
This study is double-blind.  
Statistical methods 
The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS1) defined as the time from the date of randomization 
to the first documented disease progression (according to RECIST v1.1) or death from any cause, whichever 
occurs first. 
Patients  had  RECIST  1.1  tumour  assessments  at  baseline  and  every  24  weeks  (CT/MRI  at  12  weeks  if 
clinical or CA 125 progression) for up to 42 months or until objective radiological disease progression. 
PFS was to be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and to be described in terms of median PFS1 per 
arm, and hazard ratio for progression between the 2 arms. Associated 2-sided 95% CI for the estimates 
were to be provided. The HR comparing randomised treatments (and associated CI) were estimated from 
a stratified Cox Proportional Hazards model (with ties=Efron and the stratification variables as strata) and 
the  CI  was  calculated  using  a  profile  likelihood  approach.    The  HR  (olaparib/bevacizumab  vs 
placebo/bevacizumab) together with its corresponding 95% CI and p-value were presented. 
PFS distributions were to be compared between the 2 study arms using a 2-sided Log-Rank test (significance 
level of 5%) stratified by response to first line treatment and tBRCA status, supported by a stratified Cox 
regression. 
This analysis was to be performed when approximately 458 PFS1 events have occurred. 
Multiple testing procedure and hierarchical testing strategy 
In order to strongly control the type I error at 5% 2-sided for key label claims, a multiple testing procedure 
(MTP) was to be employed across the primary endpoint (PFS1) and key secondary endpoints (PFS2 and 
OS). 
A hierarchical testing strategy was to be employed where PFS1 is tested first using the full test mass (full 
test mass = alpha) and key secondary endpoints of PFS2 and OS will then be tested using a MTP with a 
recycling strategy (i.e., the MTP will recycle the test mass to the endpoint not yet rejected in the hierarchy). 
The hierarchical testing strategy is detailed below. 
PFS2 was to be only be tested if statistical significance was shown for PFS1. OS was only to be tested if the 
null hypothesis (of no difference) was rejected for PFS2. 
PFS2 analysis 
An interim PFS2 analysis (IA) was to be performed at the time of the PFS1 analysis. Final PFS2 analysis 
was  planned  to  be  performed  when  the  PFS2  data  were  approximately  53%  mature  (approximately 
411 events) OR after a maximum duration of 1 year following the PFS1 analysis, whichever occurred first. 
OS analysis 
An interim OS analysis (IA) was to be performed when statistical significance was shown for PFS2 (interim 
or  final  PFS2  analysis).  Final  OS  analysis  was  planned  to  be  performed  when  the  OS  data  were 
approximately 60% mature OR after a 3-year duration from the main PFS1 analysis, whichever occurred 
first.

The complete multiple testing procedure accounting for the inclusion of interim PFS2 and OS analyses is 
detailed below. 
Figure 3: Complete MTP including PFS2 and OS interim analysis in the hierarchical testing 
strategy 
Adjustment for interim PFS2 analysis 
If statistical significance was shown for PFS1, the full test mass (alpha) was to be carried forward to PFS2. 
In  order  to  adjust  for  the  inclusion  of  an  interim  PFS2  analysis,  the  Lan  and  DeMets  approach  that 
approximates the O’Brien and Fleming spending function was to be used (Lan and DeMets 1983). The 1-
sided  significance  level  at  the  interim  analysis  was  to  be  calculated  based  on  the  information  fraction 
observed  at  this  time;  the  information  fraction  was  defined  as  the  ratio  between  the  number  of  events 
observed at the time of the interim analysis and the total number of events required for the final analysis. 
As  an  example,  if  358  PFS2  events  have  occurred  at  the  interim  analysis,  translating  in  an  information 
fraction of 87%, then the significance level will be 1.6% at the interim analysis. 
If the null hypothesis for PFS2 was not rejected at the first analysis time point, then accounting for the 
expected correlation between the proportion of events at the interim and at the final analysis, the 1-sided 
significance level at the final PFS2 analysis was to be approximately 2% (final significance level was to be 
determined once the exact correlation between the interim and final PFS2 analyses was known). 
Adjustment for interim OS analysis 
If PFS2 was significant at either the interim or final analyses, the full test mass (alpha) was to be carried 
forward to OS. Statistical significance was to be declared at the interim analysis for OS if the null hypothesis 
for PFS2 was rejected and the observed p-value for OS was p<0.0001. This allows the significance level at 
the final analysis for OS to be controlled at the 2.5% level (1-sided) (Haybittle J L 1971)). 
Analysis 
PFS2 and OS were to be analyzed using the same methodology as described for the PFS1 analysis, taking 
into  account  the  MTP  described  above.  Should  PFS1  not  be  statistically  significant,  the  study  would  still 
continue to final OS timepoint for descriptive/research purposes.

Patient reported outcome analysis 
Quality of Life (QoL) were to be analysed descriptively. Descriptive statistics, graphs and listings were to 
be reported to evaluate the effect of olaparib maintenance on symptoms, HRQoL and PROs. The relationship 
between patient-reported outcomes, progression and AEs was to be assessed. 
Exploratory endpoints analysis 
Subgroup analyses of PFS1 and OS were to be conducted to assess consistency of treatment effect across 
predefined subsets, and to identify predictive factors of olaparib efficacy as maintenance therapy.  
Subgroups considered were to include, but may not be limited to: 
Stratifications factors: 
• tBRCA status as per randomisation (tBRCAm vs tBRCAwt/VUS/unk) 
• First line treatment outcome 
Tumour characteristics as assessed by Myriad MyChoice HRD plus assay: 
• Tumour BRCA mutation status (tBRCAm vs non-tBRCAm) 
• Tumour HRR associated including BRCAm (HRRm* vs non-HRRm) 
• Tumour Myriad HRD status cut off 42 (HRD positive vs HRD negative). 
• Tumour Myriad HRD status cut off 33 (HRD positive vs HRD negative) 
• Tumour HR deficiency status (tBRCAm or HRRm or HRD (42) + vs absence of HR deficiency biomarker) 
• Tumour HR deficiency status (tBRCAm or HRRm or HRD (33) + vs absence of HR deficiency biomarker) 
Main clinical characteristics: 
• Age at randomisation (<65 vs. ≥ 65) 
• FIGO stage at disease (FIGO III vs IV) 
• Histological subgroups (HGSOC vs others) 
• ECOG performance status at baseline (0 or 1) 
• Baseline CA-125 value (≤ ULN vs > ULN) 
• BRCA mutation type (BRCA1, BRCA2 or BRCA1/2 (both) 
• Cytoreductive surgery outcome (no residual disease vs residual disease) 
• Timing of cytoreductive surgery (upfront vs interval debulking) 
• Duration of chemotherapy plus bevacizumab before randomization 
• Region (Europe vs Japan) 
• Other exploratory molecular subgroups 
• QoL, safety 
Response rate, best objective response rate and duration of response 
For  patients,  in  partial  response  at  the  randomization,  the  objective  response  rate  (complete  or  partial 
response) was to be presented in each treatment arm by a proportion together with its 95% confidence 
interval and will be compared between the two arms using a Fisher exact test.

Primary endpoint Supportive (sensitivity) analysis 
If  the  primary  PFS1  analysis  according  to  investigator  assessment  is  positive,  a  sensitivity  analysis  for 
progression free survival as measured by central review assessment might be performed to support primary 
PFS1 results. 
No  adjustment  to  the  significance  level  for  testing  was  to  be  made  since  this  analysis  was  only  to  be 
considered as supportive of the primary analysis of PFS1.

Recruitment 
The  first  patient  was  enrolled  into  the  study  on  10  July  2015  and  the  last  patient  on  31  August  2017. 
Patients were randomised in 137 study centres in 11 countries worldwide (97% in Europe and 3% in Japan): 
Austria (6 centres), Belgium (3 centres), Denmark (1 centre), Finland (2 centres), France and Monaco (44 
centres), Germany (51 centres), Italy (9 centres), Japan (7 centres), Spain (13 centres) and Sweden (1 
centre). 24 patients were randomised in Japan centers and are included in the FAS. The majority of patients 
were  randomised  in  France  (327  patients),  Germany  (251  patients),  Italy  (85  patients)  and  spain  (55 
patients). 
The DCO date for the primary analysis was 22 March 2019, 44 months after the first patient enrolment.

Table 7: Previous treatments for ovarian cancer (FAS) 
The study randomised 806 patients (2:1 randomisation: 537 olaparib/bevacizumab: 269 
placebo/bevacizumab) who had no evidence of disease (NED) due to complete surgical resection, or who 
were in complete response (CR), or partial response (PR) following completion of first-line platinum-
containing chemotherapy and bevacizumab. Patients had completed a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 9 
cycles, with the majority (63%) having received 6 cycles of first line platinum-taxane based 
chemotherapy, including a minimum of 2 cycles of bevacizumab in combination with the 3 last cycles of 
chemotherapy. The median number of bevacizumab cycles prior to randomisation was 5.

Table 8: Number of cycles of previous first line treatment prior to randomisation (FAS) 
Patients were counted as to have received a cycle of therapy as soon as the infusion had started. Platinum-taxane 
based regimen must have consisted of a minimum of 6 treatment cycles and a maximum of 9. However, if platinum-
based therapy was discontinued early as a result of non-haematological toxicities specifically related to the platinum 
regimen, (i.e., neurotoxicity, hypersensitivity etc), patients must have received a minimum of 4 cycles of the 
platinum regimen. Patients must have received, prior to randomisation, a minimum of 3 cycles of bevacizumab in 
combination with the 3 last cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. Only in cases of interval debulking surgery, was 
it permitted to receive only 2 cycles of bevacizumab in combination with the last 3 cycles of platinum-based 
chemotherapy.

BRCA mutation status  
In the overall patient population enrolled, 30% of patients in both arms were tBRCAm 
(deleterious/pathogenic mutation) at screening by local testing and for 4% of patients the BRCAm status 
was unknown. Retrospective analysis of available clinical samples was conducted in 97% of patients to 
confirm tBRCAm status and investigate genomic instability score. Among non-tBRCAm patients, 29% 
(19% of the overall population) had positive GIS pre-defined in this study as composite score ≥42. When 
tBRCAm status and positive GIS were combined, patients with HRD-positive, HRD-negative and HRD 
unknown status in their tumours represented 48%, 34% and 18% of the overall patient population.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: PFS by investigator assessment 
PFS (based on investigator assessment) was the primary variable for the study and was analysed based on 
the primary DCO (22 March 2019) using the FAS population.  
At the time of PFS analysis, the median duration of treatment with Lynparza was 17.3 months and 
15.6 months for placebo. The median duration of bevacizumab post-randomisation was 11.0 months on 
the Lynparza arm and 10.4 months on the placebo arm.  
The progression status based on investigator assessment at the time of PFS analysis is presented below.

Subsequent therapy 
Of patients who received any subsequent therapy, PARP inhibitors were received by 49 (16.4%) of the 298 
olaparib/bevacizumab-treated patients and 83 (43.0%) of the 193 placebo/bevacizumab-treated patients 
(DCO Sept 2019). Out of the 36 patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm who received a subsequent PARPi 
treatment, 34 patients receive it as maintenance treatment and 2 patients as a first subsequent treatment 
(DCO 22 March 2019).

performed. OS analyses by subgroups have been pre-specified as such, but an update has been with DCO 
30 September 2019, in addition to the analysis with primary endpoint analysis DCO, has been submitted 
during procedure. Analyses for main subgroups (tBRCAm at randomisation, tBRAm by Myriad analysis and

Analyses for GIS subgroups 
Subgroups defined only by GIS have not been pre-specified and subgroup analyses in GIS positive (score 
≥42), GIS negative (score <42) and unknown GIS subgroups has been requested during procedure. 
At cut-off 42, the GIS positive subgroup contains 60 fewer patients than the HRD positive subgroup: 
- 19 tBRCAm patients that had a GIS score <42 (these patients moved into the GIS score negative group) 
- 41 tBRCAm patients that failed GIS score testing (these patients moved into the unknown group)

Myriad HRD status “unknown” subgroup 
Although not a protocol-specified subgroup, to account for the remaining patients in the FAS, a post-hoc 
analysis of OS was conducted in the subgroup of patients with Myriad HRD unknown status (see table with 
updated OS analysis at DCO 30 September 2019 above).  
The  HRD  biomarker  positive  and  negative  subgroups  considered  the  Myriad  testing  results  only,  and 
therefore  the  HRD  unknown  subgroup  included  a  subset  of  patients  that  were  tBRCAm  by  screening 
laboratory  testing.  In  total,  there  were  21  Myriad  HRD  status  unknown  patients  who  were  tBRCAm  at 
randomisation with 9 (10%) on the olaparib arm and 12 (23.1%) on the placebo arm. The KM plot for the 
HRD unknown subgroup is shown in Figure below.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In  support  of  the  submitted  application,  the  MAH  provided  the  results  of  PAOLA-1  study  which  is  an 
institutional sponsored, pivotal Phase III, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, multicentre study 
investigating the efficacy and safety of olaparib vs placebo when added to bevacizumab as maintenance 
treatment  for  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  advanced  (FIGO  stage  IIIB-IV)  high-grade  serous  or 
endometrioid ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who were in response following first line 
treatment with platinum-taxane chemotherapy and bevacizumab.  
The  study  was  designed  to  investigate  a  potential  synergistic  clinical  benefit  or  at  least  additive  benefit 
when combining bevacizumab (VEGF inhibitor) and olaparib (PARP inhibitor) in the maintenance setting in 
patients who are not selected by biomarker status.  
No  PK/PD  modelling  was  performed  in  order  to  investigate  the  PK/PD  relationship  of  olaparib  and 
bevacizumab  in  the  claimed  indication.  Empirically,  the  currently  approved  doses  of  each  drug  in  solid 
tumours were implemented in the development of the combination (Study PAOLA-1). 
Olaparib was approved on 12 June 2019 for maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed advanced BRCAm 
ovarian  cancer  patients  (EPAR  Lynparza).  The  results  from  SOLO1  demonstrated  a  substantial  70% 
reduction in risk of disease progression or death (HR 0.30; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.41; p<0.0001) with olaparib 
compared to placebo with an improvement in median PFS for olaparib over placebo estimated to be in the 
region of 3 years.  
In a population not selected on the basis on BRCA mutations, according to the results from study GOG-
218, a phase III multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three arm study evaluating the 
effect  of  adding  bevacizumab  to  an  approved  chemotherapy  regimen  in  patients  with  advanced  ovarian 
cancer,  a  maintenance  treatment  with  bevacizumab  produced  a  significant  benefit  in  PFS  (15  months 
compared with 12 months without maintenance and with 11 months without bevacizumab at all (Avastin 
SmPC). Bevacizumab could not show a clear benefit for BRCAm patients. In the subgroup of patients with 
HRR  mutations  (n=228)  the  HR  for  PFS  was  0.95  (95%  CI  0.71-1.26)  for  bevacizumab  + 
carboplatin/paclitaxel vs carboplatin/paclitaxel while the HR 0.71 (95% CI 0.60-0.85) in the subgroup of 
patients with no HRR mutation (n=581) (Norquist et al. 2018). In patients with BRCA mutations, HR was 
0.82 (95% CI 0.55-1.21) and 1.10 (95% CI 0.61-2.0) in the BRCA1 (n=114) and BRCA2 subgroups (n=59) 
respectively.  
Due  to  the  absence  of  olaparib  monotherapy  arm  and  suboptimal  stratification  factor  (tBRCAm)  to 
distinguish patients with or without the sensitive degree of HRD, it remains currently unknown what is the 
contribution of components of such VEGFi-PARPi combination therapy in maintenance phase. Bevacizumab 
is indicated in the first-line maintenance setting only after prior concomitant treatment with platinum-based 
chemotherapy, whereas olaparib is indicated in first-line maintenance after platinum-based chemotherapy 
in the subgroup of BRCA1/2-mutated (germline and/or somatic) patients. Only, the contribution of olaparib 
could be assessed as add-on therapy to bevacizumab used in both arms concurrently with chemotherapy 
and in maintenance setting for the total duration of treatment up to 15 months. 
Inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  are  overall  considered  acceptable.  Nevertheless,  they  define  a 
heterogeneous  population  as  patients  were  included  regardless  of  their  HRD  status  (mutations  in  HRR 
genes/ HRD genomic scar/unknown Pt sensitivity status). There is a priori biological rational and evidence 
indicating  that  biomarkers  associated  with  homologous  recombination  deficiency  can  be  a  plausible 
predictive factor of therapeutic response for olaparib in ovarian cancer, more particularly in the context of

first line maintenance treatment when, in contrast to relapsed setting, platinum sensitivity has not yet been 
established according to usually used criteria (Pt treatment-free-interval>6 months).  
Eligible patients were those with newly diagnosed advanced (FIGO Stage IIIB, IIIC or IV) ovarian cancer, 
primary  peritoneal  cancer  and/or  fallopian  tube  cancer  that  was  histologically  confirmed  as  high-grade 
serous,  or  high-grade  endometrioid,  or  other  epithelial  non  mucinous  ovarian  cancer  in  a  patient  with 
gBRCA1 or 2 deleterious mutation. Prior to randomisation, patients must have had NED or be in CR or PR 
following first line treatment. There should have been no clinical evidence of disease progression (physical 
exam,  imaging,  or  CA-125)  throughout  the  first  line  treatment  and  prior  to  study  randomisation.  Any 
occurrence of discrepancy between investigator tumour assessment and BICR assessment at baseline in 
term of deviation from eligibility criteria (NED, CR and PR) and incorrect stratification by first line treatment 
outcome was requested to be discussed. The MAH argued that the eligibility criteria with regards to first 
line treatment outcome was assessed only by the investigator. The baseline overall response status was 
not a requirement for the BICR assessment. Patients were randomised at least 3 weeks and no more than 
9 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy and during this time bevacizumab could be continued as a 
single agent.  
Bevacizumab  was  administered  for  up  to  15  months/22  cycles  in  total  (including  the  period  of  pre-
randomisation given with chemotherapy and post-randomisation given with olaparib or placebo) in line with 
the SmPC recommendations (SmPC Avastin). Patients were to receive olaparib or placebo 300 mg BID for 
up  to  2  years or  until objective  radiological  disease  progression  or unacceptable toxicity  in  line  with  the 
recently approved recommendations in the SmPC for maintenance treatment in newly diagnosed advanced 
BRCAm ovarian cancer (SmPC Lynparza). Patients who in the opinion of the treating physician could derive 
further benefit from continuous treatment, could be treated beyond 2 years. Upon progression, patients 
were able to access PARP inhibitors including olaparib outside of the study. OS and PFS2 analysis are thus 
diluted  by  cross-over  and  multiple  subsequent  lines  of  therapy.  This  is  likely  to  hamper  comparisons  in 
terms of OS and PFS2. 
PFS  by  investigator  is  the  primary  endpoint  in  PAOLA-1  study,  supported  by  PFS2,  OS  (adjusted  for 
multiplicity), TFST, TSST, TDT, BOR, PRO as secondary endpoints. The assessment of PFS2 is considered 
crucial in this setting in order to assess any possible negative effect on next line therapy and to outbalance 
tolerability and toxicity concerns related to maintenance therapy.  
The primary analysis of PFS was based on site or investigator assessment of scans according to modified 
RECIST 1.1 criteria. The study was double-blinded, but investigator bias cannot be ruled out due to the 
known  toxicity  profile  of  olaparib.  A  blinded  independent  central  review  (BICR)  of  progression  data  was 
thus  conducted.  Nevertheless,  after  investigators  confirmed  progression,  no  further  scans  were  sent  for 
central  review.  In  this  regard,  bias  due  to  informative  censoring  (patients  had  progressed  according  to 
investigator but not according to BICR) may be likely. PFS2 events were defined by investigator according 
to local standard clinical practice, without considering scheduled visits, and could involve radiological, CA-
125  or  symptomatic  progression.  The  variability  in  the  methods  and  frequency  of  tumour  assessments 
between treatment arms and different centres were discussed. There is no impact on the reliability and the 
accuracy of results.  
Sample size calculation was driven by number of PFS events. 762 patients were planned to be randomised 
(2:1 ratio) so that maturity of the PFS data was approximately 60%, considering a recruitment duration of 
24  months  and  a  21-month  follow-up  for  the  last  included  patient  (estimated  total  duration  from  first 
randomized patient to PFS1 assessment: 45months) and assuming a common exponential dropout rate of 
1%. In addition, approximately 24 patients were to be randomised in Japan. The patients randomised in 
Japan were included in the FAS provided that there were no clinical data derived from the ongoing olaparib 
programme that  suggested  a  different  efficacy  or safety  profile  for  olaparib  tablets in  Japanese  patients 
with  high-grade  epithelial  ovarian  cancer.  It  is  noted  that  the  sample  size  was  increased  by  protocol 
Assessment report

amendment (Version 4) from 612 to 762 patients. The assumption of treatment effect was reduced for the 
calculation of the new sample size (from HR of 0.7 to HR of 0.75).  
Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio. The randomisation was stratified by 2 prognostic factors: first line 
treatment outcome including  4  strata  (NED  with  complete  resection  at  initial surgery,  CR  with  complete 
resection at IDS, CR with incomplete resection or no surgery and PR) and local tBRCA status with 2 strata 
(deleterious mutation, and absence of deleterious mutation) at screening.  
A multiple testing procedure was employed across PFS and key secondary endpoints (PFS2 and OS). An 
interim OS analysis was planned to be performed when statistical significance was shown for PFS and PFS2 
(interim or final PFS2 analysis). Accordingly, only a descriptive OS interim analysis (25.9% maturity) was 
performed at the primary analysis of PFS (DCO 22 March 2019). An updated descriptive interim OS analysis 
(33% maturity) has been provided during procedure (DCO 30 September 2019). 
Seven amendments to the original study protocol version were made. Most of the amendments and 
changes to the design of the study were for administrative or clarification purposes. In the protocol 
version 3, the amendment allowed patients having IDS to have only 2 cycles of bevacizumab in 
combination with the last 3 cycles of Platinum-based chemotherapy, in line with standard clinical practices 
for patients having IDS.  
Under protocol amendment 6, additional PFS and OS subgroup analyses have been pre-specified, 
including analyses in biomarker-defined subgroups defined based on retrospective post-randomisation 
analysis of tumour tissue samples by Myriad myChoice HRD Plus test. 
Important protocol deviations have been reported in 6% of patients. These were generally balanced 
between treatment arms (6.5% for the olaparib/bevacizumab arm and 4.8% for the placebo/bevacizumab 
arm) and no patient have had more than 1 important protocol deviation.  
The applicant reported that the sponsor of the study, one CRO and 10 investigator centres (France 1 site, 
Germany 1 site, Italy 1 site and Japan 7 sites) were independently audited by a third party, on behalf of 
the MAH and no critical findings were identified across the five audits conducted. However, one outcome of 
the sponsor audit was that the process for assessing, documenting and managing protocol violations was 
not considered robust to ensure compliance with GCP and integrity of trial results. In fact, sponsor grading 
and assessment of the majority of protocol violations has not been completed (violations dated from 2015 
and  included  violations  to  eligibility  criteria,  dispensing  errors  and  incorrect  randomisation).  This  was  a 
serious concern that could have substantially affected the integrity and the robustness of the study data. 
Accordingly, a retrospective re-review and formal grading of all the protocol non-compliance prior to June 
2018 has been undertaken. Feedback from the Sponsor with regards to the non-compliance review is that 
there are 20 additional major deviations. The number of patients with at least one major protocol deviations 
has thus increased from 6% to 8.4%. The newly identified major deviations are considered unlikely to have 
influenced the overall efficacy and safety conclusions of the study.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Of the 1222 patients enrolled into the study, 416 patients were not randomised, with 324 patients not 
meeting the eligibility criteria; the most common reason being that patients had not received a minimum 
of 3 cycles of bevacizumab in combination with the 3 last cycles of platinum-based therapy. 806 patients 
were randomised in 137 study centres in 11 countries worldwide (97% in Europe and 3% in Japan). 24 
patients were randomised in Japan centers and are included in the FAS. The DCO date for the primary 
analysis was 22 March 2019. 
Of the 806 patients randomised into the study, 535 olaparib patients and 267 placebo patients received 
study treatment in addition to bevacizumab; 2 patients randomised to the olaparib/bevacizumab arm and 
Assessment report

2 patients randomised to the placebo/bevacizumab arm did not receive olaparib or placebo. A higher 
proportion of patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm (27.7%) completed the protocol-specified 2 years 
of treatment than in the placebo/bevacizumab arm (19.9%). 61.9% patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab 
arm discontinued olaparib, and 72.7% patients in the placebo/bevacizumab arm discontinued placebo. 
The most common reason for discontinuation of olaparib or placebo was disease progression as per 
RECIST criteria; this was lower in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm (34.0%) than in the 
placebo/bevacizumab arm (58.1%). A higher proportion of patients discontinued olaparib due to AEs 
(20.4%) than placebo (4.9%). A similar and low proportion of patients in both arms discontinued olaparib 
or placebo for any other reason: for most of these patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm (13/19 
patients) and all of the patients in the placebo bevacizumab arm (6/6 patients), the reason was patient 
decision.  
Patients randomised were overall representative of the intended target population. Demographic and 
baseline characteristics were balanced between both arms in the ITT population and in the biomarker-
defined sub-groups by tBRCAm (prospectively and retrospectively defined), GIS and HRD status (defined 
in this study by a combination of both biomarkers). 
Median age overall was 61 years, which is consistent with the expected median age of an advanced 
ovarian cancer patient population not selected for gBRCA mutation. The majority of patients were FIGO 
Stage IIIC, had high-grade serous histology, and had an ECOG performance status of 0 across both 
treatment arms. 30% of patients were Stage IV. The majority of patients had normal CA-125 at study 
entry.  
In total, 747 patients (92.7%) underwent debulking surgery prior to randomisation. The timing and 
outcome of debulking surgery was well balanced across both treatment arms. Stratification factors, as 
randomised or per eCRF (occurrence of some discrepancies), were well balanced between treatment 
arms.  
All randomised patients had a prior platinum-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab regimen at baseline. 
The majority of patients had received between 4 and 9 cycles of platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy, 
with 62.8% of patients having received 6 cycles. All patients received a minimum of 5 cycles of platinum 
chemotherapy; 1 patient received >9 cycles of platinum chemotherapy. All patients had received a 
minimum of 2 cycles of bevacizumab prior to randomisation.  
At study entry, approximately 29.4% of patients had local tBRCAm status and 70.6% of patients had 
non-BRCAm status (wild type or variant of uncertain significance or inconclusive/unknown status). 
Demographic and baseline characteristics in the biomarker sub-groups were consistent with those in the 
ITT population. 
Post randomisation testing using the Myriad myChoice HRD Plus test was performed to determine Myriad 
tBRCAm status, HRRm status and Myriad HRD status. Genomic instability score (GIS) was also 
determined and considered with tBRCAm for determination of the positive Myriad HRD status (tBRCAm 
and/or positive GIS). In accordance with two GIS cut-offs (≥42 or ≥33), two different cut-offs (≥42 or 
≥33) were used to assign HRD positive status in PAOLA-1 (Myriad HRD status 42 and 33 cut-offs). Myriad 
biomarker status was available for 97% of randomised patients (782/806 patients, for 24 patients no 
sample sent). 93.7% of patients (755/806 patients) had a Myriad tBRCA and HRR results available (for 27 
patients test failed) and 82.4% (664/806 patients) had an available Myriad HRD status. The proportion of 
Myriad tBRCA mutations, HRR mutations and Myriad HRD status was well balanced between treatment 
arms. The overall agreement between screening tBRCA and Myriad tBRCA was 96.3% (701/728 patients). 
29.2% of patients (235/806) were tBRCAm and 64.5% of patients (520/806) were non-tBRCAm by 
Myriad testing. Only a low proportion of patients (6.7% or 54/806) were Myriad HRRm excluding 
tBRCAm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/523504/2020 
Page 84/150 
 
 
  
  
Using the Myriad HRD status 42 and 33 cut-offs, 48.0% and 54.2% of overall patient population, 
respectively, were considered Myriad HRD positive. In addition to tBRCAm patients within these groups, 
measuring of GIS by Myriad test allowed to include patients with positive GIS (≥42 or ≥33). Therefore, 
18.9% of overall patient population were defined as Myriad HRD (42) positive excluding Myriad tBRCAm 
patients (also called ‘GIS positive’ within ‘HRD positive’ group) and 25.1% were Myriad HRD (33) positive 
excluding Myriad tBRCAm patients. Hence, biomarkers of homologous recombination deficiency (tBRCAm 
and HR-associated genomic instability) can both define HRD status, which in PAOLA-1 was defined as by 
combining both detection of tBRCAm and positive GIS, resulting in about half of patient population 
defined as HRD-positive. 
Central gBRCA testing was performed only for patients at study sites in France. gBRCA status was 
available for half of the patients (404/806 [50.1%]). Of these, 120/404 (29.7%) patients were gBRCAm. 
The proportion of sBRCAm (8.6%) is in line with that expected in first line ovarian cancer.  
All efficacy and HRQoL data were analysed using the FAS on an ITT basis (FAS=806).  
Primary endpoint 
The study met its primary objective. The investigator assessed PFS showed a statistically significant 
improvement in patients treated with olaparib compared with placebo when added to bevacizumab with a 
41% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death (58.8% maturity, HR 0.59; 95%CI (0.49;0.72) 
p-value <0.0001). The median PFS showed a difference of 5.5 months favouring olaparib/bevacizumab 
arm (22.1 months vs 16.6 months). Based on KM analysis estimations, 46.0% of the patients in the 
olaparib/bevacizumab arm remained progression free at 2 years compared with 27.7% of the patients in 
the placebo/bevacizumab arm. The majority of patients in both arms progressed due to developing new 
lesions.  
The results of the BICR PFS analysis were consistent with the primary analysis. The estimates of median 
PFS were longer by BICR than by investigator (26 vs 22 months, respectively, for olaparib/bevacizumab; 
18.3 vs 16.6 months, respectively, for placebo/ bevacizumab). However, HR and p values were similar 
(HR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.51–0.77; p <0.0001).  
Overall, there was 82% concordance between investigator and central reviews in progression. 
Nevertheless, there was a difference in the rate of patients who had progressed by investigator but not 
according to BICR (67 patients (12.5%) in olaparib arm and 57 patients (21.2%) in placebo arm) 
between treatment arms (informative censoring). The potential impact of informative censoring was 
assessed through a sensitivity analysis based on BICR where informatively censored patients were 
assumed to have an event 24 weeks after time of censoring. Results were consistent with those of the 
investigator assessed PFS analysis. 
Of note, differences in early discrepancy rate (-0.03) and late discrepancy rate (0.04) were observed 
between treatment arms. The negative discordance in EDR and positive discordance in LDR may indicate 
investigator bias in favour of olaparib/bevacizumab arm, however they did not reach the threshold of 
0.075.  
Evaluation-time bias analysis results for PFS were in line with those of the primary analysis. A descriptive 
analysis about compliance with scheduled evaluations by treatment arm was provided. The proportion of 
patients  with  at  least  one  visit  off-schedule  was  higher  in  the  olaparib  arm  than  in  the  placebo  arm 
(difference  of  9%).  The  MAH  have  provided  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  timing of  RECIST  assessments  to 
explain this difference (data not shown). This is likely due to the fact that the number of assessments per 
patient in the olaparib arm was higher than on the placebo arm due to longer PFS (19% difference). 
The MAH also provided a sensitivity analysis censoring patients who missed at least one RECIST assessment 
at the time of the latest evaluable RECIST assessment without previous missed visits (data not shown). 
Results were consistent with the primary analysis.

Secondary endpoints 
At  DCO  of  22  March  2019,  the  investigator  assessed  PFS2  data  were  39.1%  mature  (315  events/806 
patients)  with  63.5%  of  patients  in  the  olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  vs  55.8%  of  patients  in  the 
placebo/bevacizumab  arm  not  having  had  second  progression.  Median  PFS2  was  32.3  months  in  the 
olaparib/bevacizumab arm and 30.1 months in the placebo/bevacizumab arm (HR=0.86 [0.69; 1.09], p-
value=0.2).  In  both  treatment  arms,  the  majority  of  progression  events  were  based  on  radiological 
assessment.  Symptomatic  progression  and  progression  by  CA-125  events  were  a  minority.  The  interim 
analysis  of  PFS2  indicates  a  slightly  better  outcome,  not  statistically  significant,  favouring  olaparib/ 
bevacizumab arm. Nevertheless, PFS2 analysis is considered immature, and results are not conclusive. 
The  interim  OS  analysis  is  considered  extremely  immature  (209  events;  25.9%  mature)  with  a  similar 
proportion of patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm and in the placebo/bevacizumab arm (70.8% vs 
71.4% respectively) in survival follow-up. The median OS was 39.4 months in the olaparib/bevacizumab 
arm and was not reached in the placebo/bevacizumab arm with a HR of 1.01 (95%CI 0.76, 1.36) p=0.9270. 
At the DCO of 30 September 2019, the updated OS analysis shows a HR of 0.94 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.21) in 
the ITT population.  
PFS2 and OS were key secondary endpoints. The next planned analysis of PFS2 and OS was to be performed 
when  the  PFS2  data  were  approximately  53%  mature  (approximately  427  events)  or  after  a  maximum 
duration of one year post primary analysis PFS DCO, whichever occurs first. The DCO was set as 22 March 
2020 which is one year post PFS analysis. The MAH is recommended to submit the updated data for PFS2 
and OS estimated to be in December 2020 and the final OS data when available (planned in March 2022) 
(REC).   
In the placebo/bevacizumab arm, 20.4% of patients received PARPi as a first subsequent therapy compared 
to 5.2% in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm. This may have a confounding effect on OS and PFS2 analysis. 
Additional analysis adjusting for impact of subsequent PARP inhibitor treatment will be provided with the 
updated and final analyses (REC). 
No multiplicity adjustment was applied on secondary exploratory efficacy endpoints including TFST, TSST, 
and TDT. There was a delay in TFST in favour of olaparib/bevacizumab arm in line with the benefit observed 
in PFS (HR: 0.58, 95%CI: 0.48; 0.7, 2-sided p-value<0.0001). The median value was 24.8 months in the 
olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  compared  with  18.5  months  in  the placebo/bevacizumab  arm.  The numerical 
improvement obtained in TSST and TDT is considered limited. The 95% interval confidence of median values 
overlapped. It should be noted that, at the beginning of the treatment (up to 9 months), there was a higher 
rate of treatment discontinuation in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm compared to placebo/bevacizumab.  
The main endpoint for HRQoL analysis in the study was EORTC QLQ-C30. Overall, there was no meaningful 
difference between the treatment arms in average change over the 24-month treatment period in QLQ-C30 
global health status/QoL score using MMRM (estimated difference: 0.59, 95% CI-1.399, 2.57, p=0.5626). 
Although PRO assessment was a secondary endpoint, there was no multiplicity adjustment and this analysis 
is considered as exploratory. Therefore, the inclusion of PRO data in the SmPC is not accepted. 
Patients  have  been  stratified  by  tBRCAm  status,  based  on  the  prospectively  conducted  tumour  tissue 
testing.  As  expected,  the  magnitude  of  treatment  effect  was  notable  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with 
deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations, with HR (95% CI) of 0.34 (0.23, 0.51) and clinically relevant difference in 
median  PFS:  37.2  months  and  22  months  in  olaparib/bevacizumab  and  placebo/bevacizumab  arms, 
respectively.  The  extent  of  treatment  effect  was  much  lower  in  the  non-tBRCAm  patients  compared  to 
tBRCAm  patients  with  median  PFS  of  19  months  and  16  months  (HR  (95%  CI)  0.7  (0.57,  0.86))  in 
olaparib/bevacizumab and placebo/bevacizumab arms respectively. The subgroup analysis by tBRCA status 
by Myriad was consistent with this analysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/523504/2020 
Page 86/150 
 
 
  
  
 
In the tBRCAm subgroup based on test result at randomisation, the OS HR point estimate was reported as 
0.66 (95% CI 0.37 to 1.21), while in non-tBRCAm subgroup it was 1.02 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.36) (DCO 30 
September 2019). In line with analysis in these prospectively defined subgroups, in exploratory subgroups 
by mutation status determined retrospectively by Myriad test, the OS HR point estimate was 0.61 (95% CI 
0.34  to  1.09)  in  the  Myriad  tBRCAm  subgroup  while  it  was  1.04  (95%  CI  0.77  to  1.4)  in  non-tBRCAm 
subgroup (DCO 30 September 2019). 
Similarly, an inconsistency in treatment effect was observed in subgroup analysis based on retrospectively 
analysed samples to determine tumour Myriad HRD status combining tBRCAm status and HRD score (GIS, 
genomic  instability  score).  This  analysis  is  however  pre-specified  in  the  SAP.  Patients  were  classified  as 
having Myriad HRD positive or Myriad HRD negative tumours using a combination of positive or negative 
BRCAm status and Myriad GIS/HRD score (≥ 42/ 33 for positive, <42/33 for negative). For the remaining 
patients,  such  combined  HRD  status  was  considered  unknown.  A  large  differential  benefit  in  PFS  was 
observed in the following subgroups: (1) Subgroup of patients classified as Myriad HRD positive at two cut-
offs 42 and 33 (either tBRCAm or GIS/HRD score ≥ cut-off). With the GIS score cut-off 42, HR was 0.33 
[0.25, 0.45]; median PFS 37 months in olaparib vs 17 months in placebo arm; (2) Subgroup of patients 
classified  as  overall  tumour  biomarker  status  positive  (patients  identified  by  biomarkers  associated  with 
HRD: tBRCAm or HRRm or Myriad HRD (≥ 42 or 33) tumours): HR of 0.38 [0.29, 0.50].  
However,  absence  of  effect  on  PFS  was  reported  in  the  following  subgroups:  (1)  Subgroup  of  patients 
classified  as  Myriad  HRD  negative  at  two  cut-offs  (HRD  score<cut-off  in  absence  of  tBRCAm):  HR=1.00 
[0.75; 1.35], median PFS 16.4 months in olaparib vs 16.5 months in placebo arm; (2) Subgroup of patients 
classified as overall tumour biomarker status negative (negative status for biomarkers associated with HRD: 
absence of tBRCAm and HRRm and Myriad HRD (≥ 42 or 33) tumours): HR of 0.94 [0.69, 1.27] median 
PFS 16.6 months in olaparib vs 16.2 months in placebo arm. 
Consistently with data observed in patients without determined tBRCAm and supported by biological 
plausibility, the updated OS analysis do not allow to exclude a detrimental effect in the HRD-negative 
subgroup. In the 30 September 2019 DCO analysis, the OS HR point estimate was 0.71 (95% CI 0.47 to 
1.10) in the HRD-positive subgroup and 1.11 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.65) in the HRD-negative subgroup. KM 
plots separate late in the HRD-negative subgroup in favour of bevacizumab/placebo arm. Though 
acknowledging limitations related to data immaturity, it cannot be excluded that treatment with the 
combination bevacizumab+olaparib in the first line setting in ovarian cancer patients whose tumours are 
defined as HRD-negative may be associated with poorer OS.  
Post-hoc analyses using only the Genomic Instability Score (GIS)/HRD score at cut-off 42, have shown 
results in the GIS positive subgroup consistent to those in the HRD positive subgroup. 
It is noted that a GIS or HRD test is not available to date in Europe and different cut-offs are used across 
different PARPi studies. However, a greater treatment effect was consistently observed across several 
trials using predefined cut-off for GIS (42) as used for Myriad HRD test. There is also a biological rational 
supporting genomic instability as a biomarker predicting magnitude of PARPi activity. 
Overall, efficacy can only be considered established in patients identified as HR deficient based on 
biomarkers associated with HRD (BRCAm, HR deficiency-associated genomic instability and combination 
thereof). In patients without defined positivity for combined biomarker (HRD-negative patients), the 
overall efficacy data do not support that benefits outweigh risks. The indication has been restricted to 
patient population whose tumour are associated with HR deficiency defined by biomarkers (tBRCAm 
and/or genomic instability).

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
PAOLA-1 met its primary objective, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in PFS (HR 0.59 
[0.49; 0.72] p<0.0001) in the ITT population for olaparib vs placebo when added to bevacizumab in the 
maintenance setting in patients with newly-diagnosed ovarian cancer who are not selected by HRD 
biomarker status. However, patients defined as biomarker-positive (tBRCAm, GIS, HRD status positive 
defined as tBRCAm and/or GIS positive) derived most of the benefit.  
The magnitude of treatment effect was large in the subgroup of patients with deleterious BRCA1/2 
mutations and higher genomic instability scores with pre-defined cut-off (HRD-positive), with HR (95% 
CI) of 0.33 (0.25, 0.45); with a clinically relevant difference in median PFS: 37.2 months vs 17 months in 
olaparib/bevacizumab and placebo/bevacizumab arms, respectively. However, the treatment effect was 
absent in the HRD-negative patients with median PFS of 16.4 months and 16.5 months in 
olaparib/bevacizumab and placebo/bevacizumab arms respectively (HR (95% CI) 1.00 [0.75; 1.35]).  
Furthermore, there is an indication of detrimental effect on OS, observed in subgroups without defined 
positivity for biomarkers associated with homologous recombination deficiency, including HR deficiency-
associated genomic instability as a biomarker for predicting PARPi activity. It is noted that an HRD test is 
not available to date in Europe and different cut-offs are used across different PARPi studies for genomic 
instability score. However, a greater treatment effect in BRCAm and HRD-positive patients, was 
consistently observed across these trials using Myriad HRD test when considering a pre-defined cut-off 
(42).  
Overall, efficacy can only be considered established in patients whose cancer is associated with HR 
deficiency defined by biomarkers (tBRCAm and/or genomic instability) and identified as biomarker-
positive. 
Data for PFS2 and OS are still immature with no clear benefit reported in interim analysis. The MAH is 
recommended to provide updated and final analyses as soon as available (REC).

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Across the entire clinical program, as of 15 June 2019, approximately 11919 patients are estimated to have 
received treatment with olaparib. The focus of this application is the PAOLA-1 study, where olaparib 300 
mg (or placebo) bd was given in addition to bevacizumab as a maintenance treatment for patients with 
newly-diagnosed advanced (FIGO Stage IIIB-IV) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer and were in response following first line treatment, with platinum-taxane chemotherapy 
and bevacizumab.  
Supportive safety data were provided from a pool of patients who were intended to receive olaparib 300 mg 
bd as a monotherapy in the MAH-sponsored studies. 
Table 37: Number of patients in the 300 mg bd pool (as of DCO 15 June 2019) 
 Patient exposure 
Overall extent of exposure: PAOLA-1 
All  except  4  of  the  806  randomised  patients  in  PAOLA-1  received  study  treatment  (2  patients  in  the 
olaparib/bevacizumab arm and 2 patients in the placebo/bevacizumab arm). At the DCO, the majority of 
Assessment report

patients in the safety analysis set (SAS) had discontinued olaparib or placebo treatment (331 [61.9%] of 
535  olaparib/bevacizumab-treated  patients  and  194  [72.7%]  of  267  placebo/bevacizumab-treated 
patients). It should be noted that study treatment discontinuation reasons were only collected for olaparib 
or placebo and not for bevacizumab.  
As per protocol, olaparib or placebo treatment was stopped after 2 years of exposure. The proportion of 
patients who had completed the maximum 2 year treatment period was higher in the olaparib/bevacizumab 
arm  (148  [27.7%]  of  535  patients)  compared  with  the  placebo/bevacizumab  arm  (53  [19.9%]  of 
267 patients). At the time of DCO, 56 (10.5%) patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm and 20 (7.5%) 
patients in the placebo/bevacizumab arm remained on (olaparib or placebo) study treatment. 
The most common reason for discontinuation in both treatment arms was disease progression, although 
the proportion of patients discontinuing due to disease progression was lower in the olaparib/bevacizumab 
arm  (182  [34.0%]  of  535  patients)  compared  with  the  placebo/bevacizumab  arm  (155  [58.1%]  of  267 
patients). 
A higher proportion of patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm had discontinued for an AE, compared with 
the  placebo/bevacizumab  arm  (109  [20.4%]  of  535  patients  versus  153  [5.6%]  of  267  patients, 
respectively).

Table 39: PAOLA-1: duration of olaparib or placebo exposure (SAS) 
In general, toxicity observed during the course of the study could be managed by dose interruptions and 
reductions; reduction to 250 mg bd as a first step and further reduction to 200 mg bd as a second step, 
with no dose re-escalations allowed. 
For  patients  who  were  able  to  stay  on  treatment  (i.e.,  did  not  discontinue  due  to  progression  or  other 
reasons), the majority received the 300 mg bd dose (throughout the duration of the study). For the majority 
of patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab treatment arm, olaparib dose reductions were not required (first 
dose reduction was to 250 mg bd [i.e., 500 mg total daily dose]; second dose reduction was to 200 mg bd 
[i.e., 400 mg total daily dose]) with AEs in most patients being managed through dose interruptions. The 
majority of dose reductions occurred in the first 3 months of treatment.

Adverse events  
Overview of AE 
Table 43: PAOLA-1: Number (%) of patients who had at least 1 AE in any category (SAS) 
The  majority  of  AE  were  reported  during  the  combination  period,  with  most  events  occurring  early  in 
treatment. In the olaparib/bevacizumab arm, 531 (99.3%) patients reported a total of 5970 AEs across the 
overall study duration, 4719 of these 5970 (79.0%) AEs were reported during the combination period. For 
the  placebo/bevacizumab  arm,  256  (95.9%)  patients  reported  a  total  of  2304  AEs,  with  1812  of  2304 
(78.6%) AEs reported during the combination period. 
The safety profile of olaparib/bevacizumab in non-tBRCAm and tBRCAm patients was similar to that of the 
SAS (data not shown).  
Comparison with olaparib 300mg bd pool 
As shown in the table below, the proportions of patients with SAEs, AEs leading to treatment (olaparib) 
discontinuation, CTCAE Grade ≥3 AEs, DAEs, AEs leading to dose reduction and AEs leading to treatment 
interruption were higher for the olaparib/bevacizumab arm of PAOLA-1 compared with the 300 mg bd pool.

groups) in PAOLA-1 and the 300 mg bd pool 
Table 45: PAOLA-1: Most commonly reported AEs (occurring in >10%) of patients in either 
treatment group (SAS) 
The largest differences in incidence between the two arms for the overall study duration were for the AEs 
of  nausea  and  anaemia  (incidence  difference  of  31.6  and  30.8  percentage  points  respectively).  AEs  of 
fatigue, lymphopenia and vomiting were also reported at a higher incidence (an incidence difference of ≥10 
percentage points) for patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm compared with the placebo/bevacizumab 
arm. All of the AEs reported with a higher incidence of ≥10% for patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm, 
compared with the placebo/bevacizumab arm are known ADRs for olaparib.

Other AEs which occurred more frequently in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm (a higher incidence of ≥5 to 
10  percentage  points  in  the  olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  compared  with  the  placebo/bevacizumab  arm; 
overall  study  duration)  were:  dysgeusia  and  leukopenia.  Dysgeusia  is  a  known  ADR  for  olaparib  and 
leukopenia is a known ADR for both olaparib and bevacizumab. There were no AEs which occurred more 
frequently  (a  higher  incidence  of  ≥5  percentage  points)  in  the  olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  that  are  not 
currently listed as ADRs for either olaparib alone or both olaparib and bevacizumab. 
AEs which occurred less frequently in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm (a lower incidence of ≥5 percentage 
points  in  the  olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  compared  with  the  placebo/bevacizumab  arm)  were  proteinuria 
and hypertension (both listed as ADRs for bevacizumab). 
Comparison with olaparib 300mg bd pool 
Table 46: Most commonly reported AEs (occurring in >10% of patients) in PAOLA-1 or the 300

The only common (≥30% of patients) AE reported in PAOLA-1 but not consistently reported in the 
300 mg bd pool was hypertension (45.8% of olaparib/bevacizumab patients in PAOLA-1 compared with 
2.6% of patients in the 300 mg bd pool); hypertension is a known ADR for bevacizumab. 
Of the AEs reported with an incidence of ≥10% in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm of PAOLA-1 or the 
300 mg bd pool, AEs of hypertension, lymphopenia, fatigue, leukopenia, arthralgia and urinary tract 
infection were reported at a higher incidence (≥5 percentage points difference) in the

olaparib/bevacizumab arm of PAOLA-1 compared with the 300 mg bd pool. All of these terms are either 
known ADRs for bevacizumab, or are symptoms commonly reported in an ovarian cancer population. 
Adverse events by treatment period 
The majority of AEs first occurred within the first 3 months of treatment. Data for the most common (≥10% 
of patients) in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm are presented in the table below.

Deaths 
Table 50: PAOLA-1: all deaths (FAS) 
Two of the 4 patients in the placebo/bevacizumab arm who died as a result of an AE were in the combination 
phase  of  the  study.  The  remaining  2  patients  in  the  placebo/bevacizumab  arm,  and  the  patient  in  the 
olaparib/bevacizumab arm who died as a result of an AE were in the monotherapy phase of the study (i.e., 
after discontinuation of bevacizumab treatment). 
For twelve patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm, death was not considered due to disease progression 
only. There was one additional case in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm, the primary cause of death was first 
reported by the investigator as disease progression due to pancreas carcinoma (second primary tumour), 
and not due to her underlying cancer.

Serious adverse event 
Table 52: PAOLA-1: SAEs occurring in ≥1% patients in either treatment group (SAS) 
Comparison with olaparib 300mg bd pool 
There was an increased incidence of SAEs in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm of PAOLA-1, compared with the 
300 mg bd pool. This increased incidence appeared to be largely caused by an increased incidence of SAEs 
of  hypertension  (which  occurred  at  a  frequency  of  9.0%  in  the  olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  of  PAOLA-1, 
compared with no SAEs in the 300 mg bd pool). The most common (≥2% of patients) SAE of anaemia in 
the olaparib 300 mg bd pool was reported at a similar frequency in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm of PAOLA-
Most other SAEs were reported in fewer than 2 patients in each arm of PAOLA-1.

Adverse drug reactions  
Lynparza has been associated with adverse reactions generally of mild or moderate severity (CTCAE 
grade 1 or 2) and generally not requiring treatment discontinuation. The most frequently observed 
adverse reactions across clinical trials in patients receiving Lynparza monotherapy (≥ 10%) were nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, fatigue, headache, dysgeusia, decreased appetite, dizziness, cough, 
dyspnoea, anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia.  
The Grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions occurring in > 2% of patients were anaemia (17%), neutropenia (6%), 
fatigue/asthenia (5%), leukopenia (3%), thrombocytopenia (3%) and vomiting (2%). 
Adverse reactions that most commonly led to dose interruptions and/ or reductions in monotherapy were 
anaemia (16.2%), vomiting (6.8%), nausea (6.2%), neutropenia (6.2%) and fatigue/asthenia (6.0%). 
Adverse reactions that most commonly led to permanent discontinuation were anaemia (1.8%), 
fatigue/asthenia (0.7%), nausea (0.7%) and thrombocytopenia (0.7%). 
When Lynparza is used in combination with bevacizumab the safety profile is generally consistent with 
that of the individual therapies. 
Adverse events led to dose interruption and/ or reduction of olaparib in 57.4% of patients when used in 
combination with bevacizumab and led to permanent discontinuation of treatment with 
olaparib/bevacizumab and placebo/bevacizumab in 20.4% and 5.6% of patients, respectively. The 
adverse reactions that most commonly led to dose interruption and/or reduction were anaemia (20.6%) 
and nausea (7.5%). The adverse reactions that most commonly led to permanent discontinuation were 
anaemia (3.6%), nausea (3.4%) and fatigue/asthenia (1.5%). 
The safety profile is based on pooled data from 2351 patients with solid tumours treated with Lynparza 
monotherapy in clinical trials at the recommended dose.

Haematological toxicity 
In clinical studies with the tablet formulation, the incidence of anaemia adverse reactions was 40.8% 
(CTCAE grade ≥3 18.1%) and the incidences of dose interruptions, reductions and discontinuations for 
anaemia were 17.7%, 12.2% and 2.5%, respectively; 22.6% of patients treated with olaparib needed 
one or more blood transfusions. An exposure-response relationship between olaparib and decreases in 
haemoglobin has been demonstrated. In clinical studies with Lynparza the incidence of CTCAE grade ≥ 2 
shifts (decreases) from baseline in haemoglobin was 23%, absolute neutrophils 19%, platelets 6%, 
lymphocytes 29% and leucocytes 20% (all % approximate).

The incidence of elevations in mean corpuscular volume from low or normal at baseline to above the ULN 
was approximately 58%. 
Anaemia 
Table 55: PAOLA-1 and the 300 mg bd pool: patients who had at least one AE of anaemia 
(grouped term) reported in any category 
In more than half of cases, anaemia events were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Events rarely led to permanent 
discontinuation of treatment. In the olaparib/bevacizumab arm, 28 of the 93 patients with CTCAE Grade 
≥ 3 AEs of anaemia (single PT) were SAEs and 3 patients had a CTCAE Grade 4 AE that were SAEs. Olaparib 
treatment was interrupted and the dose subsequently reduced in 2 of the 3 patients with CTCAE Grade 4 
AEs  of  anaemia,  treatment  was  permanently  discontinued  in  the  remaining  patient.  All  3  patients  with 
CTCAE Grade 4 AE received treatment for the AEs, and AEs in all 3 patients were reported as recovered, 
with durations ranging from 7 days to 48 days. 
Onset of anaemia was early, generally in the first 3 months of starting olaparib (median time to first onset 
was 1.54 months), although the risk of developing anaemia remained fairly constant throughout exposure 
with no evidence of cumulative effect. 
The  majority  (209  of  219  patients)  of  first  events  with  olaparib/bevacizumab  resolved  (median  time  to 
resolution 1.41 months for first event.) 
Regarding  laboratory  abnormalities  for  haemoglobin,  no  patients  in  PAOLA-1  had  CTCAE  Grade  4 
haemoglobin values during the study; 12.5% of olaparib/bevacizumab-treated patients had reductions to 
CTCAE Grade 3 haemoglobin values. 
In the olaparib/bevacizumab arm, 112 (51.1%) of 219 patients with AEs of anaemia (grouped term) were 
treated for the AE compared with 3 (11.1%) of 27 patients in the placebo/bevacizumab arm. 
In the olaparib/bevacizumab arm of PAOLA-1, 94 (17.6%) patients received a blood transfusion. A total of 
26 (4.9%) patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm had more than 1 transfusion of either whole blood or 
packed red blood cells (PRBCs) after the start of study treatment; the majority of these occurred in the first 
4 months on study treatment. Thirty (5.6%) olaparib/bevacizumab-treated patients had an erythropoiesis 
stimulating agent.

Neutropenia 
Table 56: PAOLA-1 and the 300 mg bd pool: patients who had at least one AE of neutropenia 
(grouped term) reported in any category 
These events were predominantly Grade 1 or 2 in severity and rarely led to permanent discontinuation of 
treatment. No patients in either treatment arm had AEs of febrile neutropenia occurring on treatment. In 
the follow-up period, 4 (0.7%) patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm had AEs of febrile neutropenia 3 
of the 4 patients had CTCAE Grade 3 AEs, 1 patient had a CTCAE Grade 4 AE. All 4 patients were treated 
for the event. 
Onset of AEs was 5 to 18 days after the last dose of olaparib. Five patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab 
arm and 2 patients in the placebo/bevacizumab arm had AEs of febrile neutropenia that occurred in the 
post follow-up period. There were no patients with AEs of neutropenic infection or neutropenic sepsis in 
PAOLA-1. 
In the olaparib/bevacizumab arm, 5 of the 34 patients with CTCAE Grade ≥3 AEs of neutropenia were SAEs.  
There  was  no  association  between  the  development  of  neutropenia  and  the  length  of  time  on 
olaparib/bevacizumab  treatment;  AEs  of  neutropenia  were  reported  throughout  the  study  period  in  the 
olaparib/bevacizumab-treated arm (median time to onset of first event was 1.31 months); the majority (94 
of 97 patients) of events with olaparib/bevacizumab resolved (median time to resolution of 0.72 months 
for first event). A small proportion of patients in each treatment arm received colony stimulating factors (4 
patients [0.7%] in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm and 3 patients [1.1%] in the placebo/bevacizumab arm). 
The AE category table for  the 300 mg bd pool showed a consistent pattern of AEs when compared with 
olaparib/bevacizumab data from PAOLA-1.  
Regarding abnormalities data of neutrophils, the majority (534 [93.6 %] patients) of olaparib/bevacizumab-
treated patients in PAOLA- 1 had a maximum CTCAE Grade ≤2 reported for absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 
values; 97.4% (260 of 267 patients) of patients in the placebo/bevacizumab arm also had CTCAE Grade 
≤2 ANC during the PAOLA-1 study. 
Of the patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm with AEs of neutropenia, 8 (8.2%) of 97 patients were 
treated for the AE compared with 4 (9.5%) of 42 patients in the placebo/bevacizumab arm. 
Colony  stimulating  factor  use  in  the  olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  was  rare  (4  patients  [0.7%]  in  the 
olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  and  3  patients  [1.1%]  in  the  placebo/bevacizumab  arm  received  colony 
stimulating factors.

Thrombocytopenia 
AEs of thrombocytopenia were reported for a higher percentage of patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab 
arm  compared  with  the  placebo/bevacizumab  arm.  These  events  were  predominantly  Grade  1  or  2  in 
severity and none led to permanent discontinuation of treatment. The proportion of patients with AEs in 
the  grouped  term  of  haemorrhagic  events  and  wound healing  complications  were  similar  between the  2 
treatment arms in PAOLA-1. 
A grouped term analysis of haemorrhage events in PAOLA-1 showed that 52 (9.7%) of 535 patients in the 
olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  had  a  total  of  65  AEs.  In  the  placebo/bevacizumab  arm  28  (10.5%)  of  267 
patients  had  a  total  of  36  AEs.  The  majority  of  these  AEs  were  CTCAE  Grade  ≤2  AEs;  only  3  (0.6%) 
olaparib/bevacizumab-treated  patients  and  2  (0.7%)  placebo/bevacizumab-treated  patients  had  CTCAE 
Grade ≥3 AEs. 
Three (0.6%) patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm and 2 (0.7%) patients in the placebo/bevacizumab 
arm had haemorrhage events that were SAEs. The SAEs in olaparib/bevacizumab arm were all CTCAE Grade 
3 and none were considered related to olaparib by the investigator.  
There  was  no  association  between  the  development  of  thrombocytopenia  and  the  length  of  time  on 
olaparib/bevacizumab treatment. First onset of AEs of thrombocytopenia were reported throughout the first 
12 months of study period in the olaparib/bevacizumab-treated arm (median time to first onset was 1.41 
months); the majority (42 of 43 patients) of events with olaparib resolved (median time to resolution of 
first event of 0.82 month).  
Table 57: PAOLA-1 and the 300 mg bd pool: patients who had at least one AE of 
thrombocytopenia (grouped term) reported in any category 
Regarding abnormalities data of decreased platelet count, the majority of patients had a maximum CTCAE 
Grade of ≤2 reported for platelet values throughout treatment. A low proportion of olaparib/bevacizumab-
treated patients (12 patients [2.2%]) had CTCAE Grade ≥3 reductions in platelet count during the study; 
no patients in the placebo/bevacizumab arm had a CTCAE Grade ≥3 reduction in platelet count. 
A similar proportion of patients in each arm (5 [11.6%] of 43 olaparib/bevacizumab-treated patients and 1 
[11.1%]  of  9  placebo/bevacizumab-treated  patients)  were  treated  for  AEs  of  thrombocytopenia.  Five 
olaparib/bevacizumab-treated  patients  (0.9%)  received  a  platelet  transfusion,  compared  with  1  (0.4%) 
patient in the placebo/bevacizumab arm.

Lymphopenia 
Table 58: PAOLA-1 and the 300 mg bd pool: patients who had at least one AE of lymphopenia 
(grouped term) reported in any category 
The incidence of all AEs and CTCAE Grade ≥3 AEs of lymphopenia in the 300 mg bd pool was lower when 
compared with olaparib/bevacizumab data from PAOLA-1. The proportion of patients with AEs and CTCAE 
Grade ≥3 AEs of lymphocyte count reductions were higher for the olaparib/bevacizumab arm of PAOLA-1 
compared with the 300 mg bd pool; however, the proportion of patients with laboratory values showing 
grade  changes  to  CTCAE  Grade  ≥3  in  lymphocyte  count  in  the  olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  of  PAOLA-1 
(9.4%) was lower than that observed in the 300 mg bd pool (261 [16.7%] of 1563 patients and similar to 
that observed in SOLO1 (15 of 231 patients [6.5%]). When compared with the tablet pool, the incidence 
of  lymphopenia  was  higher  (grouped  terms:  any  AE,  23.6%;  any  AE  of  CTCAE,  ≥3,  7.1%);  however, 
laboratory values for lymphocytes were consistent between PAOLA-1 and the tablet pool. 
There  was  no  association  between  the  development  of  lymphopenia  and  the  length  of  time  on 
olaparib/bevacizumab treatment (median time to first onset was 2.64 months); the majority (116 of 126 
patients)  of  events  with  olaparib/bevacizumab  resolved  (median  time  to  resolution  of  first  event  of  0.9 
months). Two (1.6%) of the 126 olaparib/bevacizumab-treated patients with lymphopenia were treated for 
the AE, compared with 2 (8.0%) of the 25 placebo/bevacizumab-treated patients. 
Regarding  laboratory  data,  the  majority  of  patients  in  PAOLA-1  had  a  maximum  CTCAE  Grade  of  ≤2 
reported for low lymphocyte laboratory values throughout treatment. The proportion of patients with CTCAE 
Grade ≥3 lymphocyte count reductions was higher for olaparib/bevacizumab-treated patients (50 of 533 
patients [9.4%]) than for the placebo/bevacizumab arm (6 of 267 patients [2.2%]).

Leukopenia 
Table 59: PAOLA-1 and the 300 mg bd pool: patients who had at least one AE of leukopenia 
(grouped term) reported in any category 
There was no association between the development of leukopenia and the length of time on 
olaparib/bevacizumab treatment (median time to onset was 2.10 months); all (95 of 95 patients) patients 
with events of leukopenia in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm resolved (median time to resolution of first 
event was 0.95 months). One patient in each arm with AEs of leukopenia were treated for the AE (1 
[1.1%] of 95 patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm and 1 [3.8%] of 26 patients in the 
placebo/bevacizumab arm).  
Fatigue/asthenia 
Table 60: PAOLA-1 and the 300 mg bd pool: patients who had at least one AE of fatigue or 
asthenia reported in any category 
Fatigue and asthenia on olaparib/bevacizumab treatment were generally reported early, with the majority 
of first events with olaparib/bevacizumab reported within the first 3 months of treatment. Median time to

onset was 0.72 months. The incidence plateaued at around 1 month, suggesting that few first instances 
were reported after these times. 
The majority (220 [77.7%] of 283 patients) of events of fatigue and asthenia with olaparib/bevacizumab 
resolved  (median  time  to  resolution  of 
first  event  of  2.10  months).  A 
low  proportion  of 
olaparib/bevacizumab-treated patients with fatigue and asthenia (6 [2.1%] of 283 patients) were reported 
by the investigator to have received treatment for the event compared with 3 ([3.5%] of 86 patients) in 
the placebo/bevacizumab arm).  
Nausea and vomiting 
Table 61: PAOLA-1 and the 300 mg bd pool: patients who had at least one AE of nausea or 
vomiting reported in any category 
Events of nausea and vomiting were generally reported early in the treatment period (median time to onset 
was 0.16 months and 1.38 months, respectively). The majority (263 of 285 AEs of nausea and 110 of 117 
AEs of vomiting) of events with olaparib/bevacizumab resolved (median time to resolution of first event of 
1.28 months and 0.10 months, respectively). First reports of nausea tended to occur early in treatment 
and  prevalence  of  nausea  events  reduced  from  approximately  0.3%  to  0.2%  in  the  first  6  months  of 
treatment,  to  approximately  0.2%  to  0.1%  from  6  months  onwards.  The  prevalence  of  vomiting  was 
approximately 0.05% for the duration of the study. 
A  total  of  104  (19.4%)  olaparib/bevacizumab-treated  patients  reported  both  nausea  and  vomiting. 
Approximately  half  of  the  olaparib/bevacizumab-treated  patients  with  nausea  (158  [55.4%]  of  285 
patients) were treated for the AE and 58 (49.6%) of 117 patients with vomiting received treatment; lower 
proportions of patients received treatment for nausea and vomiting in the placebo/bevacizumab arm (24 
[41.4%] of 58 patients and 10 [34.5%] of 29 patients, respectively.

Diarrhoea 
Table 62: PAOLA-1 and the 300 mg bd pool: patients who had at least one AE of diarrhoea 
reported in any category 
Events of diarrhoea were generally reported early in the treatment period (median time to onset was 2.25 
months) and the majority (83 of 98 patients) of first events with olaparib/bevacizumab resolved (median 
time  to  resolution  of  first  event  of  0.44  months).  A  similar  proportion  of  patients  in  the 
olaparib/bevacizumab arm with diarrhoea were treated for the AE (44 [44.9%] of 98 patients) compared 
with the placebo/bevacizumab arm (23 [51.1%] of 45 patients). The AE category table for the 300 mg bd 
pool showed a consistent pattern of AEs when compared with olaparib/bevacizumab data from PAOLA-1.  
Increase in creatinine 
The biochemical observations of elevated serum creatinine for olaparib monotherapy treatment were not 
associated  with  renal  impairment  and  without  any  apparent  clinical  sequelae.  The  small  increases  in 
creatinine  observed  with  olaparib  and  the  rapid  onset  of  the  mild  changes  observed,  with  a  return  to 
baseline  after  olaparib  discontinuation  are  consistent  with  the  finding  that  olaparib  is  known  to  be  an 
inhibitor of OCT2 and MATE1. 
In clinical studies with Lynparza the incidence of CTCAE grade ≥ 2 shifts (elevations) from baseline in blood 
creatinine was approximately 11%.

Important potential risks for olaparib 
MDS/AML, pneumonitis and new primary malignancies have been classified in the risk management plan 
as important potential risks. For the majority of studies with olaparib, including PAOLA-1, reports for 
events of MDS/AML and new primary malignancies continue to be collected beyond 30 days after the last 
dose of olaparib: investigators are asked during the regular follow up for OS if the patient had developed 
MDS/AML or a new primary malignancy and prompted to report any cases to the Sponsor. A targeted 
safety questionnaire is also used to collect specific follow-up information on these cases. 
Since MDS/AML, pneumonitis and new primary malignancies occur at low frequency, to improve the 
sensitivity and precision of estimates to characterise these important potential risks, information has been 
drawn from larger pools of olaparib studies. For pneumonitis, in addition to cases from PROfound and the 
300 mg bd pool, cases from the 400 mg bd capsule pool were also presented (i.e., the olaparib 
monotherapy combined therapeutic dose pool). For MDS/AML and new primary malignancies, this pool 
was further extended to include all patients who have received at least 1 dose of olaparib (tablet or 
capsule formulation) as monotherapy treatment in a monotherapy clinical study, at any dose (the 
olaparib monotherapy all doses pool). For MDS/AML and new primary malignancies, these pools are 
supplemented by data from the entire clinical programme to provide a comprehensive assessment of 
these risks. 
Olaparib monotherapy combined therapeutic dose pool (n=2351 patients) consists of all patients who 
have received olaparib monotherapy at the intended therapeutic dose of 300 mg bd for the tablet 
formulation or at the therapeutic dose of 400 mg bd for the capsule formulation (as a continuous dose). 
All patients from the 300 mg bd pool are included in the olaparib monotherapy combined therapeutic dose 
pool. 
Assessment report  
EMA/523504/2020 
Page 116/150 
 
 
  
  
Olaparib monotherapy all doses pool (n=2783 patients) consists of all patients who have received at least 
1 dose of olaparib as a monotherapy treatment (tablet or capsule formulation) at any dose. In addition, 
66 patients from Study 41 are included (a Phase II, open-label, randomised, comparative, multicentre 
study to compare the efficacy and tolerability of olaparib [capsule formulation] in combination with 
paclitaxel and carboplatin versus paclitaxel and carboplatin alone in patients with platinum sensitive 
advanced serous ovarian cancers). All patients from the olaparib monotherapy combined therapeutic dose 
pool are included in the olaparib monotherapy all doses pool. 
The entire clinical programme pool as of 15 June 2019 (n=11919 patients) includes all the studies shown 
in any studies where olaparib is given in combination with other anticancer treatments, investigator-
sponsored studies (ISSs) and data from the MAP. 
Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia 
In  PAOLA-1,  there  were  4  patients  with  events  of  MDS  or  AML  in  the  olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  and 
1 patient with an event of AML in the placebo/bevacizumab arm, which occurred on treatment, within the 
30-day follow-up or in the post-follow-up period.

* As assessed by the investigator. 
The incidence in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm of PAOLA-1 (0.7%) was lower than that seen for olaparib 
in  studies  in  ovarian  cancer  (SOLO1  [1.2%],  SOLO2  [2.1%],  Study  19  [1.5%])  and  consistent  with  the 
incidence  in  the  larger  monotherapy  pool  population  for  the  olaparib  clinical  programme  (1.1%).  The 
incidence  of  MDS/AML  cases  was  similar  among  gBRCA1m  and  gBRCA2m  patients  (1.6%  and  1.0%, 
respectively) in patients treated in clinical trials with Lynparza monotherapy. 
Including all patients exposed to olaparib during clinical development provides data for 11919 patients (as 
of 15 June 2019). In this population, largely composed of ovarian and breast cancer patients, there have 
Assessment report  
EMA/523504/2020 
Page 117/150 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
been 70 reports of MDS/AML out of a total of 11919 patients estimated to have received olaparib in the 
clinical study programme, giving an estimated cumulative incidence of 0.6% for MDS/AML. The 70 reports 
of MDS/AML comprise the 30 reports from the olaparib monotherapy all doses pool, plus reports from 191 
days).  In  4  of  the  30  cases,  patients  died  due  to  other  causes  (progressive  disease  [2  patients],  bone 
marrow transplant complications [1 patient], and disseminated intravascular coagulation [1 patient]). In 6 
cases, MDS/AML was ongoing at the time of reporting and in 2 cases outcome was reported as recovered. 
There  have  also  been  reports  of  MDS/AML  from  post  marketing  surveillance,  consistent  with  the 
characterisation  of  the  events  reported  from  monotherapy  clinical  studies,  the  ongoing  open-label 
monotherapy  studies,  the  ongoing  MAP  programme,  combination  studies  with  olaparib  and  events  from 
placebo-controlled, blinded monotherapy studies.  
Most of the 30 patients with events of MDS/AML in the olaparib monotherapy all doses pool were receiving 
treatment for ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer (n=28), with 2 other events occurring in patients 
with breast cancer. Twenty-six patients had a documented BRCA mutation, 2 patients were gBRCA wildtype 
and in 2 patients, the BRCA mutation status was unknown. 
In 18 of the 30 cases of MDS/AML in the monotherapy pool a fatal outcome was reported, with MDS/AML 
noted as the primary or secondary cause of death. The duration of therapy with olaparib in patients who 
developed  MDS/AML  varied  from  <4.2  months  to  >4.9  years.  The  time  to  death  after  olaparib  was 
discontinued ranged from 17 to 667 days (median 191 days). In 4 of the 30 cases, patients died due to 
other  causes  (progressive  disease  [2  patients],  bone  marrow  transplant  complications  [1  patient],  and 
disseminated  intravascular  coagulation  [1  patient]).  In  6  cases,  MDS/AML  was  ongoing  at  the  time  of 
reporting and in 2 cases outcome was reported as recovered. 
There  have  also  been  reports  of  MDS/AML  from  post  marketing  surveillance,  consistent  with  the 
characterisation of the events reported from monotherapy clinical studies. 
New primary malignancies 
A review of the SOC of “Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified” showed that during treatment, 
9 patients (1.7%) in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm and 3 (1.1%) patients in the placebo/bevacizumab 
arm had events in this SOC. In the post-follow-up period, there were 5 (0.9%) patients in the 
olaparib/bevacizumab arm and 2 (0.2%) patients in the placebo/bevacizumab arm who had events in this 
SOC. 
The following events were excluded for the reasons described below: 
- AEs of MDS/AML were considered separately  
- In the olaparib/bevacizumab arm, 1 patient with a squamous cell carcinoma was excluded as this was a 
non-melanoma skin cancer; 1 patient with liver metastases and 1 patient with tumour pain were excluded 
as these were considered disease progression AEs. 
- In the placebo/bevacizumab arm, 1 patient with an AE of paraganglion neoplasm was excluded as this 
was a benign tumour. 
Therefore,  there  were  6  (1.1%)  patients  in  the  olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  and  3  (1.1%)  patients  in the 
placebo/bevacizumab arm with new primary malignancies. The AEs of new primary malignancies in PAOLA-
1  compared  with  other  studies  in  the  clinical  programme.  When  larger  populations  of  olaparib-treated 
patients are considered the incidence remains below 1.5%. 
All patients in the 300 mg bd pool had other potential factors that offer alternative explanations for the 
development of the new primary tumour, such as: a history of smoking, alcohol consumption or exposure 
to strong sunlight; a documented breast cancer gene (BRCA1 or 2) mutation; a medical history of previous 
Assessment report

cancers;  exposure  to  previous  chemotherapy  agents  including  multiple  cycles  of  platinum  containing 
chemotherapies  that  are  known  DNA-damaging  agents  and taxanes,  anthracyclines  and  other  alkylating 
and DNA-damaging agents; and prior radiotherapy. 
Table 71: Summary of AEs of new primary malignancies occurring across the olaparib 
programme 
Of the 36 AEs in the olaparib monotherapy all doses pool, 12 patients had skin cancers as follows: basal 
cell carcinoma (n=6), Skin cancer (n=2), Malignant melanoma (n=2), one patient reported both a basal 
cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma and one patient reported squamous cell carcinoma unspecified. 
The non-skin cancer events were: breast cancers (n=9), GI cancers (n=5), thyroid cancer (n=2), plasma 
cell myeloma (n=2), lung cancer (n=2), bladder cancer, glioma, squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, 
lip and/or oral cavity cancer (n=1 of each). Of the 36 patients in the olaparib monotherapy all doses pool 
with  new  primary  malignancies,  31  patients  had  a  documented  BRCA  mutation,  1  patient  was  gBRCA 
wildtype and in 4 patients, the BRCA mutation status was unknown. 
Including  all  patients  exposed  to  olaparib  during  clinical  development  (i.e.,  including  data  from  ongoing 
studies, blinded studies, combination studies, ESRs and the MAP) provides data for 11919 patients (as of 
15 June 2019). In this population, there have been 96 reports of new primary malignancies out of a total 
of 11919 patients estimated to have received olaparib in the clinical study programme, giving an estimated 
cumulative  incidence  of  0.8%.  There  have  also  been  reports  of  new  primary  malignancies  from  post 
marketing  surveillance,  consistent  with  the  characterisation  of  the  events  reported  from  monotherapy 
clinical studies.

Pneumonitis 
At  the  time  of  the  DCO  for  PAOLA-1  (22  March  2019),  it  was  reported  that  6  (1.1%)  patients  in  the 
olaparib/bevacizumab arm (3 AE of interstitial lung disease, 2 AEs of pneumonitis and 1 AE of bronchiolitis) 
and no patients in the placebo/bevacizumab arm had an AE of pneumonitis. 
The pneumonitis AEs reported with olaparib in PAOLA-1 were generally mild or moderate; all of the 6 AEs 
were CTCAE Grade 1 or 2 and 2 of the 6 cases were non-serious. There were no AEs of CTCAE Grade 3 
severity and 4 SAEs. In 4 of the 6 patients, treatment was interrupted and the pneumonitis AE resolved; 
no  re-occurrence  or  worsening  of  pneumonitis  was  reported  following  treatment  restart  (negative  re-
challenge).  Olaparib  treatment  was  continued  in  1  patient  and  in  1  patient,  the  pneumonitis  AEs  led  to 
treatment discontinuation. 
In  the  larger  pool  (therapeutic  dose  pool),  the  incidence  of  pneumonitis  events  was  0.9%  (20  cases 
reported). Of the 20 pneumonitis AEs in the olaparib monotherapy combined therapeutic dose pool (n = 
2351),  15  were  CTCAE  Grade  1  or  2  and  the  remaining  5  AEs  were  CTCAE  Grade  3.  Thirteen  of  the  20 
pneumonitis  AEs  were  non-serious  and  7  were  SAEs.  Twelve  of  the  20  AEs  were  reported  to  have 
recovered/resolved or recovering/resolving and the remaining 8 AEs did not resolve. In 8 of the 20 patients 
with pneumonitis AEs, treatment was continued without interruption, in a further 6 patients the dose of 
olaparib was interrupted or reduced and in the remaining 6 patients, olaparib treatment was permanently 
discontinued. Overall, the majority of pneumonitis AEs reported in the olaparib monotherapy therapeutic 
dose pool were mild or moderate, non-serious and resolved without treatment discontinuation. None of the 
20 pneumonitis AEs in the pool had a fatal outcome. 
AstraZeneca's  global  Patient  Safety  database  contains  all  AE  reports,  from  spontaneous  sources  (eg, 
healthcare professionals, Regulatory Authorities, literature, consumers, and others), whether or not they 
meet regulatory authorities’ definition of SAE, and reports from clinical study use that are defined as SAEs. 
Non-SAE reports from clinical study use are usually only entered onto the clinical study database, but in 
some  (but  not  all)  olaparib  studies,  non-serious  pneumonitis  events  were  also  entered  into  the  safety 
database. A search of the AstraZeneca safety database up to 15 June 2019, retrieved 161 case reports; 75 
case reports from clinical studies, 49 case reports from the post-marketing setting and the remaining 37 
case  reports  from  other  solicited  sources  (e.g.,  post  marketing  non-interventional  studies  or  patient 
assistance programmes). Of the 75 case reports from clinical studies (including PROfound), 66 reported a 
pneumonitis SAE and 9 reported a non-serious pneumonitis event. 
Five  of  the  events  in  these  161  case  reports  had  a  fatal  outcome;  all  of  these  patients  were  receiving 
olaparib  in  combination  with other  therapies  (including  other  chemotherapies and/or  radiation)  and  2 of 
these 5 were being treated for non-small cell lung cancer. In addition, 2 events in the 86 case reports from 
the post-marketing setting and other solicited sources had a fatal outcome. One patient had a history of 
interstitial lung changes before starting olaparib therapy and was receiving concomitant simvastatin and 
had a recent cycle of carboplatin, which are potential confounders. The patient discontinued olaparib 25 
days before the onset of the event. The other patient who developed fatal pneumonitis had lung metastases, 
pleural effusion and bronchitis, as potential confounders before starting olaparib treatment. 
Main adverse drug reactions related to bevacizumab 
The purpose of this section is to provide a more detailed assessment of the AEs for bevacizumab that are 
listed in the product label as ADRs and are considered to be AESIs. This summary focuses only on data 
from the PAOLA-1 SAS (overall study duration). The section does not discuss hematologic toxicity which is 
also known for bevacizumab but is discussed above in the subsection on ADR related to olaparib.

Hypertension 
Hypertension is reported as a very common ADR for bevacizumab treatment (AEs and clinically 
significant/severe AEs of hypertension are reported to occur at an incidence of more than ≥1/10 
patients). 
AEs of hypertension were reported for a lower percentage of patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm 
(45.8%) and the placebo/bevacizumab arm (59.9%). More than half of the hypertension AEs were mild or 
moderate in severity and the majority of patients with hypertension AEs had events in the combination 
period in both treatment arms, (223 [91.0%] of 245 patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm and 153 
[95.6%] of 160 patients in the placebo/bevacizumab arm).  
The proportion of patients with CTCAE Grade 3 AEs of hypertension was lower in the 
olaparib/bevacizumab arm, compared with the placebo/bevacizumab arm of PAOLA-1. There were no 
Grade 4 AEs of hypertension. SAEs of hypertension were reported in a slightly lower proportion of 
patients in olaparib/bevacizumab arm (9.0% of patients) compared with the placebo/bevacizumab arm 
(13.1% of patients). 
AE onset data for PAOLA-1 showed that the majority of first AEs of hypertension in both treatment arms 
of PAOLA-1 occurred in the first 360 days of study treatment. This corresponds with the median duration 
of bevacizumab treatment in each treatment arm (11.0 months [approximately 336 days] in the 
olaparib/bevacizumab arm and 10.4 months [approximately 316 days] in the placebo/bevacizumab arm; 
consistent with most of the AEs of hypertension being associated with bevacizumab treatment. A similar 
number of patients in each arm had a first AE of hypertension in the first month of treatment with rates 
of 17.8% and 20.2%, for olaparib/bevacizumab and placebo/bevacizumab treated patients, respectively. 
Despite the incidence of AEs, CTCAE Grade ≥3 AEs and SAEs of hypertension, AEs of hypertension rarely 
led to dose modification of olaparib or placebo treatment in PAOLA-1 and none led to discontinuation of 
olaparib or placebo treatment.  
Proteinuria 
Proteinuria is reported as a very common ADR for bevacizumab treatment (AEs of proteinuria are reported 
to occur at an incidence of more than ≥1/10 patients and clinically significant/severe AEs of proteinuria are 
reported to occur at an incidence of between ≥1/100 and <1/10 patients). Proteinuria was reported as an 
AE  for  a  lower  proportion  of  patients  in  the  olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  (5.8%),  compared  the 
placebo/bevacizumab arm (15.4%). AEs of proteinuria were predominantly Grade 1 or 2 in severity and 
none led to permanent discontinuation of treatment. 
The majority of patients with proteinuria AEs had events in the combination period in both treatment arms, 
(26  [83.9%]  of  31  patients  in  the  olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  and  37  [90.2%]  of  41  patients  in  the 
placebo/bevacizumab arm).  
The  time  to  first  AE  of  proteinuria  was  similar  in  the  two  arms.  All  of  the  AEs  of  proteinuria  in  the 
olaparib/bevacizumab arm, and the majority in the placebo/bevacizumab arm, had a first onset in the first 
450 days of study (only 2 patients in the placebo/bevacizumab arm had AEs of proteinuria in the period 
from Day 451 to Day 540 and no patients in either arm had AEs after Day 541. This corresponds with the 
median duration of bevacizumab treatment in each treatment arm (11.0 months [approximately 336 days] 
in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm and 10.4 months [approximately 316 days] in the placebo/bevacizumab 
arm consistent with most of the AEs of proteinuria being associated with bevacizumab treatment. 
An  analysis  of  urinary  protein  values  showed  that  the  majority  of  patients  in  both  treatment  arms  had 
values that were normal or showed a trace of urinary protein at each visit.

GI perforation, abscesses and fistulae (any grade) 
AEs of GI perforation, abscesses and fistulae are reported as common ADRs for bevacizumab treatment 
(AEs  and  clinically  significant/severe  AEs  are  reported  to  occur  at  an  incidence  of  between  ≥1/100  and 
<1/10  patients).  AEs  of  GI  perforation,  abscesses  and  fistulae  were  reported  for  a  low  percentage  of 
patients  in  the  olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  (2  patients  [0.4%])  and  the  placebo/bevacizumab  arm 
(2 patients  [0.7%]).  All  AEs  were  reported  during  the  combination  phase.  All  events  were  Grade  ≥3  in 
severity and 1 event (intestinal perforation) was reported as fatal in a patient in the placebo/bevacizumab 
arm.  One  patient  on  each  arm  reported  an  SAE.  AEs  of  GI  perforation,  abscesses  and  fistulae  led  to 
treatment interruption of olaparib in 0.4% of the olaparib/bevacizumab arm. There were no dose reductions 
or discontinuation of olaparib or placebo treatment. 
Haemorrhagic events (including wound healing complication) 
Wound healing complications are reported as common/very common ADRs for bevacizumab treatment 
(AEs of wound healing complications are reported to occur at an incidence of more than ≥1/10 patients 
and clinically significant/severe AEs of wound healing complications are reported to occur at an incidence 
of between ≥1/100 and <1/10 patients). 
AEs of haemorrhagic events (reported terms: cerebral haemorrhage, contusion, epistaxis, gastric 
haemorrhage, gingival bleeding, haemorrhagic disorder, intestinal haemorrhage, melaena, petechiae, 
rectal haemorrhage and vaginal haemorrhage) were reported for a similar percentage of patients in the 
olaparib/bevacizumab arm (9.7%) and the placebo/bevacizumab arm (10.5%). These events were 
predominantly Grade 1 or 2 in severity and none of the AEs in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm led to 
permanent discontinuation of treatment. The majority of patients with haemorrhage AEs had events in 
the combination period in both treatment arms, (48 [92.3%] of 52 patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab 
arm and 24 [85.7%] of 28 patients in the placebo/bevacizumab arm).  
A low number of patients had AEs of wound healing complications. In the olaparib/bevacizumab arm 3 
(0.6%) patients, had AEs, all of which occurred during the combination phase; in the 
placebo/bevacizumab arm, 5 (1.9%) patients had 6 AEs (only 1 patient had 1 AE during the combination 
phase). One AE in each arm was CTCAE Grade 3 (an AE of wound dehiscence in the olaparib/bevacizumab 
arm and an AE of wound complication in the placebo/bevacizumab arm), all other events were mild or 
moderate in severity. One placebo/bevacizumab-treated patient reported an SAE (of impaired healing, 
CTCAE Grade 2) on Day 362 of study. There were no AEs of wound healing that led to treatment 
interruption in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm and 0.7% AEs of wound healing led to treatment 
interruption of placebo in the placebo/bevacizumab arm. There were no dose reductions or 
discontinuations of olaparib or placebo due to AEs of wound healing. 
In addition, there were 6 patients who had AEs of wound evisceration, which were not included in the 
grouped term for wound healing complications. Four (0.7%) patients were in the olaparib/bevacizumab 
arm and 2 (0.7%) patients were in the placebo/bevacizumab arm; none of the AEs in the 
olaparib/bevacizumab arm and 1 of the 2 AEs in the placebo/bevacizumab arm occurred during the 
combination phase. Of the 4 AEs in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm, 1 patient had a CTCAE Grade 3 SAE 
which was considered related to olaparib and also led to treatment discontinuation; this event recovered 
after 6 days. Of the 3 remaining events, 2 were CTCAE Grade 2 (1 event was an SAE and 1 event led to 
dose interruption; both events were reported as resolved) and 1 was CTCAE Grade 1 (this event occurred 
in follow-up and a resolution date was not provided). In the placebo/bevacizumab arm, 1 patient had a 
CTCAE Grade 2 SAE which led to discontinuation and 1 patient had a CTCAE Grade 1 AE. None of the 
CTCAE Grade ≤2 AEs were considered related to olaparib and none of the patients with AEs of wound 
evisceration had other AEs that were included in the grouped term for wound healing complications.

Thromboembolic events 
Thromboembolic events are reported as common/very common ADR for bevacizumab treatment (AEs of 
venous  thromboembolic  events  are  reported  to  occur  at  an  incidence  of  more  than  ≥1/10  patients  and 
clinically significant/severe AEs of arterial thromboembolic events are reported to occur at an incidence of 
between  ≥1/100  and  <1/10  patients).  AEs  of  arterial  thromboembolic  events  (reported  terms  of  acute 
myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, embolism, myocardial infarction, thrombosis and transient 
ischaemic  attack)  were  reported  for  9  (1.7%)  patients  in  the  olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  and  8  (3.0%) 
patients in the placebo/bevacizumab arm. 
The majority of patients with AEs in the grouped term of arterial thromboembolic events occurred in the 
combination period in both treatment arms, (6 [66.7%] of 9 patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm and 
5 [62.5%] of 8 patients in the placebo/bevacizumab arm).  
In the olaparib/bevacizumab arm 0.6% of patients reported CTCAE Grade 3 events, no patients reported 
Grade 4 events. In the placebo/bevacizumab arm 2.6% of patients reported CTCAE Grade ≥3 events, of 
which 2 patient (0.7%) reported Grade 4 events and 1 patient (0.4%) reported a fatal event. All Grade 4 
and 5 events were myocardial infarction. Two patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm had SAEs (both 
SAEs of embolism), compared with 6 patients in the placebo/bevacizumab arm (4 patients with myocardial 
infarction,  1  patient  with  an  acute  myocardial  infarction  and  1  patient  with  a  cerebrovascular  accident). 
Two  of  the  myocardial  infarction  AEs  in  the  placebo/bevacizumab  arm  were  fatal.  Two  patients  in  the 
placebo/bevacizumab arm discontinued study treatment due to AEs of myocardial infarction. 
AEs  of  venous  thromboembolic  events  (grouped  term  consisting  of  the  PTs  of  deep  vein  thrombosis, 
pulmonary embolism, thrombophlebitis and venous thrombosis) were reported for 17 (3.2%) of patients in 
the olaparib/bevacizumab arm and 4 (1.5%) of patients in the placebo/bevacizumab arm. The majority of 
patients with AEs in the grouped term of venous thromboembolic events occurred in the combination period 
in  both  treatment  arms,  (10  [58.8%]  of  17  patients  in  olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  and  3  [75.0%]  of  4 
patients  in  the  placebo/bevacizumab  arm).  At  the  event  level,  10  (52.6%)  of  19  AEs  in  the  venous 
thromboembolic  events  grouped  term  in  the  olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  and  3  (75.0%)  of  4  AEs  in  the 
placebo/bevacizumab arm occurred in the combination period. 
On  the  olaparib/bevacizumab  arm,  8  (1.5%)  of  patients  reported  CTCAE  Grade  ≥3  events,  2  patients 
reported CTCAE Grade 4 events (both had pulmonary embolism SAEs). In the placebo/bevacizumab arm, 
1  (0.4%)  patient  a  reported  CTCAE  Grade  3  AE  (pulmonary  embolism);  no  patients  reported  Grade  4 
events.  Six  patients  in  the  olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  had  SAEs  (5  patients  with  SAEs  of  pulmonary 
embolism  and  1  patient  with  an  SAE  of  venous  thrombosis),  compared  with  1  patient  in  the 
placebo/bevacizumab arm (1 patient with an SAE of pulmonary embolism). None of the events were fatal 
or led to discontinuation of olaparib or placebo treatment. 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) 
AEs of PRES are reported rare AEs for bevacizumab treatment (AEs of PRES are reported to occur at an 
incidence of between ≥1/10,000 and <1/1,000 patients). An AE of PRES was reported for 1 patient in the 
placebo/bevacizumab  arm,  which  occurred  during  the  combination  phase.  This  AE  was  CTCAE  Grade  2, 
non-serious, and did not lead to death, discontinuation, dose reduction or modification.  
Congestive heart failure (CHF) 
Congestive  heart  failure  is  reported  as  a  common  ADR  for  bevacizumab  treatment  (AEs  and  clinically 
significant/severe AEs of congestive heart failure [reported term: cardiac failure chronic] are reported to 
occur at an incidence of between ≥1/100 and <1/10 patients). An AE of cardiac failure chronic was reported 
Assessment report  
EMA/523504/2020 
Page 123/150 
 
 
  
  
for 1 patient in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm, which occurred outside of the combination phase. The AE 
was CTCAE Grade 3, non-serious, and did not lead to death, discontinuation, dose reduction or modification. 
Non-GI fistula or abscess (any grade) 
AEs of fistula in the SOC of musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders are reported as common AEs 
for bevacizumab treatment (AEs and clinically significant/severe AEs of fistula [grouped term] are reported 
to  occur  at  an incidence  of  between  ≥1/100  and  <1/10  patients).  Two  AEs  of  non-GI  fistula  or  abscess 
(reported terms of abscess, fistula, nasal septum perforation and urogenital fistula) were reported in the 
olaparib/bevacizumab arm (urogenital fistula [1 patient, 0.2%] and fistula [1 patient, 0.2%]) and 2 AEs in 
the placebo/bevacizumab arm (nasal septum perforation [1 patient, 0.4%] and abscess [1 patient, 0.4%]). 
One AE in each arm was CTCAE Grade 3: urogenital fistula in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm (also an SAE), 
and the event of nasal septum perforation in the placebo/bevacizumab arm. Only the AE of abscess in the 
placebo/bevacizumab arm led to dose interruption. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
The proportion of olaparib/bevacizumab-treated patients with a decrease in haemoglobin of CTCAE Grade 
≥3 during the study was 12.5%; the proportion of olaparib/bevacizumab-treated patients with abnormal 
CTCAE Grade of 3 or 4 values for other haematological parameters was generally ≤10%. Anaemia was the 
second most frequently reported CTCAE Grade ≥3 AE and SAE, and the most frequently reported DAE.  
In the olaparib/bevacizumab treatment arm, the proportion of patients with abnormal haematology values 
of CTCAE Grade ≥3 was similar for each parameter for the overall study period and the combination only 
phase, when corrected for duration of exposure (Table 72).

Table 73: PAOLA-1: Number (%) of patients with maximum overall CTCAE grades during 
treatment for key clinical chemistry parameters (SAS) 
Assessment of the potential for drug-induced liver injury 
Based  on  all  available  data  there  is  no  evidence  to  suggest  that  olaparib  causes  DILI.  There  were  no 
confirmed  or  suspected  Hy’s  Law  cases.  No  olaparib/bevacizumab-treated  patients  in  PAOLA-1  had 
concurrent elevations of bilirubin and ALT/AST. 
In PAOLA-1, the majority of patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm and placebo/bevacizumab arms had 
a  maximum  on-treatment  AST  (522/534  [97.8%]  and  262/267  [98.1%]  patients,  respectively)  and  ALT 
(523/534 [97.9%] and 261/267 [97.7%] patients, respectively) below 3 × ULN. 
Of the few patients with AST or ALT values above 3 × ULN in PAOLA-1, 3 olaparib/bevacizumab-treated 
patients and 1 placebo/bevacizumab-treated patient had AST or ALT values in the range ≥10 × ULN to <20 
× ULN. No patients in either treatment arm had an AST or ALT value of ≥20 × ULN. 
Assessment report  
EMA/523504/2020 
Page 126/150 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
In  PAOLA-1,  there  were  no  patients  who  had  CTCAE  Grade  4  laboratory  values  for  ALT  and  AST;  the 
proportion of patients with CTCAE Grade 3 elevations was low in both treatment arms. 
An  assessment  of  ALT,  AST  maximal  elevations  during  treatment  by  maximal  total  bilirubin  elevations 
showed that no patients in the either treatment arm had concurrent elevation of bilirubin and either ALT or 
AST.  A  similar  proportion  of  olaparib/bevacizumab-treated  patients  in  the  PAOLA-1  study  had  hepatic 
metastases (6.0% of patients) at baseline, compared with SOLO1 (5.0% patients) and PROfound (9.8% of 
patients);  the  proportion  of  olaparib/bevacizumab-treated  patients  in  the  PAOLA-1  study  with  hepatic 
metastases  was  lower  than  for  SOLO2  (13.8%  patients),  SOLO3  (12.4%  patients);  OlympiAD  (38.5% 
patients) and POLO (66.3%). 
In the 300 mg bd pool, the majority (1469/1572 [93.4%] patients) had combined AST or ALT below 3 × 
ULN. In the 300 mg bd pool, 26 (1.7%) patients had an ALT increased laboratory value (worst grade) of 
CTCAE Grade 3 and 2 patients (0.1%) had an ALT increased laboratory value of CTCAE Grade 4; 36 (2.3%) 
patients  had  a  CTCAE  Grade  3  laboratory  value  of  AST  increased;  no  patients  had  an  AST  increased 
laboratory value of CTCAE Grade 4. The proportion of patients with CTCAE Grade ≥3 laboratory values of 
ALT or AST in the 300 mg bd pool was higher than that in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm of the PAOLA-1 
study (0.2% and 0.6%, respectively) 
The proportion of olaparib/bevacizumab-treated patients with CTCAE  Grade 3  AEs in the PAOLA-1 study 
and in the 300 mg bd pool was low and similar to the proportion of patients with CTCAE Grade 3 abnormal 
laboratory  values.  In  PAOLA-1,  1  (0.2%)  olaparib/bevacizumab-treated  patient  had  CTCAE  Grade  3  AE 
report of AST increased (there were no CTCAE Grade 3 AE reports of ALT increased). In the 300 mg bd 
pool, 11 (0.7%) patients had a CTCAE Grade 3 AE report of AST increased and 10 (0.6%) patients had a 
CTCAE Grade 3 AE report of ALT increased; 
An assessment of combined elevations of ALT and bilirubin was conducted for all patients in the 300 mg bd 
pool.  Of  these  1585  patients,  23  patients  reported  elevations  of  both  AST  or  ALT  >3  ×  ULN  and  total 
bilirubin >2 × ULN, irrespective of ALP, at any point during their study treatment. A detailed evaluation of 
medical history, progression of disease, temporal association for the 23 patients with elevated ALP (>2 × 
ULN  for  21  patients  and  <1  ×  ULN  for  2  patients)  and  other  factors  showed  that  all  23  patients  had 
alternative explanations for elevations of ALT and bilirubin, generally suggestive of obstructive causes, or 
cancer disease progression, including disease progression in the liver. 
The  evaluation  of  hepatic  function  laboratory  data,  in  conjunction  with  an  assessment  of  reported 
hepatobiliary/abnormal hepatic biochemistry AEs did not identify risk of DILI in the olaparib/bevacizumab-
treated patient population. 
Assessment of potential for renal impairment 
Mild  elevations  in  creatinine  have  been  observed  with  no  apparent  sequelae  and  with  resolution  on 
discontinuing olaparib, with no change in other renal function biochemistry tests (urea/blood urea nitrogen 
[BUN]). The small increases in creatinine observed with olaparib and the rapid onset of the mild changes 
observed,  with  a  return  to  baseline  after  olaparib  discontinuation  are  consistent  with  the  finding  that 
olaparib is known to be an inhibitor of OCT2 and MATE1. 
In the olaparib/bevacizumab arm of PAOLA-1, 94.2% of olaparib/bevacizumab-treated patients had normal 
creatinine levels at baseline, 5.8% had CTCAE Grade 1 at baseline and no patients had CTCAE Grade ≥2 at 
baseline. A total of 170/533 (31.9%) patients had a single worsening change in CTCAE Grade (most changes 
were normal to Grade 1) and 134/533 (25.1%) patients had worsening 2 grade shifts in CTCAE Grade for 
creatinine;  2  patients  had  a  shift  from  normal  at  baseline  to  CTCAE  Grade  4  on  treatment.  In  the 
placebo/bevacizumab arm of PAOLA-1, 93.2% of patients had normal creatinine at baseline and 6.8% had 
CTCAE Grade 1 at baseline; of these patients, 63/266 (23.7%) patients had a single change in CTCAE Grade 
Assessment report  
EMA/523504/2020

(all except 1 patient had changes from normal to Grade 1); 16/266 (6.0%) patients had worsening 2 grade 
shifts in CTCAE Grade for creatinine and 2 patients had a shift from normal at baseline to CTCAE Grade 3 
or 4 on treatment. 
Data from all patients in the 300 mg bd pool showed that a higher proportion of patients in the 300 mg bd 
pool  had  CTCAE  grade  shifts  in  creatinine,  compared  with  PAOLA-1.  In  the  300  mg  bd  pool,  92.4%  of 
olaparib-treated patients had normal creatinine at baseline, 6.9% had CTCAE Grade 1 at baseline and 0.5% 
had CTCAE Grade 2 at baseline. A total of 1205/1573 (76.6%) patients had a single change in CTCAE Grade 
(changes were normal to Grade 1 in 1165/1573 [74.1%] patients); 243/1573 (15.4%) had 2 CTCAE grade 
shifts (all were normal to Grade 2) and 7/1573 (0.4%) patient had a 3 grade shift in creatinine (all were 
Grade 0 to Grade 3). 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic factors 
Effect of gender 
As all patients in the PAOLA-1 study were female, an analysis of the effects of gender has been conducted 
in the 300 mg bd pool.

Effect of age 
Table 75: 300 mg bd pool: number of patients reporting at least one adverse event by age 
group 
For the majority of the AEs, there were no differences in frequency of AEs by PT in patients aged <65 years 
when compared with patients aged 65 to 74 years, 75 to 84 years and ≥85 years. Nausea and vomiting 
were the only AEs that occurred at a higher incidence (≥5 percentage points difference) in the <65 years 
category compared with 65 to 74, 75 to 84 and ≥85 years age categories. 
For  the  65  to  74  years  age  category,  AEs  that  occurred  at  a  higher  incidence  (≥5  percentage  points 
difference) when compared with <65 years age category was: oedema peripheral. AEs that occurred at a 
lower incidence (≥5% difference) when compared with <65 years age category were: nausea and vomiting. 
For  the  75  to  84  years  age  category,  AEs  that  occurred  at  a  higher  incidence  (≥5  percentage  points 
difference) when compared with <65 years were: anaemia, decreased appetite, dyspnoea, hypotension, 
muscular  weakness,  oedema  peripheral  and  pneumonia.  AEs  that  occurred  at  a  lower  incidence  (≥5% 
difference)  when  compared  with  <65  years  age  category  were:  abdominal  pain,  abdominal  pain  upper, 
dysgeusia, headache, leukopenia, nasopharyngitis, nausea and vomiting. 
An  analysis  of  AEs  by  the  SOCs/SMQs  most  relevant  to  elderly  patients,  and  age  did  not  reveal  major 
differences. 
Effect of race 
The  majority  of  these  patients  331  (85.8%)  were  of  Asian  origin,  19  (4.9%)  patients  were  of  Black  or 
African-American origin, 9 (2.3%) were of American Indian or Alaska Native origin, 1 (0.3%) was of Native 
Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander origin and 11 (2.8%) were of other racial origin. Numbers of Asian and 
other  non-White  patients  represent  20.9%  of  patients  and  2.5%  of  patients  (331/1585  and  40/1585 
patients) in the 300 mg bd pool, respectively.

Table 76: 300 mg bd pool: Number (%) of patients who had at least 1 AE in any category by 
race (White patients, Asian patients and other non-White patients) 
AEs that occurred at a higher incidence in Asian patients (≥5 percentage points difference) compared with 
White patients were: ALT increased, anaemia, AST increased, decreased appetite, malaise, muscle spasms, 
neutrophil  count  decreased,  platelet  count  decreased,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  and  WBC  count 
decreased.  AEs  that  occurred  at  a  lower  incidence  in  Asian  patients  (≥5  percentage  points  difference) 
compared with White patients were: abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, arthralgia, asthenia, back pain, 
constipation,  diarrhoea,  dyspnoea,  fatigue,  headache,  nausea,  oedema  peripheral  and  urinary  tract 
infection. 
AEs  that  occurred  at  a  higher  incidence  in  other  non-White  patients  (≥5  percentage  points  difference) 
compared  with  White  patients  were:  anaemia,  decreased  appetite,  hyperglycaemia,  hypertension, 
hypokalaemia,  leukopenia,  neutropenia,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  vertigo  and  WBC  count 
decreased.  AEs  that  occurred  at  a  lower  incidence  in  other  non-White  patients  (≥5  percentage  points 
difference)  compared  with  White  patients  were:  asthenia,  dyspepsia,  fatigue,  nausea,  pyrexia,  rash  and 
vomiting. 
AEs with a CTCAE Grade ≥3 that occurred at a higher incidence in Asian patients (≥5 percentage points 
difference)  compared  with  White  patients  were:  anaemia,  neutrophil  count  decreased  and  WBC  count 
decreased.  The  only  CTCAE  Grade  ≥3  AE  that  occurred  at  a  higher  incidence  (≥5  percentage  points 
difference) in other non-White patients compared with White patients was anaemia. 
Anaemia, neutrophil count decreased and WBC count decreased were the only AEs that resulted in a dose 
modification  that  occurred  at  a  higher  incidence  in  Asian  patients  (≥5  percentage  points  difference) 
compared with White patients. Anaemia was the only AE that resulted in a dose modification that occurred 
at a higher incidence (≥5 percentage points difference) in other non-White patients compared with White 
patients. 
There were no AEs leading to treatment discontinuation that occurred at a higher incidence in Asian patients 
(≥5  percentage  points  difference)  compared  with  White  patients.  Anaemia  was  the  only  AE  leading  to 
treatment discontinuation that occurred at a higher incidence (≥5 percentage points difference) in other 
non-White patients compared with White patients.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse events leading to discontinuation 
An assessment of the olaparib or placebo exposure over time (figure below) and the reasons for treatment 
discontinuation  by  time  to  treatment  discontinuation  (table  below)  showed  that  the  higher  rate  of 
discontinuation rate from olaparib versus placebo was driven by AEs in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm in 
the first 3 months of treatment. Between 3 and 9 months, the overall rate of discontinuation was similar 
between  the  olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  and  placebo/bevacizumab  arm.  Following  completion  of 
bevacizumab treatment at approximately 10 months, the rate of discontinuation of olaparib was reduced, 
in contrast to discontinuations due to progression or death occurring in a higher proportion of patients in 
the placebo arm.

Data derived from Table 1409, Module 5.3.5.3 (DCO: 22 March 2019). 
In PAOLA-1, a higher proportion of patients had DAEs (from olaparib or placebo) in the 
olaparib/bevacizumab arm (20.4%), compared with the placebo/bevacizumab arm (5.6%). The majority 
of DAEs were reported during the combination period. 
In the olaparib/bevacizumab arm, 34 (6.4%) patients discontinued treatment within the first month on 
study. The most common DAE in the first month on study was nausea, which resulted in olaparib 
discontinuation in 11 (2.1%) patients; DAEs of blood creatinine increased, fatigue and vomiting each 
occurred in 3 (0.6%) patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm. The only AEs leading to discontinuation 
of olaparib that were reported in >3 olaparib/bevacizumab-treated patients were: anaemia, fatigue, 
nausea and vomiting.

In PAOLA-1, a higher proportion of patients had AE leading to dose reduction (from olaparib or placebo) in 
the olaparib/bevacizumab arm (41.1%), compared with the placebo/bevacizumab arm (7.5%). The most 
common (≥5% patients) AEs leading to dose reduction of olaparib or placebo were: anaemia and nausea. 
The majority of AEs leading to dose reduction occurred during the combination phase. About one third of 
dose reductions occurred in the initial treatment period of up to 3 months.

Post marketing experience 
The  safety  signal  detection  activities  include  review  of  reported  AEs  from  post-marketed  sources,  and a 
review of the published literature relevant to Olaparib. The reports received do not change the benefit-risk 
profile of Olaparib (PBRER DCO 15 June 2019).  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The clinical safety analysis is mainly based on data from the Phase III PAOLA-1 study in 806 randomised 
patients with newly-diagnosed advanced (FIGO Stage IIIB-IV) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian 
tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who were in response following first line treatment, with platinum-
taxane chemotherapy and bevacizumab. Combination therapy of olaparib and bevacizumab was 
compared to bevacizumab and placebo, followed by monotherapy of olaparib or placebo (535 patients 
versus 267 patients respectively) (DCO: 22 March 2019). Supportive data with a large pool of 
1585 patients which received the same dose of olaparib as monotherapy in other indications were also 
provided and allow to better characterize the safety profile of the combination therapy. 
The methodology used is acceptable and available data are considered sufficient to ensure an effective 
analysis of the safety profile of olaparib in association with bevacizumab in the scope of the requested 
indication. 
Median duration of treatment was slightly higher in olaparib/bevacizumab arm compared to 
placebo/bevacizumab group (17.3 months vs 15.6 months) with similar duration of the combination 
period (10.6 months) which means that combination with olaparib does not impact bevacizumab 
Assessment report  
EMA/523504/2020 
Page 136/150 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
treatment duration as maintenance therapy. Most patients randomized in olaparib/bevacizumab arm 
received olaparib for a period of >12 months.  
The percentage of patients remaining on treatment at 1 year was similar in the olaparib/bevacizumab and 
placebo/bevacizumab arms (61.9% and 61.8%, respectively); the percentage of patients remaining on 
treatment at 2 years was greater in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm (20.4%) than in the 
placebo/bevacizumab arm (13.9%). Note that in PAOLA-1 patients could continue treatment for 2 years 
or until disease progression. Patients who in the opinion of the treating physician could derive further 
benefit from continuous treatment, could be treated beyond 2 years.  
However, long-term data of the combination therapy are limited since median duration of treatment was 
10.6 months with range from 0.3 to 20.2 months and the MAH is recommended to submit the long-term 
safety data analysis of the clinical study PAOLA-1 at the time of the final OS analysis (REC). 
Disease progression was the main reason for study discontinuation with a lower rate in the combination 
treatment group compared bevacizumab alone (34.0% vs 58.1%). 
In PAOLA-1 study, patient’s demographics were consistent across treatment groups and reflect the 
population of the proposed indication. All patients were women with mean age of 60 years old and 
primary tumour location was mostly ovary. 
Safety monitoring and protocol amendment 
No dose-finding study has been conducted for the combination of olaparib with bevacizumab to determine 
an optimal combination dose in maintenance setting. An interim safety analysis have been conducted on 
26 April 2016 to evaluate the tolerability profile in the 42 first randomised and followed for two 3-week 
cycles patients that received continuous twice daily oral olaparib (300 mg twice) or placebo in patient 
treated in maintenance with intravenous bevacizumab at a fixed dose (15 mg/kg) administered every 
21 days. The data of the interim analysis has been reviewed by the IDMC which has recommended to 
continue the enrolment as planned to the sponsor ARCAGY Research. IDMC was reviewing the emerging 
safety data during the whole duration of the trial. 
To ensure robust safety monitoring, additional safety measures have been incorporated into this phase III 
protocol. Patients with history of MDS/AML and having experienced prolonged haematotoxicity (> 2 
weeks) to first-line chemotherapy were excluded. While on treatment, regular blood tests were required 
to detect early haematological abnormality and the frequency of tests was increased under the protocol 
version 5 between 6 and 12 months of treatment to every 3 weeks instead of every 6 weeks. In case of 
prolonged cytopenia, patients were to be referred to an haematologist and bone marrow analysis was to 
be considered, with discontinuation of treatment in case of confirmed MDS or AML. 
Moreover, in the protocol version 4.0 (06 January 2017), the following exploratory objective was added: 
“Explore the time to next severe toxicity (grade 4 neutropenia lasting > 7 days, grade ≥ 3 febrile 
neutropenia, grade 4 thrombocytopenia with bleeding or platelet transfusion, grade ≥ 3 non-
haematological toxicity) in both arms”. The objective was to explore the ability of olaparib, compared to 
placebo, to postpone the occurrence of a severe toxicity during the whole course of the study including 
study treatment and next subsequent treatments. The analysis of this exploratory endpoint has not been 
performed to date. This exploratory objective was planned not earlier than when final PFS2 results would 
be available (in order to have as much information as possible available on subsequent treatments) and 
will be reported separately in the CSR (REC). 
Safety analyses were performed on the overall study duration (SAS) and on the population of patients in 
the two study arms from initiation of olaparib or placebo until the last dose of olaparib or placebo and 
bevacizumab given concurrently plus 21 day (Combination Phase only). Four patients were excluded from 
the SAS (2 patients each arm) as they did not start olaparib or placebo. One patient 
Assessment report  
EMA/523504/2020 
Page 137/150 
 
 
  
  
olaparib/bevacizumab was excluded from the combination phase because patient discontinued 
bevacizumab prior to the first dose of olaparib.  
Adverse events (AE) 
Overall, the safety profile of olaparib in combination with bevacizumab is considered to be consistent with 
the known safety profiles of the combined olaparib and bevacizumab monotherapies.  
The incidence and severity of the ADR identified with olaparib monotherapy treatment (300 mg bd pool 
data) and identified with olaparib/bevacizumab in PAOLA-1 were compared. Several ADRs had similar 
incidences with monotherapy and combination treatment. However, some ADRs had different incidences 
with monotherapy or combination treatment. The frequency was lower with combination treatment 
(common) than observed with monotherapy (very common) for the following ADR: thrombocytopenia, 
decreased appetite, dizziness, dysgeusia, cough, and dyspnoea (all grade). The frequency was higher 
with combination treatment (very common) than observed with monotherapy (common) for lymphopenia 
(all grade). 
Although some differences of incidence have been noted the larger patient exposure (n=2351) from the 
olaparib therapeutic dose pool provides the most robust estimates of the ADR frequencies for olaparib, a 
separated ADR table for the combination is not warranted. The statement in section 4.8 of the SmPC 
“When Lynparza is used in combination with bevacizumab the safety profile is generally consistent with 
that of the individual therapies” is considered sufficient. For overlapping toxicities, no notable increase in 
severity of events has been observed.  
The majority of AEs were reported during the combination treatment phase and mostly within the first 
3 months of treatment. 
Most commonly AEs reported were consistent with the safety of olaparib with AEs pertaining to the SOC 
Hematologic disorders (anaemia, 40.9%; neutropenia, 18.1%; lymphopenia, 23.6%; leukopenia, 17.8%), 
SOC Gastro-intestinal disorders (nausea, 53.3%; vomiting, 21.9%) and SOC General disorders (fatigue, 
52.9%) as well as known AEs of bevacizumab with hypertension (45.8%) and proteinuria (5.8%). Other 
known AE of olaparib were reported with a lower frequency such as cough (4.7%), dyspnoea (7.9%), 
dizziness (2.6%) and headache (13.6%) as well as known AE of bevacizumab such as haemorrhagic 
events (9.7%) and thromboembolic events (1.7%). 
AE were mainly manageable by treatment interruption or dose reduction and supportive treatment. There 
was no evidence of overlapping toxicities, although such effects are not excluded as the mechanism of 
action of PARP inhibitors, including olaparib, is not fully elucidated. 
Most deaths reported in PAOLA-1 study were related to the disease under investigation. Four fatal cases 
might be related to the combination treatment including one case of aplastic anaemia and pneumonia. 
Appropriate warnings are mentioned in the SmPC to closely monitor haematotoxicity during olaparib 
treatment.  
Five  deaths  associated  with  treatment  emergent  AEs  were  also  reported  >30  days  after  last  treatment 
dose: 3 olaparib/bevacizumab-treated patients (2 from acute myeloid leukaemia - AML and 1 from acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia type B - ALL, all events possibly related to olaparib) and 2 placebo/bevacizumab-
treated  patient.  The  number  of  patients  who  died  post  follow-up  was  numerically  higher  with  the 
combination:  7  olaparib/bevacizumab-treated  patients  (various  causes)  and  2  placebo/bevacizumab-
treated patients.  
Compared to placebo/bevacizumab group, the proportion of AEs reported was slightly higher in 
olaparib/bevacizumab group (99.3% vs 95.9%) with similar proportion of SAEs (31.2% vs 31.1%) and 
slightly higher proportion of AEs of CTCAE Grade≥3 (57.6% vs 50.9%). The rate of treatment 
discontinuation of olaparib/placebo was higher in olaparib/bevacizumab group compared to 
Assessment report  
EMA/523504/2020 
Page 138/150 
 
 
  
  
placebo/bevacizumab group (20.4% vs 5.6%) as well as treatment interruption (54.4% vs 24.3%) and 
dose reduction of olaparib (41.1% vs 7.5%). Adverse events led to dose interruption and/or reduction of 
olaparib in 57.4% of patients when used in combination with bevacizumab. The adverse reactions that 
most commonly led to dose interruption and/or reduction were anaemia (20.6%) and nausea (7.5%). The 
adverse reactions that most commonly led to permanent discontinuation were anaemia (3.6%), nausea 
(3.4%) and fatigue/asthenia (1.5%). Data on bevacizumab dose interruption and discontinuation due to 
AE were not collected in PAOLA-1. Dose reductions of bevacizumab were not permitted. 
Discontinuations due to AE were mainly reported during the first 3 months of treatment in the 
olaparib/bevacizumab combination arm. 
Frequencies of AEs leading to dose interruption were similar between SOLO1 (maintenance treatment of 
newly diagnosed advanced BRCA-mutated high-grade ovarian cancer after first line chemotherapy with 
olaparib monotherapy) and PAOLA-1. However, the incidence of any AE leading to dose reduction was 
higher in PAOLA-1 compared to SOLO-1 (41.1% vs. 28.5%, respectively). Likewise, the incidence of any 
AE leading to discontinuation was higher in PAOLA-1 compared to SOLO-1 (20.4% vs. 11.5%, 
respectively).  
The differences between the two arms in PAOLA-1 were mainly driven by hematologic and gastrointestinal 
disorders, known ADRs of olaparib, with higher rate of anaemia (40.9% vs 10.1%) nausea (53.3% vs 
21.7%) and fatigue (52.9% vs 32.2%) in olaparib/bevacizumab arm.  
For non-tBRCAm/unknown patients (approximatively 70% of the patients) and tBRCAm (approximatively 
30% of the patients), common adverse events, incidence of AE Grade ≥ 3, discontinuation of olaparib or 
placebo due to AE and AE with an outcome of death were consistent with the SAS (data not shown). 
Compared to olaparib pool, the proportion of AEs reported was slightly higher in olaparib/bevacizumab 
group (99.3% vs 97.3%) despite shorter median treatment duration in the pool. Higher rates of SAEs and 
AEs of CTCAE Grade≥3 were also reported (31.2% vs 23% and 57.6% vs 41.6%) which were driven by 
hypertension, a known AE of bevacizumab. However, rates of discontinuation due to AEs, dose 
interruption and reduction of olaparib were more reported in olaparib/bevacizumab group than in the 
olaparib pool (20.4% vs 9.3%; 54.4% vs 39.7%; 41.1% vs 21.4%), mainly due to nausea, anaemia and 
fatigue. The rate of discontinuation due to AEs was higher than observed in the SOLO1 study 
(maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed advanced BRCA-mutated high-grade ovarian cancer after 
first line chemotherapy with olaparib monotherapy), in which it was 11.5% with olaparib monotherapy 
(and 2.3% in placebo arm). These differences could be explained by the combination therapy rather than 
a lower median treatment duration in olaparib pool. Hematologic toxicity which is known for both 
substances, does not appear to increase in terms of incidence and severity with the combination therapy 
such as anaemia and neutropenia, except for lymphopenia and leukopenia which were more reported in 
olaparib/bevacizumab arm compared to olaparib pool (23.6% vs 5.2%; 16.3% vs 13.9%).  
Incidence of some AE was lower with the combination therapy such as thrombocytopenia, decreased 
appetite, dizziness, dysgeusia, cough, and dyspnoea (all grade). 
Analysis of bevacizumab-related ADRs, including hypertension, proteinuria, haemorrhagic and 
thromboembolic events, has been provided. Known AEs of bevacizumab were reported with similar rates 
between olaparib/bevacizumab and placebo/bevacizumab arms, except for hypertension and proteinuria 
for which lower rates were reported in olaparib/bevacizumab group compared to placebo/bevacizumab 
group.  
The two arms of the PAOLA-1 study were homogeneous in terms of risk factors of hypertension and baseline 
characteristics  (age,  weight/body  and  mass  index)  except  for  tobacco  use  which  was  not  presented. 
Relevant medical history reported as current at baseline were well balanced between the two arms as well. 
Assessment report  
EMA/523504/2020 
Page 139/150 
 
 
  
  
Hence,  the  lower  proportion  of  hypertension  in  the  olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  compared  to 
placebo/bevacizumab arm cannot be explained on the basis of baseline characteristics or medical history. 
Overall,  these  findings  are  quite  similar  to  incidences  reported  for  bevacizumab  monotherapy  in  clinical 
studies. The incidence of hypertension in PAOLA-1 was 45% for all grades and 18.7% for grade ≥3 on and 
it was up to 42% for all grades and 17,9% for grade ≥3 in clinical studies for bevacizumab according to its 
SmPC. 
Relevant  medical  history  reported  as  current  at  baseline  associated  with  AEs  proteinuria  and  baseline 
characteristics  were  well  balanced  between  both  groups  in  PAOLA-1  study  and  thus  cannot  explain  the 
reported incidence differences in proteinuria. However, the incidence of proteinuria in olaparib/bevacizumab 
arm were in the range of incidence reported in clinical studies of bevacizumab according to its SmPC (0.7 
to 38 %). 
Regarding potential important risks, 4 cases of MDS/AML (0.7%) were reported in olaparib/bevacizumab 
group including two fatal events. All patients had risk factors such as several previous cycles of platinum 
agents or BRCA mutation and similar rates were reported in SOLO studies (between 1.2% and 2.1%) 
which involved similar patient population. In addition, 6 cases of new primary malignancies were reported 
(1.1%) including 4 in patients with documented mutations in BRCA1/2 genes. However, despite similar 
and consistent rates reported for both safety concerns compared to olaparib entire program (0.6% and 
0.8% respectively), low rates reported make the interpretation of differences observed difficult between 
groups. Due to mechanism of action of PARP inhibitors which lead to genome instability, causal role of 
olaparib cannot be excluded for these two risks and a close monitoring will be maintained in post-
marketing setting.  
MDS/AML remain as important potential risks in the RMP. Appropriate warnings are mentioned in the 
product information to monitor blood count and to discontinue treatment in case of MDS/AML occurrence. 
In addition, a targeted questionnaire has been implemented to better document cases reported. 
Six cases of pneumonitis (1.1%) were reported in olaparib/bevacizumab group. Despite similar and 
consistent rates observed compared to olaparib 300mg bd pool (0.9%), interpretation of differences is 
challenging. A close monitoring will be maintained in post-marketing setting. All 6 patients who reported 
pneumonitis received previously platinum chemotherapy treatment which is a risk factor. Moreover, the 
mechanisms of drug-induced interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis is still not well understood. All AEs of 
pneumonitis were mild or moderate in severity, two cases were non-serious and all of them had a 
favourable outcome. The management of pneumonitis required dose modifications and corrective 
treatment and two patients had permanent treatment discontinuation. Overall, the causality of olaparib 
for pneumonitis remains uncertain. Pneumonitis is an important potential risks (RMP) and adequate 
information is included in the SmPC in this regard. The MAH will continue to closely monitor pneumonitis 
cases in post-marketing setting. 
In PAOLA-1, a higher proportion of patients in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm had ≥2 grade changes in 
haematological laboratory parameters, compared with patients in the placebo/bevacizumab arm. Anaemia 
was the most frequently reported CTCAE Grade ≥3 AE. The only significant changes in clinical chemistry 
parameters occurred for blood creatinine and proteinuria. Creatinine increases are a recognised ADR for 
olaparib. Proteinuria is a recognised ADR for bevacizumab.  
Assessment of potential for hepatic and renal impairment was consistent with data reported from olaparib 
monotherapy clinical studies. 
Overall, the laboratory findings were consistent with available data from the olaparib pool. 
Safety data in special populations did not identify any differential effects by gender despite low number of 
men included and slight differences observed, which might rather be related to underlying diseases. In 
Assessment report  
EMA/523504/2020 
Page 140/150 
 
 
  
  
addition, similar proportion of AE was reported among the different age population with an increase of 
seriousness and discontinuation of treatment from younger to older groups. 
Consistent data were reported by race but these data should be interpreted with caution due to over 
representation of white patients compared to non-white patients. With regards to safety in Japanese 
participants, although the proportions of patients with any treatment emergent adverse events were 
similar between the Japan cohort and the overall safety analysis set, the incidence of treatment-emergent 
grade 3 and above adverse was higher in the Japan cohort than in the Safety Analysis in the 
olaparib/bevacizumab arm 73% and 58%, respectively. There is a higher incidence of haematology-
related adverse events in Japanese cohort compared with the overall safety analysis set. The higher 
haematology toxicity in Asian population compared with White populations was also observed in previous 
studies (SOLO1). It is unknown why Japanese participants have an increased haematological toxicity. The 
MAH provided one exposure-safety analysis in Asian/Japanese population based on pooled data from 
capsule and tablet monotherapy studies (Olaparib-MS-07) and another based on pooled data from tablet 
monotherapy studies (Olaparib-MS-08) (data not shown). The population pooled in these data set 
includes patients with various cancers (ovarian, breast, prostate or other advanced malignancies) possibly 
in different line of therapy. However, it remains unknown whether the differences in AEs between 
Japanese patients and the overall population in PAOLA-1 study were due to bevacizumab potentiation, 
disease setting or other factors. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall  the  safety  profile  of  olaparib  in  combination  with  bevacizumab  as  maintenance  treatment  is 
considered acceptable for the intended population and is generally consistent with the safety profile of the 
individual therapies. 
The  results  from  study  PAOLA-1  showed  that  there  were  no  high  differences  in  risk  of  the  combination 
therapy compared to placebo/bevacizumab group and compared to olaparib pooled safety data, except for 
lymphopenia and leukopenia. However, slightly more AE ≥ Grade 3 and more AE leading to dose adjustment 
of olaparib were reported with the combination compared to monotherapy. 
Nevertheless, patients experiencing ADRs need to be carefully followed by physicians as indicated in the 
SmPC. Furthermore, more information is needed to assess the causal relationship between olaparib and 
the potential risks as identified in the RMP. 
Overall, no new safety signals were identified from the analyses of safety data from both treatment arms 
of  PAOLA-1.  AEs  that  occurred  more  frequently  on  the  olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  than  in  the 
placebo/bevacizumab arm were consistent with the known safety profile of olaparib. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle

2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has  been  submitted  by  the  MAH  and  has  been  found  acceptable  for  the  following  reasons:  Overall,  the 
wording in the PL is similar to that already tested previously during the MA applications. Therefore, it is 
justified to consider the Package Leaflet User Testing report provided during review of the MA application 
procedure as relevant for this application, and that no updated document is needed for this submission. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The  proposed  indication  is  for  Lynparza  (tablet)  in  combination  with  bevacizumab  for  the  maintenance 
treatment of adult patients with advanced (FIGO stages III and IV) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian 
tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-
line platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab and whose cancer is associated with 
homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) positive status defined by either a BRCA1/2 mutation and/or 
genomic instability. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy are considered treatments of choice for patients 
with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer (NCCN Ovarian 2020, Karam et al 2017, Ledermann et al 
2013). For patients for whom upfront surgery is unlikely to achieve a complete resection, treatment consists 
of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy (NCCN 
Ovarian  2020).  Even  though  most  newly  diagnosed  advanced  ovarian  cancer  patients  achieve  complete 
response  at  the  end  of  first  line  treatment,  approximately  70%  relapse  within  the  first  three  years  of 
diagnosis (Ledermann et al 2013). Once ovarian cancer relapses, the disease becomes largely incurable. 
There  is  a  need  for  treatments  that  can  delay  relapse,  offering  the  possibility  to  improve  the  long-term 
outcome for these patients. 
Targeted treatments approved in the first line maintenance setting include olaparib for BRCAm patients 
(SOLO-1 study) and bevacizumab for frontline and maintenance therapy which can be given regardless of 
BRCAm status (study GOG-218).  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
PAOLA-1 was a phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of olaparib vs placebo added 
to bevacizumab for the maintenance treatment of newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer patients who 
were  in  response  following  first  line  platinum-based  chemotherapy  and  bevacizumab.  Patients  were 
randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either olaparib 300 mg bd plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg Q3W (N=537) 
or matching placebo bd plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg Q3W (N=269). Patients were enrolled regardless of 
the BRCAm status, but were stratified by tBRCAm  status, based on the prospectively conducted tumour 
tissue  testing.  The  primary  analysis  was  based  on  investigator  assessment  of  disease  progression  by 
RECIST; a sensitivity analysis was also performed using the BICR assessment. Key secondary objectives

included PFS2, OS (adjusted for multiplicity) TFST, TSST, time to earliest progression by RECIST or CA-125 
or death, TDT and HRQoL. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
At DCO (22 March 2019), the main analysis of investigator-assessed PFS showed a statistically significant 
improvement in PFS in the ITT population. Median PFS was 22.1 months in the olaparib/bevacizumab arm 
vs 16.6 months in the placebo/bevacizumab arm, with HR=0.59 (95%CI 0.49, 0.72), p<0.0001. 
Analysis of PFS by BICR and all other sensitivity analyses were consistent with the investigator assessment 
of  PFS.  Consistent  results  were  also  shown  in  the  subgroup  analyses  by  stratification  factors  (first  line 
treatment outcome and local tBRCAm status) and clinical characteristics. 
The interim PFS 2 data with 36.5% and 44.2% of events in olaparib/bevacizumab and 
placebo/bevacizumab arms respectively, showed a HR of 0.86 [0.69, 1.09], p=0.2097. 
The interim OS data were 25.9% mature and showed a HR of 1.01 [0.76 to 1.36] with a similar 
proportion of deaths occurring in each arm. At the DCO of 30 September 2019, the updated OS analysis 
showed a HR of 0.94; (95% CI 0.73 to 1.21) in the ITT population. 
In the subgroup of patients with deleterious tBRCA1/2m (based on local test results at randomisation), the 
PFS  HR  was  0.34  (0.23,  0.51).  The  median  PFS  was  37.2  months  in  olaparib/bevacizumab  arm  versus 
22 months in placebo/bevacizumab arms. The OS HR point estimate was reported as 0.66 (95% CI 0.37 to 
1.21) at DCO 30 September 2019. The subgroup analysis by tBRCA status by Myriad based on retrospective 
analysis of tumour sample was consistent with this analysis, with the OS HR point estimate of 0.61 (95% 
CI 0.34 to 1.09) at the same DCO. 
In  the  subgroup  of  patients  whose  tumours  were  classified  as  Myriad  HRD  positive  based  on  combined 
measurement of HR deficiency-associated biomarkers (either tBRCAm or HR deficiency-associated genomic 
instability)  in  retrospectively  analysed tumour  samples,  the  PFS  HR  was  0.33  (95%  CI  0.25,  0.45).  The 
median PFS was 37.2 months in olaparib/bevacizumab arm versus 17.7 months in placebo/bevacizumab 
arms. The OS HR point estimate was reported as 0.71 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.10) at DCO 30 September 2019.  
Additional  analyses  in  subgroups  of  patients  identified  by  genomic  instability  biomarker  were  consistent 
with results of combined biomarker measurements.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Due to the absence of olaparib monotherapy arm, it remains currently unknown what is the contribution of 
components  of  such  VEGFi-PARPi  combination  therapy  in  maintenance  phase  and  whether  they  have 
additive,  synergistic  or  potentially  a  detrimental  effect  in  different  biomarker-defined  subpopulations  of 
patients, according to known mechanisms of action. Bevacizumab is indicated in the first-line maintenance 
setting  only  after  prior  concomitant  treatment  with  platinum-based  chemotherapy,  whereas  olaparib  is 
indicated  in  first-line  maintenance  after  platinum-based  chemotherapy  in  the  subgroup  of  BRCA1/2-
mutated (germline and/or somatic) patients. The contribution of olaparib could only be assessed as add-on 
therapy to bevacizumab used in both arms concurrently with chemotherapy and in maintenance setting for 
the total duration of treatment up to 15 months. 
In the subgroup of patients without prospectively detected tBRCAm by local test (non-tBRCAm subgroup), 
PFS HR estimate was of 0.7 (95% CI 0.57, 0.86) while OS HR estimate was 1.02 (95% CI 0.77, 1.36). 
Consistently, in the Myriad non-tBRCAm subgroup HR was 1.04 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.4) at DCO 30 September 
2019. 
Assessment report  
EMA/523504/2020 
Page 145/150 
 
 
  
  
As observed in the subgroup analyses by tBRCA mutation status, an inconsistency in treatment effect was 
also  observed  in  pre-specified  subgroup  analyses  by  Myriad  HRD  status  combining  measurements  of 
tBRCAm and HRD score (GIS, genomic instability score), as well as in subgroups defined using GIS only. 
Notably, in subgroups defined as negative for biomarkers of HR deficiency, OS HR estimates at relatively 
low maturity were exceeding 1, although with large 95% CI.  
PFS 2 and OS data are still immature and are confounded by exposure to PARP inhibitors outside of the 
study.  The  MAH  is  recommended  to  provide  updated  PFS  2  and  OS  data  including  additional  analyses 
adjusting for impact of subsequent PARP inhibitor treatment.   
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety profile of the combination therapy appears to be the juxtaposition of both safety profiles 
of  olaparib  and  bevacizumab  with  slight  differences  in  terms  of  frequency  and  severity  compared  to 
individual treatments and no emergence of new AE. 
The majority of AEs were reported during the first 3 months of treatment and included among the most 
reported  events  known  AE  of  olaparib  (anaemia,  lymphopenia,  leukopenia,  neutropenia,  nausea  and 
vomiting) as well as known AE of bevacizumab (hypertension, proteinuria and hemorrhagic events). 
AE  related  to  olaparib  were  mainly  manageable  by  treatment  interruption  (54.4%)  or  dose  modification 
(41.1%)  and  supportive  treatment.  These  proportions  were  higher  in  combination  than  for  olaparib  in 
monotherapy (39.7% and 21.4% respectively). 
Discontinuation  of  treatment  due  to  AEs  was  reported  in  20.4%  and  5.6%  of  patients  treated  with 
olaparib/bevacizumab and placebo/bevacizumab, respectively. 
Compared  to  olaparib  monotherapy,  two  AE,  lymphopenia  and  leukopenia,  were  more  reported  in 
combination with bevacizumab.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Long-term  safety  data  of  the  combination  therapy  are  limited  with  only  10-months  data.  Long-term 
exposure to/potential toxicity to olaparib is included in the list of safety concerns under missing information 
in the risk management plan.  
Uncertainties  remain  for  olaparib  on  potential  risks  of  AML/MDS,  new  primary  malignancies  and 
pneumonitis. The causality of olaparib in occurrence of rare cases of AML/MDS, new primary malignancies 
and pneumonitis could not be firmly established in the context of previous courses of chemotherapy. These 
safety issues will continue to be closely monitored in the post-marketing setting.

*HRD  positive  status  was  defined  in  this  study  by  using  a  combined  measurement  of  two  biomarkers 
associated with HR deficiency: tBRCAm and HR deficiency-associated genomic instability. 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
An improvement of 5.5 months in median PFS, with a HR of 0.59 in the ITT population is considered clinically 
relevant,  keeping however  in  mind  that  only  patients  responding to initial  chemotherapy  in  combination 
with bevacizumab have been randomised to receive maintenance treatment.  
Differential  effects  in  the  subgroups  defined  by  biomarkers  of  HR  deficiency  (tBRCAm,  HR  deficiency-
associated  genomic  instability  or  combination  thereof)  and  insufficient  follow-up  for  key  secondary 
endpoints (PFS2 and OS) do not allow to exclude for the time being potential detrimental effects in smaller 
or larger subgroups defined as biomarker-negative.  
Absence of effect on PFS is reported in patients whose tumours are not associated with HR deficiency by 
either biomarker (defined as HRD negative by combining results for both biomarkers used) while a large 
magnitude of effect is observed in the subgroups defined as biomarker-positive (tBRCAm and/or genomic 
instability).  Furthermore,  with  the  updated  OS  data,  it  cannot  be  excluded  that  treatment  with  the 
combination  may  be  associated  with  poorer  OS  in  patients  whose  tumours  are  not  associated  with  HR 
deficiency. These findings are considered plausible and of relevance based on strong biological plausibility 
for differential outcomes in the context of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer with subpopulations of patients 
with  potentially  differential  degree  of  HR  deficiency  and  consequently  different  magnitude  of  benefit 
following  treatment  with  PARPi.  Besides  biological  rationale,  previously  reported  data  with  olaparib  in 
relapsed  setting  support  this  trend  of  lower  magnitude  of  benefit  or  absence  of  such  depending  on  the 
definition of subgroups by biomarkers of HRD.  
It is noted that an HRD test is not available to date in Europe and different cut-offs are used across different 
PARPi studies to determine positivity for a genomic instability score. However, a greater treatment effect 
was consistently observed across several trials using Myriad HRD test at predefined cut-off (42). Post-hoc 
analyses using only the genomic instability score (GIS) at this cut-off showed comparable results to the 
one in the HRD subgroups. There is also a biological rational supporting genomic instability as a biomarker 
predicting magnitude of PARPi activity. 
In conclusion, the therapeutic efficacy of combining olaparib and bevacizumab in the first line maintenance 
setting in patients with ovarian cancer without defined positivity for biomarkers associated with homologous 
recombination deficiency is not considered demonstrated. 
Overall,  combination  therapy  of  olaparib  and  bevacizumab  was  well-tolerated  with  a  manageable  safety 
profile  which  is  sufficiently  characterised.  While  hematologic,  digestive  and  vascular  ADRs  occurred  at  a 
high  frequency,  they  are  generally  of  low  grade  and  easily  manageable.  More  dose  adjustments 
(discontinuation, interruption or dose reductions) were reported which is not unexpected for a combination 
of  2  active  therapies  with  known  safety  profiles  (e.g.  haematological  and  GI  toxicity  for  olaparib  and 
hypertension  for  bevacizumab).  These  higher  rates  should  be  viewed  in  the  context  of  maintenance 
treatment which might need for dose optimisation. Discontinuation of treatment due to AEs was reported 
in  higher  proportion  of  patients  treated  with  olaparib/bevacizumab  than  with  placebo/bevacizumab.  In 
addition,  data  for  long-term  safety  remain  limited.  Long  term  safety  will  continue  to  be  monitored  as 
reflected in the RMP.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The magnitude of the observed effect in the ITT population should be considered in the context of the 
maintenance setting treatment, current uncertainties on the long-term outcomes and in regard to 
contribution of components in different subpopulations defined by biomarkers of HR deficiency.  
Benefit-risk is considered favourable in the subgroup of patients identified as harbouring tumour 
BRCA1/2m. In patients without defined positivity for this biomarker (BRCAwt and/or unknown), but with 
higher degree HR deficiency-associated genomic instability identified based on a validated test, the 
overall efficacy and safety data support that benefits outweigh risks in line with biological plausibility and 
results of subgroup analyses. In HRD-negative subgroup of patients, defined as biomarker-negative for 
both biomarkers used, an additional PFS benefit with olaparib beyond that seen with bevacizumab has not 
been established. Therefore, the indication is restricted to exclude patients that would not benefit from 
treatment or with magnitude of benefit that would not outweigh risks. 
Safety results of PAOLA-1 study seem to be in line with both safety profile of olaparib and bevacizumab 
with slight differences in terms of frequency and severity. Measures to minimize the risk are well 
addressed in the RMP submitted by the MAH. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Lynparza in combination with bevacizumab is considered positive for the maintenance 
treatment of adult patients with advanced (FIGO stages III and IV) high-grade epithelial ovarian, 
fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion 
of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab and whose cancer is 
associated with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) positive status defined by either a BRCA1/2 
mutation and/or genomic instability.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, II and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include the use of Lynparza tablets in combination with bevacizumab for the 
maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced (FIGO stages III and IV) high-grade epithelial 
ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following 
completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab and whose cancer 
is associated with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) positive status defined by either a 
BRCA1/2 mutation and/or genomic instability. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 of the 
SmPC are updated. The PL is updated accordingly. In addition, sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC for 
Lynparza hard capsules are revised based on updated safety data analysis. Furthermore, the PI is brought 
in line with the latest QRD template version 10.1. The RMP version 20.3 is approved. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I, II and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Lynparza is not similar to Zejula within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1.

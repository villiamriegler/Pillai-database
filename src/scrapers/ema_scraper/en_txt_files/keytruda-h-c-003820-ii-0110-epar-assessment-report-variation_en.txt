2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The scope of this variation is to extend the existing therapeutic indications for Keytruda to include an 
indication in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as 
monotherapy as adjuvant treatment after surgery, for the treatment of adults with locally advanced, 
inflammatory, or early-stage triple-negative breast cancer at high-risk of recurrence.  
Epidemiology  
In 2020, breast cancer was the most commonly diagnosed malignancy (24.5%) and the leading cause 
of cancer death (15.5%) among women (Sung H, 2021). In Europe (40 countries), the expected 
numbers of new cases and deaths from breast cancer in 2020 were 531,086 and 141,765, respectively 
(Globocan Cancer Observatory).  
TNBC represents approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers (Howard, 2021). 
Assessment report  
EMA/257879/2022  
Page 8/138 
 
 
 
 
Biologic features 
TNBC is phenotypically defined by a lack of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) 
expression and the absence of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression or 
amplification.  
TNBC is a heterogeneous entity that encompasses six subtypes with distinct molecular characteristics 
(basal-like 1 and 2, mesenchymal, mesenchymal stem-like, immunomodulatory, luminal androgen 
receptor) (Lehmann, 2011).  
Approximately 15% of subjects with TNBC carry deleterious BRCA mutations (Sharma, 2014). 
The role of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) as a potential prognostic and/or predictive 
biomarker has been intensively explored, with controversial results (Miglietta, 2019). The dynamic 
nature of PD-L1 has been evaluated in the neoadjuvant setting, where modifications of PD-L1 
expression from baseline to post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) breast cancer samples were 
reported (Dieci, 2020; Bianchini, 2020). TNBC is the most frequently breast cancer type infiltrated by 
Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) and there is high interest around the potential prognostic and 
predictive value (Dieci, 2021), although to date TILs are not yet considered a routine pathological 
marker in early-stage TNBC (Burstein, 2021). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
TNBC is associated with higher tumor grade at diagnosis, a higher risk of distant disease recurrence, 
particularly to visceral organs and brain, and poor clinical outcomes, with most of the relapse occurring 
within the first 3 years after surgery (Dent, 2007; Lin, 2012). The 5-year EFS and OS rates are ~71% 
and ~77%, respectively for patients with clinical stage II-III (Sikov, 2019). 
Management 
According to ESMO and NCCN guidelines, medical management of early-stage breast cancer has been 
based on systemic chemotherapy given prior to (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) definitive surgery. 
For high-risk, early-stage breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy NACT is believed to be 
advantageous, as it can increase the ability to resect tumors, increase breast conservation rates, 
enable the in vivo evaluation of efficacy of systemic therapy, and provide long-term prognostic 
information (Cardoso, 2019; NCCN 2021). While chemotherapy is typically given as adjuvant in Stage 
I, NACT is preferred in stage II and III disease (Burstein, 2021). Patients with TNBC should receive 
chemotherapy (ChT), with the possible exception of low-risk ‘special histological subtypes’ such as 
secretory or adenoid cystic carcinomas or very early (T1aN0) tumours, the standard anthracycline-
based regimens are anthracycline (AC) or epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (EC). Sequential use of 
anthracyclines and taxanes is superior to concomitant use and is also much less toxic. Some data 
suggest that a taxane/anthracycline sequence may be slightly more effective than the traditionally 
used anthracycline/taxane order but both are acceptable. Chemotherapy should be administered for 
12–24 weeks (4–8 cycles) (Cardoso, 2019).  
The use of carboplatin in the neoadjuvant TNBC setting has shown an increased pathological complete 
response (pCR) rate according to literature, although with no consistent Event Free Survival 
improvement, and at the expenses of worse haematological toxicity (Loibl S, 2021; Poggio, 2018; 
Pandy, 2019), so there is no unanimously consensus as yet on the inclusion of carboplatin in 
neoadjuvant therapy for TNBC (Burstein HJ, 2021). 
Assessment report  
EMA/257879/2022  
Page 9/138 
 
 
 
In general, patients who achieve pCR after neoadjuvant treatment have demonstrated sustained 
clinical benefit (Cortazar, 2014). There has been no correlation established between the magnitude of 
difference in pCR between treatment arms and long-term outcomes as assessed by EFS and OS at the 
study level (Huang, 2020). Further, the relationship between pCR and long-term outcomes for 
immunotherapy is currently unknown. The risk stratification based on pCR following neoadjuvant 
therapy is a strategy for optimizing post-neoadjuvant treatment (Burstein HJ, 2021). Adjuvant 
capecitabine is an option in TNBC for patients with residual disease (Burstein HJ, 2021; Masuda, 2020; 
Lluch 2020). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Pembrolizumab is a highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to human programmed 
cell death 1 (PD 1) and blocks the interaction between the PD-1 pathway receptor and its ligands, 
programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2) on antigen presenting tumor cells. 
In the EU, pembrolizumab is currently approved, as monotherapy and in combination with other 
agents, for the treatment of melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, HNSCC, MSI-H or dMMR cancer (CRC, 
endometrial carcinoma, gastric, small intestine, or biliary cancer), urothelial cancer, oesophageal 
cancer, breast cancer, endometrial carcinoma, cervical cancer and cHL.  
With regard to the TNBC indication, pembrolizumab received positive CHMP opinion in September 2021 
in combination with chemotherapy for locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic TNBC with PD-L1 
expression CPS ≥ 10, based on the results of the phase III study KEYNOTE-355. This is the second 
extension of indication sought for pembrolizumab in this disease, in the earlier setting 
neoadjuvant/adjuvant, based on KEYNOTE-522 trial.

2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH claimed that KEYNOTE-522 study was conducted in accordance with local and/or national 
regulations (including all applicable data protection laws and regulations), ICH-GCP and with the 
ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Clinical trials carried out outside 
of the European Union meet the ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC as claimed by the MAH. 
The assessment of KEYNOTE-522 data did not raise concern over GCP compliance leading to request 
for GCP inspection. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by

are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Pembrolizumab is a protein, therefore an 
ERA has not been submitted by the MAH. This is acceptable.

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
No new data were submitted. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The posology proposed is: in the neoadjuvant setting in combination with chemotherapy, Keytruda 
should be administered for 8 doses of 200 mg every 3 weeks or 4 doses of 400 mg every 6 weeks or 
until disease progression that precludes definitive surgery or unacceptable toxicity, followed by 
adjuvant treatment with KEYTRUDA as monotherapy for 9 doses of 200 mg every 3 weeks or 5 doses 
of 400 mg every 6 weeks or until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. 
The 8 doses in the neoadjuvant setting are driven by the standard neoadjuvant treatment that is 
typically 4 cycles of taxane (12 x weekly dosing) followed by 4 cycles of 
anthracycline/cyclophosphamide combination (e.g., doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 or epirubicin 90 mg/m2 
Q3W + cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 Q3W). 
No clinical data are currently available in participants with high-risk, early-stage TNBC at 400 mg Q6W. 
The 400 mg Q6W regimen is considered a suitable dosing option for pembrolizumab based on the 
expected similarity of PK exposures, target saturation, efficacy and safety profile with those for the 
approved dosing regimens of 200 mg Q3W or 2 mg/kg Q3W. The 400 mg Q6W dosing regimen was 
approved in the EU for all adult monotherapy indications (procedure number 
EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0062) and for all adult indications in combination with other anticancer agents 
(procedure number EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0102).

days prior to the first dose of trial treatment. 
Treatments 
Neoadjuvant phase: patients received carboplatin 3 weekly or weekly + paclitaxel weekly for four 
cycles (12 weeks), followed by doxorubicin or epirubicin + cyclophosphamide every 3 weeks for 4 
cycles (12 weeks), for a total of 24 weeks of neoadjuvant treatment. Along with chemotherapy, 
pembrolizumab/placebo was administered every 3 weeks for a total of 24 weeks (8 cycles). 
Within 3 to 6 weeks of the last cycle of neoadjuvant therapy, definitive breast surgery was performed. 
Adjuvant phase: patients received pembrolizumab/placebo every 3 weeks for 9 cycles (27 weeks).  
The Adjuvant Treatment Phase was planned to start 30 to 60 days after definitive surgery. 
Postoperative radiation therapy was administered if indicated, with adjuvant pembrolizumab/ placebo 
may have been started either concurrently with radiation therapy or 2 weeks post-radiation therapy.

Table: study treatment 
Rationale for treatment selection 
Carboplatin in combination with weekly paclitaxel at 80 mg/m2 vs paclitaxel followed by the standard 
anthracycline/cyclophosphamide combination has shown increased pCR rates as neoadjuvant 
treatment for TNBC via 2 randomized trials using either weekly carboplatin at AUC 2 (the Phase II 
GeparSixto trial; Von Minckwitz G, 2014), or carboplatin at AUC 6 Q3W (the Phase III CALGB 40603 
trial; Silkov WM, 2015). Due to toxicity, in the GeparSixto trial, the dose of carboplatin was reduced to 
AUC 1.5. A meta-analysis by Petrelli et al. to compare TNBC patients who received carboplatin vs. 
those who did not receive carboplatin in the neoadjuvant setting, showed the risk of not having a pCR 
for those without carboplatin was 1.45 (95% CI, 1.25-1.68, p<0.0001; Petrelli F, 2014) compared to 
those who have received carboplatin. In the CALGB 40603 study the carboplatin AUC 6 Q3W plus 
weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 arm showed statistically significant increase in Grade 3/4 neutropenia 
(56% vs. 22%) and Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia (20% vs. 4%) compared to paclitaxel alone arm. 
Therefore, in KEYNOTE-522 study, paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 5 Q3W or AUC 1.5 QW 
have been selected as a novel combination regimen to be combined with pembrolizumab.

Definition of Pathological Complete Response (pCR) Rate (ypT0/Tis ypN0) 
Pathological complete response rate (ypT0/Tis ypN0) is defined as the proportion of subjects without 
residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast 
specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy 
by AJCC staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery. 
Subjects who don’t receive any study medication and subjects who are discontinued from the study 
treatment and continue neoadjuvant treatment with drug categories not specified by the study prior to 
definitive surgery will be classified as not having a pCR (non-responders) in the efficacy analyses, 
regardless of the results obtained from the surgery. Subjects who are discontinued from study 
treatment due to the reasons that preclude definitive surgery (including the development of distant 
metastatic disease) are considered non-responders. Subjects without pCR data due to any reason will 
be counted as non-responders. 
Definition of Event-Free Survival (EFS): EFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first 
occurrence of any of the following events: progression of disease that precludes definitive surgery, 
local or distant recurrence, second primary malignancy or death due to any cause. Progression of 
disease, local or distant recurrence, and second primary malignancy are based on investigator 
determination.  
Subjects who had locoregional PD (as assessed radiologically) during the neoadjuvant treatment 
phase, but went to definitive surgery and had clear margins, will not be classified as having an EFS 
Assessment report

event. If the subject had pCR, then the PD will be considered pseudoprogression. Subjects who had 
locoregional PD (as assessed radiologically) during the neoadjuvant treatment phase, but went to 
surgery and ended up with positive margins at their last surgery, will be classified as having an EFS 
event at the time of diagnosis of locoregional PD. Subjects who had distant PD (metastasis, confirmed 
by biopsy or 2 imaging studies at least 4 weeks apart, if a biopsy is not feasible) during the 
neoadjuvant treatment phase had an EFS event at the time of diagnosis of distant PD, even if the 
subjects had palliative breast surgery. Subjects who did not have PD during the neoadjuvant treatment 
phase, but had positive margins at their last surgery, will be classified as having an EFS event at 
surgery. Subjects who had cytological, histological, and/or radiological evidence of local or distant 
recurrence during the adjuvant phase had an EFS event at the time recurrence was diagnosed. In 
terms of second primary malignancy, any confirmed diagnosis of a second primary cancer other than 
basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or second primary breast 
will be considered an event in the analysis of the EFS. Lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast (LCIS), 
ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast (DCIS) and myelodysplastic syndrome are not considered an 
event. 
Tumor assessment 
Assessment of disease progression/recurrence includes (per local or institutional guidelines): disease 
progression that precludes definitive surgery, local or distant recurrence, development of a second 
primary malignancy, or death, and it was performed on D1 of each cycle, at surgery, at 30 days FU 
post-surgery, and on D1 of each adjuvant cycle. Long-term follow-up visits were scheduled at 3-month 
intervals from the date of randomization for the first 2 years, then at 6-month intervals for Years 3 to 
5, and annually thereafter until occurrence of local or/and distant disease progression/ recurrence, 
death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first. Imaging (eg, CT, MRI, 
Bone Scan) were performed at the discretion of the investigator, as per the local institution’s standard 
of care, or at the time of symptoms except for subjects participating in the MRI substudy. Disease 
assessment was performed per RECIST 1.1, if applicable.

Sample size 
The study was planned to randomize approximately 1150 subjects in a 2:1 ratio between the two 
arms.  
Assumptions and methodologies used for sample size calculation are described below. 
The study includes multiple hypotheses: 
- dual primary hypotheses testing superiority of pembrolizumab compared to placebo in pCR (ypT0/Tis 
ypN0) or EFS in subjects with locally advanced TNBC; 
- secondary hypothesis testing superiority in OS in subjects with locally advanced TNBC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/257879/2022  
Page 22/138 
 
 
 
 
The overall Type-I error was strongly controlled at 2.5% (one-sided) among the multiple hypotheses, 
with 0.5% initially allocated to the pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) hypothesis and 2.0% initially allocated to the 
EFS hypothesis. The study uses the graphical method of Maurer and Bretz (Maurer, 2013) to control 
multiplicity for multiple hypotheses (dual primary hypotheses and the secondary hypothesis). 
The following efficacy interim analyses (IAs) were planned: 
- two IAs are planned for the rate of pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) and should be at least 3 months apart; 
- seven efficacy IAs are planned in addition to the FA for EFS. The timing of IAs for EFS is calendar-
based and the IAs are planned to be conducted annually after 2 years. In addition, the FA for EFS 
needs to be at least 1 year apart from the last IA. 
The sample size was driven by EFS. 
Sample Size and Power Calculations for pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) Rate 
The first primary endpoint is pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) rate. The pCR analysis was to be performed after 
enrollment is completed, and ~1000 subjects would have completed surgery (if continuing on 
treatment) after ~6 months neoadjuvant treatment. A sample size of ~1000 gives ~95% power to 
detect a true pCR rate difference of 15% (pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs. placebo + 
chemotherapy) at alpha = 0.5% (one-sided). The sample size calculation is based on the following 
assumptions: 1) alpha of 0.5% is allocated to the pCR hypothesis; 2) the underlying pCR is 50% in the 
placebo + chemotherapy arm, and there is 15% increase in pCR in the pembrolizumab + 
chemotherapy arm (pCR of 65%) in subjects with locally advanced TNBC; and 3) a drop-out rate of 
~10%. In addition, a Hwang-Shih-DeCani alpha-spending function with gamma parameter (0) is used 
to implement group sequential boundaries that control the Type-I error. The power for the pCR 
endpoint at different true pCRs for subjects with locally advanced TNBC (62%, 65%, 67%) is 77%, 
95%, and 99% (summarized in Table below).

15 percentage points  
17 percentage points  
77% 
95% 
99% 
All calculations assume pCR is 50% in the placebo + chemotherapy arm. 
The assumptions for a pCR rate of 50% in the placebo + chemotherapy arm were based on the estimates 
from Sikov et al., 2015, and von Minckwitz et al., 2014. 
Sample Size and Power Calculations for EFS 
The other dual-primary endpoint is EFS. The final analysis of the study is EFS event-driven and will be 
conducted after approximately 327 EFS events have been observed, unless the study is terminated early. 
It may occur at ~102 months after first subject randomized (depending on enrollment rate and event 
accumulation rate). With the alpha of 2% (one-sided) and sample size of ~1150, the trial has an overall 
~80% power for EFS in subjects with locally advanced TNBC, assuming the true HR (pembrolizumab vs. 
placebo)  is  0.71.  According  to  published  meta-analysis  on  this  population  that  suggests  a  ~50%  of 
subjects may be disease-free in a long-term (Cortazar, 2014), a cure rate model is applied to account 
Assessment report  
EMA/257879/2022  
Page 23/138 
 
 
 
 
for the failure rates decreasing over time (Hurley, 2013). These calculations are based on the following 
assumptions:  (1)  EFS  follows  a  Poisson  mixture  model  (cure  rate  model  with  decreasing  failure  rate) 
distribution with ~78% EFS rate at 36 months and ~50% cure rate in the placebo arm, (2) an enrollment 
period of 18 months and at least 84 months follow-up. (3) A yearly drop-out rate of 2% and additional 
~3% to ~5% drop-out rate after surgery. The EFS control rate of 78% was estimated from an updated 
report from CALGB40603, presented at SABCS 2015 (Sikov, 2015-abstract SABC). In addition, a Lan-
DeMets  O'Brien-Fleming  approximation  alpha-spending  function  is  constructed  to  implement  group 
sequential boundaries that control the Type-I error.  
OS 
The key secondary endpoint is OS. If the null hypothesis for EFS is rejected at an interim analysis, the 
final OS analysis is event-driven and will be conducted after approximately 297 OS events would have 
been observed, unless the study is terminated early. It may occur at ~102 months after first subject 
randomized (depending on enrollment rate and event accumulation rate). If after 102 months after the 
first subject randomized the estimated number of OS events still haven’t been observed, then the final 
OS analysis may be conducted at that time with the remaining alpha. With the α of 2% (one-sided) and 
sample size of ~1150, the trial has an overall ~79.7% power for OS in subjects with locally advanced 
TNBC, assuming the true HR (pembrolizumab vs. placebo) is 0.70. According to published meta-analysis 
on this population that suggests ~50% of subjects may be disease-free long-term (Cortazar, 2014), a 
cure rate model is applied to account for the failure rates decreasing over time (Hurley, 2013). These 
calculations are based on the following assumptions: (1) OS follows a Poisson mixture model (cure rate 
model with decreasing failure rate) distribution with ~81% OS rate at 36 months (Sikov, 2015-abstract 
SABC) and ~50% cure rate in the placebo arm, (2) an enrollment period of 18 months and at least 84 
months  follow-up,  and  (3)  A  yearly  drop-out  rate  of  3%.  In  addition,  a  Lan-DeMets  O'BrienFleming 
approximation α-spending function is constructed to implement group sequential boundaries that control 
the Type-I error. 
Amendment of the protocol involving sample size calculation 
In amendment 02 of the protocol (01-May-2018), the sample size increased from ∼ 855 to ∼1150. The 
primary  reason  of  such  increase  (see  table  below)  occurred  because  of  changes  in  the  analysis  plan 
based  on  emerging  data  from  the  CALGB40603  study:  assumption  of  EFS  rate  at  36  months  in  the 
control arm was changed from 60% to 78% and the dropout rate after surgery has been increased. 
Table: primary reasons for Amendment 2 
Data used for the above update were however already available at time of original protocol finalization 
in 2016 (Sikov, 2015-abstract SABC). The MAH reported the following reason to justify the choice: 
-  NCCN guidelines were updated to include adjuvant capecitabine as an option for patients with 
TNBC who do not achieve pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy [Masuda, N., et al 2017] 
Assessment report  
EMA/257879/2022  
Page 24/138 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
in 2017, following discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the MAH decided 
not to allow adjuvant capecitabine in the KEYNOTE-522 so as not to confound the final results; 
an amendment was required to adjust the control EFS rate and drop-out rate after surgery to 
account for the potential impact of not allowing the use of adjuvant capecitabine; 
based on data from GALGB40603 (N=443), presented at SABCS 2015 (Sikov WM et al, 2015), the 
3-year EFS rate for patients with high-risk early-stage TNBC who were treated with platinum-
containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy was ~74%. 
- 
by expecting that more participants would not achieve pCR (~40%) and would opt for adjuvant 
capecitabine, the MAH expected an additional improvement in the 3-year EFS rate in the control 
arm from 74% to ~78%. 
The EFS rate at 36 months obtained in the control arm was 76.8%, a value consistent with value 
assumed in sample size calculation. 
Software used for sample size calculation 
The sample size and power calculations were performed in the software R (package “gsDesign”). 
Number of patients enrolled in the study and in analyses 
Based  on  monitoring  of  randomization  implemented  centrally  using  IVRS,  and  on  screening  status  of 
patients at time of approaching the desired enrollment, 1174 have been randomized. First patient was 
enrolled on 7-mar-2017, last participant was randomized on 24-sep-2018. IA1 was carried out at data 
cutoff 24-sep-2018, and IA2 at data cutoff 24 apr-2019. 
Randomisation 
KEYNOTE-522 was a randomized study, with randomization ratio 2:1 between treatment arms.  
Stratification factors are as follows: 
1. Nodal status (positive vs. negative) 
2. Tumor size (T1/T2 vs. T3/T4) 
3. Choice of Carboplatin (Cb): Q3W vs. Weekly 
Randomization was implemented centrally using IVRS and monitored on a regular basis.

Blinding (masking) 
KEYNOTE-522 is a double-blind study. All pathologists reviewing and interpreting surgical specimens 
for assessment of pCR were blinded to treatment assignment. Results of the interim analyses were 
reviewed by an external DMC, which make recommendations for discontinuation of the study or 
modification to an EOC of the Sponsor, who may be unblinded to study results at the treatment level 
together with limited additional Sponsor personnel in order to act on these recommendations or 
facilitate regulatory filing. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy Analysis Populations: the Intention-to-Treat Population (ITT) population will serve as the 
population for primary efficacy analyses. All randomized subjects will be included in this population. 
Subjects will be included in the treatment group to which they are randomized. 
PRO Analysis Populations: PRO analyses are based on the PRO Full Analysis Set (FAS) population, 
defined as randomized subjects who have at least one PRO assessment available and have received at 
least one study treatment. 
Error probabilities, adjustment for multiplicity 
The dual primary hypotheses are testing superiority of pembrolizumab compared to placebo in pCR 
(ypT0/Tis ypN0) or EFS in subjects with locally advanced TNBC. The secondary hypothesis is testing 
superiority in OS in subjects with locally advanced TNBC. The overall Type-I error among the multiple 
hypotheses is strongly controlled at 2.5% (one-sided), with 0.5% initially allocated to the pCR 
(ypT0/Tis ypN0) hypothesis and 2.0% initially allocated to the EFS hypothesis. The study was 
considered a success if pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) or EFS is demonstrated to be statistically significant at 
either an IA or the FA under multiplicity control. The study uses the graphical method of Maurer and 
Bretz to control multiplicity for multiple hypotheses as well as IAs.

Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses 
Pathological Complete Response (pCR) Rate  
The stratified Miettinen and Nurminen’s method was used for the comparison of pCR rates using three 
definitions between 2 treatment arms (pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs. placebo + chemotherapy). 
The difference in pCR rate and its 95% CI from the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen’s method with 
strata weighting by sample size will be reported for subjects with locally advanced TNBC and for 
individuals with PD-L1 (+) tumors. The stratification factors used for randomization will be applied to 
the analysis.  
Sensitivity analyses will be performed for pCR rates using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. Associated 
odds ratios and 95% CIs will be calculated. Additional supportive unstratified analyses may also be 
provided. 
For pCR rate calculation (see endpoint definition), the following assumptions were reported: Subjects 
who don’t receive any study medication and subjects who are discontinued from the study treatment 
and continue neoadjuvant treatment with drug categories not specified by the study prior to definitive 
surgery will be classified as not having a pCR (non-responders) in the efficacy analyses, regardless of 
the results obtained from the surgery. Subjects who are discontinued from study treatment due to the 
reasons that preclude definitive surgery (including the development of distant metastatic disease) are 
considered non-responders. Subjects without pCR data due to any reason will be counted as non-
responders. 
Assessment report  
EMA/257879/2022  
Page 27/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the primary pCR analysis, per clinical judgment subjects who using same neoadjuvant regimens but 
different doses/schedules from those specified in the study may not be considered as using new anti-
cancer therapy in neoadjuvant treatment prior to definitive surgery. Sensitivity analysis may be 
provided by imputing these subjects as “non-responders” for conservative consideration. 
Event-Free Survival (EFS) 
The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the EFS curve in each treatment 
group. The treatment difference in EFS will be assessed by the stratified log-rank test. A stratified Cox 
proportional hazard model with Efron’s method of tie handling will be used to assess the magnitude of 
the treatment difference (i.e., HR) between the treatment arms. The HR and its 95% CI from the 
stratified Cox model with Efron's method of tie handling and with a single treatment covariate will be 
reported. Kaplan-Meier estimates and the corresponding 95% CIs at two-year, three-year and five-
year will be provided for subjects with locally advanced TNBC and for individuals with PD-L1 (+) 
tumors. The stratification factors used for randomization will be applied to both the stratified log-rank 
test and the stratified Cox model. Censoring rules for primary and sensitivity analyses are reported in 
table below:

Sensitivity analyses with different definitions for EFS may be performed to evaluate the robustness of 
the EFS analysis. 
The proportional hazards assumption on EFS will be examined using both graphical and analytical 
methods if warranted. The log[-log] of the survival function vs time for EFS may be plotted for the 
comparison between pembrolizumab and placebo arms. If the curves are not parallel, indicating that 
hazards are not proportional, supportive analyses may be conducted to account for the possible non-
proportional hazards effect associated with immunotherapies using, for example, Restricted Mean 
Survival Time (RMST) method or a parametric method. 
One assumption for stratified Cox proportional hazard model is that the treatment HR is constant 
across the strata. If strong departures from this assumption are observed (which can result in a 
Assessment report

notably biased and/or less powerful analysis), a sensitivity analysis may be performed based on a two-
step weighted Cox model approach by Mehrotra et al., 2012 [6], in which the treatment effect is first 
estimated for each stratum, and then the stratum specific estimates are combined for overall inference 
using sample size weights. Additional supportive unstratified analyses may also be provided. 
Overall Survival (OS) 
Statistical methods used for analysis of EFS will be used also for analysis of OS.  
Subjects in the combination of placebo and chemotherapy arm are expected to discontinue treatment 
earlier compared to subjects in the combination of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy arm and are not 
allowed to crossover to the combination of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy arm; however, they may 
be treated with another anti–PD-1 drug. As an exploratory analysis, adjustment for the effect of 
crossover on OS may be performed using recognized methods (e.g., the Rank Preserving Structural 
Failure Time (RPSFT) model proposed by Robins and Tsiatis, two-stage model), based on an 
examination of the appropriateness of the data to the assumptions required by the methods. Additional 
supportive unstratified analyses may also be provided.

Interim analyses 
Seven efficacy interim analyses (IAs) in addition to the FA are planned.  
IAs planned for the rate of pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) should be at least 3 months apart. The timing of IAs 
for EFS is calendar-based and the IAs are planned to be conducted annually after 2 years. In addition, 
the FA for EFS needs to be at least 1 year apart from the last IA. Expected EFS events will have been 
observed at IA2, IA3, IA4, IA5, IA6, IA7, and final analyses are 93, 154, 201, 239, 270, 294, and 327, 
respectively.

Boundary for superiority hypotheses 
Boundary for pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) 
The trial initially allocates α=0.005, one-sided to test pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0). Bundary properties for the 
IAs were derived using a Hwang-Shih-DeCani α- spending function with gamma parameter (0). If the 
actual number of subjects at the pCR analysis differs from those hypothesized, the bounds will be 
adjusted using the Hwang-Shih-DeCani α-spending function accordingly.  
This study has achieved Last Patient In (LPI) on Sep. 24th, 2018, by then there are total 1174 subjects 
have been randomized and as pre-specified per protocol the first 602 (> 500) randomized subjects 
have completed surgery after ~6 months neoadjuvant or would have completed surgery if continuing 
by LPI. This sample size is defined based on the operational criteria, which includes subjects 
randomized as late as 9 months prior to LPI. The 9 months (270 days) interval includes 6 months 
neoadjuvant treatment, 2 months surgery window per protocol, and 1 month from surgery to data 
available in-house (obtaining the pathology report and site entering data in clinical database). Based 
on the ITT principle, 602 subjects are the first 602 randomized subjects (chronologically). Therefore, I 
interim pCR analysis will be conducted in the first 602 randomized subjects (IA1 Population). 
A supportive analysis is to summarize the EFS and OS data in IA1 Population and all randomized 
subjects. This analysis will be performed at IA1 and no hypothesis testing will be performed. A 
Haybittle-Peto type adjustment with p<0.0001 is applied for EFS and OS summary in IA1, respectively. 
The HR and its 95% CI from the stratified Cox model will be reported, and Kaplan-Meier curve will be 
provided. No additional sensitivity analyses and/or supportive analyses for EFS and OS will be provided 
in this IA.

Interim Analysis 2 (Interim EFS Analysis and Final pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) Analysis) 
It is estimated that approximately 1000 subjects have or would have completed surgery after ~6 
months neoadjuvant treatment. If more than 1000 subjects have or would have surgery data in IA2, 
the pCR results from additional subjects may be included in the analyses. 
Since the actual number of subjects in IA1 is 602, the bounds adjusted by using the Hwang-Shih-
DeCani α-spending function are shown in Table below.

If the test of pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) hypothesis does not achieve statistical significance at either IA1 or 
IA2, the p-value from IA2 (i.e., no new data is added after IA2) can be compared to an updated α-
level based on group sequential design with α=0.025 if the null hypotheses for both EFS and OS are 
rejected at a later time. It gives >99% power to detect a true pCR rate difference of 15 percentage 
points (pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs. placebo + chemotherapy) at α=0.025 (one-sided) and the 
observed difference in pCR between the treatment groups needs to be approximately 6.8 percentage 
points for the analysis to be considered positive. 
Boundary for Event-free Survival (EFS)  
The trial initially allocates α=0.02, one-sided to test EFS. If the null hypothesis for pCR (ypT0/Tis 
ypN0) is rejected, its α=0.005 is fully reallocated to EFS hypothesis testing. Thus, the EFS null 
hypothesis may be tested at α=0.02, or α=0.025. 
Table below shows the boundary properties calculated based on the estimated number of events for 
each of these α-levels for the IAs and FA, which were derived using a cure rate model and Lan-DeMets 
O'Brien-Fleming spending function. Note that the final row indicates the total power to reject the null 
hypothesis for EFS at each α-level. If the actual number of events at the EFS analyses differ from 
those specified in the table, the bounds will be adjusted using the actual observed numbers of events 
and the Lan-DeMets O'Brien-Fleming spending function accordingly. At the time of final analysis, the 
spending time will be 1. Of note, the efficacy interim analysis 2 (IA 2) occurred prior to Amendment 04 
and as such the efficacy boundaries for EFS in IA 2 were calculated based on the estimated number of 
events.

Boundary for Overall Survival 
The study initially allocates α=0, one-sided to test OS and OS is tested only when the null hypothesis 
for EFS is rejected. Thus, the OS null hypothesis may be tested at α=0.02 (if the EFS null hypothesis is 
rejected but not the pCR [ypT0/Tis ypN0] null hypothesis) or α=0.025 (if both of pCR [ypT0/Tis ypN0] 
and EFS null hypotheses are rejected). Table below shows the boundary properties calculated based on 
the estimated number of events for each of these α-levels for the IA and FA, which were derived using 
a cure model and Lan-DeMets O'BrienFleming spending function. Note that the final row indicates the 
total power to reject the null hypothesis for OS at each α-level. Similar to EFS, if the actual number of 
events at the OS analyses differs from those specified in the table, the bounds will be adjusted using 
the actual observed numbers of events and the Lan-DeMets O'Brien-Fleming spending function 
accordingly. Of note, at the time of final analysis, the spending time will be 1. If EFS is found to be 
positive at an interim, but not OS, OS may continue to be followed.

Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup Analyses and Effect of Baseline Factors are planned. 
To determine whether the treatment effect is consistent across various subgroups, the estimate of the 
between-group treatment effect (with a nominal 95% CI) for the primary endpoints will be estimated 
and plotted within each category of the following classification variables in subjects with locally 
advanced TNBC and in individuals with PD-L1 (+) tumors (CPS ≥1): 
• Nodal status: Positive vs. Negative 
• Tumor size: T1/T2 vs. T3/T4 
• Choice of Carboplatin (Cb): Q3W vs. Weekly 
• Tumor PD-L1 status using different cutoff values for CPS (applies to all subjects with locally advanced 
TNBC): CPS ≥1 vs. CPS <1; CPS ≥10 vs. CPS <10; CPS ≥20 vs. CPS <20) 
• Overall Stage: Stage II vs. Stage III 
• Menopausal status (for females only): pre- vs. post-menopausal

• Age: <65 years vs. ≥65 years 
• Geographic region: Europe/Israel/North America/Australia vs. Asia vs. Rest of World 
• Ethnic origin: Hispanic vs. Non-Hispanic 
• ECOG performance status: 0 vs. 1 
• HER2 status: IHC 2+ (but FISH-) vs. IHC 0-1+ 
• LDH: >upper limit of normal [ULN] vs. ≤ULN 
Similar analysis may be conducted for key secondary endpoint (overall survival), if needed. For tumor 
PD-L1 status subgroup analyses, stratified model using stratification factors at randomization may be 
used. For all other subgroup analyses, unstratified model may be used.

The 7 patients who did not start neoadjuvant treatment did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria (5 
patients, all in the experimental arm) or decided not to proceed with neoadjuvant treatment (1 patient 
in the experimental and 1 patient in the control arm). 
Surgery: A total of 5 patients in the experimental arm (0.6%) vs 0 did receive surgery but did not 
receive study medication. Overall, participants without surgery were 16 (2%) in the experimental arm 
and 9 (2.3%) in the control arm.                                    
Screen failure: A total of 1608 participants were screened. Of those, 434 participants failed 
screening, and 1174 participants were randomized. The main reason for screen failure was not having 
centrally confirmed TNBC (41.7%), not willing and able to provide written informed consent for the 
trial (20.6%) and not having previously untreated M0 TNBC with staging as defined by inclusion 
criteria (20.4%).

Numbers analysed 
Efficacy analyses were based on the ITT population (N=1174), which included all randomized 
participants (784 in the pembrolizumab arm and 390 in the control arm). 
pCR was analysed at IA1 and IA2:  
- 
The IA1 Population includes the first 602 participants randomly assigned to study treatment; IA1 
was prespecified to occur when ≥500 participants have or would have completed surgery after 
approximately 6 months neoadjuvant treatment and enrolment was completed (data cut-off 24 
SEP 2018) 
- 
The IA2 Population includes the first 1002 participants randomly assigned to study treatment. 
IA2 was prespecified to occur approximately 24 months after the first participant was randomized 
(calendar driven). Approximately 93 EFS events were estimated at the time of IA2 and 
approximately 1000 participants have or would have completed surgery after approximately 6 
months neoadjuvant treatment (data cut-off 24-APR-2019). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Results from the Interim Analysis 4 have been submitted, with a data cut-off date of 23 March 2021.  
The median follow-up duration was similar between treatment arms (37.8 and 37.6 months in the 
pembrolizumab and placebo groups, respectively).

Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
•  Rate of Pathological Complete Response (ypT0/Tis ypN0) 
pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) was tested twice, at the time of IA1 (interim analysis for pCR, data cut-off 24-
SEP-2018) and at IA2 (final analysis for pCR, data cut-off 24-APR-2019). The success criterion for the 
primary pCR hypothesis was met at IA1 with a p-value that crossed the prespecified boundary for 
statistical significance of 0.003, and continued to show a statistically significant improvement in the 
pembrolizumab + NAC group at IA2. pCR was not formally tested at IA4 for the ITT population as pre-
specified in the SAP, however a supportive pCR analysis (estimation) was conducted with all 
randomized participants at IA4 (data cutoff 23-MAR-2021).

•  Event-free Survival 
EFS in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group had an HR of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.82), 
with a one-sided p-value of 0.0003093 that crossed the prespecified boundary for statistical 
significance (0.00516941) at IA4.  
EFS was previously tested at IA2 and IA3, not reaching statistical significance at the previous interim 
analyses. Across IAs, the EFS HR has remained consistent, being 0.63 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.93) at IA2 and 
0.65 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.88) at IA3.

Each row reflects the number of participants for the corresponding metastases site, a participant may be counted for 
multiple distant sites. 
If the location was reported as "other", it is classified for the site of metastases based on the clinical identification.  
The axilla site of metastases is from a participant who reported lesion site detail of "multiple right axillary, 
supraclavicular, superior mediastinal, internal mammary chain lymphadenopathies and clustered subcutaneous 
nodularities in the right chest wall."

"Sudden death" refers to unknown death reason. 
Last treatment includes definitive surgery and radiation therapy. 
Database Cutoff Date: 23MAR2021 
Among patients who died within 90 days from last treatment, in 3 out of 7 in the experimental arm 
and in 1 out of 1 in the control arm, death was considered treatment-related by investigator

(pneumonitis in 1 participant in the neoadjuvant phase, pulmonary embolism in 1 participant in the 
adjuvant phase, and autoimmune encephalitis in 1 participant in the adjuvant phase related to 
pembrolizumab; septic shock in the neoadjuvant phase related to chemotherapy in the control arm). 
No safety signals were identified upon review of these fatal events. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
•  Overall survival  
At IA4, given that the primary hypothesis of EFS was successful, the secondary hypothesis of OS was 
formally tested at the same alpha level of 2.5% according to the protocol multiplicity strategy.  
The success criterion for the secondary OS hypothesis was not met as the observed one-sided p-value 
did not cross the multiplicity-adjusted one-sided prespecified p-value boundary at IA4 of 0.00085861.

There was a total of 7 patients who died within <=6 months from randomization, mostly the 
experimental arm (6 vs 1 in the experimental vs control arm). 
- pembrolizumab arm: 2 deaths for PD, 1 death for pneumonitis (related), 1 death for more multiple 
AEs (MOF and sepsis related, myocardial infarction not related) 1 for death (although considered not 
related, this subject has an AEOSI of hepatitis before death), 1 death for pneumonia (not related) 
- control arm: 1 septic shock (related) 
Further, there was a total of 20 patients who died within 6 -12 months from randomization mostly in 
the experimental arm (16 vs 4 in the experimental vs control arm). 
- pembro arm: 12 deaths for PD, 1 for pulmonary embolism (related), 1 for sudden death (not 
related), 1 for shock (not related), 1 for cardiorespiratory arrest 
- control arm: 4 deaths for PD 
In the time interval 12-18 months from randomization there were 17 vs 19 deaths in the experimental 
vs control arm, and in the time interval 18-24 months from randomization 21 vs 11 deaths occurred in 
the experimental vs control arm, respectively. 
•  Rate of Pathological Complete Response according to alternative definitions 
pCR results using the alternative definitions of ypT0 ypN0 (i.e., no invasive or noninvasive residual in 
breast or nodes) and ypT0/Tis (i.e., no invasive cancer in the breast irrespective of ductal carcinoma in 
situ or nodal involvement) were analyzed as secondary endpoints.

•  Health-related QoL 
Health-related QoL assessments was carried out using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-B23 
within and across the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment phases, in all participants and in 
participants with CPS≥1. 
Neoadjuvant phase: A timeframe of 21 weeks for analysis of completion rate in the neoadjuvant phase 
was selected based on a prespecified requirement for a minimum completion rate of 60%. The 
completion rates of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and of the EORTC QLQ-BR23 were above 90% in both the 
pembrolizumab + NAC and placebo + NAC groups at baseline and was approximately 80% at Week 21. 
Compliance rates in the neoadjuvant phase, defined as the percentage of participants completing the 
measure among those expected to complete the measure (i.e., not missing by design), were similar at

baseline in both the pembrolizumab + NAC and placebo + NAC groups among all participants (over 
90%) and remained high (close to 90%) at Week 21. 
Over 21 weeks of follow-up in the neoadjuvant phase, all participants in the pembrolizumab + NAC 
and placebo + NAC groups had similar decreases in the global health status/QoL score of EORTC QLQ-
C30.  Scores on the physical functioning scale of the EORTC QLQ-C30 were worse for the 
pembrolizumab + NAC treatment group when compared with the placebo + NAC treatment group, 
while scores on the emotional functioning scale indicated no differences between the 2 treatment 
groups. 
Participants in both treatment groups had similar decreases (improvement) in the prespecified breast 
symptoms scale score. The between-group difference in LS mean score changes from baseline at Week 
21 were similar for all participants. 
Adjuvant phase: A timeframe of 24 weeks for analysis of completion rate in the adjuvant phase was 
selected based on the prespecified requirement for a minimum completion rate of 60%. The

placebo groups at baseline and remained >80% at Week 24. Compliance rates in the adjuvant phase, 
defined as the percentage of participants completing the measure among those expected to complete 
the measure (i.e., not missing by design), were similar at baseline in both the pembrolizumab and 
placebo groups and remained high at Week 24 (approximately 90%). 
Over 24 weeks of follow-up in the adjuvant phase, decrease (worsening) in scores on the global health 
status/QoL, physical functioning, and emotional functioning scales were generally similar between the 
2 treatment groups for all participants based on EORTC QLQ-C30.  
Participants in both arms had similar decreases (improvement) in the prespecified breast symptoms 
scale score based on EORTC QLQ-BR23.

Summary of results according to PD-L1 expression status  
In the ITT population, overall 82.9% of patients were PD-L1 CPS≥1, 48.6% were PD-L1 CPS≥10, and 
31.3% were PD-L1 CPS≥20. PD-L1 status was not a stratification factor. Assessment of pCR, EFS and 
OS  in  PD-L1  positive  population  (CPS≥1)  were  among  secondary  endpoints,  but  not  included  in  the

Post-hoc subgroup analysis by age <40 and ≥40 (n=185 vs 89 patients): 
- pCR difference -1.1 (95% CI: -13.5, 12.2) 
- EFS HR of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.39, 1.38) 
Baseline characteristics in patients < and >=40 years appeared overall well balanced between 
treatment arms, with the exception of slightly higher number of patients with nodal positive status in 
the experimental arm (55.1% vs 48.3%), on the contrary slightly more patients with stage II disease 
in the experimental arm (73.5% vs 68.5%), of unclear impact on results. 
Pre-specified sensitivity analyses for Event free survival 
- Sensitivity analysis 1: EFS HR 0.64 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.84) 
Any events after 2 consecutive missed disease assessments or after initiation of post-surgery new 
anticancer therapy, were censored at last disease assessment prior to the earlier date of ≥2 
consecutive missed disease assessments and initiation of post-surgery new anticancer therapy, and if 
no events before new anticancer therapy, participants were censored at last disease assessment before 
initiation of post-surgery new anticancer treatment.  
- Sensitivity analysis 2: EFS HR 0.63 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.82) 
New anticancer therapy to treat metastatic disease was also considered for defining an EFS event.  
- Sensitivity analysis 3: EFS HR 0.65 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.85) 
Positive margins at a participant’s last surgery was excluded from the EFS event definition. 
- Sensitivity analysis 4: EFS HR 0.63 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.84) 
Both positive margins at a participant’s last surgery and second primary malignancy were excluded 
from the EFS event definition. 
-  Sensitivity analysis 5: EFS HR 0.63 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.82)  
Second breast primary malignancy was included in the EFS event definition.  
- Additional sensitivity analysis: EFS HR 0.65 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.85) 
positive margins at last surgery were excluded from the EFS definition and secondary breast cancer 
and new anticancer therapy for metastatic disease were included as EFS events.  
Prespecified Exploratory Event-free Survival Analyses 
A prespecified exploratory analysis of EFS by pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) outcome (yes vs no) was performed 
as an unstratified subgroup analysis. EFS showed improvement that favoured pembrolizumab + NAC / 
pembrolizumab for participants who achieved pCR and those participants who did not achieve pCR. 
pCR was highly associated with long-term outcome as measured by EFS, which is consistent with the 
large meta-analysis performed by Cortazar (Cortazar et al, 2014). As this analysis is a nonrandomized 
comparison, the results need to be interpreted with caution.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The applicant is seeking an extension of indication for Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy as 
neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as monotherapy as adjuvant treatment after surgery, for 
the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced, inflammatory, or early-stage triple-negative 
breast cancer (TNBC) at high-risk of recurrence. This submission is based on the final analysis of pCR 
and on an interim analysis of EFS of the pivotal study KEYNOTE-522. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
KEYNOTE-522 is a phase III, randomized (2:1), double-blind study to evaluate pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy vs placebo plus chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy and pembrolizumab vs placebo 
as adjuvant therapy for TNBC.  
Adult patient with centrally confirmed non metastatic TNBC were included. According to protocol, 
subjects must have evidence of M0 disease based on the assessments from their initial diagnosis, and 
if suspected regional or distant metastasis during screening, subjects should have been thoroughly 
evaluated as clinically indicated. Inclusion was allowed for tumour size >1 cm but ≤2 cm in diameter 
(T1c) with nodal involvement (N1-2) or tumour size > 2 cm in diameter (T2-4) regardless of nodal 
involvement (N0-2), corresponding to stage IIB-IIIA/B. According to guidelines, neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy is the preferred choice for stage II and III TNBC (Burstein, 2021). The study excluded 
stage I (and stage IIA); for stage I adjuvant therapy is preferred according to guidelines (Burstein, 
2021). The inclusion/exclusion criteria are considered overall acceptable and define a patient 
population for whom (neo)adjuvant treatment is clearly indicated. However, according to treatment 
guidelines for subjects with T1C tumors (> 1cm) treatment is also recommended without lymph node 
involvement (and treatment should be considered for tumor ≥ 0.6 cm). Nonetheless, the exclusion of 
Assessment report  
EMA/257879/2022  
Page 70/138 
 
 
 
these subjects with a lower risk of recurrence in the pivotal study can be considered acceptable. The 
studied population is reflected in the proposed wording of the indication “locally advanced, or early-
stage TNBC at high-risk of recurrence”, with details of the tumor size (in cm) and nodal status reported 
in section 5.1 of the SmPC (a reference to section 5.1 has been included in the indication wording in 
4.1 of the SmPC).  
Patients were enrolled regardless PD-L1 status, which was centrally assessed in archival or newly 
obtained formalin-fixed tumor samples collected prior to any treatment by means of the PD-L1 IHC 
22C3 pharmDx assay.  PD-L1 was not a stratification factor, although assessment of pCR, EFS, OS and 
QoL data were predefined in individuals with PD-L1 (+) tumors (CPS ≥1) as secondary endpoints. 
Nonetheless, distribution by PD-L1 status with CPS 1 cutoff appears balanced between treatment arms 
(83.7% vs 81.3% CPS ≥1 in the pembrolizumab vs the placebo arm). The stratification factors were 
instead choice of tumor size and lymph node status, which is justified as both factors are prognostic 
and correlated with outcome, and smaller tumors/N0 disease are more likely to obtain pCR. The 
stratification factor weekly vs 3-weekly dosing of carboplatin was based on potential difference in 
tolerability which may affect the ability of patients to complete prescribed regimens and ultimately 
efficacy outcome. The stratification factors are deemed acceptable. 
The backbone chemotherapy used in the neoadjuvant part of the treatment consisted in four cycles 
(12 weeks) of carboplatin (given weekly or 3 weekly) plus paclitaxel weekly followed by four cycles (12 
weeks) of 3 weekly doxorubicin or epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (not dose dense). Granulocyte-
colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was administered after each cycle of chemotherapy, although its use 
was recommended but not mandated. Within 3-6 weeks from end of neoadjuvant treatment, breast 
surgery was performed, after that adjuvant treatment with pembrolizumab/placebo 3 weekly for 9 
cycles (27 weeks) was administered, for a total of approximately 1 year of systemic therapy. The trend 
of 1-year adjuvant immunotherapy has been established by convenience, not necessarily based on 
precise cancer growth kinetic models. 
Postoperative radiation therapy was given in accordance with the standard of care, as applicable, in 
54.1% in the pembrolizumab arm vs 64.1% in the control arm, in most cases sequentially.  
The justification for the choice of the backbone chemotherapy regimen is acknowledged. The treatment 
intensification by the addition of carboplatin to paclitaxel in the neoadjuvant TNBC setting has shown 
an increased pCR rate according to literature, although with no consistent EFS improvement, and at 
the expenses of worse haematological toxicity (Loibl S, 2021; Poggio, 2018; Pandy, 2019), so the 
inclusion of platinum agents as neoadjuvant chemotherapy for TNBC remains controversial (Burstein 
HJ, 2021; NCCN 2021). The inclusion of carboplatin, equally in both treatment arms, is acceptable. AC 
was administered every 3 weeks, and not as dose-dense regimen every 2 weeks (Burstein HJ, 2021; 
NCCN 2021). The treatment with dose-dense regimens with primary prophylaxis is overall considered a 
standard of care for high-risk, early breast cancer. The EBCTCG metanalysis (Gray, 2019) 
demonstrated an impact of dose-dense regimens on recurrence-free, breast-specific and overall 
survival. For the type and comorbidity burden of patients enrolled in the clinical trial object of this 
application, the population is generally deemed eligible to ddAC (Burstein, St Gallen, 2021). Based on 
the analysis of data on drug, no relevant differences in exposure between arms have been however 
observed that could affect the ultimate results.  
Regarding the adjuvant phase, capecitabine is an option for patients with residual invasive cancer after 
neoadjuvant therapy in TNBC (Burstein, 2021; NCCN, 2021). Patients without achieving pCR were not 
offered the option to be treated with capecitabine; however, this was not yet definitely recommended 
at the start of the trial therefore can be considered acceptable. The decision not to allow adjuvant 
capecitabine was agreed with FDA in 2017 so as not to confound the final results. Further, recent 
evidence showed that adjuvant therapy with olaparib for 1 year extended DFS in patients with high-

risk early-stage HER2-negative breast cancer (including TNBC) with BRCA1/2 germline mutations (and 
no pathological complete response if neoadjuvant therapy was administered), according to the phase 
III OlympiA trial (Tutt, 2021). However, at the time of study design such options were not included in 
treatment guidelines (Senkus, 2015), so the comparison vs placebo is accepted.  
KEYNOTE-522 study is designed to evaluate whether the addition of pembrolizumab as a neoadjuvant 
and adjuvant treatment is beneficial compared to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were 
not re-randomized by pCR status after surgery. By this design, it is not possible to disentangle the 
contribution of pembrolizumab in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting on the EFS and OS outcome, 
nor to correlate the impact of the observed pCR improvement with the EFS outcome. Regrettably, the 
MAH did not request CHMP Scientific Advice before designing this study. It is therefore uncertain 
whether neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant pembrolizumab are both needed, but any conclusion in this 
regard is impossible based on this pivotal study. No other ongoing pembrolizumab trials in TNBC would 
be able to clarify this aspect. As a result, it is considered that the data provided may only be discussed 
for a possible indication for pembrolizumab as neoadjuvant AND adjuvant treatment.  
The study had dual primary endpoint of pCR and EFS. OS was a secondary endpoint. The primary 
definition of pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) is in line with current EMA guidelines (EMA/CHMP/703715/2012 Rev. 
2) and thus acceptable. pCR according to alternative definitions were analysed, and results were in line 
with the primary analyses. The definition of EFS (time from randomization to the first occurrence of 
progression of disease that precludes definitive surgery, local or distant recurrence, second primary 
malignancy or death due to any cause) is considered acceptable as well. The definition of EFS was 
refined with protocol Amendment 2 with the inclusion of positive surgical margins as EFS events. 
Second breast primary malignancy were instead excluded from the EFS definition. Sensitivity analyses, 
excluding positive margin as event and including primary breast cancer as event, respectively, were 
reassuringly consistent with the primary analysis.  
Primary endpoints were not verified: pCR was assessed by the local pathologist and EFS was assessed 
by the investigator; in this context it is of concern that “imaging (eg, CT, MRI, Bone Scan) were 
performed at the discretion of the investigator”, although it is acceptable that the timing of clinical 
disease assessment was defined at specific timepoints and same in each arm. It is acknowledged that 
the study has been conducted double-blind for the neoadjuvant and the adjuvant part; nonetheless 
treatment assignment might be suggested due to differences in toxicities at least in the adjuvant 
treatment phase. The fact that imaging was performed at investigator’s discretion is relevant for EFS 
analysis, especially with regard to the assessment of distant metastases. However, the double-blind 
design and additional data provided during the procedure did not raise concern over any relevant 
impact on results.  
Sample size calculation was driven by EFS. For sample size calculation for pCR rate, a sample size of 
~1000 gives ~95% power to detect a true pCR rate difference of 15% at alpha = 0.5% (one-sided). 
For sample size calculation for EFS, with the alpha of 2% (one-sided) and sample size of ~1150, the 
trial has an overall ~80% power for EFS, assuming the true HR is 0.71. The assumption for EFS was 
updated with Amendment 2 (occurred before IA1) leading to an increased sample size from 855 to 
1150, and the justification provided was deemed acceptable.  
Multiplicity strategies were adopted for control type I error. The overall type-I error rate over the dual 
primary endpoints was 2.5% (one-sided) with 0.5% allocated to pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) and 2.0% 
allocated to EFS hypotheses according to Maurer and Bretz approach. 
Statistical methods appear overall appropriate.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 1174 participants were randomized (784 in the experimental arm and 390 in the control 
arm). As of data cutoff for Interim analysis 4 (IA4), no participants remained on study intervention. An 
overall higher proportion of discontinuation from all treatments in the pembrolizumab arm compared to 
the placebo arm (37.1% vs 27.2%). This difference is driven by discontinuation due to AEs in the 
neoadjuvant setting (14.3% in the pembrolizumab arm vs. 5.1% in the placebo arm) highlighting an 
impact of the additional toxicity of pembrolizumab. 
The overall number of clinically important protocol deviations appears limited, and no relevant impact 
on the study results is envisaged.  
Overall, the baseline characteristics appear balanced between treatment groups. The majority of 
randomized participants were female (only 1 male in the experimental arm), with median age of 49 
years (<65 years 89%), white (63.5%), premenopausal (56%), and with ECOG PS 0 (87%); about 
half of the patients were enrolled in Europe. Regarding disease characteristics, the most common 
tumor size was T2 (68%), approximately half were node negative, with 75% of subjects with overall 
Stage II disease. With regard to PD-L1 expression, most participants (83%) had a CPS ≥1, treatment 
arms appear overall balanced for PD-L1 expression at various cut-off analysed (1, 10 and 20). 
Carboplatin was administered weekly in 57% of the patients; the use of doxorubicin (67%) or 
epirubicin was balanced. 
The MAH has submitted the results of the IA4 (data cut-off date 23 March 2021), with a median follow-
up duration of approximately 37 months.  
Baseline characteristics of responders (i.e. yes pCR) and non-responders (i.e. no pCR) appear overall 
similar between treatment arms (data not shown). As compared to responders, non-responders were 
older, mostly post-menopausal, and more patients had more advanced tumors (stage III and tumor 
size T3/4). Further, there were more patients with tumor having a PD-L1 expression below a certain 
cut-off (1, 10, 20) among non-responders than among responders. No relevant differences are noted 
between IA1, IA2 and IA4. 
No relevant unbalances or difference in baseline characteristics of patients enrolled between IA1-IA2 
and IA2-IA4 are observed. The pCR difference noted between IA1, IA2 and IA4 seems mostly related 
to an increase in the pCR rate in the placebo group, while the pCR rate in the pembrolizumab group 
remained consistent between each IA. 
Pathological complete response (pCR) 
There were two pre-specified analyses for the primary endpoint pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0), an interim (at 
IA1) and a final analysis (at IA2). An updated descriptive analysis was provided at IA4. pCR met the 
predefined criteria for success at the interim analysis in 602 patients (pCR rate 64.8% vs 51.2%, Δ 
13.6% (95%CI 5.4, 21.8), p=0.00055) and at the final analysis in 1002 patients (pCR rate 64% vs 
54.7%, Δ 9.2% (95%CI 2.8, 15.6), p=0.00221). The descriptive analysis at IA4 including the entire 
ITT population (n=1174) showed pCR rate of 63% vs 55.6%, Δ 7.5% (95%CI 1.6, 13.4).  
The target Δ pCR between arms at the final analysis was 15%, but the point estimate was 9.2%, with 
the upper bound of CI minimally above the target (15.6%). The lower bond of CIs are disappointing 
(improvement in pCR rate of 2.8% at the final analysis, 1.6% at updated analysis). Acknowledging 
that pCR reached statistical significance, the clinical relevance of this result is questioned. The 
decreasing pCR difference noted between IA1, IA2 and IA4 seems mostly related to an increase in the 
pCR rate in the placebo group, while the pCR rate in the pembrolizumab group remained consistent 
between each IA. No relevant unbalances or difference in baseline characteristics of additional patients 
included in the subsequent analyses are observed. As compared to responders, non-responders were

older, mostly post-menopausal, and more patients had more advanced tumors (stage III and tumor 
size T3/4). Further, there were more patients with tumor having a PD-L1 expression below a certain 
cut-off (1, 10, 20) among non-responders than among responders.  
A pCR analyses according to alternative definitions (ypT0 ypN0, and ypT0/Tis) was consistent with the 
primary pCR analysis.   
Event Free Survival (EFS) 
At the IA4, EFS in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group had an HR of 0.63 (95% CI: 
0.48, 0.82), with a one-sided p-value of 0.0003093 that crossed the prespecified boundary for 
statistical significance (0.00516941). Such analysis is based on a not very high number of events 
(15.7% vs 23.8% in the experimental vs the control arm, respectively), corresponding to 
approximately 66% of EFS planned events for final analysis. EFS rate at 24 months was 87.8% (85.3, 
89.9) vs 81% (76.8, 84.6), and at 30 months 85.8% (83.1, 88) vs 78.2% (73.7, 82). KM curves 
separate at month 12 and progressively diverge in favour of the pembrolizumab-containing arm, 
although curves are no more interpretable after month 30 due to censoring.  
Most of the EFS events in both arms were distant recurrence (7.7% vs 13.1% in pembrolizumab vs 
placebo-containing arm, i.e. 49% vs 54.8% of the total EFS event in each respective arm). The most 
common sites for distant PD or distant recurrence as the first EFS event in both treatment groups were 
lung, brain, bone, liver and distant lymph node. In the neoadjuvant phase, there were 5 participants in 
the pembrolizumab + NAC group vs only 1 in the placebo + NACT who had an event of death recorded 
as the first EFS event within 90 days of the last treatment and in the adjuvant phase 2 vs 0. Death 
was considered treatment-related by investigator (pneumonitis in 1 participant in the neoadjuvant 
phase, pulmonary embolism in 1 participant in the adjuvant phase, and autoimmune encephalitis in 1 
participant in the adjuvant phase related to pembrolizumab; septic shock in the neoadjuvant phase 
related to chemotherapy in the control arm). No safety signals were identified upon review of these 
fatal events.                                                                   
The provided DFS analysis at IA4 has been performed when all patients have completed/discontinued 
all treatment. As the last patient was randomized approximately 2.5 years before the analysis, all 
subjects were observed for at least one year out of treatment, and this is important especially as an 
active adjuvant therapy was compared to no treatment (last patient randomized on 24-SEP-2018, data 
cut-off date 23-MAR-2021 for the analysis, for an overall estimated duration of treatment of 1-1.5 
years including surgery).  
Further, the peak of recurrence in TNBC is within the first 2-3 years after initial diagnosis, decreasing 
thereafter (Dent, 2007; Lin, 2012). The median follow-up time at IA4 is approximately 37.6 months so 
most of the highest risk period would have been observed. However, EFS curves are no more 
interpretable after month 30 and at visual inspection a plateau has not yet been reached, the latter 
relevant in the context of a curative treatment. It is on the other hand reassuring that the results of 
prior EFS interim analyses are consistent with the latest one with regard to the direction of the curves.  
Taking all aspects above into account, the EFS benefit showed in KEYNOTE-522 is recognized and it 
has been assessed at a reasonable timepoint; although updated EFS data might provide further 
reassurance, EFS data appear stable, and it is considered unlikely that subsequent EFS interim analysis 
(next due in March 2023) will relevantly change the overall result.  
Overall survival (OS) 
OS was formally tested at IA4 per prespecified multiplicity strategy, but statistical significance was not 
met. With 10.2% vs 14.1% of OS events in the experimental vs the control arm (45% of the events 
needed for final analysis), OS HR was 0.72 (95%CI 0.51, 1.02), p=0.0321377. OS rate at 24 months

were 92.3% (95%CI 90.2, 94) vs 91% (95%CI 87.7, 93.5). KM curves are almost superimposed up to 
month 30, after that, curves are no more interpretable due to censoring. No conclusion can be drawn 
yet on OS due to the immaturity of the data. An earlier interim OS showed higher initial event/rate in 
the experimental compared to the control arm. OS KM curves indicated a slightly worse performance 
compared to the control arm in the first months. This is further corroborated by the result of an 
immature OS analysis performed at IA2 (data cut-off 24 Apr 2019), showing 31 (4%) v 15 (3.8%) OS 
events in the experimental vs control arm, respectively, HR of 1.09 (95%CI 0.59, 2.02). Therefore, 
additional details on deaths were provided and it was further observed that a total of 7 patients died 
within <=6 months from randomization, mostly in the experimental arm (6 vs 1), and additional 20 
patients died within 6 -12 months from randomization, again mostly in the experimental arm (16 vs 
4). The number of deaths in the experimental vs control arm, in the first 12 months from 
randomization (22 vs 5 overall), occurred for progression (14 vs 4) or AEs (7 vs 1) and are not 
particularly reassuring in the context of a curative setting. Unfortunately, the 2:1 randomization did 
not help in the safety assessment. As for safety, the worse toxicity of the combination pembrolizumab 
plus chemotherapy played a role, however no trend for specific AEs driving toxicity in the neoadjuvant 
setting is observed. The MAH noted that 5 patients who died early in the experimental arm out of 22 
were enrolled in Russia (4 from a site which was closed early), and subjects enrolled in Russia had 
baseline characteristics suggestive of worse prognosis as compared to patients enrolled in non-Russian 
sites, enrolled more commonly in the experimental arm (study was not stratified by region). Due to 
the small number of patients, the reason for this difference of deaths between treatment arms might 
be multifactorial and partly due to chance.  
Health-related QoL 
Quality of life was affected more in the neoadjuvant part than during the adjuvant phase in both arms, 
as expected based on the treatment load. Based on the data provided, it is agreed with the MAH that 
the addition of pembrolizumab to NAC followed by continued treatment with pembrolizumab as 
adjuvant therapy resulted in an overall similar HRQoL compared with placebo + NAC followed by 
continued treatment with placebo. 
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
Distant Recurrence free survival (DRFS) and Distant Progression or Distant Recurrence-free Survival 
(DPDRFS) were in favour of the pembrolizumab containing arm (HR 0.60 and 0.61, respectively) and 
supportive of EFS data.  
Pembrolizumab + NACT did not improve the rate of breast conserving surgery, and no relevant 
differences are observed in residual cancer burden I, II and III.  
Subgroup analyses 
The treatment effect in terms of pCR was generally consistent with the finding in the overall 
populations. The only subgroup where pCR point estimate is higher in the control arm is ECOG-PS-1, 
however the limited number of subjects in this subgroup preclude definitive conclusions. Similar trends 
are seen in OS, but the interpretation is hampered by immaturity of OS data. For EFS, HR estimates 
were <1 in all subgroups analysed, although in some of the subgroups the 95%CI crossed 1: T3/4, 
stage III, age >=65 years, region rest of the world, Hispanic ethnicity, ECOG-PS1, LDH> ULN.  
PD-L1 status: An improved EFS advantage and a positive OS trend (but OS is immature) is seen in 
patients with higher PD-L1 expression compared to lower PD-L1 expression (for cut-off 10 and 20), 
while the trend is almost reversed when considering the CPS cut-off of 1. Differently, pCR 
improvement is similar regardless PD-L1 expression based on the cut-off of 1. Interestingly, PD-L1 
positive tumors appears to have higher pCR rate with chemotherapy and overall longer survivals and 
Assessment report  
EMA/257879/2022  
Page 75/138 
 
 
 
less EFS/PS events in the control arm compared to the low expressors, in line with PD-L1 status as a 
favourable prognostic marker in this disease according to some literature data.  
Overall, a benefit for pembrolizumab based treatment compared to control treatment is seen across 
PD-L1 subgroups, so such data would not support restricting the indication according to PD-L1 
expression. This seems different from the metastatic TNBC setting where the predictive value of PD-L1 
status for pembrolizumab-based treatment was shown (KEYNOTE-355 and KEYNOTE-119 studies). 
However, results according to PD-L1 expression are not clearly interpretable and appear not consistent 
across strata/endpoints. The MAH provided exploratory results for CPS<1, CPS 1-9, CPS 10-20 and 
CPS ≥20 as requested. With the exception of OS result in the CPS 1-9 population, pCR EFS and OS 
data in all subgroups were overall in favour of the pembrolizumab containing arm. Results could be 
interpreted as a composite impact of prognostic and predictive factors resulting in an absolute benefit 
independent of PD-L1 status. 
Stage, T and N: those are known prognostic factors in early breast cancer. Overall, 75% of subjects 
had Stage II disease, 75% T1/2 and half were N-. As expected, patients with more advanced tumors 
at baseline (Stage III, T3/4, N+) had overall lower pCR rates and higher number of EFS and OS 
events. EFS and OS benefit of the experimental over control was consistent in Stage II and Stage III 
disease, although pCR delta was higher in Stage III. On the contrary, a higher EFS and OS benefit was 
seen in smaller tumors T1/2, but this is not evident for pCR, while for N status N+ disease achieved 
higher benefit from pembrolizumab in terms of pCR and OS but not EFS. No clear consistency across 
endpoints and subgroups is seen, but at this stage there is no evidence for lack of efficacy in one or 
more subgroups, justifying restricting the indication based on KEYNOTE-522 data.     
Age: In patients ≥65, lower pCR rates are observed compared to <65, although pCR difference 
between arms remain similar. Higher rates of EFS and OS events are reported in the over 65 
population, where no clear advantage is seen with the addition of pembrolizumab. The number of 
participants over 65 is however limited (11% of the ITT population) and CIs are wide; therefore, it is 
difficult to draw conclusions about this subgroup. A relevant subgroup to be considered in the 
treatment of breast cancer is young women population, usually defined as <40 years of age (Paluch-
Shimon S, 2019), which showed in this study almost no benefit of pembrolizumab in addition to NACT 
on improving the pCR. However, an HR point estimate <1 for EFS is observed.   
Exploratory EFS analysis by pCR 
A prespecified exploratory analysis of EFS by pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) outcome (yes vs no) was performed 
as an unstratified subgroup analysis. According to this analysis, EFS was better in patients achieving 
pCR compared to patients not achieving pCR. The comparison between patients in the pembrolizumab 
arm vs the control arm showed a similar HR estimate in the group of subjects who achieved pCR 
(0.70) and who did not (0.73), although the separation of curves occurred quite late at month 15. 
However, in absolute terms, the improvement of EFS is minimal in patients with pCR (EFS rate at 24 
months 96.5% vs 93.5%) and more marked in patients without pCR (EFS rate at 24 months 72.9% vs 
65.3%). The main limit of this analysis is that responders/ not responders is not a baseline 
characteristic, and the comparison is not randomized, so in the end no conclusions can be made. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
KEYNOTE-522 study showed statistically significant improvement of pCR at the final analysis (IA2) and 
EFS at the interim analysis (IA4). The EFS benefit of the pembrolizumab containing treatment over 
control arm is recognised; on the contrary, the clinical relevance of the observed pCR difference is 
questioned, but it is reassuring that both endpoints have the same direction. OS data is still immature, 
with a positive HR trend although curves are superimposed. Subgroups analyses are not always

coherent across subgroups and endpoints, but at present there is no indication of lack of benefit in 
some subgroups leading to restricting the indication. A higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to 
toxicity in the experimental arm was observed, especially when pembrolizumab is associated with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Given the timing and the results of the EFS analysis provided, an 
additional interim EFS analysis would unlikely revert the data seen so far. Due to the design of the 
study, it is not possible to disentangle the benefit of neoadjuvant and adjuvant pembrolizumab, and 
the treatment has to be considered in its entirety. The final results of KEYNOTE-522 study will be 
submitted post-approval as a PAM-REC. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Pembrolizumab is an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that acts by disrupting the interaction 
between PD-1 and its ligand (PD-L1) to enhance the efficacy of the endogenous immune response 
against neoplastic cells. Immune checkpoint molecules are, however, pivotal in assisting self-tolerance 
and minimizing tissue damage during active immune responses, and the interaction of PD1 and PD-L1 
is a key factor that limits T-cell activity in peripheral tissues. The safety profile of pembrolizumab is, 
therefore, characterised by the onset of autoimmune-like toxicities, defined as immune-related 
adverse events (IR-AEs), that are recognised as important identified risks in the RMP of 
pembrolizumab. IR-AEs known to vary according to type of malignancy, patient characteristics and 
individual susceptibilities; extensive safety data have been produced with pembrolizumab and showed 
that, although any organ can be affected by IR-AEs, involvement of colon, skin, lungs, endocrine 
organs and muscle-skeletal tissues is more frequently observed.  
Although most IR-AEs are mild and do not require immune-suppressive treatment, moderate and 
severe toxicity is usually managed with corticosteroids and, in rarer cases, additional 
immunosuppressive therapy is needed. The occurrence of IR-AEs may require discontinuation of 
pembrolizumab, depending on the specific AE and its severity.

Patient exposure 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics of pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group were 
generally well-balanced when compared with the placebo + NAC / placebo group (see the efficacy 
section above). All enrolled participants had newly diagnosed, locally advanced early-stage TNBC, the 
majority of participants were female, <65 years of age, premenopausal, and had an ECOG score of 0. 
Most participants (82.9%) had a tumor tissue PD-L1 expression score of CPS ≥1. More participants in 
the mTNBC monotherapy group had an ECOG PS status of 1 or missing compared to the 
pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group. Compared with the RSD, a higher percentage of

participants in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group were female, <65 years of age, 
Asian, and had an ECOG PS of 0. 
Adverse events 
Adverse events (AEs) were coded using MedDRA Version 23.1. The incidence of (AEs) in the combined 
neoadjuvant + adjuvant phases of study KN522 is summarised in Tables below:

The incidence of AEs was generally similar between the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab and 
placebo + NAC / placebo group. In the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group, there was a 
higher incidence (≥5 percentage point difference) of SAEs, serious drug-related AEs, and 
discontinuations of any drug due to an AE (including due to drug-related AEs, SAEs, or drug-related 
SAEs). 
Except for the overall incidence of AEs, deaths due to AEs, and discontinuations due to SAEs, all other 
AE parameters had higher incidences (≥5 percentage point difference) in the pembrolizumab + NAC / 
pembrolizumab group compared with the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD. This was anticipated, as 
participants in KEYNOTE-522 received carboplatin- and anthracycline-based NAC in addition to 
pembrolizumab. 
AEs (all and drug-related), Grade 3 to 5 AEs (all and drug-related), serious AEs (SAEs, all and drug-
related), AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (all and drug-related), AEs leading to treatment 
interruption (all and drug-related), and AEOSIs occurred more frequently during the neoadjuvant 
phase compared with the adjuvant phase, likely due to the concomitant chemotherapy during the 
neoadjuvant phase (see Tables below).

Common AEs 
The frequency, type, and severity of AEs reported during the study in the pembrolizumab + NAC / 
pembrolizumab group generally reflected the contributions of the established individual safety profiles 
of the chemotherapy administered (carboplatin- and anthracycline-based NAC) and pembrolizumab 
monotherapy. The most frequently reported AEs (incidence ≥30%) in the pembrolizumab + NAC / 
pembrolizumab group were nausea, alopecia, anaemia, neutropenia, fatigue, constipation, diarrhoea, 
vomiting, and ALT increased. The most frequently reported AEs (incidence ≥30%) in the placebo + 
NAC / placebo group were nausea, alopecia, anaemia, neutropenia, fatigue, constipation, diarrhoea, 
and arthralgia (see Table below).

 Every participant is counted a single time for each applicable row and column. 
 A specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the columns meets the incidence criterion in 
the report title, after rounding. 
 For KN522, included adverse events started from the first treatment including definitive surgery and radiation therapy and up to 30 
days of the last treatment including definitive surgery and radiation therapy for the non-serious adverse events and up to 90 days 
of the last treatment including definitive surgery and radiation therapy for the serious adverse events. For the other studies, non-
serious adverse events up to 30 days of last dose and serious adverse events up to 90 days of last dose are included. 
 MedDRA preferred terms "Neoplasm Progression", "Malignant Neoplasm Progression" and "Disease Progression" not related to 
the drug are excluded.

AEs (incidence ≥15%) with a greater risk difference for pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab during 
the study were pyrexia, hypothyroidism, diarrhea, rash, and decreased appetite. These events were 
primarily Grade 1 or 2 and mostly occurred during the neoadjuvant phase. In both treatment groups, 
most AEs occurred in the first 3 months of initiating study intervention: the exposure-adjusted event 
rate decreased at 3 to 6 months and continued to decrease beyond 12 months. 
The overall incidence of AEs observed in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group was 
generally consistent with the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD. There was a higher incidence (≥20 
percentage point difference) of the following AEs in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group 
compared with the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD: nausea, alopecia, anaemia, neutropenia,

constipation, ALT increased, and neutrophil count decreased. These differences were consistent with 
the established safety profiles of the chemotherapies administered during the neoadjuvant phase.  
Drug-related AEs 
The overall incidences of drug-related AEs during the study, as determined by the Investigator, were 
similar between the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab and placebo + NAC / placebo groups (see 
Table below).

The incidences of the most frequently reported drug-related AEs (incidence ≥30%) during the study 
were generally similar between the 2 treatment groups and included nausea, alopecia, anaemia, 
neutropenia, fatigue, and diarrhoea.  
The overall incidence of drug-related AEs was higher in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab 
group compared with the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD. There was a higher incidence (≥20 
percentage point difference) of the following drug-related AEs in the pembrolizumab + NAC / 
pembrolizumab group compared with the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD: nausea, alopecia, 
anaemia, neutropenia, fatigue, ALT increased, vomiting, constipation, and neutrophil count decreased. 
These differences were consistent with the established safety profiles of the chemotherapies 
administered during the neoadjuvant phase.

 Every participant is counted a single time for each applicable row and column. 
 A specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the columns meets the incidence criterion in 
the report title, after rounding. 
 For KN522, included adverse events started from the first treatment including definitive surgery and radiation therapy and up to 30 
days of the last treatment including definitive surgery and radiation therapy for the non-serious adverse events and up to 90 days 
of the last treatment including definitive surgery and radiation therapy for the serious adverse events. For the other studies, non-
serious adverse events up to 30 days of last dose and serious adverse events up to 90 days of last dose are included. 
 MedDRA preferred terms "Neoplasm Progression", "Malignant Neoplasm Progression" and "Disease Progression" not related to 
the drug are excluded.

Febrile neutropenia was the only SAE and drug-related SAE reported with an incidence ≥5% in the 
pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group. Pyrexia was the only event considered higher (ie, the 
95% CI for the treatment difference was >0) in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group 
compared with the placebo + NAC / placebo group (3.7% vs 0.5%). Except for pyrexia, the 
frequencies of other most common SAEs (incidence ≥1%) during the study were generally similar 
between the 2 treatment groups. Over the course of the study, the frequencies of the most common 
drug-related SAEs (incidence ≥1%) were also generally consistent between the 2 treatment groups. 
The overall incidence of SAEs and drug-related SAEs observed in the pembrolizumab + NAC / 
pembrolizumab group was higher (5 percentage point difference) compared with the pembrolizumab 
monotherapy RSD. Except for blood and lymphatic system disorders SOC (19.7% vs 1.6%), the 
incidences of SAEs by SOC in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group were generally 
consistent with the pembrolizumab RSD.  
Deaths 
The overall incidence of AEs resulting in death in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group 
the and in the placebo + NAC / placebo group was 0.9% and 0.3%, respectively (see Table below).

Of the 7 deaths due to AEs in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group, 2 deaths occurred in 
the adjuvant phase (pulmonary embolism and autoimmune encephalitis) while the remaining 5 deaths 
occurred during the neoadjuvant phase. Four out of 7 deaths due to AEs were considered related to 
study medication by the investigator: pneumonitis, pulmonary embolism, and autoimmune encephalitis 
were considered related to pembrolizumab and sepsis/multiple organ dysfunction syndrome were 
considered related to NAC. No specific AE resulting in death was reported in more than 1 participant. 
The overall incidence of AEs resulting in death was 5.2% in pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD. All fatal 
AEs were reviewed and no new safety concerns for pembrolizumab were identified. 
AEs of special interest (AEOSI) 
The frequency and maximum severity of AEOSI analyses are based on a predefined list of preferred AE 
terms deemed clinically consistent with the identified risks of pembrolizumab (AEOSIs) and potentially 
associated with an immune etiology. This list was developed by the MAH and includes AEOSI terms 
identified to allow consistent assessment of AEOSIs across pembrolizumab studies. The AEOSIs are 
presented regardless of investigator-assessed causality and generally include all AE grades (with the 
exception of severe skin reactions). The list of terms is updated periodically based on emerging 
pembrolizumab safety data (see Table below).

The overall incidence of AEOSIs was higher in the pembrolizumab + NAC group / pembrolizumab 
compared with the RSD; the longer duration of exposure to study treatment in the pembrolizumab + 
NAC / pembrolizumab group should be taken into consideration. The types and severity of AEOSIs

observed in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group were generally consistent with the 
pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD. Most AEOSIs reported in the pembrolizumab + NAC / 
pembrolizumab group were mild to moderate in severity (Grade 1 or 2), nonserious, managed with 
treatment interruption and corticosteroids and/or hormone replacement therapy, and did not result in 
discontinuation of study intervention. Most Grade 3 to 4 AEOSIs were reported in <5 participants, 
except for severe skin reactions (n=37 [4.7%]), infusion reactions (n=21 [2.7%]), rash maculopapular 
(n=15 [1.9%]), rash (n=14 [1.8%]), hypophysitis (n=10 [1.3%]), hepatitis (n=9 [1.1%]), adrenal 
insufficiency (n=8 [1.0%]), colitis (n=6 [0.8%]), nephritis (n=6 [0.8%], pneumonitis (n=6 [0.8%]), 
and pancreatitis (n=5 [0.6%]). 
Most infusion reactions were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, treated with corticosteroids (60.3%), and 
considered resolved (57.2%). The median time to onset for infusion reactions was shorter in the 
pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group (16.0 days) compared with pembrolizumab 
monotherapy RSD (42.0 days); however, the median episode duration was identical to pembrolizumab 
monotherapy RSD (1.0 day for both). The use of premedication was similar between treatment groups 
(97.6% and 96.9% in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group and placebo + NAC / placebo 
group, respectively). The most commonly used premedications in the ASaT population (incidence ≥
20%) were dexamethasone (74.6%), acetaminophen (28.8%), and diphenhydramine (22.3%). 
Summaries of infusion reaction AEOSIs are provided for participants without premedication and

Overall, the incidence of infusion reactions for participants in the pembrolizumab + NAC / 
pembrolizumab group was generally similar between those who received pre-medication and those 
who did not (18.1% vs 15.8%).   
Most severe skin reactions were Grade 3 in severity, treated with systemic corticosteroids (62.2%), 
and considered resolved (84.4%). The median time to onset and the median episode duration for 
severe skin reactions were shorter in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group (64.0 and 
27.0 days, respectively) compared with pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD (106.0 and 58.0 days, 
respectively). 
Most events of hypothyroidism were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. Few events were treated with 
corticosteroids (3.4%) and most were considered not resolved (54.2%), consistent with an endocrine 
abnormality and the need for continued hormone replacement therapy. The median time to onset for 
events of hypothyroidism was 105.0 days in both the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group 
and pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD. 
Events classified as adrenal insufficiency were 2.6% in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab 
group and 0.8% in the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD. Most events were Grade 2 or 3 and there 
were no Grade 5 events. Events of adrenal insufficiency were managed with treatment interruption and 
corticosteroids. Overall, the severity, outcome, and manageability of adrenal insufficiency events were 
generally consistent with those previously reported for pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD.  
There were 2 deaths due to an AEOSI (pneumonitis [neoadjuvant phase] and autoimmune encephalitis 
[adjuvant phase]) in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group, which were considered 
related to pembrolizumab by the investigator.

Modified from Table 14.3.4.2-6 
Additional  tables  of  AE  by  category  and  maximum  toxicity  grade  were  provided  also  including  the 
following preferred terms (PTs): 
•  The  PTs  of  pericarditis,  autoimmune  pericarditis,  pericardial  effusion,  cardiac  tamponade  comprised 
the category of “Pericarditis” 
• The PTs of polyneuropathy, multifocal motor neuropathy, acute polyneuropathy, axonal neuropathy, 
acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy, peripheral motor neuropathy; mononeuropathy multiplex and 
peripheral sensory neuropathy comprised the category of “Polyneuropathies” 
• The PTs of autoimmune aplastic anaemia, aplasia pure red cell, and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia 
comprised the category of “Anaemia” 
• The PT haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 
• The PT immune thrombocytopenia 
There  was  a  higher  incidence  of  polyneuropathies  observed  in  the  pembrolizumab  +  NAC  / 
pembrolizumab  group  compared  with  the  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  EU  RSD;  however,  this  is 
consistent with the established safety profile of the chemotherapies administered (see Table below).

Laboratory findings 
Laboratory abnormalities occurred more frequently during the neoadjuvant phase compared with the 
adjuvant phase, likely due to the concomitant chemotherapy during the neoadjuvant phase. 
Of the protocol-specified laboratory tests, leukocytes decreased (40.8% vs 32.5%) and lymphocytes 
decreased (27.5% vs 22.2%) were the only CTCAE Grade 3 to 4 events reported at a higher incidence 
(≥5 percentage point difference) in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group compared with 
the placebo + NAC / placebo group. 
The incidences of Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities were generally similar between the 
pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group and the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD. The 
following Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities were reported with an incidence ≥5% and were higher 
(≥5 percentage point difference) in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group compared with 
the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD: ALT increased (9.4% vs 3.0%), haemoglobin decreased

neutrophils decreased (62.2% vs 2.1%), and platelets decreased (10.7% vs 2.0%). 
Safety in special populations 
AEs were assessed in subgroups of participants stratified by age, ECOG performance status, sex and 
region. 
Age 
The observed incidences of Grade 3 to 5 AEs, drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs, SAEs, drug-related SAEs, 
and discontinuation of study intervention due to an AE (including drug-related AEs, SAEs, serious drug-
related AEs) in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group were higher (≥5 percentage point 
difference) in the ≥65 years age category (see Table below). Due to the small sample size in the ≥65 
years age category/ies, results in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group should be 
interpreted with caution.

Results were similar for the analysis of age using additional age categories (<65 years old, 65 to 74 
years old, and 75 to 84 years old), although sample sizes in the 75 to 84 years old category was small 
(n=12).  
Except for SAEs and Grade 3 to 5 AEs, these differences (≥5 percentage point difference) between the 
<65 years of age and ≥65 years of age were not noted in the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD.  
Considering the epidemiology of TNBC, additional post-hoc analyses stratified by age classes <45 and 
≥45-<65 were provided. The safety profile of pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab was generally 
similar between the 2 age subgroups (see table below).

 a Determined by the investigator to be related to the drug. 
 b Defined as an action taken of dose reduced, drug interrupted or drug withdrawn. 
 Grades are based on NCI CTCAE version 4.0. 
 Included adverse events started from the first treatment including definitive surgery and radiation therapy and up to 30 days of the last 
treatment including definitive surgery and radiation therapy for the non-serious adverse events and up to 90 days of the last treatment 
including definitive surgery and radiation therapy for the serious adverse events. 
 MedDRA preferred terms "Neoplasm Progression", "Malignant Neoplasm Progression" and "Disease progression" not related to the drug are 
excluded. 
 Database Cutoff Date: 23MAR2021 
ECOG 
Higher incidences (≥5 percentage point differences) of Grade 3 to 5 AEs, drug-related Grade 3 to 5 
AEs, and SAEs were noted in participants with an ECOG PS of 1. Similar results were generally noted in 
the placebo + NAC / placebo group and the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD (see Table below).

In the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group, higher incidences (≥5 percentage point 
differences) of discontinuation of any study intervention due to an AE and due to a drug-related AE 
were noted in participants with a baseline ECOG PS of 0. This was not noted in the placebo + NAC / 
placebo group and the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD. 
Sex 
One male participant was enrolled in KEYNOTE-522; therefore, a meaningful evaluation of the AE 
profile of pembrolizumab + NAC by sex could not be performed. 
Considering the peculiar epidemiology of TNBC, an additional post-hoc subgroup analysis was conducted 
of females ≤60 years of age and with an ECOG PS of 0, comparing participants in the combined phases 
of KEYNOTE-522 (from both treatment groups), matched participants from the Pooled Safety Dataset 
for pembrolizumab + chemotherapy, and matched participants from the pembrolizumab monotherapy 
EU Reference Safety Dataset (RSD). 
The duration of exposure to study medication in the KEYNOTE-522 pembrolizumab + NAC/ 
pembrolizumab group was longer than in both the Pooled Safety Dataset for pembrolizumab + 
chemotherapy and the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD. 
The incidences of AEs, drug-related AEs, deaths (all and drug-related), discontinuations of a drug due to 
a SAE (all and drug-related) were generally similar between the pembrolizumab + NAC/ pembrolizumab 
group and the Pooled Safety Dataset for pembrolizumab +chemotherapy. The incidences of Grade 3 to 
5 AEs (all and drug-related), SAEs (all and drug-related), discontinuations of a drug due to an AE (all 
and drug-related) were higher (≥5 percentage points) in the pembrolizumab + NAC/ pembrolizumab 
group compared with the Pooled Safety Dataset for pembrolizumab +chemotherapy (see Table below).

These  differences  may  also  reflect  the  longer  median  duration  of  exposure  to  study  medication  in 
KEYNOTE-522 relative to the Pooled Safety Dataset for pembrolizumab + chemotherapy. Additionally, 
participants in KEYNOTE-522 received a greater number of different chemotherapeutic agents (4 agents) 
compared with the number administered in the other pooled pembrolizumab + chemotherapy studies 
(maximum of 2 agents each).  
For AEOSI, no new indication-specific, immune-related AEs causally associated with pembrolizumab were 
identified in KEYNOTE-522. The overall incidence of AEOSIs (including drug-related, Grade 3 to 5 and 
SAEs)  and  discontinuation  of  any  drug  due  to  an  AEOSI,  were  higher  (≥5  percentage  points)  in  the 
KEYNOTE-522 pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group compared with the Pooled Safety Dataset 
for pembrolizumab + chemotherapy, and the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD (see Tables below).

The higher incidence of AEOSIs in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group was primarily 
driven by infusion reactions and severe skin reactions.  
Region 
For participants enrolled in the EU, the incidences of Grade 3 to 5, Grade 3 to 5 drug-related AEs, 
drug-related SAEs, and discontinuation of any study intervention (including drug-related AEs and 
SAEs) in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group were higher (≥5 percentage point 
difference) compared with participants who were enrolled outside of the EU. There were no other 
trends identified in the incidence of AEs for each summary category in the pembrolizumab + NAC / 
pembrolizumab group for participants enrolled in the EU compared with those enrolled outside of the 
EU. Generally, no trends were identified for differences in the incidence of each AE parameter in the EU 
versus non-EU in the placebo + NAC / placebo group or the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD. 
Pregnancy and Lactation 
Four pregnancy reports occurred in KEYNOTE-522 within the protocol-specified reporting periods 
relative to last receipt of study medication. 
Three pregnancies occurred in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group: 2 pregnancies 
resulted in abortion per participant decision and 1 pregnancy resulted in live birth (twins) with no 
reported complications or congenital abnormalities of the infants. The one pregnancy in the placebo + 
NAC / placebo group resulted in spontaneous abortion at <20 weeks; this event was reported as a 
Grade 2 SAE, which resolved and the investigator considered not related to the study intervention.  
Overall, no new safety concerns were identified for the participants who became pregnancy during the 
study. Pembrolizumab should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the 
potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether pembrolizumab is secreted in human milk. Because

many drugs and IgG antibodies are secreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to 
discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, considering the importance of the drug to the mother. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
As pembrolizumab is an IgG antibody that is administered parenterally and cleared by catabolism, food 
and DDI are not anticipated to influence exposure. Drugs that affect the cytochrome P450 enzymes, 
and other metabolizing enzymes, are not expected to interfere with the metabolism of an IgG 
antibody. The IgG antibodies, in general, do not directly regulate the expression of cytochrome P450 
enzymes, other enzymes, or transporters involved in drug elimination. Therefore, no dedicated DDI 
studies have been performed.  
In vitro experiments and studies conducted in preclinical species have been shown to have limited 
value in predicting DDI potential in humans. Therefore, no preclinical PK studies were conducted to 
assess the propensity of pembrolizumab to be a victim or perpetrator of pharmacokinetic DDIs. 
Similarly, the potential of DDI between pembrolizumab and chemotherapy agents is expected to be 
low. No impact of co-administered chemotherapy on pembrolizumab PK was observed in KEYNOTE-021 
Cohort G. 
Studies evaluating pharmacodynamic drug interactions with pembrolizumab have not been conducted. 
However, as systemic corticosteroids may be used in combination with pembrolizumab to ameliorate 
potential side effects, the potential for a pharmacokinetic DDI with pembrolizumab as a victim was 
assessed as part of the population pharmacokinetic analysis. No relationship was observed between 
prolonged use of systemic corticosteroids and pembrolizumab exposure. Systemic corticosteroids, or 
other immunosuppressants, can be used during pembrolizumab treatment to treat immune-related 
adverse reactions. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs leading to treatment discontinuation 
The overall incidence of AEs resulting in discontinuation of any study intervention during the study was 
higher (≥10 percentage point difference) in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group 
(29.9%; drug-related AEs 27.7%) compared with the placebo + NAC / placebo group (15.4%; drug-
related AEs 14.1%). The higher incidence of AEs resulting in discontinuation of study intervention in 
the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group was primarily driven by events that occurred in 
<1% of participants. The most frequently reported drug-related AEs resulting in discontinuation of any 
study intervention (≥1%) in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group, which were higher 
(≥1 percentage point difference) compared with the placebo + NAC / placebo group, were ALT 
increased (2.8% vs 1.3%), AST increased (1.7% vs 0.0%), and febrile neutropenia (1.5% vs 0.5%). 
The overall incidence of AEs leading to the discontinuation of any study treatment in the 
pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD was 13.4% (drug-related AEs 7.2%). The most frequently reported 
AEs leading to the discontinuation of any study treatment (incidence ≥1%) in the pembrolizumab + 
NAC / pembrolizumab group (vs RSD) were ALT increased (3.1% vs 0.3%), neutropenia (2.0% vs 
0.0%), AST increased (1.8% vs 0.3%), febrile neutropenia (1.5% vs 0.0%), infusion-related reactions 
(1.3% vs 0.0%), and peripheral neuropathy (1.0% vs 0.0%).  
The overall incidence of AEs leading to the discontinuation of pembrolizumab was higher in the 
pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group (20.1%) compared with pembrolizumab monotherapy 
RSD (13.4%). The most frequently reported AEs leading to the discontinuation of pembrolizumab

(incidence ≥1%) in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group (vs RSD) were ALT increased 
(2.7% vs 0.3%) and AST increased (1.5% vs 0.3%).  
AEs leading to treatment interruption 
The overall incidence of AEs resulting in interruption of any study intervention during the neoadjuvant 
phase was generally similar in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group (74.5%, drug-related 
AEs 67.8%) compared with the placebo + NAC / placebo group (73.0%, drug-related AEs 66.3%).  
The overall incidence of AEs leading to the interruption of any study treatment was higher in the 
pembrolizumab + NAC group / pembrolizumab (74.5%) compared with the pembrolizumab 
monotherapy RSD (25.8%; drug-related AEs 14.6%). This was primarily driven by neutropenia (26.6% 
vs 0.1%), neutrophil count decreased (13.7% vs 0.0%), ALT increased (11.2% vs 1.3%), AST 
increased (5.7% vs 1.2%), and anemia (5.0% vs 0.8%).  
The overall incidence of AEs leading to the interruption of pembrolizumab was higher in the 
pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group (57.1%) compared with the pembrolizumab 
monotherapy RSD (25.8%). The most frequently reported AEs that led to interruption of 
pembrolizumab (incidence ≥5%) in the pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab group, which were 
higher compared with the pembrolizumab monotherapy RSD, were neutropenia (17.5% vs 0.1%), 
neutrophil count decreased (8.7% vs 0.0%), and ALT increased (6.0% vs 1.3%). The incidences of 
these AEs leading to interruption of pembrolizumab and placebo were generally similar between the 
pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab and placebo + NAC /placebo groups. 
Post marketing experience 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab was summarized in the Periodic Safety Update Report covering the 
period 04-SEP-2019 through 03-SEP-2020.  
No revocation or withdrawal of pembrolizumab registration has occurred in any country for safety 
reasons. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database supporting the claimed indication is comprised by 783 subjects with newly 
diagnosed, locally advanced, centrally confirmed TNBC who were randomised in the NAC + 
pembrolizumab followed by adjuvant pembrolizumab monotherapy arm of Phase III study KN-522. At 
the data cut-off date (Mar 2021), 778/783 subjects had received at least 1 dose of study medication.  
Safety data from the pembrolizumab arm were contextualised by direct comparison in study KN-522 
with the “placebo arm” (i.e. NAC + placebo followed by placebo in the adjuvant phase; N=389), and 
by indirect comparisons to pooled data from pembrolizumab monotherapy studies (RSD, N=6185) and 
from pembrolizumab monotherapy studies in subjects with TNBC (mTNBC N=595).  
Baseline characteristics and exposure 
In analysing safety data from study KN-522 it should be considered that, in line with the epidemiology 
of TNBC, enrolled patients were, for the vast majority, female (99.9%), young (median age 49 years) 
and in good medical state (ECOG 0 87%).  
The median duration of exposure to study drugs was similar for the “active” and “placebo” arm of 
study KN-522 (13.3 and 13.6 months, respectively), and significantly longer compared to that 
Assessment report  
EMA/257879/2022  
Page 121/138 
 
 
 
 
observed in the RSD and TNBC datasets (4.9 and 2.1 months, respectively). This is not unexpected 
considering the more advanced setting of disease in the pooled monotherapy datasets. The majority of 
patients in study KN-522 received the planned 17 cycles in both treatment arms, as per study 
protocol. 
Adverse events (AEs) 
Nearly all (~100%) patients in study KN-522 reported at least one AE during treatment, and most AEs 
were considered drug-related by the Investigator (98.9% and 99.7% in the “pembrolizumab” and 
“placebo” arms, respectively). Although most subjects in the monotherapy datasets also experienced 
at least one AEs (93.9% and 96.8% in the mTNBC and RSD datasets, respectively), the proportion of 
AEs adjudicated as drug-related was lower with monotherapy (61.8% and 70.6%, respectively), 
probably reflecting the higher toxicity of the combination therapy and the different setting of disease.  
The higher toxicity potential of combination therapy was highlighted by the provided exposure-
adjusted safety analyses, which  showed how AEs and drug-related AEs rates in study KN-522 were 
higher with combination therapy (2459 and 1608 AEs rate/100 person-year, respectively) compared to 
both chemotherapy + placebo (2107 and 1351 AE rate/100 person-year, respectively) and 
pembrolizumab monotherapy (1706 and 560 AE rate/100 person-year, respectively, in the mTNBC 
dataset and 1506 and 472 AE rate/100 person-year, respectively, in the RSD dataset).  
Exposure adjusted AEs and drug-related AEs rates in the pembrolizumab arm of study KN-522 were 
consistently higher in the neoadjuvant phase (3750 and 2687 AEs rate/100 person-year, 
respectively,) compared to the adjuvant phase (879 and 254.3 AEs rate/100 person-year, 
respectively). A similar trend could also be observed in the placebo arm, highlighting the impact of 
chemotherapy on the overall toxicity profile of the combination.  
Compared to the neo-adjuvant phase, in the adjuvant phase a reduced difference in the exposure 
adjusted AEs/drug-related AEs rates could be observed across treatment arms, which might be 
explained by the milder toxicity of pembrolizumab monotherapy. However, in the absence of re-
randomisation post-surgery, a possible selection bias cannot be definitely excluded, especially 
considering that only ~75% (588/783) of all the enrolled patients did proceed to the adjuvant phase in 
the pembrolizumab arm of study KN-522, compared to ~85% (331/389) in the placebo arm.  
The most frequently (incidence ≥20%) reported treatment-emergent AEs in the combination 
therapy arm were nausea (67%), alopecia (61%), anaemia (59%), neutropenia (48%), fatigue (47%), 
constipation (42%), diarrhoea (41%), vomiting (31%), ALT increase (30%), headache (30%), rash 
(30%), arthralgia (29%), pyrexia (28%), asthenia (28%), cough (25%), neutrophil count decreased 
(24%), AST increased (24%), decreased appetite (23%), neuropathy peripheral (21%), insomnia 
(21%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (20%) and myalgia (20%). Similar type and rates of AEs could 
be observed with placebo, suggesting that the overall safety profile of the proposed combination is 
heavily influenced by the common chemotherapy backbone. The AEs that were more frequently 
(incidence difference across arms ≥5%) reported in the pembrolizumab arm compared to placebo were 
diarrhoea, rash, pyrexia, decreased appetite, hypothyroidism and hypokalaemia, consistently with the 
known toxicity profile of pembrolizumab.  
The incidence of individual AEs was constantly higher in the combination arm compared to the 
pembrolizumab monotherapy datasets, further highlighting the higher toxicity of combination therapy. 
With respect to drug-related AEs, the emerging toxicity profile was consistent with the overall safety 
analysis: the most commonly reported (incidence ≥20%) drug-related AEs in both treatment arms 
were nausea, alopecia, anaemia, neutropenia, fatigue, diarrhoea, ALT increased, vomiting, asthenia, 
rash, constipation, neutrophil count decreased, AST increased neuropathy peripheral and decreased 
Assessment report  
EMA/257879/2022  
Page 122/138 
 
 
 
appetite. Diarrhoea and rash, known ADRs of checkpoint inhibitors, were the only drug-related AEs 
with a ≥5% incidence difference in the pembrolizumab compared to placebo arm. Diarrhoea and rash 
are already included in the AEOSI for pembrolizumab. 
Grade 3-5 AEs, SAEs and AEs who led to study drug interruption/discontinuation.  
Severe (Grade 3 to 5) AEs and drug-related AEs were slightly more frequent in the pembrolizumab 
arm of study KN-522 (82.4% and 77.1%, respectively) compared to placebo (78.7% and 73.3%, 
respectively), and significantly more common compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy (36.6% and 
13.3%, respectively, in the mTNBC dataset and 48.2% and 15.8%, respectively, in the RSD dataset). 
Consistent results were also shown by the provided exposure-adjusted analysis, with the highest 
incidence rate of severe AEs observed with combination chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant phase (i.e. 
470 severe events/100 person-years). It should also be noted, however, that in the adjuvant phase 
the exposure-adjusted incidence rate of severe AEs in subjects who received pembrolizumab was still 
approximately 2-fold higher than that observed in subjects who received placebo (i.e. 38 vs. 22 
events/100 person-years, respectively).  
The pattern of severe AEs was generally similar in both arms of study KN-522, with severe 
hematologic toxicity (neutropenia, neutrophil count decreased, white blood cell count decreased and 
anaemia) presenting the highest incidence with both pembrolizumab and placebo: this is in line with 
the known toxicity profile of the common chemotherapy backbone, as further highlighted by the 
significantly lower incidence of severe hematologic toxicity in the pembrolizumab monotherapy 
datasets. ALT increased was the only severe AE whose incidence was significantly higher in the 
experimental vs. control arm (6.4% and 2.8%, respectively). 
The higher rate of severe AEs observed with combination therapy did also result in a consistently 
higher rate of SAEs and drug-related SAEs (43.6% and 34.1%, respectively) observed in the 
pembrolizumab arm of study KN-522 compared to placebo (28.5% and 20.1%, respectively) and to 
the monotherapy reference datasets (23.5% and 7.7%, respectively, in the mTNBC dataset and 38.4% 
and 11.4%, respectively, in the RSD dataset). Similar results were observed in the exposure-
adjusted analysis, with the highest incidence rate of SAEs observed with combination therapy in the 
neoadjuvant arm (i.e. 121 events/100 person-years). The SAEs rate was approximately two-fold 
higher with pembrolizumab vs. placebo in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant phases of study KN-522.  
No clear pattern could be identified to explain the increased rate of SAEs observed with pembrolizumab 
in the combination arm and febrile neutropenia, the only SAE with an incidence ≥5% in both treatment 
arms (15.1% and 12.1% in the pembrolizumab and placebo arm, respectively), can be mainly 
attributed to the common chemotherapy backbone. Pyrexia was the only SAE that was significantly 
more common with pembrolizumab compared to placebo (3.7% vs. 0.5%). 
Consistently, the rate of AEs that resulted in the discontinuation of any study drug 
intervention in study KN-522 was highest in the pembrolizumab arm (any drug discontinuation rate 
29.9%, pembrolizumab discontinuation rate 20.1%) compared to the placebo arm (any drug 
discontinuation rate 15.4%, placebo discontinuation rate 8%) and to the RSD dataset (13.4%). 
Consistently with what observed in terms of SAEs, results from the exposure-adjusted analysis showed 
that the highest incidence rate of AEs that resulted in study drug discontinuation was observed with 
combination therapy in the neoadjuvant phase (e.g. 55 events/100 person-years). Of note, the rate of 
AEs leading to drug discontinuation was constantly at least two-fold higher in the pembrolizumab arm 
compared to placebo across all treatment phases.  
No clear pattern of AEs driving the higher discontinuation rates in patients receiving the combination 
regimen could be identified, with most AEs occurring in <1% of subjects. Although a trend towards a 
higher incidence of increased ALT/AST and febrile neutropenia leading to drug discontinuation was 
Assessment report  
EMA/257879/2022  
Page 123/138 
 
 
 
observed in the pembrolizumab arm compared to placebo, limited numbers (frequencies did not 
exceed 3%) hampered definitive conclusions. 
Deaths 
Less than 1% of subjects in study KN-522 experienced AEs resulting in death, which is significantly 
lower than the incidence of grade 5 AEs observed in the RSD dataset (i.e. 5.2%), possibly reflecting 
the younger age, earlier disease setting and better baseline health status of patients in the pivotal 
study. Seven out of 783 subjects in the experimental arm (0.9%) experienced fatal AEs compared to 
1/389 (0.3%) in the control arm. The majority of the fatal AEs (6/8, 5/7 in the pembrolizumab arm 
and 1/1 in the control arm) were observed in the neoadjuvant phase; only 2 deaths due to AEs were 
observed with pembrolizumab in the adjuvant phase vs. 0 in the control arm. Even though absolute 
values were low, the exposure-adjusted incidence rate of AEs leading to death was nearly 5-fold higher 
compared to that observed in the control arm (1.09 and 0.23 events/100 person-years, respectively), 
with the highest exposure-adjusted incidence observed in the neoadjuvant phase with combination 
therapy (1.51 events/100 person-years).  
AEs leading to death in the pembrolizumab arm were: death not otherwise specified, autoimmune 
encephalitis, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, pneumonitis, 
pulmonary embolism, sepsis and shock not otherwise specified. The only grade 5 AE reported in the 
control arm was septic shock. The fatal AEs pneumonitis, pulmonary embolism and autoimmune 
encephalitis were considered related to pembrolizumab by the Investigator, while sepsis/multi organ 
failure syndrome was attributed to chemotherapy. For 2 of the 3 subjects in the pembrolizumab arm 
who experienced Grade 5 AEs not considered related to study medications by the Investigator, known 
anti-PD1 AEOSI (adrenal insufficiency and grade 4 hepatitis with a cholestatic pattern) were ongoing at 
the time of death. Although it can be recognised that evaluations of causal relationship with 
pembrolizumab are confounded by concomitant factors, from a conservative perspective it cannot be 
excluded. 
Overall, despite a higher incidence of AEs resulting in death could be observed in the monotherapy 
RSD dataset (which might be, at least in part, explained by the more advanced setting of disease), the 
exposure-adjusted incidence of fatal events observed with combination therapy, in particular when   
compared to chemotherapy alone, is not considered negligible in a potentially curative setting.  
AEs of special interests (AEOSI) 
The assessment of the AEOSI is based on the predefined list of preferred terms (version 19.0) 
identified by the MAH as potentially associated with an immune aetiology. Although that was agreed to 
maintain consistency across studies in the pembrolizumab clinical development programme, the 
knowledge of immune-related AEs with checkpoint inhibitors is continuously evolving (see e.g. Ramon-
Casals et al, Nature Reviews 2020). An additional analysis also including pericarditis, aplastic 
anaemia/pure red cell aplasia, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, haemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura and polyneuropathies to the predefined list of 
preferred terms for AEOSI was performed by the MAH. No significant differences in the incidence and 
severity of these additional “potential” AEOSI were observed across treatment arms. Although the 
incidence of polyneuropathy AEs was higher in the “pembrolizumab” arm of study KN522 compared to 
the RSD, a similar rate could be observed in the “placebo” arm of study KN522, suggesting that such 
toxicity should be mainly ascribed to chemotherapy. 
Compared to placebo, an increased incidence of AEOSI (43.6% vs. 21.9%), drug-related AEOSI 
(40.2% vs. 19%), severe (Grade 3-5) AEOSI (14.9% vs. 2.1%), serious AEOSI (10.6% vs. 1.3%) and 
AEOSI that resulted in discontinuation of study drug (10.9% vs. 2.6%) could be observed with 
combination therapy in study KN-522. AEOSI were also more frequent and severe/serious with 
Assessment report  
EMA/257879/2022  
Page 124/138 
 
 
 
combination therapy compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy, as highlighted by the lower rates of 
AEOSI, drug-related AEOSI, Grade 3-5 AEOSI, serious AEOSI and AEOSI that resulted in 
discontinuation of pembrolizumab in the mTNBC and RSD datasets.  
Only 2 deaths due to AEOSI (0.3%) could be observed with pembrolizumab in study KN-522, 
compared to none in the control arm and ≤0.2% in the monotherapy datasets. Uncertainties are 
present, however, on the causality of two additional fatal events (see also the “Deaths” section above).  
The exposure-adjusted incidence of all the AEOSI was higher in the NAC + pembrolizumab phase (all 
AEOSI 109 events/100 person-years) compared to the adjuvant phase (19.7 events/100 person-
years). A similar difference could also be observed in terms of severe AEOSI (25.9 vs. 5 events/100 
person-years), serious AEOSI (17.2 vs. 3.5 events/100 person-years), and AEOSI leading to drug 
discontinuation (17.5 vs. 2.4 events/100 person-years), confirming that the greater toxicity of 
combination therapy did extend to immune-related AEs. 
The most common (i.e. incidence ≥5%) AEOSI observed in the pembrolizumab arm of study KN-522 
were infusion reactions, hypothyroidism, severe skin reactions and hyperthyroidism, which is in line 
with the known safety profile of pembrolizumab. In particular, infusion reactions were common 
(18% in the combination arm), mainly occurred in the first month of treatment (median time to onset 
16 days) and required systemic corticosteroids in most cases (60%). The vast majority of subjects in 
study KN522 received premedication before pembrolizumab/placebo was infused. Premedication 
consisted of dexamethasone (74.6%), acetaminophen (28.8%), and diphenhydramine (22.3%). Such 
frequent use of corticosteroids can be considered justified in the context of a standard anti-emetic 
premedication for highly emetogenic regimens, and apparently no detrimental impact on efficacy 
endpoints could be identified. Reduced numbers in the subgroup of patients who did not receive 
premedication (N=19) could not allow for reliable evaluations of the effectiveness of premedication in 
the management of IRs. No firm conclusions could also be drawn on the impact of different 
premedication regimens on the incidence of IRs. 
Skin reactions were also commonly observed in the pembrolizumab arm (~6%), mainly occurred in 
the initial months of treatment (median time to onset 64 days), were often severe (Grade 3) and 
required corticosteroids (62%).  
Hypothyroidism AEOSI were common (~15% in the combination arm), could occur anytime during 
treatment (median time to onset 105 days) and were usually mild in severity (grade 1-2). 
Management of hypothyroidism usually required chronic replacement therapy and only rarely 
corticosteroids (3.4%) and most events (54%) were not considered resolved at the last data cut-off 
date.  
It is noted that all myocarditis (n=5, 0.6%) reported as AEOSI were identified in patients receiving 
pembrolizumab in study KN-522. Although incidence was low, it was still higher with combination 
therapy compared to monotherapy (i.e. 0.2% in the mTNBC and 0.1% in the RSD datasets). 
Considering the potentially fatal nature of cardiac toxicity with immune checkpoint inhibitors and the 
exposure of patients with locally advanced TNBC to anthracyclines in the neoadjuvant phase, a 
possible relationship between exposure to anthracyclines and onset of immune-related cardiac toxicity 
was investigated. The number of subjects who did not receive anthracyclines in study KN522 was, 
however, too limited (<10%) for meaningful comparisons.  
The incidence of AEOSI with combination NAC was also constantly higher compared to monotherapy 
(RSD), with the notable exceptions of colitis (1.7% vs. 2%), Guillain-Barre Syndrome (0 vs. 0.1%), 
and pneumonitis (2.2.% vs. 4.6%). Conversely, the incidence of severe skin reactions (5.7% vs. 
1.6%), infusion reactions (18% vs. 2.4%) and hypothyroidism (15.1% vs. 11.3%) was increased with 
combination therapy, which might be at least partially imputed to NAC, the epidemiology of TNBC and 
Assessment report

longer exposure in study KN-522. The evaluation of any eventual relationship between possible 
predisposing conditions, patient characteristics and concomitant medications at baseline and the risk of 
onset of all and specific AEOSI was, however, hampered by limited numbers in most subgroups.  
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory abnormalities occurred more frequently during the neoadjuvant phase, due to the known 
toxicity of the chemotherapy backbone. Leukocytes decreased and lymphocyte decreased were the 
only findings that occurred with a higher incidence (i.e. difference ≥5%) with pembrolizumab 
compared to placebo (40.8% vs. 32.5%, respectively, and 27.5% vs. 22.2%, respectively). 
A trend towards higher rates of severe elevated transaminases could be observed with 
pembrolizumab vs. placebo in study KN-522 (Grade 3-4 ALT increased 9.4% vs. 4.6% and Grade 3-4 
AST increased 6.1% vs. 1.8%, respectively).  
Severe laboratory abnormalities that were more common (i.e. difference ≥5%) in the pembrolizumab 
arm compared to monotherapy (RSD) were, haemoglobin decreased (21.9% vs. 6.4%), leukocytes 
decreased (40.8% vs. 0.8%), lymphocytes decreased (27.5% vs. 11%), neutrophils decreased (62.2% 
vs. 2.1%), platelet decreased (10.7% vs. 2%) and ALT increased (9.4% vs. 3%), mainly reflecting the 
increased haematologic toxicity of chemotherapy. 
Safety in special populations 
Safety analyses by age showed that, compared to younger patients, subjects aged ≥65 years 
experienced higher rates of severe (Grade 3-5) AEs (81.8% vs. 86.9%, respectively), SAEs (42.3% vs. 
53.6%), AEs leading to study drug discontinuation (28.2% vs. 44%) and fatal AEs (0.3% vs. 2.4%). 
Additional analyses in subjects aged ≥75 years were limited by small numbers (n=12). Considering the 
peculiar epidemiology of TNBC, additional safety analyses stratified by age classes <45 and ≥45-<65 
were provided, and no significant differences in the incidence and severity of AEs could be observed 
between subjects aged <45 and ≥45 and <65.  
Subgroup analyses by ECOG PS score (0 vs. 1) showed that frailer subjects who received 
pembrolizumab were slightly more likely to experience Grade 3-5 AEs (90.6% vs. 81.1%, 
respectively), SAEs (48.1% vs. 42.8%), and deaths (2.8% vs. 0.6%). Results are, however, difficult to 
interpret, based on limited numbers in the ECOG 1 subset (N= 106) and inconsistencies (AEs leading 
to study drug discontinuation were more common in the ECOG 0 subgroup). 
Due to the extremely limited number of male subjects in study KN-522 (N=1), no subgroup analysis 
stratified by sex could be provided. The safety profile of pembrolizumab in male subjects with not pre-
treated, local-advanced TNBC is not currently assessable. Considering the epidemiology of TNBC, 
however, to better contextualise the data observed in study KN522 the MAH has provided additional 
safety analyses in the subgroup defined by female sex, age ≤60 years and baseline ECOG PS score 0, 
across relevant pembrolizumab datasets (i.e. subjects who received pembrolizumab + NAC / 
pembrolizumab in study KN522 [n=569], subjects who received placebo + NAC / placebo in study 
KN522 [n=277], subjects who received pembrolizumab + chemotherapy regimens in the overall 
clinical development programme [mPCD, n=344]) or in the pembrolizumab monotherapy safety 
dataset [mRSD n=597]). When compared to “matched” controls, younger and fitter women who 
received pembrolizumab in study KN522 were still at higher risk of experiencing Grade 3-5 AEs 
(80.4%, 78%, 73% and 36.2% in the pembrolizumab and placebo arms of study KN522, mPCD and 
mRSD, respectively), SAEs (42.5%, 28.2%, 28.8% and 27.6%, respectively) and AEs who resulted in 
any drug discontinuation (28.4%, 14.8%, 20.6%, 13.1%, respectively), confirming the non-negligible 
toxicity of the proposed combination regimen. No similar trend could be observed for Grade 5 AEs 
Assessment report  
EMA/257879/2022  
Page 126/138 
 
 
 
(0.5%, 0.4%, 2%, 2.3%), yet limited numbers and different disease settings hampered definitive 
conclusions. 
Compared to direct and indirect controls, younger and fitter women who received pembrolizumab in 
study KN522 were also more likely to experience AEOSI (44.1%, 23.8%, 29.7% and 30.2% in the 
pembrolizumab and placebo arms of study KN522, mPCD and mRSD, respectively), Grade 3-5 AEOSI 
(15.4%, 2.9%, 7%, 4.5%, respectively), serious AEOSI (10.5%, 1.4%, 5.8%, 6.2%, respectively) and 
AEOSI resulting in any study drug discontinuation (10.5%, 2.9%, 5.8%, 4.9%, respectively). 
Consistently with what observed in the overall population, no clear pattern driving the observed higher 
rates of AEOSI could be identified also in the “younger and fitter” subset. 
Subgroup analyses by region showed that EU patients (N=325) were more likely to experience grade 
3-5 AES, SAEs, fatal AEs and AEs leading to drug discontinuation. The reasons behind such differences 
are currently unknown and should be further discussed. The contribution of differences in baseline 
characteristics to the safety profile observed in the EU and ex-EU subgroups was reduced. However, 
unique patterns in immune-related AEs have been reported in some studies across ethnicities 
(Peravali, 2021), and the ethnical composition of the EU and ex-EU subgroups was not homogeneous. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of the proposed pembrolizumab + NAC / pembrolizumab regimen for the treatment 
of adult subjects with locally advanced, inflammatory, or early-stage triple-negative breast cancer at 
high-risk of recurrence has been characterised based on the results from Phase III study KN-522. 
Although, based on the available data, no new safety concern has been identified, subjects receiving 
pembrolizumab showed higher rates of severe (Grade 3-5) AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to study drug 
discontinuation and fatal AEs compared to placebo. This was especially evident in the neoadjuvant 
setting, further highlighting the increased toxicity of the combination therapy. Immune-related AEs 
(AEOSI) were also consistently higher with pembrolizumab, reaching the highest incident rates in the 
neoadjuvant phase.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
KEYTRUDA, in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then continued as 
monotherapy as adjuvant treatment after surgery, is indicated for the treatment of adults with locally 
advanced, or early stage triple negative breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the most common cause of cancer 
deaths among women (Sung H, 2020). Approximately 15-20% of breast cancer are triple negative 
(TNBC), an heterogeneous disease characterized by negativity for ER, PgR and HER-2 (Howard, 2021). 
TNBC is associated with higher tumor grade at diagnosis, a higher risk of distant disease recurrence, 
with most of the relapse occurring within the first 3 years after surgery (Dent, 2007; Lin, 2012). 
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is the preferred choice for stage II and III disease. The standard 
treatments are antracycline-based regimen (adriamicin or epirubicin + cyclophosphamide, AC/EC) with 
the sequential use of taxane, for 12-24 weeks. The inclusion of carboplatin might be an option in the 
neoadjuvant therapy for TNBC. Adjuvant capecitabine is an option in TNBC for patients with residual 
disease after NACT (Cardoso, 2019; Burstein, 2021; NCCN, 2021). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study for this submission is KEYNOTE-522, a phase 3, randomized, double blind study of 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (AC or EC followed by carboplatin/paclitaxel) vs placebo plus 
chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, followed by pembrolizumab vs placebo as adjuvant 
treatment. The results of the final analysis for pCR (IA2) and an interim analysis for EFS (IA4) have 
been submitted. Median follow-up at IA4 is approximately 37 months. Last patient was randomized 
approximately 2.5 years before the data cut-off. All patients have discontinued/terminated treatment. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
•  Statistical significance reached for pCR at the interim analysis (IA1), confirmed at final analysis 
(pCR rate 64% vs 54.7%, Δ 9.2% (95%CI 2.8, 15.6), p=0.00221). Same direction of benefit of 
EFS.  
•  Statistically significant EFS advantage for pembrolizumab at interim analysis (IA4): EFS HR of 0.63 
(95% CI: 0.48, 0.82), with a one-sided p-value of 0.0003093, EFS rate at 24 months was 87.8% 
(85.3, 89.9) vs 81% (76.8, 84.6). The benefit seems relevant. Analysis has been performed when 
all patients have already completed/discontinued treatment and followed at least one year out of 
treatment. Median follow-up is 37 months with most of the recurrence occurring within 3 years.  
• 
Positive OS trend at early analysis. OS HR was 0.72 (95%CI 0.51, 1.02), not reaching statistical 
significance.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
•  KEYNOTE-522 design does not allow to disentangle the contribution of pembrolizumab to each 
treatment phase. Whether neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant pembrolizumab are both needed is 
unknown based on this study. Data may only be discussed in the context of an indication for 
pembrolizumab as neoadjuvant AND adjuvant treatment.  
• 
The assessment is based on interim analysis. Final results are expected post-approval. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
• 
Nearly all patients in study KN-522 reported at least one treatment-emergent AE, and most 
AEs were considered drug-related by the Investigator (98.9% and 99.7% in the “pembrolizumab” and 
“placebo” arms, respectively). AEs and drug-related AEs rates in the provided exposure-adjusted 
safety analyses from study KN-522 were higher with combination therapy (2459 and 1608 AEs 
rate/100 person-year, respectively) compared to both chemotherapy + placebo (2107 and 1351 AE 
rate/100 person-year, respectively) and pembrolizumab monotherapy (1706 and 560 AE rate/100 
person-year, respectively, in the mTNBC dataset and 1506 and 472 AE rate/100 person-year, 
respectively, in the RSD dataset). Exposure adjusted AEs and drug-related AEs rates in the 
pembrolizumab arm were consistently higher in the neoadjuvant phase (3750 and 2687 AEs rate/100 
person-year, respectively,) compared to the adjuvant phase (879 and 254.3 AEs rate/100 person-year, 
respectively). 
• 
The most frequently (incidence ≥20%) reported treatment-emergent AEs in the combination 
therapy arm were nausea (67%), alopecia (61%), anaemia (59%), neutropenia (48%), fatigue (47%), 
constipation (42%), diarrhoea (41%), vomiting (31%), ALT increase (30%), headache (30%), rash 
(30%), arthralgia (29%), pyrexia (28%), asthenia (28%), cough (25%), neutrophil count decreased 
(24%), AST increased (24%), decreased appetite (23%), neuropathy peripheral (21%), insomnia 
(21%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (20%) and myalgia (20%). Similar type and rates of AEs could 
be observed with placebo, suggesting that the overall safety profile of the proposed combination is 
heavily influenced by the common chemotherapy backbone. The overall pattern of drug-related AEs 
was consistent with the overall safety analysis. 
The AEs that were more frequently (incidence difference across arms ≥5%) reported in the 
pembrolizumab arm compared to placebo were diarrhoea, rash, pyrexia, decreased appetite, 
hypothyroidism and hypokalaemia, consistently with the known toxicity profile of pembrolizumab. 
The incidence of individual AEs was constantly higher in the combination arm compared to the 
pembrolizumab monotherapy datasets, further highlighting the higher toxicity of combination therapy. 
• 
Severe (Grade 3 to 5) AEs and drug-related AEs were slightly more frequent with the 
pembrolizumab + NAC /pembrolizumab regimen (82.4% and 77.1%, respectively) compared to 
placebo (78.7% and 73.3%, respectively), and significantly more common compared to 
pembrolizumab monotherapy (36.6% and 13.3% in the mTNBC dataset, respectively, and 48.2% and 
15.8% in the RSD dataset, respectively). Although the highest exposure-adjusted severe AEs incidence 
rate was observed with combination chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant phase (i.e. 470 events/100 
person-years), even in the adjuvant phase the incidence rate of severe AEs was still approximately 2 
fold higher with pembrolizumab compared to placebo (i.e. 38 vs. 22 events/100 person-years, 
respectively). The pattern of severe AEs was generally similar in both arms of study KN-522, with 
severe hematologic toxicity presenting the highest incidence with both pembrolizumab and placebo, in 
line with the known toxicity profile of the common chemotherapy backbone. ALT increased was the 
Assessment report  
EMA/257879/2022  
Page 131/138 
 
 
 
only severe AE whose incidence was significantly higher in the experimental vs. control arm (6.4% and 
2.8%, respectively). 
• 
SAEs and drug-related SAEs were more common with the pembrolizumab + NAC / 
pembrolizumab regimen (43.6% and 34.1%, respectively) compared to placebo (28.5% and 20.1%, 
respectively) and to the monotherapy reference datasets (23.5% and 7.7%, respectively, in the 
mTNBC dataset and 38.4% and 11.4%, respectively, in the RSD dataset). In the exposure-adjusted 
analysis, the highest incidence rate of SAEs was observed with combination therapy in the neoadjuvant 
phase (e.g. 121 events/100 person-years), and the SAE incidence rate was approximately two-fold 
higher with pembrolizumab in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant phases. No clear pattern could be 
identified to explain the increased rate of SAEs observed with pembrolizumab with combination 
therapy, pyrexia being the only SAE significantly more common with pembrolizumab compared to 
placebo (3.7% vs. 0.5%). 
• 
AEs that resulted in the discontinuation of any study drug intervention were also more 
frequently observed in the pembrolizumab + NAC /pembrolizumab arm (any drug discontinuation rate 
29.9%, pembrolizumab discontinuation rate 20.1%) compared to placebo (any drug discontinuation 
rate 15.4%, placebo discontinuation rate 8%) and to the RSD dataset (pembrolizumab discontinuation 
rate 13.4%). The exposure-adjusted analysis showed that, although the highest incidence rate of AEs 
leading to study drug discontinuation was observed with combination therapy in the neoadjuvant 
phase (e.g. 55 events/100 person-years), it remains at least two-fold higher in the pembrolizumab 
arm compared to placebo across all treatment phases. No clear pattern of AEs driving the higher 
discontinuation rates in patients receiving the combination regimen could be identified, with most AEs 
occurring in <1% of subjects. 
• 
Deaths due to AEs were observed in less than 1% of subjects in study KN-522. Seven out of 
783 subjects in the experimental arm (0.9%) experienced fatal AEs compared to 1/389 (0.3%) in the 
control arm. The majority of the fatal AEs (6/8, 5/7 in the pembrolizumab arm and 1/1 in the control 
arm) were observed in the neoadjuvant phase. The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of AEs leading to 
death was nearly 4-fold higher compared to that observed in the control arm (1.09 and 0.23 
events/100 person-years, respectively), with the highest exposure-adjusted incidence observed in the 
neoadjuvant phase with combination therapy (1.51 events/100 person-years).  
• 
An increased incidence of AEOSI (43.6% vs. 21.9%), drug-related AEOSI (40.2% vs. 19%), 
severe (Grade 3-5) AEOSI (14.9% vs. 2.1%), serious AEOSI (10.6% vs. 1.3%) and AEOSI resulting in 
study drug discontinuation (10.9% vs. 2.6%) could be observed with combination therapy compared 
to placebo. AEOSI were also more frequent and severe/serious with combination therapy compared to 
pembrolizumab monotherapy. The exposure-adjusted incidence of all the AEOSI was higher in the NAC 
+ pembrolizumab phase (all AEOSI 109 events/100 person-years) compared to the adjuvant phase 
(19.7 events/100 person-years). A similar difference could also be observed in terms of severe AEOSI 
(25.9 vs. 5 events/100 person-years), serious AEOSI (17.2 vs. 3.5 events/100 person-years), and 
AEOSI leading to drug discontinuation (17.5 vs. 2.4 events/100 person-years). The most common (i.e. 
incidence ≥5%) AEOSI in the pembrolizumab arm of study KN-522 were infusion reactions, 
hypothyroidism, severe skin reactions and hyperthyroidism. Infusion and skin reactions usually 
requiring corticosteroid therapy. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
• 
In line with the epidemiology of TNBC, enrolled patients were, for the vast majority, female 
(99.9%), young (median age 49 years) and in good medical state (ECOG 0 87%). Potential 
relationship between predisposing conditions, patient characteristics and concomitant medications at

Page 132/138 
 
 
 
baseline and the onset of all/specific AEOSI could not be characterized due to limited sample size in 
subgroups. 
• 
Compared to the neo-adjuvant phase, in the adjuvant phase a reduced difference in the 
exposure adjusted AEs/drug-related AEs rates could be observed across treatment arms, which might 
be explained by the milder toxicity of pembrolizumab monotherapy. However, in the absence of re-
randomisation post-surgery, the possibility of selection bias cannot be excluded, especially considering 
that only ~75% (588/783) of all the enrolled patients did proceed to the adjuvant phase in the 
pembrolizumab arm of study KN-522, compared to ~85% (331/389) in the placebo arm.  
• 
Only Grade 5 pneumonitis, pulmonary embolism and autoimmune encephalitis were considered 
related to pembrolizumab by the Investigator. Uncertainties remain, however, on the causality of other 
fatal AEs observed in the pembrolizumab arm of study KN-522, since deaths occurred in the context of 
toxicities whose immune-related nature could not be excluded based on the currently available data.  
• 
All myocarditis AEs (n=5, 0.6%) were reported as AEOSI in patients receiving pembrolizumab 
in study KN-522. Although the incidence was low, it was still higher than that observed in the 
monotherapy datasets (i.e. 0.2% in the mTNBC and 0.1% RSD). Considering the potentially fatal 
nature of cardiac toxicity with immune checkpoint inhibitors and the exposure of patients with locally 
advanced TNBC to cardiotoxic anthracyclines in the neoadjuvant phase, a possible relationship 
between anthracyclines exposure and the onset of immune-related cardiac toxicity was investigated. 
The number of subjects who did not receive anthracyclines in study KN522 was, however, too limited 
(<10%) for meaningful comparison. 
• 
Compared to younger patients, subjects aged ≥65 years experienced higher rates of severe 
(Grade 3-5) AEs (81.8% vs. 86.9%, respectively), SAEs (42.3% vs. 53.6%), AEs leading to study drug 
discontinuation (28.2% vs. 44%) and fatal AEs (0.3% vs. 2.4%). Safety analyses in subjects aged ≥75 
years were, however, limited by small numbers (n=12).  
• 
Frailer subjects who received pembrolizumab were slightly more likely to experience Grade 3-5 
AEs (90.6%), SAEs (48.1%) and deaths (2.8%). Results are, however, difficult to interpret, because of 
the limited numbers in the ECOG 1 subset (N= 106) and inconsistencies across subgroups (AEs leading 
to study drug discontinuation were more common in the ECOG 0 subgroup). No safety data are 
available for subjects with baseline ECOG PS ≥2. 
• 
Due to the extremely limited number of male subjects in study KN-522 (N=1), no subgroup 
analysis stratified by sex could be provided. The safety profile of pembrolizumab in male subjects with 
locally advanced TNBC is not currently assessable.  
• 
Subgroup analyses by region showed that EU patients (N=325) were more likely to experience 
grade 3-5 AES, SAEs, fatal AEs and AEs leading to drug discontinuation. The reasons behind such 
differences are currently unknown, although the impact of ethnical differences could not be excluded.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
KEYNOTE-522 study showed statistically significant and relevant advantage in EFS at interim analysis 
for pembrolizumab+NACT followed by pembrolizumab vs placebo+NACT followed by placebo as 
neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of early stage TNBC. pCR was also statistically significant at final 
analysis; although the clinical relevance of the delta pCR is questioned, pCR points towards the same 
direction of the EFS advantage. OS was immature, but with HR point estimate <1. Along with 
sensitivity analyses, the overall data are considered supportive of the main EFS benefit.  
Subjects receiving pembrolizumab showed higher rates of severe (Grade 3-5) AEs, SAEs, AEs leading 
to study drug discontinuation and fatal AEs compared to placebo, which was especially evident in the 
neoadjuvant setting, highlighting the increased toxicity of the combination therapy. A higher number of 
deaths was observed in the experimental vs control arm (6 vs 1 in the first 6 months from 
randomization, i.e. neoadjuvant treatment period; 16 vs 4 in the time interval 6-12 months from 
randomization), for progression (14 vs 4) or for AEs (7 vs 1), which is of note in the context of a 
curative setting, possibly related to a mix of higher toxicity of the combination of pembrolizumab with 
chemotherapy, worse baseline characteristics in one site and partly due to chance due to small 
numbers.  
Subgroup analysis did not show clear any clear evidence for lack of efficacy in one or more subgroups, 
that could support any considerations for restricting the indication.      
As the study design does not allow to disentangle the benefit of pembrolizumab added in the 
neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, so whether both parts are needed, the treatment package should be 
considered in its entirety.  
Acknowledging that the main benefit has been seen in an EFS interim analysis, based on the overall 
data provided, on the timing of such analysis with all patients off treatment as well as on the natural 
history of TNBC, it is considered unlikely that an additional EFS interim analysis might change the 
overall picture. Final results of KEYNOTE-522 are however awaited post-approval. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The overall benefits of the proposed treatment shown in KEYNOTE-522 is considered to outweigh its 
risks. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Inclusion in KEYNOTE-522 clinical study was allowed for patients whose TNBC had tumour size >1 cm 
but ≤2 cm in diameter with nodal involvement or tumour size > 2 cm in diameter regardless of nodal 
involvement, corresponding to stage IIB-IIIA/B (AJCC 7th ed). According to guidelines, neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy is the preferred choice for stage II and III TNBC (Burstein, 2021; Cardoso, 2019). The 
study excluded stage I (and stage IIA); for stage I adjuvant therapy is preferred according to 
guidelines (Burstein, 2021). The population seems overall reflected in the proposed wording of the 
indication “locally advanced or early-stage TNBC at high-risk of recurrence”, with the exact tumour size 
Assessment report  
EMA/257879/2022  
Page 135/138 
 
 
 
(in cm) and nodal status reported in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Therefore, a reference to section 5.1 has 
been included in the wording of indication in 4.1 in order to refer to the description of the population at 
high risk of recurrence. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Keytruda is positive. 
4.  Recommendations

Extension of indication for Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and 
then continued as monotherapy as adjuvant treatment after surgery of adults with locally advanced, or 
early-stage triple-negative breast cancer at high-risk of recurrence; as a consequence, sections 4.1,

of the RMP has also been submitted. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
5.  EPAR changes

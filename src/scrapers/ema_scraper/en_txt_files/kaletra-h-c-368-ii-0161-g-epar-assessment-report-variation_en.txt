2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
LPV/r demonstrated to be a safe and effective ARV agent while providing a high barrier to HIV resistance 
development. Determining the optimal timing for initiation of highly active ARV therapy (HAART) in 
children infected with HIV remains a challenge. For HIV-infected children, early initiation of HAART is 
needed, given its strong survival benefit, improved neurodevelopmental outcomes, and faster growth 
recovery. HAART initiation at younger ages is associated with better immunologic recovery. 
Yin et al demonstrated that starting ARV treatment (ART) at higher CD4+ T lymphocyte (CD4+) 
percentage and younger ages maximizes the potential for immunologic recovery. PENTA guidelines 
recommend initiation of an ARV regimen as soon as HIV-1 status is diagnosed or as early as 14 days of 
life. 
Kaletra (LPV/r) is a HIV protease inhibitor (PI) currently indicated in the EU in combination with other 
ARV for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults, adolescents and children ≥ 2 years old. Kaletra is 
available in EU as oral solution and film-coated tablets.  
The current recommended doses of Kaletra in EU are as follows: 
- Oral solution (children ≥ 2 years old):  
•  230/57.5 mg/m2 twice daily (BID) with food (maximum 400/100 mg BID; the dose should be 
increased to 300/75 mg/m2 when co-administered with nevirapine or efavirenz), OR  
•  10/2.5 mg/kg BID with food for children weighing 15 to 40 kg (maximum 400/100 mg BID; 
without coadministration with nevirapine or efavirenz). 
- Tablets:  
•  Adults and adolescents 400/100 mg BID with food Children≥ 2 years old (able to swallow 
tablets):  
o  Weighing ≥ 40 kg or BSA ≥ 1.4 m²: 400/100 mg BID with or without food 
o  Weighing 15 to < 40 kg:

European  and  WHO  guidelines  (PENTA  2016  WHO  2016)  support  the  use  of  LPV/r  in  all 
patients < 1 year of age. 
On 23 July 2012, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) provided a decision (P/0144/2012) to accept the 
modifications of the agreed pediatric investigation plan (PIP) for LPV/r (Kaletra) (EMEA-00100S-PIP01-
10-M01). The accepted modifications included clarifications to the PK, efficacy, and safety endpoints, 
eligibility criteria, and study duration for the P1030, P1060, and Children with HIV Early Antiretroviral 
Therapy (CHER) studies that included data in the population ≤ 36 months of age. The data presented in 
this clinical overview reflect the modifications accepted in Decision P/0144/2012, as well as additional 
post-marketing safety data. 
This application for a Type II variation for Kaletra (80 mg + 20 mg)/mL oral solution is being submitted in 
support the extension of the dosing of paediatric patients to those who are 2 weeks of age and older. The 
MAH’s claim for the EU pediatric extension of indication is “Kaletra is indicated in combination with other 
antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infected 
adults, adolescents and children aged 14 days and older”. The proposed paediatric posology of Kaletra is

similar to the US posology, excepted for the lack of weight-based dosage for children from 14 days to 6 
months of age in the proposed EU SmPC. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
Dosing Commodities – 2 mL Oral Dosing Syringe 
The  2  mL  polyethylene/polystyrene  oral  dosing  syringe  was  selected  for  dosing  Kaletra  Oral  Solution 
doses less than 2.0 mL. The oral dosing syringe is graduated with 0.1 mL markings from 0.2 mL to 2.0 
mL, with volume labeled every 0.2 mL. The syringe has CE marking (Notified Body number 0373) and the 
materials are in compliance with REACH (EC 1907/2006). 
In  order  to  ensure  dosing  accuracy,  the  accuracy  of  the  dosing  syringe  was  evaluated  according  to  Ph. 
Eur. 2.9.27 – Uniformity of mass of delivered doses from multi-dose containers. The dosing accuracy test 
was performed for target dosage volumes of 0.5 mL and 2.0 mL (selected target dosage volumes covered 
the  low  end  and  the  high  end  of  dosing).  Twenty  replicates  were  performed  for  each  target  dosage 
volume. The requirements are that not more than two individual masses deviate from the average mass 
by more than 10% and none of the individual masses deviate from the average mass by more than 20%. 
Results are summarized in Table 6. No individuals were outside ± 10% from the average. No individuals 
were outside ± 20% from the average. 
Table 6.  Testing Result Summary from the Uniformity of Mass of Delivered Doses from the Syringe 
Compatibility of Kaletra Oral Solution 
The  compatibility  of  lopinavir/ritonavir  with  the  2  mL  oral  dosing  syringe  was  assessed  at  ambient 
temperature  (25°C/60%  RH)  for  the  initial  time-point,  2  hours  and  12  hours;  and  at  accelerated 
conditions  30°C/65%  RH  for  3  hours,  each  in  triplicate.  No  significant  change  was  observed  in  lopinavir 
and ritonavir potency and degradation products at ambient conditions and accelerated conditions during 
storage of Kaletra Oral Solution in the 2 mL oral dosing syringe. Also, physical inspection of the samples 
showed  that  the  appearance,  colour,  and  clarity  specifications  were  met  after  storing  the  solutions  at 
these storage conditions. The results are summarized in Table 7.

2 mL Syringe 
2.2.1.  Discussion on quality aspects 
During assessment of the Kaletra PIP application, the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) commented that to 
minimize the risk of overdosage, an oral dosing syringe of 2 mL or 2.5 mL was recommended instead of 
the 5 mL oral dosing syringe included in the currently approved 300 mL (5 × 60 mL bottles) pack of 
Kaletra oral solution. In line with the PDCO recommendation, the marketing authorization holder (MAH) 
proposed to add a 2-mL oral dosing syringe for use with Kaletra oral solution when dosing paediatric 
patients who require a dosage of 2 mL or less. In addition, the MAH proposed to add a new pack size of 
two 60-mL bottles of Kaletra oral solution. The 120 mL pack size is a more appropriate size for the very 
young paediatric patients. The new pack size will include two 2-mL oral dosing syringes. The applications 
for the new administration device (2 ml syringe) and the 2-bottle pack have been grouped with this 
variation. 
Of note the 2 ml syringe is different from that of 5 ml: polyethylene for both barrel and plunger for the 2 
ml syringe and polypropylene for both barrel and plunger for that of 5 ml. The worst case compatability 
study found in section 3.2.P.2.6 under 12h/25°C-60%RH and 3h/30°C-65%RH largely mimicking the time 
of contact do not raise any particular issue.  
The MAH has also performed compatibility studies with materials of feeding tube (polyvinyl chloride and 
silicone) to support recommendation of use via a feeding tube in the SmPC. However, those data were 
later removed from the application further to interaction with EMA, as the EMA has judged that this 
should be a new route of administration to be adequately validated.  
The MAH has nevertheless maintained a statement in the SmPC as regards the incompatibility with 
polyurethane because of the ethanol content: “Because Kaletra oral solution contains alcohol, it is not 
recommended for use with polyurethane feeding tubes due to potential incompatibility.” This can be 
endorsed. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
Indeed  according  to  the  CHMP  in  the  initial  MA  and  PDCO,  to  support  an  indication  in  paediatrics,  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443456/2017 
Page 8/48 
 
  
  
 
toxicity  of  the  combination  was  also  evaluated  in  neonatal  (3-4  days  old  at  the  start  of  treatment)  or 
juvenile rats (16 days old at start of treatment) treated with oral doses up to 40/20 mg/kg/d and 100/50 
mg/kg respectively. Similar to the manifestation in adult animals, target organ toxicity was most evident 
in the liver of juvenile rats but less so in neonatal rats.  
Despite the fact that the combination altered pup viability at day 4 post-partum in rats at doses that were 
not toxic to the dams but not at weaning in the peri/post-natal development study, neonates (3-4 days 
old  at  the  start  of  treatment)  appear  to  be  less  sensitive  to  the  toxicity  produced  by  LPV/r  when 
compared with adult rats.  
No updated environmental risk assessment for lopinavir and ritonavir has been provided. However, as 
stated in the EPAR of KALETRA that the lack of environmental risk assessment was considered acceptable 
since lopinavir degrades under UV-light and rapid breakdown is to be expected based on the molecular 
structure of lopinavir/ritonavir. Moreover, the MAH provided data on the low incidence of HIV in children 
under 2 years of age in EU (< 300 / year). This extension of indication constitutes a marginal increased in 
the environmental exposure and the PECsurfacewater value is below 0.01 µg/L based on the maximum daily 
dose. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
As part of the PIP, additional data for dosing recommendations in infants, including newborns younger 
than 1 month of age, utilizing PK modelling was requested. The MAH committed to providing this update 
utilizing clinical trial simulations to estimate LPV exposure in paediatric patients with various heights and 
weights according to established growth chart distributions. 
PK simulations were conducted using the population PK model developed by Nikanjam et al in HIV-1-
infected infants 14 days to 6 months of age to summarize LPV exposure in a larger number of infants 14 
days to younger than 6 months of age, with varying body weight and BSA. The simulations also compare 
exposures of LPV achieved in infants dosed based on body weight (16 mg/kg LPV BID) and BSA (300 
mg/m2 LPV BID). Infant body weight distributions and BSA distributions based on the height and weight 
profiles from the WHO growth charts were utilized for the simulations. The goal of the simulations is to 
support dosing recommendations in these younger children < 6 months of age. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Clinical data were collected in 4 completed studies conducted outside the EU: AbbVie Study M98-940, 
Paediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) Studies P1030 and P1060 (both open-label paediatric LPV/r 
studies conducted by the PACTG with support from AbbVie), and CHER.

Population PK modelling 
In  addition,  as  part  of  the  PIP,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  additional  data  for  dosing 
recommendations  in  infants,  including  newborns  younger  than  1  month  of  age,  utilizing  PK  modeling. 
Therefore, PK simulations were conducted using the population PK model developed by Nikanjam et al1 in 
HIV-1-infected  infants  14  days  to  6  months  of  age,  with  varying  distributions  of  body  weight  and  BSA 
based  on  WHO  growth  charts.  These  analyses  used  a  one-compartment  model  with  first  order  oral 
absorption  in  NONMEM  with  an  exponential  error  model,  and  include  PK  and  efficacy  data  from  study 
P1030. Significant covariates in this model were RTV concentration and age. This model shows a higher 
apparent clearance and lower bioavailability in younger children:

Figure 1.  Population PK model results 
Estimated lopinavir apparent clearance (CL/F) in relation to age. The post hoc empiric Bayesian estimated 
value of CL/F was derived from the final pharmacokinetic model for intensive and sparse PK visits. The 
solid line represents the population-based CL/F profile, which was derived using the allometrically scaled 
median weight for each age group (WHO 50th percentile weight). Cross-validation of the final model 
demonstrated a median absolute error of 50% (25–112%, 25th–75th percentile), similar to the residual 
error of the model. There was positive bias in the model, with a median error of 18% (−29 to 112%, 
25th–75th percentile) probably because of nonadherence by some of the subjects before sparse sample 
collections.  
Monte-Carlo  simulations  were  performed  with  several  LPV  doses:  P1030  study  dose  (300  mg/m²  for  all 
subjects), FDA doses and WHO doses. Median LPV trough concentrations (C12) for each of the three age 
groups (0.5–2 months, 3–6 months, and >6 months) were similar for all dosing methods. The frequency 
of low concentrations (<1 μg/ml) with both the study doses and the FDA doses was 8.1% in infants <3 
months of age but rare (<1%) in older infants. The previously reported median adult trough level of 4.2 
μg/ml was approached in older infants (>3 months) but not in younger infants (< 3 months):

Figure 4.  Cross-Study Comparison of Steady-State AUC12 Across Populations 
The median (interquartile range) AUC for adults and children observed in Study M05-730 and Study M98-
940 was 89 (72 to 110) μg.h/mL and 75 (47 to 103) μg.h/mL, respectively. The clinical trial simulations 
based  on  weight  and  BSA  dosing  for  infants  resulted  in  median  (interquartile  range)  AUC  of  81  (56  to 
114) μg.h/mL and 79 (59 to 115) μg.h/mL, respectively, demonstrating comparability across studies and 
populations  of  varying  age  groups.  Additionally,  the  simulations  for  BID  dosing  based  on  weight  (16/4 
mg/kg LPV/r) or BSA (300/75 mg/m2 LPV/r) showed very comparable exposures in infants 14 days to < 
6 months of age. 
2.4.3.  Discussion and conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In  study  P1030,  the  initial  dose of  LPV/r  was  300/75  mg/m2.  The  mean  lopinavir  doses  administered to 
the subjects (267.19 mg/m2 and 274.17 mg/m2 BID in the younger and older cohorts, respectively) were 
less than the protocol-defined dose of 300 mg/m2, due to growth occurring between study drug initiation 
and pharmacokinetic samplings at Week 2. Overall, LPV AUC  and Cmin was lower than in older children 
and adults. In addition, the mean LPV exposure in the older cohort (6 weeks – 6 months) was higher than 
those in the younger cohort (14 days – 6 weeks).

Lower Cmin and AUC in the younger subjects were similarly observed for another PI, atazanavir. This may 
be explained by a lower bioavailability of these PI in younger subjects, resulting in a higher apparent oral 
clearance. Based on the PKPOP simulation, this lower bioavailability in younger subjects for a similar BSA-
based  dose  is  exponential  and  seems  markedly  pronounced  for  subjects  <3  months.  Additionally,  it  is 
known that there is a food effect of on the relative bioavailability of LPV. Dietary change during early life 
is put forward as a possible explanation, which is along the lines of the food effect. It is also a fact that 
enzymes responsible for drug metabolism mature during the first year or so. This is not accounted for in 
the model despite the fact that LPV is metabolized largely by enzymes of the CYP3A family. Therefore, the 
Applicant  should  re-discuss  the  adequacy  of  the  PKPOP  model  taking  into  account  the  different  reasons 
for the lower exposure in these children, notably the food effect and enzyme maturation. 
The  main  PK  concern  is  the  potential  underexposure  of  LPV  which  could  result  in  a  suboptimal  antiviral 
activity.  For  LPV,  a  Ctrough  >  1  µg/ml  was  defined  in  the  protocol  as  the  minimal  LPV  concentration 
required  to  maintain  an  optimal  antiviral  activity  (~15x  the  human  serum-adjusted  IC50  of  wild-type 
virus).  This  PK  threshold  was  previously  considered  in  another  clinical  paediatric  study  with  LPV 
(KONCERT study). In P1030 study, 2/27 subjects (7.4%; one subject in each cohort) had a LPV Ctrough < 
1  µg/ml  at  Week  2,  leading  to  a  LPV  dose  increase  to  450/112.5  mg/m2  BID.  One  of  these  subjects 
returned  to  the  initial  LPV/r  dose  300/75  mg/m²  because  of  overexposure,  suggesting  that  the  low  LPV 
Ctrough  observed  at  Week  2  was  probably  related  to  lack  of  Kaletra-intake.  The  PKPOP  simulation 
estimated that 8% of subjects < 3 months of age may had Ctrough < 1 µg/ml with the LPV/r dose 300/75 
mg/m². In addition, both results of the intensive PK sampling in P1030 study and of the PKPOP modelling 
show that LPV exposure (Cmin and AUC) is considerably lower in subjects < 3 months of age. Therefore, 
efficacy results of these subjects should be scrutinized and put in parallel with data from older children. 
The lower LPV exposure in subjects aged < 3 months receiving similar weight-based or BSA-based doses 
of  LPV/rtv  than  in  older  subjects  is  due  to  higher  apparent  oral  clearance  in  the  youngest  children. 
Therefore, higher doses of LPV/rtv may be considered. In study P1030, Cmin is slightly lower in subjects 
aged <6 weeks (mean: 1.40 µg/ml, median: 1.26 µg/ml) than in subjects aged ≥6 weeks to <6 months 
(mean: 1.95 µg/ml, median: 1.39 µg/ml), but the range of Cmin between these 2 cohorts overlapped. The 
applicant sticks to the same level of argument as regards the reassuring efficacy data derived from P030 
despite  lower  PK  levels  than  in  adults.  To  obtain  higher  Cmin  by  modifying  the  dosing  interval,  an 
administration  three  times  a  day  might  be  required  which  has  not  been  specifically  discussed  by  the 
applicant  but  acknowledged  as  being  potentially  confusing  given  that  a  twice  daily  regimen  is 
recommended for older subjects (and a QD regimen may also be used in adults).  
This issue is challenging since Kaletra is already part of the US labelling for children from 2 weeks of age, 
is already part of therapeutic paediatric guidelines, notably by the US, French and WHO guidelines using 
LPV/rtv-containing  regimen  to  treat  infants  and  small  children  <  2  years  of  age.  So  it  has  become  a 
standard  of  care  in  the  management  of  youngest  children.  Finally  having  considered  the  later  together 
with  the lack  of  particular  signal on  efficacy/resistance  from  the limited  data derived  from  study  P1030, 
this  extension  of  the  indication  could  be  acceptable  provided  that  further  reassurance  in  terms  of 
efficacy/resistance post marketing.  
The model incorporates allometric scaling of drug disposition parameters to body weight. This means that 
the effect on PK of a difference in body size between subjects, as well as due to individual growth, is built 
into the model. The disposition parameters are related to body weight but to different extent (clearance 
to the power of 0.75 and volume of distribution to the power of 1). The predicted effective half-life is a 
function  of  both  clearance  and  volume  and  will  also  be  dependent  on  body  size.  Notwithstanding 
maturation  of  elimination,  half-life  will  increase  with  increasing  body  size.  The  trough  concentration, 
closely  related  to  half-life,  will  also  show  a  relative  increase  even  if  the  dose  level  is  adjusted  for  body 
size.  For  Kaletra,  the  same  dosing  interval,  twice  daily,  is  proposed  for  the  entire  paediatric  population. 
There  is  a  concern  that  this  may  lead  to  low  trough  concentrations.  A  warning  describing  the  observed

exposures in young children from 14 days to 3 months of approximately 35% AUC12 and 75% lower Cmin 
than  in  adults  that  may  lead  to  inadequate  virologic  suppression  and  emergence  of  resistance has  been 
introduced in the SmPC.  
For subjects > 6 months old, the FDA-dose (LPV/r 230/57.5 mg/m² BID) is more appropriate to provide 
LPV exposure equivalent to in adults treated by LPV/r 400/100 mg BID.

2.5.1.  Main studies 
Study M98-940: Study Title: Open-label, randomized, multi-center, multi-country study of ABT-
378/ritonavir in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors in HIV-infected children. 
This study was previously assessed by the CHMP for the current paediatric indication of Kaletra in children 
above 2 years old. 
Study design 
This  is  an  open-label  study  of  LPV/r  starting  in  1999  in  100  ARV-naïve  (44%)  and  experienced  (56%) 
paediatric  subjects.  Subjects  were  randomized  to  receive  either  LPV/r  230/57.5  mg/m2 or  LPV/r  300/75 
mg/m2.  Naïve  patients  also  received  NRTI.  Experienced  patients  received LPV/r,  nevirapine  +  up  to  two 
NRTI.  Safety,  efficacy  and  pharmacokinetic  profiles  of  the  two  dose  regimens  were  assessed  after  3 
weeks of therapy in each patient. Subsequently, all patients were continued on the 300/75 mg/m2 dose. 
Baseline characteristics 
Fourteen subjects were 6 months to < 2 years of age and 86 subjects were 2 years to 12 years of age. In 
addition, 44 were ARV naïve and 56 ARV experienced.

Study P1060 – Study Title: Phase II Parallel, Randomized, Clinical Trials Comparing the Responses to 
Initiation of NNRTI-Based Versus PI-Based Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV-Infected Infants Who Have and 
Have Not Previously Received Single Dose Nevirapine for Prevention of Mother-to-Child HIV Transmission 
Study design  
Study P1060 was a parallel, randomized clinical trial of NVP versus LPV/r-based ART in subjects 2 to 36 
months of age infected with HIV-1 who had (Cohort I) and had not (Cohort II) been exposed to NVP for 
prevention  of  mother-to-child  transmission  (PMTCT).  LPV/r  was  administered  16/4,  12/3,  10/2.5  mg/kg 
or 400/100 mg BID. The study was conducted by the PACTG. 
The primary endpoint was treatment failure at week 24, defined as a confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA level 
<  1  log10  copies/ml  below  the  study  entry  value  at  12  to  24  weeks  after  treatment  was  initiated,  a 
confirmed  value  >  75,000  copies/ml  at  12  to  24  weeks  if  a  subject’s  study  entry  HIV-1  RNA  was  > 
750,000  copies/ml,  a  confirmed  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  level  >  400  copies/ml  at  24  weeks  after 
randomisation, or permanent discontinuation of study treatment at or prior to 24 weeks of treatment for 
any reason, including death. 
Treatments  
Lopinavir/ritonavir was administered twice daily at 16/4 mg/kg for subjects 2 months to < 6 months, 
12/3 mg/kg for subjects ≥ 6 months and < 15 kg, 10/2.5 mg/kg for subjects ≥ 6 months and ≥ 15 kg to 
< 40 kg, or 400/100 mg for subjects ≥ 40 kg. The nevirapine-based regimen was 160-200 mg/m2 once 
daily for 14 days, then 160-200 mg/m2 every 12 hours. Both treatment arms included zidovudine 180 
mg/m2 every 12 hours and lamivudine 4 mg/kg every 12 hours. 
Baseline characteristics 
A total of 451 subjects (164 in Cohort I [82 nevirapine and 82 lopinavir/ritonavir] and 287 in Cohort II 
[147 nevirapine and 140 lopinavir/ritonavir]) received study treatment. 
At entry, median age was 0.7 years, median CD4 T-cell count was 1147 cells/mm3, median CD4% T-cell 
was 19%, and median HIV-1 RNA was > 750,000 copies/ml.

Shortly after Primary Infection in a Resource Poor Setting 
Study design 
This  is  a  randomized, open-label  Phase 3  study  starting in  2004  comparing  3 treatment  strategies  (ART 
deferred  [ART-def],  early  ART  for  40  weeks  [ART-40W],  or  early  ART  for  96  weeks  [ART-96W])  in 
children with prenatally acquired HIV-1 infection diagnosed between 6 and 12 weeks of age. The trial had 
two parts: Part A and Part B. 
- Infants in Part A were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to deferred ART (Arm 1), ART for 40 weeks (Arm 2) 
or ART for 96 weeks (Arm 3) 
- Infants in Part B were randomized to Arms 2 (ART-40W) and 3 (ART-96W), as randomization into Arm 1 
(ART-Def) would be unethical.

Efficacy data 
The primary efficacy endpoint was time to death or failure of first-line ART, defined as follows: 
- Failure to reach a CD4+% of 20% or more by Week 24; 
- A decrease in CD4+% to less than 20% after the first 24 weeks on ARV therapy (immunologic failure); 
- Severe CDC Stage B or Stage C events (clinical failure); 
-  Toxicity  requiring  one  or  more  drug  substitutions  within  the  same  class  or  a  switch  to  a  new  class  or 
requiring permanent discontinuation of treatment; 
- HIV-1 RNA value ≥ 10,000 copies/mL recorded on 2 consecutive separate occasions after 24 weeks of 
treatment (initial therapy or restart).

For Study M05-730, beginning at Week 24, if the subject's plasma HIV-1 RNA level was > 50 copies/mL 
and at the previous visit the plasma HIV-1 RNA was < 50 copies/mL, confirmatory plasma HIV-1 RNA 
(including a sample for HIV-1 drug resistance genotyping) was repeated within 4 weeks. If the 
confirmatory plasma HIV-1 RNA was ≥ 400 copies/mL, the sample collected for HIV-1 drug resistance 
genotyping at the time of the confirmatory plasma HIV-1 RNA level was to be analyzed. 
For Study M10-336, beginning at Week 8, if the subject's plasma HIV-1 RNA level was ≥ 40 copies/mL 
and at the previous visit the plasma HIV-1 RNA was < 40 copies/mL, confirmatory plasma HIV-1 RNA 
(including a sample for HIV-1 drug resistance genotyping) was repeated within 4 weeks. If the 
confirmatory plasma HIV-1 RNA was > 400 copies/mL, the sample collected for HIV-1 drug resistance 
genotyping at the time of the confirmatory plasma HIV-1 RNA level was to be analyzed.

2.5.2.  Discussion and conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Currently,  LPV/r  is  indicated  in  EU  in  subjects  ≥  2  years  of  age,  this  is  different  from  the  US  situation 
where  this  boosted  PI  is  registered  in  children  from  2  weeks  of  age.  The  MAH  is  now  claiming  an 
extension  of  indication  to  align  the  paediatric  age  limit  in  EU  and  US.  In  the  context  of  this  paediatric 
extension  application,  all  of  the  4  clinical  studies  submitted  provide  efficacy  data  of  LPV/r  in  subjects 
below 2 years of age, but with different lower limits of age: the younger subjects were mainly studied in 
studies P1030 (14 days – 6 months old) and CHER (6 weeks – 12 weeks old), and children above 
6 months were studied in studies P1060 (2 months – 36 months old) and M98-940 (6 months – 2 years 
old).  
Based on these pooled data, it is observed that the rate of subjects with virologic failure (i.e. HIV-1 RNA 
≥  400  c/ml)  seems  higher  in  the  lower  age  strata:  At  week  48,  this  rate  was  respectively  36.5%,  17% 
and  3%  in  ART-naïve  subjects  aged  <3  months,  between  6  months  to  2  years  and  in  adults  (subjects 
aged  from  3  months  to  6  months  were  not  considered  as  their  number  –  n=13  –  was  too  low  to  be 
relevant).  Nevertheless,  rates  of  virologic  suppression  of  70-80%  have  been  reported  in  HIV-infected 
infants initiating therapy at <12 months (NIH Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Pediatric 
HIV  Infection,  2016),  which  is  consistent  with  the  results  of  these  paediatric  studies.  Furthermore,  a 
suboptimal LPV exposure might be associated to emergence of PI-RAM, which was not the case in these 
studies. In conclusion, no efficacy concern was highlighted in these studies. However, while these pooled 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443456/2017 
Page 31/48 
 
  
  
 
data  give  an  overview  in  children  <3  months  of  age  it  is  important  to  keep  in  mind  that  the  4  clinical 
studies  in  support  of  this  extension  of  indication  (P1030,  P1060,  CHER,  M98-940)  have  different  lower 
limits  of  age  and  that  the  younger  subjects  (source  of  concern  for  potential  suboptimal  exposure)  were 
mainly  studied  in  studies  P1030  (14  days  –  6  months  old)  and  CHER  (6  weeks  –  12  weeks  old),  while 
older children above 6 months were studied in studies P1060 (2 months – 36 months old) and M98-940 
(6  months  –  2  years  old).  Overall,  LPV/r  300/75  mg/m²  is  used  for  children  <  6  months  old.  In  study 
P1060,  the  FDA  weight-based  doses  were  used,  resulting  in  similar  LPV  exposures  than  with  the  BSA-
based doses. In study CHER, the LPV doses correspond to those in the AbbVie’s monograph of Kaletra. 
Due to the diversity of these studies, all ages from 14 days to 2 years old are more or less represented. 
The  main  relevant  efficacy  endpoints  available  within  these  studies  are  the  rate  of  subjects  with  HIV-1 
RNA level < 400 c/ml and the mean changes from baseline in the CD4 count at Week 48. In general, the 
efficacy data issued from these studies did not highlight specific concern for children < 2 years of age.

More specifically in each study, it may be highlighted: 
•  An  equivalent  antiviral  efficacy  and  immunologic  response  between  different  age  groups  treated 
by  LPV/r-based  regimen  (<  or  ≥  2  years  old  in  study  M98-940;  <  or  ≥  6  weeks  old  in  study 
P1030; < or ≥ 12 months old in study P1060). 
•  A better antiviral response with LPV/r-based regimen than NVP-based regimen in subjects study 
P1060 in subjects between 2 months and 36 months of age (study P1060). 
•  A  decrease  of  the  mean  CD4  count  through  Week  48  in  subjects  under  LPV/r-based  regimen  in 
CHER study. Nevertheless, subjects without ART experienced a significant higher decrease of their 
CD4  count  (-572  cells/mm3).  As  stated  by  the  MAH,  it  should  be  taken  into  account  that  a 
decrease in CD4 counts during the first few years of life is observed in uninfected subjects. 
Given that a lower LPV exposure was observed in subjects < 3 months of age based on the observed data 
from  study  P1030  and  the  simulated  data  from  the  PKPOP  model,  a  focus  should  be  made  on  these 
younger subjects. Thus, study P1030 compared very young children (< 6 weeks of age) with older (> 6 
weeks  to  6  months  of  age),  and  study  CHER  enrolled  subjects  below  3  months  of  age.  The  data  from 
other studies did not allow substantiating efficacy in such very young subjects: a higher age-cut off was 
used  in  study  P1060  (<  or  ≥  1  year  old)  and  study  M98-940  enrolled  subjects  above  6  months  of  age. 
Efficacy  data  from  P1030  and  CHER  studies  are  reassuring  on  the  antiviral  efficacy  of  LPV/r  300/75 
mg/m² BID in children below 3 months of age, with significant rates of virologically suppressed subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443456/2017 
Page 32/48 
 
  
  
 
 
 
and  low  rates  of  clinical,  virologic  and/or  immunologic  failures.  In  both  studies,  LPV/r  was  mainly 
associated with AZT+3TC, a reference treatment for paediatric patients. 
In conclusion, LPV/r in combination with 2 NRTIs and at doses equivalent to 300/75 mg/m² for children < 
6 months and 230/57.5 mg/m2 BID for older children (i.e. the FDA BSA- or weight-based doses) seems 
effective in children from 14 days to 2 years old. Further reassurance on the risk of inadequate virologic 
suppression in children <3 month of age (due to suboptimal PK exposure of Kaletra in this subgroup) is 
nevertheless expected. 
In addition, it is noted that the proposed posology of LPV/r in patients from 14 days to 6 months of age is 
only  BSA-based  (300/75  mg/m²)  whereas  in  US  the  posology  in  these  subjects  is  both  BSA-based 
(300/75  mg/m²)  and  weight-based  (16/4  mg/kg).  The  MAH  was  requested  to  add  weight-based  dosing 
recommendations for paediatric patients aged 14 days to 6 months to section 4.2 Posology and method 
of  administration  of  the  Kaletra  oral  solution  SmPC.  The  information  reflected  in  the  EU  SmPC  and  US 
product information is aligned. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety of Kaletra oral solution in paediatric patients older than 2 years of age and infected with HIV 
was initially established and supported in the authorization application by Study M98-940. For this 
extension of indication, safety data for children from 14 days to 2 years old were issued from the clinical 
studies M98-940, P1030, P1060 and CHER, and from the post-marketing safety data review of LPV/r for 
this paediatric population.

Median: 37 and 60 weeks for cohort I and 
cohort II (both in younger and older 
subjects), respectively 
40 weeks or 48 weeks depending on the 
group (n=123 subjects in both groups) 
The most commonly reported (> 30% of subjects) adverse events (AEs) were related to infections (or 
symptoms of infections), related to the digestive system (including vomiting and diarrhea), rash, or 
accidental injury. The majority of AEs were reported as mild and considered probably not related to study

drug. Eight subjects reported AEs of at least moderate severity and of possible, probable, or unknown 
relationship to study drug. Of those AEs, rash was the only event reported by ≥ 2% of subjects. 
In total, 2 subjects prematurely discontinued the study due to an adverse event or HIV-related event. 
One subject prematurely discontinued the study on Day 93 due to an HIV-related event (Burkitt's 
lymphoma) and died as a result 16 days later. A second subject prematurely terminated prior to the 
Week 48 visit due to pancreatitis, which was considered possibly related to study drug. Serious adverse 
events (SAEs) were reported for 27/100 subjects during the study, of which one event (pancreatitis, 
mentioned in the previous sentence) was considered possibly-related to study drug by the investigator. 
No clinically relevant differences were seen with respect to age or treatment experience.

Study P1030: 
Seven subjects (23%), 3 from the younger cohort and 4 from the older cohort, had AEs that were 
considered possibly related to study treatment while no adverse event (AE) was considered definitely 
related to study treatment. The maximal grade for the AEs was Grade 3 for these 7 subjects. All possibly 
treatment-related Grade 3 AEs for the younger cohort were low absolute neutrophil count occurring at 
either Week 8 or Week 12. These AEs resolved after adjusting or temporarily withholding concurrent NRTI 
therapy. For the older cohort, the possibly related Grade 3 AEs were hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, 
hyponatremia, and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT). These events were transient and did not 
require premature discontinuation from the study or treatment adjustment.  
Across both cohorts combined, 11 subjects (35%) had Grade 3 or higher signs or symptoms, including 3 
(30%) in the younger cohort and 8 (38%) in the older cohort. Two of the 11 subjects affected had Grade 
4 events. The most frequent Grade 3 or 4 signs/symptoms were fever and blister/ulcer/lesions. The most 
frequent laboratory toxicities were low absolute neutrophil count and potassium abnormalities.

Four subjects prematurely discontinued from the study because of AEs: one subject from the younger 
cohort (failure to thrive), and 3 subjects from the older cohort (Grade 1 vomiting and soft stools, CMV 
infection with severe respiratory involvement leading to death and Grade 3 anemia). None of them were 
considered related to study treatment.  
Twelve SAEs that were considered probably or possibly related to study treatment or ones whose 
relationships were unable to be judged by the study team occurred in 8 subjects. The SAEs included 
decreased absolute neutrophil count, neutropenia, decreased hemoglobin, anemia, hyperkalemia, 
abnormal stools, vomiting, hyponatremia, increased ALT, and abnormal amylase. Many of these SAEs 
were considered possibly related to concomitant ARV medications or improved with ongoing or resumed 
therapy.  
Overall, the AEs seen in this paediatric study of very young subjects were similar to those seen in 
previous paediatric and adult studies of LPV/r. The study did not identify any drug-specific safety 
concerns related to gastrointestinal, hepatic, or metabolic effects that have not previously been identified 
in paediatric subjects who have received LPV/r. 
Study P1060: 
A secondary objective of Study P1060 was to compare the safety profile of a NVP-based HAART regimen 
with a LPV/r-based regimen in HIV-infected children between 2 months and 36 months of age who had 
(Cohort I) or had not (Cohort II) been exposed to single-dose NVP for PMTCT of HIV. 
Among the LPV/r-treated subjects in Cohort I (82 subjects), the most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 
AEs was diarrhoea/loose stools (Grade 3 in 2 subjects). The most frequent laboratory toxicity was low 
absolute neutrophil counts. One subject was taken off study treatment because of protocol-defined 
elevated liver function tests toxicity (Grade 4 ALT and jaundice) that was not life-threatening and was 
treatment-related. Three subjects (4%) died while on study. The causes of death were burns, pneumonia, 
and cardiac and pulmonary arrest. The burns and pneumonia were considered not related to study 
treatment, and the relationship of the cardiac/pulmonary arrest to study drug remains unassigned. 
Among the LPV/r-treated subjects in Cohort II (140 subjects), the most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 
AEs were fever and diarrhoea/loose stools. The most frequent laboratory toxicities were low absolute 
neutrophil counts and low haemoglobin.

Five subjects were taken off study treatment for treatment-related events (3 neutropenia, 1 anemia and 
1 thrombocytopenia). Three subjects (2%) died while on study. The causes of death were congestive 
cardiac failure, gastroenteritis and measles. All 3 deaths were considered not related to study treatment. 
Overall, LPV/r was tolerated well by subjects, with no overall difference in ≥ Grade 3 AEs or frequency of 
AEs between cohorts. There were no concerning safety trends observed and no new safety signal was 
identified specific to subjects in the study population. The safety findings from this paediatric study were 
consistent with the safety profile of LPV/r when used in the adult and paediatric population, as detailed in 
the current LPV/r product information. 
Study CHER: 
Out of the 411 subjects included in the safety analysis, 142 subjects (34.5%) reported a total of 279 
Grade 3 or 4 AEs: 56 subjects (44.8%) in the ART-deferred arm, 38 subjects (26.6%) in the ART-40W 
arm, and 48 subjects (33.6%) in the ART-96W arm. The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 AEs 
(among those reported in at least 5% of subjects in any arm) were gastroenteritis and pneumonia. 
Table 28.  Grade 3 or 4 AEs Reported in at Least 5% of Subjects in Any Arm in CHER Study 
a. Listed under system organ class (SOC) of Infections and Infestations. 
b. Listed under SOC of Gastrointestinal Disorders. 
Across all 3 arms, 31 subjects (7.5%) reported 44 events that were considered LPV/r ART-related with 
similar frequencies seen across the arms. The most frequent ART-related events across the arms were 
neutropenia (15 events in 13 subjects) as well as 6 events each of anaemia (5 subjects) and 
gastroenteritis (6 subjects). The rates of laboratory events (particularly those considered ART-related) 
were similar and low in all 3 arms. There were no study treatment discontinuations because of laboratory 
toxicity.  
The most frequently occurring SAEs (at least 50 events) were gastroenteritis infection and pneumonia. 
Hospitalizations were reported in a higher number of subjects in the ART-deferred arm (52 subjects) than 
in the ART-40W arm (31 subjects) and the ART-96W arm (36 subjects). A total of 37 deaths occurred 
during the first 48 weeks of study participation in the 411 subjects included in the safety analysis. The 
mortality rate was higher in the ART-def arm (21 subjects; 16.8%) relative to the ART-40W (9 subjects; 
6.3%) and ART-96W (7 subjects; 4.9%) arms. The majority of the deaths occurred within the SOCs of 
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions and Infections and Infestations. 
Overall, the data show a limited number of drug-related AEs. The CHER study results provide supporting 
evidence of the durability of LPV/r-based first-line ART for children and demonstrate a safety profile of 
LPV/r in children from 6 weeks of age that is consistent with the known safety profile in adults and older 
children as detailed in the LPV/r product information.

Post marketing experience 
The AbbVie global post-marketing safety database was searched for all reports that satisfy the following 
case definition: reports coincident with LPV/r oral solution received from 01 January 1900 through 12 
March 2015 in children and infants younger than 2 years of age.  
Of the 65 unique reports describing adverse events associated with Kaletra oral solution in the paediatric 
population younger than 2 years of age, 11 reports were confounded, 26 reports had an alternative 
ethology for the adverse event(s), and 19 (excluding 1 likely duplicate) had no apparent alternative 
ethology for the adverse event(s). 
In total, 9 reports had a fatal outcome. Of these, 8 reports had an alternate ethology for the event(s) and 
1 fatal outcome was the result of a medication error. 
In total, there are 11 serious reports of toxicity associated with Kaletra oral solution (including LPV/r, 
propylene glycol, and/or ethanol) in (preterm) neonates. All serious reports of toxicity were received prior 
to the implementation of 2011 labelling revisions in the EU regarding the risk associated with dosing in 
(premature) neonates. The 5 reports of medication error were received prior to the implementation of 
these labelling revisions. 
In 2011, revisions to the Kaletra Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) were made in section 4.4 
and section 4.9 to reflect the important identified risk of medication error and toxicity in neonates, 
especially in premature neonates. In addition, the risk of toxicity in preterm neonates was included in the 
Kaletra risk management plan, and routine risk minimization, including product labelling, was considered 
adequate to manage this risk. 
Excluding reports of toxicity associated with Kaletra oral solution, the remaining reports include reports of 
medication error, taste intolerance, treatment failure as a result of resistance development, and labelled 
drug-drug interactions with fluticasone and nevirapine and adverse reactions that are already labelled for 
LPV/r. These adverse reactions include upper and lower respiratory tract infections, diarrhoea, vomiting, 
gastroenteritis, abdominal distension, anaemia, hepatitis, lactic acidosis, IRIS, dermatitis, and seizure. 
Analyses of the reports in this focused review indicate that the adverse reactions described are all 
consistent with the known safety profile of Kaletra in older children and in adults, as described in the 
Kaletra product labelling. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall,  the  results  of  the  4  paediatric  studies  did  not  highlight  new  safety  concerns  specific  to  the 
paediatric subjects below 2 years of age. Given that LPV/r was associated to a backbone regimen mainly 
composed of AZT+3TC, neutropenia and anaemia were frequently reported. Potential impact of LPV/r on 
growth in these subjects is difficult to appreciate due to other cofounders (malnutrition, low care system) 
but is not particularly expected based on animal juvenile data. The safety profile of LPV/r in children <2 
years  of  age  is  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  in  adults  and  older  children  as  detailed  in  the 
LPV/r product information. 
Nevertheless,  a  focus  should  be  made  on  the  known-toxicity  of  the  excipients  of  Kaletra  oral  solution. 
Indeed,  Kaletra  oral  solution  contains  approximately  42.4%  (v/v)  alcohol  (or  356.3  mg  alcohol  per  mL) 
and 152.7 mg of propylene glycol per mL. Serious cases of alcohol or propylene glycol toxicity associated 
with Kaletra oral solution in (preterm) neonates were reported in post marketing experience. 
The  serious  AEs  associated  to  these  excipients  are:  hyperosmolality,  renal  toxicity,  central  nervous 
system (CNS) depression (including stupor, coma, and apnoea), seizures, hypotonia, cardiac arrhythmias 
and  ECG  changes,  and  haemolysis.  Deaths  were  reported  in  case  of  overdose.  It  is  noted  that 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443456/2017 
Page 38/48 
 
  
  
pharmacokinetic parameters of propylene glycol in neonates differ significantly from adult values leading 
to  its  accumulation  following  repeated  administration  (longer  elimination  half-life,  limited  renal  and 
metabolic  clearances)  or  when  administered  in  combination  with  another  substrate  of  alcohol 
dehydrogenase (limiting step of metabolism) such as ethanol (e.g. toxicity of some anti-viral treatments 
in neonates). 
To  mitigate  this  risk,  a  warning  was  added  in  2011  in  the  SmPC  to  alert  the  prescribers.  No  further 
reports of alcohol or propylene glycol toxicity in neonates associated with Kaletra oral solution have been 
reported since these SmPC revisions. 
As part of this paediatric extension, new oral dosing syringes of 2 ml, in addition to the current syringes 
of 5 ml, are now proposed in order to reduce the risk of overdose in younger subjects. This measure was 
recommended  by  the  PDCO.  In  clinical  practice,  this  new  2  ml  syringe  would  be  more  appropriate  for 
subjects < 6 months of age and for subjects > 6 months of age with low BSA (<0.7 m²) and weight (<13 
kg). Therefore the new packaging consisting in two 60 ml bottles of Kaletra with two 2 ml syringes should 
be  prescribed  only  for  these  patients,  and  the  current  packaging  with  five  60  ml  bottles  of  Kaletra  and 
two 5 ml syringes must continue to be prescribed for other patients requiring volumes of Kaletra > 2 ml. 
A special attention should be exercised by the pharmacists on the adequate packaging to be dispensed in 
accordance  to  the  volume  of  Kaletra  to  be  administered,  and  notably  to  inform  the  care  administrators 
when  a  switch  of  packaging  is  required.  The  MAH  should  discuss  the  risk  minimization  measures 
envisaged to mitigate the risk of confusion relative to the adequate packaging to be delivered.  
The estimated amount of alcohol in subjects <2 years of age was calculated by the MAH: 
Table 29.  Amount of Alcohol Ingested by Children 14 Days to 2 Years of Age Relative to Potential 
Dose of LPV/r Oral Solution (BSA-Based Dosing) 
a. BSA was calculated based on the Haycock equation: BSA = (weight in kg) 0.5378 × (height in cm) 0.3964 × 0.024265. Average height and weight were 
determined using the 50th percentile weights from Female WHO Growth Charts. Source: WHO. 
b. LPV/r dose was calculated as 300/75 mg/m2 in children ≤  6 months of age and 230/57.5 mg/m2 in children older than 6 months of age. 
c. Concentration of LPV/r oral solution is 80 mg/mL, with an alcohol concentration of 0.3563 g/mL. 
d. Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) (mg/dL) = (amount of alcohol (in mg)/[(distribution coefficient, 0.75 L/kg) × (weight in kg)]) × 0.1 L/dL. Note: Volume 
of distribution coefficient obtained from Cordoni. 
It appears that the estimated maximum blood alcohol concentrations will be approximately 10-12 mg/dl 
for the younger subjects, which is accordance to the WHO guidelines (<20-25 mg/dl) and EMA guidelines 
(<12.5 mg/dl).  
The estimated amount of propylene glycol with Kaletra 300/75 mg/m² in subjects < 6 months of age or 
230/57.5  mg/m2  in  children  >  6  months  of  age  was  estimated  by  the  MAH  to  be  generally  below  10 
mg/dL. In children 6 months of age and older, a LPV/r dose increase to 300 mg/m2 (equivalent to LPV 13 
mg/kg for patients < 15 kg and 11 mg/kg for patients ≥ 15 kg) may be considered when co-administered 
with  CYP-inducing  ARVs.  Therefore,  an  approximate  10%  to  30%  increase  in  propylene  glycol  intake 
(similar  percentage  increase  observed  for  alcohol)  may  result.  Overall,  according  to  the  MAH,  this  is 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/443456/2017 
Page 39/48 
 
  
  
 
nearly 100-fold below the concentration reported in cases of propylene glycol toxicity in infants, in which 
propylene glycol maximum concentrations of 930 to 1,060 mg/dL were reported. 
However,  a  draft  background  review  for  the  excipient  propylene  glycol  is  under  review  by  the  EMA. 
According the published draft, it is noted that a PDE of 1 mg/kg with very conservative safety limits based 
upon  non  clinical  data,  was  derived  for  children  below  five  years  of  age.  Despite  the  fact  that  at  the 
present  time  the  published  clinical  data  demonstrate  that  higher  propylene  glycol  load  may  be  safely 
administered  to  patients  particularly  to  children  above  4  years  of  age  and  adults,  a  more  cautious 
approach is still recommended for patients below 5 years of age because of the paucity of clinical data in 
this population. 
Concerning  children  below  1  month  of  age:  “In  (pre)term  neonates  De  Cock  et  al.  have  demonstrated 
that  total  body  clearance  is  very  low  compare  to  the  adult  clearance,  but  also  that  the  contribution  of 
renal clearance to the total body clearance is very low. The results of this study may indicate that due to 
maturational  changes,  some  drug/drug  metabolic  interactions  are  more  relevant  for  this  specific 
population. This may explain the toxicities observed in neonates given Kaletra® which contains 356.3 mg 
ethanol/mL  and  152.7  mg  propylene  glycol/mL.  Considering  also  the  data  produced  by  Shehab  and 
Whittaker  showing  the  multiple  sources  of  propylene  glycol  and  ethanol  in  neonatalogy  units,  it  is 
proposed  to  restrict  the  safety  limit  to  1  mg/kg  in  preterm  neonates  below  44  weeks  of  post 
menstrual age, or below one month post-natal age for term neonates.” 
When  referring  to  the  draft  background  review  for  the  excipient  propylene  glycol  under  review  by  the 
EMA, the propylene glycol content in children >1 month of Kaletra is higher than the limit of 50 mg/kg set 
by the EMA for this subgroup. Overall, the total daily intake of propylene glycol will be above the 
safety  limit  considered  by  EMA  of  1  mg/kg/day  (for  neonates  up  to  28  days)  and  50 
mg/kg/day (for children aged 1 month up to  4 years)  and  should  therefore  be  closely  monitored, 
especially  given  ABC  and  3TC  oral  solutions  (both  containing  propylene  glycol)  may  be  co-administered 
with Kaletra.  
It  is  also  important  to  note  that  based  on  the  EMA  guideline  under  review  ethanol  content  >75  mg/kg 
would  preclude  the  use  of  medicinal  product  in  children  <  6  years  of  age.  Kaletra  administration  in 
children > 3.5 kg would imply a borderline acceptable approximately 70 mg/kg ethanol content. 
It  is  important  to  underline  that  the  PDCO  has  recommended  setting  a  Pharmacovigilance  cohort  based 
on the high ethanol and propylene glycol exposure. The MAH committed to perform targeted follow-up of 
spontaneously  reported  cases  specific  to  the  patient  group  (2  weeks  to  2  years  of  age)  administered 
Kaletra  oral  solution  via  the  use  of  a  structured  questionnaire  in  order  to  ensure  improved  collection  of 
information specifically related to ethanol and propylene glycol levels, and to the duration of Kaletra oral 
solution  use.  In  addition,  the  MAH  will  submit  a  safety  review  (LEG  procedure  with  a  1  year  interval) 
focused on adverse events in children 14 days to 2 years of age that may suggest toxicity with ethanol or 
propylene glycol. The review should include a discussion of the benefit/risk balance in this population, in 
light of emerging data.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety of Kaletra is well characterised. However, chronic exposure to propylene glycol and ethanol in 
youngest children should be monitored. The MAH will submit a yearly safety review (LEG procedure) 
focused on adverse events in children 14 days to 2 years of age that may suggest toxicity with ethanol or 
propylene glycol. The review should include a discussion of the benefit/risk balance in this population, in 
light of emerging data. The CHMP considers the MAH should submit the first yearly safety review (LEG 
procedure) within 2 months following EC decision.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Kaletra is characterised by a high potency and genetic barrier to resistance. A large clinical experience 
has been gained since its original MA in 2001. 
3.1.1.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
It is already part of therapeutic guidelines (US and EU-PENTA guidelines) for the first-line ARV regimens 
in the treatment of HIV-infected infants and children < 2 years of age. 
3.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
In the context of this paediatric extension application, clinical data of LPV/r in children < 2 years old were 
provided by the clinical studies M98-940, P1030, P1060 and CHER. 
All of the 4 clinical studies submitted provide clinical data of LPV/r in subjects below 2 years of age, but 
with different lower limits of age: the younger subjects were mainly enrolled in studies P1030 (14 days – 
6 months old) and CHER (6 weeks – 12 weeks old).

While no particular alert was raised from the clinical studies and US postmarketing experience, the MAH 
should make a proposal to derive further reassurance on the risk of suboptimal PK exposure of Kaletra in 
children <3 month of age (particular focus on inadequate virologic suppression in this subgroup). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Based on the clinical experience derived from the clinical studies performed to cover the targeted 
paediatric population and the US post-marketing experience there is no apparent concern of a differential 
safety profile in children from 14 years of age from the well substantiated safety profile in adults, 
adolescents and children from 2 years of age. 
The sensitive issue in relation to the use of Kaletra in very young children relies on the high content of 
ethanol and propylene glycol (PG) in the existing oral solution. This has been extensively discussed by the 
PDCO, which finally has considered that this oral solution could be regarded as compatible with the use in 
neonates from 14 days of age, taking into account the followings:  
- Kaletra is intended to be used for the treatment of HIV-1 infected children so that the benefits related to 
the use of Kaletra are expected to outweigh the potential risks related to the presence of ethanol and PG, 
- Kaletra is already authorized in children > 2 years (as well as Norvir) in Europe, 
- Kaletra is authorized in children above 14 days in the US therefore, clinical experience has been gained. 
To minimize the risk of overdosage, a 2 ml volume syringe is available. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
It is important to underline that the PDCO has recommended setting a Pharmacovigilance cohort based 
on the high ethanol and propylene glycol exposure in the target patient population. The MAH committed 
to perform targeted follow-up of spontaneously reported cases specific to the patient group (2 weeks to 2 
years of age) administered Kaletra oral solution via the use of a structured questionnaire in order to 
ensure improved collection of information specifically related to ethanol and propylene glycol levels, and 
to the duration of Kaletra oral solution use. In addition, the MAH will submit a safety review (LEG 
procedure with a 1 year interval) focused on adverse events in children 14 days to 2 years of age that 
may suggest toxicity with ethanol or propylene glycol. The review should include a discussion of the 
benefit/risk balance in this population, in light of emerging data.  
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
Kaletra is recommend in the EU and US therapeutic guidelines for the first line regimens in young children 
due to its high potency and high genetic barrier to resistance, the availability of an oral solution. Kaletra 
has a well characterized safety profile based on large clinical experience gained since its MA in 2001. 
The benefit/risk balance of Kaletra oral solution in children from 14 days of age can be considered 
positive. However, adequate warnings on the high content of ethanol and propylene glycol and particular 
scrutiny of pharmacovigilance data (safety and efficacy) in the younger subgroup of paediatric patients 
<3 months of age have been put in place.  
The clinical development programme in support of this extension of indication and the 2 ml syringe to 
minimize the risk of overdosage in younger children is overall in line with the PDCO discussion on the PIP.

3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Kaletra is positive.  
The CHMP considers the MAH should submit the first yearly safety review (LEG procedure) focused on 
adverse events in children 14 days to 2 years of age that may suggest toxicity with ethanol or propylene 
glycol within 2 months following EC decision.

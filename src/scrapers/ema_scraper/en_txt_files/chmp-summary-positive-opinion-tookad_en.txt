Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Tookad 
padeliporfin 
On 14 September 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Tookad, 
intended for the treatment of adult patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Tookad is administered 
as part of focal vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP). The applicant for this medicinal product is 
STEBA Biotech S.A. 
Tookad will be available as a powder (183 mg and 366 mg) for solution for injection. The active 
substance of Tookad is padeliporfin, a sensitiser used in photodynamic/radiation therapy (ATC code: 
L01XD07). When activated with laser light, padeliporfin triggers a cascade of pathophysiological events 
resulting in focal necrosis within a few days.  
The benefits with Tookad are its ability to improve the probability of a negative biopsy at 24 months and 
delay disease progression compared with active surveillance (periodic monitoring of known prostate 
cancer). 
The most common side effects are urinary and reproductive system disorders. 
The full indication is: 
“Tookad is indicated as monotherapy for adult patients with previously untreated, unilateral, low-risk, 
adenocarcinoma of the prostate with a life expectancy ≥ 10 years and: 
•  Clinical stage T1c or T2a,  
•  Gleason Score ≤ 6, based on high-resolution biopsy strategies,  
• 
PSA ≤ 10 ng/mL,  
•  3 positive cancer cores with a maximum cancer core length of 5 mm in any one core or 1-2 positive 
cancer cores with ≥ 50% cancer involvement in any one core or a PSA density ≥ 0.15 ng/mL/cm3”  
It is proposed that Tookad be restricted to hospital use only. It should only be used by personnel trained 
in the vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP) procedure.

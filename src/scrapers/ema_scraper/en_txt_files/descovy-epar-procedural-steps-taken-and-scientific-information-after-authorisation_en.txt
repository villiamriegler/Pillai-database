Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC of Descovy, Genvoya and Odefsey with data in 
patients on chronic haemodialysis from the Study 
GS-US-292-1825; this is a Phase 3b Open-Label 
Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, 
Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of E/C/F/TAF Fixed 
Dose Combination (FDC) in HIV-1 Infected Subjects 
on Chronic Haemodialysis. The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. 
In addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took 
the opportunity to remove boceprevir drug-drug 
interaction information in section 4.5 of the SmPC 
since this medicinal product has been withdrawn 
from the EU market, as well as to introduce some 
minor amendments throughout the product 
information of Descovy, Genvoya and Odefsey. The 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
Moreover, the Package Leaflet of Genvoya and 
Odefsey have been updated regarding the lactose 
wording, as per the revised Annex to the European 
Commission guideline on ‘Excipients in the labelling 
in HIV-1 infected adults with end stage renal disease 
(estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis 
were evaluated. There were no new safety issues identified 
in these patients. No clinically relevant differences in 
tenofovir alafenamide pharmacokinetics were observed in 
patients with end stage renal disease on chronic 
haemodialysis as compared to those with normal renal 
function. Efficacy was maintained through 48 weeks but 
emtricitabine exposure was significantly higher than in 
patients with normal renal function. Although there were no 
new safety issues identified, the implications of increased 
emtricitabine exposure remain uncertain.  
Therefore, it is recommended that Descovy, Genvoya and 
Odefsey should generally be avoided but may be used in 
adults with end stage renal disease (estimated CrCl < 15 
mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis if the potential benefits 
are considered to outweigh the potential risks. No dose 
adjustment is required in these patients. Based on this, 
sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC of Descovy, 
Genvoya and Odefsey have been updated accordingly.

DNA < 29 IU/mL using missing = failure analysis at Week 
48.  Of the 62 patients who were HBV suppressed at 
baseline, 59 remained suppressed and 3 had missing data. 
Of the 10 patients who were not HBV suppressed at 
baseline (HBV DNA ≥ 29 IU/mL), 7 became suppressed, 2 
remained detectable, and 1 had missing data.  Alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) normalisation was achieved in 40% 
(4/10) of subjects with ALT greater than upper limit of 
normal (ULN) at baseline. There are limited clinical data on 
the use of E/C/F/TAF in HIV/HBV co infected patients who 
are treatment naïve. 
The safety profile of emtricitabine and tenofovir 
alafenamide in combination with elvitegravir and cobicistat

HIV/HBV co infection, was similar to that in patients with 
HIV 1 monoinfection.

antiretroviral agent (Study GS US 311 1089), increases 
from baseline were observed in the fasting lipid parameters 
total cholesterol, direct low density lipoprotein (LDL) 
cholesterol and triglycerides in the Descovy arm compared 
with little change in the FTC/TDF arm (p ≤ 0.009 for the 
difference between groups in changes from baseline). 
There was little change from baseline in median fasting 
values for high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and 
glucose, or in the fasting total cholesterol to HDL 
cholesterol ratio in either treatment arm at Week 96. None 
of the changes was considered clinically relevant. 
Improvements in bone mineral density were noted through 
96 weeks after switching to Descovy from a tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate (TDF) containing regimen compared to 
minimal changes with maintaining the TDF containing 
regimen as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry 
(DXA) analysis of hip (mean change from baseline of 1.9% 
vs  0.3%, p < 0.001) and lumbar spine (mean change from 
baseline of 2.2% vs  0.2%, p < 0.001).  
Virological outcomes through 96 weeks after switching to 
Descovy from a TDF containing regimen were also 
presented. The percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 
50 c/mL in the FAS was 94.3% for those who switched to 
Descovy (+3rd Agent) and 93.0% for those who remained 
on Truvada  (+3rd Agent),  95% CI: −2.5% to 5.1%), 
indicating non- inferiority at week 48. By week 96, success 
rates were 88.6% and 89.1%, respectively (95% CI: -5.3% 
to 4.4%), again indicating non- inferiority. The results of 
the study are in line with the data generated which

data 
from across all Phase 2 and 3 studies in which 2,396 
patients received Genvoya.  The most frequently reported 
adverse reactions in clinical studies through 144 weeks 
were nausea (11%), diarrhoea (7%), and headache (6%) 
(pooled data from Phase 3 clinical studies GS-US-292-0104 
and GS-US-292-0111 in 866 treatment-naïve adult patients 
receiving Genvoya). 
Cobicistat increases serum creatinine due to inhibition of 
tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting renal 
glomerular function.  In clinical studies of Genvoya, 
increases in serum creatinine occurred by Week 2 of 
treatment and remained stable through 144 weeks.  In 
treatment-naïve patients, a mean change from baseline of 
0.04 ± 0.12 mg/dL (3.5 ± 10.6 μmol/L) was observed after 
144 weeks of treatment.  Mean increases from baseline in 
the Genvoya group were smaller than in the elvitegravir 
150 mg/cobicistat 150 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir 
disoproxil (as fumarate) 245 mg (E/C/F/TDF) group at 
Week 144 (difference −0.04, p < 0.001). 
In studies in treatment naïve patients, increases from 
baseline were observed in both treatment groups for the 
fasting lipid parameters total cholesterol, direct low density 
lipoprotein (LDL)  and high density lipoprotein (HDL) 
cholesterol, and triglycerides at Week 144.  The median 
increase from baseline for those parameters was greater in 
the Genvoya group compared with the E/C/F/TDF group at 
Week 144 (p < 0.001 for the difference between treatment 
groups for fasting total cholesterol, direct LDL  and HDL 
cholesterol, and triglycerides).  The median (Q1, Q3) 
Page 20/27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
change from baseline in total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol 
ratio at Week 144 was 0.2 ( 0.3, 0.7) in the Genvoya group 
and 0.1 ( 0.4, 0.6) in the E/C/F/TDF group (p = 0.006 for 
the difference between treatment groups). 
In a pooled analysis, genotyping was performed on plasma 
HIV 1 isolates from antiretroviral-naïve patients receiving 
Genvoya in Phase 3 studies GS US 292 0104 and GS US 
292 0111 with HIV 1 RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL at confirmed 
virologic failure, Week 144, or time of early study drug 
discontinuation.  Up to Week 144, the development of one 
or more primary elvitegravir, emtricitabine, or tenofovir 
alafenamide resistance-associated mutations was observed 
in HIV 1 isolates from 12 of 22 patients with evaluable 
genotypic data from paired baseline and Genvoya 
treatment-failure isolates (12 of 866 patients [1.4%]) 
compared with 12 of 20 treatment failure isolates from 
patients with evaluable genotypic data in the E/C/F/TDF 
treatment group (12 of 867 patients [1.4%]).  Of the HIV 1 
isolates from 12 patients with resistance development in 
the Genvoya group, the mutations that emerged were 
M184V/I (n = 11) and K65R/N (n = 2) in RT and 
T66T/A/I/V (n = 2), E92Q (n = 4), Q148Q/R (n = 1) and 
N155H (n = 2) in integrase.  Of the HIV 1 isolates from 12 
patients with resistance development in the E/C/F/TDF 
group, the mutations that emerged were M184V/I (n = 9), 
K65R/N (n = 4), and L210W (n = 1) in RT and E92Q/V (n = 
4), and Q148R (n = 2), and N155H/S (n = 3) in integrase.  
Most HIV 1 isolates from patients in both treatment groups 
who developed resistance mutations to elvitegravir 
developed resistance mutations to both emtricitabine and 
elvitegravir. 
Page 21/27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In phenotypic analyses of patients in the final resistance 
analysis population, 7 of 22 patients (32%) had HIV 1 
isolates with reduced susceptibility to elvitegravir in the 
Genvoya group compared with HIV 1 isolates from 7 of 20 
patients (35%) in the E/C/F/TDF group, HIV 1 isolates from 
8 patients (36%) had reduced susceptibility to 
emtricitabine in the Genvoya group compared with HIV 1 
isolates from 7 patients (35%) in the E/C/F/TDF group. One 
patient in the Genvoya group (1 of 22 [4.5%]) and 2 
patients in the E/C/F/TDF group (2 of 20 [10%]) had 
reduced susceptibility to tenofovir. 
Genvoya met the non inferiority criteria demonstrated 
statistical superiority in achieving HIV 1 RNA < 50 
copies/mL when compared to E/C/F/TDF at Week 144.  The 
difference in percentage was 4.2% (95% CI: 0.6% to 
7.8%).   
Changes in measures of bone mineral density 
In studies in treatment naïve patients, Genvoya was 
associated with smaller reductions in bone mineral density 
(BMD) compared to E/C/F/TDF as measured by DXA 
analysis of hip (mean change: −0.8% vs −3.4%, p < 
0.001) and lumbar spine (mean change: −0.9% vs −3.0%, 
p < 0.001) after 144 weeks of treatment.   
Improvements in BMD were noted at 96 weeks after 
switching to Genvoya from a TDF-containing regimen 
compared to maintaining the TDF-containing regimen.

Odefsey: Norgestimate (0.180/0.215/0.250 mg once daily), 
ethinylestradiol (0.025 mg once daily). 
The recommendation concerning their co-administration 
with Descovy is that no dose adjustment of 
norgestimate/ethinylestradiol is required.  Descovy should 
be dosed according to the concomitant antiretroviral in line 
with section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
The recommendation concerning their co-administration 
with Odefsey is that no dose adjustment is required. 
The recommendation concerning the co-administration of a 
hormonal contraceptive with Genvoya is that caution should 
be exercised.  The hormonal contraceptive should contain 
at least 30 µg ethinylestradiol and contain norgestimate as 
the progestagen or patients should use an alternative 
reliable method of contraception. 
The long-term effects of substantial increases in 
progesterone exposure are unknown.  The effect of co 
administration of Genvoya with oral contraceptives

Nucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function 
to a variable degree, which is most pronounced with 
stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine. There have been 
reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV negative infants 
exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside 
analogues; these have predominantly concerned treatment 
with regimens containing zidovudine. The main adverse 
reactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, 
neutropenia) and metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, 
hyperlipasemia). These events have often been transitory. 
Late onset neurological disorders have been reported rarely 
(hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether 
such neurological disorders are transient or permanent is 
currently unknown. These findings should be considered for 
any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who 
present with severe clinical findings of unknown etiology, 
particularly neurologic findings. These findings do not affect 
current national recommendations to use antiretroviral 
therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical 
transmission of HIV. 
If you have taken Genvoya during your pregnancy, your 
doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic 
tests to monitor the development of your child.  In children 
whose mothers took NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit 
from the protection against HIV outweighed the risk of side 
effects.

SmPC and PL 
The MAH has updated section 4.2 of the SmPC to note that 
order to provide additional efficacy and safety data 
for antiretroviral therapy-naive adults from Studies 
GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111 through 96 
weeks of treatment. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly.  
The MAH has also taken the opportunity to update 
the DDI table in Section 4.5 by adding a new 
footnote and removing another to increase clarity. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the 
list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet.

there are limited data available regarding the use of 
Descovy (DVY) in patients with estimated CrCl < 30 
mL/min; previously it stated there was no data. The 
summary of the safety profile in section 4.8 and the 
pharmacodynamic properties in section 5.1 were further 
updated to reflect 96 weeks data from clinical studies of 
treatment-naïve adult patients with Genvoya (GEN). 
Data from GEN clinical studies presented through 96 weeks 
of treatment in ART-naive adults in the current submission 
are consistent with the findings in the original submission.  
At Week 96, GEN was noninferior to Stribild. The efficacy of 
GEN in subgroup analyses revealed no meaningful 
differences in virologic success. The frequency of resistance 
development in ART-naive subjects taking GEN was 
acceptably low and comparable to that of the STB group 
through 96 weeks of treatment. Treatment with GEN 
continued to be well tolerated, as demonstrated by the 
incidence of SAEs considered related to study drug, or 
study drug discontinuation due to AEs. No new ADRs were 
identified. Based on the demonstrated bioequivalence 
between FTC/TAF from Genvoya and Descovy these results 
demonstrate that DVY is beneficial as a chronic treatment 
for ART-naive subjects.

to interactions with CYP 2A6, 2C19, and 2E1, 
CYP2B6, 2C9/C8 and 2D6 and antidiabetics 
(tolbutamide).The Package Leaflet is updated in 
accordance. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
vitro data indicate that ketoconazole is an inhibitor of 
CYP1A2 and does not significantly inhibit CYP 2A6, 2C19, 
and 2E1. At clinically relevant concentrations inhibition of 
CYP2B6, 2C9/C8, and 2D6 by ketoconazole cannot be 
excluded. In addition, table 1 (interactions and 
recommendations for co-administration) is updated 
regarding co-administration with tolbutamide, to 
recommend careful monitoring and possible need for dose 
adjustment, due to an expected increase in tolbutamide 
exposure (1.7 fold).

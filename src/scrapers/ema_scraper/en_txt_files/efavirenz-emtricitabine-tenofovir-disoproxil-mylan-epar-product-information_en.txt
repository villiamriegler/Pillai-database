CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is a fixed-dose combination of efavirenz, 
emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil. It is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency 
virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in adults aged 18 years and over with virologic suppression to HIV-1 RNA 
levels of < 50 copies/ml on their current combination antiretroviral therapy for more than three 
months. Patients must not have experienced virological failure on any prior antiretroviral therapy and 
must be known not to have harboured virus strains with mutations conferring significant resistance to 
any of the three components contained in Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan prior to 
initiation of their first antiretroviral treatment regimen (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
The demonstration of the benefit of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is primarily based on 
48-week data from a clinical study in which patients with stable virologic suppression on a 
combination antiretroviral therapy changed to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (see 
section 5.1). No data are currently available from clinical studies with 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in treatment-naïve or in heavily pretreated patients. 
No data are available to support the combination of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil and 
other antiretroviral agents 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection. 
Posology

Adults 
The recommended dose of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is one tablet taken 
orally once daily. 
If a patient misses a dose of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan within 12 hours of 
the time it is usually taken, the patient should take Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Mylan as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule. If a patient misses a dose of 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan by more than 12 hours and it is almost time for 
the next dose, the patient should not take the missed dose and simply resume the usual dosing 
schedule. 
If the patient vomits within 1 hour of taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, 
another tablet should be taken. If the patient vomits more than 1 hour after taking 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan he/she does not need to take another dose. 
It is recommended that Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan be taken on an empty 
stomach since food may increase efavirenz exposure and may lead to an increase in the frequency of 
adverse reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). In order to improve the tolerability to efavirenz with 
respect to undesirable effects on the nervous system, bedtime dosing is recommended (see section 
4.8). 
It is anticipated that tenofovir exposure (AUC) will be approximately 30% lower following 
administration of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan on an empty stomach as 
compared to the individual component tenofovir disoproxil when taken with food (see section 5.2). 
Data on the clinical translation of the decrease in pharmacokinetic exposure are not available. In 
virologically suppressed patients, the clinical relevance of this reduction can be expected to be limited 
(see section 5.1).  
Where discontinuation of therapy with one of the components of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Mylan is indicated or where dose modification is necessary, separate preparations of 
efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil are available. Please refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics for these medicinal products. 
If therapy with Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is discontinued, consideration 
should be given to the long half-life of efavirenz (see section 5.2) and long intracellular half-lives of 
emtricitabine and tenofovir. Because of interpatient variability in these parameters and concerns 
regarding development of resistance, HIV treatment guidelines should be consulted, also taking into 
consideration the reason for discontinuation. 
Dose adjustment  
If Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is co-administered with rifampicin to patients 
weighing 50 kg or more, an additional 200 mg/day (800 mg total) of efavirenz may be considered (see 
section 4.5). 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should be administered with caution to elderly 
patients (see section 4.4). 
Renal impairment 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is not recommended for patients with moderate 
or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 50 ml/min). Patients with moderate or 
severe renal impairment require dose interval adjustment of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil 
that cannot be achieved with the combination tablet (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil have not been studied in 
patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with mild liver disease (Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT), Class 
A) may be treated with the normal recommended dose of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Mylan (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2). Patients should be monitored carefully for adverse 
reactions, especially nervous system symptoms related to efavirenz (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
If Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is discontinued in patients co-infected with 
HIV and HBV, these patients should be closely monitored for evidence of exacerbation of hepatitis 
(see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in children under the age of 
18 years have not been established (see section 5.2). 
Method of administration 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan tablets should be swallowed whole with water, 
once daily. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Severe hepatic impairment (CPT, Class C) (see section 5.2). 
Co-administration with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, 
or ergot alkaloids (for example, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine). 
Competition for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 by efavirenz could result in inhibition of metabolism 
and create the potential for serious and/or life-threatening adverse reactions (for example, cardiac 
arrhythmias, prolonged sedation or respiratory depression) (see section 4.5). 
Co administration with elbasvir/grazoprevir due to the expected significant decreases in plasma 
concentrations of elbasvir and grazoprevir. This effect is due to induction of CYP3A4 or P-gp by 
efavirenz and may result in loss of therapeutic effect of elbasvir/grazoprevir (see section 4.5). 
Co-administration with voriconazole. Efavirenz significantly decreases voriconazole plasma 
concentrations while voriconazole also significantly increases efavirenz plasma concentrations. Since 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is a fixed-dose combination product, the dose of 
efavirenz cannot be altered (see section 4.5). 
Co-administration with herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) due to 
the risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of efavirenz (see section 4.5). 
Administration to patients with: 
- 
- 
a family history of sudden death or of congenital prolongation of the QTc interval on 
electrocardiograms, or with any other clinical condition known to prolong the QTc interval. 
a history of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias or with clinically relevant bradycardia or with 
congestive cardiac failure accompanied by reduced left ventricle ejection fraction. 
4 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
severe disturbances of electrolyte balance e.g. hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. 
Co-administration with medicinal products that are known to prolong the QTc interval 
(proarrhythmic).  
These medicinal products include: 
- 
- 
- 
antiarrhythmics of classes IA and III, 
neuroleptics, antidepressive agents, 
certain antibiotics including some agents of the following classes: macrolides, 
fluoroquinolones, imidazole and triazole antifungal agents, 
certain non-sedating antihistamines (terfenadine, astemizole), 
cisapride, 
flecainide, 
certain antimalarials,  
- 
- 
- 
- 
-  methadone (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Co-administration with other medicinal products 
As a fixed combination, efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should not be administered 
concomitantly with other medicinal products containing the same active components, emtricitabine or 
tenofovir disoproxil. Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should not be co-administered with 
products containing efavirenz unless needed for dose adjustment e.g. with rifampicin (see section 4.2). 
Due to similarities with emtricitabine, efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should not be 
administered concomitantly with other cytidine analogues, such as lamivudine (see section 4.5). 
Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir 
dipivoxil or with medicinal products containing tenofovir alafenamide. 
Co-administration of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not recommended 
(see section 4.5).  
Co-administration of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir is not recommended since plasma concentrations of velpatasvir 
and voxilaprevir are expected to decrease following co-administration with efavirenz leading to 
reduced therapeutic effect of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (see section 
4.5). 
No data are available on the safety and efficacy of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in 
combination with other antiretroviral agents. 
Concomitant use of Ginkgo biloba extracts is not recommended (see section 4.5).  
Switching from a Protease Inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral regimen 
Currently available data indicate a trend that in patients on a PI-based antiretroviral regimen the 
switch to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil may lead to a reduction of the response to the 
therapy (see section 5.1). These patients should be carefully monitored for rises in viral load and, 
since the safety profile of efavirenz differs from that of protease inhibitors, for adverse reactions. 
Opportunistic infections 
Patients receiving efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil or any other antiretroviral therapy may 
continue to develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection, and therefore 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
should remain under close clinical observation by physicians experienced in the treatment of patients 
with HIV associated diseases. 
Effect of food 
The administration of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil with food may increase efavirenz 
exposure (see section 5.2) and may lead to an increase in frequency of adverse reactions (see section 
4.8). It is recommended that efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil be taken on an empty 
stomach, preferably at bedtime. 
Liver disease 
The pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil have not 
been established in patients with significant underlying liver disorders (see section 5.2). 
Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (see section 4.3) and not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. 
Since efavirenz is principally metabolised by the CYP system, caution should be exercised in 
administering efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil to patients with mild hepatic impairment. 
These patients should be carefully monitored for efavirenz adverse reactions, especially nervous 
system symptoms. Laboratory tests should be performed to evaluate their liver disease at periodic 
intervals (see section 4.2). 
Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction including chronic active hepatitis have an increased 
frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) and 
should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease or 
persistent elevations of serum transaminases to greater than 5 times the upper limit of the normal 
range, the benefit of continued therapy with efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil needs to be 
weighed against the potential risks of significant liver toxicity. In such patients, interruption or 
discontinuation of treatment must be considered (see section 4.8).  
In patients treated with other medicinal products associated with liver toxicity, monitoring of liver 
enzymes is also recommended. 
Hepatic events 
Post-marketing reports of hepatic failure also occurred in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease 
or other identifiable risk factors (see section 4.8). Liver enzyme monitoring should be considered for 
all patients independent of pre-existing hepatic dysfunction or other risk factors. 
Patients with HIV and hepatitis B (HBV) or C virus (HCV) co-infection 
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with CART are at an increased risk for severe and 
potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. 
Physicians should refer to current HIV treatment guidelines for the optimal management of HIV 
infection in patients co-infected with HBV. 
In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant Summary 
of Product Characteristics for these medicinal products. 
The safety and efficacy of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil have not been studied for the 
treatment of chronic HBV infection. Emtricitabine and tenofovir individually and in combination have 
shown activity against HBV in pharmacodynamic studies (see section 5.1). Limited clinical 
experience suggests that emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil have an anti-HBV activity when used 
in antiretroviral combination therapy to control HIV infection. Discontinuation of 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil therapy in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV may 
be associated with severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis. Patients co-infected with HIV and HBV 
who discontinue efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil must be closely monitored with both 
clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least four months after stopping treatment with 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil. If appropriate, resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy 
may be warranted. In patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is 
not recommended since post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation. 
QTc prolongation 
QTc prolongation has been observed with the use of efavirenz (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). For patients 
at increased risk of Torsade de Pointes or who are receiving medicinal products with a known risk for 
Torsade de Pointes, consider alternatives to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil. 
Psychiatric symptoms 
Psychiatric adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with efavirenz. Patients with a 
prior history of psychiatric disorders appear to be at greater risk of serious psychiatric adverse 
reactions. In particular, severe depression was more common in those with a history of depression. 
There have also been post-marketing reports of severe depression, death by suicide, delusions, 
psychosis-like behaviour, and catatonia. Patients should be advised that if they experience symptoms 
such as severe depression, psychosis or suicidal ideation, they should contact their doctor immediately 
to assess the possibility that the symptoms may be related to the use of efavirenz, and if so, to 
determine whether the risk of continued therapy outweighs the benefits (see section 4.8). 
Nervous system symptoms 
Symptoms including, but not limited to, dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, impaired concentration and 
abnormal dreaming are frequently reported undesirable effects in patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg 
daily in clinical studies. Dizziness was also seen in clinical studies with emtricitabine and tenofovir 
disoproxil. Headache has been reported in clinical studies with emtricitabine (see section 4.8). 
Nervous system symptoms associated with efavirenz usually begin during the first one or two days of 
therapy and generally resolve after the first two to four weeks. Patients should be informed that if they 
do occur, these common symptoms are likely to improve with continued therapy and are not 
predictive of subsequent onset of any of the less frequent psychiatric symptoms. 
Seizures 
Convulsions have been observed in patients receiving efavirenz, generally in the presence of a known 
medical history of seizures. Patients who are receiving concomitant anticonvulsant medicinal products 
primarily metabolised by the liver, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital, may require 
periodic monitoring of plasma levels. In a medicinal product interaction study, carbamazepine plasma 
concentrations were decreased when carbamazepine was co-administered with efavirenz (see section 
4.5). Caution must be taken in any patient with a history of seizures. 
Renal impairment 
Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe 
renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min). Patients with moderate or severe renal 
impairment require a dose adjustment of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil that cannot be 
achieved with the combination tablet (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Use of 
Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a 
nephrotoxic medicinal product. If concomitant use of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil and 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
nephrotoxic agents (e.g. aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, 
vancomycin, cidofovir, interleukin-2) is unavoidable, renal function must be monitored weekly (see 
section 4.5).  
Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported in patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil and with risk factors 
for renal dysfunction. If efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is co-administered with an 
NSAID, renal function should be monitored adequately.  
Renal failure, renal impairment, elevated creatinine, hypophosphataemia and proximal tubulopathy 
(including Fanconi syndrome) have been reported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil in clinical 
practice (see section 4.8). 
It is recommended that creatinine clearance is calculated in all patients prior to initiating therapy with 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil and renal function (creatinine clearance and serum 
phosphate) is also monitored after two to four weeks of treatment, after three months of treatment and 
every three to six months thereafter in patients without renal risk factors. In patients with a history of 
renal dysfunction or in patients who are at risk of renal dysfunction, a more frequent monitoring of 
renal function is required. 
If serum phosphate is < 1.5 mg/dl (0.48 mmol/l) or creatinine clearance is decreased to < 50 ml/min in 
any patient receiving efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil, renal function must be re-evaluated 
within one week, including measurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose 
concentrations (see section 4.8, proximal tubulopathy). Since efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil is a combination product and the dosing interval of the individual components cannot be 
altered, treatment with efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil must be interrupted in patients 
with confirmed creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min or decreases in serum phosphate to < 1.0 mg/dl 
(0.32 mmol/l). Interrupting treatment with efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should also be 
considered in case of progressive decline of renal function when no other cause has been identified. 
Where discontinuation of therapy with one of the components of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil is indicated or where dose modification is necessary, separate preparations of efavirenz, 
emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil are available. 
Bone effects 
Bone abnormalities such as osteomalacia which can manifest as persistent or worsening bone pain 
and, which can infrequently contribute to fractures may be associated with tenofovir disoproxil-
induced proximal renal tubulopathy (see section 4.8). 
Tenofovir disoproxil may also cause a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD). In HIV infected 
patients, in a 144-week controlled clinical study (GS-99-903) that compared tenofovir disoproxil with 
stavudine in combination with lamivudine and efavirenz in antiretroviral-naïve adult patients, small 
decreases in BMD of the hip and spine were observed in both treatment groups. Decreases in BMD of 
spine and changes in bone biomarkers from baseline were significantly greater in the tenofovir 
disoproxil treatment group at 144 weeks. Decreases in BMD of the hip were significantly greater in 
this group until 96 weeks. However, there was no increased risk of fractures or evidence for clinically 
relevant bone abnormalities over 144 weeks in this study. 
In other studies (prospective and cross-sectional), the most pronounced decreases in BMD were seen 
in patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil as part of a regimen containing a boosted protease 
inhibitor. Overall, in view of the bone abnormalities associated with tenofovir disoproxil and the 
limitations of long-term data on the impact of tenofovir disoproxil on bone health and fracture risk, 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
alternative treatment regimens should be considered for patients with osteoporosis that are at a high 
risk for fractures.  
If bone abnormalities are suspected or detected then appropriate consultation should be obtained. 
Skin reactions 
Mild-to-moderate rash has been reported with the individual components of 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil. The rash associated with the efavirenz component 
usually resolves with continued therapy. Appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may 
improve tolerability and hasten the resolution of rash. Severe rash associated with blistering, moist 
desquamation or ulceration has been reported in less than 1% of patients treated with efavirenz (see 
section 4.8). The incidence of erythema multiforme or Stevens-Johnson syndrome was approximately 
0.1%. Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil must be discontinued in patients developing severe 
rash associated with blistering, desquamation, mucosal involvement or fever. Experience with 
efavirenz in patients who discontinued other antiretroviral agents of the non-nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) class is limited. Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is not 
recommended for patients who have had a life-threatening cutaneous reaction (e.g., Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome) while taking an NNRTI. 
Weight and metabolic parameters 
An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral 
therapy. Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in 
some cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating 
this to any particular treatment. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to 
established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero 
Nucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most 
pronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine. There have been reports of mitochondrial 
dysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; 
these have predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine. The main 
adverse reactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic 
disorders (hyperlactataemia, hyperlipasaemia). These events have often been transitory. Late onset 
neurological disorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). 
Whether such neurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown. These findings 
should be considered for any child exposed in utero to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with 
severe clinical findings of unknown etiology, particularly neurologic findings. These findings do not 
affect current national recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent 
vertical transmission of HIV. 
Immune reactivation syndrome 
In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an 
inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause 
serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed 
within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus 
retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. 
Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to 
occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and 
these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 
Osteonecrosis 
Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol 
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been 
reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART. 
Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint 
stiffness or difficulty in movement. 
Patients with HIV-1 harbouring mutations 
Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided in patients with HIV-1 harbouring the 
K65R, M184V/I or K103N mutation (see sections 4.1 and 5.1). 
Elderly 
Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil has not been studied in patients over the age of 65. 
Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic or renal function, therefore caution should 
be exercised when treating elderly patients with efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (see 
section 4.2). 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains 7.5 mg of sodium metabisulfite per dose, which may rarely cause 
severe hypersensitivity reactions and bronchospasm.  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.  
This medicinal product contains 105.5 mg of lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of 
galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this 
medicinal product.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
As Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan contains efavirenz, emtricitabine and 
tenofovir disoproxil, any interactions that have been identified with these agents individually may 
occur with Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. Interaction studies with these agents 
have only been performed in adults. 
As a fixed combination, efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should not be administered 
concomitantly with other medicinal products containing the components, emtricitabine or tenofovir 
disoproxil. Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should not be co-administered with products 
containing efavirenz unless needed for dose adjustment e.g. with rifampicin (see section 4.2). Due to 
similarities with emtricitabine, efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should not be 
administered concomitantly with other cytidine analogues, such as lamivudine. 
Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should not be administered concomitantly with adefovir 
dipivoxil or with medicinal products containing tenofovir alafenamide. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Efavirenz is an in vivo inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and UGT1A1. Compounds that are substrates of 
these enzymes may have decreased plasma concentrations when co-administered with efavirenz. 
Efavirenz may be an inducer of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9; however, inhibition has also been observed 
in vitro and the net effect of co-administration with substrates of these enzymes is not clear (see 
section 5.2). 
Co-administration of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil with metamizole, which is an 
inducer of metabolising enzymes including CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 may cause a reduction in plasma 
concentrations of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil with potential decrease in clinical 
efficacy. Therefore, caution is advised when metamizole and efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil are administered concurrently; clinical response and/or medicinal product levels should be 
monitored as appropriate. 
Efavirenz exposure may be increased when given with medicinal products (for example ritonavir) or 
food (for example, grapefruit juice) which inhibit CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 activity. Compounds or herbal 
preparations (for example Ginkgo biloba extracts and St. John's wort) which induce these enzymes 
may give rise to decreased plasma concentrations of efavirenz. Concomitant use of St. John's wort is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). Concomitant use of Ginkgo biloba extracts is not recommended (see 
section 4.4). 
In vitro and clinical pharmacokinetic interaction studies have shown the potential for CYP-mediated 
interactions involving emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil with other medicinal products is low. 
Cannabinoid test interaction 
Efavirenz does not bind to cannabinoid receptors. False-positive urine cannabinoid test results have 
been reported with some screening assays in uninfected and HIV infected subjects receiving 
efavirenz. Confirmatory testing by a more specific method such as gas chromatography/mass 
spectrometry is recommended in such cases. 
Contraindications of concomitant use 
Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil must not be administered concurrently with terfenadine, 
astemizole, cisapride, midazolam, triazolam, pimozide, bepridil, or ergot alkaloids (for example, 
ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine), since inhibition of their 
metabolism may lead to serious, life-threatening events (see section 4.3). 
Elbasvir/grazoprevir: Co administration of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil with 
elbasvir/grazoprevir is contraindicated because it may lead to loss of virologic response to 
elbasvir/grazoprevir (see section 4.3 and Table 1). 
Voriconazole: Co-administration of standard doses of efavirenz and voriconazole is contraindicated. 
Since efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is a fixed-dose combination product, the dose of 
efavirenz cannot be altered; therefore, voriconazole and efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil 
must not be co-administered (see section 4.3 and Table 1). 
St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum): Co-administration of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil and St. John's wort or herbal preparations containing St. John's wort is contraindicated. 
Plasma levels of efavirenz can be reduced by concomitant use of St. John's wort due to induction of 
medicinal product metabolising enzymes and/or transport proteins by St. John's wort. If a patient is 
already taking St. John's wort, stop St. John's wort, check viral levels and if possible efavirenz levels. 
Efavirenz levels may increase on stopping St. John's wort. The inducing effect of St. John's wort may 
persist for at least 2 weeks after cessation of treatment (see section 4.3).

QT Prolonging medicinal products: efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is contraindicated 
with concomitant use of medicinal products that are known to prolong the QTc interval and could lead 
to Torsade de Pointes, such as: antiarrhythmics of classes IA and III, neuroleptics and antidepressant 
agents, certain antibiotics including some agents of the following classes: macrolides, 
fluoroquinolones, imidazole, and triazole antifungal agents, certain non-sedating antihistaminics 
(terfenadine, astemizole), cisapride, flecainide, certain antimalarials and methadone (see section 4.3). 
Concomitant use not recommended 
Atazanavir/ritonavir: Insufficient data are available to make a dosing recommendation for 
atazanavir/ritonavir in combination with efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil. Therefore co-
administration of atazanavir/ritonavir and efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is not 
recommended (see Table 1). 
Didanosine: Co-administration of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not 
recommended (see Table 1). 
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir: Co-administration of 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir is not recommended (see section 4.4 and Table 1). 
Praziquantel: Concomitant use of efavirenz with praziquantel is not recommended due to significant 
decrease in plasma concentrations of praziquantel, with risk of treatment failure due to increased 
hepatic metabolism by efavirenz. In case the combination is needed, an increased dose of praziquantel 
could be considered. 
Renally eliminated medicinal products: Since emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily eliminated by 
the kidneys, co-administration of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil with medicinal products 
that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion (e.g. cidofovir) may increase serum 
concentrations of emtricitabine, tenofovir and/or the co-administered medicinal products. 
Use of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of 
a nephrotoxic medicinal product. Some examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, 
amphotericin B, foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2 (see 
section 4.4).

Due to the similarity between 
lamivudine and emtricitabine, a 
component of 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil, 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil should not be administered 
concomitantly with lamivudine (see 
section 4.4).  
Since use of two NNRTIs proved not 
beneficial in terms of efficacy and 
safety, co-administration of 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil and another NNRTI is not 
recommended.  
Co-administration of 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil and didanosine is not 
recommended.  
Increased systemic exposure to 
didanosine may increase didanosine 
related adverse reactions. Rarely, 
pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, 
sometimes fatal, have been reported. 
Co-administration of tenofovir 
disoproxil and didanosine at a dose of 
400 mg daily has been associated 
with a significant decrease in CD4

disoproxil (efavirenz 600 mg, 
emtricitabine 200 mg, tenofovir 
disoproxil 245 mg) 
phosphorylated (i.e. active) 
didanosine. A decreased dose of 
250 mg didanosine co-administered 
with tenofovir disoproxil therapy has 
been associated with reports of high 
rates of virological failure within 
several tested combinations for the 
treatment of HIV-1 infection. 
Co administration of 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil with elbasvir/grazoprevir 
is contraindicated because it may lead 
to loss of virologic response to 
elbasvir/grazoprevir. This loss is due 
to significant decreases in 
elbasvir/grazoprevir plasma 
concentrations caused by CYP3A4 or 
P gp induction.  Refer to the 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
for elbasvir/grazoprevir for more 
information. 
Concomitant administration of 
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir with 
efavirenz, a component of 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil, may significantly decrease 
plasma concentrations of glecaprevir 
and pibrentasvir, leading to reduced 
therapeutic effect. Coadministration 
of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir with

The daily dose of rifabutin should be

rifabutin dose in regimens where 
rifabutin is given 2 or 3 times a week 
in combination with

tolerability and virological response 
should be considered when making 
the dose adjustment (see section 5.2). 
When

patients weighing 50 kg or greater, an 
additional 200 mg/day (800 mg total) 
of efavirenz may provide exposure 
similar to a daily efavirenz dose of 
600 mg when taken without 
rifampicin. The clinical effect of this

There were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions when efavirenz was administered 
with azithromycin, cetirizine, fosamprenavir/ritonavir, lorazepam, zidovudine, aluminium/magnesium 
hydroxide antacids, famotidine or fluconazole. The potential for interactions with efavirenz and other 
azole antifungals, such as ketoconazole, has not been studied. 
There were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions when emtricitabine was 
administered with stavudine, zidovudine or famciclovir. There were no clinically significant 
pharmacokinetic interactions when tenofovir disoproxil was co-administered with emtricitabine, or 
ribavirin. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential (see below and section 5.3) 
Pregnancy should be avoided in women receiving efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil. 
Women of childbearing potential should undergo pregnancy testing before initiation of 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil. 
Contraception in males and females 
Barrier contraception should always be used in combination with other methods of contraception (for 
example, oral or other hormonal contraceptives, see section 4.5) while on therapy with 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil. Because of the long half-life of efavirenz, use of 
adequate contraceptive measures for 12 weeks after discontinuation of 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is recommended.  
Pregnancy 
Efavirenz: There have been seven retrospective reports of findings consistent with neural tube defects, 
including meningomyelocele, all in mothers exposed to efavirenz-containing regimens (excluding any 
efavirenz-containing fixed-dose combination tablets) in the first trimester. Two additional cases (1 
prospective and 1 retrospective) including events consistent with neural tube defects have been 
reported with the fixed-dose combination tablet containing efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir 
disoproxil. A causal relationship of these events to the use of efavirenz has not been established, and 
the denominator is unknown. As neural tube defects occur within the first 4 weeks of foetal 
development (at which time neural tubes are sealed), this potential risk would concern women 
exposed to efavirenz during the first trimester of pregnancy.  
As of July 2013, the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) has received prospective reports of 
904 pregnancies with first trimester exposure to efavirenz-containing regimens, resulting in 766 live 
births. One child was reported to have a neural tube defect, and the frequency and pattern of other 
birth defects were similar to those seen in children exposed to non-efavirenz-containing regimens, as 
well as those in HIV negative controls. The incidence of neural tube defects in the general population 
ranges from 0.5-1 case per 1,000 live births.  
Malformations have been observed in foetuses from efavirenz-treated monkeys (see section 5.3).  
Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil: A large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 
1,000 pregnancy outcomes) indicates no malformations or foetal/neonatal toxicity associated with 
emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil. Animal studies on emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil do 
not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical 
condition of the woman requires treatment with efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil. 
Breast-feeding 
Efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir have been shown to be excreted in human milk. There is 
insufficient information on the effects of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir in newborns/infants. A 
risk to the infants cannot be excluded. Therefore efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should 
not be used during breast-feeding. 
It is recommended that women living with HIV do not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid 
transmission of HIV. 
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil are available. Animal 
studies do not indicate harmful effects of efavirenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, 
dizziness has been reported during treatment with efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil. 
Efavirenz may also cause impaired concentration and/or somnolence. Patients should be instructed 
that if they experience these symptoms they should avoid potentially hazardous tasks such as driving 
and operating machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil has been studied in 460 patients 
either as the fixed-dose combination tablet efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (study 
AI266073) or as the component products (study GS-01-934). Adverse reactions were generally 
consistent with those seen in previous studies of the individual components. The most frequently 
reported adverse reactions considered possibly or probably related to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil among patients treated up to 48 weeks in study AI266073 were psychiatric disorders 
(16%), nervous system disorders (13%), and gastrointestinal disorders (7%). 
Severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme; neuropsychiatric 
adverse reactions (including severe depression, death by suicide, psychosis-like behaviour, seizures); 
severe hepatic events; pancreatitis and lactic acidosis (sometimes fatal) have been reported. 
Rare events of renal impairment, renal failure and uncommon events of proximal renal tubulopathy 
(including Fanconi syndrome) sometimes leading to bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to 
fractures) have also been reported. Monitoring of renal function is recommended for patients 
receiving efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (see section 4.4). 
Discontinuation of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil therapy in patients co-infected with 
HIV and HBV may be associated with severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis (see section 4.4). 
The administration of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil with food may increase efavirenz 
exposure and may lead to an increase in the frequency of adverse reactions (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

Common  
1 Anaemia was common and skin discolouration (increased pigmentation) was very common when emtricitabine was 
administered to paediatric patients. 
2 This adverse reaction may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy. It is not considered to be causally 
associated with tenofovir disoproxil in the absence of this condition. 
3 See section 4.8 Description of selected adverse reactions for more details. 
4 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance for either efavirenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir 
disoproxil. The frequency category was estimated from a statistical calculation based on the total number of patients treated 
with efavirenz in clinical studies (n = 3,969) or exposed to emtricitabine in randomised controlled clinical studies (n = 1,563) 
or exposed to tenofovir disoproxil in randomised controlled clinical studies and the expanded access programme (n = 7,319). 
pain, asthenia 
asthenia  
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Rash: In clinical studies of efavirenz, rashes were usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin 
eruptions that occurred within the first two weeks of initiating therapy with efavirenz. In most patients 
rash resolved with continuing therapy with efavirenz within one month. 
Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil can be reinitiated in patients interrupting therapy because 
of rash. Use of appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids is recommended when 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is restarted. 
Psychiatric symptoms: Patients with a history of psychiatric disorders appear to be at greater risk of 
serious psychiatric adverse reactions listed in the efavirenz column of Table 2. 
Nervous system symptoms: Nervous system symptoms are common with efavirenz, one of the 
components of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil. In clinical controlled studies of efavirenz, 
nervous system symptoms of moderate to severe intensity were experienced by 19% (severe 2%) of 
patients, and 2% of patients discontinued therapy due to such symptoms. They usually begin during 
the first one or two days of efavirenz therapy and generally resolve after the first two to four weeks. 
They may occur more frequently when efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is taken 
concomitantly with meals possibly due to increased efavirenz plasma levels (see section 5.2). Dosing 
at bedtime seems to improve the tolerability of these symptoms (see section 4.2). 
Hepatic failure with efavirenz: Hepatic failure, including cases in patients with no pre-existing hepatic 
disease or other identifiable risk factors, as reported post-marketing, were sometimes characterised by 
a fulminant course, progressing in some cases to transplantation or death.  
37 
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment: As efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil may cause renal damage, 
monitoring of renal function is recommended (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 Summary of the safety 
profile). Proximal renal tubulopathy generally resolved or improved after tenofovir disoproxil 
discontinuation. However, in some patients, declines in creatinine clearance did not completely 
resolve despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation. Patients at risk of renal impairment (such as 
patients with baseline renal risk factors, advanced HIV disease, or patients receiving concomitant 
nephrotoxic medicinal products) are at increased risk of experiencing incomplete recovery of renal 
function despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation (see section 4.4).  
Lactic acidosis: Cases of lactic acidosis have been reported with tenofovir disoproxil alone or in 
combination with other antiretrovirals. Patients with predisposing factors such as severe hepatic 
impairment (CPT, Class C) (see section 4.3), or patients receiving concomitant medicinal products 
known to induce lactic acidosis are at increased risk of experiencing severe lactic acidosis during 
tenofovir disoproxil treatment, including fatal outcomes. 
Metabolic parameters: Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during 
antiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4). 
Immune Reactivation Syndrome: In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time 
of initiation of CART, an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections 
may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been 
reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many 
months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). 
Osteonecrosis: Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally 
acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART. The frequency of 
this is unknown (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
Insufficient safety data are available for children below 18 years of age. 
Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in this population (see section 4.2). 
Other special populations 
Elderly: efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil has not been studied in patients over the age of 
65. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic or renal function, therefore caution 
should be exercised when treating elderly patients with efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil 
(see section 4.2).  
Patients with renal impairment: Since tenofovir disoproxil can cause renal toxicity, close monitoring 
of renal function is recommended in any patient with mild renal impairment treated with 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). 
HIV/HBV or HCV co-infected patients: Only a limited number of patients were co-infected with HBV 
( = 13) or HCV (n = 26) in study GS-01-934. The adverse reaction profile of efavirenz, emtricitabine 
and tenofovir disoproxil in patients co-infected with HIV/HBV or HIV/HCV was similar to that 
observed in patients infected with HIV without co-infection. However, as would be expected in this 
patient population, elevations in AST and ALT occurred more frequently than in the general HIV 
infected population. 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Exacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment: In HIV infected patients co-infected 
with HBV, clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatitis may occur after discontinuation of treatment 
(see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V  
4.9  Overdose 
Some patients accidentally taking 600 mg efavirenz twice daily have reported increased nervous 
system symptoms. One patient experienced involuntary muscle contractions. 
If overdose occurs, the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8), and 
standard supportive treatment applied as necessary. 
Administration of activated charcoal may be used to aid removal of unabsorbed efavirenz. There is no 
specific antidote for overdose with efavirenz. Since efavirenz is highly protein bound, dialysis is 
unlikely to remove significant quantities of it from blood. 
Up to 30% of the emtricitabine dose and approximately 10% of the tenofovir dose can be removed by 
haemodialysis. It is not known whether emtricitabine or tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal 
dialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use, antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, 
combinations, ATC code: J05AR06. 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
Efavirenz is an NNRTI of HIV-1. Efavirenz non-competitively inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase 
(RT) and does not significantly inhibit human immunodeficiency virus-2 (HIV-2) RT or cellular 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerases (α, β, γ, and δ). Emtricitabine is a nucleoside analogue of 
cytidine. Tenofovir disoproxil is converted in vivo to tenofovir, a nucleoside monophosphate 
(nucleotide) analogue of adenosine monophosphate. 
Emtricitabine and tenofovir are phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine 
triphosphate and tenofovir diphosphate, respectively. In vitro studies have shown that both 
emtricitabine and tenofovir can be fully phosphorylated when combined together in cells. 
Emtricitabine triphosphate and tenofovir diphosphate competitively inhibit HIV-1 reverse 
transcriptase, resulting in DNA chain termination. 
Both emtricitabine triphosphate and tenofovir diphosphate are weak inhibitors of mammalian DNA 
polymerases and there was no evidence of toxicity to mitochondria in vitro and in vivo.

The effect of efavirenz on the QTc interval was evaluated in an open-label, positive and placebo 
controlled, fixed single sequence 3-period, 3-treatment crossover QT study in 58 healthy subjects 
enriched for CYP2B6 polymorphisms. The mean Cmax of efavirenz in subjects with CYP2B6 *6/*6 
genotype following the administration of 600 mg daily dose for 14 days was 2.25-fold the mean Cmax 
observed in subjects with CYP2B6 *1/*1 genotype. A positive relationship between efavirenz 
concentration and QTc prolongation was observed. Based on the concentration-QTc relationship, the 
mean QTc prolongation and its upper bound 90% confidence interval are 8.7 ms and 11.3 ms in 
subjects with CYP2B6*6/*6 genotype following the administration of 600 mg daily dose for 14 days 
(see section 4.5). 
Antiviral activity in vitro 
Efavirenz demonstrated antiviral activity against most non-clade B isolates (subtypes A, AE, AG, C, 
D, F, G, J, and N) but had reduced antiviral activity against group O viruses. Emtricitabine displayed 
antiviral activity against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Tenofovir displayed antiviral activity 
against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and O. Both emtricitabine and tenofovir showed strain 
specific activity against HIV-2 and antiviral activity against HBV. 
In combination studies evaluating the in vitro antiviral activity of efavirenz and emtricitabine 
together, efavirenz and tenofovir together, and emtricitabine and tenofovir together, additive to 
synergistic antiviral effects were observed. 
Resistance 
Resistance to efavirenz can be selected in vitro and resulted in single or multiple amino acid 
substitutions in HIV-1 RT, including L100I, V108I, V179D, and Y181C. K103N was the most 
frequently observed RT substitution in viral isolates from patients who experienced rebound in viral 
load during clinical studies of efavirenz. Substitutions at RT positions 98, 100, 101, 108, 138, 188, 
190 or 225 were also observed, but at lower frequencies, and often only in combination with K103N. 
Cross-resistance profiles for efavirenz, nevirapine and delavirdine in vitro demonstrated that the 
K103N substitution confers loss of susceptibility to all three NNRTIs. 
The potential for cross-resistance between efavirenz and NRTIs is low because of the different 
binding sites on the target and mechanism of action. The potential for cross-resistance between 
efavirenz and PIs is low because of the different enzyme targets involved. 
Resistance to emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil has been seen in vitro and in some HIV-1 infected 
patients due to the development of an M184V or M184I substitution in RT with emtricitabine or a 
K65R substitution in RT with tenofovir disoproxil. Emtricitabine-resistant viruses with the M184V/I 
mutation were cross-resistant to lamivudine, but retained sensitivity to didanosine, stavudine, 
tenofovir disoproxil and zidovudine. The K65R mutation can also be selected by abacavir or 
didanosine and results in reduced susceptibility to these agents plus lamivudine, emtricitabine and 
tenofovir disoproxil. Tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided in patients with HIV-1 harbouring the 
K65R mutation. Both the K65R and M184V/I mutation remain fully susceptible to efavirenz. In 
addition, a K70E substitution in HIV-1 RT has been selected by tenofovir disoproxil and results in 
low-level reduced susceptibility to abacavir, emtricitabine, lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil.  
Patients with HIV-1 expressing three or more thymidine analogue associated mutations (TAMs) that 
included either an M41L or an L210W substitution in RT showed reduced susceptibility to tenofovir 
disoproxil. 
In vivo resistance (antiretroviral-naïve patients): In a 144-week open-label randomised clinical study 
(GS-01-934) in antiretroviral-naïve patients, where efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were used as individual formulations (or as efavirenz and the fixed combination of emtricitabine and 
tenofovir disoproxil from week 96 to 144), genotyping was performed on plasma HIV-1 isolates from 
all patients with confirmed HIV RNA > 400 copies/ml at week 144 or early study medicinal product 
discontinuation (see section on Clinical experience). As of week 144: 
  The M184V/I mutation developed in 2/19 (10.5%) isolates analysed from patients in the efavirenz 
+ emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil group and in 10/29 (34.5%) isolates analysed from the 
efavirenz + lamivudine/zidovudine group (p-value < 0.05, Fisher's Exact test comparing the 
emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil group to the lamivudine/zidovudine group among all 
subjects). 
  No virus analysed contained the K65R or K70E mutation. 
  Genotypic resistance to efavirenz, predominantly the K103N mutation, developed in virus from 
13/19 (68%) patients in the efavirenz + emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil group and in virus 
from 21/29 (72%) patients in the efavirenz + lamivudine/zidovudine group. A summary of 
resistance mutation development is shown in Table 3.

In the open-label extended phase of study GS-01-934, where patients received 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil on an empty stomach, 3 additional cases of resistance 
were seen. All 3 subjects had received a fixed dose combination of lamivudine and zidovudine and 
efavirenz for 144 weeks and then switched to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil. Two 
subjects with confirmed virologic rebound developed NNRTI resistance-associated substitutions to 
efavirenz including K103N, V106V/I/M and Y188Y/C reverse transcriptase substitutions at week 240 
(96 weeks on efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil) and week 204 (60 weeks on 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil). A third subject had pre-existing NNRTI resistance-
associated substitutions to efavirenz and the M184V reverse transcriptase resistance-associated 
substitution to emtricitabine at entry into the efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil extension 
phase and experienced a suboptimal virologic response, and developed K65K/R, S68N and K70K/E

information regarding in vivo resistance with these medicinal products. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
In a 144-week open-label randomised clinical study (GS-01-934) antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 
infected patients received either a once-daily regimen of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir 
disoproxil or a fixed combination of lamivudine and zidovudine administered twice daily and 
efavirenz once daily (please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for this medicinal 
product). Patients who completed 144 weeks of treatment with either treatment arm in study GS-01-
934 were given the option to continue in an open-label extended phase of the study with 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil on an empty stomach. Data are available from 
286 patients who switched to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil: 160 had previously 
received efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil, and 126 had previously received 
lamivudine/zidovudine and efavirenz. High rates of virologic suppression were maintained by 
subjects from both initial treatment groups who then received efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil in the open-label extended phase of the study. After 96 weeks of 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil treatment, HIV-1 RNA plasma concentrations remained < 
50 copies/ml in 82% of patients and < 400 copies/ml in 85% of patients (intention to treat analysis 
(ITT), missing=failure). 
Study AI266073 was a 48-week open-label randomised clinical study in HIV infected patients 
comparing the efficacy of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil to antiretroviral therapy 
consisting of at least two nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) with a 
protease inhibitor or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; however not a regimen containing 
all efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil components (efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir 
disoproxil). Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil was administered on an empty stomach (see 
section 4.2). Patients had never experienced virological failure on a previous antiretroviral therapy, 
had no known HIV-1 mutations that confer resistance to any of the three components within 
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil, and had been virologically suppressed for at least three 
months at baseline. Patients either changed to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (N=203) or 
continued on their original antiretroviral treatment regimen (N=97). Forty-eight week data showed 
that high levels of virologic suppression, comparable to the original treatment regimen, were 
maintained in patients who were randomised to change to efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil 
(see Table 4).

There is no clinical experience with efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in patients who are 
experiencing virological failure in a first-line antiretroviral treatment regimen or in combination with 
other antiretroviral agents. 
Patients coinfected with HIV and HBV 
Limited clinical experience in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV suggests that treatment with 
emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil in antiretroviral combination therapy to control HIV infection 
also results in a reduction in HBV DNA (3 log10 reduction or 4 to 5 log10 reduction, respectively) (see 
section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in children under the age of 
18 years have not been established. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The separate pharmaceutical forms of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil were used to 
determine the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil, administered 
separately in HIV infected patients. The bioequivalence of one efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil film-coated tablet with one efavirenz 600 mg film-coated tablet plus one emtricitabine 
200 mg hard capsule plus one tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablet (equivalent to 300 mg 
tenofovir disoproxil) administered together, was established following single dose administration to 
fasting healthy subjects in study GS-US-177-0105 (see Table 6).

In HIV infected patients, peak efavirenz plasma concentrations were attained by 5 hours and steady-
state concentrations reached in 6 to 7 days. In 35 patients receiving efavirenz 600 mg once daily, 
steady-state peak concentration (Cmax) was 12.9 ± 3.7 µM (29%) [mean ± standard deviation (S.D.) 
(coefficient of variation (%CV))], steady-state Cmin was 5.6 ± 3.2 µM (57%), and AUC was 
184 ± 73 µM•h (40%). 
Emtricitabine is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations occurring at 1 to 2 hours post-dose. 
Following multiple dose oral administration of emtricitabine to 20 HIV infected patients, steady-state 
Cmax was 1.8 ± 0.7 µg/ml (mean ± S.D.) (39% CV), steady-state Cmin was 0.09 ± 0.07 µg/ml (80%) 
and the AUC was 10.0 ± 3.1 µg•h/ml (31%) over a 24 hour dosing interval. 
Following oral administration of a single 245 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil to HIV-1 infected 
patients in the fasted state, maximum tenofovir concentrations were achieved within one hour and the 
Cmax and AUC (mean ± S.D.) (% CV) values were 296 ± 90 ng/ml (30%) and 2,287 ± 685 ng•h/ml 
(30%), respectively. The oral bioavailability of tenofovir from tenofovir disoproxil in fasted patients 
was approximately 25%. 
Effect of food 
Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil has not been evaluated in the presence of food. 
Administration of efavirenz capsules with a high fat meal increased the mean AUC and Cmax of 
efavirenz by 28% and 79%, respectively, compared to administration in a fasted state. Compared to 
fasted administration, dosing of tenofovir disoproxil and emtricitabine in combination with either a 
high fat meal or a light meal increased the mean AUC of tenofovir by 43.6% and 40.5%, and Cmax by 
16% and 13.5%, respectively without affecting emtricitabine exposures. 
Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is recommended for administration on an empty stomach 
since food may increase efavirenz exposure and may lead to an increase in the frequency of adverse 
reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). It is anticipated that tenofovir exposure (AUC) will be 
approximately 30% lower following administration of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil on 
an empty stomach as compared to the individual component tenofovir disoproxil when taken with 
food (see section 5.1). 
Distribution 
Efavirenz is highly bound (> 99%) to human plasma proteins, predominantly albumin. 
In vitro binding of emtricitabine to human plasma proteins is < 4% and independent of concentrations 
over the range of 0.02 to 200 µg/ml. Following intravenous administration the volume of distribution 
of emtricitabine was approximately 1.4 l/kg. After oral administration, emtricitabine is widely 
distributed throughout the body. The mean plasma to blood concentration ratio was approximately 
1.0 and the mean semen to plasma concentration ratio was approximately 4.0. 
In vitro binding of tenofovir to human plasma or serum protein is < 0.7% and 7.2%, respectively over 
the tenofovir concentration range 0.01 to 25 µg/ml. Following intravenous administration the volume 
of distribution of tenofovir was approximately 800 ml/kg. After oral administration, tenofovir is 
widely distributed throughout the body. 
Biotransformation 
Studies in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes have demonstrated that 
efavirenz is principally metabolised by the CYP system to hydroxylated metabolites with subsequent 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
glucuronidation of these hydroxylated metabolites. These metabolites are essentially inactive against 
HIV-1. The in vitro studies suggest that CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 are the major isozymes responsible 
for efavirenz metabolism and that it inhibits CYP isozymes 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4. In in vitro studies 
efavirenz did not inhibit CYP2E1 and inhibited CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 only at concentrations well 
above those achieved clinically. 
Efavirenz plasma exposure may be increased in patients with homozygous G516T genetic variant of 
the CYP2B6 isozyme. The clinical implications of such an association are unknown; however, the 
potential for an increased frequency and severity of efavirenz-associated adverse events cannot be 
excluded.  
Efavirenz has been shown to induce CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, resulting in the induction of its own 
metabolism, which may be clinically relevant in some patients. In uninfected volunteers, multiple 
doses of 200 to 400 mg per day for 10 days resulted in a lower than predicted extent of accumulation 
(22 to 42% lower) and a shorter terminal half-life of 40 to 55 hours (single dose half-life 
52 to 76 hours). Efavirenz has also been shown to induce UGT1A1. Exposures of raltegravir (a 
UGT1A1 substrate) are reduced in the presence of efavirenz (see section 4.5, Table 1). Although in 
vitro data suggest that efavirenz inhibits CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, there have been contradictory 
reports of both increased and decreased exposures to substrates of these enzymes when co-
administered with efavirenz in vivo. The net effect of co-administration is not clear. 
There is limited metabolism of emtricitabine. The biotransformation of emtricitabine includes 
oxidation of the thiol moiety to form the 3'-sulphoxide diastereomers (approximately 9% of dose) and 
conjugation with glucuronic acid to form 2'-O-glucuronide (approximately 4% of dose). In vitro 
studies have determined that neither tenofovir disoproxil nor tenofovir are substrates for the CYP 
enzymes. Neither emtricitabine nor tenofovir inhibited in vitro medicinal product metabolism 
mediated by any of the major human CYP isoforms involved in medicinal product biotransformation. 
Also, emtricitabine did not inhibit uridine 5'-diphosphoglucuronyl transferase, the enzyme responsible 
for glucuronidation. 
Elimination 
Efavirenz has a relatively long terminal half-life of at least 52 hours after single doses (see also data 
from bioequivalence study described above) and 40 to 55 hours after multiple doses. Approximately 
14 to 34% of a radiolabelled dose of efavirenz was recovered in the urine and less than 1% of the dose 
was excreted in urine as unchanged efavirenz. 
Following oral administration, the elimination half-life of emtricitabine is approximately 10 hours. 
Emtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys with complete recovery of the dose achieved in 
urine (approximately 86%) and faeces (approximately 14%). Thirteen percent of the emtricitabine 
dose was recovered in urine as three metabolites. The systemic clearance of emtricitabine averaged 
307 ml/min. 
Following oral administration, the elimination half-life of tenofovir is approximately 12 to 18 hours. 
Tenofovir is primarily excreted by the kidneys by both filtration and an active tubular transport 
system with approximately 70 to 80% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine following intravenous 
administration. The apparent clearance of tenofovir averaged approximately 307 ml/min. Renal 
clearance has been estimated to be approximately 210 ml/min, which is in excess of the glomerular 
filtration rate. This indicates that active tubular secretion is an important part of the elimination of 
tenofovir. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Age 
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with efavirenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir in elderly 
patients (over 65 years of age). 
Gender 
The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir are similar in male and female patients. Limited 
data suggest that females may have higher exposure to efavirenz but they do not appear to be less 
tolerant of efavirenz. 
Ethnicity 
Limited data suggest that Asian and Pacific Island patients may have higher exposure to efavirenz but 
they do not appear to be less tolerant of efavirenz. 
Paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in 
infants and children under 18 years of age (see section 4.2). 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil after co-administration of 
the separate pharmaceutical forms or as efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil have not been 
studied in HIV infected patients with renal impairment. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined following administration of single doses of the 
individual preparations of emtricitabine 200 mg or tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg to non-HIV infected 
patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. The degree of renal impairment was defined 
according to baseline creatinine clearance (normal renal function when creatinine clearance > 
80 ml/min; mild impairment with creatinine clearance=50 to 79 ml/min; moderate impairment with 
creatinine clearance=30 to 49 ml/min and severe impairment with creatinine 
clearance=10 to 29 ml/min). 
The mean (% CV) emtricitabine exposure increased from 12 µg•h/ml (25%) in subjects with normal 
renal function to 20 µg•h/ml (6%), 25 µg•h/ml (23%) and 34 µg•h/ml (6%) in patients with mild, 
moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. 
The mean (% CV) tenofovir exposure increased from 2,185 ng•h/ml (12%) in patients with normal 
renal function, to 3,064 ng•h/ml (30%), 6,009 ng•h/ml (42%) and 15,985 ng•h/ml (45%) in patients 
with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. 
In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis, between dialysis drug 
exposures substantially increased over 72 hours to 53 µg•h/ml (19%) of emtricitabine, and over 
48 hours to 42,857 ng•h/ml (29%) of tenofovir. 
The pharmacokinetics of efavirenz have not been studied in patients with renal impairment. However, 
less than 1% of an efavirenz dose is excreted unchanged in the urine, so the impact of renal 
impairment on exposure to efavirenz is likely to be minimal. 
Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe 
renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min). Patients with moderate or severe renal 
impairment require dose interval adjustment of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil that cannot be 
achieved with the combination tablet (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil have not been studied in HIV 
infected patients with hepatic impairment. Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should be 
administered with caution to patients with mild hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil must not be used in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (see section 4.3) and is not recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. 
In a single-dose study of efavirenz, half-life was doubled in the single patient with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh-Turcotte Class C), indicating a potential for a much greater degree of 
accumulation. A multiple-dose study of efavirenz showed no significant effect on efavirenz 
pharmacokinetics in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh-Turcotte Class A) compared 
with controls. There were insufficient data to determine whether moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh-Turcotte Class B or C) affects efavirenz pharmacokinetics. 
The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine have not been studied in non-HBV infected patients with 
varying degrees of hepatic insufficiency. In general, emtricitabine pharmacokinetics in HBV infected 
patients were similar to those in healthy subjects and in HIV infected patients. 
A single 245 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil was administered to non-HIV infected patients with 
varying degrees of hepatic impairment defined according to CPT classification. Tenofovir 
pharmacokinetics were not substantially altered in subjects with hepatic impairment suggesting that 
no dose adjustment of tenofovir disoproxil is required in these subjects. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Efavirenz: Non-clinical safety pharmacology studies on efavirenz reveal no special hazard for 
humans. In repeated-dose toxicity studies, biliary hyperplasia was observed in cynomolgus monkeys 
given efavirenz for ≥ 1 year at a dose resulting in mean AUC values approximately 2-fold greater than 
those in humans given the recommended dose. The biliary hyperplasia regressed upon cessation of 
dosing. Biliary fibrosis has been observed in rats. Non-sustained convulsions were observed in some 
monkeys receiving efavirenz for ≥ 1 year, at doses yielding plasma AUC values 4- to 13-fold greater 
than those in humans given the recommended dose. 
Efavirenz was not mutagenic or clastogenic in conventional genotoxicity assays. Carcinogenicity 
studies showed an increased incidence of hepatic and pulmonary tumours in female mice, but not in 
male mice. The mechanism of tumour formation and the potential relevance for humans are not 
known. Carcinogenicity studies in male mice, male and female rats were negative. 
Reproductive toxicity studies showed increased foetal resorptions in rats. No malformations were 
observed in foetuses from efavirenz-treated rats and rabbits. However, malformations were observed 
in 3 of 20 foetuses/newborns from efavirenz-treated cynomolgus monkeys given doses resulting in 
plasma efavirenz concentrations similar to those seen in humans. Anencephaly and unilateral 
anophthalmia with secondary enlargement of the tongue were observed in one foetus, 
microophthalmia was observed in another foetus and cleft palate was observed in a third foetus.  
Emtricitabine: Non-clinical data on emtricitabine reveal no special hazard for humans based on 
conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic 
potential, and toxicity to reproduction and development. 
Tenofovir disoproxil: Non-clinical safety pharmacology studies on tenofovir disoproxil reveal no 
special hazard for humans. Findings in repeated-dose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and monkeys at 
exposure levels greater than or equal to clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical 
use include renal and bone toxicity and a decrease in serum phosphate concentration. Bone toxicity 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was diagnosed as osteomalacia (monkeys) and reduced bone mineral density (BMD) (rats and dogs). 
The bone toxicity in young adult rats and dogs occurred at exposures ≥ 5-fold the exposure in 
paediatric or adult patients; bone toxicity occurred in juvenile infected monkeys at very high 
exposures following subcutaneous dosing (≥ 40-fold the exposure in patients). Findings in the rat and 
monkey studies indicated that there was a substance-related decrease in intestinal absorption of 
phosphate with potential secondary reduction in BMD.  
Genotoxicity studies revealed positive results in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, equivocal results 
in one of the strains used in the Ames test, and weakly positive results in a urine drug test (UDS) in 
primary rat hepatocytes. However, it was negative in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus 
assay. 
Oral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice only revealed a low incidence of duodenal tumours at an 
extremely high dose in mice. These tumours are unlikely to be of relevance to humans. 
Reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or 
foetal parameters. However, tenofovir disoproxil reduced the viability index and weight of pups in 
peri-postnatal toxicity studies at maternally toxic doses. 
Combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil: Genotoxicity and repeated-dose toxicity 
studies of one month or less with the combination of these two components found no exacerbation of 
toxicological effects compared to studies with the separate components.

1.  What Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is and what it is used for 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan contains three active substances that are 
used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection: 
-  Efavirenz is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) 
-  Emtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) 
-  Tenofovir disoproxil is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) 
Each of these active substances, also known as antiretroviral medicines, work by interfering with an 
enzyme (reverse transcriptase) that is essential for the virus to multiply. 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is a treatment for Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in adults aged 18 years and over who have previously been 
treated with other antiretroviral medicines and have their HIV-1 infection under control for at least 
three months. Patients must not have experienced failure of a previous HIV therapy. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Mylan

effects or stop these medicines from working properly. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. 
-  This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection. While taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Mylan you may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV 
infection. 
-  You must remain under the care of your doctor while taking 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. 
-  Tell your doctor: 
- 
- 
if you are taking other medicines that contain efavirenz, emtricitabine, tenofovir 
disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil. 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should not be taken with any of 
these medicines. 
if you have or have had kidney disease, or if tests have shown problems with your 
kidneys. Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is not recommended if 
you have moderate to severe kidney disease. 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan may affect your kidneys. Before 
starting treatment, your doctor may order blood tests to assess kidney function. Your 
doctor may also order blood tests during treatment to monitor your kidneys. 
71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is not usually taken with other 
medicines that can damage your kidneys (see Other medicines and 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan). If this is unavoidable, your 
doctor will monitor your kidney function once a week. 
if you have a heart disorder, such as abnormal electrical signal called 
prolongation of the QT interval. 
if you have a history of mental illness, including depression, or of substance or 
alcohol abuse. Tell your doctor immediately if you feel depressed, have suicidal 
thoughts or have strange thoughts (see section 4, Possible side effects). 
if you have a history of convulsions (fits or seizures) or if you are being treated with 
anticonvulsant therapy such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin. If you 
are taking any of these medicines, your doctor may need to check the level of 
anticonvulsant medicine in your blood to ensure that it is not affected while taking 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. Your doctor may give you a 
different anticonvulsant. 
if you have a history of liver disease, including chronic active hepatitis. Patients 
with liver disease including chronic hepatitis B or C, who are treated with 
combination antiretrovirals, have a higher risk of severe and potentially life-
threatening liver problems. Your doctor may conduct blood tests in order to check 
how well your liver is working or may switch you to another medicine. If you have 
severe liver disease, do not take Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Mylan (see earlier in section 2, Do not take Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Mylan). 
If you have hepatitis B infection, your doctor will carefully consider the best treatment 
regimen for you. Tenofovir disoproxil and emtricitabine, two of the active substances 
in Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, show some activity against 
hepatitis B virus although emtricitabine is not approved for the treatment of hepatitis 
B infection. Symptoms of your hepatitis may become worse after discontinuation of 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. Your doctor may then conduct 
blood tests at regular intervals in order to check how well your liver is working (see 
section 3, If you stop taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan).  
Independent of a history of liver disease, your doctor will consider regular blood tests 
to check how your liver is working. 
if you are over 65. Insufficient numbers of patients over 65 years of age have been 
studied. If you are over 65 years of age and are prescribed 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, your doctor will monitor you 
carefully. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
-  Once you start taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, look out for: 
- 
- 
signs of dizziness, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating or 
abnormal dreaming. These side effects may start in the first 1 or 2 days of treatment 
and usually go away after the first 2 to 4 weeks. 
any signs of skin rash. Rashes may be caused by Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Mylan. If you see any signs of a severe rash with blistering or fever, stop 
taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan and tell your doctor at 
once. If you had a rash while taking another NNRTI, you may be at higher risk of 
getting a rash with Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. 
72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV 
infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infection, signs and symptoms of 
inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is 
started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to improvement in the body’s 
immune response, enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present 
with no obvious symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please tell your 
doctor at once. 
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that 
occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you 
start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders 
may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of 
infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the 
hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or 
hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. 
-  bone problems. Some patients taking combination antiretroviral therapy may develop 
a bone disease called osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue caused by loss of blood 
supply to the bone). The length of combination antiretroviral therapy, corticosteroid 
use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index, 
among others, may be some of the many risk factors for developing this disease. Signs 
of osteonecrosis are joint stiffness, aches and pains (especially of the hip, knee and 
shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these symptoms, please 
inform your doctor.  
Bone problems (manifesting as persistent or worsening bone pain and sometimes 
resulting in fractures) may also occur due to damage to kidney tubule cells (see 
section 4, Possible side effects). Tell your doctor if you have bone pain or fractures. 
Tenofovir disoproxil may also cause loss of bone mass. The most pronounced bone 
loss was seen in clinical studies when patients were treated with tenofovir disoproxil 
in combination with a boosted protease inhibitor. 
Overall, the effects of tenofovir disoproxil on long-term bone health and future 
fracture risk in adult and paediatric patients are uncertain. 
Tell your doctor if you know you suffer from osteoporosis. Patients with osteoporosis 
are at a higher risk for fractures. 
Children and adolescents 
-  Do not give Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan to children and 
adolescents under 18 years of age. The use of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Mylan in children and adolescents has not been studied. 
Other medicines and Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan 
You must not take Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan with certain medicines. 
These are listed under Do not take Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, at the start of 
section 2. They include some common medicines and some herbal preparations (including St. John’s 
wort) which can cause serious interactions. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Also, Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should not be taken with any other 
medicines that contain efavirenz (unless recommended by your doctor), emtricitabine, tenofovir 
disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil. 
Tell your doctor if you are taking other medicines which may damage your kidneys. Some examples 
include: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
aminoglycosides, vancomycin (medicines for bacterial infections) 
foscarnet, ganciclovir, cidofovir (medicines for viral infections) 
amphotericin B, pentamidine (medicines for fungal infections) 
interleukin-2 (to treat cancer) 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, to relieve bone or muscle pains) 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan may interact with other medicines, including 
herbal preparations such as Ginkgo biloba extracts. As a result, the amounts of 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan or other medicines in your blood may be 
affected. This may stop your medicines from working properly, or may make any side effects worse. 
In some cases, your doctor may need to adjust your dose or check your blood levels. It is important 
to tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: 
-  Medicines containing didanosine (for HIV infection): Taking 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan with other antiviral medicines that 
contain didanosine can raise the levels of didanosine in your blood and may reduce CD4 cell 
counts. Inflammation of the pancreas and lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood), 
which sometimes caused death, have been reported rarely when medicines containing 
tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine were taken together. Your doctor will carefully consider 
whether to treat you with medicines containing tenofovir and didanosine. 
-  Other medicines used for HIV infection: The following protease inhibitors: darunavir, 
indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, or ritonavir boosted atazanavir or saquinavir. Your 
doctor may consider giving you an alternative medicine or changing the dose of the protease 
inhibitors. Also, tell your doctor if you are taking maraviroc. 
-  Medicines used to treat infection with the hepatitis C virus: elbasvir/grazoprevir, 
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir. 
-  Medicines used to lower blood fats (also called statins): Atorvastatin, pravastatin, 
simvastatin. Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan can reduce the amount of 
statins in your blood. Your doctor will check your cholesterol levels and will consider 
changing the dose of your statin, if needed.  
-  Medicines used to treat convulsions/seizures (anticonvulsants): Carbamazepine, phenytoin, 
phenobarbital. Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan can reduce the amount of 
the anticonvulsant in your blood. Carbamazepine can reduce the amount of efavirenz, one of 
the components of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, in your blood. Your 
doctor may need to consider giving you a different anticonvulsant.  
-  Medicines used to treat bacterial infections, including tuberculosis and AIDS-related 
mycobacterium avium complex: Clarithromycin, rifabutin, rifampicin. Your doctor may need 
to consider changing your dose or giving you an alternative antibiotic. In addition, your doctor 
may consider giving you an additional dose of efavirenz to treat your HIV infection.  
-  Medicines used to treat fungal infections (antifungals): Itraconazole or posaconazole. 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan can reduce the amount of itraconazole or 
posaconazole in your blood. Your doctor may need to consider giving you a different 
antifungal. 
74 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-  Medicines used to treat malaria: Atovaquone/proguanil or artemether/lumefantrine. 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan may reduce the amount of 
atovaquone/proguanil or artemether/lumefantrine in your blood.  
-  Praziquantel, a medicine used to treat parasitic worm infections. 
-  Hormonal contraceptive, such as birth control pills, an injected contraceptive (for 
example, Depo-Provera), or a contraceptive implant (for example, Implanon): You must 
also use a reliable barrier method of contraception (see Pregnancy and breast-feeding). 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan may make hormonal contraceptives less 
likely to work. Pregnancies have occurred in women taking efavirenz, a component of 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, while using a contraceptive implant, 
although it has not been established that the efavirenz therapy caused the contraceptive to fail. 
-  Sertraline, a medicine used to treat depression, as your doctor may need to change your dose 
of sertraline.  
-  Metamizole, a medicine used to treat pain and fever. 
-  Bupropion, a medicine used to treat depression or to help you stop smoking, as your doctor 
may need to change your dose of bupropion. 
-  Diltiazem or similar medicines (called calcium channel blockers): When you start taking 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, your doctor may need to adjust your 
dose of the calcium channel blocker. 
-  Medicines used to prevent organ transplant rejection (also called immunosuppressants), 
such as cyclosporine, sirolimus or tacrolimus. When you start or stop taking 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan your doctor will closely monitor your 
plasma levels of the immunosuppressant and may need to adjust its dose. 
-  Warfarin or acenocoumarol (medicines used to reduce clotting of the blood): Your doctor 
may need to adjust your dose of warfarin or acenocoumarol. 
-  Ginkgo biloba extracts (herbal preparation). 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Women should not get pregnant during treatment with Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Mylan and for 12 weeks thereafter. Your doctor may require you to take a pregnancy test 
to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment with Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Mylan. 
If you could get pregnant while receiving Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, 
you need to use a reliable form of barrier contraception (for example, a condom) with other methods 
of contraception including oral (pill) or other hormonal contraceptives (for example, implants, 
injection). Efavirenz, one of the active components of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Mylan, may remain in your blood for a time after therapy is stopped. Therefore, you should continue 
to use contraceptive measures, as above, for 12 weeks after you stop taking 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan.  
Tell your doctor immediately if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. If you are 
pregnant, you should take Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan only if you and your 
doctor decide it is clearly needed.  
75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Serious birth defects have been seen in unborn animals and in the babies of women treated with 
efavirenz during pregnancy.  
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
If you have taken Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan during your pregnancy, your 
doctor may request regular blood tests and other diagnostic tests to monitor the development of your 
child. In children whose mothers took NRTIs during pregnancy, the benefit from the protection against 
HIV outweighed the risk of side effects. 
Do not breast-feed during treatment with Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan.  
The ingredients of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan may pass through breast milk 
and cause serious harm to your baby. 
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed 
on to the baby in breast milk. 
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as 
soon as possible 
Driving and using machines 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan may cause dizziness, impaired 
concentration and drowsiness. If you are affected, do not drive and do not use any tools or machines. 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan contains sodium and lactose 
This medicine contains 7.5 mg of sodium metabisulfite per tablet, which may rarely cause severe 
hypersensitivity reactions and bronchospasm. It contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, 
that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. Each tablet also contains 105.5 mg of lactose per tablet. If you 
have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before 
taking this medicine.  
3. 
How to take Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
The recommended dose is: 
One tablet taken each day by mouth. Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should be 
taken on an empty stomach (commonly defined as 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal) preferably at 
bedtime. This may make some side effects (for example, dizziness, drowsiness) less troublesome. 
Swallow Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan whole with water. 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan must be taken every day. 
If your doctor decides to stop one of the components of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Mylan, you may be given efavirenz, emtricitabine and/or tenofovir disoproxil separately or with other 
medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. 
If you take more Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan than you should 
If you accidentally take too many Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan tablets you 
may be at increased risk of experiencing possible side effects with this medicine (see section 4, 
Possible side effects). Contact your doctor or nearest emergency department for advice. Keep the 
tablet packaging with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. 
76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you forget to take Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan 
It is important not to miss a dose of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. 
If you do miss a dose of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan within 12 hours of 
when it is usually taken, take it as soon as you can, and then take your next dose at its regular time. 
If it is almost time (less than 12 hours) for your next dose anyway, do not take the missed dose. 
Wait and take the next dose at the regular time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten 
tablet. 
If you throw up the tablet (within 1 hour after taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Mylan), you should take another tablet. Do not wait until your next dose is due. You do 
not need to take another tablet if you were sick more than 1 hour after taking 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. 
If you stop taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan 
Don’t stop taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan without talking to your 
doctor. Stopping Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan can seriously affect your 
response to future treatment. If Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is stopped, speak 
to your doctor before you restart taking Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan tablets. 
Your doctor may consider giving you the components of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Mylan separately if you are having problems or need your dose adjusted. 
When your supply of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan starts to run low, get 
more from your doctor or pharmacist. This is very important because the amount of virus may start to 
increase if the medicine is stopped for even a short time. The virus may then become harder to treat. 
If you have both HIV infection and hepatitis B, it is especially important not to stop your 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan treatment without talking to your doctor first. 
Some patients have had blood tests or symptoms indicating that their hepatitis has got worse after 
stopping emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil (two of the three components of 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan). If Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil 
Mylan is stopped your doctor may recommend that you resume hepatitis B treatment. You may require 
blood tests to check how your liver is working for 4 months after stopping treatment. In some patients 
with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not recommended as this may lead to 
worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening. 
Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, particularly 
symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This 
is partly linked to restored health and life style, and in the case of blood lipids sometimes to the HIV 
medicines themselves. Your doctor will test for these changes. 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Possible serious side effects: tell your doctor immediately 
77 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-  Lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) is a rare (may affect up to 1 in every 
1,000 patients) but serious side effect that can be fatal. The following side effects may be 
signs of lactic acidosis: 
- 
- 
- 
deep rapid breathing 
drowsiness 
feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and stomach pain. 
If you think you may have lactic acidosis, contact your doctor immediately. 
Other possible serious side effects

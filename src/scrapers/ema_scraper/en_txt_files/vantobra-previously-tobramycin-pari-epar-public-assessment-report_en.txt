2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
This hybrid marketing authorisation application for Tobramycin PARI 170mg / 1.7ml is a duplicate of the 
2015 approved hybrid marketing authorisation application by the same MAH (PARI Pharma GmbH) for 
VANTOBRA 170mg / 1.7ml, with reference to the same originator product, TOBI (Novartis 
Pharmaceuticals Ltd, UK). 
2.1.2.  Disease or condition 
Cystic fibrosis (CF, also known as mucoviscidosis) is a hereditary, autosomal recessive chronic disease 
that affects a variety of organ systems (Döring et al. 2007; Hagerman et al. 2007). Chronic airway 
disease is a prominent complication of the disease and is present in more than 98% of CF patients. 
Pulmonary features noted in CF patients include chronic cough highlighted by periodic episodes of 
increased sputum volume and purulence. 
The currently accepted paradigm in the lung pathophysiology of CF is based on the hypothesis that 
reduced mucociliary clearance - as a consequence of a defective chloride channel - facilitates bacterial 
lung infection with opportunistic pathogens (Döring et al. 2007; Hagerman et al. 2007; Weiner et al. 
2008). These infections become chronic due to a phenotypic switch from non-mucoid to mucoid variants 
which are resistant to antibiotics and the innate host response. 
CF occurs predominantly in Caucasian populations, with approximately 1 in 1,500-3,200 individuals 
affected in the US, but it has been estimated that 1 out of 20–25 individuals carry the CF transmembrane 
regulator gene. About 50,000 CF patients are registered in Europe and North America (Hagerman et al. 
2007). 
Morbidity and mortality in patients with CF are primarily attributable to progressive obstructive 
pulmonary disease (lung function declines by ≈2% per year) in conjunction with chronic Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa (PA) endobronchial infection and an intense neutrophilic inflammatory response. The 
prevalence of PA infection increases with age, with positive respiratory tract cultures reported for 30-40% 
of children 2-10 years of age, and 60–80% of adolescents and adults with CF (Gibson et al. 2003). 
Improvements in clinical care have resulted in a distinct increase in the life expectancy of people with CF 
over the last 40 years (Döring et al. 2007; Weiner et al. 2008). In several European countries, the median 
survival is now between 30 and 40 years. The aggressive treatment of lung disease and improvements in 
nutrition are the major factors in this context. However, eradication of PA (Ramsey et al. 1999) is rare and 
about 95% of CF patients still die from respiratory failure (Döring et al. 2007). 
Tobramycin is the most frequently used antibiotic for the treatment of pulmonary infections caused by PA 
in patients suffering from CF. The value of intravenous (i.v.) tobramycin application for pulmonary 
exacerbations in CF is well established. Significant questions remain, however, as to optimum 
combinations, duration of treatment and frequency of administration (Döring et al. 2007). In addition, the 
low penetration of tobramycin into sputum after parenteral administration necessitates high doses of the 
Assessment report

drug to achieve concentrations sufficient to inhibit PA, and thus leads to increased risk of systemic 
adverse events, such as ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity (Moss 2001).  
About the product 
This marketing authorisation application concerns a tobramycin formulation for inhalation developed by 
PARI Pharma GmbH, Tobramycin PARI 170 mg/1.7 ml nebuliser solution administered via a delivery 
system (Tolero), based on a vibrating membrane technology (eFlow).  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The submitted dossier is identical with the dossier submitted for Vantobra with the following exceptions: 
Module 1 has been updated according to the requirements of the duplicate application. There are some 
editorial changes in module 2 and 3. Throughout the dossier, pouch has been replaced by the standard 
term sachet. The latest version of the CEP for the drug substance has been provided, i.e. R1-CEP 
1997-046 Rev 04. This is the current version according to the EDQM webpage. More recent stability data 
has been provided for the drug product that supports the already approved shelf-life of 3 years. 
Furthermore the Risk Management Plan has been updated. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is presented as a sterile nebuliser solution containing 170 mg of tobramycin as active 
substance.  
Other ingredients are: sodium chloride, calcium chloride, magnesium sulphate, water for injection, 
sulphuric acid (for pH adjustment) and sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment).  
The product is available in single-dose polyethylene (PE) ampoules that are packed in sealed aluminium 
foil sachets (8 ampoules per sachet). The ampoules are supplied with a single patient use, reusable, drug 
specific, electronic Tolero nebuliser handset which has a CE mark.  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
The chemical name of tobramycin is 4-O-(3-Amino-3-deoxy-α-D-glucopyranosyl)- 
2-deoxy-6-O-(2,6-diamino-2,3,6-trideoxy- α -D-ribo-hexopyranosyl)-L-streptamine and has the 
following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
Assessment report  
EMA/901707/2018  
Page 7/38 
 
 
 
 
The active substance is a white or almost white hygroscopic powder freely soluble in water, very slightly 
soluble in ethanol (96%). 
As there is a monograph of tobramycin in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the active 
substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for 
tobramycin which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Manufacture 
The information provided regarding the manufacturing process and the control of the active substance 
was assessed and approved by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM) before 
issuing the Certificate of Suitability. Satisfactory quality of the active substance is ensured through the 
CEP. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (Ph.Eur.), identity (Ph.Eur.), pH 
(Ph.Eur.), specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), assay (Ph. Eur, HPLC-UV), related substances (HPLC-UV), 
residual solvents (GC), water (Ph.Eur.) and sulphated ash (Ph.Eur.). 
The active substance will be tested and assessed by the finished product manufacturer applying the 
methods and specifications laid down in the Ph.Eur. monograph and the CEP, except for assay and related 
substances. The applicant has developed two in-house methods to test these parameters in both the 
active substance and the finished product. Both methods have been adequately described and 
cross-validated against the Ph.Eur. methods. Batch analysis data on seven commercial scale and one pilot 
scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
The CEP of the active substance manufacturer includes a suitably validated re-test period in a defined 
container closure system, supported by the available stability data. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
Tobramycin PARI nebuliser solution is a clear, sterile, preservative- and stabiliser-free solution for 
nebulisation with a drug specific electronic nebuliser. It contains Tobramycin, Ph.Eur. in a concentration 
of 100 mg/ml and is supplied in single dose low density polyethylene ampoules.The nebuliser solution 
contains an overage to ensure that the target volume is dispensed.  
The product has been developed in accordance with the requirements of the Guideline on the 
pharmaceutical quality of inhalation and nasal products (EMEA/CHMP/QWP/49313/2005 Corr.).  
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to prepare a tobramycin nebuliser solution with reduced 
inhalation time in comparison to TOBI, the reference product. The development focused on the reduction 
of the volume to be administered by increasing tobramycin concentration in the solution and the use of a 
different device for nebulisation. The results of this study showed that tobramycin concentrations up to 
100 mg/ml gave appropriate lung deposition. Therefore this concentration was selected for further 
development.  
Assessment report  
EMA/901707/2018  
Page 8/38 
 
 
 
A nominal dose of 150 mg in 1.5 ml of the 100mg/ml formulation was used during initial development, but 
based on the pharmacokinetic studies, the nominal dose was increased to 170 mg in 1.7 ml in order to 
maintain the therapeutic equivalence.  
Subsequent studies were aimed at improving the formulation characteristics. Since aqueous solutions of 
tobramycin at 100 mg/ml have a pH around 10.5, pH adjustment was required to obtain physiological pH 
values in the solution for inhalation. The excipients chosen for pH adjustment were sulphuric acid 96% 
and sodium hydroxide. Moreover, in order to ensure an adequate osmolality range for a nebuliser solution 
and isotonicity, sodium chloride, calcium chloride and magnesium sulphate were added as tonicity 
agents.  
The compatibility of tobramycin sulphate with the excipients used in the final formulation and other 
potential excipients investigated during pharmaceutical development was adequately demonstrated.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The primary packaging consists on single-dose polyethylene ampoules. The material complies with 
Ph.Eur. requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and 
is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Nebuliser development  
Tobramycin PARI was developed to be delivered with a drug-specific, single patient use, reusable 
electronic nebuliser called Tolero. The Tolero device is CE marked and is composed of three main 
components: a Controller (eBase controller or eFlowrapid control unit), a connection cord and a drug 
specific nebuliser handset (aerosol head) as illustrated below:  
Figure 2 
Appropriate studies have been performed to evaluate the compatibility of the device materials with the 
medicinal product. 
In addition, the product has been adequately characterised and compared with TOBI/PARI LCPlus 
(nebuliser used to administer the reference product, TOBI) using the tests described in Ph. Eur. 
2.9.44.monograph. Active substance delivery rate, total active substance delivered, and aerodynamic 
assessment of nebulised aerosols were evaluated. Tobramycin PARI nebulised with the Tolero handset 
was shown to have a similar delivered dose (DD), a similar mean mass-related median aerodynamic 
diameter (MMAD), a higher mean respirable dose and a shorter nebulisation time than the reference 
product. 
Assessment report  
EMA/901707/2018  
Page 9/38 
 
 
 
 
 
Due to the different principles of aerosol generation between the two devices PARI LC Plus and eFlow, 
there were statistically significant differences between the two devices in Drug Delivery Rate (DDR), with 
the Tobramycin PARI/eFlow system significantly higher than for the jet nebulizer system TOBI/PARI LC 
Plus, both for adults and children. As a consequence the nebulisation times are much shorter for the eFlow 
device (3.4 minutes for the new devices and 4.5 minutes for the returned study devices compared to 
14.6minutes for PARI LC Plus). 
No statistically significant differences were seen between unused and used eFlow devices for any of the 
parameters tested. Breath simulation experiments also confirmed that the drug delivery rate of 
Tobramycin PARI is independent of the breathing pattern applied (adult or child). 
Since there were differences in the concentration and delivery rate of both products, therapeutic 
equivalence between Tobramycin PARI and the reference product could not be established based on 
in-vitro data. Nevertheless, these results are supportive of the clinical efficacy studies presented. 
A simulated user test was conducted to investigate the effect of operating eFlow/Tolero with Tobramycin 
PARI 170mg over 56 treatments (corresponding to 28 days twice daily use). The results from this study 
showed that Tolero nebuliser handset when nebulizing Tobramycin PARI delivers tobramycin in a 
consistent manner during a treatment cycle of 28 days. 
Tilting of the handset and its effects on the delivered dose and nebulisation time was also evaluated. No 
significant effects were observed when tilting the device 15° in different directions. However, tilting 
45°resulted in significant differences in delivered dose. Although 45° tilting is considered extreme since 
the instructions indicate to keep it horizontally, a warning has been included in the proposed SmPC 
(section 6.6). 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process consists of: preparation of tobramycin bulk solution, pH adjustment, double 
sterile filtration, aseptic filling using a blow/fill/seal technology and packaging. Sterile filtration was 
chosen as the sterilisation method due to the degradation of tobramycin at high temperatures.  
The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process and has been validated on three 
full scale batches of tobramycin 150 mg/1.5 ml solution at the proposed manufacturing site. This is 
acceptable since the process is identical and only the fill volume differs with respect to the product 
intended for commercialization (Tobramycin PARI 170 mg/1.7 ml). It has been demonstrated that the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of the intended quality in a 
reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form as 
described in the Ph. Eur. and EMA/CHMP/QWP/49313/2005 Corr. It includes description, appearance 
(clarity, color and visible particles) (Ph. Eur.), sub-visible particles (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units 
(Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph.Eur.), sterility (Ph.Eur), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), identity 
(HPLC-UV), assay (HPLC-UV) and related substances (HPLC-UV).  
Batch analysis results are provided for four pilot scale batches used in clinical studies and three 
commercial scale validation batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its 
Assessment report  
EMA/901707/2018  
Page 10/38 
 
 
 
ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. The finished product is released on the 
market based on the above release specifications, through traditional final product release testing.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three validation and three production scale batches of tobramycin 150 mg/1.5 ml solution 
stored for 36 months under long term conditions (5 ºC) and accelerated conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) 
according to ICH guidelines; and for up to 6 months under 40 ºC / 75% RH were provided. The batches 
are identical to those proposed for marketing, except of the fill volume.  
In addition, supportive data from a clinical pilot scale batch of Tobramycin PARI (tobramycin 170 mg/ 1.7 
ml) stored under long term conditions (5 ºC) and accelerated conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) for 48 months, 
and at 30 ºC / 65% RH and 40 ºC / 75% RH) for 12 months was presented.  
Samples were tested for appearance (clarity, colour and visible particles), uniformity of dosage units, pH, 
osmolality, sterility, assay and related substances. The clinical batch was also tested for mass per dosage 
unit (for information only). 
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
The stability results of the three validation batches as well as of the three commercial batches 
demonstrate that all tested parameters are within the acceptance criteria and provide evidence that the 
finished product is stable for the claimed shelf-life of 36 months when stored at 5°C. 
During six months at 25 °C/60 % RH all parameters were also within the defined specification. After six 
months at 25 °C/60 % RH a change of colour was observed but no correlation with the purity profile of the 
finished product could be established. 
The stability results of the three validation batches as well as of the three commercial batches 
demonstrate that all tested parameters are within the acceptance criteria and provide evidence that the 
drug product is stable for the claimed shelf-life of 36 months when stored at 5°C. 
Even up to six months when stored at 25 °C/60 % RH all parameters meet the defined specification. After 
six months at 25 °C/60 % RH a change of colour is observed but no correlation with the purity profile of 
the drug product could be established. 
In addition, one clinical batch exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. A second photostability study was performed on samples from a 
clinical batch which had been stored at 5°C for a period of 32 months to assess the photostability nearly 
at the end of shelf-life. The shelf-life specification parameters assay, related substances, clarity and 
colour of the solution, visible particles, and uniformity of dosage units, pH-value, osmolality and also 
absorbance at 410nm were tested. 
A third photo stability study using samples of one of the commercial batches was also conducted. This 
study was designed to assess the photo stability at start of shelf life. The shelf-life specification 
parameters; assay, related substances, clarity and colour of the solution, visible particles, pH-value and 
osmolality were tested. 
The results from these studies confirmed that Tobramycin PARI 170 mg is photostable under the tested 
conditions as required in ICH Q1B and thus not sensitive to light. 
An in-use stability study was conducted using one clinical batch which had been stored at 5°C for a period 
of 32 months (nearly end of shelf-life) and one commercial batch from the start of shelf-life. This study 
was designed to evaluate the stability of Tobramycin PARI after opening the aluminium foil sachet. The 
ampoules were removed from the sachets and stored for 4 weeks in a stability cabinet at 25°C/60% RH 
Assessment report

(and at 25°C/60% RH  the commercial batch only) or in the laboratory at ambient temperature and 
humidity. 
Samples were tested for appearance (clarity, colour and visible particles), uniformity of dosage units, 
acceptance value, pH, osmolality, related substances, sterility and assay. The clinical batch was also 
tested for absorbance at 410 nm, surface tension and dynamic viscosity. 
The results from these studies confirmed the in-use stability of the product for 4 weeks at ambient 
conditions and under controlled conditions (25°C/60% RH and 25°C/40% RH). 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years stored in a refrigerator (2 °C – 8°C), 
and in use shelf-life after opening the sachet of 4 weeks when stored below 25 °C as stated in the SmPC 
are acceptable. The contents of a single-dose ampoule should be used immediately after opening. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Overall information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency 
and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.Conclusions on the 
chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.5.  Recommendations for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of the active substance tobramycin are 
well known. As tobramycin is a widely used, well-known active substance, the applicant has not provided 
additional studies and further studies are not required. Since this MAA is a hybrid application, and TOBI is 
an approved reference product for Tobramycin PARI, an overview based on limited literature data is 
acceptable.

(N) 
PEC surfacewater value of tobramcin was below the action limit of 0.01µg/L and tobramycin is not a PBT 
substance as experimentally determined log Kow does not exceed 4.5. Therefore, Tobramycin PARI is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies have been performed with Tobramycin PARI. In accordance with Article 10 of 
Directive 2001/83/EC, in a generic or hybrid application the nonclinical data can be bridged from the 
reference medicinal product. This is the approach adopted by the Applicant, who refers to the overview 
generated with the previously approved product TOBI, as well as to the fact that tobramycin has been 
widely used and is a well-known substance in the clinic for the last decades and its human safety profile 
is well established. This justification for the lack of new non-clinical studies is considered acceptable. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections to approval of Tobramycin PARI from a non-clinical point of view.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetic properties of tobramycin have been evaluated over time in children, adult and 
elderly subjects with CF. Data available in published literature are briefly summarised below: 
Absorption  
Tobramycin is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration and hence the 
systemic exposure after inhalation is expected to result primarily from the pulmonary absorbed portion of 
the dose. Following tobramycin inhalation, serum concentrations are expected to be low; values around 
1 μg/ml are reported in the literature. Concentrations in sputum are approximately 1000 times higher 
compared to serum concentrations. Binding of tobramycin to plasma proteins is less than 10%. 
Distribution 
Tobramycin is distributed in the extracellular fluid. The apparent volume of distribution is 0.3 L/kg body 
weight. 
Elimination 
Tobramycin is not metabolised and is primarily eliminated unchanged in the urine via glomerular 
filtration. The elimination half-life is approximately 2-3 h. 
Pharmacokinetic studies 
Four clinical/pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted: 
•  Study G007.03: a single-dose lung deposition study of Tobramycin 100 PARI/eFlow versus 
TOBI/PARI LC PLUS in adult and adolescent CF patients 
•  Study G007.05: a 28-day pharmacokinetic and safety study of Tobramycin 100 PARI/eFlow 
versus TOBI/PARI LC PLUS in CF patients 
• 
Study 12012.101: a 14-week, 2-period, multi-centre, crossover bioequivalence as well as 
efficacy and safety study of TOBRAMYCIN PARI/Tolero (eFlow) versus TOBI/PARI LC PLUS 
•  Study 12012.102: a single-dose, 2-period, crossover bioequivalence study in healthy volunteers 
of TOBRAMYCIN PARI/Tolero (eFlow) versus TOBI/PARI LC PLUS 
Studies G007.03 and G007.05 are mainly explorative as a dose lower than the proposed to be marketed 
dose was administered to the enrolled patients.  
In the pivotal bioequivalence studies 12012.101 and 12012.102 the final TOBRAMYCIN PARI dose of 170 
mg/1.7 ml dose was administered and compared to inhalation of TOBI 300 mg. The primary objective of 
these studies was to evaluate bioequivalence between TOBRAMYCIN PARI and TOBI. In addition, efficacy 
and safety of TOBRAMYCIN PARI and TOBI were evaluated. 
Study G007.03 
In this lung deposition study a lower dose of 150 mg/1.5 ml of the test product was administered. 
Methods 
This was a randomised, open-label, 2-way cross-over trial in which the lung deposition of Tobramycin 
PARI 150 mg/1.5 ml delivered by the eFlow electronic nebuliser and TOBI 300 mg/5 ml using the PARI LC 
PLUS jet nebuliser, was compared after a single-dose administration.  
A total of 17 male patients with cystic fibrosis were enrolled: 9 subject aged 10-17 and 8 subjects >17 
years. Subjects received inhaled tobramycin spiked with the radiolabel 99mTc-DTPA 
Assessment report  
EMA/901707/2018  
Page 14/38 
 
 
 
(diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid). Tobramycin lung deposition was measured using gamma camera 
imaging.  
The primary efficacy variable was the difference between the estimated lung deposition of Tobramycin 
PARI 150 mg delivered with the eFlow device run to dryness compared to TOBI delivered with the PARI LC 
PLUS device until sputtering, or 10 minutes (whichever occurred first).  
Given that similar particle size distribution of tobramycin and 99mTc-DTPA after nebulisation into a particle 
sizing device (Next Generation Pharmaceutical Impactor) was obtained, it was assumed that the 
deposition of the radiolabel would be an accurate representation of the deposition of tobramycin.  
The lungs were imaged at 5 minute intervals for 20 minutes following the deposition; it was possible to 
calculate the clearance rate of the radiolabel and then mathematically adjust the image to reflect what 
had been deposited during the entire period of nebulisation. 
Results 
The results are presented in the below table: 
Table 2: Lung deposition (mg) of Tobramycin based on 99Tc-DTPA counts (Study G007.03). 
The mean lung deposition was similar between treatments and the p-value indicates no evidence of 
treatment difference. Similar results were obtained when the primary results were stratified by age 
group, except that the confidence intervals were wider due to smaller sample sizes. The lung deposition 
relative to the total drug amount was higher for Tobramycin PARI 150 mg (31%) compared to TOBI 
(17%). The extra-thoracic deposition in the mediastinum and stomach was not significantly different for 
the different formulations.  
Study G007.05 
In this explorative comparative bioavailability study the same lower dose of 150 mg/1.5 ml of the test 
product was administered-as in the lung deposition study G007.03. 
Methods 
This was a randomised, open-label, multicentre, active controlled, parallel safety and bioavailability study 
of Tobramycin PARI 150 mg (150 mg/1.5 ml) nebulised with eFlow versus TOBI (300 mg/5 ml) nebulised 
with PARI LC PLUS in cystic fibrosis patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections. 
A total of 78 patients, 21 aged 8-17 years and 18 adults per treatment group were randomised for either 
treatment A (Tobramycin PARI 150 mg/eFlow) or treatment B (TOBI 300 mg/PARI LC PLUS). The dose of 
the reference product (300 mg tobramycin bid) was in accordance with the SmPC for TOBI. The dose of 
Assessment report

the test product (150 mg bid) was chosen as it had proven an equivalent in vitro aerosol characterisation 
of the respirable dose and delivered dose as the reference. After a 7-day wash-out phase, in which no 
tobramycin was allowed, the patients were treated with their assigned medication and devices for 28 
consecutive days. Blood and sputum samples were taken at days 1, 7 and 28. Pre-dose blood samples 
were taken at day 1 and 28. At day 7 blood samples were taken pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 
8 hours post-dose. Sputum samples were taken 10 minutes after inhalation at days 1, 7 and 28. 
Concentrations of tobramycin in plasma and sputum were analysed using an LC-MS/MS assay.  
The primary efficacy variable was Cmax on day 7. Secondary efficacy variables were AUC at day 7, 
sputum levels at days 1, 7 and 28 and plasma trough levels at days 1, 7 and 28. 
Results - plasma 
Plasma tobramycin Cmax on day 7 and plasma tobramycin AUC on day 7 are shown in the following tables:

Table 5: Sputum tobramycin levels on Day 7 (PP population Study G007.05). 
After the administration of Tobramycin PARI 150 mg, tobramycin plasma exposure did not exceed the 
exposure obtained after administration of TOBI 300 mg. Tobramycin sputum concentrations were similar 
between formulations. The fact that the plasma sampling period was rather short (8h) and that the 
sputum evaluation were based on one sample per subject and period (10 min post inhalation) only is 
acceptable for this supportive study. 
Study 12012.101  
This was a comparative, randomised, two period, multi-centre, cross-over, 14-week bioequivalence study 
of TOBRAMYCIN PARI (170 mg/1.7 ml) delivered by the eFlow electronic nebulizer versus TOBI (300 mg/5 
ml) using the PARI LC PLUS jet nebulizer in cystic fibrosis patients with bronchopulmonary chronic 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.  
The primary objective was to determine bioequivalence of TOBRAMYCIN PARI and TOBI in children and 
adolescents/adults using eFlow or PARI LC PLUS devices, respectively. In addition, efficacy and safety of 
the two different medicinal products were evaluated as secondary objectives. 
Methods 
The clinical part of the study was conducted at four EU study centres. The bioanalytical part collected 
plasma and sputum samples. No issues regarding GCP have been identified.  
Study design  
This was a multicentre open label, randomised, 2-period, 2-sequence, crossover study following 
administration of Tobramycin with two different inhalation systems and different doses in 58 patients 
treated either with TOBRAMYCIN PARI (170 mg/1.7 ml) / eFlow or TOBI (300 mg/5 ml) / PARI LC PLUS. 
Tobramycin was administered twice daily (in the morning and in the evening), until dryness of the 
nebuliser. Each treatment period was 4 weeks, separated by a washout-phase of 4 weeks between 
periods 1 and 2.  
At the end of each treatment cycle, blood- and sputum-samples were collected and analysed for 
tobramycin using a validated LC/MS/MS method. Blood-samples were collected pre-dose (30 - 15 min 
prior to inhalation), and at 30 min, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 h after end of inhalation. Sputum samples 
were collected pre-dose (30 - 15 min prior to inhalation), and at 10 min, 30 min, 1.5, 2 and 8 h after end 
of inhalation.  
Populations studied 
A total of 58 cystic fibrosis patients with bronchopulmonary chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection 
(25 male and 33 female) were enrolled. Of the 58 enrolled patients, 28 were aged 7-13 years and 30

patients 13-36 years. All subjects were Caucasian. Fifty-four patients received both study treatments. 
Three patients stopped the treatment during the wash-out phase and one patient was withdrawn from the 
study participation 3 days after the start of TOBI treatment. The reasons were impairment or worsening 
of the disease in one case and in three cases because of (serious) adverse events. Five additional patients 
were excluded from the PK-analysis due to insufficient PK-sampling.  
Hence, 49 subjects were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis.  
Pharmacokinetic Variables 
Pharmacokinetic variables were calculated using conventional non-compartmental methods. The primary 
endpoint was plasma AUC0-12h. Secondary PK-endpoints included Cmax, C0 in plasma and sputum and Tmax. 
Statistical methods   
The statistical analysis was performed on log-transformed plasma AUC0-12h and Cmax using ANOVA. 
Consistent with the two one-sided tests for bioequivalence, 90%-confidence intervals for the difference 
between drug formulation least-squares means (LSM) were calculated for the log-transformed 
parameters plasma AUC0-12h and plasma Cmax. 
The acceptance range for the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of the back-transformed LSMEANS of 
tobramycin was determined as 80% to 125% for the parameters plasma AUC0-12h and 70% to 133% for 
plasma Cmax. The parameter plasma tmax was evaluated descriptively. 
Results 
Plasma concentration versus time profiles (AUC0-12h), maximum concentration (Cmax), time to maximum 
concentration (tmax) and trough levels (C0) of the test treatment TOBRAMYCIN PARI in comparison to 
TOBI were determined at the end of each treatment phase. The results are presented below:

Figure 3: Plasma tobramycin concentration versus time profile (arithmetic mean ± SD; all 
groups) (Study 12012.01). 
After a 28-days treatment period, the systemic exposure and peak concentrations of TOBRAMYCIN PARI 
was about 15% and 17% lower compared to TOBI (total data for both age groups) and the 90% CI was 
outside the conventional bioequivalence limits of 80.00-125.00. In the age group 7-13 years, the upper 
limit of the 90% CI for Cmax was also slightly above the conventional acceptance limit of 1.25, but below 
the prospectively defined widened limit of 1.33. Median tmax was comparable between the test and the 
reference formulation. A high variability in AUC and Cmax for both products was observed. When data 
was distinguishing between children (7-13 years) and adolescents (>13 years) a slightly lower AUC and 
Cmax in the older age group compared to the younger was observed. 
Sputum concentrations versus time profiles (AUC0-8), maximum concentrations (Cmax), time to maximum 
concentration (tmax) and trough levels (C0) of the test treatment TOBRAMYCIN PARI in comparison to 
TOBI were determined at the end of each treatment phase. The results are presented below:

Variability in sputum concentrations was high. A formal bioequivalence evaluation was not performed, but 
mean tobramycin exposure in sputum was approximately 35% higher for TOBRAMYCIN PARI compared to 
TOBI.  
During the CHMP discussion of these results, it was acknowledged that, although the findings on lung 
function and P. aeruginosa suppression seemed suggestive of efficacy and did not indicate relevant 
differences in efficacy between TOBRAMYCIN PARI and the reference product, it was not possible to 
conclude whether the difference in pharmacokinetic parameters affected the efficacy of TOBRAMYCIN

PARI, because of the high variability of the results. A potential under-dosing could not be ruled out 
entirely, based only on the results of this study. To further support the efficacy and safety of TOBRAMYCIN 
PARI, the applicant also conducted a bioequivalence study in healthy volunteers (study 12012.102). 
Study 12012.102  
This was an open-label, single-dose, randomized, two-way crossover study to investigate the 
bioequivalence and compare the safety profiles following inhalation of TOBRAMYCIN PARI 170 mg/1.7 mL 
nebulizer solution to TOBI 300 mg/5 mL nebulizer solution. Plasma concentrations of tobramycin was 
analysed using a validated LC/MS/MS method.  
Objectives: 
The objectives of this study were to investigate the bioequivalence (in terms of relative systemic 
bioavailability based on pharmacokinetic plasma profiles) of TOBRAMYCIN PARI 170 mg/1.7 mL nebulizer 
solution as compared to TOBI300 mg/5 mL nebulizer solution in healthy subjects and to assess and 
compare the local and systemic safety and tolerability of the test and reference treatment. 
Methods: 
Bioequivalence in healthy subjects was planned to be investigated by analysing plasma concentrations of 
tobramycin following inhalation of TOBRAMYCIN PARI 170 mg/1.7 mL nebulizer solution and TOBI 300 
mg/5 mL nebulizer solution in two treatment periods in randomized order. 
Safety and tolerability were to be assessed on the basis of the following variables: adverse events, 
pregnancy test, vital signs, safety laboratory, drug and alcohol screening, serology, ECG, physical 
examination, local tolerability, and overall tolerability. 
Study population: 
72 healthy subjects were randomized; 69 completed the trial. 
Results: 
Plasma concentration versus time profiles (AUC0-12h), maximum concentration (Cmax) and time to 
maximum concentration (tmax) of the test treatment TOBRAMYCIN PARI in comparison to TOBI were 
determined in each period. The results are presented below:

volunteers, n=69 (Study 12012.12). 
After single-dose administration in healthy volunteers the systemic exposure and peak concentrations of 
TOBRAMYCIN PARI was about 24% and 21% higher compared to TOBI and the 90% CI was outside the 
conventional bioequivalence limits of 80.00-125.00. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The mode of action of tobramycin is virtually the same as that of other aminoglycosides such as 
gentamicin. It is first actively transported across the bacterial cell membrane by an oxygen-dependent 
system.  Hence, aminoglycosides are inactive under anaerobic conditions. Aminoglycosides primarily 
affect bacterial protein synthesis and result in rapid concentration-dependent killing. The molecule binds 
irreversibly to the A site of the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome where it blocks protein synthesis by 
inhibiting the movement of peptidyl-tRNA associated with translocation as well as increasing the 
frequency of misreading of the genetic code as a result of incorrect codon-anticodon interaction. The cell 
membrane permeability is affected, resulting in the disruption of the cell wall, and ultimately in cell death. 
The effect of tobramycin is bactericidal at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than inhibitory 
concentrations. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Tobramycin has a broad antibacterial spectrum including many Gram-positive species and most aerobic 
and facultative Gram-negative bacilli including Pseudomonas spp. The antibacterial effect of 
aminoglycosides correlates best with peak serum concentrations in relation to MIC (Cmax / MIC). 
There is an extensive clinical experience of both intravenously administered tobramycin as well as inhaled 
tobramycin to patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Local concentrations in the lungs after inhalation of 
tobramycin is considerably higher compared to concentrations obtained after systemic administration, 
leading to that conventional susceptibility breakpoints are not applicable. However, sputum from patients 
with CF exhibits an inhibitory action on the local biological activity of inhaled aminoglycosides. This 
necessitates sputum concentrations of tobramycin after inhalation to be about ten-fold above the 
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or higher for P. aeruginosa suppression. The unique 
Assessment report

characteristics of chronic P. aeruginosa lung infections in CF patients, such as anaerobic conditions and 
high frequency of genetic mutations, may also be important factors for reduced susceptibility of P. 
aeruginosa in CF patients. Tobramycin, like other aminoglycosides, is associated with renal toxicity and 
ototoxicity. In general, toxicity is seen at higher systemic tobramycin levels than are achievable by 
inhalation at the recommended clinical dose. 
2.4.4.  Clinical efficacy  
As this is a hybrid application, the clinical efficacy data derive from the pivotal clinical study (phase 1b) 
performed with tobramycin 170mg in 1.7ml/eFlow (here referred to as Tobramycin PARI) in comparison 
to TOBI/PARI LC PLUS (here referred to as TOBI) and relevant available bibliographical data from studies 
performed with the reference medicinal product TOBI.

chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. 
Methods 
Open, randomized, cross-over, multiple dose bioequivalence study (treatment phase 1: 4 weeks; 
wash-out phase between treatments: 4 weeks; treatment phase 2: 4 weeks).

Tobramycin was administered twice daily, in the morning and in the evening, until dryness of the 
nebuliser. Each treatment period was 4 weeks separated by a washout-phase of 4 weeks between periods 
1 and 2. At the end of each treatment cycle, blood- and sputum-samples were collected. Blood-samples 
were collected pre-dose (30 - 15 min prior to inhalation), and at 30 min, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 h after 
end of inhalation. Sputum samples were collected pre-dose (30 - 15 min prior to inhalation), and at 10 
min, 30 min, 1.5, 2 and 8 h after end of inhalation.  
Objectives

Outcomes and estimation 
The main efficacy results of this BE study are presented below: 
Figure 5: Colony Forming Units (CFU): Overall reduction of PA (All); normalized on Visit 2 as 
Baseline 
Note: in this figure, Tobramycin PARI is labelled T100. 
Treatment with tobramycin resulted in an overall reduction in CFU density of P. aeruginosa, irrespective 
of the specific medicinal product/nebulizer used. In general, the treatment effect was more pronounced in 
the first than in the second treatment period. During the first treatment phase a similar log10 CFU 
reduction was achieved with Tobramycin PARI and TOBI (-1.77 ± 2.74 vs. -1.70 ± 2.93, p < 0.005), in the 
second treatment phase the reduction was -1. 30 ± 2.55 and 0.12 ± 1.78, respectively. The calculation 
over the complete treatment period revealed an overall reduction of PA CFU density of -3.07 ± 5.26 and 
-1.62 ± 5.14 for Tobramycin PARI and TOBI, respectively.

The changes in the different lung function parameters under investigation were consistently indicative for 
an improvement under both therapies. 
The treatment effects of FEV1 % predicted were very similar for both groups, Tobramycin PARI and TOBI, 
in the first treatment period. However, a positive treatment effect was also observed for Tobramycin PARI 
in the second treatment phase. During the first treatment phase a similar percentual increase in FEV1 was 
achieved with Tobramycin PARI and TOBI (8.20 ± 9.49 vs. 24.80 ± 9.58), in the second treatment phase 
the change was 2.40 ± 10.64 and -0.44 ± 8.10, respectively. The calculation over the complete treatment 
period revealed an overall increase in FEV1 of 10.59 ± 20.81 and 4.48 ± 18.24 for Tobramycin PARI and 
TOBI, respectively.

Data for the different age categories indicate that the youngest patients (6-13 years) benefitted from 
both treatment regimens, irrespective of treatment cycle, while in adolescents and adults there was no 
improvement from TOBI when given in the second treatment cycle.

The treatment effects of FEV25-75 (predicted) were very similar for both groups, Tobramycin PARI and 
TOBI, in the first treatment period. However, a positive treatment effect was also observed for 
Tobramycin PARI in the second treatment phase. During the first treatment phase a similar percentual 
increase in FEV25-75 was achieved with Tobramycin PARI and TOBI (9.15 ± 13.76 vs. 10.28 ± 14.32), in 
the second treatment phase the change was 2.35 ± 16.08 and -1.54 ± 15.20, respectively. The 
calculation over the complete treatment period revealed an overall increase in FEV25-75 of 11.50 ± 30.43 
and 9.01 ± 31.29 for Tobramycin PARI and TOBI, respectively.

The treatment effects on the forced vital capacity (FVC) were comparable between Tobramycin PARI and 
TOBI. However, a positive treatment effect was also recognized in patients who received Tobramycin 
PARI in the second treatment phase, whereas in patients who received TOBI during the second treatment 
period the positive effect could not be preserved. During the first treatment phase a similar percentual 
increase in FVC was achieved with Tobramycin PARI and TOBI (6.53 ± 9.78 vs. 4.74 ± 11.45), in the 
second treatment phase the change was 0.03 ± 9.56 and -0.07 ± 6.99, respectively. The calculation over 
the complete treatment period revealed an overall increase in FVC of 6.56 ± 20.25 and 4.75 ± 19.40 for 
Tobramycin PARI and TOBI, respectively. 
The treatment effects of PEF are not statistically different between the both groups Tobramycin PARI and 
TOBI. However, a positive treatment effect is seen in patients who received Tobramycin PARI in the 
second treatment phase. During the first treatment phase a similar percentual increase in PEF was 
achieved with Tobramycin PARI and TOBI (3.92 ± 16.60 vs. 5.44 ± 13.41), in the second treatment phase 
the change was 3.00 ± 12.30 and -0.95 ± 11.23, respectively. The calculation over the complete 
treatment period revealed an overall increase in PEF of 6.92 ± 28.96 and 4.65 ± 25.19 for Tobramycin 
PARI and TOBI, respectively. 
2.4.5.  Clinical safety 
Patient Exposure 
  Exposure in healthy volunteers 
Study 12012.102 was an open-label, single-dose, randomized, two-way crossover study to investigate 
the bioequivalence and compare the safety profiles following inhalation of Tobramycin PARI 170 mg/1.7 
mL nebulizer solution to TOBI 300 mg/5 mL nebulizer solution in 72 (69 completed) healthy subjects. 
All patients who terminated the study according to protocol received a total of about 470 mg tobramycin. 
Three subjects, who terminated the study early, received about 300 mg tobramycin.  
  Patient exposure 
A total of 153 patients were included in the safety database from three phase 1 study populations: Study 
G007.03 (17 patients),  Study G007.05 Safety and bioavailability study (78 patients)  and a phase 1b 
study, 12012.101, Bioequivalence as well as safety assessment of Tobramycin PARI /eFlow versus TOBI 
PARI LC/PLUS (58 patients). Study 12012.101 was considered pivotal. In this study, the dose that is 
currently applied for, 170 mg/1.7 ml, was used. The other two studies (G007.03 and G007.05) 
investigated lower doses. 
Study G007.03 
Three of the 17 subjects (17.6%) experienced a total of 5 AEs, all of which occurred after the nebulisation 
of Tobramycin PARI (125 mg or 150 mg). AEs were labelled most commonly as ´mild´ (4/5 AEs 80%) and 
had resolved by the end of the study. According to the investigator´s assessment the causal 
drug-reaction relationship was ´highly probable´ for 1 AE (cough) and ´unlikely´ for 3 AEs (abdominal 
pain, nausea, cough).  
Four other subjects experienced cough of low intensity, which was not deemed as an AE after nebulisation 
of Tobramycin PARI 150 mg. Bronchospasm, voice alteration, tinnitus or dyspnoea were not reported. 
One serious AE of moderate intensity (allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis) was reported, judged 
‘definitely not related’ to study treatment by the investigator. 
Study G007.05 
Assessment report  
EMA/901707/2018  
Page 27/38 
 
 
 
Of the 246 AEs reported, 179 AEs (72.8%) were considered unrelated to the study medication, whereas 
67 (27.2%) were considered related and thus qualified as ADRs. In the reference group (TOBI/PARI LC 
PLUS), 41 of the 143 AEs (28.7%) were considered therapy-related, in the Tobramycin PARI 150 
mg/eFlow group these were 26 of the 103 AEs (25.2%). 
Of the 246 AEs in randomised patients, 147 (59.8%) events were of mild and 75 (30.5%) of moderate 
severity; 24 (9.8%) were severe.  Severe AEs were more frequent in the TOBI/PARI LC PLUS group 
(17/143 AEs, i.e. 11.9%) compared to the Tobramycin PARI 150 mg/eFlow group (7/103 AEs, i.e. 6.8%). 
There were no SAEs reported in this study. Two patients treated with TOBI experienced seven respiratory 
AEs which were considered significant. 
Study 12012.101 
In this study 1.7 ml of the 100 mg/ml solution was used, i.e. 170 mg which is the dose proposed for 
approval of market authorisation (Tobramycin PARI). Thus the total dose is considerably lower (170 mg) 
compared to the reference product TOBI (300 mg). However, according to in vitro data, the delivered 
dose and the respirable doses seems to be quite similar between the two products. 
Adverse events 
Healthy subjects 
Safety assessment amongst Tobramycin PARI and TOBI using eFlow and PARI LC PLUS devices, 
respectively, was considered as secondary endpoint in the bioequivalence study in healthy volunteers 
(12012.102). 
In total, 70 adverse events (AEs) were reported in 49 out of 72 patients (68.1%). Reported AEs were 
generally mild in intensity and distributed into the System Organ Class (SOC) “respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders” and “nervous system disorders”. The most frequent AEs for Tobramycin PARI were 
reported from the SOC respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (25 events in 22 subjects), the 
most frequently reported preferred term was “cough”, reported from 17 subjects. The most frequent AEs 
for TOBI were reported from the SOC nervous system disorders with preferred term “headache” (11 
events in 10 subjects). All other SOC were reported with a frequency of five or less events with a similar 
rate between the treatment groups.  
Of the 70 AEs, 16 (22.9%) were rated as not related and 54 (77.1%) were rated as related with 
tobramycin inhalation. The distribution of related events over the treatment groups was 64.8% 
(Tobramycin PARI) and 35.2% (TOBI). Reported AEs were generally mild in intensity. Events were 
categorized as mild in 92.7% and 65.5%, moderate in 7.3% and 27.6%, and severe in 0% and 6.9% for 
Tobramycin PARI and TOBI, respectively. 
CF Patients 
As expected from active ingredient properties AEs were mainly represented by respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders.  Overall, 76 adverse events were reported in 29 patients (50 % of all patients) of 
the safety population under investigation (n = 58). 29 patients experienced no AEs. Three AEs were 
severe in intensity, and all others were classified to be mild to moderate. 32 adverse events (approx. 42% 
of all AEs) were considered to be related to the study drug, i.e. they were defined as ADRs. All of them 
were classified as mild to moderate in intensity. 
There were no clinically relevant pre- vs. end-of-study changes in vital signs. Neither were there any pre- 
vs. end-of-study changes in physical examination observed. 
Bronchospasms as defined in the protocol occurred only in 2 patients under TOBI (3.4% of the patients) 
and were considered by the investigator as an ADR. 
Assessment report  
EMA/901707/2018  
Page 28/38 
 
 
 
Audiology testing revealed two cases of tinnitus in patients under Tobramycin PARI treatment (3.4% of all 
patients). Both cases were mild in severity and transient as resolving shortly after inhalation. One patient 
in the Tobramycin PARI group showed pathological signs in pure tone audiometry measured by bone 
connectivity (highest value for left ear at 2 KHz was 35 dB). 
Pulmonary exacerbation was observed in one patient (1109) only during the wash-out phase after TOBI 
treatment. This patient required treatment with antibiotics which were prohibited as per study protocol 
and thus was withdrawn from further study participation. 
Investigations on the occurrence of resistant P. aeruginosa revealed only inconclusive results as cultures 
of sputum samples showed no growth of the pathogen in approx. half of the assays. 
Analysis of the CFQ-R revealed only inconclusive results. Neither relevant differences nor even trends 
were found between the treatment groups or age strata. 
The time per inhalation was markedly reduced in the drug/device combination of Tobramycin PARI / eFlow 
(mean: 4.4 min) as compared to the combination TOBI / PARI LC PLUS (mean: 24.3 min). 
Compliance to therapy of the patients was generally high in both groups with 99% for Tobramycin PARI 
patients (as recorded by an electronic Monitoring System of the device) and 99% for TOBI patients (as 
recorded in patient diaries). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In study 12012.102 in healthy volunteers, no death occurred during the study. One serious adverse event 
(SAE) occurred in the current study (ankle fracture), considered as not related to study drug.   
In total, five SAEs due to hospitalization occurred in 4 CF patients during the washout period; however, 
none of them was considered drug-related. No fatality was observed. 
Laboratory findings 
Six events were described as clinically relevant increases in laboratory values (4 in one patient, who 
discontinued TOBI-treatment and increase of LDH in another two patients, one patient in the Tobramycin 
PARI, one patient in the TOBI group, both continued the treatment). All of those abnormal parameters 
were recorded as AEs, i.e. none of these were drug related. All other changes of laboratory values outside 
of the normal range were assessed by the investigators as “not clinically significant”. 
Safety in special populations 
The study was performed in patients aged 7-36 years of age, mean age 15 years. This represents the 
target population. In study 12012.101 the number of AEs in the age stratum 6-13 years was twice as 
frequent as in the stratum group >13 years (40 vs. 19 events), but the system organ class (SOC) pattern 
was similar between the age strata. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In study 12012.102 in healthy volunteers, two subjects of the total of 72 subjects in the safety population 
terminated the study early because of a SAE (ankle fracture and common cold). Among studies in CF 
patients, in no case study medication had to be discontinued temporarily or permanently due to an ADR. 
There were 5 serious adverse events (SAEs) recorded in 4 patients; the reason for seriousness was 
hospitalisation in all cases. None of the SAEs was drug-related.

Post marketing experience 
No new safety concerns have arisen in the post-marketing period since VANTOBRA, for which this 
marketing authorisation application is a duplicate, was authorised in 2015, according to the most recent 
PSUR (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010370/201803). The number of patients exposed to VANTOBRA is 
estimated by the MAH at 227 person-years up to 18-March 2018 (note that VANTOBRA has been 
introduced after different intervals and with different market shares in 6 countries; Germany, Austria, 
Italy, United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Greece). 
Since VANTOBRA was authorised, published data identified by routine EMA signal detection activities have 
identified possible antagonism arising with combinations of oral azithromycin and inhaled tobramycin 
(Nick et al., 2014; Nichols 2015; Nichols et al. 2017;). While some in vitro data offer a potential 
theoretical / mechanistic support for this potential interaction, the published clinical data carry several 
limitations that hinder conclusive interpretation, and PRAC ultimately determined that there is not 
sufficient evidence of an interaction at this time (PRAC 2017, EMEA/H/C/0002155/SDA/032). A planned, 
prospective clinical trial will test the impact of adding azithromycin to inhaled tobramycin in CF patients 
with chronic P. aeruginosa infection (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02677701; expected completion 2019), which 
will further inform the need to update the product information and/or risk management measures for 
relevant products, including Tobramycin PARI. 
2.4.6.  Discussion on clinical aspects  
Pharmacokinetics 
The main objective was to analyse the bioequivalence between TOBRAMYCIN PARI and TOBI in order to 
bridge to the efficacy and safety data obtained with TOBI. In the pivotal bioequivalence study (Study 
12012.101), the administration of TOBRAMYCIN PARI and TOBI was compared in CF patients. The results 
showed slightly lower systemic exposure (15% lower) with TOBRAMYCIN PARI compared to TOBI. In 
order to further support the efficacy profile evaluation of TOBRAMYCIN PARI, an additional bioequivalence 
study in healthy subjects (Study 12012.102) was conducted. In this study the systemic exposure of 
TOBRAMYCIN PARI was, on the contrary, slightly higher compared to TOBI.  
Discussion of the design of the studies 
Study 12012.101 was conducted in CF patients and had a multiple-dose cross-over design where plasma 
and sputum samples were analysed on day 28 in each period. For immediate release products it is usually 
recommended to evaluate bioequivalence after single-dose administration since a multiple-dose study is 
less sensitive to detect differences in Cmax due to accumulation. Given the relatively short half-life of 
tobramycin (2-3 h), the risk of accumulation is however minor and the choice of sampling at day 28 is 
acceptable. Almost half of the subjects (46%) reached tmax at the first sampling point (30 min), 
indicating that a more frequent early sampling would have been recommendable. Hence there are 
uncertainties in the estimation of Cmax. Inhalation of a larger volume for a longer time period, as for 
TOBI, might lead to larger volumes of sputum. The total amount of tobramycin in sputum could therefore 
have been additionally measured. Sputum samples are hence a mixture of sputum ranging from the 
upper respiratory tract to deeper parts of the lungs. It is therefore difficult to draw firm conclusions about 
the clinical relevance of the possibly higher tobramycin concentration found in sputum after 
administration of TOBRAMYCIN PARI.  
Study 12012.102 was a well-designed single-dose study in healthy volunteers.  
In both studies, TOBI (300 mg/5 ml) was used as comparator. The bioanalytical methods for 
determination of tobramycin in plasma and sputum were adequately validated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/901707/2018  
Page 30/38 
 
 
 
 
Discussion of the results 
The absorption of tobramycin was faster in patients compared to healthy volunteers with a median tmax of 
1 h and 4 h, respectively. The overall systemic exposure also appeared to be lower in patients 
(between-study comparison). In CF patients the systemic exposure was slightly lower with TOBRAMYCIN 
PARI while in healthy subjects the systemic exposure was slightly higher with TOBRAMYCIN PARI 
compared to TOBI. 
According to the guideline on the requirements for clinical documentation for orally inhaled products (OIP) 
including the requirements for demonstration of therapeutic equivalence between two inhaled products 
for use in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults and for 
use in the treatment of asthma in children and adolescents (CPMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1), 
pharmacokinetic data could be used as a surrogate of pulmonary deposition, and hence efficacy, for an 
orally inhaled product used in the treatment of asthma and COPD, under the condition that 
gastro-intestinal absorption is negligible or blocked by charcoal. Since tobramycin is not absorbed from 
the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration the systemic exposure after inhalation is expected 
to result primarily from the pulmonary absorbed portion of the dose. However, given the 
disease-associated effects on the airways including presence of mucous in patients with CF the situation 
is more complex. In CF patients, the relationship between plasma exposure and pulmonary deposition is 
therefore not obvious and the use of PK-data as a surrogate of efficacy may be questioned in this patient 
population. However, the results from the pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers provide useful 
complementary information about the in vivo performance of TOBRAMYCIN PARI, avoiding the bias in CF 
patients, which have a heterogeneous and variable obstruction.  
In patients the exposure was approximately 15% lower after administration of TOBRAMYCIN PARI 
compared to TOBI while in healthy subjects the exposure was approximately 24% higher with 
TOBRAMYCIN PARI than with TOBI.  
The lower systemic exposure in CF patients did however raise questions pertaining to the fact that less 
tobramycin could have reached the lungs and that TOBRAMYCIN PARI might have been less efficacious 
compared to TOBI. However, in healthy subjects the airways are not affected by mucous etc. and the 
systemic exposure is therefore expected to better reflect pulmonary deposition. The higher systemic 
exposure obtained with TOBRAMYCIN PARI compared to TOBI in healthy volunteers does therefore 
indicate that the amount of tobramycin deposited in the lung was not lower, but actually slightly higher 
with TOBRAMYCIN PARI in comparison to TOBI. A higher pulmonary deposition is relevant from an 
efficacy point of view and the efficacy of TOBRAMYCIN PARI is thus expected to be comparable with that 
of TOBI. Although the evaluation of sputum concentration had some limitations, the higher sputum 
concentrations obtained with TOBRAMYCIN PARI compared to TOBI is indicative of a somewhat higher 
lung deposition.  
It is concluded that the overall results of the in vitro characterisation and the pharmacokinetic studies 
show that despite the fact that TOBRAMYCIN PARI was not completely equivalent to TOBI, the in vivo 
differences were rather small and are not expected to impact on the efficacy or safety of TOBRAMYCIN 
PARI. Furthermore, the clinical efficacy data in CF patients, although limited, did not indicate clear 
differences between the two medicinal products. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The mechanism of action and mechanisms of resistance of tobramycin are well known and there is an 
extensive clinical experience of both intravenously administered tobramycin as well as inhaled 
tobramycin to patients with CF.  
Local concentrations in the lungs after inhalation of tobramycin is considerably higher compared to 
concentrations obtained after systemic administration, leading to fact that conventional susceptibility 
Assessment report  
EMA/901707/2018  
Page 31/38 
 
 
 
breakpoints are not applicable. However, sputum from patients with CF exhibits an inhibitory action on 
the local biological activity of inhaled aminoglycosides. This necessitates sputum concentrations of 
tobramycin after inhalation to be about ten-fold above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or 
higher for P. aeruginosa suppression. The unique characteristics of chronic P. aeruginosa lung infections 
in CF patients, such as anaerobic conditions and high frequency of genetic mutations, may also be 
important factors for reduced susceptibility of P. aeruginosa in CF patients. No thorough data on 
susceptibility to tobramycin of the P. aeruginosa strains isolated during the study period was submitted. 
The limited information regarding susceptibility to tobramycin is acceptable for this hybrid application. 
The pharmacodynamic properties of tobramycin are well known and no further studies are needed. 
Clinical efficacy 
The main differences between the two medicinal products are the concentration and total amount of 
inhaled tobramycin, related to different inhalation device systems. Efficacy data were primarily derived 
from the comparative, randomized, open-label, two bioequivalence study 12012.101, in which clinical 
efficacy was collected as a secondary endpoint. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal study was designed in accordance with protocol assistance from the CHMP to analyse the 
bioequivalence between Tobramycin PARI and TOBI. Of note, the study was not designed or powered for 
efficacy endpoints, which were secondary endpoints.  
The open-label design was deemed acceptable, because the differences in nebulisers used for both 
treatments complicated a double-blind design.  
The included participants (not treatment-naïve) can largely be regarded representative for the target 
population.  
The youngest patient included was 7 years old. TOBI is the current “gold standard” in the inhalational 
therapy for management of pulmonary infections in CF and, therefore, an adequate comparator. The 
measured secondary efficacy endpoints (clinical: lung function parameters FEV1 %, FVC, FEV25-75, PEF; 
microbiological: P. aeruginosa suppression) were considered relevant and in accordance with 
recommendations in the CHMP CF guideline (CHMP/EWP/9147/2008).  According to the report of a recent 
workshop on endpoints for cystic fibrosis clinical trials (EMA/69571/2012) lung function parameters, in 
particular FEV1, are recommended as the core outcome parameters. Microbiology outcome should focus 
on CFU/g in respiratory samples and should be regarded as supportive, but it is stressed that 
microbiological impact generally does not predict the clinical response or magnitude of response. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
No large drop-out rates were observed and compliance was high for both treatments. No large differences 
were observed at baseline for both groups. Overall, the observed treatment effects of Tobramycin PARI 
were supportive of efficacy. For both products a significant improvement of lung function relative to 
baseline was observed. This effect was, furthermore, consistent over the various parameters, as well as 
with the observed decrease in P. aeruginosa CFU. Although there was a large variability in the data as 
apparent from the large standard deviations (also due to the small numbers), the improvement seemed 
slightly more pronounced for Tobramycin PARI treatment. Despite the fact that the treatment effect 
diminished during the treatment phase 2, the  treatment effect with Tobramycin PARI still seemed 
beneficial, while a reduction in lung function was observed with TOBI, in particular in participants >13 
years.  Because of the small sample size, the relevance of these findings cannot be fully concluded upon. 
It may be speculated that the lack of efficacy in adolescents and adult patients receiving TOBI in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/901707/2018  
Page 32/38 
 
 
 
second cycle, may be due to compliance issues, considering the longer administration time compared to 
the previous treatment in this subgroup with Tobramycin PARI. Although compliance was recorded as 
high in both groups, the figures reported for TOBI may not be fully reliable, considering that they were 
only reported in patients’ diaries. The available data indicate that the clinical efficacy of Tobramycin PARI 
is comparable with that of TOBI, notwithstanding that some differences between Tobramycin PARI and 
TOBI with regard to effect on lung function and P. aeruginosa suppression could still exist, provided 
results from the Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) records did not provide divergent results.

Safety data were available from all four conducted clinical studies. However, study 12012.102 was 
performed in healthy subjects and only study 12012.101 provided safety data obtained from patients 
exposed to the proposed dose.  
Overall, study 12012.102 did not detect any events justifying safety concerns in healthy volunteers. No 
signs of local intolerability (paradoxical bronchospasm) were recorded after administration of both 
tobramycin products. 
The results from study 12012.101 showed that the systemic exposure of tobramycin is lower after 
administration of Tobramycin PARI/eFlow compared TOBI/PARI LC PLUS. Thus, the systemic safety of 
Tobramycin PARI is not expected to be different or worse than for TOBI and is therefore reassuring. 
The most frequent observed drug-related AEs were in the respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal system 
organ classes, with cough being most frequently reported. No unexpected safety issues, including 
laboratory findings, were identified in the safety population in the different studies. The observed safety 
profile was largely similar for both treatment groups, although a slightly higher frequency of drug-related 
AEs were observed for Tobramycin PARI compared to TOBI, but because of the small size of the safety 
population, this cannot be fully concluded upon.  
Special attention was aimed at the audiometry assessment, but no evidence was found indicating that 
patients treated with Tobramycin PARI were at higher risk for alterations due to higher local drug 
concentrations that derive from higher strength of the tobramycin concentration in Tobramycin PARI or 
the enhanced drug delivery rate using the Tolero device. No safety signals could be observed which where 
indicative for effects resulting from faster drug delivery. 
Inhaled tobramycin is widely used in CF patients and has a well-known safety profile and quality and PK 
assessment did not indicate any relevant findings that might affect safety. However, the small safety 
population due to small sample sizes of the various studies and differences in the doses of the 
investigational product patients were exposed to complicate interpretation and determination of the 
relevance of the observed AEs. Since the safety profile of nebulised tobramycin for inhalation is 
well-known, the first PSUR for Tobramycin PARI should be submitted in accordance to the frequency listed 
in the EURD list for tobramycin nebuliser solution. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.4.7.  Conclusions on clinical aspects  
The pharmacodynamic properties of tobramycin are well known and no further studies are needed. 
The target site for inhaled tobramycin is the lungs where the active substance exerts its effect. Systemic 
absorption is not desirable, low systemic exposure reduces the potential for systemic toxicity. Given that 
the oral bioavailability of tobramycin is negligible, the systemic exposure will primarily result from 
pulmonary absorbed tobramycin.

The pharmacokinetics of TOBRAMYCIN PARI/eFlow has been evaluated in four comparative studies with 
TOBI/PARI LC PLUS as reference. In the first two studies a lower dose than the proposed to be marketed 
dose was given and these are only considered as explorative.  
The overall results of the in vitro characterisation and the pharmacokinetic studies show that 
TOBRAMYCIN PARI is not behaving exactly in the same way as TOBI. However, the in vivo differences 
were rather small and are not expected to have an impact either on efficacy or on safety.  
Pharmacokinetic data provided showed a slightly higher lung deposition of Tobramycin PARI compared to 
TOBI. A higher pulmonary deposition is expected to be beneficial from an efficacy point of view and 
Tobramycin PARI is thus expected to be at least as efficacious as TOBI. In the pivotal study in patients 
(12012.101) the observed treatment effects were overall favourable without clear differences between 
the products. For both products, a significant improvement of the lung function relative to baseline was 
observed for the first treatment phase. This effect was consistent over the various parameters (FEV1 %, 
FVC, FEV25-75, PEF), as well as with the observed decrease in P. aeruginosa CFU. The treatment effect of 
Tobramycin PARI was beneficial in terms of the lung function, in particular during the second treatment 
period.  
Studies 101 and 102 constitute a relevant bridge for safety and efficacy between Tobramycin PARI and 
TOBI in patients 6 years and older with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection and cystic fibrosis. 
The safety findings of the submitted studies support this conclusion. Available data generated from the 
submitted studies indicate a similar safety profile as for the reference product in the general CF 
population. AE reported are mainly associated with drug administration, primarily respiratory, thoracic 
and mediastinal disorders.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a hybrid version of tobramycin nebuliser solution (170 mg /1.7 mL). The 
reference product TOBI is indicated for suppressive therapy of chronic pulmonary infection due to 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa in adults and children aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis. 
Nonclinical studies have not been provided for this application and the literature review is considered 
sufficient. Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of the active substance 
tobramycin are well known.  
The submitted clinical package composed of PK, efficacy and safety data generated by the performed 
studies comparing Tobramycin PARI with the reference product TOBI as well as literature references, is 
considered to constitute a relevant bridge between Tobramycin PARI and the reference product TOBI, for 
which preclinical and clinical trial data are available. Efficacy and safety data for TOBI can therefore be 
extrapolated to Tobramycin PARI. 
With its well-established anti-pseudomonal activity, inhaled tobramycin is a well-known, widely used 
antibiotic for the treatment of pulmonary infections caused by P. aeruginosa in patients suffering from CF. 
The changes in the strength of the formulation proposed for Tobramycin PARI and the new nebuliser used 
(Tolero/eFlow) have resulted in a substantial decrease in inhalation time compared to the use of TOBI 
(approximately 4–5 minutes vs. 14 – 18 min, respectively) through reduction of the volume of tobramycin 
solution that needs to be nebulised and by more rapid and efficient nebulisation using a new technology 
with a perforated vibrating membrane. This is considered to have an important impact on patient care. 
In the pivotal bioequivalence study (Study 12012.101), the administration of TOBRAMYCIN PARI and 
TOBI was compared in CF patients. The bioequivalence study forms the basis together with an open, 
randomized, cross-over, multiple dose bioequivalence study with healthy volunteers (study -201). The 
study designs were considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and were in 
line with the respective European requirements.  
Although the test formulation of Tobramycin PARI did not meet the protocol-defined criteria for 
bioequivalence when compared with Tobi, the study results demonstrate only small in vivo differences   
In vitro, Tobramycin PARI has shown to have a narrower size distribution of droplets compared to the 
broader distribution for TOBI/PARI LC PLUS and a slightly lower mean mass-related medial aerodynamic 
diameter, MMAD (3.8 and 4.5 μm, respectively) in drug mass distribution measurements with impactor 
stages. 
The different particles size distribution is reflected in the conducted pharmacokinetic studies. In healthy 
subjects a slightly higher systemic exposure was observed with Tobramycin PARI compared to TOBI 
which is an indication of a higher lung deposition of tobramycin with Tobramycin PARI in comparison to 
TOBI. A higher lung deposition is considered relevant from an efficacy point of view and the efficacy 
profile of Tobramycin PARI is deemed to be comparable to that of TOBI. 
The overall results of the in vitro characterisation and the pharmacokinetic studies show that despite the 
fact that Tobramycin PARI was not completely equivalent to TOBI, the in vivo differences were rather 
small and are not expected to impact on the efficacy or safety of Tobramycin PARI. 
Although in the pivotal BE study conducted in CF patients the evaluation of efficacy was a secondary 
objective, the observed treatment effects were overall beneficial, without clear differences between 
Tobramycin PARI and TOBI. For both products, a significant improvement of lung function relative to 
baseline was observed for the first treatment phase. This effect was consistent over the various 
parameters (FEV1 %, FVC, FEV25-75, PEF), as well as with the observed decrease in P. aeruginosa CFU. 
Generally, Tobramycin PARI was shown to be beneficial, in particular during the second treatment period.

Long-term use of inhaled antibiotics in the management of chronic P. aeruginosa pulmonary infections in 
CF patients is associated with selection of resistant P. aeruginosa strains. The submitted deposition data 
did not fully elucidate how Tobramycin PARI was distributed in the lungs. An uneven distribution may 
carry the risk that not everywhere in the lungs sufficient anti-Pseudomonal activity can be acquired, 
potentially inducing resistance.  Requirement to monitor for resistance is mentioned in the SmPC (section 
4.4.) 
Available data generated from the submitted studies indicate a similar safety profile as for the reference 
product in the general CF population. AE reported are mainly associated with drug administration, 
primarily respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders. 
Special attention was aimed at audiometry assessment, but no evidence was found indicating that 
patients treated with Tobramycin PARI were at higher risk for alterations due to higher local drug 
concentrations that derive from higher strength of the tobramycin concentration in Tobramycin PARI or 
the enhanced drug delivery rate using the eFlow device. No safety signals could be observed which were 
indicative for effects resulting from faster drug delivery. Potential for ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity are 
identified as important potential risks and subject to routine pharmacovigilance measures. 
Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
Tobramycin nebulisation is presently the current “gold standard” in the management of chronic 
bronchopulmonary infections caused by P. aeruginosa in CF patients. The long inhalation time associated 
with nebulisation is a burden for patients, in particular since they require long-term treatment. Therefore, 
a shortened inhalation time for the tobramycin nebulisation (as is the case for Tobramycin PARI), making 
it comparable to the time needed for dry powder inhalation is beneficial to patients. It may improve the 
user convenience and its therapy adherence and thus clinical efficacy. 
Inhaled tobramycin is a widely used medicinal product with a well characterised safety profile and the 
quality and PK data generated did not indicate any relevant findings that might affect safety. 
Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Tobramycin PARI is positive in the proposed indication.  
Similarity assessment 
Reference is made to Appendix 1 of this report, outlining the similarity assessment in greater detail. 
The existence of orphan market exclusivity for TOBI Podhaler would normally prevent the granting of a 
Marketing Authorisation for Tobramycin PARI in the therapeutic indication of “management of chronic 
pulmonary infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients aged 6 years and older with cystic 
fibrosis (CF)”.  
The applicant relies on one of the derogations foreseen in Article 8(3) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 in 
order to be authorised.  Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, the applicant submitted a 
claim addressing the following derogation laid down in Article 8.3 of the same Regulation; the holder of 
the marketing authorisation for the original orphan medicinal product has given consent to the applicant. 
Therefore, with reference to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, the existence of any market 
exclusivity for TOBI Podhaler in the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection in cystic fibrosis, 
does not preclude the granting of the marketing authorisation of Tobramycin PARI.

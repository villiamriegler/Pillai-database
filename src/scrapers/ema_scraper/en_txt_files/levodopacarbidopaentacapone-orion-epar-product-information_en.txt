CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
Parkinson’s disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations not stabilised on levodopa/dopa decarboxylase 
(DDC) inhibitor treatment.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Posology
The optimum daily dose must be determined by careful titration of levodopa in each patient. The daily 
dose should be preferably optimised using one of the seven available tablet strengths 
(50 mg/12.5 mg/200 mg, 75 mg/18.75 mg/200 mg, 100 mg/25 mg/200 mg, 125 mg/31.25 mg/200 mg,
150 mg/37.5 mg/200 mg, 175 mg/43.75 mg/200 mg or 200 mg/50 mg/200 mg 
levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone).
Patients should be instructed to take only one Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion tablet per dose 
administration. Patients receiving less than 70–100 mg carbidopa a day are more likely to experience 
nausea and vomiting. While the experience with total daily dose greater than 200 mg carbidopa is 
limited, the maximum recommended daily dose of entacapone is 2 000 mg and therefore the maximum 
dose is 10 tablets per day for the Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion strengths of 
50 mg/12.5 mg/200 mg, 75 mg/18.75 mg/200 mg, 100 mg/25 mg/200 mg, 125 mg/31.25 mg/200 mg 
and 150 mg/37.5 mg/200 mg. Ten tablets of Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion
150 mg/37.5 mg/200 mg equals 375 mg of carbidopa a day. According to this daily carbidopa dose, 
the maximum recommended daily dose of Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion 
3
175 mg/43.75 mg/200 mg is 8 tablets per day and Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion 
200 mg/50 mg/200 mg dose is 7 tablets per day.
Usually Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion is to be used in patients who are currently treated 
with corresponding doses of standard release levodopa/DDC inhibitor and entacapone.
How to transfer patients taking levodopa/DDC inhibitor (carbidopa or benserazide) preparations and 
entacapone tablets to Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion
a. Patients who are currently treated with entacapone and with standard release levodopa/carbidopa in 
doses equal to Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion tablet strengths can be directly transferred to 
corresponding Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion tablets.
For example, a patient taking one tablet of 50 mg/12.5 mg of levodopa/carbidopa with one tablet of 
entacapone 200 mg four times daily can take one 50 mg/12.5 mg/200 mg 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion tablet four times daily in place of their usual 
levodopa/carbidopa and entacapone doses.
b. When initiating Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion therapy for patients currently treated with 
entacapone and levodopa/carbidopa in doses not equal to Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion
tablets (50 mg/12.5 mg/200 mg or 75 mg/18.75 mg/200 mg or 100 mg/25 mg/200 mg or 
125 mg/31.25 mg/200 mg or 150 mg/37.5 mg/200 mg or 175 mg/43.75 mg/200 mg or 
200 mg/50 mg/200 mg), Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion dosing should be carefully titrated 
for optimal clinical response. At the initiation, Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion should be 
adjusted to correspond as closely as possible to the total daily dose of levodopa currently used.
c. When initiating Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion in patients currently treated with 
entacapone and levodopa/benserazide in a standard release formulation, the dosing of 
levodopa/benserazide should be discontinued in the previous night, and 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion should be started in the next morning. The starting dose of 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion should provide either the same amount of levodopa or slightly 
(5–10%) more.
How  to  transfer  patients  not  currently  treated  with  entacapone  to  Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone 
Orion
Initiation of Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion may be considered at corresponding doses to 
current treatment in some patients with Parkinson's disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations, who 
are not stabilised on their current standard release levodopa/DDC inhibitor treatment. However, a 
direct switch from levodopa/DDC inhibitor to Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion is not 
recommended for patients who have dyskinesias or whose daily levodopa dose is above 800 mg. In 
such patients it is advisable to introduce entacapone treatment as a separate treatment (entacapone 
tablets) and adjust the levodopa dose if necessary, before switching to 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion.
Entacapone enhances the effects of levodopa. It may therefore be necessary, particularly in patients 
with dyskinesia, to reduce levodopa dose by 10–30% within the first days to first weeks after initiating 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion treatment. The daily dose of levodopa can be reduced by 
extending the dosing intervals and/or by reducing the amount of levodopa per dose, according to the 
clinical condition of the patient.
Dose adjustment during the course of the treatment
When more levodopa is required, an increase in the frequency of doses and/or the use of an alternative 
strength of Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion should be considered, within the dose 
recommendations.
When less levodopa is required, the total daily dose of Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion should 
4
be reduced either by decreasing the frequency of administration by extending the time between doses, 
or by decreasing the strength of Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion at an administration.
If other levodopa products are used concomitantly with a Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion 
tablet, the maximum dose recommendations should be followed.
Discontinuation of Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion therapy: If 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion treatment (levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone) is discontinued 
and the patient is transferred to levodopa/DDC inhibitor therapy without entacapone, it is necessary to 
adjust the dosing of other antiparkinsonian treatments, especially levodopa, to achieve a sufficient 
level of control of the parkinsonian symptoms.
Paediatric population: The safety and efficacy of Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion in children 
aged below 18 years have not been established. No data are available.
Elderly: No dose adjustment of Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion is required for elderly.
Hepatic impairment: It is advised that Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion should be administered 
cautiously to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Dose reduction may be needed (see 
section 5.2). For severe hepatic impairment see section 4.3.
Renal impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of entacapone. No 
particular studies are reported on the pharmacokinetics of levodopa and carbidopa in patients with 
renal insufficiency, therefore Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion therapy should be administered 
cautiously to patients in severe renal impairment including those receiving dialysis therapy (see 
section 5.2). 
Method of administration
Each tablet is to be taken orally either with or without food (see section 5.2). One tablet contains one 
treatment dose and the tablet may only be administered as whole tablets.
4.3 Contraindications

4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use 
-
-
-
-
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion is not recommended for the treatment of drug-induced 
extrapyramidal reactions.
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion therapy should be administered cautiously to patients 
with ischemic heart disease, severe cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, renal 
or endocrine disease, history of peptic ulcer disease or history of convulsions.
In patients with a history of myocardial infarction who have residual atrial nodal or ventricular 
arrhythmias; cardiac function should be monitored with particular care during the period of 
initial dose adjustments.
All patients treated with Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion should be monitored carefully 
for the development of mental changes, depression with suicidal tendencies, and other serious 
antisocial behaviour. Patients with past or current psychosis should be treated with caution.

Concomitant administration of antipsychotics with dopamine receptor-blocking properties, 
particularly D2 receptor antagonists should be carried out with caution, and the patient carefully 
observed for loss of antiparkinsonian effect or worsening of parkinsonian symptoms.
Patients with chronic wide-angle glaucoma may be treated with 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion with caution, provided the intra-ocular pressure is well 
controlled and the patient is monitored carefully for changes in intra-ocular pressure.
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion may induce orthostatic hypotension. Therefore 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion should be given cautiously to patients who are taking 
other medicinal products which may cause orthostatic hypotension.
Entacapone in association with levodopa has been associated with somnolence and episodes of 
sudden sleep onset in patients with Parkinson’s disease and caution should therefore be 
exercised when driving or operating machines (see section 4.7).
In clinical studies, dopaminergic adverse reactions, e.g. dyskinesia, were more common in 
patients who received entacapone and dopamine agonists (such as bromocriptine), selegiline or 
amantadine compared to those who received placebo with this combination. The doses of other 
antiparkinsonian medicinal products may need to be adjusted when 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion treatment is substituted for a patient currently not 
treated with entacapone.
Rhabdomyolysis secondary to severe dyskinesias or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has 
been observed rarely in patients with Parkinson’s disease. Therefore, any abrupt dose reduction 
or withdrawal of levodopa should be carefully observed, particularly in patients who are also 
receiving neuroleptics. NMS, including rhabdomyolysis and hyperthermia, is characterised by 
motor symptoms (rigidity, myoclonus, tremor), mental status changes (e.g., agitation, confusion, 
coma), hyperthermia, autonomic dysfunction (tachycardia, labile blood pressure) and elevated 
serum creatine phosphokinase. In individual cases, only some of these symptoms and/or findings 
may be evident. The early diagnosis is important for the appropriate management of NMS. A 
syndrome resembling the neuroleptic malignant syndrome including muscular rigidity, elevated 
body temperature, mental changes and increased serum creatine phosphokinase has been 
reported with the abrupt withdrawal of antiparkinsonian agents. Neither NMS nor 
rhabdomyolysis have been reported in association with entacapone treatment from controlled 
trials in which entacapone was discontinued abruptly. Since the introduction of entacapone into 
the market, isolated cases of NMS have been reported, especially following abrupt reduction or 
discontinuation of entacapone and other concomitant dopaminergic medicinal products. When 
considered necessary, the replacement of Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion with levodopa 
and DDC inhibitor without entacapone or other dopaminergic treatment should proceed slowly 
and an increase in levodopa dose may be necessary.
If general anaesthesia is required, therapy with Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion may be 
continued for as long as the patient is permitted to take fluids and medicinal products by mouth. 
If therapy has to be stopped temporarily, Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion may be 
restarted as soon as oral medicinal products can be taken at the same daily dose as before.
Periodic evaluation of hepatic, haematopoietic, cardiovascular and renal function is 
recommended during extended therapy with Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion.
For patients experiencing diarrhoea, a follow-up of weight is recommended in order to avoid 
potential excessive weight decrease. Prolonged or persistent diarrhoea appearing during use of 
entacapone may be a sign of colitis. In the event of prolonged or persistent diarrhoea, the drug 
should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy and investigations considered.
Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of impulse control disorders. 
Patients and carers should be made aware that behavioural symptoms of impulse control 
disorders including pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive 
spending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with 
dopamine agonists and/or other dopaminergic treatments containing levodopa including 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion. Review of treatment is recommended if such symptoms 
develop.
Dopamine Dysregulation Syndrome (DDS) is an addictive disorder resulting in excessive use of 
the product seen in some patients treated with carbidopa/levodopa. Before initiation of 
treatment, patients and caregivers should be warned of the potential risk of developing DDS 
(see also section 4.8).

For patients who experience progressive anorexia, asthenia and weight decrease within a 
relatively short period of time, a general medical evaluation including liver function should be 
considered.
Levodopa/carbidopa may cause false positive result when a dipstick is used to test for urinary 
ketone and this reaction is not altered by boiling the urine sample. The use of glucose oxidase 
methods may give false negative results for glycosuria.
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion contains sucrose, and therefore patients with rare 
hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-
isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion 150 mg/37.5 mg/200 mg contains 2.6 mg sodium per 
tablet. The maximum recommended daily dose (10 tablets) contains 26 mg sodium, equivalent 
to 1.3% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion 50 mg/12.5 mg/200 mg, 75 mg/18.75 mg/200 mg, 
100 mg/25 mg/200 mg, 125 mg/31.25 mg/200 mg, 175 mg/43.75 mg/200 mg and 
200 mg/50 mg/200 mg film-coated tablets contain less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per 
maximum recommended daily dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Other antiparkinsonian medicinal products: To date there has been no indication of interactions that 
would preclude concurrent use of standard antiparkinsonian medicinal products with 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion therapy. Entacapone in high doses may affect the absorption 
of carbidopa. However, no interaction with carbidopa has been observed with the recommended 
treatment schedule (200 mg of entacapone up to 10 times daily). Interactions between entacapone and 
selegiline have been investigated in repeated dose studies in Parkinson's disease patients treated with 
levodopa/DDC inhibitor and no interaction was observed. When used with 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion, the daily dose of selegiline should not exceed 10 mg.
Caution should be exercised when the following active substances are administered concomitantly 
with levodopa therapy.
Antihypertensives: Symptomatic postural hypotension may occur when levodopa is added to the 
treatment of patients already receiving antihypertensives. Dose adjustment of the antihypertensive 
agent may be required.
Antidepressants: Rarely, reactions including hypertension and dyskinesia have been reported with the 
concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants and levodopa/carbidopa. Interactions between entacapone 
and imipramine and between entacapone and moclobemide have been investigated in single dose 
studies in healthy volunteers. No pharmacodynamic interactions were observed. A significant number 
of Parkinson's disease patients have been treated with the combination of levodopa, carbidopa and 
entacapone with several active substances including MAO-A inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, 
noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors such as desipramine, maprotiline and venlafaxine and medicinal 
products that are metabolised by COMT (e.g. catechol-structured compounds, paroxetine). No 
pharmacodynamic interactions have been observed. However, caution should be exercised when these 
medicinal products are used concomitantly with Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion (see 
sections 4.3 and 4.4).
Other active substances: Dopamine receptor antagonists (e.g. some antipsychotics and antiemetics), 
phenytoin and papaverine may reduce the therapeutic effect of levodopa. Patients taking these 
medicinal products with Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion should be carefully observed for loss 
of therapeutic response.
Due to entacapone's affinity to cytochrome P450 2C9 in vitro (see section 5.2), 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion may potentially interfere with active substances whose 
metabolism is dependent on this isoenzyme, such as S-warfarin. However, in an interaction study with 
healthy volunteers, entacapone did not change the plasma levels of S-warfarin, while the AUC for R-
warfarin increased on average by 18% [CI90 11–26%]. The INR values increased on average by 13% 
7
[CI90 6–19%]. Thus, a control of INR is recommended when Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion 
is initiated for patients receiving warfarin.
Other forms of interactions: Since levodopa competes with certain amino acids, the absorption of 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion may be impaired in some patients on high protein diet.
Levodopa and entacapone may form chelates with iron in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion and iron preparations should be taken at least 2–3 hours apart 
(see section 4.8).
In vitro data: Entacapone binds to human albumin binding site II which also binds several other 
medicinal products, including diazepam and ibuprofen. According to in vitro studies, significant 
displacement is not anticipated at therapeutic concentrations of the medicinal products. Accordingly, 
to date there has been no indication of such interactions.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no adequate data from the use of the combination of levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone in 
pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity of the separate compounds (see 
section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion 
should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefits for the mother outweigh the possible risks to 
the foetus.
Breast-feeding
Levodopa is excreted in human breast milk. There is evidence that breast-feeding is suppressed during 
treatment with levodopa. Carbidopa and entacapone were excreted in milk in animals but is not known 
whether they are excreted in human breast milk. The safety of levodopa, carbidopa or entacapone in 
the infant is not known. Women should not breast-feed during treatment with 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion.
Fertility
No adverse reactions on fertility were observed in preclinical studies with entacapone, carbidopa or 
levodopa alone. Fertility studies in animals have not been conducted with the combination of 
entacapone, levodopa and carbidopa.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion may have a major influence on the ability to drive and use 
machines. Levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone together may cause dizziness and symptomatic 
orthostatism. Therefore, caution should be exercised when driving or using machines.
Patients being treated with Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion and presenting with somnolence 
and/or sudden sleep onset episodes must be instructed to refrain from driving or engaging in activities 
where impaired alertness may put themselves or others at risk of serious injury or death (e.g. operating 
machines) until such recurrent episodes have resolved (see section 4.4).
4.8 Undesirable effects
a.
Summary of the safety profile
The most frequently reported adverse reactions with Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion are 
dyskinesias occurring in approximately 19% of patients; gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea 
and diarrhoea occurring in approximately 15% and 12% of patients, respectively; muscle, 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue pain occurring in approximately 12% of patients; and harmless 
reddish-brown discolouration of urine (chromaturia) occurring in approximately 10% of patients. 
Serious events of gastrointestinal haemorrhage (uncommon) and angioedema (rare) have been 
8
identified from the clinical trials with Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion or entacapone combined 
with levodopa/DDC inhibitor. Serious hepatitis with mainly cholestatic features, rhabdomyolysis and 
neuroleptic malignant syndrome may occur with Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion although no 
cases have been identified from the clinical trial data. 
b.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The following adverse reactions, listed in Table 1, have been accumulated both from a pooled data of 
eleven double-blind clinical trials consisting of 3 230 patients (1 810 treated with
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion or entacapone combined with levodopa/DDC inhibitor, and 
1 420 treated with placebo combined with levodopa/DDC inhibitor or cabergoline combined with 
levodopa/ DDC inhibitor), and from the post-marketing data since the introduction of entacapone into 
the market for the combination use of entacapone with levodopa/DDC inhibitor. 
Adverse reactions are ranked under headings of frequency, the most frequent first, using the following 
convention: Very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100); 
rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), very rare (< 1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from the 
available data, since no valid estimate can be derived from clinical trials or epidemiological studies).

c.
Description of selected adverse reactions
Adverse reactions that are mainly attributable to entacapone or are more frequent with entacapone than 
levodopa/DDC inhibitor alone are indicated with an asterisk in Table 1, section 4.8b. Some of these 
adverse reactions relate to the increased dopaminergic activity (e.g. dyskinesia, nausea and vomiting) 
and occur most commonly at the beginning of the treatment. Reduction of levodopa dose decreases the 
severity and frequency of these dopaminergic reactions. Few adverse reactions are known to be 
directly attributable to the active substance entacapone including diarrhoea and reddish-brown 
discolouration of urine. Entacapone may in some cases cause also discolouration of e.g. skin, nail, hair 
and sweat. Other adverse reactions with an asterisk in Table 1, section 4.8b are marked based on either 
their more frequent occurring (by the frequency difference of at least 1%) in the clinical trial data with 
entacapone than levodopa/DDCI alone or the individual case safety reports received after the 
introduction of entacapone into the market.
Convulsions have occurred rarely with levodopa/carbidopa; however a causal relationship to 
levodopa/carbidopa therapy has not been established.
Impulse control disorders: Pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive 
spending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine 
agonists and/or other dopaminergic treatments containing levodopa including 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion (see section 4.4).
10
Dopamine Dysregulation Syndrome (DDS) is an addictive disorder seen in some patients 
treated with carbidopa/levodopa. Affected patients show a compulsive pattern of 
dopaminergic drug misuse above doses adequate to control motor symptoms, which may in some 
cases result in severe dyskinesias (see also section 4.4).
Entacapone in association with levodopa has been associated with isolated cases of excessive daytime 
somnolence and sudden sleep onset episodes.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
The post-marketing data includes isolated cases of overdose in which the reported highest daily doses 
of levodopa and entacapone have been at least 10 000 mg and 40 000 mg, respectively. The acute 
symptoms and signs in these cases of overdose included agitation, confusional state, coma, 
bradycardia, ventricular tachycardia, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, discolourations of skin, tongue and 
conjunctiva, and chromaturia. Management of acute overdose with Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone 
Orion therapy is similar to acute overdose with levodopa. Pyridoxine, however, is not effective in 
reversing the actions of Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion. Hospitalisation is advised and 
general supportive measures should be employed with immediate gastric lavage and repeated doses of 
charcoal over time. This may hasten the elimination of entacapone in particular by decreasing its 
absorption/reabsorption from the GI tract. The adequacy of the respiratory, circulatory and renal 
systems should be carefully monitored and appropriate supportive measures employed. ECG 
monitoring should be started and the patient carefully monitored for the possible development of 
arrhythmias. If required, appropriate anti-arrhythmic therapy should be given. The possibility that the 
patient has taken other active substances in addition to Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion should 
be taken into consideration. The value of dialysis in the treatment of overdose is not known.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: anti-parkinson drugs, dopa and dopa derivatives, ATC code: N04BA03
According to the current understanding, the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease are related to depletion 
of dopamine in the corpus striatum. Dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Levodopa, the 
precursor of dopamine, crosses the blood brain barrier and relieves the symptoms of the disease. As 
levodopa is extensively metabolised in the periphery, only a small portion of a given dose reaches the 
central nervous system when levodopa is administered without metabolic enzyme inhibitors. 
Carbidopa and benserazide are peripheral DDC inhibitors which reduce the peripheral metabolism of 
levodopa to dopamine, and thus, more levodopa is available to the brain. When decarboxylation of 
levodopa is reduced with the co-administration of a DDC inhibitor, a lower dose of levodopa can be 
used and the incidence of adverse reactions such as nausea is reduced. 
With inhibition of the decarboxylase by a DDC inhibitor, catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) 
becomes the major peripheral metabolic pathway catalyzing the conversion of levodopa to 3-O-
methyldopa (3-OMD), a potentially harmful metabolite of levodopa. Entacapone is a reversible, 
specific and mainly peripherally acting COMT inhibitor designed for concomitant administration with 
levodopa. Entacapone slows the clearance of levodopa from the bloodstream resulting in an increased 
area under the curve (AUC) in the pharmacokinetic profile of levodopa. Consequently the clinical 
response to each dose of levodopa is enhanced and prolonged.
11
The evidence of the therapeutic effects of Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion is based on two 
phase III double-blind studies, in which 376 Parkinson’s disease patients with end-of-dose motor 
fluctuations received either entacapone or placebo with each levodopa/DDC inhibitor dose. Daily ON 
time with and without entacapone was recorded in home-diaries by patients. In the first study, 
entacapone increased the mean daily ON time by 1 h 20 min (CI 95% 45 min, 1 h 56 min) from 
baseline. This corresponded to an 8.3% increase in the proportion of daily ON time. Correspondingly, 
the decrease in daily OFF time was 24% in the entacapone group and 0% in the placebo group. In the 
second study, the mean proportion of daily ON time increased by 4.5% (CI95% 0.93%, 7.97%) from 
baseline. This is translated to a mean increase of 35 min in the daily ON time. Correspondingly, the 
daily OFF time decreased by 18% on entacapone and by 5% on placebo. Because the effects of 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion tablets are equivalent with entacapone 200 mg tablet 
administered concomitantly with the commercially available standard release carbidopa/levodopa 
preparations in corresponding doses these results are applicable to describe the effects of 
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion as well.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
General characteristics of the active substances
Absorption/distribution: There are substantial inter- and intra-individual variations in the absorption of 
levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone. Both levodopa and entacapone are rapidly absorbed and 
eliminated. Carbidopa is absorbed and eliminated slightly slower compared with levodopa. When 
given separately without the two other active substances, the bioavailability for levodopa is 15–33%, 
for carbidopa 40–70% and for entacapone 35% after a 200 mg oral dose. Meals rich in large neutral 
amino acids may delay and reduce the absorption of levodopa. Food does not significantly affect the 
absorption of entacapone. The distribution volume of both levodopa (Vd 0.36–1.6 l/kg) and 
entacapone (Vdss 0.27 l/kg) is moderately small while no data for carbidopa are available.
Levodopa is bound to plasma protein only to a minor extent of about 10–30% and carbidopa is bound 
approximately 36%, while entacapone is extensively bound to plasma proteins (about 98%) – mainly to 
serum albumin. At therapeutic concentrations, entacapone does not displace other extensively bound 
active substances (e.g. warfarin, salicylic acid, phenylbutazone, or diazepam), nor is it displaced to any 
significant extent by any of these substances at therapeutic or higher concentrations.
Biotransformation and elimination: Levodopa is extensively metabolised to various metabolites: 
decarboxylation by dopa decarboxylase (DDC) and O-methylation by catechol-O-methyltransferase 
(COMT) being the most important pathways.
Carbidopa is metabolized to two main metabolites which are excreted in the urine as glucuronides and 
unconjugated compounds. Unchanged carbidopa accounts for 30% of the total urinary excretion.
Entacapone is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion via urine (10 to 20%) and bile/faeces
(80 to 90%). The main metabolic pathway is glucuronidation of entacapone and its active metabolite, 
the cis-isomer, which accounts for about 5% of plasma total amount.
Total clearance for levodopa is in the range of 0.55–1.38 l/kg/h and for entacapone is in the range of 
0.70 l/kg/h. The elimination-half life is (t1/2) is 0.6–1.3 hours for levodopa, 2–3 hours for carbidopa 
and 0.4–0.7 hours for entacapone, each given separately.
Due to short elimination half-lives, no true accumulation of levodopa or entacapone occurs on 
repeated administration.
Data from in vitro studies using human liver microsomal preparations indicate that entacapone inhibits 
cytochrome P450 2C9 (IC50 ~ 4 µM). Entacapone showed little or no inhibition of other types of 
P450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A and CYP2C19); see section 4.5.
12
Characteristics in patients
Elderly: When given without carbidopa and entacapone, the absorption of levodopa is greater and 
elimination is slower in elderly than in young people. However, after combination of carbidopa with 
levodopa, the absorption of levodopa is similar between the elderly and the young people, but the 
AUC is still 1.5 fold greater in the elderly due to decreased DDC activity and lower clearance by 
aging. There are no significant differences in the AUC of carbidopa or entacapone between younger 
(45–64 years) and elderly (65–75 years).
Gender: Bioavailability of levodopa is significantly higher in women than in men. In the 
pharmacokinetic studies with Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion the bioavailability of levodopa 
is higher in women than in men, primarily due to the difference in body weight, while there is no 
gender difference with carbidopa and entacapone.
Hepatic impairment: The metabolism of entacapone is slowed in patients with mild to moderate 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B) leading to an increased plasma concentration of 
entacapone both in the absorption and elimination phases (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). No particular 
studies on the pharmacokinetics of carbidopa and levodopa in patients with hepatic impairment are 
reported, however, it is advised that Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion should be administered 
cautiously to patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. 
Renal impairment: Renal impairment does not affect the pharmacokinetics of entacapone. No 
particular studies are reported on the pharmacokinetics of levodopa and carbidopa in patients with 
renal impairment. However, a longer dosing interval of Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion may 
be considered for patients who are receiving dialysis therapy (see section 4.2).
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Preclinical data of levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone, tested alone or in combination, revealed no 
special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose 
toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. In repeated dose toxicity studies with entacapone, 
anaemia most likely due to iron chelating properties of entacapone was observed. Regarding 
reproduction toxicity of entacapone, decreased foetal weight and a slightly delayed bone development 
were noticed in rabbits treated at systemic exposure levels in the therapeutic range. Both levodopa and 
combinations of carbidopa and levodopa have caused visceral and skeletal malformations in rabbits.

Parkinson’s disease is caused by low levels of a substance called dopamine in the brain. Levodopa 
increases the amount of dopamine and hence reduces the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Carbidopa

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion is and what it is used for
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion contains three active substances (levodopa, carbidopa and 
entacapone) in one film-coated tablet. Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion is used for the 
treatment of Parkinson’s disease.
Parkinson’s disease is caused by low levels of a substance called dopamine in the brain. Levodopa 
increases the amount of dopamine and hence reduces the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Carbidopa 
and entacapone improve the antiparkinson effects of levodopa.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion is and what it is used for
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion contains three active substances (levodopa, carbidopa and 
entacapone) in one film-coated tablet. Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion is used for the 
treatment of Parkinson’s disease.
Parkinson’s disease is caused by low levels of a substance called dopamine in the brain. Levodopa 
increases the amount of dopamine and hence reduces the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Carbidopa 
and entacapone improve the antiparkinson effects of levodopa.
2. What you need to know before you take Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion
Do not take Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion if you:
-
-
-

medicine (listed in section 6)

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion is and what it is used for
Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion contains three active substances (levodopa, carbidopa and 
entacapone) in one film-coated tablet. Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion is used for the 
treatment of Parkinson’s disease.
Parkinson’s disease is caused by low levels of a substance called dopamine in the brain. Levodopa 
increases the amount of dopamine and hence reduces the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Carbidopa 
and entacapone improve the antiparkinson effects of levodopa.
2. What you need to know before you take Levodopa/Carbidopa/Entacapone Orion

-
-
-

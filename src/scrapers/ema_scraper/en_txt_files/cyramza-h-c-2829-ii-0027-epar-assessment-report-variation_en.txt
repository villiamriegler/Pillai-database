therapy; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.11 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated in accordance.  
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. RMP version 8.1 has been submitted. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0282/2017 on the granting of a product-specific waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related 
to the proposed indication. 
MAH request for additional market protection 
The MAH requested consideration of its application in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) 
726/2004 - one year of market protection for a new indication. During the procedure, the MAH withdrew its 
application. 
Scientific advice 
The MAH did not seek Scientific advice at the CHMP in relation to the current pivotal study REACH-2 and the 
target population of HCC patients with AFP ≥400 ng/ml. However, scientific advice on ramucirumab in an 
all-comer second-line HCC indication was sought in 2009 (Procedure No.: EMEA/H/SA/1505/1/2010/II).

Epidemiology 
Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer and the fourth most frequent cause of cancer-related death 
globally, with 841,080 new cases and 781,631 deaths per year, accounting for 8.2% of all cancer-related 
deaths. In Europe, there were 82,466 new cases diagnosed and 77,375 deaths reported in 2018 
(GLOBOCAN 2018). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents about 90% of primary liver cancers. The 
incidence of HCC varies from 3 out of 100 000 in Western countries, to more than 15 out of 100 000 in 
certain areas of the world, mapping the geographical distribution of viral hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C 
(HCV), the most important causes of chronic liver disease and HCC. HCC has a strong male preponderance, 
with a male to female ratio estimated to be 2–2.5:1. In European men, mortality rates have been stable 
during the last decade (3.5/100,000). Mortality rates in women are 3- to 5-fold lower than men in most 
regions (EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines. J Hepatol. 2018; C. Verslype et al. Annals of Oncology 2012; 
Bertuccio et al. J Hepatol. 2017). 
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP, α-fetoprotein; also called alpha-1-fetoprotein, alpha-fetoglobulin, or alpha fetal 
protein) is a major plasma protein produced by the yolk sac and the foetal liver during foetal development. 
It is thought to be the foetal analog of serum albumin. AFP binds to copper, nickel, fatty acids and bilirubin 
and is found in monomeric, dimeric and trimeric forms (NCBI). The function of AFP in adult humans is largely 
unknown. It is estimated that globally, patients with an AFP ≥400 ng/mL comprise approximately half of 
patients with HCC on systemic therapy, including those with disease progression on or after prior sorafenib 
therapy (Jelic et al. 2010; Zhu et al. 2015; Bruix et al. 2017). 
Biologic features 
An association has been demonstrated between increased angiogenesis in HCC and blood alpha-fetoprotein 
(AFP) concentration.  
Blood AFP concentration has been found to be associated with elevated vascular endothelial growth factor 
receptor (VEGFR) expression, and poor prognosis in HCC (Gomaa et al. 2009; Guo et al. 2012; Mukozu et al. 
2013; Berretta et al. 2017).  
AFP concentration in blood is accepted as a tumour marker and prognostic biomarker in patients with HCC, 
and has been incorporated into several HCC prognostic scoring systems (Pons et al. 2005). Patients with 
HCC and elevated AFP have a particularly poor prognosis, with an AFP level of e.g. ≥400 ng/mL having been 
defined as a poorer prognostic group in different treatment settings (CLIP Investigators 1998; Tangkijvanich 
et al. 2000; Zhang et al. 2009; Mailey et al. 2011). This is illustrated by the information in Table 1, wherein 
median OS is shown by patient subgroup with different baseline AFP level for both treatment arms in several 
phase 3 studies in advanced HCC, both in first- as well as in second-line treatment. Alpha-fetoprotein is a 
continuous variable reaching very high levels in some patients (up to several hundred thousand), and the 
relationship between poorer prognosis and elevated AFP has been reported to be continuous beyond the 
threshold of 400 ng/mL (Hsu et al. 2015; Zhu et al. 2015; Silva et al. 2017). Indeed, the percentage of 
patients with an AFP ≥400 ng/mL in the three second-line advanced HCC studies in Table 1 was 41-45%.

Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Patients with HCC may experience no symptoms until their disease is advanced. Disease-related symptoms 
include anorexia and unexplained weight loss, nausea and vomiting, hepato- or splenomegaly, abdominal or 
shoulder pain, abnormal bruising or bleeding, jaundice and fever. If the patient is cirrhotic, ascites, hepatic 
encephalopathy and GI bleeding may occur. Laboratory abnormalities, other than elevated liver function 
tests (LFTs), include hypercalcemia, hypoglycaemia, elevated serum cholesterol, erythrocytosis and 
thrombocytopenia. 
Management 
Treatment options and prognosis are determined by extent of HCC disease as well as the severity of the 
underlying cirrhosis. The Child-Pugh classification has been used to assess hepatic reserve in cirrhotic 
patients by scoring five variables (serum albumin, total bilirubin, ascites, encephalopathy and prothrombin 
time). Patients with a score of 5 or 6 are classified as Child-Pugh class A and are considered to have 
well-compensated liver disease. Child-Pugh B or C patients have higher scores and a worse prognosis. 
Various classification systems have been constructed to prescribe treatment and predict outcome in HCC. 
The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system is the staging system that is recommended for 
prognostic prediction and treatment allocation in HCC. Intermediate HCC (BCLC stage B) patients have 
multinodular tumours with preserved liver function and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0. 
Advanced HCC (BCLC stage C) patients have cancer-related symptoms (symptomatic tumours, ECOG 1-2), 
macrovascular invasion (either segmental or portal invasion) or extrahepatic spread (lymph node 
involvement or metastases), but preserved liver function. These patients bear a poor prognosis with 
expected median survival times of 6–8 months if left untreated and are (in principle) candidates for palliative 
systemic treatment (EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines. J Hepatol. 2018). 
First-line treatment of advanced HCC 
HCC is recognised as being among the most chemo-resistant tumour types, and until 2007 no systemic drug 
was recommended for patients with advanced tumours (EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines. J Hepatol. 2018). 
Individual treatment decisions largely depend on the stage of disease, but not on its aetiology. Surgical 
resection, transplantation, and ablation are potential curative options for early-stage disease, whereas 
chemoembolisation is recommended for patients with preserved liver function and disease confined to the 
liver generally without vascular invasion. In most HCC patients, the disease is diagnosed at advanced 
stages, when curative treatments, including resection, liver transplantation, and ablation, are no longer 
suitable.  
The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib, was the first drug to demonstrate an overall survival benefit in patients 
with HCC who have not received prior systemic treatment (Llovet et al. N Engl J Med. 2008). Nexavar 
(sorafenib) was approved by the CHMP in 2007 for the treatment of HCC (Nexavar-H-C-690-II-05 EPAR). In 
the pivotal phase 3 SHARP study treatment with sorafenib reduced the hazard of death by 31% (HR 0.69, 
95% CI: 0.55-0.87, p<0.001). Median OS was 10.7 months in the sorafenib group compared with 7.9 
months in the placebo group, i.e. a 2.8-month improvement in favour of sorafenib. 
Lenvima (lenvatinib, also a multikinase inhibitor) was recently approved for the treatment of adult patients 
with advanced or unresectable HCC who have received no prior systemic therapy, and is thereby expected 
to become an alternative first-line treatment option (Lenvima HCC EPAR). This approval was based on the 
pivotal REFLECT study in which lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib in OS in untreated advanced HCC 
(Kudo et al. Lancet. 2018). Median OS was 13.6 months for lenvatinib versus (vs.) 12.3 months for sorafenib 
(HR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.79-1.06).

Stivarga (regorafenib, another multikinase inhibitor) was approved in September 2017 for the treatment of 
adult patients with HCC who have been previously treated with sorafenib (Stivarga HCC EPAR). Approval 
was based on results from the pivotal phase 3, placebo-controlled RESORCE study (Bruix et al. Lancet. 
2018). Treatment with regorafenib reduced the hazard of death by 37% (HR 0.63, 95% CI: 0.50-0.79, 
p<0.0001). Median OS was 10.6 months for regorafenib vs. 7.8 months for placebo, resulting in a 2.8 
months increase. Importantly, patients who were intolerant to sorafenib were excluded from the RESORCE 
study. 
Cabozantinib (yet another multikinase inhibitor) in the pivotal phase 3, placebo-controlled CELESTIAL study 
increased median OS with 2.2 months, as median OS was 10.2 months for cabozantinib vs. 8.0 months for 
placebo (HR 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63-0.92, p=0.005) (Abou-Alfa et al. 2018). This study was the basis for the 
very recent approval of Cabometyx (cabozantinib) for the treatment of HCC in adults who have previously 
been treated with sorafenib (Cabometyx HCC EPAR). 
Notwithstanding the above-mentioned medicinal products, the prognosis of advanced HCC is still poor and 
new treatment options are needed. 
About the product 
Ramucirumab is a human receptor-targeted antibody that specifically binds Vascular Endothelial Growth 
Factor (VEGF) Receptor 2 and blocks binding of its activating ligands VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D. VEGF 
Receptor 2 is the key mediator of VEGF induced angiogenesis. As a result, ramucirumab inhibits ligand 
stimulated activation of VEGF Receptor 2 and its downstream signalling components, including p44/p42 
mitogen-activated protein kinases, neutralising ligand-induced proliferation and migration of human 
endothelial cells (Cyramza SmPC). 
Rationale for ramucirumab in hepatocellular carcinoma with elevated blood alpha-fetoprotein 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly vascular neoplasm (Yang and Poon 2008). Circulating VEGF-A 
levels are increased in HCC and have been shown to correlate with tumour VEGF expression (Poon et al. 
2001, 2003). High tumour microvessel density and increased local and circulating VEGF are associated with 
rapid disease progression and reduced survival (Miura et al. 1997; Poon et al. 2001). 
In the EU, Cyramza is approved for the second-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer (as monotherapy 
or in combination with chemotherapy), locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (in 
combination with chemotherapy), and metastatic colorectal cancer (in combination with chemotherapy). 
The MAH applied for the following indication: 
Cyramza monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who 
have an alpha fetoprotein (AFP) of ≥ 400 ng/mL, after prior sorafenib therapy. 
The following indication was adopted by the CHMP: 
Cyramza monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma who have a serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) of ≥ 400 ng/ml and who have been 
previously treated with sorafenib. 
The recommended dose of ramucirumab as a single agent is 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks. 
Patients with HCC should be selected based on a serum AFP concentration of ≥ 400 ng/ml with a validated 
AFP test prior to ramucirumab treatment. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Ramucirumab is a protein, which is expected to be metabolised in the body and biodegrade in the 
environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products 
for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), ramucirumab is exempt from the submission of 
Environmental Risk Assessment studies as the product and excipients do not expect to pose a significant risk 
to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant did not submit studies for the ERA. According to the guideline, in the case of products 
containing proteins as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), a justification for the lack of ERA studies is 
acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The recommended dosing regimen of ramucirumab for HCC is 8 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 of a 28 day cycle. 
This is the same ramucirumab dosing regimen as for treatment of patients with colorectal cancer and 
patients with advanced gastric cancer. 
The basis of this submission is the pivotal Phase 3 trial, REACH-2 (JVDE), a placebo-controlled study. 
Pharmacokinetic information in this HCC submission includes data from the 4 studies in patients with HCC 
(Table 2). Ramucirumab pharmacokinetics was evaluated by an update of the previously submitted RAISE 
popPK analysis. Exposure-response analyses based on REACH-2 and pooled data from REACH and REACH-2, 
and updated immunogenicity data are also presented.  
No changes have been made to the approved commercial formulations (Process C1 and C2) described in 
previous submissions. 
Methods 
Bioanalytical methods. 
Ramucirumab concentrations were measured in serum samples using a validated enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay as detailed in previous submissions. The bioanalytical method was cross-validated 
with acceptable results. 
Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in patient sera were detected and characterised using modified ELISA formats 
with a 4-tiered approach as detailed in previous submissions.  
PopPK analysis 
Studies REACH and REACH-2 had only sparse PK data i.e. blood samples for the determination of serum 
ramucirumab concentrations were collected prior to infusion (trough) and within 1 to 1.5 hours after the end 
of the infusion (peak) for Cycles 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10 (Weeks 0, 2, 6, 12, and 18). Study JVCQ had rich PK data 
collection in 8 Chinese patients with HCC. 
The previously submitted RAISE population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analysis (see mCRC submission, 
EMEA/H/C/002829/II/0004) was updated with the PK data from studies REACH-2 and JVCQ in patients with 
HCC. PK data in patients with HCC from studies REACH and JVBQ were already included in RAISE popPK 
analysis. Further, PK data from 2 studies in patients with urothelial carcinoma (RANGE [I4T-MC-JVDC] and 
Study 14Y-IE-JCDC [JCDC]), and 2 studies in patients with gastric or gastroesophageal junction 
adenocarcinoma (Studies I4T-MC-JVDB [JVDB] and I4T-MC-JVCZ [JVCZ]) were included in the updated 
popPK analysis. In total, there are 17 studies included in the updated PopPK analysis, the so-called REACH-2 
PopPK report. The final analysis included 11,256 ramucirumab concentrations from 2522 patients. 
Effects of different patient factors, including body weight, age, sex, race, cancer indication, serum albumin, 
AFP, ALT, AST, ALP, TBI, total protein, CLcr, renal function, and measures of liver cirrhosis prognosis and 
patient functioning (C-P score and ECOG performance status [PS] score, respectively) on ramucirumab PK 
were investigated in the PopPK analysis. Covariates were included in the model when there was a >6.635 
point drop in MOF (p<0.01) and a decrease (≥10%) in the relative inter-individual (patient) variability (IIV) 
estimate in the relevant parameter and demonstration of clinical relevance, criterion: 20% influence on the 
PK model parameter. Body weight was the only significant covariate identified in this analysis. The final 
model parameter estimates are shown in Table 3.

Results 
REACH-2 
Ramucirumab trough and peak concentration data following administration of 8 mg/kg ramucirumab every 
2-weeks are shown in Figure 1. Geometric mean trough concentrations at Day 1 of Cycles 2, 4, 7, and 10 
(Weeks 2, 6, 12, and 18) were 23.5 µg/mL (range of 2.9-76.5 μg/ml) (n=162), 44.1 µg/mL (range of 
4.2-137 μg/ml) (n=120), 60.2 µg/mL (range of 18.3-123 μg/ml) (n=69), and 63.2 µg/mL (range of 
25.4-135 μg/ml) (n=45), respectively. Peak concentrations also increased, with a geometric mean of 156 
µg/mL following the first dose and 228 µg/mL following the tenth dose. Trough and peak concentrations 
appeared to stabilise by Week 12.

Figure 1: Summary of ramucirumab trough and peak concentrations for patients in REACH-2 with 
hepatocellular carcinoma following administration of 8 mg/kg of ramucirumab every 2 weeks as an 
intravenous infusion over approximately 1 hour. 
Ramucirumab CL was found to decrease over time, with a mean maximal reduction from baseline of 
approximately 34% at steady state. The decrease in CL was shown to occur rapidly, such that approximately 
90% of the decrease in CL was achieved by Week 12 after start of treatment. Relative to the CL obtained 
from the two-compartment linear model CL model, CL at steady state obtained from the time-varying CL 
model was only 12.3% lower. Steady state ramucirumab PopPK model-derived estimates for time-varying 
CL and two-compartment linear model are summarised in Table 4. 
Table 4: Post Hoc Estimates of Population Pharmacokinetic Parameters 
Body weight effect (baseline range: 30 to 169 kg) was similar to that seen previously, and was retained in 
the current model as a significant covariate due to an updated model selection criterion. Because the 
ramucirumab dosing regimen is based on body weight, there was only an approximately 20% difference in

average concentration at steady state (Cave,ss) when patients in the 5th (47.7 kg) or 95th (99.5 kg) 
percentile for weight were compared with those with median weight (68.2 kg).  
Sex (1722 males, 800 females), age (range, 19 to 88 years), and race (the majority of which were White 
[1768; 70%] or Asian [602; 24%]) had no significant effect on the PK of ramucirumab. 
Renal function was assessed continuously based on levels of serum creatinine [baseline range, 18 to 284 
µmol/L] and Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance (CLcr) [baseline range, 19.6 to 303 mL/min]), and 
categorically based on CLcr classification [normal (N=1031; 41%) and mild (N=1033; 41%), moderate 
(N=431; 17%), or severe (N=14; <1%) dysfunction], with 13 missing values [<1%]). None were found to 
have a significant effect on the disposition of ramucirumab. 
Hepatic function, as assessed by continuous covariates (alanine aminotransferase; baseline range, 3 to 742 
IU/L, aspartate aminotransaminase; baseline range, 2 to 567 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase; baseline range, 25 
to 2210 IU/L, total bilirubin baseline range, 1.03 to 61.0 micromol/L, total protein levels range, 29 to 140 
g/L) and categorical covariates (hepatic function score with baseline levels of normal [N=1683; 67%], mild 
hepatic impairment [N=734; 29%], moderate hepatic impairment [N=28; 1%], and 77 missing values 
[3%]) were investigated for the influence on the PK of ramucirumab. None were found to have a significant 
effect on the disposition of ramucirumab. 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity was assessed in 3059 patients treated with ramucirumab in 25 studies including the 4 
studies in HCC (REACH-2, REACH, Study JVBQ, and Study JVCQ). Across all studies, 94/3059 (3.1%) of 
ramucirumab-treated patients tested positive for treatment emerging (TE) ADAs, and neutralizing 
antibodies were detected in 14 of the 94 patients who tested positive for treatment emerging ADAs. In the 
HCC studies, 10.5% (83/788) patients had antidrug antibodies (ADA) present at baseline; 24/427 (5.6%) of 
ramucirumab-treated patients tested positive for treatment-emerging ADAs, and neutralizing antibodies 
were detected in 2 of the 24 patients who tested positive for treatment-emerging ADAs. Neutralizing 
antibodies were detected in 1 patient at baseline. 
Infusion-related reactions were reported at similar frequency between treatment-emerging ADA+ patients 
(18.4% [7/38]) and treatment emerging ADA‒ patients (13.6% [94/691]). The number of 
treatment-emerging ADA+ patients who reported infusion-related reactions across the HCC studies was low 
(7 patients in total: 5 ramucirumab-treated patients; 2 placebo-treated patients) and with no consistent 
temporal relationship with the presence of treatment-emerging ADAs. The majority of treatment-emerging 
ADA+ patients reported infusion-related reactions at times when treatment-emerging ADAs were not 
present. No analysis of the effect of immunogenicity on efficacy was conducted due to the low rate of ADA 
formation.

• Evaluate the relationship between predicted ramucirumab exposure and selected efficacy outcomes of 
overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) with baseline alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥400 ng/mL. 
• Evaluate the relationship between predicted ramucirumab exposure and selected safety outcomes in 
patients with advanced HCC. 
• Summarise dose modification (that is, dose delay, reduction, and omission) by ramucirumab exposure 
quartile group in patients with advanced HCC. 
Exposure-effect relationship 
The relationship between ramucirumab exposure and OS and PFS was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) 
methods, Cox models, and case-matched control analysis for 2 patient populations, the REACH-2 efficacy 
population and the pooled efficacy population REACH-2 and REACH subpopulation AFP ≥400 ng/mL. 
Model-predicted minimum concentration after first dose administration (Cmin,1) was selected for 
exposure-efficacy analysis. 
The following factors were evaluated for potential prognostic significance using stepwise Cox regression: 
baseline alpha-fetoprotein, BCLC, baseline ECOG PS, macrovascular invasion, aetiology of liver disease, 
extrahepatic metastases geographic region, prior locoregional therapy, reason for discontinuation of 
sorafenib, gender, age, and race. A stepwise Cox regression, with entry p-value <.05 and exit p-value ≥.10, 
was used to identify the baseline factors that were prognostic for OS or PFS, respectively. These significant 
factors were either adjusted in the multivariate models as covariates or used as matching factors for 
evaluating the relationship between efficacy and ramucirumab exposure measures. In the multivariate Cox 
regression analyses, separate models were fitted using exposure measures as either continuous or 
categorical variables (quartile groups). 
Results 
The number of patients in the exposure-response analysis of REACH-2 was 193 for the ramucirumab arm 
and 95 for the placebo arm. A statistically significant positive association was identified between OS and 
Cmin,1 in both the univariate (p<0.0001) and multivariate (p<0.0001) Cox regression analyses for the 
REACH-2 efficacy population (Table 5). 
Table 5: Analysis of Predicted Cmin,1 and Overall Survival (REACH-2) 
For the purpose of comparison with the placebo treatment group, patients who had non-missing 
ramucirumab concentration data were grouped into 4 quartiles (Cmin,1: <25% (4.9-18.9 µg/ml), 25% to 
<50% (19.1-24.5 µg/ml), 50% to <75% (24.8-30.2 µg/ml), and ≥75% (30.2-76.0 µg/ml)).

The Kaplan-Meier plots of OS by Cmin,1 quartiles for the REACH-2 efficacy population are presented in Figure 
2. There was separation between the OS curves for the 4 exposure groups, indicating that quartiles that 
achieved higher exposures within the exposure range of 8 mg/kg demonstrated an association with longer 
survival. This approach did not adjust for the imbalanced prognostic factors among the quartiles and placebo 
group. 
Figure 2: Kaplan-Meier plots of overall survival by predicted Cmin,1 quartiles for the REACH-2 population. 
A multivariate Cox regression analysis was conducted to account for the significant prognostic factors 
associated with OS, including macrovascular invasion (case report form [CRF]), ECOG PS at baseline, and 
baseline AFP (ng/mL). The comparison between the placebo and ramucirumab quartile groups is shown in 
Table 6. After adjusting for the baseline factors that were significantly associated with OS, a significant 
improvement (smaller hazard ratio [HR]) in OS was observed in the Q3 and Q4 groups, and the lowest 
exposure groups Q1 and Q2 appeared to have no improvement in OS with ramucirumab vs. placebo.

Table 6: Multivariate Cox Regression Analysis of Overall Survival by Cmin,1 Quartiles (REACH-2) 
As another way to adjust for potential impact of imbalance in baseline characteristics and important 
prognostic factors between the treatments within each exposure group, case-matched control analyses for 
OS were explored to evaluate the exposure-efficacy relationship. The matching was performed separately 
for each of the 4 exposure quartiles (Q1 to Q4) of Cmin,1 in the ramucirumab treatment group. There were 3 
matching factors to be adjusted for OS in the REACH-2 efficacy population: macrovascular invasion (CRF); 
ECOG PS at baseline, and baseline AFP (ng/mL) (log-transformed). Based on Mahalanobis metric matching, 
48, 47, 48, and 49 patients from the placebo treatment group were selected to match 1:1 with the Q1 group, 
Q2 group, Q3 group, and Q4 group, respectively. 
To compare the 2 treatment groups in each of the 4 case-control groups, Kaplan-Meier curves for OS in each 
group are shown in Figure 3. Separation of the OS curves was observed in the matched Q3 and Q4 groups, 
but not the Q1 and Q2 groups. Cox regression models including the interaction term of treatment by each 
case-control group demonstrated results that are consistent with the exposure response association as 
observed in Table 6 with statistical significant treatment effects in the Q3 and Q4 groups and no treatment 
effect in the Q1 and Q2 groups.

Exposure-safety relationship 
The overall safety population (REACH2 + REACH) consisted of 466 for the ramucirumab treatment arm and 
371 for the placebo arm. Exposure-safety relationship was evaluated by 2 exposure parameters, Cmin,1 and 
minimum concentration at steady state (Cmin,ss). Safety endpoints were Grade ≥3 fatigue (consolidated 
term), Grade ≥3 hypertension (preferred term), liver failure/liver injury (consolidated term; any grade and 
Grade ≥3), hepatic encephalopathy (consolidated term; any grade and Grade ≥3), and ascites (consolidated 
term; any grade and Grade ≥3). In addition, dose modifications were summarised by different exposure 
quartile groups. 
The highest ramucirumab exposure group appeared to have the greatest incidence of Grade ≥3 
hypertension in the pooled safety population (baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL), the REACH-2 safety population, 
and the pooled overall safety population in patients with HCC over the range of exposures achieved by a 
dosage of 8 mg/kg given every 2 weeks (see Table 7). Increasing ramucirumab exposure did not appear to 
be associated with higher incidences for other safety endpoints, including Grade ≥3 fatigue (consolidated 
term), any grade and Grade ≥3 hepatic encephalopathy (consolidated term), any grade and Grade ≥3 
ascites (consolidated term), and any grade and Grade ≥3 liver failure/liver injury (consolidated term), in the 
pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL), the REACH-2 safety population, or the pooled overall safety 
population over the range of exposures achieved by a dosage of 8 mg/kg given every 2 weeks.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Ramucirumab pharmacokinetics in HCC were evaluated by an updated popPK analysis including PK data of 
all 4 studies in patients with HCC. Exposure-response analyses based on REACH-2 and pooled data from 
REACH and REACH-2, and updated immunogenicity data were also presented.  
The observed Ctrough and peak ramucirumab concentrations in HCC were comparable with previous values 
for ramucirumab in gastric cancer (Cyramza gastric cancer EPAR). Pharmacokinetics of ramucirumab were 
adequately described by a time-dependent clearance model. Based on this PopPK, the following covariates 
were found to have no impact on ramucirumab disposition: age, sex, race, and albumin levels. These and 
other factors investigated had < 20 % effect on ramucirumab disposition. Only body-weight was considered 
a significant co-variate of ramucirumab pharmacokinetics supporting the dosing based on body weight (see 
SmPC section 5.2). Because the ramucirumab dosing regimen is based on body weight, there was only an 
approximately 20% difference in average concentration at steady state (Cave,ss) when patients in the 5th 
(47.7 kg) or 95th (99.5 kg) percentile for weight were compared with those with median weight (68.2 kg). 
These results support the body weight-based dosing regimen for the majority of patients. The applicant was 
requested to discuss if capping of ramucirumab dose is necessary because the effect of body-weight on the 
pharmacokinetics is less than proportional. Given the exposure-effect relationship i.e. no benefit in subjects 
with low ramucirumab exposure it was also questioned whether ramucirumab dosing needs adjustment in 
subjects with a low body-weight. In reply, the applicant showed that the percentage of subjects with a high 
body weight (≥90 kg) was relatively low (~12%) and the highest body weight was 128 kg. Patients with a 
high bodyweight had on average a 20-25% higher ramucirumab exposure, however, there was a great 
overlap in exposures with patients weighing <90 kg. To further evaluate if ramucirumab dosing should be 
adjusted for patients with a low body weight, a Cox regression analysis was completed and the relationship 
between body weight and OS and PFS was assessed. Bodyweight was not a prognostic factor for OS and PFS 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/635673/2019

and increasing body weight did not appear to increase the safety risk for all 3 selected safety events. In 
conclusion, dose adjustment for high or low body weight is not considered necessary. 
Hepatic impairment was not a significant covariate in the popPK model. However, only 1% of the population 
had moderate hepatic impairment and no subjects with severe hepatic impairment were included in the 
popPK analyses. Hence, limited information on the effect of hepatic impairment on pharmacokinetics of 
ramucirumab is available (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). Liver failure any grade was higher in patients with 
the lowest two ramucirumab exposure quartiles, which may be related to the apparent interaction between 
clearance of monoclonal antibodies and health condition as further discussed below.  
The relationship between ramucirumab exposure and OS was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods, Cox 
models, and case-matched control analysis for the REACH-2 population. Model-predicted trough 
concentration after first dose administration was selected for exposure-efficacy analysis. As only one dose of 
8 mg/kg was investigated in this study, Ctrough, Cave and clearance are highly correlated. Ctrough 
following the first administration is considered an acceptable exposure measure to evaluate 
exposure-efficacy relations of ramucirumab in HCC, because mean PFS is being reached before steady-state 
has been reached, which would result in bias by drop-out of patients with an early PFS. Therefore, an 
exposure measure following the first ramucirumab administration is supported.  
A positive association between ramucirumab exposure and OS was observed in REACH-2 over the range of 
exposures achieved by a dosage of 8 mg/kg given every 2 weeks. Patients with low ramucirumab exposure 
(Q1 and Q2) appeared to have a shorter survival than the placebo arm, while the quartiles with higher 
exposures (Q3 and Q4) demonstrated an association with longer survival. However, there was an imbalance 
in baseline factors, including prognostic factors, between the exposure quartiles: patients with poorer 
prognostic factors, including ECOG PS (1), macrovascular invasion, etiology of disease, C-P (6) had lower 
ramucirumab exposure. Multivariate and matched-control analyses for REACH-2 indeed indicated that the 
apparent shorter survival in patients with low exposure compared to placebo was due to imbalance in 
baseline factors; however, patients with the lowest ramucirumab exposures in Q1 and Q2 (highest 
ramucirumab clearance) had no benefit from ramucirumab treatment. Only patients with higher 
ramucirumab exposure had a longer survival than the matched placebo arm. It should be noted that factors 
such as presence of ascites, the cachexia-related factor weight loss, and baseline albumin were not reported 
or tested as covariates in the popPK analysis nor in the multivariate analysis. These factors were predictors 
for OS in another multivariate analysis submitted as part of the type II variation 
(EMEA/H/C/002829/II/0023/G) evaluating various dosing regimens (6 mg/kg QW, 8 mg/kg Q2W, 8 mg/kg 
Q3W and 12 mg/kg Q2W) for ramucirumab. Therefore, it is uncertain whether other unknown confounding 
factors could have contributed to the remaining relationship or whether this is a true exposure-response 
relationship. 
It was discussed whether these findings meant that the ramucirumab dose of 8 mg/kg Q2W was not high 
enough to achieve effective ramucirumab exposures. This phenomenon of lower monoclonal antibody 
exposure in patients with risk factors for survival compared to subjects with better disease severity/health 
status has been observed for other monoclonal antibodies in treatment of cancer (cetuximab, bevacizumab, 
trastuzumab, ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab; Azzopradi et al. 2011, Han et al. 2014, Cosson et al. 
2014, Feng et al. 2013,Bajaj et al. 2017, Wang et al. 2017, Turner et al. 2018). For nivolumab and 
pembrolizumab, retrospective analyses of studies with more than one treatment dose, indicated that 
clearance rather than exposure was a significant predictor of overall survival (Bajaj et al. 2017, Wang et al. 
2017, Turner et al. 2018). When evaluating a single dose, a steep exposure-effect relationship was 
observed, similar to the exposure-effect relationship of ramucirumab in REACH-2. However, when an 
antibody is not dosed at the flat part of the dose-response curve, increase of exposure may improve OS (as 
has been shown for ipilimumab [Feng et al. 2013, Ascierto et al. 2017]).

No dose-finding study was conducted for ramucirumab for the treatment of patients with advanced HCC. The 
same dose 8 mg/kg Q2W as has been approved for treatment of advanced gastric cancer was selected. At 
time of approval of MAA, it was uncertain whether ramucirumab was dosed at the flat part of the 
dose-response curve and a post-approval measure to evaluate various dosing regimen was requested. 
Recently, this post-approval measure (EMEA/H/C/002829/II/0023/G) has been evaluated comparing the 8 
mg/kg Q2W dose with 12 mg/kg Q2W for combination with paclitaxel and monotherapy in advanced gastric 
cancer. A small numerical increase in OS was observed in patients treated with 12 mg/kg ramucirumab 
compared to 8 mg/kg in both the monotherapy study and in combination with paclitaxel in gastric cancer. 
The studies were, however, not powered for formal statistical comparisons of OS and the results were 
considered inconclusive.  
In the REACH-2 study for HCC, a relevant exposure-efficacy association was observed for ramucirumab 
which showed that only patients with above-median exposure experienced an improvement in OS, 
compared to placebo, and these exposure-efficacy relationships remained after attempts to adjust for other 
prognostic factors. A treatment effect on PFS was observed for all exposure levels produced by 8 mg/kg 
ramucirumab given every 2 weeks (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). 
Taking into consideration that the included population in REACH-2 is a selected population with a potentially 
relatively good disease severity/health status compared to the real life population with HCC after treatment 
with sorafenib, and that disease severity/health status interacts with ramucirumab clearance.  
As data from trials of other monoclonal antibodies for cancer treatment report similar patterns of 
exposure-response relationships (cetuximab, bevacizumab, trastuzumab, ipilimumab, nivolumab, 
pembrolizumab), one might hypothesise that antibody clearance as predictor of overall survival might be 
generalizable to oncology treatment with monoclonal antibodies. It was discussed if and how ramucirumab 
exposure/clearance can be used as a biomarker to select the population who benefits most from this 
treatment.  Irrespective of whether ramucirumab clearance is a true or a confounded factor, ramucirumab 
clearance is a strong predictive factor for OS. Ackowledging the potential hurdles to implement ramucirumab 
clearance as a biomarker for patient selection,  in clinical practice, given that the same phenomenon of high 
monoclonal antibody clearance with poor survival probability is observed for other monoclonal antibodies in 
treatment of cancer, selection on the basis of antibody clearance may be considered for future applications. 
Exposure-safety analyses showed that the incidence of Grade ≥3 hypertension was highest in patients with 
the highest ramucirumab exposure (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). This was in line with previous findings, 
and the AEs were manageable. There was no relationship between ramucirumab exposure and the incidence 
of other safety parameters, including Grade ≥3 fatigue, any grade and Grade ≥3 liver failure/liver injury, 
any grade and Grade ≥3 hepatic encephalopathy, and any grade and Grade ≥3 ascites. Liver failure any 
grade was higher in patients with the lowest two ramucirumab exposure quartiles, which is consistent with 
apparent interaction disease severity/health status and antibody clearance in oncology. These results were 
consistent results among the pooled REACH-2 and REACH and the entire ramucirumab-treated patient 
population.  
There was no apparent relationship observed between ramucirumab exposure and dose modifications, 
although there was a higher percentage of dose modifications in the ramucirumab treatment group 
compared with the placebo treatment group. 
Like most therapeutic proteins, ramucirumab should not metabolised by liver cytochrome P450 (CYP) or 
other drug-metabolizing enzymes, and is unlikely to have an effect on CYPs or other metabolizing enzymes 
in terms of inhibition or induction (Lobo et al. 2004). Therefore, ramucirumab is unlikely to have significant 
metabolism-based DDI. 
Rates of treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in HCC were low and 
comparable to the rate of anti-drug antibody formation in the entire ramucirumab-treated patient 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

population. Infusion-related reactions did not occur more often in the anti-drug antibody positive population 
compared to the anti-drug antibody negative population. It is agreed that due to the low rate of formation of 
anti-drug antibodies,no conclusions could be drawn on the potential effect of anti-drug antibodies on PK or 
efficacy in HCC. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No dose-response studies have been submitted for the requested HCC indication and hence there is 
uncertainty as to whether the selected dose of 8 mg/kg Q2W is optimal. A relevant exposure-efficacy 
association was demonstrated in HCC, which showed that only half of the patients (those with above-median 
exposure) appeared to benefit from ramucirumab treatment. This exposure-efficacy relationship remained 
after attempts to adjust for other prognostic factors. 
Based on the observed exposure-response relationship in HCC, there is uncertainty whether patients with 
below-median exposure would benefit from ramucirumab treatment. While findings may be due to clearance 
still being confounded by prognosis despite the performed adjustments, it cannot be concluded from the 
presented findings whether the dose of ramucirumab in HCC is adequate for all patients in the proposed 
indication, and this remains an uncertainty. The MAH is encouraged to further investigate the optimal dose 
for ramucirumab in the applied indication. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The pivotal study for this submission is REACH-2, a global, randomised (2:1), double-blind, 
placebo-controlled phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ramucirumab 8 mg/kg IV Q2W as a 
single agent for the treatment of patients with HCC and a baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL after prior sorafenib 
therapy. 
Data from REACH, a global, randomised (1:1), double-blind phase 3 study of ramucirumab in HCC after prior 
sorafenib therapy, irrespective of baseline AFP level, were also included as a supportive study (Zhu et al. 
Lancet Oncol. 2015).  
Supportive efficacy and safety data are included from Study JVBQ, a phase 2 study of ramucirumab as 
monotherapy in patients with HCC who had not received prior systemic therapy (Zhu et al. Clin Cancer Res. 
2013). For completeness, a phase 1b Study I4T-CR-JVCQ (JVCQ) of ramucirumab in combination with 
5-fluorouracil/folinic acid and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX4) in 8 patients with HCC who had not received prior 
systemic treatment, was also included (Table 2).

Treatments 
A treatment cycle was defined for all patients as 2 weeks. On Day 1 of each cycle, each patient received 1 of 
the following treatments (based on the treatment group to which they were randomised). All patients 
received BSC. 
•  Arm A: Ramucirumab (8 mg/kg IV) over approximately 60 minutes; 
•  Arm B: Equivalent volume of placebo to 8 mg/kg ramucirumab (IV) over approximately 60 minutes. 
The initial dose of ramucirumab or placebo was dependent upon the patient’s baseline body weight in 
kilograms. Recalculation of this dose was required in the event of a greater than 10% change in body weight 
from the previous dose calculation; a ±5% variance in the administered dose from the calculated dose was 
allowed for ease of dose administration. Ramucirumab or placebo was administered every 2 weeks until 
disease progression, the development of unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance, withdrawal of consent by 
the patient, or until other criteria for treatment discontinuation were met.  
Premedication with agents including histamine H1 antagonists such as diphenhydramine hydrochloride 50 
mg (or equivalent) was required prior to administration of ramucirumab or placebo, with additional 
premedication provided at investigator discretion. Premedication with a histamine H1 antagonist (such as 
diphenhydramine), dexamethasone (or equivalent), and acetaminophen was required in the setting of a 
prior Grade 1 or 2 infusion-related reaction (IRR). Study treatment was discontinued in the setting of prior 
Grade ≥3 IRR. 
Post-Discontinuation Anti-Cancer Therapy 
Per protocol, there was no unblinding at the time of disease progression. The use of post-discontinuation 
anti-cancer therapy was not specified per protocol and, following study therapy discontinuation, patients 
could receive additional anti-cancer therapy at the discretion of the investigator. 
Objectives

The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate: 
PFS 
Time to radiographic progression (TTP) 
• 
• 
•  Objective response rate (ORR) 
•  Safety profile of ramucirumab 
•  Ramucirumab pharmacokinetics (PK) 
Immunogenicity of ramucirumab

Time to deterioration in ECOG PS 
• 
•  Other patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures of disease-specific symptoms (FHSI-8) and 
health-related QoL (EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5-Level [EQ-5D-5L]) 
Exploratory Objectives 
The exploratory objectives of this study were to investigate biomarkers relevant to ramucirumab, 
angiogenesis, and the disease state, and to correlate these markers to clinical outcome. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint  
The primary endpoint of the study was OS, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date 
of death from any cause. If the patient was alive at the end of the follow-up period (at data cut-off for this 
report [15 March 2018]) or was lost to follow-up or withdrew consent, OS data was censored on the last date 
the patient was known to be alive. 
Secondary endpoints 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included PFS, TTP, and ORR. Assessment for response, according to RECIST 
and assessed by investigators was performed every 6 weeks (±3 days) randomization for the first 6 months, 
and every 9 weeks (±3 days) thereafter until there was radiographic documentation of PD.  
Progression-Free Survival: defined as the time from the date of randomisation until the date of PD as 
determined by the investigator, or death due to any cause. 
Time to Radiographic Progression: defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of 
radiographic progression according to RECIST as determined by the investigator.  
Objective Response Rate: calculated as the number of patients who achieve a best response of complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR) using the investigator response assessments. The disease control 
rate (DCR) was calculated as the number of patients who achieve a best response of CR, PR, or stable 
disease (SD) using investigator response assessments. 
Patient-Focused Outcomes: included disease-specific symptoms and health status, which were assessed 
using FHSI-8, ECOG PS, and EQ-5D-5L. The FHSI-8 and EQ-5D-DL were administered together with the 
FHSI-8 presented first, followed by presentation of the EQ-5D-5L. 
Sample size 
The sample size was determined based on the following assumptions: 
•  Hazard ratio (treatment/control) of 0.67, with median OS of 4.5 months in the placebo arm and 6.7 
months in the ramucirumab arm 
•  Randomisation ratio of 2:1 (ramucirumab:placebo) 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/635673/2019 
Page 28/89 
Classified as internal/staff & contractors by the European Medicines Agency 
 
  
  
•  Overall significance level controlled at 1-sided 0.025 (2-sided 0.05) 
• 
Type II error rate of 20%. 
The study was planned to randomise approximately 279 patients (that is, 20% censoring rate including 
dropouts, with approximately 186 patients randomised to the ramucirumab arm and 93 patients randomised 
to the placebo arm) to achieve at least 221 deaths. 
Randomisation 
Upon completion of all screening evaluations, to confirm a patient’s eligibility, the site registered the patient 
via the interactive web response system (IWRS). Randomisation was stratified by the following factors: 
•  Geographic region (Region 1: Americas, Europe, Israel, and Australia vs. Region 2: Asia [except 
Japan] vs. Region 3: Japan) 
•  Macrovascular invasion (yes vs. no) 
• 
ECOG PS (0 vs. 1) 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was a double-blind study. Patients, investigators, and all other personnel involved in the conduct 
of the study were blinded to individual treatment assignments for the duration of the study. Unblinding did 
not occur until the reporting database was validated and locked for final statistical analysis. Unblinding 
occurred on 23 March 2018. 
Statistical methods 
The analysis of OS was based on a log-rank test, stratified by randomization strata (geographic region, 
macrovascular invasion, ECOG PS) collected by interactive web response system [IWRS]). Additionally, OS 
curves were presented using the Kaplan-Meier method by treatment arm, together with a summary of 
associated statistics. The HR and its two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using a 
stratified Cox regression model. An exploratory restricted mean survival analysis was performed. 
A gatekeeping approach to selected secondary endpoints was applied to protect the study-wise Type I error 
rate and to enable inferential statements; each hypothesis was inferentially tested only if each of the 
preceding hypotheses were rejected. The sequential order of the confirmatory testing after OS in the 
intent-to-treat (ITT) population was: (1) PFS; (2) Time to deterioration (TTD) on FHSI-8; and (3) TTD on 
ECOG PS. 
The following sensitivity analyses on OS were performed: 
•  Analysis of OS based on the PP population 
•  Analysis of OS in the ITT population with an unstratified log-rank test 
•  Stratified analysis of OS in the ITT population using stratification factors as reported in the eCRF 
•  Analysis of OS in the ITT population with baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL based on central laboratory 
result 
•  An analysis of OS adjusting the treatment effect for significant prognostic factors. 
Secondary endpoints were analysed at the same level of significance as OS. 
Progression-free survival (PFS) and time to radiographic progression (TTP) was similarly analysed as OS. 
The ORR and DCR observed in each treatment arm were compared using exact Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
test adjusting for the stratification variables as captured by IWRS. Patients who did not have a tumour 
response assessment for any reason were considered non-responders and were included in the denominator

when calculating the ORR or DCR. Frequencies for best overall response were presented by treatment arm, 
as well as ORR and DCR observed in each treatment arm together with 95% CI. 
The PFS censoring rules are shown below in Table 9. 
Table 9: PFS censoring rules 
In sensitivity analyses on PFS, only one alternative rule was applied as listed below in Table 10, the other 
rules were as above.

Recruitment 
This study was conducted at 92 investigative sites in 20 countries, in three main geographic regions.  
Region 1 included: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, 
Italy, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, and United Kingdom), Israel, and the United States; region 2 included: 
Asian countries except Japan (China, Hong Kong, Korea, and Taiwan); and region 3 included Japan only.  
Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations 
Important protocol deviations are summarised in Table 11. A total of 41 (14.0%) randomised patients were 
reported to have important protocol deviations, including 30 (15.2%) patients in the ramucirumab arm and 
11 (11.6%) patients in the placebo arm. The most common category of deviations was important dose

modifications not performed per protocol (ramucirumab arm vs. placebo arm: 4.6% vs. 3.2%). Violations of 
at least 1 IC/EC were reported for 6.6% and 5.3% of patients in the ramucirumab arm and placebo arm, 
respectively. The majority of significant premedication errors were a result of premedication (histamine H1 
antagonist) not being administered to the patient prior to the infusion of ramucirumab/placebo by the site. 
Table 11: Summary of Important Protocol Deviations 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol was approved on 20 February 2015. The protocol was amended 3 times: Amendment 
(a) on 06 October 2015, Amendment (b) on 13 May 2016, and Amendment (c) on 24 April 2017. Important 
changes made in the protocol amendments are summarised in the sections below. 
Protocol Amendment (a) 
•  Revisions of inclusion criteria to allow patients to enter the study if they had a lesion(s) which had 
previously been treated with locoregional therapy, if the lesion had documented progression after 
locoregional treatment and was measureable 
•  Discontinuation criterion added if a patient became pregnant while on study treatment 
• 
Patient registration and stratification were changed to being collected via the IWRS 
Protocol Amendment (b) 
• 
The addition of an interim analysis for unequivocal efficacy, which was planned to be conducted 
when approximately 60% of the planned OS events (191 events) were observed in the ITT

population, with a planned nominal significance level for the efficacy analysis of 0.0044 (2-sided). 
This interim analysis was not performed. 
Protocol Amendment (c) 
Important changes included: 
•  Removal of the interim analysis of efficacy to consolidate to a single final OS analysis with a power 
of 80% and using an OS HR assumption of 0.67, resulting in a study size reduction from 399 to 279 
patients. 
Changes in the Planned Analyses 
The SAP (version 2) was finalised prior to the database lock and all statistical analyses followed the SAP, with 
the following exceptions to accommodate the data in the final locked database. Given that baseline AFP was 
one of the most important prognostic factors, and median baseline AFP was imbalanced between the 2 
treatment arms in the locked database, the following additional analyses adjusting for baseline AFP (as a 
continuous variable with log10- transformation) were to be conducted: 
1)  Analyses of OS adjusting for baseline AFP with Cox models (stratified and unstratified), as well as 
adjusted Kaplan-Meier curves with median OS estimates at the mean. 
2)  For the stepwise analysis adjusting for covariates, an additional analysis was performed to include 
baseline AFP in the covariate selection. 
Baseline data 
The patient and disease characteristics of the population enrolled in the main study are shown in the tables

Data cut-off occurred on 15 March 2018 after 221 OS events were observed in the ITT population. The 
reporting database was validated and subsequently locked for analysis on 23 March 2018. Primary and 
secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed using the ITT population (with allocation of patients to 
treatment arms considered as “randomised”). The ITT population (N = 292 patients) included 197 patients 
randomised to receive ramucirumab plus BSC and 95 patients randomised to receive placebo plus BSC.

Time to Radiographic Progression 
Treatment with ramucirumab reduced the hazard of radiographic progression by 57.3% (HR = 0.427; 95% 
CI: 0.313, 0.582; p<0.0001), with a 1.41-month longer median TTP in the ramucirumab arm over the 
placebo arm (3.02 vs. 1.61 months, respectively). The 1.5-, 3-, and 6-month radiographic progression-free 
rates were (ramucirumab vs. placebo) 74.2% vs. 55.2%, 50.4% vs. 19.9%, and 30.5% vs. 7.7%, 
respectively.

Sensitivity analyses for OS 
The following other OS sensitivity analyses were pre-specified in the SAP: 
•  An unstratified analysis: An HR of 0.744 (95% CI: 0.561, 0.988) that was statistically significant 
(p=0.0408) was observed, from an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model. 
•  Using CRF data for stratified analysis: A pre-specified analysis was conducted to assess the 
sensitivity of the primary analysis to the source of data for the stratification factors (Note: the 
primary analysis was based on the IWRS data). The stratified Cox model and log-rank test using the 
stratification factors based on the data as recorded on the CRF had an HR of 0.716 (95% CI: 0.535, 
0.958) that was statistically significant (p=0.0236). 
•  Analysis of ITT population with baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL based on central laboratory result:

The statistical significance and magnitude of treatment effect of the PFS analysis were supported by the 
performed pre-specified sensitivity analyses, which demonstrated HRs between 0.434 and 0.488 with 
p<0.0001 across all analyses, favouring the ramucirumab arm. 
Post-hoc sensitivity analyses (not pre-specified in the SAP): 
• 
The applicant also performed a post-hoc analysis in which there was adjustment for baseline AFP 
levels, since an imbalance in baseline AFP levels between treatment arms was observed. A 
multivariate unstratified Cox regression analysis of OS adjusting for baseline AFP as well as other 
prognostic factors (the selected factors included in the final model were ECOG PS, macrovascular 
invasion, and baseline AFP) demonstrated an HR of 0.752 (95% CI: 0.567, 0.999) for the 
comparison of ramucirumab with placebo (p=0.0489).

•  An analysis where adjustment was only performed for AFP was also performed. This AFP-adjusted, 
stratified analysis (without adjustment for other prognostic factors) demonstrated a reduction in the 
hazard of death of 30.3% (HR = 0.697, 95% CI: 0.520, 0.934; p=0.0156). 
Correlational analyses between AFP measured at local laboratories vs. AFP measured centrally were 
performed, which showed high concordance (Figure 9).

Post-Discontinuation Anti-Cancer Therapy 
Overall, similar percentages of patients in the ramucirumab and placebo arms received additional 
anti-cancer systemic post-discontinuation anti-cancer therapy (53 [26.9%] patients in the ramucirumab 
arm and 27 [28.4%] patients in the placebo arm).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
A pooled efficacy analysis has been performed by the applicant in which the main study REACH-2 was pooled 
with the supportive study REACH. In the pooled efficacy population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL), ramucirumab 
treatment reduced the hazard of death by 31% (OS HR = 0.694; 95% CI: 0.571, 0.842; p=0.0002). 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The numbers of patients age 65 through 74, 75 through 84, and 85+ years who were enrolled in controlled 
and non-controlled trials in HCC are shown in the following table. Refer also to forest plot of subgroup 
analyses (Figure 6). In addition, efficacy in patients ≥75 years old (n = 37 ramucirumab vs. 11 placebo; 
unstratified OS HR = 0.617; 95% CI: 0.304, 1.252; p = 0.1771) was comparable to efficacy in patients <75 
years old (n = 160 ramucirumab vs. 84 placebo; unstratified OS HR = 0.776; 95% CI: 0.570, 1.058; p = 
0.1092), and in the overall population in REACH-2.

2.4.3.  Supportive studies 
Supportive Phase 3 Study REACH – ITT Population with Baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL 
REACH was the first randomised, double-blind Phase 3 study of ramucirumab plus BSC vs. placebo plus BSC 
in HCC with disease progression after or intolerance to prior sorafenib. Patients were included irrespective of 
baseline AFP level (Zhu et al. Lancet Oncol. 2015). A total of 565 patients with a C-P score A were included 
in the overall ITT population: 283 in the ramucirumab arm and 282 in the placebo arm.  
While REACH did not meet its primary objective of showing a survival benefit in ramucirumab compared with 
placebo (OS HR=0.866; 95% CI: 0.717, 1.046; p=0.139), in the pre-specified subgroup of patients with a 
baseline AFP of ≥400 ng/mL (n=250), ramucirumab reduced the hazard of death by 33% (OS HR = 0.674; 
95% CI: 0.508, 0.895; p=0.0059; median OS = 7.8 months for ramucirumab vs. 4.2 months for placebo). 
Patients with baseline AFP <400 ng/mL in the REACH study did not experience a survival benefit (OS 
HR=1.093; 95% CI: 0.836, 1.428; p=0.5059). 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria in REACH were highly similar to criteria in REACH-2. 
In the subgroup with AFP ≥400 ng/mL, there was internal consistency across efficacy endpoints with 
improvements in PFS, ORR, and the results of subgroup analyses (Figure 10 and Figure 11).

Phase 2 study JVBQ 
Study JVBQ was a single-arm, open-label, non-randomised, multicentre phase 2 trial to evaluate PFS in 42 
patients with unresectable or metastatic HCC without prior systemic anticancer therapy. Secondary 
objectives included OS, TTP, and ORR. Ramucirumab 8 mg/kg was administered as an IV infusion Q2W. In 
study JVBQ, median PFS was 4.0 months, median TTP was 4.2 months, and median OS was 12.0 months.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The proposed indication for Cyramza in HCC is: Cyramza monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who have a serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) 
of ≥400 ng/ml and who have been previously treated with sorafenib. This target population is acknowledged 
and appears in line with the submitted pivotal study. 
The most important studies submitted in this application in relation to assessing the benefit/risk balance of 
ramucirumab in HCC are one pivotal study (REACH-2), and a supportive study (REACH). REACH-2 was a 
randomised (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ramucirumab 
8 mg/kg IV Q2W as monotherapy in conjunction with BSC for the treatment of patients with HCC and a 
baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL after prior sorafenib therapy. The REACH study was an overall negative study in 
HCC patients not selected based on baseline AFP level, but was hypothesis-generating with respect to the 
efficacy of ramucirumab in HCC patients with baseline AFP levels ≥400 ng/mL. REACH-2 was intended to 
confirm the hypothesis of an OS benefit in HCC patients with baseline AFP levels ≥400 ng/mL. 
Dose selection 
No dose-response studies have been submitted for the requested HCC indication, and hence there is 
uncertainty as to whether the selected dose of 8 mg/kg Q2W is optimal (see discussion on clinical 
pharmacology). The applicant argues that the dose is adequate because a favourable benefit-risk profile has 
been demonstrated in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and patients with gastric cancer. However, 
both in the initial application for metastatic gastric cancer and the application for metastatic colorectal 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/635673/2019 
Page 52/89 
Classified as internal/staff & contractors by the European Medicines Agency 
 
  
  
 
cancer there was uncertainty regarding the adequacy of the selected dose of 8 mg/kg Q2W (Cyramza gastric 
cancer EPAR; Cyramza colorectal cancer EPAR). Also in gastric cancer and colorectal cancer very limited data 
to support dose selection were presented. A relevant exposure-efficacy association was demonstrated in 
HCC, which showed that only half of the patients (with above-median exposure) appeared to benefit from 
ramucirumab treatment, (see discussion on clinical pharmacology). These exposure-efficacy relationships 
remained after attempts to adjust for other prognostic factors. Also in gastric cancer and colorectal cancer 
such an exposure-efficacy relationship was seen. As a result, there remains uncertainty the chosen dose of 
8 mg/kg Q2W for monotherapy treatment in HCC for all patients is optimal. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study design: The randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled design that was used in the pivotal study 
REACH-2 is considered adequate to evaluate the benefits and risks of ramucirumab in the second-line 
treatment of HCC. Overall survival was the primary endpoint of the pivotal study which is considered 
appropriate for the proposed target population considering the relatively short life expectancy. The most 
relevant secondary endpoints (PFS, ORR) were also included in the study, assessed according to RECIST 1.1 
criteria by the investigators. No central evaluation of imaging was performed. Since OS was the primary 
endpoint and the effect on OS is considered the  most important in the assessment of efficacy, lack of central 
evaluation of imaging for PFS/ORR can be accepted in this case. 
The control arm, placebo + BSC, is acceptable in this case as the study was initiated at a time when 
regorafenib was not yet approved for HCC second-line treatment and thus no comparator other than 
(placebo +) BSC was available. 
Patient population: The enrolled patient population is relatively selected compared to patients with HCC 
treated in clinical practice as they had to have C-P class A, ECOG PS ≤1, and were not allowed to have a 
number of comorbidities (in particular cardiovascular) or a history of HCC disease-related complications.  
The inclusion criteria with regard to disease stage (BCLC stage: patients had to be stage C, or stage B if not 
amenable or had become refractory to locoregional therapy) and liver function (patients had to be C-P class 
A) were, however, comparable to those in the pivotal studies of regorafenib (Stivarga HCC EPAR) and 
cabozantinib (Cabometyx HCC EPAR). Both studies were performed in a similar second-line setting after 
sorafenib.  
The overall patient mix enrolled in the current pivotal study of ramucirumab is similar to that in the pivotal 
study of regorafenib with the exception of the selection of patients with high AFP in the current study and, 
importantly, the fact that in the regorafenib study “Permanent discontinuation of sorafenib due to toxicity” 
was an exclusion criterion, while in the current study both patients who did and who did not tolerate 
sorafenib were eligible. Another difference between the two studies is that in the regorafenib study patients 
had to be randomised within 10 weeks after last treatment with sorafenib while there was no such treatment 
interval-related criterion in the current study. However, time since last sorafenib treatment appears 
comparable in the current study and the regorafenib pivotal study (current study: ~50% of patients received 
last sorafenib <1 months ago and ~50% ≥1 month ago, while median time since last sorafenib treatment 
was ~26 days in the regorafenib study).  
Statistical analysis: The censoring rules for the primary and sensitivity analyses of PFS are not in 
accordance with the EMA preferred analysis. Given the difference in reasons for discontinuation (AE, 
withdrawal, physician decision, other), an analysis as per EMA rules could have been less positive and was 
therefore requested (and provided) as further discussed below. Considering having no tumour assessments 
for whatever reasons as a non-response in ORR and DCR is a conservative strategy which is considered 
acceptable. The fact that the interim analysis was dropped, strengthens the analysis of the trial. In addition, 
REACH-2 trial replicates the subgroup result of an earlier trial (REACH). Otherwise, the statistical methods 
used are considered standard and adequate.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Baseline patient characteristics were well balanced between treatment groups, as were prior treatments. 
Median baseline AFP levels were somewhat higher in the ramucirumab arm than in the placebo arm (3920 
vs. 2741 ng/mL, respectively). However, the performed sensitivity analysis in which adjustment was made 
for baseline AFP as well as other prognostic factors, showed a HR in line with the primary efficacy analysis 
and thus the slight imbalances in prognostic factors did not have a relevant impact on the primary efficacy 
analysis. 
Primary endpoint – OS: The effect of ramucirumab on OS relative to placebo resulted in a HR of 0.71 
(95% CI: 0.53-0.95, p=0.0199), with median OS of 8.5 months for ramucirumab vs. 7.3 months for 
placebo, reflecting a difference in median OS of 1.2 months. Of note, the uncertainty in the curves is large 
after around the 9-month time point because patient numbers become very low (especially in the placebo 
arm). The treatment effect for the OS sensitivity analyses (both pre-specified in the SAP as well as post-hoc) 
was in general consistent with the results of the primary OS analysis. 
The clinical relevance of 1.2 months median OS benefit was questioned. Because the enrolled patient 
population appears to be a highly selected population compared to patients with HCC treated in clinical 
practice (who are generally frailer with more comorbidities), the external validity of the results was also 
questioned. The main uncertainty was on whether the already limited benefit will be maintained in clinical 
practice. This uncertainty is mitigated by adequate reflection of the eligibility criteria of the study in section 
5.1 of the SmPC. 
The supportive study REACH, which was the hypothesis-generating study that led to the initiation of 
REACH-2, showed a HR for OS of 0.67; 95% CI: 0.508-0.895, p=0.0059, with a median OS of 7.8 months 
for ramucirumab vs. 4.2 months for placebo. This effect as reflected in the HR is slightly larger than in the 
confirmatory study REACH-2, which could be expected in view of the fact that the selection of the subgroup 
of patients within REACH with baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL was the result of post-hoc subgroup analyses, and 
hence the effect size in this subgroup might be inflated compared to the true effect size. For this reason, it 
is considered that the effect size observed in REACH-2 is more likely to be reflective of the true effect size. 
It is not considered informative to pool the data from REACH and REACH-2. The resulting pooled effect size 
is likely to be also biased slightly towards a more favourable effect size for ramucirumab as a result of 
inclusion of the data from the hypothesis-generating study REACH.  
Nevertheless, and although REACH-2 is the single confirmatory study submitted in this application, the 
results from REACH, which are largely in line with those of REACH-2, do substantiate the observed (small) 
effect on OS observed in REACH-2.  
Acknowledging the limitations, cross-study comparisons can be made with an authorised second-line 
treatment option for advanced HCC, i.e. regorafenib (see Error! Reference source not found. and 
discussion about patient population above). In the subgroup of patients with AFP ≥400 ng/mL in the 
regorafenib RESORCE study, the median OS (mOS) for regorafenib-treated patients was 7.4 months vs. 5.8 
months for placebo-treated patients (∆ 1.6 months, HR=0.677 [95% CI: 0.50-0.92]). This suggests that 
benefit may be comparable between ramucirumab and regorafenib in patients with elevated AFP. 
Cabozantinib is another authorised second-line treatment option (CD issued on 12/11/2018). In the 
subgroup of patients with AFP ≥400 ng/mL in the cabozantinib CELESTIAL study, the mOS for 
cabozantinib-treated patients was 8.5 months vs. 5.2 months for placebo-treated patients (∆ 3.3 months, 
HR=0.71 [95% CI: 0.54-0.94]). Despite the larger difference in median survival, the HR is similar to that for 
ramucirumab in the pivotal study REACH-2. Cross-study comparison should be interpreted with caution as, 
although the studies had similar designs, the patient population definition was slightly different. 
Secondary endpoints – PFS, ORR: The secondary endpoint PFS also showed a benefit with a HR of 0.45 
(0.34-0.60, p<0.0001, stratified analysis), and median PFS of 2.8 months in the ramucirumab arm vs. 1.6

months in the placebo arm. The observed PFS effect therefore supports the observed OS effect. However, 
the PFS main analysis followed FDA censoring rules and, initially, no sensitivity analysis (fully) compliant 
with EMA censoring rules was performed. A post hoc sensitivity analysis for PFS as per EMA censoring rules 
were in line with the original analysis (stratified HR = 0.489; 95% CI: 0.370, 0.646; p<0.0001; mPFS 
ramucirumab: 2.86 months vs. placebo: 1.63 months). The ORR was numerically (but not statistically 
significantly) higher in patients in the ramucirumab arm as compared to the placebo arm (4.6% vs. 1.1%, 
respectively, p=0.1697). The low ORR is in line with what is known from other VEGF inhibitors; their effect 
is likely to be associated more with stabilising disease than actually reducing disease.  
Secondary endpoints – Patient-focused outcomes: The applicant measured different 
disease/health-related quality of life instruments, i.e., FHSI-8, time to Deterioration in ECOG PS, and 
EQ-5D-5L. None of these instruments showed overall statistically significant or clinically relevant results.  
Biomarker analyses: The applicant performed biomarker analyses for VEGF-C and VEGF-D in relation to 
efficacy. No predictive relationship was identified between these markers and clinical efficacy of 
ramucirumab in REACH-2. While the applicant has performed biomarker analyses for VEGF-D and VEGF-C, 
analyses have not been performed for other biomarkers which have previously been associated with efficacy 
of angiogenesis inhibitors including ramucirumab. The applicant provided the results of exploratory analyses 
that were conducted in REACH-2 for VEGF-A, sVEGFR-2, and sVEGFR-3. sVEGFR-1 was not assessed in 
REACH-2. There was no clear correlation between VEGF-A and ramucirumab efficacy outcomes. In contrast, 
sVEGFR-2 and sVEGFR-3 did show a trend for improved OS benefit with lower levels of sVEGFR, but due to 
the exploratory nature of these analyses and the inconsistencies in the results regarding these markers in 
other trials, the value of these biomarkers is somewhat unclear. Therefore, the data is not considered 
sufficient to conclude that these markers are predictive biomarkers. 
Efficacy in subgroups: Analyses of the primary endpoint in pre-defined subgroups were performed. Likely 
due to low patient numbers, some apparently inconsistent effects are observed, e.g. according to gender 
and presence of macrovascular invasion. However, when looking at the subgroup data from the supportive 
study REACH, no inconsistencies are observed in the population of patient with baseline AFP level ≥400 
ng/mL (consistent subgroup effects are observed). Therefore, there are no concerns regarding efficacy in 
specific subgroups in the studied population. 
Baseline AFP level is a prognostic factor in HCC, with prognosis becoming increasingly poorer with increasing 
baseline AFP level (see Error! Reference source not found.). The applicant has shown that baseline AFP 
level is predictive of ramucirumab efficacy, with patients who have low AFP level having no benefit from 
ramucirumab while patients with baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL do. In view of these findings, and because the 
cut-off of 400 ng/mL is in principle chosen arbitrarily, it is important to determine whether the chosen cut-off 
is adequate, and determine what the relative benefit from ramucirumab treatment is for different groups of 
patients according to baseline AFP level within the targeted population, e.g. for four quartiles above 400 
ng/mL within the patient population studied in the pivotal study. Subpopulation Treatment Effect Pattern 
Plot (STEPP) analyses of REACH and REACH-2 were submitted in addition to the associated forest plots by 
AFP quartile (data not shown), to assess whether the chosen cut-off was adequate and to determine what 
the relative benefit from ramucirumab treatment was for different groups of patients according to baseline 
AFP level within the targeted population. Based on this data, it was concluded that the chosen cut-off of 
≥400 ng/mL can be considered adequate and the relative benefit from ramucirumab treatment across the 
different groups of patients according to baseline AFP level within the targeted population can be considered 
similar. 
Special populations: Elderly patients: patients up to above 75 years of age were treated in the pivotal 
study. The subgroup analyses showed that efficacy both in patients above 65 years of age, as well as in 
patients above 75 years of age was similar to efficacy in the overall population.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Although limited, ramucirumab did demonstrate a statistically significant OS benefit of 1.2 months (HR 0.71) 
in the confirmatory phase 3 study REACH-2 in the second-line setting in HCC in patients with AFP ≥400 
ng/mL, without an apparent detrimental effect on QoL. The fact that the patient population in the pivotal 
study can be regarded as relatively selected is mitigated by adequate information in section 5.1 of the SmPC 
reflecting the eligibility criteria of the study. Also, the relevant data on the observed exposure-response 
relationship have been described in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Of the currently approved indications, i.e. the treatment of gastric cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and 
colorectal cancer, ramucirumab as monotherapy is only approved for the treatment of gastric cancer. The 
most common adverse drug reactions observed in single-agent ramucirumab-treated gastric cancer patients 
at a rate of ≥5% and ≥2% higher than placebo were hypertension, diarrhoea, headache, and 
hyponatraemia. The most serious adverse reactions associated with ramucirumab treatment (across all 
approved indications and thus as a single agent or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy) were: 
gastrointestinal (GI) perforation, severe GI haemorrhage, and arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs). 
Patient exposure 
The safety analysis of ramucirumab in patients with HCC and AFP 400 ng/mL, after intolerance to or disease 
progression on or after prior sorafenib, focused on the pooled safety data from the safety population from 
the pivotal REACH-2 study plus the subpopulation of patients from the supportive REACH study with baseline 
AFP ≥400 ng/mL (hereafter referred to as the “pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL)”) (see Table 32). 
In this pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL), the ramucirumab treatment group included 316 patients 
(197 from REACH-2 and 119 from REACH) and the placebo treatment group included 223 patients (95 from 
REACH-2 and 128 from REACH). For a description of both studies refer to section 2.4.2. Main study and 2.4.3 
Supportive studies.  
For completeness, the results of this safety analysis were compared with a safety analysis from the pooled 
population of REACH-2 and REACH regardless of AFP level (hereafter referred to as the “pooled overall safety 
population” (see Table 32). In addition, the results of this safety analysis were compared with the safety 
analysis from the ramucirumab monotherapy-treated gastric cancer patient population from the pivotal 
study I4T-IE-JVBD (REGARD) (Cyramza gastric cancer EPAR) (hereafter referred to as the “REGARD gastric 
cancer safety population”).

As a result of the eligibility criteria for both the REACH-2 and the REACH study, all patients in the pooled 
safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL) had a C-P score of <7 (C-P Class A only), an ECOG PS <2, and only

mildly impaired renal function at worst (creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min for REACH-2 and >50 mL/min for 
REACH). Patients with esophageal or gastric varices that required immediate intervention or represented a 
high bleeding risk were excluded, as were patients with a history of hepatic encephalopathy, and patients 
receiving chronic anti-platelet therapy (e.g. clopidogrel, ticlopidine, dipyridamole, or anagrelide) or 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In addition, patients with evidence of portal hypertension or any prior 
history of variceal bleeding were required to have had endoscopic evaluation within the 3 months prior to 
randomisation. 
The treatment groups were generally balanced in terms of baseline demographics and baseline disease 
characteristics. The median age was 63 years (range, 26 to 88 years), the majority of patients were male 
(80.1%), 35.1% of patients were white and 53.6% of patients were Asian, and 53.6% of patients had an 
ECOG PS of 0. Approximately 86% of patients had BCLC Stage C HCC, 73% had extrahepatic spread, 35% 
of patients had macrovascular invasion, 42% of patients had hepatitis B, and 26% of patients had hepatitis 
C. Patients who were intolerant to sorafenib made up 13% of the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 
ng/mL). 
Apart from baseline AFP level, the baseline demographics and baseline disease characteristics in the pooled 
overall safety population were generally consistent with those in the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 
ng/mL). 
Ramucirumab 8 mg/kg or placebo was administered IV Q2W in REACH-2 and REACH. Treatment continued 
until disease progression, occurrence of intolerable toxicity, or when another criterion for discontinuation 
was met. At the time of the data cut-off date (15 March 2018), 13 (4.1%) patients in the ramucirumab 
treatment group of the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL) and no patients in the placebo treatment 
group were on study treatment. The majority of treatment discontinuations were due to disease progression 
(ramucirumab: 69.0%; placebo: 83.9%). The median duration of therapy was 11.93 weeks (with a median 
of 5 cycles received) in the ramucirumab vs. 7.00 weeks (with a median of 3 cycles received) in the placebo 
treatment group, respectively (see Table 33). The overall duration of exposure expressed in Patient Year 
(PY) was 111.7 for the ramucirumab treatment group and 45.9 for the placebo treatment group. The median 
cumulative dose of ramucirumab was greater than the median cumulative dose of placebo (40.0 mg/kg vs. 
25.0 mg/kg, respectively). The median relative dose intensity was high and consistent with the targeted 
dose in both treatment groups (ramucirumab: 98.25%; placebo: 99.61%).

a Patient is considered to have received a treatment cycle after receiving at least 1 dose of study drug, ramucirumab or placebo, either 
partial or complete. 
b Dose intensity is defined as actual cumulative amount of mg/kg per week. 
c Relative dose intensity is calculated as (dose intensity / planned weekly dose intensity [8 mg/kg / 2 weeks]) * 100%. 
Dose reductions occurred at a low incidence in both treatment groups (ramucirumab: 5.1% vs. placebo: 
1.3%). A higher incidence of dose delays and dose omissions was observed in the ramucirumab treatment 
group compared with placebo (delays: 11.4% vs. 5.4%, respectively; omissions: 28.2% vs. 11.2%, 
respectively), the majority being a single dose delay or omission (single delay: 7.6% vs. 4.5, respectively; 
single omission: 17.1% vs. 9.4%, respectively). 
The median duration of therapy and median (relative) dose intensity of ramucirumab in the pooled safety 
population (AFP >400 ng/mL) were generally consistent with that of the pooled overall safety population, 
and of the REGARD gastric cancer population. 
Adverse events 
In the pooled safety population (≥400 ng/mL), most patients experienced at least 1 TEAE of any grade 
(ramucirumab: 96.8%; placebo: 92.4%) (see Table 34). The percentages in almost all AE categories are 
(numerically) higher for the ramucirumab treatment group compared with the placebo treatment group.

The incidence of AEs in all AE categories in the pooled overall safety population was generally consistent with 
that in the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL) as summarised in Table 31. 
Table 35 presents TEAEs occurring in ≥10% of patients in the ramucirumab treatment groups in the pooled 
safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL). Most of the TEAEs in the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL) 
seem consistent with the underlying disease state of HCC and the percentages of most reported any-grade 
TEAEs were similar between treatment groups. However, any-grade TEAEs reported in ≥10% of patients in 
the ramucirumab treatment group and for which the incidence was ≥5 percentage points higher in the 
ramucirumab treatment group than in the placebo treatment group, respectively, were peripheral oedema 
(29.1% vs. 17.0%), fatigue (24.1% vs. 17.5%), ascites (20.9% vs. 14.8%), hypertension (20.9% vs. 
9.0%), diarrhoea (18.4% vs. 11.7%), proteinuria (17.7% vs. 5.4%), headache (16.8% vs. 6.3%), pyrexia

(12.7% vs. 6.3%), epistaxis (12.3% vs. 5.4%), asthenia (11.7% vs. 6.3%), and hypoalbuminemia (11.4% 
vs. 4.9%). 
The majority of Grade ≥3 TEAEs occurring in both treatment groups were Grade 3 events (ramucirumab: 
43.0%; placebo: 34.1%). Grade 4 TEAEs (ramucirumab: 5.1%; placebo: 9.0%) and Grade 5 TEAEs 
(ramucirumab: 9.2%; placebo: 9.0%) occurred at similar incidences in both treatment groups. Of note, the 
reported incidence of Grade 5 TEAEs is much higher than the reported incidence of deaths due to AEs while 
on treatment or within 30 days after discontinuation from study treatment in Table 34 above. The reason is 
that the reported percentages also included the cases where, based on the AE CRF, the AE outcome was 
reported as ‘FATAL’, where most death events reported by the investigator were attributed to disease, rather 
than assigned as AE. Hypertension was the only Grade ≥3 TEAE for which the incidence was ≥5 percentage 
points higher in the ramucirumab than in the placebo treatment group (12.0% vs. 3.6%, respectively; no 
Grade 4 or 5).

When compared with the known safety profile of single-agent ramucirumab from the REGARD gastric cancer 
population, no new safety signals were identified in the assessment of TEAEs in the pooled safety population 
(AFP ≥400 ng/mL). 
An additional analysis of TEAEs was performed in which clinically synonymous Medical Dictionary for

Adverse events of special interest 
Adverse events of special interest consist of pre-specified selected AEs that are given special consideration 
because they have been associated with other agents in a similar class of drugs as ramucirumab, such as 
agents that inhibit VEGF- or VEGF Receptor 2-mediated angiogenesis; or were observed in preclinical 
evaluation or previous clinical studies. 
The following terms are considered AESIs for ramucirumab: infusion-related reactions (IRRs), hypertension, 
proteinuria, arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs), venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), 
bleeding/haemorrhagic events, gastrointestinal (GI) perforation, congestive heart failure (CHF), wound 
healing complications, fistula, liver failure/liver injury, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy 
syndrome (RPLS). 
No wound healing complications or reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome events were 
observed in the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL). For a summary of the other AESIs reported in 
the pooled safety population (≥400 ng/mL) see Table 37.

≥5 percentage points higher in the ramucirumab than in the placebo treatment group (12.7% vs. 3.6%, 
respectively). 
Infusion-related reactions 
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) includes hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. IRRs were classified 
as either events occurring on the day of drug administration, or events occurring after the day of drug 
administration but prior to the next drug administration. 
Per the REACH-2 protocol, premedication with a histamine H1 antagonist, such as diphenhydramine 
hydrochloride (or equivalent), was required prior to infusion of ramucirumab/placebo. It was recommended 
in REACH. 
The incidence of any-grade IRRs occurring on the day of drug administration was higher in the ramucirumab 
than in the placebo treatment group (9.5% vs. 3.1%, respectively) (Table 34). One (0.3%) patient in the 
ramucirumab treatment group vs. no patient in the placebo treatment group experienced Grade 3 IRRs. No 
Grade 4 or Grade 5 events were reported in either treatment group. No anaphylactic reactions were 
observed. 
The incidence of any-grade potential IRRs occurring after the day of drug administration but prior to the next 
drug administration was similar between treatment groups (ramucirumab: 8.5%; placebo: 9.0%) (Table 
34). There was 1 Grade 3 event in the ramucirumab treatment group vs. no Grade 3 event in the placebo 
treatment group. No Grade 4 or Grade 5 events were reported in either treatment group. Three patients 
(0.9%) in the ramucirumab treatment group vs. no patient (0%) in the placebo treatment group 
discontinued study treatment due to infusion-related reactions. 
Hypertension 
In the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL), a higher incidence of hypertension was observed in 
patients receiving ramucirumab (21.5%) than in patients receiving placebo (9.0%) (Table 34). The 
incidence of Grade ≥3 hypertension was also higher in the ramucirumab than in the placebo treatment group 
(12.7% vs. 3.6%, respectively). No Grade 4 or Grade 5 hypertension events were observed in either 
treatment group. No patients in either treatment group discontinued study treatment due to hypertension 
events. 
Proteinuria 
In the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL), a higher incidence of proteinuria was observed in 
patients receiving ramucirumab (18.7%) than in patients receiving placebo (5.4%) (Table 34). The majority 
of proteinuria events were Grade 1-2 in both treatment groups. Four patients (1.3%) in the ramucirumab 
treatment group vs. no patient (0%) in the placebo treatment group experienced Grade ≥3 proteinuria. Six 
patients (1.9%) in the ramucirumab treatment group vs. no patient (0%) in the placebo treatment group 
discontinued study treatment due to proteinuria events. 
Bleeding/haemorrhagic events 
In the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL), any-grade bleeding/haemorrhagic events were observed 
at a higher incidence in the ramucirumab than the placebo treatment group (25.0% vs. 17.9%, respectively) 
(Table 34). Epistaxis was the most frequently reported bleeding event in both treatment groups 
(ramucirumab: 12.3%; placebo: 5.4%). No difference was observed between the ramucirumab and placebo 
treatment groups in the incidence of GI haemorrhagic events of any grade (7.6% vs. 8.5%, respectively). 
The incidence of Grade ≥3 bleeding/haemorrhagic events was lower in the ramucirumab than in the placebo 
treatment group (4.7% vs. 6.7%, respectively). Eight patients (2.5%) in the ramucirumab treatment group 
vs. 5 patients (2.2%) in the placebo treatment group discontinued study treatment due to 
bleeding/haemorrhagic events.

Liver failure/liver injury 
In the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL), the incidence of any-grade clinical and laboratory liver 
failure/liver injury events was higher in the ramucirumab than in the placebo treatment group (44.3% vs. 
39.0%, respectively) (Table 34). These any-grade clinical and laboratory liver failure/liver injury events 
were predominantly Grade 1-2 ascites (16.1% vs. 10.8%) and Grade 1-2 hypoalbuminemia (10.8% vs. 
4.5%). In contrast, the incidence of Grade ≥3 clinical and laboratory liver failure/liver injury was lower in the 
ramucirumab than in the placebo treatment group (19.9% vs. 26.5%, respectively). The incidence of Grade 
5 clinical and laboratory liver failure/liver injury was 1.3% in both treatment groups. When adjusted for the 
duration of exposure to study treatment, the incidence rates per 100 PY of any-grade clinical and laboratory 
liver failure/liver injury events were 125.3 for ramucirumab and 189.5 for placebo. Sixteen patients (5.1%) 
in the ramucirumab treatment group vs. 10 patient (4.5%) in the placebo treatment group discontinued 
study treatment due to clinical and laboratory liver failure/liver injury events. 
Hepatic encephalopathy is of particular interest and is a clinically significant AE which may occur in HCC 
patients in the setting of deteriorating hepatic function due to underlying chronic liver disease and/or 
progressive disease. During the REACH study conduct, a numeric imbalance of liver-related AEs, specifically 
for hepatic encephalopathy, between the 2 treatment arms was observed from the Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee. Based on this safety finding, the study was modified including (a) inclusion of 
patients with C-P A only, (b) exclusion of patients with cirrhosis (any degree) and a history of hepatic 
encephalopathy or clinically meaningful ascites resulting from cirrhosis, and (c) an additional criterion for 
discontinuation of study drug (ramucirumab or placebo) for the new occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy 
and/or hepatorenal syndrome resulting from liver cirrhosis. The REACH-2 protocol also included these 
criteria, thus among others excluding patients with a history of hepatic encephalopathy. All protocols 
assessing ramucirumab subsequent to REACH, irrespective of indication, were amended during this 
timeframe, as appropriate. 
Any-grade hepatic encephalopathy (including hepatic coma) was observed in 15 patients (4.7%) in the 
ramucirumab treatment group compared with 2 patients (0.9%) in the placebo treatment group in the 
pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL), and Grade ≥3 in 11 patients (3.5%) vs. 1 patient (0.4%), 
respectively. Of these patients, 8 ramucirumab- and both placebo-treated were reported in the setting of 
progressive disease. The incidence of any-Grade and Grade ≥3 hepatic encephalopathy events assessed by 
the investigators as related to study-treatment was 1.9% (n = 6) and 1.3% (n = 4) in ramucirumab-treated 
patients, respectively. There were no hepatic encephalopathy events assessed by the investigators as 
related to study-treatment in placebo-treated patients. Four patients (1.3%) in the ramucirumab treatment 
group vs. no patient (0%) in the placebo treatment group discontinued study treatment due to hepatic 
encephalopathy. In the pivotal REACH-2 study, any-Grade and Grade ≥3 hepatic encephalopathy (including 
hepatic coma) was observed in 9 (4.6%) and 7 patients (3.6%), respectively in the ramucirumab treatment 
group - thus at a comparable incidence to the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL) - compared with 
no patient (0%) in the placebo treatment group. In the supportive REACH study (in the overall patient 
population, regardless of AFP level), any-Grade and Grade ≥3 hepatic encephalopathy (including hepatic 
coma) was observed in 19 (7.0%) and 9 patients (3.3%), respectively in the ramucirumab treatment group, 
compared with 3 (1.1%) and 2 patients (0.7%), respectively in the placebo treatment group. 
Hepatorenal syndrome is of particular interest in the advanced HCC disease setting and was observed in 
1.3% of patients (n = 4) in the ramucirumab treatment group compared with no patients in the placebo 
treatment group. All events in the ramucirumab treatment group were Grade ≥3. Two events occurred in the 
setting of disease progression and were not considered related to study drug. Two patients (0.6%) in the 
ramucirumab treatment group discontinued study treatment due to hepatorenal syndrome. 
In the pooled overall safety population the incidence of AESIs in all categories was generally consistent with 
that in the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL) as summarised in Table 37. When compared with the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

known safety profile of ramucirumab (as monotherapy) in the REGARD gastric cancer population, the 
incidence of the AESIs hypertension and proteinuria were higher in the ramucirumab treatment group in the 
pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL), so was the incidence of the AESIs bleeding/haemorrhagic 
events and liver failure/liver injury but these two in both treatment groups (which could be expected given 
the HCC disease setting). The incidence of the AESI infusion-related reactions was higher than in the 
REGARD gastric cancer population, but was similar to the incidence observed in ramucirumab phase 2 
gastric cancer studies, i.e. 11.5%. 
Adverse drug reactions 
For the monotherapy and combination therapy ADR tables in section 4.8 of the SmPC, the MAH integrated 
the safety data from the clinical database of the pivotal phase 3 clinical trials for the currently approved 
indications and HCC, as appropriate based on the trial study treatment regimen. These safety data for each 
clinical study were created at their primary outcome analyses. 
The monotherapy ADR table is based on the pooled safety cohort comprising of 2 datasets of single-agent 
ramucirumab from Phase 3 studies: REGARD (I4T-IE-JVBD) and REACH-2 (I4TMC-JVDE)/REACH 
(I4T-IE-JVBF) (alpha fetoprotein ≥400 ng/mL).

The combination therapy ADR table is based on the pooled safety cohort comprising of 3 Phase 3 clinical 
trials in licensed indications in which ramucirumab is used in combination with chemotherapy: RAINBOW

safety cohorts, respectively. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Table 40 presents SAEs occurring in ≥1% of patients in the ramucirumab treatment group in the pooled

any-grade SAEs (ramucirumab: 35.4%; placebo: 33.6%) and Grade ≥3 SAEs (ramucirumab: 27.8%; 
placebo: 30.0%). No individual SAE occurred at higher incidence and with a difference of ≥2% in the 
ramucirumab group compared with placebo. In both treatment groups, all SAE terms were reported at an

a In REACH, malignant neoplasm progression could be entered by investigators as an adverse event regardless of whether this was  
considered related to study treatment. However, in REACH-2, malignant neoplasm progression was not considered as an adverse event 
unless related to study treatment. 
The evaluation of SAEs in the pooled overall safety population was generally consistent with that in the 
pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL). In the REGARD gastric cancer population the incidence of SAEs 
was higher in both treatment groups (ramucirumab: 44.9%; placebo: 44.3%) than in the pooled safety 
population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL). 
Deaths in the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL) are summarised in Table 41. The incidence of 
deaths while on treatment or within 30 days after discontinuation from study treatment was 15.8% in the 
ramucirumab treatment group and 11.2% in the placebo treatment group, but the percentage of deaths due 
to AEs was similar (ramucirumab: 3.2%; placebo: 2.7%) and the majority of the deaths were due to disease 
progression, as reported by the investigator. The incidence of deaths due to AEs that occurred on treatment 
or within 30 days of after discontinuation from study treatment was similar in both treatment groups 
(ramucirumab: 3.2%; placebo: 2.7%). The AEs that lead to death in the ramucirumab treatment group were 
pneumonia (n = 2), acute kidney injury (n = 1), asthenia (n = 1), generalised oedema (n = 1), hepatorenal 
syndrome (n = 1), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (n = 1), myocardial infarction (n = 1), renal failure

The evaluation of deaths and deaths due to TEAEs in the pooled overall safety population was generally 
consistent with that in the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL). In the REGARD gastric cancer 
population the incidence of death due to an AE while on treatment or within 30 days after discontinuation 
from study treatment was higher in both treatment groups (ramucirumab: 9.3%; placebo: 13.0%) than in 
the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL). 
Laboratory findings 
Low-grade (Grade 1-2) abnormalities were noted in baseline levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase in a high proportion of patients in both 
treatment groups, and similar shifts were observed in these parameters. 
Safety in special populations 
Additional analyses for the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL) summarising TEAEs by subgroups, 
including age, gender, race, and geographic region are provided in Table 42.  
Regarding the special patient population with impaired hepatic/renal function, the eligibility criteria for both 
the REACH-2 and the REACH study included: total bilirubin ≤1.5 times upper limit of institutional normal 
value (ULN), aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤5 × ULN, and creatinine 
clearance ≥60 mL/min for REACH-2 and >50 mL/min for REACH.

Age 
The pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL) included 44.0% patients aged ≥65 years, 14.5% patients 
aged ≥75 years (n = 78), and 0.6% patients aged ≥85 years (n = 3). As shown in Table 43, in both 
treatment groups, patients aged ≥65 years had a higher incidence of both any-grade as well as Grade ≥3 
events compared with those aged <65 years, but within each age group the difference in incidence between 
treatment groups was similar. Table 43 provides a summary of safety by age intervals (<65, 65-74, 75-84, 
and ≥85 years) for the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL). Herein over twice as high percentages 
are reported for patients aged 75-84 in the ramucirumab treatment group when compared to the placebo

in patients aged 75 to 84 years, occurred in a single patient only, and (thus) no specific type(s) of AEs

Gender 
The pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL) included 80.1% male and 19.9% female patients. In Table 
42 the difference between the percentages of reported any-grade TEAEs for the ramucirumab- vs. the 
placebo-treated group is similar for male and female patients. For male patients the percentage of reported 
Grade ≥3 TEAEs was almost identical for the ramucirumab- vs. the placebo-treated group with 55.3% vs. 
55.4%, respectively.  
For female patients the percentage of reported Grade ≥3 TEAEs was much higher for the 
ramucirumab-treated group (64.3%) than for the placebo-treated group (35.1%). This difference in the 
percentage of reported Grade ≥3 TEAEs was due to differences in the percentages of the Grade 3 TEAEs 
hypertension, hyponatremia, ascites, general physical health deterioration, and thrombocytopenia. 
However, apart from a 6.3% difference between genders for hyponatraemia (ramucirumab-treated female

patients: 10.0%; ramucirumab-treated male patients: 3.7%), the differences in incidence of these Grade 3 
TEAEs between female and male patients were all <5%. The differences between both treatment groups in 
reported incidence of SAEs, discontinuations due to (S)AEs, and deaths due to AEs were similar for male and 
female patients. 
No full overview of AEs by gender was provided for the pooled overall safety population. No relevant 
differences in type or frequency of TEAEs were seen among subgroups defined by gender in the REGARD 
gastric cancer population. 
Immunological events 
Rates of treatment-emergent (TE) anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) and neutralizing antibodies were low in the 
HCC studies REACH-2 and REACH, as 18/402 (4.5%) of ramucirumab-treated patients tested positive for TE 
ADAs, and neutralizing antibodies were detected in one of the 18 ramucirumab-treated patients who tested 
positive for TE ADAs (1/402 = 0.2% overall). In studies REACH-2 and REACH the number of TE ADA+ 
ramucirumab-treated patients who reported infusion-related reactions (IRRs) was very low, i.e. 2 and 1 
patient(s), respectively. No anaphylactic reactions were observed among TE ADA+ ramucirumab-treated 
patients. Refer to section 5.3.2. Pharmacokinetics - Immunogenicity for more information on this matter. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies were conducted to support this submission of ramucirumab as 
a monotherapy in HCC patients.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL), the overall incidence of TEAEs leading to the 
discontinuation of study treatment was higher in the ramucirumab compared with the placebo treatment 
group (16.5% vs. 10.3%, respectively). The most commonly reported TEAE (any-grade) for ramucirumab 
was the AESI proteinuria (ramucirumab: 1.9%; placebo: 0%), and for placebo it was oesophagus varices 
haemorrhage (placebo: 1.8%; ramucirumab: 1.3%). Consistent with protocol guidelines in REACH-2 and in 
REACH, 4 (1.3%) patients, all in the ramucirumab treatment group, discontinued treatment due to the AESI 
hepatic encephalopathy, and 2 (0.6%) patients, all in the ramucirumab treatment group, discontinued 
treatment due to the AESI hepatorenal syndrome. 
The incidence and types of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment in the pooled overall safety 
population were generally consistent with those in the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL). In the 
REGARD gastric cancer population the incidence of discontinuations due to an AE was somewhat lower in 
both treatment groups (ramucirumab: 10.5%; placebo: 6.0%) than in the pooled safety population (AFP 
≥400 ng/mL). 
The overall incidence of TEAEs leading to dose adjustment (i.e. dose reductions, dose delays, dose 
omissions) was higher in the ramucirumab compared with the placebo treatment group (any Grade: 30.4% 
vs. 13.5%, respectively; Grade ≥3: 16.5% vs. 9.4%, respectively). The most common (occurring in ≥2% of 
patients) any-grade TEAEs leading to dose adjustment were hypertension (4.7% vs. 0.4%, respectively), 
proteinuria (3.5% vs. 0%, respectively), and ascites (2.2% vs. 0.6%, respectively). 
Post marketing experience 
Ramucirumab was first authorised in 2014 and is currently approved in several regions, including the 
European Union, the United States and Japan, both as a single agent and in combination with different 
chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of gastric cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal

cancer. Cumulatively, as of 21 April 2018, approximately 6086 patients have received ramucirumab in the 
ramucirumab clinical program. An estimated 1368 patients received single-agent ramucirumab and 4718 
patients received ramucirumab in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. Also, as of 30 April 2018, 
cumulatively an estimated 75,800 patients have received ramucirumab worldwide. The latest periodic safety 
update report (PSUR) from ramucirumab summarised safety and other pertinent data up to 21 April 2018, 
and the PSUR review confirmed the previously established favorable benefit-risk profile for ramucirumab in 
the currently approved indications. No off-label use events have been reported for the use of ramucirumab 
for the treatment of HCC. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety analysis of ramucirumab in patients with HCC and AFP 400 ng/mL, after intolerance to or disease 
progression on or after prior sorafenib, focused on the pooled safety data from the safety population from 
the pivotal REACH-2 study plus the subpopulation of patients from the supportive REACH study with baseline 
AFP ≥400 ng/mL, i.e. the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL). The results of this safety analysis 
were compared with the gastric cancer safety population from the ramucirumab monotherapy-treated 
gastric cancer patient population in the pivotal REGARD study (Cyramza gastric cancer EPAR). 
It should be noted that as a result of the eligibility criteria for both the REACH-2 and the REACH study, all 
patients in the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL) had a C-P score <7 (C-P class A only), an ECOG 
PS ≤1, and only mildly impaired renal function at worst (creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min for REACH-2 and 
>50 mL/min for REACH). The to-be-treated patient population in clinical practice is expected to include more 
frail patients with e.g. ECOG PS of 2 and/or more impaired renal function and more comorbidities. Therefore, 
it is uncertain if the observed toxicity in the selected pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL) is truly 
representative of the to-be-treated patient population. The eligibility criteria of the pivotal regorafenib 
RESORCE study (Stivarga HCC EPAR) and the pivotal cabozantinib CELESTIAL study (Abou-Alfa et al. N Engl 
J Med. 2018) were generally similar to the main ramucirumab studies (REACH and REACH-2), as they also 
included a C-P score <7 and an ECOG PS ≤1. In contrast to the two ramucirumab studies, in both the 
RESORCE study as well as in the CELESTIAL study patients with a history of hepatic encephalopathy and 
patients receiving chronic anti-platelet therapy (including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) were 
allowed to enrol, as were patients with moderately impaired renal function. 
The median duration of therapy was rather short but longer in the ramucirumab treatment group compared 
to the placebo treatment group. The rather short duration of therapy prevents assessment of the long-term 
safety, but is in accordance with the observed relatively short PFS in this setting. 
Overall, there were no unexpected findings in the assessment of TEAEs, with the known ADRs peripheral 
oedema (ramucirumab: 29.1%; placebo 17.0%), hypertension (ramucirumab: 21.5%; placebo 9.0%), 
proteinuria (ramucirumab: 18.7%; placebo 5.4%), headache (ramucirumab: 16.8%; placebo 6.3%), and 
thrombocytopenia (ramucirumab: 14.9%; placebo 4.5%) being among the most frequently reported 
(any-Grade) TEAEs with ramucirumab. Hypertension was the only Grade ≥3 TEAE with a ≥5 percentage 
points higher incidence for ramucirumab (12.0%) than placebo (3.6%). 
Most patients experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event of any grade, and the majority 
experienced Grade ≥3 events. Most TEAEs seem consistent with the underlying disease state of HCC and the 
percentages of most reported any-grade TEAEs were similar between treatment groups. When compared 
with the known safety profile of single-agent ramucirumab from the REGARD gastric cancer population, no 
new safety signals were identified, although the incidence of the adverse events of special interest 
hypertension and proteinuria was higher in the ramucirumab treatment group in the HCC pooled safety 
population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL). The incidence of the AESIs bleeding/haemorrhagic events and liver 
failure/liver injury was higher in both HCC treatment groups when compared with the REGARD gastric 
cancer population, as could be expected given the HCC disease setting. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/635673/2019 
Page 71/89

Regarding the AESI bleeding/haemorrhagic events, even though the incidence of any-Grade events was 
higher in the ramucirumab than in the placebo treatment group, it was the other way round for Grade ≥3 
events. Then again, patients with oesophageal or gastric varices that required immediate intervention or 
represented a high bleeding risk were excluded from REACH-2 and REACH and thus the pooled safety 
population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL), and patients with evidence of portal hypertension or any prior history of 
variceal bleeding were only allowed to enrol if they had been screened by endoscopic evaluation within the 
3 months immediately prior to randomisation. Moreover, patients receiving chronic anti-platelet therapy 
(including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) were excluded, and the to-be-treated patient population in 
clinical practice may be expected to include patients receiving these medications. Therefore, the incidence of 
bleeding/haemorrhagic events to be expected in clinical practice is uncertain, and may be higher. A 
precautionary statement in section 4.4 of the SmPC is deemed necessary, stating that for HCC patients with 
evidence of portal hypertension or prior history of oesophageal variceal bleeding, screening for and 
treatment of oesophageal varices should be performed as per standard of care before starting ramucirumab 
treatment. 
Regarding the AESI liver failure/liver injury, even though the incidence of any-Grade events was higher in 
the ramucirumab than in the placebo treatment group, it was the other way round for Grade ≥3 events. 
Although infrequent, hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome were observed at a higher 
incidence in ramucirumab than in placebo-treated patients. However, approximately half of the events in the 
ramucirumab treatment group were reported in the setting of progressive disease and thus were not 
necessarily related to study drug. While patients with a history of hepatic encephalopathy were excluded 
from REACH-2 and REACH, and thus from the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL), the to-be-treated 
patient population in clinical practice may be expected to include patients with a history of hepatic 
encephalopathy. Therefore, the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy to be expected in clinical practice is 
more uncertain.  
The eligibility criteria of REACH were amended to prevent hepatic encephalopathy only after a numeric 
imbalance of liver-related AEs, specifically for hepatic encephalopathy, had been observed between the 2 
treatment arms from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee. The same, strict eligibility criteria were 
thereafter applied in REACH-2. Probably as a result thereof, the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy was 
numerically lower in both treatment groups of REACH-2 when compared with both treatment groups of 
REACH. However, in REACH-2 the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy was still higher in ramucirumab than 
in placebo-treated patients, and the difference between both treatment groups was similar for REACH-2 and 
REACH (REACH-2: +4.6 percentage points; REACH: +5.9 percentage points). Moreover, the incidence of 
Grade ≥3 hepatic encephalopathy in the ramucirumab treatment group in REACH-2 was also higher than 
that in the ramucirumab treatment group in REACH (REACH-2: 3.6%; REACH: 3.3%). Therefore, the more 
strict eligibility criteria could not negate the increase in hepatic encephalopathy caused by ramucirumab 
treatment. In general, it can be concluded that an increased severity of underlying liver disease as assessed 
by C-P class status at baseline suggests a greater risk of occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy while 
receiving ramucirumab, and other precipitating factors appear to be related to the underlying cancer and 
general condition of the patients. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of hepatic 
encephalopathy. Ramucirumab should be permanently discontinued in the event of hepatic encephalopathy 
or hepatorenal syndrome (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). Hepatic encephalopathy in patients 
with HCC has been added as an important identified risk to the list of safety concerns (see RMP). 
The adverse drug reactions (ADRs) proposed by the MAH in section 4.8 of the SmPC are acceptable. Of note, 
separate tables of ADRs were previously reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC for each approved 
indication/pivotal study. During the procedure and further to the CHMP request, the MAH has presented 
ADRs in two tables, i.e. one with all ADRs for ramucirumab when administered as monotherapy (which 
include the ADRs observed in the pooled safety population [AFP ≥400 ng/mL] in this procedure), and one 
with all ADRs for ramucirumab when administered in combination with chemotherapy. Due to differences in 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/635673/2019 
Page 72/89 
Classified as internal/staff & contractors by the European Medicines Agency 
 
  
  
safety profile between ramucirumab monotherapy and ramucirumab in combination with chemotherapy, 
two separate tables are acceptable in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
A similar percentage of patients in both treatment groups had any-grade serious adverse events. The 
incidence of death (while on treatment or within 30 days after discontinuation from study treatment) was 
higher in the ramucirumab treatment group than in the placebo treatment group, but the percentage of 
deaths due to AEs was similar. However, it should also be taken into account that the median duration of 
therapy was longer in the ramucirumab treatment group compared with the placebo treatment group. 
Therefore, a higher incidence of death in the ramucirumab treatment group is not unexpected. Moreover, 
the incidence of death due to an AE was lower (in both treatment groups) than in the REGARD gastric cancer 
population. 
Regarding laboratory findings, the assessments of analyses for haematology and serum chemistry 
laboratory toxicity shifts from baseline to worst grade post-baseline were consistent with the AE data. 
Low-grade (Grade 1-2) abnormalities were noted in baseline levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase in a high proportion of patients in both 
treatment groups, and similar shifts were observed in these parameters. 
Regarding the safety in special populations, a summary of selected AEs by age interval showed over twice as 
high percentages for several selected AEs for patients aged 75-84 in the ramucirumab treatment group (n = 
49) when compared to the placebo treatment group (n = 26), whereas no such differences were apparent for 
the other age categories. However, no specific type(s) of AEs caused the observed differences. Therefore, 
the observed differences could simply be due to chance, due to the relatively small number of 
placebo-treated patients aged 75-84.  
In addition, for female patients the percentage of reported Grade ≥3 TEAEs was much higher for the 
ramucirumab-treated group than for the placebo-treated group, whereas for male patients the percentage 
was almost identical for both treatment groups. This difference in the percentage of reported Grade ≥3 
TEAEs was due to differences in the percentages of the Grade 3 TEAEs hypertension, hyponatremia, ascites, 
general physical health deterioration, and thrombocytopenia. Importantly however, apart from a 6.3% 
difference between genders for hyponatraemia, the differences in incidence of these Grade 3 TEAEs between 
female and male patients were all <5%. Also, the differences between both treatment groups in reported 
incidence of SAEs, discontinuations due to (S)AEs, and deaths due to AEs were similar for male and female 
patients. It remains unclear why the percentage of reported Grade ≥3 TEAEs in placebo-treated female 
patients was rather low, i.e. 20% lower than in placebo-treated male patients, but this might simply be due 
to the limited number of female patients in the placebo group. 
Analyses in special populations showed no meaningful differences in the TEAE profile with respect to race, or 
between different geographic regions. 
Regarding immunological events, rates of treatment-emergent (TE) anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) and 
neutralising antibodies in the REACH-2 and REACH studies were low and very low, respectively. 
The overall incidence of TEAEs leading to the discontinuation of study treatment was higher in the 
ramucirumab compared with the placebo treatment group. The discontinuation rate of 1 in 6 
ramucirumab-treated patients could be considered acceptable, but was higher than the rate of 1 in 10 in the 
REGARD gastric cancer population. 
When compared with other second-line treatment options for advanced HCC, i.e. regorafenib and 
cabozantinib, the safety profile of ramucirumab as observed in the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 
ng/mL) could be considered somewhat more favourable, though with the caveat of cross-study 
comparisons. The incidence of hepatic encephalopathy with ramucirumab was 4.7% and 3.5% in the pooled 
safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL) for both any-Grade as well as Grade≥3 respectively). The eligibility 
criteria of REACH were amended to exclude patients with a history of hepatic encephalopathy, and these 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

patients were also excluded from REACH-2, whereas they were allowed to be enrolled in the regorafenib 
RESORCE and cabozantinib CELESTIAL studies. 
Results from the phase 2 study I4T-IE-JVBQ and phase 1b study I4T-CR-JVCQ in HCC patients are not 
presented and discussed as both studies were non-comparative and conducted in previously untreated 
patients. The safety findings in the single-agent ramucirumab Study JVBQ were generally consistent with 
those observed in REACH-2 and REACH. No additional safety findings for ramucirumab were identified from 
the review of studies JVBQ or JVCQ that would have a significant impact on product labeling (new warnings, 
precautions or contraindications) for ramucirumab. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials <and post-marketing> have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, there were no unexpected findings in the assessment of TEAEs in the pooled safety population (AFP 
≥400 ng/mL), with the known ADRs peripheral oedema, hypertension, proteinuria, headache, and 
thrombocytopenia being among the most frequently reported. When compared with the known safety profile 
of single-agent ramucirumab from the REGARD gastric cancer population, no new safety signals were 
identified, but the discontinuation rate in HCC patients was somewhat higher. 
As patients with evidence of portal hypertension or any prior history of variceal bleeding were only allowed 
to enrol in REACH-2 and REACH if they had been screened for and (if considered necessary) treated for 
oesophageal varices, a precautionary statement in section 4.4 of the SmPC is deemed necessary. Also, 
hepatic encephalopathy is qualified as a new ADR and has been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC and as 
an identified risk in the RMP. 
Overall, the safety profile as observed in the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL) can be considered 
manageable.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. Particularly, a new warning has been added to the product information to inform prescribers of the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/635673/2019 
Page 81/89

higher rate of hepatic encephalopathy reported in the ramucirumab-treated patients compared to the 
placebo-treated patients. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
- 
- 
The addition of the new indication for the treatment of HCC targets a similar patient demographic group 
as made up the representative test population for the user testing previously performed. 
The proposed text modifications to the package leaflet resulting from the addition of this new indication 
are minor and do not include text that is significantly different from that already user tested. 
-  Overall, the structure and design of the revised Cyramza Package Leaflet has not changed due to the 
new information and the revisions do not significantly affect the overall readability. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed new therapeutic indication for Cyramza in this procedure is for the treatment of adult patients 
with advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who have a serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) of ≥400 
ng/mL and who have been previously treated with sorafenib. 
Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer and the fourth most frequent cause of cancer-related death 
globally. In Europe, there were 82,466 new cases diagnosed and 77,375 deaths reported in 2018 
(GLOBOCAN 2018). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents about 90% of primary liver cancers. 
Patients with advanced HCC have an expected median OS of 6–8 months if left untreated, and are 
candidates for palliative systemic treatment when performance status is adequate. Increased 
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is associated with poorer prognosis and reduced survival in advanced HCC (EASL 
Clinical Practice Guidelines. J Hepatol. 2018). HCC patients with an AFP ≥400 ng/mL comprise almost half of 
patients on systemic therapy, including those in the second-line treatment setting (Jelic et al. 2010; Zhu et 
al. 2015; Bruix et al. 2017). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Since 2007 the first-line standard of care for patients with advanced HCC has been sorafenib (Nexavar HCC 
EPAR). Recently however, lenvatinib was approved for the first-line treatment of advanced HCC as well, 
based on the results of a non-inferiority study (Lenvima HCC EPAR). Lenvatinib is therefore expected to 
become an alternative first-line treatment option. 
For second-line treatment, regorafenib was until very recently the only authorised medicinal product. It was 
approved in September 2017 based on the results of the placebo-controlled RESORCE study (Stivarga HCC 
EPAR). However, in January 2019 cabozantinib was also approved for the second-line treatment of advanced 
HCC, based on the results of the placebo-controlled CELESTIAL study (Cabometyx HCC EPAR). The median 
OS in this setting ranges from 7.4 months to 13.9 months. 
Notwithstanding the above-mentioned medicinal products, the prognosis of advanced HCC is still poor and 
new treatment options are needed.

EMA/635673/2019 
Page 82/89 
Classified as internal/staff & contractors by the European Medicines Agency 
 
  
  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study in this procedure was REACH-2, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 
study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ramucirumab for the treatment of patients with HCC who had an 
AFP ≥400 ng/mL after prior sorafenib therapy. Supportive data were provided from the study REACH, a 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study of ramucirumab as second-line treatment in 
patients with HCC following first-line sorafenib, but only from a subgroup analysis of patients with baseline 
AFP of ≥400 ng/mL. 
Ramucirumab was administered as 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks as an intravenous infusion over approximately 
60 minutes, which is consistent with the existing approved posology for ramucirumab as monotherapy in 
adult patients with advanced gastric cancer (or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
REACH-2 study 
REACH-2 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS in patients with HCC and AFP ≥400 
ng/mL after prior sorafenib therapy (intended target population) who were treated with ramucirumab + BSC 
compared with placebo + BSC. In the ITT analysis, treatment with ramucirumab reduced the hazard of death 
by 29% (OS HR of 0.710; 95% CI: 0.531, 0.949; p=0.0199, stratified log-rank test). Median OS was 8.51 
months (95% CI: 7.00, 10.58) in the ramucirumab arm compared with 7.29 months (95% CI: 5.42, 9.07) 
in the placebo arm, resulting in a median improvement of 1.22 months. 
REACH-2 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the secondary endpoint of PFS in the 
ramucirumab arm compared with the placebo arm. Treatment with ramucirumab reduced the hazard of 
disease progression or death by 55% (stratified HR = 0.452; 95% CI: 0.339, 0.603; p<0.0001), 
representing a 1.22 month longer median PFS in the ramucirumab arm compared with the placebo arm 
(2.83 months vs. 1.61 months, respectively). 
The objective response rate (ORR; complete responses + partial responses) was numerically higher in 
patients in the ramucirumab arm as compared to the placebo arm but was not statistically significantly 
different (4.6% vs. 1.1%, respectively; odds ratio = 4.6; 95% CI: 0.6, 37.3; p=0.1697). 
REACH study 
In the exploratory subgroup analysis of the supportive REACH study in patients with a baseline AFP of ≥400 
ng/mL (n=250), ramucirumab reduced the hazard of death by 33% (OS HR = 0.674; 95% CI: 0.508-0.895; 
p=0.0059), with median OS of 7.8 months for ramucirumab vs. 4.2 months for placebo. Patients with 
baseline AFP <400 ng/mL in the REACH study did not experience a survival benefit (OS HR=1.093; 95% CI: 
0.836, 1.428; p=0.5059). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The enrolled patient population appears to be a relatively selected population compared to patients with HCC 
treated in clinical practice (who for example may be more frail and have more comorbidity), the external 
validity of the results is therefore uncertain and these limitations have been reflected in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC.  
No dose-response studies have been submitted for the requested HCC indication, and hence there is 
uncertainty as to whether the selected dose of 8 mg/kg Q2W is optimal. A relevant exposure-efficacy 
association was demonstrated in HCC, which showed that only half of the patients (those with above-median 
exposure) appeared to benefit from ramucirumab treatment. This exposure-efficacy relationship remained 
after attempts to adjust for other prognostic factors. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/635673/2019 
Page 83/89 
Classified as internal/staff & contractors by the European Medicines Agency 
 
  
  
Based on the observed exposure-response relationship in HCC, there is uncertainty whether patients with 
below-median exposure would benefit from ramucirumab treatment. While findings may be due to clearance 
still being confounded by prognosis despite the performed adjustments, it cannot be concluded from the 
presented findings whether the dose of ramucirumab in HCC is adequate for all patients in the proposed 
indication, and this remains an uncertainty as reflected in section 5.2 of the SmPC. The MAH is encouraged 
to further investigate the optimal dose for ramucirumab in the applied indication. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the pooled safety population from the pivotal REACH-2 study plus the subpopulation of patients with 
baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL from the supportive REACH study, the incidence of AEs in the different AE 
categories for ramucirumab vs. placebo were: any-Grade TEAs: 96.8% vs. 92.4%; Grade ≥3 TEAEs: 57.3% 
vs. 52.0%; SAEs: 35.4% vs. 33.6%; discontinuation due to an AE: 16.5% vs. 10.3%; death due to an AE: 
3.2% vs. 2.7%. 
Overall, there were no unexpected findings in the assessment of TEAEs, with the known ADRs peripheral 
oedema (ramucirumab: 29.1%; placebo 17.0%), hypertension (ramucirumab: 21.5%; placebo 9.0%), 
proteinuria (ramucirumab: 18.7%; placebo 5.4%), headache (ramucirumab: 16.8%; placebo 6.3%), and 
thrombocytopenia (ramucirumab: 14.9%; placebo 4.5%) being among the most frequently reported 
(any-Grade) TEAEs. Hypertension was the only Grade ≥3 TEAE with a ≥5 percentage points higher incidence 
for ramucirumab (12.0%) than placebo (3.6%). 
Hepatic encephalopathy was reported in 4.7% of ramucirumab- vs. 0.9% of placebo-treated patients. It is 
considered a new ADR for single-agent ramucirumab in the treatment of HCC and as such was included in the 
product information. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
All patients in the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL) had C-P score <7 (C-P class A only), ECOG PS 
<2, and only mildly impaired renal function at worst. The to-be-treated patient population in clinical practice 
is expected to include more frail patients with e.g. ECOG PS of 2 and/or impaired renal function, and possibly 
also C-P class B. The limitations related to the studied patient population are reflected in sections 4.4 and 5.1 
of the SmPC) 
Patients with evidence of portal hypertension or any prior history of variceal bleeding were only allowed to 
enrol in REACH-2 and REACH if they had been screened and (if considered necessary) treated for 
oesophageal varices (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Regarding hepatic encephalopathy, patients with a history of hepatic encephalopathy were excluded from 
the pivotal and supportive studies, and thus the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL). Nevertheless, 
the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy was higher in ramucirumab-treated than in placebo-treated 
patients. It is uncertain if the observed incidence of hepatic encephalopathy is truly representative of the 
to-be-treated patient population. However, the information on hepatic encephalopathy that is to be included 
in the SmPC, is considered sufficient and therefore acceptable.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The prognosis of patients with advanced HCC, and progressive disease on or after prior sorafenib treatment, 
is poor, as shown by the 7-month median OS in the placebo arm of the submitted pivotal study. There are 
few treatment options available for HCC patients who progress on first-line systemic therapy and thus new 
treatment options are necessary in this setting.

The OS benefit observed for ramucirumab vs. placebo in the current application was small (1.2 month). 
Importantly, this benefit needs to be considered in light of the need for patients to undergo treatment for 
which they have to attend the hospital for receiving infusions every two weeks. On the other hand, the effect 
on OS was consistent across subgroups (when considering both REACH and REACH-2), supported by 
sensitivity analyses and an increase in PFS, although of equally small magnitude, 1.22 months or 
approximately 5 weeks. 
The observed exposure-response relationship brings into question whether the dosage of ramucirumab of 8 
mg/kg Q2W is adequate. A relevant exposure-efficacy association was demonstrated in HCC, which showed 
that only half of the patients (i.e. those with above-median exposure; Q3 and Q4) appeared to benefit from 
ramucirumab treatment. These exposure-efficacy relationships remained after attempts to adjust for other 
prognostic factors. Of interest, similar exposure-response relationships have been observed for many other 
monoclonal antibodies in cancer treatment suggesting this phenomenon might be generalizable. This 
information has been reflected in section 5.2 of the SmPC.  
The toxicity profile of ramucirumab appears quite manageable, even though it is non-negligible and the 
treatment duration is in general short (for all indications). The following three comments should be made. 
Firstly, given the fact that ramucirumab may potentially increase the risk of (severe) bleeding in HCC (like 
other VEGF-targeted drugs), and that there is an increased risk of oesophageal varices bleeding due to 
portal hypertension, HCC patients with evidence of portal hypertension or any prior history of variceal 
bleeding were only allowed to enrol in REACH-2 and REACH if they had been screened and (if considered 
necessary) treated for oesophageal varices. The proposed precautionary statement on this matter included 
in section 4.4 of the SmPC, is considered sufficient. 
Secondly, hepatic encephalopathy is considered a new ADR for single-agent ramucirumab in the treatment 
of HCC and as such is included in the revised product information and as an identified risk in the RMP. 
Thirdly, when compared with regorafenib and cabozantinib, the safety profile of ramucirumab as observed in 
the pooled safety population (AFP ≥400 ng/mL) may be somewhat more favourable, however, as this 
involves cross study comparisons, no definitive conclusions can be drawn. 
An uncertainty important for the benefit-risk assessment for ramucirumab in HCC is the fact that the patient 
population studied in the pivotal study was relatively selected (e.g. in terms of C-P class, ECOG PS, and 
comorbidities) compared to what can be expected in clinical practice.  
Overall, although limited, ramucirumab did demonstrate a statistically significant OS benefit in the 
confirmatory phase 3 study REACH-2, without an apparent detrimental effect on QoL, and showing a 
manageable toxicity profile. The fact that the patient population in the pivotal study can be regarded as 
relatively selected can be negated by adequately reflecting the eligibility criteria of the study in section 5.1 
of the SmPC. Also, the relevant data on the observed exposure-response relationship are described in 
section 5.2. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Patients with advanced HCC not amenable to curative treatment options have a very poor prognosis even 
with currently available treatment options, and novel treatments for these patients are therefore necessary. 
Ramucirumab treatment resulted in a small but statistically significant OS benefit vs. placebo in the ITT 
population of the pivotal study REACH-2 in a relatively selected population (e.g. in terms of C-P class, ECOG 
PS, and comorbidities) compared to what can be expected in clinical practice. In addition, a relevant 
exposure-efficacy association was demonstrated, which showed that half of the patients (i.e. those with 
below-median exposure) did not have any OS benefit. Available information concerning these topics are 
adequately reflected in the SmPC.

The safety profile of ramucirumab, even though non-negligible, appears quite manageable. 
In conclusion, the benefit-risk balance for ramucirumab for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or 
unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who have a serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) of ≥400 ng/mL and who 
have been previously treated with sorafenib, could be considered positive pending resolution of the last 
outstanding issues. It is left up to the treating physician and the patient to make an informed decision to 
start treatment with either ramucirumab or one of the other two approved second-line treatment options. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Cyramza (ramucirumab) for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or 
unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who have a serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) of ≥400 ng/mL and who 
have been previously treated with sorafenib, is positive.

Reminders to the MAH 
1. 
In accordance with Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the Agency makes available a 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the medicinal product assessed by the Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use. The EPAR is first published after the granting of the initial marketing 
authorisation (MA) and is continuously updated during the lifecycle of the medicinal product. In 
particular, following a major change to the MA, the Agency further publishes the assessment report of 
the CHMP and the reasons for its opinion in favour of granting the change to the authorisation, after 
deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature. 
Should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains commercially confidential information, 
please provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of commercially 
confidential information (CCI) in “track changes” and with detailed justification by 15 July 2019. 
The principles to be applied for the deletion of CCI are published on the EMA website at 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/regulatory-procedural-guideline/principles-be-applied-deleti
on-commercially-confidential-information-disclosure-emea-documents_en.pdf. 
2. 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
3. 
If the approved RMP is using Rev. 2 of the ‘Guidance on the format of the RMP in the EU’ and the RMP 
‘Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan’ has been updated in the procedure, the MAH is 
reminded to provide to the EMA Procedure Assistant by Eudralink a PDF version of the ‘Part VI: 
Summary of the risk management plan’ as a standalone document, within 14 calendar days of the 
receipt of the CHMP Opinion. The PDF should contain only text and tables and be free of metadata, 
headers and footers. 
4.  The MAH is reminded to submit an eCTD closing sequence with the final documents provided by 
Eudralink during the procedure (including final PI translations, if applicable) within 15 days after the 
Commission Decision, or prior to the next regulatory activity, whichever is first.

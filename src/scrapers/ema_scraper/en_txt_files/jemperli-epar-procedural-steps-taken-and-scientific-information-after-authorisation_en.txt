1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Specific Obligation in the Annex II; this is a phase 3, 
randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of 
dostarlimab (TSR-042) plus carboplatin-paclitaxel 
versus placebo plus carboplatin-paclitaxel in patients 
with recurrent or primary advanced endometrial 
cancer. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 
and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Annex II and 
Package Leaflet are updated in accordance. Version 
3.2 of the RMP has also been submitted. This 
submission fulfils SOB002 thus supporting the switch 
from CMA to full MA. In addition, the marketing 
authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to 
introduce minor editorial changes to the PI. As part 
of the application, the MAH is requesting a 1-year 
extension of the market protection.

A total of 143 patients with dMMR/MSI H EC were 
efficacy and safety information based on interim 
Annex II 
evaluated for efficacy in the GARNET study. The overall 
results from study 4010-01-001 (GARNET) listed as a 
specific obligation (SOB) in the Annex II; This is a 
single-arm, open-label, phase I trial of intravenous 
dostarlimab in advanced solid tumours. Update of 
Annex II to remove the specific obligation. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
Annex II in line with the QRD template version 10.3. 
The RMP version 2.1 is approved. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
median treatment duration in weeks was 34 (range 2 to 
220).  Twenty four percent of subjects who received any 
amount of dostarlimab received treatment >102 weeks (2 
years). Dostarlimab treatment resulted in an Objective 
Response Rate (ORR) by response evaluation criteria in 
solid tumours (RECIST) v1.1 of 45.5% (95% CI: 37.1, 
54.0) in patients with dMMR/MSI-H endometrial cancer. A 
complete response (CR) was reported in 23 (16.1%) 
dMMR/MSI-H patients. Median duration of response (DOR) 
was not reached at the time of data cutoff. The number of 
patients with duration of response ≥ 12 months and ≥ 24 
months was 52 (80%) and 29 (44.6%) respectively. 
Disease control rate (DCR) was of 60.1% (n=86).

order to update dose modifications recommendations 
in immune related adverse reactions, amend existing 
warnings, and add further immune-related ADRs to 
the list of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), with 
different frequencies, based on data from company 
sponsored trials and literature. The Package Leaflet 
is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to make minor changes to sections 4.6 
and 5.2 of the SmPC and to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet. Changes are 
also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current 
QRD template version and excipients guideline.

section 4.2 of the SmPC for myocarditis and severe 
neurological toxicities (myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia 
gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, encephalitis, transverse 
myelitis). Furthermore, the table of recommended dose 
modifications has been amended to reflect a more precise 
terminology “Exfoliative dermatologic conditions (e.g. 
Stevens Johnson syndrom (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis 
(TEN), Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic 
Symptoms (DRESS))” for immune-related cutaneous 
adverse effects. Section 4.4 of the SmPC has been updated 
in accordance. 
Based on available safety data, the following ADRs have 
also been included in the SmPC, section 4.8: encephalitis, 
myasthenia gravis, myasthenic syndrome, myocarditis, 
gastritis (including gastritis, immune-mediated gastritis and 
vasculitis gastrointestinal), oesophagitis, immune-mediated 
arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, myositis and systemic 
inflammatory response syndrome. In addition, immune-
mediated enterocolitis and enteritis have been included as 
part of the composite term ‘colitis’.

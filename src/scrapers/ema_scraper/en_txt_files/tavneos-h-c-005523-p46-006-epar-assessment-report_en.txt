1.  Introduction 
On 23 March 2023, the MAH submitted a completed study for Tavneos, in accordance with Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that “A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the 
Safety and Efficacy of Avacopan (CCX168) in Patients with C3 Glomerulopathy (ACCOLADE)” is a stand 
alone study. The study enrolled 2 pediatric subjects, both of whom were randomized to receive placebo 
in the initial double-blind period followed by avacopan in the open-label treatment period. On 21 
October 2022, the MAH submitted an abbreviated report of the results of Study CL011_168 which was 
reviewed under Art. 46 (procedure EMA/CHMP/930450/2022). 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was not met, and the MAH does not plan to submit the 
results of Study CL011_168 as a subject of a Variation to the Summary of Product Characteristics for 
Tavneos. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Avacopan is an orally administered, selective inhibitor of the complement 5a receptor (C5aR). 
Avacopan 10 mg capsules were administered in the study.    
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
CL011-168: A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the 
Safety and Efficacy of Avacopan (CCX168) in Patients with C3 Glomerulopathy (ACCOLADE). 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical study number and title 
CL011-168: A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety and 
Efficacy of Avacopan (CCX168) in Patients with C3 Glomerulopathy (ACCOLADE) 
Description 
A clinical trial to test the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of avacopan in subjects with C3 
Glomerulopathy (C3G). Subjects with biopsy-proven C3G with or without a renal transplant, were 
stratified by elevated or normal levels of C5b-9 and then were randomized 1:1 to receive avacopan or 
placebo twice daily (BID) for 26 weeks in a double-blind manner followed by open-label avacopan for 
an additional 26 weeks. 
EMA/325820/2023  
Page 3/18 
 
  
 
 
Methods 
Study participants 
Eligible subjects were men and women ≥ 18 years of age with biopsy-proven C3G, either Dense 
Deposit Disease (DDD) or C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN), with or without a renal transplant. Adolescent 
subjects (12 to 17 years of age) were enrolled only in countries and at study centers for which 
respective approval by Regulatory Authorities and Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent 
Ethics Committee (IEC) was granted. Key exclusion criteria included, but were not limited to, women 
who were pregnant or nursing, tubulointerstitial fibrosis that appears to be more than 50%, use of 
eculizumab or another anti-C5 antibody within 26 weeks before dosing, and secondary C3 disease. 
Treatments 
The 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period, Phase 2 study, included a 26- 
week, double-blind treatment period (Period 1), followed by a 26-week, open-label, active-treatment 
period (Period 2), and an 8-week off-treatment Period. Study participants were stratified by baseline 
C5b-9 level (>244 ng/mL, ≤244 ng/mL) and randomized 1:1 to avacopan 30 mg BID or placebo for an 
initial 26-week double-blind treatment period (Period 1). At Week 26, study participants initially 
randomized to avacopan 30 mg BID remained on this regimen and participants initially randomized to 
placebo were switched to avacopan 30 mg BID for a 26-week active treatment period through Week 52 
(Period 2). After the open-label treatment period, all subjects were followed for an additional 8 weeks 
(56 days) without study drug treatment. For adolescent subjects, the dose of avacopan or placebo on 
day 1 of the 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period was calculated based on body 
weight at screening. Dose could be adjusted based on avacopan plasma exposures (AUC0-6hr) on day 
1. Starting on day 183 (open-label avacopan treatment period), adolescent subjects dose was reset 
based on their body weight determined on that day.

Sample size 
Planned enrollment in the study was approximately 88 subjects total with 44 subjects in each arm of 
the study (ie, avacopan, placebo) and 22 subjects within each C5b-9 strata (ie, elevated and normal) 
of each arm. Two adolescent subjects (12-17 years of age) were randomized to placebo during the 
double-blind treatment period.  
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Randomization was performed centrally via an interactive response technology (IRT) system and 
minimization algorithm, using the stratification factors. In order to protect blinding, the randomization 
schedule was not accessible to study personnel who had contact with study centers or who were 
involved in data management and analysis.

Figure 2: Randomization 
Avacopan and placebo capsules were identical in appearance as were the bottles containing 
investigational product. Blinding of the study was also achieved by limited access to the randomization 
code, unblinded avacopan plasma concentration results were not shared with the study site personnel 
or study staff who have direct contact with study sites during the study. Data that could potentially be 
unblinding were not made available unless required for safety monitoring. Investigators, however, 
were provided with safety laboratory data reports, flagging abnormally high and low values in order to 
make informed decisions regarding patient care. An individual subject’s treatment assignment was only 
unblinded in order to provide appropriate treatment or management of the subject in the case of an 
adverse event. The study monitor and sponsor were to be notified as soon as possible in all events of 
unblinding before study completion. 
Statistical Methods 
Please refer to table under heading “Objectives, Endpoints and Statistical methods”. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 57 subjects (28 avacopan, 29 placebo) were enrolled and randomized into the study. 
Twenty-six (92.9%) and 28 (96.6%) subjects, respectively, completed investigational product in the 
double-blind treatment period. At the time of the primary analysis, 4 subjects were still ongoing in the 
double-blind treatment period. These 4 subjects were excluded from the primary analyses of efficacy 
but were included in the final analysis tables. Three subjects (2 avacopan, 1 placebo) discontinued 
investigational product and the study during the double-blind period; reasons for investigational 
product withdrawal were sponsor decision and ‘other’ (1 avacopan subject each) and adverse event (1 
placebo subject). The remaining 54 (94.7%) subjects (26 avacopan, 28 placebo) entered the avacopan 
treatment period. Forty-nine (86.0%) subjects completed the avacopan and follow-up treatment 
period; 47 (82.5%) subjects completed investigational product.

Efficacy results 
In the AR for the interim data (EMEA/H/C/005523/P46/003), the applicant was encouraged to provide 
a separate presentation of the data retrieved from paediatric subjects exposed to avacopan. Both 
adolescent subjects completed study treatment (placebo) in the double-blind and open-label avacopan 
treatment periods and completed the study. Demographic and baseline characteristics,

pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety data for adolescent subjects enrolled in the study, where 
available, are described within each section. 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline to week 26 in the C3G histologic index for 
disease activity was not met. 
Table 5: Change from Baseline to Week 26 in the C3G Histologic Index for Disease Activity – Subjects 
with Elevated C5b-9 in the Intent-to-Treat Population (Primary Analysis) 
One adolescent subject showed improvement (ie, decrease of 3.0) in the C3G Histological Index of 
disease activity from baseline to week 26; there was no change from baseline to week 26 for the 
second adolescent subject. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Because the primary study endpoint was not met, the results from analyses of the secondary efficacy 
endpoints should be considered exploratory according to the MAH. 
Table 6: Percent Change from Baseline to Week 26 in UPCR In Subjects with Abnormal UPCR at 
Baseline - Subjects with Elevated C5b-9 in the ITT Population (Primary Analysis) 
Among the 2 adolescent subjects, 1 had large decreases (ie, improvement) in percent change in UPCR 
from both baseline to week 26 (-78.3%) and baseline to week 52 (-86.0%) while the second adolescent 
subject had large increases at both time points (66% and 90%, respectively).

Table 7: Percent Change and Change from Baseline to Week 26 in eGFR - Subjects with Elevated C5b-
9 in the Intent-to-Treat Population (Primary Analysis) 
Both adolescent subjects entered the study with normal eGFR values (142 and 105 mL/min/1.73m2, 
respectively) and values remained in the normal range for both subjects at week 26 (152 and 118 
mL/min/1.73m2 , respectively) following 26 weeks of placebo and at week 52 (167 and 89 
mL/min/1.73m2 , respectively) following 26 weeks of avacopan.  
Table 8: Change from Baseline to Week 26 in the C3G Histologic Index for Disease Chronicity - 
Subjects with Elevated C5b-9 in the Intent-to-Treat Population (Primary Analysis) 
Change from baseline to week 26 in the C3G Histological Index of Disease Chronicity was 4.0 and 3.0, 
respectively for the 2 adolescent subjects.

Summary of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events in Adolescent Subjects 
The types and severity of adverse events reported by the 2 adolescent subjects were similar to those 
observed in the entire safety population.

Page 16/18 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
One adolescent subject experienced nonserious, grade 1 adverse events of nausea, nasopharyngitis, 
and increased weight; none of these events were considered related to investigational product by the 
investigator. The second adolescent subject experienced nonserious, grade 1 adverse events of pyrexia 
(3 events), hyperkalaemia, cough, abdominal pain, mouth ulceration, and asthenia. This subject also 
experienced serious adverse events of bronchitis (grade 1) from day 141 to day 145 and pneumonia 
(grade 2) from day 175 to day 184. The nonserious events of pyrexia and cough, and the serious 
adverse events of pneumonia and bronchitis in this subject were considered possibly related to 
investigational product by the investigator. All adverse events in both adolescent subjects, except for 
the nonserious event of increased weight which was reported as ongoing, resolved; both subjects 
completed investigational product and the study. 
For chemistry parameters, 1 adolescent subject had transient grade 1 elevations in ALT (week 48) and 
creatine kinase (week 57) that returned to normal by the next visit; AST and ALP values in the subject 
remained normal throughout the study. The second adolescent subject had grade 1 increases in ALP 
and bilirubin at baseline; ALP values remained elevated throughout the study while bilirubin values 
were normal at all postbaseline time points. AST and ALT in the subject were normal throughout the 
study. This subject also reported grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 elevations in potassium at several time 
points throughout the study; 1 of the grade 3 elevations corresponded temporally with an adverse 
event of hyperkalaemia in the subject. Transient grade 1 elevations in creatine kinase at weeks 32, 54 
and 57 were also noted in this subject.  
For haematology parameters, 1 adolescent subject had transient grade 1 decreases in haemoglobin 
reported intermittently at 7 study visits; in each case, values returned to normal within 1 to 3 study 
visits. The second adolescent subject had grade 1 and grade 2 decreases in haemoglobin at every 
study time point (including baseline) and a transient grade 1 decreases in leukocytes at a single time 
point (week 28).  
For urinalysis, 1 adolescent subject had grade 3 positive protein results at screening that remained 
elevated and fluctuated between grades 1 and 4 at every study visit. The 2nd adolescent subject had 
grade 2 positive protein urine results at baseline that remained elevated and fluctuated between grade 
2 and grade 3 at every study visit. Urine chemistry results for both adolescent subjects also returned 
grade 1 to grade 3 elevations in protein at each study visit, including baseline. No notable changes 
from baseline in vital signs, weight, and Body Mass Index (BMI) were observed during the study in the 
overall safety population. One adolescent subject had gradual increases in weight and BMI of 12.5 kg 
(77.5 kg at baseline to 90.0 kg at week 60) and 3.530 kg/m2 (26.2 kg/m2 at baseline to 29.7 kg/m2 
at week 60), respectively, over the course of the study (week 60) accompanied by a 2 cm increase in 
height over the same time period. The weight gain for this subject was reported as an adverse event. 
The other adolescent subject also had gradual increases in height (8 cm) and weight (4.3 kg) over the 
same time period, but a slight decrease in BMI (-0.183 kg/m2). ECG results for both adolescent 
subjects enrolled in the study were normal or considered nonsignificant by the investigator. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In accordance with article 46 of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 for paediatric studies, the MAH 
submitted the final study report of “A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Phase 2 Study to 
Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Avacopan (CCX168) in Patients with C3 Glomerulopathy 
(ACCOLADE)” which is not part of any Paediatric Investigation Plan. The primary efficacy endpoint of 
the study was not met and the MAH does not plan to submit the results as a subject of a Variation to 
the Summary of Product Characteristics for Tavneos. This is agreed. 
Only two adolescent subjects (12-17 years of age) participated in the study, both of whom were 
randomized to receive placebo in the initial double-blind period. The types and severity of adverse 
EMA/325820/2023

events reported by the 2 adolescent subjects were similar to those observed in the entire safety 
population. The study does not significantly contribute to the safety and efficacy data of Tavneos 
considering only two adolescent patients participated in the study. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Subjects with biopsy- proven C3G with or without a renal transplant, were stratified by elevated or 
normal levels of C5b-9 and then randomized 1:1 to receive avacopan or placebo twice daily (BID) for 
26 weeks in a double-blind manner followed by open-label avacopan for an additional 26 weeks. Only 
two adolescent subjects (12-17 years of age) participated in the study, both of whom were randomized 
to receive placebo in the initial double-blind period. The types and severity of adverse events reported 
by the 2 adolescent subjects were similar to those observed in the entire safety population.  
The study does not significantly contribute to the safety and efficacy data of Tavneos considering only 
two adolescent patients participated in the study.  
The CHMP consider the application approvable. No regulatory actions are warranted.  
The benefit risk ratio for the approved indication remains unchanged.

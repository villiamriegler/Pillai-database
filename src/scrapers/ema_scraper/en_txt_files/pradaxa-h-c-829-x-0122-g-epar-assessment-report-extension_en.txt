2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a disease that includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary 
embolism (PE). DVT is a thrombus that forms in a deep vein, e.g. in the leg, the renal vein or in any other 
deep vein in the body. This is likely to occur when for any reason the blood is in a state of hypercoagulability, 
when there is stasis of the venous blood flow and/or when the endothelium is diseased and dysfunctional. PE 
occurs when a deep venous thrombus, or a part of it breaks free from the vein wall, travels to the lungs and 
then blocks some or all of the pulmonary blood supply. 
While the VTE pathophysiology of hypercoagulability, blood flow stasis and endothelial dysfunction are similar 
in children and adults and would be receptive to the same type of treatment, the risk factors and triggers of 
VTE in children are different from those in adults. Consequently, the epidemiology, clinical picture and 
outcomes are different in children compared to adults, see below. 
In addition, children are a challenging patient population to treat because VTE most often occurs in the 
context of another serious diagnosis that also must be treated. 
Paediatric VTE has a significant impact on both immediate and long-term health outcomes. Immediate 
complications of VTE include death from pulmonary embolism (PE) and non-lethal PE. Long-term 
consequences involve recurrent VTE, bleeding associated with anticoagulation therapy, and post-thrombotic 
syndrome (PTS). PTS is a burdensome condition that can lead to severe disability and poor quality of life in 
affected children. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Venous thromboembolism is a relatively rare disease in the paediatric population with an estimated 
population prevalence of about 0.6 to 1.1 per 10 000 children. Among hospitalised children, the incidence is 
with ≥58 per 10 000 paediatric admissions significantly higher than in the paediatric population overall. A 
dramatic increase of 70% has been noted over less than one decade; most likely due to better survival of 
acutely ill patients and increased use of central venous access devices. VTE is now among hospitalised 
children the second most common cause of preventable harm. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The common pathophysiology of venous thromboembolism involves the triad of hypercoagulability, stasis 
and endothelial injury, which is historically named Virchow's triad. 
The risk of VTE is significantly lower in the paediatric population compared to adults. Children and 
adolescents are less exposed to the range of prothrombotic risk factors that are frequently associated with 
adult venous thromboembolism, e.g. diabetes and cardiovascular disease involving endothelial dysfunction, 
prothrombotic medications, pregnancy, smoking, malignancy, surgery and other factors. 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 11/142 
  
  
In addition, there are physiologic differences in the haemostatic system as children have lower levels of 
vitamin K dependent factors, and increased plasma concentrations of the thrombin inhibitor alpha-2-
macroglobulin, both resulting in lower thrombin generation (Spentzouris G et al. Pediatric venous 
thromboembolism in relation to adults. J Vasc Surg. 2012; 55:1785–1793) 
Most paediatric VTEs constitute a secondary complication of other clinical conditions such as venous 
catheterisation, malignancy, infection/sepsis, congenital heart disease, trauma/surgery, renal disease, and 
inherited thrombophilia (e.g. Factor V Leiden mutation and others) or acquired thrombophilia. Among these, 
the most common etiologic factor for VTE in paediatric patients is the presence of a central venous access 
device 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The clinical presentation of VTE will depend on the location and the extension of the thrombus. A few 
examples are given: 
The most frequent trigger of VTE in children is the presence of a central venous catheter. The clinical 
presentations range from asymptomatic, chronic symptoms, e.g. with frequent clotting of the catheter, 
development of collateral venous circulation, recurrent sepsis, to acute symptoms with pain, swelling, 
discolouration of the affected area or limb and possible PE. 
DVT in the lower limb may be located distally or proximally in the deep veins of limb, causing pain, swelling, 
and discolouration. Proximal DVT is generally associated with higher risk for PE, but in the presence of other 
concomitant risk factors even distal (below the knee) DVT may be associated with PE. 
PE can present with chest pain, dyspnoea, pleuritis, cough, haemoptysis, but it can also present in children 
with non-specific symptoms depending on the underlying disease. 
Renal vein thrombosis is relatively common compared to other VTE presentations in children. It can cause 
flank pain and haematuria and impaired kidney function. 
There is no specific diagnostic biomarker for PE. Imaging with ultrasound, e.g. compression ultrasound, is the 
most frequently used method if the location of the suspected thrombus is accessible, e.g. in a limb. However, 
for the diagnosis of a more centrally located thrombus, contrast venography (cMRV), contrast magnetic 
resonance venography or computed tomography (CT) venography may be used. For the diagnosis of PE, 
computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) have largely replaced ventilation/perfusion scan with 
medical isotopes although the latter may still be used in some cases. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The standard of care (SoC) for the treatment of VTE in children is unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low 
molecular weight heparin (LMWH) administered for generally 5 to 7 days followed by LMWH or a vitamin K 
antagonist (VKA). A further treatment option is the injectable factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux. There are 
frequent challenges with the therapeutic agents commonly used in children, including the need for venous 
access or subcutaneous injection, the risk of thrombocytopenia and bleeding, the need for frequent 
monitoring, variable PK of UFH, and drug-drug and drug-food interactions with VKA. These clinical challenges 
warrant the development of easier to use treatment modalities with a comparable safety and efficacy profile 
to current SoC treatments. DE may provide such an option; it is effective and safe for treating VTEs in adults.

About the product 
Dabigatran etexilate (DE) is the oral pro-drug of the active moiety dabigatran. The dabigatran etexilate pro-
drug was developed due to the limited oral availability of dabigatran, and it is converted into dabigatran in 
vivo via esterases. The drug substance is the mesilate salt form of the pro-drug, called dabigatran etexilate 
mesilate. Dabigatran is a potent, synthetic, non-peptide competitive, rapidly acting and reversible inhibitor of 
thrombin. Since thrombin (serine protease) enables the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin during the 
coagulation cascade, its inhibition prevents the development of thrombus. Dabigatran also inhibits free 
thrombin, fibrin-bound thrombin and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. DE does not inhibit thrombin or 
factor Xa, respectively, demonstrating that the pro drug does not possess anticoagulant activity. 
An ATC code B01AE07 (Oral direct thrombin inhibitors) had been assigned by the WHO to dabigatran 
etexilate. 
PRADAXA 75 mg, 110 mg and 150 mg are available as hard, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose capsule. It is 
presented in aluminium/aluminium blister strips (packs with 10, 30. 60, 100 and 180 capsules) as well as in 
polypropylene bottles with 60 capsules.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
This  application  is  submitted  upon  completion  of  the  dabigatran  EU  PIP  (EMEA-000081-PIP01-07-M11)  and 
proposes the following paediatric indication for Pradaxa®: 
• 
Treatment of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients 
from birth to less than 18 years of age. 
It is intended to treat the paediatric population with already registered capsules and the two new paediatric 
pharmaceutical forms according to the following scheme: 
• 
• 
• 
Pradaxa® powder and solvent for oral solution (6.25 mg/mL after reconstitution) for children less than 1 
year; 
Pradaxa® coated granules (20/30/40/50/110/150 mg per sachet) for children below 12 years as soon as 
the child is able to swallow soft food; 
Pradaxa® hard capsules (75/110/150 mg) for children from 8 years to below 18 years. 
Paediatric clinical development programme 
The EU Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for dabigatran etexilate was adopted with EMA decision P/76/2008 
on 14 Sep 2008 (EMEA-000081-PIP01-07). Since then, the PIP was modified 11 times (EMEA-000081-PIP01-
07-M11) with the latest decision adopted on 07 Dec 2018 (P/399/2018). 
The dabigatran PIP contains waivers for the indications pVTEp and SPAF and requires a total of 6 clinical 
studies in the paediatric population aged 0 to less than 18 years or healthy volunteers ( (see Table 1 below) 
to investigate the PIP condition “Treatment of thromboembolic events”. Furthermore, the PIP requires the 
development of an age-appropriate formulation. 
Compliance with the PIP 
In accordance with the PIP, this grouped extension application is based on data of several Phase I to Phase III 
trials. Five trials (1160.87, 1160.194, 1160.88, 1160.89, and 1160.105) have already been completed. For the 
completed trials that are part of the PIP (all except 1160.194), the partial compliance checks by the PDCO were 
successful and confirmed compliance with the key binding elements. 
Trials included in the grouped extension application

Two trials (1160.106 and 1160.108) were still ongoing at the initial submission based on an interim analysis 
and CTR. These trials have both been completed in the meantime. An updated dossier with the final CTRs for 
both trials has been provided.  As agreed with the EMA, the interim CTRs covered all key binding elements as 
per PIP.  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0399/2018 was completed. The PDCO issued an 
opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0399/2018 on 23 Aug 2019 (EMEA-C-000081-PIP01-07-M11) based on 
draft interim clinical trial reports for 1160.106 and 1160.108.  
The interim analysis from trials 1160.106 and 1160.108 included data from the following patient population: 
• 
• 
All patients who already completed either trial 
Ongoing patients who were recruited after 1 Nov 2018 and attended at least Visit 3 (i.e. Day 4). This 
visit corresponds to the time point when the first PK measurement of dabigatran was performed 
Recruitment in trials 1160.106 and 1160.108 continued until April 2019 for 1160.108 and July 2019 for 
1160.106 in order to comply with the FDA post marketing requirements and as part of the written request 
that has been issued by the FDA. The resulting final CTRs with the complete data set for trials 1160.106 and 
1160.108 have been provided within current procedure. 
No relevant changes exist between these draft CTR versions and the finalized interim CTR versions, which 
were submitted as part of this grouped extension application. Specifically, no relevant changes were made, 
which relate to the key binding elements. 
All trials are/were being performed in compliance with GCP and in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements and BI standard operating procedures. All CTPs were approved by institutional review boards or 
independent ethics committees. In accordance with GCP and according to the local regulatory and legal 
requirements, informed consent/assent was obtained from all patients/parent(s) or the patient’s legally 
accepted representative. 
Trials included in the analysis of efficacy and safety 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 16/142 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The efficacy and/or safety of DE in paediatric patients have been investigated in 5 trials, with trials 1160.106 
and 1160.108 contributing the majority of patients to the programme. Of these 5 trials, 3 Phase IIa trials 
have been completed with each trial covering a different age range from adolescents to infants. The patients 
in all 3 Phase IIa trials received DE either as single intake or for 3 days. 
The Phase IIb/III trials have a twice daily dosing for DE and a treatment duration of 3 months (1160.106) or 
up to 12 months (1160.108). Trial 1160.106 is a Phase IIb/III trial with the objective to document the 
appropriateness of the proposed dosing algorithm, in addition to efficacy and safety analyses. Trial 1160.108 
is a Phase III trial with the objective to collect safety data with a considerably longer trial duration than for 
1160.106. 
Overview of trials included in the evaluation of efficacy/safety 
The first trial investigating DE capsules in adolescents was 1160.88 and started in August 2009. The patients 
were treated for 3 days twice daily. The subsequent trial 1160.89 analysed DE as oral solution when given to 
paediatric patients aged 1 to 12 years. As agreed with the PDCO, the dosing scheme was changed during the 
trial from 3 days twice daily to a single dose. Most patients in this trial were treated with a single instead of 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 17/142 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
multiple dose of DE. In trial 1160.105, the youngest age group (<1 year) received a single dose of DE as oral 
solution. 
The 2 trials with the largest number of treated patients in the paediatric programme are trials 1160.106 and 
1160.108. They recruited patients until April 2019 (1160.106) and July 2019 (1160.108). The resulting final 
CTRs with the complete data set for trials 1160.106 and 1160.108 have been provided within current 
procedure. The Phase IIb/III trial 1160.106 is an open-label, randomised, active-controlled non-inferiority 
trial comparing DE with standard of care i.e. low molecular weight heparins or vitamin K antagonists or 
fondaparinux. Trial 1160.106 has a planned patient participation of 3 months, beyond the initial parenteral 
therapy (at least 5 days and at most 21 days). The dosing algorithm, which was investigated in 
trial 1160.106, was also applied in the Phase III trial 1160.108. The latter is a safety trial and investigated 
DE as single treatment in patients requiring secondary prevention of VTE. Patients from trial 1160.106 who 
were in continued need for anticoagulation could also participate in trial 1160.108. The treatment duration in 
trial 1160.108 with up to 12 months is longer than the planned treatment duration in trial 1160.106. 
Bioavailability trials with paediatric formulations in adults 
The Phase I trials 1160.87 and 1160.194 were performed in adult healthy volunteers and investigated the 
bioavailability of different formulations of DE. The tested formulations were then used in the paediatric clinical 
trials. Both bioavailability trials in adults analysed the formulations oral solution, coated granules, and 
capsules which were given either as single dose (1160.87) or for 3 days (1160.194). Individual Cmax,ss and 
AUCτ,ss values observed for the 3 formulations were within the range of exposure seen in previous trials in 
adults. The noted increase in exposure was small enough to consider the formulations interchangeable for 
trials with dose-finding/dose-confirmation character like trials 1160.106 and 1160.108. Furthermore, trough 
levels were similar for the 3 formulations. Thus, it was concluded that a conversion factor does not need to 
be applied for dosing purposes in children for dose finding/confirmation trials. These 2 trials are included in 
the summary of biopharmaceutical studies and associated analytical methods to support the formulation 
development but are excluded from the analyses in the SCE and SCS. 
Rationale for open-label design 
For trial 1160.106, an open-label design was chosen for several reasons. The different paediatric formulations 
of DE and the s.c. administration of some of the SoC treatments would have required an unethical number of 
dummy treatments in a blinded trial, especially considering the vulnerability of a paediatric trial population. 
Similarly, the constant INR monitoring required for some SoC treatments would also have had to be 
simulated for the DE group in a blinded trial. However, important efficacy and safety outcomes of the trial 
were adjudicated in a blinded fashion by an independent committee. 
An open-label design was also chosen for trial 1160.108 to enable ongoing DMC review of outcomes within 
the trial, as well as other related trials with DE in paediatric patients. It ensured the safety of the patients in 
the trial. Furthermore, it allowed modifications of the trial design, sequential inclusion of younger patients, 
and, if warranted, recruitment of further patients. The single-arm design was considered adequate for this 
safety trial, especially since results from the controlled trial 1160.106 added to the interpretation of the 
results. 
Scientific  (EMA/SAWP/148452/1/2012/PED/II)  advice  on  clinical  and  quality  development  of 
products for treatment of paediatric patients aged from 0-18 years was requested in 2013. 
The Applicant’s initial position was to develop 2 dosage forms for paediatric use, i.e. a capsule and an oral 
liquid form. 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 18/142 
  
  
 
The capsules were initially intended for use in children from 8 years, but it was questioned whether the 
acceptability results obtained for the 12 years old could be directly applied to the 8 years old children. 
The oral solution, which was prepared from granules and solvent, was initially intended for use in children up 
to the age of 8 years, but several problems were encountered with the initial formulation as follows: 
• 
Prolonged shaking (5 min) upon reconstitution 
•  Short  in-use  shelf-life  of  2  hours  due  to  stability  issues  requires  that  caretakers  must  prepare  oral 
solution twice a day for 3-6 months or longer periods. The volume in one bottle may be enough for an 
additional dose in the evening and it is thus tempting to store the remaining solution and use it in the 
evening. Storage for 1 or 2 days seems more optimal in relation to wastage and usefulness to carers. 
• 
Potential palatability issues due to administration of large volumes twice a day for prolonged periods. 
•  High dosing volumes due to dilute solution (higher concentrations would cause a more bitter taste and 
even longer reconstitution times). 
•  Measuring/dosing devices were not fully described; five different sizes were mentioned at that time but 
their dosing accuracy and acceptability were not elucidated. 
During the SA procedure the CHMP concluded that the oral solution was a rather deficient dosage form and 
an improved formulation or strategies to overcome acceptability issues should be suggested. 
The CHMP encouraged the Applicant to consider an additional dosage form such as mixing granules (pellets) 
with food in order to address acceptability issues with either the liquid or capsule formulations. The rationale 
was that capsules are likely to be opened, anyway, and their content of pellet mixed with food. Additional 
dosage forms should be explored, i.e. sachets containing capsule content, which could be useful for children 
not able to swallow capsules. 
In accordance with the advice given, the Applicant has developed all 3 dosage forms, i.e. capsules, coated 
granules and oral liquid formulation and re-defined the age-groups for which the respective dosage forms are 
intended as age-appropriate. 
In addition, the oral liquid formulation has been further optimised as regards stability, and the target age-
group has been re-defined to 0-1 years old. This considers that the impurity specification limits only allow 
maximum doses of 300 mg dabigatran etexilate. The complexity of reconstitution has been increased, since 
two different sachets with granules (one containing the active substance and one with a sweetener) are 
required to be dissolved in the solvent before administration in the proposed formulation. 
The advice given has been followed with respect to the points discussed above. 
It is noted that the scientific advice raised an issue regarding the bioavailability of granules from the capsules 
when it was opened and the granules sprinkled on food. The bioavailability was higher than for the intact 
capsules, see excerpt from the Final Advice Letter:  
 “At the meeting with the Applicant the mixing of capsule contents with food was discussed.   The Applicant 
provided  details  of  BI  trial  No,  1160.87,  which  considers  the  relative  bioavailability  of  dabigatran  after 
administration  of  a  single  oral  dose  of  150  mg  dabigatran  etexilate  (capsule,  powder  for  reconstitution  into 
solution,  and  coated  granules  on  food)  in  healthy  male  and  female  volunteers.    BI  states  that  the  coated 
granules were sprinkled on a teaspoon of the baby food (GERBER® Cereal for Baby, RICE single grain) and 
administered immediately (within a period of 10 minutes) with about 240 mL of water.  For the sprinkle the 
AUC0-inf was 175.1 % compared to the intact capsule.  From this study it was also noted that AUC0-inf was 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 19/142 
  
  
154.8 % for Test 2 (solution reconstituted from powder).   It is noted that the oral solution is more bioavailable 
than the capsules. Also, the capsules opened and mixed with food are more bioavailable that the capsules. This 
increase in bioavailability of capsules opened and sprinkled on food seemed unexpected.” (Final Advice Letter, 
21 March 2013) 
In the meantime, the Applicant has conducted a series of pharmacology studies to inform the dosing 
algorithm in the paediatric population. As described in the CTR section 7.2 on the Drug Profile, subheading 
Bioavailability of DE formulations used in the paediatric trials: “two Phase I trials in healthy adult volunteers 
(trials 1160.87 [U09-1839-01] and 1160.194 [c02248557-02; not part of the PIP]) were conducted to 
investigate the bioavailability of the formulations to be used in the paediatric clinical trials. Individual 
Cmax,ss and AUCτ,ss values observed for the 3 formulations (capsules, reconstituted solution from DE 
powder, and DE coated granules sprinkled on food) were within the range of exposure seen in previous trials. 
The noted increase in exposure was small enough to consider the formulations interchangeable. Furthermore, 
trough levels were similar for the 3 formulations. Thus, no conversion factor needs to be applied for dosing 
purposes in children for dose finding/confirmation trials.” 
However, in the clinical paediatric studies the apparent relative bioavailability paradoxically turned out to be 
lower for oral solution and coated granules than for capsules. Having discussed this extensively with the 
Applicant during the current procedure, the Applicant is not able to explain this opposite bioavailability in 
children and adults. The dosing algorithm is taking the lower bioavailability into account and the issue will not 
be further pursued.  Please refer to the section on Clinical Pharmacology in this report for details.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
This application concerned a line extension for the addition of two new pharmaceutical forms and new 
strengths intended for paediatric patients grouped with a number of type IA and IB variations to update the 
information regarding the active substance and the currently authorised hard capsules. The type IA and IB 
variations are related to, or are a consequence of, the introduction of the two new pharmaceutical forms. The 
two new pharmaceutical forms are Powder and solvent for oral solution and Coated granules. The Powder and 
solvent for oral solution is 6.25 mg/mL; the new strengths in relation to the Coated granules are 20 mg, 
30 mg, 40 mg and 50 mg, 110 mg and 150 mg. 
Pradaxa 6.25 mg/mL powder and solvent for oral solution comprises three components for reconstitution:

per sachet; 
-  Solvent for Pradaxa oral solution in a bottle, containing 28 mL of a clear, colourless solution; 
-  Sucralose powder for Pradaxa oral solution in sachets, containing 70 mg of sucralose per sachet. 
Other ingredients in Pradaxa powder for oral solution are: mannitol and hydroxypropylcellulose. 
Other ingredients in Solvent for Pradaxa oral solution are: tartaric acid, hydrochloric acid (for pH-
adjustment), and purified water.  
The Sucralose powder for Pradaxa oral solution contains only sucralose. 
Pradaxa powder and solvent for oral solution is supplied as a medication kit that contains: 
•  1 carton box containing an aluminium bag that contains 30 PET/Alu/LDPE sachets of Pradaxa powder 
for oral solution and a desiccant.  
•  30 carton boxes which are referred to as individual preparation packs. Each pack contains: 
o  one PET/Alu/LDPE sachet containing Sucralose powder for Pradaxa oral solution,  
o  one amber glass bottle containing Solvent for Pradaxa oral solution, 
o 
o  one adapter for the bottle. 
two dosing pipettes (12 mL) and  
The co-packaged dosing pipettes and the adapter are CE marked medical devices. 
Pradaxa Coated granules is presented as single dose sachets for oral use containing 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 
50 mg, 110 mg and 150 mg of dabigatran etexilate (as mesilate) per sachet. 
Other ingredients are: Tartaric acid, acacia, hypromellose, dimeticone 350, talc and hydroxypropylcellulose. 
Pradaxa Coated granules are packaged in sachets made of PET/Alu/LDPE foil. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance used in the finished product is the same as in the already approved product Hard 
capsules. As a consequence, no evaluation is required for the active substance sections, except for the 
evaluation of the some proposed changes for the control of the active substance for the use in the oral 
solution, and the changes introduced with the variations grouped with this extension application (e.g. change 
of the acceptance limits for some of the parameters in the specification).  
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 21/142 
  
  
The specification of the active substance, dabigatran etexilate mesilate , used for capsules and coated 
granules is identical. The active substance specification used for granules for oral solution includes updated 
limits for polymorphism and the degradation products compared to the active substance used for capsules 
and coated granules. The updated limits are necessary to ensure the desired quality of the granules for oral 
solution.  
The following quality variations were applied for: 
B.I.b.1.c - Change in the specification parameters and/or limits of an AS, starting 
material/intermediate/reagent - Addition of a new specification parameter to the specification with its 
corresponding test method;  
B.I.b.1.b - Change in the specification parameters and/or limits of an AS, starting 
material/intermediate/reagent - Tightening of specification limits; 
B.I.b.1.d - Change in the specification parameters and/or limits of an AS, starting 
material/intermediate/reagent - Deletion of a non-significant specification parameter (e.g. deletion of an 
obsolete parameter); 
B.I.b.2.a - Change in test procedure for AS or starting material/reagent/intermediate - Minor changes to an 
approved test procedure;  
B.I.b.1.d - Change in the specification parameters and/or limits of an AS, starting 
material/intermediate/reagent - Deletion of a non-significant specification parameter (e.g. deletion of an 
obsolete parameter); 
B.I.d.1.a.1 - Stability of AS - Change in the re-test period/storage period – Reduction. 
The addition of testing parameter chromatographic purity to the specification for the raw material toluene-4-
sulfonic acid is justified and acceptable. 
The active substance specification was evaluated with respect to the paediatric dosing algorithm which 
includes a maximum daily dose of 660mg dabigatran etexilate (free base) for dosage forms capsules and 
coated granules and maximum daily dose of 300 mg for the granules and solvent for oral solution. Therefore, 
the specified impurities were re-evaluated with respect to toxicologically qualified levels and impurities with 
mutagenic potential were re-evaluated according to ICH M7. The re-evaluations did not impact the specified 
degradation products since the acceptance levels are still below the toxicologically qualified limits. However, 
the ICH M7 re-evaluation did result in a change of specification for alkyl methanesulfonates in the active 
substance and finished product and also to warnings in the SmPC that the oral solution is only to be used for 
neonates up to 12 months and that dosing volume is not to exceed 12 mL. 
A complete testing of the methane sulfonates was performed. All the results were below the reporting 
threshold. The proposed deletion of the testing for alkyl methanesulfonates impurities and the sum of all 
specified impurities are from the specification of the active substance has been sufficiently justified and is 
acceptable. 
The updated limit for an alkylsulfonate impurity in dabigatran etexilate mesilate active substance specification 
is accepted. The consequential update of the purity method for an alkylsulfonate impurity is accepted too. 
The replacement of the heavy metal test in the specification of the active substance by the provided risk 
assessment according to ICH Q3D(R1) is also accepted. The active substance reduced retest period is not 
dependent on its intended use (oral solution, coated granules or capsules). The new retest period and the 
proposed storage conditions are acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 22/142 
  
  
The changes in the active substance specification do not require additional validation of the analytical 
methods, with the exception of the method used for the determination of the desired polymorphic form, 
which was adequately revalidated.  
Batch results were provided from release testing of the active substance obtained using both synthesis 
routes. The testing was performed in accordance to the proposed specification. All the results were compliant 
with the acceptance criteria in the specification. 
All the applied variations are accepted.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Pradaxa Hard capsules 
The following quality variations related to the authorised finished product hard capsules were applied: 
B.II.d.1.a - Change in the specification parameters and/or limits of the finished product - Tightening of 
specification limits;  
B.II.d.1.d - Change in the specification parameters and/or limits of the finished product - Deletion of a non-
significant specification parameter; 
B.II.d.2.a - Change in test procedure for the finished product - Minor changes to an approved test procedure;  
B.II.c.1.c - Change in the specification parameters and/or limits of an excipient - Deletion of a non-significant 
specification parameter (e.g. deletion of an obsolete parameter). 
The specifications for dabigatran etexilate hard capsules (all strengths) are updated since the control strategy 
for alkyl methanesulfonates was re-assessed in accordance with ICH M7 in the context of the expansion into 
the paediatric population which leads to a higher maximum daily dose i.e. 660 mg (dabigatran etexilate (free 
base)). 
It has been sufficiently justified why alkylmethanesulfonate impurities are omitted in the hard capsules 
specification. It is considered acceptable, based on presented batch results and the presented stability data 
that a single alkylsulfonate impurity is only tested on pellets (intermediate) and hard capsules finished 
product during shelf-life with the proposed tightened limit. The proposed change to the analytical procedure 
for purity is acceptable. The deletion of heavy metal test and the Japan-specific parameters Characters from 
the specification for the excipient HPMC capsule shells is also acceptable.  
All the applied variations are accepted.

Pradaxa Powder and solvent for oral solution  
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is supplied as a medication kit comprising three components, to be mixed before 
administration of the oral solution: 
-  Dabigatran etexilate powder for oral solution, 180.4 mg/ sachet: a yellowish-white powder in sachets; 
-  Solvent for dabigatran etexilate oral solution, 28 mL/ bottle: a clear, colourless solution; 
-  Sucralose powder for dabigatran etexilate oral solution, 70 mg/ sachet: a white to almost white powder in 
sachets. 
The qualitative composition of each of the three components is shown in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report and in 
section 6.1 of the SmPC. The oral solution is prepared prior to administration by dissolving dabigatran 
etexilate powder for oral solution and sucralose powder for oral solution in the solvent for dabigatran 
etexilate oral solution. The concentration of dabigatran etexilate (free base) in the oral solution is 
6.25 mg/mL. The dose ranges from 6.25 to 143.75 mg corresponding to dosing volumes of 1 to 23 mL, 
administered by the oral syringes.  
Pradaxa powder for oral solution, is packaged in a sachet made of a three-ply foil composed of an outer 
polyester film, an aluminium foil layer and an inner low-density polyethylene (PET/Alu/LDPE). The aluminium 
bag that contains the Pradaxa powder for oral solution sachets and the desiccant is also made of 
PET/Alu/LDPE foil; the desiccant is labelled with “DO NOT EAT” including pictogram and “SILICA GEL”. 
The Solvent for Pradaxa oral solution, is packaged in an amber glass bottle with a polypropylene/ 
high-density polyethylene (PP/HDPE) screw-cap with a nominal volume 60 mL and a 2-piece plastic closure. 
The Sucralose powder for Pradaxa oral solution is packaged in a sachet made of a three-ply PET/Alu/LDPE 
foil. 
Pharmaceutical development 
A quality target product profile (QTPP) was established for dabigatran etexilate oral solution, describing 
requirements of the medicinal product to be developed, and critical quality attributes (CQA) were defined. 
Critical process parameters and critical (in-process) material attributes were identified. 
The selected oral solution formulation was designed to meet the quality targets concerning age 
appropriateness, specifically dosing flexibility and accuracy (two dosing syringes provided, 12 mL), 
acceptable taste, acceptable excipients for paediatric use and acceptable stability particularly during the in-
use period. 
Excipients selected for dabigatran etexilate powder and co-supplied solvent for oral solution and the excipient 
sucralose are commonly used in oral formulations. These excipients are soluble in water to be able to provide 
a clear oral solution after solubilisation in the co-supplied solvent. All except the peach flavour are described 
in Ph. Eur. The choice and function of the excipients in the formulation has been described. Compatibility of 
excipients has been demonstrated. 
The maximum intake of all excipients has been evaluated from a toxicological perspective as outlined in the 
Guideline on pharmaceutical development of medicines for paediatric use, EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012 
Rev. 2. Based on present knowledge mannitol, hydroxypropyl cellulose, tartaric acid, propylene glycol in 
peach flavour, and sucralose at the maximum intended dose in the oral solution are considered to have no 
adverse effect when orally administered at the intended dose in the oral solution formulation.

The active substance’ solubility is pH dependent (high solubility at low pH and low solubility at pH 5 and 
above). In order to maintain adequate solubility, leading to a clear solution, a low pH was required for the 
formulation. As the active substance is sensitive to hydrolysis at low pH, the active had to be separated from 
the acidic aqueous solvent until the moment of the preparation for administration of the finished product. 
Moreover, in order to ensure patients compliance, the bitter taste of the active substance had to be masked. 
This was achieved by using sweeteners and a flavouring agent. 
It was established by relevant studies that a preservative was not needed in the formulation of dabigatran 
etexilate powder for oral solution which is anyway intended to be used within a short period of time. The 
choice of sucralose as sweetener has been justified on stability and palatability grounds. A major objection 
was raised relating to the development of three components which need to be combined to produce the final 
oral solution, because the complexity of reconstitution steps could increase the risk of medication errors 
occurring. However, the presented stability data justified the need for the three-component system. In 
addition, as discussed below, the results of a usability study showed that the probability of medication errors 
is low. The major objection was therefore considered resolved from a quality perspective. See also further 
discussion below in Clinical aspects. 
Several studies were performed to evaluate the time needed for the dissolution of the active substance in the 
solvent and the type of solvent. Based on these studies, the optimum composition and pH of the solvent were 
determined. 
A formulation with a flavouring agent was preferred, based on the presumably better acceptability by the 
patients and the acceptable risk from the intake of additional excipients, such as propylene glycol.  
An adequate discussion, supported by relevant, data, of the related substances that could be formed under 
the conditions of the manufacturing process or preparation of the oral solution was provided especially in 
relation to alkyl methane sulfonates, degradation impurity as well as the  active substance polymorphic form; 
appropriate controls were introduced in the specification of either the active substance or the finished 
product. 
Manufacturing process development  
The manufacturing process for dabigatran etexilate powder for oral solution consists of the two main process 
steps: granulation and sachet filling (primary packaging), followed by subsequent steps for bulk packaging, 
and protective secondary packaging of the final product. Granulation optimisation was driven by the need for 
an adequately short reconstitution time for preparation of the oral solution and the chemical stability of the 
active substance. The process was successfully transferred to the proposed commercial site and scale. 
The manufacturing process for the solvent consists of two main process steps: preparation of solvent 
solution, and filling of the solution into bottles and closing of the bottles. The process was successfully 
transferred to the proposed commercial site and scale. The manufacturing process for the solution is a series 
of mixing steps with a filtration step at the end. The filtered solution is filled into bottles, so that each bottle 
is a single dose unit, containing the amount of solvent required for dissolving the contents of one dabigatran 
etexilate sachet and one sucralose sachet. 
The manufacturing process for sucralose consists of the process for packaging of sucralose granules into 
sachets to yield the unit doses of sucralose powder for dabigatran etexilate oral solution (70 mg/ sachet). It 
was developed at the commercial manufacturing site directly. 
The changes of the composition of the dabigatran etexilate powder and of the solvent during clinical 
development have been clearly presented. Also, a short overview of the history of the development of the 
manufacturing process for each of the components was provided. 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021

Potentially critical in-process material attributes and process parameters were investigated during the 
process development of the granules and the solvent. Sucralose did not require an initial risk assessment 
since it only involves a packaging operation. Potential relationships between the in-process material 
attributes, process parameters and the Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) were investigated, to evaluate 
suitable process settings or proven acceptable ranges (PARs). These ranges were used to gain process 
knowledge to ensure adequate process performance during routine production. No Design Space (DS) is 
claimed. The PARs and recommended process parameter settings intended for commercial scale for every 
individual step of the processes for dabigatran etexilate powder, for the solvent and for the sucralose powder 
were provided. 
Medication kit 
The oral solution has to be prepared by the caregiver before administration. Each medication kit is composed 
of an inner box (medication box) containing 30 sachets with the powder for the oral solution, packed with a 
desiccant, and 30 individual preparation packs, each of them containing the solvent for the oral solution, a 
sachet containing the sucralose and the syringes for the administration (2 syringes for oral administration 
(dosing pipette) for dosing up to 12 mL, as well as a bottle adaptor) as shown in Figure 1. In order to avoid a 
mix-up of dabigatran etexilate powder and sucralose, the sachets are different in colour (silver and white 
respectively) and size. The desiccant pouch is a white plastic fibre pouch distinguishable from the aluminium 
dabigatran etexilate powder sachets.

In a usability study with representative samples of the market presentation, all test participants, lay 
caregivers and healthcare professionals (HCPs), were aware that two different sachets are needed for 
preparation of the oral solution. All test participants (lay caregivers and HCPs) were able to locate the 
medication granules and the sweetener needed for the preparation of the oral solution. Thus, the probability

of medication errors due to the presence of two different sachets to be used for preparation of the final 
formulation before use is considered as low. 
Compatibility  
The solution is not compatible with any beverages or food, and should not be co-administered, because a risk 
of precipitation due to pH differences, which would not guarantee the correct dosing.  
The oral solution was shown to be compatible with nasal tubes of the following materials: PVC, polyurethane 
and silicone. Compatibility study were performed using nasal tubes in polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethane 
and silicone with different lengths (from 110 to 38 cm). Water is recommended as a flushing liquid, based on 
the results of the compatibility studies performed with water, apple juice and the solvent solution. Studies of 
the volume of liquid needed for flushing were also performed, and it was concluded that a volume equal to 
the volume of product administered is necessary for the flushing from short and small nasal tube, whereas a 
volume twice the one administered is required for flushing the product from wider and long tubes. 
Container closure system and medical devices 
The container closure system of the powder for the oral solution comprises an aluminium sachet as primary 
packaging and an aluminium bag with desiccant as secondary protective packaging to protect dabigatran 
etexilate powder for oral solution in sachets from moisture. The sachets are manufactured from three-ply foil 
composed of an outer polyester (PET) film, an aluminium foil (Alu) layer and an inner polyethylene (PE) film. 
The polyethylene (PE) film layer is the layer in contact with the dabigatran etexilate powder. A similar three-
ply aluminium foil is used for the secondary protective package. Compliance of the materials with the EU food 
legislation on materials intended to come into contact with food is declared. The sachets have been tested as 
child resistant packaging according to US 16 CFR§1700.20. Compatibility between dabigatran etexilate 
powder and the aluminium sachet has been demonstrated during formal stability studies. 
The container closure system for solvent consists of an amber glass bottle, glass nominal volume 60 mL and 
a 2-piece plastic closure. The bottle contains 28 mL solvent. The container closure system is child resistant 
according to 16 CFR part 1700 and tamper evident. Although the reconstituted oral solution is not 
photosensitive an amber glass bottle was selected as a conservative measure. However, although the amber 
glass bottle obscures some light, differentiation between air bubbles and undissolved powder can be observed 
visually through the bottle during the preparation of the oral solution. 
The container closure system for the sucralose powder consists of an aluminium sachet as primary 
packaging. The sachets are manufactured from a white three-ply foil composed of an outer polyester (PET) 
film, an aluminium foil layer and an inner polyethylene (PE) film. The polyethylene (PE) film layer is the layer 
in contact with the sucralose. Compliance of the materials with the EU food legislation on materials intended 
to come into contact with food, is declared. The container closure system is compatible with sucralose as 
demonstrated through stability testing of the sucralose in sachets under long term and accelerated testing 
conditions. The sachets have been tested as child resistant packaging according to US 16 CFR§1700.20. 
CE marked dosing syringes (2x12 mL) are provided for the administration of the product. On the 12 mL 
dosing pipette, a scale from 0 to 12 mL with 0.25 mL graduation is printed. With regard to the dosing 
accuracy of the syringe a validation study was conducted in order to show compliance with the requirements 
of Ph. Eur. method of analysis 2.9.27 Uniformity of mass of delivered doses from multidose containers. The 
enclosed adaptor is also CE marked. Compliance with the food legislation on plastic materials intended to 
come into contact with food has been declared by the medical device manufacturers.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Dabigatran etexilate powder for oral solution 
The  manufacturing  process  is  a  standard  process,  comprising  the  following  main  steps:  wet-granulation, 
screening  and  drying,  filling  into  sachets,  secondary  packaging  into  an  aluminium  bulk  bag  together  with  a 
desiccant pouch. The granules are moisture sensitive and packaging is performed in controlled low-humidity 
environment.  
During the packaging process, each sachet is labelled and the correct number of labelled sachets appropriate 
to the pack size is placed in an aluminium bag for secondary protective packaging together with a desiccant. 
The filled aluminium bag is heat-sealed, labelled and placed into a folding carton, together with a package 
insert. The packaging process sis also performed under controlled environmental conditions. 
The  aluminium  bag  is  then  combined  with  the  preparation  packs,  containing  the  solvent  for  oral  solution, 
28 mL/ bottle, the sucralose powder for oral solution, 70 mg/sachet, the adapter and oral syringes (2x12 mL), 
and package insert into the medication kit. 
The  controls  of  the  critical  steps  during  the  manufacture  of  the  granules  were  presented,  with  suitable 
acceptance criteria. The specification used for the control of the granules, considered to be the intermediate 
obtained during the process, as well as details on the methods used for the controls and their validations were 
provided. 
The proposed holding time for the intermediate granulate and bulk storage of sachets with granules is supported 
by stability data. During storage periods an increase in the content of a specified genotoxic impurity is observed; 
however, results are still well within the release specification limits. Satisfactory information and specifications 
of the packaging material used for bulk storage were provided, including specifications for the desiccant. 
The  process  validation  was  performed  on  three  production  full  scale  batches  manufactured  at  the  proposed 
manufacturing  site.  The  validation  covered  the  manufacturing  of  the  granules,  their  filling  into  sachets  and 
packaging of the sachets into the bulk bags containing the desiccant and included extensive monitoring. 
Solvent for oral solution 
The manufacturing process for the solvent is a standard process, including the preparation of solvent solution 
(through a series of steps for dissolving the excipients, pH adjustment, and filtration) and filling into bottles.  
Critical steps have been indicated and acceptable in-process controls are applied during the manufacture of 
the solvent. 
The manufacturing process was evaluated on two batches manufactured at the intended batch size and site. 
In addition to the in-process controls proposed for the manufacture of the commercial batches, the validation 
batches were subjected to more extensive monitoring. The results obtained show compliance with the 
acceptance criteria and are similar between batches. 
Sucralose powder for oral solution 
The manufacturing process for the sucralose is a standard process involving simply the filling of sucralose as 
supplied by the supplier into sachets.    
Critical steps were identified and acceptable in-process controls are applied. A process validation study was 
performed on three batches at the proposed batch size and site. The results confirmed the reliability of the 
packaging process.

Conclusion  
The  manufacturing  processes  for  each  of  the  three  components  of  the  medicinal  product,  the  dabigatran 
etexilate granules, the solvent for the oral solution and the sucralose powder, have been described in sufficient 
detail. The overall control strategy for the three components of the medicinal product is considered adequate. 
Process validation at commercial scale has been performed for all three components. It is considered that all 
processes  are  adequately  under  control  in  order  to  consistently  obtain  a  product  that  complies  with  the 
specifications. 
Product specification 
The Pradaxa powder for oral solution release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits 
for description (visual), water content (Karl-Fischer), identification (HPLC-UV), assay (HPLC-UV), degradation 
products (HPLC-UV), uniformity of dosage units-content uniformity (Ph. Eur.), purity (GC-MSD) and 
microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.), reconstitution time and description of oral solution.  
The Solvent for Pradaxa oral solution release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits 
for description (visual), pH (Ph. Eur.), identification of tartaric acid (colour reaction), volume of contents 
(gravimetry), loss of mass (gravimetry), microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological quality BCC 
(USP). 
The Sucralose powder for Pradaxa oral solution release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests 
and limits for description (visual), identification (IR), weight of contents (gravimetry), assay (Ph. Eur.), 
impurities H and I (Ph. Eur.), specific optical rotation (polarimetry), water content (Karl-Fischer) and 
microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.).  
The proposed specifications of the three components of the product are acceptable and the proposed tests 
are relevant for each of the components. The specification limits have been set in line with ICH Q3B(R2), 
Q3C(R7), Q6A and ICH M7, as well as batch results and relevant pharmacopoeial standards.  
The proposed limits for specified and total degradation products are qualified conservatively at a maximum 
daily dose of 660 mg/day proposed for the paediatric population and inside the safety margin established by 
toxicology studies. For oral solution the maximum daily dose is 287.5 mg (conservatively rounded to 300 
mg). 
The proposed limits for specified and total degradation products in the specification of dabigatran etexilate 
powder are set based on the maximum daily dose of 287.5 mg/day (conservatively rounded up to 300 mg 
/day in the calculations for an alkylsulfonate impurity), proposed for the paediatric population and inside the 
safety margin established by toxicology studies.  
The omission of polymorphic form testing has been justified since the polymorphic form does not change 
during manufacture and storage of the finished product. Polymorphism is controlled in the active substance 
specification. The amount of isopropanol was found to be < 50 ppm in the intermediate granulate during 
development and process validation. Thus, testing in the finished product is not warranted. 
A risk assessment for the oral solution was performed as per ICH Q3D guideline to evaluate the potential 
presence of elemental impurities. The same maximum daily dose of 660 mg was used as for Hard capsules 
and Coated granules, to calculate the maximum intake of each of the excipients and the active substance. 
Elemental impurity data show levels well below the corresponding control threshold of 30% of the permitted 
Assessment report

daily exposure (PDE). The controls already in place for the active substance and finished product (oral 
solution) ensure that elemental impurities in the finished product will be maintained below the respective PDE 
levels and thus no controls are warranted. 
Risk assessments, in line with the “Questions and answers on Information on nitrosamines for marketing 
authorisation holders” and the “Information on nitrosamines for marketing authorisation holders” published 
on the EMA website, have been presented for both the finished product manufacturing process and the active 
substance with respect to potential formation of nitrosamine impurities. The outcome of the risk assessment 
confirms that there is no risk for nitrosamine impurities formation and no risk for cross-contamination with 
other products. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. The same analytical methods as used for the control of the capsules are used for the control of 
the granules. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of 
finished product has been presented.  
Batch analysis  
Dabigatran etexilate powder: Batch analysis results from 13 commercial size batches of dabigatran etexilate 
powder for oral solution, including the process validation batches and primary stability batches/clinical 
batches. Results comply with the proposed specifications and therefore indicate consistent manufacture of 
this finished product component. 
Solvent for oral solution: batch analysis of 25 batches supplied for clinical trials, stability studies and process 
evaluation were presented. Batches that are representative of the commercial product are also included, 
including one of the evaluation batches. Results comply with the specifications and therefore indicate 
consistent manufacture of this finished product component. 
Sucralose powder: Batch information was provided for six production scale batches used for stability and/or 
clinical studies. No batch analysis were presented because it was demonstrated that the packaging of 
sucralose granules into sachets has no influence on the stability, as no relevant changes were observed for 
any of the test parameters and the original control strategy justified full release of the excipient along with 
manufacturing controls performed according to GMPs to ensure the suitability of the filling and packaging 
process. However, CHMP recommends that the applicant will generate batch release data for future batches 
as per the specification (REC3). Until new batches of sucralose powder are generated, the presented process 
validation data and stability data can be viewed in lieu of release data to demonstrate the proposed release 
test parameters comply with the specifications and therefore are reassuring of consistent manufacture of this 
finished product component. 
Stability of the product 
Pradaxa powder for oral solution: 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of this product component stored for up to 24 months under 
long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  stability  batches  were  manufactured  by  the  proposed 
manufacturer and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were analysed for description, water content, assay, degradation products, purity: alkyl 
methanesulfonates, reconstitution time (oral solution), description (oral solution) and microbiological quality 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 30/142 
  
  
(annually) and polymorphic purity. The polymorphic form was monitored by Raman spectroscopy for 
information. 
At the long-term condition, only a slight increase in the degradation product is observed. An increase of a 
specified alkylmethanesulfonate impurity over time was observed at long term and accelerated storage 
conditions for one of the batches. At the accelerated storage condition, an increase in the degradation 
products is observed in all three stability batches. However, under both storage conditions all results meet 
the proposed shelf life specifications.  
Stress studies 
Stress stability studies were performed assess the influence of light and open storage on the stability of 
dabigatran etexilate powder. Data were presented for one production scale primary stability batch 
manufactured at the commercial site, according to the proposed commercial manufacturing process. The 
following stress conditions were evaluated: photo stability testing according to ICH guideline Q1, open 
storage stress testing. Parameters investigated were description, water content, assay, degradation products, 
purity: alkylmethanesulfonates, reconstitution time (oral solution), description (oral solution). During stress 
stability testing, individual alkylmethanesulfonate impurities, and the sum of all specified alkyl 
methanesulfonates were determined. For the commercial product, only one alkylmethanesulfonate impurity is 
specified. All results remained within the specification limits; it is concluded that dabigatran etexilate powder 
is not sensitive to light but that it is sensitive to open storage at elevated temperature. 
In-use stability 
Pradaxa powder for oral solution: An in-use stability study was performed on one commercial scale batch at 
25°C/60 % RH by opening the outer bag and removing the desiccant. Data up to 4 months were presented. 
Parameters investigated: description, water content, assay, degradation products, purity: 
alkylmethanesulfonates, reconstitution time (oral solution), description (oral solution) and microbiological 
quality (annually) and polymorphic purity (for information). All results comply with the specifications.  In 
addition, CHMP recommends (and the applicant has committed) to perform the in-use stability studies for 
batches close to the end of shelf-life (REC1). 
Based on the results the SmPC 6.3 recommends: “Once the aluminium bag containing the sachets is opened, 
the medicinal product must be used within 4 months. The sachets should not be opened prior to use.”, “The 
opened sachet cannot be stored and must be used immediately after opening.” 
Based on the overall stability data the proposed shelf life of 2 years with storage conditions “The aluminium 
bag containing the sachets with the powder for oral solution should only be opened immediately prior to use 
of the first sachet in order to protect from moisture” and “After opening of the aluminium bag, the individual 
sachets should be kept unopened until immediately prior to use in order to protect from moisture”,  is 
acceptable. 
Reconstituted oral solution: The study was undertaken to investigate the quality of oral solution for an in-use 
period of up to 48 hours on two commercial scale bathes. The batches of dabigatran etexilate powder for oral 
solution were previously stored for 12 months at 25°C/60% RH storage conditions. Parameters investigated: 
description, assay, degradation products, microbiological. All results comply with the specifications. 
A freeze/thaw study was performed on reconstituted dabigatran etexilate oral solution. The bottle containing 
dabigatran etexilate oral solution was stored upright during freezing. After the period of frozen storage, the 
bottle was allowed to thaw at room temperature for 4 hours until the oral solution was completely thawed. 
Assay, degradation products, description, and pH were tested before and after storage. Results indicated no 
negative impact on dabigatran etexilate oral solution occurred upon freezing. 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 31/142 
  
  
In-use stability study was performed at 25°C/60% RH for 6 hours and at 2-8°C for 48 hours mimicking the 
practical use of the product.  Parameters investigated: description, assay, degradation products, 
microbiological quality. All results comply with the specifications.  
In addition, CHMP recommends (and the applicant has committed) to repeat the practical in-use study using 
the slightly modified method of preparation (REC2). 
The photostability of the oral solution has been assessed during early development. Data confirm that the 
oral solution is not light sensitive during the in-use period. Protection of the oral solution from light is not 
required, but an amber glass bottle was selected as a conservative measure. 
Based on the results the SmPC 6.3 recommends: “Once reconstituted, the oral solution in the bottle can be 
stored for 2 hours below 25°C, or for 18 hours at 2-8°C (refrigerator). The bottles must be stored in an 
upright position.”, and the PL “Do not give the oral solution if it has been stored for more than 2 hours at 
room temperature. Discard the oral solution if it has been stored for more than 2 hours at room 
temperature.” These storage conditions and recommendations for the reconstituted oral solution are justified 
firstly on the basis of the submitted stability data; and secondly to prevent medication errors during use of 
the reconstituted oral solution. The proposed in-use storage times as set in the SPC are considered justified.  
Solvent for oral solution: 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of this product component stored for up to 18 months 
under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 
75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The stability batches were manufactured by the 
proposed manufacturer and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing and simulate the 
commercial product. Samples were stored upright and horizontally. Horizontal storage orientation shows 
slightly higher loss in solvent volume over time compared to upright storage at the same storage condition. 
Samples were analysed for description, pH, volume of contents, microbiological quality (annually). Some out-
of-specification (OOS) findings triggered a thorough, cross product root cause investigation resulting in 
appropriate corrective actions and preventive measures (CAPAs), which were identified and implemented at 
the supplier of the glass bottles introducing bottles of improved quality.  
Additional stability studies on three batches of solvent filled into the improved quality bottles have been 
performed and results were presented after 12 months at 25°C/60% RH and 6 months at 40°C/75% RH. No 
glass particles have been identified, thereby demonstrating the suitability of the CAPA measures and ruling 
out compatibility problems. For market supply, the improved quality glass bottles will be used. 
For upright storage orientation, no relevant change in volume of contents was observed at any storage 
temperature condition. As expected, horizontal storage orientation shows a slightly higher loss in solvent 
volume over time compared to upright storage. An OOS result for volume of content for one solvent bottle 
stored in horizontal orientation was observed after 6 months storage at accelerated storage conditions. The 
result of the OOS investigation attributed the cause to a manufacturing issue in the bottle closing process 
rather than a stability issue. An optimised bottle closing process will be implemented for future market supply 
and a test for loss of mass has been included in the stability protocol for the solvent bottles.  
Stress studies 
Stress studies were performed on one commercial scale batch to assess the influence of light and 
temperature on the stability of solvent for oral solution. Samples were irradiated as per ICH Q1B conditions 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 32/142 
  
  
 
and subjected to elevated temperature stress testing and were tested for description, pH, volume content. No 
changes in any of the tested parameters was observed at either condition. Based on the stability data the 
following shelf-life/ storage conditions are proposed:  24 months/ do not freeze. 
A freeze/thaw studies was performed to evaluate the appearance of the solvent and the integrity of the 
container closure system. The closed bottles were frozen in upright and inverted positions and then thawed at 
room temperature in the same positions. After storage, the bottles were inspected for cracks, damage, or 
leaking blue dye solution. No damage or leakage occurred. Hence, the bottle and closure combination remain 
tight after it has been frozen and thawed at room temperature, either in upright or inverted storage 
orientation, and with or without the inserted adapter. No change in appearance was observed either. 
Based on the overall stability data the proposed shelf life of 24 months without special storage conditions is 
acceptable. 
Sucralose powder: 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of this product component stored for up to 18 months 
under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 
75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The stability batches were manufactured by the 
proposed manufacturer and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing with the exception 
that sachets were printed instead labelled. 
Samples were tested for appearance, assay of sucralose, impurities, specific optical rotation, and water 
content. Microbiological quality and a visual assessment of the packaging material have been performed for 
information only. Although assay values fluctuate all results comply with the specifications and no special 
trends are observed at either storage condition.  
The results from stability studies support the proposed shelf-life of 36 months without special storage 
conditions. 
Adventitious agents 
There are no materials of human or animal origin in any of the three components of the finished product.  
Pradaxa Coated granules  
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is yellowish coated granules in sachets for oral use. The dabigatran etexilate granules 
are filled into single dose PET/Alu/LDPE sachets in order to achieve strengths of 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 
50 mg, 110 mg and 150 mg of dabigatran etexilate (free base) per sachet. The mesylate salt of dabigatran 
etexilate is used. 
This dosage form, coated granules, was developed for paediatric patients and is intended to be mixed with 
soft food prior to administration. The dabigatran etexilate granules used to fill the sachets is essentially the 
same intermediate granules used to fill the authorised hard capsules by corresponding adjustments in fill

weight. Different sachet labels with different colour markings were selected to support differentiation of the 
dose strengths to ensure correct dosing and to avoid medication errors.  
After opening the sachet, the entire content of the sachet is to be mixed with the recommended soft food and 
ingested together with the food. The composition of the finished product is presented in paragraph 2.2.1 and 
in section 6.21 of the SmPC.  
Development of coated granules for paediatric patients focused on an age appropriate formulation for oral 
use following PDCO request as oral solution was not considered to be the optimal formulation for all age 
groups. The aim was to provide a dosage form available over a range of dosage strengths for paediatric 
patients that are not able to swallow capsules but able to swallow coated granules mixed with soft food. 
The selected coated granules formulation is designed as appropriate to meet the quality targets concerning 
age-appropriateness, i.e., acceptability and ability to meet the desired administration scheme of the dosage 
form is given from a formulation design and a control strategy perspective  
Patient acceptability surveys for coated granules in sachets have been evaluated in clinical studies. Therefore, 
the administration approach to mix coated granules with soft foods is feasible for patients that can swallow 
soft food. 
In addition to the coated granules for the dosing of children aged 0 to <12 years, two alternative dosage 
forms are available: the already authorised capsules and a powder for oral solution (see above) was 
developed to specifically provide an age appropriate formulation for children <12 months. 
The coated granules comprise a spherical starter cores upon which the active substance layer is spayed. After 
ingestion, gastric fluids penetrate the active substance layer and (depending on the pH of the gastric fluids) 
partly dissolve the active substance layer. The composition facilitates the dissolution of the active substance. 
As the composition of the coated granules is identical to the composition of the granules in the authorised 
hard capsules, it is agreed that no further development work on the formulation of the product was 
necessary, as long as the excipients are demonstrated to be safe for the administration to paediatric patients.  
All excipients in the coated granules are commonly used and described in the European Pharmacopoeia. 
Approved excipient specifications for dabigatran etexilate capsules are referenced in the excipients section for 
the coated granules drug product. It is stated, that toxicological assessment was performed for each 
excipient; according to the procedure outlined in Guideline on pharmaceutical development of medicines for 
paediatric use, EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012 Rev. 2. 
Compatibilities studies of the product with food were performed with specified food and the provided results 
support the recommended administration instructions. The studies on food compatibility are representative of 
all dosing scenarios.  
The results from the stability study demonstrate compatibility of dabigatran etexilate coated granules when 
mixed with either rice cereal (prepared with water), apple sauce, carrot mush, banana mush, or apple juice 
for 30 minutes at room temperature. The recommended in-use period after mixing with food is 30 min. The 
results also demonstrated suitable compatibility of dabigatran etexilate coated granules when mixed with 
either rice cereal (prepared with water), apple sauce, carrot mush, banana mush, or apple juice for up to 30 
minutes at room temperature.  Due to the increase of the unspecified degradation product for coated 
granules in contact with milk products (e.g. yoghurt, vanilla pudding, or milk), it is not recommended to use 
milk products for administration purpose in the Product Information.

It has been shown that chewing the coated granules has no negative impact, as there is no functional release 
coating on the surface of the coated granules that could be damaged by chewing. During the clinical trials, 
chewing of the soft food mixed with the coated granules was not contraindicated nor required and no specific 
instructions on how to swallow the granules were provided. The applicant’s conclusion that no further 
instructions are required is considered justified. 
The method proposed for the dissolution is the same as for capsules. 
At 15 min the active substance layer was sufficiently dissolved. The dissolution of the coated granules was 
found to be strength independent. Representative dissolution profiles for all the granules strengths (20 mg, 
30 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg, 110 mg and 150 mg) were provided and show very similar dissolution profiles. 
The manufacturing process applied to manufacture the dabigatran etexilate coated granules for the 
commercial authorised capsule is used for the paediatric coated granules finished product. No further process 
development was required. The manufacturing process is a robust and well understood standard packaging 
process. The filling process of the sachets has been assessed during several evaluation runs. The focus of the 
process development of sachet filling was set on fill weight and tightness. Dabigatran etexilate is sensitive to 
moisture, therefore the room temperature and humidity conditions are considered critical and are controlled 
during the packaging process. The tightness of the sachets is critical in order to keep the low moisture 
content over the shelf life. 
In-process controls ensure that the specifications for the CQA ‘drug content’ and ‘drug content uniformity’ are 
met for each filled sachet. The accuracy of the net fill weight under production conditions has been verified in 
development runs and during process qualification. 
The container closure system consists of an aluminium sachet as primary packaging to protect the dabigatran 
etexilate coated granules from moisture. Each sachet contains the amount of coated granules that are 
required for the dose strengths. The sachets are manufactured from three-ply foil composed of an outer 
polyester (PET) film, an aluminium (Alu) foil layer and an inner low-density polyethylene (LDPE) film. The 
LDPE film layer is the layer in contact with the dabigatran etixilate coated granules. The aluminium bag and 
the desiccant pouch are not in direct contact with the finished product. It has been justified by stability data 
that the sachets alone do not provide sufficient protection against degradation and formation of the known 
degradation product. However, when stored in a secondary bag with desiccant the product is stable with no 
storage restrictions and a shelf-life of 36 months can be proposed. The PET film complies with the 
requirements of the food stuff regulation (EU) 10/2011 (as amended). The Alu foil complies with the 
requirements of the food stuff regulation EN 602:2004-07 (as amended). The LDPE film fulfils the 
requirements of the food stuff regulation (EU) 10/2011 (as amended) and of the Ph. Eur. monograph 3.1.3. 
for polyolefins. 
The functional secondary container closure system is an aluminium bag composed of an outer polyester (PET) 
film, an aluminium foil layer (Alu) and an inner linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) film. PET, Alu and 
LLDPE film layers of the secondary packaging also comply with the above-mentioned EC regulations and Ph. 
Eur. requirements as applicable. The bag additionally contains a desiccant cylinder to maintain a low moisture 
content of the coated granules in sachets throughout the storage period. The desiccant cylinder comprises 
Silica Gel with low density polyethylene (LDPE) as a binder and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) and 
titanium dioxide as coating. The quantity and the quality of the desiccant in the secondary packaging were 
considered to be critical for the quality of the finished product. The introduction of the desiccant is performed 
under controlled conditions. The desiccant cylinder fulfils the requirements of the food stuff regulation (EU) 
10/2011 (as amended).

The sachets have been tested on the basis of the desiccant method for packaging systems for oral dosage 
forms as described in USP <671> Containers – Performance Testing. The sachets have been tested as child 
resistant according to US 16 CFR§1700.20. 
Compatibility between dabigatran etexilate coated granules and the aluminium sachet has been established 
through stability testing of the finished product under long term and accelerated storage conditions as 
described in section Stability of the product below. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process comprises the following main stages and final secondary packaging: 
Preparation of spherical starter cores, coating of starter cores, drying and screening of coated pellets and 
packaging into sachets. 
The last stage of the process is the secondary packaging process, during which each sachet is labelled and 
the correct number of labelled sachets appropriate to the pack size is placed in an aluminium bag for 
secondary protective packaging together with a desiccant cylinder. The filled aluminium bag is heat-sealed, 
labelled and placed into a folding carton, together with a package insert.  
Each stage consists of a number of steps which were adequately described concerning process parameter 
settings. Four intermediate products are defined and are controlled by acceptable specifications. 
Critical process parameters (CPPs) and critical material attributes (CMAs) were identified. For the dabigatran 
etexilate coated granules the same in-process controls (IPCs) are in place as described for the intermediate 
dabigatran etexilate coated granules used for the manufacture of capsules. Holding times for the four 
intermediates have been established and are justified. 
Process validation covers the filling of dabigatran etexilate pellets into sachets and packaging of dabigatran 
etexilate coated granules in sachets into bulk bags that contain desiccant. For the process validation, an 
acceptable bracketing design was used. The holding times used for the 4 intermediates were also studied 
during process validation studies. 
The results of the process validation met the pre-defined analytical specifications and demonstrate that the 
manufacturing process will consistently produce dabigatran etexilate coated granules in sachets at the 
proposed strengths. Therefore, the primary and bulk packaging process has been successfully validated. The 
packaging process into the final secondary container has been assessed in 3 packaging runs. In addition, it 
has been sufficiently justified that bulk packaging and secondary packaging (final packaging) have no 
influence on the product quality for release. 
Overall, the process is considered successfully validated and that it is adequately under control in order to 
consistently obtain a product that complies with the specifications. 
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for description 
(visual), loss on drying (gravimetry), identification (HPLC-UV), assay (HPLC-UV), degradation products 
(HPLC-UV), uniformity of dosage units-content uniformity (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur., UV), purity (GC-
MSD) and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.), 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021

The same specification applied to the coated granules in sachets is used for the coated granules intermediate 
for the authorised capsules. The specification limit for the controls of alkyl mesilates was adjusted based on 
the dosing increase for the intended paediatric population and compliance to ICH M7. 
The proposed specification is acceptable, and the proposed tests are relevant for this type of product. The 
specification limits have been set in line with ICH Q3B(R2), Q3C(R7), and Q6A as well as batch results and 
relevant pharmacopoeial standards. The maximum daily dose for paediatric population is up to 660 mg. The 
impurities have been qualified in the adult formulation and dosage form of a daily dose of 300 mg/day. 
However, the results from toxicity studies performed in order to support the adult formulation also support 
the higher dose regimen of 660 mg/day. 
It has been adequately justified that the elemental impurity risk assessment performed for the dabigatran 
etexilate capsules in line with the ICH Q3D is valid and applicable for the dabigatran etexilate coated granules 
in sachets too. It is concluded that the potential daily intake of class 1 and class 2A elements as well as the 
intentionally added class 2B elements is consistently far below the 30% control threshold of the oral PDEs. 
Thus, no additional controls have to be implemented in the finished product specification.  
Risk assessments, in line with the “Questions and answers on Information on nitrosamines for marketing 
authorisation holders” and the “Information on nitrosamines for marketing authorisation holders” published 
on the EMA website, have been presented for both the finished product manufacturing process and the active 
substance with respect to potential formation of nitrosamine impurities. The outcome of the risk assessment 
confirms that there is no risk for nitrosamine impurities formation and no risk for cross-contamination with 
other products. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. The same analytical methods as used for the control of the capsules are used for the control of 
the granules. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of 
finished product has been presented.  
Batch results for the all the product strengths were provided for a total of 49 batches covering all strengths. 
These batches were used for clinical studies, process validation and stability studies. 
The results comply with the specification and therefore indicate consistent manufacture of the finished 
product. 
Stability of the product 
The stability studies were carried out on three batches of each tested strength manufactured at the proposed 
manufacturing site stored packaged in the proposed commercial container closure system (sachets in an 
aluminium  bag with desiccant) under long term conditions (25 °C ± 2 °C / 60 % ± 5 % RH) for 24 months 
and under accelerated conditions (40 °C ± 2 °C / 75 % ± 5 % RH) for 6 months according to the ICH 
guidelines. An acceptable bracketing approach between lowest and highest strengths has been applied. 
Samples were tested for description, loss on drying, assay, degradation products, dissolution, purity: alkyl 
methanesulfonates, and microbiological quality. The analytical methods used for testing the stability samples 
are the same as those used for release testing. An increase in degradation products was observed under both 
long term and accelerated conditions and assay values fluctuated with no clear trend for some batches or 
with a decreasing trend in other batches. At both storage conditions, a change over time is observed for the 
test parameter alkylmethanesulfonate towards lower values. In all cases the reported results complied with 
the specification under long term and accelerated conditions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021

In-use stability study was conducted for 6 months long-term storage at 25°C/60% RH on one batch from the 
20 mg, 30 mg and 150 mg strengths. The study was undertaken to investigate the quality of the product 
(sachets) stored in an opened aluminium bag without desiccant over a subsequent in-use period of 6 months 
to demonstrate the cumulative effect of long-term storage and patient handling. 
During the 6 months in-use testing, a slight increase on loss on drying and in the content of a degradation 
impurity was observed but the results were still well within acceptance criteria. For all other test parameters, 
no change was observed. Based on the results of this study the SmPC and PL instructions have been included 
in SmPC 6.3 and PL section 5 respectively. 
Stress stability studies were performed to assess the influence of light, elevated temperature and humidity on 
the stability of the finished product. Data were presented for two production scale primary stability batches, 
20 mg/ sachet and 150 mg/ sachet, manufactured at the commercial site, according to the proposed 
commercial manufacturing process. The following stress conditions were evaluated: photo stability testing 
according to ICH guideline Q1, elevated temperature stress testing, and humidity stress testing. Parameters 
investigated were description, loss on drying, assay, degradation products, dissolution, alkyl 
methanesulfonates, and microbiological quality. The results indicated that the finished product is not light 
sensitive and can withstand storage at the elevated temperature studied, when stored in the primary 
packaging material. The finished product was found sensitive to moisture. After open storage in the humidity 
stress study, a significant increase in the test parameters loss on drying and degradation products and a 
significant decrease in assay and dissolution was observed. The description of the coated granules changed to 
pellets, liquefied. No changes observed for the results for alkylmethanesulfonate impurities. 
Stability of the product has also been studied when mixed with different food for 30 min as discussed above 
in Pharmaceutical development and appropriate recommendations for administration of the dose were 
introduced in the SmPC (6.3) and PL. 
Based on the available data, the proposed shelf life of 3 years and storage conditions: “After first opening of 
the aluminium bag: Once the aluminium bag containing the sachets with the coated granules and the 
desiccant is opened, the medicinal product must be used within 6  months.”, “After first opening of the 
sachet: The opened sachet cannot be stored and must be used immediately after opening.”, “After 
preparation: After mixing with soft food or apple juice, the medicinal product has to be administered within 
30  minutes.”, as per SmPC sections 6.3 and 6.4 can be accepted.  
Adventitious agents 
None of the excipients is of animal or human origin. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The present application concerned a line extension for the addition of two new pharmaceutical forms and five 
new strengths (related to the Coated granules) intended for paediatric patients and one Type II variation 
introducing the paediatric indication, grouped with a number of type IA and IB variations to update the 
information regarding the active substance and the currently authorised hard capsules related to, or as a 
consequence, of the introduction of the two new pharmaceutical forms. The two new pharmaceutical forms 
are Powder and solvent for oral solution and Coated granules. The Powder and solvent for oral solution is 
6.25 mg/mL; the new strengths in relation to the Coated granules are 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg and 50 mg 110 
mg and 150 mg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 38/142 
  
  
The information on the control and retest period of the active substance has been satisfactorily updated by 
six Type IB/IA variations. The quality of the active substance used for capsules and coated granules is 
identical. The active substance quality for intended for the oral solution includes tighter limits for polymorphic 
purity and the degradation products, necessary to ensure the desired physicochemical and pharmaceutical 
properties for the reconstituted oral solution. 
The  information  on  the  control  of  the  authorised  hard  capsules  was  updated  by  four  Type  IB/IA  acceptable 
variations.  
The Pradaxa powder and solvent for oral solution has been developed as a three component product that 
requires reconstitution before administration. The granules for oral solution come as a separate sachet that 
needs to be combined with the solvent in the bottle and the sucralose powder sachet in order to prepare the 
oral solution which requires special storage conditions and dosing via a measuring oral syringe. A major 
objection was raised relating to the development of three components which need to be combined to produce 
the final oral solution, because the complexity of reconstitution steps could increase the risk of medication 
errors occurring. However, stability data justifying the need for this three-component system as opposed to a 
two-component system with granules and solvent have been provided. The major objection was therefore 
considered resolved from a quality perspective. See also further discussion below in Clinical aspects. 
The excipients are suitable for paediatric patients. Toxicological assessment was performed for each excipient 
in line with the Guideline on pharmaceutical development of medicines for paediatric use, 
EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012 Rev. 2. 
Satisfactory information regarding the development, the manufacturing process, stability and the overall 
control strategy for all three components of the finished product and the reconstituted oral solution has been 
provided. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that from a quality perspective the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform clinical performance. Three recommendation are proposed having no impact 
on the B/R balance. 
The Pradaxa Coated granules are essentially the same granules that are filled into the authorized hard 
capsules. However Hard capsule and Coated granules are administered based on different dosing tables for 
each pharmaceutical form as per the SmPC, see below in Clinical aspects. The coated granules are intended 
to be mixed with selected soft foods, for which compatibility has been demonstrated and are specified in the 
labelling. The excipients are suitable for paediatric patients and were toxicologically assessed in line with the 
Guideline on pharmaceutical development of medicines for paediatric use, EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012 
Rev. 2. 
The presented information for the development, the manufacturing process, stability and the overall control 
strategy is considered satisfactory. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that from a quality 
perspective the product should have a satisfactory and uniform clinical performance. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable and consistent. Physicochemical and biological 
aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled 
in a satisfactory way.

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for investigation: 
Pradaxa powder and solvent for oral solution: 
1.  to perform the in-use stability studies for batches close to the end of shelf-life for Pradaxa Powder for 
oral solution. 
2.  to perform a practical in-use study of the reconstituted oral solution according to the final approved 
Instructions for Use (IFU) prior to market launch. The oral solution will be reconstituted according to the 
final approved IFU and sample withdrawal for analysis will be done using the bottle adapter and oral 
syringe provided in the medication kit. Samples will be tested for assay and degradation products 
initially after preparation of the reconstituted oral solution, after 18 hours storage at 2-8°C and after 
subsequent warming up for 90 minutes and 120 minutes at room temperature. 
3.  to generate batch analysis data for future batches Sucralose powder as per the respective 
specification. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Two nonclinical juvenile studies have been submitted and assessed previously (EMEA/H/C/000829/P46/046). 
A summary of the previous assessment is presented below. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
No new data has been submitted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new data has been submitted. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The juvenile rat toxicity studies were already evaluated in procedure EMA/H/C/000829/P46/046. 
The following conclusions were drawn: 
“The juvenile toxicity studies presented by the Applicant were requested by the FDA and included a 
preliminary dose-range finding study and a pivotal toxicology study in neonate (7 day old) and juvenile (28 
day old) Han Wistar rats. Toxicological findings were seen primarily at doses above 70 mg/kg/day and were 
considered to be related to the pharmacology of dabigatran etexilate, i.e. haemorrhage-related. In the 
youngest animals, an approximately 5-fold increase in exposure was seen, which by the Applicant was 
proposed to be related to reduced activity of P-gp and carboxylesterase in neonate rats, in addition to pH-
dependent saturation of absorption due to high gastric pH in neonates. These explanations are considered

plausible. According to the Applicant, mortality in the juvenile toxicity study was associated with bleeding 
events at similar exposures at which bleeding was seen in adult animals. In both adult and juvenile rats, 
mortality is considered to be related to the exaggerated pharmacological activity of dabigatran in association 
with the exertion of mechanical forces during dosing and handling. Data of the juvenile toxicity study did 
neither indicate an increased sensitivity in nor any toxicity specific to juvenile animals.” 
Impurities 
The paediatric formulations of capsules and granulate have been capped at 22.2 mg/kg. Therefore, a 
maximum daily dose of up to 660 mg is proposed. The impurities have been qualified in the adult formulation 
and dosage form of a daily dose of 300 mg/day. However, the toxicity studies performed in order to support 
the adult formulation, also support the higher dose regimen of 660 mg/day. Please refer to the tables 8.2: 1 
through 5 in the nonclinical summary submitted in sequence 0282. In these tables, the presented exposure 
to the impurities identified in the nonclinical studies, exceed the possible exposure from the proposed 
specifications. 
For the oral solution formulation of 287.5 mg/day (rounded up to 300 mg /day in the calculations provided by 
the Applicant), the proposed impurity specifications are also within the limits qualified in the original studies. 
However, with regards to a specified genotoxic alkylmethanesulfonate impurity, the specifications are based 
on a maximum daily dose of 300 mg, hence the oral solution formulation is not suitable for infants with high 
bodyweights resulting in a daily dose above 300 mg/day. 
There is an observed alkylmethanesulfonate impurity in the active substance and finished product. According 
to ICH M7(R1), this is a class 3 impurity (positive in the (Q)SAR system for prediction of mutagenicity, 
DEREK Nexus, version 6.0.1 and Sarah Nexus, version 3.0.0) with an allowable daily intake of 1.5 μg for a 
treatment duration for > 10 years or lifetime.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant calculated the respective PEC/PNEC ratios of the various compartments, taking into 
consideration the multiple indications of dabigatran etexilate, i.e. the paediatric indication, which is the 
subject of the present application and the indications currently approved in adults as follows. 
PEC/PNEC ratios for Dabigatran etexilate 
Table 156:1 shows the maximum daily doses of Dabigatran etexilate of all approved indications as well as for 
the new indication, which is subject of the present application. 
The Applicant provided updated PEC and PNEC values for the various compartments considering all 
indications (daily dose representing the sum of the highest recommended daily doses for each indication) and 
default Fpen (0.01). This resulted in PEC/PNEC ratios lower than trigger values for all compartments, except 
sediment with a value slightly above 1. For the latter compartment, it is indicated that the PEC/PNEC ratio 
may actually be lower in view of the experimental conditions used in the OECD 218 study. In addition, this 
approach is considered as very conservative since the Fpen was not refined, notably for the paediatric VTE 
indication with the highest daily dose but whose incidence is reported in literature as below the EU orphan 
definition of 5:10,000. This has likely shifted the PECsed/PNECsed ratio from 0.71 (ratio without paediatric 
indication) to 1.12 (with paediatric indication) in a non-realistic manner.  
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 42/142 
  
  
 
 
The assessor calculated a refined PECsw value of 0.165 µg/L for the new paediatric indication considering a 
Fpen equal to the incidence rate for orphan drugs of 5:10,000 (10-fold higher than the reported incidence 
rate of paediatric VTE), with a subsequent PECsed value of 20.79 µg/kg. The addition of this additional 
parameter to those calculated for the already approved indications result in a global PEC/PNEC ratio of 0.73 
for the sediment compartment. This confirms that the approval of the new paediatric indication is unlikely to 
represent an additional risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
To support the paediatric extension of PRADAXA to patients from birth to 18 years of age, the applicant has 
conducted toxicity studies in rats at the request of the FDA. These studies were already evaluated in the 
context of an Art.46 submission (see EMA/H/C/000829/P46/046), and conclusions drawn at that time are 
endorsed. It is particularly noted that toxicological findings were seen primarily at doses above 70 mg/kg/day 
and were considered to be related to the pharmacology of dabigatran etexilate, i.e. haemorrhage- related. 
Mortality in the juvenile toxicity study was associated with bleeding events at similar exposures at which 
bleeding was seen in adult animals. In both adult and juvenile rats, mortality is considered to be related to 
the exaggerated pharmacological activity of dabigatran in association with the exertion of mechanical forces 
during dosing and handling. Data of the juvenile toxicity study did neither indicate an increased sensitivity in 
nor any toxicity specific to juvenile animals. 
No new impurity was identified in the drug products developed for paediatric use. The applicant has used the 
same reasoning as that used for qualification of these impurities in the drug substance and drug product 
already on the market and has adapted the specifications according to the doses recommended for children. 
Although from a toxicological point of view, the proposed limits for the specified genotoxic 
alkylmethanesulfonate impurity, for the two different formulation types are acceptable, the practicality of the 
two separate specifications for powder for solution and capsules and coated granules respectively are 
questioned. See also the quality assessment report for further discussion, and other concern raised. The daily 
intake of the ICH M7 class 3 methanesulfonate impurity has to be limited to 1.5 µg/day, therefore the use of 
the oral solution should be restricted to patients below 1 year of age. 
The applicant has provided additional discussion related to the environmental risk assessment. It is concluded 
that new paediatric indication is unlikely to represent an additional risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a nonclinical point of view, the application was considered approvable. Overall, no new pharmacology 
data have been submitted.

To support the paediatric extension of PRADAXA to patients from birth to 18 years of age, toxicity studies in 
rats have been conducted. These studies were already evaluated in the context of an Art.46 
EMA/H/C/000829/P46/046 which concluded that data of the juvenile toxicity study did neither indicate an 
increased sensitivity in nor any toxicity specific to juvenile animals. This information has been included in the 
SmPC section 5.3. 
The applicant has provided additional discussion related to the environmental risk assessment. It is concluded 
that new paediatric indication is unlikely to represent an additional risk to the environment. From a 
nonclinical perspective, there is no remaining nonclinical issue and the application was considered 
approvable. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The pharmacokinetics of dabigatran etexilate (DE) is well characterised in adults. The Applicant has 
conducted a clinical development programme in paediatric patients with venous thromboembolic events 
(VTE) in order to apply for an extension of indication. 
The clinical pharmacology study program of dabigatran in paediatric patients is comprised of three phase IIa 
trials and two phase IIb/III trials. Number of trial subjects with observations, age, and number of dabigatran 
observations in these trials are presented in Table 1. Matching PK and PD samples were collected from 
paediatric patients in all five clinical trials. Several population PK/PKPD analyses were conducted to confirm 
the dosing algorithms and to estimate the PK/PD responses in the paediatric population and compare it to 
adults. The initial pop PK models were based on the phase II studies whereas the following refined models 
included the larger dataset from the phase IIb/III studies. 
Three different formulations were employed in the dabigatran paediatric clinical development program: 
capsules, coated granules in sachets (coated granules), and oral liquid solution (OLF). The latter two were 
developed for the paediatric programme. In addition, a new 50 mg capsule was developed but based on an 
updated dosing algorithm this capsule strength was abandoned again. Prior to the paediatric studies, the 
bioavailability of the different formulations was examined in an adult trial population. 
The PK of DE in the paediatric population was examined in relation to impaired renal function, body weight, 
age, sex, and race. Also, effects of extrinsic factors in the form of drug-drug interactions with concomitant 
pantoprazole (gastric acid reduction) on PK was examined. Further, the effect of dabigatran on the PD 
endpoints aPTT, dTT, and ECT in paediatric patients was determined and compared to the adult study results.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
Analysis of dabigatran 
Specific and highly sensitive HPLC-MS/MS (high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass 
spectrometry) methods for the quantitation of dabigatran were developed and validated for the human 
biological matrices plasma and urine to support the clinical dabigatran etexilate development program. 
Methods were applied for the quantitation of non-conjugated dabigatran and of total dabigatran. Total 
dabigatran represents the sum of non-conjugated drug plus glucuronic acid conjugated dabigatran. As it was 
shown that the glucuronic acid conjugates of dabigatran do have similar pharmacodynamic activity as the 
active moiety dabigatran itself, total dabigatran was considered the primary “bio-relevant” pharmacokinetic 
measure. 
During the development program, two distinct bioanalytical LC-MS/MS methods were used to measure total 
dabigatran, non-conjugated dabigatran, dabigatran etexilate and intermediate semi-prodrugs in human 
plasma. According to the applicant, the second bioanalytical methods used for quantification of total plasma 
dabigatran (method n00239283) and for quantification of non-conjugated dabigatran, dabigatran etexilate, 
and intermediate semi-prodrugs (n00238725), respectively, were adequately validated. However, the full 
validation reports for these bioanalytical methods (n00239283 and n00238725) were not provided. 
PK parameters 
The PK properties of dabigatran were examined using both non-compartmental PK parameters (clinical 
studies) and a two-compartment disposition model (pop PK analyses) of standard PK endpoints (plasma conc. 
of total dabigatran, AUC, Cmax, Ctrough, Tmax, Cl/F, Vd/F, T½). 
Population PK and PKPD analyses 
Several pop PK/PKPD models were constructed during the program. These models were used to confirm the 
dosing algorithms, to evaluate the effects of selected covariates, to estimate the PK/PD responses in the 
paediatric population and compare it to adults. In the PK models, all disposition parameters were a priori 
allometrically scaled by body weight. The data set used in the pop PK analysis is seen in Table 1 above. In 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 46/142 
  
  
 
 
the final pop PKPD analysis, model predictions of dabigatran concentration-response for the aPTT, ECT and 
dTT clotting time in healthy adult subjects were used as a reference, for comparison with the paediatric data.  
The PK of dabigatran is best described by a 2-compartment model with first order absorption. 
The disposition parameters increased with rising body weight in accordance with allometric scaling. 
The population PK model parameter estimates of the final model for dabigatran are presented in 
Table 7.

The models are adequately described and validated. A VPC for the final population PK model is shown in Figure 
25. 
Dosing regimen 
The initial dosing algorithms were developed on the basis of an allometric relationship. This allometric 
method calculates glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in children as a function of age and body weight, and 
enables the calculation of paediatric doses by scaling down dosage from an adult reference patient. The 
intended paediatric exposure was the same as in the adult studies with a dabigatran reference trough 
exposure range of 26-250 ng/mL. Dose could be adjusted guided by dabigatran concentrations. Doses in the 
clinical studies ranged between 12.5 mg and 330 mg of DE twice daily.  
Absorption and Distribution 
Following an oral administration of DE to paediatric VTE patients, dabigatran etexilate was rapidly absorbed 
with peak plasma concentrations of dabigatran reached approximately within 2.5 hours of administration. 
This was followed by a rapid distribution phase and a terminal phase, with the typical elimination half-life in 
paediatric patients of approximately 10–16 hours. 
In pop PK analyses, the apparent volume of distribution was predicted to increase with age from 277 L in a 6 
months old child to 1598 L in an 18-year-old.

Bioavailability 
In adults, the absolute bioavailability of dabigatran following oral administration of DE capsules is about 
6.5%. 
Observed and projected steady state trough concentrations of DE stratified by age and mode of 
administration are depicted below in Table 3.2:4. For comparison, data from the adult study RE-COVER 
(1160.53) are shown as well. 
The observed steady-state trough exposure in the paediatric phase IIb/III trials (pooled PK analysis of 
1160.106 and 1160.108, Table 3.2:4 or Table 3.2: 5) was largely between the 10th and 90th percentile of 
the observed dabigatran plasma exposure of the adult VTE program [RE-COVER]. 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 50/142 
  
  
 
Bioequivalence 
Two adult phase I bioavailability studies (a single dose and a multiple dose study) with the new developed 
formulations were conducted. In the adults receiving oral solution and the coated granules in sachets, the 
apparent relative bioavailability of dabigatran was 1.17 and 1.26 times that for capsules, respectively. In 
contrast, in children receiving the oral solution and the coated granules in sachets, the apparent relative 
bioavailability of dabigatran was 0.705 and 0.649 times that for capsules, respectively. 
Influence of food 
In the adult development programme, it was shown that food does not affect the bioavailability of DE but 
delays the time to peak plasma concentrations by about 2 h. Influence of food was not evaluated in the 
paediatric population but the same effects as in adults are expected. 
Elimination 
The apparent clearance increases with age. The pop PK analysis demonstrated that clearance increases 
steadily from 18-20 L/h in 6 months old children to 96-108 L/h in 18 years old adolescents. The typical 
elimination half-life in paediatric patients was approximately 10–16 hours in all age groups. Dabigatran is 
eliminated primarily (approx. 85%) in the unchanged form by renal excretion. Only minor metabolism takes 
place; dabigatran is subject to conjugation forming pharmacologically active acylglucuronides (1-O, 2-O, 3-O, 
and 4-O-acylglucuronide), each account for less than 10 % of total dabigatran in plasma. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
As clearance is independent of dose in the final population PK model, dabigatran is expected to exhibit linear 
pharmacokinetics with dose-proportional increases in maximum plasma concentrations and area under the 
plasma concentration-time curves after single or multiple oral administrations in paediatric VTE patients. 
Multiple administrations of oral doses of dabigatran etexilate in paediatric patients resulted in an 
accumulation of dabigatran that is approximately 1.5- to 1.9- fold in the plasma and steady state was 
reached after approximately 2-3 days of dosing. 
Intra- and interindividual variability 
The intersubject variability (gCV%) based on trough concentrations was approximately 50% across all 
patients (0-<18 years old) in the pooled phase IIb/III paediatric studies, which is smaller than the 82% 
variability observed for adult VTE patients given fixed dose of 150 mg BID. 
Special populations 
The PK of dabigatran has been investigated in paediatric populations with different age, weight, race, gender, 
and renal function. The PK of dabigatran is affected by age, weight, and renal function. Accordingly, the 
dosing algorithm of DE has to take these factors into account. No dose adjustment seems warranted with 
eGFR >=50 mL/min/1.73m2. Patients with impaired renal function below 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 was excluded 
from the paediatric studies. The PK of dabigatran in patients with impaired hepatic function has not been

EMA/145360/2021 
Page 51/142 
  
  
investigated. Based on the final population model, disposition parameters increased with increasing body 
weight in accordance with allometric scaling. The apparent clearance increased with increasing age 
(independent of body weight); with half the maturation is reached at 52 weeks and 90% at around 125 
weeks postmenstrual age (corresponding to a postnatal age of 3 and 21 months, respectively). Clearance 
was on average 11% lower in females than in males, irrespective of the dabigatran formulation given. No 
dose adjustment is needed for sex. Based on the final population PK model, race or ethnic origin did not have 
any statistically significant influence on the PK parameters; however, the proportions of paediatric patients 
with these characteristics were low (Black n = 8; Asian n = 21). 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Dabigatran etexilate is poorly soluble in aqueous media at neutral pH, and its solubility is best at low gastric 
pH. It was, therefore, expected that effective elevation of gastric pH by proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) would 
affect the bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate. In adult studies, systemic exposure of dabigatran was 
reduced by approximately 30% when dabigatran etexilate was co-administered with the PPI pantoprazole. 
The paediatric pop PK analysis of the phase IIb/III data suggested that PPIs had no effect on exposure of 
dabigatran. No dedicated drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted in the paediatric program. 
Dabigatran etexilate is a substrate for intestinal P-glycoprotein (P-gp); when given together with a P-gp 
inhibitor, exposure to dabigatran is expected to increase. In vitro studies on human intestinal tissues indicate 
that the P-gp transporter function may be fully developed from birth. The data on interactions between P-gp 
and dabigatran for adults may thus be applicable to the paediatric patients. No dedicated P-gp inhibitor 
studies with dabigatran have been conducted in children. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Dabigatran etexilate is a well-known drug from the many years of adult use. Dabigatran is a potent, non-
peptide, competitive, oral direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) that specifically and reversibly inhibits thrombin, the 
penultimate enzyme in the coagulation cascade. The pharmacodynamic endpoints in the clinical studies were 
the usual blood coagulation parameters - activated thromboplastin time (aPTT), ecarin clotting time (ECT), 
and diluted thrombin time (dTT). 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The PD evaluation showed that the parameters dTT and ECT increased in direct linear proportion to the 
plasma concentration of dabigatran, whereas aPTT prolongation was not linearly related, but best described 
by an Emax model. 
A comparison of the resulting PKPD curves with the final aPTT model in typical paediatric and adult healthy 
subjects are shown in Figure 23. The PKPD relationships are similar between the children and the healthy 
adults. Much of the difference appears to be related to the difference in baseline. Generally, when correcting 
for baseline differences, the younger children achieve a somewhat higher response to dabigatran whereas the 
adolescents above 15 years achieve a slightly lower response than what was seen in healthy adults. 
Assessment report

A comparison of the resulting PKPD curves with the final dTT model in typical paediatric and adult healthy 
subjects are shown in Figure 29. The PKPD relationships are similar between the children and the healthy 
adults. The observed baseline was similar in the healthy adult and the pediatric populations with no identified 
age-related differences between the children. 
A comparison of the resulting PKPD curves with the final ECT model in typical paediatric and adult healthy 
subjects are shown in Figure 35. The PKPD relationships are similar between the children and the healthy

adults. Much of the difference appear to be related to the difference in baseline. Generally, when correcting 
for baseline differences, the very youngest children achieve a slightly higher response to dabigatran whereas 
children above 1 year of age appear to achieve a lower response, gradually decreasing with age, than what 
was seen in a typical healthy adult. 
When assessing the relative change of aPTT, ECT, and dTT from baseline, the exposure-response relationship 
was similar between the youngest children and the healthy adults. However, among the very young children 
below 3 months, a somewhat higher response than seen in the healthy adults was still present after 
correcting for baseline differences. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of DE in the paediatric development programme has been studied in children aged 0 to 
<18 years. The analytical methods used during the programme are described in details.  
Five clinical paediatric studies (three phase IIa trials and two phase IIb/III trials) have been conducted, all 
being part of the paediatric program for DE in compliance with the EU PIP. Several pop PK/PKPD models were 
part of the development program. The first models were constructed based on phase II data and the later 
models were built upon these initial models and included new data from the phase IIb/III studies. The 
models were used to confirm the dosing algorithms and to estimate the PK/PD responses in the paediatric 
population and compare it to adults. In the PK models, all disposition parameters were a priori allometrically 
scaled by body weight. The models are considered valid and suitable for the intended purposes. Prior to the 
clinical studies, two studies in adults investigating the bioavailability of two new formulations compared to 
capsules were undertaken. PK data from 450 individual children and adolescent subjects have been analysed. 
Matching PK and PD samples were collected from paediatric patients in all five clinical trials. The dosing 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 54/142 
  
  
 
 
 
regimen in the clinical studies was based on the children`s age and weight according to a predefined 
algorithm. The intended paediatric exposure was the same as in the adult studies with a dabigatran reference 
trough exposure range of 26-250 ng/mL. In the clinical trial, dabigatran concentrations were monitored and 
one dose adjustment allowed. More than one third had a dose adjustment. The PK of DE in the paediatric 
population was examined in patients with different renal function, body weight, age, sex, and race. Also, the 
effect of concomitant pantoprazole (gastric acid reduction) on PK was examined. The PK of dabigatran in the 
therapeutic dose range is expected to be linear in paediatric subjects. 
In the adult bioavailability studies, the bioavailability of capsules was lower than for both oral solution and 
coated granules in sachets. Thus, the different formulations are not bioequivalent. The relative bioavailability 
of the formulations was used to qualify the dosing regimen in the paediatric studies. However, in the clinical 
paediatric studies the apparent relative bioavailability paradoxically turned out to be lower for oral solution 
and coated granules than for capsules. The applicant was not able to explain this opposite bioavailability in 
children and adults. It was agreed that the dosing algorithm is taking the lower bioavailability into account.   
The youngest patients in studies 1160.106/1160.108 aged 0 to < 1 year (n=8 on oral solution) had the same 
trough exposure as the patients administered coated granules as well as the adults.  
For the typical paediatric VTE patient the half-life of DE is estimated to be relatively equal in paediatric 
subjects from 6 months to 18 years of age. 
The PK of dabigatran is affected by age, weight, and renal function. This is reflected adequately in section 4.2 
of the proposed SmPC. In adults, DE may be used with reduced doses in patients with eGFR > 30 mL/min. In 
contrast, renal GFR should be > 50 mL/min in paediatric patients.  
Gender or race do not seem to affect the PK of DE. According to normal procedure, no clinical drug-drug 
interaction studies have been conducted in the paediatric development programme. In the clinical studies, 
the use of pantoprazole was allowed. The PK of dabigatran in patients with impaired hepatic function has not 
been investigated; this is acceptable since 85% of dabigatran is excreted unchanged in the urine. According 
to the adult product information, dabigatran is subject to conjugation forming pharmacologically active 
acylglucuronides (1-O, 2-O, 3-O, and 4-O-acylglucuronide), with each accounting for less than 10 % of total 
dabigatran in plasma. The same metabolism is expected to occur in the paediatric population. 
The pharmacodynamic endpoints examined in the paediatric patients comprised aPTT, dTT, and ECT, and 
these results have been compared to the effects in the adult population. 
Doses in the clinical studies ranged between 12.5 mg and 330 mg of DE twice daily dosing. The dosing was 
based on weight and age in order to reach comparable exposure to that in adults. 
The clinical studies demonstrated a linear relationship between the plasma concentration of dabigatran and 
the PD endpoints ECT and dTT. For aPTT, a non-linear relationship was considered most appropriate. 
The PKPD relationships were examined in several pop PK and pop PKPD analyses. The PKPD relationships for 
dTT were similar between healthy adults and children of all age groups. For aPTT, the analysis showed higher 
values the younger the child. For ECT, the same tendency of higher values in the youngest children was 
found. For both aPTT and ECT, the differences could be explained by differences in baseline values since the 
exposure-response relationship was similar between the young children and the healthy adults when 
assessing the relative change of aPTT, ECT, and dTT from baseline. However, in the youngest patients below 
2-3 months of age, a higher PD response than seen in the healthy adults was still present after correcting for 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 55/142 
  
  
 
 
baseline differences. The PKPD relationships for dTT seem similar between healthy adults and children of all 
age groups supporting the dosing strategy to achieve comparable exposure across age groups.  
Overall, the trials in children and adolescents have shown that DE, except in the smallest children from 3 
months to 1 year, has a comparable PKPD relationship to that in adults. The PKPD analyses have 
demonstrated that the measured clotting parameters (aPTT, dTT, and ECT) generally respond in a similar 
way to dabigatran exposure in children and adults. The proposed dosing recommendations of the three 
formulations in children and the rationale and relevance of the proposed target range of 26- <250 ng/mL 
have been sufficiently justified. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology program conducted was comprehensive and adequate in terms of number of 
enrolled subjects and type of studies performed. There were no remaining concerns regarding PK/PD and the 
proposed dosing algorithms for different age groups and formulations was considered acceptable. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Table 1 shows the trials included in this grouped extension application for DE in paediatrics.  
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 56/142 
  
  
 
 
 
 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies and main studies 
In accordance with the PIP, this grouped extension application is based on data of several Phase I to Phase 
III trials (Table 1). All trials were performed in compliance with GCP and in accordance with applicable 
regulatory requirements and BI standard operating procedures. 
Of these, five trials (1160.87, 1160.194, 1160.88, 1160.89, and 1160.105) have investigated the 
bioavailability, PK, PD safety and tolerability.  
No formal dose phase II studies have been performed to identify the accurate dose regimen for each 
paediatric age categories. Dosing appropriateness and efficacy and safety were evaluated in parallel as per 
trial design (Phase IIb/III).  
As highlighted above, dosing rational is based on a PK/PD exploration targeting plasma dabigatran 
concentrations estimated for adults receiving approved doses for dabigatran.  
The two large Phase IIb/III trials (1160.106 and 1160.108) were still ongoing at the initial submission based 
on interim analysis results for this grouped extension application. These trials have both been completed in 
the meantime. An updated dossier with the final CTRs for both trials has been provided. Within the paediatric 
programme of DE, only trial 1160.106 was designed to evaluate the efficacy of DE versus a comparator while 
the remaining trials were single arm trials with DE. 
The interim CTRs covered all key binding elements as per PIP. Trial 1160.106 is an open-label, randomised, 
active-controlled non-inferiority trial comparing DE with standard of care (low molecular weight heparin 
[LMWH], vitamin K antagonist [VKA], or fondaparinux). It has a planned treatment duration of 3 months 
after initial parenteral therapy (at least 5 days and at most 21 days). While not clear in the initial submission, 
it has been clarified in the present submission that the course of the initial parental therapy is not included in 
the treatment period of 3 months with the randomised treatment of DE vs. SoC in study 1160.106. The 
Phase III trial 1160.108 with DE as single treatment arm is considered a safety trial and has a considerably 
longer planned treatment duration than trial 1160.106, i.e. up to a maximum of 12 months. The trial aims to 
provide critical information regarding the safety of DE for secondary prevention of VTE. Patients from trial 
1160.106 who were in continued need for anticoagulation could also participate in trial 1160.108. 
Recruitment in trials 1160.106 and 1160.108 continued until April 2019 for 1160.108 and July 2019 for 
1160.106 in order to comply with the FDA post marketing requirements and as part of the written request 
that has been issued by the FDA. The resulting final CTRs with the complete data set for trials 1160.106 and 
1160.108 have been provided and assessed within current procedure.  
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Within the paediatric programme of DE, only trial 1160.106 was designed to evaluate the efficacy of DE 
versus a comparator while the remaining trials were single arm trials with DE. Therefore, the clinical efficacy 
assessment is based on this trial only. 
However, reference is also made to Trial 1160.108 with DE as single treatment arm, which is considered a 
safety trial with a longer planned treatment duration than trial 1160.106, i.e. up to a maximum of 12 
months. This trial aims to provide critical information regarding the safety of DE for secondary prevention of 
VTE.

Of note, patients from trial 1160.106 who were in continued need for anticoagulation could also roll over to 
participate in trial 1160.108. At the time of the interim analysis, 88 patients had rolled over. In the final 
analysis overall, 91 patients (34.1% of the randomised patients in trial 1160.106) rolled over into trial 
1160.108. In addition, 122 patients were newly recruited and treated in trial 1160.108.  
The initial evaluation of efficacy was based on interim data of trial 1160.106. The interim database snapshot 
was created on 28 Mar 2019, when the required number of paediatric patients, as agreed in the PIP, had 
been reached: 
•  At  least  140  patients  evaluable  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  in  1160.106,  including  at  least  60 
patients in age stratum 1 (patients from 12 years to <18 years), and at least 18 patients in age stratum 
2 (patients from 2 years to <12 years) 
•  At least 100 treated patients in 1160.108 
•  At least 10 patients in age stratum 3 (patients from birth to <2 years) from both trials 1160.106 and 
1160.108 together (counting roll-over patients from 1160.106 to 1160.108 only once) 
All patients who had either completed trial 1160.106, had an early End of Treatment (eEOT) visit, or were 
still ongoing and had reached at least the time point of Visit 3 by 28 Feb 2019 (cut-off date for the interim 
analysis) were included in the interim analysis. For these patients, data from all visits that took place on or 
before 28 Feb 2019 were considered (see exception below for adjudicated data). Between the cut-off date for 
the interim analysis and the interim database snapshot date, data were cleaned and source data verified as 
complete as possible. Investigators were able to enter new data during this time (i.e. new visits occurring 
after 28 Feb 2019) or change existing data (i.e. based on the ongoing cleaning process). However, data from 
visits occurring after 28 Feb 2019 were disregarded for analysis. All outcome events were to be adjudicated 
and included, if possible. For a number of outcome events reported before the cut-off date for interim 
analysis, adjudication was not completed in time for the interim database snapshot, because source data or 
replies to clarification questions had reached the adjudication committee too late to provide a result on time. 
The primary efficacy analyses were performed on evaluable patients who had completed treatment or 
discontinued treatment prematurely and had the full set of adjudicated data available.  
The final analysis has now been provided with the following full data sets:

the Applicant’s responses to these questions are based on the final analysis of the full data sets. 
Study 1160.106 DIVERSITY 
Methods 
Trial 1160.106 was a multicentre, open-label, randomised, parallel-group, active-controlled, non-inferiority 
trial of DE versus standard of care (SoC) in children from birth to less than 18 years of age. The design of 
this trial (including the definition of endpoints and the choice of SoC comparators) has been agreed with the 
PDCO. This committee has previously endorsed the principal design elements and endpoints of the trial. 
An open-label design was chosen for several reasons. The different paediatric formulations of DE and the 
subcutaneous administration of some of the SoC treatments would have required an unethical number of 
dummy treatments in a blinded trial, especially considering the vulnerability of a paediatric trial population. 
Similarly, the constant international normalised ratio (INR) monitoring required for some SoC treatments 
would also have had to be simulated for the DE group in a blinded trial. Important efficacy and safety 
outcomes of the trial were adjudicated in a blinded fashion by an independent committee.

A specific comparator was not provided by the sponsor; instead, investigators were able to choose from 
several SoC treatments based on local practice. This was considered to reflect a real-world situation but does 
not allow for the comparison of DE against a distinct SoC comparator class or compound. Available options 
were LMWH, VKA, or fondaparinux; doses had to be monitored and adjusted regularly. 
The trial has been completed. Recruitment was first initiated in the adolescent group (12 to <18 years) and 
was consecutively opened to younger age groups (2 to <12 years of age; 0 to <2 years) based on the DMC 
recommendations. It was planned to include a minimum of 141 evaluable patients for the primary efficacy 
endpoint, including a target of 60 patients in the age group from 12 to <18 years of age, 18 patients in the 
age group from 2 to <12 years of age and 10 patients in the age stratum from birth to <2 years of age. The 
minimum number in the lowest age group could be included from either trial 1160.106 or trial 1160.108. 
Randomisation was 2:1 (DE:SoC). At the interim cut-off date, the planned number of patients was already 
exceeded.  
The trial consisted of 3 periods: a screening period, an open-label treatment period, and a follow-up period. 
After consent (and assent, if applicable), the patients entered a screening period while they were completing 
their initial phase of VTE treatment. At the latest after 21 days of initial VTE treatment, patients were 
randomised in a 2:1 ratio to DE or SoC. The intended SoC (LMWH, or VKA, or fondaparinux) was required to 
be specified at randomisation. Once eligibility had been confirmed, patients received either daily DE or SoC 
for 3 months beyond the initial parental therapy.  
Patients requiring discontinuation of DE per CTP were switched to an appropriate SoC therapy and followed 
up until the end of the trial, based on an intent-to-treat principle. Patients requiring VTE therapy beyond 3 
months were switched at Visit 8 (Day 84) to SoC treatment (if randomised to DE) or continued SoC 
treatment (if randomised to SoC). The follow-up period was 4 weeks after last administration of DE (as 
implemented with Global Amendment 5 dated 29 Nov 2016; the initial follow-up period had been 9 months). 
Patients requiring further anticoagulation for secondary VTE prevention due to an unresolved clinical risk 
factor were offered to enrol in the open-label secondary prevention trial 1160.108 and their follow-up visits 
were performed within this separate trial. 
Study Participants 
Trial sites and investigators in Trial 1160.106 
This multinational, multicentre trial was conducted in 63 sites (with screened patients) in 25 countries in 
Asia, Europe, North America, and South America.  
Patient selection 
Trial 1160.106 included male and female patients from birth to <18 years of age (at the time of informed 
consent) with a documented diagnosis of clinically stable VTE (e.g. DVT, PE, central line thrombosis, sinus 
vein thrombosis) based on investigator judgement. The VTE was initially treated (minimum of 5 to 7 days but 
not longer than 21 days) with parenteral anticoagulation therapy, such as unfractionated heparin (UFH) or 
LMWH. Short-term pre-treatment with VKAs was permitted if the INR had not yet reached a therapeutic level 
(i.e. the INR was still <2.0). Patients were eligible if they needed anti-thrombotic treatment for an 
anticipated duration of at least 3 months beyond the initial parental therapy.  
Inclusion criteria 
1)  Male or female patients from birth to <18 years of age at the time of informed consent/assent 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 60/142 
  
  
2)  Documented diagnosis of clinically stable VTE (e.g. DVT, PE, central line thrombosis, sinus vein 
thrombosis) per investigator judgement, initially treated (minimum of 5 to 7 days, but not longer than 21 
days) with parenteral anticoagulation therapy, such as UFH or LMWH. Short-term pre-treatment with 
VKAs was permitted if the INR had not yet reached a therapeutic level (i.e. the INR was still <2.0) 
3)  Anticipated treatment duration with anticoagulants for the VTE episode (under inclusion criterion 2) for at 
least 3 months, inclusive of the initial parenteral therapy 
4)  Written informed consent provided by the patient’s parent or legal representative and assent provided by 
the patient (if applicable) at the time of informed consent signature according to local regulations 
Exclusion criteria 
1)  Conditions associated with an increased risk of bleeding: 
a)  Any prior intracranial haemorrhage, classified as a macrobleed. Any intracranial anatomical 
abnormality or intracranial aneurysm. Active meningitis, encephalitis, or intracranial abscess at 
randomisation. Patients with asymptomatic petechial or microbleeds could be included into the trial 
as per investigator`s judgement. As a general recommendation, an intracranial microbleed was 
considered to be ≤0.5 cm in greatest diameter on gradient recalled echo, or T2*MRI sequences 
(criteria could vary depending on MRI imaging modalities; [R15-2999]). Irrespective of size, any 
cerebral bleed that caused focal neurologic signs or symptoms did not constitute a microbleed. 
Further, any blood visualised on a CT was to be classified as a microbleed 
b)  Intracranial or intraspinal surgeries within 6 months of Visit 2 (randomisation) or any other major 
surgery within 4 weeks of Visit 2. Major surgeries included an invasive operation upon an organ 
within the cranium, chest, abdomen, pelvic cavity, or any other procedure regarded as major surgery 
per investigator judgement. In general, major surgery involved the opening of a mesenchymal barrier 
(pleural cavity, peritoneum, meninges). Removal or insertion of a central venous line was not 
considered a major surgery provided haemostasis was achieved after the procedure 
c)  Any major planned procedure that might have put the patient at an increased risk of a bleed per 
investigator judgement within 5 days prior to taking trial medication 
d)  History of intraocular, spinal, retroperitoneal, or atraumatic intra-articular bleeding, unless the 
causative factor had been permanently treated (e.g. by surgery) 
e)  Gastrointestinal haemorrhage within the past year prior to screening unless the cause had been 
permanently eliminated (e.g. by surgery) 
f)  History of gastroduodenal ulcer disease 
g)  History of haemorrhagic disorder or bleeding diathesis (e.g. von Willebrand disease, haemophilia A or 
B or other hereditary bleeding disorder, history of spontaneous intra-articular bleeding, history of 
prolonged bleeding after surgery/intervention) 
h)  Administration of fibrinolytic agents within 48 hours of DE administration (note that the use of tissue 
plasminogen activators, e.g. alteplase, or any other thrombolytic agents to re-establish patency of an 
obstructed central venous line were allowed as long as the used dose was devoid of relevant systemic 
effects) 
i)  Uncontrolled hypertension on antihypertensive medication (systolic or diastolic blood pressure above 
ULN for age and sustained over 24 hours) 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 61/142 
  
  
j)  Any other disease, health condition or intervention that exposed the patient to a higher risk for 
bleeding in the investigator’s opinion 
2)  Renal dysfunction (eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m2 using the Schwartz formula) or requirement for dialysis. 
Retesting the eGFR during the screening period was allowed (once). The threshold was decreased 
stepwise from <80 mL/min/1.73 m2 with Global Amendment 5 and Global Amendment 9. However, at 
the time of this interim analysis, Global Amendment 9 had been implemented only in a few countries. 
3)  Active infective endocarditis 
4)  Patients with a heart valve prosthesis requiring anticoagulation 
5)  Hepatic disease: 
a)  Active liver disease, including known active hepatitis A, B, or C, or 
b)  Persistent ALT or AST or AP >3x ULN within 3 months of screening. Transient increases of these 
parameters were acceptable, if retesting demonstrated results within these limits 
6)  Pregnant or breast-feeding female patients. Female patients who had reached menarche and were not 
using a medically accepted contraceptive method per local guidelines. Acceptable methods of birth control 
are listed below and must have been used in a correct and consistent manner: 
a)  Oral or parenteral (patch, injection, implant) hormonal contraception which has been used 
continuously for at least 1 month prior to the first dose of trial medication 
b)  Intrauterine device or intrauterine system 
c)  Double-Barrier method of contraception: condom and spermicidal agent 
d)  Complete sexual abstinence. Note: Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal were not acceptable methods of contraception 
7)  Patients in stratum 3 (0 to <2 years) with gestational age at birth <37 weeks or with body weight lower 
than the 3rd percentile (according to the WHO Child growth standards [provided in the ISF]). Note that 
this exclusion criterion was added with Global Amendment 2 
8)  Anaemia (haemoglobin <80 g/L) or thrombocytopenia (platelet count <80x109/L) at screening. 
Transfusions during the screening period were allowed, provided that a satisfactory haemoglobin or 
platelet level was attained prior to Visit 2 (randomisation) Patients who had taken prohibited or restricted 
medication within 1 week of the first dose of trial medication, other than medication for prior VTE 
treatment and P-glycoprotein inhibitors. For trial restrictions, see Section 9.4.2.2 
9)  Patients who had received an investigational drug in the past 30 days prior to screening 
10) Patients who were allergic/sensitive to any component of the trial medication including solvent 
11) Patients or parents/legal representatives considered unreliable to participate in the trial per investigator 
judgement or any condition which would present a safety hazard to the patient based on investigator 
judgement 
12) Patients or parents/legal representatives who are unwilling or unable to undergo or permit the repeat of 
the baseline imaging tests required to confirm thrombus resolution at Day 84/Week 12 (or at eEOT, 
whichever came first) or in whom repeating such imaging tests at these pre-specified time points may 
not have been in the patient’s best medical interest. Examples included unwarranted radiation exposure

as a result of a repeat CT scan for a patient with an isolated case of PE evaluated at baseline solely by a 
CT scan. In such cases, the baseline radiological assessment (e.g. CT) could be supplemented with an 
acceptable non-radiological assessment at baseline (e.g. MRI) which could then be repeated at Day 
84/Week 12 (or eEOT), hence alleviating any potential unwarranted radiation exposure

Note: In addition to these starting dose nomograms, there are Dose Adjustment nomograms for up- and 
down-titration, respectively (not shown): 
Up-titration: In case patients have trough concentrations below 50 ng/mL, the dose may be increased by 15 
to 100% as outlined in the relevant nomograms for capsules, coated granules and LOF, respectively 
Down-titration: Whenever a trough concentration is greater than or equal to 250 ng/mL, the dose may be 
reduced by 40 to 50% as outlined in the relevant nomograms for capsules, coated granules and LOF, 
respectively. 
Dosing of the SoC comparator 
Patients assigned to take SoC were to follow the investigator’s recommendation for adequate dosing and 
administration based on the product’s locally approved label and in consideration of local treatment 
guidelines. The SoC dose was to be monitored regularly as appropriate (e.g. INR for VKAs). 
Rationale for the dose selection for DE 
Dose selection for DE was based on dabigatran’s linear PK with renal function (GFR) being the most important 
determinant of dabigatran PK. Allometric models were considered appropriate in determining doses in 
paediatric patients. To adjust for the on average lower body weight and hence lower absolute GFR in children 
aged <1 year, the dose estimation procedure according to Hayton was used. For renally eliminated drugs like 
dabigatran, this model can be used to estimate dosing regimens based on the adult dose with adjustment to 
the age and weight of the child. In this way, doses and resulting nomograms can be used in clinical practice 
without the need for regular laboratory measurements. The dosing was intended to achieve trough plasma 
dabigatran concentrations between 50 and 250 ng/mL, which have generally been proven to be safe and 
effective in adult populations, mainly RE-COVER and RE-LY, see also rationale below.  
Based on the calculated target DE doses and the available formulation strengths, age- and weight-adjusted 
nomograms were provided for each formulation. Dosing of patients was only to occur according to the 
adjusted nomograms, which were updated with Global Amendments 3, 4, 5, and 8 to reflect the addition of 
the younger age strata and respective formulations to the trial. The dose regimen was also regularly 
reviewed by the DMC, which could have revised it as data on trough dabigatran levels, PD, efficacy, and 
Assessment report

Page 65/142 
  
  
 
safety data from this and other studies became available. No such revision was done until the cut-off date for 
the interim analysis. 
Rationale for the target plasma dabigatran concentration 
A dabigatran trough concentration of ≥50 to <250 ng/mL was defined as target in trial 1160.106 because of 
the additional dose finding/confirmation character of the trial. In the RE-LY trial a relationship between total 
dabigatran exposure and efficacy (i.e. ischemic stroke) has been established; a total dabigatran trough 
concentration above 28 ng/mL (10th percentile) was associated with appropriate efficacy for the prevention 
of stroke. In the RE-COVER trial, the correlation between efficacy and total dabigatran trough concentration 
was weak. Efficacy could be considered as adequate at concentrations above the 10th percentile (26 ng/mL) 
of the trough concentrations observed in RE-COVER. Based on the anticipated similarity of the 
pathophysiology of thrombotic events in the populations of these two trials, a trough concentration ≥50 
ng/mL was expected to provide the most favourable efficacy and was therefore proposed for paediatric 
patients in this trial. In addition, 50 ng/mL had to be chosen as this was the limit of quantification of the dTT 
assay used in the trial initially. Based on a low risk of major bleeding events with rising total dabigatran 
trough concentrations even beyond 250 ng/mL, it was considered that maintaining a trough concentration 
between 50 to <250 ng/mL has a reasonable likelihood to be effective and safe with a positive benefit/risk 
ratio in children of all ages, as seen in adults. This range constituted a rather conservative safeguard in this 
trial, where dosing appropriateness and efficacy and safety were evaluated in parallel as per trial design 
(Phase IIb/III). 
The DMC could recommend further refinement of the target trough steady state dabigatran concentration 
based on data from ongoing paediatric trials or if emerging data from other DE trials in other populations 
suggested that a wider or narrower total dabigatran trough concentration range is associated with better 
benefit/risk ratio. 
Adjustments to reach target plasma dabigatran concentrations 
The dose of DE had to be adjusted during the trial to ensure that a steady state trough plasma concentration 
between ≥50 to <250 ng/mL was achieved (see above). Steady state is reached within first week of dosing, 
after 6 consecutive doses were taken. Patients who had a total steady state trough concentration between 50 
and <250 ng/mL were advised to continue on the same dose until the following visit. If the trough 
concentration was below 50 ng/mL the concentration was greater than or equal to 250 ng/mL, the dose had 
to be reduced by 25 to 50%. During the regulatory procedure, the Applicant has provided additional 
descriptive statistics for steady state plasma concentrations of total dabigatran  at Visit 3 (after at least 6 
consecutive dabigatran doses), post-titration (at least  3 days after a dabigatran dose adjustment), and over 
all visits – PK Set by age  stratum as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 66/142 
  
  
Only valid trough values and uncapped doses from the PK Set are included, thus Ns for individual visits differ 
from the overall N. The 49 patients in the column ‘post-titration’ were those patients who were titrated, and 
the concentrations shown were the concentrations at least 3 days after the dose adjustment. Not all 49 
patients may have a valid PK sample at visit 3 as they may not be within the time window during Visit 3. 
Furthermore, the Applicant has provided a comparison of trough gMean values in 1160.106 over all visits and 
trough  gMean values over all visits normalised to dose before adjustment – PK Set by age stratum and 
formulation as follows: 
It can be seen that the difference in exposure over the full treatment period when a dose titration had taken 
place compared with the expected exposure had it not taken place is <15% difference for all subgroups.

Objectives 
This trial was a prospective, multicentre, international, open-label, randomised, parallel-group, non-inferiority 
trial comparing DE to SoC. It was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of DE relative to SoC for the 
treatment of secondary prevention of VTE in patients from birth to less than 18 years of age and to document 
the appropriateness of the proposed DE dosing algorithm. 
Hypothesis testing 
The non-inferiority hypothesis for the primary endpoint (proportion of patients with complete thrombus 
resolution, with no recurrent VTE and no VTE-related death) was: 
H01: p1C – p1D ≥δ1 vs. H11: p1C – p1D <δ1 for the primary endpoint (δ1 = 20%) * 
* The letter D stands for DE and the letter C for SoC. 
The non-inferiority margin was based on 11 trials with SoC in paediatric patients. A complete thrombus 
resolution rate without treatment cannot be established from recent publications. It is uncommon to see 
patient completely without treatment, and the rate of complete thrombus resolution is believed to be low. In 
the absence of solid evidence of spontaneous thrombus resolution, a precise effect size was difficult to be 
determined. By using a wide range of plausible complete thrombus resolution rates without treatment, it was 
demonstrated that the 20% non-inferiority margin (concerning the rate difference) can preserve at least 62% 
and up to 70% of the effect size under SoC treatment. 
Upon showing significance of non-inferiority for the primary endpoint (using a 90% confidence interval), a 
test of superiority was performed subsequently (with a one-sided significance level of 0.05), in the following 
order: 
H03: p1C – p1D ≥0 vs. H13: p1C – p1D <0 for the primary endpoint 
* The letter D stands for DE and the letter C for SoC. 
Refer to Section 9.7.2 of the interim CTR [c26571231] for further details regarding the non-inferiority 
margin, the significance level for superiority, the sample size, and power calculations. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the combined endpoint of the proportion of patients with: 
•  Complete thrombus resolution 
• 
• 
Freedom  from  recurrent  VTE  (including  symptomatic  and  asymptomatic,  contiguous  progression  or 
non-contiguous new thrombus, DVT, PE and PDE, thrombus progression) 
Freedom from mortality related to VTE 
The  events  outlined  in  the  above  combined  primary  endpoint  were  assessed  by  radiologists  or  other  such 
qualified clinicians using an appropriate method such as ultrasound, echocardiography, venography, or CT scan, 
based on the location of the thrombus and the test used to perform the baseline assessment. 
Secondary endpoints 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 68/142 
  
  
Freedom from major bleeding events (MBEs), defined as either fatal bleeding; clinically overt bleeding 
associated with a decrease in haemoglobin of at least 20 g/L in a 24-hour period; bleeding that was 
retroperitoneal, pulmonary, intracranial, or otherwise involved the central nervous system; or bleeding that 
requires intervention in an operating suite 
PK and PD assessments at Visit 3 (after at least 6 consecutive DE doses) and after at least 3 days following 
any DE dose adjustment 
Frequency of dose adjustments (i.e. number of patients with dose adjustment), temporary and permanent 
discontinuation from therapy, and number of patients with laboratory monitoring requirements for dose 
adjustment during the treatment phase 
Frequency of switch of type of anti-coagulation therapy (including DE to SoC), i.e. frequency of patients 
switching the type of anti-coagulation therapy including DE to SoC and switching from an intended SoC 
treatment to another 
Freedom from thrombus progression at end of therapy (Day 84 after randomisation (Visit 8) or eEOT 
whichever came first), compared with baseline 
Assessment of the acceptability of an age-appropriate formulation at end of therapy 
All bleeding events 
All-cause mortality 
All individual components of the primary efficacy endpoints 
All  components  of  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  as  well  as  all  bleeding  and  all  fatal  events  were  centrally 
adjudicated by an independent blinded committee 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
The randomization was performed in blocks of six and stratified by age groups (age<2, 2≤age<12, 
12≤age<18), with allocation ratio of 2:1 for dabigatran to SOC. The correct assignment to trial medication 
kits was managed via an IRT based on the estimated dose. The randomization list was generated using a 
validated system. 
The trial is an open-labelled trial. Different paediatric formulations of DE and the s.c. administration of some 
of the SoC treatments would have required an unethical number of dummy treatments in a blinded trial, 
especially considering the vulnerability of a paediatric trial population. In addition, the constant international 
normalised ratio (INR) monitoring required for some SoC treatments would also have had to be simulated for 
the DE group in a blinded trial.  
Important efficacy and safety outcomes of the trial were adjudicated in a blinded fashion by an independent 
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). 
Investigators, patients, and trial members will be unblinded. The only party blinded to treatment assignment 
are members of the adjudication committee.

Statistical methods 
Primary analysis 
The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint and its individual components was based on the randomised 
set (RS), which included all randomised patients in the treatment groups to which they were randomised, 
regardless whether they took trial medication. 
As range of sensitivity analyses were based on either the RS or the treated set (TS), please refer to the table 
below. The treated set (TS) included all patients who were dispensed trial medication and were documented 
to have taken at least 1 dose of trial medication. 
The following treatment periods were defined for the evaluation of efficacy: 
−  On-treatment period: time of first administration of trial medication to 6 days after last 
administration of trial medication (6 days was the defined residual effect period [REP]) 
− 
− 
Intention-to-treat period: day of randomisation to Day 84 (+ 7 day visit window), including all 
observed time on and off trial medication 
Full follow-up period (i.e. complete observation period): day of randomisation to day of the last 
follow-up visit, lost to follow-up, death, or consent withdrawn 
The primary efficacy endpoint contained 3 components. Each component was evaluated separately, and only 
if the criteria for all 3 components were satisfied, the primary endpoint was considered achieved. 
Component 1: free from VTE-related mortality 
Patients with VTE-related death occurring between randomization to Day 84 + 7 days will be considered as 
NOT meeting the endpoint in terms of the component of “freedom from mortality related to VTE”, and 
therefore will not contribute to the proportion of patients achieving the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Component 2: free from recurrent VTE 
For patients with recurrent VTE(s) from randomization to Day 84 + 7 days, the component of “free from 
recurrent VTE” will be considered as NOT satisfied. 
For patients WITHOUT ANY recurrent VTE records: 
• 
• 
• 
If the entire treatment period is completed (Day 84 visit available), the component of “free from 
recurrent VTE” will be considered as satisfied. 
Patients who die (not VTE-related) or withdraw consent prior to Day 84 - 7 days without record of 
recurrent VTE will be considered as “free from recurrent VTE”. 
For patients who discontinue treatment prematurely (before Day 84 + 7) this component will be 
considered as missing. In the primary analysis, we use LOCF, so no record of recurrent VTE will be 
considered as “free from recurrent VTE”. 
Component 3: complete thrombus resolution 
Assessment of index VTE status (best overall response) was scheduled on Day 84 ± 7 days (Visit 8) for 
patients who were alive without consent withdrawn, regardless of the treatment status (completion or 
premature discontinuation) at that time. 
• 
The thrombus status assessed at Day 84 ± 7 days will be used for evaluation of this component. If 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 70/142 
  
  
 
 
more than one thrombus assessment is available within this time window, the one closest to and 
before Day 84+7 will be adopted. 
For patients completing the treatment period OR patients terminating treatment early, if the index 
thrombus assessment during Day 84 ± 7 days is missing, but an early VTE assessment was 
performed, for instance, at an unscheduled visit or an eEOT visit, the latest available thrombus 
status will be carried forward (LOCF) in the primary analysis. 
If not any index VTE assessment was performed until Day 84 + 7 days, these patients will be 
considered as having missing data and NOT meeting the criterion of “complete thrombus resolution” 
Patients with index VTE assessment performed only once after Day 84 + 7 days will be considered to 
have missing data and to not achieve the complete thrombus resolution in the primary analysis 
• 
• 
• 
Patients who are still being treated and have not yet reached Day 84 ± 7 days at time of EMA interim data 
cut-off will not be included in the analysis. 
The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint used the randomised set, following the intention-to-
treat principle. Age group was used as stratification factor using a Mantel-Haenszel type weighted average of 
differences with weights as proposed by Greenland and Robins [R09-1299]. The analyses only included 
adjudicated events. 
Sensitivity analyses 
An analysis of the adjudicated primary endpoint was also performed on the RS with a logistic regression 
model using the fixed effect terms: treatment, age group, and the interaction of treatment by age group. 
Profile likelihood estimates were used to calculate the confidence intervals. The significance of the interaction 
term was assessed by this model. A Hosmer-Lemeshow test was performed to check the appropriateness of 
the analysis model. 
The following sensitivity analyses were performed for the primary endpoint:

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 328 patients were screened/enrolled, at 65 sites in 26 countries. The largest proportions of treated 
patients overall and across age groups were from Central Europe (56.4%), followed by North America 
(21.1%) and Western Europe (18.0%). At country level, Russia contributed the most patients (28.2%); the 
next largest contributions came from the Czech Republic (17.3%), and United States (11.3%).

Number of treated patients by region and country – Treated Set (TS) 
Of the 328 screened patients, 267 patients were randomised. The main reasons why screened patients were 
not randomised were not meeting the in-/exclusion criteria (44 patients) and other reasons (11 patients). All 
randomised patients were treated, apart from 1 patient in the oldest age group, who had been randomised to 
DE. This patient withdrew consent after randomisation. At the end of the trial, 253 patients (95.1%) had 
completed the planned observation time (defined as attendance of the Follow-up Visit 9 or roll over into trial 
1160.108 after Visit 8 [Week 12]). Thirteen patients (4.9%) had prematurely discontinued from the trial, 
with the most frequent reasons being ‘other’ (1.9%). The proportion of patients who prematurely 
discontinued was similar in both treatment groups (DE: 4.5%, SoC: 5.6%); see Table 4.

Fifty-one patients (19.2%) in total prematurely (and permanently) discontinued trial medication, with the 
most frequent reasons being ‘other’ (10.5%) and AEs (other than recurrence of VTE or worsening of other 
pre-existing diseases; 5.6%) (Table 5). The most common ‘other’ reason for discontinuation was ‘failure to 
obtain target dabigatran concentration’, as the CTP only allowed 1 dose adjustment (after Global 
Amendment 2). In addition, other reasons included thrombus resolution, investigator judgement, and 
parents’ unwillingness to continue. The proportion of patients who prematurely discontinued trial medication 
was higher in the DE group (23.3%) than in the SoC group (11.1%), which was mainly driven by the high 
number of ‘other’ discontinuations connected with not reaching the target dabigatran concentration as 
described above. In addition, patients who switched from DE to SoC were regarded as permanently 
discontinued, while patients in the SoC group who switched the SoC type were still regarded as on-treatment 
for SoC.

Further details on discontinuations by age-group in the DE treated patient group is provided in the following 
table: 
The proportions who were prematurely discontinued from trial DE medication were 53.3%, 41.9% and 33.5% 
in the age-groups Birth to <2 years, 2 to <12 years and 12 to <18 years, respectively. 
Patients from trial 1160.106 who had completed the treatment period in trial 1160.106 and required further 
anticoagulation for secondary prevention of VTE due to presence of a clinical risk factor could roll over into 
trial 1160.108. 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 75/142 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, 91 patients (34.1% of the randomised patients in trial 1160.106) rolled over into trial 1160.108. In 
addition, 122 patients were newly recruited and treated in trial 1160.108 (Table 6 and Figure 2). In total, 388 
distinct patients were treated in both trials 1160.106 and 1160.108 (birth to <2 years: 43 patients; 2 to 
<12 years: 91 patients; 12 to <18 years: 254 patients). 
Datasets analysed 
The enrolled set comprised 328 patients. The RS included 267 patients (DE: 177 patients; SoC: 90 patients) 
and the TS comprised 266 patients (DE: 176 patients; SoC: 90 patients). 
No per protocol set was defined for this trial. However, important protocol deviations (IPDs) were 
documented. The only IPD that could have led to exclusion from all analysis sets was ‘informed consent not 
available’, which did not occur in this trial.  
Baseline data 
Baseline refers to the last available measurement taken prior to first administration of DE or SoC in the trial. 
Demographic characteristics 
Overall, demographic characteristics were balanced between the 2 treatment groups (Table 7). About half of 
the randomised patients (49.8%) were male. The majority of patients were White (91.8%). Most of the 
patients were treated in trial centres in Central Europe (56.6%), North America (21.0%), and Western 
Europe (18.0%). The mean age at screening was 11.1 years (SD 6.1 years); see Table 7. 
There were no relevant differences between age groups regarding sex, race, ethnicity, and region. Overall, 
168 patients were 12 to <18 years old (mean age: 15.3 years [SD 1.6 years]), 64 patients 2 to <12 years 
old (mean age: 5.9 years [SD 3.1 years]), and 35 patients were younger than 2 years (mean age: 8.1 
months [SD 6.7 months]). Of those, 21 patients were 6 months to <2 years old and 14 patients were <6 
months old. Note that age information in the statistical analysis is not based on exact birth dates. Age at 
screening was stored in the database either in months or in years. Thus, a more precise age than ‘0 months’ 
is not available for the youngest patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 76/142 
  
  
 
 
The mean/median BMI was in the normal range across age groups. The BMI ranged from 11.0 to 43.7 kg/m2 
in 12 to <18 years old patients, from 10.7 to 23.3 kg/m2 in 2 to <12 years old patients, and from 12.1 to 
19.9 kg/m2 in the youngest age group. 
The eGFR was calculated using the Schwartz formula for children (see [c29773859, Section 9.5.3.3]). The 
overall mean eGFR was 116 mL/min/1.73 m2 (SD 33 mL/min/1.73 m2). and ranged from 67 to 238 
mL/min/1.73 m2 in 12 to <18 years old patients, from 89 to 219 mL/min/1.73 m2 in 2 to <12 years old 
patients, and from 52 to 215 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the youngest age group. Note: At the beginning of the trial, 
patients with an eGFR <80 mL/min/1.73 m2 were not eligible. During the trial, the eGFR threshold for 
exclusion from the trial was reduced to <60 mL/min/1.73m2 for patients aged 12 to <18 years but remained 
unchanged for patients aged 0 to <12 years.

Characterisation of leading index VTE 
In both treatment groups, most patients (63.7%) had DVT as leading index VTE (Table 8). More patients in 
the DE group (11.3%) than in the SoC group (4.4%) had PE as leading index VTE. The main imaging method 
used to confirm the VTE assessment was compression ultrasound (72.3%). The mean time from first 
diagnosis of the index VTE until randomisation was similar in both treatment groups (overall 16.2 days, SD: 
6.3 days).  
Further details on location and symptomatology of DVT and PE are provided in the source data for the above 
table: 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 78/142 
  
  
 
 
Please note that “DVT” in the above table includes deep vein thrombosis, central line thrombosis, and cerebral 
venous thrombosis and/or sinus thrombosis. It is noted that 50.6% of total are symptomatic, 22.1% of total 
are asymptomatic and 18.4% are missing symptomatology. 
Further details on the most recent VTE in the DE treated patients across study 1160.106 and 1160.108 by age-
group is provided in the following table: 
It is noted that the proportions with Central Line Thrombosis (CLT) are 40.0%, 20.3% and 2.2% in the age-
groups Birth to <2 years,  2 to <12 years and 12 to <18 years, respectively. The proportions with Cerebral 
Venous Thrombosis and/or Sinus Thrombosis (CVST) are 20.0%, 27.0% and 5.4% in the age-groups Birth to 
<2 years, 2 to <12 years and 12 to <18 years, respectively. 
Previous thromboembolic events 
Overall, 28 patients (10.5%) had a history of VTEs other than the index VTE. For most of the patients 
(5.6%), the previous VTE was a DVT and the majority of patients had not more than 1 previous VTE (9.4%); 
see Table 9.

Medical history 
Medical history was fairly balanced across both treatment groups, with the exception of cancer, which was 
mainly reported for patients in the DE group, and heart failure and congenital heart disease, which was 
mainly reported for the SoC group. About a third of the patients (30.5%) tested positive for at least 1 
inherited coagulation disorder, most of them Factor V Leiden (9.8%). Other relevant medical history included 
congenital heart disease (18.0%), heart failure (8.3%), and history of cancer (7.1%); see Table 10.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
Primary analysis 
Of the 267 randomised patients, 81 patients (45.8%) in the DE group and 38 patients (42.2%) in the SoC 
group met the criteria for the composite primary endpoint (complete thrombus resolution, freedom from 
recurrent VTE, and freedom from mortality-related VTE). The corresponding rate difference and 90% CI was 
−0.038 (−0.141, 0.066) and thus demonstrated non-inferiority of DE to SoC, since the upper bound of the 
90% CI was lower than the predefined non-inferiority margin of 20%. Superiority of DE over SoC could not 
be demonstrated, as the upper bound of the 90% CI was above 0; see Table 13. 
Secondary endpoints 
Freedom from major bleeding events 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 82/142 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Primary analysis 
An  adjudication-confirmed  major  bleed  was  reported  for  4  patients  (2.3%)  in  the  DE  group  and  2  patients 
(2.2%) in the SoC group. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk for major bleeding between 
treatment with DE and SoC (Table 14). 
The results of the sensitivity analysis, using the intention-to-treat period instead of the on-treatment period, 
confirmed the results of the primary analysis. A total of 5 patients (2.8%) with events in the DE arm and 2 
patients (2.2%) with events in the SoC arm were included, resulting in a rate difference (90% CI) of 0.006 
(−0.027, 0.039).  
All-cause mortality 
One  patient  (treatment  group:  SoC;  age:  15  years)  had  died  on-treatment  because  of  an  adjudication-
confirmed major bleed. None of the patients in the DE arm died during the on-treatment period.  
All individual components of the primary efficacy endpoints 
In  line  with  the  primary  endpoint,  individual  components  of  the  primary  endpoint  occurred  in  comparable 
frequencies across treatment groups (see Table 15) except for recurrent VTE, which was less frequent with DE 
(4.0%) than with SoC (7.8%). The most common recurrent VTE was DVT.  
Freedom from thrombus progression at end of therapy 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 83/142 
  
  
 
 
 
Eleven patients were reported with thrombus progression during the intention-to-treat period (DE: 6 patients, 
3.4%; SoC: 5 patients, 5.6%). In total 13.1% of patients were missing a VTE assessment at the end of the 
trial, therefore the proportion of patients confirmed free from thrombus progression at the end of the intention 
to treat period was 83.6% in the DE arm and 81.1% in the SoC arm.  
Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint 
The results of the sensitivity analyses were consistent with the result of the primary endpoint. Independent of 
the  data  source  (adjudicated  vs.  investigator-reported),  analysis  period  (on-treatment  vs.  intention-to-treat 
vs. full follow-up), and missing data imputation (LOCF vs. worst case), the upper bounds of the 90% CIs were 
consistently lower than the predefined non-inferiority margin of 20% (Figure 3). The same was true for the 
95% CIs, demonstrating non-inferiority of DE to SoC at 1-sided alpha of 0.025 (Figure 3 and 3A). 
Note: LOCF in this context means that missing VTE recurrence was considered as being free from recurrent 
VTE,  and  the  last  thrombus  assessment  was  carried  forward  for  the  component  of  complete  thrombus 
resolution. Worst case means that a missing VTE recurrence was imputed as being not free from recurrent VTE 
for  early  discontinued  patients,  and  missing  thrombus  assessment  at  Visit  8  was  imputed  as  not  achieving 
complete thrombus resolution. 
Figure 3 Summary of primary endpoint sensitivity analyses RS/TS 
When analysing the primary endpoint with a logistic regression by age group, the results showed that there 
was  no  treatment  by  age  group  interaction  [c29773859,  Table  15.2.1.2:  1],  see  also  subgroup  analyses  in 
Section 2.2.2. 
Additional sensitivity analyses with 95% CI were reported with the final study results:

Subgroup analyses 
Consistent results were generally observed across subgroups. (Figure 4) Some small subgroups showed very 
wide confidence intervals, but there were no significant differences in the treatment effect for the subgroups 
by age, sex, region, and presence of certain risk factors (central venous line, congenital heart disease, 
malignant disease). 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 85/142 
  
  
 
 
Additional subgroup analyses with 95% CI were reported with the final study results: 
An analysis by type of control treatment (LMWH, VKA, or fondaparinux) showed differing results by treatment 
(see Figure 5); however, results have to be interpreted with caution, as the choice of control treatment was 
not randomised and the number of patients in the groups was unbalanced (i.e. 1 patient on fondaparinux vs. 
177 patients on DE).

The number of patients with DE dose adjustments during the on-treatment period was analysed. Since only 
one dose adjustment was allowed, this is equivalent to the number of DE dose adjustments. Overall, the DE 
dose was adjusted in 118 patients (36.0%) during the on-treatment period. In the majority of these patients, 
the DE dose was increased. DE dose adjustments were more frequent in the younger age groups than in the 
oldest age group (Table 16). There was no difference regarding treatment duration (i.e. ≥12 weeks vs. total.).

Appropriateness of dosing algorithm  
The dosing algorithm for trials 1160.106 and 1160.108 was developed based on RE COVER [U09-1400], which 
was a Phase III trial with DE in adults diagnosed with acute VTE. In RE-COVER, dosing was fixed (150 mg bid) 
and efficacy was demonstrated without titration or considering dabigatran plasma concentrations. Efficacy was 
assumed  to  be  adequate  at  dabigatran  concentrations  above  the  10th  percentile  (26  ng/mL)  of  the  trough 
concentrations observed in RE COVER. Since the RE COVER trial showed a favourable treatment effect of DE in 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021

adults, the predefined trough concentration had a reasonable likelihood to be effective and safe with a positive 
benefit/risk ratio in children of all ages. 
For  this  submission,  data  from  all  available  paediatric  trials  (1160.88,  1160.89,  1160.105,  1160.106,  and 
1160.108) were used to refine the dosing algorithm for paediatric patients. Refer to Module 2.7.2 for details. 
Acceptability of an age-appropriate formulation 
Studies of acceptability of DE new formulations have been done in all trials. 
In  trials  1160.106  and  1160.108,  questionnaires  were  available  for  the  investigator/site  staff,  patients, and 
parents/caretakers.  Responses  were  provided  based  on  tick  boxes  in  the  questionnaire.  Trials  1160.88, 
1160.89, and 1160.105 had an investigator assessment only. 
Granules and capsules 
In trial 1160.106, the administration of capsules and granules was generally assessed as good or acceptable 
by  investigators,  parents,  and  patients.  In  trial  1160.108,  the  capsules  were  generally  well  accepted  by 
investigators, parents, and patients. From Visit 4 to 11, the percentage of patients stating that they could not 
take the capsules for a longer time was not greater than 5%. Granules were generally assessed as good or 
acceptable by investigators, parents, and patients. In trial 1160.88, all 9 treated patients had good tolerability 
of the capsules, as per investigator assessment. 
Oral solution 
The acceptability of the oral solution was assessed in trials 1160.89 (Phase IIa, single dose or 3 day bid dosing), 
1160.105  (Phase  IIa  with  single  dose),  and  1160.106  (Phase  IIb/III,  treatment  up  to  3  months).  The  oral 
solution was either available with or without peach flavour.

Acceptability of the oral solution (flavoured or unflavoured) in 1160.106 for patients <12 months 
of age 
A total of 14 patients were treated with oral solution in trial 1160.106. Of these, 13 patients provided data on 
tolerability: 8 for the flavoured and 5 for the unflavoured oral solution. One of the 8 patients receiving 
flavoured oral solution switched to granules.  
Overall, the investigators assessed the patient’s acceptability of the oral solution mostly as good or 
satisfactory across visits. To map the different questionnaires across CRF versions for a combined analysis, 
scores were assigned to the acceptability questions. Thus, a lower score number indicates better 
acceptability. The mean score at the end of treatment for the overall acceptability question was 1.2 (SD 0.4) 
for the unflavoured and 1.6 (SD 0.8) for the flavoured oral solution. For the unflavoured oral solution, 2 of 5 
patients had difficulties to swallow the oral solution because of its taste and thus did not always take the oral 
solution: 1 patient reported the difficulties only at the first assessment (Day 3) and 1 patient had the 
difficulties for all 3 assessments. The other 3 patients on unflavoured oral solution did not have difficulties to 
swallow because of the taste. For the flavoured oral solution, 1 of 8 patients reported difficulties to swallow 
because of the taste at the first assessment. Other reasons for missed intake were having forgotten to take 
the medication or surgery. The intake was possible all the time (for the majority of patients) or very often (a 
few instances).  
Study 1160.108 
An open label, single arm safety prospective cohort, multi-centre, phase III study (1160.108) was conducted 
to assess the safety of dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients from 
birth to less than 18 years. Patients who required further anticoagulation due to the presence of a clinical risk 
factor after completing the initial treatment for confirmed VTE (for at least 3 months) or after completing the 
DIVERSITY study were allowed to be included in the study. Eligible patients received age and weight adjusted 
doses of an age-appropriate formulation (capsules, coated granules or oral solution) of dabigatran etexilate 
until the clinical risk factor resolved, or up to a maximum of 12 months. The primary endpoints of the study 
included the recurrence of VTE, major and minor bleeding events and the mortality (overall and related to

thrombotic or thromboembolic events) at 6 and 12 months. Outcome events were adjudicated by an 
independent blinded adjudication committee. 
Overall, 214 patients entered the study; among them 162 patients in age stratum 1 (from 12 to less 
than 18 years of age), 43 patients in age stratum 2 (from 2 to less than 12 years of age) and 9 patients in 
age stratum 3 (from birth to less than 2 years of age). During the on-treatment period, 3 patients (1.4%) 
had an adjudication-confirmed recurrent VTE within the first 12 months after treatment start. Adjudication-
confirmed bleeding events during the on-treatment period were reported for 48 patients (22.5%) within the 
first 12 months. The majority of the bleeding events were minor. In 3 patients (1.4%), an adjudication-
confirmed major bleeding event occurred within the first 12 months. For 3 patients (1.4%), adjudication-
confirmed CRNM bleeding was reported within the first 12 months. No on-treatment deaths occurred. During 
the on-treatment period, 3 patients (1.4%) developed post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) or had worsening of 
PTS within the first 12 months. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy of DE in the paediatric population was investigated in a single randomised controlled phase 
IIB/III trial, i.e. trial 1160.106. This trial had 2 primary objectives. The one primary objective was to 
estimate the effect of 3 months intervention comprising oral DE treatment following 5-21 days initial 
parenteral treatment versus Standard of Care (SoC) on survival with recurrence-free complete thrombus 
resolution in paediatric patients 0- <18 years with VTE. The other primary objective was to document the 
appropriateness of the proposed DE dosing algorithm. 
Six other trials in this line extension application dossier were single-arm bioavailability, PK, PD, safety and 
tolerability trials, i.e. the phase I trials 1160.87 and 1160.194; the phase IIa trials 1160.88; 1160.89, and 
1160.105; and the phase 2B/III 12-months safety trial 1160.108. Data from these trials are discussed in 
details in the sections on Clinical Pharmacology and Clinical Safety, respectively. 
Based on the interim analysis, the Applicant was requested to confirm that patients disposition between DE 
and Soc arms are statically similar, especially regarding the youngest age category of infant aged less than 2 
years of age. Based on the final CTR, randomization between both arms and different age strata are 
equivalent and there is no difference between treated number of children according to the distribution 2 DE / 
1 SOC. This is true also for the youngest category [Stratum 3 from birth to < 2 years (DE: 22 patients, SOC: 
13 patients)].  
In the PIP for the interim analysis for the youngest age-group with the fewest number of patients enrolled, it 
is was accepted to pool the numbers from trial 1160.106 and 1160.108 to meet the requirement. The patient 
populations in the two trials are similar and the pooling is acceptable for the analysis of safety, PK and PD 
endpoints in this group, while only the patients in trial 1160.106 may contribute to the efficacy endpoints. It 
is noted that the primary efficacy analyses were done on the total patient population in trial 1160.106 as the 
trial was not powered for analysing each age-group separately. 
However, according  to the CHMP Paediatric Addendum on the guidelines on clinical investigation of medicinal 
products for the treatment and prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease (Draft - 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 95/142 
  
  
 
EMA/CHMP/763438/2017), since “similarities between younger children and adults in clinical factors for VTE, 
course and response to VTE treatment are not entirely straightforward, an extrapolation of efficacy and safety 
data from adults only based on similar exposure and PD data is not supported, and some extent of efficacy 
and safety data in children are needed”. For the patient selection for clinical studies “an adequate 
representation of paediatric patients of different age ranges is necessary” (…). “In particular, it is of 
importance to study paediatric patients < 2 yrs. due to differences in underlying aetiologies and thrombus 
location, as well as a not fully matured coagulation/fibrinolysis system.”  
The final analysis has provided updated numbers of patients within the youngest age-group Birth to <2 
years, including the numbers of patients <1 year and <6 months, respectively. There were 30 patients in 
this age-group receiving DE in study 1160.106, of whom roughly half discontinued from trial medication 
prematurely. According to the final pooled analysis of all patients exposed to DE in the paediatric program, 
i.e. studies 1160.88, 1160.89, 1160.105, 1160.106 and 1160.108, there was a total of 27 patients <1 year 
of age exposed to DE in these studies. Of those, 8 patients were exposed to a single dose of DE in the Phase 
IIa single-dose study 1160.105. A total of 19 patients <1 year of age was exposed to multiple doses of DE in 
the two Phase II/III studies 1160.106 and 1160.108 combined. There seems to be 11 patients < 6 months of 
age treated with DE in study 1160.106. 
However, there continue to be limitations of patient numbers and treatment exposures in the Birth to <2 
years age-group considering the differences in terms of immaturity of coagulation system and renal function 
and leading index VTE types compared to the older age-groups and adults.  
Therefore, a SAG meeting was convened to discuss the adequacy of relying on efficacy and safety data 
from adults in the youngest children, to discuss the safety profile in this age-group considering the limitations 
of patient numbers and treatment exposures, and to discuss whether particular precautions should be applied 
in the youngest children if dabigatran is approved in all age-groups.  
Additional expert consultation 
Upon request from the CHMP, this SAG CVS meeting was convened on 07 September 2020. 
FINAL PRADAXA SAG CVS ANSWERS 
1.  The MAH is proposing an indication including children of all ages. However, the experience 
of using dabigatran in children younger than 2 years is limited and safety in this age group 
is currently questioned. 
a.  Please discuss the adequacy of relying on efficacy and safety data from adults in 
the youngest children in light of the known age-related development of 
haemostasis. 
b.  Please discuss the acceptability of the safety profile in this age-group considering 
the limitations of patient numbers and treatment exposures: While the overall 
frequencies of major and CRNM bleedings were low to moderate, there was an 
imbalance with on-treatment bleeding events occurring in 6/22 (27.3%) children 
aged 0 to < 2 years in the dabigatran group, and 0 (N=13) in the SoC group. This is 
of concern considering the apparently low exposure as reflected in the high rates 
for dose adjustment and discontinuations, and the mean DE trough values towards 
the lower limits of the recommended range.  
c.  Should particular precautions be applied in the youngest children if dabigatran is 
approved in all age groups?

The experts acknowledged that evidence of safety and efficacy with regards to Standard of Care (SoC) comes 
mainly from studies in adults and data generated from RCT in children is lacking. However, there is a 
relatively large amount of long-term experience with the use of SoC in the treatment and prevention of 
venous thromboembolism (VTE) in children.  
The experts did not consider that relying solely on efficacy and safety data from adults would be appropriate 
to draw conclusions regarding the use of dabigatran in children below 2 years old. The experts found the 
efficacy and safety results in studies in children of all ages reassuring. Overall similar PK data have been 
observed in children as measured in the adult studies (i.e. values within Cmax, AUC, Cthrough adult ranges). 
The scarcity of data in the youngest age category was noted (a total of 30 patients below 2 years old in both 
trials 106 and 108) but the existence of some evidence in this group was welcomed given the known 
difficulties in recruiting children into the clinical trials with anticoagulants.  
Most experts agreed that the safety profile of dabigatran in the treatment and prevention of VTE in children is 
acceptable also in children below 2 years old. Most of the observed bleedings were only minor and bleedings 
are also a known complication of the anticoagulant treatment in general. The experts found it reassuring that 
there was only one major bleeding event recorded in both studies in the dabigatran group (ICH in a subject 
with meningitis with full recovery). A possibility of underreporting of minor bleedings for SoC in the open trial 
was suggested based on historical experience.  
The group did not recommend specific precautions for the youngest children. One expert suggested the need 
for monitoring of plasma concentrations in some very specific paediatric groups to establish anti-coagulation 
ranges in e.g. small bowel disease. 
One expert was of opinion that treatment with dabigatran of children below 2 years old is not acceptable 
considering the limited number of patients studied, and the relatively high number of bleedings observed in 
dabigatran group compared to SoC (even if only minor) without additional benefit in efficacy. The expert 
believed this to be of concern given the observed dabigatran exposure was on the lower limits of the 
recommended range and suggested a further clinical study in the youngest group of children to address these 
concerns.  
Some concerns were expressed regarding the proposed 20% increase in the final dosing algorithm for the 
new pellet formulation due to low exposure of dabigatran observed in clinical studies as reflected in the high 
rates of per protocol dose adjustments, discontinuations and the mean dabigatran etexilate trough values 
tending towards the lower limits of the recommended range. The concern was that the proposal is based on 
modelling and has not been tested in clinical trials.  
Furthermore, the group emphasized the need for post-authorisation data collection to better characterise the 
safety profile of dabigatran as the only way of further characterising the use of dabigatran etexilate in the 
very young children.   
2.  The proposed paediatric target population includes some types of VTE for which evidence 
of efficacy and safety in adults is not available, and thus the evidence relies more heavily 
on the observed pediatric data from the phase IIb/III studies alone. This is of particular 
concern for cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis (CVST) and central line thrombosis (CLT).  
a.  Concerning CVST, considering that this is a condition which is generally known to 
be associated with intracerebral haemorrhage, please discuss if there are 
subpopulations (age, disease states, underlying disease conditions) or instances of 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 97/142 
  
  
 
 
 
 
CVST where the risk of bleeding may be too high? In the study 1160.106 there was 
one case with ICH in the context of meningitis. This led to an amendment to 
implement an exclusion criterion of active ongoing meningitis, encephalitis and 
intracranial abscess in the study. 
b.  Is the proposed treatment duration adequate? (at least 3 months in the study 
1160.106, possibility for extension in 1160.108). Is there a need for particular 
precautions/monitoring? Based on what is known about paediatric CVST, please 
discuss the adequacy of extrapolating data on efficacy and safety of treatment with 
pradaxa in older children with CVST to children < 2 years of age, for whom there is 
very little data in the phase III study  
c.   As reflected in the literature the overall benefits of anticoagulation are generally less clear for 
CLT than for other pediatric VTE-subtypes. Considering this please, discuss the relevance of the 
duration of VTE anticoagulation stated in the current Pradaxa SmPC “short duration at least 3 
months”. Are there particular subpopulations or instances of CLT where the risk of bleeding is 
considered too high? Please discuss the relevance of data on efficacy and safety in subjects with 
chronic or sub-acute CLT for the proposed target indication. 
The experts admitted that both CVST and CLT are observed mainly in children. The fact that there are only 
limited data available supporting efficacy and safety of dabigatran by type of VTE subgroup was noted. 
However, it was felt that the available evidence doesn’t give rise to any particular concern and therefore the 
group recommended dabigatran to be available also for treatment of children in these two conditions.  
Moreover, it was noted that the guidelines support the need for anticoagulant treatment in CVST despite the 
known risk of bleeding, especially intracranial bleeding. In fact, CVST with intracranial bleeding is an 
indication for anticoagulants, since the bleeding usually diminishes if the thrombus resolves. In the paediatric 
studies with dabigatran in CVST the rate of bleeding events was as expected and comparable to the SoC arm 
(5 bleeds in 20 patients with dabigatran [with 1 ICH and 4 minor] vs 4 bleeds in 6 patients with SoC [with 1 
ICH and 3 minor]). In line with the exclusion of patients with meningitis, encephalitis and intracranial abscess 
in the clinical study the experts suggested a contraindication regarding these conditions. It was challenging to 
provide any precise recommendation in case these inflammatory conditions develop during treatment with 
dabigatran and treatment should be considered on case-by -case basis.  
The potential benefits of anticoagulant therapy may be less clear for CLT than for other types of VTE due to 
additional contributing factors, namely lack of timely recognition of symptoms, the different degrees of 
occlusion and different local or systemic prothrombotic states. It was noted that anticoagulation treatment is 
not effective in the resolution of an already formed thrombus but the expert highlighted the importance of 
preserving catheters in these very sick children and hence the need for treating the thrombosis. Thrombus 
resolution rates in CLT group were similar in dabigatran and SoC groups (74% in DE vs 75% in SoC). 
Regarding the duration of treatment in CVST and CLT types the experts indicated that this depends on the 
presence of underlying risk factors and should follow the clinical practice guidelines: for CVST up to 3 months 
or longer, if the index thrombotic risk factor remains even in the presence of bleeding. For CLT treatment 
duration is not clearly specified. There is one study ongoing comparing VTE regimens of different duration (6 
weeks vs 3 months; The Kids-DOTT trial [NCT00687882]) with results available in 2021 that should further 
inform the guidelines). 
It is agreed that very young children have physiologically lower circulating antithrombin levels and lower 
coagulation factor levels. As discussed at the SAG meeting, the experts did not consider that relying solely on 
efficacy and safety data from adults would be appropriate to draw conclusions regarding the use of 
dabigatran in children below 2 years old. With respect to the PK/PD relationship in the youngest children, 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 98/142 
  
  
 
 
 
both aPPT and ECT showed higher values, but the differences could be explained by higher baseline values, 
whereas the PK/PD relationship was similar between the young children and the healthy adults when 
assessing the relative change of aPTT, ECT, and dTT from baseline. Please refer to the pharmacology section 
of this report for details. The experts found that overall similar PK data have been observed in children as 
measured in the adult studies (i.e. values within Cmax, AUC, Cthrough adult ranges). The scarcity of data in 
the youngest age category was noted (see numbers above), but the existence of some evidence in this group 
was welcomed given the known difficulties in recruiting children into the clinical trials with anticoagulants.  
A comparison of DE and SoC treatment groups in trial 1160.106 showed discontinuation rates for other AEs 
of 13.6% and 0% for DE and SoC, respectively. Discontinuation for protocol non- compliance occurred in 
4.5% of patients on DE and 0% of patients on SoC. Thus, while discontinuation for tolerability was 
infrequent, it was more frequent for DE than SoC. However, the discontinuations caused by AEs in the DE 
group do not reveal any specific pattern. It is acknowledged that it should be considered that patients  who 
switched from DE to SoC were regarded as permanently discontinued, while patients in  the SoC group who 
switched the SoC type were still regarded as on treatment for SoC. 
To justify that routine laboratory monitoring of dabigatran therapy should not be routine practice, the MAH 
argued based on the generally predictable PK/PD profile of dabigatran that the age- and weight adjusted 
dosing regimen in children resulted in expected dabigatran concentrations that do not require careful 
laboratory monitoring in routine clinical setting. After modelled revision of the dosing algorithm, which 
involves increase of the coated granules dosing by 20%, it is expected that more patients will reach the 
target therapeutic range. 
Furthermore, to elaborate on the impact of dose adjustments, the Applicant has provided data on 
comparison between the achieved trough geometric Mean (gMean) over all visits following no more  than 1 
dose titration, and the trough gMean overall visits normalised to the nomogram-based  target dose, as well 
as following any dose titrations (please see section on Adjustments to reach target plasma dabigatran 
concentrations above). The Applicant’s interpretation of the gMean plasma concentration before versus after 
the titration is that the effect of dose adjustment was minimal, i.e. increase from 79.8 ng/mL to 81.7 ng/mL. 
However, this may only be true for the overall gMean. In the age-groups Birth to <2 years, Birth to <6 
months, 6 months to >2 years and 2 to >12 years the effect of dose adjustment is more pronounced. It is 
only in the oldest age group 12 to 18 years there is minimal effect of dose adjustment. Since that group is 
the largest, i.e. 88/139 (63.3%) it adds most weight to the overall gMean. It is acknowledged that the 
revised dosing algorithm, derived from simulation of the phase II/III study results, prescribes higher doses of 
coated granules. These are intended as age-appropriate dosage form in the younger age-groups 1 – <8 years 
of age. This largely correspond to the age-groups with pronounced effect of dose adjustment in the study. It 
is expected that more patients in these age-groups will reach the target therapeutic range without need for 
dose adjustment. The observed pronounced effect of dose adjustment in the younger age-groups seen in the 
study may then become less relevant. The bleeding safety aspect of the increased dose of coated granules in 
the modelled revision of the dosing algorithm will be addressed with a requested post-authorisation safety 
surveillance (PASS) study, see below.  
As discussed at the SAG meeting, the group of experts did not recommend specific precautions such as 
routine plasma concentration monitoring for the youngest children. However, one expert suggested the need 
for plasma concentration monitoring in some very specific paediatric groups to establish anti-coagulation 
ranges in e.g. small bowel disease. The Applicant argued that clinical characteristics of the patient have been 
proven to be most reliable to support dosing decisions by HCPs and proposed to add a statement in section 
4.4 of the SmPC to that effect instead of plasma concentration monitoring in these patients. It was agreed 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 99/142 
  
  
that the clinical characteristics of the patients with potential absorption impairment, e.g. because of small 
bowel disease, may support the dosing decision by the prescriber including considerations to use an 
anticoagulant with parenteral route of administration. This is reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
There was an imbalance in the number of treatment emergent bleedings in the youngest cohort.  On-
treatment bleeding events occurred in 6/22 (27.3%) children aged 0 to < 2 years in the dabigatran group, 
one of which was a major bleed, and 0 (N=13) in the SoC group. In light of the apparently low exposure, 
with a large proportion discontinuing treatment early and/or doses that were initially too low to be accepted 
based on laboratory monitoring of dabigatran concentration, and with mean dabigatran trough values in this 
age group just above the lower limit of the recommended range, these data were of concern to the CHMP. In 
addition, as discussed in the SAG meeting, as the study has shown non-inferiority with respect to efficacy, 
but not superiority, the observed imbalance of mostly minor bleeding should be investigated further. 
Therefore, in line with the recommendations from the SAG experts, it was agreed that there is a need for 
post-authorisation data collection to characterise better the safety profile of dabigatran. This was considered 
as the only way of further characterising the use of dabigatran etexilate in the very young children. The 
Applicant has provided a draft synopsis for non-interventional European multinational multi-centre cohort 
study based on newly collected data of patients administered dabigatran for VTE treatment or prevention of 
recurrent VTE (for details please, see the discussion on Clinical Safety). 
In contrast to the adult patient population with VTE, the paediatric patient population with VTE include a high 
proportion of patients with central line thrombosis (CLT), and a tangible proportion with cerebral venous 
sinus thrombosis (CVST). Central venous line thrombosis (CLT) as Index type VTE was more frequent in the 
younger age-groups Birth to <2 years and 2 to <12 years than in the older age-group12 to <18 years. This 
is expected. Within the age-group Birth to <2 years, the break-down on the smaller age-groups Birth to 
<6 months, 6 to <12 months and 1 to <2 years did not show any clear distribution pattern as the 
numbers in each group was small. Data from the literature show that, in general, the majority of patients 
with CLT are asymptomatic. This is explained by the fact that this VTE type is primordially hospital acquired 
and difficult for the clinician to distinguish from the underlying condition causing the hospitalisation. In the 
trials 1160.106 and 1160.108, an objective diagnosis of the VTE by an imaging technique was required for 
enrolment and therefore, symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were included as the inclusion criterion 
was based on a positive imaging of a VTE. This approach was accepted. As expected, the underlying 
conditions in patients with CLT were most frequently cancer (only in the DE arm) and congenital heart 
disease, including heart failure.  
It was acknowledged that for CLT treatment duration is not clearly specified. It is noted that there is one 
study ongoing comparing VTE regimens of different duration (6 weeks vs 3 months; The Kids-DOTT trial 
[NCT00687882]) with results available in 2021 that should further inform the guidelines). The Applicant has 
provided adequate justification for the required treatment duration of 3 months in study 1160.106. The 
actual treatment duration in the CLT group was shorter in the DE arm, mean 75.3 days, than in the SoC arm, 
mean 90.1 days, and in the DE arm it was shorter in the youngest age-groups: Birth to 6 months: mean 57.0 
days, 6 to <12 months: mean 68.5 days, 1 to <2 years 84.0 days, 2 to < 12 years: mean 76.3 days and 12 
to <18 years: mean 83.5 days. In the SoC arm treatment duration was overall in the range of 90 days, with 
slightly longer duration in the youngest age-group Birth to <2 years, mean: 96.2 days (with no clear trend in 
the smaller age-groups within this group), than in the older age-groups, 2 to <12 years, mean 85.8 days, 
and 12 to <18 years, mean 87.0 days. The overall bleeding rate in patients with symptomatic, asymptomatic 
and chronic CLT thrombosis was low with one major bleeding in the DE arm, age-group 2- <12 years, and 
one minor bleedings, age-group 0 – 6 months in study 1160.106 and one patients with several minor 
bleedings in study 1160.108. These incidences do not suggest a different bleeding pattern in CLT patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 100/142 
  
  
compared to the overall patient population. The treatment durations in the CLT group did not differ from the 
treatment durations of the overall study population in total and broken down on age- and treatment groups. 
It is accepted that a different length of therapy for children with  catheter-related VTE is not recommended. 
The proportions of patients with CVST was greater in the lower age-groups Birth to <2 years (with no clear 
pattern in the smaller age-groups within this group) and 2 to <12 years, than in the older age-group 12 to 
<18 years. This is as expected. The patient selection excluded patients with CVST accompanied with 
intracranial bleeding. For patients with CVST, the frequencies of any bleeding were 5 of 20 patients (25%) on 
DE and 4 of 6 patients (66.7%) on SoC. No dependency on age was observed. There was one major bleed in 
each treatment group and no clinically relevant non-major bleed. Because of a major bleeding in the DE 
group in a subject with meningitis, an exclusion criterion on CVST with intracranial infection was implemented 
in the study. As discussed with the experts at the SAG, the guidelines support the need for anticoagulant 
treatment in CVST despite the known risk of bleeding, especially intracranial bleeding. In fact, according to 
the SAG experts, CVST with intracranial bleeding is an indication for anticoagulants, since the bleeding 
usually diminishes if the thrombus resolves. In the paediatric studies with dabigatran in CVST the rate of 
bleeding events was as expected and comparable to the SoC arm (5 bleeds in 20 patients with dabigatran 
[with 1 ICH and 4 minors] vs 4 bleeds in 6 patients with SoC [with 1 ICH and 3 minors]). In line with the 
exclusion of patients with meningitis, encephalitis and intracranial abscess in the clinical study the experts 
suggested a contraindication regarding these conditions. However, it was challenging to provide any precise 
recommendation in case these inflammatory conditions develop during treatment with dabigatran and 
treatment should be considered on case-by -case basis. Therefore, a warning statement in section 4.4 on 
haemorrhagic risk has been updated with active meningitis, encephalitis and intracranial abscess added to 
the haemorrhagic risk factors, and the exclusion criterion on these conditions has been added to the 
description of study 1160.106 in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Both study 1160.106 and 1160.108 included symptomatic as well as asymptomatic patients with respect to 
the VTE. In particular, it is noted that patients with CTL are often asymptomatic with respect to the VTE, 
which is acknowledged. For patients with acute VTE, the VTE recurrence rate at 3 months was slightly higher 
(4.0%) than in patients with chronic VTE (0.9%) treated with DE and an approximate pre-treatment of 3 
months. The bleeding risk at 3 months was higher in patients with acute VTE (21.6%) than in patients with 
chronic VTE (18.6%), treated with DE. But this analyse cannot be done without considering the very 
important difficulties to include patients less than 18 years, and above all the youngest ages in clinical trials. 
In addition, VTE in children remains a rare condition. The most difficult challenge in this paediatric extension 
procedure was the recruitment of subjects. In trials 1160.106 and 1160.108 the main objectives were to 
assess the efficacy and safety of DE relative to SoC and to document the appropriateness of the proposed DE 
dosing algorithm for use in patients from birth to less than 18 years of age. No sub groups analysis in 
symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients had been planned. As discussed at the SAG meeting, while 
recognizing the scarcity of data in the youngest age category was noted, “the existence of some evidence in 
this group was welcomed given the known difficulties in recruiting children into the clinical trials with 
anticoagulants”. 
Though the analyses (interim and final) were not consistent with a sequential design as this should have 
been, the Applicant's has justified this approach as it was agreed in the context of the PIP approved by the 
PDCO. The submitted final analysis including all participants in the trial confirms and fully supports the 
interim analysis outcome previously provided. At the time of the interim analysis, the 10% type-I error was 
not fully justified in the context of also using a much wider 20% non-inferiority margin. With the final 
analysis, additional 95% CIs have been provided for analyses including sensitivity analyses on the final 
population analysis (267 patients). The 95% confidence limits of the treatment effect in the primary and 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 101/142 
  
  
sensitivity analyses show consistency with the non-inferiority conclusion. Same consistency is noticed in 
subgroups analyses and except for female subgroup, only small size subgroups display confidence limits 
exceeding the non-inferiority margin, which is understandable. 
The design of trial 1160.106 was an open-label, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial of DE versus 
Standard of Care (SoC), which included UFH, LMWH, VKA, or fondaparinux according to clinical practice. It 
appears that 46 patients in the SoC arm received VKA treatment. This is more than half the total of 90 
patients enrolled in the SoC arm. However, the TTR was not recorded or calculated for patients on VKA nor 
was there a pre-specified target TTR that had to be achieved. Among 22 patients with INR values at baseline 
and pretreatment visit 1 and 2, all were below 2. At visits 4 through visit 8 between 34/46 (73.9%) to 42/46 
(91.3%) had INR values measured. At these visits, between 26.5% to 50% had values below 2, 20.6% to 
42.5% had values between 2-3, and 6.5% to 52.9% had values above 3. The Applicant argues that TTR is 
known to be low in children and the observation time in trial 1160.106 was limited. However, it is noted that 
a Forest plot of the primary endpoint by type of control treatment seems to favor VKA treatment although 
not statistically significant and still within the NI conclusion of the primary analysis (see subgroup analyses 
above). Given the known difficulties with VKA treatment in children, the lack of data on TTR and a defined 
INR target for the VKA treatment it is surprising that more than half of the children in study 1160.106 were 
treated with VKA. In current clinical guidelines on treatment of paediatric VTE, LMWH is generally preferred 
over VKA (Albisetti M et al., UpToDate 2020). However, the Applicant argues that the SoC was reflecting 
clinical practice as it was up to the investigator to choose from several SoC treatments based on local 
practice. The Applicant did not supply the SoC treatments, only the dabigatran in the respective age-
appropriate dosage forms. Therefore, the distribution of VKA and LMWH, respectively, observed in the main 
study is reflecting the investigators clinical preferences: 
• 
• 
Children 2 to 18 years, VKA (53,3%) and LMWH (45,4%) 
Children birth to 2years, VKA (61,5) and LMWH (38,5%) 
The difference between VKA and LMWH is more pronounced in the youngest age-group, possibly because the 
VKA is available as oral solution. The Applicant argued that the on INR observed in patients treated with VKA 
in study is similar to what has been reported for VKA control in children in the literature (Bergman Santos B 
217). Despite the ACCP guidelines recommend monitoring of anti-Xa activity to guide dosing for LMWH, and 
the protocol stating: “patients assigned to take SoC were to follow the investigator’s recommendation for 
adequate dosing and administration based on the products locally approved and in consideration of local 
treatment guidelines. The SoC dose was to be monitored regularly as appropriate (e.g. INR for VKAs)”, anti-
Xa monitoring in patients on LMWH was not done routinely by the investigator. It is acknowledged, that 
monitoring of the anti-Xa activity is only really required in case of “careful biological monitoring by anti-Xa 
activity measurement in renally impaired patients” (Lovenox Art 30 referral 2016 EMEA/H/A-30/1429). It has 
to be noted that “Renal dysfunction (eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m2 using the Schwartz formula) or requirement 
for dialysis” was an exclusion criterion. Consequently, this can explain that no data have been presented to 
justify that anti-Xa monitoring and dose adjustments were done in children receiving LWMH. In conclusion all 
this underlines that all presented data are from the real-life clinical setting despite of official guidelines or 
recommendations. The demonstration of non-inferiority of DE as compared to SoC is not questioned. Just one 
patient 12 years old received as SoC fondaparinux. Fondaparinux product is not recommended for use in 
children below 17 years of age due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.  This has been specified in the 
description of the SoC treatment in section 5.1 as follows: “… fondaparinux (1 patient 12 years old)”. The 
development of the new treatment in VTE for children based on a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) seems 
well justified as current standard of care with UFH, LMWH and VKA is based on data obtained in adults.

The justification for the open-label design was that different paediatric formulations of DE and the i.v./s.c. 
administration of some of the SoC treatments would have required an unethical number of dummy 
treatments in a blinded trial, especially considering the vulnerability of a paediatric trial population. 
Investigators, patients, and trial members will be unblinded. The only party blinded to treatment assignment 
are members of the Adjudication Committee. The Applicant has provided all versions (3 in total) of the trial 
statistical analysis plan (TSAP) and the following table with all the changes. It is noted that the open-label 
trial design was agreed within the PIP. The changes to the TSAP during the course of the trial are reflecting 
protocol amendments that have been agreed with the PDCO within the PIP and/or the FDA. The primary 
endpoint analysis has remained stable since the first revision 28-AUG-2015, when only 8 patients were 
randomized in the study. The key endpoints have been adjudicated in a blinded fashion. The Applicant’s 
assurance that the changes to the TSAP during the course of the study was not data driven was accepted. 
While not clear in the initial submission, it has been clarified in the present submission that the course of the 
initial parental therapy is not included in the treatment period of 3 months with the randomised treatment of 
DE vs. SoC in study 1160.106.   
The exclusion criteria were generally in line with the known safety profile of DE, but the exclusion criterion on 
reduced kidney function are different from the current contraindication in adults with reduced kidney 
function. This exclusion criterion has evolved during the course of the study as new PK data have become 
available. This approach was chosen to apply a conservative criterion knowing that new-borns renal function 
is immature. This approach is acknowledged and sufficiently explains the rationale for the stepwise decrease 
of the eGFR threshold in the clinical studies. It appears that with Global amendment 9 (dated 6 Feb 2019) the 
eGFR threshold in exclusion criterion 2 was lowered to <50 mL/min/1.73 m2 using the Schwartz formula for 
all patients, irrespective of their age. The threshold in the current SmPC for adults is CrCL < 30 mL/min.  
Based on the following considerations: (1) the reasons for the exclusion criterion for eGFR, (2) a 
pharmacokinetic rationale for expecting that impaired renal function (for any reason) will affect the 
PK/excretion of DE, (3) the experience with DE treatment in adults with renal impairment (“In phase I studies 
the exposure (AUC) of dabigatran after the oral administration of Pradaxa is approximately 2.7-fold higher in 
adult volunteers with moderate renal insufficiency (CrCL between 30 and 50 mL/min) than in those without 
renal insufficiency. In a small number of adult volunteers with severe renal insufficiency (CrCL 
10-30 mL/min), the exposure (AUC) to dabigatran was approximately 6 times higher and the half-life 
approximately 2 times longer than that observed in a population without renal insufficiency” (from the DE 
SmPC) and (4) the physiology of the renal function development in infants a contraindication of renal 
impairment in children in the SmPC has been added to section 4.3. The SmPC section 4.2 and 4.4 have been 
aligned with the information in section 4.3.  
The DE treatment consisted of 3 different age-appropriate formulations: capsules, coated granules and oral 
liquid formulation (OLF). The dosing algorithm recommended the following use of the 3 formulation: 
Patients aged ≥8 years: Age and weight adjusted dabigatran etexilate capsules. 
Patients aged <8 years or for patients who cannot take capsules even if older than 8 (but below 12 years of 
age): Age and weight adjusted dabigatran etexilate coated granules. 
Patients aged <12 months: Age and weight adjusted dabigatran etexilate OLF or any other alternative age-
appropriate formulation. For patients <12 months of age, OLF is preferred over coated granules provided that 
OLF supplies are available to the site. 
The dosing algorithm, which was developed on the basis of the RECOVER trial and the phase 1 and 2a PK 
trials in the paediatric program was targeting a dabigatran trough concentration of ≥50 to <250 ng/mL. 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 103/142 
  
  
As discussed in the section on pharmacology, the different formulations are not bioequivalent. The relative 
bioavailability of the formulations was used to qualify the dosing regimen in the paediatric studies. However, 
in the clinical paediatric studies the apparent relative bioavailability paradoxically turned out to be lower for 
oral solution and coated granules than for capsules. The following statement is, therefore, added to the SmPC 
section 4.2: “When changing between the formulations, the prescribed dose may need to be altered. The 
dose stated in the relevant dosing table of a formulation should be prescribed for the age and weight of the 
child.”  
The dosing algorithm included an option for up-titration once during the trial. A high proportion of subjects 
had a dose adjustment during treatment in study 1160.106. Furthermore, more patients on DE than SoC 
discontinued study treatment prematurely. A major reason for premature discontinuation of DE was failure to 
achieve a trough concentration within the target therapeutic range of 50-250 ng/mL. Only one dose 
adjustment was allowed according to Global amendment no. 2 implemented early in the study (28 January 
2015). It appears that the younger patients (mean age 6.0 years) taking oral solution or coated granules 
were more likely not to reach the target therapeutic range after titration than the older paediatric patients 
(mean age 11.6 years) taking capsules. Steady-state dabigatran trough exposures for younger patients 
treated with coated granules or oral solution were lower than that of older patients treated with capsules. As 
has been discussed in the pharmacology section of this report, the bioavailability of the coated granules 
seems to be lower in children, which could be part of the explanation. It meant that the probability of 
reaching the target therapeutic range of 50 to - <250 ng/mL was lower in the younger patients receiving oral 
solution or coated granules (pellets). It is noted that the target therapeutic range’s lower limit of 50 ng/mL 
was defined for technical reasons alone (LLOQ of Hemoclot®). However, a lower limit of 26 ng/mL, i.e. a 
range of 26  to <250 ng/mL would be therapeutically justified based on the RE-COVER study. With the lower 
limit of 26 ng/mL more patients would have reached the target therapeutic range and not needing dose 
adjustment and potential discontinuation. The revised dosing algorithm, which is discussed elsewhere in this 
report including in the pharmacology section, has been modelled to increase the likelihood of reaching the 
target therapeutic range in the younger patients taking coated granules.  
The eGFR summarized across all age-groups was higher in those who did not (N=17) versus those who did 
(N=159) reach the therapeutic range: Mean eGFR 151.758 versus 111.827 mL/min/1.73m2, median eGFR 
156.655 versus 105.728 mL/min/1.73m2. This is consistent with dabigatran clearance properties; plasma 
levels of dabigatran would be lower in those with higher renal clearance. This is also consistent with the 
predominant renal excretion of dabigatran and renal capacity being highest in children up to 14 years 
(Schwartz GJ Pediatr Nephrol 2007;22:1839-1848).  
In addition, within the birth to <2 years age-group 3/7 on flavored oral solution only failed to reach the 
target therapeutic range compared to 0/6 on unflavored oral solution only and 1/8 on coated granules only. 
As the acceptability studies indicate similar acceptance of flavored and unflavored solution, the use of 
flavoured solvent is no longer required for acceptable tolerability of the oral solution. Therefore, the Applicant 
proposed to register the unflavoured solvent only. 
Overall, 63/176 (35.8%) had a dose-adjustment. The majority of these, 46/63 (73.0%), reached the target 
therapeutic range, whereas 17/63 (27.0%) of these or 17/176 (9.6%) of all did not. Interestingly, the data 
suggests that patients, who discontinued treatment due to failure to reach target range had higher rate of 
thrombus resolution 9/17 (52.9%) vs. 72/160 (45.0%), and lower rate of recurrent VTE 0/17 (0%) vs. 7/160 
(4.4%) than patients who continued treatment. The Applicant explained the apparent paradoxical observation 
as a play of chance based on small numbers. The change of status of only one patient with or without a 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 104/142 
  
  
thrombus resolution or a recurrent VTE under DE would almost eliminate or even reverse the numerical 
differences: 
•  One patient less having a thrombus resolution (8/17 instead of 9/17) would lead to a rate of 47% 
instead of 52.9%, compared to 72/160 (45.0%). 
•  One patient more with a recurrent VTE (1/17 instead of 0/17) would lead to a rate of 5.9% instead of 
0%, compared to 7/160 (4.4%). 
This explanation was accepted. As requested, the Applicant has discussed the need for dose 
titration/monitoring because of the concern that the target concentration for a considerable proportion of the 
paediatric patient is not easily and fast obtained. This is a concern because it may compromise the efficacy 
and safety of the treatment. The Applicant has provided additional descriptive statistics for steady state 
plasma concentrations of total dabigatran  at Visit 3 (after at least 6 consecutive dabigatran doses), post-
titration (at least  3 days after a dabigatran dose adjustment), and over all visits, please see section on 
“Adjustments to reach target plasma dabigatran concentrations” above in this report. It can be seen that the 
difference in exposure over the full treatment period when a dose titration had taken place compared with 
the expected exposure had it not taken place is <15% difference for all subgroups. Furthermore, the 
Applicant refers to simulation data based on the final PK model, which is the basis for the revised dosing 
algorithm. It shows that most of the patients in Trial 1160.106 were actually within the target range of 26 - 
<250 ng/mL, which is therapeutically justified based on the RE-COVER study.  
Regarding the patients switching from DE to SoC, as complete thrombus resolution and recurrent VTE were 
similar to the DE only group at day 84, it appears that switching from DE to SoC did not incur loss of chance 
in these patients. There is higher frequency of bleeding events and adverse and serious adverse events in the 
patients switching from DE to SoC. The Applicant has confirmed that the bleeding events occurred before 
switching while patients were on-treatment with DE. With respect to the bleeding events during the on-
treatment period showing higher frequencies in patients switching from DE to SoC, the Applicant suggests the 
difference is mainly driven by the major imbalance in the sample size of these subgroups and offered no 
other explanation. It was acknowledged that it is not statistically significant, so even if it would be of interest 
to know if there had been a link between bleeding and discontinuation in these cases, it seemed to remain 
speculative and will not be pursued further. With respect to adverse events while patients were still taking DE 
or during the 6-day residual effect period showing higher frequencies in patients switching from DE to SoC, 
the Applicant suggested that due to the large imbalance in total numbers of each group and the missing 
option for SOC to switch to dabigatran, any comparisons are inconclusive, and offers no other explanation. 
Although it would be of interest to understand better if and how there had been a link between AEs and 
discontinuations, it seems to remain speculative, except for 7 cases reported as discontinuations because of 
AEs, and will not be pursued further.  
Treatment discontinuation considered as a treatment failure corresponds to the sensitivity analysis using the 
"worst-case imputation" rule. The 95% confidence interval of the treatment effect provided by this sensitivity 
analysis performed in the final population, is consistent with the non-inferiority conclusion (d=0.05, 95%CI: 
[-0.063, +0.163], cf. CSR 1160-06 final analysis, page 300). 
In response to a question on the worst-case sensitivity analyses, where the same imputation rule is applied 
in both treatment groups, which is not considered a conservative approach in a non-inferiority setting, the 
Applicant has provided clarifications on the tipping point and “worst case” (assumed treatment failure in all 
switch patients) sensitivity analyses. In the tipping point analysis, missing observations of the primary 
combined endpoint were imputed from binominal distributions with fixed response rates ranging from 0 – 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 105/142 
  
  
100% evenly spaced by 20% for the combination of DE and SoC arms. The analysis showed that for all 
imputation scenarios with the SoC response rate equal to or lower than the DE response rat, the NI test p-
value was 0.01 or lower. In the scenario with a SoC response rate up to 20% higher than the DE response 
rate would still yield a NI test p-value within the range 0.01 – 0.05. 
In the DE switch to SoC analysis, all 22 patients who switched from dabigatran to SoC were considered to 
have failed meeting the primary endpoint of survival with complete thrombus resolution and no recurrent 
VTE. In that analysis the point estimate is numerically slightly in disfavour of dabigatran: 0.013, 95% CI -
0.110, 0.136. However, it is not statistically significant and the 95% CI upper bound is still within the NI 
margin. It was accepted that the range of sensitivity analyses performed support the primary NI result.  
From a methodological perspective, it is noted that the power calculation is based on simulations of 
Newcombe-Wilson confidence intervals using a 10% significance level, and an assumption of a resolution rate 
of 72% for both DE and SoC arms. When using a non-inferiority margin of 20% the power to demonstrate 
non-inferiority is 82%. The non-inferiority margin of 20%, the significance level of 10% and the sample and 
strata size were agreed with PDCO. 
In the final CTR, submitted together with this response document, efficacy was summarized based on the 
complete randomized set including patients covered in the interim CTRs, as well as new patients recruited 
after interim database snapshot on 28 Mar 2020. Of the 267 randomized patients, 81 patients (45.8%) in the 
DE group and 38 patients (42.2%) in the SOC group met the criteria for efficacy endpoint. The point estimate 
of Mantel-Haenszel weighted rate difference −0.038 showed a favourable treatment effect of DE over SOC, 
and the corresponding 95% CI (−0.161, 0.086) demonstrated non-inferiority of DE to SOC (p<0.0001). 
Considering the potential for unintentional bias in this open-label trial, each component of the primary 
efficacy endpoint and bleeding and fatal events were assessed centrally by a blinded, independent 
adjudication committee, which assured the quality and comparability of the endpoints. 
The 1160.106 trial treatment was foreseen to be administered for 12 weeks. Inclusion  criterion #3 ensured 
that only patients with an anticipated  treatment duration of at least 3 months with anticoagulants for the 
VTE episode were  included into the trial. However, if a patient did not require treatment with anticoagulants 
any  longer due to complete thrombus resolution as confirmed by appropriate imaging modalities prior to 12 
weeks of treatment the patient had to be discontinued from trial treatment  
It is noted that the open-label trial design was agreed within the PIP. The changes to the TSAP during the 
course of the trial are reflecting protocol amendments that have been agreed with the PDCO within the PIP 
and/or the FDA. The primary endpoint analysis has remained stable since the first revision 28-AUG-2015, 
when only 8 patients were randomized in the study, see the history table above. The key endpoints have 
been adjudicated in a blinded fashion.  
Regarding the 22 patients who switched from DE to SoC, the Applicant has provided detailed information on 
continued anticoagulant exposure after discontinuation of DE in the 22 patients, who switched from DE to 
SoC. It proves that continued exposure to anticoagulant treatment (SoC) after switching from DE was 
present in the vast majority of patients. Nevertheless, as discussed elsewhere, a sensitivity analysis counting 
all 22 switch patients as treatment failures still showed non-inferiority, although the point estimate 
numerically shifted in disfavour of dabigatran. This was considered acceptable.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 328 patients were screened/enrolled, at 65 sites in 26 countries. The largest proportions of treated 
patients overall and across age groups were from Central Europe (56.4%), followed by North America 
(21.1%) and Western Europe (18.0%). At country level, Russia contributed the most patients (28.2%); the 
next largest contributions came from the Czech Republic (17.3%), and United States (11.3%). Although the 
Number of treated patients by region and country seems skewed towards Central Europe, a subgroup 
analysis of the primary endpoints by regions defined as Central Europe, Western Europe, North America, 
Latin America, Asia, Other, respectively, did not indicate heterogeneity.  
The sequence of global amendments, 9 in total, reflects that the dosing algorithm and posology of the 
different dosage forms in the 3 age strata have evolved in the course of the study. This combined phase 
II/III approach has been taking in agreement with the PDCO and the study has been conducted according to 
the KBE, please see the PDCO compliance report. 
The amendments also indicate that recruitment may have been challenging. The target number of patients 
has been reduced twice during the course of the study. This is not unexpected in a study in a relatively rare 
disease in children. The reductions of target number of patients have been agreed with the PDCO in PIP 
modifications. 
 A higher frequency of important protocol deviations (iPD) in the DE arm (28.2%) vs. the SoC arm (12.2%) 
in the final analysis appears to be driven by imbalances related to medication handling/compliance rules and 
concomitant medication. These procedures were more applicable to the DE than the SoC treated patients 
because of the different requirements for the DE and SoC randomized patient groups related to medication 
handling and dosing. In this study a series of sensitivity analyses, including worst-case scenarios have been 
conducted, which are all consistent with the NI conclusion. Therefore, it is not likely the impact of the iPD 
imbalances will change this conclusion. 
At the time of the interim analysis, regulatory GCP inspections had been conducted at 6 sites in 3 countries. 
It is noted that no critical GCP violations were observed in the course of the audits that have been conducted. 
Some imbalances were identified in the baseline data on demography, leading index VTE and history of VTE. 
To evaluate the impact of the imbalance between the DE and SoC arm with respect previous VTE besides the 
index VTE, the Applicant has performed a sensitivity analysis in those patients with a history of VTE, 14 in 
each group. The overall frequency of complete thrombus resolution is lower in patients with previous VTE 
than in patients with no previous VTE besides the index VTE. There is a numerical higher frequency of 
complete thrombus resolution in the DE arm 4/14 (28.6%) than in the SoC arm 2/14 (14.3%), and the 
difference in rates (SoC – DE) is -0.143, which is numerically lower than the primary analysis result of -
0.038. However, like the primary analysis result, the difference is not statistically significant as both the 90% 
CI and 95% CI are crossing 0. The upper limit of both these Cis are below the NI margin of 20%. It is 
accepted that the baseline imbalance with respect to the history of previous VTE does not seem to impact the 
NI conclusion in any significant way. The imbalance with respect to the proportions of patients with cancer is 
significant in the final analysis. As cancer is associated with high risk of recurrence of VTE this imbalance is to 
the disfavour of DE.  Despite, the primary endpoint demonstrated NI of DE vs. SoC there were consistent and 
numerically better results on the components of the combined endpoint. This was considered reassuring. 
However, since there were other imbalances of baseline characteristics to the disfavor of SoC, e.g. congenital 
heart disease and heart failure, which may also be associated with increased risk of recurrence of VTE, it was 
not possible to draw strong conclusions from these observations beyond what is shown in the primary 
analysis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 107/142 
  
  
The secondary endpoint of major bleeding suggests no difference between treatment arms, and low overall 
bleeding rate. The sensitivity analysis using the intention-to-treat period seems to confirm that. All-cause 
mortality is very low. 
The results for the individual component of the combined endpoints seem consistent with the overall 
outcome. 
The Applicant have conducted a series of acceptability studies with the capsules, coated granules and OLF. 
Studies have been done in all trials. In trial 1160.106, the administration of capsules and granules was 
generally assessed as good or acceptable by investigators, parents, and patients. The acceptability of 
capsules has been confirmed in trial 1160.108. The acceptability of pellets or granules is confirmed in trial 
1160.108 considering that some of the patients treated with coated granules were very young.  
When considering the full data from the completed phase IIb/III trials in addition to the previously completed 
Phase IIa trials, the use of flavoured solvent was considered no longer required for acceptable tolerability of 
the oral solution. Therefore, it was agreed to register the unflavoured solvent as a replacement for the 
flavoured solvent and to adapt the set of annexes accordingly. 
Compatibility  
Compatibility of the oral solution with nasal tubes in different materials was evaluated and data 
demonstrating compatibility and recovery of doses has been provided. However, administration of the 
reconstituted oral solution in feeding tubes is not recommended in the SmPC and PL since the oral syringe 
does not fit with marketed nasal tubes.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the final CTR for study 1160.106, efficacy was summarized based on the complete randomized set 
including patients covered in the interim CTRs, as well as new patients recruited after interim database 
snapshot on 28 Mar 2020. Of the 267 randomized patients, 81 patients (45.8%) in the DE group and 38 
patients (42.2%) in the SOC group met the criteria for efficacy endpoint. The point estimate of Mantel-
Haenszel weighted rate difference −0.038 showed a favourable treatment effect of DE over SOC, and the 
corresponding 95% CI (−0.161, 0.086) demonstrated non-inferiority of DE to SOC (p<0.0001).  
However, although the final analysis provided some clarity on the patients <1 year of age there continued to 
be limitations of patient numbers and treatment exposures in the Birth to <2 years age-group considering 
the differences in terms of immaturity of coagulation system and renal function and leading index VTE types 
compared to the older age-groups and adults.  
Furthermore, the benefit of anticoagulant therapy was less clear for CLT than for other types of VTE. In 
addition, the risk of bleeding, especially intracranial bleeding, could be different in subjects with CVST as 
compared to other types of VTE, in particular for acute CVST. The reliance on data from adults may not be 
applicable in these types of thrombosis. 
These issues were discussed with independent experts at a SAG meeting on 7 September 2020 and 
addressed by the Applicant in their responses during the procedure. The scarcity of data in the youngest age 
category was noted by the independent experts but the existence of some evidence in this group was 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 108/142 
  
  
 
welcomed given the known difficulties in recruiting children into the clinical trials with anticoagulants. 
Because there is an imbalance in mostly minor bleedings in the youngest age-groups on dabigatran 
compared to SoC in this non-inferiority study, the CHMP concluded that there is a need for post-authorisation 
data collection to characterise better the safety profile of dabigatran. The Applicant has provided a draft 
synopsis for non-interventional European multinational multi-center cohort study based on newly collected 
data of patients administered dabigatran for VTE treatment or prevention of recurrent VTE (see discussion in 
Clinical Safety section below). The fact that there are only limited data available supporting efficacy and 
safety of dabigatran by type of VTE subgroup, including CLT and CVST was noted. However, it was felt that 
the available evidence does not give rise to any particular concern and therefore the SAG experts 
recommended dabigatran to be available also for treatment of children in these two conditions. In line with 
the exclusion of patients with meningitis, encephalitis and intracranial abscess in the clinical study the 
experts suggested a contraindication regarding these conditions. However, it was challenging to provide any 
precise recommendation in case these inflammatory conditions develop during treatment with dabigatran and 
treatment should be considered on case-by -case basis. Therefore, the warning statement in section 4.4 on 
haemorrhagic risk has been updated with active meningitis, encephalitis and intracranial abscess added to 
the haemorrhagic risk factors, and the exclusion criterion on these conditions has been added to the 
description of study 1160.106 in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The line extension for the use of DE in treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric 
patients from birth to less than 18 years of age was considered acceptable from efficacy point of view.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
This safety data encompass data from 5 clinical trials that investigated DE in paediatric patients; three phase 
IIa trials in children of different age groups, a ‘standard of care’-controlled phase III trial, and an open-label 
single arm safety study. An overview of all 5 trials is provided in Table 1 below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 109/142 
  
  
 
 
 
The three phase IIa studies included 9, 18, and 8 patients. At the time of the interim analysis the 1160.106 
study included 234 patients, 88 rolled over to the 1160.108 study. The 1160.108 study included 203 patients. 
The individual studies and specific requirements for conducting interim analyses to be included in the application 
have been agreed with the PDCO. Data cut-off for the interim analyses of studies 1160.106 and 1160.108 was 
28 Feb 2019. 
 The final CSRs for study 1160.106 included 267 patients, for study 1160.108 214 patients (91 patients rolled 
over from study 1160.106 to 1160.80).  
Patient exposure 
A summary of the overall exposure in the full safety population is given below: 
However, the majority of the patients were exposed in the phase IIb/III trials which had a planned treatment 
duration between 12 and 64 weeks. Overall, 300 patients aged 0-<18 years were exposed to DE in the phase 
IIb/III trials. Approximately 30% (87 patients) were exposed between 0 and 12 weeks, 20% (58 patients) 
were exposed for 12-18 weeks, while 32% (97 patients) were exposed for more than 42 weeks. The 
exposure dose was calculated based on weight and age. 
Demographics and disease characteristics 
The demographics of the full safety population is shown in the table below. The included patients were 
balanced with regard to gender, comprised mainly Caucasian (approx. 90%) with the majority living in 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 110/142 
  
  
 
 
Europe (70%) or America (24%). The age of the population reflects the inclusion of patients 0-18 years. The 
majority of the patients suffered from DVT (approx. 63%) while both pulmonary embolism (10%) and 
cerebral venous or sinus thrombosis (9%) were the second most common types of VTE. 
More adolescents than other children suffered from PE, while the frequency of cerebral venous or sinus 
thrombosis was increased in patients aged 2-12 years (21%). The time since diagnosis of VTE was longer in 
patients aged 2-18 years than in patients younger than 2 years. The mean eGFRs were well above the 
recommended 50 mL/min/1.73m2, with only a few patients in the phase IIa trials with eGFRs slightly below 
50 mL/min/1.73m2

Patient disposition 
The patient disposition of the full safety population is shown below. Overall, approximately 10% of the 
children discontinued the studies prematurely. However, as patients in the phase IIa trials were treated for a 
shorter period (1-3 doses of DE), the discontinuation rates were higher in the phase IIb/III studies, where 
the planned treatment phase was three months or longer (for disposition in the phase IIa/III studies, please 
refer to the AR). More patients in the younger age groups discontinued the phase IIb/III studies prematurely 
than adolescents (50% 0-<2 years, 37% 2-<12 years, 26% 12-<18 years).

Adverse events 
Any AE was reported in 70% of the full safety population. The number was slightly higher (77%) in the phase 
IIb/III studies, probably due to patients being included for a longer time. In these studies, 26% experienced 
adverse events assessed as being drug-related. 
The  incidence  of  AEs  assessed  as  being  drug-related  appeared  higher  in  the  older  age  groups,  with 
approximately  15-20%  of  patients  <12  years  and  29%  of  patients  aged  12-<18  years  experiencing  drug-
related AEs. Similarly, there was an increased incidence of serious AEs (SAEs) in the older age groups, although 
the numbers are small and must be interpreted cautiously. 
An overview of the occurrence of AEs in the phase IIb/III studies is given in the table below. The results for 
the  full  safety  population  are  not  shown  but  resembled  the  results  for  the  full  population,  although  the 
frequencies of AEs were lower (i.e. appeared diluted by the patients included in the phase IIa studies).

The  most  frequent  AEs  in  the  full  safety  population  are  shown  in  the  table  below  and  included  headache 
(14.7%),  nasopharyngitis  (14.0%),  and  vomiting  (9.0%)  as  the  single  most  common  AEs.  Of  note, 
approximately half of the reported cases of headache was attributable to baseline conditions (e.g. headache, 
mastoiditis,  intracranial  hypertension,  cerebral  venous  thrombosis,  and  only  one  case  of  headache  was 
considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  the  study  drug.  Bleeding  events  are  shown  as  bleedings  at 
specific sites in the table below but a summary of all bleeding events is provided in the section of AESIs.

The standard of care’ (SoC)-controlled phase III study provides the only comparison of AEs in the DE group 
with AEs in patients receiving other regimens of anticoagulant therapy (SoC). These are shown in the table 
below.  Post  thrombotic  syndrome  was  more  common  in  the  DE  group  (4%)  as  compared  to  the  SoC  group 
(1%).

Adverse events of special interest, AESIs 
AESIs included recurrent VTE, bleeding events and changes in hepatocellular or renal function. 
VTE and Bleeding events 
Expected AEs included bleedings, these were categorised as follows: 
Major bleeding (MBE) 
• 
Fatal bleeding 
•  Clinically overt bleeding associated with a decrease in haemoglobin of at least 2 g/dL (20 g/L) in a 24-
hour period 
•  Bleeding that was retroperitoneal, pulmonary, intracranial, or otherwise involved the central nervous 
system 
•  Bleeding that required surgical intervention in an operating suite 
Clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding 
•  Overt bleeding for which a blood product was administered and which was not directly attributable to 
the patient’s underlying medical condition 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 116/142 
  
  
 
 
•  Bleeding  that  required  medical  or  surgical  intervention  to  restore  haemostasis,  other  than  in  an 
operating suite 
Minor bleeding 
•  Any overt or macroscopic evidence of bleeding that did not fulfil the criteria for either MBE or CRNM. 
Observed VTE and bleedings in the full safety population are summarised below. Twenty percent (20%) of the 
total population experienced a bleeding. The incidence of any bleeding increased with increasing age, however, 
this was not reflected in the incidence of major bleeding events but mainly driven by the incidence of minor 
bleedings.

2 A patient may be counted in more than bleeding category 
The comparison of DE treatment and SoC in the phase III-controlled trial showed a similar incidence of major 
bleedings in the two treatment groups, all in all indicating a risk of bleeding events in patients in anticoagulant 
therapy (please refer to the table below). 
No  specific  analysis  on  freedom  from  major  bleeding  event  +  clinically  relevant  but  non-major  events have 
been provided. A table of comparison for bleeding events on-treatment period for study 1160.106 vs. 1160.108 
has not been provided either. 
Additional details on the regional pattern was provided in the 1160.108 study, final report:

Estimates of freedom from bleeding events at 12 months (95% CI) in the 3 regions with most patients, i.e. 
Western Europe (N=49), North America (N=44) and Central Europe (N=107) are as follows: Western Europe 
57.3% (39.0%, 71.9%), North America 45.3% (25.9%, 62.9%) and Central Europe 91.3 (82.1%, 95.9%). The 
estimated rate and 95% CI for freedom from bleeding in Central Europe do not overlap with the other regions 
(see later in this section). 
Hepatocellular function 
Hepatic injury was defined as an AESI. Hepatocellular injury was defined by the following alterations of liver 
parameters: An elevation of AST and/or ALT ≥3x ULN combined with an elevation of total bilirubin ≥2x ULN 
measured in the same blood draw sample. No patients met the Hy’s law criteria. However, this is also expected 
to  occur  very  rarely.  According  to  the  listing  of  laboratory  values,  some  patients  experienced  increases  of 
transaminases but the possible incidences of AEs and/or laboratory changes related to changes in hepatocellular 
function have not been adequately summarised by the Applicant. 
Increased blood creatinine 
A  creatinine  value  above  the  ULN  and  ≥2-fold  increased  from  baseline  was  pre-defined  as  an  AESI.  In  the 
controlled  phase  III  study  one  patient  (1%)  in  the  DE  group  experienced  increased  blood  creatinine  as 
compared to none in the SoC group. Further, three patients (2%) were diagnosed with renal impairment and 
one (1%) with decreased glomerular filtration rate, while no patients experienced such AE in the SoC group. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No patient died on-treatment with DE. Six patients died 6-241 days post-treatment. The narratives all indicate 
that the deaths were not related to the study medication or SoC (please refer to AR for further details regarding 
the deaths post-treatment). 
SAEs 
Serious AEs during the on-treatment period were reported for 48 patients (14.3%), all of them in the Phase 
IIb/III trials. In the Phase IIa trials, no SAE was reported on-treatment; 2 SAEs occurred post-treatment but 
appeared not related to the study medication. 
The main SAE was worsening of the underlying disease, which included DVT and PE. In the controlled phase 
III-study, there was no difference in the frequency of reported SAEs in the DE-group (N=21, 14%) and the 
SoC-group (N=19, 20%) (data not shown in tables). 
As mentioned earlier in this AR, there may be a tendency of increasing frequency of SAEs with age; N=2, 13% 
in patients aged <2 years, N=10, 15% in patients aged 2-<12 years, and N=36, 17% in patients aged 12-<18 
years. 
SAEs occurring in more than one patient are summarised in the table below.

In the Phase IIb/III trials with 12 to 52 weeks of treatment, for most safety laboratory parameters, there were 
no  relevant  changes  from  baseline  to  end  of  treatment.  In  shift-tables  for  haematological  parameters, 
electrolytes,  liver  enzymes  and  renal  parameters  only  small  changes  were  observed  in  mean  values.  In 
accordance  with  this,  only  few  patients  reported  AEs  within  the  SOC  ‘Investigations’.  More  patients  were 
reported  to  have  Possibly  clinically  significant  changes  in  haematological  parameters  and  liver  enzymes. 
Similarly,  no  clinically  relevant  ECG  changes  have  been  reported  but  the  description  of  the  ECGs  could  be 
elaborated to ascertain that no clinically relevant changes occurred.   
Safety in special populations 
For a summary of the number of AEs, SAEs, and patients who discontinued the studies early, please refer to 
the patient disposition presented in the section of Exposure. 
Age, gender, race 
The possibility of a difference in the risk of AEs including bleeding events in patients of different age groups 
have been evaluated earlier in this AR, please refer to the sections of AEs and AESIs. 
Overall, the risk of bleedings or need for dose modification appeared to be similar in males and females. The 
proportion of patients with minor bleeding events was lower in Central Europe (5 patients, 5.0%) than in the 
other main regions (North America: 12 patients, 27.9%; Western Europe: 15 patients, 31.9%; Latin America: 
5  patients,  71.4%).  Data  of  the  bleedings  reported in  the  different  regions  show  that  in  the  SoC  treatment 
group, a similar pattern was not observed as for this treatment group, the frequencies of bleedings were similar 
in Eastern Europe and Western Europe but a higher proportion of bleedings were reported in Northern America. 
Of note, all bleeding events (minor and major) were centrally adjudicated and the Applicant has submitted data 
showing that whereas the frequency of major bleedings were overall low (<4%), the differences between the 
regions are attributed to differences in minor bleedings. Taken together, the observed differences are not of 
major concern and are most likely due to regional differences in reporting of minor bleedings. 
Renal impairment 
Neither the CSRs, the clinical overview nor the Summary of clinical safety provide any information regarding 
the safety in patients with renal impairment. 
In both pivotal phase III trials, patients with an eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m2 (using the Schwartz formula) or 
requirement for dialysis were excluded. Accordingly, mean GFR was 107-115 mL/min/1.73 m2, with the lowest 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 119/142 
  
  
 
eGFR values being approximately 67 mL/min/1.73 m2. There is no specific information regarding the safety 
profile in patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR >60 – 89 mL/min/1.73 m2). The SmPC has been updated 
with  information  regarding  use  of  dabigatran  etexilate  in  children  with  renal  impairment  including  a 
contraindication for use in paediatric patients with an eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m2. 
Hepatic impairment 
Neither the CSRs, the clinical overview nor the Summary of clinical safety provide any information regarding 
the safety in patients with impaired hepatic function. 
According to the study protocols for trials 1160.106 and 1160.108, the following exclusion criteria applied: “a. 
Active  liver  disease,  including  known  active  hepatitis  A,  B  or  C  or,  b.  Persistent  ALT  or  AST  or  AP  >3x  ULN 
within  3  months  of  screening.  Transient  increases  of  these  parameters  were  acceptable,  if  retesting 
demonstrated results within these limits.” 
According to the CSRs for the pivotal phase III trials (Trials 1160-0106 and 1160-0108), there are no protocol 
deviations  related  to  inclusion  of  patients  with  active  liver  disease  or  persistent  increase  in  ALT  or  AST  as 
defined in the study protocol. 
Pregnancy and lactation 
According to the current SmPC, there is limited amount of data of use of DE during pregnancy however, studies 
in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. The potential risk for humans is unknown but it is recommended 
that women of childbearing potential should avoid pregnancy during treatment with DE, and DE should not be 
used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. In the paediatric trials, one pregnancy was reported, DE was 
discontinued  as  the  pregnancy  was  discovered.  It  appears  that  the  foetus  could  have  been  exposed  in  0-6 
weeks; thus, at the initial part of the pregnancy which is most vulnerable for toxic exposure. Nevertheless, it 
is reported that the patient gave birth to a healthy newborn at Week 32. 
Overdose 
A single paediatric patient in the clinical trial program for DE was documented with an overdose. Although the 
patient (1160.108, 12 to <18 years old) took the correct daily dose, the dosing for 3 days was once daily in 
the evening instead of twice daily. The event overdose (non-serious, mild intensity, recovered) occurred directly 
before  Visit  11  (last  on-treatment  visit)  on  Day  355  of  treatment.  Idarucizumab  (Praxbind®)  is  a  specific 
reversal agent which immediately reverses the antithrombotic activity of dabigatran. It has only been tested in 
adults but is currently under investigation in a paediatric population. The currently ongoing trial 1321.7 aims 
to demonstrate the safety of idarucizumab in paediatric VTE patients who receive DE in clinical trials and have 
life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding necessitating urgent intervention to rapidly reverse the anticoagulant 
effects of dabigatran. Praxbind® was first authorised in adult patients on 16 Oct 2015 in the USA and is now 
approved in adult patients in numerous countries worldwide including the EU and Japan. Trial sites of 1160.106 
and  1160.108  were  offered  to  participate  in  trial  1321.7,  if  regulatory  conditions  allowed  for  this.  The 
information that there is no experience with use of idarucizumab in the paediatric population is correctly and 
sufficiently included in the updated SmPC.  
Vital signs 
It is stated that in the Phase IIb/III trials with 12 to 52 weeks of treatment, there were no relevant changes in 
vital signs and ECGs from baseline to end of treatment, which may be inconsistent with regard to AEs reported 
in this period of the studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 120/142 
  
  
Immunological events 
Immunological events are not described in neither Clinical overview nor in Summary of Clinical safety. In the 
Phase III trials, two cases of immunological events are described. 
In Trial 1160-0106, one patient (aged 2 – >12 years) developed Hypersensitivity after switch from DE to SoC. 
This is not considered related to DE.  In Trial 1160-0108, one patient (aged 12 – >18 years) developed Drug 
hypersensitivity. Further, in the same study, one patient is reported with Hypersensitivity. However, no details 
on these cases have been provided. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
For the two-Phase III trials (1160.106 and 1160.108), the following restrictions were applied: 
“The following treatments were not to be taken prior to DE administration: Fibrinolytic agents (within 48 hours 
prior to DE administration), P-glycoprotein inducers (within one week prior to DE administration), Asparaginase 
(within one week (or within 2 weeks in case of PEG-asparaginase) prior to DE administration). The following 
treatments were not to be taken together with DE: Any VKAs, Therapeutic unfractionated heparin or LMWH, 
Fibrinolytic agents, Asparaginase, P-glycoprotein inhibitors, P-glycoprotein inducers or any other investigational 
drug.” 
Trial  1160-0108:  Overall,  153  patients  (75.4%)  took  concomitant  medications.  The  main  concomitant 
medications,  taken  by  more  than  15%  of  patients  based  on  the  ATC3  code,  were  other  analgesics  and 
antipyretics  (69  patients,  34.0%),  decongestants  and  other  nasal  preparations  for  topical  use  (35  patients, 
17.2%),  topical  products  for  joint  and  muscular  pain  (35  patients,  17.2%),  stomatological  preparations  (33 
patients, 16.3%), throat preparations (33 patients, 16.3%), and anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products 
- non-steroids (32 patients, 15.8%). 
Trial  1160-0106:  Concomitant  medications  included  all  medications  taken  prior  to  informed  consent  and 
continued during the trial as well as all medications started after informed consent. Concomitant medications 
included also medications taken up to 6 days after the last intake of trial medication. Patients could use SoC 
after Visit 8. 
Overall, 180 patients (76.6%) took concomitant medications with similar frequencies in both treatment groups 
(DE: 75.2%; SoC: 79.5%). The main concomitant medications were paracetamol (23.4%), ibuprofen (7.7%), 
and spironolactone (7.2%). 
In Trial 1160-0108, use of prohibited medication was reported in 14 (8.9%) of patients treated with DE (vs. 0 
patients in the SoC group). No information regarding the safety or reported AEs in patients with concomitant 
use of prohibited medication has been presented. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
As shown in the patient disposition, 10% of the full safety population discontinued the studies early. However, 
the  frequency  was  higher  in  the  phase  IIb/III  studies  with  a  planned  duration  of  12  weeks  or  more.  The 
discontinuations  in  these  studies  appeared  to  be  age  dependent;  50%  among  patients  0  –  <2  years,  37% 
among patients 2 – <12 years, and 26% among patients 12 – <18 years. 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 121/142 
  
  
However, neither the CSRs, the clinical overview nor the Summary of clinical safety provide an overview of AEs 
that led to early study discontinuation. From a combination of the SCS and the study reports it may be deduced 
that the most common reason for discontinuation was ‘other’ but otherwise that impaired renal function and 
coagulopathy related conditions seemed to be the most often the causes of discontinuation. 
Post marketing experience 
There is no post-marketing experience in children. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data 
Overall, 335 patients aged 0 – <18 years were treated with DE, 30 patients aged <2 years, 80 patients aged 
2 – <12 years, and 225 patients aged 12-<18 years. Of these, 300 patients aged 0 – <18 years were exposed 
to DE in either a ‘standard of care’-controlled phase III study or/and a long-term safety study. Approximately 
30% (87 patients) were exposed between 0 and 12 weeks, 20% (58 patients) were exposed for 12-18 weeks, 
while 32% (97 patients) were exposed for more than 42 weeks to the proposed dose (individually defined by 
the chosen dosing algorithm). The size of the safety database, including the number of patients of the different 
age groups, was agreed with the PDCO before the choice of data cut-off for the presented interim analyses. 
The cut-off data was 28 Feb 2019. 
Deaths, SAEs and Discontinuations 
Six patients died 6-241 days post-treatment. Narratives all indicate that the deaths were not related to the 
study medication or SoC. About 15% of patients had SAEs, which were mostly categorized as serious because 
they necessitated hospitalization of the patient. Four patients with immediately life-threatening events were 
registered. 
Among all patients, approximately 10% of the children discontinued the studies prematurely. However, in the 
phase IIb/III studies the frequency of discontinuations was higher; 50% in patients aged 0 – <2 years, 37% 
in patients aged 2 – <12 years, and 26% in patients aged 12 – <18 years. Further, in the controlled study, the 
discontinuations appeared to be more common in the DE group than in the ‘standard of care’ group. Overall, it 
appears that more patients in the youngest age group (0 – <2 years) discontinue, often due to failure to obtain 
target DE concentration.  
The Applicant has provided a draft synopsis for non-interventional European multinational multi-center 
cohort study based on newly collected data of patients administered dabigatran for VTE treatment or 
prevention of recurrent VTE. This was considered overall acceptable at this stage however the protocol of the 
study will be assessed post-authorization.  
Adverse events 
Generally, the safety profile known from the adult population was confirmed; the most significant AEs being 
bleeding events and/or risk of VTE. However, overall the reported frequencies of AEs, including bleeding 
events, were higher in the paediatric than in the adult population. This may indicate either that children are 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 122/142 
  
  
 
 
more sensitive to DE or that the dosing is relatively higher in children than in adults. Approximately 2% of 
the total population experienced major bleeding events, the frequency was similar in the DE and SoC groups.   
A regional pattern of bleeding events was observed. Data of the bleedings reported in the different regions 
show that in the SoC treatment group, a similar pattern was not observed as for this treatment group, the 
frequencies of bleedings were similar in Eastern Europe and Western Europe but a higher proportion of 
bleedings were reported in Northern America. Of note, all bleeding events (minor and major) were centrally 
adjudicated and the Applicant has submitted data showing that whereas the frequency of major bleedings 
were overall low (<4%), the differences between the regions are attributed to differences in minor bleedings. 
Taken together, the observed differences are not of major concern and are most likely due to regional 
differences in reporting of minor bleedings.  
Apart from bleeding events, two other AESIs were defined, namely reduced hepatic and renal function. Such 
events appeared to have occurred in a smaller number of patients but with a higher frequency in DE-treated 
patients than in patients receiving SoC. The Applicant has adequately presented or discussed these 
observations, and the SmPC has adequately been updated with information regarding the posology for 
paediatric patients with renal impairment including a contraindication for use in paediatric patients with an 
eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m2. 
Commonly reported AEs comprised headache, nasopharyngitis, vomiting, nausea, and dyspepsia. 
Approximately half of the reported cases of headache was attributable to baseline conditions (e.g. headache, 
mastoiditis, intracranial hypertension, cerebral venous thrombosis, and only one case of headache was 
considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug thus, an update to include headache in the 
tabulated list of adverse reactions (paediatric population) is not considered necessary. GI-related AEs have 
correctly been included in the SmPC. Several AEs are infectious disorders however, this is expectable 
considered the population of paediatric patients who often suffered from infections. It is not considered that 
the high frequency of these disorders is due to an effect of DE on the immune system. 
Of note, the frequency of AEs assessed as being drug-related seemed to increase with increasing age, which 
seemed not be caused by a more severely ill population of adolescents being included in the studies. It is 
speculated that the reason is that the older population is better able to express their experience/observation 
of (S)AEs. If this holds true, it may be speculated that the number of (S)AEs may be under-estimated among 
the youngest age-group. 
The evaluation of immunological reactions indicates that hypersensitivity reactions were observed in a few 
patients; hypersensitivity reaction is adequately included in the tabulated list of adverse reaction as an 
uncommon AE in the paediatric population.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The size of the safety database has been agreed with the PDCO. It comprises 335 patients aged 0 – <18 
years; 30 patients aged <2 years, 80 patients aged 2 – <12 years, and 225 patients aged 12 –<18 years. Of 
these, 30% were exposed to DE for more than 42 weeks.

The safety profile known from the adult population was generally confirmed with the most significant AEs 
being bleeding events and/or risk of thrombosis. However, it is unknown if children tolerate the treatment as 
well as adults, and AEs appear to occur more often in the paediatric as compared to the adult population. 
Overall, the safety related outstanding issues are considered solved. A PASS is required to collection to 
characterise better the safety profile of dabigatran with focus on the youngest age group (0 – <2 years) 
where data are sparse. The Applicant has provided a draft synopsis for non-interventional European 
multinational multi-centre cohort study based on newly collected data of patients administered dabigatran for 
VTE treatment or prevention of recurrent VTE. This was considered overall acceptable and the protocol will be 
subject to assessment post-authorization.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the MAH 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability 
of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
The QRD Group agreed that the Applicant should comply with the established QRD template for ‘minimum 
particulars to appear on small immediate packaging units’. The Group agreed that the Applicant needed to 
rework the immediate packaging of both new pharmaceutical forms (coated granules and oral solution) in 
order to include the route of administration. The active substance should also be included on the immediate 
packaging for the oral solution. The Group agreed that the method of administration could be omitted due to 
the inclusion of the route of administration.  
In order to have additional space on the immediate packing, the Group suggested to remove the MAH name 
(not as critical as the route of administration). 
The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included in the 
Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, and translated in all languages but will appear in grey-
shaded to show that they will not be included on the printed materials.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a disease that includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary 
embolism (PE). DVT is a thrombus that forms in a deep vein, e.g. in the leg, the renal vein or in any other 
deep vein in the body. This is likely to occur when for any reason the blood is in a state of hypercoagulability, 
when there is stasis of the venous blood flow and/or when the endothelium is diseased and dysfunctional. PE 
occurs when a deep venous thrombus, or a part of it breaks free from the vein wall, travels to the lungs and 
then blocks some or all of the pulmonary blood supply. 
While the VTE pathophysiology of hypercoagulability, blood flow stasis and endothelial dysfunction are similar 
in children and adults and would be receptive to the same type of treatment, the risk factors and triggers of 
VTE in children are different from those in adults. Consequently, the epidemiology, clinical picture and 
outcomes are different in children compared to adults. 
Venous thromboembolism is a relatively rare disease in the paediatric population with an estimated 
population prevalence of about 0.6 to 1.1 per 10 000 children. Among hospitalised children, the incidence is 
with ≥58 per 10 000 paediatric admissions significantly higher than in the paediatric population overall. A 
dramatic increase of 70% has been noted over less than one decade; most likely due to better survival of 
acutely ill patients and increased use of central venous access devices. VTE is now among hospitalised 
children the second most common cause of preventable harm. 
Most paediatric VTEs constitute a secondary complication of other clinical conditions such as venous 
catheterisation, malignancy, infection/sepsis, congenital heart disease, trauma/surgery, renal disease, and 
inherited thrombophilia (e.g. Factor V Leiden mutation and others) or acquired thrombophilia. Among these, 
the most common etiologic factor for VTE in paediatric patients is the presence of a central venous access 
device. 
Paediatric VTE has a significant impact on both immediate and long-term health outcomes. Immediate 
complications of VTE include death from pulmonary embolism (PE) and non-lethal PE. Long-term 
consequences involve recurrent VTE, bleeding associated with anticoagulation therapy, and post-thrombotic 
syndrome (PTS). PTS is a burdensome condition that can lead to severe disability and poor quality of life in 
affected children. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The standard of care (SoC) for the treatment of VTE in children is unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low 
molecular weight heparin (LMWH) administered for generally 5 to 7 days followed by LMWH or a vitamin K 
antagonist (VKA). A further treatment option is the injectable factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux. There are 
frequent challenges with the therapeutic agents commonly used in children, including the need for venous 
access or subcutaneous injection, the risk of thrombocytopenia and bleeding, the need for frequent 
monitoring, variable PK of UFH, and drug-drug and drug-food interactions with VKA. These clinical challenges 
warrant the development of easier to use treatment modalities with a comparable safety and efficacy profile 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 130/142 
  
  
to current SoC treatments. DE may provide such an option as it is effective and safe for treating VTEs in 
adults. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Within the paediatric programme of DE, only trial 1160.106 was designed to evaluate the efficacy of DE 
versus a comparator while the remaining trials were single arm trials with DE. While the initial submission 
was based on an interim analysis, the final analysis has now been provided with the full data sets. 
Trial 1160.106 was a multicentre, open-label, randomised, parallel-group, active-controlled, non-inferiority 
trial of DE versus standard of care (SoC) in children from birth to less than 18 years of age. The design of 
this trial (including the definition of endpoints and the choice of SoC comparators) has been agreed with the 
PDCO. This committee has previously endorsed the principal design elements and endpoints of the trial. 
Patients had to have documented diagnosis of clinically stable VTE (e.g. DVT, PE, central line thrombosis, 
sinus vein thrombosis) per investigator judgement, initially treated (minimum of 5 to 7 days, but not longer 
than 21 days) with parenteral anticoagulation therapy, such as UFH or LMWH. Short-term pre-treatment with 
VKAs was permitted if the INR had not yet reached a therapeutic level (i.e. the INR was still <2.0). 
The trial consisted of 3 periods: a screening period, an open-label treatment period and a follow-up period. 
After consent (and assent, if applicable), the patients entered a screening period while they were completing 
their initial phase of VTE treatment. At the latest after 21 days of initial VTE treatment, patients were 
randomised in a 2:1 ratio to DE or SoC. The intended SoC (LMWH, or VKA, or fondaparinux) was required to 
be specified at randomisation. Once eligibility had been confirmed, patients received either daily DE or SoC 
for up to 3 months beyond the initial parental therapy.  
Patients in the DE group received treatment according to a treatment algorithm that was designed to target a 
dabigatran trough concentration of ≥50 to <250 ng/mL. The dosing was adjusted based on age and weight 
and specified in nomograms for each of 3 different age-appropriate dosage forms as follows: 
Patients aged ≥8 years: Age and weight adjusted dabigatran etexilate capsules. 
Patients aged <8 years or for patients who cannot take capsules even if older than 8 (but <12 years of age): 
Age and weight adjusted dabigatran etexilate coated granules. 
Patients aged <12 months: Age and weight adjusted dabigatran etexilate oral liquid formulation (OLF) or any 
other alternative age-appropriate formulation. For patients < 12 months of age, OLF is preferred over coated 
granules provided that OLF supplies are available to the site. 
DE dose could be adjusted once based on dabigatran concentrations.  
Patients assigned to take SoC were to follow the investigator’s recommendation for adequate dosing and 
administration based on the product’s locally approved label and in consideration of local treatment 
guidelines. The SoC dose was to be monitored regularly as appropriate (e.g. INR for VKAs). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The randomised controlled trial 1160.106 in children and adolescents aged 0- <18 years with documented 
diagnosis of clinically stable VTE met its primary objective of non-inferiority of 12 weeks DE oral age-
appropriate age and weight adjusted dosing algorithm versus standard of care (UFH, LMWH, fondaparinux, 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 131/142 
  
  
VKA) with respect to the combined primary endpoint of complete thrombus resolution, freedom from 
recurrent VTE and freedom for mortality related to VTE. 
In study 1160.106 of the 267 randomised patients, 81 patients (45.8%) in the dabigatran etexilate group 
and 38 patients (42.2%) in the SOC group met the criteria for the composite primary endpoint (complete 
thrombus resolution, freedom from recurrent VTE, and freedom from mortality-related VTE). The favourable 
effect in terms of non-inferiority against established SoC on this highly clinically relevant endpoint is 
important. 
Consistent results were also generally observed across subgroups: there were no significant differences in the 
treatment effect for the subgroups by age, sex, region, and presence of certain risk factors. For the 3 
different age strata, the proportions of patients that met the primary efficacy endpoint in the dabigatran 
etexilate and SOC groups, respectively, were 13/22 (59.1%) and 7/13 (53.8%) for patients from birth to 
<2 years, 21/43 (48.8%) and 12/21 (57.1%) for patients aged 2 to <12 years, and 47/112 (42.0%) and 
19/56 (33.9%) for patients aged 12 to <18 years. 
Furthermore, the adjudicated secondary safety endpoint of time to first major bleeding event showed low 
event rate in both treatment groups and no difference between the groups. Adjudicated major bleeds were 
reported for 4 patients (2.3%) in the dabigatran etexilate group and 2 patients (2.2%) in the SOC group.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There continue to be limitations of patient numbers and treatment exposures in the Birth to <2 years age-
group considering the differences in terms of immaturity of coagulation system and renal function and 
leading index VTE types compared to the older age-groups and adults.  
Furthermore, the benefit of anticoagulant therapy is less clear for catheter-related thrombosis than for other 
types of VTE. It is noted that a large proportion of subjects who did not have a symptomatic VTE were 
included in the study. 
The risk of bleeding, especially intracranial bleeding, could be different in subjects with CVST as compared to 
other types of VTE, in particular for acute CVST. 
These major issues regarding the benefit-risk assessment were discussed at a SAG meeting and also 
addressed by the Applicant in their responses during the procedure.  
The scarcity of data in the youngest age category was noted, but the existence of some evidence in this 
group was welcomed given the known difficulties in recruiting children into the clinical trials with 
anticoagulants. 
The fact that there are only limited data available supporting efficacy and safety of dabigatran by type of VTE 
subgroup, including central line thrombosis and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis was noted. The limited 
available evidence did not give rise to any particular concern and therefore the CHMP agreed dabigatran to be 
available also for treatment of children in these two conditions.  
A per-protocol analysis was not done, but a range of sensitivity analyses were done instead. Of note, one of 
these sensitivity analyses was done assuming all missing data after intercurrent events were not meeting the 
primary endpoint, i.e. a worst-case scenario, confirmed non-inferiority, which is reassuring. In addition, a 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 132/142 
  
  
 
tipping point analysis showed that in the scenario with a SoC response rate up to 20% higher than the DE 
response rate would still yield a NI test p-value within the range 0.01 – 0.05. 
The discontinuation rate in the DE arm is considered high, which is to a large extent because of inability to 
reach the therapeutic trough level with the dosing algorithm used in the trial; this is however not expected to 
constitute a problem in clinical practise as part of the inability to reach the therapeutic trough level was 
related to the sensitivity of the laboratory kit meaning the lower end of the range was set higher for technical 
reasons than was therapeutically justified. In addition, the revised dosing algorithms are modelled to address 
a lower bioavailability of the coated granules.  
The lack of data on time in therapeutic range (TTR) and a defined INR target for the VKA treatment and the 
apparent lack of monitoring of anti-factor Xa activity in LMWH treatment as part of the SoC, constitute some 
uncertainty, but it is acknowledged this reflects clinical practice and the low level of evidence of the SoC 
medications in the pediatric population. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Generally, the undesirable events known for DE in the adult population also apply to the paediatric 
population. The most significant types of AEs being bleeding events and/or worsening of VTE. However, 
overall the reported frequencies of AEs, including bleeding events, were higher in the paediatric than in the 
adult population. Bleeding events occurred in 20% of the paediatric population but are reported to occur in 
14% of the adult population. Major bleeding events occurred in 2,1% of children, with another 1% 
experiencing clinically relevant non-major bleeding events, as compared to less than 2% in adults. 
Overall 10% of the paediatric population discontinued the studies. However, the frequency of 
discontinuations was higher in phase IIb/III studies, where the treatment was planned to be 12 weeks or 
longer. In these studies, combined, the overall incidence of discontinuations was as follows, N (%): <2 
years:  16 (53.3%), 2-<12 years: 31 (41.9%), 12-<18 years: 75 (33.5%). The number of discontinuations 
was higher in the DE group (23.3%) than the SoC group (11.1%) in the controlled phase III study. Patients 
with AEs leading to discontinuation of trial treatment in the phase IIb/III trials combined was Birth to <2 
years 13.3%, 2 to <12 years 6.8%, 12 to <18 years 8.0%, total 8.2%.  
Because of the exclusion of patients with meningitis, encephalitis and intracranial abscess in the clinical study 
the experts suggested a contraindication regarding these conditions.  
However, it was challenging to provide any precise recommendation in case these inflammatory conditions 
develop during treatment with dabigatran and treatment should be considered on case-by -case basis.   
Therefore, the warning statement in section 4.4 on haemorrhagic risk has been updated with active 
meningitis, encephalitis and intracranial abscess added to the haemorrhagic risk factors, and the exclusion 
criterion on these conditions has been added to the description of study 1160.106 in section 5.1.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Children may tolerate DE less well than other regimens of SoC; In the SoC-controlled trial, the proportion of 
patients, who prematurely discontinued trial medication, was higher in the DE group (23.3%) than in the SoC 
group (11.1%).   
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 133/142 
  
  
An exact extrapolation of the safety profile from the adult population to the paediatric population is 
questioned by the generally higher frequencies of AEs, including bleeding events, in children.  
The degree of possibly deteriorated safety profile and whether it pertains to all subgroups of the paediatric 
population remain to be clarified.  
Furthermore, because there is an imbalance in mostly minor bleedings in the youngest age-groups on 
dabigatran compared to SoC in this non-inferiority study, the CHMP agreed that there is a need for post-
authorisation data collection to characterise better the safety profile of dabigatran. A draft synopsis of a PASS 
has been provided and the final protocol will be submitted for assessment post-authorisation. 
The actual impact of DE on renal and hepatic function is not known and therefore a contraindication for use in 
paediatric patients with an eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m2 has been included in the SmPC.  
Lack of understanding of the opposite bioavailability in children and adults was considered of concern as it 
could not be explained.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Overall, the trials in children and adolescents have shown that DE, except in the smallest children, has a 
comparable PKPD relationship to that in adults. The PKPD analyses have demonstrated that the measured 
clotting parameters (aPTT, dTT, and ECT) generally respond in a similar way to dabigatran exposure in 
children and adults. Lack of understanding of the opposite bioavailability in children and adults remains as no 
explanation to this was found despite extensive discussions with the Applicant. However, it is addressed in 
the revised dosing algorithms. Information has been included in the SmPC that the appropriate dosing 
algorithm should be used for each dosage form.   
Although there was a single incidence of ICH in a patient with CVST and meningitis, it was challenging to 
provide any precise recommendation in case these inflammatory conditions develop during treatment with 
dabigatran and treatment should be considered on case-by -case basis. Therefore, the warning statement in 
section 4.4 on haemorrhagic risk has been updated with active meningitis, encephalitis and intracranial 
abscess added to the haemorrhagic risk factors, and the exclusion criterion on these conditions has been 
added to the description of study 1160.106 in section 5.1. 
Following the outcome of the SAG CVS meeting held on 07 September 2020, the experts emphasised the 
need for post-authorisation data collection to characterise better the safety profile of dabigatran as the only 
way of further characterising the use of DE in very young children. The Applicant has provided a draft 
synopsis for non-interventional European multinational multi-centre cohort study based on newly collected 
data of patients administered dabigatran for VTE treatment or prevention of recurrent VTE. This was 
considered overall acceptable but the protocol of the study will be assessed by the CHMP post-authorisation.

The clinical trial comparing DE to SoC indicated that efficacy of DE was non-inferior to that of SoC in terms of 
reaching the primary endpoint of a combination of 1) Free from VTE-related mortality, 2) Free from recurrent 
events and 3) Complete thrombus resolution. Such an effect is considered clinically relevant.  
The favourable effect on VTE-related mortality, recurrent events and complete thrombus resolution is 
considered important in the proposed indication including severely ill children and adolescents, who often 
have significant co-morbidities. 
In terms of types of AEs, DE in children and adolescents does not appear to differ from what is observed in 
adults. The most significant AE being bleeding episodes. However, an apparent increased incidence of 
bleeding events in paediatric patients compared to adults need to be clarified through the PASS study. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit/risk of Pradaxa outweighs the risks in the proposed extended paediatric indication. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
In main study 1160.106 the exclusion criterion on reduced kidney function were different from the current 
contraindication in adults with reduced kidney function. This exclusion criterion has evolved during the course 
of the study as new PK data have become available. This approach was chosen to apply a conservative 
criterion knowing that new-borns renal function is immature. A contraindication of renal impairment (eGFR 
threshold in <50 mL/min/1.73 m2) in children has been added to section 4.3 of the SmPC.  
Human factors study will be performed to assess effectiveness of a training video to mitigate potential 
medication errors during the reconstitution and dosing of the DE paediatric oral solution.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Pradaxa is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of, Pradaxa:  
Pradaxa 6.25 mg/mL powder and solvent for oral solution 
Pradaxa 20 mg coated granules 
Pradaxa 30 mg coated granules 
Pradaxa 40 mg coated granules 
Pradaxa 50 mg coated granules 
Assessment report  
EMA/145360/2021 
Page 137/142 
  
  
 
Pradaxa 110 mg coated granules 
Pradaxa 150 mg coated granules 
as well as: 
Pradaxa 75 mg, 110mg and 150mg hard capsules 
 is favourable in the following indication: 
Treatment of VTE and prevention of recurrent VTE in paediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of 
age. 
For age appropriate dose forms, see section 4.2. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Pradaxa subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

Additional risk minimisation measures 
The MAH shall provide an educational pack for each therapeutic indication, targeting all physicians who are 
expected to prescribe/use Pradaxa. This educational pack is aimed at increasing awareness about the 
potential risk of bleeding during treatment with Pradaxa and providing guidance on how to manage that risk. 
The MAH must agree the content and format of the educational material, together with a communication 
plan, with the national competent authority prior to distribution of the educational pack. The educational pack 
must be available for distribution for all therapeutic indications prior to launch) in the Member State. 
The physician educational pack should contain: 
•  The Summary of Product Characteristics 
•  Prescriber Guides 
•  Patient Alert Cards 
•  A mandatory training video for Pradaxa powder and solvent for oral solution 
•  Ad hoc technical support via phone for Pradaxa powder and solvent for oral solution 
The Prescriber Guide should contain the following key safety messages: 
•  Details of populations potentially at higher risk of bleeding 
•  Information on medicinal products that are contraindicated or which should be used with caution due to 
an increased risk of bleeding and/or increased dabigatran exposure 
•  Contraindication for patients with prosthetic heart valves requiring anticoagulant treatment 
•  Dosing tables for the different dosage forms (only for paediatric VTE) 
•  Recommendation for kidney function measurement 
•  Recommendations for dose reduction in at risk populations (only for adult indications) 
•  Management of overdose situations 
•  The use of coagulation tests and their interpretation 
•  That all patients/carers should be provided with a Patient alert card and be counselled about: 
 
 
 
 
 
Signs or symptoms of bleeding and when to seek attention from a health care provider. 
Importance of treatment compliance 
Necessity to carry the Patient alert card with them at all times 
  The need to inform Health Care Professionals about all medicines the patient is currently taking 
  The need to inform Health Care Professionals that they are taking Pradaxa if they need to have 
any surgery or invasive procedure. 
•  An instruction how to take Pradaxa 
•  Recommendation that all parents/caregivers of paediatric patients administered Pradaxa powder and 
solvent for oral solution should be counselled about the reconstitution and dosing of the oral solution 
The MAH shall also provide a patient alert card in each pack of the medicinal product, the text of which is 
included in Annex III.

TALZENNA (TALAZOPARIB) RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
RMP Version number: 2.0
Data lock point for this RMP:
Clinical Trial (CT) DLP: 16 August 2022 - Post-marketing (PM) DLP: 15 October 2022
Date of final sign off: 31 October 2023
Rationale for submitting an updated RMP: 
The RMP was updated to support the planned submission of a new indication of talazoparib 
in combination with enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate 
cancer (mCRPC) based on study TALAPRO-2/C3441021 “A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-
Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of Talazoparib with Enzalutamide in Metastatic Castration-
Resistant Prostate Cancer”.
Following the receipt of the CHMP day 120 list of questions related to Procedure No. 
EMEA/H/C/004674/X/015/G, the MAH is complying with the request to reclassify the 
important potential risk of Myelodysplastic syndrome/Acute myeloid leukaemia 
(MDS/AML) as identified risk (not important) and is thus removing it from the RMP.
Following the receipt of the CHMP day 180 list of outstanding issues related to Procedure 
No. EMEA/H/C/004674/X/015/G, the MAH is complying with the request to include study 
C3441021 (TALAPRO-2) as post-authorisation efficacy study to further characterise the 
long-term efficacy of talazoparib in combination with enzalutamide for the treatment of adult 
patients with mCRPC in whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated.
Summary of significant changes in this RMP: 
 Part I: Updated to include the proposed new indication of mCRPC, the new strength of
0.1 mg hard capsules, and updated ATC code for talazoparib in line with the revised
classification of the Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors made by the
WHO and published on 17 December 2020.
 Part II
o Module SI: Updated with epidemiology for the proposed indication
o Module SII: Removal of the important potential risk of MDS/AML.
o Module SIII: Updated data up to the DLP of 16 August 2022 and inclusion of data
from studies TALAPRO-2/C3441021, TALAPRO-1/C3441006 (A Phase 2, open-
label, response rate study of talazoparib in men with DNA repair defects and
metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who previously received taxane-based
chemotherapy and progressed on at least 1 novel hormonal agent (enzalutamide

and/or abiraterone acetate/prednisone)”a and completed study 
NEOTALA/C3441020 (A Phase 2, Non-Randomized, Open-Label, Single-Arm, 
Multi-Center Study of Talazoparib for Neoadjuvant Treatment of Germline 
BRCA1/2 Mutation Patients With Early Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 
2 Negative Breast Cancer).
o Module SIV: data from clinical trials updated where applicable
o Module SV: updated up to the DLP of 15 October 2022
o Module SVII.2: reclassification of the important potential risk of MDS/AML as an 
identified risk
o Module SVII.3: with data up to the respective DLPs of each study CSRs for the CT 
data and up to the DLP of 15 October 2022 for the PM data. Removal of the 
important potential risk of MDS/AML.
o Module SVIII: Removal of the important potential risk of MDS/AML.
 Part IV was updated to include study C3441021 (TALAPRO-2) as post-authorisation 
efficacy study in order to further characterise the long-term efficacy of talazoparib in
combination with enzalutamide for the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC in 
whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated as requested in CHMP 180 list of 
outstanding issues (Procedure no. EMEA/H/C/004674/X/015/G).
 Part VI and Part VII (Annex 8) were updated to reflect all relevant changes described 
above. 
 Annex 4 was updated with the current version of the form and Annex 7 with search 
terms included in MedDRA version 25.0.
 Annex 5 was updated to include information about study C3441021 (TALAPRO-2).

Brief description of the product:
Chemical class
Potent, small-molecule inhibitor of poly adenosine diphosphate 
(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) enzymes.
Summary of mode of action
Talazoparib (TALA) is a potent inhibitor of PARP enzymes, 
PARP1 and PARP2. PARP enzymes are involved in cellular 
DNA damage response signalling pathways such as DNA repair, 
gene transcription, cell cycle regulation and cell death.  PARP 
inhibitors (PARPi) exert cytotoxic effects on cancer cells by 2 
mechanisms, inhibition of PARP catalytic activity and by PARP 
trapping, whereby PARP protein bound to a PARPi does not 
readily dissociate from a DNA lesion, thus preventing DNA 
repair, replication, and transcription and ultimately leading to 
apoptosis and/or cell death.  The potent cytotoxicity observed 
with talazoparib against multiple tumour cell lines harbouring 
mutations in the DNA Damage Repair (DDR) pathways, can be 
attributed to its inhibition of PARP catalytic activity and robust 
PARP trapping.
The combination of a PARP inhibitor and androgen receptor 
signalling inhibitor (ARSi) has been identified as a mechanism-
based interaction that expands the functional state of sensitivity 
to broader inhibition of homologous recombination DNA repair 
mechanisms. AR signalling inhibition suppresses the expression 
of homologous recombination repair genes including BRCA1, 
resulting in sensitivity to PARP inhibition. PARP1 activity has 
been shown to be required for maximal AR function and thus 
Page 9
inhibiting PARP may reduce AR signalling and increase 
sensitivity to AR signalling inhibitors. Clinical resistance to AR 
blockade is sometimes associated with co-deletion of 
retinoblastoma RB1 and BRCA2, which is in turn associated 
with sensitivity to PARP inhibition.

PART II. SAFETY SPECIFICATION
Module SI. Epidemiology of the Indications and Target Populations
Indication: locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer
Talazoparib is a potent, small-molecule inhibitor of PARP enzymes, PARP1 and PARP2. 
PARP enzymes are involved in cellular DNA damage response signalling pathways such as 
DNA repair, gene transcription, cell cycle regulation and cell death.  PARP inhibitors 
(PARPi) exert cytotoxic effects on cancer cells by two mechanisms, inhibition of PARP 
catalytic activity and by PARP trapping, whereby PARP protein bound to a PARPi does not 
readily dissociate from a DNA lesion, thus preventing DNA repair, replication, and 
transcription and ultimately leading to apoptosis and/or cell death.  The potent cytotoxicity 
observed with talazoparib against multiple tumour cell lines harbouring mutations in the 
DDR pathways, can be attributed to its inhibition of PARP catalytic activity and robust 
PARP trapping.
Talazoparib is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with germline 
(BRCA)1/2-mutations, who have HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast 
cancer. Patients should have been previously treated with an anthracycline and/or a taxane in 
the (neo)adjuvant, locally advanced or metastatic setting unless patients were not suitable for 
these treatments. 
Patients with HR-positive breast cancer should have been treated with a prior endocrine-
based therapy or be considered unsuitable for endocrine-based therapy.
Literature search strategy: The US National Library of Medicine PubMed database was 
searched for primary literature and review articles reporting the incidence, prevalence, and 
mortality estimates and demographic profile of gBRCAm HER2- locally advanced or 
metastatic breast cancerb through 25 January 2018.  Searches were confined to English 
language articles involving humans. Priority was given to data from the EU and North 
American populations; however, relevant estimates from other regions (eg, Asia) were also 
included, where appropriate.
While the indication for talazoparib is gBRCAm HER2- locally advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer, the epidemiology of gBRCAm breast cancer, has been included where 
literature on gBRCAm HER2- breast cancer was not available, as the vast majority of 
gBRCAm breast cancers are HER2-.1
Incidence
Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in women worldwide, representing 25.2% 
of new cancer cases, with nearly 1.7 million cases diagnosed in 2012.2   In the 28 States of the 
b The following search terms were used to characterize the epidemiology of gBRCAm HER2- locally 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer: (Breast Neoplasms AND (“BRCA” OR Genes, BRCA1 OR Genes, 
BRCA2) AND (“advanced” OR “metastatic”)) AND (Epidemiology OR Incidence OR Prevalence OR 
Epidemiologic Factors OR Risk Factors OR Mortality OR Morbidity)
Page 12
                                                
European Union (EU-28), there were an estimated 361,608 new cases of female breast cancer 
in 2012, corresponding to an age-adjusted annualized incidence of 80.3 per 100,000
females.3 In the US, there were an estimated 255,180 new breast cancer cases (females: 
252,710; males: 2,470) in 2017.4 The age-adjusted annualized incidence was 124.9 per 
100,000 females, representing 15% of all new cancer cases.5
No studies were identified that reported incidence rates for gBRCAm locally advanced or 
metastatic breast cancer. However, several population-based studies were identified that 
evaluated the proportion of gBRCA mutation in invasive breast cancers, without regard to 
stage.  These results are summarized in Table 1.6-12 Most of these studies were conducted in 
populations with a predisposition for gBRCAm, such as younger women, women with a 
family history of breast or ovarian cancers, or women referred for genetic testing.  In a 
Danish study of women with breast cancer who were referred to clinical genetics for testing, 
17.2% had a gBRCA mutation.8  Among populations of women enriched for genetic risk 
factors, such as early age of onset or family history, the prevalence of gBRCAm ranged from 
4.1% to 9.1%.6,7,9-12 One US study reported that 4.2% of women with breast cancer and no 
affected first or second degree relatives had gBRCAm.11  In the same study, 8.3% of women 
with breast cancer and a first or second degree relative had gBRCAm.11

The lack of robust population-based estimates of the proportions of breast cancers that are 
gBRCAm precludes estimating the incidence using annualized US or EU incidence rates.  
Prevalence:
In the EU-28, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year age-adjusted prevalence of female breast cancer in 2012 
was 147.2 per 100,000, 416.1 per 100,000, and 654.0 per 100,000, respectively.3 In the US, 
the overall estimated prevalence of breast cancer in 2014 was 3,346,387 (females: 3,327,552; 
males: 18,835).4
Prevalence rates per unit population for persons living with cancer vary substantially 
depending on the interval considered since the initial cancer diagnosis, as seen in EU-28 age 
adjusted prevalences above.  Interval-specific prevalence rates will vary substantially by
stage at diagnosis and cancer subtype. For instance, survival rates are shorter for advanced 
stage and more aggressive subtypes of breast cancer. Furthermore, prevalence rates are 
subject to period effects (as new treatments become available, survival rates for specific 
stages/subtypes may increase). Because the talazoparib target population is advanced stage
gBRCAm/HER2-negative breast cancer, and because period effects will likely affect this
subgroup of breast cancer patients due to the evolving treatment standards and recent 
anticipated approval of new targeted cancer treatments for this subgroup, estimating period 
prevalence rates for advanced stage gBRCAm/HER2-negative breast cancer, in the same way
incidence rates were estimated, is likely to be substantially flawed. As such, no prevalence
rates per unit population were estimated.

Demographics of the population in the proposed indication – age, gender, racial and/or 
ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease:
Age
Patients with gBRCAm breast cancer tend to be younger in age compared to those with non-
gBRCAm breast cancer. A few studies described in Table 1 reported the mean age at 
diagnosis or age distribution for gBRCAm breast cancer. 
In an international population-based cohort study of 3220 women with incident breast cancer 
and suspected genetic susceptibility, the mean age of diagnosis was 39.9 and 42.2 for 
gBRCA1 or gBRCA2 mutation carriers, respectively and 45.7 among women in the study 
were found to have sporadic disease.6  In a Danish study of women with breast cancer, in the 
subset found to have gBRCAm, 67.8% were aged less than 50, 16.7% between ages of 50-59, 
14.4% between ages of 60-69, and 1.1% age 70 or older.8  In France, among women of age 
less than 41 with a breast cancer diagnosis, 12.8% were gBRCA mutation carriers, in contrast 
to 5.2% of women diagnosed between the ages of 41 and 45 years.9 Among women 
diagnosed with breast cancer in the UK, 5.9% of women aged less than 36 were gBRCAm, 
as were 4.1% of women between the ages of 36-45.10  In a US study that included women 
diagnosed with gBRCAm breast cancer between the ages of 35-64, 65.6% were between the 
age of 35-44 at diagnosis, while 34.4% were between the age of 45-64.11
Gender
No studies were identified that examined the gender distribution of gBRCAm breast cancer. 
The vast majority of breast cancers occur in women and thus the majority of cancer registries
and publications report information only for female breast cancer. Therefore, in general the 
information described for the overall breast cancer incidence reflects the rates for women.
Less than 1% of all breast cancers occur among males.4
Race/Ethnicity/Ancestry
No studies were identified that reported the incidence or prevalence of gBRCAm breast 
cancer by race, ethnicity, or ancestry.  One study of patients from 5 population-based breast 
cancer registries (four US-based; one Denmark-based) found that 87.7% of women with 
unilateral invasive gBRCAm breast cancer were White, 5.5% were Hispanic White, and 
5.5% were Black.7
A study of Black and White women diagnosed with gBRCAm breast cancer between age 35 
and 64 in the US found that 60.4% were White (non-Jewish), 27.1% of women with 
gBRCAm breast cancer were Black, and 12.5% were White (Jewish), accounting for the 
sampling scheme.11
Risk Factors
Major risk factors for gBRCAm breast cancer include BRCA mutations, familial breast 
cancer, Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, and younger age. The lifetime risk of breast cancer in 
Page 15
BRCA mutation carriers ranges from 46%-87% in females and 1%-7% in males, with greater 
lifetime risks in female BRCA1 carriers and male BRCA2 carriers.13-19
Major risk factors for breast cancer in general include being female, older age, non-Hispanic 
White race/ethnicity, family history of breast cancer, being overweight/obese, moderate to 
high consumption of alcohol, low physical activity, and exposure to reproductive hormones 
(either endogenous or exogenous).20,21
The main existing treatment options:
Platinum-based chemotherapy, including cisplatin or carboplatin, has demonstrated 
anticancer activity in gBRCAm breast cancer with TTP or prolongation of progression free 
survival (PFS) ranging from 6.8 to 12 months and overall response rates ranging from 68% 
up to 89%.22-24 Overall survival in patients treated with cisplatin was 80% at 1 year, 60% at 
2 years, and 25% at 3 years with a median survival from the start of cisplatin treatment of 
30 months.22  Based on these and other findings, physicians are increasingly using platinum 
therapy early in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, as well as in the 
neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting.  However, platinum-based chemotherapy can cause substantial 
side effects, including bone marrow suppression (thrombocytopenia, leukopenia), 
nephrotoxicity, neuropathy, ototoxicity, and gastrointestinal toxicities.
Promising results were also recently reported for the PARP inhibitor olaparib in the 
OlympiAD trial in gBRCAm, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer (N=302 patients)25 and 
were the basis of olaparib’s approval by the US FDA for the treatment of patients with 
deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCAm, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who 
have previously received treatment with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or 
metastatic setting.  Patients with HR-positive breast cancer should have been treated with a 
prior endocrine therapy or be considered inappropriate for endocrine treatment.  Based on 
blinded independent central review assessments, olaparib prolonged PFS compared with 
physician’s choice of single-agent capecitabine, eribulin, or vinorelbine (HzR=0.58 [95% CI: 
0.43, 0.80] p<0.001; 7.0 vs 4.2 months).25  The response rate was higher in the olaparib arm 
(59.9% [95% CI: 52.0, 67.4]) than in the physician’s choice arm (28.8% [95% CI: 
18.3, 41.3]).  However, median duration of response was slightly shorter in the olaparib arm 
than the physician’s choice arm (6.4 vs 7.1 months).  Survival did not differ significantly 
between arms (19.3 vs 19.6 months).25  These results demonstrate proof of concept for the 
benefit of PARP inhibition in the treatment of gBRCAm metastatic breast cancer and led to 
the US approval of olaparib in January 2018 for this indication.  
The utility of PARP inhibitors for the treatment of gBRCAm cancers is further supported by 
results for olaparib and rucaparib in the treatment of patients with gBRCAm ovarian cancer 
who were treated with at least 2 or 3 prior lines of chemotherapy.26,27 Furthermore, olaparib 
and niraparib are indicated for maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent ovarian 
cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum.26,28
Several treatment options are approved for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast 
cancer, without specification of BRCA mutation status.  Endocrine therapy or aromatase 
inhibitors in combination with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor are recommended first-line therapies, 
Page 16
according to the current clinical practice guidelines from the ESMO and the National 
NCCN.23,29,30
For second-line treatment and beyond, endocrine agents are used in different combinations 
and sequences that may also include single-agent abemaciclib or chemotherapies.23,31
Combinations may include an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant with a CDK4/6 inhibitor, a 
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, or tamoxifen.23,31-33 The treatment choice 
is based on menopausal status, prior adjuvant and first-line treatments, and the toxicities and 
response to those treatments.  
Chemotherapy with single-agents or combination regimens is considered for first-line or 
subsequent therapy for patients with symptomatic visceral disease or endocrine 
resistance.23,29  Based on their efficacy/safety profiles and dosing schedules, the preferred 
chemotherapy agents are anthracyclines (doxorubicin), taxanes (paclitaxel), other 
microtubule inhibitors (eribulin, vinorelbine), and antimetabolites (capecitabine, 
gemcitabine).  Sequential single-agent chemotherapies are a recommended treatment option.  
Capecitabine and eribulin are approved in the EU for the treatment of advanced breast 
cancer.  
Combination chemotherapy is also used as it tends to have higher response rates than single 
agents, but it also causes more toxicity without increasing survival substantially.23,29
Metronomic chemotherapy is also recommended23,34.  The use of low doses of chemotherapy 
agents for short intervals can control disease with lower toxicity than standard regimens.34
Metastatic triple negative breast cancer has primarily been treated with various cytotoxic 
chemotherapy regimens for advanced/metastatic disease, ie anthracyclines and taxanes. 
However, platinum therapy is increasingly being used early in the treatment of metastatic 
breast cancer (Study 673-201, CSR Section 7.1), and carboplatin was recently added to the 
ESMO treatment guidelines for patients with BRCA-mutated TNBC.22-24 PARP inhibitors 
such as olaparib and talazoparib are recommended for patients with germline BRCA 
mutated, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer. More recently, immune-targeted therapies, 
such as pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy was approved for the treatment of 
locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic TNBC in patients whose tumours express PD-L1 
with a combined positive score (CPS) ≥10 and who have not received prior chemotherapy for 
metastatic disease.35
Overall, despite recent improvements in duration of PFS and overall survival in unselected 
populations, treatments for BRCA-mutated breast cancer remain a high unmet medical need.  
Although platinum treatment has demonstrated encouraging response rates in BRCA-mutated 
advanced cancer, it also causes substantial toxicities.  A more tolerable agent is needed.  
PARP inhibitors are a targeted therapy causing single-strand DNA damage to which 
BRCA-mutant bearing breast cancer cells with DNA repair deficiencies are more vulnerable 
than normal cells carrying 1 normally functioning BRCA allele.  Thus, PARP inhibitors may 
represent a significant advance over existing therapies that cause significant toxicities.  The 
recent approval of olaparib in the US demonstrates proof of concept for the benefit of PARP 
inhibition in the treatment of gBRCAm metastatic breast cancer.

Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity:
Important complications for patients with advanced breast cancer include thromboembolic
events and osteoporosis/bone fracture/low bone mineral density
Thromboembolic Events
A systematic review of 38 cohort studies published between 1966 and 2011 in patients
diagnosed with one of 8 cancers, including breast, found an incidence rate of hospitalization 
for VTE of 55 per 1000 PY among breast cancer patients at high risk of developing VTE, 
defined as those with metastatic disease or receiving types of high-risk treatments, and 5 per
1000 PY among breast cancer patients at average risk of VTE.  The incidence rate among 
breast cancer patients overall was 21 per 1000 PY.36 One study included in the review 
reported that the incidence rate of VTE among breast cancer patients was 2.87-times higher 
than the general population.37
The incidence of pulmonary embolism in an outpatient cohort of oncology patients 
(n=13,783) who had imaging studies from 2004-2009 in the US was 1.50% (95% CI 1.02, 
2.11) in breast cancer patients.38
Osteoporosis/Bone Fracture/Low Bone Mineral Density
Up to 80% of women with breast cancer develop “CTIBL” during treatment due to the 
consequences of depletion of endogenous oestrogen.39-41 Breast cancer patients also have a 5-
fold increased risk of fracture compared to women who are cancer-free.42,43
Mortality
The female breast cancer mortality rate in Europe (EU-28) is 15.5/100,000.3 In the US, breast 
cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in women, with a mortality rate across all 
breast cancer types of 21.2 per 100,000 women per year.5 The median age at death from
breast cancer is 68 years, and 80.7% of all breast cancer deaths occur at ages 55 and older.
The 5-year relative survival for localized disease is 98.9%, 85.2% for regional disease, 26.9% 
for distant disease.
In a large prospective cohort, the overall survival among gBRCAm compared to gBRCA 
wild type women aged ≤40 years with invasive breast cancer recruited from 127 hospitals in 
the UK did not differ (HzR 0.96, 95% CI 0.76-1.22, p=0.76).44 The 2, 5, and 10 year overall 
survival estimates for women with gBRCAm breast cancer were 97.0% (95% CI 94.5–98.4), 
83.8% (95% CI 79.3–87.5), and 73.4% (95% CI 67.4–78.5), respectively. Similarly, in a 
recent systematic review of 16 studies comprising of 10,180 individuals with breast cancer, 
gBRCAm breast cancer was not associated with worse overall survival (HzR 1.06, 95% CI 
0.84-1.34, p=0.61).45
A population-based study analysed the distribution, clinic-pathological features, survival and
excess risk of death among women diagnosed with breast cancer classified by molecular
subtype in 10 Spanish-based cancer registries.46 The 1-, 3- and 5-year relative survival rates
Page 18
were estimated as the ratio of observed survival in the study population to the survival
reported in the general population of the same age, sex, year and province. Among 3480
incident breast cancers diagnosed mainly in 2005, 2771 (79.6%) had molecular subtype data.
The 1-, 3-, and 5-year relative survival was highest among women with HR-positive, HER2-
negative breast cancer (Table 2). Similar, survival estimates for breast cancer subtypes from 
the Swiss Ticino Cancer Registry were reported.47

Important co-morbidities:
Important co-morbidities of breast cancer include: hypertension, arthritis, thyroid problem, 
hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipidemia, previous solid tumour, diabetes, GI disorders or 
GERD, heart disease, respiratory disease, psychiatric disease, and secondary cancer.48,49
An important co-morbidity for gBRCAm breast cancer is ovarian cancer.50
Proposed Indication: Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
Prostate cancer is a disease primarily of older men, with an average age at diagnosis in the 
mid-sixties and rarely diagnosed before the age of 40.51 PC typically has an indolent course, 
and many men may die from other causes first, but it is nevertheless a leading cause of death 
in many areas of the world.51
Recent treatment advances may contribute to declines or stabilization in mortality in many 
countries.51 However, treatment of active disease and its symptoms, side effects, and the high 
prevalence of comorbidities in older men with PC is burdensome – to the patient and his 
quality of life, as well as economically.52
About 77% of men with PC are diagnosed with localized disease.53 Metastatic castration-
resistant PC (mCRPC) is an advanced form of PC that does not respond to initial treatments 
and has spread beyond the prostate. mCRPC prevalence in PC has been estimated between 
1.2% and 2.1% based on two studies, one from the US and one from the UK.54 Studies on the 
epidemiology of mCRPC are scarce, in part due to varying terminology, definition, and 
disease management.55
Page 19
The combination of a PARP inhibitor and androgen receptor signalling inhibitor (ARSi) has 
been identified as a mechanism-based interaction that expands the functional state of 
sensitivity to broader inhibition of homologous recombination DNA repair mechanisms. AR 
signalling inhibition suppresses the expression of homologous recombination repair genes 
including BRCA1, resulting in sensitivity to PARP inhibition. PARP1 activity has been 
shown to be required for maximal AR function and thus inhibiting PARP may reduce AR 
signalling and increase sensitivity to AR signalling inhibitors. Clinical resistance to AR 
blockade is sometimes associated with co-deletion of retinoblastoma RB1 and BRCA2, 
which is in turn associated with sensitivity to PARP inhibition.
Summary of Literature Search Methods
A literature review was conducted to evaluate the epidemiology of mCRPC among adults in 
Europe and the US. PubMed was searched to identify published articles that contained 
potentially relevant information on the epidemiology of mCRPC from January 2002 through 
March 2022. Keywords related to incidence, prevalence, morbidity, mortality, natural 
history, risk factors and comorbidities were combined with terms representing mCRPC. 
Iterative unstructured searches of PubMed and Google were further conducted in September 
2022 on mCRPC as well as PC epidemiology. Important citations referenced within reviewed 
articles were obtained if relevant. 
For PC incidence and prevalence, the GLOBOCAN database (https://gco.iarc.fr/) and the 
NCI SEER Program database (https://seer.cancer.gov/) were queried; mCRPC data are not 
available in these resources.
This work represents a targeted, not systematic, review of the literature.
Incidence: 
In 2020, PC was the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world and the second 
most commonly diagnosed cancer among men globally.56 An estimated 1,414,259 new PC 
cases were diagnosed worldwide in 2020, representing 7.3% of all new cancer cases across 
both men and women.56 The global age-standardized incidence rate is 30.7 per 100,000 males 
annually56, and varies substantially by region, ranging from 6.3 per 100,000 males annually 
in South-Central Asia to 83.4 per 100,000 males annually in Northern Europe. 57
Europe
In 2020, PC was the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer on the European continent 
overall58, and the most commonly diagnosed cancer on the European continent among men, 
with an age-standardized incidence of 63.4 per 100,000 males59 and 198.0 per 100,000 males 
age ≥4060. Among EMA member states, PC incidence ranged from 41.5 per 100,000 males 
(129.8 per 100,000 males age ≥40) in Romania to 110.7 per 100,000 males (345.7 per 
100,000 males age ≥40) in Ireland61,62. Incidence rates have decreased or stabilized in most 
(especially high-income) European countries over the last decade.63 A decline in PSA testing 
may be at least partially responsible for this trend.63
Data on the incidence of mCPRC are scarce. One French study noted the incidence of 
mCPRC as approximately 21 per 100,000 men aged ≥40 years in 2014.64 That study found 
Page 20
that incidence of mCRPC increased with increasing age, with <1 case per 100,000 in men 
aged 40-49 years, peaking at 175 per 100,000 men aged 80-89. 
US
In 2020, PC was the third most diagnosed cancer in the US65, and the most diagnosed cancer 
in the US among men, with an age-standardized incidence of 72.0 per 100,000 males66, 224.9 
per 100,000 males age ≥40.67 There has been a decreasing incidence of PC overall by about 
6.5% per year since 2007, but an increasing incidence of later-stage PC, with an annual 
percent change measured from 2010-2017 of about 5.1%. 53,68,69
There were no studies identified that measured the incidence of mCPRC in the US.
Prevalence:
In 2020, PC was the third most prevalent cancer in the world; the worldwide 5-year limited 
duration prevalence of PC (people living with PC who were diagnosed in the last 5 years) 
was 126.1 per 100,000 males, or 4,956,901 cases, representing 9.8% of all prevalent cancer 
cases diagnosed in the previous year.70 The global 5-year limited duration prevalence varies 
substantially by region, ranging from 12.0 per 100,000 males in South-Central Asia to 735.4 
per 100,000 males in Northern Europe.71
Incidental PC studies (based on autopsies of men who died from causes other than PC) 
suggest that indolent PC is widely prevalent, found in nearly 6 of every 10 autopsies in men 
aged >79 years.72,73
Europe
In 2020, PC was the second most common cancer on the European continent overall74, and 
the most common cancer on the European continent among males, with a 5-year limited 
duration prevalence of 518.1 per 100,000 males annually, or 1,873,814 cases.75 Among EMA 
member states, 5-year limited duration PC prevalence ranged from 319.8 per 100,000 males 
(613.0 per 100,000 males age ≥40) in Romania to 905.5 per 100,000 males (1,804.1 per 
100,000 males age ≥40) in Sweden.76,77
One French study reported that mCRPC was present in 62 per 100,000 men aged ≥ 40 years,
in 2014, when age-standardized.64
US
In 2020, PC was the second most common cancer in the US overall and the most common 
cancer in the US among males, with a 5-year limited duration prevalence of 496.0 per 
100,000 males annually (1,070.9 per 100,000 males age ≥40), or 812,431 cases (812,229 
cases in males age ≥40).78,79
An analysis of US managed care claims reported that the prevalence of mCPRC was 20 per 
100,000 male enrollees in 2017.80 This prevalence is lower than other estimates, likely due to 
the inclusion of males <40 years. Among those with PC, the prevalence of mCRPC was 1140 
per 100,000 PC patients in 2017.

Demographics of the population in the proposed indication – age, gender, racial and/or
ethnic origin and risk factors for the disease:
Age
PC
PC incidence and mortality increase dramatically with age, with the average age at diagnosis 
estimated to be 66 years.51 It is rare in men under age 40, with a global age-standardized 
incidence rate of 0.06 per 100,000 males ages 0-39 years81 rising to 39.1 for those age 40 to 
64 years82, and 299.2 for those age 65+ years83. Similar age-related trends are seen in 
incidence in Europe and the US (Table 3). Additionally, prevalent indolent PC found at 
autopsy has been shown to increase with age from 5% of men aged <30 years to 59% of men 
age >79 years.72

As the risk of PC itself increases with increasing age, mCRPC is also a disease of older men. 
Observational studies of patients with mCRPC, from Europe and the US, have found that the 
mean/median age of mCRPC patients was typically in the late 60s to early 70s. 54,80,90-97
Gender
Not applicable as PC only occurs in males.
Racial and ethnic origin
PC
In reviews of studies examining incidence and prevalence rates in Black and White men in 
different countries, it is clear that the risk of PC, and risk of poor prognosis, is higher in 
Black men than in White men worldwide.98,99 However, it is not clear to what extent this is 
due to genetic mutations or environmental factors such as diet and socioeconomic status. It is 
noteworthy that the difference between Black and White Americans is greater than the 
difference between Black and White Britons, suggesting that access to care may be a factor.98
In the US during 2003-2017, the annual incidence rate of PC per 100,000 men varied 
substantially by race/ethnicity: 202.3 for Black men, 122.2 for White men, 106.0 for 
Hispanic men, 87.9 for Native men, and 67.2 for Asian and Pacific Islander men.53
Indolent PC diagnosed at autopsy is found in 29.3% of US White or European groups, 32.7% 
of US Black groups, and 13.5% of Asian groups.73 When stratified by age, the findings of a 
Page 22
racial discrepancy were more pronounced.  For example, among men aged 70-79, PC was 
found in 36% of Caucasians and 51% of Blacks.73
mCRPC
Although data on racial breakdown of patients with mCRPC in Europe in the literature are 
limited, one study in East London found that between 1997-2016, 24% of identified mCRPC 
cases occurred in Black men. In contrast, the population of Black men in the London 
boroughs which were included in the study ranged from only 6-17% in 2008-2010.100
Though, in PC, Black patients tend to have poorer outcomes than White patients, several 
studies have suggested that Black mCRPC patients may have similar or better outcomes than 
white mCRPC patients.95,100-103
Risk Factors:
PC
Advancing age, ethnicity, family history of PC, and certain genetic mutations (e.g., BRCA1 
and BRCA2) and conditions (Lynch syndrome) are the only established risk factors for 
PC.51,56 Black men have a higher risk of PC than other groups, the cause of which, however, 
may be genetic or environmental, including diet and/or socioeconomic factors.98
Other potential endogenous risk factors for PC include hormone levels, metabolic syndrome, 
gut microbiome, and oxidative stress.104,105 There have been few lifestyle and environmental 
factors for which the evidence is convincing; it has been suggested that risk factors may 
include diet (e.g., fat intake, vitamin E, vitamin D deficiency, low selenium levels, fruits, 
vegetables, micronutrients, energy intake, multigrains), environmental exposures (chemicals, 
pesticides), body size/shape (including elevated body mass index, muscle mass, and height), 
and exercise.104,105
mCRPC
Factors associated with rapid progression to metastatic disease in CRPC have been evaluated 
in a small number of studies with limited sample sizes.106-109 In an analysis of 201 men with 
progressive CRPC without detectable metastases (nmCRPC), only higher baseline PSA (>10 
ng/mL) and PSA velocity were independently associated with time to detection of first bone 
metastasis.106 Notably, these analyses were limited by the small number of covariates and 
lack of information about host characteristics. Similar results were found in another study 
which analysed data from the placebo group of a previously reported randomized controlled 
trial of atrasentan.109 In multivariate analyses, baseline PSA ≥13.1 ng/mL was associated 
with shorter time to first bone metastasis.109 Similarly, another study found bone-metastasis 
free survival to be associated with rapid alkaline phosphatase rise, and shorter PSADTs in 
men with CRPC.107
A more recent study sought to investigate the predictors of time to metastasis among 458 
men treated with ADT for nonmetastatic PC who developed CRPC within the Shared Equal 
Access Regional Cancer Hospital cohort.108 In multivariable analysis, Gleason score 8-10, 
receiving primary localized treatment, higher PSA levels at CRPC diagnosis, and PSA 
doubling time ≤6 months were independently associated with shorter time to metastasis. 
Page 23
In addition to risk factors specifically identified for mCRPC, patient-specific risk factors for 
metastasis in PC in general include younger age110, genetic factors including presence of 
BRCA1/2 variants111, obesity112, and smoking113. Males who have short intervals to PSA 
failure and rapid PSA-doubling time (PSA-DT) after prostatectomy or radiation therapy have 
significantly increased rates of distant metastases.114-116 Additional predictors of metastasis 
included: lymph node or seminal vesicle involvement with tumour, preoperative PSA level, 
or Gleason score predicted occult distant metastatic disease.114,117
The main existing treatment options:
Castration resistant prostate cancer represents a transition in the progression of prostate 
cancer, with most patients ultimately succumbing to the disease. Prior to the approval of 
NHT including enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate/prednisone, the only approved therapies 
for mCRPC were docetaxel, cabazitaxel and sipuleucel-T, which was withdrawn in the EU in 
2015. The approval of novel hormonal therapies in mCRPC for those previously treated with 
docetaxel represented a therapeutic advancement for these patients, followed shortly 
thereafter by approvals for the larger population of men with chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC. 
Based on ESMO 2020 guidelines118, the current recommended treatment for men with 
metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer include abiraterone or enzalutamide for 
asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic men with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC. Docetaxel is also 
recommended for men with mCRPC. In patients with mCRPC in the post-docetaxel setting, 
abiraterone, enzalutamide and cabazitaxel are recommended options.118  More recently, the 
EC approved Pluvicto (lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan), a targeted radioligand 
therapy. Pluvicto is approved in combination with ADT with or without AR pathway 
inhibition, for the treatment of adult patients with prostate-specific membrane antigen 
(PSMA)–positive mCRPC. These patients have previously been treated with AR pathway 
inhibition and taxane-based chemotherapy.119
The most common ARs (≥2%) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer for 
TAXOTERE (docetaxel) 75 mg/m² in combination with prednisone or include infection, 
neutropenia, anaemia, nausea, fatigue.120
Most common all grade ARs across all indications for cabazitaxel include anaemia (99.0%), 
leukopenia (93.0%), neutropenia (87.9%), thrombocytopenia (41.1%), diarrhoea (42.1%), 
fatigue (25.0%) and asthenia (15.4%). The most common grade ≥3 adverse reactions 
occurring in at least 5% of patients were neutropenia (73.1%), leukopenia (59.5%), anaemia 
(12.0%), febrile neutropenia (8.0%) and diarrhoea (4.7%).121
The most common AR’s that were observed in ≥10% of patients treated with abiraterone, and 
prednisone were peripheral oedema, hypokalaemia, hypertension, urinary tract infection, and 
alanine aminotransferase increased and/or aspartate aminotransferase increased. Other 
important adverse reactions include, cardiac disorders, hepatotoxicity, fractures, and allergic 
alveolitis.122
The most common adverse reactions for enzalutamide are asthenia/fatigue, hot flush, 
hypertension, fractures, and fall. Other important adverse reactions include ischemic heart 
Page 24
disease and seizure. Seizure occurred in 0.5% of enzalutamide-treated patients, 0.2% of 
placebo-treated patients and 0.3% in bicalutamide-treated patients. Rare cases of posterior 
reversible encephalopathy syndrome have been reported in enzalutamide treated patients.123
In patients harbouring DDR alterations, two PARP inhibitors have recently been approved in 
multiple countries based on results of phase 2 and 3 trials in this patient population. In 2020, 
olaparib was approved in the USA for patients with a deleterious or suspected deleterious 
DDR mutation who have progressed following treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone, 
and in the EU for patients with germline and/or somatic BRCA1/2 mutations who have 
progressed following prior therapy that included a new hormonal agent.124-126
There remains a significant unmet medical need for the treatment of patients with mCRPC. 
Combining PARPi with the ARsi’s provides an opportunity to treat patients with mCRPC 
independent of HRR gene mutation status.
Recently, results from a phase 3, double-blind trial of abiraterone and olaparib versus 
abiraterone and placebo in patients with mCRPC in the first-line setting were reported.127
Patients were enrolled regardless of HRR gene mutation (HRRm) status. The primary end 
point was imaging-based progression-free survival (ibPFS) by investigator assessment. 
Overall survival was among the secondary end points.
Results from the planned primary analysis at the first data cutoff demonstrated that median 
rPFS was significantly longer in the abiraterone and olaparib arm than in the abiraterone and 
placebo arm (24.8 vs. 16.6 months; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.81; P<0.001) and was 
consistent with blinded independent central review (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.74). At this 
data cutoff, overall survival data were immature (28.6% maturity; hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 
0.66 to 1.12; P=0.29). Most common ARs (≥20%) were anemia, fatigue/asthenia, and nausea.
The safety profile of olaparib and abiraterone was consistent with the known safety profiles 
of the individual drugs.
Based on this data, on 16 December 2022 the European Commission approved Lynparza 
(olaparib) in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment 
of adult patients with mCRPC in whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated.128
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity:
PC
Disease progression
Despite PC affecting millions of men globally each year, relatively little is known about its 
etiology.56 Prognosis varies widely with age, ethnicity, genetic background, and stage of 
progression, and is influenced by the histopathological, anatomical, and molecular profile of 
the tumour and the health condition of the patient.129
Page 25
In the US, about three-quarters of PC patients are first diagnosed with non-metastatic 
localized stage PC.53 For these men, living with PC typically involves active surveillance 
(“watchful waiting”) and local ablation with or without antihormonal treatment. The 5-year 
overall survival of patients with localized disease is 60–99%.129
However, others will experience aggressive disease that is unresponsive to presently 
available treatments; with current technology, it is not possible to reliably distinguish mild 
versus aggressive tumours.129 Survival with distant stage prostate cancer has improved over 
time, but only about one third of men survive 5 years after diagnosis, with notable
disparities by age and race/ethnicity.53
Common sites of metastatic spread in advanced prostate cancer include locoregional spread 
to lymph nodes (99%) and bone (84%); spread to distant lymph nodes (10.6%), viscera (lung 
and liver) (~10%) and the brain and dura (<2%) is associated with poorer survival. 129
Mortality
Mortality among patients with PC (age-standardized to the world) occurred at a rate of 7.7 
per 100,000 in 2020, ranging from 3.1 per 100,000 in South-Central Asia to 27.9 per 100,000 
in the Caribbean56. Among EMA member states, the PC mortality rate (age-standardized to 
the world) was 10.2 per 100,000 males (31.0 per 100,000 males age ≥40 years) and ranged 
from 6.1 per 100,000 males (19.1 per 100,000 males age ≥40 years) in Italy to 22.4 per 
100,000 males (70.0 per 100,000 in males age ≥40 years) in Estonia.130,131 Note that using the 
age distribution of Europe as the standard results in a mortality rate that appears substantially 
higher (36.4 per 100,000 males across EMA member states).130
mCRPC
Disease progression
A systematic review estimated that approximately 10-20% of PC patients advance to CRPC 
within about 5 years of diagnosis.55 Further, this review found that about 84% of patients 
have metastases at the time of CRPC diagnosis; among those who do not, approximately one-
third will develop bone metastases within 2 years. A separate study found that approximately 
60% of men with non-metastatic CRPC will develop metastases within 5 years of CRPC 
diagnosis, with most occurring within the first 3 years.108 Common sites of metastases in 
mCRPC include (in order of frequency): bone, lymph nodes, lung, and liver.108,132
Once PC progresses to mCRPC it cannot be cured and current treatments are considered
largely palliative, with some providing a modest additional 3–6-month survival 
benefit.80,133 In a 2014 observational study conducted across Europe and Australia that sought 
to evaluate treatment patterns among mCRPC patients, 35% of mCRPC patients proceeded 
straight to palliative care, while 43% of patients pursued hormone therapy manipulations for 
several weeks prior to initiating mCRPC-specific treatment.134 Similarly, in a 2021 
observational study out of the US that sought to evaluate real world treatment patterns among 
mCRPC patients, 16.1% of mCRPC patients did not pursue therapy aimed at improving 
survival, and approximately 50% of patients did not receive subsequent treatment after 
failing their first line of treatment.97
Page 26
Mortality
A model of all-cause mortality among US men with mCRPC estimates annual all-cause 
mortality at 55.3%, and attributes 90% of deaths in mCRPC patients to PC.135 Until 2004, 
care for mCRPC was exclusively palliative; new therapies introduced since that time have 
offered modest survival benefit.80 Reported OS in the literature following mCRPC diagnosis 
ranged from 11 to 31 months and varied by time of study and treatments received by patients, 
with survival appearing to be slightly higher in more recent studies.96,102,136-138
While all mCRPC is considered advanced and carries a poor prognosis, several patient and 
tumour characteristics at the time of mCRPC diagnosis are predictive of poorer 
survival.54,97,135 Patient characteristics associated with worse survival across multiple studies 
include non-black race 95,100-102,136,137, older age at diagnosis 94,137, higher PSA at diagnosis 
94,96,137, higher Gleason or ECOG performance score at diagnosis 94,137,139, and a greater 
number of bone metastases 96,137. Other patient characteristics associated with worse survival 
in individual studies include higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at diagnosis 137, higher 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at diagnosis 137, lower haemoglobin at diagnosis 137, lower body 
weight at diagnosis 137, lymph node only metastases 137, and prior treatment with taxane-
based chemotherapy, abiraterone, or enzalutamide.137
Defects in DNA repair, including alterations in the expression of genes involved in 
homologous recombination repair are estimated to occur in about 25% of mCRPC patients 140
and have also been associated with worse survival.141
Important co-morbidities:
Given the older age at diagnosis of PC and mCRPC, most men with mCRPC have one or 
more comorbidities, with hypertension being the most common 80,92,101,138,142. Table 4 lists 
several comorbidities associated with mCRPC, as highlighted in the literature.

Module SII. Non-Clinical Part of the Safety Specification
The non-clinical toxicologic profile of talazoparib has been characterized through the 
conduct of studies including repeat-dose toxicity in rat and dog of ≤13-week duration, 
genetic toxicity (in vitro and in vivo), embryofoetal development in rat, and phototoxicity, in 
accordance with the ICHS9 guidelines.  The rat and dog were the selected rodent and 
nonrodent species, respectively for the toxicology studies based on their suitable 
pharmacokinetic profiles, a comparable in vitro metabolic stability profile in liver 
microsomes, and representation of the metabolic and clearance pathways that are expected in 
humans.  There were no talazoparib-related effects on respiratory or CNS parameters 
following a single oral administration to rat in the safety pharmacology studies, or on 
cardiovascular parameters (hERG assessment and ECG evaluations following repeat-dose 
administration to dog).  No ocular findings were observed with talazoparib in rat or dog in 
the repeat dose studies and talazoparib is not phototoxic in vivo.  Based on the cumulative 
evaluation of the toxicology profile of talazoparib, the primary talazoparib-related target 
organ findings in both rat and dog include effects on the haematolymphopoietic system, the 
male reproductive system, and the gastrointestinal system.  Additional target organ findings 
observed in rat only include findings in the female reproductive system and liver.  
Page 28
Talazoparib is clastogenic in vitro in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, in cancer cell 
lines and in vivo in rat. Talazoparib caused fetotoxicity in an embryofoetal development 
study in rat.
Table 5 describes the non-clinical key safety findings and relevance to human usage.

Relevance to Human Usage
Please see Section SVII.1.1, Risks not Considered 
Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety 
Concerns in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
(Myelosuppression).
Please see Section SVII.3.1, Reproductive and 
developmental toxicity (Important Potential Risk).
Toxicity
Haematolymphopoietic Toxicity
In repeat dose studies in rats and dogs, there were 
dose-dependent findings of pancytopenia and decreased 
red blood cell mass, reticulocytes, and platelets 
correlated microscopically with bone marrow 
hypocellularity (femur and sternum) and depletion of 
lymphoid tissue in multiple organs (gut-associated 
lymphatic tissue, lymph nodes, and spleen).  
Septicaemia resulting in moribundity, and death was 
considered secondary to severe haematolymphopoietic 
toxicities. 
Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity 
In an embryo-foetal development study in pregnant rats, 
talazoparib was administered orally at 0, 0.015, 0.05, 
and 0.15 mg/kg/day.  At 0.15 mg/kg/day, talazoparib 
caused moribundity/mortality in 32% of the dams.  At 
≥0.05 mg/kg/day, there were no live foetuses and at 
0.015 mg/kg/day, 91% of the litters were resorbed.  In 
the 9% of foetuses that survived at 0.015 mg/kg/day, 
talazoparib caused foetal malformations and structural 
variations.  At the lowest adverse effect level 
(0.015 mg/kg/day), the unbound maternal Cmax (0.39 
ng/mL) and AUC24 (4.97 ng•h/mL) exposures on 
gestation day 17 are approximately 0.1 -fold the 
relevant exposure at the recommended dose in patients 
of 1 mg once daily.  
Individual focal necrotic changes of ovarian follicular 
atresia were seen in rat repeat dose studies.
Atrophy and/or degenerative changes in testes, 
epididymis, and seminiferous tubules (with reduced 
sperm) were observed in rat and dog studies at high 
doses.  Duration of changes in reproductive organs was 
generally tied to specific cell types and regions 
(e.g., seminiferous tubules).
Page 29
Relevance to Human Usage
Talazoparib was clastogenic in in vitro 
chromosomal aberration and in vivo micronucleus 
assays, indicating potential for genotoxicity in 
humans.  Please see Section SVII.3.1, Second 
Primary Malignancies (other than MDS/AML) 
(Important Potential Risks).
Table 5. Key Safety Findings and Relevance to Human Usage
Key Safety findings from Non-clinical Studies
Genotoxicity (Clastogenicity)
In an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human 
peripheral blood lymphocytes, talazoparib was 
clastogenic for the induction of structural chromosome 
aberrations in both the non-activated and S9-activated 
assays at ≥125 µg/mL when evaluated after 4-hour 
exposure, and at ≥2.5 µg/mL in the non-activated assay 
when evaluated after 20-hour exposure.  In another 
study in Sprague Dawley rats, a single dose of 
talazoparib at 150, 300, or 600 mg/kg induced 
statistically significant dose-dependent increase in the 
incidence of micro nucleated polychromatic 
erythrocytes at all talazoparib doses indicating positive 
in vivo clastogenic activity and/or disruption of the 
mitotic apparatus.  
Other toxicity-related information or data 
GI Toxicity
In a repeat dose study in rats, GI findings noted at 
≥1 mg/kg/day included increased apoptosis in the 
stomach and duodenum, reversible villous atrophy, and 
increased apoptosis throughout the various segments of 
the GI tract (small intestine, duodenum, jejunum, and 
ileum); at 3 mg/kg/day, irreversible toxicity included 
enteropathy and villous atrophy resulting in mortality.  
In a repeat dose study in dogs, GI findings included 
increased apoptosis in sections of small intestine at 
≥0.01 mg/kg/day and macroscopic red GI 
discolouration (potential bleeding) at 0.1 mg/kg/day.
Hepatic Toxicity
Individual hepatocyte necrosis of liver was seen in rat 
repeat dose studies.
AUC24 = Area under the curve over 24 hours; Cmax = maximum plasma concentration
Gastrointestinal ADRs reported in clinical studies 
were considered to not impact the benefit-risk of 
talazoparib or the clinical consequences were 
considered to be acceptable in relation to the 
severity of the indication.  See Section SVII.1.1, 
Risks not Considered Important for Inclusion in 
the List of Safety Concerns in the RMP.  
Hepatotoxicity ADRs reported in clinical studies 
were considered to not impact the benefit-risk of 
talazoparib.

received talazoparib in combination with enzalutamide for mCRPC. The starting talazoparib 
dose was reduced to 0.5 mg QD in combination with enzalutamide in order to account for the 
observed interaction with enzalutamide and maintain similar talazoparib exposure to that 
achieved with 1 mg QD monotherapy.  Exposure data from this study are presented in

Module SIV. Populations Not Studied in Clinical Trials
SIV.1. Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies Within the Development 
Programme
There has been limited exposure of special populations to talazoparib and no epidemiologic 
studies have been conducted in pregnant/lactating women, and specific subpopulations that 
were excluded from the clinical trial development programme. 
Following is the important exclusion criterion in the pivotal clinical studies across the 
development programme:
Page 34
Patients with Hypersensitivity to Talazoparib
Reason for exclusion: This was included as a conservative measure upon initiation of the 
talazoparib development program to avoid hypersensitivity reactions if patients were 
identified with known hypersensitivity to talazoparib.
Is it considered to be included as Missing Information? No
Rationale: No cases of patients developing hypersensitivity to talazoparib have been 
identified.  However, hypersensitivity reactions are unpredictable, regardless of the allergen, 
and consistent with the development program exclusion criteria, the talazoparib SmPC
includes a contraindication for patients with hypersensitivity to talazoparib or any excipient, 
which is consistent with the Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics.
SIV.2. Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial Development 
Programmes
The clinical development programme is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions 
such as rare adverse reactions, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those caused by 
prolonged or cumulative exposure.
Table 12 presents these limitations of ADR detection in the talazoparib clinical trial 
development programme.
Table 12. Limitations of Adverse Drug Reaction Detection
Discussion of implications on target 
population
Uncommon events may be identified, 
however, rare ADRs may have not been 
observed in clinical trials.
Findings from the exposure-efficacy 
analysis support the dosing of talazoparib 
at the 1 mg once daily dose to maximize 
PFS prolongation. Additionally, results 
from the exploration of the relationships 
between talazoparib plasma exposure and 
Grade 3 or higher AEs of anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia 
support the proposed dose modification 
algorithm for the management of ADRs. 
Ability to detect 
ADRs
Uncommon ADRs
ADRs that are dose 
related
Limitation of trial Programme
As of 16 August 2022, 690 participants
received talazoparib as a single agent at 1 
mg orally once daily.
No dedicated studies were conducted to 
establish dose proportionality of ADRs.  
However, the relationships between 
talazoparib plasma exposure and Grade 3 
or higher AEs of anaemia, 
thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia were 
explored using pooled data from 
Studies 673-301 and 673-201.  Higher 
talazoparib exposure at 1 mg once daily, 
as measured by time varying average 
talazoparib concentration (Cavg,t) was 
associated with higher risk of Grade 3 or 
higher anaemia and thrombocytopenia. A 
trend for association between higher 
Cavg,t and Grade 3 or higher neutropenia 
was observed although the relationship 
was not statistically significant. 
Additionally, the relationship between 
exposure and Progression Free Survival 
(PFS was explored in Study 673-301. 
Page 35
Table 12. Limitations of Adverse Drug Reaction Detection

Limitation of trial Programme
Discussion of implications on target 
population
Due to prolonged 
exposure
Which have a long 
latency
Higher talazoparib exposure at 1 mg 
once daily was associated with longer 
PFS.
At the time of the final OS analysis (30 
September 2019 data cut-off date), the 
median follow-up time in the talazoparib 
arm was 44.9 months (95% CI: 37.9, 
47.0) and in the PCT arm was 36.8 
months (95% CI: 34.3, 43.0). A total of 
216 (75.3%) patients in the talazoparib 
arm and 108 (75.0%) patients in the PCT 
arm were known to have died at the data
cut-off. 
There are no apparent new specific 
toxicities that resulted from extended 
exposure to talazoparib; however, this 
has not been formally examined, mainly
due to the small number of patients 
treated for prolonged periods of time.
Since the period of observation for
patients treated with talazoparib will 
often be curtailed by death or 
confounded by participation in 
subsequent clinical trials, the information 
regarding potential AEs with a long 
latency is limited.
Any additional data on long-term 
treatment will be evaluated when will 
become available from ongoing clinical 
trials.
Since it is unknown if events with 
prolonged latency occur, the impact of 
any such events cannot be assessed yet.
SIV.3. Limitations in Respect to Populations Typically Under-Represented in Clinical 
Trial Development Programmes
Table 13 lists the patient populations that have been under-represented in the talazoparib 
clinical development programme.

Given the known clastogenic effects of talazoparib in animal studies, 
pregnant or breastfeeding women were not enrolled in talazoparib clinical 
trials.  No data on pregnant women using talazoparib are available to date.  
No studies have been conducted in animals or humans to date to assess 
the effect of talazoparib on milk production, talazoparib presence in

talazoparib is excreted in human milk.
Patients with relevant 
comorbidities:

Patients with hepatic
impairment
All studies excluded patients with Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or 
Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) >2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), or 
if there were liver metastases involvement > 5.0 x ULN or with total 
bilirubin >1.5 x ULN, or 3.0 x ULN for Gilbert’s syndrome.
Talazoparib monotherapy:
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 490 
patients (372 patients with normal liver function and 118 patients with 
mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN, or total 
bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 x ULN and any AST), no difference in the apparent 
clearance (CL/F) of talazoparib was observed in patients with mild 
hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function. 
No dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild hepatic 
impairment.
Talazoparib in Combination with Enzalutamide:
A POPPK analysis was performed using data from 412 mCRPC 
participants treated with talazoparib in combination with enzalutamide 
that included 40 participants had mild hepatic impairment that indicated 
that there was no obvious effect of mild hepatic impairment on 
talazoparib PK parameters as determined by visual inspection of graphical 
plots of individual ETAs by liver function category.
Study MDV3800-02 was an ongoing Phase 1, open-label study to 
evaluate the PK and safety of daily oral doses of 0.5 mg talazoparib in 
patients with solid tumours and normal liver function or varying degrees 
of hepatic impairment.
Thirty-eight (38) patients were enrolled; 37 had at least one PK 
concentration, among which 17 were evaluable for NCA. Population PK 
analysis using plasma PK data from all 37 patients who had PK data 
indicated that there is no significant impact of hepatic function on 
apparent clearance (CL/F) of talazoparib. NCA of data from 17 PK-
evaluable patients showed no clear trend for increase in exposure on Day 
22 with worsening hepatic function. Talazoparib protein binding was 
comparable in patients with varying hepatic function. Talazoparib was 
generally well tolerated, and the safety profile observed in this study was 
consistent with the known safety profile of the drug.
Population PK analysis using data from this PK trial indicated that mild, 
moderate, or severe hepatic impairment had no significant impact on the

Exposure
PK of talazoparib and based on the results of population PK analysis and 
totality of the data, no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with 
various degrees of hepatic impairment. 

Patients with renal
impairment
Normal renal function was defined as a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of ≥90 
mL/min, mild renal impairment 60-89 mL/min, moderate renal 
impairment 30-59 mL/min, and severe renal impairment ≤29 mL/min. 
Patients with severe renal impairment were excluded from all studies. 
Talazoparib monotherapy:
Among patients with advanced breast cancer who received talazoparib 1 
mg once daily, there were 157 patients with mild renal impairment, 36 
patients with moderate renal impairment, and 1 patient with severe renal 
impairment treated with talazoparib. Among patients in the talazoparib 
arm in Study 673-301, there were 79 patients with mild renal impairment 
and 12 patients with moderate renal impairment.
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 490 
patients (324 patients with normal renal function, 132 patients with mild 
renal impairment, 33 patients with moderate renal impairment, and 1 
patient with severe renal impairment), patients with mild and moderate 
renal impairment had 14.4% and 37.1% lower CL/F compared to patients 
with normal renal function. The impact of severe renal impairment on 
CL/F could not be concluded due to limited number of severe renal 
impairment patients. Based on a summary of all treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) by renal function category for patients receiving 
talazoparib 1 mg once daily, AE frequencies were generally comparable 
between patients with mild renal impairment and patients with normal 
renal function, but AE frequencies were higher among patients with 
moderate renal impairment compared with those who had normal renal 
function.
Study MDV3800-01 was conducted to investigate the effect of mild, 
moderate, and severe renal impairment on the PK of talazoparib following 
daily oral dosing of 0.5 mg talazoparib for 22 days in patients with 
advanced solid tumours.  Following multiple daily oral 0.5 mg doses of 
talazoparib for 22 days, AUC0-24 increased by 12.2%, 43.0%, and 163.3% 
and Cmax increased by 11.1%, 31.6%, and 89.3% in patients with mild, 
moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, relative to patients 
with normal renal function as assessed by ANOVA analyses performed 
comparing the pre-defined categorical renal function groups defined by 
BSA-normalized eGFR. Linear regression models generated to describe 
the relationship between natural log-transformed AUC0-24 following 
multiple daily doses of talazoparib and continuous renal function 
assessments (BSA-normalized eGFR, absolute eGFR, and CrCl) predict 
increases in talazoparib exposure (AUC0-24) of approximately 16.2%, 
56.8% and 96.4% for patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal 
impairment, respectively, relative to patients with normal renal function. 
Page 38
Table 13. Exposure of special populations included or not in clinical trial 
development programmes
Type of special population (in 
pre-authorisation clinical 
development programme)
Exposure
Overall, there were no notable differences in the TEAE profile between 
patients with normal renal function and patients with mild, moderate, or 
severe renal impairment.  In addition, there were no unexpected safety 
findings identified as the reported TEAEs were consistent with the 
diseases under study and with the known safety profile associated with 
talazoparib treatment.
No dose adjustments are required for patients with mild renal impairment 
(60 mL/min ≤ CrCl < 90 mL/min). For patients with moderate renal 
impairment (30 mL/min ≤ CrCl < 60 mL/min), the dose should be 
reduced from 1 mg once daily to 0.75 mg once daily. For patients with 
severe renal impairment (15 mL/min≤ CrCl < 30 mL/min), the talazoparib 
dose should be reduced to 0.5 mg once daily.
Talazoparib in Combination with Enzalutamide:
Based on a POPPK analysis where renal function was modelled as a 
continuous covariate that included 412 mCRPC participants who received 
talazoparib co-administered with enzalutamide, where 152 participants 
had mild renal impairment (60 mL/min≤ CLcr <90 mL/min), 72 
participants had moderate renal impairment (30 mL/min≤ CLcr 
<60 mL/min), and 2 participants had severe renal impairment 
(CLcr <30 mL/min), talazoparib CL/F was decreased by 8.0%, 27.1%, 
and 46.7% in participants with mild, moderate, and severe renal 
impairment, corresponding to increases of 9%, 37%, and 88% in AUC, 
respectively, when compared to participants with normal renal function. 
To further confirm the consistency in the magnitude of impact of renal 
impairment on talazoparib PK in the study C3441021 dataset where 
talazoparib is used in combination with enzalutamide and when used in 
monotherapy therapy setting, an additional POPPK analysis was 
conducted by modeling renal function as a categorical covariate. This 
additional analysis was also consistent with results of the monotherapy 
categorical covariate assessment; mild and moderate renal impairment 
participants had 18.3% and 33.9% lower CL0/F compared to that of 
participants with normal renal function. Due to the limited number of 
severe renal impairment participants (only 2 participants), the impact of 
severe renal impairment on CL0/F could not be concluded with this 
analysis method.
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild renal 
impairment (60 mL/min≤ CLcr <90 mL/min). For patients with moderate 
renal impairment (30 mL/min≤ CLcr <60 mL/min), the recommended 
dose of talazoparib is 0.35 mg QD in combination with enzalutamide. For 
patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min), the 
recommended dose of talazoparib is 0.25 mg QD in combination with 
enzalutamide.

Talazoparib has been studied in normal healthy volunteers and in patients 
with advanced breast cancer as well as in other advanced cancer patients.  
Not included in the clinical development programme.
Talazoparib Monotherapy:
Data from a drug-drug interaction study in patients with advanced solid 
tumours indicated that coadministration of multiple daily doses of 
itraconazole 100 mg twice daily with a single 0.5 mg talazoparib dose 
increased talazoparib AUCinf and Cmax by approximately 56% and 40%, 
respectively, relative to a single 0.5 mg talazoparib dose administered 
alone. Population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 490 patients 
(21 patients received strong P-gp inhibitors during the treatment period), 
also showed that the relative bioavailability of talazoparib was 44.7% 
higher when co-administered with a strong P-gp inhibitor. A dose 
reduction from 1 mg once daily to 0.75 mg once daily is required for 
patients while receiving strong P-gp inhibitors. If the strong P-gp 
inhibitor is discontinued, the talazoparib dose should be increased (after 
3–5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the initiation of 
the strong P-gp inhibitor. 
Talazoparib in Combination with Enzalutamide:
The effect of concomitant administration of potent P-gp inhibitors on 
talazoparib exposure when talazoparib is given in combination with 
enzalutamide has not been studied. If concomitant use of these potent P-
gp inhibitors cannot be avoided when talazoparib is given in combination 
with enzalutamide, monitor patients for potential increased adverse 
reactions.
Data from a drug-drug interaction study in patients with advanced solid 
tumours (Study MDV3800-04) indicated that coadministration of 
multiple daily doses of a P-gp inducer, rifampin 600 mg, with a single 1 
mg dose of talazoparib increased talazoparib Cmax by approximately 37% 
whereas AUCinf was not affected relative to a single 1 mg talazoparib dose 
administered alone. No dose adjustments are required for P-gp inducers.
Population with relevant 
different ethnic origin
Talazoparib Monotherapy:
Most patients in both the talazoparib arm (66.9%) and the PCT arm 
(75.0%) of the pivotal study (Study 673-301) were White. In the 
talazoparib arm, 10.8% patients were Asian, 4.2% patients were Black, 
and 1.7% patients were classified as “Other” race.  
Most patients in both the talazoparib arm (73.1%) and the PCT arm 
(77.0%) of the pivotal study (Study 673-301) had an ethnicity reported as 
Page 40

Exposure
Not Hispanic or Latino. In the talazoparib arm 10.8% of patients were 
Hispanic or Latino, and ethnicity was not reported for 16.1% of patients.
Population PK analysis which included 41 Asian and 449 non-Asian 
patients indicated that talazoparib exposure was 19.2% lower in Asian 
patients compared to non-Asian patients at the same dosage. The effect of 
race on talazoparib exposure was not considered clinically relevant. No 
dose adjustments based on ethnicity are required.
Talazoparib in Combination with Enzalutamide:
In study C3441021, there were 811 patients in the data set, consisting of
pooled data from part 1 and part 2 (cohort 1) of the study, treated with 
enzalutamide in combination with either placebo or talazoparib. Out of 
the 811 patients, 412 were treated with talazoparib. Of the 412 pts that 
received talazoparib, 64.2% of patients were White, 30% were Asian and 
2.7% were Black. Population PK modelling of talazoparib in combination 
with enzalutamide demonstrated that the effects of RACE2 (Asian versus 
non-Asian) on CL0/F of talazoparib were not significant.
Not included in the clinical development programme.
Subpopulations carrying known 
and relevant genetic

Children
The safety and efficacy of talazoparib in children and adolescents 
<18 years of age have not been established.
Male Patients
Talazoparib Monotherapy
Based on a population pharmacokinetics analysis which included 53 male 
and 437 female patients, no clinically relevant effect of gender on 
talazoparib exposure was identified. No dose adjustments based on 
gender are required.
Talazoparib in combination with Enzalutamide:
All participants treated with talazoparib in combination with 
enzalutamide in study C3441021 were male, and thus the impact of sex 
on talazoparib PK in this setting could not be assessed.

Module SV. Post-Authorisation Experience
SV.1. Post-Authorisation Exposure
SV.1.1. Method Used to Calculate Exposure
The estimated cumulative patient exposure is based on sales data provided by IQVIAc from 
01 April 2010 through the first quarter of 2022, with data extrapolated to 15 October 2022, 
and SPP data.  The sales data from 01 April 2022 to 15 October 2022 are extrapolated by 
taking average of sales of previous 2 quarters.  
It should be noted that the patient exposure to talazoparib has been estimated in terms of 
number of patients and not in patient-years because of the absence of average dosage 
information; to obtain the ratio of SU per patient, SPP data have been used, which provide 
number of patients exposed to talazoparib during the cumulative period.
Patients in SPP data have been calculated by using gross up factor of 1.3 which assumes that 
available data represents 74.5% of all channels/overseas sales.  
Non-US patients are calculated by applying factor of US sales (calculated from IQVIA data) 
to non-US sales (calculated from IQVIA data) on US patients (available from SPP data).
SV.1.2. Exposure
It is estimated that 3078 patients were exposed to talazoparib worldwide since the product 
was first approved.  The exposure to talazoparib in the US is estimated to be 1088 patients, 
and outside the US is estimated to be 1990 patients.
Module SVI. Additional EU Requirements for the Safety Specification
Potential for misuse for illegal purposes
Talazoparib does not have characteristics that would make it attractive for use for illegal 
purposes.  
Module SVII. Identified and Potential Risks
SVII.1. Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP Submission
The safety concerns included in the initial RMP are presented in Table 14.
c Of note, IQVIA data should not be regarded as complete sales information.  Some countries where 
talazoparib is sold may not be covered by IQVIA.  In addition, IQVIA requires a minimum threshold of sales 
after which it will start tracking a product; thus, data from countries where the product does not have sizeable 
sales would not be captured by IQVIA.  Furthermore, IQVIA does not capture retail sales data and hospital data 
in all countries.  Therefore, the sales volumes obtained through the use of IQVIA are likely to result in a large 
underestimate of the actual distributed product.

SVII.1.1. Risks not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns 
in the RMP
Reason for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in 
the RMP:
1) Adverse reactions with clinical consequences, even serious, but occurring with a low
frequency, not impacting public health, and considered to be acceptable in relation to the
severity of the indication treated: Vomiting, Abdominal pain, Nausea, Headache, Fatigue,
Dizziness
2) Known risks for the class of PARP inhibitors that require no further characterisation and
are followed up via routine pharmacovigilance namely through signal detection and
adverse reaction reporting collection, evaluation and assessment, and for which the risk
minimisation messages in the SmPC are anticipated to be adhered to by prescribers:
Myelosuppression (including Anaemia, Neutropenia, Thrombocytopenia).
3) Known risks that do not impact the risk-benefit profile: Decreased appetite, Diarrhoea,
Dyspepsia, Stomatitis, Dysgeusia, Alopecia.
SVII.1.2. Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in 
the RMP
The risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP were
characterized based on two cohorts of pooled safety data:
 Patients who received talazoparib at the proposed starting dose of 1 mg once daily:
Data from all patients with breast cancer and other solid tumours who received
talazoparib monotherapy at 1 mg once daily in 5 company sponsored phase I-III clinical
studies: PRP-001, 673-201, 673-301, MDV3800-13, and MDV3800-14 (494 patients).
 Patients who received talazoparib at doses other than 1 mg once daily: Since the
frequencies of some important potential risks are low, pooled safety data from all patients
with breast cancer and other solid tumours who received talazoparib monotherapy at
Page 43
doses other than 1 mg once daily in 2 company sponsored phase I clinical studies (PRP-
001 [N=33], MDV3800-13 [N=34]d) were also assessed (67 patients).
Important Identified Risk: none
Important Potential Risk 1: Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukaemia
Myelodysplastic syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (MDS/AML) have been reported in 
patients who received PARP inhibitors. In the pivotal randomized breast cancer study, 
MDS/AML was not reported for any patients who received talazoparib and in 1 out of 126 
(0.8%) patients who received chemotherapy. Overall, MDS/AML has been reported in 1 out 
of 561d (0.2%) solid tumour patients treated at any dose with talazoparib in clinical studies.
Risk-benefit impact: MDS/AML are serious, life-threatening conditions. Currently, the 
impact to the overall risk-benefit balance is not known because a causal relationship between 
talazoparib and MDS/AML has not been established.   Cases of MDS/AML reported in the 
continuing development talazoparib programme and in post-marketing surveillance will be 
continually reviewed and patient monitoring guidance will be provided to healthcare 
professionals via the SmPC to mitigate this important potential risk.
Important Potential Risk 2: Second Primary Malignancies (other than MDS/AML)
Potential second primary malignancies (other than MDS/AML) have been reported in 6 
patients (7 events) who received talazoparib at the proposed starting dose of 1 mg once daily 
and no patients who received talazoparib at doses other than 1 mg once daily.  In comparison, 
one case of a potential second primary malignancy (other than MDS/AML) was reported in 
the PCT arm (N=126) of Study 673-301 (EMBRACA).
Risk-benefit impact: The 7 newly occurring primary malignancies reported amongst 6 
patients taking talazoparib included Squamous cell carcinoma of skin (2), Basal cell 
carcinoma, Glioblastoma multiforme, Intraductal proliferative breast lesion, Neoplasm skin, 
Ovarian neoplasm (1 each).  Other risk factors and/or unlikely temporal relationships were 
present in most cases and in all cases, the events were considered by Investigators to be 
unrelated to talazoparib.  Although newly occurring malignancies can be serious life-
threatening conditions, the impact to the overall risk-benefit balance is not known because a 
causal relationship with talazoparib has not been established.  Cases of second primary 
malignancies (other than MDS/AML) reported in the continuing development talazoparib 
programme and in post-marketing surveillance will be continually reviewed and in-vitro and 
in-vivo clastogenicity testing results will be provided to healthcare professionals via the 
SmPC to provide information about this important potential risk.
d Excludes 3 patients that initiated treatment with talazoparib at 1 mg once daily in the originating study 
and are also represented in the 1 mg once daily population
Page 44
Important Potential Risk 3: Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity
Based on findings from animal studies, talazoparib can cause embryo-foetal harm and may 
compromise male and female fertility.  There are no available clinical data on talazoparib use 
in pregnant women or any clinical effects on fertility to inform a drug-associated risk. 
Risk-benefit impact:  Currently, the impact to the overall risk-benefit balance is not known 
because the relationship of reproductive and developmental toxicity to talazoparib treatment 
has not been identified.  The SmPC contains instructions to avoid pregnancy and utilise 
contraception in male and female patients.  
Missing information: Use in Severe Renal Impairment
Pharmacokinetics and safety of talazoparib in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 
< 30 mL/min) or requiring haemodialysis have not been studied.  A formal renal impairment 
study is currently ongoing.
Risk-benefit impact: Currently, the impact to the overall risk-benefit balance is not known 
because talazoparib pharmacokinetics and safety have not been studied in patients with 
severe renal impairment.
SVII.2. New Safety Concerns and Reclassification with a Submission of an Updated 
RMP
There have been no newly identified safety concerns since submission of the initial RMP that 
are considered to warrant inclusion in this update.
Following completion of renal impairment study MDV3800-01/C3441001, A Phase 1, open-
label study to evaluate the PK and safety of daily oral doses of 0.5 mg talazoparib in patients 
with advanced solid tumours and normal renal function or varying degrees of renal 
impairment, use in Severe Renal Impairment is no longer considered an area of missing 
information. 
Following the receipt of the CHMP day 120 list of questions related to Procedure No. 
EMEA/H/C/004674/X/015/G, the important potential risk Myelodysplastic syndrome/Acute 
myeloid leukaemia is being reclassified as identified risk (not important) and removed from 
the list of safety concerns.
For the proposed submission in mCRPC, the starting talazoparib dose of 0.5 mg QD in 
combination with 160 mg QD of enzalutamide maintains a similar talazoparib exposure to 
that achieved with 1 mg QD monotherapy and a generally similar safety profile.
SVII.3. Details of Important Identified Risks, Important Potential Risks, and Missing 
Information
The important identified and potential risks have been determined based on the safety and 
tolerability of talazoparib in the development programme with the characterization of these 
risks based on the data from safety data presented in Section SVII.1.2 and patients who 
Page 45
participated in the pivotal TALAPRO-2 (C3441021) study who received talazoparib in 
combination with enzalutamide.
For each risk, the reported TEAEs for patients in each pooled dataset presented in
Section Module SIII were used to characterize the frequency and severity of each risk and the 
seriousness and outcomes of each important risk.  All PTs listed in the AE tables were coded 
to MedDRA version 25.0.
To further characterize each risk post-authorisation, the MAH’s safety databasee was 
searched for all talazoparib cases reporting AEs or SAEs from CTs that coded to at least one 
relevant MedDRA PT (version 25.0) through the PM DLP of 15 October 2022 (refer to 
Annex 7 for safety database search terms for each risk). 
SVII.3.1. Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important Potential Risks
Important Identified Risk: none
Important Potential Risk: Second Primary Malignancies (other than MDS/AML)
Potential mechanisms 
Talazoparib was clastogenic in in vitro chromosomal aberration and in vivo micronucleus 
assays, indicating potential for genotoxicity in humans.
Evidence source and strength of evidence 
During the clinical development, amongst patients who received talazoparib monotherapy at 
the starting dose of 1 mg once daily for solid tumours, there were 12 TEAEs indicative of 6 
second primary malignancy adverse events (excluding MDS/AML), and none amongst 
patients who received talazoparib monotherapy at doses other than 1 mg once daily.  
In the pivotal mCRPC study there were 14 events of SPM in patients treated with talazoparib 
in combination with enzalutamide: 2 in Part 1 of the Study, and 12 in randomized Part 2 of 
the study. In comparison, 20 events of SPM were observed in Part 2 of mCRPC study in the 
placebo/enzalutamide arm (see Table 15 for more details). 
Overall, as of 16 August 2022, Second Primary Malignancy has been reported in 26 out of 
1199f (2.1%) solid tumour patients treated at any dose with talazoparib in clinical studies 
(See Characterization of the risk, below). 
e The MAH’s safety database contains cases of AEs reported spontaneously to the MAH, cases reported 
by health authorities, cases published in the medical literature, cases from MAH-sponsored marketing 
programs, cases from non-interventional studies, and cases of SAEs reported from clinical studies (including 
non-MAH-sponsored CTs) regardless of causality.  
f Of the participants who initiated treatment in MDV3800-13 at talazoparib doses other than 1 mg/day, 5 
initiated treatment with talazoparib 1 mg/day in the originating study and are also represented in the talazoparib 
1 mg population in the tables below. 
Page 46
Evidence is confounded by prior exposure to other chemotherapeutic agents that may 
increase risk, and the inability to rule out the possibility of occurrence of second primary 
malignancies (other than MDS/AML) unrelated to treatment with talazoparib.
Characterisation of the risk
As of 16 August 2022, there were 26 TEAEs indicative of MDS/AML reported among all 
participants receiving talazoparib regardless of dose.

Risk factors and risk groups and preventability
Potential contributing factors for the development of second primary malignancies (other 
than MDS/AML) include previous platinum‑containing chemotherapy, other DNA damaging 
agents, or radiotherapy.  The incidences of second primary malignancies (other than 
MDS/AML) after first primary breast cancer are higher than the general population and have 
been estimated in several cohort studies, where rates range from 0.24 to 0.83 per 100 Patient-
Years.  Rates may vary due to various factors, including malignancy type definitions, cancer 
sites included, patient inclusion criteria, treatment patterns, and clinical approaches to follow
up.145  In addition, and underlying increased risk of ovarian cancer may be present in patients 
with mutated gBRCA.146
There are no known specific preventive measures to reduce the risk of second primary 
malignancies in patients treated with talazoparib. Patients being treated with talazoparib 
should be monitored for new onset malignancies as per standard clinical practice.
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product
Depending on location and type, second primary malignancies (other than MDS/AML) can 
be serious, life-threatening conditions. Currently, the impact to the overall risk-benefit 
balance is not known because a causal relationship between talazoparib and second primary 
malignancies (other than MDS/AML) has not been established.  Cases of second primary 
malignancies (other than MDS/AML) reported in the continuing talazoparib development 
programme and in post-marketing surveillance will be continually reviewed to determine if 
guidance to healthcare professionals is warranted.
Page 53
Public health impact
The expected risk of second primary malignancies due to talazoparib in the post-marketing 
setting is not known since the relationship between talazoparib administration and second 
primary malignancies has not been established.  
Important Potential Risk: Reproductive and Developmental toxicity
Table 19. Reproductive and Developmental toxicity
Potential mechanisms
Talazoparib was clastogenic in in vitro chromosomal aberration and in vivo 
micronucleus assays, indicating potential for genotoxicity in humans.
Evidence source and 
strength of evidence 
Based on findings from animal studies, talazoparib can cause embryo-foetal 
harm and may compromise male and female fertility.  There are no available 
clinical data on talazoparib use in pregnant women or any clinical effects on 
fertility to inform a drug-associated risk.
Characterisation of the 
risk
Clinical Trial data:
As of the data cutoff date of 16 August 2022, there were no relevant AEs 
suggestive of Reproductive and developmental toxicityg.
Post-marketing experience:
As of 15 October 2022, there were no relevant AEs captured from the MAH’s 
safety database suggestive of reproductive and developmental toxicity.g  
Risk factors and risk 
groups and preventability
Risk factors and risk groups include women of childbearing potential, pregnant 
women, and lactating women.
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant 
while receiving talazoparib. A highly effective method of contraception is 
required for patients and partners of patients during treatment with talazoparib.
Male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or pregnant partners 
should be advised to use effective contraception (even after vasectomy), during 
treatment with talazoparib and for at least 4 months after the final dose.
Impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of the product
Currently, the impact to the overall risk-benefit balance is not known because 
the relationship of reproductive and developmental toxicity to talazoparib 
treatment has not been identified.  The SmPC contains instructions to avoid 
pregnancy and utilise contraception in female patients and in male patients with 
female partners of reproductive potential.
g Please note that a total of 11 events were retrieved with the search criteria included in Annex 7 from 
clinical trials and an additional 7 cases (6 CTs and 1 PM) from the post-marketing safety database, however 
none of those was assessed as relevant for the risk. 
Page 54

PART VI. SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
Summary of risk management plan for Talzenna (talazoparib)
This is a summary of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Talzenna. The RMP details 
important risks of Talzenna, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about Talzenna’s risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Talzenna's Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how talazoparib should be used. 
I. The Medicine and What It Is Used For
Talzenna monotherapy is authorised for the treatment of adult patients with germline BRCA 
mutated HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (see SmPC for the full 
indication).  The recommended dose of talazoparib monotherapy is 1 mg capsule taken orally 
once daily, for which 1 mg hard capsules are available.  Talzenna is also available as 0.25 mg 
hard capsules to allow dose reductions to 0.75 mg, 0.5 mg, and 0.25 mg Talzenna.
Talzenna is proposed to be used in combination with enzalutamide for the treatment of adult 
patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in whom chemotherapy 
is not clinically indicated.
The recommended dose of Talzenna when used in combination with enzalutamide is 0.5 mg.  
Further information about the evaluation of Talzenna’s benefits can be found in Talzenna’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the
medicine’s webpage.
II. Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further
Characterise the Risks
Important risks of Talzenna, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Talzenna’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that
the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g. with or
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
Page 60
If important information that may affect the safe use of Talzenna is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of Talzenna are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of talazoparib. Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available 
data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected.

II.B Summary of Important Risks
Table 25.
Important Potential Risk 1: Second Primary Malignancies (other than 
MDS/AML)
Evidence source and 
strength of evidence 
During the clinical development, amongst patients who received Talzenna at the 
proposed starting dose of 1 mg once daily, there were 6 patients who 
experienced 7 second primary malignancy adverse events (excluding 
MDS/AML), and none amongst patients who received Talzenna at doses other 
than 1 mg once daily.  In comparison, 1 case of second primary malignancy 
(Malignant melanoma) was reported in the PCT arm (N=126; 0.8%) of pivotal 
study 673-301 (EMBRACA).  
In the pivotal mCRPC study there were 14 events of SPM in patients treated 
with talazoparib in combination with enzalutamide: two (2) in part 1 of the 
study, and 12 in randomized part 2 of the study. In comparison, 20 events of 
SMP were observed in part 2 of mCRPC study in the placebo/enzalutamide arm.
Overall, as of 16 August 2022, Second primary malignancy has been reported in 
26 out of 1199h (2.1%) solid tumour patients treated at any dose with Talzenna 
in clinical studies. 
Evidence is confounded by prior exposure to other chemotherapeutic agents that 
may increase risk, and the inability to rule out the possibility of occurrence of 
h Of the participants who initiated treatment in MDV3800-13 at Talzenna doses other than 1 mg/day, 5 
initiated treatment with Talzenna 1 mg/day in the originating study and are also represented in the talazoparib 1 
mg population.

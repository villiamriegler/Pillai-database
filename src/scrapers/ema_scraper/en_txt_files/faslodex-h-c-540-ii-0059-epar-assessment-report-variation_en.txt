2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The application is for Faslodex in combination with palbociclib for the treatment of hormone receptor 
(HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer in women who have received prior endocrine therapy. 
2.1.1.  Epidemiology  
Breast  cancer  is  the  most  common  cancer  in  women  worldwide,  with  nearly  1.7  million  new  cases 
diagnosed in 2012.  This cancer represents about 12% of all new cancer cases and 25% of all cancers in 
women1.  In Europe, there were an estimated 464,000 new cases of breast cancer (female) in 2012 and 
an estimated 131,000 deaths from the disease2.   
2.1.1.  Biologic features and clinical presentation  
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with subtypes having varied responses to anti-hormonal and 
chemotherapy treatments. Breast tumour types can be distinguished by their hormonal receptor status, 
with one third of tumours being ER-negative and two thirds of tumours being ER-positive. Berry, et al  
have shown in a meta-analysis of node-positive patients in the adjuvant setting that while patients with 
ER-positive tumours who receive adjuvant hormonal therapy have better disease-free and overall survival 
than their counterparts with ER-negative tumours, advances in chemotherapy in the ER-negative setting 
have lessened the survival differences between these 2 groups. In this way, ER status is a strong 
predictive factor in identifying patients who may benefit from endocrine therapy. 
ER-positive tumours make up 65% of tumours in women aged 35 to 65 years and 82% of tumours in 
women older than 65 years. These cancers are largely estrogen driven in postmenopausal women where 
the main source of the tumour’s estrogen is from conversion of androgens to estrogens via aromatase 
enzyme action. 
2.1.1.  Management 
Recommendations  from  the  American  Society  of  Clinical  Oncology  Clinical  Practice  Guidelines,  the 
European  School  of  Oncology-European  Society  for  Medical  Oncology  (ESO-ESMO)  2nd  International 
Consensus  Guidelines  for  Advanced  Breast  Cancer  (ABC2),  and  the  National  Comprehensive  Cancer 
Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology recommend endocrine therapy as the preferred 
first-line treatment option for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer (except 
for immediately life-threatening disease or when concerns exist regarding endocrine resistance)3,4,5. The

choice  between  endocrine  therapies  for  the  initial  treatment  is  often  driven  by  prior  adjuvant  endocrine 
therapy, potential side effects, time to progression on prior therapy, as well as the patient’s menopausal 
status. 
Currently, first-line treatment in the ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer postmenopausal 
population typically includes endocrine therapies, such as letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane, fulvestrant, 
and tamoxifen6 with time to progression and prolongation of PFS ranging from 5 to 15 months.6,7  
Modification  of  oestrogen  activity  or  synthesis  represents  the  treatment  of  choice  for  postmenopausal 
women  with  hormone  receptor-positive  advanced  breast  cancer,  particularly  for  those  with  slowly 
progressive disease and limited tumour-related symptoms8. 
Presently,  second  and  subsequent  lines  of  therapy  in  the  hormone  receptor-positive  advanced  breast 
cancer  population  typically  include  endocrine  therapies,  such  as  tamoxifen,  fulvestrant,  steroidal  or 
nonsteroidal AIs, progestins, and androgens6.  
Palbociclib has also recently been approved for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2 
negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with endocrine backbone therapy 
(aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant) (see EPAR Ibrance).  
In  addition,  postmenopausal  women  with  hormone  receptor-positive,  HER2-negative  breast  cancer  that 
have  progressed  after  treatment  with  letrozole  or  anastrozole  may  also  receive  everolimus  (Afinitor)  in 
combination with exemestane.  
Chemotherapy  should  be  reserved  for  cases  of  rapidly  progressive  disease  or  proven  endocrine 
resistance6. 
About the product 
Fulvestrant is a selective oestrogen receptor degrader (SERD) that suppresses both oestrogen-dependent 
and oestrogen-independent signalling.  
Faslodex was originally approved for the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor 
positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease relapse on or after adjuvant anti-
estrogen therapy, or disease progression on therapy with an anti-estrogen. 
The indication was extended on 25 July 2017 to the treatment of estrogen receptor positive, locally 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women not previously treated with endocrine 
therapy. 
It is currently approved in the European Union (EU) as 250 mg/5 ml solution for injection in the following 
indication: 
Faslodex is indicated for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer in postmenopausal women: 
•  not previously treated with endocrine therapy, or 
•  with disease relapse on or after adjuvant antiestrogen therapy, or disease progression on antiestrogen 
therapy.

Fulvestrant was originally approved at a dose of 250 mg for the treatment of postmenopausal women 
with HR+ advanced breast cancer whose disease recurred or progressed on previous antioestrogen 
therapy. The 250 mg dose was subsequently replaced by fulvestrant 500 mg, which was approved in the 
EU in March 2010 (procedural number EMEA/H/C/000540/II/0018). Approval for the 500 mg dose was 
based primarily on the Phase 3 CONFIRM study (D6997C00002), a randomised, double-blind study that 
compared the fulvestrant 500 mg and 250 mg dose regimens in postmenopausal women with HR+ 
advanced breast cancer who had either relapsed while on adjuvant endocrine therapy, or progressed 
while on first-line endocrine therapy for advanced disease.  
On 09 November 2016 the European Commission granted market authorisation to a new chemical entity, 
IBRANCE (palbociclib) for use in combination with fulvestrant. Palbociclib is an oral, first in class, small 
molecule drug. It is a selective, reversible inhibitor of CDK 4 and 6, and was authorised by the European 
Commission on 09 November 2016 for the following indication: 
IBRANCE is indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer: 
- in combination with an aromatase inhibitor; 
- in combination with fulvestrant in women who have received prior endocrine therapy. 
In pre- or perimenopausal women, the endocrine therapy should be combined with a luteinizing hormone-
releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. 
The approval for the combination of palbociclib with fulvestrant was primarily based on the Phase 3 study 
PALOMA-3.  
The purpose of the current application is to extend the indication of fulvestrant to include the use in 
combination with Ibrance. The applied indication was: 
“Faslodex is indicated in combination with palbociclib for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-
positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer in women who have received prior endocrine therapy (see section 5.1).  
In pre- or perimenopausal women, the combination treatment with palbociclib should be combined with a 
luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist.” 
The recommended indication is: 
“Faslodex is indicated: 
• 
as monotherapy for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive, locally advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer in postmenopausal women:  
o  not previously treated with endocrine therapy, or 
o  with disease relapse on or after adjuvant antiestrogen therapy, or disease progression on 
antiestrogen therapy. 
• 
in combination with palbociclib for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
in women who have received prior endocrine therapy (see section 5.1). 
In pre- or perimenopausal women, the combination treatment with palbociclib should be combined with a 
luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist.”

Considering the above data, fulvestrant should be used according to the precautions stated in the SmPC 
in order to minimize any potential risks to the environment. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data has been submitted apart from the updated ERA with this application which is 
considered acceptable. Based on the submitted data in this application, the exposure to the environment 
via waste water is likely to be minor (i.e. PEC SW < 0.01ug/L) but considering the endocrine modulating 
properties and the surface water/fish RQ being >> 1, and the uncertainty of the properties of the various 
transformation products, fulvestrant could pose a minor but still relevant risk to the aquatic environment. 
Therefore, fulvestrant should be used according to the precautions stated in the SmPC in order to 
minimise any potential risks to the environment. 
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Considering the above data, fulvestrant should be used according to the precautions stated in the SmPC 
in order to minimize any potential risks to the environment. 
Environmental risk assessment studies have shown that fulvestrant may have potential to cause adverse 
effects to the aquatic environment (see sections 5.3 and 6.6).

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Study 1023 (PALOMA-3)  
Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 trial of fulvestrant 
(Faslodex) with or without PD-0332991 (palbociclib) ± goserelin in women with hormone 
receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer whose disease progressed after 
prior endocrine therapy. 
Study design  
Study 1023 was an international, multicentre, 2:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group, Phase 3 clinical study with the primary objective of demonstrating the superiority in prolonging 
PFS of palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant (Faslodex) over fulvestrant plus placebo in women with 
HR positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, regardless of their menopausal status, whose 
disease had progressed after prior endocrine therapy. Pre- and perimenopausal women were to receive 
therapy with the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist goserelin (Zoladex® or generic). 
Crossover between treatment arms was not allowed.

Study Participants  
Inclusion Criteria 
Patients must have met all of the following criteria for inclusion in the study: 
1. Women 18 years of age or older, who were either: 
Postmenopausal, as defined by at least one of the following criteria: 
o  Age ≥60 years; 
EMA/53381/2018 
Page 13/54 
 
  
  
  
 
  
o  Age <60 years and cessation of regular menses for at least 12 consecutive months with no 
alternative pathological or physiological cause; and serum estradiol and follicle stimulating 
hormone (FSH) level within the laboratory’s reference range for postmenopausal females; 
o  Documented bilateral oophorectomy; 
o  Medically confirmed ovarian failure 
or 
Pre/ perimenopausal, ie, not meeting the criteria for being postmenopausal. 
o  Pre/perimenopausal women could have been enrolled if amenable to be treated with the LHRH 
agonist goserelin. Patients were to have commenced treatment with goserelin or an alternative 
LHRH agonist at least 4 weeks prior to randomization. But, if patients had received an alternative 
LHRH agonist prior to study entry, they were to switch to goserelin for the duration of the study. 
2. Histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of breast cancer with evidence of metastatic or locally 
advanced disease, not amenable to resection or radiation therapy with curative intent. 
3. Documentation of ER-positive and/or PR-positive tumour (≥1% positive stained cells) based on most 
recent tumour biopsy (unless bone-only disease, see below) utilizing an assay consistent with local 
standards. 
4. Documented HER2-negative tumour based on local testing on most recent tumour biopsy: 
HER2-negative tumour was determined as immunohistochemistry score 0/1+ or negative by in situ 
hybridization (FISH [fluorescent in situ hybridization]/CISH [chromogenic in situ hybridization]/SISH 
[silver fluorescent in situ hybridization]/DISH [dual fluorescent in situ hybridization]) defined as a human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2/centromeric probe for chromosome 17 (HER2/CEP17) ratio <2 or for 
single probe assessment a HER2 copy number <4. 
5. Patients were to satisfy the following criteria for prior therapy: 
o  Progressed during treatment or within 12 months of completion of adjuvant therapy with an 
aromatase inhibitor if postmenopausal, or tamoxifen if pre- or perimenopausal. 
or 
o  Progressed while on or within 1 month after the end of prior aromatase inhibitor therapy for 
advanced/metastatic breast cancer if postmenopausal, or prior endocrine treatment for 
advanced/metastatic breast cancer if pre- or perimenopausal. 
o  One previous line of chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic disease was allowed in addition to 
endocrine therapy. 
6. Except where prohibited by local regulations, all patients were to agree to provide and had available a 
formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue biopsy sample taken at the time of presentation with 
recurrent or metastatic disease. A de novo biopsy was required if no archived tissue taken at the time of 
presentation with recurrent/metastatic disease was available. The sole exceptions were those patients 
with bone-only disease for whom provision of previous archival tissue only was acceptable. Patients who 
had surgery within the last 3 years (but without neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery) and 
relapsed while receiving adjuvant therapy may provide a tumour specimen from that surgery. 
7. Measurable disease as defined by RECIST version 1.1, or bone-only disease. Patients with bone-only 
metastatic cancer were to have a lytic or mixed lytic-blastic lesion that could be accurately assessed by 
computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients with bone-only disease and 
blastic-only metastasis were not eligible. Tumour lesions previously irradiated or subjected to other loco-
EMA/53381/2018

regional therapy were only deemed measurable if progression at the treated site after completion of 
therapy was clearly documented. 
8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1. 
9. Adequate organ and marrow function defined as follows: 
Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500/mm3 (1.5 x 109/L); 
Platelets ≥100,000/mm3 (100 x 109/L);

liver metastases present); 
Alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 x ULN (≤5 x ULN if bone or liver metastases present). 
10. Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior therapy or surgical procedures to National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade ≤1 (except alopecia). 
11. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the patient (or 
a legal representative) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study. 
12. Patients who were willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, 
and other study procedures. 
Exclusion Criteria 
Patients who met any of the following exclusion criteria were not included in the study:

3. Known active uncontrolled or symptomatic Central Nervous System (CNS) metastases, carcinomatous 
meningitis, or leptomeningeal disease as indicated by clinical symptoms, cerebral oedema, and/or 
progressive growth. Patients with a history of CNS metastases or cord compression are eligible if they had 
been definitively treated (eg, radiotherapy, stereotactic surgery) and were clinically stable off 
anticonvulsants and steroids for at least 4 weeks before randomization. 
4. Current use of food or drugs known to be potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, drugs known to be potent CYP3A4

ideation or behaviour, or laboratory abnormality that might have increased the risk associated with study 
participation or investigational product administration or might have interfered with the interpretation of 
study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would have made the patient inappropriate for 
entry into this study. 
15. Patients who were investigational site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the study and 
their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the Investigator, or patients who are

Treatments 
Arm A: palbociclib 125 mg administered orally once daily for 21 days followed by 7 days off treatment for 
each 28-day cycle (Schedule 3/1) plus fulvestrant (Faslodex) 500 mg intramuscularly on Days 1 and 15 
of Cycle 1, and every 28 days (+/-7 days) thereafter starting from Day 1 of Cycle 1. 
Arm B: placebo administered orally once daily for 21 days followed by 7 days off treatment for each 28-
day cycle (Schedule 3/1) plus fulvestrant (Faslodex) 500 mg intramuscularly on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 
1, and every 28 days (+/-7 days) thereafter starting from Day 1 of Cycle 1.  
Palbociclib doses could be reduced to 100 mg daily and 75 mg daily on 3/1 schedule, respectively, or to 
75 mg on a 2-week on/2-week off (2/2) schedule. 
Objectives and endpoints 
The primary endpoint of the study was PFS as determined by the investigators’ assessment. The 
secondary endpoints included an assessment of secondary measures of efficacy and the safety and 
EMA/53381/2018 
Page 16/54 
 
  
  
  
tolerability of palbociclib administered in combination with fulvestrant as well as of placebo plus 
fulvestrant.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints included OS, objective response, duration of response, clinical benefit 
response, and patient reported outcomes (PROs).  
Primary objective: 
To demonstrate the superiority of palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant (with or without goserelin) 
over fulvestrant (with or without goserelin) plus placebo in prolonging investigator-assessed progression-
free survival (PFS) in women with hormonal receptor positive (HR-positive)/human epidermal growth 
factor negative (HER2-negative) metastatic breast cancer whose disease had progressed on prior 
endocrine therapy. 
Secondary objectives: 
• To compare measures of tumour control, including objective response (OR), duration of response (DR), 
clinical benefit response (CBR = CR or PR or stable disease [SD] ≥24 weeks) and overall survival (OS) 
between the treatment arms.  
• To compare safety and tolerability between the treatment arms. 
• To evaluate trough concentrations of palbociclib when given in combination with fulvestrant or 
fulvestrant plus goserelin compared to historical palbociclib data. 
• PK: To compare fulvestrant and goserelin trough concentrations when given in combination with 
palbociclib to those when given without palbociclib. 
• PK: To explore correlations between palbociclib exposures and efficacy/safety findings in this patient 
population. 
• To compare Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) measures between treatment arms. PRO endpoints such 
as global Quality of Life (QOL), functioning, breast symptoms, time to deterioration (TTD) in pain, EQ-5D 
index and general health status. 
• To characterize alterations in genes, proteins, and ribonucleic acids (RNAs) relevant to the cell cycle, 
drug targets, tumour sensitivity and/or resistance.  
• To conduct subgroup analysis for primary and secondary endpoints in stratified groups. 
Tumour assessments 
Post-baseline tumour assessments were performed every 8 weeks (±7 days) for the first year, then after 
1 year every 12 weeks (±7 days) (calculated from randomization) until radiographically and/or clinically 
(i.e., for photographed or palpable lesions) documented PD as per RECIST v.1.1, study treatment 
discontinuation, initiation of new anticancer therapy, or discontinuation of patient from overall study 
participation (e.g., death, patient's request, lost to follow-up) 
Sample size 
The sample size for this study was determined based on the results of a randomized Phase 2 trial 
assessing fulvestrant with or without dasatinib in postmenopausal patients with HR positive metastatic 
breast cancer previously treated with an AI. The median PFS for the fulvestrant alone arm was 5.3 
months and the median PFS for the combination arm was 6.0 months. Based upon these results, the 
median PFS for the comparator arm in this study was assumed to be 6.0 months. 
EMA/53381/2018 
Page 17/54 
 
  
  
  
An improvement of 56% to a median PFS of 9.38 months (corresponding to a HR=0.64) was to be 
considered clinically meaningful. A total of 238 PFS events were required in the two treatment arms for 
the study to have a 90% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.64 (representing a 56% improvement in 
median PFS [6.00 months vs 9.38 months]) with a 1-sided significance level of alpha=0.025. 
Assuming a non-uniform accrual accomplished over a period of about 14 months, data follow-up for 
approximately 20 months from the start of study randomization for final PFS analysis, and a non-uniform 
dropout with dropout rate of 25% at 18 months for PFS, a total sample size of approximately 417 
patients (278 in the fulvestrant plus palbociclib arm and 139 in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm) was 
required. 
The sample size described above also allowed the assessment of differences in the secondary endpoint of 
OS. The median OS for women with advanced or metastatic breast cancer treated with AI and fulvestrant 
monotherapy was assumed to be 24 months. With an overall one-sided α of 0.025 and one interim 
analysis of OS, the study had approximately 80% power to detect a HR of 0.65 (representing a 54% 
increase in median OS from 24 months to37 months) when 198 deaths had occurred.  
A sample-size re-estimation was allowed by protocol at the interim analysis (see below), using the 
inferential procedure described by Cui et al (1999)9 to preserve the type I error. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was stratified by documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy (Yes versus No), by 
menopausal status at study entry (pre-/peri- versus postmenopausal), and by the presence of visceral 
metastases (Yes versus No). ‘Visceral’ referred to lung, liver, brain, pleural and peritoneal involvement. 
Sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy was defined as either: documented clinical benefit (CR, PR, SD ≥24 
weeks) to at least one prior hormonal therapy in the metastatic setting, or at least 24 months of adjuvant 
hormonal therapy prior to recurrence.  
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind trial. 
Statistical methods 
PFS data were censored on the date of the last tumour assessment on study for patients who did not 
have objective tumour progression and who did not die while on study. Patients lacking an evaluation of 
tumour response after randomization had their PFS time censored on the date of randomization with the 
duration of one day. Additionally, patients who started a new anticancer therapy prior to documented PD 
were censored at the date of the last tumour assessment prior to the start of the new therapy. Patients 
with documentation of PD or death after an unacceptably long interval (ie, 2 or more incomplete or non-
evaluable assessments) since the last tumour assessment were censored at the time of last objective 
assessment that did not show PD. 
Time-to-event endpoints between the 2 treatment arms were compared with a 1-sided stratified log-rank 
test adjusting for presence of visceral metastases and sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy (two of the 
baseline stratification factors). PFS time associated with each treatment arm were summarized for the ITT 
population using the Kaplan-Meier method and displayed graphically where appropriate. Hazard ratios 
and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (subject to the multiplicity adjustment at the final analysis for PFS 
and OS) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

Cox proportional hazard models were also used to explore the potential influences of the baseline 
stratification factors on time-to-event endpoints. 
The study was designed to have one interim analysis and the final analysis at 238 events based on the 
primary PFS endpoint with the investigator assessment. The interim analysis was to be conducted to 
allow for early stopping of the study due to efficacy or to potentially re-estimate the sample size of the 
trial based upon the primary endpoint of PFS. The safety of the combination was also assessed at the 
interim analysis. The Haybittle-Peto boundary was used (alpha=0.00135 was to be spent at interim 
analysis) in developing the efficacy boundary of the interim analysis of PFS. The analysis was to be 
performed after approximately 143 investigator-assessed PFS events (documented progressive disease or 
death; approximately 60% of the total events expected). The information fraction for the interim analysis 
may be adjusted if needed. 
Only one interim analysis of OS is planned. Although the first possible time for OS interim analysis could 
be at the time of the PFS IA, it is anticipated that the number of deaths could be low at PFS IA and yield 
non-robust analysis results. Therefore, the OS interim analysis will be planned at approximately 97 
deaths (at the estimated time for planned PFS final analysis). For the interim analysis of OS, O’Brien-
Fleming boundary will be used and the overall significance level for the efficacy analysis of OS will be 
preserved at 0.025 (one-sided test).

Recruitment 
Between 26 Sept 2013 and 26 Aug 2014, a total of 521 pre- /peri- and postmenopausal women were 
randomized (2:1) to the study at 144 sites in 17 countries: Australia (11 sites), Belgium (11 sites), 
Canada (11 sites), Germany (2 sites), Ireland (1 site), Italy (9 sites), Japan (8 sites), the Netherlands (6 
sites), Portugal (2 sites), Romania (4 sites), the Russian Federation (5 sites), the Republic of South Korea 
(5 sites), Taiwan (2 sites), Turkey (1 sites), the Ukraine (6 sites), the United Kingdom (4 sites), and the 
United States (56 sites). 
Three hundred forty-seven (347) patients were randomized to the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm, and 
174 patients were randomized to the placebo plus fulvestrant arm, of which 99 pre- /perimenopausal 
patients additionally received goserelin across both treatment arms. 
Conduct of the study 
The frequencies of different types of protocol deviations were similar across study arms. The majority of 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria violations in both arms pertained to exclusion criteria 5, which states that 
all anti-cancer treatments should have been stopped at least 2 weeks prior to randomization. Secondly, 
violations with regard to providing tumour samples for central lab analysis were frequent.  
There were 2 protocol amendments and 1 SAP amendment during study. 
The protocol was amended to revise the study drug administration instructions from administration in a 
fasted state to administration with food and to prohibit the concomitant use of proton-pump inhibitors. 
Prospective ophthalmic examinations, and prospective monitoring of haemoglobin A1c were added to 
characterize whether or not palbociclib affected glucose metabolism. SAP amendments included eg 
changes due to that biomarker analyses were not performed.

Numbers analysed 
All efficacy analyses were based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Some efficacy sensitivity 
analyses were also performed on as-treated (AT) populations.  
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population or full analysis set includes all patients who are randomized, with 
study drug assignment designated according to initial randomization, regardless of whether patients 
receive study drug or receive a different drug from that to which they were randomized. The ITT 
population is the primary population for evaluating all efficacy endpoints and patient characteristics.  
The AT population or safety analysis set includes all patients who receive at least 1 dose of study 
medication, with treatment assignments designated according to actual study treatment received. The AT 
population is the primary population for evaluating treatment administration/compliance and safety.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint –Progression-free survival 
At the data cut-off date, 05 Dec 2014, 102 (29%) out of 347 patients in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant 
arm and 93 (53%) out of 174 patients in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm had experienced disease 
progression or died.  
The study met its primary objective of prolonging investigator-assessed PFS at the interim analysis 
conducted on 82% of the planned PFS events; the results crossed the pre-specified Haybittle-Peto 
efficacy boundary (α=0.00135), demonstrating a statistically significant prolongation in PFS and a clinical 
meaningful treatment effect. The observed HR was 0.422 (95% CI: 0.318, 0.560; stratified 1-sided p-
value <0.000001) in favour of palbociclib plus fulvestrant. The median PFS was 9.2 months (95% CI: 7.5, 
not estimable) for 347 patients randomized to palbociclib plus fulvestrant and 3.8 months (95% CI: 3.5, 
5.5) for 174 patients randomized to placebo plus fulvestrant. 
At the primary data cut-off date, the most common type of PFS event was disease progression, for 100 
(28.8%) patients in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and 91 (52.3%) patients in the placebo plus 
fulvestrant arm. Two deaths were reported in each treatment arm. 
A total of 245 (70.6%) patients in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and 81 (46.6%) in the placebo plus 
fulvestrant arm were censored in the investigator-assessed PFS analysis. The majority of censored 
patients were still in follow-up for disease progression at the time of censoring, 227 (65.4%) patients in 
the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and 70 (40.2%) patients in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm. 
Two efficacy updates have subsequently been submitted; see further below.

Sensitivity analyses 
The prospectively defined sensitivity analyses of PFS all showed statistically significantly longer 
investigator-assessed PFS for the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm compared with the placebo plus 
fulvestrant arm.

Sensitivity analysis 1: Influence of analysis population; based on AT population 
EMA/53381/2018 
Page 27/54 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Sensitivity analysis 2: A 1-sided unstratified log-rank test was used to compare treatments and the HR was based on an unstratified 
Cox proportional hazards model. 
Sensitivity analysis 3: To investigate whether the stratification factors and important covariates influenced the outcome of the primary 
endpoint PFS. Final explanatory variables for the multivariate model were selected using a backward selection process with the 
significance level of 0.1 for retaining the effects in the model. Baseline factors that entered the model selection included age (≥65 vs 
<65), race (White, Black, Asian, Other), baseline ECOG status (1 vs 0), disease site (Non-Visceral vs Visceral), sensitivity to prior 
hormonal therapy (Yes vs No), menopausal status at study entry (Pre/Peri vs Post), ethnic origin (Hispanic vs Not-Hispanic), and 
geographical region (North America, Europe, Asia Pacific). Assessor’s note: Baseline ECOG status (1 vs. 0), and disease site (non-
visceral vs. visceral) met the criteria and were the two baseline factors included in the model to yield the HR 0.395. 
Sensitivity analysis 4: Influence of disease assessment scheduling. If disease progression was documented between 2 scheduled tumour 
assessments, then the date of progression was assigned to the earlier scheduled tumour assessment. In the event of death, the date of 
the endpoint was not adjusted. 
Sensitivity analysis 5: Influence of deviations in tumour lesion assessment. If a lesion was classified as “indeterminate” (IND) at time 
point “X” and was adequately evaluated as PD at the next time point “X+1”, then PD was assigned to the time point “X” or earlier (the 
first date of the consecutive INDs) instead of the date of the next time point “X+1” as the primary analysis. 
Sensitivity analysis 6.1: Influence of bone-only disease patients. Patients with bone-only disease with fracture, radiation therapy, 
surgery, ECOG at least 2 point increase from baseline or change of therapy were censored at the date of prior tumour assessment with 
no PD. 
Sensitivity analysis 6.2: Influence of bone-only disease patients: Patients with bone-only disease with fracture, radiation therapy, 
surgery, ECOG at least 2 point increase from baseline or change of therapy were considered as events. 
Sensitivity analysis 6.3: Influence of bone-only disease patients: Bone-only disease patients were excluded from the analysis. 
Sensitivity analysis 7: Influence of Missing Data: The following missing PFS data that might have resulted in the censored PFS data in 
the primary analysis were considered PFS events in addition to the documented PD and death: new anti-cancer treatment, lost to 
follow-up, consent withdrawal, medication error without associated AE. 
Sensitivity analysis 8: Influence of potential investigator bias. Random sample BICR data and investigator assessed PFS (event) data 
were combined. For events identified by both BICR and investigator, BICR data were used to determine event time. For patients who 
were censored by both BICR and investigator, BICR (when applicable) data were used to determine the censoring time. 
1) For sensitivity analyses 1 and 4 to 8, stratified hazard ratios are presented, for sensitivity analyses 2 and 3 unstratified hazard ratio 
ratios. 
2) 1-sided p-values are reported except for sensitivity analysis 3 (2-sided p-value) 
PFS updates 
Two updates were performed; the first on 16 March 2015 is not presented since superseded by the 
subsequent.  
23 October 2015 
A later update with data cut-off date 23 Oct 2015 was subsequently submitted based on an overall event 
rate of 64% (333 events in 521 patients) and a median follow-up of over 15 months in both arms. Again 
the PFS HR is slightly higher, at 0.497, but in line with the results in the interim analysis.  
In the second update, the difference between arms in median PFS has increased to 6.6 months (11.2 vs 
4.6 months, respectively).

Secondary endpoints 
Overall survival  
At the 05 December 2014 data cut-off date for the primary PFS analysis, there were 28 deaths from 521 
patients, 19 (5.5%) patients had died in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and 9 (5.2%) patients had 
died in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm. The median OS was not reached in either treatment arm. The 
median follow-up time was 5.6 months for both treatments arms.  
A pre-specified Interim OS Analysis was undertaken with a data cut-off date of 23 Oct 2015.  At this time, 
there were a total of 112 death events [71 (20.5%) vs 41(23.6%) on the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm 
and placebo plus fulvestrant arm, respectively, representing 21.5% of the 521 total patients. The detailed 
summary of the deaths as of the data cut-off date of 23 Oct 2015 are presented in Table 12.

Patient-Reported Outcomes 
The PRO evaluable population was defined as a subset of ITT patients, who had completed a baseline and 
at least one post–baseline PRO assessment prior to end of study treatment. No update was provided for 
PROs.  
Patient–reported outcomes were investigated using the instruments, EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQC30 and EQ-
5D. These are considered standard. However, no primary objective and no strategy to protect the type-1 
error rational are put forward in the study protocol or SAP. Furthermore, the results indicated emotional 
functioning as a driver for the overall health related QoL, why the plausibility of results may also be 
questioned. Unblinding due to the effects of palbociclib on the bone marrow may clearly be present and 
the results potentially associated with hopes with regard to the benefit of the experimental compound. 
The claims concerning Global Health Status/QoL were therefore not accepted. 
Time to Deterioration in Pain 
A total of 335 patients in the Faslodex plus palbociclib arm and 166 patients in the Faslodex plus placebo 
arm completed the questionnaire at baseline and at least 1 post-baseline visit. 
A time to event analysis was prespecified for pain. Time-to-Deterioration was pre-specified as time 
between baseline and first occurrence of ≥ 10 points increase from baseline in pain symptom scores. This 
is an established cut-off in QLQ-C30.  
Addition of palbociclib to Faslodex resulted in a symptom benefit by significantly delaying Time-to-
Deterioration in pain symptom compared with Faslodex plus placebo (median 8.0 months versus 2.8 
months; HR of 0.64 [95% CI: 0.49, 0.85]; p<0.001).

PFS subgroups analyses (updated) 
A reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in the Faslodex plus palbociclib arm was observed 
in all individual patient subgroups defined by stratification factors and baseline characteristics. This was 
evident for pre/perimenopausal women (HR of 0.46 [95% CI: 0.28, 0.75]) and postmenopausal women 
(HR of 0.52 [95% CI: 0.40, 0.66]) and patients with visceral site of metastatic disease (HR of 0.50 [95% 
CI: 0.38, 0.65]) and non-visceral site of metastatic disease (HR of 0.48 [95% CI: 0.33, 0.71]). Benefit 
was also observed regardless of lines of prior therapy in the metastatic setting, whether 0 (HR of 0.59 
[95% CI: 0.37, 0.93]), 1 (HR of 0.46 [95% CI: 0.32, 0.64]), 2 (HR of 0.48 [95% CI: 0.30, 0.76]), or ≥ 3 
lines (HR of 0.59 [95% CI: 0.28, 1.22]).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
Critical visceral disease 
According to current international treatment guidelines, endocrine therapy is not recommended in 
patients with critical, rapidly progressing or symptomatic visceral disease, due to a lower expectancy of a 
rapid tumour response or relevant tumour shrinkage compared with (cytotoxic) chemotherapies.  
Study PALOMA-3 excluded patients with advanced/metastatic, symptomatic, visceral spread, that are at 
risk of life-threatening complications in the short term, including patients with massive uncontrolled 
effusions (pleural, pericardial, peritoneal), pulmonary lymphangitis, and over 50% liver involvement. 
The table below provides available data on time to response (TTR) and objective response (OR) rates.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Study 1023 was a 2:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study comparing palbociclib 
vs. placebo as add-on to fulvestrant (+ goserelin in pre- and perimenopausal patients) in patients with 
hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, whose disease had progressed 
after prior endocrine therapy. Cross-over was not allowed.  
The treatment arms were well balanced with regard to the stratification factors. Neither the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria violations nor the changes to the protocol and SAP appeared to have put the 
integrity of the study at risk. There were no objections to the overall study design. The baseline disease 
characteristics were similar across study arms. Small imbalances were noted but were not considered 
likely to affect the overall study results. 
The study met its primary objective of prolonging investigator-assessed PFS at the interim analysis (data 
cut-off 05 Dec 2014), demonstrating a statistically significant prolongation in PFS and a clinical 
meaningful treatment effect. A number of pre-specified sensitivity analyses confirmed the results of the 
primary analysis.  
Overall survival data were immature and thus non-informative with in total 28 deaths and event rates of 
5% in both arms at the interim analysis. Therefore, two updated analyses were performed for 
investigator-based PFS, ORR, CBR and DOR at a median of 8.9 months follow-up (data cut-off 16 March 
2015) and over 15 months (data cut-off 23 October 2015), respectively. In the second update, performed 
at an overall event rate of 64% (58 vs. 76%), the PFS HR was 0.50 (0.36-0.59). Median PFS was 11.2 
vs. 4.6 months, i.e. a difference of 6.6 months. Thus in the updated analysis, the difference between 
arms has increased from 5.7 to 6.6 months. 
In updated PFS subgroup analyses, all subgroup HR point estimates were below 1.0 and most had 95% 
confidence intervals below 1, indicating robustness of the results.  
In the updated analysis the difference in objective response rate (ORR), 21 vs 8.6% (non-overlapping 
confidence intervals, 1-sided p= 0.0001), and Clinical Benefit rate (CBR), 66.3 vs 39.7% (non-
overlapping confidence intervals, 1-sided p<0.0001), supports the PFS results. Duration of response 
(DOR) was numerically but not statistically significantly longer in the experimental arm compared with 
the comparator arm, 10.4 vs. 9.0 months. 
At a pre-specified interim OS analysis (data cut-off date of 23 Oct 2015) there were in total 112 deaths 
(21%) in both arms; 20.5 vs. 23.6% (experimental vs. control). No deaths in the palbociclib in 
combination with fulvestrant arm were due to toxicity. The formal statistical analysis of OS will be 
performed during the planned OS interim analysis and final analysis. At this time, there are no signs of a 
detrimental effect on OS. The final analysis of Overall Survival is projected to occur by Q4 (Dec) 2017. 
The MAH of Ibrance (palbociclib) has committed to submit these results by Q2 (June) 2018 (see EPAR 
Ibrance). 
With regard to Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), a time to event analysis was pre-specified for Time to 
deterioration (TTD), defined as first occurrence of an increase of at least 10 points in the symptom of pain 
on study. Statistically convincing and plausible results were achieved with a difference in median time to 
deterioration of 8.0 vs 2.8 months, HR 0.6, p <0.001.  
Critical visceral disease 
According to current international treatment guidelines, endocrine therapy is not recommended in 
patients with critical, rapidly progressing or symptomatic visceral disease, due to a lower expectancy of a 
rapid tumour response or relevant tumour shrinkage compared with (cytotoxic) chemotherapies. This 
patient population was also excluded from Study PALOMA-3.  
EMA/53381/2018 
Page 38/54 
 
  
  
  
In patients with visceral disease in PALOMA-3, the ORR was improved by 21.7% (from 13.3 to 35%) and 
Time to response (TTR) was improved by 1.6 months (from 5.4 to 3.8 months) (see section 5.1 of 
SmPC).  
With regard to critical visceral disease, a rapid response to therapy is of importance. There is little 
published data on TTR for comparison. From the very limited literature identified, mainly phase 2 studies 
in different lines of therapy in the metastatic setting, the data showed that the TTR of 3.8 months 
observed for palbociclib + fulvestrant as second line treatment, is more similar to the TTR of endocrine 
therapies (around 4 months) than of the chemotherapy combinations reported (around 2 months).  
Due to the limited information publicly available, and the many confounding factors such as line of 
therapy affecting cross-study comparisons, no firm conclusions can be drawn with regard to the time to 
response of palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant relative to conventional chemotherapies. As the 
efficacy in general, as well as TTR, is clearly better for the palbociclib + fulvestrant combination compared 
with the endocrine therapy alone, no restriction of indication is considered appropriate. Information has 
been introduced in the SmPC to inform the prescriber of the ORR and TTR results for the visceral 
subgroups (see SmPC section 5.1). Section 4.4 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect that the efficacy 
and safety of Faslodex (either as monotherapy or in combination with palbociclib) have not been studied 
in patients with critical visceral disease (see SmPC section 4.4). 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
PFS results appear robust with regard to the level of statistical significance across analyses and it is 
supported by the consistency of results in a number of PFS sensitivity analyses, in subgroup analyses and 
from ORR and CBR analyses. The magnitude of effect is considered of clear clinical relevance, with 6.6 
months improvement in median progression-free survival (HR: 0.50). While the data are still considered 
immature at an OS event rate of 21%, no sign of a detrimental effect on OS has been observed at this 
point.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety assessment is based on the safety data from PALOMA-3 based on the updated safety data cut-
off of 31 July 2015 (corresponding to the IBRANCE NDA 90 day safety update). The safety review is 
based on the All Treated Patients population.  
Study 1023 (PALOMA-3) 
Disposition update as of 31 July 2015: 
A total of 347 patients were randomised to the experimental arm where 345 received treatment, while 
174 patients were randomised to the control arm of which 172 were treated. A total of 60 % in the 
experimental arm and 79 % in the control arm permanently discontinued treatment. Hence, 39 % in the 
palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and 19.5% in the control arm were ongoing as of 31 July 2015.

A higher proportion of AEs and Grade 3-4 were reported in the experimental arm compared to the control 
arm (76 % vs. 23 % respectively).  
Rather few patients were permanently discontinued due to AEs (approximately 5% discontinued both 
palbociclib and fulvestrant for this reason). On the other hand, the high proportion of temporary 
discontinuations of palbociclib as compared to placebo is noted (69 % vs. 13 %). Also fulvestrant was 
more frequently temporarily discontinued in the combination arm (27% vs 5%).

at Least 5% of Patients in Either Treatment Arm 
Source: 90 day SU, Table 11 (part of). Data cut-off: 31 July 2015. 
A total of 38 patients (11.0%) in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and 2 patients (1.2%) in the placebo 
plus fulvestrant arm experienced treatment-related AEs of Grade 4 severity. The Grade 4 treatment-
related AEs experienced by more than 1 patient (0.3%) each in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm were 
Neutropenia (7.2%) and Neutrophil count decreased (3.5%) as well as White blood cell count decreased 
(0.6%).  
A total of 203 patients (58.8%) in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and 8 patients (4.7%) in the 
placebo plus fulvestrant arm experienced treatment-related AEs of Grade 3 maximum severity. The Grade 
3 treatment-related AEs experienced by more than 2% of patients each in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant 
arm were Neutropenia (42.6%) and Neutrophil count decreased (14.2%), Leukopenia (16.5%) and White 
blood cell count decreased (13.9%), as well as Anaemia (2.6%). The only Grade 3 treatment-related AEs 
reported for more than 1 patient in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm were Anaemia and Fatigue 
experienced by 2 patients (1.2%) each.  
Serious adverse events 
Update as of 31 July 2015 data cut-off date: 
A total of 53 patients (15.4%) experienced at least one SAE in the experimental arm vs. 18 % in the 
control arm. Most common SAEs in the experimental arm included pyrexia (5 patients [1.4%]), 
neutropenia (4 [1.2%]), pulmonary embolism (3 [0.9%]) as well as deep vein thrombosis, dyspnoea, 
febrile neutropenia, General physical health deterioration, Pharyngitis, Pleural effusion, and suicide 
attempt (2 [0.6%] each). The remaining SAEs were experienced by one patient (0.3%) each.  
Among patients experiencing SAEs of any severity grade in the experimental arm, Grade 3 SAEs were 
reported for more than half of the patients (55 %), and Grade 4 SAEs were reported for 15 %.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Almost all patients in the experimental arm with hematologic laboratory test results available for 
evaluation had abnormal white blood cell counts (98 %) and absolute neutrophil counts (95 %) as 
compared to 22 % and 8 % respectively for the control arm. 
In the experimental arm, anaemia and thrombocytopenia were reported in 76 % and 57 % of the patients 
vs. 36 % and 8 % in the control arm respectively. 
Clinical Chemistry 
No major concern is raised relevant to clinical chemistry. 
Hy’s Law 
One patient in each treatment arm met the laboratory criteria for a potential Hy's Law case although 
neither case was eventually considered to be a Hy's Law case as these patients also had elevations in 
alkaline phosphatase as well as alternative explanations for the laboratory changes. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
The majority were < 65 years of age. A total of 25 % of the study population were ≥ 65. In terms of 
TEAEs, SAEs and discontinuations, no major differences between the two age groups were observed in 
either arm. Grade 3/4 AEs (related and overall) were numerically higher in the lower age group in both 
arms. Patients < 18 years were not eligible in the study.

Temporary discontinuation 
The overall proportion of TEAEs associated with temporary discontinuation was 69 % in the experimental 
arm vs. about 13 % in the control arm. Most commonly was neutropenia (48 %) and Neutrophil count 
decreased (17 %) as well as white blood cell count decreased (8 %) and leukopenia (7 %). All but one 
TEAE of neutropenia were of Grade 3/4 severity. These myelosuppression AEs were followed by nausea 
(2.6%), vomiting (2.3%), diarrhoea (2.0%), fatigue (2.0%) and ALT increased (1.7%).

Arm (Study 1023) 
Source: 90 day SU, Table 18. Data cut-off: 31 July 2015. 
A total of 128 patients (37.1%) in the experimental arm had their palbociclib dose reduced as of 31 July 
2015: 34 % had their dose reduced from 125 mg QD to 100 mg QD, and 12 % had their dose reduced 
from 125 mg to 100 mg QD and further to 75 mg QD. The palbociclib dose was reduced at least twice for 
31 patients (9.0%) in that treatment arm. In addition, 13 patients (3.8%) had their palbociclib dose 
regimen changed from Schedule 3/1 to Schedule 2/2 (2 weeks on palbociclib treatment followed by 2 
weeks off treatment). In the placebo plus fulvestrant arm, only 3 patients (1.7%) had their placebo dose 
reduced.  
Adverse drug reactions 
The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions of any grade reported in patients receiving fulvestrant in 
combination with palbociclib were neutropenia, leukopenia, infections, fatigue, nausea, anaemia, 
stomatitis, diarrhoea, and thrombocytopenia. The most common (≥2%) Grade ≥3 adverse reactions were 
neutropenia, leukopenia, anaemia, infections, AST increased, thrombocytopenia, and fatigue.  
The table below reports the adverse reactions from PALOMA3. 
Median duration of exposure to fulvestrant was 11.2 months in the fulvestrant + palbociclib arm and 4.9 
months in the fulvestrant + placebo arm. Median duration of exposure to palbociclib in the fulvestrant + 
palbociclib arm was 10.8 months.

In patients receiving fulvestrant in combination with palbociclib in the PALOMA3 study, neutropenia of any 
grade was reported in 287 (83.2%) patients, with Grade 3 neutropenia being reported in 191 (55.4%) 
patients, and Grade 4 neutropenia being reported in 37 (10.7%) patients. In the fulvestrant + placebo 
arm (n=172), neutropenia of any grade was reported in 7 (4.1%) patients, with Grade 3 neutropenia 
reported in 1 (0.6%) patient. There were no reports of Grade 4 neutropenia in the fulvestrant + placebo 
arm. 
In patients receiving fulvestrant in combination with palbociclib, the median time to first episode of any 
grade neutropenia was 15 days (range: 13-317) and the median duration of Grade ≥3 neutropenia was 7 
days. Febrile neutropenia has been reported in 0.9% patients receiving fulvestrant in combination with 
palbociclib. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
At the latest safety data cut-off date of 31 July 2015, a higher proportion of AEs overall (99 % vs. 91 %), 
Grade 3/4 (76 % vs. 23 %), AEs that led to temporary discontinuation and dose reductions (37 % vs. 2 
%) were reported for the palbociclib + fulvestrant (experimental/combination) arm compared to the 
placebo + fulvestrant (control) arm.  
There was a high proportion of temporary discontinuations from study treatment in the combination arm 
69 % vs 13 % in the control arm. However, few patients (approximately 5%) permanently discontinued 
the study or permanently discontinued palbociclib/ placebo or fulvestrant due to AEs. From a tolerability 
perspective this is reassuring. The main causes leading to temporary discontinuations were haematology 
related.  
The add-on of palbociclib to fulvestrant is associated with an overall rather substantial increase in events 
of myelosuppression, largely neutropenia (mainly Grade 3), which has led to a high proportion of patients 
undergoing temporary dose interruptions, dose delays and dose reductions in the experimental arm. It is 
notable however, that overall few cases of febrile neutropenia/ neutropenic sepsis/ neutropenic infection 
have been reported. Considering the fairly low proportion of permanent vs. the high proportion of 
temporary discontinuations, it appears that neutropenia is in most cases successfully managed with 
measures like dose reductions and dose interruptions. References to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics of palbociclib have been included in Faslodex SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4. Furthermore, 
section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect relevant safety data from PALOMA-3, including more 
detailed information on haematological ADRs. 
In study 1023, there was no notable difference in the incidence of SAEs between palbociclib in 
combination with fulvestrant treated subjects ≥ 65 years of age compared to those <65 years of age. In 
regard to treatment duration by age-groups (median), no apparent difference between age group < 65 
and ≥65-74 is noted. The number of patients ≥ 75 years of age were limited which preclude any firm 
conclusion to be drawn in this age group. No specific measures in the SmPC or RMP are proposed. This is 
considered acceptable. 
No new safety issues with regard to fulvestrant were raised from this study. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The add-on of palbociclib to fulvestrant is associated with an overall rather substantial increase in toxicity 
relative fulvestrant alone. The main underlying cause behind this is the palbociclib associated 
myelosuppression, essentially neutropenia, which however does not appear to be translated into a 
corresponding high proportion of febrile neutropenia. The magnitude and severities of the TEAEs reported 
did not result into a high proportion of permanent discontinuations or non-disease related deaths. Hence,

the safety of fulvestrant in combination with palbociclib is acceptable as the ADRs can be successfully 
managed with supportive measures of dose adjustments as appropriate.  Therefore, the safety of 
fulvestrant in combination with palbociclib is considered acceptable.

Risk minimisation measures 
No changes to the risk minimisation measures are introduced with this variation. Routine risk 
minimisation is suggested. This is endorsed. 
Routine risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed 
indication(s). 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC have 
been updated. Particularly, a new warning with regards to patients with critical visceral disease has been 
added to the product information. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI (sections 2, 6.1 and 6.5) to bring it in line with the current 
Agency/QRD template, SmPC guideline and other relevant guideline(s) which were reviewed and accepted 
by the CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do 
not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with subtypes having varied responses to anti-hormonal and 
chemotherapy treatments. Breast tumour types can be distinguished by their hormonal receptor status, 
with one third of tumours being ER-negative and two thirds of tumours being ER-positive.   
ER-positive tumours make up 65% of tumours in women aged 35 to 65 years and 82% of tumours in 
women older than 65 years. These cancers are largely oestrogen driven in postmenopausal women where 
the main source of the tumour’s oestrogen is from conversion of androgens to oestrogens via aromatase 
enzyme action. Modification of oestrogen activity or synthesis represents the treatment of choice for 
postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer, particularly for those 
with slowly progressive disease and limited tumour-related symptoms. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Recommendations from the American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guidelines, the 
European School of Oncology-European Society for Medical Oncology (ESO-ESMO) 2nd International 
Consensus Guidelines for Advanced Breast Cancer (ABC2), and the National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology recommend endocrine therapy as the preferred 
EMA/53381/2018 
Page 49/54 
 
  
  
  
 
first-line treatment option for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer (except 
for immediately life-threatening disease or when concerns exist regarding endocrine resistance). The 
choice between endocrine therapies for the initial treatment is often driven by prior adjuvant endocrine 
therapy, potential side effects, time to progression on prior therapy, as well as the patient’s menopausal 
status. 
Currently, first-line treatment in the ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer postmenopausal 
population typically includes endocrine therapies, such as letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane, fulvestrant, 
and tamoxifen with time to progression and prolongation of PFS ranging from 5 to 15 months.  Second 
and subsequent lines of therapy in the hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer population 
typically include endocrine therapies, such as tamoxifen, fulvestrant, steroidal or nonsteroidal AIs, 
progestins, and androgens.  
Palbociclib has also recently been approved for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2 
negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with endocrine backbone therapy 
(aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant).  
In addition, postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer that have progressed 
after treatment with letrozole or anastrozole may also receive everolimus (Afinitor) in combination with 
exemestane.  
Chemotherapy is mainly used for cases of rapidly progressive disease or proven endocrine resistance. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study 1023 (PALOMA-3) was a 2:1 randomised (n=521), double-blind phase 3 trial comparing palbociclib 
+ fulvestrant vs. placebo + fulvestrant in patients with HR- positive and HER2 negative breast cancer who 
had progressed on at least one prior endocrine therapy in any disease setting. Peri-and premenopausal 
patients were also required to receive a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist such as 
goserelin to suppress ovarian function.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
An interim analysis was performed at a median of 5.6 months follow-up and an overall event rate of 37% 
(100/347 and 93/174 in experimental and comparator arm, respectively). At this point, the study met its 
primary objective of prolonging investigator-assessed PFS with hazard ratio (HR) 0.42 (95% CI: 0.32, 
0.56; stratified 1-sided p-value <0.000001) in favour of palbociclib plus fulvestrant. The median PFS was 
9.2 months (95% CI: 7.5, not estimable) for palbociclib plus fulvestrant and 3.8 months (95% CI: 3.5, 
5.5) for placebo plus fulvestrant, and the difference in medians between arms was 5.7 months.  
In a number of pre-specified sensitivity analyses HR remained stable around 0.4 in all analyses, indicating 
robustness of the results.  
A blinded independent central review (BICR) was performed on a randomly sampled subset constituting 
40% (n=211) of the Intention-to-treat (ITT) population, showing HR 0.27, with similar median PFS in the 
control arm at 3.7 months, but median not reached in the palbociclib arm.   
Two updated efficacy analyses were performed based on investigator assessment. The latter occurred at 
a median follow-up of over 15 months in both study arms, and an overall event rate of 64% (58 vs. 
76%). This showed a PFS HR of 0.50 (0.36-0.59) and median the PFS was 11.2 vs. 4.6 months, i.e. a 
difference of 6.6 months in favour of the palbociclib-containing arm. 
EMA/53381/2018 
Page 50/54 
 
  
  
  
In updated PFS subgroup analyses all subgroup HR point estimates were below 1.0 and most had 95% 
confidence intervals below 1, indicating robustness of the results. Pre-/perimenopausal patients and 
postmenopausal patients had similar HRs, 0.46 and 0.52, respectively, both with confidence intervals 
below 1.0. Patients who had received 0 lines of therapy in the metastatic setting had a somewhat higher 
HR point estimate (0.59) than those with 1 or 2 previous lines of therapy for metastatic disease (0.46 and 
0.48), but with 95% confidence interval below 1.0. 
The difference in OR and CBR supports the PFS results. 
At a pre-specified interim analysis of overall survival (OS) (data cut-off date of 23 Oct 2015), the event 
rate was 21.5% of the total 521 patients (20.5% vs. 23.6%, for palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and 
placebo plus fulvestrant arm, respectively). No death in the palbociclib-containing arm was due to 
toxicity.  
With regard to Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), a time to event analysis was pre-specified for Time to 
deterioration (TTD), defined as first occurrence of an increase of at least 10 points in the symptom of pain 
on study. Statistically convincing and plausible results were achieved with a difference in median time to 
deterioration of 8.0 vs 2.8 months, HR 0.6, p <0.001.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In patients with critical, rapidly progressing or symptomatic visceral disease, a rapid and high likelihood 
of response to therapy is of importance. Chemotherapy is therefore recommended for this group of 
patients, who were excluded from the PALOMA-3. A reference is made in Section 4.4 of the SmPC that 
critical visceral disease has not been studied. This is considered sufficient, since clinical oncologists are 
presumed to be aware of the general guidelines with regard to endocrine therapy and rapidly progressing 
disease. 
The addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant substantially improved on both the PFS and ORR of the endocrine 
backbone, also in the subgroup of patients with (non-critical) visceral disease. Smaller or no improvement 
was observed for Time to tumour response (TTR) in the visceral subgroup. The observed TTRs around 4 
months are difficult to contextualise due to the limited published data on TTRs for chemotherapy. 
Information is included in the SmPC section 5.1 to inform the prescriber of the ORR and TTR results for 
the visceral subgroups of PALOMA-3, and to reflect that patients who had symptomatic visceral disease 
and were at risk of life-threatening complications in the short term and/or had over 50% liver 
involvement were excluded from the study.  
OS data for the pivotal study are immature and have not been presented due to immaturity (21% event 
rate). Given the large treatment effect observed on PFS, and the assessment of deaths, which did not 
raise any new safety concerns, a detrimental effect of palbociclib on OS is considered unlikely.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety assessment for this new indication is based on the safety database from pivotal study 
PALOMA-3 (Study 1023).  
No new safety issues with regard to fulvestrant were raised from this study.  
The most frequently reported TEAEs were associated with neutropenia, largely derived from 
myelosuppression, leading to temporary dose interruptions, dose delays and dose reductions. Other 
frequently reported TEAEs were fatigue, infections, nausea, arthralgia, stomatitis, vomiting, diarrhoea 
EMA/53381/2018 
Page 51/54 
 
  
  
  
and alopecia. Most of the TEAEs were of Grade 1 or Grade 2 maximum severity except for neutropenia 
and leukopenia reported most commonly as a Grade 3 TEAE. 
Considering the overall high incidence and severity of neutropenia, it is notable that overall few cases of 
febrile neutropenia/ neutropenic sepsis/ neutropenic infection have been reported. Given the fairly low 
proportion of permanent discontinuations in relation to the high proportion of temporary discontinuations, 
it appears that neutropenia is in most cases successfully managed by measures such as dose reductions 
and dose interruptions.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are no uncertainties related to the use of Fulvestrant in the applied indication. For palbociclib, some 
uncertainties with regard to toxicity have been identified and are followed in the PSUSAs of Ibrance (see 
EPAR Ibrance).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A prolongation of progression-free survival by 6.6 months in the early metastatic settings of breast 
cancer is clinically relevant and meaningful.  
The main safety risk associated with the combination with palbociclib is bone marrow suppression, 
essentially neutropenia that led to dose delay and dose reductions in about 1/3 patients. Haematological 
toxicity is common for cytotoxic drugs and can be managed relatively easy. Neutropenic infections were 
uncommon. There is also no indication of a cumulative toxicity. 
3.7.2.  Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
PFS results appear robust with regard to the level of statistical significance across analyses, the 
consistency of results in a number of PFS sensitivity analyses and in subgroups, and in terms of support 
from ORR and CBR analyses. Given the large treatment-effect on PFS, and that the evaluation of deaths 
on study and during follow-up did not raise concerns, a detrimental effect of palbociclib on OS is 
considered unlikely. Study 1023 (PALOMA-3) is immature with regard to overall survival (OS), at event 
rates of 21%. The lack of mature data on overall survival will be addressed post-authorisation by the 
IBRANCE MAH. 
The add-on of palbociclib to fulvestrant is associated with an overall rather substantial increase in events 
of myelosuppression, mainly Grade 3 neutropenia which is successfully managed through temporary dose 
reduction and dose interruption. In general, the ADRs are considered manageable and tolerable.  
3.7.3.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The CHMP concludes that the magnitude of the treatment effect on progression-free survival and the 
manageable toxicity contribute to a positive B/R balance. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Fulvestrant in combination with palbociclib for the treatment of hormone receptor 
(HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic

breast cancer in women who have received prior endocrine therapy is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change:

Extension of Indication to include the use of Faslodex in combination with palbociclib for the treatment of 
hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer in women who have received prior endocrine therapy; in pre- or 
perimenopausal women, the combination treatment with palbociclib should be combined with a luteinizing 
hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist for Faslodex. As a consequence, sections 2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 
4.8, 5.1, 5.3, 6.1, 6.5 and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated to update the safety and efficacy information. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. RMP version 12 was included in the application.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

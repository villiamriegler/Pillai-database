Summary of risk management plan for Ilumetri 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  Ilumetri.  The  RMP 
details  important  risks  of  Ilumetri,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how 
more  information  will  be  obtained  about  Ilumetri's  risks  and  uncertainties 
(missing information). 
Ilumetri’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet 
give  essential  information  to  healthcare  professionals  and  patients  on  how 
Ilumetri should be used.  
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Ilumetri  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this 
information  including  the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-
language summary, all which  is part of the European Public Assessment Report 
(EPAR).  
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in 
updates of Ilumetri’s RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Ilumetri  is  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  adults  with  moderate-to-severe 
plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy (see SmPC for the full 
indication).  It  contains  tildrakizumab  as  the  active  substance  and  it  is  given  by 
subcutaneous injection. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Ilumetri’s  benefits  can  be  found  in 
Ilumetri’s  EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage. 
II.  Risks  associated  with  the  medicine  and  activities  to  minimise 
or further characterise the risks  
Important  risks  of  Ilumetri,  together  with  measures  to  minimise  such  risks  and 
the proposed studies for learning more about Ilumetri’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on 
correct  use,  in  the  package  leaflet  and  SmPC  addressed  to  patients  and 
healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack sizes — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen 
so to ensure that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The  medicine’s  legal  status  —  the  way  a  medicine  is  supplied  to  the 
patient (e.g. with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected 
continuously  and  regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment  -  so  that 
 
 
 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
If  important  information  that  may  affect  the  safe  use  of  Ilumetri  is  not  yet 
available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Ilumetri  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management 
activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal 
product  can  be  safely  administered.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as 
identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are  concerns  for  which  there  is 
sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of  Ilumetri.  Potential  risks  are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible 
based on available data, but this association has not been established yet 
and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on 
the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to 
be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important potential risks 
Important potential risk: Hypersensitivity 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Treatment with monoclonal antibodies may lead to the 
development of serious anaphylactic or anaphylactoid 
hypersensitivity reactions, therefore hypersensitivity is 
considered as a potential risk in the RMP. The classification of 
hypersensitivity as a potential risk is based on evidence from 
literature the safety profile described for similar MABs used

Important potential risk: Serious infections 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
The classification of serious infections as a potential risk is 
based on evidence from the clinical development programme 
and the safety profile described for similar MABs that acts in 
the same pathways used for Psoriasis  
Animal studies do not suggest that tildrakizumab produces a 
detrimental effect on the immune system. Tildrakizumab has 
an immunomodulatory mode of action, therefore serious 
infection is considered a potential risk in the RMP and will be 
monitored in the post-marketing setting. 
Patients with concomitant chronic debilitating conditions 
(such as haematological or lymphoreticular malignancies, 
organ transplanted patients, severe stages of rheumatoid 
arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus) who require 
concomitant immunosuppressive therapies such as steroids 
at immunosuppressive doses, methotrexate, 
immunosuppressant or tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) 
antagonists (Fica, 2014). 
A recent systemic review showed that there may be a small 
increased risk of overall infection related to the short-term 
use of TNF-alpha antagonists in the treatment of psoriasis, 
the majority of infections were non-serious (97.6%) and 
were upper respiratory tract infections (Dommasch, 2011). It 
is well-recognised that serious infections including atypical 
infections like TB have been reported with the use of TNF-
alpha inhibitors in psoriasis (Dommasch, 2011).

Important potential risk: Malignancies 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
The classification of malignancies as a potential risk is based 
on the safety profile described for similar MABs that acts in 
the same pathways used for Psoriasis and evidence from the 
clinical development programme.  
Animal studies for tildrakizumab have shown no increase in 
carcinogenic risk. Tildrakizumab has however an 
immunomodulatory mode of action, therefore malignancies is 
considered as a potential risk in the RMP and will be further 
assessed in the post-marketing setting. 
Cancer risk seems to be higher in patients with severe 
psoriasis (Beyaert, 2013). Patients with long standing 
psoriasis seem to be at an increased risk for colon, bladder 
and kidney cancer (Brauchli, 2009). Patients receiving high 
dose PUVA and methotrexate for psoriasis are at an 
increased risk of skin cancer. In a US prospective PUVA 
follow-up study of patients with severe psoriasis, more than 
25% of patients exposed to high doses of PUVA developed 
squamous cell cancer (SCC): the relative risk of SCC for 
patients exposed to high dose PUVA was 5.9 (95% CI 4.0-
8.7) compared to those exposed to low dose PUVA. High 
dose methotrexate was determined to be an independent risk 
factor for developing SCC with a relative risk of 2.1( 95% CI 
1.4-2.8) compared to low or no exposure to methotrexate 
(Stern, 1994).

Important potential risk: Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Psoriasis patients have an increased risk of cardiovascular 
events due to overlapping mechanisms of systemic 
inflammation; therefore MACE is considered a potential risk 
in the RMP and will be further assessed in the post-marketing 
setting.  
The classification of MACE as a potential risk is based on

evidence from the clinical development programme, the 
safety profile described for similar MABs that acts in the 
same pathways used for Psoriasis. 
Patients with psoriasis are at increased risk of myocardial 
infarction (MI) and stroke (Armstrong, 2013) and of MACE 
(Parisi, 2015) and this risk appears to increase with severity 
of disease (Armstrong, 2013; Parisi, 2015; Mehta, 2011). 
The increased cardiovascular risk observed in psoriasis may 
result from a number of often related risk factors including: 
smoking, obesity, hypertension and alcohol misuse. In 
addition the use of dyslipidaemic therapies, such as 
corticosteroids, acitretin and ciclosporin and an associated 
unfavourable lipid profile with high triglycerides and low HDL 
cholesterol may contribute. Psoriasis itself is an independent 
risk factor for MACE (Mehta, 2011) and the overall increased 
risk may be related to a combination of these factors in the 
patient (Mrowietz, 2006).

Important potential risk: Suicidal ideation behaviour (SIB) 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
The classification of SIB as a potential risk is based on the 
safety profile described for similar MABs that acts in the 
same pathways used for Psoriasis and on evidence from the 
clinical development programme.  
Psoriasis patients have an increased risk of depression and 
suicidal ideation. SIB events have been observed with 
monoclonal antibodies used in psoriasis, therefore SIB is 
considered as a potential risk in the RMP and will be closely 
monitored in the post-marketing setting. 
Patients with psoriasis have an increased prevalence of the 
psychiatric disorders anxiety and depressive disorders (30% 
and 60% respectively). About 10% of psoriasis patients 
consider the possibility of suicide (Gupta, 1998). Patients 
with psoriasis are at a higher risk of depression, suicidal 
ideation, suicide attempt and completed suicide (Gupta, 
1998; Kurd, 2010; Koo, 2017).

Important potential risk: Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
IBD events have been observed with other monoclonal 
antibodies (known as IL-17 inhibitors) used in psoriasis, 
therefore IBD is considered as a potential risk in the RMP and 
will be closely monitored in the post-marketing setting.

IBD is considered a potential co-morbidity in patients with 
psoriasis. Patients with Crohn’s Disease (CD) have a 7-times 
higher risk of developing psoriasis, and psoriasis patients 
have a 2.9-times higher risk of developing CD, when 
compared with the general population(Gulliver, 2008; 
Christophers, 2001, Vlachos 2016).

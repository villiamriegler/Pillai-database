2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Fistulas are common complications of Crohn’s disease (CD) and include perianal fistulas that connect the 
anorectum with the perianal area and also fistulas between the gastrointestinal tract and an internal organ or 
the abdominal skin.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
In particular patients with CD involving the distal bowel are at increased risk of developing perianal fistulas. 
Results from population based studies indicate that perianal fistulas are the most common manifestation of 
fistulising CD and develop in approximately 20-30 % of patients along the course of the disease. Recurrences 
are observed in approximately 30 % of the cases (Hellers et al 1980, Schwartz et al 2002). The prevalence of 
anal fistulas beyond Crohn’s diseases patients is expected to be higher.  
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Anal fistulas, typically present as fissures penetrating the intestinal lumen and perianal skin surface, and are 
characterised by local inflammation that is exacerbated by bacterial infection(s) and faecal contamination. In 
the inflamed area, there is lymphocyte activation and local release of inflammatory cytokines. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Perianal fistulas in CD are classified as simple or complex. A complex fistula is characterised as having an origin 
above the dentate line, to have multiple external openings  or are associated with the presence of perianal 
abscess, or of a rectovaginal fistula . Further, a complex anal fistula could also meet the following criteria: have 
rectal stenosis and/or macroscopic proctitis. A complex fistula is more treatment resistant than simple fistulas. 
(Schwartz et al, 2015). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/64055/2018 
Page 7/87 
  
  
 
The main symptoms of perianal fistulas are pain, abdominal swelling, abscess formation, fever and drainage of 
faeces, pus and blood. Perianal disease is associated with high morbidity and has a negative impact on the 
quality of life for the affected patients. 
Presently recommended treatments for perianal fistulising CD include drainage and immunosuppressive 
treatment. Antibiotics and thiopurines are considered as adjunct treatments and anti-TNF is considered the gold 
standard (Gecse KB et al, 2014). However, only infliximab has an approved indication for treatment of fistulising 
CD. 
2.1.5.  Management 
About the product 
Alofisel is an allogeneic somatic cell therapy medicinal product for the treatment of complex perianal fistula(s) 
in adult patients with Crohn’s disease. Alofisel is a suspension for injection containing expanded human 
allogeneic mesenchymal adult stem cells extracted from adipose tissue (expanded adipose stem cells - eASC) 
presented as four glass vials, containing each a 6 mL suspension of 30 million of eASC in Dulbecco’s Modified 
Eagle Medium (DMEM) (consisting of a mixture of amino acids, vitamins, salts and carbohydrates) and Human 
Serum Albumin (HSA). 
The proposed mechanism of action for allogeneic eASC is based on immune modulatory and anti-inflammatory 
properties. Inflammatory cytokines, in particular IFN-γ produced by activated immune cells (i.e., lymphocytes), 
activate eASC in a mechanism which requires induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expression. Once 
activated, eASC suppress proliferation of lymphocytes and inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. 
This immunoregulatory activity reduces inflammation, which may allow the tissues around the fistula tract to 
heal. 
The intended indication claim for Alofisel is: treatment of complex perianal fistula(s) in adult patients with 
non-active/mildly active luminal Crohn’s disease, when fistula(s) have shown an inadequate response to at least 
one conventional or biologic therapy. 
As conditioning of the fistula is a critical treatment step before applying Alofisel and to add clarification the 
approved indication was amended to: treatment of complex perianal fistula(s) in adult patients with 
non-active/mildly active luminal Crohn’s disease, when fistula(s) have shown an inadequate response to at least 
one conventional or biologic therapy. Alofisel should be used after conditioning of fistula, see section 4.2. 
The intended and approved posology of Alofisel is a single local administration of 120 million cells and the 
method of administration is for local injection in a surgical environment under anaesthesia (general or regional). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The clinical development programme for Alofisel for the treatment of complex perianal fistula(s) in adult patients 
with non-active or mildly active luminal Crohn’s disease consisted of one pivotal Phase III study (study 
Cx601-0302) and one Phase I/IIa study (study Cx601-0101). The targeted population in both studies consisted 
of patients with complex perianal fistula(s) with inadequate response to at least one conventional or biologic 
therapy.  
Relevant CHMP guidance includes the guideline on the development of new medicinal products for the treatment 
of Crohn’s disease (CPMP/EWP/2284/99 Rev. 1, 24th July 2008).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/64055/2018 
Page 8/87 
  
  
Central scientific advice was issued by CHMP initially in 2005 (EMEA/H/SA/654/1/2005/PA/I). Follow-up 
protocol assistance was given in 2006 ((EMEA/H/SA/645/1/2006/PA/SME/I), 2009 
(EMEA/H/SA/654/3/FU/1/2009/PA/SME/ADT/I) and 2011 (EMEA/H/SA/2069/1/2011/PA/ADT/SME/III). The 
advice given pertained to quality, nonclinical, and clinical aspects. Whereas the initial advices involved the 
autologous application of eASC, the 2011 advice is based on the proposed allogeneic application of eASC. 
Although quality aspects was only involved in the initial advices, the applicable recommendations have been 
implemented in the allogeneic program. 
The CHMP has previously commented that the primary endpoint in the pivotal Phase 3 study in principle should 
be defined in accordance with CHMP/EWP/2284/99 Rev 1, i.e., “complete closure of fistulas and maintenance of 
a closed fistula without development of new fistulas”. It was considered that the optimum endpoint for 
demonstrating remission at week 24 would be the combination of complete healing (no discharge after gentle 
pressing) with complete MRI based closure of the fistulae.  
The primary efficacy endpoint utilized in the pivotal study deviates from this recommendation and respective 
guideline, because it was defined as clinical closure of external openings that were draining at baseline despite 
gentle finger compression and absence of collections >2 cm of the treated fistula confirmed by MRI images, at 
week 24. This is discussed in the chapter on clinical efficacy. 
Alofisel  is  indicated  for  adult  patients  only.  On  29  September  2014,  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA) 
adopted  a  decision  (EMA  Decision  P/0253/2014)  to  grant  a  waiver  in  accordance  with  Article  11(1)(b)  of 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006) for Alofisel for the condition Crohn’s disease perianal fistula for the age subset 
0 years to 3 years. Said decision also granted a deferral in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 
1901/2006  until December 2020 for Alofisel for the condition Crohn’s disease perianal fistula for the age subset 
4 years to 17 years (procedure number EMEA-001561-PIP01-13). 
Compliance with GCP 
The Applicant declares that the clinical trials included in this submission were conducted in accordance with 
Good Clinical Practice standards and in accordance with applicable regulatory clinical requirements. 
According to the Applicant, the clinical trials within this submission conducted outside the European Union (EU) 
meet the ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Three GCP inspections were conducted by EMA in relation to the MAA and comprised 5 inspection sites in total, 
including clinical investigator sites, CROs and the Sponsor. The detected departures from GCP and deficiencies 
related to trial management were overall considered by the inspection team to have no impact on the inspected 
trials’ data reliability and validity.

substance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/64055/2018 
Page 9/87 
  
  
 
Other ingredients are: Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (containing amino acids, vitamins, salts and 
carbohydrates) and human serum albumin. 
The product is available as one treatment dose contained in 4 Type I glass vials. Each vial contains 6 mL of eASC 
suspension and is closed with a rubber stopper and a flip-off seal. The final dose consists of 4 vials with a total 
quantity of 120 million eASC in 24ml administration volume. The vials are placed inside a cardboard box.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information, characterisation and process controls 
Alofisel contains as active substance in vitro expanded human mesenchymal adult stem cells extracted from 
subdermal adipose tissue (eASC), which are formulated in a cell suspension.  
Human eASC are obtained from donations of lipoaspirate extracted from human adipose tissue of subdermal 
origin. 
The mechanism of action proposed for eASC involves immunomodulation through reduction of T cell 
proliferation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, decrease of proliferation, expression of activating 
receptors and cytotoxic activity of NK cells, decrease of immune cells migrating to inflamed tissues, induction of 
anti-inflammatory suppressor cells such as Treg cells and M2 macrophages, and increase of phagocytosis by 
macrophages and neutrophils.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The manufacturer of the active substance is TiGenix S.A.U., with facilities located in Tres Cantos (Madrid), 
Spain. The manufacturing, control test for batch release and batch release of Alofisel active substance are 
carried out in accordance with current good manufacturing practice by TiGenix and by its contractors. 
Manufacturing activities are performed in Grade B clean facilities with Grade A laminar flow cabinets in 
compliance with cGMP for biologic active substance. No terminal sterilisation, purification, viral removal and 
inactivation steps are performed. 
The active substance is a cell suspension of eASC after in vitro expansion.  
The starting material is obtained from a healthy allogeneic donor through liposuction (lipoaspirate) following the 
requirements for procurement and testing laid down in the European Tissues and Cells Directive 2006/17/EC 
implementing Directive 2004/23/EC. Each Alofisel AS batch is prepared from a single donation from an 
individual donor.  
 The manufacturing process of the active substance starts after the tissue procurement and consists of the 
following three main steps:  
 - Step 1: Isolation (extraction) of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells from the adipose tissue and 
subsequent selection of adipose stem cells (ASC).  
- Step 2: Cell Expansion to master cell stock (MCS) and cryopreservation which consists of the following steps: 
eASC culturing/expansion, eASC harvest, vials filling, MCS cryopreservation and storage. The MCS is the only 
intermediate in the active substance manufacturing process. 
- Step 3: Cell expansion to AS and cryopreservation which consist of the following steps: MCS thawing, eASC 
culturing/expansion, eASC harvest, vials filling, cryopreservation and storage.

Detailed description of the intermediate MCS and AS manufacturing process has been provided and includes the 
identification of in-process controls as well as the respective acceptance criteria, which are considered to be 
adequate. Information on acceptable ranges for the number of population doublings has been requested and 
was provided and acceptably justified by the applicant. No reprocessing steps are defined. 
The control of critical steps and intermediates has been established on a risk based assessment as per ICHQ11. 
The limits and ranges for in-process controls (IPC) for MCS and AS were established during development and 
include biological and microbiological parameters established based upon the quality target product profile 
(QTPP). 
The IPC tests for the MCS and AS manufacturing process and respective criteria are provided and considered to 
be adequate. The mycoplasmas test applied in the IPC was validated as per ICH recommendations.  
The release specifications proposed for the intermediate MCS are suitable for the control of this intermediate.  
The batch analyses presented demonstrate compliance of all batches and for all parameters tested with MCS 
proposed release-specifications and indicate reproducibility and consistency in the MCS manufacturing process.  
For the MCS stability studies, specifications/acceptance criteria applied include cell viability, potency, identity 
and sterility as these are relevant parameters to assess the quality of the MCS.   
For stability studies, specifications/acceptance criteria applied included cell viability, potency, identity and 
sterility as these are relevant parameters to assess the quality of the MCS. Stability studies performed with 
MCSs that were used in clinical development generated supportive data. Primary stability studies applied to 
commercial MCS have been initiated. The primary stability program was considered to be acceptable.  
Control of materials 
A list of the raw and starting materials used in the manufacturing of intermediate MCS and AS is provided 
together with their respective function in the manufacturing process as well as specifications and acceptance 
criteria.  
Certificates of analysis from representative suppliers are presented demonstrating compliance with 
specifications. Also compliance with Note for guidance EMEA/410/01 in respect to TSE/BSE was presented. 
Specifications for raw materials include confirmation of sterility, mycoplasmas and bacterial endotoxins. Animal 
derived products are tested for the presence of specific viruses.   
Lipoaspirate starting material 
The starting material (Lipoaspirate) is collected from healthy living female donors.  
A valid certificate of Authorization for the Extraction of Adipose-Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Cells has been 
issued by the relevant competent authority for the centre proposed for collection of adipose tissue. The 
procurement process to obtain the lipoaspirate starting material from healthy living female donors is carried out 
in agreement with the principles laid down in Directive 2006/17/EC on donation, procurement and testing of 
human tissues and cells as well as Directive 2006/86/EC on traceability of human tissues and cells.  
Detailed information on which virus markers are tested on the donors of adipose tissue has been provided. Both 
immunological and NAT tests are used for all markers. It has been confirmed that only CE-marked test kits are 
used for donor testing. Information about the laboratory where the donor virus testing is performed has been 
provided.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/64055/2018 
Page 11/87 
  
  
Each donation (lipoaspirate) has a unique identification code to ensure donation traceability. This code is 
maintained through the complete manufacturing process and lifecycle.  
Process validation 
Validation of the AS manufacturing process was performed based on aspects that could impact the critical 
quality attributes (CQAs) of the only intermediate of the process, the MCS, and of the final AS.  
Validation was performed for the steps starting from donation (starting material) to MCS and from MCS to AS. 
Aseptic conditions were monitored throughout the process as per cGMP.  IPC sampling plan was provided and 
MCS and AS batches were also tested according to the proposed release specifications.  
The results from relevant OC, IPC and release also demonstrate that the AS manufacturing process is also able 
to consistently produce a finished AS with the required quality namely in respect to patient safety (microbial 
contamination), yield, potency, purity and identity. 
The transport kit is considered suitable to maintain the quality of the donated material from tissue collection 
establishment to AS manufacturer.  
The stability of the lipoaspirate from extraction up to further processing was also studied. The Applicant’s 
proposal for handling the lipoaspirate starting material is considered supported by the stability data provided. 
Manufacturing process development 
The steps taken during development of the manufacturing process were described. This was initially based on 
published data and the development of an autologous version of the product for which scientific advice was 
received from EMA. Relevant aspects for the process performance or the quality of the product were monitored 
through the development process and the critical steps were identified  
In general the information provided is acceptable. Data provided confirmed process consistency. The control 
strategy implemented for MCS and AS manufacturing processes was based on ICH Q11v.  
Characterisation  
The characterisation of eASC was performed in accordance with the Guideline on Human Cell-based Medicinal 
Products (EMEA/CHMP/410869/2006) and the Reflection Paper on stem cell-based medicinal product 
(EMA/CAT/571134/2009) regarding structural (morphology, positive expression of surface markers, absence of 
surface markers from other cell types) and biological and functional features of the eASC (growth kinetics, 
viability, differentiation capacity, immune-regulation, immune-related proteins and proteins related with 
regenerative and reparative activity).  
The approach taken for the characterisation of the eASC is adequate to assess the identity, purity, viability, 
functionality and potency of eASC.  
Main impurities potentially present in the final AS are microbial contaminants, product-related or 
process-related impurities.  
The approaches taken for the assessment of the structural, biological and functional features of the eASC as well 
as for the identification and control of potential impurities performed from the starting materials and reagents 
throughout the manufacturing up to MSC and AS are in general satisfactory to ensure proper AS characterisation 
and control. Additionally, it was adequately demonstrated that the manufacturing process developed is 
adequately capable of removing potential process impurities to undetectable levels at the level of AS.

Specification 
The release and shelf life specification for the active substance have been provided by the Applicant.  
The proposed release and end of shelf-life specifications for identity, purity and potency proposed for AS are 
considered adequate. Stated impurities have been studied in nonclinical and clinical studies.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.  
The principles and procedures of some of the analytical methods used are adequately described to allow for an 
exact identification and fit for purpose evaluation. The applicant provided additional information including details 
on assay procedure, system suitability, quality of reagents used and process parameters for the analytical 
methods. Early in the procedure a major objection was raised in relation to the potency assay. During the 
procedure the applicant provided additional data to support the suitability of the potency assay and the major 
objection is considered to be resolved.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data of the active substance were provided. The results are within the specifications and confirm 
consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
There is no reference material for this product.  
Stability 
A shelf-life of 24 months is proposed for commercial AS. On the basis of the submitted data, the proposed 24 
months shelf-life for AS batches is considered to be acceptable. 
A post-approval stability commitment has been provided confirming that an annual stability protocol will be 
undertaken. The applicant also confirmed that the post-approval annual stability protocol follows the protocol 
provided in the dossier. 
Comparability Exercise for Active Substance 
A comprehensive prospective comparability exercise between batches produced pre- and post-change has been 
presented. In summary, the available data support the prospective comparability exercise between batches 
produced for clinical trials and the commercial product. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product  
Alofisel finished product (FP) is stored in glass vials of 6 mL containing eASC combined with DMEM used as 
isotonic buffer and Human Serum Albumin (HSA) used a stabilizer. There are no novel excipients used in the 
finished product formulation. The final composition is included in Table 1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/64055/2018 
Page 13/87 
  
  
Table 1. The final composition of Alofisel finished product 
The container closure system for Alofisel FP is a 6 mL Type I glass vial (9 mL volume capacity) with a rubber 
stopper and an aluminium seal with a flip-off plastic cap. The final dose consists of 4 vials with a total quantity 
of 120 million eASC.  
The description of the container closure system is given in sufficient detail. Specifications and schematic 
drawings were provided for the primary packaging components: 9 mL volume capacity Type I colourless 
borosilicate glass vial, chlorobutyl rubber stoppers and aluminium seal (not in contact with the product). The 
shipping container was also described. The suitability of the shipping container in the transport of Alofisel FP has 
been sufficiently justified in the dossier. The glass vials and rubber stoppers comply with the requirements of the 
Ph. Eur. 3.2.1 and 3.2.9, respectively. The primary container closure system has been shown to be compatible 
with the finished product. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The development of the final FP aimed to achieve a sterile cell suspension for injection of eASC which can be 
administered intralesionally in the anal fistula wall. Cells’ stability and sterility were evaluated through the 
manufacturing, storage and administration of the final FP. Stability studies were performed using different 
formulations tested in different storage conditions: different eASC concentrations, excipients, and storage 
conditions. 
The manufacturing process of FP is very simple consisting of three main steps: 1. Thawing of frozen AS and 
recovery of thawed eASC; 2. Formulation of the FP and 3. Filling, packaging and shipping of the FP. The selection 
of the culture flasks for the recovery of the thawed eASC, culture medium and conditions of incubation, seeding 
density and duration of the recovery phase was adequately performed based on data obtained in various studies 
where different conditions were tested.  
The container closure system was selected based on its suitability with the dosage form and route of 
administration. Studies performed during the development of FP (including extractables testing, protection from 
microbial ingress, potential cell adhesion, tightness, and consistency of the manual vial filling) demonstrated 
that the container closure system maintains the proposed storage conditions during transportation of the FP 
until administration to patient. 
Due to the cellular nature of the AS it is not possible to include any terminal sterilization, purification, viral 
removal or viral inactivation steps in the manufacturing processes of both AS and FP. As such, the safety of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/64055/2018 
Page 14/87 
  
  
 
final FP with respect to adventitious agents relies strongly on a risk assessment and a number of measures 
undertaken from the collection of the starting material and throughout the manufacturing processes, namely 
donor selection and serology testing, selection of raw materials and excipients, maintenance of aseptic 
environment conditions during manufacturing, testing of adventitious agents at appropriate stages of 
production and protection from primary packaging. 
The description of the pharmaceutical development is considered adequate.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Alofisel FP is manufactured at TiGenix S.A.U. which is involved in the various steps of the manufacturing 
excluding sterility, mycoplasmas and genetic stability control tests for release which are carried out by four 
contractors. All these manufacturers comply with cGMP and the QP declaration. 
The manufacturing process of Alofisel FP consists of the following steps: thawing of frozen AS and recovery of 
eASC, formulation of FP which includes harvesting and washing eASC and formulation with DMEM and 20%HSA  
as excipients and finally manual filling, packaging and shipping.  
It is stated that all manufacturing steps are carried out as per cGMP and under aseptic conditions inside a Grade 
A Laminar flow biosafety cabinet to avoid any potential contamination and cross-contamination. 
The Alofisel manufacturing process steps are controlled based on the risk assessment described for AS having 
the critical steps defined on the basis of the input and output parameters likely to affect the CQA with impact on 
the efficacy, safety and/or yield of the FP.  
The control strategy proposed for Alofisel is based on control of CQAs by specification at release (critical 
microbiological control; identity, purity and potency only performed at AS), operational ranges for OCs, 
monitoring IPC (classification of each IPC as critical IPCs/CPA where cell count and microbiological control are 
included; and monitored attributes such as PD, cell viability or morphology), and raw material and excipients 
tight control. This is found to be acceptable. 
The input and output parameters applied during manufacturing were defined by operation conditions and IPC 
established based on the experience gathered during development and from the manufacturing process.  
There are no intermediates isolated during the manufacturing process of FP. No reprocessing steps are defined. 
Due to the limited shelf-life of 48h, IPCs are performed during the last steps of the manufacture, immediately 
before and after FP formulation.   
The excipients used for the Alofisel finished product formulation are Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) 
and Human Serum Albumin (HSA) 20%.  
Adequate information has been provided on the control of the excipients. 
Non-product related contaminants to be controlled at the level of the FP.  
Packaging information is provided including shipping conditions (up to 48h at 15-25ºC and immediate 
administration to patient) which were qualified by monitoring the temperature inside the shipping system. A 
batch numbering system ensures adequate traceability from donors through AS to FP and patient. 
Process validation 
The validation of the manufacturing process of the Alofisel finished product was performed at the cell therapy 
manufacturing plant of TiGenix in Tres Cantos (Madrid, Spain) and included the following aspects: a) Process 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/64055/2018 
Page 15/87 
  
  
consistency and reproducibility (preliminary validation study); b) Process robustness (primary validation 
study); c) Aseptic process (preliminary validation study); and d) Suitability of container closure system and 
shipping system.  
Manufacturing operations for Alofisel FP do not define an intermediate and therefore no holding time validation 
was performed.  
The analytical procedures used for the validation of the various critical steps of the manufacturing process of the 
Alofisel FP, like all the QC testing, are to be performed as per AS release specification. The exception was the 
Gram staining testing applied to check for absence of bacterial contamination during manufacturing which is 
based on a visual inspection test. This is considered acceptable. 
Process consistency and reproducibility were confirmed.  
Robustness of the process was validated for the source of the starting material.  
Aseptic processing was validated by environmental and microbiological monitoring (in-operation non-viable 
particle counting and viable particle counting) and media fill validation.  
For the finished product packaging and shipping validation, the adequacy of the proposed shipping system was 
evaluated for the transport of Alofisel FP within 48h at 15-25ºC while maintaining its quality up to administration 
to patient(s).  
Overall the performed process validation demonstrates that the Alofisel finished product manufacturing process 
is robust and consistently yields FP that meets the predetermined quality attributes which included its intended 
sterility.  
Product specification 
The agreed release and shelf life specifications for Alofisel finished product have been provided. 
The release and shelf-life specifications include tests for identity, purity and potency are considered to be 
adequate.  
A justification for specifications proposed for routine release and end of shelf-life was provided and considered 
to be adequate.  
The parameters and limits proposed for release and end of shelf-life specifications have been based on process 
capabilities, manufacturing and testing experience, batch analysis, stability data and literature. 
The acceptance criteria proposed have been provided and found to be acceptable. 
Analytical methods 
Whenever applicable, Ph. Eur. analytical procedures are used in the control of FP (i.e. cell concentration, cell 
viability, accumulated PD, sterility, mycoplasmas, and bacterial endotoxins). Non-compendial analytical 
methods have been validated according to ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data was provided for three consecutive batches of Alofisel FP of maximum size and for batches 
sourced from different donors and for three proposed batch sizes  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/64055/2018 
Page 16/87 
  
  
 
A summary of the analytical data was provided against the release criteria accepted at time of release. In all 
cases compliance was observed  
The results obtained indicate compliance with the specification proposed, showing reproducibility in the quality 
of the FP batches manufactured.  
Reference materials 
There is no reference material for the finished product.  
Stability of the product 
A shelf-life of 48 h is proposed for commercial finished product when stored between 15ºC and 25ºC in the 
container closure system. This is considered to be acceptable. 
A primary stability study was performed to support the shelf-life of 48h and the storage conditions proposed 
based on the data obtained from the supporting stability study. In all cases compliance is observed with 
specification in particular for appearance, cell viability, potency and sterility, indicating that the Alofisel FP is 
stable up to 72h between 15ºC and 25ºC.  
In addition a stability study has been performed covering a period of 96h.  
The data obtained indicate that the Alofisel FP is stable up to 48h between 15ºC and 25ºC.  
The post-approval stability commitment was provided referring to an annual stability protocol.  
Adventitious agents 
Materials of human and animal origin used in the production of Alofisel include the lipoaspirate starting material 
and the excipients Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) as isotonic buffer and Human Serum Albumin 
(HSA) 20% as stabilizer.  
Virus safety 
A revised risk assessment has been provided upon request where more detailed information has been included 
on testing of donor, virus testing on MCS and active substance and any risk related to the type of tissue used. 
The revised adventitious agent risk assessment report is acceptable.  
Regarding the lipoaspirate donor material, donors are tested according to requirements in directive 2006/17/EC. 
Detailed information regarding which virus markers are tested on the donors of adipose tissue has been 
provided. Both immunological and NAT tests are used for all markers. It has been confirmed that only 
CE-marked test kits are used for donor testing.  
Method description and validation data has been provided for the virus testing performed on MCS and AS. These 
data are in general acceptable. 
The Viral safety of Human Albumin 20 %, which is used as an excipient, has been sufficiently ensured. To 
minimise the risk of virus transmission and assure that the human albumin is of sufficient quality in line with 
current EU legislation, the Applicant selected an EU registered medical product to be used as excipient. A short 
summary of the bases for donor selection and viral testing strategy is provided. A detailed summary over the 
virus validation studies demonstrating sufficient safety margin for both enveloped and non-enveloped virus for 
Human Albumin 20 % has been included. 
Assessment report

TSE safety 
The testing of adventitious safety and the introduced safety measures for raw of biological origin is considered 
to be acceptable. 
The animal materials have been adequately described and are deemed acceptable. The risk of transfer of vCJD 
from donor cells and measures taken to minimise this has also been adequately addressed by the Applicant. 
Sterility is tested at several steps of the manufacturing process including the starting material, active substance 
and finished product according to Ph.Eur. 2.6.1.  
Bacterial  endotoxin  testing  according  to  Ph.Eur.  2.6.14  applying  the  limulus-amoebocyte-lysate  (LAL)  assay 
method is performed as part of the starting material, active substance and finished product release testing. 
Mycoplasma testing is performed during manufacture and as part of the starting material, active substance 
finished product  
Due to the nature of the product and the short shelf life, the final tests for sterility and mycoplasma are only 
available after release. In case a positive sterility test result is identified after the product is released, the 
Applicant uses a batch coding system to trace the AS and MCS from which the contaminated final product was 
derived and notifies the treating physician. This proposal has been considered accepted also taking into account 
that thus far there have not been any cases of transmission of infectious agents after Alofisel administration. 
In conclusion the adventitious agent safety evaluation and controls implemented at the level of the donor 
material and during manufacture and control of Alofisel are considered acceptable. 
GMO 
Not applicable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
A number of deficiencies and points for clarification have been identified during the procedure and three major 
objections were raised.  
The first major objection related to the stability of an intermediate product which was considered not adequately 
supported by stability data available so far. During the procedure the applicant presented new data and the 
concern related to the stability of the intermediate could be resolved.   
Two additional major objections were related to a lack of information on the starting material and virus safety of 
the allogeneic donor material. During the procedure the Applicant provided additional information regarding 
testing of donors of adipose tissues (starting material) and the centre where this is performed. The Applicant has 
clarified the inspection status of the centre where the collection of adipose tissue takes place and was able to 
resolve the concern. In relation to virus safety, the Applicant performed an additional adventitious agent safety 
risk assessment and provided more details on donor testing and viral test on MCS and AS. The strategy for the 
risk assessment is considered acceptable.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on 
viral/TSE safety. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects as described above. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CAT 
recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  The Applicant will undertake to review the data generated for the potency assay from clinical experience 
after suitable experience has been generated and to follow any recommendation that is issued following the 
review of the data. 
2.  The Applicant will submit additional data demonstrating the suitability of the microbial control test, Ph. Eur. 
2.6.27, for lipoaspirate. 
3.  The Applicant will provide a summary of a cross-validation exercise for a requested analytical method. 
4.  Regarding the addition of a new irradiation site for a biological raw material, the applicant will provide a 
critical assessment on the functionality of the material demonstrating that the radiation per se does not 
raise any concerns.  
The CHMP endorse the CAT assessment regarding the recommendations for future quality development as 
described above.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
An extensive program of nonclinical studies was conducted with eASC. In most studies, cell preparations were 
expanded with the method of manufacture and to the same population doubling level of the product for clinical 
use. Several routes of administration were investigated: a combination of perianal + intrarectal administration 
reflecting the intended clinical route, the intravenous route exemplifying a systemic administration and the 
intravaginal route to provide supportive information of safety, although it is important to highlight that 
rectovaginal fistulas are not intended to be treated and were excluded from clinical study protocols. 
For the perianal + intrarectal and intravaginal routes of administrations the dose used in the non-clinical studies 
was the maximum feasible dose, based on: i) the maximum volumes that could be injected into the animal 
model (mouse or rat) by the specific route of administration; and ii) by the maximum concentration in which 
eASC could be formulated without affecting their viability. For the intravenous route, the dose used for the 
repeat-dose was the NOAEL derived from the acute-dose toxicological studies. 
The applicant has chosen immunocompromised athymic rats to perform the biodistribution, toxicology and 
tumourigenicity studies. The applicant considers that this was done in order to minimize the immune recognition 
and potential rejection of human eASC in the experimental animal models and to extend Cx601 persistence 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/64055/2018 
Page 19/87 
  
  
 
which should, in principle, enhance the likelihood to observe test-item related toxic effects. Data to support the 
notion of rejection was also observed when eASC cells were administered to immunocompetent rats.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The applicant investigated the role of eASC in modulation of the inflammatory response in induced colitis, as well 
as the clinical presentation of disease. 
Colitic mice were treated with either 3 x 105 or 1 x 106 eASC (intraperitoneal, i.p.) 12 hours after intrarectal 
injection of TNBS. Dose dependent, statistically significant improvements in overall survival and body weight 
loss were associated with eASC treatment relative to TNBS control treatment. In addition, a significantly 
reduced infiltration of CD4+ and CD11b+ (commonly used as a marker for macrophages) cells (p < 0.05) was 
observed in eASC treated mice as compared to TNBS control mice. Importantly, eASC treatment reduced the 
concentration of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-12 and chemokines RANTES 
(regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) and macrophage inhibitory protein 2 (MIP-2), in 
comparison to untreated colitic mice. Increased expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, was also 
associated with eASC treatment. 
To verify the in vitro findings of an important role for eASC in induction of Treg cells, CD4+ T cells from eASC 
treated TNBS mice were purified ex vivo and administered i.p to colitic mice. Administration of T cells from eASC 
pre-treated mice resulted in favourable clinical presentation of colitic mice, with improvements in body weight 
and overall survival relative to the TNBS control. Treatment with either T cells isolated from TNBS mice that had 
not been primed with eASC treatment, or CD25-depleted T cells (depleting the CD4+CD25+ Treg population), 
abrogated the protective activity that had been afforded with administration of T cells from eASC pre-treated 
mice. Thus, the role for eASC in induction of Treg cells has also been shown in an inflammatory model in vivo. 
Up to 5 x 106 eASC expanded to population doubling levels equal to levels of products for clinical use were 
intravenously infused twice at 2 week intervals to athymic nude rats (N = 20M/20F/dose level). A functional 
observational test battery (FOB) was performed and results compared to control animals receiving equal 
volumes of lactate ringer’s solution. Animals were euthanised at 2 or 26 weeks after the final infusion. Deaths 
were reported at the low dose (0.2 x 106 cells, N = 1F [day 173]), medium dose (1 x 106 cells, N = 1M [day 196]) 
and high dose (5 x 106 cells, N = 1M [day 166], 1F [day 26]). Consistent with the rapid clearance of eASC 
reported, there was no indication that any death was treatment related. Treatment did not induce any adverse 
signs in the FOB, which included evaluations of motor activity, behavioural parameters and reflex responses. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies have not been performed for eASC which was considered acceptable by 
the CAT. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Central Nervous System (FCI-07-03-FT) 
Method 
Human eASC preparations from six donors (3 men and 3 women) were expanded to population doubling levels 
equal to levels of product for clinical use. Cell suspensions for injection contained a mixture of the 6 eASC

preparations. Male and female athymic nude rats (Crl:NIH-Foxn1rnu; n=20 per sex per dose level) received two 
intravenous administrations (10-min infusion) with a 2-week interval of 1 ml cell suspension at a dose level of 
0.2 x 106, 1 x 106 or 5 x 106 cells. Control animals received equal volumes of Lactate Ringers solution. Animals 
were euthanized at 2 or 26 weeks (n=10 per sex per dose level per time point) after the final infusion. 
Results 
4 animals died during study. None of these were considered to be related to treatment. eASC treatment did not 
affect any of the neurological parameters evaluated in the Functional Observational Battery Test, which included 
motor activity, behavioural parameters, coordination, and reflex responses. 
Cardiovascular and respiratory systems 
Cardiovascular or respiratory safety pharmacology studies were not performed for eASC which was considered 
acceptable by the CAT. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Below relevant publications were submitted to evaluate the effect of commonly administered therapies in 
Crohn’s disease on the activity of eASC. 
Effect of anti TNFα on the immunomodulatory properties of eASC (De La Rosa et al 2009) 
Method 
The effect of anti-TNFα on the capacity of eASC to inhibit PBMC proliferation was investigated by adding 
anti-TNFα both in conditioned supernatants of the co-culture of eASC with activated PBMC and directly in the 
co-culture in transwell or contact conditions.  
Results 
TNF-α blocking had no effect over the inhibitory capacity of the eASC, whereas IFN-γ neutralization significantly 
blocked eASC-mediated inhibition in transwell conditions.  
Effect of methotrexate (MTX) and azathioprine (AZA) on the immunomodulatory properties of eASC 
(Duijvestein et al., 2011 and Mancheño-Corvo et al., 2013) 
Method 
The effect of MTX and AZA on the capacity of eASC to inhibit PBMC proliferation was investigated by adding 
clinically relevant concentrations of MTX or AZA in co-cultures of eASC and activated PBMC. 
Results 
Results from MTT cell viability assays indicated that incubation with MTX did not significantly affect the viability 
and proliferation of eASC. Incubation with AZA did not affect viability and proliferation when used at clinically 
relevant concentrations, but was toxic at the high concentration (1000µM). In addition, MTX or AZA did not 
significantly modify the anti-proliferative effect of eASC indicating that no synergistic or antagonizing effect 
between eASC and MTX or AZA was apparent in vitro. Also, the capacity of eASC to generate Tregs in vitro was 
not affected by MTX or AZA.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
A total of 3 biodistribution studies were performed in male and female athymic nude rats (rnu/rnu) with eASC, 
expanded to population doubling levels equal to levels of product for clinical use. Several routes of 
administration were applied: a combination of perianal + intrarectal administration reflecting the intended 
clinical route, the intravenous route, and the intravaginal route. The distribution of the injected eASC was 
monitored at different timepoints (day 1 or 2, day 14, day 90 or 91 and day 182). When cells were administered 
using the perianal + intrarectal route or the intravenous route, human genomic DNA was detected at day 1/2 
and day 14. When cells were administered using the intravaginal route, cells were only detected at day 2. In 
conclusion, when administered locally human eASC is only persistent for a short period of time in rats.  
The biodistribution of eASC injected using the perianal + intrarectal route was restricted to the rectum (high 
signal) and jejunum (low signal, mostly just above LOQ), which seems logical from an anatomical point of view 
when administering the cells intrarectally. When the intravaginal route was used, human DNA was detected at 
a very low level in the upper part of the uterus in 1 female. However, no detection of human DNA into the ovaries 
was reported, indicating that there is not migration of eASC into the ovaries, even when this route of 
administration is used.  
When eASC were administered intravenously, human genomic DNA was detected at a high level in lungs of 
almost all treated athymic rats, which is to be expected when using this route. Some other tissues (including 
heart, liver, kidney, jejunum, ileum, colon and cecum) tested positive in very few animals.

Single doses of 5 x 106 cells/rat and 10 x 106 cells/rat were well tolerated when administered via the intravenous 
or subcutaneous route. After perianal + intrarectal or intravaginal administration, the administered dose of 5 x 
106 cells was also well tolerated. An intravenous dose of 10 x 106 cells was associated with mortality and 
moribund sacrifice during or immediately after dosing, related to pulmonary embolism. This is consistent with 
the noted thrombi in lungs on day 2. Thrombi decreased in incidence between day 2 and day 14 post-injection 
and were no longer observed at time-points ≥ 90 days. Despite this toxicity pattern specific of the intravenous 
route of administration at a dose of 10 x 106 cells in rats, there were no indications of systemic toxicity, but 
rather an inconsistent and variable toxicological profile, suggesting that the limited toxicity observed is likely 
incidental. Observations were confined to local inflammatory histopathological changes at the site of injection 
for the perianal + intrarectal route and to the observation of thrombi in lungs for the intravenous route. These 
microscopic observations decreased in incidence between day 1/2 and day 14 and showed full recovery within 
90 days post-injection. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Two repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted with human eASC in male and female athymic nude rats 
(Crl:NIH-Foxn1rnu) via the perianal route, a study with a 3-month post-dose observation period and a study 
with a 6-month post-dose observation period. Moreover, one repeat-dose toxicity study was conducted with 
human eASC in male and female athymic nude rats (Crl:NIH-Foxn1rnu) via the intravenous route. 
Repeat dose (two weeks apart) of 2.5 x 106 cells/rat were well tolerated when administered using the perianal 
route, and there was no treatment-related mortality. A repeat dose (two weeks apart) of 5 x 106 cells/rat 
resulted in some mortality due to pulmonary embolism during or immediately after dosing. Taken together, two 
administrations of eASC two weeks apart at doses up to 2.5 x 106 cells were well tolerated in athymic nude rats 
when administered via the perianal route. There were no indications for systemic toxicity. Apart from some

mortality explained by embolism of injected cells to pulmonary vasculature, intravenous repeat-dose studies at 
dose levels up to 5 x 106 cells/rat have likewise provided no evidence of systemic toxicity.  
Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity studies are not applicable for the product, considering the cell-based nature of the product, which 
precludes interaction directly with DNA or other chromosomal material.  
Carcinogenicity 
The in vitro and in vivo studies performed to determine whether eASC could be tumourigenic. When cultured in 
vitro according to the procedure for the product, five of six eASC preparations reached a plateau in their growth 
curve between population doubling level 25 and 30 and the 6th preparation around population doubling level 40, 
marking the onset of senescence. The presence of senescent cells was confirmed by acidic ß-galactosidase 
staining. eASC preparations expanded to population doubling levels equal to levels of product for clinical use 
showed negligible telomerase activity and low c-myc expression. There was no increase in telomerase activity or 
c-myc expression during the process of expansion. Moreover, eASC preparations showed no 
anchorage-independent growth in the soft-agar test. Analysis revealed normal male or female diploid 
karyotypes. One eASC (expanded to population doubling levels equal to levels of product for clinical use) 
preparation showed increased structural aberrations but was not of clonal nature and therefore did not indicate 
a transformation. In addition, no elevated c-myc expression, no elevated senescence and no elevated 
telomerase activity were observed. In in vivo tumourigenicity tests, nude mice administered a subcutaneous 
injection of eASC at various population doubling levels, equal to levels of product for clinical use, all survived to 
scheduled sacrifice and no tumour-formation was observed. 
Reproduction toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been performed for Alofisel because preclinical 
biodistribution studies indicated no migration and integration of eASC into reproductive organs following 
administration of eASC via different routes. This was considered acceptable by the CAT. 
Local tolerance  
Local tolerance evaluation was included in the single and repeat-dose toxicity studies for the product. In the 
repeat-dose toxicology studies in which cells were administered through the perianal route, a slight 
oedema/erythema lasting between 48-72 h post-injection was noted at the injection site of most animals 
including controls. Microscopically, aggregates of mesenchymal cells (presumably areas of injected cells) and 
focal or multifocal granulation tissue were noted in rectal submucosa and to a lesser extent in adventitia, 
suggesting a host reaction. Overall, the treatment shows a good local tolerance.

NK-cells degranulation rates in response to eASC 
were very low and not statistically significant 
compared with unstimulated NK cells. HLA class I 
blocking was performed and results indicated 
that antibody mediated masking of HLA class I 
did not increase NK cell degranulation against 
eASC. 
When purified NK cells were cultured with eASC 
or K562 (positive control cell line susceptible to 
NK lysis) during 72 hours, IFN-γ production was 
observed. 
eASC were able to delay or block the maturation 
to the terminally differentiated effector stage. 
This modulation of T cell maturation is 
independent of being autologous or allogeneic. A 
second exposure to eASC is not sufficiently 
immunogenic for peripheral blood lymphocytes 
to generate terminally differentiated effector 
cells. No signals of generation of specific T cell 
memory against eASC were seen. 
Studies in Support of the Choice of Animal Model 
Method 
A study was conducted in immunocompetent rats, to assess the potential rejection of human eASC 
(MG/0069/05). Three groups of female Sprague-Dawley rats (n=5 per group) randomly received a single 
intradermal injection of vehicle, eASC preparation at a dose level of 1 x 106 cells (100 µl cell suspension) or 
human keratinocytes which acted as the positive control. 
Results 
All rats injected with eASC or human keratinocytes showed oedema and erythema at the injection site. The 
occurrence of oedema/erythema was somewhat more pronounced in the group treated with keratinocytes. 
Microscopic examination of the injection site revealed intradermal and/or subcutaneous inflammation, mainly 
consisting of lymphocyte infiltrates. Granuloma formation was often observed in the central area of the 
inflammatory lesion. These findings were recorded in one of two eASC-treated females sacrificed on day 7 and 
in all eASC-treated females euthanised on day 14. Inflammation at the injection site was also noted in all human 
keratinocyte-treated females at the two time points. 
Although the elimination of cells was not confirmed by immunohistochemical means, the inflammation at the 
injection site was considered to indicate potential rejection of the human cells by the immunocompetent rats.

Data generated in other toxicity studies show low potential for T-cell mediated eASC recognition, in vitro and 
delayed NK cell mediated elimination. In addition, capacity of eASC preparations to differentiate into osteocytes 
or adipocytes was shown to decline with an increase in population doubling level. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Alofisel is a suspension for injection containing expanded human allogeneic mesenchymal adult stem cells 
extracted from adipose tissue.  
The environmental risk presented by darvadstrocel (eASC), due to their human origin that is not altered during 
the manufacturing process, the excipients and the potential impurities of Alofisel is considered as negligible. 
The applicant has provided an ERA including the CV of the expert and provided adequate justification for not 
performing any studies. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
Alofisel has been developed to reduce inflammation in perianal fistulas and thus allowing repair and healing to 
take place. To this end, the in vitro pharmacology program has uncovered numerous immunosuppressive 
functions including, increased IDO activity, TLR/IFNγ activation and the induction of regulatory T cells. In vivo, 
no model for anal fistulas was used to provide proof-of-concept data. This was agreed by the CHMP during the 
2011 scientific advice. Instead, an experimental model of colitis was used to show the effect of eASC in an 
inflamed gut and the data provide evidence for proof-of-concept in this model.  
A total of 3 biodistribution studies were performed in male and female athymic nude rats. When cells were 
administered using the perianal + intrarectal route or the intravenous route, human genomic DNA was detected 
at day 1/2 and day 14. The biodistribution of eASC injected using the perianal + intrarectal route was restricted 
to the rectum (high signal) and jejunum. When eASC were administered intravenously, human genomic DNA 
was detected at a high level in lungs of almost all treated athymic rats, which is to be expected when using this 
route.  
There is no information on the likely pathways of homing, migration and elimination of eASCs cells once they 
enter the systemic circulation in patients with Crohn’s Disease. The perineum is a very vascular area and eASC 
cells may enter the circulation inadvertently through blood vessels & capillaries adjacent to the site of injection, 
despite the pull-back aspiration procedure used being negative. The potential distribution, homing & persistence 
is important to understand to determine the sites potentially at risk of serious adverse reactions such as 
persistence of cells with subsequent mutagenesis or tumourogenicity. Ectopic tissue formation and 
tumourigenicity has therefore been included in the RMP as important potential risk and will be followed up with 
the agreed post-authorisation safety study (PASS). 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been performed for Alofisel because preclinical 
biodistribution studies indicated no migration and integration of eASC into reproductive organs following 
administration of eASC via different routes. 
Data from toxicology studies show that single doses of 5 x 106 cells/rat were well tolerated when administered 
via the intravenous or subcutaneous route. After perianal + intrarectal or intravaginal administration, the 
administered dose of 2.5 x 106 cells was also well tolerated. In one of the GLP single-dose toxicity study an 
intravenous dose of 10 x 106 cells was associated with mortality and moribund sacrifice during or immediately 
after dosing, related to pulmonary embolism. The risk for pulmonary effects is also strengthen by the 
biodistribution data which show that cells administered systemically have the ability to distribute to the lungs 
Assessment report

however it is agreed with the applicant that these findings are of limited relevance to humans due to the local 
clinical administration. No findings indicate effects on central nervous system or cardiovascular functions.  
The likelihood of interference of other commonly administered medications on the pharmacodynamics of eASC 
was investigated in vitro. Inhibition of TNF-α with infliximab did not alter the inhibitory effect of eASC on 
activated peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation. Incubation with MTX did not significantly 
affect the viability or proliferation of eASC. Furthermore, MTX and AZA did not affect eASC-mediated inhibition 
of PBMC proliferation. 
 It is recommended however that the treatment administration procedure be carried out under general or 
regional anaesthesia. Since Alofisel and local anaesthetics would be administered in close proximity and the 
effect of local anaesthetics on the injected cells is unknown, the proposed SmPC contains a statement that local 
anaesthesia is not recommended. 
In vitro and in vivo studies were performed to determine whether eASC could be tumourigenic. None of these 
studies indicate a risk for tumourigenicity. However, the relevant use of human cells in immunocompromised 
animals can be questioned (especially since the cells do not appear to persist for very long) in relation to this 
risk.  This data will be supplemented with long-term follow-up of tumour formation in patients administered 
Cx601 (Alofisel) under a Post Approval Safety Study (as described in the RMP) which will follow patients for up 
to five years post administration with primary outcomes of safety including tumourgenicity, ectopic tissue 
formation and immunogenicity which is endorsed.      
In other safety studies eASC showed low potential for T-cell recognition and the capacity of eASC to differentiate 
into osteocytes or adipocytes were reduced with population doublings. The effect of ex vivo expansion on the 
genetic stability of cells has been assessed in vitro without any indication of carcinogenic potential.  
The CHMP endorse the CAT discussion on the non-clinical aspects as described above. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety pharmacology and toxicology programs are considered sufficient 
for marketing authorisation. Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional 
studies of safety pharmacology and repeated dose toxicity. This application is approvable from a nonclinical 
point of view. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusions on the non-clinical aspects as described above.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No clinical pharmacokinetic studies (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) have been performed 
during the development program of Alofisel. Conventional studies of absorption, distribution, metabolism and 
excretion are not considered relevant in accordance with the CHMP guideline on human cell-based medicinal 
products (EMA/CHMP/410869/2006). 
For results on biodistribution studies please refer to the non-clinical part of this assessment report. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The proposed mechanism of action for allogeneic eASC is based on immune modulatory and anti-inflammatory 
properties. Anal fistulas typically present as fissures penetrating the intestinal lumen and perianal skin surface, 
and are characterised by local inflammation that is exacerbated by bacterial infection(s) and faecal 
contamination. In the inflamed area, there is lymphocyte activation and local release of inflammatory cytokines. 
Inflammatory cytokines, in particular IFN-γ produced by activated immune cells (i.e., lymphocytes), activate 
eASC in a mechanism which requires induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expression. Once activated, 
eASC suppress proliferation of lymphocytes and inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This 
immunoregulatory activity reduces inflammation, which may allow the tissues around the fistula tract to heal. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No conventional PD studies have been performed. Information regarding the mechanism of action of Alofisel has 
been obtained from nonclinical studies. A summary of the known information is provided below.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/64055/2018

Mesenchymal stem cells are known to possess immunomodulatory properties and to regulate the function 
(proliferation, activation and effector function) of a broad number of immune cells, including B-lymphocytes, 
T-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils (Bernardo and 
Fibbe, 2013; Le Blanc, 2012). 
In vitro studies that were conducted to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the 
immunomodulatory effects of Alofisel showed the following: 
− Co-incubation of activated peripheral blood lymphocytes and eASC resulted in inhibition of T-lymphocyte 
proliferation (both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets), in a dose-dependent fashion. eASC are activated by inflammatory 
mediators (principally interferon-gamma) produced by actively proliferating lymphocytes. In response to 
interferon-gamma, eASC induce the expression of the cytoplasmic enzyme, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 
(IDO). IDO mediates the degradation of tryptophan and the accumulation of kynurenine. The depletion of 
tryptophan and the accumulation of kynurenine in the surrounding milieu affects T-lymphocytes (and other 
immune cells) and results in inhibition of T cell function and proliferation (De La Rosa et al., 2009; Menta et al., 
2014). 
-Regulatory T cells (CD4+CD25+Foxp3+) play a crucial role in the principle tenance of self-tolerance and in the 
prevention of autoimmune diseases. Regulatory T cells have been shown to inhibit T cell proliferation, cytokine 
production, autoantibody production and dendritic cell and monocyte/macrophage function (Pittenger et al., 
1999; Ishimura et al., 2008).Exposure of activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells to eASC results in an 
inhibition of their proliferation together with an increase in the number of regulatory T cells through a 
mechanism that requires the enzymatic activity of IDO. 
-When activated peripheral blood lymphocytes were co-cultured with eASC, production of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines (e.g. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) was reduced and production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. 
IL-10) was increased (De La Rosa et al., 2009). 
An adequate animal model of fistulas for conduct of in vivo efficacy studies is not available. The efficacy of eASC 
(total intra-peritoneal doses of 0.3 million cells or 1 million cells) has been investigated, however, in the 
TNBS-induced colitis model (Gonzalez et al., 2009).The following was demonstrated:  
− Reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-6, IL-1beta, and IL-12) and 
chemokines (RANTES and macrophage inhibitory protein 2) and increased levels of the anti-inflammatory 
cytokine, IL-10, were observed in the colons of Alofisel-treated mice in comparison with the colons of untreated 
mice.  
− Increased numbers of regulatory T cells (CD4+ CD25+Foxp3+) were observed in the mesenteric lymph nodes 
of eASC-treated mice. Purification ex vivo of CD4+ T cells (comprising CD4+ inflammatory cells and regulatory 
T cells) from eASC-treated mice and injection into TNBS colitic mice, reduced the severity of colitis, showing that 
the regulatory T cells generated or activated during eASC treatment have therapeutic effect in vivo.  
-A dose-dependent reduction in body weight loss was observed. Administration of eASC was also associated with 
increased survival relative to vehicle-treated mice.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Due to the nature of the product, and the topical route of administration, conventional pharmacokinetic studies 
of  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism  and  excretion  (ADME)  were  not  performed  which  is  considered 
acceptable.

It is not currently possible to track the biodistribution of eASC when topically applied in humans, the Applicant 
has provided a discussion with supporting preclinical studies & literature outlining the current evidence for the 
likely length of persistence of eASC in humans and the tumourigenicity and ectopic tissue formation are followed 
up as important potential risks in the RMP (please refer to discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
In vitro interaction studies and data from the clinical trials to examine the potential effect of immunosuppressant 
treatment on viability and immunomodulatory properties of the cells in vivo did not indicate an effect. 
The CHMP endorsed the CAT discussion on the Clinical pharmacology as described above. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The marketing authorisation application is approvable from a pharmacology point of view. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the Clinical pharmacology as described 
above. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No separate dose response studies have been performed. The selected dose (120 x 106 cells) is based on data 
from the supportive Phase I/IIa study Cx601-0101 where one fistula per patient was treated. The initial dose of 
20x106 cells was considered sub-optimal since only 8 of 21 responded to the treatment. Following a second 
higher dose of 40x106 cells the numbers of responding patients increased. Since up to three fistulas were 
intended to be treated in the pivotal study and the dose should be distributed between the areas, a three-fold 
increase of the dose was considered relevant. The chosen dose was administered to all patients independent of 
numbers and complexity/size of fistulas. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
A phase III, randomised, double blind, parallel group, placebo controlled, multicentre study to 
assess efficacy and safety of expanded allogeneic adipose-derived stem cells (eASC) for the 
treatment of perianal fistulising Crohn’s disease over a period of 24 weeks and an extended 
follow-up period up to 104 weeks (ADMIRE-CD study).

Continuation of previous treatment was allowed and was to be maintained at stable doses (anti-TNFs, 
immunosuppressants (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate), 5-ASA, and medication for other 
diseases). Oral corticosteroids were required to be tapered and discontinued 4 weeks prior to Visit 0 (day of 
treatment with IMP).  
Patients with flares of luminal CD were permitted to use an oral steroid starting with prednisone/prednisolone at 
40 mg, or equivalent, and tapering over 12 weeks.  
According to the study protocol, if the patient required a new immunosuppressant or new anti-TNF agent, or 
required higher doses of their existing immunosuppressant or anti-TNF medication compared to baseline, the 
patient was to be withdrawn and considered a treatment failure. 
Treatments 
All fistulas were treated (drainage, curettage and setons as clinically indicated) before treatment with Alofisel 
(week -3 and at baseline). 
The patients received either: 
•  Alofisel 120 x106 cells (24 mL containing 5x106 cells/mL) by intralesional injection 
• 
Placebo (saline) by intralesional injection at a volume of 24 mL 
The active and placebo products were administered and divided between the internal openings and external 
openings of the fistulas, with half of the suspension administered into the tissue surrounding the internal 
opening(s) and the other half administered along the walls of the fistula tract(s). 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Alofisel compared to placebo for the 
treatment of perianal fistulising CD over 24, 52 and 104 weeks. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was defined as combined remission of perianal fistulising CD and absence of collections > 
2 cm of the treated fistula confirmed by MRI images, at week 24. Remission was defined as clinical closure of 
external openings that were draining at baseline despite gentle finger compression. The MRI images were 
evaluated by a central laboratory that was blinded to the individual patients’ treatment and visit. A collection > 
2 cm was considered to be present if at least two out of the three dimensions assessed were > 2 cm. Collections 
larger than 2 cm that remain despite drainage at baseline are considered to be predictive of treatment relapses.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/64055/2018 
Page 33/87 
  
  
The MRI images were evaluated by a central laboratory. However, MRI investigations of presence of collections 
>2 cm were assessed both locally and centrally, although only the central reading was considered for the 
assessments of the primary outcome. 
The assessment of the fistulas was performed by, not only the principal investigator, but also by a second 
gastroenterologist/surgeon that was blinded to the treatment (was not involved in the treatment and had no 
access to the patient’s records). In case of divergent classifications, the opinion of the second 
gastroenterologist/surgeon was used.  
Key secondary endpoints were:  
•  Clinical remission (closure of all external openings that were draining at baseline despite gentle finger 
pressure compression) at week 24 
•  Clinical response (closure of ≥ 50 % of external openings) at week 24, defined as one opening closed if 
the numbers of openings at baseline were one or two, and two openings closed if there were three 
openings at baseline 
The clinical assessment of closure was performed as for the primary efficacy endpoint.  
Secondary endpoints included time to clinical remission/response, relapse, time to relapse, changes in the 
Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI), IBDQ scores for quality of life evaluations, Crohn’s Disease Activity Index 
(CDAI) and van Assche Score (MRI based score of perianal fistulas). 
Sample size 
The sample size calculation was based on a previous open-label Phase I/II trial (Cx601-0101) performed with 
Cx601 and published efficacy rates for placebo in clinical trials with anti-TNFs for the treatment of fistulas in 
patients with CD. 
Placebo efficacy rates ranged from 23% to 26% (response) and from 13% to 19% (remission of perianal 
fistulising disease) and preliminary results of a previous phase II trial (Cx601-0101) showed that Cx601 showed 
a fistula closure rate between 53.3% and 56.3%. 
With this information, the initial sample size was assumed with a minimum 25% efficacy rate for placebo; and 
a minimum 50% of efficacy rate for Cx601. However, it was difficult to estimate the placebo effect in this phase 
III study, because the standard curettage procedure performed for all patients was expected to increase the 
remission of perianal fistulising disease rate in the placebo group; and so the sample size approach was focused 
in a safer scenario covering for a potential higher placebo effect (efficacy rates symmetrically as close as 
possible to 50% while respecting the expected difference of 25%; i.e., 37.5% vs. 62.5% for placebo and Cx601, 
respectively). 
Response rates were used for the sample size calculation of the study as there are no data available with respect 
to remission of perianal fistulising disease rates in previous studies with eASC. However, it was estimated that 
the difference between placebo and Cx601 would be maintained (either assessed by response or remission) 
because Cx601 would also benefit from the standard curettage procedure, and this maintenance of the 
difference related to remission rates had been observed in previous clinical trials with anti-TNFs. 
In summary, the planned sample size to be screened was around 278 patients in order to randomize at least 208 
patients (104 receiving Cx601 and 104 receiving placebo; assuming a screening failure rate of 25%). This 
sample size was considered statistically able to detect a minimum 25% difference in the percentage of patients 
Assessment report

with remission of perianal fistulising disease confirmed by MRI, between Cx601 and placebo (α=0.025; β=0.20; 
power=80%), including a 20% of premature withdrawals. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive Cx601 or placebo. Treatments were automatically allocated to a 
treatment group by the eCRF according to a pre-established randomization list held by the Sponsor, using a 
stratified allocation with the following criteria: 
•  Concomitant anti-TNF treatment (yes / no). 
•  Concomitant immunosuppressants treatment (yes / no). 
Blinding (masking) 
Since there were visual differences between the active and placebo product a fully blinded study was not 
deemed practicable. Consequently, a plan for blinding was presented at each site. It was agreed and signed 
before patients were randomised. The double-blind was preserved by having one Investigator (surgeon) who 
administered the treatment and another Investigator who evaluated the fistula(s) in a blinded fashion. Surgeons 
were not permitted to share information about the treatment administered in the surgery procedure with the 
investigator(s) responsible for following up the patient, but they were to identify the treated fistula (with a 
drawing) in order to allow the investigator to assess the efficacy and safety during the study visits. Surgeons 
who administered the treatments were not allowed to participate in any clinical assessment of the same 
patient’s fistula during the study. 
Investigators responsible for the patient assessments and the patients remained blinded to the patients’ 
treatment allocation up to the Week 52 analysis. The Sponsor was unblinded from the time-point of the primary 
efficacy analysis at Week 24. Individual patient’s treatment allocation was unblinded to investigator site staff 
and patients after the Week 52 analysis. 
Statistical methods 
The following analysis populations were defined for the study analyses: 
All Screened Patients 
The All Screened Patients population included all patients who attended a screening visit. This population was 
used for summary of screening failures. 
Safety Population 
The Safety Population included all the patients who received the study treatment. The Safety Population is the 
primary analysis set for safety analyses. Safety analyses were performed with patients grouped according to the 
actual treatment received. 
Intention-to-Treat Population 
The Intention-to-Treat (ITT) Population included all randomised patients, regardless of their having received the 
study treatment or having any post-baseline measurements. The ITT Population was the primary analysis set for 
efficacy analyses. Efficacy analyses were performed with patients grouped according to the randomised 
treatment assigned. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/64055/2018 
Page 35/87 
  
  
Modified Intention to Treat Population 
The Modified ITT (mITT) Population included all randomised patients who received the study treatment and for 
whom at least one post-baseline efficacy value was present, independent of the degree of adherence to the 
protocol. Analyses of all efficacy variables were repeated in the mITT Population for supportive purposes. 
Efficacy analyses were performed with patients grouped according to the randomised treatment assigned. 
Per-protocol Population 
The Per-protocol (PP) Population included all randomised patients who adhered to the protocol with no major 
deviations. The primary efficacy analysis (Combined Remission at Week 24) and the key secondary efficacy 
analyses (i.e., Clinical Remission and Response by Week 24) were repeated in the PP Population for supportive 
purposes. Efficacy analyses were performed with patients grouped according to the actual treatment received. 
Two PP populations were defined, one based on patients without major deviations in clinical assessments and 
MRI evaluations and used for analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint and a second based on patients without 
major deviations in clinical assessments and used for analysis of the key secondary efficacy endpoints. 
The final population definitions were agreed and documented at the blind data review meeting prior to 
unblinding. 
Multiplicity 
Inference was based on the primary endpoint only on the ITT analysis set. No adjustments for multiple 
comparisons were made for the primary endpoint in the others populations (e.g. mITT, PP). Multiplicity 
adjustments for analyses of the two key secondary endpoints for which the primary efficacy endpoint serves as 
the gatekeeper. The primary efficacy variable was assessed with statistical significance at a two-sided type I 
error (α) level of 0.025. For the key secondary variables a significance level of 0.05 was applied. Statistical 
testing on key secondary endpoints was only to be performed if the primary endpoint was significant by 2.5% 
level. 
Analysis Methods 
The Combined Remission percentage of perianal fistulising CD by Week 24 was compared between treatment 
groups using a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (CMH), adjusting for the randomisation strata. 
The primary analysis was based on an ITT approach where any patient that recorded a missing value was 
imputed as a non-response. However, in case of missing clinical assessment by Week 24, the last observation 
carried forward (LOCF) from the latest earlier post-baseline visit (including an Early Termination Visit, if 
applicable) applied. In case of missing MRI data by Week 24, if there was an MRI at an Early Termination Visit 
prior to Week 24 then LOCF applied to this MRI.  
If any of the rescue events specified below occurred, the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints were 
imputed as a non-response, overriding all other imputation conventions. Rescue events were considered only for 
primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints at Week 24 in the following circumstances: 
•  Corticoids at 40 mg prednisone equivalent, for at least 12 weeks (non-response is imputed after 12 
weeks of concomitant therapy) 
•  New anti-TNF (new compared to the baseline add-on therapy of the study) for at least 8 weeks 
(non-response imputed after 8 weeks of concomitant therapy). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/64055/2018 
Page 36/87 
  
  
•  New immunosuppressant (new compared to the baseline therapy of the study) for at least 12 weeks 
(non-response imputed after 12 weeks of concomitant therapy). 
•  Surgical procedure of the treated fistula during the treatment period (non-response after the surgical 
procedure). 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total 19.3 % of patients discontinued before week 24 and 15.6 % discontinued between week 24 and 52. The 
proportion of discontinuations was similar between the two arms up to week 24 and between week 24 and 52 
there were more patients discontinuing from the placebo group as compared with the active group. The major 
reasons for discontinuations were AEs/SAEs, clinical deterioration and need for new perianal surgery. 
Of screened patients, there were 77 that were considered screening failures, see  Table 4.

Conduct of the study 
There have been five protocol amendments. 
Amendment 1 (October 2012). Included clarifications of the study procedure and the length of the study was 
increased from 24 to 52 weeks. 
Amendment 2 (May 2013). Update concerned visit procedures (additional immunological sampling for 
alloreactivity) and the informed consent process. 
Amendment 3 (November 2013). This was an administrative change concerning prolongation of the enrolment 
period to allow for sufficient numbers of patients to be included. 
Amendment 4 (June 2014). This amendment included further increases of the length of the enrolment period 
and clarification for reasons for study completion (eCRF). 
Amendment 5 (December 2014). The follow-up period was increased to be 104 weeks. Further changes included 
clarification of statistical analyses. 
Amendment 6 (May 2016). some points of the protocol might lead to potential misunderstandings and needed 
to be further clarified. Additionally, there were in the protocol some omissions that needed to be corrected for a 
correct understanding and compliance. 
The final SAP (dated 22 July 2015) was finalised and signed before the 24 analyses.

Table 7: 
Distribution of internal and external openings (ITT population) 
There were no major differences between the groups with regard to baseline demographic data or data related 
to Crohn’s disease.  
The numbers of included patients > 65 years was limited (n=7). 
The majority of patients were receiving concomitant CD medication at baseline. However, approximately 24 % 
of the actively treated and 18 % of placebo treated patients did not receive concomitant treatment with either 
immunosuppressants and/or anti-TNF.  
The majority of patients had 1 EO, 54 % in the Alofisel group and almost 70 % in the placebo group. Further, the 
proportion of patients with ≥2 external fistula openings was limited to overall 12 patients. There are three 
criteria for the definition of complex fistula of which presence of ≥ 2 EOs is one. Ninety-four percent of the 
patients fulfilled the criteria for fistula complexity. 
Numbers analysed 
The number of patients by analysis set is shown in Table 8.

Table 8: 
Analyses populations at Week 24 
The mITT population included randomised patients that received study treatment and had at least one 
post-baseline efficacy value recorded.  
The PP population included randomised, treated patients with post baseline MRI and fistula assessment, and 
who adhered to the protocol with no major deviations that affected the primary endpoint. 
The definition of the secondary PP population (PP2) was similar to that of the PP population but patients had no 
major deviations that affected the key secondary endpoints. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
Table 9: 
Combined Remission of Perianal Fistulising Crohn’s Disease by Week 24 (ITT 
Population) 
There was a statistically significant difference between the numbers of patients in combined remission in the 
active and placebo groups at week 24. The estimated difference between the groups was 15.2 %.  
Supportive analyses (post-hoc) of combined remission have been performed using the thresholds of collections 
> 1.2 cm, > 1.5 cm and > 1.7 cm after re-reading of the MRIs. The results show a consistent difference between 
the active and the placebo treatment irrespective of cut-off point used, see the table below.

The Applicant also performed supportive analyses to evaluate the impact of relapses (imputed as failures) on the 
clinical outcome. The results were supportive of the primary analyses. 
A sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint using the local assessment of the MRI has been performed that 
was supportive of the primary analysis where the central reading was used.

Ancillary analyses 
Comparison of Results in Sub-populations at Week 24 
Subpopulation analyses were performed in the ITT patient population of clinical study Cx601-0302 to evaluate 
factors that may influence the efficacy of Alofisel. The following subpopulations were evaluated:  
• Stratification factors: concomitant treatment at randomisation visit with anti-TNF agents only, or with 
immunosuppressants (azathioprine, methotrexate or 6-mercaptopurine) only, or with anti-TNF agents plus 
immunosuppressants or with neither anti-TNF agents nor immunosuppressants.  
• Age: <65 years or ≥65 years.  
• Gender: male or female.  
• Race: Caucasian, Black, Asian, or other.  
• Smoking status: current smoker, ex-smoker or non-smoker.  
• Duration of antibiotic use between preparation visit and administration of IMP: <7 days or ≥ 7 days.  
• Topography of external and internal openings: 1 internal opening plus 1 external opening or 1 internal opening 
plus ≥2 external openings or 2 internal openings (irrespective of number of external openings).  
• Topography of external openings: 1 external opening or 2 external openings or 3 external openings.  
• Topography of internal openings: 1 internal opening or 2 internal openings.  
• Dose per external/internal opening: dose equal to 12 mL/external opening and any dose/internal opening, or 
dose equal to 6 mL/external opening and ≥12 mL/internal opening, or dose equal to 6 mL/external opening and 
≤6 mL/internal opening, or dose equal to 4 mL/external opening and any dose/internal opening.  
• Country: France, Spain, Italy or all other countries.  
Analyses of baseline features and disease characteristics (including gender, sole immunosuppressant use, 
duration of prophylactic antibiotic use, country), as well as time since CD diagnosis (> 10 y / ≤10 y), the fistula 
type (Parks classification), any collections at screening > 2 cm (drained), CDAI at baseline (>150 /≤150), and 
concomitant medication) did not show a significant effect on the response to Alofisel treatment, based on the 
current dataset.

Supportive study 
The supportive study Cx601-0101was an open-labelled pilot study to assess the safety and efficacy of Alofisel in 
the treatment of complex perianal fistulas in perianal Crohn’s disease. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were 
appropriate. Patients in this supportive study could be naïve to fistula treatments and were not required to be 
refractory to antibiotics or immunosuppressants or to anti-TNF agents. During the study period patients were 
treated with standard care excluding infliximab or any other anti-TNF, tacrolimus or cyclosporine. 
The patients received intralesional administration of Cx601 (eASCs) 20x106 cells at day 0 and for patients with 
incomplete closure of the fistula at week 12, a second dose of Cx601 containing 40x106 cells was administered. 
Injections followed surgery standards including curettage with special emphasis of intersphincteric tracts and 
closure of internal openings with a stitch. 
The primary endpoint was the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Secondary endpoints 
included the following safety variables: serious TEAEs, treatment-related serious TEAEs, TEAEs leading to 
withdrawal, changes in laboratory parameters and vital signs. Evaluations at weeks 12 and 24 were performed 
to evaluate reduction of numbers of draining fistulas, increased numbers of closed fistula, closure of external 
openings, MRI fistula healing, luminal relapse, PDAI, CDAI and MRI Score of Severity.  
Baseline demographic data are presented in the table below.

Table 20:  Reduction in the number of draining fistulas at 12 and 24 weeks. Per protocol   and 
Safety/Full analysis populations 
All 24 patients received Alofisel at a dose of 20 million cells and 15 patients received a second dose. The second 
dose of Alofisel was 40 million cells for all patients except for one, who received a second dose of 20 million cells. 
In the evaluation of the efficacy of Alofisel following the second dose, this patient is included with the patients 
who received doses of 40 million cells. 
Absence of collections >2 cm was reported in 100% of patients at 12 and 24 weeks, in both the per protocol and 
the full analysis populations. 
At week 12, following a dose of 20x106 cells, 38 % (8/21) had closure of the external opening (assessed 
clinically) and 29% (6/21) had an increase in the number of closed fistulas (assessed clinically and 
radiologically). Of the nine patients that received one dose only, closure of external openings were observed in 
50 % (4/8) at week 12 and in 100 % (4/4) at week 24. Corresponding figures for patients receiving two doses 
were 31 % (4/13) week 12 and 42% (5/12) week 24.   
No patients presented luminal relapse at 12 weeks in any of the two populations. At 24 weeks, 5 patients 
reported luminal relapse (22.7% and 20.8% of patients in the per protocol and full analysis populations 
respectively). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The present application concerns the use of expanded human allogenic stem cells extracted from adipose tissue 
(Cx601, Alofisel) in the treatment of complex perianal fistula(s) in adult patients with non-active/mildly active 
luminal Crohn’s disease, when fistula(s) have shown an inadequate response to at least one conventional or 
biologic therapy. 
No formal dose response study has been performed. In support of efficacy, the results of one pivotal Phase III 
study (Cx601-0302) and one Phase I/IIa supportive study (study Cx601-0101) has been submitted.  
The dose was based on the results from the supportive study where one fistula was treated. All patients received 
20x106 cells at day 0 and for patients with incomplete closure of the fistula at week 12; a second dose 40x106 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/64055/2018

was administered. In the pivotal study, patients with up to three fistulas were to be treated and it was reasoned 
that three times the second dose 40x106 used in the supportive study was expected to be sufficient 
The use of a fixed dose, regardless of numbers and tract size of fistulas has been further discussed. Since it is 
not feasible to measure the length of single fistula tracts, the dose selected is based on data from the phase II 
supporting study, although the number of patients was limited. Analyses have been presented of the outcome 
of the primary endpoint in subpopulations with different numbers of internal and external openings. No 
consistent differences are revealed in numbers with combined remission at week 24. 
The pivotal study was a double-blind placebo-controlled study in patients with CD and complex fistulas 
refractory to conventional therapy. Following initial surgical treatment (including draining of collections, 
curettage and setons when appropriate), the patients were treated with intralesional injections with either 
Alofisel or placebo. Thereafter patients were clinically assessed every sixth week up to week 24 when also a MRI 
assessment was performed. The primary efficacy endpoint was combined remission that included clinical closure 
of external openings and absence of collection > 2 cm as visualized by MRI at week 24.  
The primary endpoint was recommended by CHMP to be defined as complete closure of fistulas (complete 
healing with complete MRI based closure of the fistulas) and maintenance of closed fistulas without the 
development of new fistulas (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/240241/2011). The Applicant chose to use a cut-off i.e. MRI 
confirmed absence of collections > 2 cm rather than complete closure of fistula. The Company has clarified that 
there is no established criteria available defining complete fistula healing on MRI. A threshold of 2 cm is of 
relevance since in the absence of clinical symptoms, persistence of smaller collections should not be considered 
as failures. Further, inclusion of this criterion as part of the primary endpoint adds stringency to the endpoint, 
since in patients where drainage has been achieved persistence of large abscesses predicts long-term failures. 
Further, the minimum size of collections that can be reliably measured on the MRI is > 0.8 cm. Additional 
analyses have been presented of combined remission in the ITT population using cut-off points from 1.2 to 2 cm. 
The new analyses support that there is a statistically and clinically relevant consistent difference in combined 
remission between active and placebo treatment irrespective of cut-off point used, which is reassuring 
Clarifications were requested regarding the appropriateness of the studied population in relation to fulfilment of 
the different inclusion criteria. With regards to the fulfilment of criteria for complex fistulas this has been further 
clarified. Complex fistulas are defined as high (high intersphincteric or high transsphincteric or extrasphincteric 
or suprasphincteric origin of the fistula tract), may have multiple external openings, may be associated with the 
presence of pain or fluctuation to suggest a perianal abscess, may be associated with the presence of a 
rectovaginal fistula, may be associated with the presence of an anorectal stricture, and may be associated with 
the presence of active rectal disease at endoscopy (Sandborn et al, Gastroenterology 2003). Data has been 
presented showing that ninety-four percent of the patients fulfilled the criteria for fistula complexity. Further, 
comparisons between the definition in the present study compares to the definition(s) presented in the literature 
and/or generally recognized and utilized within the profession has been presented showing that the definitions 
are comparable.  
The appearance of the active and placebo products were different due to the cell content of the active product. 
Although it was stated that all efforts were made to keep the study blinded there were differences in exposure 
between the groups that could be a result from this difference in appearance. It has been clarified that the 
exposure errors concerned eight patients of which 7 were in the placebo group. However, the patients were 
included at 7 sites in 5 different countries and is agreed that the clustering of patients to the placebo group most 
likely occurred at random.

Three GCP inspections were conducted by EMA in relation to the MAA and comprised 5 inspection sites in total, 
including clinical investigator sites, CROs and the Sponsor. The detected departures from GCP and deficiencies 
related to trial management were overall considered by the inspection team to have no impact on the inspected 
trials’ data reliability and validity. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The results from the pivotal study showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the 
numbers of patients in combined remission in the active and placebo groups. The combined remission in the 
active group was 49.5 % (53/107) (95% CI, 40.1, 59.0) and the corresponding figures in the placebo group 
were 34.5 % (36/105) (25.2, 43.4). The difference between the groups was 15.2 % at week 24. Key secondary 
endpoints were clinical remission (closure of all external openings that were draining at baseline despite gentle 
finger pressure compression) and clinical response (closure of ≥ 50 % of external openings) at week 24. The 
result was supported by the key secondary and other secondary endpoints although differences were not 
statistically significant.  
Updates for the pivotal study have been provided as part of the response to the Day 120 LoQ. This includes data 
up to Week 52. Patients were clinically assessed at weeks 36 and 52. At week 52 a MRI assessment was also 
performed. Presented data from week 52 were supportive of the primary analyses. Statistically significant 
effects in favour of Alofisel treatment is shown for combined remission, clinical remission and response. Further, 
the relapse rate in patients in clinical remission at any previous visit at week 24 was 38 % (30/79) in the active 
group and 50 % (28/56) in the placebo group. The corresponding figures at week 52 for patients with combined 
remission at week 24 were 25 % (13/52) and 44 % (15/34), respectively. Thus, the primary outcome is 
supported by data from the long-term follow-up to 52 weeks. Although there is a moderate difference between 
the treatment groups, the effect is considered to be clinically meaningful when other treatment options for 
fistulas have failed. 
For patients that were not receiving concomitant CD treatment at baseline (n=26, 24.3 %) it was not clear if 
treatment failures were connected with their current fistula. Results of post-hoc analyses have been presented 
showing that there was no major difference in response between patients with or without concomitant 
medication..  
Subgroup analysis was performed on subjects who were on immunosuppressive treatment at randomisation and 
subjects were only excluded from the analysis if they had received greater than 8-12 weeks rescue therapy. The 
Applicant has clarified that there were 13 patients requiring increased doses of immunosuppressants or 
anti-TNFs. Of these, four patients required an increased dose for less than 12 weeks and were not regarded as 
treatment failures. Analyses have been presented on combined remission and clinical remission at week 24 with 
treatment failure imputed after rescue medication. No obvious impact on the results was observed.  
The current data did not detect a difference in relapse rate; active treatment did not result in fewer SAEs of 
fistulas/perianal abscess as compared with placebo, as might be anticipated. This most likely should be 
interpreted as a lack of efficacy in some patients. Analyses of various baseline and disease characteristics by the 
Applicant did not indicate any significant interactions, though the proportion of patients with multiple tract 
fistulas in the Alofisel group (44.8%) was noted to be numerically higher than in the Control group (29.6%), 
which might have somewhat disfavoured the active group. 
The potential impact of SAEs of fistulas/perianal abscess has been further evaluated by imputing failure to 
treatment for all patients with TESAEs connected with fistulas and abscesses. Results for combined remission 
Assessment report

and clinical remission at weeks 24 and 52 are supportive of the primary analyses showing statistically significant 
differences between the treatment groups. 
The lack of data specifically on closure of internal fistula openings (IOs) was also questioned and it was clarified 
by the applicant that this relates to the limited sensitivity of the MRI and the surgical investigative approach of 
IOs that could interfere with healing. The explanation was considered acceptable by the CAT. 
Considering week 24 data only there were uncertainties with regard to the clinical benefit of the treatment also 
considering that there was a minimal change in PDAI score and no observed difference in the QOL before and 
after treatment with Alofisel, which were measured as secondary endpoints of the study. The applicant could 
demonstrate that although the reductions in PDAI score are limited, the reductions remain at similar levels 
throughout week 52 with maintained differences between the groups. There was a reduction in both the active 
and placebo group, in the placebo group most likely due to the initial fistula treatment. Further, with regards to 
the QOL the Applicant is pointing out that the high scores at baseline are reflective of the patient populations 
with luminal disease in remission. Also, only two of the PDAI scores are reflective of signs and symptoms of 
fistulas. The questionnaire used for estimation of QoL was based on the Inflammatory Bowel Disease 
Questionnaire (IBDQ) that includes domains applicable to luminal disease and is not reflective of perianal 
fistulas.  It was noted that there is no validated questionnaire for evaluation of QoL in connection with perianal 
fistulas. 
Data from week 104 has been submitted. For patients that completed the week 52 follow-up and entered the 
104 weeks follow-up (25 Alofisel, 15 placebo), the rate of clinical remission was 56 % and 40 % in the active and 
placebo group, respectively. However, data was limited and patient number small and unevenly distributed 
between groups.  
The supportive study was an open-labelled pilot study with the primary aim to assess the safety of expanded 
adipose derived stem cells (Cx601) in the treatment of complex perianal fistulas in adult patients with CD 
(n=24). Secondary endpoints included clinical and MRI evaluations of fistulas at weeks 12 and 24. Patients were 
treated to obtain abscess drainage and reduction of symptoms followed by intralesional injections of Cx601. The 
inclusion and exclusion criteria deviated from those in the pivotal study i.e. patients were not required to be 
refractory to antibiotics, or immunosuppressants or to anti-TNF agents and there were different definitions of 
complex fistulas in the two protocols.  
One third of patients responded to treatment at week 12. However, the numbers of patients receiving one dose 
(n=9) or two doses (n=15) are too low for any meaningful conclusions to be drawn also because patients with 
missing data were excluded from the analyses rather than being considered as failures. 
Overall, there is insufficient data available on the effect and safety of repeated Alofisel administrations, whereas 
the need for additional treatment may be anticipated in a portion of the targeted population. This issue will be 
further evaluated in the planned PASS study which is considered appropriate. The Company has further 
presented a protocol for study Cx601-0303 that has been approved by the FDA. This is an ongoing pivotal Phase 
III study for the purpose of obtaining MA in the US. This study will include a patient population similar to that of 
the EU pivotal study and the main design features are also similar. The results will thus be of value in support of 
the efficacy of Alofisel in the treatment of fistulas. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT discussion on clinical efficacy as described above.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The difference between active and placebo treated groups in combined remission was approximately 15 % at 
week 24. Data has been presented from the long-term follow-up of the pivotal study up to week 104. Data are 
supportive of a consistent and statistically significant effect of Alofisel as compared with placebo. The observed 
effect size  compared to control appears modest but is considered to be clinically meaningful as other treatment 
options for fistulas have failed. The clinical implications of the comparative incidence of anal abscess and fistula 
AEs between the groups do not appear to indicate a safety issue but rather lack of efficacy in some patients. 
Overall, the benefit-risk balance concluded to be positive from an efficacy point of view. However, considering 
the modest effect size together with the approval setting with a single pivotal study, confirmatory information on 
efficacy is considered of importance for the benefit-risk of the product and will be obtained from the ongoing 
Phase III study Cx601-303 (final CSR expected in 2022). Thus, the approval of Alofisel should be subject to the 
submission of study Cx601-303, which is similar in design to the pivotal study of this application, as an Annex 
II condition in line with Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007, as a post-authorisation follow-up of efficacy. 
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on clinical efficacy as described above. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The Safety Population consisted of all included patients who received study treatment (Alofisel or placebo in the 
pivotal study Cx601-0302 or Alofisel in the supportive study Cx601-0101). 
Overall, a total number of 236 patients were enrolled in the Alofisel clinical programme. Of these, 127 patients 
received Alofisel (103 in study Cx601-0302 and 24 in study, Cx601-0101). 
In study Cx601-0302, all but one patient in the Alofisel group received the full dose of 24 mL (i.e., 120 million 
cells); one patient received 18 mL Alofisel.  In the placebo group, 2 patients received a total of 20 mL of saline 
and 5 patients received 12 mL saline, instead of 24 mL. The median duration of follow-up (51.7 weeks and 52.0 
weeks, respectively) was very similar for the treatment groups.  
In study Cx601-0101, all 24 patients received an initial dose of 20 million cells.  Of the 15 patients who received 
a second dose of Alofisel, 14 received the intended dose of 40 million cells and one patient received 20 million 
cells. 
A summary of baseline characteristics of the pivotal Safety Population is provided in the table below. There were 
proportionally more patients in the Alofisel group with multiple-tract fistulas (46.6% in the Alofisel group versus 
30.4% for placebo).  Otherwise, the treatment groups were fairly well balanced.  
Assessment report

The population of Study Cx601-0101 was similar but patients were not allowed to receive concomitant anti-TNF 
agents.

Adverse events 
 In both studies, an AE was defined as treatment-emergent if the onset date was on or after the date of 
administration of study treatment. In study Cx601-0302, non-treatment-emergent AEs (NTEAEs) were also 
collected.  NTEAEs were further defined as procedure-emergent or non-procedure emergent.   
Procedure-emergent NTEAEs started prior to study treatment but after the first (preparatory) curettage 
procedure that was performed 2 to 3 weeks prior to the day of study treatment administration; non-treatment 
nor procedure-emergent AEs started prior to the curettage procedure (see Figure 7 below). 
NTEAEs were not collected in study Cx601-0101; patients underwent the preparatory curettage procedure on 
the same day as study treatment administration, just prior to study treatment.

Table 22:  Overall Summary of TEAEs: Pivotal Study Cx601-0302 (Safety Population) 
Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) occurring in ≥3 patients in either treatment group up to the Week 52 visit are 
presented by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) in Table 23 below.  
Overall, the proportions of patients who experienced TEAEs were comparable between the treatment groups. 
The most common events were anal abscess and proctalgia, respectively. Some TEAEs occurred in a higher 
proportion of patients in the Alofisel group than the placebo group, such as proctalgia (Alofisel: 14.6% patients; 
placebo: 11.8%), anal fistula (Alofisel: 10.7%; placebo: 7.8%), and diarrhoea (Alofisel: 8.7%; placebo: 2.9%) 
in the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC, and anal abscess (Alofisel: 19.4%; placebo: 13.7%) and nasopharyngitis 
(Alofisel: 10.7%; placebo: 4.9%) in the Infections and Infestations SOC.  
The combined frequency of ‘anal fistula’ and ‘fistula’ TEAEs was however similar in both treatment groups 
(Alofisel: 13/103 [12.6%] patients; placebo: 13/102 [12.7%]). 
Severe TEAEs were reported similarly. 
In this study, procedural pain and proctalgia were reported as both procedure-emergent non-treatment 
emergent AEs and as treatment-emergent AEs, i.e. following the administration of IMP. These events resulted 
most likely from the conditioning of the fistula considering the similarity in incidence between the Alofisel and 
placebo treatment groups. 
Treatment with Alofisel was not associated with fewer AEs or SAEs of fistula and/or abscess compared to 
placebo. In the Alofisel group, 15.0% of patients reported TESAEs of fistula/abscess up to Week 52, as 
compared to 9.5% in the control group. Such events appear to be related to lack of efficacy in individual 
patients. As there was a higher proportion of patients with multiple tract fistulas in the Alofisel group (44.8%) 
than in the Control group (29.6%), this could have somewhat disfavoured the Alofisel group. Other baseline 
features studied (gender, sole immunosuppressant use, duration of prophylactic antibiotic use and country) did 
not have a marked effect on the response treatment with Alofisel. An analysis of additional clinical

characteristics (time since CD diagnosis, fistula type, collections at screening >2cm, CDAI at baseline, and 
concomitant medication) did not show any interaction with treatment effect. 
An additional analysis of combined remission, imputing patients presenting with TEAEs of fistula/abscess as 
failures, did not impact the primary efficacy analysis conclusions.

The safety data obtained from the supportive study Cx601-0101 did not reveal any additional safety concerns 
but were too limited to allow drawing firm conclusions on the safety of repeated administration. 
Analysis of AEs of interest by organ system or syndrome 
•  Hypersensitivity/immune reactions 
Hypersensitivity was recorded for 1 Alofisel-treated patient in study Cx601-0302. This TEAE (verbatim term 
‘allergy’, no other details provided) occurred 110 days after Alofisel administration, was non-serious, of mild 
intensity and required no treatment, and was considered unrelated to study medication by the investigator. In 
addition, one placebo-treated patient in Study Cx601-0302 recorded a TEAE of ‘hypersensitive reaction due to 
infliximab treatment’ 135 days after receiving placebo that was considered unrelated to study medication.  No 
cases of treatment-emergent hypersensitivity were reported in study Cx601-0101.

EMA/CHMP/64055/2018

•  Tumourigenicity 
There were 4 cases of neoplasia (malignant plus benign) reported in Study Cx601-0302 (1 in the Alofisel group 
and 3 in the placebo group; none was considered related to study treatment). The one patient in the Alofisel 
group in study Cx601-0302 reported a TEAE of uterine leiomyoma (verbatim term, ‘worsening of pre-existing 
condition myoma’) 11 days after study treatment administration.  The event was reported to be of mild intensity 
and was not considered related to study treatment as the leiomyoma had been diagnosed prior to preparatory 
surgery. In study Cx601-0101 a patient reported a TEAE of uterine leiomyoma 82 days after receiving the first 
study treatment administration. This case also seems likely a pre-existing condition considering the short time 
line.  
• 
Infection 
Infection was not listed by the Applicant as an AE of interest. The pivotal study results do not indicate an overall 
higher frequency of infections based on System Organ Class in patients treated with Alofisel. In total, 44.7% of 
patients in the Alofisel group experienced one or more AEs in the infections or infestations SOC as compared to 
44.1% of patients in the placebo group. However, by PT, there were more events of anal abscess in the active 
treatment group up to Week 52 (19.4% of patients, 21 TEAEs in the Cx601 group, 13.7% of patients, 19 TEAEs 
in the placebo group). 
•  Procedure-related adverse events 
In study Cx601-0302, for TEAEs, relationship to surgical procedure was not specifically collected. (Investigators 
were not requested to distinguish between the surgical [curettage] procedure on the day of treatment and IMP 
administration in assessing relatedness for regular AEs.) Thus, procedural pain and proctalgia were reported as 
both procedure-emergent non-treatment emergent AEs (so-called PENTAs) and as treatment-emergent AEs, 
i.e. following the administration of IMP.  
However, TEAEs up to Week 52 that occurred following IMP administration that could be considered 
procedure-related include events of PT ‘proctalgia’ (Alofisel: 14.6%, 20 TEAEs; placebo: 11.8%, 17 TEAEs), 
‘procedural pain’ (Alofisel: < 1.0%, 1 TEAE; placebo: 2.0%, 2 TEAEs) and ‘post-procedural inflammation’ 
(Alofisel: 1.9%, 2 TEAEs; placebo: 0.0%).  Of the 37 TEAEs of proctalgia, a total of 8 were reported within 7 days 
of IMP administration and 6 of these were considered related to study treatment. All 3 TEAEs of procedural pain 
were considered related to study treatment (which could also have included the surgical procedure) and were 
reported on the same day or the day after IMP administration.  The cases of post-procedural inflammation were 
reported by the investigator as either induration around the seton or swelling at the site of the seton placement 
and occurred between 6 weeks and 3 months after IMP administration; neither was considered related to study 
treatment. Considering the similarity in incidence between the Alofisel and placebo treatment groups e.g. for 
proctalgia a statement was included in section 4.4 and 4.8 that events of proctalgia and procedural pain have 
been reported as a result of the conditioning of the fistula. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no treatment-emergent deaths reported during in study Cx601-0302, either up to the Week 52 visit 
or between the Week 52 visit and the data cut-off for SAEs of 30 June 2016. There were no deaths reported in 
study Cx601-0101. Treatment-emergent SAEs in study Cx601-0302 up to the Week 52 visit are summarised in 
the table below.

Table 24: 
Treatment-Emergent SAEs up to Week 52 in ≥2 Patients Overall - Pivotal  
Study  Cx601-0302 (Safety Population) 
Up to the Week 52 visit, 46 patients (22.4%) experienced 57 TESAE.  Most of these were experienced by one 
patient each. Anal abscess, anal fistula, and Crohn’s Disease were the only TESAEs that were experienced by 2 
or more patients in either treatment group. 
Anal abscess was reported as a TESAE in more patients in the Alofisel group than the placebo group (Alofisel: 
13.6% patients, 14 TESAEs; placebo: 7.8% patients, 9 TESAEs), as was anal fistula (Alofisel: 3.9% patients, 4 
TESAEs; placebo: <1.0% patients, 1 TESAE).  
The investigator’s assessment of causal relationship to study treatment and causal relationship to the surgical 
procedure was not collected for treatment-emergent regular (nonserious) AEs but was collected for 
treatment-emergent SAEs on the SAE form.  
Of the Alofisel-treated patients, 7/14 TESAEs of anal abscess were considered related to study treatment by the 
investigator and 4/14 were reported as severe.  In the placebo group, 5/9 TESAEs of anal abscess were 
considered related and 4/9 were reported as severe. 
In the Alofisel group, TESAEs considered by the investigator to be related to the surgical procedure were mostly 
anal abscess (6 of the 14 cases); an additional TESAE of groin abscess was also considered to be related.  In the 
placebo group, TESAEs considered by the investigator to be related to the surgical procedure included 3 of the 
9 cases of anal abscess, and one case each of anal inflammation, fistula, and liver abscess.  
Most of the SAEs in the Alofisel group (10 out of 14 cases of anal abscess SAEs and all 4 cases of fistula SAEs) 
were reported to have occurred in the same fistula that was treated with Alofisel, in most cases a rather long 
time (~1-10 months) after the procedure. In the placebo group, SAEs of anal abscess (8), anal fistula or fistula 
(2) and/or anal inflammation (1) was reported to be in the same (treated) area in 7 of 11 reported cases.  
All TESAEs other than anal abscess experienced by Alofisel-treated patients were considered by the investigator 
to be unlikely or unrelated to study treatment. Based on the submitted narratives this is agreed. 
TESAEs reported between the Week 52 visit and the 30 June 2016 cut-off date for SAEs in Alofisel-treated 
patients were provided. These included 3 TESAEs, anal fistula and fistula discharge in the Alofisel group and

pregnancy in the placebo group. None of the events were considered causally related to treatment or the 
surgical procedure by the investigator. 
Laboratory findings 
There were no notable changes in laboratory assessments, vital signs or physical examinations in the clinical 
studies. 
Safety in special populations 
•  Subgroup analyses 
For study Cx601-0302, subgroup analyses of TEAEs by age (<65 years; ≥65 years) and gender and by the 
stratification factors assigned at randomization (immunosuppressants only, anti-TNFs only, both 
immunosuppressant and anti-TNF, or neither) did not reveal any conclusive trends of concern.  
Based on the cell-based nature of Alofisel and its local route of administration, it is not anticipated that Alofisel 
would be associated with more risks in elderly as compared to the non-elderly population. However, the number 
of patients ≥65 years of age is too small to draw definite conclusions. 
Hepatic and/or renal insufficiency is not expected to alter the distribution or clearance of the product although 
no specific studies have been conducted in these populations. The product information has been updated to 
reflect this. 
The proportions of Alofisel-treated patients that reported TEAEs up to Week 24 was higher in patients with only 
one external opening compared to those with 2 or more external openings (46/58, 79.3% versus 22/45, 
48.9%). This numeric difference persisted up to Week 52 (84.5% vs. 66.7%). 
Overall the trans-sphincteric location of perianal fistulas was the most frequent fistula location in both treatment 
groups and consequently, the majority of related TEAEs were reported in patients with this type of fistula. The 
limited number of events pertaining to other fistula locations precluded drawing conclusions on whether fistula 
classification or location had any effect on risk of complication or adverse event rate. 
•  Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnant and breastfeeding women were excluded from participation in both clinical studies and no such 
patients were treated with Alofisel in either of the 2 clinical studies.  There were no pregnancies reported 
following study treatment up to the Week 24 visit in study Cx601-0302 or during the 24-week follow-up period 
in study Cx601-0101. In study Cx601-0302, 3 pregnancies were reported up to the Week 52 visit and the date 
of clinical cut off of 30 June 2016 after receiving study treatment (1 in the Alofisel group and 2 in the placebo 
group). reported her pregnancy approximately 8 months after receiving Alofisel and had a healthy baby at term.  
Two additional pregnancies occurred after completion of study Cx601-0101 (Sanz-Baro et al., 2015).  In one 
case, a woman who had received 2 doses of Alofisel became pregnant 17 months later and gave birth to a baby 
who had (text redacted) but was otherwise healthy. In the second case, the woman experienced 2 consecutive 
first trimester spontaneous abortions starting 24 months after receiving 2 treatments with Alofisel. Neither case 
was considered causally related to Alofisel.  
One further pregnancy occurred during an investigator-initiated study of Alofisel in patients with rectovaginal 
fistulas.  The patient became pregnant 18 months after cell treatment (an initial 20 million cells followed by a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/64055/2018 
Page 66/87 
  
  
second treatment with 40 million cells).  She had a normal pregnancy and gave birth by Caesarean to a normal 
healthy baby at 39 weeks.  
Overall, experience with Alofisel during pregnancy and lactation is so far very limited and no conclusions can be 
drawn based on these few cases. The product information reflects this. Alofisel is not recommended during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception, and also that as a precautionary 
measure, Alofisel is not recommended for administration during breastfeeding.  
•  Use in children and adolescents 
There is no experience in the Alofisel clinical development programme in the treatment of complex perianal 
fistula(s) in patients younger than 18 years old. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has deferred the 
obligation to submit the results of studies with complex anal fistula in paediatric CD patients from 4 to less than 
18 years of age, until efficacy and safety of Alofisel for the treatment of complex anal fistula(s) in CD patients 
has been assessed in adults. A waiver was granted for fistulas of CD origin in neonates (0-1 month), infants and 
toddlers (1 24 months) and in children from 2-3 years of age on the grounds of having no unmet therapeutic 
need, of safety concerns due to the need for anaesthesia and on the grounds that the disease does not occur 
(EMEA-001561-PIP01-13). 
Immunological events 
In a subset of 123 of the 212 randomized Crohn’s disease patients in the pivotal study Cx601-0302 (63 Alofisel 
and 60 placebo), blood samples were analysed to assess the potential for generation of alloantibodies to Alofisel. 
Blood samples taken at baseline were analysed for IgG anti-HLA class I and II in order to assess pre-existing 
sensitisation (which could affect subsequent generation of antibody responses to Alofisel). The presence of IgG 
anti-HLA class I and II was re-tested at Week 12 and at Week 52 or early termination, and blood samples of 
patients with positive sera were further screened for donor-specific antibodies (DSA). All patients had samples 
collected at W12 (eASC: 63; placebo: 60). However, at W52, only 106 blood samples were collected (85.3%; 
(eASC: 58; placebo: 48). 
One administration of 120 million allogeneic eASC induced DSA in 23 of 63 (36.5%) patients at W12. Of the 23 
patients with DSA detected at W12, 17 (32.1%) were naïve (i.e. not pre-sensitized [no pre-existing anti-HLA 
antibodies]) at baseline and 6 (60%) were pre-sensitized.  
Furthermore, of these 23 patients, 13 kept positivity for DSA at W52, whereas 7 cleared antibodies by W52 and 
3 had missing samples at W52. No de novo generation of antibodies was detected from W12 to W52. 
Furthermore, none of the patients included in the placebo arm generated DSA.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No clinical studies investigating potential drug interactions with Alofisel were performed.  
Results of the subgroup analyses did not show a clear difference in the safety profile of Alofisel with or without 
co-administered medications such as anti-TNFs or immunosuppressants. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall, the proportion of patients who discontinued due to TEAE(s) up to the Week 52 visit was low (18/205, 
8.8%) and similar in both treatment groups (8.7% Alofisel; 8.8% placebo). 
The most common TEAE that resulted in withdrawal from the study was anal abscess, which led to the 
discontinuation of similar proportions of patients in both treatment groups (2.9%, Alofisel; 3.9% placebo). All 3 
cases of anal abscess in the Alofisel group were reported as serious, and 2 of the 4 cases in the placebo group.  
All 7 cases of anal abscess (i.e., the 3 cases in the Alofisel group and the 4 cases in the placebo group) were 
considered to be related (possibly or probably) to study treatment. 
Two of the 24 patients (8.3%) in study Cx601-0101discontinued due to TEAEs. The events included anal 
abscess, abscess drainage, and CRP increased in one patient (all non-serious and considered not related by the 
investigator) and anal abscess (serious, possibly related) in another patient.  Both patients were withdrawn 
following their first treatment with study drug. 
Post marketing experience 
At submission of the application Alofisel was approved for use as a medicinal product. No post-marketing data 
are available.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The primary safety data to support the targeted indication of Alofisel for treatment of complex perianal fistulas 
in patients with non-active or mildly-active Crohn’s disease result from the single Phase III study Cx601-0302 in 
212 patients with a planned follow-up to Week 104. The safety analyses in the current submission include the 
data up to the Week 52 visit, as well as SAEs that occurred and were entered between the Week 52 visit and the 
30 June 2016 cut-off date.  
In study Cx601-0302, up to Week 52, similar proportions of patients experienced TEAEs (76.7% Alofisel group; 
72.5% placebo group). The most common events were proctalgia (Alofisel: 14.6% of patients; placebo: 11.8%) 
and anal abscess (Alofisel: 19.4%; placebo: 13.7%). Severe TEAEs were reported similarly (Alofisel: 9.7% 
patients, 10 TEAEs; placebo: 9.8% patients, 11 TEAEs). 
In study Cx601-0302, procedural pain and proctalgia were reported as both procedure-emergent non-treatment 
emergent AEs and as treatment-emergent AEs, i.e. following the administration of IMP. Accordingly a statement 
was included in section 4.8 of the SmPC that these events have been reported as a result of the conditioning of 
the fistula. This is agreed as reasonable considering also the similarity in incidence between the Alofisel and 
placebo treatment groups e.g. for proctalgia. Although a significant proportion of treatment-emergent SAEs of 
perianal abscess, anal inflammation and/or fistula were considered related to the surgical procedure by the 
investigator, an analysis by the Applicant revealed this to be less plausible, considering the time to onset for 
most of the events.  
The incidence of the TEAE anal abscess was similar between the treatment groups up to Week 24 (Alofisel: 12 
patients; 11.7% vs. placebo: 13 patients; 12.7%), respectively. However, when patients were followed up to 
Week 52, anal abscess was reported more frequently in the Alofisel group (20 patients, 19.4%) vs. 14 patients 
(13.7%) placebo.  
Similarly, the most common TESAE was anal abscess, which was reported in slightly more patients in the Alofisel 
group than placebo 14 (13.6%) versus 8 (7.8%). This was also the case for SAEs of anal fistula/fistula (Alofisel: 
3.9%; placebo: 2%).  
Most of the SAEs in the Alofisel group (10 out of 14 cases of anal abscess SAEs and all 4 cases of fistula SAEs) 
were reported to have occurred in the same fistula that was treated with Alofisel, in most cases a rather long 
time (~1-10 months) after the procedure. In the placebo group, SAEs of anal abscess (8), anal fistula or fistula 
(2) and/or anal inflammation (1) was reported to be in the same (treated) area in 7 of 11 reported cases. Thus, 
treatment with Alofisel was not associated with fewer events of serious abscess formation in the treated fistula 
as compared to placebo, and this most likely reflects a lack of efficacy in some patients. Analyses of baseline 
features and disease characteristics (including gender, sole immunosuppressant use, duration of prophylactic 
antibiotic use, country), as well as time since CD diagnosis (> 10 y / ≤10 y), the fistula type (Parks 
classification), any collections at screening > 2 cm (drained), CDAI at baseline (>150 /≤150), and concomitant 
medication) did not show a significant effect on the response to Alofisel treatment, based on the current dataset. 
No treatment-emergent deaths were reported and there were no notable changes in clinical laboratory 
examinations, vital signs or physical examinations. 
Subgroup analyses of TEAEs by age (<65 years; ≥65 years) and gender and by the stratification factors 
assigned at randomization (immunosuppressants only, anti-TNFs only, both immunosuppressant and anti-TNF, 
or neither) did not reveal any conclusive trends of concern. The number of patients ≥65 years of age was too 
small to draw conclusions regarding the safety of Alofisel in elderly. However, given the cell-based nature of 
Alofisel and its local administration route it is not expected that the benefit-risk profile of Alofisel in elderly 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/64055/2018 
Page 69/87 
  
  
patients will differ from that observed in non-elderly patients. Experience in the elderly is included as missing 
information into the RMP which is considered acceptable. 
The proportions of Alofisel-treated patients that reported TEAEs was higher in patients with only one external 
opening compared to those with 2 or more external openings (84.5% versus 66.7%), which might point towards 
possible dose/exposure-related effects. This may signify random variability, differences in local exposure to 
Alofisel between the groups, or other. The Applicant was unable to clearly explain this observation but pointed 
to the fact that the numeric differences between these subgroups were smaller when comparing only related, 
serious AEs.  Considering also the relatively limited patient numbers it can be accepted that this issue is further 
followed and discussed anew in future safety reporting, including the planned PASS. 
The supportive open-label Phase I/IIa study Cx601-0101included only 24 patients who received a lower dose (at 
20 million cells) than the intended one for marketing. No additional safety concerns were identified in this limited 
study. Some patients received a second administration of Alofisel. The need for repeated injection in the clinical 
setting is foreseen in this patient population and appropriateness will be further studied by means of a PASS.  
In study Cx601-0302, a subgroup of 63 Alofisel and 60 placebo patients were analysed for the presence of IgG 
anti-HLA antibodies at baseline and for the presence of donor specific antibodies (DSA) at Week 12 and Week 
52, or at early termination; one administration of 120 million allogeneic eASC induced DSA in 23 of 63 (36.5%) 
patients at W12. Of the 23 patients with DSA detected at W12, 17 (32.1%) were naïve (i.e. not pre-sensitized 
[no pre-existing anti-HLA antibodies]) at baseline and 6 (60%) were pre-sensitized.  Furthermore, of these 23 
patients, 13 kept positivity for DSA at W52, whereas 7 cleared antibodies by W52 and 3 had missing samples at 
W52. No de novo generation of antibodies was detected from W12 to W52. None of the patients included in the 
placebo arm generated DSA. Overall, the results suggest that pre-sensitized eASC-treated patients may be 
more likely to generate DSA compared to patients who were not pre-sensitized (DSA generation at Week 12 by 
60.0% of pre-sensitized patients and 32.1% of patients who were not pre-sensitized). Furthermore, of the 
patients whose DSA status at W12 and W52 is known, it appears that the pre-sensitized patients were somewhat 
more likely to maintain DSA positivity (67% maintained antibodies at W52) as compared to patients not 
pre-sensitized (53% maintained antibodies at W52).  
However, few patients (~15% in both Alofisel and placebo groups) were pre-sensitized at baseline. This limits 
interpretability and it is unclear whether there could be any (additional) risk in terms of safety given that 
relatively more patients who were pre-sensitized as baseline developed DSA as compared to naïve patients. 
The Applicant provided a summary of potential immune-related TEAEs (e.g. pyrexia, rash) but these events 
were not considered particularly associated with the presence of DSA or with pre-sensitisation (pre-existing IgG 
anti-HLA antibodies at baseline). 
Overall, the data from this study do not indicate a clinically meaningful effect of DSA on the safety of Alofisel, but 
the data are limited, considering the modest patient numbers and lack of data on repeated dosing. 
Whether repeated administration of Alofisel could be associated with increased generation of DSA and/or in any 
way with increased risk of allo-immune response will be further studied in a PASS, also to evaluate the need for 
any screening. 
Bovine serum is used in the manufacturing process of the Alofisel. Also penicillin-G and streptomycin sulphate 
could potentially be present in drug product in trace amounts as impurities. This is sufficiently addressed in the 
SmPC. 
No signs of opportunistic infections or tumour development have been reported in the Alofisel clinical studies to 
date. The conducted nonclinical in vitro and in vivo studies do not indicate a risk for tumour-formation. Similarly, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/64055/2018 
Page 70/87 
  
  
there is no evidence to suggest the risk of ectopic tissue formation. However, the biological relevance of using 
human eASC in immunocompromised animals can be questioned (especially since the cells do not appear to 
persist for very long) in relation to this risk. As the clinical database is too limited and would require a substantial 
longer follow up compared to the clinical data currently available it is agreed to add these concerns as important 
potential risks into the RMP. 
Also the risk of transmission of infectious agents is viewed as an important potential risk. As outlined in the 
Quality sections, the testing of adventitious safety and introduced safety measures for raw and starting material 
of biological origin are now in essence considered acceptable.  The final tests for sterility and mycoplasma are 
retrieved after release. The Applicant has devised a number of risk minimisation activities in case of microbial 
contamination is detected in post release testing (mycoplasma and sterility) such as reporting procedures to the 
treating physician and the development of educational materials to ensure a timely and appropriate treatment 
of the patient. 
There is a potential risk on medication errors related to the surgical procedure such as the administration of the 
product (e.g. intravenous application), the manipulation of the product and the storage of the product. 
Medication errors could result in product contamination or incorrect administration, for example. Potential for 
medication errors is agreed to be included as an important potential risk in the RMP and educational material will 
be dispensed in order to provide information on how to correctly administer the product and to increase 
awareness about the potential transmission of infectious agents. Appropriate statements have also been 
included in the SmPC.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT discussion on clinical safety as described above. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety database of Alofisel is considered limited but provides sufficient characterisation of the safety profile 
for marketing authorisation. Unfavourable effects and uncertainties are appropriately described in SmPC and 
RMP and post authorisation follow up will be carried out in particular on important potential risks (such as 
tumourigenicity and/or ectopic tissue formation, immunogenicity/alloimmunoreactions and the risk of 
transmission of infectious agents), repeated administration and long term safety by means of a post 
authorisation safety study. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on clinical safety as described above.  
2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
The CAT received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan (RMP): 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 6.0 is acceptable.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance  
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CAT/CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD to determine the forthcoming 
Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that darvadstrocel has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
The CAT/CHMP, based on the available data, considers darvadstrocel to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union.

2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request of translation exemption of the vial label in accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 63(1) of 
Directive 2001/83/EC has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for 
the following reasons: 
Alofisel is an ATMP which has a short shelf-life (48 hours from the start of the finished product manufacturing to 
the time of administration). The labeling of the vials happens during the manufacturing process, and the 
packaging and distribution consumes approximately 4 hours of the 48h shelf-life clock. Having a vial label in 
English only will therefore help reducing the complexity as much as possible to avoid additional packaging time 
being borrowed against the short shelf-life of the finished product.  
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be translated 
in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed materials will only be 
translated in the language as agreed by the QRD Group. 
A request of translation exemption of the outer carton label in accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 
63(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC has been submitted by the applicant and has been found unacceptable by the 
QRD Group for the following reasons: 
No consensus could be reached by the QRD Group. Some Member of the Group could not agree to have an outer 
carton in English only mainly due to safety consideration: the label contains important information for the safe 
handling of the product which should be understood by the trained staff at the hospital who do not speak English. 
Bilingual or multilingual outer carton was a preferred option. 
Therefore, the applicant has been advised to submit this request separately to each National Competent 
Authority based on Art.63.3. 
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Alofisel (darvadstrocel) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Fistulas are common complications of Crohn’s disease (CD) and include perianal fistulas connecting the 
anorectum and the perianal area and also fistulas between the gastrointestinal tract and  an internal organ or 
the abdominal skin. In particular patients with CD involving the distal bowel are at increased risk of developing 
perianal fistulas. Results from population based studies indicate that perianal fistulas are the most common 
manifestation of fistulising CD and develop in approximately 20-30 % of patients along the course of the 
disease. Recurrences are observed in approximately 30 % of the cases (Hellers et al 1980, Schwartz et al 2002). 
Crohn´s disease perianal fistulas typically present as fissures or ulcers penetrating the anorectal wall and 
tracking till the perianal skin surface, and are characterised by local inflammation that is exacerbated by 
bacterial infection(s) and faecal contamination. In the inflamed area, there is lymphocyte activation and local 
release of inflammatory cytokines. Perianal fistulas in CD are classified as simple or complex. A complex fistula 
is characterised as having an origin above the dentate line, to have multiple external openings and are 
associated with perianal abscess, connection to the vagina or bladder. Further, a complex anal fistula could also 
meet the following criteria: have rectal stenosis and/or macroscopic proctitis. A complex fistula is more 
treatment resistant than simple fistulas. (Schwartz et al, 2015). 
The main symptoms of perianal fistulas are pain, abdominal swelling, abscess formation, fever and drainage of 
faeces, pus and blood. Perianal disease is associated with high morbidity and has a negative impact on the 
quality of life for the affected patients. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies  
Presently recommended treatments for perianal fistulising CD include drainage and immunosuppressive 
treatment. Antibiotics and thiopurines are considered as adjunct treatments and anti-TNF is considered the gold 
standard (Gecse KB et al, 2014). However, only infliximab has an approved indication for treatment of fistulising 
CD. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical efficacy has been evaluated in one randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre pivotal 
study. The study population included were patients with mild to moderate luminal Crohn’s disease and with 
perianal fistulas. Fistulas had previously shown an inadequate response to antibiotics, immunosuppressants or 
anti-TNF agents. Patients were to have complex fistulas with a maximum of two internal fistula openings and 
three external openings. All patients received pre-study preparation treatment (curettage, antibiotics and seton 
placement when required). On the day of administration of Alofisel 120x106 cells or placebo (saline), setons 
were removed and internal openings were closed with sutures.  
One supportive open-labelled pilot study was performed including patients with CD and complex fistulas. 
Patients were not required to have failed previous fistula treatments. Preparation treatment was performed on 
the same day as the administration of the study compound.

EMA/CHMP/64055/2018 
Page 76/87 
  
  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the pivotal study was defined as combined remission of perianal fistulising CD 
that included clinical closure of external openings that were draining at baseline despite gentle finger 
compression and absence of collections > 2 cm of the treated fistula confirmed by MRI images, at week 24. The 
results from this study show that there was a statistically significant difference between the numbers of patients 
in combined remission in the active and placebo groups at week 24. 
The combined remission in the active group was 49.5 % (53/107) (95% CI, 40.1, 59.0) and the corresponding 
figures in the placebo group were 34.5 % (36/105) (25.2, 43.4).  
The difference between the groups was 15.2 % (97.5 % CI 0.2, 30.3). This result was supported by the key 
secondary and other secondary endpoints although differences were not statistically significant. Key secondary 
endpoints were clinical remission (closure of all external openings that were draining at baseline despite gentle 
finger pressure compression) and clinical response (closure of ≥ 50 % of external openings) at week 24.  
Other secondary endpoints were combined remission, clinical remission and clinical response at week 52. The 
results were supportive of the primary analysis and showed statistically significant difference between the active 
and placebo groups. The difference between the groups in combined remission was 17.1 % (95 % CI, 3.9, 30.3), 
for clinical remission 17.0 % (95% CI, 3.8, 30.3) and for clinical response the difference was 10.2 %. 
The conducted sensitivity analyses of combined remission and key secondary endpoints in the mITT, Safety and 
PP are supportive of the primary analyses.  
The proportion of patients with clinical remission at Week 52 was 59 % in the Alofisel group and 41 % in the 
control group (p=0.012) and corresponding figures for response were 66% and. 55% (p=0.114). These data are 
supportive of the results from week 24 and there was a consistent difference observed between active and 
placebo treatment groups although the effect is limited to a minor proportion of the included patients. 
The results from the pilot study are also considered to be supportive although limited conclusions can be drawn 
due to the small number of patients included and the uncontrolled design of the study. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There was no observed difference in the QoL of subjects before and after treatment with Alofisel. There was a 
very small improvement in PDAI (perineal disease activity index) in both groups that was maintained to week 
52. However, the PDAI has limitations for determination of QoL for CD patients with fistulas. 
Data from week 104 has been submitted. For those patients that completed the week 52 follow-up and entered 
the 104 weeks follow-up, the rate of clinical remission was 56 % and 40 % in the active and placebo group, 
respectively. However, the data are viewed as limited. 
As a whole the treatment effect is considered to be of clinical relevance, as other treatment options for fistula 
have failed. The effect size appears modest and the application is based on a single pivotal study only. To 
provide confirmatory information on efficacy, the Company has presented a protocol for an ongoing Phase III 
study that is approved by the FDA, . Data from this study is expected to further increase the knowledge of the 
efficacy and safety of Alofisel in the treatment of fistulas. This study is considered key to the benefit-risk balance 
of the product, and thus, the approval of Alofisel should be subject to the submission of study Cx601-303 as an 
Annex II condition in line with Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007, as a post-authorisation follow-up of 
efficacy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/64055/2018 
Page 77/87 
  
  
There is currently limited experience with the efficacy or safety of repeat administration of Alofisel and section 
4.2 of the SmPC informs the prescriber accordingly.  Furthermore the PASS will provide, next to long term safety 
data, data on the effectiveness of Cx601 (Alofisel) in patients treated and retreated (i.e. repeated dosing) in 
routine clinical practise as described in the RMP.   
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Similar proportions of patients treated with Alofisel and placebo experienced TEAEs (76.7% and 72.5%, 
respectively) and most events were mild or moderate in intensity. Severe TEAEs were also reported similarly 
(9.7% vs. 11.8% of patients). 
The most common TEAEs that occurred in a higher proportion of patients in the Alofisel group than the placebo 
group included proctalgia (Alofisel: 14.6% patients; placebo: 11.8%), anal fistula (10.7% vs. 7.8%) and anal 
abscess (19.4% vs. 13.7%) patients). The combined frequency of ‘anal fistula’ and ‘fistula’ TEAEs was however 
similar in both treatment groups (Alofisel: 13/103 [12.6%] patients; placebo: 13/102 [12.7%]). 
Events of procedural pain (1-2% of patients) and also proctalgia seemed to (mainly) result from the conditioning 
of the fistula prior to Alofisel administration, considering the similarity in incidence between the Alofisel and 
placebo treatment groups and the fact that these AEs also were reported as non-treatment-emergent AEs 
during the initial surgical preparation visit (prior to randomization). Nasopharyngitis (10.7% vs. 4.9%) and 
diarrhea (8.7% vs. 2.9%) were reported as TEAEs by proportionally more patients in the Alofisel group than the 
placebo group but these events were typically considered as unrelated to treatment.  
The most common TESAE was anal abscess, which was reported in slightly more patients in the Alofisel group 
than placebo up to Week 52 (13.6% versus 7.8%). This most likely reflects a lack of efficacy in some patients 
rather than a safety issue. Development of new anal fistula and/or anal abscess or relapse of treated fistula is 
addressed as important potential risk in the RMP and the safety profile is adequately described in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC. 
All TESAEs other than anal abscess experienced by Alofisel-treated patients were reported in small numbers of 
patients and were considered unlikely related or unrelated to study treatment. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The current safety analyses were largely based on a single pivotal study using data up to the Week 52 visit. 
While in the course of the assessment procedure additional follow-up data (up to Week 104) regarding the safety 
of Alofisel after single administration was provided, the overall scope of the safety database is still limited. 
Most events of serious abscess formation (10 out of 14 cases of anal abscess SAEs) and all 4 cases of anal fistula 
SAEs in the Alofisel group occurred in the same fistula that was treated with Alofisel, in several cases a rather 
long time (~1-10 months) after the procedure. In the placebo group, SAEs of anal abscess (8), anal fistula or 
fistula (2) and/or anal inflammation (1) was reported to be in the same (treated) area in 7 of 11 reported cases. 
Thus, treatment with Alofisel was not associated with fewer events of serious abscess formation in the treated 
fistula as compared to placebo, as might be expected. This most likely reflects a lack of efficacy in some patients 
rather than a safety issue. However, as the follow-up time in the current submission is limited in terms of relapse 
risk and long-term maintenance of remission the risk of new anal fistula and abscess and/or the recurrence of 
previously treated fistulas was included as an important potential risk and will be followed up within the PASS as 
described in the RMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/64055/2018 
Page 78/87 
  
  
While treatment with Alofisel is proposed for single dose administration, the need for repeated treatment in the 
clinical setting seems foreseeable in the targeted patient population.  Therefore the prescriber is informed in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC about the limited experience of repeat administration of Alofisel.  The supportive 
open-label study Cx601-0101 explored the issue of retreatment but included only few patients and the doses 
were lower than intended for marketing. Whether repeated administration could be associated with increased 
generation of DSA and/or in any way with increased risk of allo-immune response will also be further studied in 
a PASS as described in the RMP. 
Medication errors are possible in the handling and administration of Alofisel. Cell viability may be compromised 
if the fistula tract is washed through with hydrogen peroxide, methylene blue, iodine solutions or hypertonic 
glucose solutions before, during or after Alofisel administration. Cell viability may also be compromised if Alofisel 
is administered using thinner gauge needles than 22G, or if local anaesthesia is used for fistula conditioning (as 
the effect of local anaesthetic on the cells is unknown). Section 4.4 of the SmPC takes due account of this 
potential risk and educational materials as an additional risk minimisation measure will be provided to ensure 
healthcare professionals understand the correct procedures for Alofisel handling and administration. 
As Alofisel contains living cells, the transmission of bacterial, viral, fungal or prion pathogens might potentially 
occur. In addition, the final tests for sterility and mycoplasma are retrieved only after release. There have been 
no cases of transmission of infectious agents after Alofisel administration so far. In case of a positive sterility test 
result is identified after the product is released, the company will utilize a batch coding system to trace the Drug 
Substance and MSC from which the contaminated final product was derived and urgently notifies the treating 
physician. The educational materials as an additional risk minimization measure will inform health care 
providers that the therapy could contain potentially infected biological material and that patients should be 
monitored for potential signs of infection after administration. 
The risk of tumour formation is a key potential concern in cell based therapies. While nonclinical studies using 
human eASC in rodents suggest that the tumourigenicity risk of Alofisel is low, the relevance of these data for 
understanding the risk of tumourigenicity after prolonged engraftment of these cells in human is insufficiently 
understood. Another potential concern is whether there is any remaining differentiation potential of the eASC 
cells following administration in humans. Similarly, the nonclinical studies indicate a low potential for 
undesirable differentiation but how this translates to human risk is unknown. These concern would thus need to 
be clinically addressed and it is agreed with the applicant to include them as important potential risk into the 
RMP. 
The endorsed  PASS to address the remaining uncertainties is  a prospective, multicentre, multinational 
single-arm exposure cohort of patients treated with Alofisel, to evaluate the long-term safety in patients treated 
and retreated (i.e. repeated dosing and immunogenicity) in the clinical setting. Primary safety outcome 
measures include new fistula development and/or anal abscess or relapse of treated fistula, 
immunogenicity/allo-immunoreactions and hypersensitivity reactions, transmission of infectious agents, ectopic 
tissue formation, tumourigenicity (anal canal and local colorectal malignancy and AEs (serious or nonserious) 
related to perianal Crohn’s disease or related to Alofisel.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Perianal fistulas are common in patients with Crohn’s disease. Fistulas are associated with high morbidity and a 
number of patients suffer from scarring, persistent drainage and faecal incontinence.  In the studies, patients 
included had complex fistulas that are more treatment resistant than simple fistulas. Patients were refractory to 
conventional therapy (antibiotics, immunosuppressants or anti-TNF agents). 
This is an infrequent medical condition. There are few options for patients resistant to conventional therapy. 
Remaining options for this group of subjects would be last resort surgical treatment such as faecal diversion or 
proctectomy. 
In support of the efficacy of Alofisel in the treatment of perianal fistulas in CD patients the results of one pivotal 
study only has been submitted. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups of 15 % at 
week 24. Results for key secondary endpoints were supportive but statistical significance was not achieved. 
However, additional efficacy data from week 52 provide further support in that a statistically significant 
difference between the treatment groups of 17 % was observed for combined remission and clinical remission. 
The beneficial effects of Alofisel based on the current data appear to be consistent although moderate. However, 
further data to support efficacy is expected to be available from the Cx601-0303 study. 
The short-term safety profile of Alofisel is considered favourable. Approximately 77% of subjects treated 
reported a treatment emergent adverse event (vs. 73% in the placebo group) of which the majority were of mild 
intensity and approximately 10% are reported as severe. Serious safety concerns identified included anal 
abscess, anal fistula and proctalgia.  These adverse events could be foreseen given the nature of the perianal 
disease and the procedures involved in the administration of the cells. 
Treatment with Alofisel was not associated with fewer events of serious abscess formation in the treated fistula 
as compared to placebo, as might be expected. This most likely reflects a lack of efficacy in some patients rather 
than a safety issue. Additional post-hoc analyses of the primary outcome were performed in order to assess the 
potential impact of relapses on the clinical outcome (combined remission and remission) at week 24 and 52 in 
the ITT population in which TESAEs and TEAEs indicative of lack of efficacy (i.e. fistulas and abscesses) were 
imputed as treatment failure. These results confirm that fistula/abscess adverse events did not impact the 
primary efficacy analysis conclusions. 
A specific risk associated with Alofisel use is the generation of Donor Specific Antibodies (DSA). Based on the 
current data, the generation of DSA does not appear to affect efficacy or safety after single treatment. However, 
there are uncertainties regarding repeated treatment. Also, the generation of such antibodies may have other 
implications for future transplant therapies.  
While the current size of the safety database is acceptable for marketing authorisation  additional data on the 
safety of Alofisel, in understanding the biological mechanisms, the safety and efficacy of repeated 
administration, the risk of differentiation and ectopic tissue formation, and the risk of tumourigenicity will be 
provided post marketing as described in the RMP. As Alofisel contains living, allogeneic cells, the collection of 
additional safety data is also important to further monitor and minimize the possible occurrence of transmission 
of infection and of immunogenicity/all-immunoreactions. These uncertainties will be addressed in the RMP.

Page 81/87 
  
  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, it is considered that the results from the single, pivotal phase III study provide sufficient evidence of 
efficacy. The results from the pivotal study showed that there was a statistically significant difference between 
the numbers of patients in combined remission in the active and placebo groups. The difference between the 
groups at week 24 for the primary outcome combined remission was 15.2 %. This was supported by the results 
of the key secondary endpoints clinical remission and clinical response although differences were not statistically 
significant. Other secondary endpoints i.e. combined remission and clinical remission at week 52 show 
statistically significant differences between treatment groups of 17 % and for clinical response at week 52 the 
difference was 10 %. Although the effect compared to control appears modest, is considered to be of clinical 
relevance as other treatment options for fistula have failed. Considering also the approval setting with a single 
pivotal study, confirmatory information on efficacy is considered as of importance for the benefit-risk of the 
product and will be obtained from the ongoing Phase III study Cx601-303 (final CSR expected in 2022). Thus, 
the approval of Alofisel should be subject to the submission of study Cx601-303 which is similar in design to the 
pivotal study of this application as an Annex II condition.  
The safety database of Alofisel is considered limited but provides sufficient characterisation of the safety profile 
for marketing authorisation. Unfavourable effects and uncertainties are appropriately described in SmPC and 
RMP and post authorisation follow up will be carried out in particular on important potential risks, repeated 
administration and long term safety by means of a post authorisation safety study. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Alofisel is positive. 
Divergent positions are appended to this report. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on Benefit Risk balance as described above.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CAT review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CAT considers by majority decision that the 
benefit-risk balance of Alofisel is favourable in the following indication: 
Alofisel is indicated for the treatment of complex perianal fistulas in adult patients with non-active/mildly active 
luminal Crohn’s disease, when fistulas have shown an inadequate response to at least one conventional or 
biologic therapy. Alofisel should be used after conditioning of fistula, see section 4.2. 
The CAT therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:  
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product Characteristics, 
section 4.2).

Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures: 
Description 
Due date 
In order to follow-up on the efficacy of Alofisel, the MAH should submit the results of a 
Final Report to EMA: 
Phase III randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study Cx601-0303 investigating a 
2Q/3Q 2022 
single administration of Cx601 for the treatment of complex perianal fistulas in Crohn's 
disease patients. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on the obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures as described 
above. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product to be 
implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
Divergent positions to this majority recommendation are appended to this report. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CAT review of the available data, the CAT considers that darvadstrocel is considered to be a new 
active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.  
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on the new active substance status claim.

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 14 December 2017 
Alofisel EMEA/H/C/004258/0000 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending the 
refusal of the granting of the marketing authorisation of Alofisel indicated for treatment of complex perianal 
fistulas in adult patients with non-active/mildly active luminal Crohn’s disease, when fistulas have shown an 
inadequate response to at least one conventional or biologic therapy. 
The reason for divergent opinion was the following: 
As explained in the CHMP guideline for single pivotal trials, in the case of licensing based on one single pivotal 
trial, the results should be compelling. The currently available results are, however, modest. 
Given the small effect size and given the history of negative studies with respect to mesenchymal stem cell 
treatment an additional confirmative study is needed to confirm the marginal efficacy at an acceptable safety 
profile for the proposed indication.  
The  company  is  currently  performing  an  additional  clinical  study  Cx601-0303  in  the  US  and  the  EU.  We 
consider  that  the  benefit/  risk  balance  of  Alofisel  should  be  re-assessed  when  the  final  results  of  this 
additional study are available. Without confirmation of both efficacy and safety by results from an additional 
trial, the benefit/risk balance of Alofisel remains negative. Additionally, there remains the issue that repeated 
use of this product may be necessary when new fistulas open, but has never been investigated.

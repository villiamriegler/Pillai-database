Tumor Lysis syndrome (TSL, a condition which may happen 
when cancer cells die quickly, causing changes in blood 
levels of minerals and metabolites shown in a blood test) 
could rarely occur in susceptible patients when treated with 
Perjeta; in particular, when additional risk factors such as 
renal impairment, dehydration, poor oral intake or older 
age are present. Symptoms may include kidney problems 
(weakness, shortness of breath, fatigue and confusion), 
heart problems (fluttering of the heart of a faster or slower 
heartbeat), seizures, vomiting or diarrhoea and tingling in 
the mouth, hands or feet.

analysis of data from MetaPHER. This protocol-specified 
interim analysis was planned to evaluate the overall safety 
profile and tolerability of Herceptin SC in combination with 
Perjeta IV plus docetaxel in patients with HER2 positive 
advanced breast cancer (metastatic or locally recurrent). 
The presented data support inclusion of trastuzumab SC as 
an alternative to trastuzumab IV, and the safety profile of 
Herceptin SC+Perjeta IV+docetaxel based on the 
MetaPHER interim analysis seem consistent with the known 
safety profile of Herceptin IV+Perjeta IV+docetaxel.

The proposed dosing recommendation in the Perjeta SmPC 
is as follows: 
When administered with pertuzumab the recommendation 
is to follow a 3-weekly schedule for trastuzumab 
administered as either: 
an IV infusion with an initial dose of trastuzumab 8 mg/kg 
body weight followed every 3 weeks thereafter by a 
maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg body weight 
or 
a fixed dose of trastuzumab injection (600 mg) every 3 
weeks irrespective of the patient’s body weight.

The primary objective of BERENICE study was to evaluate 
II and relevant sections of the PL in order to update 
information on cardiac safety and reflect the results 
from study BERENICE (WO29217) listed as a specific 
obligation in the Annex II.BERENICE is an ongoing 
Multicenter, Multinational, Phase II Study to Evaluate 
Perjeta in Combination with Herceptin and Standard 
Neoadjuvant Anthracycline-Based Chemotherapy in 
Patients with HER2- Positive, Locally Advanced, 
Inflammatory, or Early-Stage Breast Cancer. The 
MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor 
amendments in section 4.2. 
The RMP v.9 has also been updated to reflect the 
study results.

concerning PSUR or PASS or the outcome of the 
assessment done under A 45/46 - Other variation 
the cardiac safety of two commonly used neoadjuvant 
anthracycline/taxane based chemotherapy regimens when 
given in combination with neoadjuvant Perjeta and 
Herceptin. In the BERENICE trial, when Perjeta was 
administered in combination with trastuzumab and 
paclitaxel for four cycles following four cycles of two weekly 
doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (dose dense AC), the 
most common ADRs (≥50%) were nausea, diarrhoea, 
fatigue and alopecia. The most common NCI-CTCAE (v.4) 
Grade 3-4 ADR (≥10%) was neutropenia. When Perjeta 
was administered in combination with trastuzumab and 
docetaxel for four cycles following four cycles of FEC the 
most common ADRs (≥50%) were nausea, diarrhea and 
alopecia. The most common NCI-CTCAE (v.4) Grade 3-4 
ADRs (≥10%) were febrile neutropenia and diarrhoea. The 
overall safety profile seen in BERENICE is consistent with 
that observed in previous data in the neoadjuvant setting 
for NEOSPHERE and TRYPHAENA. 
In the neoadjuvant period of the BERENICE trial, the 
incidence of NYHA Class III/IV symptomatic LVD 
(congestive heart failure according to NCI-CTCAE v.4) was 
Page 10/18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.5% in the group treated with dose dense doxorubin and 
cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by Perjeta plus 
trastuzumab and paclitaxel and none of the patients (0%) 
experienced symptomatic LVD in the group treated with 
FEC followed by Perjeta in combination with trastuzumab 
and docetaxel. The incidence of asymptomatic LVD 
(ejection fraction decrease according to NCI-CTCAE v.4) 
was 7% in the group treated with dose dense AC followed 
by Perjeta plus trastuzumab and paclitaxel and 3.5% in the 
group treated with FEC followed by Perjeta plus 
trastuzumab and docetaxel. Cardiac safety data from the 
BERENICE study were consistent with previous data in the 
neoadjuvant setting.

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate 
obligations and conditions of a marketing 
authorisation, including the RMP - Other variation 
tolerability, particularly with respect to cardiac function, of 
the three treatment regimens during the neoadjuvant 
period of the study. The primary analyses (reported within 
variation II/0010) had shown that Perjeta and Herceptin 
were generally well tolerated, with low and similar rates of 
symptomatic LVSD, regardless of whether they were given 
sequentially after or concomitantly with anthracycline 
treatment, or concomitantly with carboplatin-based 
treatment. Overall, the final CSR has not identified any new 
safety concerns or unexpected findings regarding cardiac 
safety. 
No amendments to the Product Information were 
considered necessary.

Annex II 
The PHEREXA study was designed to compare the 
multicenter randomized Phase III study to compare 
the combination of trastuzumab and capecitabine, 
with or without pertuzumab, in patients with HER2- 
positive metastatic breast cancer that have 
progressed after one line of trastuzumabbased 
therapy in the metastatic setting. This submission 
fulfils the Annex II condition ANX 001 to the 
marketing authorisation. 
Annex II of the Marketing Authorisation has been 
updated to reflect the fulfilment of this condition. The 
RMP is updated to reflect the completion of the study 
and the MAH has taken the opportunity to include in 
the RMP annexes a minor amendment of the 
BERENICE protocol. 
C.I.11.z - Introduction of, or change(s) to, the 
obligations and conditions of a marketing 
authorisation, including the RMP - Other variation 
combination of Herceptin and Xeloda, with or without 
Perjeta, in patients with HER2-positive MBC who have 
progressed after one line of Herceptin-based therapy in the 
metastatic setting. The study did not meet its primary 
endpoint. The PFS analysis showed a modest treatment 
effect with an increase in median PFS of 2.1 months when 
the pertuzumab combination treatment was compared with 
trastuzumab and capecitabine only treatment. With an 
increase in median survival of 8.0 months, the interim 
analysis of the overall survival data indicates benefit in 
patients treated with pertuzumab, trastuzumab and 
capecitabine over patients treated with trastuzumab and 
capecitabine only. However, in light of the PFS result and 
statistical testing hierarchy, statistical significance cannot 
be concluded. 
Additional secondary endpoints (including ORR and CBR) 
were consistent with the primary efficacy endpoint and 
supportive of clinical benefit for the pertuzumab regimen. 
Overall, the safety profile of the pertuzumab regimen was 
consistent with the previous studies of pertuzumab. No new 
safety signals were observed in the PHEREXA trial. 
Although the magnitude of clinical benefit observed in this 
study for the test arm is modest, the safety profile is 
consistent with that seen for pertuzumab in other studies. 
Overall, the benefit-risk of Perjeta for the treatment in 
combination with Herceptin and Xeloda in a second line 
treatment setting remains positive. The magnitude of 
clinical benefit and the acceptable safety profile in the 
currently approved Perjeta breast cancer indications 
remains unchanged.

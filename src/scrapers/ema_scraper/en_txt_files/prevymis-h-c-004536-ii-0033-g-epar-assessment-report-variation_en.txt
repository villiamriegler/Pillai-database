2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The data provided in this application are intended to support an indication for prophylaxis of CMV 
disease in CMV-seronegative adults who have received a kidney transplant from a CMV-seropositive 
donor [D+/R-]. The MAH is also seeking a modification of the current approved posology to extend 
prophylaxis beyond 100 days post-HSCT. This may be of benefit in some patients at high risk for late 
CMV reactivation. The safety and efficacy of letermovir use for more than 200 days has not been 
studied in clinical trials. 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Cytomegalovirus is ubiquitous and generally acquired early in life, with the majority of the adult 
population being CMV-seropositive in most countries worldwide. Kidney transplant recipients and 
allogeneic HSCT recipients are immune-compromised, which increases the risk for CMV infection.  
Among individuals with intact immune systems, reactivation of CMV infection is uncommon and is 
generally asymptomatic. However, CMV reactivation in immunocompromised patients, such as 
transplant recipients, can cause significant morbidity and mortality. 
Epidemiology  
In kidney transplant recipients the CMV disease incidence varies by serostatus with the highest 
incidence among CMV seronegative (R-) kidney recipients with a transplanted kidney from a CMV 
positive donor.  
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
CMV infection and disease is a serious or even fatal complication in immunocompromised patients, 
such as those undergoing transplantation. In HSCT recipients the risk of CMV infection is mostly due to 
reactivation of latent CMV infection. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with prior CMV 
infection (R+) are at highest risk for developing CMV reactivation and disease, especially during the 
first 100 days post-transplant (Özdemir 2007). 
The risk for CMV infection is reduced after the first 100 days post-transplant as the immune system 
reconstitutes. However, there are certain HSCT populations who remain at high risk for CMV infection 
and/or disease beyond 100 days post-transplant due to delayed immune reconstitution, ongoing 
immunosuppression as a result of treatment for GVHD, or onset of new GVHD when 
immunosuppression is tapered. 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 8/113 
 
  
 
 
Clinical presentation 
In the absence of prophylaxis, CMV disease is the most common clinically significant viral infection 
experienced after transplant causing substantial morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients due to 
direct (eg, pneumonia, hepatitis, retinitis, encephalitis) (Boeckh et al 2011; Ljungman et al 2002; 
Boeckh 2011) and indirect (eg, increased risk of select opportunistic bacterial and invasive fungal 
infections, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), delayed engraftment or graft failure/rejection, increased 
overall mortality) effects (Craddock et al 2001; Miller et al 1986; Ozdemir et al 2007; Martino et al 
2001; Söderberg et al 1993; Larsson et al 2004; Marty et al 2011; Ariza-Heredia et al 2014; Ljungman 
et al 2016). 
Management 
The current standard of care in kidney transplant recipients is CMV prophylaxis with valganciclovir 
(VGCV), an orally bioavailable prodrug of ganciclovir. The cumulative rate of CMV disease with no 
prophylaxis in D+/R- kidney transplant recipients may be inferred to above 50% over 12 months, in 
the absence of prophylaxis. 
VGCV has been shown to be efficacious in reducing the incidence of CMV disease both post solid organ 
as well as post HSCT. However, VGCV is poorly tolerated, primarily due to myelosuppression and 
persistent leukopenia and neutropenia. This is a particular problem post HSCT, to the extent that pre-
emptive therapy rather than prophylaxis with VGCV is preferred in this setting.  
2.1.2.  About the product 
Prevymis (letermovir) is an inhibitor of the viral DNA terminase complex, which plays a key role in 
cleavage and packaging of viral progeny DNA. Virological characterization and sequence analysis of 
resistant viruses indicate that the viral terminase complex is the target of this compound. Unlike 
currently marketed anti-CMV drugs, which act via inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase, terminase 
inhibitors interfere with viral DNA maturation and packaging of monomeric genome units. 
Consequently, cross-resistance is not expected between letermovir and currently approved medicines 
for the treatment of CMV infection. There is no known mammalian counterpart of the viral terminase 
complex.  
The positive B/R of 100 days of letermovir prophylaxis post HSCT has previously been accepted by 
CHMP. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The initial approval of LET for the prophylaxis of CMV infection and disease after HSCT was supported 
by 28 Phase 1 studies, 2 Phase 2 studies, and a Phase 3 pivotal study (P001). Continued development 
of LET includes 4 studies consisting of 3 completed Phase 3 studies: P040 (evaluating extending LET 
administration from 100 days to 200 days post-transplant for CMV infection and/or disease prophylaxis 
in allogeneic HSCT recipients), P002 (evaluating the use of LET for CMV prophylaxis in kidney 
transplant recipients), and P042 (nonrandomized, single-arm, open-label study in adult Japanese 
kidney transplant recipients), and 1 ongoing Phase 2b study: P030 (a single-arm, open-label study in 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 9/113 
 
  
 
 
paediatric recipients of an HSCT). Studies P002 and P040 are included in this submission. 
In 2018, the Sponsor requested CHMP advice that carcinogenicity studies for LET are not warranted 
because the carcinogenic hazard for humans following administration of LET for up to 200 days is 
negligible. The CHMP indicated that the omission of a carcinogenicity study to support administration 
for up to 200 days could be agreed, provided that there are no signals for development of neoplasms 
detected during review of the final application dossier. 
Prevymis is an orphan product in the approved indication of prophylaxis of CMV reactivation and 
disease in adult CMV-seropositive recipients [R+] of an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant 
(HSCT). 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP  
The MAH states that the clinical studies were conducted in accordance with current standard research 
approaches with regard to the design, conduct, and analysis of such studies including the archiving of 
essential documents. All studies were conducted following appropriate Good Clinical Practice standards 
and considerations for the ethical treatment of human participants that were in place at the time the 
studies were performed.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Letermovir is a viral DNA terminase complex inhibitor, approved in the EU for the prophylaxis of CMV 
reactivation and disease in adult CMV R+ of an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). 
The duration of treatment is 100 days. 
In this variation, the MAH proposes a prolonged treatment duration of up to 200 days post HCST, and 
to add a new indication: for prophylaxis of CMV disease in CMV-seronegative adults who have received 
a kidney transplant from a CMV-seropositive donor [D+/R-] with a treatment duration of up to 200 
days.  
To support the use of letermovir for a longer treatment duration than 6 months, three new non-clinical 
studies, as outlined below, were conducted. In addition, a weight of evidence (WoE)-based 
carcinogenicity risk assessment was included. An update to SmPC section 5.3 was proposed.

Mortality: There were test article-related unscheduled deaths in females and males dosed at 1000 mg/kg/day 
between Study Days 1 and 3. There were no gross changes that could be ascribed to an intubation accident in any 
mice that were found dead or sacrificed early. Due to these unscheduled deaths and clinical signs indicative of 
deteriorating physical condition, remaining high-dose animals were early sacrificed on Study Day 3. 
Clinical observations: Eyes partially closed with white discharge and decreased activity, observed post-dose in 1 male 
at 1000 mg/kg/day before early sacrifice on Study Day 3, considered related to the poor condition of the animal. 
Body weight: Test article-related effects on body weights included decreases in mean body weight gain in males at 
300 mg/kg/day, when compared to other dose groups, and increases in frequency in individual body weight losses in 
females and males at 300 mg/kg/day. 
Food consumption: There were no test article-related changes in food consumption.

Mortality: There were no test article-related unscheduled deaths. 
Clinical observations: There were no test article-related clinical observations. 
Body weight/food consumption: Decreases in mean body weight gain in males at 300 mg/kg/day (-53% compared to 
concurrent controls). 
Haematology: There were no test article-related effects. 
Clinical chemistry: Test article-related very slightly increased mean alanine aminotransferase activity was present in 
females and males at 300 mg/kg/day (+53% to +83%, respectively, compared to the mean value from concurrent 
controls). In addition, two females at 150 mg/kg/day had alanine aminotransferase activity that was outside the 
range of values present in concurrent controls. There were very slightly decreased mean cholesterol and triglyceride 
concentrations in males at 300 mg/kg/day (-52% and -46%, respectively, compared to the mean values from 
concurrent controls), and very slightly decreased mean albumin concentrations in females at 300 mg/kg/day (-10% 
compared to the mean values from concurrent controls). These serum biochemical findings were not adverse 
because of the small magnitude of the changes. 
Gross pathology:  
Liver; increased size and/or discoloration/prominent pattern in both genders at ≥150 mg/kg/day, correlating with 
microscopic alterations. 
Organ weight: 
Liver; increased weight in males at 50 mg/kg/day and in both genders at ≥150 mg/kg/day, correlating with 
microscopic alterations. 
Microscopic pathology:  
Liver, centrilobular hypertrophy occurring with an increased incidence and severity in males at all doses and in 
females at ≥150 mg/kg/day.  
Carcinogenicity 
26-week Carcinogenicity Study of Letermovir by Oral Gavage in CByB6F1/Tg rasH2 
Hemizygous Mice 
In the 26-week carcinogenicity study in CByB6F1/Tg rasH2 hemizygous mice, the high dose was set at 
the MTD in both sexes; 150 mg/kg/day in males and 300 mg/kg/day in females. The low and 
intermediate doses (5 and 25 mg/kg/day in males, and 10 and 100 mg/kg/day in females) were 
expected to provide sufficient separation of systemic exposures to avoid overlap between dose levels.

50%) were observed in males at 150 
mg/kg/day as compared to vehicle controls 
(Group 1). Slight decreases in mean food 
consumption at 150 mg/kg/day in males 
generally corresponded to reductions in body 
weight.

Mortality 
There were no test-item-related unscheduled deaths. The statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) increase in 
unscheduled deaths only in males through the 150 mg/kg/day group was not related to the test article 
because 1) the incidences of these unscheduled deaths were low, and with no dose response, and 2) 
the causes of death in treated groups were of the type and incidence seen in untreated mice in this 
laboratory. There was no statistically significant increase in the unscheduled deaths of females through 
the 300 mg/kg/day group. The test article-related histomorphologic change noted in the high-dose 
female and male mice in these unscheduled deaths consisted of hypertrophy of liver that correlated 
with a gross finding of increased size or prominent lobular pattern of liver. The total unscheduled 
deaths are listed below. 
Table 4: Total unscheduled deaths (incidence and percentage of animals found dead or

One 25 mg/kg/day male (Animal No. 5501) was euthanized on Day 35 due to an apparent leg injury 
and one 25 mg/kg/day male (Animal No. 5013) was euthanized on Day 51 due to an apparent tail 
injury.

For the positive control article, N-nitrosomethylurea (NMU), there was a higher incidence of mortality 
in males (87%) and females (73%) primarily due to malignant lymphoma, an expected finding in 
positive controls in this model. 
Non-neoplastic findings 
Administration of letermovir was associated with minimal to moderate hepatocellular hypertrophy in 
females dosed at 300 mg/kg/day and males dosed at 150 mg/kg/day, as summarized in Table 5. The 
hepatocellular hypertrophy was characterized by increased size of the hepatocytes in the centrilobular 
to midzonal region of the hepatic lobule. This change correlated with the gross finding of increased size 
or prominent lobular pattern of the liver observed at necropsy.  
Hyperplastic/neoplastic changes 
Although there were no statistically significant trends in tumours after the multiplicity adjustment, the 
increased incidence of benign papilloma in the squamous mucosa of the non-glandular stomach 
(forestomach) of female mice at 300 mg/kg/day was considered MK-8228 related since this benign 
neoplastic change occurred concurrently with increased incidence of focal reactive hyperplasia in the 
squamous mucosa of the forestomach of mice. The hyperplasia, a likely preneoplastic change, was 
characterized by focally increased thickness of the stratified squamous epithelium lining the 
forestomach showing increased number of cells and hyperkeratosis (increased amounts of keratin) on 
the luminal surface, with occasional focal erosion of the mucosa. The epithelium in the affected region 
was focally raised with accumulation of inflammatory cellular infiltrates in the subjacent lamina propria 
and submucosa.  
The hyperplasia was considered to be an adaptive response to the local irritation by the test article as 
indicated by the inflammatory response. The papilloma, considered to have arisen from the 
hyperplasia, presented as solitary exophytic benign growths with a narrow stalk and complex fronds of 
proliferating epithelium supported by branching fibrovascular connective tissue core, projecting into 
the lumen of the stomach. The epithelium was often hyperkeratotic but maintained normal 
organization of the squamous epithelial layers. Mitotic figures were rare, and no cellular atypia or local 
invasion was observed. Oesophagus, the other region of the upper gastrointestinal tract lined by a 
similar epithelium as the forestomach, was unremarkable. 
In the NMU positive control group, compared to vehicle control groups, there were statistically 
significant (p  0.002) increased incidences of the following tumours: papilloma in the skin (p<0.001), 
papilloma in the stomach (p<0.001), lymphoma (p<0.001), adenoma in the lung (p=0.002), and polyp 
in uterus/cervix (p<0.001) in the females; and papilloma in skin (p<0.001), papilloma in the stomach 
(p<0.001), and lymphoma (p<0.001) in the males. The high incidence of these tumours was an 
expected outcome of NMU treatment used as positive control and it demonstrated the response of the 
transgenic rasH2 mice to this carcinogen. 
A summary of the postmortem non-neoplastic and hyperplasia/neoplastic histopathological changes is 
included below.

Table 5: Test-article-related post-mortem findings 
Statistical analysis 
In males, there were no statistically significant increasing trends in tumour incidence through the 150 
mg/kg/day dose group. 
In females, an increasing trend for papilloma in stomach was not statistically significant through the 
top dose of 300 mg/kg/day after the multiplicity adjustment. A statistically significant increasing trend 
in tumour incidence through the 300 mg/kg/day dose was found for papilloma in stomach in female 
mice prior to multiplicity adjustment (p = 0.035). After multiplicity adjustment, the increasing trend 
was not statistically significant (adjustment p = 0.097). 
Letermovir plasma concentration 
Three satellite animals per group were sampled at 1 hour post dose on Day 182. 
Letermovir concentrations in plasma from all control group animals at 1 hours post dose were below 
the lower limit of quantitation of the bioanalytical method. At 1 hour post-dose, mean letermovir 
concentrations increased in a dose-related manner in males (5 to 150 mg/kg/day) and females (10 to 
300 mg/kg/day).

WoE-based carcinogenicity risk assessment 
In lieu of conducting a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study post-marketing as previously agreed with US 
FDA and Japan PMDA, a WoE-based carcinogenicity risk assessment has been developed in accordance 
with the recently (04-AUG-2022) adopted ICH S1B(R1) Addendum to Testing for Carcinogenicity for 
Pharmaceuticals.  
The WoE carcinogenic human risk assessment based on a comprehensive review of all available 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 16/113 
 
  
 
 
 
 
pharmacological, biological, and toxicological data (see below) demonstrates that the carcinogenic risk 
of letermovir to humans is negligible. As such, according to the MAH, the conduct of a 2-year rat 
carcinogenicity study would not add value to human carcinogenicity risk assessment and is not 
warranted to support the continuous use of letermovir for up to 200 days post-transplant in kidney 
transplant recipients, as per ICH S1B(R1) Addendum to Testing for Carcinogenicity for 
Pharmaceuticals. Of note, scientific advice from EMA CHMP was previously obtained (MAY-2018), and 
the Agency concluded that “the omission of a carcinogenicity study to support administration for up to 
200 days could be agreed, provided that there are no signals for development of neoplasms detected 
during review of the final application dossier”. US FDA and Japan PMDA concurrence on the WoE 
carcinogenicity risk assessment is being sought. 
• Letermovir pharmacological target is an exogeneous target which has no mammalian counterpart 
Letermovir is a non-nucleoside small molecule inhibitor of the CMV terminase complex, which plays a 
key role in cleavage and packaging of genomic CMV DNA. The mechanism of action of letermovir is 
distinct from other currently licensed CMV agents, which inhibit the viral DNA polymerase. Letermovir 
does not inhibit DNA replication. There is no human counterpart of the viral terminase complex, and 
pharmacologically mediated target related toxicities are not expected. 
• Secondary pharmacology screens did not identify any off-target effects of concern Letermovir is not 
expected to pose a carcinogenic risk due to off-target effects 
Letermovir did not show significant off-target binding activity in a panel (63 assays) of radioligand 
binding assays (interaction with mammalian receptors and enzymes) at the concentration tested (10 
μM) [data submitted in the original marketing application]. 
• Non-clinical repeat-dose toxicity studies did not reveal signals that suggest potential for 
carcinogenicity 
There were no histologic findings indicative of a potential risk for carcinogenicity (e.g., proliferative 
changes) in mouse, rat, and monkey repeat-dose toxicity studies [data submitted in the original 
marketing application]. 
In rats, target organs of toxicity were limited to the male reproductive organs at ≥180 mg/kg/day 
(≥3-fold the clinical exposure at the recommended dose of 480 mg, AUC0-24hr of ~100,000 ng*hr/mL). 
Findings consisted of bilateral seminiferous tubular degeneration, decreased testis weight resulting in 
decreased sperm count and motility, and decreased male fertility. In addition, slight non-adverse 
hepatocellular hypertrophy and increase in liver weight were observed in repeat dose toxicity studies 
at doses ≥60 mg/kg/day and did not progress to liver hyperplasia in studies of up to 6 months in 
duration (approximately 1/4 to 1/5 rat life expectancy). This non-adverse liver change is related to 
induction of metabolizing enzymes. In vitro studies in human hepatocytes demonstrate that letermovir 
induced the expression of CYP3A4 mRNA and to a minor extent, CYP2B6 mRNA [data submitted in the 
original marketing application]. These results support the assertion that letermovir-induced 
hepatocellular hypertrophy in rats is through CAR/PXR activation which is deemed not to be a relevant 
mechanism for hepatocarcinogenesis in humans (Elcombe et al 2014). Importantly, the liver findings 
were shown to be reversible (or showed a trend towards recovery) after a 4-week treatment-free 
period. Overall, in the repeat dose study in rats, there was no evidence of diffuse and/or focal cellular 
hyperplasia, persistent tissue injury and/or chronic inflammation, pre-neoplastic changes, or tumours, 
which may be indicative of a carcinogenicity risk. 
In mouse repeat-dose toxicity studies, there were no target organs of toxicity. Histological changes 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 17/113 
 
  
 
 
were limited to non-adverse hepatocellular hypertrophy (associated with increased liver weight). The 
liver hypertrophy did not progress to hyperplasia in the 6-month rasH2-Tg mouse carcinogenicity 
study. As in rats, this non-adverse liver change is related to induction of metabolizing enzymes. 
In monkeys, no target organ of toxicity was identified by histomorphological examination in studies up 
to 9 months in duration. 
• There was no evidence of carcinogenic risk associated with endocrine or hormonal perturbations 
There were no test article-related organ weight or histomorphological changes in any endocrine organs 
in the repeat-dose toxicity study in mice and monkeys. In rats, male reproductive organ findings, 
including decreased testis weight, bilateral seminiferous tubular degeneration, decreased sperm count 
and motility, and resultant decreased male fertility were observed. There were no organ weight or 
histomorphological changes in any other endocrine organs, indicating that the male reproductive organ 
findings were related to a direct effect of letermovir on these organs. The associated decreased serum 
inhibin B was considered secondary to the observed effect of letermovir on Sertoli cells. These findings 
are consistent with those observed with boceprevir (a hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease 
inhibitor) where testicular degeneration (including Sertoli cell toxicity) was only seen in rats (no 
testicular toxicity in mice and monkeys), monitoring of inhibin B and semen in Phase 1 and 2 clinical 
trials showed no evidence of testicular toxicity in humans, and no drug-related neoplasms were 
observed in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats. In Phase 3 trials with letermovir, there was no 
evidence of letermovir-related testicular toxicity in male participants based on analysis of biomarkers 
used to monitor gonadotoxicity (serum inhibin B, LH, FSH, and testosterone). The lack of findings in 
the male reproductive system following letermovir dosing in monkeys and mice, and the lack of 
changes in biomarkers of testicular toxicity in the Phase 3 clinical trials suggests that testicular findings 
in rats are specific to this species. 
There were no changes in the rat female fertility study, no findings related to hormonal perturbation in 
the embryo-foetal development and pre- and postnatal studies, and no changes of concern in any 
other endocrine organs were observed. 
There were no hormonal changes (testosterone, inhibin B and FSH levels) in a 3-month fertility study 
in monkeys and no test article-related organ weight or histomorphological endocrine changes in the 
repeat-dose toxicity studies in monkeys. 
There were no changes in endocrine organ weight or histomorphological changes in the 6-month 
rasH2-Tg mouse study. 
In summary, according to the MAH, there is no evidence of a carcinogenic risk associated with 
endocrine or hormonal perturbations in any of the toxicity studies or in any of the reproductive toxicity 
studies. 
• Letermovir was non-genotoxic in vitro and in vivo 
Letermovir was nongenotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo studies carried out according to ICH 
guidance that included a microbial mutagenesis assay, a chromosomal aberrations assay, and in vivo 
assays for micronucleus induction in bone marrow in mice. In the in vitro genotoxicity studies, 
letermovir was tested for clastogenicity and mutagenicity up to concentrations that caused 
cytotoxicity. Similarly in the micronucleus study in male mice, doses up to the limit of toxicity were 
used. 
• There was no evidence that letermovir is immunosuppressive 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 18/113 
 
  
 
 
There was no evidence of immune suppression in the repeat dose non-clinical toxicity studies. There 
were no haematological changes such as leukopenia/leucocytosis, granulocytopenia/granulocytosis, or 
lymphopenia/lymphocytosis in any species up to the highest doses tested. No alterations in organ 
weights and/or histology were identified in immune tissues (lymphoid tissue, bone marrow, thymus). 
There were no significant changes on relevant clinical chemistry parameters such as serum globulins. 
Specific immunotoxicity endpoints were evaluated in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats including 
determination of spleen cell counts, immunophenotyping of splenocytes, serum antibody titers and/or 
the Plaque Forming Cell Assay. Of these endpoints, the changes noted in the study report were limited 
to slight increased CD4 T cells, B cells, antigen presenting cells, and CD45total and CD45low cells and 
decreased CD45high cells [data submitted in the original marketing application]. Upon consideration of 
the totality of the non-clinical data, according to the MAH, these findings are not considered adverse 
and are not indicative of immunosuppression. 
• The 6-month rasH2-Tg mouse carcinogenicity study did not reveal signals of concern 
In the 6-month oral rasH2-Tg mouse carcinogenicity study, letermovir-related proliferative changes 
were limited to benign papilloma and focal reactive hyperplasia in the non-glandular stomach 
(forestomach) observed at the high dose (300 mg/kg/day) in female mice only. The benign papilloma 
did not progress to carcinoma, indicating the relatively slow rate of growth of the papillomatous tissue. 
These findings were considered, by the MAH, a nongenotoxic, adaptive response to the prolonged 
presence of high concentration of a poorly soluble and irritant test article in the rodent forestomach 
and were not relevant to humans because humans do not have a forestomach. 
• Metabolism and distribution of letermovir is similar across humans and animal toxicology species 
Qualitatively, the in vitro metabolism of letermovir across humans and toxicology species is similar and 
predictive of the in vivo biotransformation route. In ADME studies, letermovir and an oxidative 
metabolite (M5) are the major radioactive components circulating in rat plasma with M5 being the 
main drug related material after 24 hours. In humans, letermovir is the major (~97%) radioactive 
component circulating in plasma, indicative of no major circulating metabolites. 
• No safety signals related to cancer have been identified post-marketing 
No safety signals related to cancer have been identified in the post-marketing cumulative data from 
01-NOV-2017 (IBD) through 01-May-2022 including approximately 111,957 patients exposed to 
letermovir. 
• Letermovir is not intended to be administered over a substantial part of a patient's lifetime 
The continuous use of letermovir is expected to be for up to 200 days, i.e., 6 months and 
approximately 2 weeks. This duration is not a substantial part of a patient's lifetime and negligibly 
exceeds the duration of continuous clinical use (at least 6 months) specified in ICH S1A guideline as 
one of the considerations in assessing the need for carcinogenicity studies. The duration of 200 days 
(6.5 months) vs. 6 months is not considered a toxicologically meaningful difference in duration in a 
patient’s lifetime. In addition, letermovir is not intended to be used repeatedly or in the treatment of 
chronic or recurrent conditions. 
Overall, according to the MAH, the human carcinogenic risk of letermovir has been assessed 
adequately and is negligible, based on the WoE-based risk assessment provided above. A 2-year rat 
carcinogenicity study would not add value to a human carcinogenicity risk assessment and is not 
warranted, as per the ICH S1B(R1) Addendum to Testing for Carcinogenicity for Pharmaceuticals.

2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH did not provide an updated ERA for the active ingredient letermovir. Instead, a justification 
for not submitting an updated environmental risk assessment has been proved as outlined below. 
In the current variation application for PREVYMIS™ (letermovir), an Environmental Risk Assessment 
has not been included. 
The approved indication for PREVYMIS is: 
“PREVYMIS is indicated for prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in adult CMV-
seropositive recipients [R+] of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).” 
The environmental risk assessment for letermovir was approved on 8 Jan 2018 as part of the initial 
MAA for PREVYMIS (EMEA/H/C/004536/0000). 
With this variation application, the proposed indication is: 
“For prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in adult D+/R- (CMV seropositive 
organ donor/CMV seronegative organ recipient) kidney transplant recipients.” 
In the Notice to MAHs for the CTD format (Vol. 2B, May 2008), it is stated for Module 1.6 that: 
“Applications for marketing authorizations should include in Annex to Module 1 an indication of any 
potential risks presented by the medicinal product for the environment” and “in case of a new 
indication with significant increase of the extent of use.” 
The MAH does not consider these requirements to be applicable since the assumptions in the approved 
ERA regarding patient population, dose, and market penetration are relevant today. Therefore, the 
approved ERA included in the initial MAA is also applicable for the current variation application. No 
significant increase in use of PREVYMIS compared to the estimates in the approved environmental risk 
assessment is expected to occur as a result of this variation application. 
The results of the cited assessment showed letermovir is unlikely to pose a risk to the environment. 
The estimated predicted environmental concentration/predicted no-effect concentration ratios were all 
well below levels of concern. Based on the measured octanol- water partition coefficient, letermovir is 
not expected to bioaccumulate and is not considered to be a persistent, bio accumulative and toxic 
compound. Therefore, no further action is necessary and no special precautionary or safety measures 
need to be taken for the storage, labelling, administration, and disposal of letermovir. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In support of the initial MAA (EMEA/H/C/004536/0000), a comprehensive non-clinical program was 
completed. This program included in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity studies, oral and IV acute toxicity 
studies in rats and mice, repeat-dose oral toxicity studies (up to 3, 6, and 9 months in duration in 
mice, rats, and monkeys, respectively), 4-week IV toxicity studies in rats and monkeys, local IV 
tolerability studies in rats and rabbits, a series of reproductive and developmental studies in rats and 
rabbits, and a toxicity study in juvenile male rats.  
In this variation, a 26-week carcinogenicity study in CByB6F1-Tg(HRAS)2Jic hemizygous mice has 
been completed to support the application for indications where the duration of continuous treatment is 
longer than 6 months (e.g. 200 days). In addition, a WoE-based carcinogenicity risk assessment has 
been provided in accordance with the recently adopted ICH S1B(R1) Addendum to Testing for 
Carcinogenicity for Pharmaceuticals. 
The maximum dose (480 mg/day) is the same in both indications, and the clinical exposures are 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 20/113 
 
  
 
 
comparable. The highest projected median letermovir systemic exposure in kidney transplant 
recipients, based on oral exposure and bioavailability (AUC0-24hr = 104,000 ng.hr/mL at 480 mg IV) is 
comparable to the highest clinical median exposure (AUC0-24hr = 99, 960 ng.hr/mL achieved at 480 mg 
IV) in HSCT recipients.  
In the 6-month oral carcinogenicity study in CByB6F1 Tg(HRAS)2Jic hemizygous mice, treatment-
related neoplastic changes were observed in female mice at 300 mg/kg/day. These findings included 
an increased incidence of focal reactive hyperplasia in 6/25 mice and benign papilloma in the 
squamous mucosa of the non-glandular stomach (forestomach) in 2/25 mice. No proliferative, or 
neoplastic changes were present in females or males at lower doses. The letermovir-related focal 
reactive hyperplasia and benign squamous papilloma in the forestomach observed in female mice at 
300 mg/kg/day are likely a consequence of persistent local irritation and not considered translatable to 
humans. The proposed update of SmPC section 5.3 is acceptable.  
A 6-month oral carcinogenicity study in RasH2 transgenic (Tg.RasH2) mice showed no evidence of 
human-relevant tumorigenesis up to the highest doses tested, 150 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day in 
males and females, respectively. 
In addition, the WoE-based carcinogenicity risk assessment supports the conclusion that the 
carcinogenic risk of letermovir to humans is negligible. As such, the conduct of a 2-year rat 
carcinogenicity study would not add value to human carcinogenicity risk assessment and is not 
warranted to support the continuous use of letermovir for up to 200 days. Of note, scientific advice 
from EMA CHMP was previously obtained and the Agency concluded that “the omission of a 
carcinogenicity study to support administration for up to 200 days could be agreed, provided that there 
are no signals for development of neoplasms detected during review of the final application dossier”. 
In conclusion, results from the previously conducted comprehensive non-clinical program along with 
the additional assessment of potential carcinogenicity support the extended treatment duration of 
letermovir, and the proposed indication in adult kidney transplant recipients. Based on the weight of 
evidence assessment performed in accordance with the principles laid out in the ICH S1B(R1) 
addendum, and in light of the 3R principles, a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats is not considered 
warranted. 
In clinical trials, there is a concern that letermovir may have a more immunologically depressive effect 
in kidney transplant patient compared to HSCT-patients. This is heavily confounded by kidney 
transplanted patients being immunosuppressed due to other medication, however, there is a clinical 
concern that letermovir may contribute to a carcinogenic risk through impaired immune-surveillance in 
the kidney transplanted patient population. No immunotoxicity was observed in rats for up to 13-
weeks for letermovir, though it has not been investigated if there could be a more significant potential 
for an immunotoxic response and a related carcinogenic mechanism due to co-mediation. However, 
overall, based on the complete weight of evidence assessment, the carcinogenic potential appears low, 
and further carcinogenic studies are not considered warranted in order to support the extension of 
indication of Prevymis, either prior to or following marketing authorization, i.e. as a post-authorisation 
measure. 
Regarding the ERA, the new/extended indication does not lead to a significant increase in 
environmental exposure further to the use of letermovir. Letermovir is not classified as a PBT or vPvB 
candidate and is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 21/113 
 
  
 
 
exposure further to the use of letermovir.  
- Considering the above data, letermovir is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
In conclusion, the comprehensive non-clinical program previously conducted in support of the original 
marketing authorization of letermovir along with the additional assessment of carcinogenicity support 
the extended use of letermovir by PO or IV administration.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Letermovir is a viral DNA terminase complex inhibitor, currently approved in the EU for the prophylaxis 
of CMV reactivation and disease in adult CMV R+ of an allogeneic HSCT. The first Phase 3 pivotal study 
of LET, Protocol 001 (P001), supported the approval for CMV prophylaxis in adult CMV R+ of an 
allogeneic HSCT.  
The current application includes an extension of indication for use of letermovir for CMV prophylaxis in 
kidney transplant recipients and a modification of the current indication to extend the prophylaxis from 
100 to 200 days post HSCT transplant. In support of this application, the MAH presented data from the 
following clinical studies: 
• 
Protocol 002 was a Phase 3 clinical study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of LET through 
Week 28 post-transplant (approximately 200 days) for the prevention of CMV disease in adult 
kidney transplant recipients with a negative CMV serostatus who received a kidney transplant 
from a donor with a positive CMV serostatus (D+/R–).  
• 
Protocol 040 was a Phase 3 clinical study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of LET to 
support extending the dosing regimen from 100 days to 200 days post-transplant for the 
prophylaxis of CMV infection and/or disease in adult R+ recipients of an allogeneic HSCT. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology profile of LET is well characterized by the data submitted to support the 
initial marketing application. The DDI potential of LET was previously characterized in the initial 
marketing application. No new DDI studies were conducted and no new DDIs were identified on review 
of the concomitant medications used in P002. 
The characterization of LET PK in kidney transplant recipients (P002) is based on a PopPK modelling 
approach. New PK data from study P002 as well as P042 were included in the provided popPK analysis 
in this application. An overview of study P002 and P042 are shown below: 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 22/113 
 
  
 
 
popPK analysis 
In order to build a robust popPK model for Phase 3 in KT recipients (Study P002), where PK sampling 
was conducted using both sparse and rich sampling schedules, additional Phase 1 PK data from Phase 
1 studies and the Phase 3 Japanese KT recipients (Study P042) were included. These additional data 
on (near) steady-state PK data in subjects receiving either 240 mg (with CsA) or 480 mg PO and IV 
helped to strengthen the popPK description of the Phase 3 Study P002. 
The software package nonlinear mixed-effects modelling (NONMEM) (Version 7.4.3; ICON 
Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD, USA) was used in the popPK analysis. 
The PK analysis dataset included 7540 measurable PK observations from 455 subjects. Intensively 
sampled concentration-time profiles were available in 108 subjects from Phase 1 and 53 subjects from 
Phase 3 studies. Sparse data were available in 304 subjects. The LET dose range was 480 mg and 240 
mg (plus CsA coadministration) QD. 
Two continuous covariates (CRCL and WT) and 3 categorical covariates (Asian versus non-Asian, 
healthy subjects versus KT subjects, and CsA coadministration) were tested in the popPK analysis. 
The final popPK model parameter estimates were contained within the 95% CI determined by a robust 
bootstrap analysis based on 903 replicates (out of a 1000 runs, 97 runs failed to minimize). The 
bootstrap 95% CIs are shown in the parameter table for the final model (Table 7).

Table 7: LET popPK Final Model Parameter Estimate 
The pcVPCs for Phase 1 are displayed and stratified by study in Figure 1. The final popPK model was 
able to predict the observed median and p5 and p95 of observed LET concentrations with good 
accuracy in the Phase 1 studies. The pcVPCs for the Phase 3 studies are shown in Figure 2. The final 
popPK model was able to predict the observed median and p5 and p95 of observed LET concentrations 
with reasonable accuracy in Study P002. For Study P002, the median concentration was mostly 
captured throughout the profiles except for the absorption phase where it went outside the predicted 
band. Observed p5 and p95 were slightly outside the predicted bands for short segments of the time 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023

course but generally predicted well. For Study P042, the median profile was not well captured except 
for the Ctrough,ss concentrations at 24 hours. In contrast, the observed p5 and p95 were generally 
predicted well.

Model predicted exposure 
In the kidney transplant population, the predicted overall median AUC0-24 at steady-state following 
480 mg oral LET was estimated to be 62,200 ng·hr/mL, with a 90% prediction interval of 28,900 to 
145,000 ng·hr/mL [Table 2.7.2-ktpro: 1]. This oral exposure in the kidney transplant population is 
approximately ~1.8 times higher when compared to the HSCT (Hematopoietic stem cell transplant) 
population, which had a predicted steady-state AUC0-24 of approximately 34,400 ng·hr/mL (90% 
prediction interval of 16,900 to 73,700 ng·hr/mL). In the kidney transplant population, bioavailability 
of LET was estimated to be approximately 60%, based on the PopPK analysis, which is higher than the 
bioavailability observed in the HSCT recipients (35%). The LET exposure following oral 
coadministration of 240 mg LET with CsA in kidney transplant recipients was comparable to the 
exposure following oral 480 mg LET alone. The bioavailability of LET 240 mg when given with CsA 
could not be estimated accurately independent of clearance. LET PK in kidney transplant recipients 
after 480 mg IV administration are not available as only a small number of participants (n=3) in P002 
received IV LET for a short duration. The projected IV exposure of LET (AUC 104,000 ng·hr/mL) in the 
kidney transplant population is comparable to the IV exposure in HSCT recipients.  
Table 8: Predicted LET AUC (ng hr/mL) in the Phase 3 Kidney Transplant Population (P002) 
CRCL and WT were identified as significant intrinsic factors for exposure. Based on multivariate 
simulations, the GM exposure ratios (AUCss,0-24h ) for CRCL categories (relative to normal renal 
function, CRCL ≥90 mL/min) were 1.35 (90% CI: 1.17 - 1.55), 1.27 (90% CI: 1.17 - 1.38), and 1.12 
(90% CI: 1.02 - 1.21), respectively, for ≥15 to <30 mL/min, ≥30 to <60 mL/min, and ≥60 to <90 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023

mL/min. For WT (>80 kg relative to ≤80 kg), the GM exposure ratio (AUC ss,0-24h ) was 0.741 (90% 
CI: 0.703 - 0.782). For both covariates, this was not considered clinically meaningful. 
Target exposure 
Clinical comparability bounds (0.5, 3.0) for LET have been established as reflecting the range of 
relative change in AUC that would be expected to be clinically comparable to 480 mg QD LET adjusted 
to 240 mg QD LET when co-administered with CsA in kidney transplant recipients with respect to 
safety and efficacy. In establishing the lower clinical bound, the E-R efficacy analysis of Phase 3 (P002) 
data in kidney transplant recipients was examined and showed that there was no exposure. There 
were no PK data available following 480 mg IV LET in kidney transplant recipients. Therefore, the 
steady state LET AUC following 480 mg IV was projected based oral exposure and estimated 
bioavailability. This projected IV AUC of 104,000 ng·hr/mL in the kidney transplant population is 
comparable to the IV exposure in HSCT recipients that was generally well-tolerated, as described in 
the initial marketing application. As such, the upper bound was constructed using the overall clinical 
experience to date dependence on the occurrence of adjudicated CMV disease in this patient population  
Effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors within this range and are not considered clinically relevant. No 
dose adjustments are recommended for LET based on the intrinsic factors assessed in kidney 
transplant recipients, including the impact of renal impairment post-transplantation, weight, age, and 
gender. As such, the highest IV and oral exposures achieved in the Phase 1 studies are around 3-fold 
higher than the projected IV exposure for the kidney transplant recipient following 480 mg LET (Table 
9).

Recipients 
2.3.3.  PK/PD modelling 
The E-R analysis was based on the FAS of the Phase 3 Study P002. In total, 289 subjects in the FAS 
had popPK model-predicted steady-state AUC and C trough measures, albeit that for 15 subjects, no

evaluable PK observations were available. Their exposure measures were imputed based on typical 
population values adjusted for their covariates. 
After approximately 28 weeks of LET treatment post-transplant, subjects were followed through Week 
52 to assess for late-onset CMV disease and DNAemia in Study P002.  
Figure 3 shows the observed LET E-R relationships for adjudicated CMV disease and through Week 52 
post-transplant.

No LET E-R relationship was observed for adjudicated CMV disease through 52 weeks post-transplant 
or its time to onset. In summary, E-R analysis demonstrated no dependence of efficacy endpoints on 
LET exposures over the range of exposures assessed using exposure quartile. 
2.3.4.  Pharmacodynamics 
Introduction  
Phenotypic Analysis of Letermovir Against CMV UL56 AND UL89 Genotypic Variants (Post-marketing 
Requirement 3295-1) 
Letermovir (LET) is a potent inhibitor of cytomegalovirus (CMV) that targets the CMV DNA terminase 
required for viral DNA processing and packaging. Two CMV genes (UL56 and UL89) encode subunits of 
the CMV DNA terminase complex. In the MK-8228 P001 clinical trial, DNA was isolated from plasma 
obtained from recipients of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant who met the primary endpoint of 
clinically significant CMV infection (CS-CMVi) through Week 24 post-transplant, and the UL56 and UL89 
protein coding regions were amplified by PCR and were sequenced using next-generation DNA 
sequencing (NGS). Deduced amino acid changes (relative to a LET-susceptible CMV reference strain) in 
pUL56 and pUL89 were identified, but it is not known whether these are natural polymorphisms or 
resistance-associated variants that emerge during exposure to LET prophylaxis.  
The MAH has submitted a report of the results of P001 phenotypic analysis to determine if any of these 
substitutions had an impact on susceptibility to LET. 
Methods 
Selecting CMV UL56 and UL89 Genotypic Variants (GVs) for Phenotyping  
GVs from the Phase 3 trial were selected for phenotyping based on the following criteria: 
• 
• 
• 
The GV was detected in ≥ 5% of the next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads at that codon 
The GV is at a conserved amino acid in pUL56 or pUL89 
The GV has not been previously characterized for susceptibility to letermovir 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 29/113 
 
  
 
 
 
• 
The GV was detected in ≤ 2 LET subjects 
EC50 values were calculated for newly phenotyped recombinants and matching control strains 
(baseline susceptible strain and LET resistant strains with lower and higher levels of resistance). The 
fold-shift in mean LET EC50 value conferred by each substitution, relative to the UL56/UL89 wild-type 
CMV reference strain, was also determined. CMV strains with substitutions that conferred reduced 
susceptibility to LET were also tested for susceptibility to the CMV DNA polymerase inhibitors 
ganciclovir (GCV), foscarnet (FOS), and cidofovir (CDV). 
Results 
The MAH and the FDA conducted independent analyses to select genotypic variants in the CMV UL56 
and UL89 genes for recombinant phenotyping. The FDA analysis identified 8 substitutions in pUL56 and 
1 in pUL89 for phenotyping; six additional pUL56 substitutions were identified in the MAH’s analysis.  
Drug susceptibility of recombinant CMV strains with substitutions identified in the FDA analysis 
Eight pUL56 substitutions (M3V, E237G, S255L, C325W, E485G, E485G + SNS445- 447deletion, 
Y575C, and R816W) and one pUL89 substitution (I531T) were identified in the FDA analysis. The LET 
EC50 values for the reference strains in these experiments were comparable to previously reported 
values. Seven of the nine novel substitutions had no significant impact on susceptibility to LET (EC50 
ratios ranged from 0.9 to 1.1), but CMV strains with the pUL56 C325W or pUL56 E237G substitutions 
were less susceptible to LET (EC50 shifts of 8262- and 13-fold, respectively). When the susceptibility 
of these two recombinant strains to the CMV DNA polymerase inhibitors GCV, FOS, and CDV was 
measured, there was a small shift (2.1-fold) in the GCV EC50 for the mutant CMV strain with the 
pUL56 E237G substitution. This strain was similar to wild-type in susceptibility to FOS (1.3-fold) and 
CDV (1.4-fold). There were no significant changes in susceptibility to GCV / FOS / CDV for the mutant 
CMV strain with the pUL56 C325W substitution. 
Growth phenotype of recombinant CMV strains with substitutions identified in the FDA analysis 
The recombinant CMV strain with the pUL89 I531T substitution had a growth defect. In contrast, all 
eight CMV strains in this analysis with substitutions in pUL56 grew as well as the UL56 wild-type 
reference strain. 
Drug susceptibility of recombinant CMV strains with additional substitutions identified in the MAH’s 
analysis 
Six additional substitutions in pUL56 (R369T, F626S, L726V, T775I, AVS789-791deletion, and V814A) 
identified in the MAH’s analysis were evaluated using recombinant phenotyping. Five of these 
substitutions met criteria outlined above (see Methods), another (pUL56 R369T) was detected as part 
of longitudinal genotyping of the subject with the pUL56 C325W substitution (testing plasma samples 
collected before and after detection of this mutation). Susceptibility to LET was equivalent to the UL56 
wild-type CMV reference strain for four of these recombinant viruses - EC50 ratios were 1.0 for strains 
with L726V, T775I, AVS789- 791deletion, or V814A substitutions in pUL56. The CMV strain with a 
F626S substitution in pUL56 had an EC50 that was one-half the wildtype value. In contrast, the pUL56 
R369T substitution conferred a 52-fold increase in the EC50 for LET. For the CMV strain with the pUL56 
R369T substitution, slight differences compared to the UL56 wild-type strain in susceptibility to GCV 
was observed (1.5-fold), FOS (1.1-fold), and CDV (1.2-fold). 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 30/113 
 
  
 
 
Growth phenotype of recombinant CMV strains with additional substitutions identified in the MAH’s 
analysis  
The CMV strain with a F626S substitution in pUL56 had a growth defect (requiring 8 days to reach the 
same SEAP activity that the UL56 wild-type CMV reference strain achieved in 6 days).  
Participants with E237G, C325W, and R369T substitutions 
The GV encoding the pUL56 E237G substitution was identified in a participant’s plasma sample 
collected 32 days after discontinuation of LET prophylaxis on Study Week 6 (post-transplant Day 47). 
There were < 151 copies/mL of CMV DNA in the sample and E237G was detected in 4% of the CMV 
UL56 NGS reads. A recombinant CMV strain with the pUL56 E237G substitution had a 13-fold shift in 
the LET EC50 and a 2.1-fold shift in the EC50 for GCV. This substitution had no apparent impact on the 
replicative fitness of CMV. This participant received approximately 3 weeks of valganciclovir therapy 
after discontinuation of LET prophylaxis, and plasma CMV DNA levels were either <151 copies/mL or 
undetectable during this period (through Study Week 48).  
The pUL56 C325W substitution confers a significant (8262-fold) decrease in susceptibility to LET in a 
cell-culture model of infection. The mutation encoding this substitution and 3 other pUL56 C325 
variants (C325F/R/Y) have been described in recent publications (Chou et al 2018; Chou et al 2015). 
In the MK-8228 P001 trial, the genetic variation encoding the pUL56 C325W substitution was detected 
in a participant with clinically significant CMV infection at the time LET prophylaxis was discontinued 
and anti-CMV therapy was initiated, (99% of the NGS reads in a plasma sample with 28096 copies/mL 
of CMV DNA). The participant had detectable CMV DNA (<151 copies/mL) in a plasma sample collected 
when LET prophylaxis was initiated. The pUL56 C325W substitution does not impair the growth of CMV 
in cell culture and does not impact susceptibility to the CMV DNA polymerase inhibitors GCV, FOS, or 
CDV.  
The genetic variant encoding pUL56 R369T was identified in plasma samples as part of a longitudinal 
analysis of the pUL56 C325W substitution. The pUL56 R369T variant was first detected on Day 25 
following discontinuation of LET prophylaxis (12% NGS reads, 7003 CMV DNA copies/mL); however, 
this GV was not detected in plasma containing high concentrations of CMV DNA collected previously. 
Because this GV was not detected at the time the participant met the primary endpoint, the association 
between the pUL56 R369T substitution and virologic breakthrough is unclear. Other substitutions at 
pUL56 R369 (R369G/M/S) that confer a modest decrease in susceptibility to LET in cell culture have 
been described previously (Goldner et al 2014). There was no impact of the pUL56 R369T substitution 
on CMV replicative fitness in the cell-culture model of infection and no significant impact on 
susceptibility to GCV/FOS/CDV. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of LET, including DDIs, have been previously assessed during the initial 
marketing authorisation application. No new DDI or phase 1 studies have been submitted. PK from 
study P002 (completed) and P042 (ongoing) were included in the popPK dataset together with phase 1 
data. This approach is generally considered sufficient for this type II extension of indication for the use 
of Prevymis for CMV prophylaxis in kidney transplant recipient. 
The provided pcVPCs indicate some model misspecification, especially for study P002 where Cmax does 
not appear to be well captured. The MAH has described the model misspecification and discussed that 
the model is adequate for AUC but not Cmax.  
The modelling is not considered to be of high regulatory impact. AUC may also be affected by the 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 31/113 
 
  
 
 
model misspecification, but it is agreed that this is to a lesser extent than Cmax.  
The systemic exposure of letermovir is higher in kidney transplant recipients compared to HSCT 
patients due to higher bioavailability according to the MAH. Kidney transplantation may also affect 
clearance to some degree.  
With regards to safety, the exposure is around 3-fold lower than phase I trials P026 and P004. Also, 
the safety data from study P002 does not indicate any new safety concerns which supports the 
proposed dosing. 
The PK-profile in the Japanese study has a different shape and the exposure is higher compared to 
study P002. The model does not have a good prediction of the data from the Japanese study. The 
SmPC Section 5.2 includes the effect of Asian race on LET PK based on Phase 1 population PK analysis, 
having increased exposure. 
CRCL and body weight were predicted to be influential on exposure of LET. Body weight in the KT 
population ranged from 40.4 kg to 147 kg. In univariate assessment, the impact of WT was evaluated 
by keeping all other covariates at their reference level. For KT recipients weighing 114 kg (95th 
percentile of WT), LET AUC is 24% lower, and for KT recipients weighing approximately 48 kg (5th 
percentile of WT), LET AUC is 44% higher, compared to KT recipients weighing approximately 79 kg 
(50th percentile of WT). The overall change in LET exposures due to WT across the body weight 
extremes evaluated was within the clinical comparability bounds (0.5 to 3) for the program. Thus, the 
effect of body weight on LET exposure is not considered clinically significant. 
Pharmacodynamics 
In the pivotal trial MK-8228 P001, DNA was isolated from plasma obtained from recipients of a 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant who met the primary endpoint of clinically significant CMV infection 
through Week 24 post-transplant. The MAH has submitted a report of the results of P001 phenotypic 
analysis to determine if any of the identified substitutions had an impact on susceptibility to LET. 
Of the 14 pUL56 and 1 pUL89 substitutions tested, 12 had no significant impact on susceptibility to LET 
(pUL56 substitutions M3V, S255L, E485G, E485G + SNS445- 447deletion, Y575C, F626S, L726V, 
T775I, AVS789-791deletion, V814A, and R816W; pUL89 substitution I531T). The other 3 substitutions 
in pUL56 (E237G, C325W, and R369T) conferred a reduction in susceptibility to LET in a cell-culture 
model of CMV infection, with shifts in the LET EC50 relative to a UL56 wild-type CMV reference strain 
of 13-, 8262-, and 52-fold, respectively. 
The replicative fitness of CMV virus with either of these three substitutions were not impaired. 
Susceptibility to GCV/FOS/CDV was overall maintained, only a slight shift (2.1-fold) in the GCV EC50 
for the mutant CMV strain with the pUL56 E237G substitution. 
The C325W was detected in a participant with clinically significant CMV infection at the time LET 
prophylaxis was discontinued (99% of the NGS reads). E237G was found in a plasma sample 32 days 
after discontinuation of LET and only in 4% of NGS reads. The pUL56 R369T substitution was not 
detected at the time the participant met the primary endpoint, but at Day 25 following discontinuation 
of LET in 12% NGS reads. The clinical significance of E237G and R369T substitutions is still unclear. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The E-R was used for dose selection, however the adequacy of the proposed posology used in the 
pivotal study will be based on the assessment of the clinical efficacy and safety data.  
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 32/113 
 
  
 
 
The exposure in kidney transplant recipients is higher than in the previously approved indication 
(HSCT) based on the popPK analysis.  
The PK-profile in the Japanese study has a different shape and the exposure is higher compared to 
study P002, the current text in the SmPC regarding the Asian population is deemed adequate. 
CRCL and body weight were predicted to be influential on exposure of LET. Body weight in the KT 
population ranged from 40.4 kg to 147 kg.  
The clinical pharmacology of LET, including DDIs, have previously been assessed during the initial 
marketing authorisation application. This data, together with the popPK analysis provided are 
considered sufficient regarding clinical pharmacology. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The three substitutions identified from participant’s plasma samples with reduced susceptibility to LET 
(E237G, C325W, and R369T) are known resistance associate variants previously identified in vitro and 
already mentioned in the SmPC Section 5.1.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Rationale for Dose Selection for P002 and P040 
The currently approved dose of LET is 480 mg once daily, administered orally or IV. The dose of LET 
should be reduced to 240 mg once daily when co-administered with cyclosporine. This dose of LET was 
selected for both P002 and P040 clinical studies. For P002, the LET dosage regimen was further 
supported by the E-R analysis for efficacy that indicated the range of exposures (LET AUC by quartiles) 
achieved in the kidney transplant recipients was efficacious (see also Clinical Pharmacology Section 
2.3.3 and 2.3.4).

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Disease in Adult Kidney Transplant Recipients  
Methods  
P002 was a phase III, randomized, active-controlled, multi-site, double-blind study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of letermovir (LET) compared with valganciclovir (VGCV) administered for 200 days 
post-transplant for the prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in adult seropositive 
donor/seronegative recipient (D+/R) kidney transplant recipients.

Figure 4: Study design 
After completion of study intervention at Week 28 post-transplant, participants were followed for 
efficacy, safety, and diagnosis of CMV disease through Week 52 post-transplant. Participants who 
discontinued study intervention early (i.e., before Week 28 post-transplant) were to complete all 
remaining treatment period visits through Week 28 post-transplant, as well as all remaining visits 
through Week 52 post-transplant. All scheduled study visits were to be completed regardless of when 
cessation of study intervention occurred.  
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with CMV disease up to week 52 – that is 24 
weeks post planned discontinuation of study therapy. 
Study participants  
Key inclusion criteria include: 
1.  Had a documented negative serostatus for CMV (i.e., recipient CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) 
seronegative [R-]) within 180 days prior to randomization.  
2.  Anticipate receiving a primary or secondary allograft kidney from a CMV IgG D+ at the time of 
screening AND have received a primary or secondary allograft kidney from a documented D+ 
donor at the time of randomization.  
Note: A donor who is seropositive solely based on having received a CMV seropositive transfusion 
immediately prior to organ donation is not considered to be a D+ in this study. 
3.  Be within 0 (i.e., day of transplantation) to 7 days (inclusive) post-kidney transplant at the 
time of randomization. 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023

Key exclusion criteria include: 
1.  Received a previous solid organ transplant or HSCT. 
Note: Participants who had received a prior primary allograft kidney were enrolled, provided that all 
other inclusion/exclusion criteria were met. 
2.  Was a multi-organ transplant recipient (e.g., kidney-pancreas). 
Note: Double kidney transplant recipients (i.e., transplant of 2 kidneys from the same donor to the 
same recipient simultaneously) were excluded. 
3.  Had a history of CMV disease or suspected CMV disease within 6 months prior to 
randomization. 
4.  Had suspected or known hypersensitivity to active or inactive ingredients of LET formulations,

daily  
Two VGCV-matching placebo tablets  
Two aciclovir (ACV) 400 mg capsules or tablets (each capsule or tablet given every 12 hours) 
for prophylaxis of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV)  
• 
• 
VGCV Arm:  
•  One 480 mg LET-matching placebo tablet or two 240 mg LET-matching placebo tablets  
• 
• 
Two VGCV 450 mg tablets  
Two ACV-matching placebo capsules or tablets (each capsule or tablet given every 12 hours) 
An IV formulation was available for participants unable to tolerate swallowing and/or who had a 
condition interfering with the absorption of the oral formulation. The IV formulation of VGCV was GCV

5 mg/kg. Aciclovir was given for prophylaxis against HSV and VZV in participants in the LET group in 
order to mirror the anti-HSV and anti-VZV activities of VGCV. 
Objectives and endpoints 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 36/113 
 
  
 
 
 
Appropriateness of Measurements  
To standardize the clinical diagnosis of investigator-reported cases of CMV disease, an independent 
blinded Clinical Adjudication Committee was established for this study. All cases of investigator 
reported CMV disease were reviewed by the Clinical Adjudication Committee and required confirmation 
that each case of CMV disease met the criteria for CMV disease provided in the study protocol.   
Definitions:   
CMV infection is defined as virus isolation or detection of viral proteins (antigens) or nucleic acid in any 
body fluid or tissue specimen.   
CMV disease consists of the two following clinical definitions:  
1) CMV end-organ disease; alternatively   
2) “probable CMV syndrome” (which will be termed “CMV syndrome”).   
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 37/113 
 
  
 
 
    
•  CMV end-organ disease may be further described by:   
o  The specific type of end-organ disease (e.g., pneumonia, gastrointestinal disease, or 
hepatitis); and 
o  By appropriate clinical signs/symptoms with documentation of CMV by:  
▪  Histopathology, virus isolation, rapid culture, immunohistochemistry, or DNA 
hybridization in tissue (proven CMV end-organ disease); or  
▪  High viral DNA levels detected in tissue from the relevant organ (possible CMV 
end-organ disease).  
•  CMV syndrome requires detection of CMV in blood by virus isolation, rapid culture, 
antigenemia, or nucleic acid testing with at least two of the following criteria:  
1.  Fever ≥38°C for at least 2 days  
2.  New or increased malaise or new or increased fatigue  
3.  Leukopenia or neutropenia on two separate measurements at least 24 
hours apart  
4.  ≥5% atypical lymphocytes  
5.  Thrombocytopenia  
6.  Elevation of ALT or AST to 2 × ULN     
Sample size  
Three hundred (300) participants were to be randomized into each treatment arm for a total of 600 
participants. Assuming the true proportion of participants with adjudicated CMV disease is 0.17 for 
both treatment arms, this study has 90% power to demonstrate that LET is non-inferior to VGCV at an 
overall two-sided 5% alpha-level, using a non-inferiority margin of 0.10.  
The minimum criterion for success is that the upper bound of 95% CI of difference (LET minus VGCV) 
<0.10. The observed proportion of participants in the LET arm needs to be less than 4% higher than 
that in the VGCV arm in order to declare non-inferiority. If the observed proportion of participants in 
the LET arm is approximately 9% lower than in the VGCV arm, this is expected to demonstrate 
superiority with 90% power. 
The adjudicated CMV disease incidence of 17% is supported by the results of the IMPACT study. In this 
study, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of D+/R – participants who developed CMV 
disease adjudicated by the CAC. 
Rationale for Non-Inferiority Margin 
The 10% non-inferiority margin used in this study is based on the preservation of the majority of 
efficacy (>50%) of VGCV compared to placebo in preventing CMV disease after renal transplantation 
under a number of scenarios.  
From the VGCV label for 200-day treatment, the CMV disease rate at 12 months post-transplant in the 
VGCV group was 16.8% (26 out of 155), which corresponds to a disease-free rate of 83.2% with a 
95% confidence interval (CI) of (76.4%, 88.7%). The proportion of participants with CMV disease in a 
placebo group at 52 weeks post-transplant was extrapolated from Lowance, et al. [Lowance, D. et al 
1999], which showed that the CMV disease rate was 45% at 90 days after renal transplantation 
(corresponding to a disease-free rate of 55%). Since it is expected that more cases of CMV disease 
would occur between 90 days and 12 months post-transplant, it is reasonable to assume the disease-
free rate in a placebo group at 12 months post-transplant is 50% or less. 
The table below shows the percent of efficacy retained in this study using a 10 percent point margin 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 38/113 
 
  
 
 
for a range of disease-free rates consistent with the above assumptions for the VGCV and placebo 
groups. The percent retained was based on the lower bound of the 95% CI of difference in the disease-
free rate (VGCV - Placebo), assuming 300 participants per group. 
For example, in the scenario where the VGCV disease-free rate = 90% and the placebo disease-free 
rate = 50%, the 95% two-sided CI for the VGCV rate (270/300) minus the placebo rate (150/300) is 
(33%, 46%) using the Miettinen and Nurminen method [Miettinen, O. and Nurminen, M. 1985]. A 10 
percentage point non-inferiority margin would indicate that the lower bound for this difference in the 
study could be as low as 23% (33% minus 10%); thus, the percent retained would be 23/33 = 69.7%. 
According to the MAH this is a conservative approach since the lower bound of the 95% CI was used as 
the historical effect and a range of possible placebo rates were used in the calculations. In the majority 
of scenarios in Table 1, more than 50% of the efficacy is retained using the 10 percentage point 
margin. Thus, a 10 percentage point margin is proposed in this study. 
Table 11: Percentage of Efficacy Retained with 10 percentage point Margin (n = 300/arm) 
Randomisation  
All eligible participants will be randomly allocated and will receive a treatment/randomization number. 
A single participant cannot be assigned more than 1 treatment/randomization number. A total of 601 
D+/R- kidney transplant recipients were randomized within 7 days post-transplant in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive LET or VGCV from Day 1 (day of randomization) through Week 28 post-transplant. Randomized 
participants were stratified by the use or non-use of highly cytolytic antilymphocyte immunotherapy 
during induction, which is associated with risk for CMV infection.  
Blinding (masking)  
A double-blinding technique with in-house blinding was used. IV LET, IV GCV, IV ACV (for participants 
in the LET arm), and IV ACV matching placebo (for participants in the VGCV arm) will be prepared in a 
blinded fashion by an unblinded pharmacist (or qualified study site personnel designated to prepare 
blinded IV study therapy). If a participant’s dose of VGCV or VGCV matching placebo is modified due to 
renal insufficiency, the blinding to VGCV or VGCV matching placebo will be maintained. Similarly, if a 
participant’s dose of ACV or ACV matching placebo is modified due to renal insufficiency, the blinding 
to ACV or ACV matching placebo will be maintained.  
A total of 5 incidents of participant unblinding occurred during the study through Week 52 post-
transplant:  
▪ 
Two participants were inadvertently unblinded to a blinded non-site staff clinical research 
associate during the study. Although the blinded clinical research associate was inadvertently 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 39/113 
 
  
 
 
 
unblinded, it was confirmed that the blinded site personnel did not see the unblinded 
documentation and unblinding did not occur. The clinical research associate was subsequently 
removed from the study. These events were reported as important protocol deviations and 
were not considered clinically important.  
▪ 
Three participants were unblinded per protocol in order to receive the most appropriate 
treatment for CMV disease. Two of the participants were unblinded after completion of the 
study, and the third participant was unblinded due to lack of efficacy after completion of 
treatment. These events were not considered to be protocol deviations.  
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants with adjudicated CMV disease through 
52 weeks post-transplant. If the primary objective of non-inferiority was achieved, superiority of LET 
versus VGCV were to be evaluated by comparing the proportion of participants with adjudicated CMV 
disease through 52 weeks post-transplant. 
Analysis Populations 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): The FAS population will serve as the primary population for the analysis of 
efficacy data in this study. The FAS population consists of all randomized participants who received at 
least one dose of study treatment, are D+/R-, and had no detectable CMV viral DNA (measured by 
central laboratory) on Day 1.  
Per Protocol (PP): The PP population will serve as a supportive analysis population. The PP population 
excludes participants due to important deviations from the protocol that may substantially affect the 
results of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. 
All Subjects as Treated (ASaT): The ASaT population will be used for the analysis of safety data in this 
study. 
Efficacy Analysis 
To test the primary hypothesis that LET is non-inferior to VGCV in the prevention of CMV disease, the 
difference between the two treatment arms in the proportions of participants with adjudicated CMV 
disease through 52 weeks post-transplant and the associated two-sided 95% CI will be calculated 
using the stratum-adjusted Mantel-Haenszel method with stratification by highly cytolytic anti-
lymphocyte therapies. LET will be concluded to be non-inferior to VGCV if the upper bound of the two-
sided 95% CI for the difference in proportion of participants with adjudicated CMV disease (LET - 
VGCV) is no higher than 0.10. 
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the FAS population, with the PP population 
considered a supportive approach. A sensitivity analysis including those participants who were 
assessed by the investigator to have CMV disease regardless of the CAC determination will be 
performed. An additional sensitivity analysis will be performed where any participant who discontinues 
study treatment but thereafter is started on CMV prophylaxis at the discretion of the investigator is 
considered a failure. Provided non-inferiority is established, a hypothesis that LET is superior to VGCV 
in the prevention of CMV disease will be tested. The stratum-adjusted Mantel-Haenszel method (with 
continuity correction) will be used to compare the two treatment arms with respect to the proportion of 
participants with adjudicated CMV disease through 52 weeks post-transplant using the stratification 
factor of highly cytolytic anti-lymphocyte therapies.  
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 40/113 
 
  
 
 
LET will be concluded to be superior to VGCV if the upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the 
difference in proportion of participants with adjudicated CMV disease (LET - VGCV) is less than 0. 
To assess the difference in the proportion of participants with adjudicated CMV disease through 28 
weeks post-transplant, the same method as for primary endpoint will be used. Formal hypothesis 
testing will be done on this endpoint in the event that the second primary hypothesis of superiority is 
met. 
Time to onset of adjudicated CMV disease through 52 weeks post-transplant will be estimated using 
the nonparametric Kaplan-Meier method. The Kaplan-Meier curve will be plotted by treatment arm and 
a p-value for the between arm difference in time to onset of adjudicated CMV disease will be provided 
using the stratified log-rank test with stratification by highly cytolytic anti-lymphocyte therapies. 
Observations will be censored at the time of discontinuation from the study, or at completion of the 
study. 
Missing Data Handling 
The primary missing data approach will be the Observed Failure (OF) approach. Using this approach, 
participants who discontinue prematurely from the study for any reason are not considered failures. 
The Non-Completer = Failure (NC = F) approach will be used as a supportive analysis. Non-completers 
refers to participants who prematurely discontinue from the study for any reason without having 
developed CMV disease. Using the NC = F approach, these participants will also be considered failures. 
Additional analysis to evaluate the potential effect of violations in assumptions about the missing data 
may be performed. 
Interim Analyses 
No interim analyses for efficacy were planned or performed. 
Multiplicity 
The primary efficacy hypothesis for non-inferiority will be tested at a two-sided alpha level of 5% 
because no interim efficacy analyses will be performed. If the primary efficacy hypothesis testing for 
non-inferiority of LET is met, the second primary hypothesis of superiority will be tested at the two-
sided Type I error rate of 5%. If the second primary hypothesis of superiority is met, similar step-
down hypothesis testing will be performed for the secondary endpoint of adjudicated CMV disease 
through 28 weeks post-transplant. Other efficacy analyses will be considered secondary or 
explanatory.

Recruitment  
Study centres: This study was conducted at 94 centres in 16 countries: New Zealand, Australia, 
Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, Poland, Argentina, Colombia, 
Mexico, Canada, USA and Hungary.  
Study status: This study is complete; this report is based on the final analysis.  
Conduct of the study  
Changes to the planned analyses  
Changes to the planned analysis not previously described in a protocol amendment or in the 
supplemental SAP are described below. 
The protocol specified that the time to onset of adjudicated CMV disease through Week 52 post-
transplant (secondary endpoint) would be calculated in days from the day of randomization to the day 
of onset. However, the time to onset was instead calculated in days from the day of transplant to the 
day of onset.  
The study protocol definition for leukopenia or neutropenia described a WBC count of ≤3500 cells/µL 
and ≤1000 cells/µL, respectively. The actual analyses defined leukopenia and neutropenia as <3500 
cells/μL and <1000 cells/μL, respectively. There were no changes in the planned analyses following 
study unblinding and no post-hoc analyses were performed due to the COVID-19 pandemic or any 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 42/113 
 
  
 
 
  
 
other reason. 
Protocol amendments  
P002-05, 27-Aug-2019: To add the requirement that the intravenous (IV) formulation of letermovir 
(LET) supplied by the Sponsor to sites as study medication must be administered through a sterile 0.2-
micron or 0.22-micron polyethersulfone (PES) in-line filter and using diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP)-
free IV bags and infusion set materials (the same applies for placebo and aciclovir to maintain 
blinding). This requirement is being added to prevent the possible administration of product-related 
particulate matter. The presence of visible product-related particulate matter is an expected 
characteristic of new clinical supplies of the IV formulation of LET.  
P002-04, 11-Feb-2019 : To add strong and moderate inducers of transporters (e.g., Pglycoprotein [P-
gp]) and/or enzymes (e.g., uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase [UGT]) to the list of prohibited 
medications due to the potential for co-administration to result in a decrease in letermovir plasma 
concentrations.  
P002-03, 29-May-2018: To permit potential participants to be consented and screened up to 5 days 
(inclusive) after transplant surgery instead of requiring the completion of all screening procedures prior 
to transplant.  
P002-02, 21-Feb-2018: To add two laboratory exclusion criteria for consistency with the valganciclovir 
(VGCV) product circular information.  
P002-01, 07-Dec-2017: To add a letermovir (LET) 240 mg dose group when administered 
intravenously (IV) without cyclosporine (CsA). LET has previously been evaluated in a Phase 3 trial in 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients at doses of 240 mg PO or IV when administered 
with CsA, and 480 mg PO or IV when administered without CsA. All doses were generally well-tolerated 
and efficacious; however, LET exposures (steady state median AUC) in HSCT recipients with the 480 
mg IV dose (without CsA) were higher than in the other three dose groups. Population 
pharmacokinetic (PK) simulations using data from the Phase 3 trial in HSCT recipients suggest that a 
240 mg IV dose (without CsA) will provide exposures comparable to exposures obtained following 
administration of a 480 mg PO dose (without CsA). Therefore, an additional dose group of 240 mg IV 
(without CsA) is being added to the current protocol to evaluate the PK, efficacy, and safety of this 
dose in transplant recipients. Participants who receive IV LET (without CsA) will be randomized 1:1 to 
receive either a 480 mg or 240 mg dose.  
P002-00, 21-Sep-2017: Original protocol  
Protocol Deviations  
Important protocol deviations were reported for 100 (33.2%) participants in the LET group and 105 
(35.0%) participants in the VGCV group. Of these, 63 (20.9%) participants in the LET group and 61 
(20.3%) participants in the VGCV group had important protocol deviations that were considered 
clinically important.  
The most frequently reported clinically important protocol deviations in both intervention groups were:  
•  Related to study procedures (LET: 39 [13.0%]; VGCV: 34 [11.3%]): CMV disease visit 
procedures, including collection of blood samples for safety monitoring, were not performed 
prior to starting anti-CMV therapy.  
•  Administration of improperly stored study intervention (LET: 16 [5.3%]; VGCV: 14 [4.7%]). 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 43/113 
 
  
 
 
The protocol deviations were comparably distributed between intervention groups. Participants data 
were excluded from the efficacy analyses due to important protocol deviations (i.e., PP population). A 
sensitivity analysis of the PP population showed no impact on the primary endpoint (performed on 
FAS).  
No important protocol deviations were classified as a serious GCP noncompliance issue. Part of this 
study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Important and not important protocol deviations 
associated with the pandemic were reported for 98 (32.6%) participants in the LET group and 107 
(35.7%) participants in the VGCV group. All clinically important protocol deviations associated with the 
pandemic were related to study procedures and the administration of improperly stored study 
intervention.

Medical History  
Reported medical history conditions were as expected for the adult kidney transplant population and 
were generally comparable between intervention groups. Overall, the 3 most frequently reported 
medical history conditions were hypertension, end-stage renal disease, and anaemia.    
Prior and Concomitant Medications/Treatments  
Reported prior and concomitant medications were generally comparable between intervention groups. 
The 3 most frequently reported prior therapies were tacrolimus, paracetamol, and furosemide. The 3 
most frequently reported concomitant therapies during both the Treatment Phase (through Week 28 
post-transplant) and the Treatment and Follow-up Phase (through Week 52 post-transplant) were 
tacrolimus, prednisone, and mycophenolate mofetil.

Table 14: Data sets analysed  
Participants Included in the Efficacy Analyses  
The primary efficacy analyses were conducted using the FAS population. Of the 601 randomized 
participants, 15 participants were excluded from the FAS population (12 participants did not receive 
study intervention [5 of whom also had incorrect serostatus], 2 participants had detectable CMV DNA 
on Day 1, and 1 participant entered the study with incorrect serostatus. The remaining 586 
randomized participants received at least 1 dose of study intervention and were included in the FAS 
population. Supportive efficacy analyses were conducted using the PP population.  
Safety Analysis Population  
Safety analyses were based on the APaT population, which included all 589 randomized participants 
who received at least 1 dose of study intervention according to the study intervention they received.

Concordance between the adjudication committee and the investigator assessment of CMV disease was 
comparable for the LET and VGCV groups. Of the 105 investigator-reported cases, 65 were adjudicated 
“yes” and 40 were adjudicated “no”. Most of the CMV disease events adjudicated “no” were end-organ 
disease events that lacked sufficient documentation of tissue invasive disease (i.e., biopsy or bronchial 
lavage were not performed) as specified in the adjudication charter.  
Sensitivity analyses  
Results of a sensitivity analysis using the NC=F approach in the FAS population and the OF approach in 
the PP population were consistent with the primary analysis (see tables below).

immunotherapy during induction).   
Note: LET is given concomitantly with aciclovir. VGCV is given concomitantly with a placebo to aciclovir. 
The results of a supportive analysis using the NC=F approach in the FAS population were consistent 
with the OF approach.

Patient-reported Outcomes  
EQ-5D 
The EQ-5D VAS score was comparable at baseline for the LET and VGCV groups. The mean scores from 
baseline improved, and mean changes in scores were comparable at Week 52 post-transplant and at 
the CMV disease/Early Discontinuation Visit in both groups.   
SF-36v2 
For the SF-36v2, baseline mean scores were comparable in the LET and the VGCV groups. For both 
groups there were improvements in mean scores on the 8 domains and 2 components from baseline to 
Week 52 post-transplant. Mean change in scores from baseline to Week 52 post-transplant trended 
higher in the LET group compared with the VGCV group for the vitality, bodily pain, and role emotional 
domains. For all remaining domains and the 2 component scores, mean changes from baseline to 
Week 52 post-transplant were comparable between the LET and VGCV groups.     
Viral Resistance Through Week 52 Post-transplant   
Resistance testing was performed on samples obtained from participants prior to initiation of CMV 
treatment or who had suspected or confirmed CMV disease. The proportion of participants with 
resistance-associated substitutions was 0% in the LET group (LET resistance-associated substitution: 
pUL51, pUL56, pUL89) and 12.1% in the VGCV group (VGCV resistance-associated substitution: 
pUL54, pUL97). An additional 4 participants in the VGCV group had VGCV resistance-associated 
substitutions identified at a visit after a CMV disease visit (6 days after the CMV disease visit [n=1], 1 
month after a CMV disease visit [n=2], and 4 months after the CMV disease visit [n=1]).

CMV gB genotypes  
CMV is divided into four genotypes according to the polymorphisms in UL55 gene that encodes for 
envelope glycoprotein B. It has previously been shown that the activity of letermovir is not significantly 
affected by the gB genotype of CMV. 
Genetic variation of the CMV gB genotype was evaluated by DNA sequencing from samples obtained 
from participants prior to initiation of CMV treatment or who had suspected or confirmed CMV disease. 
The distribution among the 5 gB genotypes was comparable for the LET and VGCV groups. The most 
common (42.8% overall) genotype observed in both intervention groups was gB1.

Title: A Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of letermovir (LET) prophylaxis when extended from 100 days to 200 days post-transplant in 
cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositive recipients (R+) of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant 
(HSCT)  
Methods  
This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel assignment, multicentre, double-blind, efficacy and 
safety study evaluating extending LET prophylaxis to 200 days post-transplant in CMV-seropositive 
recipients (R+) of an allogeneic HSCT who had received LET prophylaxis through Week 14 (~100 days) 
post-transplant and who were at high risk for CMV infection and/or disease after completion of LET 
prophylaxis through 100 days post-transplant.

Part of this study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Sponsor continued to follow its 
Standard Operating Procedures for study conduct, monitoring, and oversight during the pandemic and 
employed a risk-based approach to assess and mitigate impact on study conduct.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of participants with clinically significant CMV 
infection from Week 14 (~100 days) post-transplant through Week 28 (~200 days) post-transplant.

Sample size 
Data from P001 in participants who were in the high-risk stratum as defined in P001 were used to 
estimate the clinically significant CMV infection rates for this study, since these populations are similar 
between the two studies. The 100-day arm in this study is similar to those in the high-risk stratum on 
LET who completed treatment without any clinically significant CMV infection in P001, in which 20.5% 
had clinically significant CMV infection after completing treatment and through Week 24 post-
transplant. This would be expected to be slightly higher through Week 28 post-transplant leading to an 
estimate of 22% for through Week 28 post-transplant in this study. The event rate for the 200-day 
arm is expected to be similar to the event rate at the end of LET treatment at Week 14 post-transplant 
for participants in the P001-defined high-risk stratum, which was 10.8% (11/102, including 4 
participants who had discontinued LET due to AEs and then developed CS-CMVi). Since this study will 
enrol participants who will have already tolerated LET for 100 days, it is expected that a lower 
percentage of patients will discontinue treatment due to AEs, thus lowering the overall failure rate in 
the 200-day arm to ~8%.  
This study will randomize a total of 216 participants (in a 2:1 ratio) with 144 in the LET (200-day) arm 
and 72 in the placebo (100-day) arm which will have 80% power at an overall one-sided, 2.5% alpha-
level, to demonstrate the primary hypothesis that extending LET prophylaxis to 200 days post-
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 60/113 
 
  
 
 
  
transplant is superior to 100 days of LET prophylaxis post-transplant in the prevention of clinically 
significant CMV infection. This assumes incidence rates of CS-CMVi of 8% for LET (200-day arm) and 
22% for placebo (100-day arm). The minimum criterion for success is that the upper bound of 95% CI 
of difference < 0. Given the assumed response rate in 200-day arm, this may occur when the observed 
difference between treatment groups is approximately -10% or smaller.  
Randomisation  
Eligible participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive LET (a dose of 480 mg once daily and 
adjusted to 240 mg once daily for participants on cyclosporin A, administered orally or intravenously) 
through Week 28 (LET through 200 days) post-transplant or to receive oral or intravenous placebo 
once daily through Week 28 (LET through 100 days) post-transplant.   
Treatment allocation/randomization will be stratified by:  
1) study centre and  
2) haploidentical donor (yes/no).  
Blinding (masking)  
In this study a double-blinding technique with in-house blinding was used. In order to maintain the 
blinding to the IV study therapy, the unblinded pharmacist (or qualified study site personnel 
designated to prepare blinded IV study therapy) was responsible solely for the preparation of the IV 
study therapy. No confirmed events of premature unblinding were reported for this study.  
Statistical methods  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of participants with clinically significant CMV 
infection from Week 14 (~100 days) post-transplant through Week 28 (~200 days) post-transplant. 
Analysis Populations 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): The FAS population will serve as the primary population for the analysis of 
efficacy data in this study. The FAS population consists of all randomized participants who received at 
least one dose of study treatment. 
All Participants as Treated (APaT): Safety Analyses will be conducted in the APaT population, which 
consists of all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study treatment. 
Efficacy Analysis 
To test the primary hypothesis that LET is superior to placebo in the prevention of clinically significant 
CMV infection when LET prophylaxis is extended from 100 to 200 days post-transplant, the stratum-
adjusted Mantel-Haenszel method (with continuity correction) will be used to compare the proportion 
of subjects with clinically significant CMV infection from Week 14 (~100 days) post-transplant through 
Week 28 (~200 days) post-transplant between the two treatment groups [Koch, G. G., et al 1990]. 
The stratification factor of haploidentical donor (yes/no) will be included in the primary efficacy 
analysis. Cochran Mantel-Haenszel weights will be used to calculate the overall between-group 
differences across strata. LET is concluded superior to placebo if 1-sided p-value is less than or equal 
to 0.0249. Due to the anticipated large number of study centres, study centre will not be included as a 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 61/113 
 
  
 
 
stratification factor in the primary efficacy analysis but may be explored as a sensitivity analysis. The 
primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the FAS population. A sensitivity analysis excluding 
those subjects who had quantifiable CMV viral DNA on Day 1 will be provided. The primary missing 
data approach will be the OF approach; supportive analyses using different missing data approaches 
will also be conducted. 
Two additional sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint will be performed to assess 1) the 
proportion of participants with either CMV disease or PET initiation based on CMV viremia ≥300 
copies/mL (i.e., participants who initiated PET without meeting the threshold will not be considered a 
case of CS-CMVi), and 2) the proportion of participants with either CMV disease or CMV viremia of 
≥300 copies/mL regardless of whether PET was initiated. 
Since the use of a therapy with anti-CMV activity may confound the results of this study, an additional 
sensitivity analysis will be conducted in which participants who start a therapy with anti-CMV activity 
will be censored at the time they begin such therapy. Subjects with CS-CMVi prior to taking a therapy 
with anti-CMV activity will be classified as having CS-CMVi. Those who did not have CS-CMVi prior to 
taking a therapy with anti-CMV activity (including subjects who subsequently develop CS-CMVi) will be 
classified as not having CS-CMVi and censored at the time they started taking the anti-CMV therapy. 
For binary secondary endpoints similar methods was used as for the primary endpoint. 
Time to onset of clinically significant CMV infection from Week 14 post-transplant through 28 weeks 
post-transplant and from Week 14 post-transplant through Week 48 post-transplant will be estimated 
using the nonparametric Kaplan-Meier method. The Kaplan-Meier curve will be plotted by treatment 
arm and a nominal p-value for the between-arm difference in time to onset of clinically significant CMV 
infection will be provided using the stratified log-rank test stratified by haploidentical donor (yes/no). 
Observations will be censored at last assessment. Time to all-cause mortality from Week 14 post-
transplant through 28 weeks post-transplant and from Week 14 post-transplant through Week 48 
post-transplant will be estimated similarly. 
Missing Data Handling 
There are three types of missing values: 
• 
Intermittent missing values due to a missed or skipped visit. 
•  Monotone (non-intermittent) missing due to premature discontinuation from the study: viremia 
at study discontinuation. 
•  Monotone missing due to premature discontinuation from the study: no viremia at study 
discontinuation. 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 62/113 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Summary of Approaches to Handle Missing Values 
The primary missing data approach will be the Observed Failure (OF) approach in order to obtain an 
estimate of the proportion of clinically significant CMV infection in participants who receive prophylaxis 
study treatment. Using this approach, participants who develop clinically significant CMV infection or 
participants who discontinue prematurely from the study with viremia will be counted as failures, and 
participants who discontinue prematurely from the study for any reason without viremia or those who 
are missing data at the time points of interest are not considered failures. Imputing all participants 
who discontinue from the study prematurely without viremia as failures is likely to substantially 
overestimate the proportion of participants with clinically significant CMV infection. 
Two secondary missing data approaches will be used for supportive analyses. The first is the Data-As-
Observed (DAO) approach. In the DAO approach, any participant with missing value for a particular 
endpoint, either because they discontinued from the study without the endpoint or are missing data at 
the key time point (e.g., missed visit, missing lab value), will be excluded from the analysis. The 
second approach is the Non-Completer = Failure (NC=F) approach, which provides the worse-case 
scenario estimate of the proportion of clinically significant CMV infection. Non-completers refer to 
participants who prematurely discontinue from the study for any reason without having developed CMV 
infection or participants who are missing data at the time points of interest. These participants will be 
considered failures using the NC=F approach. 
Interim Analyses 
No formal interim analyses for efficacy are planned for this study. However, to allow for an assessment 
of benefit-risk, efficacy data will be included as part of the periodic safety reviews when at least 40% 
of the participants have completed treatment or discontinued prior to completing treatment. The DMC 
will monitor the trial with suggested periodic reviews occurring approximately every 6 months. 
Treatment-level results from the interim analysis will be provided to the DMC by the unblinded 
statistician. Prior to final study unblinding, the unblinded statistician will not be involved in any 
discussions regarding modifications to the protocol, statistical methods, identification of protocol 
deviations, or data validation efforts after the interim analyses. 
Multiplicity 
The DMC will be provided with unblinded descriptive summaries of the efficacy data at their periodic 
safety reviews when at least 40% of the participants have completed treatment or discontinued prior 
to completing treatment for an assessment of benefit-risk. No formal efficacy analyses will be provided 
and there is no intention of stopping the trial due to overwhelming efficacy at any of these safety 
reviews. Nevertheless, since unblinded efficacy data are being periodically reviewed, using a Haybittle-
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 63/113 
 
  
 
 
 
Peto α-spending approach, a small amount of alpha (α = 0.0001) will be allocated for each of these 
looks before testing the primary efficacy hypothesis at Week 28 post-transplant. An allowance will be 
made such that a total of up to three of these unblinded efficacy reports may be presented at these 
periodic safety reviews.  
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 220 participants were randomized. The rate of discontinuation of study intervention was 
higher in the placebo (100 days LET) group (24.0%) than in the LET (200 days LET) group (17.2%). 
One participant discontinued study intervention due to an AE associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.   
Among the treated participants, 16.8% participants discontinued the study before Week 48 post-
transplant. The most common reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal by participant and death.  
Three participants discontinued the study due to COVID-19 pandemic.   
Of the 35 nonrandomized participants, 34 were screen failures due to not meeting inclusion criteria or 
meeting exclusion criteria, and 1 was due to physician decision.

Conduct of the study  
Protocol Amendments  
Changes in the conduct of the study implemented by protocol amendment are summarized in below. 
There were no changes in the planned conduct of the study implemented by protocol amendment due 
to the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Amendment 02, 10-JAN-2020: The primary purpose of this protocol amendment is to limit enrolment 
of participants who have anti-thymocyte globulin as the only high-risk category for CMV reactivation to 
≤20% of the total trial population. This is to ensure that the preponderance of evidence does not come 
from participants with anti-thymocyte globulin as the only high-risk category for late CMV reactivation.  
Amendment, 01 23-AUG-2019: The primary purpose of this protocol amendment is to add the 
requirement that the intravenous (IV) formulation of letermovir (and placebo) supplied by the Sponsor 
to sites as study medication must be administered through a sterile 0.2- micron or 0.22-micron 
polyethersulfone (PES) in-line filter and using diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP)-free IV bags and infusion 
set materials. This requirement is being added to prevent the possible administration of product-
related particulate matter. The presence of visible product-related particulate matter is an expected 
characteristic of new clinical supplies of IV formulation of LET.  
Original Protocol (Version 00) 03-DEC-2018     
Protocol Deviations  
Important protocol deviations were reported for 39 participants in the LET group and 14 participants in 
the placebo group. Of these, 20 participants in the LET group and 5 in the placebo group had at least 1 
clinically important protocol deviation. 
Part of this study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Important and non-important 
protocol deviations associated with the pandemic were reported for 33 participants in the LET group 
and 22 participants in the placebo group. There was only 1 important protocol deviation associated 
with the pandemic and it was in the LET group. None of the protocol deviations associated with the 
pandemic were clinically important. No participants were excluded from any analyses due to protocol 
deviations associated with the pandemic. 
No participants were excluded from any analyses due to an important protocol deviation. 
No protocol deviations were classified as a serious GCP compliance issue.

Medical History  
Medical history conditions were generally comparable between the LET (200 days LET) and placebo 
(100 days LET) groups. The most frequently reported medical conditions were acute myeloid 
leukaemia (41.3%), hypertension (39.4%), and anaemia (27.1%).  
Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Overall, the distribution of prior and concomitant medications was generally comparable between the 
LET and placebo groups.  
The most frequently reported classes of prior medications included antivirals for systemic use (100%), 
ophthalmologicals (99.1%), and immunosuppressants (97.7%). The majority of participants (87.6%) 
had received calcineurin inhibitors and approximately half of all participants (48.6%) had received 
systemic corticosteroid before study entry. The most frequently reported classes of concomitant 
medications during the treatment phase were ophthalmologicals (97.7%), antivirals for systemic use 
(95.0%), and immunosuppressants (92.2%). The majority of participants (83.5%) received calcineurin 
inhibitors and approximately half of all participants (54.1%) received systemic corticosteroids during 
the treatment phase.    
Numbers analysed   
Efficacy analysis population  
Of the 220 randomized participants, 2 participants did not receive study intervention and were 
excluded from any further analyses. The primary efficacy population was the FAS, defined as all 
randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study intervention. The FAS population 
included all 218 treated participants with no participant excluded from efficacy analyses.  
Safety Analysis Population   
Safety analyses were conducted on the “all participants as treated” (APaT) population, which included 
all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study intervention according to the study 
intervention they received. The APaT population included 218 participants.

Viral resistance  
Next generation sequencing of the CMV terminase complex genes, UL51, UL56, and UL89 was 
performed on plasma samples collected at the CMV infection visit, next scheduled visit, or early 
discontinuation visit, to identify the presence of known LET resistance-associated amino acid variants. 
Among participants with resistance samples collected at a CMV infection visit or an early 
discontinuation visit, 32 (19 in the LET group and 13 in the placebo group) had evaluable LET 
resistance data available. In the LET group 2 (10.5%) participants had previously characterized 
resistance-associated amino acid variants detected in the pUL56 gene: one had a single R369S variant 
detected and another had both F261L and R369S variants detected. No LET resistance-associated 
mutations were observed in the placebo group.   
CMV sequence data was also available from an additional 3 participants (2 in the LET group and 1 in 
the placebo group) who had resistance samples collected at a visit other than a CMV infection visit or 
an early discontinuation visit. Among these 3 participants, 1 in the LET group had a pUL56 E237G 
variant and 1 in the placebo group had 2 variants, pUL56 F261L and R369S, detected.   
In all cases, the LET resistance-associated variants were present at low allele frequencies (≤3%), 
below the validated assay limit of 5%. Therefore, the clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 
No known LET resistance-associated variants were detected in the UL51 or UL89 genes in any 
participant with evaluable sequence data.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study P002  
This was a phase III, randomized, active-controlled, multi-site, double-blind study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of letermovir (LET) compared with valganciclovir (VGCV) administered for 28 weeks 
post-transplant for the prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in adult seropositive 
donor/seronegative recipient (D+/R) kidney transplant recipients. Participants were followed through 
52 weeks post-transplant and 292 participants were treated with LET and 297 participants were 
treated with VGCV. 
To test the primary hypothesis that LET is noninferior to VGCV in the prevention of CMV disease, the 
difference between the two treatment arms in the proportions of participants with adjudicated CMV 
disease through Week 52 post-transplant and the associated two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) 
were calculated using the stratum-adjusted Mantel-Haenszel method with stratification by receipt or no 
receipt of highly cytolytic anti-lymphocyte therapies. LET was concluded to be noninferior to VGCV if 
the upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in proportion of participants with 
adjudicated CMV disease (LET - VGCV) was no higher than 0.10. The primary analysis was stratified 
using the same stratification as the randomisation. This is in accordance with guidelines and is 
endorsed. 
The FAS population were the primary population for efficacy analysis. The FAS population included all 
randomized participants who received at least one dose of study treatment, were D+/R-, and had no 
detectable CMV viral DNA on Day 1. This deviation from the ITT principle is acceptable in this setting. A 
per protocol-based analysis was used as supportive analysis. 
The prespecified analysis used for the primary endpoint was observed failure (OF) approach where 
participants who discontinued prematurely from the study are not counted as failures. A sensitivity 
analysis was performed where participants who discontinued prematurely or had missing outcome 
Week 52 were counted as failures (Non-Completer=Failure). With a relatively low frequency of actual 
failures in both treatment arms and a rather high frequency of missing data, both these methods are 
highly impacted by the amount of missing data. A tipping point analysis exploring the deviation from 
MAR assumption that would be needed for the conclusion to shift and a discussion of the plausibility of 
this deviation would be useful in the interpretation of the results and was therefore requested. 
Furthermore, the MAH was asked to provide baseline characteristics for key prognostic factors for 
subjects with missing and non-missing data respectively for each treatment group. In the answers to 
request for supplementary information the requested analysis and discussion were provided. The 
tipping point analysis and baseline disease and demographic characteristics provided confirms 
robustness of the primary non-inferiority analysis. 
The type I error was controlled with a closed testing procedure which is accepted. 
The primary endpoint CMV disease included CMV end-organ disease and “probable CMV syndrome” 
defined by CMV viremia together with two or more criteria including laboratory measures or clinical 
symptoms to be fulfilled. It is important to note that overall, the definition of CMV syndrome was 
comparable to the definitions used in the valganciclovir and placebo studies from which the non-
inferiority margin was calculated. 
The study was double-blinded, however, given the difference in effect of letermovir and valganciclovir 
on blood cells counts, cytopenia being a common to very common adverse drug reaction of VGCV, it is 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 79/113 
 
  
 
 
likely that the investigators could have become aware of the allocated treatment for some participants. 
Patients in the LET arm in study P002 were treated concomitantly with aciclovir for HSV and VZV 
prophylaxis. While valaciclovir at the dose of 2g X 4 has shown clinically significant anti-CMV effects, 
this is not anticipated from the dose of aciclovir which was selected (400 mg x 2).  
The original protocol (dated 21-Sep-2017) was amended five times. Changes included adding a 240 
mg I.V dose (without CsA), laboratory exclusion criteria, prohibited medication, modification to timing 
of screening and I.V administration details. 
Selection of the NI margin 
To justify the NI margin of 10%, the MAH refers to two key historical studies. These are Humar et al 
2010, and Lowance et al 1999. 
Humar et al describes a multicentre, double-blind, randomized controlled trial which compared the 
efficacy and safety of 200 days versus 100 days’ valganciclovir prophylaxis (900 mg once daily) in 326 
high-risk (D+/R–) kidney allograft recipients. The endpoint was CMV disease, which was similarly 
defined as in the letermovir trial.  
In the trial reported by Humar et al, significantly fewer patients in the 200-day group versus the 100-
day group developed confirmed CMV disease up to month 12 post-transplant (16.1% vs. 36.8%; p < 
0.0001). 
Figure 8: Kaplan-Meier plot of time to cytomegalovirus disease up to month 12 
posttransplant 
This trial would formally support an M1 (as FDA defines it) of 10%, based on the lower 95% CI of the 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 80/113 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
primary efficacy measure.  
There may be concerns that this margin would not be sufficiently conservative given secular trends in 
outcome, potential differences in the studied population, background immunosuppression or endpoint 
ascertainment. However, it is notable that the difference in effect between arms in the Humar trial, is 
despite that patients in both arms were treated with valganciclovir during the first 100 days. 
Based on Lowance et al, one may infer that 10% is a rather conservative margin. While this study was 
performed in the 1990s, it is still of importance as it demonstrates the outcome of a placebo treated 
group with respect to the risk of CMV disease. 
In this study, a total of 208 CMV-negative recipients of a kidney from a seropositive donor and 408 
CMV-positive recipients were randomly assigned to receive either 2 g of valaciclovir or placebo orally 
four times daily for 90 days after transplantation, with the dose adjusted according to renal function. 
The primary end point was laboratory confirmed CMV disease in the first six months after 
transplantation. 
Among the seronegative patients, the incidence of CMV disease 90 days after transplantation was 45 
percent among placebo recipients and 3 percent among valaciclovir recipients. 
It is generally accepted that high dose valaciclovir is not more effective than valganciclovir. 
Consequently, one may conclude that the efficacy of valganciclovir is considerable in the first 100 
days, where patients in both arms of the Humar study received active drugs. Moreover, it is generally 
agreed that aciclovir at the dose given in the letermovir study arm, will not provide relevant anti-CMV 
activity. 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 81/113 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
On this basis, it may be concluded that the 10% NI margin is robustly conservative with respect to 
indirectly establishing the efficacy of letermovir over no treatment, for the prevention of CMV disease 
in seronegative recipients. 
Study P040 
This was a phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel assignment, multicentre, double-blind, 
efficacy and safety study evaluating extending LET prophylaxis to 200 days post-transplant in CMV-
seropositive recipients (R+) of an allogeneic HSCT who had received LET prophylaxis through Week 14 
(~100 days) post-transplant and who were at high risk for CMV infection and/or disease after 
completion of LET prophylaxis through 100 days post-transplant. 
Eligible participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive LET through Week 28 (LET through 200 
days) post-transplant or to receive oral or intravenous placebo once daily through Week 28 (LET 
through 100 days) post-transplant. 
The primary endpoint was clinically significant CMV infection (defined as initiation of pre-emptive 
therapy [PET] for documented CMV viremia and/or CMV end-organ disease) through week 14 to week 
28. 
The FAS population were the primary population for efficacy analysis. The FAS population included all 
randomised participants who received at least one dose of study treatment which is accepted. 
To test the primary hypothesis that LET is superior to placebo in the prevention of clinically significant 
CMV infection when LET prophylaxis is extended from 100 to 200 days post-transplant, the stratum-
adjusted Mantel-Haenszel method (with continuity correction) was used to compare the proportion of 
subjects with clinically significant CMV infection from Week 14 (~100 days) post-transplant through 
Week 28 (~200 days) post-transplant between the two treatment groups. The primary analysis was 
stratified by haploidentical donor (yes/no) but not for study centre. This is accepted. Cochran Mantel-
Haenszel weights were used to calculate the overall between-group differences across strata. LET was 
concluded superior to placebo if 1-sided p-value is less than or equal to 0.0249. The statistical 
methods and handling of missing data were similar as for the P002 study. The prespecified analysis 
used for the primary endpoint was observed failure approach and a supportive analysis using the Non-
Completer=Failure approach was performed at week 28. 
The DMC were provided with unblinded descriptive summaries of the efficacy data. Although no formal 
efficacy analyses were provided, a small amount of alpha (α = 0.0001) was allocated for each of these 
looks. This is accepted. 
No method for controlling type I error for secondary endpoints has been specified.  
In general, the baseline characteristics were similar between the treatment groups. The proportion of 
participants with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at study entry was higher in the LET group 
compared with the placebo group. One recipient in the letermovir arm was CMV seronegative at 
baseline. To be eligible for entering the study participants should have documented positive CMV 
serostatus (CMV IgG seropositive) for recipient (R+) at the time of transplant. Thus, the patient should 
not have been included in the study, however, 1/144 patients is negligible given the overall outcome. 
The original protocol (dated 03-DEC-2018) was amended twice to limit enrolment of patient who have 
anti-thymocyte globulin and implement changes related to I.V administration. 
It is notable that for the original registrational study P001, the MAH used a conservative NC=F 
approach to impute outcomes in cases with missing data. For the P002 and P040 studies, the MAH 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 82/113 
 
  
 
 
prespecified an Observed Failure (OF) approach. While it is understood that a non-inferiority study 
requires different assumptions than a superiority study with respect to what imputations are 
conservative, the P040 study is a superiority study. 
The MAH states that the OF approach was selected partially based on the anticipation that the CMV 
disease rates would be low and thus the NC=F approach would have overestimated the failure rate and 
been overly conservative obscuring the true treatment effect. This argument is accepted. Moreover, 
the sensitivity analyses with NC=F approach for both studies are demonstrating similar results as the 
analyses of the primary endpoints. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study P002 
In the phase 3 study P002, LET was demonstrated to be non-inferior to VGCV for the prevention of 
CMV disease in kidney transplant patients through Week 52 post-transplant; 10.4% vs. 11.8% failures 
were observed in the LET and VGCV groups respectively (treatment difference -1.4 (95% CI: -6.5, 
3.8]). 
In the primary analysis missing data was imputed as not considered failures (observed failure 
approach). A sensitivity analysis with a failure imputation was also performed (non-completer=failure). 
With a relatively low frequency of actual failures in both treatment arms and a rather high frequency of 
missing data, both these methods are highly impacted by the amount of missing data. A tipping point 
analysis exploring the deviation from MAR assumption that would be needed for the conclusion to shift 
and baseline disease and demographic characteristics provided confirms robustness of the primary 
non-inferiority analysis.  
There is a numerical imbalance between treatment groups in study P002 in the number of patients 
with end-organ disease, 6 versus 1 patient in the LET and VGCV groups, respectively. Five of the cases 
in the LET group are CMV end-organ GI disease, of which 4 proven and 1 probable CMV end-organ GI 
disease. All participants from the LET group experiencing CMV end-organ disease completed more or 
less the intended duration of treatment (200 days). In almost all cases of CMV end-organ GI disease 
the onset of symptoms started approximately 1-2 months after completing study intervention (one 
participant had symptoms approx. 4 months after completing LET). The primary reason for transplant, 
gender and age varied and no obvious pattern can be discerned. All participants recovered with 
treatment with either oral valganciclovir and/or iv ganciclovir. 
It was noted during the assessment of the pivotal trial P001 in HSCT patients that, despite an on-
treatment imbalance between groups in favour of LET, there was an apparent catch-up in cases of CMV 
end-organ disease in the letermovir group after prophylaxis was discontinued, with 1 patient at week 
14 (end of treatment) and additionally 5 patients at week 24, all of whom had GI disease. No risk 
factors for CMV EOD could be identified from the baseline characteristics, medical history, or 
concomitant medications for these patients. 
The MAH claims that the difference in GI EOD between the treatment arms in P002 is predominantly 
due to lack of confirmatory endoscopy/tissue-invasive biopsy (required for adjudication confirmed GI 
EOD) in the majority of investigator reported GI EOD. None (0/16) were performed/documented in the 
VGCV arm and 5/25 in the LET arm. No risk factors that would increase the likelihood for CMV EOD in 
these patients have been identified. Baseline characteristics, medical history and concomitant 
medications were in general comparable with the overall population. All participants with CMV EOD in 
the LET arm took LET 480 mg daily and did not receive CsA. 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 83/113 
 
  
 
 
The MAH has not provided a satisfactory explanation for the observed imbalance in GI EOD and claims 
it to be a random finding due to a difference in performed procedures between participants. Moreover, 
the analysis of the primary endpoint in investigator-reported CMV disease through Week 52 post-
transplant also adds support to the efficacy of letermovir.  
In summary, this is a likely random finding. Moreover, given the natural history of CMV post-
transplant, as well as the nature of the findings, there remains no doubt that letermovir is an effective 
and useful agent in the proposed treatment niche.  
As mentioned above the primary endpoint CMV disease included CMV end-organ disease and “probable 
CMV syndrome”. Leukopenia or neutropenia (criteria 3) or thrombocytopenia (criteria 5) are among 
the listed criteria which may be counted to fulfil the definition of CMV syndrome. Leukopenia, 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are very common (≥1/10) or common (≥1/100 to <1/10) adverse 
drug reactions associated with VGCV. Thus, it was questioned whether the number of cases of CMV 
syndrome in the VGCV arm in study P002 was inflated by the occurrence of cytopenia secondary to 
VGCV, which would impact the primary efficacy analysis in favour of LET. The prophylaxis treatment 
period was 28 weeks and the primary efficacy endpoint was assessed at 52 weeks, after a period of 
off-treatment follow-up. The half-life of VGCV is short (approximately 4 hours) and drug-induced 
cytopenia is expected to resolve within around a week of stopping. The majority of the CMV syndrome 
events (24/24 LET and 29/34 VGCV) occurred after cessation of prophylaxis. Most cases of CMV 
syndrome in the VGCV arm that were confirmed on the basis of criteria 3 or 5 being fulfilled were most 
likely due to actual CMV syndrome and not an adverse drug reaction associated with VGCV. 
The time to onset of CMV disease was comparable between the LET and VGCV groups through Week 
52 post-transplant. As mentioned above the majority of CMV disease cases occurred after cessation of 
treatment. The proportion of CMV disease at 28 weeks post-transplant was 0 vs. 5 participants in the 
LET and VGCV arms respectively using the OF approach.  
It is noted that the proportion of participants with quantifiable CMV DNAemia was lower in the LET 
group compared to the VGCV group through week 28 and slightly lower also through week 52 post-
transplant supporting the efficacy of LET as prophylaxis in this study. 
The incidence of CMV disease by intervention group through Week 52 post-transplant was overall 
comparable across the subgroups of sex, age, race, region and induction therapy.  
Viral resistance  
Viral resistance testing was performed on samples obtained from participants prior to initiation of CMV 
treatment or who had suspected or confirmed CMV disease. There were no LET resistance-associated 
substitutions at a frequency of ≥ 5% in the LET-treated participants with CMV disease or early 
discontinuation with viremia (n=52). The potential contribution of co-administration of aciclovir with 
LET in terms of (cross-) resistance to VGCV is not considered likely. The dose of aciclovir used is below 
the EC50 necessary to treat CMV and would not be expected to exert any selective pressure on the 
virus to induce potential escape mutants. Moreover, LET was effective in suppressing CMV replication 
during the prophylaxis period, making the possibility of resistance selection to aciclovir, and possible 
cross-resistance with VGCV, highly unlikely. Thus, the combination of LET + aciclovir is not likely to 
compromise the patient’s possibilities for receiving adequate treatment in the event of prophylaxis 
failure. 
Study P040 
The primary efficacy endpoint of proportion of participants with clinically significant CMV infection from 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 84/113 
 
  
 
 
Week 14 (~100 days) through Week 28 (~200 days) post-transplant (OF approach) was significant 
with 4/144 (2.8%) vs 14/74 (18.9%) in the LET and placebo groups respectively (difference -16.1 
[95% CI; -25.8,-6.5], p-value =0.0005). 
In the supportive analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint using NC=F approach 14.6% vs. 24.3% 
CMV infections at week 28 was observed in the LET and placebo groups, respectively (nominal p-
value=0.0505). A total of 16 participants were categorised as “Discontinued from study before Week 
28” post-transplant in the LET arm and one in the placebo group. There were no overall trends in the 
reasons for study discontinuations. In the LET arm, the most common reason for discontinuation was 
“Withdrawal by Subject” (n=11). Within this category, 4 discontinuations were due to 
transportation/unable to go to hospital including one also for health issues. Seven discontinuations 
were due to the participants’ desire to not continue participation in the study whereof one was 
reported due to nausea related to study treatment. Additional reasons for early discontinuation in the 
LET arm included death (n=1), loss to follow-up (n=1), due to physician decision (n=1), COVID-19 
(n=1) or multiple reasons including CMV reactivation and compliance (n=1). It would be expected that 
these listed reasons for discontinuation would be more or less evenly distributed between the 
treatment arms, which is not the case. However, with the available data it is not possible to determine 
if the discontinuations are an effect of letermovir treatment. 
Time to onset of clinically significant CMV infection was longer in the LET group and the proportion of 
participants with PET was lower in the LET group compared to placebo through 28 weeks post-
transplant. The results support the effect of letermovir prophylaxis in HSCT for ~200 days. 
Proportions of participants with all-cause mortality was a secondary endpoint and was comparable in 
the treatment groups. From week 14 (~100 days) through week 28 post-transplant there were 2.1% 
vs. 1.4% in the LET and placebo groups respectively. From week 14 through week 48 post-transplant 
proportions of participants were 8.3% vs. 8.1% in the LET and placebo groups respectively.    
The treatment difference in the incidence of clinically significant CMV infection by treatment group 
through Week 28 post-transplant across subgroups including age, sex, donor type and 
immunosuppressive regimen were overall consistent with the outcome of the primary endpoint. 
Viral resistance 
Overall, 4 participants in the LET group and 1 in the placebo group had detectable resistance-
associated amino acid variants (pUL56 gene). In all cases, the LET resistance-associated variants were 
present at low allele frequencies (≤3%), below the validated assay limit of 5%. Therefore, the clinical 
significance of these findings is unknown. No known LET resistance-associated variants were detected 
in the UL51 or UL89 genes in any participant with evaluable sequence data. The SmPC has been 
updated to include information that no letermovir resistance-associated substitutions were detected 
above the validated assay limit. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The use of letermovir prophylaxis until 28 weeks post-kidney transplant is effective in preventing CMV 
disease through 52 weeks post-transplant in seronegative patients receiving kidneys from seropositive 
donors. This was demonstrated by the non-inferiority of letermovir to the standard of care 
valganciclovir.  
The use of letermovir prophylaxis until 28 weeks post hematopoietic stem cell transplant is effective in 
postponing CMV reactivation in CMV seropositive patients.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In support of this application, the MAH presented safety data from the following clinical studies: 
Table 35: Summary of clinical studies with LET providing safety information 
The populations used for the analysis of safety data are APaT population (all randomised participants 
who received at least one dose of study intervention). Further details of the study designs are 
summarised above under 2.4.2. Main studies.  
Power for safety analysis 
In Study P002, a power calculation to show the percentage point difference between the treatment 
arms that could be detected with a 90% probability, given 300 participants in each arm, was geared 
towards the expectation of superiority of LET over VGCV in terms of the rate of leukopenia AEs. No 
calculation is provided to show the minimal degree of true inferiority of LET with respect to a given AE 
rate that can be detected with a reasonable probability in the same study. 
In Study P040, if the underlying incidence of a particular AE is 1% (1 of every 100 participants 
receiving the drug), there is a 52% chance of observing at least one of that particular AE among 72 
participants in the placebo (100-day) arm or a 76% chance of observing at least one of that particular 
AE among 144 participants in the LET (200-day) arm. If no AE of that particular type are observed 
among the 144 participants in the LET (200-day) arm, this study will provide 95% confidence that the 
underlying percentage of participants with that particular AE is <2.5% (one in every 40 participants).

2.5.1.1.  Study P002 – post-kidney transplant 
Patient exposure 
A total of 292 participants received at least one dose of LET by any route in study P002. The currently 
authorised dose of oral LET 480 mg once daily (240 mg when administered with cyclosporin A (CsA)) 
was administered to 152 participants for >24 to <28 weeks and 98 participants for >28 weeks. The 
mean duration of exposure to LET (any route of exposure) was longer compared with VGCV (175.6 
days vs. 160.7 days). 
An amendment was made to study protocol to allow 1:1 randomisation to LET IV 480mg or 240 mg 
when administered intravenously without CsA. The rationale for this was that popPK simulations using 
data from the Phase 3 trial in HSCT recipients suggest that a 240 mg IV dose (without CsA) will 
provide exposures comparable to exposures obtained following administration of a 480 mg PO dose 
(without CsA).  
LET was administered with concomitant ACV for the duration of study treatment. The mean duration of 
exposure to concomitant ACV was comparable to the duration of exposure to oral LET.  
Measurements of Study Intervention Compliance 
The proportion of participants with compliance <90% was lower in the LET group (<2%) compared 
with the VGCV group (>20%). 
Adverse events 
Overall adverse events 
Collection of AEs continued through the treatment phase and 14 days after completion of study 
intervention. After the treatment phase, only SAEs related to study intervention or resulting in death 
were collected through week 52 post-transplant.  
The overall rate of AEs in each treatment group through 28 weeks post-transplant was generally 
comparable, with the exception of drug-related AEs (-15.2% (95% CI -22.2, -8.0)) and discontinuation 
of study intervention due to AEs (-9,4% (95%CI -14.1, -4.9)), including drug-related AEs (-6.0% 
(95% CI -10.1, -2.4)), which were all lower in the LET group compared with the VGCV group. These 
differences were primarily due to fewer participants in the LET group with drug-related leukopenia and 
neutropenia (leukopenia; 11.3% vs 37.0%; neutropenia 2.7% vs 16.5%) through Week 28 post-
transplant. There were no notable changes through Week 52 post-transplant for leukopenia or 
neutropenia.  
Common adverse events 
The most commonly reported AEs (incidence >10%) for LET were diarrhoea (31.5%), tremor (18.2%), 
urinary tract infection (14.0%), peripheral oedema (13.4%), hypomagnesemia (12.7%), leukopenia 
(11.3%), hypertension (11.3%), hypophosphatemia (10.3%) and blood creatinine increased (10.3%).

Table 36: Participants With Adverse Events (P002) (Incidence ≥ 10% in One or More 
Treatment Groups) Treatment Phase (All Participants as Treated) 
Drug-related adverse events 
The proportion of participants with AEs deemed drug-related by the investigator was lower in the LET 
group (19.9%) compared with the VGCV group (35.0%), primarily due to fewer participants with drug-
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 88/113 
 
  
 
 
 
related leukopenia (6.8% vs 22.9%) or neutropenia (2.1% vs 8.1%). Apart from leukopenia and (to a 
lesser degree) neutropenia, drug-related adverse events were reported at similar rates in both study 
arms. 
Serious adverse events and Deaths  
Serious adverse events  
The proportion of participants with SAEs through Week 28 post-transplant was generally comparable 
between the LET group (36.3%) and the VGCV group (38.0%).  
The most frequently reported SAEs (incidence >2%) in the LET group were pyrexia, urinary tract 
infection, blood creatinine increased, acute kidney injury, and lymphocele.  
The most frequently reported SAEs (incidence >2%) in the VGCV group were leukopenia, diarrhoea, 
transplant rejection, cytomegalovirus infection, urinary tract infection, and acute kidney injury. 
Apart from the SOC Blood and lymphatic disorders, drug-related serious adverse events were 
infrequent and reported at similar rates in both study arms. 
Table 37: Participants With Drug-Related Serious Adverse Events (P002) (Incidence > 0% 
in One or More Treatment Groups) Treatment Phase (All Participants as Treated) 
Deaths 
A total of 5 deaths due to an AE were reported through Week 52 post-transplant. Three deaths in the 
LET group were due to bacterial sepsis, septic shock, and pulmonary embolism. Two deaths in the 
VGCV group were due to cardio-respiratory arrest and respiratory failure.  
One additional death due to COVID-19 in the VGCV group (not reported as an AE) was reported 
through Week 52 post-transplant. In addition, 2 deaths (post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 89/113 
 
  
 
 
 
and cardio-respiratory arrest) were reported after the last study visit in the LET group. None of the 
deaths were considered by the investigators to be related to study intervention. 
Laboratory findings 
Myelotoxicity 
AEs of leukopenia, total WBC count <3500 cells/μL, AE of neutropenia, ANC <1000 cells/μL through 
Week 28 post-transplant were lower in the LET group compared with the VGCV group (-37.9% (95%CI 
-45.1, -30.3)). 
The proportions of participants with Grade 3 or Grade 4 decreases from baseline in leukocytes (2.7% 
vs 6.6%) or neutrophils (2.1% vs 7.9%) were lower in the LET group compared with the VGCV group 
respectively. The proportion of participants administered GCSF through Week 28 post-transplant was 
lower in the LET group (1.7%) compared with the VGCV group (7.1%). 
Table 38: Analysis of Participants With Leukopenia or Neutropenia (by Adverse Event 
Preferred Term or Laboratory Criteria) (P002) Treatment Phase (All Participants as Treated)
Other laboratory findings and vital signs measurements 
No meaningful differences or trends in laboratory values over time were observed through Week 28 
post-transplant between the LET group and VGCV group, except for leukopenia and neutropenia. No 
participants had laboratory values that met the predefined criteria for potential DILI.  
There were no clinically meaningful findings in vital signs measurements, ECG parameters, or physical 
examination assessments for either treatment group. 
Additional safety findings 
Discontinuation due to adverse events  
Fewer participants in the LET group (4.1%) discontinued study intervention due to an AE compared 
with the VGCV group (13.5%). Leukopenia (LET [1.0%] vs. VGCV [5.4%]) and neutropenia (LET 
[1.4%] vs. VGCV [1.7%]) were the most frequently reported AE leading to study intervention 
discontinuation in either group. All other adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred at a rate 
of <1% and mainly as isolated cases.  
New-onset diabetes 
The proportions of participants with confirmed new onset of diabetes mellitus after transplant through 
Week 28 (5.9% vs 6.1%) and Week 52 (6.2% vs 6.7%) post-transplant were comparable between the 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023

LET group and the VGCV group.     
Renal Graft Rejection, Renal Graft Loss, and Changes in Renal Function 
Renal graft rejection, renal graft loss, and changes in renal function are summarised below, and were 
comparable between the LET group and the VGCV group.

Cardiac events 
In study P001, assessed as part of the initial MAA in HSCT, the incidence of Cardiac disorders SOC AEs 
was higher in participants receiving LET (12.6%) compared with participant receiving placebo (6.3%). 
Based on the totality of the preclinical and clinical data, it was concluded at that time that there was no 
evidence for a causal association between the administration of LET and Cardiac disorders SOC AEs.  
AEs belonging to the SOC Cardiac Disorders were reported at a frequency comparable with the VGCV 
arm (AEs: 11.3% vs 15.8%; SAEs: 2.7% vs 3.0%) and also with the previous findings of study P001. 
Of 33 reported AEs in the LET group, the majority relates to tachyarrhythmias and symptoms thereof, 
which is similar to the findings in study P001. Apart from this, no patterns can be observed. Most 
cardiac AEs were mild to moderate in intensity and comparable for both groups. Drug-related cardiac 
AEs and SAEs were infrequent. None of the cardiac AEs led to discontinuation of study intervention. 
ECG parameters were comparable between the LET and VGCV groups.   
Table 41: Participants with AEs within Cardiac disorders SOC (Incidence >0% in One of 
More Treatment Groups) Treatment Phase (All Participants as Treated)  
Other 
Rates of re-hospitalizations were lower in the LET group compared with the VGCV group through Week 
28 (34.6% vs 40.7%) and Week 52 (43.9% vs 50.8%) post-transplant.  
The proportions of participants with select opportunistic infections were comparable between the LET 
group and the VGCV group through Week 28 (10.4% vs 12.1%) and Week 52 (16.3% vs 17.2%) post-
transplant.  
The incidence of AEs (reported in ≥2% of the LET group with a risk difference ≥1.4 compared with the 
VGCV group) by LET exposure (AUC) quartiles were reported. There was no apparent trend of an 
increase in the incidence of AEs over the range of exposures assessed using LET AUC quartiles.

LET treatment had no observed impact on sex hormone levels (LH, FSH, testosterone, and inhibin b) in 
male kidney transplant recipients.  
2.5.1.2.  Study P040 – post-allogenic HSCT 
Patient exposure 
A total of 144 participants received at least one dose of LET by any route in study P040. The currently 
authorised dose of oral LET 480 mg once daily (240 mg when administered with cyclosporin A (CsA)) 
was administered to 68 participants for >12 to 14 weeks and 54 participants for >14 weeks. The mean 
duration of exposure to LET (any route of exposure) was generally comparable with placebo (88.2 vs. 
83.4 days). 
All participants received 100 days of LET post-transplant prior to entering the study. Thereafter, they 
either received an additional 100 days of LET (200 days LET) or 100 days of PBO (100 days LET), 
meaning that the actual total duration of exposure to LET in the LET arm was 68 participants for >26 
to 28 weeks and 54 participants for >28 weeks, mean duration of exposure to LET (any route of 
exposure) 188.2 days. As AEs were not collected prior to start of the treatment phase (100 days), the 
initial LET phase unfortunately does not contribute directly to the safety database. 
Measurements of Study Intervention Compliance  
All but 5 participants had ≥90% compliance rate which was comparable between the LET and placebo 
groups. The 5 participants had a compliance rate of ≥75% to <90%. 
Adverse events 
Overall adverse events 
Collection of AEs continued through the treatment phase and through 14 days after completion of 
study intervention. After the treatment phase, only SAEs related to study intervention or resulting in 
death were collected through week 48 post-transplant.  
The overall rate of AEs, drug-related AEs, SAEs and discontinuations due to AEs in each treatment 
group were generally comparable. 
Common adverse events 
Most common adverse events through week 28 post-transplant were reported at similar rates in both 
study arms and were consistent with the known safety profile in HSCT patients established in study 
P001, as well as signs and symptoms of the underlying clinical condition. 
The most commonly reported AEs (incidence >10%) for LET were GVHD (29.9%), diarrhoea (11.8%) 
and nausea (11.1%).

Drug related adverse events  
The proportion of participants with drug-related AEs was numerically lower in the LET group (2.8%) 
compared with the placebo group (4.1%). 
Serious adverse events, Adverse events of special interest and Deaths 
Serious adverse events   
Overall, the proportion of participants with SAEs reported during the Treatment Phase were generally 
comparable between treatment groups (30.6% in the LET group and 33.8% in the placebo group). The 
most frequently reported SAEs in either treatment group (LET vs placebo) were GVHD (2.8% vs 
8.1%), acute myeloid leukaemia recurrent (4.2% vs 0.0%), and pneumonia (2.1% vs 2.7%). No SAEs 
were considered to be drug-related by the investigator.    
Deaths  
A total of 14 deaths were reported during the Treatment Phase, 11 (7.6%) in the LET group and 3 
(4.1%) in the placebo group. Eight (7 in the LET group and 1 in the placebo group) of the 14 deaths 
were due to recurrence of the participant’s underlying medical condition that necessitated the HSCT 
(relapse mortality). Non-relapse mortality was comparable between the 2 groups. None of the deaths 
were considered to be drug-related by the investigator.  
Events of Special Interest  
Cardiotoxicity  
In P040, the frequency of AEs in the Cardiac disorder SOC was comparable between the LET (4.2%) 
and the placebo groups (4.1%). Most were mild to moderate in intensity. None of the AEs were 
reported as being drug-related, led to discontinuation of study intervention, or resulted in death.   
Hepatotoxicity   
The frequency of AEs reported for the Hepatobiliary disorders SOC was lower in the LET group (2.1%) 
compared with placebo (4.1%). All were mild to moderated in intensity and none of AEs were reported 
as being related to study intervention or led to discontinuation of study intervention. The patterns of 
change in liver function test values were comparable between the 2 treatment groups and there was 
no report of laboratory values that met the protocol-defined ECI criteria for a potential DILI.

Laboratory findings 
Myelotoxicity  
In this study, the reported incidence of AE terms in the Blood and lymphatic system disorders SOC 
(LET vs placebo: 14.6% vs 13.5%) were comparable in the 2 treatment groups and lower than the 
rates reported in study P001 (approximately 26%). Most of these AEs were mild to moderate in 
intensity and none were reported as being related to study intervention. Reporting rates for individual 
AEs are comparable with those seen in study P001.  
Table 43: Participants With Adverse Events in the Blood and lymphatic system disorders SOC 
(Incidence > 0% in One or More Treatment Groups) Treatment Phase (All Participants as 
Treated)  
Creatinine   
Overall, the central laboratory findings that met predetermined criteria for worsening grade were 
comparable between treatment groups except for serum creatinine levels, where a numerical 
imbalance favouring the placebo group was observed for all grades. Most of the worsening grades for 
creatinine were Grade 1 and 2 abnormalities in both treatment groups. Five participants had Grade 3 
and Grade 4 abnormalities; all were in the LET group. Potential causes of increased serum creatinine in 
these participants include medical history condition that could lead to renal impairment as well as 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023

concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs. Changes from baseline mean creatinine values over time were, 
however, similar between treatment groups. It is noted that in the registration study P001, changes to 
serum creatinine of all grades were reported in both arms, at rates comparable between LET and PBO 
but generally higher than seen in study P040 (reproduced below).

Additional safety findings 
Discontinuation of study intervention due to adverse events  
There was a numerical imbalance in the rate of study intervention discontinuation due to AE between 
LET and PBO arms. Six of the seven AEs leading to discontinuation of the study intervention in the LET 
group were SAEs. All occurred as isolated cases and no pattern is evident from the data. In the 
placebo group, 1 participant discontinued study intervention due to GVHD. None of the 
discontinuations were considered to be drug-related by the investigator.     
Table 46: Participants With Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation From Drug 
(Incidence > 0% in One or More Treatment Groups) Treatment Phase (All Participants as 
Treated)
Graft versus host disease 
The proportion of participants experiencing GVHD was comparable in the LET group and the placebo 
group through Week 28 post-transplant (29.2% (21.9, 37,3) versus 32.4% (22.0, 44.3)) and through 
Week 48 post-transplant (38.9% (30.9, 47.4) versus 41.9% (30.5, 53.9)) In both groups, skin was the 
most frequently reported site for new onset of both acute and chronic GVHD, followed by 
gastrointestinal tract, at both timepoints. These rates are numerically lower than those seen in both 
LET and placebo arms through Week 14 and Week 24 in study P001.

2.5.1.3.  Safety in sub-populations 
In both studies included in the current application, AE profiles by age, sex, race, and ethnicity were 
evaluated. The safety profile of LET in P002 was generally comparable across subgroups analysed for 
age, sex, race, and ethnicity. The safety profile of LET in P040 was generally comparable across 
subgroups analysed for age and sex. Interpretation of the results for race and ethnicity subgroup 
analyses were limited, as the majority of participants were White and not Hispanic or Latino. 
2.5.1.4.  Post marketing experience 
As of 01-NOV-2022, LET has been registered and approved in 65 countries since it was first approved 
in Canada (01-NOV-2017). LET is formulated as 240 mg and 480 mg tablets and as a concentrate for 
solution for infusion (240 mg/12 mL and 480 mg/24 mL). There are no records of any registration 
being revoked or withdrawn for safety reasons. The benefit-risk information on LET has been 
summarized in the PSUR submitted on a 3-year cycle to the EMA (and on a 6-month cycle to some 
regions). Patient exposure estimates were calculated from the MAH’s internal distribution data from 
the WFRS and the Financial Sharing Area database. Total cumulative patient exposure from first 
licensure (01-NOV-2017) through 01-NOV-2022 was approximately 22,073 patient-years of treatment 
(11,080 for 240 mg tablets, 10,124 for 480 mg tablets, 603 for 240 mg vial, and 267 for 480 mg vial).  
Cumulative post marketing data through 01-NOV-2022 (date of the most recent PSUR) are 
summarized below. As of 01-NOV-2022, there were 2,818 AE reports containing 7,278 events (3,903 
non-serious, 3,375 serious) from spontaneous and non-interventional post marketing study reports in 
the MAH’s global safety database. The distribution of the AEs by SOC is provided in the table below. 
The most frequently reported SOCs were Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (1,156 
reports), General disorders and administration site conditions (1,100 reports), and Immune system 
disorders (695 reports). The most common PTs in Injury, poisoning and procedural complications SOC 
were Off label use (332 reports), Product dose omission issue (323 reports), and Product use issue 
(217 reports). The most common PTs in General disorders and administration site conditions SOC were 
No adverse event (306 reports), Adverse event (236 reports), and Death (166 reports). The majority 
of death cases were related to progression of underlying medical conditions. The most common PTs in 
Immune system disorders SOC were Acute graft versus host disease in skin (370 reports), Acute graft 
versus host disease in intestine (191 reports), and Chronic graft versus host disease (140 reports). A 
cumulative analysis of post marketing data as of 01-NOV-2022 did not identify new safety issues for 
LET.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of Prevymis in HSCT patients was previously established based on data from a pivotal Phase 
3 study (P001) of up to 14 weeks’ LET in 373 HSCT recipients, which was submitted to support the 
initial marketing authorisation for the indication of prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation 
and disease in adult CMV-seropositive recipients [R+] of an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell 
transplant (HSCT) (EMEA/H/C/004536).  
In support of the current application, the MAH presented safety data from two completed clinical 
studies and additionally a summary of available post-marketing data, which build on the existing safety 
database. The challenging underlying conditions of these patients as well as the transplantation need 
to be taken into account, and thus the assessment of AEs from the intervention against such a 
background is a challenge. 
Study P002 was a randomized, active-controlled, multi-site, double-blind study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of letermovir (LET) compared with valganciclovir (VGCV) administered for 200 days 
post-transplant for the prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in adult seropositive 
donor/seronegative recipient (D+/R) kidney transplant recipients. The currently authorised dose of oral 
LET 480 mg once daily (240 mg when administered with cyclosporin A (CsA)) was administered to 152 
participants for >24 to <28 weeks and 98 participants for >28 weeks.  
The overall rate of AEs through 28 weeks post-transplant was generally comparable between LET and 
VGCV, with the exception of drug-related AEs and discontinuation of study intervention due to AEs, 
which were lower in the LET group compared with the VGCV group. These differences were primarily 
due to fewer participants in the LET group with leukopenia and neutropenia, which are known adverse 
effects of VGCV. A total of 5 deaths (LET 3, VGCV 2) due to an AE were reported through Week 52 
post-transplant. One additional death due to COVID-19 in the VGCV group (not reported as an AE) was 
reported through Week 52 post-transplant. In addition, 2 deaths were reported after the last study 
visit in the LET group. None of the deaths appear to be related to study intervention. There were 
comparable rates between the LET group and the VGCV group of renal graft rejection through Week 28 
(5.9% (3.5, 9.3) versus 6.1% (3.6, 9.4)) and through Week 52 (8.0% (5.1, 11.7) versus 6.7% (4.2, 
10.2)). 
LET exposure and bioavailability following oral administration in kidney transplant patients appears to 
be higher than in HSCT patients, but despite this the adverse event profile for LET was generally 
similar to that seen previously in study P001, with the exception of the rate of leukopenia in study 
P002, which can reasonably be attributed to the nearly 100% rate of concomitant use of 
mycophenolate in study P002. Myelosuppression is common (≥1/100) in kidney transplant recipients 
administered mycophenolate and the rates of leukopenia and neutropenia in the LET arm in study P002 
are not over and above what would be expected with mycophenolate alone. Therefore, neither 
leukopenia nor neutropenia will be added to section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
The proportion of participants with leukopenia or neutropenia through Week 28 post-transplant was 
lower in the LET group compared with the VGCV group. This was a pre-specified but not type-1 error-
controlled safety analysis, thus the finding will not be included in the SmPC section 5.1. However, the 
safety data clearly demonstrate a difference in safety profile for letermovir versus valganciclovir in 
terms of the rates of leukopenia reported as adverse events in each treatment arm, which represents a 
clinically relevant advantage of letermovir over alternative. Nevertheless, and in accordance with the 
SmPC guideline, the CHMP did not support the inclusion of comparative rates of leukopenia in each 
treatment arm in the text summary for section 4.8 of the SmPC.

In study P001, assessed as part of the initial MAA in HSCT, the incidence of Cardiac disorders SOC AEs 
was higher in participants receiving LET (12.6%) compared with participant receiving placebo (6.3%). 
Based on the totality of the preclinical and clinical data, it was concluded at that time that there was no 
evidence for a causal association between the administration of LET and Cardiac disorders SOC AEs. In 
study P002, AEs belonging to the SOC Cardiac Disorders were reported at a frequency comparable with 
the VGCV arm (AEs: 11.3% vs 15.8%; SAEs: 2.7% vs 3.0%) and also with the previous findings of 
study P001. Of 33 reported AEs in the LET group, the majority relates to tachyarrhythmias and 
symptoms thereof, which is similar to the findings in study P001. The data from study P002 relating to 
cardiac disorders is thus considered reassuring against the background conclusions from earlier 
assessment that there was no evidence for a causal association. 
Study P040 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel assignment, multicentre, double-blind, 
efficacy and safety study evaluating extending LET prophylaxis to 200 days post-transplant in CMV-
seropositive recipients (R+) of an allogeneic HSCT who had received LET prophylaxis through Week 14 
(~100 days) post-transplant and who were at high risk for CMV infection and/or disease after 
completion of LET prophylaxis through 100 days post-transplant. The currently authorised dose of oral 
LET 480 mg once daily (240 mg when administered with cyclosporin A (CsA)) was administered to 68 
participants for >12 to 14 weeks and 54 participants for >14 weeks. 
Most common AEs through week 28 post-transplant were reported at similar rates in both study arms 
and were consistent with the known safety profile in HSCT patients up to 100 days as established in 
study P001, as well as signs and symptoms of the underlying clinical condition. A total of 14 deaths 
were reported during the Treatment Phase, 11 (7.6%) in the LET group and 3 (4.1%) in the placebo 
group. Eight (7 in the LET group and 1 in the placebo group) of the 14 deaths were due to recurrence 
of the participant’s underlying medical condition that necessitated the HSCT (relapse mortality). Non-
relapse mortality was comparable between the 2 groups. None of the deaths appear to be directly 
related to study intervention. The rate of GVHD was comparable in the LET group and the placebo 
group both through Week 28 post-transplant (29.2% (21.9, 37,3) versus 32.4% (22.0, 44.3)) and 
through Week 48 post-transplant (38.9% (30.9, 47.4) versus 41.9% (30.5, 53.9)). These rates are 
numerically lower than those seen in both LET and placebo arms through Week 14 and Week 24 in 
study P001. 
A numerical imbalance in the percentage of patients experiencing AEs in the SOC neoplasms was 
observed between LET 200 days arm (14.6%) versus LET 100 days (placebo) arm (9.5%). This 
imbalance was partially driven by a higher number of patients who had recurrent acute myeloid 
leukaemia [9 patients (6.3%) in the LET 200 days arm vs 1 patient (1.4%) in the LET 100 days 
(placebo) arm]. There appears to be no relationship with duration of treatment with LET. Inspection of 
Kaplan-Meier plots of time to onset of these events for both arms in both HSCT studies (P040 and 
P001) did not reveal any recurrent pattern, as no such difference was seen in the P001. The recurrence 
of AML is not unusual in this population and the observed difference in the P040 study may reflect a 
random imbalance in a relatively small study. 
Adverse events in the Eye disorders SOC were reported more frequently in the LET arm than placebo 
arm (5.6 vs 1.4%), but much less frequently than seen in either arm in study P001 (16.6 and 16.7%, 
respectively). The difference is at least partially due to a number of cases of dry eye (4), of which 3 
were reported as mild and one as moderate. Review of the cases reveals no pattern and provides no 
compelling grounds to suspect a causal relationship to LET for any reported PT in the Eye disorders 
SOC.

In practice, very few participants in either study received IV LET, and those that did continued only for 
a few days before switching to oral LET, not enabling a meaningful separate analysis of the safety 
profile for IV administration, including the lower IV dose of 240mg that was added in a protocol 
amendment to study P002.

4.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this group of variations, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC 
have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
4.1.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: the 
changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do not require user consultation with target patient 
groups. 
5.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
5.1.  Introduction 
Prevymis (letermovir) is an inhibitor of the viral DNA terminase complex, which plays a key role in 
cleavage and packaging of viral progeny DNA. The positive B/R of 100 days of letermovir prophylaxis 
post HSCT has previously been accepted by CHMP. 
The data provided in this application are intended to support an indication for prophylaxis of CMV 
disease in CMV-seronegative adults who have received a kidney transplant from a CMV-seropositive 
donor [D+/R-]. The MAH is also seeking a modification of the current approved posology to extend 
prophylaxis beyond 100 days post-HSCT. This may be of benefit in some patients at high risk for late 
CMV reactivation. The safety and efficacy of letermovir use for more than 200 days has not been 
studied in clinical trials. 
Prevymis was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication: Prevention of 
cytomegalovirus disease in patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity deemed at risk. In the 
context of the present extension of indication, the MAH wishes to maintain the orphan status of the 
product. The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products on the 12 October 2023 was of the view that 
the scope of this procedure does not raise justified and serious doubts in respect to the fulfilment of 
the orphan designation criteria. 
5.2.  Therapeutic Context 
5.2.1.  Disease or condition 
Cytomegalovirus is ubiquitous and generally acquired early in life, with the majority of the adult 
population being CMV-seropositive in most countries worldwide. Kidney transplant recipients and 
allogeneic HSCT recipients are immune-compromised, which increases the risk for CMV infection.  
In kidney transplant recipients the CMV disease incidence varies by serostatus with the highest 
incidence among CMV seronegative (R-) kidney recipients with a transplanted kidney from a CMV 
positive donor.  
In HSCT recipients the risk of CMV infection is mostly due to reactivation of latent CMV infection. 
Hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with prior CMV infection (R+) are at highest risk for 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 104/113 
 
  
 
 
developing CMV reactivation and disease, especially during the first 100 days post-transplant (Özdemir 
2007).  
The risk for CMV infection is reduced after the first 100 days post-transplant as the immune system 
reconstitutes. However, there are certain HSCT populations who remain at high risk for CMV infection 
and/or disease beyond 100 days post-transplant due to delayed immune reconstitution, ongoing 
immunosuppression as a result of treatment for GVHD, or onset of new GVHD when 
immunosuppression is tapered. 
5.2.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The current standard of care in kidney transplant recipients is CMV prophylaxis with valganciclovir 
(VGCV), an orally bioavailable prodrug of ganciclovir. The cumulative rate of CMV disease with no 
prophylaxis in D+/R- kidney transplant recipients may be inferred to above 50% over 12 months, in 
the absence of prophylaxis.  
VGCV has been shown to be efficacious in reducing the incidence of CMV disease both post solid organ 
as well as post HSCT. However, VGCV is poorly tolerated, primarily due to myelosuppression and 
persistent leukopenia and neutropenia. This is a particular problem post HSCT, to the extent that pre-
emptive therapy rather than prophylaxis with VGCV is preferred in this setting.  
5.2.3.  Main clinical studies 
In support of this application, the MAH presented data from the following clinical studies: 
Study P002MK8228  
This was a phase III, randomized, active-controlled, multi-site, double-blind study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of letermovir (LET) compared with valganciclovir (VGCV) administered for 200 days 
post-transplant for the prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in adult seropositive 
donor/seronegative recipient (D+/R) kidney transplant recipients.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants with adjudicated CMV disease through 
52 weeks post-transplant in the FAS population i.e. all randomized participants who received at least 
one dose of study treatment, are D+/R-, and had no detectable CMV viral DNA (measured by central 
laboratory) on Day 1. CMV disease included both CMV end-organ disease and CMV syndrome which 
was defined as CMV viremia together with two or more criteria including specific clinical symptoms or 
laboratory measures. 
This was a non-inferiority study with a non-inferiority margin of 10%. 
A dose of 480 mg LET was administered once daily orally and if co-administered with cyclosporine A 
(CsA), the dosage of LET was decreased to 240 mg once daily. Aciclovir was co-administered with LET 
at 400 mg orally every 12 hours (total dose 800 mg daily) for prophylaxis of herpes simplex virus 
(HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV). VGCV was administered by two tablets 450 mg once daily. 
Overall, 601 participants were randomised and 589 received at least 1 dose of study intervention with 
292 participants in the LET group and 297 participants in the VGCV group.  
Study P040MK8228  
This was a phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel assignment, multicentre, double-blind, 
efficacy and safety study evaluating extending LET prophylaxis to 200 days post-transplant in CMV-
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 105/113 
 
  
 
 
seropositive recipients (R+) of an allogeneic HSCT who had received LET prophylaxis through Week 14 
(~100 days) post-transplant and who were at high risk for CMV infection and/or disease after 
completion of LET prophylaxis through 100 days posttransplant. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants with clinically significant CMV infection 
from Week 14 (~100 days) post-transplant through Week 28 (~200 days) post-transplant. Clinically 
significant CMV infection was defined as the occurrence of either CMV end-organ disease, or initiation 
of anti-CMV PET based on documented CMV DNAemia. 
LET was administered orally at a dose of 480 mg once daily and adjusted to 240 mg once daily for 
participants on CsA, through Week 28 (LET through 200 days) posttransplant. Placebo was 
administered once daily through Week 28 (LET through 100 days) post-transplant. A total of 220 
participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio, with 144 participants treated in the LET group and 74 
participants treated in the placebo group. 
5.3.  Favourable effects 
Study P002MK8228 
Letermovir was demonstrated to be non-inferior to valganciclovir, with 10.4% vs. 11.8% of patients 
with incident cases of CMV disease observed in the LET and VGCV groups respectively. The estimated 
treatment difference was -1.4 (95% CI: -6.5, 3.8) using the observed failure approach (i.e., 
participants who discontinue prematurely from the study for any reason are not considered failures). 
The number of participants with CMV disease at 28 weeks post-transplant was 0 vs. 5 participants in 
the LET and VGCV arms respectively using the observed failure approach. The time to onset of CMV 
disease was comparable between the LET and VGCV groups through Week 52 post-transplant.  
The proportion of participants with quantifiable CMV DNAemia was lower in the LET group compared to 
the VGCV group through week 28 (2.1% vs 8.8%) and slightly lower also through week 52 post-
transplant (31.8% vs 37.7%) supporting the efficacy of LET as prophylaxis. 
Efficacy was consistently demonstrated across subgroups including sex, age, race, region, and 
induction therapy through Week 52 post-transplant.  
Study P040MK8228  
The difference in proportion of participants experiencing clinically significant CMV infection from week 
14 through week 28 post-transplant between the LET and placebo group was, -16.1 (95% CI: -25.8, -
6.5; one-sided p-value =0.0005) using the observed failure approach.  
The proportion of participants with CMV end-organ disease from week 14 through week 28 post-
transplant was 0.7% (1/144) in the LET group and 2.7% (2/74) in the placebo group. 
The treatment difference in the incidence of clinically significant CMV infection by treatment group 
through Week 28 post-transplant across subgroups including age, sex, donor type and 
immunosuppressive regimen were overall consistent with the outcome of the primary endpoint. 
5.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Study P002MK8228  
The sensitivity analysis using the NC=F approach supported the primary analysis, however, it is noted 
that the proportion of discontinuations or missing data is relatively high in both treatment arms (19% 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 106/113 
 
  
 
 
and 18% in LET and VGCV respectively) this adds some uncertainty to the relative effect between LET 
and VGCV.  
There is a numerical imbalance between treatment groups in study P002 in the number of patients 
with end-organ disease, 6 versus 1 patient in the LET and VGCV groups, respectively. Five of the cases 
in the LET group are CMV end-organ GI disease, of which 4 proven and 1 probable CMV end-organ GI 
disease. All participants from the LET group experiencing CMV end-organ disease completed more or 
less the intended duration of treatment (200 days). In almost all cases of CMV end-organ GI disease 
the onset of symptoms started approximately 1-2 months after completing study intervention (one 
participant had symptoms approx. 4 months after completing LET). The primary reason for transplant, 
gender and age varied and no obvious pattern can be discerned. All participants recovered with 
treatment with either oral valganciclovir and/or iv ganciclovir. 
The MAH claims that the difference in GI EOD between the treatment arms in P002 is predominantly 
due to lack of confirmatory endoscopy/tissue-invasive biopsy (required for adjudication confirmed GI 
EOD) in the majority of investigator reported GI EOD. No risk factors could be identified. Moreover, the 
analysis of the primary endpoint in investigator-reported CMV disease through Week 52 post-
transplant also adds support to the efficacy of letermovir. This is likely a random finding. The totality of 
data and the known natural history of CMV post kidney transplantation is compatible with letermovir 
being an effective and useful treatment alternative, that provides acceptable protection against severe 
outcomes. 
The primary endpoint CMV disease included CMV end-organ disease and “probable CMV syndrome”. 
Leukopenia or neutropenia (criteria 3) or thrombocytopenia (criteria 5) are among the listed criteria 
which may be counted to fulfil the definition of CMV syndrome. Leukopenia, neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia are very common (≥1/10) or common (≥1/100 to <1/10) adverse drug reactions 
associated with VGCV. Thus, it was questioned whether the number of cases of CMV syndrome in the 
VGCV arm in study P002 was inflated by the occurrence of cytopenia secondary to VGCV, which would 
impact the primary efficacy analysis in favour of LET. The prophylaxis treatment period was 28 weeks 
and the primary efficacy endpoint was assessed at 52 weeks, after a period of off-treatment follow-up. 
The half-life of VGCV is short (approximately 4 hours) and drug-induced cytopenia is expected to 
resolve within around a week of stopping. The majority of the CMV syndrome events (24/24 LET and 
29/34 VGCV) occurred after cessation of prophylaxis. Most cases of CMV syndrome in the VGCV arm 
that were confirmed on the basis of criteria 3 or 5 being fulfilled were most likely due to actual CMV 
syndrome and not an adverse drug reaction associated with VGCV. 
Viral resistance testing was performed on samples obtained from participants prior to initiation of CMV 
treatment or who had suspected or confirmed CMV disease. There were no LET resistance-associated 
substitutions at a frequency of ≥ 5% in the LET-treated participants with CMV disease or early 
discontinuation with viremia (n=52). The potential contribution of co-administration of aciclovir with 
LET in terms of (cross-) resistance to VGCV is not considered likely. The dose of aciclovir used is below 
the EC50 necessary to treat CMV and would not be expected to exert any selective pressure on the 
virus to induce potential escape mutants. Moreover, LET was effective in suppressing CMV replication 
during the prophylaxis period, making the possibility of resistance selection to aciclovir, and possible 
cross-resistance with VGCV, highly unlikely. Thus, treatment with LET together with aciclovir is not 
likely to compromise the patient’s possibilities for receiving adequate treatment in the event of 
prophylaxis failure.

Study P040MK8228  
In the supportive analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint using NC=F approach 14.6% vs. 24.3% 
CMV infections at week 28 was observed in the LET and placebo groups, respectively (nominal p-
value=0.0505). A total of 16 participants were categorised as “Discontinued from study before Week 
28” post-transplant in the LET arm and one in the placebo group. There were no overall trends in the 
reasons for study discontinuations. With the available data it is not possible to determine if the 
discontinuations are an effect of letermovir treatment.   
5.5.  Unfavourable effects 
Study P002MK8228  
Letermovir when administered to 292 participants at the dose authorised for use post-HSCT and 
proposed for clinical use post-kidney transplant (480 mg once daily (240 mg when co-administered 
with cyclosporin A (CsA)) for up to 28 weeks post-kidney transplant (median duration 175.6 days) was 
associated with a favourable safety profile that was consistent with that characterised from study P001 
in HSCT patients at the time of initial marketing authorisation and with the underlying clinical 
condition. Despite the fact that LET exposure and bioavailability following oral administration in kidney 
transplant patients appears to be higher than in HSCT patients. 
Overall, 92.8% of subjects receiving LET experienced an AE, while 36.3% experienced an SAE, through 
Week 28 post-transplant. The most commonly reported AEs (incidence >10%) for LET were diarrhoea 
(31.5%), tremor (18.2%), urinary tract infection (14.0%), peripheral oedema (13.4%), 
hypomagnesemia (12.7%), leukopenia (11.3%), hypertension (11.3%), hypophosphatemia (10.3%) 
and blood creatinine increased (10.3%). The most frequently reported SAEs (incidence >2%) in the 
LET group were pyrexia, urinary tract infection, blood creatinine increased, acute kidney injury, and 
lymphocele.  
The overall rate of AEs in each treatment group through 28 weeks post-transplant were generally 
comparable between LET and VGCV. Fewer participants in the LET group (4.1%) discontinued study 
intervention due to an AE compared with the VGCV group (13.5%). Leukopenia (LET [1.0%] vs. VGCV 
[5.4%]) and neutropenia (LET [1.4%] vs. VGCV [1.7%]) were the most frequently reported AE leading 
to study intervention discontinuation in either group.  
A total of 5 deaths (LET 3, VGCV 2) due to an AE were reported through Week 52 post-transplant. One 
additional death in the VGCV group was reported through Week 52 post-transplant and 2 deaths were 
reported after the last study visit in the LET group. None of the deaths appear to be related to study 
intervention.  
There were comparable rates between the LET group and the VGCV group of renal graft rejection 
through Week 28 (5.9% (3.5, 9.3) versus 6.1% (3.6, 9.4)) and through Week 52 (8.0% (5.1, 11.7) 
versus 6.7% (4.2, 10.2)). 
Study P040MK8228  
Letermovir when administered to 144 participants at the dose already authorised for use post-HSCT 
(480 mg once daily (240 mg when co-administered with cyclosporin A (CsA)) beyond the authorised 
duration of 14 weeks and up to 28 weeks post-HSCT (median duration 88.2 days) was associated with 
a favourable safety profile that was consistent with that characterised from study P001 in HSCT 
patients at the time of initial marketing authorisation. 
Overall, 88.9% of subjects receiving LET experienced an AE, while 30.6% experienced an SAE, through 
EMA/CHMP/453656/2023  
Page 108/113 
 
  
 
 
Week 28 post-transplant. The overall rate of AEs, drug-related AEs, SAEs and discontinuations due to 
AEs were generally comparable between LET and placebo. The most commonly reported AEs (incidence 
>10%) for LET were GVHD (29.9%), diarrhoea (11.8%) and nausea (11.1%). The most frequently 
reported SAEs (incidence >2%) in the LET group were GVHD, acute myeloid leukaemia recurrent and 
pneumonia.  
A greater number of participants in the LET group (4.9%) discontinued study intervention due to an AE 
compared with the placebo group (1.4%). Six of the seven AEs leading to discontinuation of the study 
intervention in the LET group were SAEs. All occurred as isolated cases and no pattern is evident from 
the data. 
A total of 14 deaths were reported during the Treatment Phase, 11 (7.6%) in the LET group and 3 
(4.1%) in the placebo group. Eight (7 in the LET group and 1 in the placebo group) of the 14 deaths 
were due to recurrence of the participant’s underlying medical condition that necessitated the HSCT 
(relapse mortality). Non-relapse mortality was comparable between the 2 groups. None of the deaths 
appear to be directly related to study intervention.  
The proportion of participants experiencing GVHD was comparable in the LET group and the placebo 
group through Week 28 post-transplant and on through Week 48 post-transplant (38.9% (30.9, 47.4) 
versus 41.9% (30.5, 53.9)). These rates are numerically lower than those seen in both LET and 
placebo arms through Week 14 and Week 24 in study P001. 
5.6.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Study P002MK8228 
The rate of leukopenia can reasonably be attributed to the nearly 100% rate of concomitant use of 
mycophenolate as this is not over and above what would be expected with mycophenolate alone. The 
proportion of participants with leukopenia or neutropenia through Week 28 post-transplant was lower 
in the LET group compared with the VGCV group, which represents a clinically relevant advantage of 
letermovir over alternative. 
Study P040MK8228 
A numerical imbalance in the percentage of patients experiencing AEs in the SOC neoplasms was 
observed between LET 200 days arm (14.6%) versus LET 100 days (placebo) arm (9.5%), which was 
partially driven by a higher number of patients who had recurrent acute myeloid leukaemia [9 patients 
(6.3%) in the LET 200 days arm vs 1 patient (1.4%) in the LET 100 days (placebo) arm]. There 
appears to be no relationship with duration of treatment with LET neither any recurrent pattern, as no 
such difference was seen in the P001 study. The recurrence of AML is not unusual in this population 
and the observed difference in the P040 study may reflect a random imbalance in a relatively small 
study. 
Study P002MK8228 & Study P040MK8228 
Given the higher LET exposure and bioavailability following oral administration in kidney transplant 
patients, a lower intravenous dose of 240mg (without CsA) was added to the study protocol for P002, 
with a view to potentially investigate a more favourable safety profile of the lower dose. However, in 
practice, very few participants in either study received IV LET, and those that did continued only for a 
few days before switching to oral LET. Thus, separate analysis of the safety profile for IV 
administration, including the lower IV dose of 240mg that was planned in study P002, was not 
possible.

5.8.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
5.8.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Study P002MK8228  
CMV is a common pathogen that causes infection and disease (i.e., end-organ involvement or CMV 
syndrome) with substantial morbidity and mortality among kidney transplant recipients. The current 
standard of care VGCV is associated with poor tolerability including myelotoxicity. The efficacy of LET 
has been demonstrated by non-inferiority to VGCV at a likely conservative margin of 10%, with 
regards to proportion of participants with CMV disease.  
The safety profile of LET seems favourable in this indication and comparable with that previously 
established in HSCT patients. The safety data clearly demonstrate a difference in safety profile for 
letermovir versus valganciclovir in terms of the rates of leukopenia reported as adverse events in each 
treatment arm, which represents a clinically relevant advantage of letermovir over alternative. 
Study P040MK8228  
Prophylaxis with Prevymis is currently approved through 100 days post-HSCT. The standard of care for 
prevention of CMV infection and/or disease after 100 days post-transplant is pre-emptive therapy, 
meaning that patients need to be monitored for CMV-DNA very frequently, in order to know whether to 
start valganciclovir pre-emption.  
In study P040, the efficacy of LET as prophylaxis through ~200 days against CMV-DNAemia has been 
demonstrated in HSCT transplanted patients with increased risk of CMV reactivation. Safety was 
favourable and comparable with that previously characterised for LET during the first 100 days post-
HSCT. 
5.8.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Even with consideration to the uncertainties on favourable and unfavourable effects, the benefits of 
letermovir both post-kidney transplant and beyond 100 days post-HSCT outweigh the risks. 
5.9.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of letermovir is positive.

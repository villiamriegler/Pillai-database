twice daily should be used during pregnancy only if the 
expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. 
Raltegravir was not teratogenic in developmental toxicity 
studies in rats and rabbits. A slight increase in incidence of 
supernumerary ribs, a variant in the normal developmental 
process, was observed in rat foetuses of dams exposed to 
raltegravir at approximately 4.4 fold human exposure at 
the recommended human dose (RHD) based on AUC0-24 
hr. No development effects were seen at 3.4 fold human 
exposure at the RHD. Similar findings were not observed in 
rabbits.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions during 
treatment were headache, nausea and abdominal pain. The 
most frequently reported serious adverse reaction was 
immune reconstitution syndrome and rash. The rates of 
discontinuation of raltegravir due to adverse reactions were 
5% or less in clinical trials. Rhabdomyolysis was an 
uncommonly reported serious adverse reaction in post-
marketing use of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily. 
At Week  96, the proportion of patients achieving HIV RNA

study conducted at the CHMP request. The primary 
objective was to evaluate the effect of anti-acid treatments 
(on Isentress pharmacokinetics in HIV-infected adult 
subjects on a stable Isentress -containing ART regimen). 
This study demonstrated that co administration of Isentress 
with agents that increase gastric pH (proton pump 
inhibitors or H2 antagonists e.g., omeprazole and 
famotidine) may increase the rate of Isentress absorption 
and result in increased plasma levels of RAL. Safety profiles 
in the subgroup of patients taking proton pump inhibitors 
or H2 antagonists were comparable with those who were 
not taking these antacids. Therefore no dose adjustment is 
required with use of proton pump inhibitors or H2 
antagonists.

One other case had a plausible temporal relationship to

identified. As a result, the MAH was requested to submit a 
variation to include thrombocytopenia as an adverse 
reaction (ADR).  
A cumulative review of spontaneous and study cases of 
thrombocytopenia through 28 February 2010 identified a 
total of 25 reports with sufficient information for 
assessment. In many of these cases, the aetiology of the 
thrombocytopenic event was not entirely clear. Several of 
the cases reported past medical history and/or concurrent 
conditions. In addition, many patients started other 
antiretroviral agents at, or around, the same time as 
raltegravir. However, good temporal relationships were 
seen in some of the cases and several cases reported a 
positive dechallenge after raltegravir withdrawal.  
Moreover, one case reported a positive rechallenge which 
indicates a probable causal relationship between raltegravir 
and thrombocytopenia. Therefore, the term 
"thrombocytopenia" with a frequency of "uncommon" is 
included in the table of ADRs in section 4.8 of the 
raltegravir SmPC.

SmPC and PL 
The MAH provided 61 reports identified from a cumulative 
marketing data to add the term "rhabdomyolysis" 
with the frequency "uncommon". In line with the 
SmPC guideline, the frequency category of the ADRs 
identified in the post-marketing period "Stevens-
Johnson Syndrome" and "Suicidal ideation and 
suicidal behaviour" is changed from "not known" to 
"uncommon". A footnote is added to the table of 
ADRs in section 4.8 to explain how the frequencies

clinical manifestations, myopathy, and rhabdomyolysis, 
among patients treated with raltegravir, received from 
September 2007 to September 2009, including all 
postmarketing reports and clinical study reports.  
Of the 61 reports, there were 18 reports of blood creatine 
phosphokinase increased and 19 reports of rhabdomyolysis, 
one of which involves a positive rechallenge. Several of the

changes to section 4.4 and 4.8 are introduced in line 
with the SmPC guideline. The PL is updated in 
accordance.

cases are difficult to assess due to the presence of pre-
existing events which put the patient at increased risk of 
rhabdomyolysis, other drugs associated with 
rhabdomyolysis  or because the patient started and 
stopped several antiretroviral agents at the same time. 
However, causality with raltegravir in these cases cannot 
be excluded. 
In line with the advice from the SmPC guideline (revision 2, 
September 2009), this adverse reaction (ADR) is included 
with a frequency of "uncommon".  
Also in line with this guideline, the frequency category of 
the ADRs identified in the post-marketing period "Stevens-
Johnson Syndrome" and "Suicidal ideation and suicidal 
behaviour" is changed from "not known" to "uncommon".

any raltegravir dose levels tested.  In rats, tumours 
(squamous cell carcinoma) of the nose / nasopharynx were 
identified in high and intermediate dose group animals. 
These neoplasms were considered to be secondary to 
chronic irritation and inflammation, also present within the 
nasopharynx and nose, and a consequence of reflux 
aspiration of the study drug. Raltegravir was negative in a 
series of genotoxicity and clastogenicity studies. The data 
did not indicate a relevant risk of carcinogenicity for 
humans.

In the period since first marketing to 28 September 2008, 
postmarketing experience information reported 
within PSUR 2. Consequently, the PL was updated. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
17 reports of depression and 9 reports with a term relating 
to suicidality in association with raltegravir were reported. 
Even though some reports were confounded by the 
patients' condition and concomitant medication, in some 
cases causal association to raltegravir could not be 
excluded.  
Depression, which was observed with raltegravir in 
randomised clinical trials, is already listed as an uncommon 
psychiatric disorder. Suicidal ideation and behaviours 
(particularly in patients with a pre-existing history of 
psychiatric illness) were now added to the SPC under the 
Psychiatric Disorders section with a frequency of 
"unknown".

safety data from ongoing Phase II studies. 
Consequently, the PL and Annex II were updated. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
section 4.5 of the SPC in line with the CHMP 
assessment of Follow-Up Measure 005 to include 
pharmacokinetic interaction data from a study on the 
effect of raltegravir on oral contraceptive 
pharmacokinetics in females. Furthermore, the 
details of the local reprersentatives of Iceland and 
Malta were updated in the PL.

019 for review to further support the benefit/risk 
assessment. The MAH has provided this data as a part of 
this variation in order to fulfil the above SOB, as well as 
pharmacokinetics and long-term safety data from ongoing 
Phase II studies. 
The pharmacokinetics data presented in this variation, in 
particular in relation to concomitant medications gave a 
clearer picture of the interactions. Section 4.5 of the SPC 
was updated to include that raltegravir did not have a 
clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
hormonal contraceptives and to include the related 
pharmacokinetics data. The submitted pharmacokinetics 
data further warranted the mentioning of the effect of less 
potent UGT1A1 inhibitors such as indinavir and saquinavir 
in the SPC. The data further supported an update of the 
existing pharmacokinetic interaction data for tenofovir and 
omeprazole.  
In terms of efficacy, the 48-weeks data overall confirmed 
the effects assessed for the initial Marketing Authorisation, 
however the SPC was updated with the efficacy outcomes 
at week 48 to replace the 24-weeks data. In addition, the 
analysis gave further information in terms of virologic 
responses and viral rebound up to week 48, which was also 
included in the SPC. 
The safety data submitted for this variation overall 
confirmed the previously observed safety profile, however 
the longer term data warranted inclusions of further 
adverse events (rash-related events),  in the SPC. 
Furthermore, also previously not included non-severe AEs 
that occurred at a rate < 1% were listed in the Product

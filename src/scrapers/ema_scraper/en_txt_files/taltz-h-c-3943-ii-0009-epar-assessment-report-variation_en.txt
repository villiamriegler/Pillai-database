2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Ixekizumab (Taltz) is a monoclonal antibody that selectively targets interleukin-17A (IL-17A).  IL-17A 
is produced mainly by inflammatory Th17 cells, a subset of T helper cells, but also by other T cells, 
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 12/156 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
neutrophils, and mast cells.  Increased numbers of IL 17A producing cells are present in the peripheral 
blood, synovial tissue and fluid, and skin plaques of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA; Jandus et al. 
2008; Kagami et al. 2010; Lin et al. 2011; Noordenbos et al. 2012; Menon et al. 2014; Leijten et al. 
2015).  Preclinical and clinical evidence has demonstrated the role of IL-17A signalling in the formation 
of psoriatic lesions, as well as in synovial inflammation, cartilage destruction, and bone erosion 
(Kotake et al. 1999; Koshy et al. 2002; Lee 2013; Lowes et al. 2013).  Neutralisation of IL-17A has 
been shown to inhibit the aforementioned pathological cellular events, as well as mitigate disease 
activity in patients with PsA (Lee 2013; Lowes et al. 2013; Mease et al. 2014b, 2015b, 2017; McInnes 
et al. 2015). 
Taltz is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis at a recommended dose of 
160 mg by subcutaneous (SC) injection at Week 0, followed by an 80 mg injection at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 
10, and 12, then maintenance dosing of 80 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) thereafter.  The positive benefit-
risk profile of ixekizumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis was supported by 
superiority versus placebo and etanercept in achieving clear/almost clear skin and balanced with an 
acceptable safety profile. 
This Type II variation application is for a proposed new indication and associated posology as follows: 
Taltz, alone or in combination with a conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (cDMARD), is 
indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adult patients who have responded 
inadequately to or who are intolerant to one or more DMARD therapies. 
The recommended dose is 160 mg by subcutaneous injection (two 80 mg injections) at Week 0, 
followed by 80 mg (one injection) every 4 weeks thereafter.  For PsA patients with concomitant 
moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, the recommended dosing regimen is the same as for plaque 
psoriasis. 
To support this variation, the efficacy and safety of ixekizumab in PsA were assessed in 2 pivotal, 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III studies (RHAP and RHBE); the placebo-
controlled, double-blind treatment periods were 24 weeks in length.  Each study included separate 
patient populations to address the efficacy and safety profile in bDMARD-naive patients (RHAP) and 
bDMARD-experienced patients (RHBE).  Both studies included assessment of long-term efficacy 
through Week 52. This application includes data up to Week 52 for RHAP. The extension period of 
RHBE is ongoing, and the Week 52 data are anticipated to become available in August 2017. 
In addition to RHAP and RHBE, a third Phase 3 study I1F-MC-RHBF (RHBF) with a randomised-
withdrawal design is on-going to further evaluate maintenance of efficacy. 
The ixekizumab clinical development programme for PsA was informed by scientific advice from the 
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/339078/2011) and the CHMP 
‘Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products for the Treatment of Psoriatic Arthritis 2007’.   
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non- clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH submitted a justification for not submitting any ERA studies since the product is a human 
antibody. This is acceptable by CHMP.

2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
Ixekizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The clinical part of the application includes supportive safety and efficacy data from 2 pivotal Phase 3 
studies in patients with active PsA (I1F-MC-RHAP [RHAP] and I1F-MC-RHBE [RHBE], Table 1), as well 
as safety data accrued in the ixekizumab global clinical development program for patients with PsA or 
with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. To support characterize the clinical pharmacology for 
ixekizumab in patients with PsA, population pharmacokinetic (PK) and exposure-response modelling 
were conducted using serum drug concentration data from the 2 pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies in 
patients with PsA (RHAP and RHBE) in combination with data from 3 studies in patients with psoriasis 
from the initial MAA (I1F-MC-RHAG [RHAG], RHAJ, and I1F-MC-RHAZ [RHAZ]), along with safety and 
efficacy measures from RHAP and RHBE in patients with PsA. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Analytical methods 
Assay for Ixekizumab Serum Concentrations 
Serum samples obtained during this study were analysed for ixekizumab (LY2439821) using a 
validated Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. The lower limit of quantification was 
7.5 ng/mL and the upper limit of quantification was 300.0 ng/mL for analysis. Samples above the limit 
of quantitation were diluted to yield results within the quantifiable range. Samples below the limit of 
quantitation and diluted were repeated at a lesser dilution to yield results within the quantifiable range. 
The inter-assay accuracy (% relative error [RE]) during validation ranged from -20.7% to 7.9%. The 
inter-assay precision (% CV) during validation ranged from 0.9% to2.0%. The intra-assay accuracy (% 
RE) during validation ranged from -4.5% to -3.6%. The intra-assay precision (% CV) during validation 
ranged from 0.7% to 1.6%. Ixekizumab was stable for up to 33 months when stored at approximately 
-70°C ± 10°C; all samples were assayed within 33 month stability. 
Assays for Immunogenicity Screening and Neutralizing Antibody 
Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) assay 
The acid capture and elution enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ACE-ELISA) is the same method 
employed as in the original application. The validation package was updated to re-evaluate a disease 
state patient population specific Tier 1 (screening) cut-point and Tier 2 (confirmatory) cut-point to 
better describe the performance of the method and to align with evolving regulatory expectations. The 
psoriatic arthritis cut-points was compared to the psoriasis cut points and were not found to be 
statistically different. Therefore, The Tier 1 cut point and Tier 2 % inhibition values of 0.169 OD and 
65.9% were retained and was used for clinical testing of samples in this application (studies RHAP and 
RHBE) to detect anti-ixekizumab (anti-LY2439821).   
Re-interpolation of the sensitivity and drug tolerance with the newly assigned cut point yield an assay 
sensitivity of 4.6 ng/mL and drug tolerance of 480.5 μg/mL ixekizumab for 500 ng/mL of affinity 
purified polyclonal anti-ixekicumab from hyper-immune monkey sera. Drug tolerance at additional 
levels of affinity purified polyclonal anti- ixekicumab from hyper-immune monkey sera, 8 ng/mL, 20 
ng/mL, and 45 ng/mL, were also re-interpolated using the newly assigned cut point and yield of 0.5 
μg/mL, 3.1 μg/mL, and 21.5 μg/mL of LY2439821, respectively. 
Neutralising Anti-Drug Antibody (NAb) assay 
The neutralising ADA assay is the same method employed as in the original application and was 
updated to re-establish neutralizing antibody inhibition cut point, drug tolerance and sensitivity based 
on disease specific (psoriatic arthritis) baseline patient samples to align with evolving regulatory 
expectations. The assay is based on electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection using the Meso Scale 
Discovery (MSD) platform and detects NAbs by direct competition between the binding of the 
therapeutic target (IL-17) and binding of ADA at the active site of ixekizumab. 
The disease state validation parameters re-established for psoriatic arthritis baseline patient samples 
were statistically different from the psoriasis disease parameters and the disease specific parameters 
were therefor used for the clinical testing in this application. The psoriatic arthritic cut point was found 
to be 10.2% inhibition. The psoriatic arthritic sensitivity established was 135.3 ng/mL and the drug 
tolerance was 1.8 μg/mL ixekizumab for 5000 ng/mL of affinity purified polyclonal anti-ixekicumab 
from hyper-immune monkey sera. The measured drug tolerance of the assay may not be sufficient for 
all samples collected at the dosing regimens in Phase 3 related to the expected trough ixekizumab

concentration (predicted 5th to 95th percentile Cmin: 80 mg Q4W: 0.3 to 3 ug/ml).  Given the 
polyclonal nature of the affinity purified surrogate control, it is likely that not all of the control material 
is neutralizing, and thus, the drug tolerance assessment is likely greater than indicated for the 
detection of NAb. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
To describe ixekizumab PK in patients with PsA, ixekizumab concentration data from the PsA trials 
(Studies RHAP and RHBE) were integrated with the psoriasis PK dataset (Studies RHAG, RHAJ, and 
RHAZ, all available data). The characteristics for the PsA patients included in the PK analysis are 
summarized in Table 2. A total of 2966 concentrations from 657 patients were available in Studies 
RHAP and RHBE, of which 20 (0.67%) were below the detection limit of the PK assay. The total 
number of PK samples included in the PK analysis (all indications) is summarised in Table 3.

Table 3 
Summary of Number of Pharmacokinetic Data by Study 
All existing covariate relationships identified in the psoriasis analysis were retained in the new model, 
and the model parameters were re-estimated including the PsA data.   
Additional covariate evaluation was conducted for the following covariates:  PsA as an indication, 
concomitant use of MTX, and prior use of MTX or adalimumab, as these are factors associated with the 
patient population in Studies RHAP and RHBE.  None of these factors were found to be significant, 
indicating they do not affect ixekizumab PK.  The PK parameters from the final model are shown in 
Table 4 and visual predictive checks are displayed in Figure 1.

CL individual = CL*(bodyweight/89.9)0.975*(1+0.0433*LOG(ADA titer))*(1+0.464*NAb), where NAb is 0 for 
negative/inconclusive NAb result and 1 for positive NAb result. 
c  Q individual = Q * (bodyweight/89.9)0.975 
d  Variability fixed to 15% to optimize efficiency of SAEM algorithm (Nonlinear Mixed Effects Modeling Program 
[NONMEM] 7.3.0 user guide). 
e  V 2,individual = V 2 * (bodyweight/89.9)0.614, V 3,individual = V3 * (bodyweight/89.9)0.614 
f  Estimate fixed to that from the FOCEI model where BQL data were not included.  The 95% CI of F is 0.496 –
 0.662 for Studies RHAG and RHAJ, 0.673 – 0.886 for Study RHAZ, 0.660 – 0.887 for Study RHAP, and 0.532 – 
0.710 for Study RHBE. 
g  Estimate is on the logit parameter for F.  This translates to an increase in F for the thigh injection site from 
0.575 to 0.686 for Studies RHAG and RHAJ, from 0.784 to 0.855 for Study RHAZ, from 0.764 to 0.840 for Study 
RHAP, and from 0.612 to 0.719 for Study RHBE.

The majority of PK parameters estimated in the combined PsA/psoriasis PK model were similar to the 
psoriasis model indicating the consistency of PK between patients with PsA and psoriasis.  Additionally, 
disease status (PsA versus psoriasis) was not significant when evaluated as an additional covariate.  In 
addition, key PK parameters for patients with psoriasis and for patients with PsA from the respective 
models are summarized in Table 5 showing consistency between the 2 populations.

c  This includes the effect of site of injection on bioavailability.  Population estimates from the model for 
subcutaneous injections via areas other than thigh were 61.2% for Study RHBE and 76.4% for Study RHAP.  
The magnitude of the increase in CL due to being NAb positive was smaller in the current combined 
PsA/psoriasis PK analysis compared with the prior psoriasis only analysis due to the implementation of 
the new disease-specific cut point assay for determining NAb status. 
The additional significant covariates included in the combined PsA/psoriasis PK model are shown below.  
The magnitudes of these effects on PK are comparable between the current combined PsA/psoriasis PK 
analysis and the original psoriasis analysis in the submission and are therefore not described further.  
None of these factors impacted the dosing regimen recommendations.   
• 
Body weight:  On parameters reflecting clearance (CL, Q) and volume (V2, V3), best 
described using an allometric relationship, showing that as body weight increases, both CL 
and V terms increase. 
• 
• 
Injection site:  SC injection via the thigh resulted in higher bioavailability (F) compared with 
the other areas of the body (arm, abdomen, or buttock). 
Immunogenicity:  Increasing anti-drug antibody (ADA) titer was associated with an increase 
in CL. 
Overall, the present analysis suggests that ixekizumab PK are similar between patients with PsA and 
patients with psoriasis.  Concomitant use of MTX or recent prior use of MTX or adalimumab does not 
change ixekizumab PK.

To further explore the impact of immunogenicity on CL in patients with PsA, the final population PK 
model, was modified such that the impact of ADA titre on CL was split (i.e., described by 2 
parameters), 1 for patients with psoriasis and the other for patients with PsA. Similarly, 2 parameters 
were used to describe the impact of NAb on CL for patients with psoriasis and for patients with PsA, 
respectively. It was found that the CL–titre relationship in patients with PsA was still significant. 
However, the CL–NAb relationship was no longer significant for patients with PsA, likely due to the 
small number of NAb-positive samples in patients with PsA from the current studies. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Relationships between Exposure and Efficacy 
The exposure-response analyses were performed using the PsA dataset only (Studies RHAP and 
RHBE). Observed ACR20/50/70 response data at Week 24 and observed time-matched drug 
concentrations were used to develop the ACR static model.  Observed PASI 50/75/90/100 response 
data at Week 12 and observed time-matched drug concentrations were used to develop the PASI static 
model.  Observed ACR20/50/70 responses up to and including Week 24 data and model-predicted PK 
parameters based on available ixekizumab concentration data through Week 24 were used to develop 
the ACR time course model. 
ACR Week 24 Static Model 
The ACR static model was conducted based on observed ACR responses and time-matched ixekizumab 
serum concentrations at Week 24. The dataset includes 279 patients from Study RHAP and 310 
patients from Study RHBE who were randomized to receive 1 of the 2 ixekizumab regimens or placebo, 
observed data is summarised in Table 6.

Table 6 
Observed Percentage of Patients Achieving Week 24 ACR Percent 
Improvements in Study RHAP and Study RHBE Based on the 
Exposure Response Analysis Dataset 
Non-responder imputation (NRI) was conducted for placebo patients who were assessed to be 
inadequate responders (placebo-IR) and received ixekizumab treatment prior to Week 24, where their 
Week 24 ACR scores were set to represent not achieving ACR20 and their drug concentration values 
were set to 0.  An ordered categorical model well described the exposure-response relationship of 
ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rates simultaneously.  Age and sex were found to be significant 
covariates on drug effect.  Briefly, males tended to have higher response rates than females.  For 
patients aged 55 years or older, ACR response rates were similar irrespective of age.  For patients 
aged 55 or younger, ACR response rates tended to increase with decreasing age. Many additional 
covariates were tested (for example, body weight, immunogenicity, prior failure on anti-tumor necrosis 
factor [anti-TNF] treatment, concomitant MTX, and prior MTX treatment) but were not found to be 
significant and thus do not impact ACR responses. The final parameter estimates from the static ACR 
model are summarised below:

observed following Q2W and Q4W dosing, which were overlaid with observed median ixekizumab 
concentrations and corresponding ACR response rates at Week 24 for each dosing regimen.  Results 
indicated that rates of response are similar across dosing regimens despite the higher range of 
exposure achieved with the Q2W regimen.

response.

ACR Time Course Model 
A time course model was also developed to evaluate the exposure-response relationship for ACR 
scores over time, up to Week 24 (VPC plots shown in Figure 3).  Covariate analysis was restricted to 
the 2 significant covariates (that is, age and sex) identified in the ACR static model in addition to prior 
experience with anti-TNF therapy, which differentiates the patient population between Studies RHAP 
(biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs [bDMARDs]-naive) and RHBE (bDMARDs-
experienced).  Like the ACR static model, age and sex were identified as significant covariates on drug 
effect, whereas prior experience with anti-TNF therapy was not identified as a significant covariate in 
the ACR time course model.

to Week 16.  The shaded area is the 90% confidence interval (CI) of the model prediction.  Visual predictive 
check (VPC) for Studies RHAP and RHBE combined is shown in the first row, for Study RHBE in the second

The ACR time course model was used to simulate scenarios that address multiple factors 
simultaneously, including differences in age, sex, and dosing regimen (Figure 4).  The model does not 
account for any dropouts, so simulated results may appear somewhat higher than observed NRI 
results.  Based on the model, both dosing regimens are predicted to result in similar rates of responses 
that plateau after approximately 16 weeks of treatment within the age and sex subgroups.  The 
simulations indicate that younger males had a higher response rate compared with older females; 
however, there appeared to be no additional benefit on response predicted with the higher exposures 
associated with the Q2W dosing regimen relative to the Q4W dosing regimen in each of the age and 
sex subgroups, suggesting that increasing the dosing frequency from Q4W to Q2W would not be 
expected to offer additional efficacy based on ACR response that would be considered clinically 
meaningful in patients with active PsA.

PASI Week 12 Static Model  
Analyses with the PASI static model were conducted based on observed PASI responses (in patients 
from RHAP and RHBE with BSA ≥ 3% at baseline) and time-matched ixekizumab serum concentrations 
at Week 12.  An ordered categorical model well described the exposure-response relationship for PASI 
50, PASI 75, PASI 90, and PASI 100 response rates simultaneously (VPC plots shown in Figure 5).  The 
factors evaluated as potential covariates were the same as those assessed in the ACR static model.  No 
significant covariates were detected.

concentrations and corresponding PASI response rates at Week 12 for each dosing regimen.  Overall, 
the Q2W regimen was associated with a higher predicted percentage response rate compared with the 
Q4W dosing regimen, especially for PASI 90 and PASI 100 responses.  The higher range of observed 
concentrations for patients in the Q2W dosing regimen group (the purple-shaded areas) ensured the 
majority of patients were on the plateau of the exposure-response curve and thus were likely to 
achieve a response.  This is compared with the Q4W dosing regimen group where the range of 
exposures (the orange-shaded areas) was lower and encompassed the slope of the curve resulting in 
fewer patients predicted to achieve a response.

Relationships between Exposure and Safety 
Ixekizumab serum concentrations used in the present analyses were observed trough concentrations 
(Ctrough) at Week 24 from patients who participated in the Double-Blind Treatment Period up to Week 
24 (Studies RHAP and RHBE) and the observed Ctrough at Week 52 for those who participated in the 
Extension Period from Weeks 24 to 52 (Study RHAP).  Placebo data were included in the comparison of 
the Double-Blind Treatment Period up to Week 24.  Treatment-emergent adverse events evaluated 
were all infections and, specifically, infections due to Candida or staphylococcal and infection-related 
serious adverse events (SAEs), injection site reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, Crohn’s disease, 
major adverse cerebrocardiovascular events (MACE), and neutropenia Grade 2 or higher. 
When applicable, these TEAEs were summarized for each exposure quartile and evaluated visually for a 
trend of exposure-safety relationship.  No apparent relationship to exposure was observed for all 
infections within the exposure range following the Q2W and Q4W regimen (Figure 7).

Exposure-response relationship was observed for injection site reactions only (Figure 8), in both the 
Double-Blind Treatment Period (up to Week 24) and the Extension Period (Weeks 24 through 52).  Of 
note, the exposure-response relationship correlates the drug concentration in the blood circulation to 
the response of interest.  When it is applied to injection site reactions, caution should be taken to 
interpret the finding because, if this is primarily due to a local reaction then an alternative relationship 
may exist between the number of SC injections with ixekizumab and the incidence rate.  Per study 
protocols, patients under Q2W regimen should receive twice as many ixekizumab injections as those 
under Q4W regimen, and consequently will have higher drug concentrations in systemic circulation.  In 
Figure 8, all patients reporting injection site reactions in the 4th drug concentration quartiles were 
treated with the Q2W regimen. 
The exposure-response relationship for injection site reactions was similar between the PsA studies 
and the psoriasis studies as shown in the psoriasis submission.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Standard methods and software have been used in the development and evaluation of the population 
PK models. The goodness-of-fit graphs and visual predictive checks indicate that the population PK 
model fit adequately to the data. The level of detail of the visual predictive checks could have 
benefited from increased binning and representation on normal scale; however it is not expected to 
influence the overall conclusion on PK.  
Body weight, ADAs and neutralizing antibodies were included as significant covariates on ixekizumab 
PK. The parameter estimates for the allometric scaling exponents are not in line with the theoretical 
values of 0.75 (CL) and 1 (V), although due to the indicated adequacy of the model the further 
investigation is not sought for. Graphical presentation of the body weight influence on PK display that a 
120 kg patient receive approximately 2-fold decrease in plasma concentration compared to a 60 kg 
patient. Furthermore, simulations of the exposure-ACR relationship display that the difference in

exposure does not translate into differences in ACR response. Thus,  dose adjustment for heavy weight 
patients is not required.   
Based on the population estimates, an ADA in the moderate titer range (1:≥ 160 and 1:<1280) was 
associated with an increase in CL of approximately 20% to 30% and being NAb positive was associated 
with an increase in CL of 46% compared to in ADA negative patients. It is pointed out, however, that 
the combined PsA/psoriasis PK dataset is largely represented by the psoriasis population, where a 
higher number of NAb positive samples were associated with higher ADA titers compared to the PsA 
population. The effect of antibodies in patients with PsA has been determined.  However there is 
insufficient data to inform on the effect of neutralising antibodies in PsA patients.  
The population PK analysis indicate that the pharmacokinetics of ixekizumab is similar between PsA 
and psoriasis patients. Body weight, site of injection, study and immunogenicity were included as 
covariates on ixekizumab PK and were not deemed to warrant any dose adjustments. There were no 
apparent differences in CL after Q2W or Q4W treatment. Further, there was no significant effect of 
concomitant or prior recent use methotrexate or adalimumab on ixekizumab PK.  
Exposure efficacy analysis 
Adequate methods and software have been used in the development and evaluation of exposure-
response relationships. The logistic regression models were used for the two static models and a latent 
variable response model was used for the ACR Time Course model.  
At the lower exposure range (<2.5 µg/ml) it is indicated, across all exposure-response analyses, that 
there is somewhat lower effect and it seems as these concentrations are measured given a q4w dosing 
regimen. Although for a majority of the exposure range the maximum effect is reached which speaks 
in favour of the less frequent Q4W dosing regimen. Sex and age were identified as significant 
covariates for the effect. However, due to the flat exposure-response relationship there is no strong 
indication that a dose adjustment is warranted for females and elderly patients. 
The ACR time course model indicates a similar response over time, up to 24 weeks, between the Q2W 
and Q4W regimen, and the model predictions does not indicate a faster response onset with a more 
frequent dosing (i.e. Q2W dosing). 
The static PASI model was used to determine the exposure-response relationship at week 12. The 
response for PASI 75 seems to be close to maximum effect for the entire exposure range, for PASI 90 
and PASI 100 exposure-response relationship was somewhat more pronounced and there was a 
tendency that the effect was slightly higher for concentrations given a Q2W dosing regimen. 
Exposure-Safety analysis 
A graphical analysis was performed for infections and injection site reactions versus ixekizumab 
exposure quartiles. The graphical analysis is deemed adequate although quartiles of exposure are a 
quite blunt grouping of the exposure range, it is not anticipated that a more detailed graphical display 
would reveal any hidden relationships.  Further, all patients reporting injection site reactions in the 4th 
drug concentration quartiles were treated with the Q2W regimen. No overall exposure-infection 
relationship was detected, although a slight increase in infections versus exposure was apparent in the 
extension period of the RHAP study.

2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The population PK analysis indicate that ixekizumab PK is similar in patients with psoriatic arthritis and 
moderate to severe psoriasis.  
Overall, the established exposure-efficacy relationships for all investigated endpoints indicate that the 
maximum effect is reached for a majority of the studied exposure range. No significant difference was 
detected in response onset between Q2W and Q4W dosing regimen. 
No overall exposure-infection relationship was detected, although a slight increase in infections versus 
exposure was apparent in the extension period of the RHAP study.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The efficacy and safety of ixekizumab in PsA were assessed in 2 pivotal, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, Phase III studies (RHAP and RHBE, Table 7); the placebo-controlled, double-blind 
treatment periods were 24 weeks in length.  Each study included separate patient populations to 
address the efficacy and safety profile in bDMARD-naive patients (RHAP) and bDMARD-experienced 
patients (RHBE).  The ixekizumab clinical development programme for PsA was informed by scientific 
advice from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/339078/2011) 
and the CHMP ‘Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products for the Treatment of Psoriatic 
Arthritis 2007’.

a  Placebo IRs at Week 16 were re-randomised 1:1 to receive either ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W or Q4W dosing regimens, with a starting dose of 
160 mg, beginning at Week 16. 
b  Placebo responders or nonresponders at Week 24 were re-randomised 1:1 to receive either ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W or Q4W dosing 
regimens, with a starting dose of 160 mg, beginning at Week 24. 
c  Adalimumab IRs at Week 16 were re-randomised 1:1 to receive either ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W or Q4W dosing regimens starting at Week 
24, following an 8-week placebo washout period.

regimens starting at Week 32, following an 8-week placebo washout period. 
In line with CHMP scientific advice, RHAP (bDMARD-naive population) also included an adalimumab 
reference arm.  The study was designed to evaluate the efficacy response of 2 separate dosing 
regimens of ixekizumab as compared to placebo in patients with PsA.  Both studies included

assessment of long-term efficacy through Week 52.  This application includes data up to Week 52 for 
RHAP.  The extension period of RHBE is ongoing, and the Week 52 data are anticipated to become 
available in August 2017. 
In addition to RHAP and RHBE, a third ongoing Phase III study I1F-MC-RHBF (RHBF) was designed to 
address CHMP scientific advice recommendation of employing a randomised-withdrawal design to 
further evaluate maintenance of efficacy.  RHBF is a Phase III, multicentre study with a 36-week, 
initial, open-label treatment period, examining the effect of ixekizumab 80 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) in 
patients with active PsA who are inadequate responders (IRs) to cDMARDs and are bDMARD-naive, 
followed by a randomised, double-blind withdrawal period from Week 36 to Week 104, examining the 
effect of ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W compared to placebo.  The primary objective of the study is to 
compare ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W with placebo in the maintenance of treatment response, as measured 
by the time to relapse during the randomised, double-blind withdrawal period.  
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
The dosing regimens selected for the pivotal Phase III studies in PsA were based on the following: 
•  Dose-ranging data from bDMARD-naive and bDMARD-IR populations in I1F-MC-RHAK (RHAK) 
(Phase II rheumatoid arthritis [RA] study) 
•  Dose-ranging data from I1F-MC-RHAJ (RHAJ) (Phase II psoriasis study) 
• 
Final dosing regimen selection for the pivotal Phase III studies in patients with moderate-to-
severe plaque psoriasis. 
The ixekizumab dosing regimens (80 mg Q2W and 80 mg Q4W) for the pivotal Phase III studies in PsA 
were designed to provide an assessment of the clinical safety and efficacy, as well as the associated 
benefit-risk profile in patients with PsA.  A 160 mg starting dose was included for earlier attainment of 
steady-state concentrations and to allow a rapid onset of response.  This starting dose was similar to 
the initial doses in the Phase II studies in RA (RHAK) and psoriasis (RHAJ) which showed early onset of 
ACR20 and at least a 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score from baseline 
(PASI 75), respectively. 
In CHMP scientific advice, CHMP was concerned on entering Phase III with dosing regimens that had 
not been evaluated in the target patient population. However, CHMP deemed it acceptable to 
extrapolate dose findings in RA and psoriasis to PsA, which is the approach that the MAH took. 
2.4.2.  Main studies 
2.4.2.1.  Introduction 
The application for Taltz in psoriatic arthritis is supported by two pivotal phase III studies. Study RHAP 
is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
outpatient study in patients with active PsA who are bDMARD-naive. Study RHBE is a Phase III, 
multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, outpatient study in patients 
with active PsA who are cDMARD- and bDMARD-experienced and either inadequate responders (have 
discontinued at least 1 TNFi due to either an inadequate response [based on a minimum of 12 weeks 
on therapy]), or intolerant to, a TNFi.  
Patients enrolled in the pivotal Phase III trials fulfilled the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis 
(CASPAR); had active PsA, defined as the presence of at least 3/68 tender and at least 3/66 swollen 
joints; and had active psoriatic skin lesions or a documented personal history of plaque psoriasis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 34/156 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Since RHAP evaluated radiographic joint damage, patients were required to have at screening either 
≥1 disease-related hand or foot joint erosion on centrally read x-rays or C-reactive protein (CRP) >6 
mg/L to further ensure a patient population with active PsA, include ng those with underlying erosive 
disease and a propensity for radiographic progression.  RHAP enrolled patients who were naive to 
bDMARDs, regardless of past or present cDMARD use.  Patients were then randomised in 1:1:1:1 ratio 
to placebo, adalimumab, ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W, or ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W.  Randomisation was 
stratified by country and by prior/current/no use of cDMARDs.  In line with CHMP scientific advice, 
RHAP included a separate analysis on the cDMARD-experienced population (past use or current use) to 
support the proposed indication for this application. 
RHBE enrolled patients with prior treatment of ≥1 cDMARD and who had an inadequate response (lack 
of efficacy) to 1 or 2 TNFi or who were intolerant to a TNFi.  Patients were randomised in 1:1:1 ratio to 
placebo, ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W, or ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W.  Randomisation was stratified by country 
and TNFi experience; 56%, 35%, and 9% of patients had an inadequate response (lack of efficacy) to 
1 TNFi, 2 TNFi, or were intolerant to TNFi, respectively. Consistent with CHMP scientific advice, both 
pivotal studies allowed concomitant background therapy (eg, MTX, corticosteroids), as long as the dose 
was stable prior to randomisation and remained unchanged during the Double-Blind Treatment Period.  
In RHAP and RHBE, 64% and 51%, respectively, were currently being treated with a cDMARD, of 
whom 85% and 81%, respectively, were receiving MTX.   
The design of the studies is presented below.

Week 16 by the IVRS/IWRS system to investigators who were required to make modifications to the patient’s background therapy as 
rescue therapy at this visit, which was maintained for the remainder of the Double-Blind Treatment Period (unless change was required for 
safety reasons).  The inadequate response criteria were blinded to investigators, study personnel, and patients (the criteria were described

remained on the same dose regimen during the Extension Period.  Patients who were on placebo at the end of the Double-Blind Treatment 
Period received a 160 mg starting dose of ixekizumab at Week 24, then were re-randomized (1:1) to an ixekizumab regimen.  Patients 
who were on adalimumab at the end of the Double-Blind Treatment Period underwent an 8-week washout period, received their initial 80 
mg dose of ixekizumab at Week 32, then were re-randomized (1:1) to an ixekizumab regimen.   
f  Statistical analyses for the primary and major secondary endpoints were controlled for multiplicity.  Major Secondary Endpoints are 
listed in the order of testing.  For patients who were inadequate responders at Week 16, only data up to the Week 16 injections were 
included in the double-blind treatment analyses. 
2.4.2.2.  Study RHAP (bDMARD-naive patients) 
Study RHAP was a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, outpatient study in patients with active PsA who were bDMARD-naive. The study was 
conducted by 118 investigators, all rheumatologists or dermatologists, at 115 study sites in 15 
countries.  
Methods 
Study participants 
The patients enrolled in this trial fulfilled the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR); had 
active PsA, defined as the presence of at least 3/68 tender and at least 3/66 swollen joints; and had 
active psoriatic skin lesions or a documented personal history of plaque psoriasis. 
Since RHAP evaluated radiographic joint damage, patients were required to have at screening either 
≥1 disease-related hand or foot joint erosion on centrally read x-rays or C-reactive protein (CRP) >6 
mg/L to further ensure a patient population with active PsA, including those with underlying erosive 
disease and a propensity for radiographic progression.  RHAP enrolled patients who were naive to 
bDMARDs, regardless of past or present cDMARD use. 
Key inclusion criteria 
Patients included in this trial were male or female patients who were 18 years or older, with an 
established diagnosis of PsA (of at least 6 months duration) and currently met the Classification 
Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR). 
Patients were also required to have the following: 
1.  active PsA defined as the presence of at least 3/68 tender and at least 3/66 swollen 
joints, as determined by the Tender and Swollen Joint Count Assessment Form at 
Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 2 (Week 0, baseline) 
2.  at least 1 disease-related definite joint erosion on hand or foot x-rays as determined 
by the central reader OR a C-reactive protein (CRP) >6 mg/L at screening 
3.  active psoriatic skin lesions (plaque) or a documented history of plaque psoriasis

• 
• 
• 
• 
ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W SC (with a starting dose of 160 mg ixekizumab)

Patients in each treatment group who were Inadequate Responders (IRs) at Week 16, defined as 
patients who failed to meet defined criteria for improvement in tender joint count (TJC) and swollen 
joint count (SJC) at Week 16, received rescue therapy (changes to concomitant medications). IRs at 
Week 16 who had been assigned to placebo or adalimumab were also re-randomized (1:1) to either 
ixekizumab dose regimen at that time. Patients who were originally randomized to adalimumab went 
through a blinded placebo washout phase for 8 weeks (from after Week 16 until Week 24) before 
starting ixekizumab.  
Patients commenced the study in the active- and placebo-controlled Double-Blind Period (Weeks 0 to 
24).  Patients who completed the Double-Blind Treatment Period entered the Extension Period (Weeks 
24 to 52).  Following the Extension Period is a 2-year Long-Term Extension Period (open-label once 
last patient in study completed Week 24).  At the date of data cutoff, all patients had completed the 
Double-Blind Treatment Period and the Extension Period.  The Long-Term Extension Period is ongoing. 
For the purposes of safety monitoring, all patients who received ≥1 dose of ixekizumab entered the 
Post-Treatment Follow-Up (PTFU) Period following either treatment discontinuation or their last 
scheduled visit.  Patients participated in the PTFU Period for a minimum of 12 weeks; for patients who

required continued monitoring for neutropenia or other safety reasons, participation in this period was 
extended as necessary. 
Patients who were inadequate responders at Week 16 received rescue therapy. For patients 
randomised to placebo or adalimumab, this meant re-randomisation to either ixekizumab dose. 
Patients initially randomised to ixekizumab received modification of the concomitant therapy. This 
could be either modification of DMARD dose (up to maximum 25 mg MTX, 400 mg hydroxychloroquine, 
20 mg leflunomide or 3 g sulfasalazine/day), introduction of new DMARD, adjustment of oral 
corticosteroid dose up to 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent, intra-articular injection of a 
corticosteroid. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to assess whether ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W or 80 mg Q4W was 
superior to placebo in the treatment of bDMARD-naive patients with active PsA, as measured by the 
proportion of patients achieving ACR20 response at Week 24.  
The major secondary objectives of the study were to assess whether ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W or 80 mg 
Q4W was superior to placebo in the treatment of patients with PsA who are bDMARD naive on the 
following measures:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
change from baseline to Week 24 in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-
DI) scores  
change from baseline to Week 24 in modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) on hand and foot x-
rays  
proportion of patients achieving ACR20 response at Week 12  
proportion of patients achieving Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 (at least a 75% 
improvement in PASI score from baseline) response at Week 12 (restricted to patients with 
baseline psoriatic lesion(s) involving ≥ 3% body surface area [BSA])  
change from baseline to Week 12 in Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI) in patients with enthesitis at 
baseline  
change from baseline to Week 12 in itching severity using the Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) 
(restricted to patients with baseline psoriatic lesion(s) involving ≥ 3% BSA) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the American College of Rheumatology 20% response rate (ACR20)

A description of the endpoints used in the phase III program follows below.  
Health Assessment Questionnaire—Disability Index (HAQ-DI) 
One of the ACR core domains, the HAQ-DI consists of 24 questions referring to 8 domains:  
dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other daily activities (Fries et al. 
1980,1982).   
The disability section of the questionnaire scores the patient’s self-perception on the degree of 
difficulty (0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable 
to do), covering the 8 domains.  The reported use of special aids or devices and/or the need for 
assistance of another person to perform these activities is also assessed.  The scores for each of the 
functional domains were averaged to calculate the functional disability index.  A threshold for minimal 
clinically important difference (MCID) of ≥0.35 was set for the categorical analysis of this endpoint 
(Mease et al. 2011). 
Van der Heijde Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) for PsA  
Structural progression in the peripheral joints was measured using the mTSS for PsA (van der Heijde 
2005), and the major secondary endpoint was mTSS change from baseline at Week 24.   
This mTSS methodology quantifies the extent of bone erosions (20 locations per hand/wrist and 12 
locations per foot) and joint space narrowing (JSN; 20 locations per hand/wrist and 6 locations per 
foot), with higher scores representing greater damage.  The total mTSS at a time point is the sum of 
the erosion (maximum of 320) and JSN (maximum of 208) scores for a maximum total score 
achievable per patient of 528.  The 24-week efficacy endpoint in mTSS was chosen to allow adequate 
time to demonstrate inhibition of structural joint damage from treatment with ixekizumab, while 
minimizing the duration of treatment with placebo.   
During screening, all patients meeting entry criteria had a single postero-anterior radiographic 
assessment of the left and right hand/wrist and a single dorso-plantar radiographic image taken of the 
left and right foot.  These images were reviewed and assessed centrally by 1 of 5 qualified readers for 
evidence of erosive bone change(s).  The initial radiographs obtained at screening served as the 
baseline radiographs for analyses.   
The independent read of radiographs was performed centrally by 2 primary readers, and 1 adjudicator 
when necessary, based on predefined criteria.  The 2 primary readers each read 100% of radiographic 
images from the study patients, blinded to the chronologic order of the images and the patient’s 
identity or treatment group.  To check if a consistent read was applied by the independent readers, an 
inter/intra reader variability assessment was included in the central imaging core laboratory 
independent read.  Images were read in 2 “campaigns.”  In Campaign 1, images from Weeks 0, 16, 
and 24 were read.  Campaign 1 images were used for the analysis during the Double-Blind Treatment 
Period (Weeks 0 to 24).  In Campaign 2, images from Weeks 0 and 24 were re-read, alongside images 
from Week 52.  Campaign 2 images were used for the analysis during the Extension Period only.   
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 
The PASI combines assessments of the extent of body-surface involvement in 4 anatomical regions 
(head, trunk, arms, and legs) and the severity of desquamation, erythema, and plaque 
induration/infiltration (thickness) in each region, yielding an overall score of 0 for no psoriasis to 72 for 
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 42/156 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
the most severe disease (Fredriksson and Pettersson 1978).  Patients achieving PASI 75, 90, or 100 
are defined as having an improvement of at least 75%, 90%, or 100%, respectively, in the PASI 
compared to baseline. 
Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI) 
The LEI has been developed specifically for use in PsA.  It measures enthesitis at 6 sites (lateral 
epicondyle, left and right, medial femoral condyle, left and right, Achilles tendon insertion, left and 
right) (Healy and Helliwell 2008).  Each site is assigned a score of 0 (absent) or 1 (present); the 
results from each site are then added to produce a total score (range 0 to 6).  
Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) 
The Itch NRS is a patient-administered, 11-point horizontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0 
representing “no itch” and 10 representing “worst itch imaginable.”  Overall severity of a patient’s 
itching from psoriasis is indicated by circling the number that best describes the worst level of itching 
in the past 24 hours. 
Minimal Disease Activity (MDA) 
Minimal Disease Activity is a stringent composite endpoint that was developed as a treatment goal 
specifically for PsA.  This measure of near-remission relies upon 7 key outcome measures 
encompassing most domains of PsA (Coates et al. 2010a; Coates and Helliwell 2010).  A White Paper, 
located in Module 5.3.5.3, provides an overview of the scientific evidence demonstrating that MDA is a 
suitable measure for evaluating treatment effect on health status. 
Patients are classified as achieving MDA if they fulfill 5 of the 7 outcome measures:  TJC ≤1; SJC ≤1; 
PASI total score ≤1 or BSA ≤3; patient pain VAS score of ≤15; patient global disease activity VAS 
score of ≤20; HAQ-DI score ≤0.5; and tender entheseal points ≤1.  These criteria for MDA were 
validated in observational cohorts as well as in pharmacologic clinical trials of PsA where it was shown 
to predict improvements in physical function and radiographic progression (Coates and Helliwell 
2010b; Coates et al. 2010b; Kavanaugh et al. 2016).   
MDA was also evaluated using static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) instead of PASI to assess 
skin involvement; however, unless otherwise specified, this report summarizes MDA using PASI (as 
described above). 
American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Response Criteria – ACR50 and ACR70 
ACR50 and ACR70 represent improvements of at least 50% and 70%, respectively, in the multiple 
disease assessment ACR criteria, and are calculated in the same manner as ACR20. 
Psoriatic Arthritic Response Criteria (PsARC) 
The PsARC is a composite measure reported in terms of the percentage of patients achieving response 
according to the following endpoints:  TJC, SJC, Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity VAS, 
and Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity VAS.  Overall response is defined by improvement 
from baseline assessment in 2 of 4 criteria, 1 of which must be a joint count, and there must not be 
worsening in any of the 4 criteria.  A modified version of the PsARC was used in RHAP and RHBE to 
reflect that the patient’s and physician’s global assessments each used a 100-mm VAS) (instead of the 
5-point Likert scale in the original criteria [Clegg et al. 1996]):

At least a 20-mm reduction in patient’s assessment. 
Disease Activity Score–C-Reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP) 
The DAS28-CRP is a measure of disease activity in 28 joints that consists of a composite numerical 
score utilizing the following variables:  TJC, SJC, CRP (measured in mg/L), and the Patient’s Global 
Assessment of Disease Activity VAS. 
For DAS28-CRP, the 28 joints to be examined and assessed for TJC and SJC are a subset of those 
assessed for the ACR response criteria, and include 14 joints on each side of the patient’s body:  the 2 
shoulders, the 2 elbows, the 2 wrists, the 10 metacarpophalangeal joints, the 2 interphalangeal joints 
of the thumb, the 8 proximal interphalangeal joints, and the 2 knees (Smolen et al. 1995). 
Composite Psoriatic Disease Activity Index (CPDAI) 
The CPDAI is a validated instrument intended to assess composite psoriatic disease activity and 
response to therapy (Mumtaz et al. 2010).  This instrument assesses individual domains involved as 
well as the global effect of disease in all dimensions by which each patient may be affected.  Domains 
include peripheral arthritis as assessed by the number of tender and swollen joints and the HAQ-DI, 
skin as assessed by the PASI and the DLQI, enthesitis as assessed by the number of sites with 
enthesitis and the HAQ-DI, dactylitis as assessed by the number of digits affected and the HAQ-DI, 
and spinal disease as assessed by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) 
and Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL).  Scores range from 0 to 15 for assessment 
including spinal disease (BASDAI), and 0 to 12 for assessment excluding spinal disease, with a higher 
score indicating higher disease activity. 
The ASQoL was not collected in Study RHAP, so the CPDAI was modified to include BASDAI only, giving 
a score range of 0 to 14.  The ASQoL was collected in RHBE, so the CPDAI was analyzed in 2 ways for 
this study:  the original way (as described by Mumtaz et al. [2010]), and then without the axial 
domain (neither BASDAI nor ASQoL). 
Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) 
The BASDAI is a self-administered VAS (100 mm) used to answer 6 questions pertaining to the 5 
major symptoms of axial activity:  1) fatigue; 2) neck, back, or hip pain; 3) joint pain/swelling other 
than neck, back, or hips; 4) areas of localized tenderness; 5) overall level of morning stiffness; and 6) 
duration of morning stiffness (Garrett et al. 1994).  To give each symptom equal weighting, the mean 
of the 2 scores relating to morning stiffness is taken.  The resulting 0 to 50 score is divided by 5 to 
give a final 0 to 10 BASDAI score. 
Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada Criteria (SPARCC) 
The SPARCC enthesitis index evaluates tenderness in a total of 16 enthesitis sites:  the greater 
trochanter (right/left [R/L]), quadriceps tendon insertion into the patella (R/L), patellar ligament 
insertion into the patella and tibial tuberosity (R/L), Achilles tendon insertion (R/L), plantar fascia 
insertion (R/L), medial and lateral epicondyles (R/L), and the supraspinatus insertion (R/L) (Mease 
2011).  Tenderness at each site is quantified on a dichotomous basis:  0 = non-tender and 1 = tender.  
The results from each site are then added to produce a total score (range 0 to 16). 
The SPARCC was administered by an independent assessor to minimize bias.  The assessor was not 
involved in patient care and was asked not to discuss disease activity or treatment with patients or 
principal investigator.  The SPARCC was only collected in RHBE. 
Leeds Dactylitis Index–Basic (LDI-B)  
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 44/156 
 
  
  
 
 
 
If the patient had dactylitis, the LDI-B was administered.  The LDI-B was developed to measure the 
severity of dactylitis (Helliwell et al. 2005; Healy and Helliwell 2007).  The LDI-B total score is based 
on the presence of dactylitis in a digit(s).  For each digit that is dactylitic, as defined by a minimum 
increase of 10% in circumference of the dactylitic digit (A) over the contra-lateral digit (B), the ratio 
(A/B) of the circumference of the affected digit to the circumference of the digit on the opposite hand 
or foot is measured.  If the same digits on each hand or foot are thought to be involved, the clinician 
refers to a table of normative values (provided to investigative sites) for a value which will be used to 
provide the comparison; this concept is also applied if there is a contralateral missing finger or toe. 
The calculated ratio (A/B) is then subtracted by 1, multiplied by 100, and then multiplied by a 
tenderness score (C) of 0 (not tender) or 1 (tender).  The results of each digit are then added to 
produce the LDI-B total score. 
LDI-B total score = sum ((((A/B)-1)*100)*C) 
The LDI-B was administered by an independent assessor to minimize bias.  The assessor was not 
involved in patient care and was asked not to discuss disease activity or treatment with patients or 
principal investigator. 
Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA)  
The sPGA is the physician’s determination of the patient’s psoriatic lesions overall at a given time 
point.  The sPGA is recommended as an endpoint to assess efficacy in the treatment of psoriasis 
(European Medicines Agency [EMEA] 2004).  Plaques are assessed for induration, erythema, and 
scaling, and an overall rating of psoriasis severity is given using the anchors of clear (0), minimal (1), 
mild (2), moderate (3), severe (4), or very severe (5).   
Percentage of Body Surface Area (BSA) Involvement of Psoriasis 
The BSA is the percentage involvement of psoriasis on each patient’s BSA on a continuous scale from 
0% = no involvement to 100% = full involvement, where 1% corresponds to the size of the patient’s 
handprint including the palm, fingers, and thumb (National Psoriasis Foundation 2009). 
Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) 
The NAPSI is a numeric, reproducible, objective tool for evaluation of nail psoriasis (Rich and Scher 
2003).  This scale is used to evaluate the severity of nail bed psoriasis and nail matrix psoriasis by 
area of involvement in the nail unit.   
The nail is divided with imaginary horizontal and longitudinal lines into quadrants.  Each nail is given a 
score for nail bed psoriasis (0 to 4) and nail matrix psoriasis (0 to 4), depending on the presence (1) 
or absence (0) of any of the features of nail psoriasis in each quadrant.  The NAPSI score of a nail is 
the sum of scores in nail bed and nail matrix from each quadrant (thus a maximum of 8).  Each nail is 
evaluated, and the sum of all the nails is the total NAPSI score.  Thus, the sum of the scores from all 
nails is 0 to 80, or 0 to 160 if toenails are included (Rich and Scher 2003).  In RHAP and RHBE, only 
fingernail involvement was assessed.   
Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) 
The SF-36 is a 36-item patient-administered measure designed to be a short, multi-purpose 
assessment of health in the areas (or domains) of physical functioning, role-physical, role-emotional, 
bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, mental health, and general health.  The 2 overarching domains 
of mental well-being and physical well-being are captured by the mental component summary (MCS) 
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 45/156 
 
  
  
 
 
 
and physical component summary (PCS) scores.  The summary scores range from 0 to 100, with 
higher scores indicating better levels of function and/or better health. 
A White Paper and a Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) Dossier, providing an overview of the scientific 
evidence demonstrating SF-36 as a suitable measure for evaluating treatment effect on health status, 
are provided in Module 5.3.5.3. 
Fatigue Severity Numeric Rating Scale (Fatigue NRS) 
The Fatigue NRS is a patient-administered, single-item, 11-point horizontal scale anchored at 0 and 
10, with 0 representing “no fatigue” and 10 representing “as bad as you can imagine.”  Patients use 
this tool, developed for Study RHAP, to rate their fatigue (feeling tired or worn out) by selecting the 
one number that describes their worst level of fatigue during the past 24 hours. 
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 
The DLQI is a simple, patient-administered, 10-question, validated, quality-of-life questionnaire that 
covers 6 domains including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal 
relationships, and treatment.  Response categories include “not at all,” “a lot,” and “very much,” with 
corresponding scores of 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and unanswered (“not relevant”) responses scored 
as 0.  The recall period is “over the last week” and totals range from 0 to 30 (less to more 
impairment), and a 5-point change from baseline is considered clinically relevant (Basra et al. 2008).  
The DLQI was assessed in patients with baseline psoriatic lesion(s) involving ≥3% BSA. 
DLQI total scores were interpreted as:  0 to 1 no effect; 2 to 5 small effect; 6 to 10 moderate effect; 
11 to 20 very large effect; and 21 to 30 extremely large effect. 
European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions 5 Level (EQ-5D 5L) 
The EQ-5D 5L consists of 2 components:  a descriptive system of the respondent’s health and a rating 
of his/her current health state using a 100-mm VAS.  The descriptive system comprises:  mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.  Each dimension has 5 levels:  no 
problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems.  The 
respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by marking the box associated with the most 
appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions.   
The VAS records the respondent’s self-rated health on a vertical VAS where the endpoints are labeled 
“best imaginable health state (100)” and “worst imaginable health state (0).”  This information can be 
used as a quantitative measure of health outcome.  The EQ-5D 5L health states, defined by the EQ-5D 
5L descriptive system, may be converted into a single summary index by applying a formula that 
attaches values to each of the levels in each dimension (EuroQol Group [WWW]). 
Work Productivity and Activity Impairment–Specific Health Problem (WPAI-SHP) 
The WPAI-SHP consists of 6 questions to determine employment status, hours missed from work due 
to PsA, hours missed from work for other reasons, hours actually worked, the degree to which PsA 
affected work productivity while at work, and the degree to which PsA affected activities outside of 
work.  Four scores are derived:  percentage of absenteeism, percentage of presenteeism (reduced 
productivity while at work), an overall work impairment score that combines absenteeism and 
presenteeism, and percentage of impairment in activities performed outside of work.  Greater scores 
indicate greater impairment (Reilly Associates Health Outcomes Research [WWW]). 
Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology–Self Report (16 items) (QIDS-SR16) 
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 46/156 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The QIDS-SR16 is a self-administered 16-item instrument intended to assess the existence and 
severity of symptoms of depression as listed in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) (APA 1994).  A patient is asked to 
consider each statement as it relates to the way they have felt for the past 7 days.  There is a 4-point 
scale for each item ranging from 0 to 3.  The 16 items corresponding to 9 depression domains are 
summed to give a single score ranging from 0 to 27, with higher scores denoting greater symptom 
severity. 
The ACR20 has been used as the primary endpoint in multiple registration studies of PsA treatments, 
and is recommended in EMA Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment 
of psoriatic arthritis (CHMP/EWP/438/04). The ACR20 takes into consideration 7 components relating 
to disease activity and severity which are listed below.  The ACR20 is defined as having at least a 20% 
improvement in:   
• 
Tender joint count (TJC) – 68 joint count.  A positive response for pressure, movement, or 
both was translated into a single tender/nontender dichotomy. 
•  Swollen joint count (SJC) – 66 joint count.  Joints were classified as either swollen or not 
swollen, defined as palpable fluctuating synovitis of the joint.   
And, at least a 20% improvement in ≥3 of the following criteria: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Patient’s assessment of pain visual analog scale (VAS) – Patient marked their level of joint pain 
on a VAS; results expressed in millimeters (higher numbers equal greater pain). 
Patient’s global assessment of disease activity VAS – Higher numbers represent more active 
disease. 
Physician’s global assessment of disease activity VAS 
Patient’s assessment of physical function Health Assessment Questionnaire—Disability Index 
(HAQ-DI)  
•  Acute phase reactant as measured by C-reactive protein (CRP).   
The primary and major secondary efficacy variables covers relevant aspects of the disease, and are 
overall endorsed. In the background information to the advice sought from the CHMP, the primary 
endpoint was originally intended to be ACR20 at Week 12. As stated by the applicant, “The 24-week 
efficacy endpoint for ACR20 response was chosen because steady-state exposure is expected to be 
reached by this time point, and it is likely that a maximal clinical effect will be observed within this 
timeframe in both ixekizumab dosing regimens, based on previous studies with ixekizumab in patients 
with RA and Ps”. ACR20 at 24 Weeks is the same primary endpoint as used in the phase III program 
for Cosentyx and is considered acceptable. 
The primary endpoint is based on subjective assessment by the patient and the clinician. The primary 
endpoint is as advised by the Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment 
of psoriatic arthritis, CHMP/EWP/438/04, Dec 2006 and so is acceptable.  
Each VAS was a 10cm line on to which the patient placed a mark to indicate severity. 
The company does not appear to have provided examples of the various VAS tools (other than a 
written description) or instructions on how to use. This was clarified during the assessment. 
The company has submitted a published description of the HAQ though does not appear to have 
submitted the HAQ tool as used in the current study.

LEI is a relevant outcome measure that has been specifically developed for use in PsA and it has been 
used in several PsA clinical trials on certolizumab, secukinumab and clazakizumab (Mease et al. 2017). 
The NRS was developed and validated based on a study with baricitinib, and three Phase III 
ixekizumab studies on skin psoriasis. MDA has been shown in one study to be predictive of less 
structural degradation and has been validated as a treatment target (Coates et al. 2015) 
The company has submitted results of very many clinical outcome assessment tools. It is appreciated 
that the ACR, mTSS, PsARC, PASI and SF-36 are described in CHMP guidelines yet the company does 
not appear to have qualified these tools for use in the current submission for psoriatic arthritis. For 
other tools, the company seems to rely on published manuscripts unrelated to the current 
development programme as evidence of content validity, reliability, ability to detect change and 
interpretability.  
Overall, a number of secondary outcomes are included in the study, including measures of peripheral 
arthritis, axial symptoms, dactylitis, skin and nail engagement, enthesitis, composite disease activity 
scores and health outcome measures. Since psoriasis is a heterogenous disorder with either a 
peripheral joint disease or an axial disease, both with concomitant enthesitis, dactylitis and skin/nail 
engagement, it can be necessary to provide several outcome measures with such diverse outcome 
measures and this is thereby endorsed.  
Sample size 
The total planned sample size for the study was 412 patients randomized at 1:1:1:1 ratio to 4 
treatment groups in the Double-Blind Treatment Period: ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W, ixekizumab 80 mg 
Q4W, adalimumab 40 mg Q2W, and placebo. To account for multiple testing for the 2 ixekizumab 
groups, a 2-sided Fisher’s exact test at the 0.025 level was assumed. With 103 patients per treatment 
group, this study had >99% power to test the superiority of each ixekizumab dose regimen to placebo 
for ACR20 response at Week 24 (Visit 10), assuming ACR20 response rate at Week 24 was 48% for 
each ixekizumab group and 15% for the placebo group. It was estimated that approximately 75% of 
the total sample size had cDMARD experience at study baseline, which was approximately 77 patients 
per treatment group; this sample size would provide approximately 97% power to test the difference 
between each ixekizumab dose regimen and placebo in the cDMARD-experienced subpopulation, 
assuming ACR20 response rate was 46% for each ixekizumab group and 15% for the placebo group. 
With 103 patients per treatment group, this study had approximately 90% power to test the 
superiority of each ixekizumab dose regimen compared with placebo for change from baseline in mTSS 
at Week 24 (Visit 10) using a 2-sided t test at the 0.025 level. This assumed a difference of 0.59 in 
change from baseline mTSS between placebo and ixekizumab, and an SD of 1.19.  
The split of α given the two ixekizumab groups is endorsed by CHMP. The sample size was seemingly 
determined to provide sufficient power to show a difference (versus placebo) with regard to the major 
secondary mTSS endpoint. For the primary analyses the power was >99% implying a high power also 
in the subpopulation of cDMARD-experienced patients since expected to comprise approximately 75% 
of the total sample size. This was to be a subset of the Intent-to-treat Population defined as all 
randomised patients who had conventional DMARD experience (i.e. past or current use) at baseline for 
which a number of analyses, besides analyses of the primary endpoint, were pre-planned. 
Randomisation 
At Week 0 (baseline, Visit 2), patients who met all criteria for enrolment at Visit 1, Visit 1A, and Visit 2 
were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to treatments arms with randomisation being stratified by 
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018

country and cDMARD experience (naive, past use, and current use).  Inadequate Responders at Week 
16 receiving placebo or adalimumab were re-randomised (1:1) to ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W or 80 mg 
Q4W (those receiving adalimumab were to complete a placebo washout phase until Week 24) and 
received rescue therapy. Inadequate responders at Week 16 in the ixekizumab groups continued 
receiving ixekizumab to both maintain the blind and allow additional response time in case of slow-
responders in this group. 
At Week 24 (Visit 10), patients remaining in the placebo and adalimumab treatment groups at the 
completion of Double-Blind Treatment Period (Period 2) were re-randomized (1:1) to ixekizumab 80 
mg Q2W or Q4W; those receiving adalimumab completed a placebo washout phase until Week 32 after 
having received their final dose of adalimumab at Week 24. 
The stratification factors are endorsed by CHMP. Regarding the re-randomisation of inadequate 
responders in the placebo and adalimumab arm, outcomes of comparisons between treatments at 
week 16 will be valuable in support of primary outcomes at week 24.      
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study; patients, study site personnel, and sponsor study team were blinded to 
study drug, including re-randomisations at Week 16 and Week 24, until all patients completed Week 
24 (Visit 10) or had discontinued from the study (moved into Period 5) and the reporting database 
through Week 24 had been locked. Blinding was achieved by the use of double-dummy technique with 
placebo for ixekizumab and placebo for adalimumab. At Week 16 (Visit 8), patients were classified as a 
responder or non-responder according to blinded criteria defined in the IRB Supplement to the study 
protocol; these criteria were to remain blinded to investigators, study personnel, and patients. 
Statistical methods 
Comparisons between each ixekizumab 80 mg regimen (Q2W or Q4W) and placebo were performed for 
all analyses in Period 2 as were comparisons between adalimumab and placebo. There were no 
statistical comparisons between each ixekizumab dose regimen and adalimumab or between 
ixekizumab dose regimens. 
Unless otherwise specified, analyses were conducted on the Intent-To-Treat (ITT) Population.  The ITT 
Population was defined as all randomised patients analysed according to the treatment to which they 
were assigned. For patients who were inadequate responders at Week 16, only data up to Week 16 
were included in the Double-Blind Treatment Period analyses. 
Treatment comparisons of categorical efficacy variables, including the primary endpoint proportion of 
patients with ACR20 response at Week 24, were made using a logistic regression analysis with 
treatment, geographic region, and conventional DMARD experience at baseline (naive, past use, and 
current use) in the model. The proportions and 95% confidence interval were reported. Missing data 
were handled using a non-responder imputation (NRI). 
The primary analyses were repeated using the Per Protocol Set (PPS); a subset of the ITT Population 
defined as all randomised patients who were compliant with therapy, who did not have significant 
protocol violations, and whose investigator’s site did not have significant GCP issues. For patients 
eligible for rescue therapy at Week 16 to be included in the PPS, the above requirements only applied 
up to Week 16. In addition, the primary, major secondary and some other non-gated important 
secondary efficacy (ACR20/50/70, DAS28-CRP, HAQ-DI ≥0.35) and health outcome (Quick Inventory 
of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (16 Items) [QIDS-SR16] total score) endpoints were 
analysed using the Conventional DMARD-experienced Population. This was a subset of the Intent-to-
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 49/156 
 
  
  
 
 
 
treat Population defined as all randomised patients who had conventional DMARD experience (i.e. past 
or current use) at baseline. 
The primary analyses for all continuous gated outcome variables were based on a mixed-effects model 
for repeated measures (MMRM) method. The model included treatment, geographic region (Europe and 
ROW), baseline score, conventional DMARD experience at baseline (naive, past use, and current use), 
visit, and the interaction of treatment-by-visit as fixed factors. 
The secondary approach to the analysis of the structural progression data after MMRM was the linear 
extrapolation method, which assumes that individual patients would continue to accrue structural 
damage in their joints at the same rate that was observed at their time of last observation. As a third 
approach a multiple imputation (MI) approach was used for the Week 24 analyses of mTSS, bone 
erosion score (ES), and joint space narrowing (JSN). A set of Bayesian regressions using SAS Proc MI 
were utilized for the imputation of missing values due to dropout, rescue or treatment reassignment, 
unevaluable images, or otherwise missing data such as surgically modified (for example, joint 
replacement or other surgery).  
As supportive analyses of continuous gated efficacy variables (except mTSS) were performed using 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment, geographic region, baseline value, and conventional 
DMARD experience at baseline (naive, past use, and current use) in the model. To handle missing data 
a modified baseline observation carried forward (mBOCF) approach was used. For patients eligible for 
rescue therapy at Week 16, their last non-missing observation prior to initiation of rescue therapy will 
be carried forward. For patients discontinuing investigational product due to an AE, the baseline 
observation were carried forward. For patients discontinuing investigational product for any other 
reason, the last non-missing observation before discontinuation were carried forward. Randomized 
patients without at least 1 post-baseline observation were excluded with the exception of patients 
discontinuing study treatment due to an AE. 
In addition, sensitivity analyses using LOCF were performed. This approach was identical to the 
mBOCF approach, with one exception: for patients discontinuing investigational product due to an AE, 
the last non-missing post-baseline observation before discontinuation was carried forward to the 
corresponding endpoint for evaluation. Randomised patients without at least one post-baseline 
observation were excluded for evaluation. A third approach for the analysis of major continuous 
endpoints at Visit 10 (Week 24) was the Placebo Multiple Imputation (pMI) method. Placebo Multiple 
Imputation assumes that the statistical behaviour of drug- and placebo- treated patients after 
discontinuing study medication becomes that of placebo-treated patients. 
A graphical approach to multiplicity control was used to control the family-wise type I error rate at a 2-
sided alpha level of 0.05 and allow simultaneous inference of the primary and all major secondary 
endpoints (Bretz et al. 2009, 2011; Alosh et al. 2014). The total α was initially split equally between 
the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W and 80 mg Q4W dose regimen;  the primary hypothesis (ACR20) for these 
2 doses were allocated a type I error of α/2 (of 0.025) and all other hypotheses are allocated α =0.  All 
the primary and secondary endpoints within a dose regimen were to be tested in a sequential manner; 
each test for a particular dose was to be performed only if all prior tests at that dose were significant. 
For each dose schedule, if a test was not significant, all subsequent tests were not significant. If all the 
hypotheses for a dose regimen had been rejected at α/2 (or 0.025 level) then the hypotheses related 
to other dose regimen could be tested at level α (or 0.05 level). 
Subgroup analyses were planned for ACR20 response rate at Week 24 and change from baseline to 
Week 24 in mTSS using the ITT population.

CHMP comments : 
The statistical analysis plan for Study RHAP is overall acceptable with some remarks. In all analyses, 
data collected after start of rescue/week 16 were ignored. Although this is an acceptable primary 
approach, sensitivity/supportive analyses including data post-rescue should have been planned  as 
discussed within the scientific advice procedure 2011 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/339078/2011). Categorical 
endpoints, including the primary endpoint, were analysed using logistic regression with missing data 
handled using a non-responder imputation. For the analysis of the primary endpoint (and other 
categorical endpoints) this implied that patients with inadequate response week 16 were treated as 
non-responders.  
For continuous endpoints the primary analysis approach was MMRM. Considering the missing at 
random assumption, sensitivity/supportive analyses will be valuable.  
Sensitivity analyses for major categorical endpoints were seemingly not pre-planned. Additional 
analyses based on e.g. categorical MMRM have however been performed; whether pre-planned or not, 
with the primary approach considered to be acceptable, additional analyses for assessment of 
robustness were further discussed. 
For major continuous endpoints except mTSS analyses were repeated using ANCOVA and a modified 
baseline-observation-carried-forward (mBOCF) approach and last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) 
respectively as well as MMRM using pMI. The mBOCF implied that the baseline observation was carried 
forward only for patients discontinuing study treatment due to an AE, for other reasons, the last non-
missing observation before discontinuation were carried forward. In all cases except treatment 
discontinuation due to an AE, a post-baseline observation was used for imputation. The difference 
between analyses using mBOCF and analyses using LOCF may  hence be small. For mTSS at least two 
additional analysis approaches were planned and have been performed including an ANCOVA using 
linear extrapolation that initially was considered primary.  
Regarding the definition of the Safety Population, patients were to be analysed according to the 
treatment to which they were assigned at Week 0. Generally, and more appropriate, patients should 
be analysed according to the actual treatment received. However, during the double-blind period all 
patients seemingly received their assigned treatment but for one (who had a dosing error at Week 8, 
in which the patient took ixekizumab 80 mg after receiving 6 weeks of adalimumab). 
A number of post hoc analyses were performed after database lock and unblinding including a 
sensitivity analysis on ACR20 response rates at Week 24 based on the PPS and excluding all patients 
from one  Site which was closed for persistent GCP noncompliance. Considered to be for check of 
robustness or for clarifying/exploratory purposes, no concern is raised. 
Treating patients with completely missing data as non-responders is agreed to be an appropriate 
approach, especially considering that the majority of the missing data at week 24 was created by the 
study design and was those patients with an inadequate response at week 16. 
Results 
Study RHAP (bDMARD-naive patients) 
Participant flow 
A total of 719 patients entered the study. Prior to randomization at Week 0, 302 patients discontinued 
from the study. In total, 417 patients were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups as the ITT

Population: 107 to ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W, 103 to ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W, 101 to adalimumab 40 mg 
Q2W, and 106 to placebo (Table 11). A total of 91.6% of randomized patients completed the Double-
Blind Treatment Period; greater percentages of patients in the ixekizumab groups (Q4W, 90.7%; Q2W, 
94.2%) completed the Double-Blind Treatment Period compared with the placebo group (85.8%). One 
patient in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W group was reported as ongoing in the Double-Blind Treatment 
Period at the time of database lock. The patient was actually lost to follow-up after Visit 8 (Week 16) 
and should have been reported as discontinued during the Double-Blind Treatment Period. This data 
was entered after database lock, causing the status of this patient to display as ongoing. Patient 
disposition and reasons for discontinuation is shown in Figure 11 and Table 9 below.

Reasons for discontinuation from study drug for the ITT Population during the Double-Blind Treatment 
Period were similar across treatment groups. It is noted that there were (about) 3 times the number of 
inadequate responders in the placebo arm versus the three ‘active’ arms. The most common reasons 
for study drug discontinuation among patients in the placebo group were lack of efficacy, patient 
decision, and sponsor decision. One patient in the placebo group was lost to follow-up. One patient in 
the ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W group was lost to follow-up during the Double-Blind Treatment Period, but 
due to a data error, the patient was recorded as ongoing in the Double-Blind Treatment Period at the 
time of database lock. For the total ixekizumab group, the most common reasons for study drug 
discontinuation were entry criteria not met and adverse event. 
Recruitment 
First patient enrolled (assigned to therapy): 09 January 2013 
Last patient completed Week 52 Visit (Extension Period): 15 June 2015 
Date of database lock: 04 September 2015 
Conduct of the study 
There was one protocol amendment and 1 protocol addendum, and 2 protocol addendum 
amendments. The first patient was enrolled after implementation of the amendments and addendum, 
with the exception of the second protocol addendum amendment, which was implemented after all 
patients had enrolled.  
In the first addendum, chest x-rays were added at the end of the Extension Period, at the end of 
study, and at early termination. Also, instructions were added regarding the proper injection of the 
study drug, caregiver administration of the study drug, and recording details of the injection in the 
injection log. Beta-D-Glucan, KL-6, and HBV testing was added.

In the second (global) amendment (12 Nov 2012), following feedback from the FDA, the most 
important changes were:  
•  At Week 16, all Inadequate Responders were rescued through modification or addition of 
background therapy, including cDMARDs, NSAIDs, analgesics, and/or corticosteroids. Placebo 
Inadequate Responders received ixekizumab in a blinded manner in addition to these 
treatments.  
• 
• 
Patient-level discontinuation criteria for signs and symptoms were applied at Week 32 and 
beyond.  
The total study duration was shortened from 5 to 3 years.  
Two addendums (Japan) was approved at 10 Dec 2012 and 10 Feb 2016, concerning minimum 
dose of MTX at study entry and increased dose of ixekizumab from 80 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) to 
80 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) during the Long-Term Extension Period, at the investigor’s discretion.  
In summary, the amendments were done prior to the first patient enrolled, and should have no impact 
on the result of the study. The addendum approved after study start did not affect the double-blind 
part of the study. 
Baseline data 
The mean age of patients in the ITT Population was 49.5 years. The majority of patients were female 
(54.0%) and white (94.0%). The patient demographics are detailed in Table 10 below.

Patients in the pivotal phase III trials fulfilled the CASPAR criteria for psoriatic arthritis. To be classified 
as psoriatic arthritis according to these criteria, patients must have inflammatory articular disease 
(joint, spine or entheseal) and ≥3 points from the following categories: Current psoriasis (2p) or 
personal or family history of psoriasis (1p), psoriatic nail dystrophy on current examination (1p), 
negative rheumatic factor (1p), dactylitis (current or on history as recorded by rheumatologist, 1p) or 
radiographic evidence of juxtaarticular new-bone formation (1p) (Tillett et al, J Rheumatology 2012). 
The CASPAR classification criteria are validated and have been used in several clinical studies and are 
considered acceptable. The patients must have an active disease, defined as at least 3 tender and 
swollen joints. The EMA PsA guideline does not provide definite classification criteria or definition of 
disease activity, but these criteria of active disease are identical to the ones used in the secukinumab 
trials, which is a relevant comparator.  
To permit evaluation of radiographic outcome, patients with erosive disease or patients at risk of joint 
destruction (defined as laboratory signs of inflammatory activity) were enrolled in the study.  
Concomitant treatment with analgesics and NSAIDs, including COX-2 inhibitors, were allowed to the 
maximum recommended doses for pain. DMARDs were allowed, but alteration of DMARD dose and/or 
introduction of a new DMARD were not permitted during the double-blind period. Oral corticosteroids 
was allowed up to 10 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent. 
In advice given by the CHMP (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/339078/2011), the company was discouraged to 
include patients naive to conventional DMARDs, since this would lead to a heterogenous study 
population with a combination of DMARD-naive and DMARD-experienced patients. The study was not 
powered to draw conclusions on the DMARD naive subpopulation. In this study, there is however a 
small proportion (14.6 %) of patients naive to DMARD therapy included. The sought indication is based 
on the DMARD-experienced population, as it follows “Taltz, alone or in combination with conventional 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (cDMARD), is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic 
arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more 
DMARD therapies (see section 5.1)”

Table 11. Concomitant Therapy Safety Population Double-Blind Treatment Period of 
study RHAP  
The majority of the patients on cDMARD therapy was on MTX. Only a minority was treated with 
other cDMARDs, for example sulfasalazine or leflunomide. (refer to discussion later in relation to 
the indication) 
Numbers analysed 
All the efficacy and health outcome endpoints were conducted on the ITT Population. The primary 
endpoint analysis of ACR20 response rate at Week 24 was repeated using the PPS. The primary, 
major secondary, and some important other secondary and health outcome analyses were also 
conducted using the cDMARD-Experienced Population. This dataset covered 355 patients with prior 
or current treatment with MTX, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, or 
cyclosporine randomised to either placebo (n=93), adalimumab (n=87), IXE80Q4W (n=90) or 
IXE80Q2W (n=85). Efficacy analyses were also conducted on the Inadequate Responder 
Population.  
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary efficacy variable ACR20 response using non-responder imputation for the ITT at Week 
24 is shown in Table 12 and Figure 12. A higher proportion of patients in the ixekimumab 80 mg 
Q4W group and ixekimumab 80 mg Q2W group, compared to placebo, reached ACR20 response 
and the primary endpoint was thus met. The proportion of ACR20 responders in the IXE80Q4W 
group was similar to the proportion in the adalimumab group (57.9% and 57.4 %), and the 
response rate was slightly higher in the IXE80Q2W group (62.1 %). The ACR20 response rates for 
ixekizumab were different to placebo already at Week 12 (57%/60.2% vs 31.1 % in placebo).

Secondary efficacy results 
Using multiplicity-controlled (gated) analyses, statistically significant differences for the ixekizumab 80 
mg Q2W group, compared with the placebo group, and for the ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W group, 
compared with the placebo group, were observed for all major secondary endpoints with the exception 
of change from baseline to Week 12 in LEI (p>.025) and change from baseline to Week 12 in Itch NRS 
(not tested because of the multiplicity control strategy) (Table 13 and Table 14).

Analyses of the other secondary endpoints were not multiplicity controlled. Statistical significance when 
referring to a non– multiplicity-controlled analysis was based on a nominal p-value <.05.  
Both ixekizumab groups differed from placebo (based on nominal p<.05) in the other secondary 
efficacy measures (ACR50/70, ACR-N, individual components of the ACR Core Set, DAS28-CRP, 
MDAsPGA, MDAPASI, PsARC, BASDAI, LDI-B, improvement in enthesitis and dactylitis, sPGA, 
percentage of BSA involvement of psoriasis, and NAPSI) and the secondary health outcomes endpoints 
of change from baseline in Itch NRS (except at Week 12 using multiplicity-controlled analyses), Fatigue 
NRS, health-related quality-of-life (as assessed by the SF-36 PCS), and depressive symptomology (as 
assessed by the QIDS-SR16 [Q2W only]).  
Study RHAP met its primary outcome; ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W and 80 mg Q2W provided superior 
ACR20 responses at Week 24 compared to placebo. ACR20 responses were seen already at Week 12 
and were maintained over time. There were numerically higher ACR20/50 response rates for 
Ixekizumab than for adalimumab. Ixekizumab was superior to placebo in inhibition of bone destruction, 
as measured by the mTSS at Week 24. As stated in the advice given by the CHMP, 24 weeks is a very 
short time to evaluate joint destruction. In the scientific advice, it was asked for descriptive evidence 
of joint structure preservation 12 and 24 months after baseline. In this application, only 12 month data 
are presented. In line with the results presented in the application for treatment in skin psoriasis, 
ixekizumab was superior to placebo based on the proportion of patients achieving PASI 75.  
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 63/156 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The proportion of patients classified as Inadequate Responders in each of the ixekizumab groups were 
smaller (Q4W, 11 patients [10.3%]; Q2W, 10 patients [9.7%]) compared with the placebo group (27 
patients [25.5%]). This is considered to support the efficacy of ixekizumab. In the primary analysis 
data collected post-rescue were ignored and patients with inadequate response week 16 were treated 
as non-responders. This approach is acceptable. However, the company was requested by CHMP to 
provide the analysis of the primary endpoint taking all data collected up to week 24 into account 
irrespective of whether a patient received rescue or not, using a conservative approach. In the 
submitted analysis where observed data after Week 16 for Week 16 inadequate responders was 
included, the difference in ACR20 response rate at Week 24 between IXE80Q4W and IXE80Q2W 
respectively and placebo was smaller than in the primary analysis, due to a higher placebo response 
rate. The difference between treatment arms were however still statistically significant irrespective of 
comparison.   
Results of the “other” secondary endpoints must be interpreted with knowledge of the absence of 
multiple-testing correction. Taken this into account, ixekixumab was superior to placebo in axial 
symptoms (change from baseline in BASDAI in the subset with baseline BASDAI>4, N=295). 
The population for the LEI is a subpopulation of the ITT. Any apparent improvement at week 12 was 
not maintained. 
Analysis in cDMARD-Experienced Population 
For the cDMARD-Experienced Population, there were a statistically significantly higher percentage of 
patients who achieved ACR20 response at Week 24 for each of the ixekizumab groups compared with 
the placebo group. The ACR20 response rates at Week 24 (NRI) were 60.0% and 62.4% for the 
ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W and Q2W groups, respectively, and 31.2% for the placebo group.

Persistance of efficacy 
ACR20/50/70 response rates from Weeks 0 through 52 for patients randomised to ixekizumab at Week 
0 are shown in Figure 13. Among patients who achieved an ACR20/50/70 response at Week 24, 
approximately 80% maintained that response at Week 52 for both dosing regimens.

The ACR responses were maintained over time. For ACR20, there were similar responses for 
ixekizumab 80 mgQ2W and 80 mg Q4W. For ACR50 and 70, response rates were numerically higher 
(and at some time points even statistically significantly higher) for ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W.  
For the other major secondary endpoints, sustained therapeutic effect was observed for HAQ-DI and 
PASI75. For the radiographic endpoint mTSS, the change from baseline in mTSS was numerically 
higher in the IXE80Q4W group (mean 0.54) compared to the IXE80Q2W group (Table 16).

2.4.2.3.  Study RHBE (inadequate responders to, or intolerant to, a TNFi) 
Study RHBE was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
outpatient study in patients with active PsA who were cDMARD- and bDMARD-experienced and either 
inadequate responders (have discontinued at least 1 TNFi due to either an inadequate response [based 
on a minimum of 12 weeks on therapy]), or intolerant to, a TNFi. The study was conducted in 109 sites 
across 10 countries. 
Study participants 
The study population included patients aged 18 years or older who were cDMARD-experienced, 
previously treated with at least 1 tumor necrosis factor α inhibitor (TNFi) (discontinued due to 
inadequate response or intolerance), had an established diagnosis of PsA (of at least 6 months and 
currently met the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis), had a least 3/68 tender and 3/66 
swollen joints, and had active psoriatic skin lesions (plaques) or a documented history of plaque 
psoriasis. 
Inclusion criteria 
Male or female patients who were 18 years or older, with an established diagnosis of PsA (of at least 6 
months duration) and currently met the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR) were 
enrolled in the study. Patients were also required to have the following:  
1)  active PsA defined as the presence of at least 3/68 tender and at least 3/66 swollen joints, as 
determined by the Tender and Swollen Joint Count Assessment Form at Visit 1 (Screening) and

2)  prior treatment with 1 or more cDMARDs (MTX, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, or 
hydroxychloroquine)  
3)  prior treatment with at least 1 and not more than 2 TNFi, discontinued due to either an 
inadequate response (based on a minimum of 12 weeks on therapy) or documented 
intolerance

Treatments 
The study design is presented in Figure 10. Patients were randomised to either 
Eligible patients were randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment groups: 
• 
• 
ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W SC 
ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W SC, or 
•  placebo 
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 69/156 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Patients were stratified by country and TNFi experience (inadequate responder [IR] to 1 TNFi, IR to 2 
TNFi, or intolerance to a TNFi). 
Figure 13 RHBE Study Design 
The study consisted of 4 periods:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
Period 1: Screening Period lasting from 4 to 30 days prior to Period 2  
Period 2: Double-Blind Treatment Period from Week 0 (baseline) to Week 24 inclusive.  
Period 3: Extension Period after Week 24 to Week 156   
Period 4: Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period occurring from last treatment period visit or Early 
Termination Visit to a minimum of 12 weeks following that visit. 
Both ixekizumab dosing regimens required a starting dose of 160 mg at baseline. From Week 2, 
patients received the randomised treatment. 
Patients who were incomplete responders (IRs) at Week 16 as defined by blinded TJC and SJC criteria 
received rescue therapy (modification of background treatment). The IRs at Week 16 who had been 
assigned to placebo were also re-randomized (1:1) to either ixekizumab dose regimen at that time. 
Patients who remained on placebo at Week 24 were re-randomized (1:1) to receive ixekizumab 80 mg 
Q2W or 80 mg Q4W, beginning with a starting dose of 160 mg (given as 2 injections). 
After Week 16, dose change or introduction of new cDMARD was allowed. Not more than 1 adjustment 
of DMARDs at 1 time within 12 weeks was recommended. The maximum allowed dose was 25 
mg/week for MTX, 400 mg/day for hydroxychloroquine, 20 mg/day for leflunomide, and 3 g/day for 
sulfasalazine. The maximum corticosteroid dose allowed was 10 mg/day of prednisone or its 
equivalent. Intra-articular injection of max 1 corticosteroid injection within 1 year was recommended.

Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W and 80 mg Q4W versus placebo in the 
treatment of patients with active PsA who are bDMARD-experienced, as measured by the proportion of 
patients achieving ACR20 response at Week 24.  
The major secondary objectives were to compare ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W and 80 mg Q4W versus 
placebo in the treatment of patients with active PsA who were bDMARD-experienced based on the 
following measures:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
change from baseline to Week 24 in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-
DI) scores  
proportion of patients achieving ACR20 response rate at Week 12  
proportion of patients achieving Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index (PASI) 75 response rate 
at Week 12 (restricted to patients with baseline psoriatic lesion involving ≥3% body surface 
area [BSA])  
proportion of patients achieving Coates criteria for Minimum Disease Activity (MDA) at Week 
24 (using LEI [6 entheseal points (E6)] to assess enthesitis) 
proportion of patients achieving complete resolution in enthesitis as assessed by the LEI at 
Week 24 in patients with enthesitis at baseline (LEI >0)  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with ACR20 response at Week 24.  
The major secondary endpoints (multiplicity-corrected) were  
•  Change in HAQ-DI at Week 24 
•  ACR20 at Week 12 
• 
PASI 75 at Week 12 
•  MDA at Week 24 
• 
LEI resolution at Week 24 
Other secondary endpoints are shown in table 8. The endpoints are defined in the methods to study 
RHAP.  
Sample size 
The total planned sample size for the study was 360 patients, 120 patients per arm. Assumptions and 
inputs to determine sample size included a 2-sided Fisher’s exact test at the 0.025 level to maintain an 
overall type I error rate of 0.05 across the two ixekizumab doses. With 120 patients per arm and 
assuming the Week 24 ACR20 response rates of 15% for placebo and 35% for ixekizumab 80 mg 
Q2W, power was approximately 90%. These assumptions were based on the review of historical 
clinical studies in PsA (Mease et al. 2004, 2005, 2011a; Gladman et al. 2005; Kavanaugh et al. 2009). 
Calculations were performed using nQuery + nTerim 2.0 software.  
For Study RHBE, the sample size was estimated taking into account only the primary endpoint (which 
is acceptable). Compared to the assumptions made in Study RHAP, the difference in ACR20 response 
rate between ixekizumab and placebo was assumed to be smaller (i.e. 20% compared to 33%).   
Randomisation

At Week 0 (baseline, Visit 2), patients who met all criteria for enrolment at Visits 1/1A and 2 were 
randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to treatment arms using an interactive web-response system 
(IWRS). Randomisation was stratified by country and TNFi experience (inadequate responder to 1 
TNFi, inadequate responder to 2 TNFi, or intolerance to a TNFi). A patient who was an inadequate 
responder to one TNFi and intolerant to another TNFi was classified as IR to one TNFi.  
Inadequate Responders (IRs) at Week 16 receiving placebo were re-randomised (1:1) to ixekizumab 
80 mg Q2W or 80 mg Q4W and received rescue therapy. The IRs at Week 16 in the ixekizumab groups 
continued receiving ixekizumab to both maintain the blind and allow additional response time in case 
of slow-responders in this group. At Week 24, patients remaining in the placebo treatment group at 
the completion of Period 2 were re-randomised (1:1) to ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W or Q4W. 
Blinding 
This was a double-blind study; patients, investigators, and all other personnel involved in the conduct 
of the study were blinded to individual treatment assignments, including re-randomisations at Week 16 
and Week 24, until all patients completed Week 24 or had discontinued from the study (moved into 
Period 4) and the clinical trial database through Week 24 had been locked.  
There were no events of premature unblinding at the time of the Week 24 database lock. 
Statistical methods 
Unless otherwise specified, the efficacy analyses for the Double-Blind Treatment Period were 
conducted on the Intent to Treat Population (ITT), defined as all randomised patients analysed 
according to the treatment to which they were assigned at Week 0. 
The primary analyses of ACR 20 compared each ixekizumab dose regimen (80 mg Q2W or 80 mg 
Q4W) with placebo using a logistic regression analysis model with treatment, geographic region, and 
TNFi experience (inadequate responder to 1 TNFi, inadequate responder to 2 TNFi, or intolerance to a 
TNFi). The odds ratio, the corresponding 95% CIs and p-value, as well as the treatment differences 
and the corresponding 95% CIs, were reported. Missing data were imputed using non-responder 
imputation (NRI). Sensitivity analyses were performed for the primary analysis using a MMRM model 
for categorical outcomes. The primary analyses were also repeated using the Per Protocol Set (PPS); a 
subset of the ITT Population defined as all randomised patients who were compliant with therapy, who 
did not have significant protocol violations, and whose investigator’s site did not have significant GCP 
issues. For patients eligible for rescue therapy at Week 16 to be included in the PPS, the above 
requirements only applied up to Week 16. 
Multiplicity controlled analyses were performed on the primary and key secondary analyses in order to 
control the overall Type I error rate at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05. The total α was initially split 
equally between the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W and 80 mg Q4W dose regimen and the primary 
hypothesis (ACR20) for these two doses were allocated a type I error of α/2 (of 0.025) implying a 
gatekeeping strategy within each treatment arm. A graphical approach was used. Initially, all the 
primary and secondary endpoints within a dose were tested in a sequential manner. If all the 
hypotheses for a dose regimen were rejected at α/2 (or 0.025 level) then the hypotheses related to 
other dose regimen could be tested at level α (or 0.05 level). There was no adjustment for multiple 
comparisons for other secondary analyses. 
For the analysis of categorical outcome variables besides the primary (e.g. ACR50, ACR70, PASI75, 
PASI 90, PASI 100, sPGA [0,1]), the same logistic regression model was used as was the same non-
responder imputation (NRI) approach for both missing values and for patients receiving rescue

treatment (inadequate responders). The odds ratio, the corresponding 95% CIs and p-value, as well as 
the treatment differences and the corresponding 95% CIs, were reported. Secondary analyses were 
conducted using a Fisher’s exact test.  
The primary analyses for all continuous outcome variables were based on a mixed-effects models for 
repeated measures (MMRM) analysis. Treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy variables were 
also made using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).  
Missing data were handled using a modified baseline-observation-carried-forward approach (mBOCF). 
For patients discontinuing investigational product due to an AE, the baseline observation were carried 
forward to Week 24. For patients discontinuing investigational product for any other reason, the last 
non-missing observation before discontinuation were carried forward, with the exception for patients 
eligible for rescue therapy at Week 16 (Inadequate Responders at Week 16). For inadequate 
responders, the last non-missing observation up to Week 16 was carried forward to the corresponding 
primary endpoint for evaluation. Randomised patients without at least one post-baseline observation 
were to be excluded for evaluation with the exception of patients discontinuing study treatment due to 
an AE. 
As a sensitivity analysis an ANCOVA using LOCF were performed. This approach was identical to the 
mBOCF approach, with one exception: for patients discontinuing investigational product due to an AE, 
the last non-missing post-baseline observation before discontinuation was carried forward to the 
corresponding endpoint for evaluation. For patients eligible for rescue therapy at Week 16, their last 
non-missing observation up to Week 16 were carried forward to the corresponding primary endpoint 
for evaluation. Randomised patients without at least one post-baseline observation were excluded. 
In addition, analyses of major continuous endpoints Week 24 were repeated using MMRM and a 
Placebo Multiple Imputation (pMI) method; pMI assumes that the statistical behavior of drug- and 
placebo- treated patients after discontinuing study medication becomes that of placebo-treated 
patients. 
For time-to analyses, the proportion of patients achieving response was to be presented for each visit 
using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Treatment group comparisons were performed using both an 
unadjusted log-rank test and an adjusted log-rank test stratified by geographic region and TNFi 
experience (inadequate responder to 1 TNFi, inadequate responder to 2 TNFi, or intolerance to a TNFi). 
In addition, Kaplan-Meier plots were to be provided. 
For the primary endpoint, ACR20 response rate at Week 24, pre-defined subgroup analyses were 
conducted for using the ITT Population. 
Safety analyses for Period 2 were conducted on the Safety Population, defined as all randomised 
patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. For those patients classified as inadequate 
responders at Week 16, data after Week 16 were excluded. Patients were to be analysed according to 
the treatment to which they were assigned at Week 0.  
Unblinded interim analyses of safety data were evaluated by an independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC), which consisted of members external to Lilly and study team. The primary database 
lock occurred when all patients completed or discontinued from the Double-Blind Treatment Period 
(Period 2, Week 24). 
Following this database lock the study team was unblinded and the primary analysis performed. 
Unblinding details were to be specified in the unblinding plan.

CHMP comments :  
Considering similar designs and endpoints the statistical analysis plan for Study RHBE shared a number 
of features with the statistical analysis plan for Study RHAP. Same comments are raised below: 
As for Study RHAP, the primary analysis population included all randomised subjects. In all analyses, 
data collected after start of rescue/week 16 were ignored. Although this is an acceptable primary 
approach, sensitivity/supportive analyses including data post-rescue should have been planned as 
discussed within the scientific advice procedure 2011 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/339078/2011). Categorical 
endpoints, including the primary endpoint, were analysed using logistic regression and missing data 
were handled using a non-responder imputation. For the analysis of the primary endpoint (and other 
categorical endpoints) this implied that patients with inadequate response week 16 were treated as 
non-responders.  
Treating patients with completely missing data as non-responders is considered to be an appropriate 
approach, especially considering that the majority of the missing data at week 24 was created by the 
study design and was those patients with an inadequate response at week 16. 
Unlike in study RHAP it was not specified that LOCF would be used for patients with partially missing 
data for a visit.  
For continuous endpoints the primary analysis approach was MMRM. Considering the missing at 
random assumption, the planning and performing of sensitivity/supportive analyses is endorsed.  
Sensitivity analyses for major categorical endpoints included categorical MMRM and logistic regression 
using placebo Multiple Imputation (pMI). Sensitivity analysis for continuous endpoints included 
ANCOVA using a modified baseline-observation-carried-forward (mBOCF) approach and last-
observation-carried-forward (LOCF) respectively as well as MMRM using pMI. The mBOCF implied that 
the baseline observation was carried forward only for patients discontinuing study treatment due to an 
AE, for other reasons, the last non-missing observation before discontinuation were carried forward. In 
all cases except treatment discontinuation due to an AE, a post-baseline observation was used for 
imputation. The difference between analyses using mBOCF and analyses using LOCF may hence be 
small. 
For primary and key secondary analyses, multiplicity was appropriately handled through the use of a 
graphical approach implying a gatekeeping strategy within each treatment arm. To handle the two 
pairwise comparisons α was initially split equally between the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W and 80 mg Q4W 
dose regimen and the primary hypothesis (ACR20) for these two doses tested at α/2 (of 0.025). 
Regarding the definition of the Safety Population, patients were to be analysed according to the 
treatment to which they were assigned at Week 0. Generally, and more appropriate, patients should 
be analysed according to the actual treatment received. During the double-blind period all patients 
seemingly received the correct assigned treatment; treatment errors did however occur during the 
long-term extension. 
The interim database lock to perform the primary analysis was pre-defined to occur once all patients 
had completed or discontinued in the Double-Blind Treatment Period (Week 24). SAP Version 1 was 
approved prior to unblinding the unblinded team for the first data monitoring committee (DMC).  
Participant flow 
A total of 474 patients entered the study. Prior to randomization at Week 0, 111 patients discontinued 
from the study. In total, 363 patients were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups as the ITT

Population: 122 to ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W, 123 to ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W, 118 to placebo. A total of 
86.5% of randomized patients completed the Double-Blind Treatment Period. Figure 14 summarizes 
patient disposition from study drug (trial entry through the end of the Double-Blind Treatment Period) 
for the ITT Population. A total of 64 patients in the ITT Population were classified as IRs at Week 16.  
Figure 14.  Patient disposition from study treatment during the Double-Blind Treatment 
Period for the Intent-to-Treat Population 
The main reason for discontinuation was lack of efficacy, which was more frequent in the placebo 
group. Slightly higher proportion of patients in the IXE 80 mg Q2W group than in the other groups 
discontinued due to adverse events (5.7 % vs 4.2 % in placebo). There was a higher proportion of 
inadequate responders in the placebo group (27.1%) than in the IXEQ4W (12.3 %) and IXEQ2W (13.8 
%) groups (Table 17).

Reasons for discontinuation from study drug for the ITT Population during the Double-Blind Treatment 
Period were similar across treatment groups. The most common reasons for study drug discontinuation 
among patients in the placebo group were lack of efficacy, withdrawal by subject, and AE. For the total 
ixekizumab group, the most common reasons for study drug discontinuation were AE, lack of efficacy, 
and withdrawal by subject.

Overall baseline characteristics were balanced between the groups, with some exceptions. The disease 
duration was significantly longer in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W group (11.4 years) compared with the 
placebo group (9.2 years). The baseline SJC was different between groups, with each ixekizumab 
group having a higher count (mean Q4W, 13.1; Q2W, 13.5) compared with the placebo group (10.3). 
The incidence of dactylitis was different between groups, with the ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W group 
having a greater incidence (31.1%) compared with the placebo group (16.9%). The use of MTX was 
different between groups, with greater proportions of patients in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group 
using MTX at baseline (49.6%) compared with the placebo group (33.9%). 
Similar to the study population in RHAP, the majority had a polyarticular course disease (83.7 %), with 
a minor proportion of patients with assymetrical oligoarthritis (9.9 %) and spondylitis (2.2 %).

As in study RHAP, the majority of the patients on cDMARD therapy was on MTX. Only a minority was 
treated with other cDMARDs, for example sulfasalazine or leflunomide. This was a major objection in 
the first RSI. The MAH has now presented further information, which is not regarded sufficient to 
justify the broad indication requested by the MAH.  (see discussion later in the report)  
Numbers analysed 
In total, 363 patients were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups as the ITT Population: 122 to 
ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W, 123 to ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W, 118 to Placebo. Unless otherwise specified, 
the efficacy and health outcome endpoints were conducted on the ITT Population. The primary 
endpoint analysis of ACR20 response rate at Week 24 was repeated using the PPS. Selected efficacy 
and health outcome analyses were also conducted on the IR Population.  
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary efficacy endpoint, the percentage of patients achieving ACR20 response at Week 24 in the 
ITT population, is shown in Table 20 and Figure 15.

Figure 15.  ACR20/50/70 response rates at each postbaseline visit (NRI), Intent-to-Treat 
Population, Double-Blind Treatment Period 
CHMP's comment: 
The primary endpoint of the study was met. A larger proportion of patients in both ixekizumab groups 
reached ACR 20 response at Week 24 (48.0 % in the Ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group and 53.3% in the 
Ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W group, compared to 19.5% in the placebo group. 
The proportion of patients classified as Inadequate Responders in each of the ixekizumab groups were 
smaller (Q4W, 15 patients [12.3%]; Q2W, 17 patients [13.8%]) compared with the placebo group (32 
patients [27.1%]). This is considered to support the efficacy of ixekizumab. In the primary analysis 
data collected post-rescue were ignored and patients with inadequate response week 16 were treated 
as non-responders. This is acceptable. However, although recognised as being conservative, the 
company was requested to repeat the analysis of the primary endpoint including all data collected up 
to week 24 irrespective of whether a patient received rescue. In the submitted analysis where 
observed data after Week 16 for Week 16 inadequate responders was included, the difference in 
ACR20 response rate at Week 24 between IXE80Q4W and IXE80Q2W respectively and placebo was 
smaller tha in the primary analysis, due to a higher placebo response rate. The difference between 
treatment arms were however still statistically significant irrespective of comparison.

For the key secondary (multiplicity-adjusted) endpoints, the response to ixekizumab in both doses was 
different from placebo for the following endpoints: HAQ-DI at Week 24, ACR20 at Week 12, PASI75 at 
Week 12 and MDA at Week 24. There were no difference in number of patients achieving LEI score = 0 
at Week 24. Results are shown in Table 21.

CHMP's comment: 
There was a difference in response for both ixekizumab groups vs placebo for the following key 
secondary endpoints: HAQ-DI at Week 24, ACR20 at Week 12, PASI75 at Week 12 and MDA at Week 
24. There was no difference in treatment effect on enthesitis, measured as proportion of patients with 
LEI=0 at Week 24.  
Immunogenicity effects on efficacy 
In Primary PsA Placebo-Controlled Integrated Analysis Set (Studies RHAP and RHBE), of the patients 
receiving ixekizumab at the recommended dosing regimen (80 mg Q4W), 14 patients developed 
Treatment-Emergent Anti-Drug Antibodies (TE-ADA).  The majority were classified as TE-ADA of low 
titer (10 out of 14 patients) and no patient was classified as TE-ADA high titer. Two of the 14 patients 
had confirmed neutralizing antibodies. 
Of the 14 patients classified as TE-ADA positive, 12 patients achieved ACR20 at week 24 (Table 22). Of 
the 2 patients that were classified as neutralizing antibody (Nab) positive, both achieved ACR20.  
Seven of the 8 patients classified as NAb inconclusive achieved ACR20. Of the 26 patients considered 
to be inadequate responders to ixekizumab Q4W at Week 16, only 1 patient was TE-ADA positive at 
least once (NAb negative, low titer).

CHMP's comment: 
In summary, an assessment of ACR20 responses at Week 24 among ADA positive patients did not 
demonstrate any significant impact of ADA on efficacy, irrespective of titer or neutralizing antibody 
activity. 
Efficacy in subpopulations 
The efficacy of ixekizumab was analysed in the following subgroups: demographics (sex, age, weight, 
BMI, race, ethnicity, geographic region), disease characteristics (CRP, time since PsA onset, time since 
PsA diagnosis, baseline enthesitis, baseline dactylitis), previous therapy (cDMARD use at baseline, 
methotrexate use at baseline) and other characteristics (smoking, baseline psoriasis, baseline 
moderate-to-severe psoriasis). The ACR20 response was higher for ixekizumab 80Q4W compared to 
placebo for all subgroups except for patients with weight <25th percentile. ACR20 response rates for 
ixekizumab 80Q2W was higher compared to placebo in all groups except patients with weight ≥ 100 kg 
and patients with disease duration <5 years. 
In PsA patients with a high level of skin involvement (BSA≥10%) and those defined as having 
concomitant moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, the PASI90 response rate was higher for ixekizumab 
80 mg Q2W than for ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W (Table 23).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The development program to support the variation for Taltz in psoriatic arthritis includes two pivotal 
phase III studies (RHAP and RHBE). Efficacy data up to Week 52 (RHAP) and Week 24 (RHBE) have 
been provided.  
Recommendations of the EMA clinical guidance for psoriatic arthritis (Guideline on clinical investigation 
of medicinal products indicated for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, CHMP/EWP/438/04) have been 
taken  into  account  in  the  clinical  development  programme.  Advice  was  sought  from  CHMP 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/339078/2011),  and  in  line  with  this  an  active  comparator  (adalimumab)  was 
added. According to the Applicant, all studies were conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP). 
The dosing regimen in phase III studies were based dose-ranging data from phase II studies in 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA, study RHAK) and psoriasis (study RHAJ), as well as the final dosing regimen 
selection for the pivotal phase III studies in  moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The doses selected 
for the phase III program were ixekizumab 160 mg as a loading dose, followed by 80 mg Q2W or 
Q4W. 
The study population in phase III studies consisted of adults with active PsA. They fulfilled the CASPAR 
diagnostic criteria for PsA and the disease activity was based on at least 3 tender and swollen joints in 
66/68 joint index. The population is comparable to other phase III programs on biologics developed for 
PsA, for example Cosentyx. In study RHAP, aiming to evaluate radiographic progression, patients also 
needed to have ≥1 disease-related definite joint erosion on hand or foot radiographs OR CRP >6 mg/L 
at  screening.  In  study  RHAP,  patients  could  be  either  cDMARD-naïve  or  cDMARD-experienced.  All 
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 93/156 
 
  
  
patients  were  bDMARD-naïve.  In  study  RHAP,  all  patients  were  bDMARD-experienced.  Primary 
endpoint in both studies was ACR20 at Week 24.  
Study RHAP was a phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, outpatient study in patients with active PsA who were bDMARD-naive. Patients were 
randomised to treatment with ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W, ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W, adalimumab (Humira) 
40 mg Q2W or placebo. The efficacy variables chosen are relevant and cover the diverse disease 
manifestations of PsA.  
Study RHBE was a phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group, outpatient study in patients with active PsA who were cDMARD- and bDMARD-experienced and 
either inadequate responders (have discontinued at least 1 TNFi due to either an inadequate response 
[based on a minimum of 12 weeks on therapy]), or intolerant to, a TNFi (8.5% of the study 
population). Patients were randomised to treatment with ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W, ixekizumab 80 mg 
Q4W or placebo. In this study, no active comparator was included. 
In Study RHAP, the sample size was seemingly determined to provide sufficient power to show a 
difference (versus placebo) with regard to the major secondary mTSS endpoint. For the primary 
analyses the power was >99% implying a high power also in the subpopulation of cDMARD-
experienced patients since expected to comprise approximately 75% of the total sample size. For this 
subset a number of analyses, besides analyses of the primary endpoint, were pre-planned. For Study 
RHBE, the sample size estimation was based on the primary endpoint. Compared to the assumptions 
made in Study RHAP, the difference in ACR20 response rate between ixekizumab and placebo was 
assumed to be smaller; 20% compared to 33%. In both studies the Week 24 ACR20 response rate for 
placebo was assumed to be 15%. 
Considering similar designs and endpoints the statistical analysis plan for Study RHAP and Study RHBE 
shared a number of features and were overall acceptable. Analyses were based on all randomised 
subjects and analysis models included the stratifications variables used at randomisation. Multiplicity 
concerns were appropriately handled through the use of a split of α between the two ixekizumab dose 
regimens and gatekeeping using a graphical approach. Categorical endpoints, including the primary 
endpoint, were analysed using logistic regression with missing data handled using a non-responder 
imputation. In all analyses, data collected after start of rescue/week 16 were ignored. For the analysis 
of the primary endpoint (and other categorical endpoints) this implied that patients with inadequate 
response week 16 were treated as non-responders. Although this is an acceptable primary approach, 
sensitivity/supportive analyses including data post-rescue should have been planned (as also discussed 
within the scientific advice procedure 2011; EMA/CHMP/SAWP/339078/2011) and they were requested 
during the assessment. In both the studies, the primary analysis was performed after an interim 
database lock pre-defined to occur once all patients had completed or discontinued in the Double-Blind 
Treatment Period (Week 24). Following this database lock the study team was unblinded with 
unblinding details specified in the unblinding plan. For Study RHAP, a number of post hoc analyses 
were performed after database lock and unblinding including a sensitivity analysis on ACR20 response 
rates at Week 24 based on the PPS and excluding all patients from one site, which was closed for 
persistent GCP noncompliance. Considered to be for check of robustness or for clarifying/exploratory 
purposes, no concern is raised. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In Study RHAP, 417 subjects were randomised to each of the 4 treatment groups (ixekizumab 80 mg 
Q2W, ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W, adalimumab 40 mg Q2W or placebo). All ixekizumab-treated patients 
received a starting dose of 160 mg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 94/156 
 
  
  
The primary efficacy endpoint was achieved as ixekizumab at both 80 mg Q2W and Q4W were superior 
to placebo for ACR20 response at Week 24 (p<0.001). The ACR20 response rates at Week 24 were 
62.1% for ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W, 57.9% for ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W, 57.4% for adalimumab and 
30.2% for placebo. Superior ACR20 response rates compared to placebo were seen already at Week 1, 
and response rates were maintained over time. The difference vs placebo was 31.9% for ixekizumab 
80 mg Q2W, 27.8% for ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W and 27.2% for adalimumab. 
The proportion of patients classified as Inadequate Responders at week 16 in each of the ixekizumab 
groups were smaller than in the placebo group; 10.3% (11/107) and 9.7% (10/103) for the Q4W and 
Q2W arm respectively compared to 25.5% (27/106) in the placebo group. This difference between 
active treatment and placebo is considered to support the efficacy of ixekizumab. In the primary 
analysis data collected post-rescue were ignored and patients with inadequate response week 16 were 
treated as non-responders. This is acceptable. However, although recognised as being conservative, 
the MAH was requested to repeat the analysis of the primary endpoint taking all data collected up to 
week 24 into account irrespective of whether a patient received rescue or not. In this analysis, where 
observed data after Week 16 for Week 16 inadequate responders was included, the difference in 
ACR20 response rate at Week 24 between IXE80Q4W and IXE80Q2W respectively and placebo was 
smaller than in the primary analysis, due to a higher placebo response rate. The difference between 
treatment arms was however still statistically significant irrespective of comparison. 
Both dosing regimens of ixekizumab were superior to placebo for the secondary endpoints mTSS at 
Week 24, HAQ-DI at Week 24, ACR20 at Week 12 and PASI 75 at Week 12. No statistically significant 
response was shown for the secondary endpoints LEI score at Week 12 or Itch NRS at Week 12, for 
either ixekizumab dose compared to placebo.  
Regarding the inhibition of radiographic progression, it is difficult to draw safe conclusions since the 
follow-up time is very short. From a clinical perspective, data on mTSS at Week 52 are more relevant 
and some concern is raised on the results from this analysis. Patients in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W 
had a larger mTSS change from baseline compared to patients initially randomised to placebo or 
adalimumab (both switched to ixekizumab at Week 16 or 24). The applicant justifies this with the fact 
that the progression per se was low, and mainly driven by one patient. This may be true and will be 
verified when data from the long-term extension( 108 Weeks) are submitted. These studies are 
included in the RMP as category 3 studies. 
Study RHAP included efficacy analyses in the subset of patients who were cDMARD-experienced. A 
majority of these were on concomitant therapy with MTX and only a minority on other DMARDs. Both 
ixekizumab doses were superior to placebo for the primary endpoint ACR20 at Week 24 and for the 
major secondary endpoints HAQ-DI, mTSS, ACR20 (at Week 12), PASI 75, and Itch NRS. The efficacy 
in the subgroups treated with DMARDs other than MTX has not been sufficiently justified and  the 
indication has been revised to include combination therapy with MTX only.  
In Study RHBE, 363 subjects were randomised to each of the 3 treatment groups (ixekizumab 80 mg 
Q2W, ixekizumab Q4W or placebo). Baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced between 
the groups. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was achieved as ixekizumab at both dosing regimens were superior to 
placebo for ACR20 response at Week 24 (p<0.001). The ACR20 response rates at Week 24 were 
48.0% for ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W, 53.3% for ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W and 19.5% for placebo. 
Superior ACR20 response rates compared to placebo were seen already at Week 2 for ixekizumab 80 
mg Q4W and continued to improve until a plateau was reached around Week 8. The difference vs 
placebo was 28.5% for ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W and 33.8% for ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W. It is noted that 
the lower dose has higher response rates. 
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 95/156 
 
  
  
A majority of the patients were on concomitant therapy with MTX and only a minority on other 
cDMARDs. The efficacy in the subgroups treated with cDMARDs other than MTX has not been 
sufficiently justified . The restricted revised indication described hereafter is acceptable and reflects the 
scientific data submitted.   
Here the proportion of Inadequate Responders at week 16 were 12.3% (15/122) and 13.8% (17/123) 
for the Q4W and Q2W arm respectively compared with 27.1% (32/118) in the placebo group, i.e. of 
similar magnitude although slightly higher in Study RHBE than in Study RHAP. As concluded above, 
this difference between active treatment and placebo, evident in both studies, is considered to support 
the efficacy of ixekizumab. The MAH was however, analogous as for Study RHAP, requested to repeat 
the analysis of the primary endpoint taking all data collected up to week 24 into account irrespective of 
whether a patient received rescue or not. In the  submitted analysis, in which observed data after 
Week 16 for Week 16 inadequate responders was included, the difference in ACR20 response rate at 
Week 24 between IXE80Q4W and IXE80Q2W respectively and placebo was, as could be expected, 
smaller than in the primary analysis, due to a higher placebo response rate. The difference between 
treatment arms were however still statistically significant irrespective of comparison.   
Both dosing regimens of ixekizumab were superior to placebo for the secondary endpoints HAQ-DI at 
Week 24, ACR20 at Week 12, PASI 75 at Week 12 and MDA at Week 24. No difference was shown in 
proportion of patients achieving remission of enthesitis defined by LEI score=0 at Week 24, compared 
to placebo.  
The extension period of RHBE is ongoing, and the Week 52 data are anticipated to become available in 
August 2017. The data will be submitted post approval. This is agreed by CHMP. 
The efficacy of ixekizumab was analysed in the following subgroups: demographics (sex, age, weight, 
BMI, race, ethnicity, geographic region), disease characteristics (CRP, time since PsA onset, time since 
PsA diagnosis, baseline enthesitis, baseline dactylitis), previous therapy (cDMARD use at baseline, 
methotrexate use at baseline) and other characteristics (smoking, baseline psoriasis, baseline 
moderate-to-severe psoriasis). For ACR20, ixekizumab 80Q4W was superior to placebo for all 
subgroups except for patients with weight <25th percentile. Ixekizumab 80Q2W was superior to 
placebo in all groups except patients with weight ≥ 100 kg and patients with disease duration <5 
years. 
In addition to the studies described above, a third phase III study (RHBF) is ongoing. It was designed 
to address CHMP scientific advice recommendation of employing a randomised-withdrawal design to 
further evaluate maintenance of efficacy. RHBF is a Phase III, multicentre study with a 36-week, 
initial, open-label treatment period, examining the effect of ixekizumab 80 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) in 
patients with active PsA who are inadequate responders (IRs) to cDMARDs and are bDMARD-naive, 
followed by a randomised, doubleblind withdrawal period from Week 36 to Week 104, examining the 
effect of ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W compared to placebo. The primary objective of the study is to 
compare ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W with placebo in the maintenance of treatment response, as measured 
by the time to relapse during the randomised, double-blind withdrawal period.  
2.4.1.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Both phase III studies met their primary endpoint. ACR20 response rates with both ixekizumab doses 
were statistically significantly higher compared to placebo at Week 24. In the bDMARD-naive 
population, the proportion of patients achieving the primary endpoint ACR20 response at Week 24 was 
similar to the response for adalimumab.

The wording of the indication as initially proposed by the MAH, “Taltz, alone or in combination with a 
conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (cDMARD), is indicated for the treatment of active 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adult patients who have responded inadequately to or who are intolerant to 
one or more DMARD therapies”, could not be sufficiently justified. The majority of the patients in the 
studies were treated with MTX, and only a minority with other cDMARDs such as sulfasalazine. Further 
studies are needed to justify the proposed wording. Taking this into consideration the wording of the 
indication has been revised as recommended by CHMP as follows :  “Taltz, alone or in combination with 
methotrexate, is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adult patients who 
have responded inadequately to or who are intolerant to one or more DMARD therapies”.  
There were no significant differences in treatment response between the two posologies for the pre-
specified endpoints. Data from the psoriasis phase III program for patients with moderate-to-severe 
plaque psoriasis indicated that following a 160 mg starting dose, a dosing regimen of ixekizumab 80 
mg Q2W provided greater efficacy at Week 12 for the skin endpoints of PASI 75/90/100 and sPGA 
(0,1)/(0), when compared to a dosing regimen of ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W. The dose approved for skin 
psoriasis is 160 mg at Week 0, followed by 80 mg at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, then 80 mg Q4W.  
As such PsA patients with coexistent moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis should receive the dose 
approved for skin psoriasis.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Taltz (ixekizumab) solution for injection 80 mg is currently indicated for the treatment of moderate to 
severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. The recommended dose is 
160 mg by SC injection (two 80 mg injections) at Week 0, followed by 80 mg at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 
and 12, then maintenance dosing of 80 mg (one injection) every 4 weeks. In the pivotal studies for the 
plaque psoriasis indication, the most common AEs following 12 weeks treatment with ixekizumab were 
infections (nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection), injection site reactions and headache. 
The most frequent injection site reactions observed were erythema and pain. These reactions were 
predominantly mild to moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation of treatment. 
Opportunistic infections were also observed, mainly candida infections. The long term safety of 
ixekizumab, evaluated following 48 weeks of treatment, was mainly similar to the 12 week induction 
period (though the exposure-adjusted incidence rate of TEAEs was somewhat lower in the Maintenance 
Dosing Period than in the Induction). There is a possible association between systemic IL-17A blockade 
and reduction in peripheral neutrophil counts. Approximately 9% of psoriasis patients receiving Taltz 
developed neutropenia. Thrombocytopenia has also been observed. In most cases, this did not require 
discontinuation of treatment. 
Based on the biological target of ixekizumab important safety concerns such as infections, serious 
hypersensitivity and inflammatory bowel disease have been identified. Treatment during clinically 
important active infections (e.g. active TB) has been contraindicated and a warning of late (10-14 days 
following injection) hypersensitivity reactions with urticaria, dyspnea and high antibody titers is stated 
in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Furthermore, identified (infections, neutropenia, hypersensitivity) and 
potential risks (IBD, MACE, malignancies) are being followed as safety concerns in the RMP. 
The applied for posology for the PsA indication is 160 mg by subcutaneous injection (two 80 mg 
injections) at Week 0, followed by 80 mg (one injection) every 4 weeks thereafter. For psoriatic 
arthritis patients with concomitant moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, the recommended dosing 
regimen is the same as for plaque psoriasis. Thus, based on the applied for dosing regimen for the PsA 
Assessment report

indication, the level of exposure to ixekizumab will not exceed that for the approved plaque psoriasis 
indication. 
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
There are 2 pivotal studies for the PsA indication, studies I1F-MC-RHAP (RHAP) (active and placebo 
controlled) and RHBE (placebo controlled). In addition, supportive safety data in PsA is provided by 1 
ongoing double-blind, randomized withdrawal study, preceded by an Open-Label Period, in patients 
with active PsA who have had inadequate response to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic 
drugs (cDMARD-IR) and are bDMARD-naive (I1F-MC-RHBF [RHBF]). The following integrated datasets 
were submitted to support the safety for the current application: 
• 
The Primary PsA Placebo-Controlled Integrated Analysis Set (N=678) “Primary PsA Analysis Set” 
comprised data from patients from the pivotal studies RHAP and RHBE. The primary analysis was 
conducted using data from the Double-Blind Treatment Period (Weeks 0 to 24) but excluding 
observed data after Week 16 through Week 24 for patients classified as Week 16 Inadequate 
Responders (IRs) in order to avoid confounding the data.  
This set includes 454 ixekizumab and 224 placebo patients. Of note, study RHAP also included an 
additional active reference arm of treatment with adalimumab (n= 101). IRs were rescued with 
standard of care therapies and, if receiving adalimumab or placebo, were re-randomized to 
ixekizumab. Supplementary analyses were performed that included all patients for (1) Weeks 0 to 16 
(i.e. prior to rescue therapy), and (2) Weeks 0 to 24 including the observed data after Week 16 
through Week 24 from the Week 16 Inadequate Responders (IRs). 
• 
• 
The All PsA Ixekizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set (N=1118) “All PsA Analysis Set” was a 
larger analysis set comprising data from ixekizumab-treated patients from all treatment periods of 
studies RHAP and RHBE and from the Open-Label Treatment Period of Study RHBF. The primary 
analysis of this set used all data after Week 0, that is, through the patient last visit before 
database lock. (A supplementary analysis was conducted using data from Weeks 0 to 52.) 
The All Psoriasis Ixekizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set (N=5689) “All Psoriasis Analysis 
Set” with data from ixekizumab-treated patients in all treatment periods of 11 completed or 
ongoing studies in psoriasis, as of the September 2016 data cutoff date. 
The safety population was defined as all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of their 
assigned study treatment.  A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an event that 
first occurred or worsened in severity after baseline and on or before the date of the last visit within 
the treatment period. The presentation of clinical safety in this AR will mainly focus on the first 2 
datasets in PsA patients. Data from the psoriasis population will be also presented, however, given the 
overlap between the patient populations.  
Overall, the approach for the presentation of the safety data is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The data cutoff date for the safety data was 15 Sep 2016 for all studies, with the following exceptions: 
30 Sep 2016 for Study I1F-MC-RHBE (RHBE) (PsA), 23 Sep 2016 for Study I1F-EW-RHBZ (RHBZ) 
(psoriasis), and 22 Sep 2016 for Study I1F-JE-RHAT (RHAT) (psoriasis). 
2.5.1.  Patient exposure 
Patient exposure in each of the primary safety data sets for ixekizumab PsA studies is summarized 
below. In the ixekizumab clinical development program, 1118 patients with active PsA have received at 
least 1 dose of ixekizumab, representing 1050.6 patients-years of exposure.  
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 98/156 
 
  
  
Table 26: Extent and Duration of Study Drug Exposure - Psoriatic Arthritis Studies 
In addition, 5689 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis have received at least 1 dose of 
ixekizumab cumulatively, representing 12061.5 patient-years of exposure cumulatively, or 7331.8 
additional patient-years of exposure (155% increase) since the time of the MAA for the plaque 
psoriasis indication (see table below). Overall, across therapeutic indications (including RA for which 
development was stopped), 7339 patients have been exposed to ixekizumab (13645.6 patient-years). 
Table 27: Extent and Duration of Study Drug Exposure - Current and Ongoing Psoriasis 
Studies 
•  Co-morbidities and previous/concomitant medications 
In the Primary PsA Analysis Set, of patients in the total ixekizumab group and the placebo group, 
45.6% and 47.3%, respectively, had at least 1 pre-existing condition at baseline.  The most frequent 
in the total ixekizumab group were psoriasis (43.0%), nail psoriasis (31.5%), tendonitis (28.4%), 
dactylitis (20.7%), and hypertension (16.1%). At baseline, 0.2% to 25.8% of patients in the total 
ixekizumab group were reported with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus (type 2), 
coronary artery disease, stroke, or dyslipidemia; no patients had a history of diabetes mellitus (type 
1).  In the placebo group, 0.9% to 25.0% of patients had a history of hypertension, coronary artery 
disease, or dyslipidemia; no patients had a history of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2) or stroke.  
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 99/156 
 
 
 
  
  
At baseline, 54.2% of patients in the total ixekizumab and 52.7% in the placebo group had used 
biologic therapy for PsA (were biologic-experienced), whereas 15.6% of patients in the total 
ixekizumab and 17.0% in the placebo group were naive to systemic PsA therapies (e.g., cDMARDs, 
bDMARDs, and other systemic therapies, such as NSAIDs, analgesics, corticosteroids).  
In the total ixekizumab and placebo groups, 62.8% and 62.5% of patients, respectively, received at 
least 1 concomitant medication; at baseline, 48.1% of patients in the total ixekizumab and 44.2% of 
patients in the placebo group were current users of methotrexate (ITT Population) and 58.0% of 
ixekizumab and 54.0% of placebo patients had current use of cDMARDs (including methotrexate, 
methotrexate sodium, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, ciclosporin, hydroxychloroquine, and 
hydroxychloroquine sulfate). 
Regarding baseline characteristics in the All PsA Analysis Set, these were generally comparable to the 
Primary PsA Analysis Set. However, a greater proportion of ixekizumab-treated patients in the Primary 
PsA Analysis Set (54.2%) had previous biologic therapy experience compared to the All PsA Analysis 
Set (30.2%). This is due to the inclusion of data from study RHBF in the All PsA Analysis Set, which is 
an ongoing study in patients with active PsA with inadequate response to conventional disease-
modifying antirheumatic drugs and who are bDMARD-naive.  
• 
Patient Disposition and Reasons for Discontinuation 
In the Primary PsA Analysis Set, 71.1% of all patients completed the Double-Blind Treatment Period; 
16.5% of patients completed the Double-Blind Treatment Period but were classified as IRs. 
Approximately 12% of patients discontinued treatment early for any reason.  Overall, 78.9% of 
ixekizumab (IXE) patients and 55.4% of placebo patients completed the Double-Blind Treatment 
Period and 4.2% of IXE patients and 3.6% of placebo patients, respectively, discontinued due to an 
AE. Compared with either ixekizumab treatment group, a greater percentage of patients in the placebo 
group discontinued treatment, primarily due to lack of efficacy and subject decision. In the IXE 80 mg 
Q2W group, 5.3% of patients discontinued due to an AE as compared to 3.1% of patients in the Q4W 
group. 
In the All PsA and the All Psoriasis Analysis Sets, 64 (5.7%) patients and 379 (6.7%) patients, 
respectively, discontinued from the studies because of an AE. 
Common adverse events 
Primary PsA Analysis Set 
A summary of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) in the Primary PsA Analysis Set is provided below.

Table 28: Overview of TEAEs - Double-Blind Treatment Period (Weeks 0 to 24) 
Primary PsA Placebo-Controlled Integrated Analysis Set 
Patients in the ixekizumab group reported TEAEs more frequently compared to placebo (68.1% vs. 
56.7%). Somewhat more patients in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group had one or more severe TEAEs 
(6.2%) compared to the 80 mg Q4W group (3.5%).  
A summary of all TEAEs by SOC and by PT is presented in the tables below.

Table 30: TEAEs by PT (≥1% of Pts in Total IXE group) - Double-Blind Treatment Period 
(Weeks 0 to 24) Primary PsA Placebo-Controlled Integrated Analysis Set 
There were significantly higher incidences of patients with Injection site reaction and Injection site 
erythema in the total ixekizumab group as well as for the separate dose groups, as compared with 
placebo. There were numerically higher percentages of patients with these TEAEs in the ixekizumab 80 
mg Q2W as compared with the Q4W group. Also, compared with placebo, there were significantly 
higher incidences of patients with Injection site hypersensitivity and Injection site pruritus for the 
ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group, but not for the Q4W group. Compared with placebo, the incidence of 
oral candidiasis, rhinitis and tonsillitis was higher in patients treated with ixekizumab.    
The profile of most common AEs is consistent with those observed in the plaque psoriasis MAA.

In the active controlled study RHAP, the pattern of most frequent TEAEs in adalimumab-treated 
patients included Nasopharyngitis and Upper respiratory tract infection, similarly to ixekizumab, 
whereas the frequency of injection site reactions was lower. To illustrate the comparative AE profile, a 
summary of most frequent TEAEs displayed by study is provided in the table below.

A summary of exposure-adjusted IRs of TEAEs by SOC has also been provided. Similarly, these data 
did not indicate an increase in the exposure-adjusted IR over time, e.g. for the Infections and 
infestations SOC. It should be considered that the majority of the data is still limited to the first 24-36 
weeks of treatment. However, the Applicant also provided the frequencies and exposure-adjusted IRs 
within 12-week time periods through 156 weeks of treatment for the All Psoriasis Analysis Set, which 
also illustrated that the reported rate of TEAEs, by SOC did not increase over time, during longer 
exposures to ixekizumab. In this data set, at Weeks 144-156, 2275 patients of the total of 5689 
psoriasis patients were still included. 
All Psoriasis Analysis Set 
Overall, the most frequently reported TEAEs were consistent with the established safety profile of 
ixekizumab, taking into consideration the longer period of patient follow-up represented in this 
updated analysis set. Very common TEAEs (≥10%) in this analysis set were Nasopharyngitis and 
Upper respiratory tract infection. 
Also, individual terms most frequently reported in this updated psoriasis analysis set are comparable to 
those most frequently reported in the All PsA Analysis Set. To illustrate this, the table below 
summarizes clusters (of AEs of interest) and PTs within clusters reported for at least 1% of patients in

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In total, there were 25 deaths in the studies of PsA and psoriasis, of which 2 occurred in studies of 
patients with PsA and 23 in studies of patients with psoriasis (of which 8 were previously reported in 
the plaque psoriasis MAA).  
According to the narrative, the patient's medical history included hypertension from 2012 and transient 
ischaemic attack (TIA) in 04-2013. Concomitant medication included amlodipine besilate, methyldopa, 
perindopril arginine, rilmenidine, indapamide and doxazosin for hypertension, metformin and gliclazide 
for diabetes mellitus, rosuvastatin for dyslipidemia and caffeine, paracetamol and leflunomide for 
psoriasis arthritis. The patient had been hospitalized for approximately 2 weeks prior to the death due 
to a stroke that resulted in left-sided hemiplegia. The death was considered not related to blinded 
therapy by the investigator. This can be agreed by CHMP based on the patient’s medical history, which 
included a previous TIA.  
The second cases refers to patient who received ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W died due to pneumonia, onset 
after 19 days of treatment.  The narrative states that the patient had started the initial open-label 
treatment period of study RHBF, (which included a 160 mg ixekizumab start dose followed by 80 mg 
Q2W). Five days after receiving the second dose, the patient experienced high fever with sweating, 
chills, dyspnea, fatigue, weakness, anorexia and productive cough. Apparently the patient was not 
hospitalized for this event but diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia and treated at home by 
a physician with cefotaxime, salmeterol, budesonide, and oxygen support. No additional diagnostic 
testing was performed. The patient failed to show improvement and died 2days later at home as a 
result of this event. An autopsy was not performed. The cause of death was considered to be 
pneumonia.  
The patient’s medical history was not remarkable for prior conditions in terms of pulmonary or 
cardiovascular disease. No history of alcohol abuse. Treatments received for treatment of psoriatic 
arthritis prior to start study drug were: cyclosporine, loratadine and diclofenac. Concomitant 
medications included: amitriptyline for depression. The narrative indicates that the patient was in poor 
‘general health’ which may have facilitated development of pneumonia and fatal outcome. However, a 
causal relationship to ixekizumab cannot be excluded. The investigator considered the event as related 
to study drug.  
A cumulative listing of all deaths is provided in the table below.

Most of these new deaths (updated from the plaque psoriasis MAA) pertain to cardiovascular events as 
the cause of death or presumed (but unconfirmed) cardiovascular events based on medical history. All 
of these patients had relevant medical and/or medication history for cardiovascular disease, such as 
hypertension, obesity, diabetes, angina, etc. Three new deaths were related to malignancy, one 
patient due to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and one patient  due to metastatic lung cancer. In 
addition, another patient was reported in the narrative to have died from lung cancer (as reported by 
relatives but unconfirmed). In most cases, the deaths were not considered related to ixekizumab by 
the investigator. It can be agreed that no new safety concerns were evoked by the reported cases. 
A summary of all SAEs (including death) for the Primary PsA Analysis Set is provided in the table 
below. 
Twenty patients in the total ixekizumab group (4.4%) and 6 patients in the placebo group (2.7%) were 
reported to have ≥1 SAE. No individual PT was reported for more than 1 patient.  Among the SOCs, 
the Infections and infestations SOC had the greatest incidence of SAEs.  This was the only SOC for 
which there was a statistical difference between an ixekizumab group (the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W 
group) compared with the placebo group (5 patients in the Q2W group versus 0 in the placebo group; 
p=.026).

Overall, 4.4% of patients in the total IXE group reported one or more SAEs and 2.2% had SAEs in the 
SOC Infections and infestations. To compare, this is similar to the 5.0% overall SAE rate and 2.0% in 
Infections and infestations reported for the adalimumab treatment group in one of the underlying 
pivotal studies (RHAP). There were no SAEs reported in the Cardiac Disorders SOC in the primary 
analysis set of the PsA studies (see also AEs of Special Interest for a summary and discussion of MACE 
events). 
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 110/156 
 
 
  
  
There were 9 (4.3%) patients with SAEs in the total IXE group in study RHAP and 11 (4.5%) in study 
RHBE. Events that were typically considered possibly related to study drug by the investigator were 
events of infection or autoimmune in nature. Infections and IBD are reflected in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of 
the SmPC.  
All PsA Analysis Set 
Overall, 73 of the 1118 ixekizumab-treated PsA patients (6.5%) in this analysis set reported ≥1 SAE. 
Consistent with the Primary PsA Analysis Set, the Infections and infestations SOC had the greatest 
incidence of SAEs among the SOCs (1.3%). Few individual preferred terms for an SAE were reported 
for 2 or more patients:  Pneumonia, Lower respiratory tract infection, Carotid artery stenosis, 
Cerebrovascular accident, Fall, Acute myocardial infarction, Coronary artery disease, Cholecystitis 
acute, Cholelithiasis, and Osteoarthritis. 
The table below provides a summary of exposure-adjusted IR of (treatment emergent) SAEs by 12-
week intervals to Week 84 for this data set.  
Table 38: Overview of SAEs – Frequency and Incidence Rate by 12-Week Intervals 
All PsA Ixekizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set 
The frequency and incidence rate was numerically somewhat higher in the final 12-week period than in 
any other period. However, at the time of database lock, there were only approximately one fourth of 
the patients included in this final time period compared with the initial 12-week period. Also, a similar 
trend was not observed in the larger ‘All Psoriasis Analysis Set’ for the psoriasis studies.  
All Psoriasis Analysis Set 
A total of 670 ixekizumab-treated psoriasis patients (11.8%) in this analysis set had ≥1 SAE. 
Consistent with the other analysis sets, in this larger analysis set, the Infections and infestations SOC 
had the greatest incidence of SAEs among the SOCs. Among individual preferred terms, the most 
frequently reported SAEs were Cellulitis (0.5%), Fall (0.3%), Myocardial infarction (0.3%), and 
Osteoarthritis (0.3%). An analysis of onset of SAEs by 12-week intervals to Week 156 does not 
suggest an increase in the frequency or rate of SAEs with increasing durations of exposure to 
ixekizumab.

Adverse events of special interest 
Adverse events pre-specified as being of special interest (AESIs) are listed in the table below. These 
AESIs were selected based on standard drug registration topics (eg, hepatic toxicity/liver function), 
safety findings from the ixekizumab clinical development programme, potential risks associated with 
biologic immunomodulators, and comorbidities and risk factors prevalent in PsA and psoriasis 
populations (e.g., MACE, IBD), as well as regulatory topics of special interest for this class of 
compounds (e.g., depression). Although AEs were collected by spontaneous report, for AESIs (e.g., 
infection, ISRs, and general allergic/ hypersensitivity reactions), investigators were to collect additional 
information about these events. Cardiovascular-related MedDRA preferred terms were identified to 
facilitate independent adjudication.

Infections 
In the Primary PsA Analysis Set, infection-related TEAEs occurred in a numerically higher proportion 
of patients treated with ixekizumab than with placebo and similar between the dose groups.

Table 40: Overview of Infection-Related TEAEs Primary PsA Analysis Set 
Double-Blind Treatment Period (Weeks 0 to 24) 
Within the Infections and infestations SOC, the most common events by PT were Upper respiratory 
tract infection (6.8% total IXE, 7.1% placebo), Nasopharyngitis (4.8% vs. 4.0%), and Sinusitis (3.3% 
vs. 2.2%). Most of the infection-related TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity and did not lead to 
early discontinuation. There were 3 infection events in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group that were 
reportedly severe (Rhinitis, Abscess jaw, and Oesophageal candidiasis), compared with 1 severe 
infection in the Q4W group (Otitis media).  
Overall infection rates observed in psoriatic arthritis clinical studies were similar to those observed in 
the placebo-controlled period of the pivotal plaque psoriasis studies. In these studies, nasopharyngitis 
(9.2%) and upper respiratory tract infection (4.1%) were similarly the most commonly reported type 
of treatment-emergent infection. 
Within the active-controlled study RHAP, the frequency of infection-related TEAEs in adalimumab-
treated patients (25.7%) was comparable to the ixekizumab group (25.8%) and the placebo group 
(25.5%), respectively.

Primary PsA Placebo-Controlled Integrated Analysis Set 
The total ixekizumab group had a higher percentage of patients with an infection-related SAE (1.3%, 
n=6) than the placebo group (0). Individual preferred terms for infection-related SAEs were as follows. 
•  Gastroenteritis (1 patient in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W group) 
•  Abscess jaw (1 patient in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group) 
•  Anal abscess (1 patient in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group) 
•  Herpes zoster (1 patient in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group) 
•  Oesophageal candidiasis (1 patient in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group) 
• 
Perirectal abscess (1 patient in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group) 
Most infection-related SAEs were reported in the 80 mg Q2W dose group. The events of abscess jaw, 
anal abscess, and herpes zoster were considered related to study drug by the investigator. From the 
Assessment report

narrative, it appears that also for the SAE of oesophageal candidiasis, a causal relationship to 
ixekizumab cannot be excluded although the patient had an extensive medical and concomitant 
medication history, including diabetes and the use of steroids. In the active-controlled study RHAP, 2 
serious infections occurred in adalimumab-treated patients (Cellulitis and Pneumonia mycoplasma). 
In the All PsA Analysis Set, 37.2% of patients (n=416) had ≥1 infection-related TEAE. A total of 
1.3% of patients (n=15) had ≥1 infection-related SAE. Serious events that occurred in 2 or more 
patients were Pneumonia (n=3) and Lower respiratory tract infection (n=2). A total of 1.3% of patients 
(n=14) discontinued due to an infection-related AE. 
For the All Psoriasis Analysis Set which includes 5689 patients with 12,061.5 total patient-years of 
ixekizumab exposure, infection-related TEAEs (exposure-adjusted incidence rate) is summarized 
below. There was no indication of an increase in the risk of infections with increasing durations of 
exposure to ixekizumab.

Table 43: Opportunistic and Potential Opportunistic Infections Double-Blind Treatment 
Period  
(Weeks 0 to 24) Primary PsA Placebo-Controlled Integrated Analysis Set 
For treatment-emergent Candida infections, there was a greater proportion of patients in the 
ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W and 80 mg Q4W group with ≥1 such infection compared with placebo. Candida 
infections in the placebo group were limited to vulvovaginal infections. All but 1 Candida infections 
were mild to moderate in severity; in the Q2W group, 1 case of Oesophageal candidiasis was an SAE 
and rated as severe. No patients in the Primary PsA Analysis Set discontinued due to a Candida 
infection. 
Consistent with the plaque psoriasis Phase III studies, the incidence of candida infections identified by 
the PT ‘oral candidiasis’ was significantly greater with ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W compared to placebo 
and there was a trend for more such cases for the 80 mg Q2W versus 80 mg Q4W group. There were 
no cases of invasive herpes simplex, viral hepatitis, confirmed active or reactivated TB, endemic 
mycoses, invasive Aspergillus, or other deep fungal infections in the Primary PsA Analysis Set. The 
patient with Herpes simplex listed in the 80 mg Q4W group had an HSV-II outbreak which was 
confirmed to be a cutaneous outbreak. 
In the All PsA Analysis Set, the proportion of patients with TE opportunistic infections was 3.9%. 
Tuberculin test positive was reported in 0.3% (n=3) of ixekizumab-treated PsA patients. No patient 
was reported to have active TB. Herpes zoster was reported in 0.7% (n=8) of ixekizumab-treated PsA 
patients; no disseminated Herpes zoster was reported. 
Of note, an event of Hepatitis B was reported in 0.1% (n=1) of ixekizumab-treated PsA patients. One 
patient had a routine serum HBV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test reported as qualitatively 
positive, without quantitation, at Week 36. HBV DNA was not detected in 4 subsequent samples, the 
first of which was drawn 3 weeks after the sample reported to be HBV DNA positive. The patient 
discontinued study treatment due to this event as required by study protocol 
TE serious infections considered as opportunistic included 1 case of Oesophageal candidiasis and 1 
case of Herpes zoster (ophthalmic branch of trigeminal nerve) (both also included in the Primary PsA 
Analysis Set). Both events occurred in patients receiving ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W. 
The types of opportunistic infections reported in patients with plaque psoriasis (All Psoriasis Analysis 
Set) were consistent with those described in the plaque psoriasis MAA.  
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 116/156 
 
 
  
  
There were no reports indicating invasive Herpes simplex. Herpes zoster or Varicella zoster were 
reported in 1.4% (n=80) of patients in this analysis set. Testing for TB was required yearly in the 
clinical development program. As a result, cases of potential TB considered as a broad term occurred 
in 0.8% of patients (n=43) in this analysis set. There have been no reported cases of active or 
reactivated TB. There has been 1 patient each who were reported with Primary Cytomegalovirus 
Infection, Bartonellosis, and Toxoplasma Infection, respectively. These patients were previously 
described in the plaque psoriasis MAA. 
Overall, the profile of infections in the Primary PsA Analysis Set for the current application is 
considered consistent with the prior experience of ixekizumab. The current data of hepatitis virus re-
activation appears to be too limited to warrant specific inclusion in the product information.  
Potential opportunistic infections (as considered by using broad terms) required medical review and 
according to the MAH no cases of invasive Herpes Simplex were reported. Although there was no 
statistically significant difference to placebo, there were numerical differences between the ixekizumab 
treatment groups and placebo with respect to patients with mucocutaneous Herpes simplex infections 
(1.8% vs 0.4%), more so than in the previous plaque psoriasis studies. In addition, oral herpes is 
included as ADR in the SmPC for secukinumab. Accordingly, Herpes Simplex (mucocutaneous) has now 
been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Infections are already included as identified risk in the current RMP with the objective to monitor the 
incidence rate and nature of rare and clinically relevant infections through submission of additional 
safety data from ongoing studies, a post-marketing safety registry (the Corrona Registry), 
accompanied by routine pharmacovigilance. 
Cytopenia 
A greater reduction in total neutrophils was noted in the total ixekizumab group compared to placebo 
(-0.77 and 0.02 x109/L change from baseline, respectively) in the Primary PsA Analysis Set, with 
no evidence of a dose response. Similarly, there were statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
reductions in each of the ixekizumab groups compared with placebo with respect to the LSMean 
changes in leukocytes and platelets from the last observation during baseline to the last observation 
postbaseline (see table below). From baseline to last observation, mean neutrophil counts decreased 
more with ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W (– 0.903x109/L) and Q2W (– 0.634x109/L) than with placebo 
(0.018x109/L). Mean platelet counts decreased more with ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W (-32.5x109/L) and 
Q2W (-27.3x109/L) than with placebo (-3.2x109/L).

Period  
(Weeks 0 to 24) Primary PsA Placebo-Controlled Integrated Analysis Set 
•  Neutrophils 
The percentage of patients with TE-low neutrophil counts and the percentage of patients shifting from 
baseline to a lower grade postbaseline were higher in ixekizumab groups versus placebo. At least one 
TE Grade 1 or worse neutrophil count (<2x109/L) was observed in approximately 8% to 10% of 
ixekizumab patients from all 3 datasets. At least one TE Grade 2 or worse neutrophil count 
(<1.5x109/L) was observed in approximately 3% of ixekizumab patients from all 3 datasets. 
It is stated in the Clinical Safety Summary that an exposure-response relationship was not observed 
for grade 2 neutropenia. In order to assist understanding the drug exposure-response relationships to 
the cytopenias, the company was requested to submit figures of (i) trough concentration quartile 
versus percent neutropenia [grades 1 to 4 combined], (ii) trough concentration quartile versus percent 
lymphopenia [grades 1 to 4 combined] and (iii) trough concentration quartile versus percent 
thrombocytopenia [grades 1 to 4 combined]. As there was no Grade 3 or Grade 4 event of neutropenia 
or Grade 2-4 thrombopenia in the defined periods (through Week 52 for Study RHAP and Week 24 for 
Study RHBE) the company provided an analysis of of Grade 1 and Grade 2 neutropenia.  In Study 
RHAP, higher frequencies of Grades 1 or 2 neutropenia appeared to be associated with higher 
ixekizumab trough levels. However, this phenomenon was not observed in Study RHBE. No apparent 
correlation between higher trough ixekizumab exposures and higher percentages of patients with 
Grade 1 thrombocytopenia was observed. Overall, no firm conclusions could be drawn considering the 
small numbers of subjects in each group.  
Treatment-emergent Grades 3 and 4 neutropenia were not observed during the Double-Blind 
Treatment Period, but occurred in respectively 3 (0.3%) and 0 patients of the All PsA Analysis Set, 
and in 16 (0.3%) and 3 (0.1%) patients of the All Psoriasis Analysis Set. 
There were 3 cases of Grade 4 neutropenia (0.1%) all in the All Psoriasis Analysis Set; 2 cases were 
categorised as transient and 1 case persisted at least 7 months after ixekizumab treatment 
discontinuation, without concomitant infection. 
• 
Platelets 
Assessment report

In the Primary Analysis Set, no meaningful difference was observed between ixekizumab groups and 
the placebo group for the percentage of patients with TE-low platelet counts at any time postbaseline, 
nor for the percentage of patients shifting from baseline to a lower grade postbaseline.  
No Grade 2 or worse platelet count was observed during the Double-Blind Treatment Period. 
Treatment-emergent Grade 2, 3, and 4 platelet counts were observed, respectively, in 1 (0.1%), 0, 
and 0 patients in the All PsA Analysis Set, and in 12 (0.2%), 1 (<0.05%), and 2 (<0.05%) patients 
in the All Psoriasis Analysis Set. Both cases of TE Grade 4 platelet count were single occurrences 
despite study drug being continued thereafter, and none was associated with any event of bleeding. 
Five TEAEs that could be considered as bleeding (preferred terms: Contusion [n=2], Ecchymosis, 
Muscle contusion, and Purpura) were reported as temporally associated with Grade 1 
thrombocytopenia but none with Grades 2, 3, or 4. No case of thrombocytopenia was reported as 
serious.  
Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are already included in section 4.8 of the currently approved 
SmPC. Additionally neutropenia is included in the RMP as an important identified risk. Overall, the 
current findings seem to be consistent with previous data. 
However, in order to assist further understanding, the company was requested to provide shift figures 
of (i) baseline neutrophil count versus lowest neutrophil count, (ii) baseline lymphocyte count versus 
lowest lymphocyte count and (iii) baseline platelet count versus lowest platelet count. This showed that 
exposure to ixekizumab is associated with a reduction in neutrophil and platelet counts. This is 
appropriately reflected in the current section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Allergic reactions/Hypersensitivity reactions 
An overview of allergic reaction/hypersensitivity events in the Primary PsA Analysis Set is provided in 
the table below. Potential anaphylaxis events were defined by specific MedDRA preferred terms 
(Criterion 1) or by other Sampson criteria (Criterion 2). Specifically, Criterion 1 for anaphylaxis was 
defined by the presence of a TEAE based on the following MedDRA preferred terms from the 
Anaphylactic Reaction SMQ: 
•  Anaphylactic reaction 
•  Anaphylactic shock 
•  Anaphylactoid reaction 
•  Anaphylactoid shock 
•  Kounis Syndrome 
• 
Type 1 hypersensitivity. 
Criterion 2 for anaphylaxis required having TEAEs from 2 or more of 4 categories of AEs as described 
by Sampson et al. (2006). Occurrence of these events had to be nearly coincidental, based on 
recording of events on CRFs. All qualifying events had to be within ≤1 day of study drug injection. The 
4 categories considered in Criterion 2 were: 
•  Category A: Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue 
•  Category B: Respiratory compromise 
•  Category C: Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms 
•  Category D: Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms. 
There were no confirmed cases of ixekizumab-related anaphylaxis events across the clinical 
development program. Of note, the nonanaphylactic AEs that are summarized in the table below do 
not include injection site reactions.

Table 45: Overview of Allergic Reaction/Hypersensitivity Events - Double-Blind Treatment 
Period (Weeks 0 to 24) Primary PsA Placebo-Controlled Integrated Analysis Set 
Non-anaphylaxis allergic reaction/hypersensitivity TEAEs were more frequent in the ixekizumab 
treatment groups (Q4W: n= 10 [4.4%]; Q2W: n=14 [6.2%]) compared to placebo (n=4; 1.8%). 
Eczema, Rash, and Urticaria, which were each reported by 3 ixekizumab-treated patients and no 
placebo patients, were the most frequently reported preferred terms.  All of these TEAEs were mild or 
moderate in severity and none was reported as an SAE. Two patients in the Q4W group discontinued: 
1 due to Rash pruritic and 1 due to Hypersensitivity.

ixekizumab patients as compared to 5.0% and 2.8% for adalimumab and placebo, respectively. 
In the All PsA Analysis Set, a total of 5.4% of patients (n=60) had ≥1 non-anaphylaxis event. None 
of the events were reported as severe. There were no patients with a TEAE that met the criteria for an 
anaphylaxis event.  
One patient had a nonanaphylaxis SAE (angioedema) of moderate severity, 28 days after starting 
ixekizumab, was hospitalized and treated with chlorpheniramine and prednisolone with resolution of 
event 8 days after onset. No other relevant medical history was reported. The investigator considered 
the AE of angioedema as related to the study drug and patient was discontinued from the study. A 
total of 0.4% of patients (n=5) discontinued due to 5 different nonanaphylaxis events. Events leading 
to discontinuation included Angioedema, Drug eruption, Hypersensitivity, Rash, and Rash pruritic. 
Key findings from the All Psoriasis Analysis Set include: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Approximately 12.9% of patients reported ≥1 AE classified as an allergic reaction/hypersensitivity 
event. Among the most frequently reported of these were events of uncertain relationship to 
ixekizumab (for example, dermatitis contact, eczema). 
Serious hypersensitivity-type AEs and discontinuation of ixekizumab due to allergic 
reaction/hypersensitivity events were uncommon with 0.4% of patients reporting such events, 
respectively. 
There was no indication of an increased risk for allergic reaction/hypersensitivity events with 
increasing durations of exposure to ixekizumab. 
Three patients experienced a potential anaphylaxis SAE based on the specific MedDRA preferred 
term of Anaphylactic reaction. Two of the events occurred approximately 14 days after the first 
and only administration of ixekizumab, while the third event occurred after a colonoscopy exam in 
the patient. There were no confirmed cases of anaphylaxis associated with administration of 
ixekizumab in the psoriasis clinical development program. 
Anaphylactic reactions are already covered by the current SmPC. After data lock for the first PSUR 
period (22 March 2016 to 22 September 2016), a signal for serious immediate hypersensitivity 
reactions consistent with anaphylaxis was identified from postmarketing spontaneous adverse event 
reports of ixekizumab leading to a review of data for serious immediate hypersensitivity reactions. 
Based on the findings from postmarketing spontaneous reports and mechanistic plausibility, a 
cautionary statement on hypersensitivity reactions was included in section 4.4 of the SmPC and the 
MedDRA PT of anaphylaxis was added as a rare event in section 4.8.  
Consistent with urticaria (already included in section 4.8), the following additional PTs have been 
added to section 4.8: eczema, rash, angioedema.  
Of note, an association between the reporting of anaphylaxis or non-anaphylaxis allergic 
reaction/hypersensitivity TEAEs and the development of TE-ADA was not established. For example, in 
the All Psoriasis Analysis Set in Immunogenicity Evaluable patients (N=4118), among TE-ADA negative 
patients (n=3222), 14.4% of patients reported ≥1 nonanaphylaxis TEAEs, as compared to 15.5% of 
patients who were TE-ADA positive (n=896).  
Injection Site reactions 
Injection site reaction TEAEs were reported more frequently in each of the ixekizumab treatment 
groups compared with placebo.

Table 47: Overview of Injection Site-Related AEs - Double-Blind Treatment Period  
(Weeks 0 to 24) Primary PsA Placebo-Controlled Integrated Analysis Set 
Individual PTs for ISR TEAEs, terms reported significantly more frequently in one of the ixekizumab 
groups compared with placebo were Injection site reaction, Injection site erythema, Injection site 
hypersensitivity, and Injection site pruritus.  
In each of the ixekizumab groups, the maximum severity of ISR TEAEs was mild or moderate for 95% 
to 98% of patients who reported such events. The proportion of patients with ≥1 ISR TEAE was 
significantly higher in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W versus the Q4W group (25.3% versus 17.5%, 
respectively; p=.037). The proportions of patients who discontinued due to an ISR AE were 5 patients 
in the total ixekizumab group [1.1%] and 1 patient [0.4%] in the placebo group, respectively. 
The rate of severe ISRs was numerically higher with ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W versus Q4W, (1.3% 
versus 0.4%, respectively). Likewise, the proportions of patients who discontinued due to an ISR AE 
was numerically higher in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group versus the Q4W group (1.8% [n=4] 
versus 0.4% [n=1]. 
In the All PsA Analysis set (N=1118), 211 patients (18.9%) experienced ≥1 ISR TEAE. Injection site 
reaction PTs reported for ≥1% of patients were Injection site reaction (11.8%, n=132), Injection site 
erythema (4.5%, n=50), Injection site pain (1.2%, n=13), and Injection site hypersensitivity (1.0%, 
n=11). For most patients, the maximum severity of the event was categorized as mild or moderate 
(206 of 211 patients). Five patients (0.4%) had ≥1 event categorized as severe. The median duration 
of ISRs in ixekizumab-treated PsA patients was 0.43 weeks (3 days). 
The exposure-adjusted incidence rate for ISR-related TEAEs by 12-week time intervals through 84 
weeks for the All PsA Analysis Set decreased substantially over time, from 76.8 (Weeks 0 to 12) to 8.0 
ISRs/100 patient-years (Weeks 72 to 84). 
Similarly, for the All Psoriasis Analysis Set, the exposure-adjusted incidence rate for TEAEs of ISRs 
by 12-week time intervals decreased from 50.2 (Weeks 0 to 12) to 5.5 ISRs/100 patient-years (Weeks 
144 to 156). 
As discussed by the MAH, the frequency of ISRs was significantly higher in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W 
group (n=57; 25.3%) than in the Q4W group (n=40; 17.5%). However, the rates of ISRs per 100 
active injections were comparable between the Q2W and Q4W treatment groups (8.1 per 100 active 
injections for Q2W and 7.7 per 100 active injections for Q4W), suggesting that the higher rate in the 
Q2W treatment group is due to the greater number of injections compared to the Q4W group.  
Overall, the data for ISRs were relatively consistent across the 3 integrated analysis sets and similar to 
the findings from the initial plaque psoriasis MAA submission. Injection site reactions are already 
Assessment report

included in section 4.8 of the SmPC as very common ADRs. The frequency of events is not increasing 
over time and only a limited number of patients on ixekizumab discontinued due to injection site 
reactions.  
Overall, as could be expected, ISRs were reported more frequently for patients treated with 
ixekizumab as compared to adalimumab. In RHAP, in adalimumab patients (5.9%), this was similar to 
placebo (4.7%). 
There were numerically somewhat more events of ISR in patients who developed TE-ADA. However, 
the patient numbers were small and a relationship to antibody positivity not clearly established (see 
section - Immunogenicity).  
Cerebro-Cardiovascular Events  
Cerebro-CV events, including major adverse cerebro-cardiovascular events (MACE), were adjudicated 
by an external, independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC). MACE were defined as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
Vascular death (including CV and cerebro-vascular causes excluding hemorrhagic deaths outside 
of the central nervous system) 
Nonfatal myocardial infarction 
Nonfatal stroke (subcategories: ischemic, hemorrhagic, unknown stroke type). 
There were no confirmed, adjudicated MACE among any patients in the Primary PsA Analysis Set. 
Across the ixekizumab clinical development programme for PsA and psoriasis, 57 patients had a 
confirmed, adjudicated MACE, 13 of which resulted in death of the patient (1 patient from the All PsA 
Analysis Set; preferred term: Cerebrovascular accident). 
This event pertained to a patient with a history of dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a 
previous transient ischemic attack who was randomised to adalimumab, then received ixekizumab 80 
mg Q4W, died due to ‘undetermined stroke’ (preferred term: Cerebrovascular accident) after 537 
days of treatment. 
In addition to this death, there were 4 additional patients with confirmed MACE in the All PsA Analysis 
Set: nonfatal myocardial infarction in 1 patient (0.1%) and nonfatal stroke in 3 patients (0.3%). 
All 5 patients had a medical history of hypertension and additional risk factors for CV disease (e.g. 
dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus). 
The incidence of confirmed MACE in ixekizumab-treated patients with PsA or psoriasis did not change 
substantially over time with increased exposure. The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of MACE in the 
PsA clinical development programme (0.5/100 patient-years) was consistent with the rates reported in 
the initial plaque psoriasis MAA submission (0.3 to 0.7/100 patients-years) and was not higher than 
the rates reported in a United Kingdom population-based longitudinal cohort (Ogdie et al. 2015). 
In patients with psoriasis, the exposure-adjusted IR of MACE did not change substantially with longer 
exposures to ixekizumab.

Table 48: CEC-Confirmed MACE - Frequency and Incidence Rate by 12-Week Intervals  
All Psoriasis Ixekizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set 
The adjusted IRs for MACE in the updated All Psoriasis Population appear to be reflective of the 
population. To compare, in a population-based cohort study from 1994 to 2010 (Ogdie et al, Ann 
Rheum Dis. 2015; 74:326-32), unadjusted incidence rates of MACE was reported to be slightly over 
0.5 (per 100 patient-years) both for PsA and psoriasis populations. 
MACE has previously been identified in the RMP as an important potential risk, and similar to other 
low-frequency events is being monitored as part of the additional pharmacovigilance activity in the 
RMP, namely a prospective observational registry (Corrona Registry). 
Malignancies 
In an analysis that grouped PTs into categories of NMSC and malignancies excluding NMSC, the 
incidences for each category and subcategory of malignancy (NMSC, [basal cell carcinoma, squamous 
cell carcinoma]) were not significantly different between the ixekizumab treatment groups compared 
with placebo. Both patients who reported a malignancy were in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W treatment 
group.

breast carcinoma [n=1]. There was no increase in the rate of malignancy events with increasing 
durations of ixekizumab exposure. 
In the All Psoriasis Analysis Set, a total of 1.7% of patients (n=94) had ≥1 TEAE malignancy event.  
The table below presents the number and exposure-adjusted IR of malignancies by 12-week intervals 
to Week 156. 
Table 50: Malignancies - Frequency and Incidence Rate by 12-Week Intervals  
All Psoriasis Ixekizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set 
Most commonly, these events were coded as basal cell carcinomas (n=33; 0.6%), prostate cancer 
(n=10; 0.3%), squamous cell carcinoma of skin (n=7; 0.1%), invasive ductal breast carcinoma (n=5; 
0.1%), and squamous cell carcinoma (n=4, 0.1%).

A total of 0.9% of patients (n=50) had≥1 malignancy SAEs. Serious malignancy PTs reported for ≥2 
patients were Basal cell carcinoma (n=4), Prostate cancer (n=9), and Invasive ductal breast carcinoma 
(n=5). A total of 0.9% of patients (n=50) discontinued due to malignancy.  
Based on the number and exposure-adjusted IR of malignancies by 12-week intervals to Week 156, 
there was no increase in the rate of malignancy events with increasing durations of ixekizumab 
exposure. 
Overall, the rate of malignancy reported in clinical trials of ixekizumab for patients with either PsA or 
psoriasis appears to be consistent with the background rate in these populations.  
Hepatic Events 
Primary PsA Analysis Set 
For hepatic laboratory test results, some treatment-emergent statistically significant differences 
between treatment groups were detected. Bilirubin mean values increased in both ixekizumab 
treatment groups and in the total ixekizumab group by approximately 6.7%, whereas the mean 
change in the placebo group decreased by approximately 4.1%. The median change from baseline in 
all treatment groups was 0.0.  
ALT mean values increased by approximately 12.3% in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W group and 
decreased by 6.1% in the placebo group. Median changes from baseline were equal to 1.0 in each 
ixekizumab group. AST mean values increased by approximately 7.3% in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W 
group and by 3.4% in the total ixekizumab group (driven by the Q4W group), and decreased by 
approximately 2.1% in the placebo group. Median increases of 1.0 were seen in the ixekizumab 80 mg 
Q4W group and were 0.0 in all other treatment groups. Overall, these mean changes were not 
considered clinically meaningful.  
The table below presents a comparison of proportions of patients in each treatment group with 
elevated post-baseline hepatic laboratory test values by abnormal baseline category and by using pre-
specified elevation cutoffs for each parameter.  
The results do not indicate clinically important changes related to ixekizumab treatment in patients 
with PsA.

The company presents many tables of analyses. In order to assist understanding, the company was 
requested to provide shift figures of (i) baseline AST versus peak AST and (ii) baseline ALT versus peak

Table 52: Hepatic-Related TEAEs - Double-Blind Treatment Period  
(Weeks 0 to 24)  
Primary PsA Placebo-Controlled Integrated Analysis Set 
In the All PsA Analysis Set, among patients having≥1 postbaseline ALT and total bilirubin 
measurement (n=1112), there were no patients who met the laboratory screening criteria for potential 
drug-induced hepatotoxicity (maximum ALT ≥3xULN and maximum total bilirubin ≥2xULN). Based on 
the percentage and exposure-adjusted IR of hepatic-related TEAEs by 12-week intervals to Week 84, 
there was no indication of an increased risk for these events with increasing durations of exposure to 
ixekizumab. 
In the All Psoriasis Analysis Set among ixekizumab-treated psoriasis patients having ≥1 
postbaseline ALT and total bilirubin values (n=5634), 3 patients (<0.05%) met the laboratory 
screening criteria for potential drug-induced hepatotoxicity (maximum ALT ≥3xULN and maximum 
total bilirubin ≥2xULN). All 3 cases were previously reported in the plaque psoriasis MAA. There have 
been no additional cases since that time. Three hundred nine ixekizumab-treated psoriasis patients 
(309/5689 [5.4%]) had ≥1 hepatic-related TEAE according to the narrow term search. The hepatic-
related TEAE preferred terms with a frequency ≥1.0% were Hepatic steatosis (1.4% [n=79]), GGT 
increased (1.4% [n=80]), and ALT increased (1.4% [n=77]). 
Seven ixekizumab-treated psoriasis patients (7/5689 [0.1%]) had a serious hepatic-related AE. The 
preferred terms for these SAEs were Cholestasis, Drug-induced liver injury (verbatim term: 
“atorvastatin-induced hepatitis”), Hepatic steatosis, Hepatotoxicity, Hepatitis (verbatim term: “chronic

nutritive-toxic damage of the liver”), Hepatic function abnormal, and International normalized ratio 
increased. 
Fourteen ixekizumab-treated psoriasis patients (14/5689 [0.2%]) discontinued study drug due to a 
hepatic-related AE defined by narrow term search; 3 additional patients (a total of 17 patients [0.3%]) 
discontinued due to an event defined by the broad term search. The PTs given as the reason for 
discontinuation of 2 or more patients were ALT increased (3 patients), Hepatic enzyme increased (3 
patients), Liver function test increased (3 patients), and Hepatic steatosis (2 patients). 
The table below presents the percentage and exposure-adjusted IR of hepatic-related TEAEs by 12-
week intervals to Week 156. Overall, there was no indication of an increased risk of these events with 
increasing durations of ixekizumab exposure. 
Table 53: Hepatic-Related TEAEs - Frequency and Incidence Rate by 12-Week Intervals  
All Psoriasis Ixekizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set 
Overall, as also concluded in the plaque psoriasis MAA, there appears to be no increased risk of 
hepatotoxicity associated with ixekizumab treatment. 
Depression and Suicide/Self-Injury 
Treatment with ixekizumab did not worsen depression when compared with treatment with placebo as 
assessed by the QIDS-SR16 (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report) total score 
in the placebo-controlled PsA studies. Also, in comparison to patients treated with placebo, there were 
no differences among ixekizumab-treated patients in the percentages that improved, worsened, or 
stayed the same for maximum postbaseline QIDS-SR16 Item 12 score (thoughts of death or suicide) in 
the placebo-controlled PsA studies.  
There was no difference between the total ixekizumab treatment group compared with placebo with 
respect to the proportions of patients reporting ≥1 TEAE in the Depression (excluding suicide and self-
injury) sub-SMQ. Likewise, neither the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W nor Q4W group was different from 
placebo. No suicide attempts or self-injury-related events were identified.

Table 54: Depression- and Suicide/Self-Injury–Related Events Double-Blind Treatment 
Period  
(Weeks 0 to 24) Primary PsA Placebo-Controlled Integrated Analysis Set 
In the All PsA Analysis Set, a total of 1.3% of patients (n=15) had ≥1 TEAE in the Depression 
(excluding suicide and self- injury) sub-SMQ. There were no serious depression- related events. No 
suicide attempts or self-injury-related events were identified by analyses of the Depression and 
Suicide/Self-injury SMQ. 
Overall, there were no suicide/self-injury-related events reported across the PsA studies. 
In the updated All Psoriasis Analysis Set, the percentage of patients with depression-related events 
was low. A total of 2.0% of patients (n=114) had ≥1 TEAE identified by narrow terms in the 
Depression (excluding suicide and self-injury) sub-SMQ. A total of 0.2% of patients (n=10) had a 
serious depression-related event identified by narrow terms (excluding suicide and self-injury). The 
frequency and exposure-adjusted IR for such events in this analysis set was consistent up to 156 
weeks of ixekizumab treatment exposure, with no increase over time.  
Cumulatively, there have been 13 events identified by narrow terms in the Depression and 
Suicide/Self-injury SMQ, which include suicide attempt (9 patients), suicidal ideation (3 patients), 
intentional overdose (1 patient, who also reported suicide attempt), and intentional self-injury (1 
patient). Ten of these events have been reported previously during the submission and review of the 
plaque psoriasis MAA. There were no completed suicides. All patients with suicide/self-injury-related 
events had multiple risk factors. 
Overall, the data do not suggest an increased risk of depression and suicide/self-injury behavior 
associated with ixekizumab use. 
Inflammatory Bowel Disease 
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 130/156 
 
 
  
  
There was one case of IBD in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group in the Primary PsA Analysis Set. This 
patient was not discontinued from study drug for either event. 
In the All PsA Ixekizumab Exposures Analysis Set (N=1118), there were 2 additional cases (0.1%). 
One ixekizumab-treated PsA patient (0.1%) had an SAE of ulcerative colitis. Study drug was not 
discontinued.  
The event reported for the other patient was mild and not serious. Upon evaluation, the sponsor 
considered that this was not a true case of IBD. This can be agreed. The event was discovered during 
surgery for intestinal neoplasm/polyp. 
Overall, there were no significant differences between the ixekizumab groups and placebo, or between 
the ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W and Q2W groups, with respect to the frequency of IBD in patients with 
PsA. 
In the updated All Psoriasis analysis set (N=5689), a total of 18 (0.3%) patients had ≥1 TEAE of 
IBD as identified by narrow terms. For 6 patients, the event was serious. For 11 patients, the event 
caused the patient to discontinue study drug. 
With respect to possible IBD cases identified by nonspecific terms, 16 patients (0.3%) had ≥1 such 
event. For 6 patients, the event was serious. For one patient, the event caused the patient to 
discontinue study drug. Upon evaluation of the cases identified by nonspecific MedDRA terms in the All 
Psoriasis Ixekizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set, the sponsor considers that 3 of the 16 cases 
identified by nonspecific terms represent true IBD. A review of preexisting conditions or historical 
illnesses suggestive of IBD in psoriasis patients showed that, of 19 patients with such diagnoses, 3 
patients experienced an exacerbation during the study. 
As also noted in the plaque psoriasis MAA, studies in the literature demonstrate an increased 
prevalence of IBD among patients with psoriasis (some including PsA) when compared with a matched 
control population. Possibly, this association between psoriasis, PsA, and IBD may be due to shared 
inflammatory pathways.  
The current data in the PsA population are consistent with the known safety profile of ixekizemab. The 
fact that cases of new or exacerbations of IBD have been reported is already covered in the SmPC and 
IBD (Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) is included in the RMP as a potential risk. 
Interstitial Lung Disease 
There have been documented cases suggestive of a potential association between the use of 
immunomodulatory agents and an increased risk of ILD. No safety signal for ILD in relation to 
ixekizumab was identified in the data submitted for the plaque psoriasis MAA. 
There were no cases of ILD in the Primary PsA Analysis Set.  
There was one PsA patient (1 of 1118 patients [0.1%]) with an ILD-related TEAE in the All PsA 
Analysis Set. The patient was in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group, and the event occurred after the 
patient had been on Q2W more than 24 weeks. The day and month of the event were not recorded. 
The event (preferred term: Pulmonary granuloma, actual term: 6 mm pulmonary right lung base 
calcified granuloma) was mild in severity, was not serious, and did not cause the patient to discontinue 
study drug.  
Nine ixekizumab-treated psoriasis patients (9 of 5689 [0.2%]) had ≥1 ILD-related TEAE. The most 
frequently reported ILD-related preferred term was Bronchiolitis (3 patients, [0.1%]). The other 
reported preferred terms were Interstitial lung disease, Pulmonary fibrosis, Pulmonary sarcoidosis, 
Pulmonary toxicity, and Sarcoidosis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 131/156 
 
  
  
There were no cases of ILD in the Primary PsA Analysis Set. The reported events in the All PsA Analysis 
Set (1) and in the All Psoriasis Analysis Set (9) were non-serious. In the latter, one of the patients was 
reported to have died during his participation in the study due to the SAE of acute on chronic 
hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to ILD. However, the specifics of this diagnosis seem unclear 
from the narrative and the patient had also suffered multiple episodes of pneumonia. Overall, a new 
safety signal has not been evoked. 
2.5.1.1.  Discontinuations due to AEs 
In the Primary PsA Analysis Set, key findings included the following: 
• 
• 
• 
The proportions of patients who prematurely discontinued study treatment due to any AE were as 
follows: 3.6% (n=8) of patients in the placebo group; 3.1% (n=7) of patients in the ixekizumab 
80 mg Q4W group; 5.3% (n=12) of patients in the Q2W group; 4.2% (n=19) of patients in the 
total ixekizumab group. Thus, the proportion of patients who discontinued due to an AE was 
numerically higher in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group than in the Q4W or placebo groups. 
The SOCs in which discontinuations due to AEs were most frequently reported were the General 
disorders and administration site conditions SOC (1.2%, n=8; 6 of which were injection site 
reactions) and the Infections and infestations SOC (0.6%, n=4). 
Individual PTs as the reason for early discontinuation (≥2 patients) were Injection site reaction 
(ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W, 1 patient; Q2W, 2 patients) and Interferon gamma release assay 
positive (ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W, 1 patient; Q2W, 1 patient).  
Patients with no evidence of past infection with tuberculosis (TB) were required to undergo yearly 
testing and to discontinue study drug if postbaseline TB testing was positive. 
In an analysis of clusters of particular PTs — such as for infections, for ISRs, and for other AESIs and 
preferred terms of interest— there were no clinically important differences between the ixekizumab 
groups compared with placebo, or between the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group compared with the Q4W 
group, with respect to the proportions of patients who discontinued due to such AEs except for the 
Injection Site Reactions cluster. In this cluster, the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group had 4 (1.8%) TEAEs 
that resulted in study treatment discontinuation, as compared with 1 (0.4%) in the Q4W group and 1 
(0.4%) in the placebo group, which consistent with the findings in the psoriasis MAA. 
In the All PsA Analysis Set, 5.7% (n=64) of ixekizumab-treated PsA patients had an AE which led to 
discontinuation of study drug. Discontinuations due to AEs were most frequently reported in the 
Infections and infestations SOC (1.3%, n=14; 6 of 14 due to Latent tuberculosis) and the 
Investigations SOC (1.3%, n=14; 13 of 14 due to Interferon gamma release assay positive or 
Tuberculin test positive).  
In the All Psoriasis Analysis Set, 6.7% (n=379) of ixekizumab-treated psoriasis patients had an AE 
which led to discontinuation of study drug. Discontinuations due to AEs were most frequently reported 
in the Investigations SOC (1.1%, n=63; 41 of 63 due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex test 
positive or Tuberculin test positive); Infections and infestations SOC (1.0%, n=58); and Neoplasms 
benign, malignant, and unspecified SOC (0.9%, n=53).  
Looking at reasons for discontinuation over a longer follow-up period, the All PsA and All Psoriasis 
Analysis Sets showed consistency. In the All PsA Analysis Set (N=1118), a total of 1.3% of patients 
(n=14) discontinued due to an infection-related AE, most commonly latent tuberculosis (n=6, 0.5%). 
In the updated All Psoriasis Analysis Set (N=5689), a total of 1.0% of patients (n=58) discontinued 
due to an infection-related AE (latent tuberculosis 0.3%).

Laboratory findings 
Cytopenias (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) and hepatic evaluations are discussed in section 4.5.2.5 
above. 
The findings from all other analyses of treatment-emergent (TE) abnormal high or low laboratory 
values and analyses of mean changes from baseline in the Primary PsA Analysis Set generally did not 
demonstrate clinically important changes in haematology and chemistry parameters.  
Clinically important cases of clinical laboratory changes comprised those related to treatment-
emergent CK levels above 5000 IU/L.  These cases were either transient and/or apparently associated 
with skeletal muscular contractions, exercise, or exertional-induced rhabdomyolysis. 
There were 4 patients (2 in each ixekizumab group) with a treatment-emergent CK value >5000, 
occurring during the Double-Blind Treatment Period. Based on the provided narratives, these findings 
appeared to be incidental and transient.  
Overall, the observations for laboratory findings were consistent across the 3 integrated analysis sets 
and similar to the findings from the initial plaque psoriasis MAA submission.  
Immunogenicity 
Patients in all ixekizumab clinical studies were tested for the presence of ixekizumab ADA.  
In the Primary PsA Analysis Set, preexisting ADA were observed in 10 of 208 patients (4.8%) in the 
placebo group, 10 of 220 patients (4.5%) in the Q4W treatment group, and 11 of 218 (5.0%) in the 
Q2W treatment group. All patients who were ADA positive at baseline were classified as low ADA titer 
(<1:160). None of the patients with preexisting ADA had a 4-fold increase in titer after baseline, and 
therefore, none were considered treatment-emergent (TE)-ADA positive. 
In the Primary PsA Analysis Set, the incidence of TE-ADA from Weeks 0 to 52 was 11% in patients 
receiving ixekizumab Q4W and ixekizumab Q2W treatment. The immunogenicity results from patients 
receiving ixekizumab Q4W was similar to those receiving ixekizumab Q2W. 
The majority of patients with positive TE-ADA were classified as low titer.  
The incidence of NAb was 8% and 6% in patients receiving ixekizumab Q4W and ixekizumab Q2W 
treatment, respectively. 
No serious allergic reaction/hypersensitivity or injection site reaction TEAEs were reported in PsA 
patients.  
In the immunogenicity evaluable population of the All PsA Analysis Set, among ixekizumab-treated PsA 
patients, 54 (5.9%) TE-ADA negative patients had ≥1 nonanaphylaxis TEAE (immediate or 
nonimmediate), and 4 (4.7%) TE-ADA positive PsA patients had such events. Also, 173 (18.9%) 
ixekizumab-treated PsA TE-ADA negative patients had ≥1 ISR TEAE and 24 (28.2%) TE-ADA positive 
patients had ≥1 ISR TEAE.  
Overall, the results showed no association between TE-ADA status and allergic 
reaction/hypersensitivity or injection site reaction AEs.  
The MAH concludes that there is no association between TE-ADA status and allergic 
reaction/hypersensitivity or injection site reaction AEs. As shown in the table below, the proportions of 
patients who experienced injection site reactions was consistently higher in TE-ADA positive patients as 
compared to TE-ADA negative patients. However, the number of TE-ADA positive patients was 
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 133/156 
 
  
  
relatively small and the appearance of the reported events not limited to TE-ADA positivity. Thus, it 
can be agreed that the association is not fully clear.

Safety supplementary analyses 
In the 24-week Placebo-Controlled Treatment Period of Studies RHAP and RHBE, patients in the 
placebo group who were inadequate responders (placebo-IR) at Week 16 were re-randomized in a 1:1 
ratio to 1 of the 2 ixekizumab treatment groups. These placebo-IR patients were included in the 
denominator of the placebo and ixekizumab treatment groups in supplementary analyses. In these 
supplementary analyses, the TEAEs occurring while the patient was receiving placebo were counted as 
TEAEs in the placebo group, and the TEAEs occurring while the patient was treated with ixekizumab 
were counted as TEAEs in the ixekizumab group. The actual placebo exposure time and ixekizumab 
exposure time were reflected in the total patient-years for the actual time the patient was on each 
treatment. Overall, findings from these analyses were consistent with findings for the Primary PsA 
Placebo- Controlled Integrated Analysis Set (Weeks 0 to 24). 
Safety in patient subgroups and special populations 
TEAEs from the Primary PsA Analysis Set were evaluated according to subgroups based on patient 
demographics (sex, age, weight, BMI, race, ethnicity, geographic region); disease severity (CRP, 
baseline DAS28-CRP score); previous therapy (cDMARD use at baseline, MTX use at baseline, 
corticosteroid use at baseline, inadequate response to 1 or more DMARDs, previous use of bDMARDs); 
and other characteristics (smoking, baseline psoriasis, baseline moderate-to-severe psoriasis). 
Additionally, there was no difference in the TEAE profile due to concomitant use of a cDMARD (MTX, 
leflunomide, SSZ, or hydroxychloroquine) compared to those patients not concomitantly receiving a 
cDMARD. Approximately 57% of patients were receiving concomitant cDMARDs during the Double-
Blind Treatment Period; of those patients, 83% were receiving MTX.  
 Body weight appeared to interact with treatment for the occurrence of ISRs; these latter were more 
common with ixekizumab (total group) vs placebo in the <80 kg group (23.4% versus 0% 
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 134/156 
 
 
  
  
respectively) and the [≥80 and <100] group (24.2% vs 5.4%), but not in the ≥100 kg group (12.5% 
vs 9.8%) (as compared to 23.7% vs. 2.9% for the <100 kg group). See truncated table below 
(AP1.2.7.4.139 – injection site reactions, High-Level Term): 
The frequency of ISRs was higher with ixekizumab versus placebo in all BMI categories, but these 
differences tended to be higher in the patients with BMI <30 than in those with BMI ≥30.  
In section 4.8 of the current SmPC, it is stated that in the plaque psoriasis studies, injection site 
reactions were more common in subjects with a body weight <60 kg compared with the group with a 
body weight ≥ 60 kg (25% vs. 14% for the combined Q2W and Q4W groups). This was not clearly the 
case for the <60 kg vs. ≥60 kg subgroups in the Primary PsA Analysis Set (both subgroups showed 
more ISRs in the ixekizumab group as compared to placebo, see truncated table below): 
Given the overall trends towards more events of ISR in subjects with lower bodyweight for the PsA 
studies, consistent with the plaque psoriasis studies, section 4.8 has been updated  accordingly to 
reflect this. 
There was a numeric trend towards a greater proportion of patients reporting infections who were 
naive to conventional DMARD experience at baseline (see truncated table below –) but the numbers of 
patients in this category were small. There was no statistically significant interaction between the 
cDMARD experience groups.  
Discussion: 
As stated above, approximately 57% of patients were receiving concomitant cDMARDs during the 
Double-Blind Treatment Period. The vast majority of those patients, 83% were receiving MTX. 
However, the proposed indication is broader, allowing for ‘combination with conventional DMARDs’. 
This broad wording is considered of concern and insufficiently justified at current. The MAH has 
conducted subgroup analyses with regards to previous therapy groups (cDMARD use at baseline, MTX 
use at baseline, corticosteroid use at baseline – yes/no) but not with respect to other cDMARDs. In the 
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 135/156 
 
 
 
 
  
  
first RSI, the MAH was requested to discuss the comparative safety profile of combining ixekizumab 
with other cDMARDs (e.g. sulfasalazine, leflunomide or hydroxychloroquine) as compared to the 
combination with MTX and to justify the broad wording in the proposed indication from a safety point 
of view. The MAH provided summary tables with comparative TEAE data for patients with concomitant 
MTX use versus the other cDMARDs. Taken together, the summary tables provided by MAH did not 
show any notable differences in safety profile for concomitant cDMARDs other than MTX vs. placebo 
(as compared to concomitant MTX vs. placebo). However, given the small numbers of patients treated 
with each of the compounds other than MTX, it was not possible to draw conclusions and the broad 
indication initially submitted for patients treated with conventional DMARD  could not be supported 
from a safety point of view. In response to CHMP concerns, the MAH has now revised the proposed 
indication to restrict it and include only the combination with MTX, as recommended by the CHMP.  
Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Cumulatively as of the data cutoff date for this submission (30 Sep 2016), there were 44 women who 
became pregnant during their study participation (45 total pregnancies).  
Table 56:Cumulative Summary of Pregnancies: Female Study Participants Exposed to 
Ixekizumab 
Three pregnancies were carried to term and delivered with notable infant or maternal outcomes: one 
patient underwent cesarean section performed due to cephalopelvic disproportion and fetal 
tachycardia; one patient underwent cesarean section due to placenta previa and breech presentation; 
and one patient experienced pre-eclampsia/arterial hypertension with Hemolysis, Elevated Liver 
enzymes, Low Platelet count (HELLP) syndrome and subsequently delivered a healthy infant at 37 
weeks. 
There were 68 pregnancies in partners of male patients exposed to ixekizumab during their 
participation in a study. Of the 68 pregnancies, 38 were carried to term and delivered without evidence 
of fetal adverse effect, 3 were electively terminated, 3 were abortion spontaneous, and 8 outcomes are 
still pending. Four pregnancies were carried to term and delivered with notable infant outcomes: 1 
infant was born with fetal pyelocaliecstasis right kidney; one with congenital widening of the right renal 
pelvis; one with webbed left and middle finger; and one was born prematurely (36 weeks of gestation) 
who had no evidence of fetal adverse effects.

Overall, safety data on pregnancy in relation to ixekizumab exposure is still very limited. This is 
reflected in the current SmPC. Of note, the RMP states that study I1F-MC-B005 is an observational 
study (Category 3 – current status: planned) to assess maternal and fetal outcomes following 
exposure to ixekizumab.

2.5.1.2.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
See Clinical Pharmacology Section. Ixekizumab is not anticipated to affect the metabolism or transport 
of other drugs commonly used in patients with PsA. Based on both population PK analyses and 
graphical assessments, it was concluded that MTX and corticosteroids have no impact on the PK of 
ixekizumab. 
Although no cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated drug interactions with ixekizumab are anticipated, drug-
drug interaction study I1F-MC-RHBU (RHBU) is being conducted in patients with psoriasis to evaluate 
the hypothesis. No other drug interaction studies are planned.  
2.5.1.3.  Post-marketing experience 
The first marketing approval for ixekizumab occurred on 22 Mar 2016 (International Birth Date) when 
FDA approved ixekizumab for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 137/156 
 
 
  
  
In the post-marketing setting, a signal for serious immediate hypersensitivity reactions (3 reports of 
serious immediate hypersensitivity consistent with anaphylaxis) consistent with anaphylaxis was 
identified as a rare event (frequency ≥0.01% to <0.1%). This has been assessed within Periodic 
Safety Update Report (PSUR 01) in December 2016 (reporting period of 22 March 2016 through 22 
September 2016) and is reflected in the updated SmPC. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile for ixekizumab in the treatment of PsA is as expected and consistent with the known 
safety profile from studies in plaque psoriasis. During the Double-Blind Treatment Period (Weeks 0 to 
24) of the PsA studies RHAP and RHBE, the most frequently reported preferred terms (occurring 
in≥5% of total ixekizumab-treated patients) were Injection site reaction and Injection site erythema 
(greater frequency in each ixekizumab group compared to placebo) and Upper respiratory tract 
infection (similar frequency across treatment groups). Of note, in RHAP, the most frequent TEAEs in 
patients treated with the active comparator adalimumab included Nasopharyngitis and Upper 
respiratory tract infection. 
The majority of injection site reactions (ISRs, defined as high-level term) were mild or moderate in 
severity, 0.7% (n=5) were rated as severe, and none were reported as an SAE. Six patients (0.9%) 
discontinued treatment due to injection site reactions (defined as high-level term) (1 placebo, 1 
ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W, and 4 ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W). The frequency of ISRs was significantly 
higher in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group than in the Q4W group. However, the rates of ISRs per 
100 active injections were comparable between the groups which may suggest that the higher rate in 
the Q2W treatment group is due to the greater number of injections. Also, no clear relationship 
between the development of ISRs and treatment-emergent ADA positivity could be observed. 
A known risk for patients treated with ixekizumab is infection, including Candida infection. In the 
Primary PsA Analysis Set, there was a difference in the frequency of infection-related SAEs between 
the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W (n=5) group and the Q4W (n=1) and placebo (n=0) groups. Also, the 
proportion of patients with an opportunistic infection (OI) or potential OI (narrow terms) was greater 
in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W (n=10; 4.4%) and Q4W treatment groups (n=5; 2.2%) as compared to 
placebo (n=1; 0.4%). Predefined OIs included mucocutaneous Candida infections and herpes zoster. 
Treatment-emergent serious infections considered as opportunistic included 1 case of Oesophageal 
candidiasis and 1 case of Herpes zoster (ophthalmic branch of trigeminal nerve). There were numerical 
differences between the ixekizumab treatment groups vs. placebo with respect to mucocutaneous 
Herpes Simplex. This is reflected in section 4.8 of the product information.  
Otherwise, the profile of infections in the Primary PsA Analysis Set for the current application is 
considered consistent with the prior experience of ixekizumab. There were no cases of invasive herpes 
simplex, viral hepatitis, confirmed active or reactivated TB, endemic mycoses, invasive Aspergillus, or 
other deep fungal infections. Infections are already included as identified risk in the current RMP with 
the objective to monitor the incidence rate and nature of rare and clinically relevant infections through 
submission of additional safety data from ongoing studies, a post-marketing safety registry (the 
Corrona Registry), as well as routine pharmacovigilance. 
Of note, one of the pivotal PsA studies (RHAP) included an active reference group, with adalimumab. 
Within RHAP, the risk of infections and serious infections was comparable between adalimumab and 
ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W. 
Low grade neutropenia was commonly observed in patients receiving ixekizumab. However, treatment-
emergent Grades 3 and 4 neutropenia were not observed during the Double-Blind Treatment Period of 
the PsA studies, but occurred in respectively 3 (0.3%) and 0 patients of the All PsA Exposures dataset, 
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 138/156 
 
  
  
and in 16 (0.3%) and 3 (0.1%) patients of the All Psoriasis Exposures dataset. No cases of Grade 4 
neutropenia were associated with concomitant infection. There were no cases of Grade 2, 3, or 4 
thrombocytopenia, nor was there any case of bleeding-related TEAE associated with thrombocytopenia 
in the Primary PsA Analysis Set. 
In the postmarketing setting following MA for plaque psoriasis, a signal for serious immediate 
hypersensitivity reactions has been assessed within a PSUR and this is now reflected in the updated 
SmPC. In the Primary PsA Analysis Set, non-anaphylaxis allergic reaction/hypersensitivity TEAEs were 
more frequent in the ixekizumab treatment groups (Q4W: 4.4%; Q2W: 6.2%) as compared to placebo 
(1.8%) consistent with the initial plaque psoriasis submission. All of these TEAEs were mild or 
moderate in severity and none was reported as an SAE. Some additional PTs (eczema, rash, 
angioedema) have been added to section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Other adverse events of special interest predefined included cerebro-cardiovascular events (including 
MACE), malignancies, hepatic-related events, depression and suicide/self-injury, inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD), and interstitial lung disease. No new safety concerns were evoked based on the current 
PsA submission with regards to hepatotoxicity, depression and suicidal behavior, or interstitial lung 
disease.  
MACE, malignancies, and IBD are already included in the RMP as potential risks. The overall rates for 
these events were similar to the psoriasis studies and, across the ixekizumab clinical development 
programme for PsA and psoriasis, appear to be consistent with background rates for these populations 
reported in the literature. In the updated All Psoriasis Analysis Set which includes 5689 patients with 
12,061.5 total patient-years of ixekizumab exposure, there was no indication of an increase in risk of 
these events with increasing durations of exposure to ixekizumab.  
Overall, the findings from the safety analyses across the 2 ixekizumab dosing regimens, including 
within subgroups, were consistent with the plaque psoriasis program.  
The safety profiles of the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W and Q4W dosing regimens were sufficiently 
consistent with one another although there were numerically slightly more SAEs of infection and 
opportunistic infections in the Q2W group. Thus, the proposed dosing regimens for the PsA population 
can be supported from a safety point of view. This includes the recommendation to follow the dosing 
regimen for plaque psoriasis for those PsA patients with concomitant moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis (160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, then maintenance dosing of 80 
mg every 4 weeks) whereas the remaining PsA patients are recommended to receive the less frequent 
ixekizumab regimen of 160 mg at Week 0, followed by 80 mg every 4 weeks thereafter.  
Approximately 57% of patients in the Primary PsA Analysis Set were receiving concomitant cDMARDs 
during the Double-Blind Treatment Period. The vast majority of those patients, 83% were receiving 
MTX. The data on safety of combining ixekizumab with other cDMARDs appears to be very limited. The 
MAH has conducted subgroup analyses with regards to previous therapy groups (cDMARD use at 
baseline, MTX use at baseline, corticosteroid use at baseline – yes/no) but not with respect to other 
cDMARDs. However, the proposed indication is broad, allowing for ‘combination with (all) conventional 
DMARDs’. In the first RSI, the MAH was requested to discuss the comparative safety profile of 
combining ixekizumab with other cDMARDs (e.g. sulfasalazine, leflunomide or hydroxychloroquine) as 
compared to the combination with MTX and to justify the broad wording in the proposed indication 
from a safety point of view. The MAH provided summary tables with comparative TEAE data for 
patients with concomitant MTX use versus the other cDMARDs. Taken together, the summary tables 
provided by MAH did not show any notable differences in safety profile for concomitant cDMARDs other 
than MTX vs. placebo (as compared to concomitant MTX vs. placebo).  However, the small numbers of 
patients treated with each of the compounds other than MTX were considered insufficient to evaluate 
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 139/156 
 
  
  
safety. Since the mode of action and potential risks vary between the different cDMARDs it is not 
possible to regard them as a single “class”, or to simply extrapolate safety conclusions from the 
combination with MTX. Thus, the broad indication could not be supported from a safety point of view. 
Further studies on the combination of ixekizumab and cDMARDs other than MTX would be required to 
justify the proposed wording of the indication. As such the  indication was revised to include only the 
combination with MTX.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 5.1 is acceptable.  
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 5.1 with the following content:

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As  a  result  of  this  variation,  sections  4.1,  4.2,  4.4,  4.5,  4.8,  5.1,  and  5.2  of  the  SmPC  are  being

accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
There have not been revisions that significantly affect the overall readability and design of the package 
leaflet. Therefore, Lilly does not consider it necessary to conduct further consultation with target 
patient groups further to that performed for the initial MAA. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Efficacy data are provided from 2 pivotal phase III studies in patients with psoriatic arthritis, studies 
RHAP and RHBE. In Study RHAP, 417 bDMARD-naive subjects were randomised to each of the 4 
treatment groups: ixekizumab 80 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W), ixekizumab 80 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W), 
adalimumab 40 mg every 2 Weeks or placebo. Ixekizumab treatment was started with a loading dose 
of 160 mg. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was achieved as ixekizumab at both 80 mg Q2W and Q4W were superior 
to placebo for ACR20 response at Week 24 (p<0.001). The ACR20 response rates at Week 24 were 
62.1% for ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W, 57.9% for ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W, 57.4% for adalimumab and 
30.2% for placebo. Superior ACR20 response rates compared to placebo were seen already at Week 1, 
and response rates were maintained over time. The difference vs placebo was 31.9% for ixekizumab 
80 mg Q2W, 27.8% for ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W and 27.2% for adalimumab.

Week 24, HAQ-DI at Week 24, ACR20 at Week 12 and PASI 75 at Week 12. No statistically significant 
responses were shown for the secondary endpoints LEI score at Week 12 or Itch NRS at Week 12, for 
either ixekizumab dose compared to placebo.  
In the extension period (up to 52 weeks) of study RHAP, sustained therapeutic effect was observed for 
ACR20, HAQ-DI and PASI75. 
Study RHAP included efficacy analyses in the subset of patients who were cDMARD-experienced, which 
is relevant according to the proposed indication. Both ixekizumab doses were superior to placebo for 
the primary endpoint ACR20 at Week 24 and for the major secondary endpoints HAQ-DI, mTSS, 
ACR20 (at Week 12), PASI 75, and Itch NRS. 
In Study RHBE, 363 bDMARD-experienced subjects were randomised to each of the 3 treatment 
groups: ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W, ixekizumab Q4W or placebo.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was achieved as ixekizumab at both dosing regimens were superior to 
placebo for ACR20 response at Week 24 (p<0.001). The ACR20 response rates at Week 24 were 
48.0% for ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W, 53.3% for ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W and 19.5% for placebo. 
Superior ACR20 response rates compared to placebo were seen already at Week 2 for ixekizumab 80 
mg Q4W and continued to improve until a plateau was reached around Week 8. The difference vs 
placebo was 28.5% for ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W and 33.8% for ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W. It is noted that 
the lower dose has higher response rates. 
Both dosing regimens of ixekizumab were superior to placebo for the secondary endpoints HAQ-DI at 
Week 24, ACR20 at Week 12, PASI 75 at Week 12 and minimal disease activity at Week 24. No 
difference was shown in proportion of patients achieveing remission of enthesitis defined by LEI 
score=0 at Week 24, compared to placebo.  
The extension period of RHBE is ongoing, and the Week 52 data are anticipated to become available in 
August 2017. The data will be submitted post approval. 
Both phase III studies thus met the primary endpoint as ACR20 response rates with both ixekizumab 
doses were statistically significantly higher compared to placebo at Week 24. In the bDMARD-naive 
population, the proportion of patients achieving the primary endpoint ACR20 response at Week 24 
were comparable to the active comparator adalimumab, though no statistical comparison was made.  
There were no significant differences in treatment response between the two posologies for the pre-
specified endpoints. Data from the psoriasis phase III program indicated that for patients with 
moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, following a 160 mg starting dose, a dosing regimen of 
ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W provided greater efficacy at Week 12 for the skin endpoints of PASI 75/90/100 
and sPGA (0,1)/(0), when compared to a dosing regimen of ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W. Therefore, it is 
recommended that PsA patients with coexistent moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis use the dosing 
approved for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: 160 mg at Week 0, followed by 80 mg 
at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, then 80 mg Q4W.  
In conclusion, ixekizumab has demonstrated a positive and clinically meaningful effect on the 
treatment of psoriatic arthritis. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Regarding ixekizumab’s inhibitory effect on radiographic progression, it is difficult to draw safe 
conclusions due to the short observation time for the secondary outcome. From a clinical perspective, 
data on mTSS at Week 52 are more relevant. In this analysis, patients in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W 
group had a larger mTSS change from baseline compared to patients initially randomised to placebo or

adalimumab (both switched to ixekizumab at Week 16 or 24). The applicant justifies this with the fact 
that the progression per se was low, and mainly driven by one patient. This may be true and can 
hopefully be verified when data from the long-term extension (108 Weeks) arrives. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Safety data were submitted from the 2 pivotal studies for the PsA indication, studies RHAP and RHBE. 
In addition, supportive safety data in PsA is provided by one ongoing double-blind, randomized 
withdrawal study, preceded by an Open-Label Period, in patients with active PsA who have had 
inadequate response to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARD-IR) and are 
bDMARD-naive (I1F-MC-RHBF [RHBF]). Integrated datasets were submitted comprising data from the 
2 pivotal studies (Primary PsA Analysis Set), a larger dataset containing data from ixekizumab-treated 
patients from all treatment periods of studies RHAP and RHBE and the open-label period of study RHBF 
(All PsA Analysis Set), as well as data from 11 completed or ongoing studies in psoriasis as of 
September 2016 (All Psoriasis Analysis Set).  
During the Double-Blind Treatment Period (Weeks 0 to 24) of the PsA studies RHAP and RHBE, the 
most frequently reported preferred terms (occurring in≥5% of total ixekizumab-treated patients) were 
Injection site reaction and Injection site erythema (greater frequency in each ixekizumab group 
compared to placebo) and Upper respiratory tract infection (similar frequency across treatment 
groups). Of note, in RHAP, the most frequent TEAEs in patients treated with the active comparator 
adalimumab included Nasopharyngitis and Upper respiratory tract infection. 
The majority of injection site reactions (ISRs, defined as high-level term) were mild or moderate in 
severity, 0.7% (n=5) were rated as severe, and none were reported as an SAE. Six patients (0.9%) 
discontinued treatment due to injection site reactions (defined as high-level term) (1 placebo, 1 
ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W, and 4 ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W). The frequency of ISRs was significantly 
higher in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group than in the Q4W group. There was an overall trend 
towards more events of ISR in subjects with lower (as compared to higher) body weight for the PsA 
studies, consistent with the plaque psoriasis studies.  
A known risk for patients treated with ixekizumab is infection, including Candida infection. In the 
Primary PsA Analysis Set, there was a difference in the frequency of infection-related SAEs between 
the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W (n=5) group and the Q4W (n=1) and placebo (n=0) groups. Also, the 
proportion of patients with an opportunistic infection (OI) or potential OI (narrow terms) was greater 
in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W (n=10; 4.4%) and Q4W treatment groups (n=5; 2.2%) as compared to 
placebo (n=1; 0.4%). Predefined OIs included mucocutaneous Candida infections and herpes zoster. 
Treatment-emergent serious infections considered as opportunistic included 1 case of Oesophageal 
candidiasis and 1 case of Herpes zoster (ophthalmic branch of trigeminal nerve). There were numerical 
differences between the ixekizumab treatment groups vs. placebo with respect to mucocutaneous 
Herpes Simplex. 
Of note, one of the pivotal PsA studies (RHAP) included an active reference group, with adalimumab. 
Within RHAP, the risk of infections and serious infections was comparable between adalimumab and 
ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W. 
Low grade neutropenia was commonly observed in patients receiving ixekizumab. However, treatment-
emergent Grades 3 and 4 neutropenia were not observed during the Double-Blind Treatment Period of 
the PsA studies, but occurred in respectively 3 (0.3%) and 0 patients of the All PsA Exposures dataset, 
and in 16 (0.3%) and 3 (0.1%) patients of the All Psoriasis Exposures dataset. No cases of Grade 4 
neutropenia were associated with concomitant infection. There were no cases of Grade 2, 3, or 4

thrombocytopenia, nor was there any case of bleeding-related TEAE associated with thrombocytopenia 
in the Primary PsA Analysis Set. 
In the postmarketing setting following MA for for the approved indication of plaque psoriasis, a signal 
for serious immediate hypersensitivity reactions has been assessed within a PSUR and this is now 
reflected in the updated SmPC. In the Primary PsA Analysis Set, non-anaphylaxis allergic 
reaction/hypersensitivity TEAEs were more frequent in the ixekizumab treatment groups (Q4W: 4.4%; 
Q2W: 6.2%) as compared to placebo (1.8%) consistent with the initial plaque psoriasis submission. All 
of these TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity and none was reported as an SAE 
Other adverse events of special interest predefined by the MAH included cerebro-cardiovascular events 
(including MACE), malignancies, hepatic-related events, depression and suicide/self-injury, 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and interstitial lung disease. No new safety concerns were evoked 
based on the current PsA submission with regards to hepatotoxicity, depression and suicidal behavior, 
or interstitial lung disease.  
MACE, malignancies, and IBD are already included in the RMP as potential risks. The overall rates for 
these events were similar to the psoriasis studies and, across the ixekizumab clinical development 
programme for PsA and psoriasis, appear to be consistent with background rates for these populations 
reported in the literature. In the updated All Psoriasis Analysis Set which includes 5689 patients with 
12,061.5 total patient-years of ixekizumab exposure, there was no indication of an increase in risk of 
these events with increasing durations of exposure to ixekizumab. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The safety profile observed in the studies is similar to the previous indication. There are no 
recommended changes to the safety specification for ixekizumab based on the current submission. The 
current RMP reflects the previously agreed identified and potential risks, as well as missing 
information, to be addressed.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Statistically  significant  efficacy  of  ixekizumab  in  the  treatment  of  PsA  has  been  demonstrated  as  both 
phase III studies met their primary endpoint. The ACR20 response rates with both ixekizumab doses were 
statistically  significantly  higher  compared  to  placebo  at  Week  24.  In  the  bDMARD-naive  population,  the 
proportion  of  patients  achieving  the  primary  endpoint  ACR20  response  at  Week  24  was  similar  to  the 
response for adalimumab.  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
There  were  no  significant  differences  in  treatment  response  between  the  two  posologies  for  the  pre-
specified  endpoints.  Data  from  the  psoriasis  phase  III  program  for  patients  with  moderate-to-severe 
plaque psoriasis indicated that following a 160 mg starting dose, a dosing regimen of ixekizumab 80 mg 
Q2W provided greater efficacy at Week 12 for the skin endpoints of PASI 75/90/100 and sPGA (0,1)/(0), 
when compared to a dosing regimen of ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W. Therefore, it is recommended  that PsA 
patients  with  coexistent  moderate-to-severe  plaque  psoriasis  use  the  dosing  approved  for  patients  with 
moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: 160 mg at Week 0, followed by 80 mg at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 
12, then 80 mg Q4W. 
Overall, the safety profile for ixekizumab in the treatment of PsA, based on the data provided, was as 
expected and consistent with the known safety profile from studies in plaque psoriasis. Frequently 
reported ADRs were Injection site reaction and Injection site erythema. However, the majority of these 
reactions were mild or moderate in severity and none were reported as an SAE.  The frequency of ISRs 
was significantly higher in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group than in the Q4W group. However, the rates 
of ISRs per 100 active injections were comparable between the groups which may suggest that the higher 
rate in the Q2W treatment group is due to the greater number of injections. Also, no clear relationship 
between the development of ISRs and treatment-emergent ADA positivity could be observed. 
The profile of infections in the Primary PsA Analysis Set for the current application is also considered 
consistent with the prior experience of ixekizumab. There were no cases of invasive herpes simplex, viral 
hepatitis, confirmed active or reactivated TB, endemic mycoses, invasive Aspergillus, or other deep fungal 
infections. Treatment-emergent serious infections considered as opportunistic included 1 case of 
Oesophageal candidiasis and 1 case of Herpes zoster (ophthalmic branch of trigeminal nerve). There were 
numerical differences between the ixekizumab treatment groups vs. placebo with respect to 
mucocutaneous Herpes Simplex, however. This has been reflected in section 4.8 of the product 
information.  
Low grade neutropenia was commonly observed in patients receiving ixekizumab. However, treatment-
emergent Grades 3 and 4 neutropenia were not observed during the Double-Blind Treatment Period of 
the PsA studies, although reported in few patients in the All PsA Exposures and All Psoriasis Exposures 
datasets. No cases of Grade 4 neutropenia were associated with concomitant infection. There were no 
cases of Grade 2, 3, or 4 thrombocytopenia, nor was there any case of bleeding-related TEAE associated 
with thrombocytopenia in the Primary PsA Analysis Set. 
Consistent with the initial plaque psoriasis submission, non-anaphylaxis allergic reaction/hypersensitivity 
TEAEs were more frequent in the ixekizumab treatment groups as compared to placebo. All of these 
events were mild or moderate in severity and none was reported as an SAE. Some additional PTs 
(eczema, rash, angioedema) have been added to section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Overall, the findings from the safety analyses across the 2 ixekizumab dosing regimens, including within 
subgroups, were consistent with the plaque psoriasis program. Also, the safety profiles of the ixekizumab 
80 mg Q2W and Q4W dosing regimens were sufficiently consistent with one another although there were 
numerically slightly more SAEs of infection and opportunistic infections in the Q2W group. Thus, the 
proposed dosing regimens for the PsA population can be supported from a safety point of view.  
No concerns were evoked based on the current submission with regards to potential AEs of interest 
including hepatotoxicity, depression and suicidal behavior, or interstitial lung disease. MACE, 
malignancies, and IBD are already included in the RMP as potential risks and no new safety concerns 
were identified. 
Importantly, while the safety profile of ixekizumab in the PsA population appears to be reflective of prior 
experience, the initially proposed indication allowing for ‘combination with (all) conventional DMARDs’ 
could not be accepted from a safety perspective. Approximately 57% of patients were receiving 
Assessment report  
EMA/59447/2018 
Page 152/156 
 
  
  
concomitant cDMARDs during the Double-Blind Treatment Period. The vast majority of those patients, 
83%, were receiving MTX. Data supporting the safety of combining ixekizumab with other cDMARDs 
appears to be very limited.. Thus, the available data were considered to be insufficient to justify such 
broad wording in terms of conventional DMARD therapy. However, the proposed indication was revised to 
include the combination with MTX only.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Ixekizumab has demonstrated a positive and clinically meaningful effect on the treatment of psoriatic 
arthritis. The risks identified in the pivotal Phase III studies for PsA are considered to be consistent with 
those previously established in the psoriasis MAA submission.  
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Clinically relevant efficacy has been shown for ixekizumab in the treatment of PsA in bDMARD-naïve and 
bDMARD-experienced populations.  
The safety profile for ixekizumab in the current application is considered quite consistent with prior 
experience. Also, the safety profiles of the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W and Q4W dosing regimens were 
sufficiently consistent with one another although there were numerically slightly more SAEs of infection 
and opportunistic infections in the Q2W group. Thus, the proposed dosing regimens for the PsA 
population can be supported from a safety point of view. This includes the recommendation to follow the 
dosing regimen for plaque psoriasis for those PsA patients with concomitant moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis (160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, then maintenance dosing of 80 mg 
every 4 weeks) whereas the remaining PsA patients are recommended to receive the less frequent 
ixekizumab regimen of 160 mg at Week 0, followed by 80 mg every 4 weeks thereafter.  
MACE, malignancies, and IBD are already included in the RMP as potential risks. The overall rates for 
these events were similar to the psoriasis studies and, across the ixekizumab clinical development 
programme for PsA and psoriasis, appear to be consistent with background rates for these populations 
reported in the literature. In the updated All Psoriasis Analysis Set which includes 5689 patients with 
12,061.5 total patient-years of ixekizumab exposure, there was no indication of an increase in risk of 
these events with increasing durations of exposure to ixekizumab. Infections are already included as 
identified risk in the current RMP with the objective to monitor the incidence rate and nature of rare and 
clinically relevant infections through submission of additional safety data from ongoing studies, a post-
marketing safety registry (the Corrona Registry), as well as routine pharmacovigilance. 
In conclusion, the risks identified in the pivotal Phase III studies for PsA are considered to be consistent 
with those previously established in the psoriasis MAA submission. However, the initial proposed 
indication was broad, allowing for ‘combination with (all) conventional DMARDs’ although the vast 
majority of concomitant cDMARDs safety data pertain to MTX only. The small numbers of patients treated 
with each of the compounds other than MTX was considered insufficient to evaluate safety. Since the 
mode of action and potential risks vary between the different cDMARDs it is not possible to regard them 
as a single “class”, or to extrapolate safety conclusions from the combination with MTX.  
Further studies on the combination of ixekizumab and cDMARDs other than MTX would be required to 
justify a broader wording as initially proposed by the MAH.

Additional market protection 
The MAH submitted at the start of the procedure a request for consideration that the new indication 
brings significant benefit in comparison to existing therapies in accordance with Article 14(11) of 
Regulation (EC) 726/2004 - one year of market protection for a new indication. During the assessment, 
the CHMP raised questions concerning the significant benefit. Prior to the adoption of the CHMP opinion, 
the company withdrew its request for additional market protection. As a result of the MAH withdrawal of 
this ancillary request, no opinion on the additional market protection is adopted by CHMP.  
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of Indication to include Ixekizumab alone or in combination with methotrexate,  the treatment 
of active psoriatic arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to 
one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapies. 
 As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated to reflect the 
new safety and efficacy information. The Package Leaflet and RMP have been updated accordingly.

Reminders to the MAH 
1. 
In accordance with Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the Agency makes available a 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the medicinal product assessed by the Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use. The EPAR is first published after the granting of the initial 
marketing authorisation (MA) and is continuously updated during the lifecycle of the medicinal 
product. In particular, following a major change to the MA, the Agency further publishes the 
assessment report of the CHMP and the reasons for its opinion in favour of granting the change to 
the authorisation, after deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature. 
Should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains commercially confidential 
information, please provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of 
commercially confidential information (CCI) in “track changes” and with detailed justification by 
8 January 2018. The principles to be applied for the deletion of CCI are published on the EMA 
website at 
http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Other/2012/03/WC500124536.pdf. 
2. 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version 
of Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
3. 
The MAH is reminded to submit an eCTD closing sequence with the final documents provided by 
Eudralink during the procedure (including final PI translations, if applicable)within 15 days after the 
Commission Decision, or prior to the next regulatory activity, whichever is first. For additional 
guidance see chapter 4.1 of the Harmonised Technical Guidance for eCTD Submissions in the EU.

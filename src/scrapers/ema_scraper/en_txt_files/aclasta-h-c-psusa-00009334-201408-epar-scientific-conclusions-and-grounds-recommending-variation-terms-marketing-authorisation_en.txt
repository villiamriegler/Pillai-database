Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for zoledronic acid (indicated for 
Osteoporosis), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
With regards to the risk of Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), it is recommended that the product 
information is revised to reflect the current knowledge on ONJ and to optimize risk minimisation.  
In addition, although the risk for ONJ may be well known for the prescribers, further awareness on 
such risk is needed for the patients. Thus, it is considered warranted to implement a patient reminder 
card as part of the existing patient information pack, as an additional risk minimisation measure for 
ONJ. The wording for the reminder card has been agreed by the PRAC.  
Therefore, in view of available data regarding zoledronic acid (indicated for Osteoporosis), the 
PRAC considered that changes to the product information and conditions of the marketing 
authorisation were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for zoledronic acid (indicated for Osteoporosis) the 
CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing zoledronic 
acid (indicated for Osteoporosis) is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product 
information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

Methotrexate  is  available for  clinical  use  and  marketed  since  more  than  15  years  in  most  countries 
worldwide. Methotrexate 25  mg/ml solution  for injection  may be considered a hybrid medicinal product 
of the originator product Lantarel® FS 25 mg/ml from Pfizer (Germany). 
This application is based on published scientific literature. No new pre-clinical tests or clinical trials were 
conducted  for  this  application.  Methotrexate  solution  of  Lantarel  (reference product)  and  the  product 
submitted  in this application are qualitatively and quantitatively comparable.  
With  this  submission,  the  MAH  proposes  to  add  a  new  indication  through  variation  number  C.I.6.a: 
moderate to severe recalcitrant disabling psoriasis, which is not adequately responsive to other forms of 
Assessment report

therapy such  as phototherapy,  psoralens and ultraviolet  A (PUVA),  and  retinoids, and  severe psoriatic 
arthritis in adult  patients. 
The  currently  approved indication  is:  severe recalcitrant  disabling  psoriasis,  which  is  not  adequately 
responsive to  other  forms  of  therapy  such  as  phototherapy,  psoralens and  ultraviolet  A  (PUVA),  and 
retinoids, and severe psoriatic arthritis in adult patients. 
Therefore, the  extension  of  indication  corresponds  to  the  addition  of  moderate  recalcitrant  disabling 
psoriasis population. 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Psoriasis is a  common, genetically determined,  inflammatory and proliferative disease of the  skin,  the 
most characteristic lesions consisting of chronic, sharply demarcated, dull-red scaly plaques, particularly 
on extensor parts of limbs and in the scalp. 
The pathogenesis of psoriasis is still incompletely understood.  
Psoriasis is a disabling disease and may even be life-threatening on rare occasions. 
This  is  an extension  of indication  to  include treatment  of  moderate plaque  psoriasis in  adults  who  are 
candidates for systemic therapy, based on literature. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Methotrexate  is  available  for  clinical  use  and  marketed  for  more  than  15  years  in  most  countries 
worldwide.  Methotrexate  25  mg/ml  solution  for  injection,  the  product  under  consideration,  is  being 
considered  a  hybrid  medicinal  product  of  the  originator  product  Lantarel®  FS  25  mg/ml  from  Pfizer 
(Germany). The product  under consideration  will  be supplied  in  prefilled pens containing  volumes in  a 
range of 0.3 ml to 1.0 ml. The document is prepared in accordance with the Notice to Applicants, Volume 
2B, incorporating the Common Technical Document (May 2008). 
Methotrexate is considered by many as first choice therapy among these slow-acting agents, also called 
disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD),  for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  [Visser et al 
(2009)  in Albrecht et al (2010)].  (1) 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
No SA has been sought. No new pre-clinical tests or clinical trials were conducted for this product. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GLP, GCP  
No new pre-clinical data or clinical trials were conducted for this product. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An ERA was not submitted with  this marketing authorization. The applicant considered that  the absence 
of study data for ERA is justified. It is considered that the use of the proposed product would not lead to 
an increase in environmental exposure to methotrexate: 
1.  The  requested  indication  for adults  is  already approved for  another  product  in  the  EU  (procedure: 
SE/H/0939). 
2. The product  is therefore intended as a substitute  for other identical  products already on the market. 
The approval of the proposed indication for Nordimet will not increase the total quantity of methotrexate 
released into the environment. 
The  Applicant  considered  that  this  ERA  report  is  an  addendum  to  the  initial  Environmental  Risk 
Assessment (version 2016/06).  Nevertheless, this  extension of  a new  indication  includes  the  inclusion 
of a  new  patient  population,  and  according to  question 2  of  “Questions  and answers document  on  the 
Guideline  on  the  environmental  risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products 
for  human  use” 
EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010  Rev.1.  26  May  2016  an  increase in  environmental exposure is  expected 
since the patient population  is increased. 
As a result, an  updated Environmental Risk Assessment Report was  presented by the MAH  upon CHMP  
request.  The sum  of  PEC  surface water  values for  all  therapeutic  indications  was  calculated  using  the 
maximum prescribed dose. The PECsurfacewater value calculated is considered acceptable, in line with 
the Questions and answers document of the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010  Rev. 1, 2016. 
The final PECsurfacewater does not exceed the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and experimental Log Kow of 
methotrexate is -1.855, far below the trigger value of 4.5. Therefore, a Phase II environmental fate 
and effect analysis is not considered necessary. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The ERA report is considered acceptable. As a result of the  above considerations, Nordimet is unlikely to 
represent a risk to the environment following its prescribed usage in patients. 
2.2.1.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this  application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of methotrexate. Considering the above data, methotrexate is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
No new  pre-clinical tests  or clinical  trials were conducted for this  product. New  studies are not  required 
as  the  methotrexate  solution  of  Lantarel  and  the  product  under  consideration  are  qualitatively  and 
quantitatively comparable. This application is based on published scientific literature.

GCP 
There were no new clinical studies to support the updated indication. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
This application is based on literature data. The below information summarises all available information 
based on literature data. 
Absorption 
Methotrexate  25  mg/ml  solution  for  injection  in  pre-filled  syringe  is  administered  intramuscularly, 
intravenously or subcutaneously. Since the test product Methotrexate 25 mg/ml solution for injection is 
to  be  administered  as  an  aqueous  parenteral  (subcutaneous,  intravenous  or  intramuscular)  solution 
containing  the  same  concentration  of  the  same  active  substance  and  the  same  excipients  in  similar 
amounts as the medicinal product currently approved no bioequivalence studies are required. 
Similarity with products from literature 
The following characteristics of the medicinal product applied for in this  procedure are comparable with 
the characteristics of the products used in the literature references and with approved products: 
- Administration route 
Methotrexate 25  mg/ml solution for injection, is administered via SC injection. Therefore, Methotrexate 
25  mg/ml solution  for  injection has the  same administration  route as  what  is recommended in  current 
evidence-based European Crohn’s disease consensus guidelines.

The concentration  of the  products used  in the  pivotal studies  by Feagan  et al  (1995)  (2),  Feagan et  al 
(2000)    (3)  was not  included  in  the references. Also, for the  pivotal  study by  Feagan et  al  (2014)  (4), 
the concentration of the products used was not included.  
Therefore, it  can be concluded that  the concentration  of the  products used in  the pivotal  studies is  the 
same as the concentration of the product submitted in this application. 
- Composition 
Based on the table below, the applicant concludes that the qualitative composition of the product under 
consideration is comparable to the reference product Lantarel and also to the products used in the pivotal 
studies by Feagan et al (1995, 2000,  2014). (2)  (3) (4) 
Table 2 
After oral  application,  methotrexate is  absorbed from the  gastrointestinal  tract.  When  administered  in 
low  doses (7.5  mg/m2  to  80  mg/m2  BSA),  methotrexate has  a  mean bioavailability of  approximately 
70%,  although  considerable inter-  and  intra-subject  variations  are  possible  (25-100%).  Plasma  peak 
concentrations  are  attained  within  1-2  hours.  Subcutaneous,  intravenous  and  intramuscular 
administration demonstrated similar bioavailability.  
Although oral administration seems to show some lower bioavailability when compared to the parenteral 
administration,  the  bioavailability of  methotrexate is 11%  to  15%  lower after oral  administration  than 
those  of  the  intramuscular  or  subcutaneous  administration,  nevertheless,  the  mean  absolute 
bioavailability  is  very  similar.  This  suggests  that  the  routes  of  low  dose  pulse  methotrexate 
administration  are  interchangeable.  After  oral  administration  the  drug  is  metabolized  by  intestinal 
bacteria. In the  liver, methotrexate is converted to  7-hydroxy-methotrexate. Less than  10%  of a dose 
of  methotrexate  is  oxidised  by hepatic  aldehyde oxidase to  7-hydroxy-methotrexate. Methotrexate  is 
excreted primarily as the unchanged drug by the kidneys through  a combination of glomerular filtration 
and active  tubular transport.  At  serum concentrations from 0.1-0.4  μmol/L,  tubular  secretion prevails. 
At methotrexate plasma concentrations of 0.6-1 μmol/L, renal clearance equals creatinine clearance. 
Distribution 
Approximately  50%  of  methotrexate  is  bound  to  serum  proteins.  Upon  being  distributed  into  body 
tissues,  high concentrations  particularly in liver, kidneys, and  spleen in form of  polyglutamates can be 
found,  which  can  be  retained for  weeks or  months.  When  administered  in  small  doses, methotrexate 
passes  into  the  body  fluids  in  minimal  amounts;  under  high  doses  (300  mg/kg  body  weight), 
Assessment report  
EMA/439575/2023  
Page 9/48 
 
 
 
 
 
concentrations between  4  and 7  μg/ml  have been  measured in  the  body fluids. Average terminal  half-
life is 6-7  hours and demonstrates considerable variation (3-17  hours). Half-life may be prolonged to  4 
times the normal length in patients  with third  spaces (pleural effusion, ascites). 
The  volume  of  distribution  of  methotrexate  is  0.87-1.43  L/kg,  which  corresponds  to  the  intracellular 
distribution  of  the  drug. In  blood, 30-70%  of methotrexate is  bound  to proteins,  almost  exclusively to 
albumin.  Distribution  of  low  doses  of  methotrexate in  body generally occurs  into  extravascular tissue 
compartments such  as the  kidneys, liver, and synovia generally with  a half-life  of 1  hour. Decrease of 
albumin  concentration  in  elderly  have  minimal  or  no  effect  on  MTX  binding.  Methotrexate  is  water-
soluble, and  its  distribution  may vary due  to  different intracellular  water volume. There are no  clinical 
relevance differences described. 
Elimination 
Approximately  10%  of  the  administered  methotrexate  is  metabolised  intra-hepatically.  The  major 
metabolite is 7-hydroxymethotrexate. 
Excretion  takes  place,  mainly  in  unchanged  form,  primarily  renal  via  glomerular  filtration  and  active 
secretion in the proximal tubulus.  Approx. 5-20% of methotrexate and 1-5% of 7-hydroxymethotrexate 
are eliminated via the bile. Pronounced enterohepatic blood flow exists. Clearance of methotrexate may 
decrease  after  long-term  administration.  Methotrexate  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  psoriasis 
vulgaris  and  severe psoriatic  arthritis  represents  long-term  treatment  where  dose should  be  reduced 
gradually to the lowest possible effective maintenance dose. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Renal  clearance  of  methotrexate  and  creatinine  clearance  decrease  after  long-term  methotrexate 
administration,  which  can  be  attributed  to  an  increase  in  plasma  adenosine  concentrations  in 
extracellular fluid  and  its  effect  on  adenosine receptors  in  kidneys.  Thus,  non-linear  elimination  may 
result  following the  administration  of 7.5-30  mg of  methotrexate and contribute  to  the  inter-individual 
variability in methotrexate concentrations. 
Special populations 
In  case of  renal  insufficiency, elimination  is  delayed significantly.  Impaired elimination  in  presence of 
hepatic insufficiency is not known. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Because of  their  effects on  the  gastrointestinal  mucosa, antineoplastics  have the  potential  to  interfere 
with  the  absorption of  drugs given orally. Antineoplastics that  have an immunosuppressant effect  may 
reduce the response to vaccines, and there is a possibility of generalised infection with  live vaccines. Use 
with live vaccines should generally be avoided. Many antineoplastics are inhibitors of certain isoenzymes 
of  cytochrome  P450  and  some  antineoplastics  are  also  metabolised  by  these  enzymes,  and  in 
consequence the possibility of interactions between antineoplastics, or between antineoplastics and other 
medication, cannot be discounted [Martindale (2020b]).   (5)  
The effects of methotrexate (MTX) may be enhanced by drugs that  decrease its renal excretion, such as 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and salicylates, probenecid, and some penicillins. Fatal 
toxicity  has occurred in  patients  given  NSAIDs  with  methotrexate.  Severe toxicity  has occurred rarely

when  cotrimoxazole  or  trimethoprim  was  given  with  methotrexate.  Use  with  other  myelotoxic, 
hepatotoxic, or nephrotoxic agents  may increase the  risk of toxicity.  Folic  acid and its  derivatives may 
decrease the  efficacy of  methotrexate, although  they  are often  used together  to  reduce methotrexate 
toxicity [Martindale (2020a)].  (6) 
Animal  studies  suggested  methotrexate  toxicity  may  be  increased  by  chloramphenicol,  para-
aminobenzoic acid, and  hypoglycaemics, but there does not appear to  be any evidence of this clinically 
[Martindale (2020a)].  (6) 
The  electronic  Medicines  Compendium-50  (2014)  (7)  lists  interactions  with  alcohol,  hepatotoxic  (e.g. 
leflunomide,  retinoids)  or  haematotoxic  medicinal  products  (e.g.  leflunomide,  azathioprine,  retinoids, 
sulfasalazine),  antibiotics,  medicinal  products  with  high  plasma  protein  binding  (salicylates, 
hypoglycaemics,  diuretics,  sulfonamides,  diphenylhydantoins,  tetracyclines,  chloramphenicol  and 
paminobenzoic  acid),  probenecid,  weak  organic  acids,  pyrazoles  and  NSAIDs,  sulfonamides, 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, folic acid,  sulfasalazine, mercaptopurine, proton-pump  inhibitors  (e.g. 
omeprazole, pantoprazole), theophylline and caffeine- or theophylline-containing beverages. 
MTX  interactions  with  NSAIDs  raise some concern.  These  most  frequently  result  in  mild  diminution  in 
creatinine clearance and are extremely rare causes of clinical toxicity. No great difference exists between 
aspirin and other NSAIDs with respect to renal toxicity [Furst (1995),  Rooney et al (1993), Furst (1990), 
Songsiridej et  al (1990)  in  Furst  (1997)]  (8).  Case reports of clinically  important  adverse events after 
NSAID  use  together  with  MTX  include  leukopenia  after  aspirin;  gastrointestinal  toxicity  after 
azapropazone,  indomethacin  and  naproxen;  bone  marrow  hypoplasia  or  aplasia  after  diclofenac, 
ketoprofen and  azapropazone; and  renal  failure  after  diclofenac,  indomethacin  and  ketoprofen  [Furst 
(1995)  in Furst  (1997)]  (8). Also, according to  Wallace et al (1993)  [in  Maryles et al (2003)]  (9),  some 
NSAID's  increase circulating  blood  levels of methotrexate, thereby  increasing the  risk of bone  marrow 
toxicity.  This  is  of  particular  importance  when  treating  older  patients  (who  can  be  predicted  to  have 
relatively  limited  renal  function)  with  arthritis.  However,  the  newer  data  suggest  that  some  anti-
inflammatories,  including  sulfasalazine,  ketoprofen  and  celecoxib,  have  no  known  interactions  with 
methotrexate and are therefore preferred in combination therapy [Tracy et al (1994), Karim et al (1999), 
O'Dell et al (2002)  in Maryles et al (2003)]. (9) 
There have been at least  seven documented cases of pancytopenia or other  bone marrow suppression 
after  the  combined  use  of  MTX  and  trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or  trimethoprim  [Furst  (1995)  in 
Furst  (1997)].  (8) The mechanism of this rare interaction is not well understood. 
Likewise, a  potential  interaction  between  MTX and  corticosteroids indicates  that  patients  on  long-term 
corticosteroids may have as much as a 20% decrease in MTX clearance, accompanied by a 24% decrease 
in  renal  clearance [Lafforgue  et  al  (1993)  in  Furst  (1997)]  (8).  This  potentially  interesting  interaction 
has been documented in a study of somewhat unconventional design and will  need corroboration. While 
the addition  of hydroxychloroquine to MTX results in fewer aspartate aminotransferase elevations in an 
observational study,  this  has not  yet been corroborated in  a prospective controlled study  and it  is also 
not clear that  decreasing the frequency or degree of AST elevations is protective against cirrhosis [Fries 
et  al  (1990)  in  Furst  (1997)]  (8).  A  positive  interaction  between  folic  acid  and  MTX  shows  that  the 
addition  of  1 mg/day  folic acid  decreases MTX-induced toxicity,  particularly  with  respect  to  stomatitis, 
and gastrointestinal  side-effects [Fries et  al (1990),  Morgan et  al (1985),  Morgan et  al  (2004)  in  Furst 
(1997)]  (8).

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Methotrexate  is  an  antimetabolite  that  exerts its  action  by  competing  with  folic  acid  for  the  enzyme 
dihydrofolate  reductase.  By  inhibiting  dihydrofolate  reductase  methotrexate  interferes  with  DNA 
synthesis by reducing purine and pyrimidine supply in rapidly dividing cells.  
Methotrexate 
is 
intracellularly  converted 
into  methotrexate  polyglutamates.  Methotrexate 
polyglutamates are inhibitors  of phosphoribosylamino-imidazolecarboxoamide (AICAR) transformylase. 
By inhibition  of  AICAR transformylase there is  intracellular accumulation  of AICAR, which  is  associated 
with  increased intracellular  adenosine release [Niehues  et  al  (2006)]  (10).  Adenosine acts  via specific 
membrane  receptors present  on  neutrophils,  lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, and  endothelial 
cells. Adenosine is primarily responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of low-dose therapy, while the 
antiproliferative  effect  (with  high-dose  methotrexate  for  the  treatment  of  tumors)  is  mediated  via 
inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase and interference with DNA  [Dolezalova et al (2005)  in Niehues et al 
(2006)]  (10).  A  study  has  shown  that  methotrexate  causes  a  dose-dependent  suppression  of  T-cell 
activation  and adhesion molecule expression. The  suppression of  intercellular adhesion molecule-l was 
adenosine  and  folate  dependent,  while  methotrexate  suppression  of  the  skin-homing  cutaneous 
lymphocyte-associated  antigen  was  adenosine  independent  [Johnston  et  al  (2005)  in  Niehues  et  al 
(2006)]  (10). 
MTX  and  MTX-polyglutamate  inhibit  the  enzymes DHFR  and  thymidylate  synthase,  as  well  as  other 
enzymes involved in de novo purine synthesis. In this way, they deplete the intracellular reserve of fully 
reduced  folates,  and  thus  affect  transmethylation  reactions.  Other  immunosuppressant  effects of  the 
drug  include  the  inhibition  of  T  and  B  lymphocytes,  suppression  of  proinflammatory  cytokines,  and 
inhibition  of chemotaxis of neutrophils  and  monocytes. In addition,  MTX  decreases DNA  synthesis and 
induces apoptosis in keratinocytes [Ranganathan and Mcleod (2006) and Saporito and Menter (2004) in 
Dogra  and  Mahajan  (2013)]  (11).  Because the  pathogenesis  of  psoriasis  involves an  aberrant  T-cell 
response, the immune system is a possible target for the antipsoriatic effects of MTX [Jeffes et al (1995) 
in  Dogra and Mahajan (2013)]  (11).  MTX interferes with  epidermal-cell kinetics, presumably through  a 
temporary  reduction  in  DNA  synthesis  [Heenen  et  al  (1998)  in  Dogra  and  Mahajan  (2013)]  (11).  It 
impairs complement C5a-induced skin response and leukotriene B4-induced intraepidermal penetration 
of granulocytes [Cronstein et al (1993)  in Dogra  and Mahajan (2013)]  (11).  Meephansan et al. [(2011) 
in Dogra and Mahajan (2013)]  (11)  reported that  MTX significantly reduces serum levels of interleukin-
22,  a  cytokine that  promotes keratinocyte proliferation and  dermal inflammation  in  psoriasis. Another 
mechanism  of  action  is  through  reduction  in  the  mRNA  levels  of  peroxisome  proliferator-  activated 
receptor  b/δ,  a  member  of  the  nuclear  hormone  receptor  superfamily  that  contributes  to  psoriasis 
pathogenesis [El  Eishi  et  al  (2011)  in  Dogra  and  Mahajan (2013)L]  (11).  Owing  to  the  inhibition  of  5-
aminoimidazole-4  carboxamide  ribonucleoside  (AICAR)  transformylase,  MTX  induces  the  release  of 
adenosine,  which  inhibits  generation  of  oxygen  free  radicals  by  polymorphonuclear  cells  (PMNs), 
adhesion  of  PMNs,  macrophage-induced  modulation  of  tumour  necrosis  factor-a,  and  proliferation  of 
lymphocytes, explaining the anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory effects of MTX [Cronstein (2010) 
in  Dogra and  Mahajan (2013)]  (11).  Caffeine, a poorly selective adenosine receptor antagonist,  blocks 
the anti-inflammatory effects of adenosine in vitro, and thus might interfere with  the therapeutic actions 
of MTX [Silke et al (2001)  and Nesher et al (2003)  in Dogra and Mahajan (2013)]  (11). Adenosine may 
be  responsible  for  some  of  the  AEs  associated  with  MTX,  including  hepatotoxicity,  fatigue  and 
somnolence;  these  may  result  from  its  action  on  A1  and  A2B  receptors,  which  stimulates  hepatic 
steatosis [Penz et  al (2009)  in  Dogra and Mahajan (2013)]  (11),  and its  action on A2A receptors plays 
a role in the development of hepatic fibrosis.

Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Given the proposal to  include the moderate recalcitrant disabling psoriasis population in the therapeutic 
indication,  it  is  relevant, from a  pharmacodynamic point  of view,  to  understand  the  differences in  the 
severity classification. 
According to an expert consensus, the definition of moderate-to-severe disease was ‘(PASI > 10 or body 
surface area [BSA] > 10)  AND  DLQI  > 10’,  and for mild psoriasis ‘PASI ≤  10 AND  BSA ≤  10 AND  DLQI  
≤ 10’. 
The International Psoriasis Council (IPC) ran a modified Delphi  consensus process among its counsellors 
to  categorize psoriasis severity and to redefine access criteria to systemic therapy. The most preferred 
statement  from  the  IPC  survey  ‘rejects  the  mild,  moderate  and  severe  categories  in  favour  of  a 
dichotomous definition: Psoriasis patients should be classified as either candidates for topical therapy or 
candidates for systemic therapy; the latter  are patients  who meet at  least one of the  following criteria: 
(a) body surface area >10%, (b) disease involving special areas and (c) failure of topical therapy’. 
The  severity  definition  that  reached  the  second  highest  approval  rate  did  provide  a  dichotomous 
distinction:  ‘(a) mild or mild-to-moderate: that  which can be adequately controlled with  topical therapy 
alone;  (b)  moderate-to-severe  or  severe:  that  which  requires  phototherapy  or  systemic  therapy 
(including  biologics).’ 
A definition using precise numbers got only moderate support from the IPC counsellors, defining mild 
as BSA 0–5% with special areas not affected and with DLQI < 5, defining moderate as BSA 5–10% or 
special areas affected; or BSA 1–5% and DLQI 5–10, and defining severe as >10% BSA or special 
areas affected; or BSA 5%-10% and DLQI > 10. 
The majority of available data with methotrexate provided by the MAH is referred to moderate-to-severe 
psoriasis  or  to  severe psoriasis.  Clinical  guidelines  often  do  not  differentiate  moderate  from  severe 
psoriasis  and  from  a  Clinical  Pharmacodynamic  point  of  view  there  is  a  lack  of  reliable  PD 
endpoints/biomarkers to evaluate the difference of the methotrexate effect in these types of severity. 
According to  scientific  and clinical  guidelines, the  most  established parameter to  measure the  severity 
of skin symptoms in psoriasis is  the Psoriasis Area and  Severity Index (PASI). Health-related quality of 
life  (HRQoL)  is  an  important  aspect  of  psoriasis, not  only  in  defining  disease  severity but  also  as  an 
outcome  measure in  clinical  trials.  The Dermatology  Life  Quality  Index (DLQI)  is  the  most  commonly 
used score for assessing the impact of psoriasis on HRQoL. 
Criteria to  further ‘upgrade’ mild  disease to  moderate-to-severe were defined as  major involvement of 
visible areas, major involvement of the  scalp, involvement of genitals,  onycholysis or onychodystrophy 
of at least two fingernails, presence of itch leading to scratching and the presence of recalcitrant plaques. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
The PK/PD relationship of methotrexate has been extensively characterized and from a 
pharmacodynamic point of view, given the variation proposed and maintenance of dose for the new 
population included in the  indication, an alteration of this PK/PD relationship is not foreseen.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  clinical  pharmacology of  methotrexate is  well  described due  to  its  extensive and  long  use.  In  the 
present  application,  the  MAH  was able  to  sufficiently  substantiate  that  there  is  similarity  between  the 
product from the MAH  and the ones described in the supportive literature showing efficacy and safety in 
patients  with  moderate to  severe recalcitrant disabling psoriasis, which  is not adequately responsive to 
other forms of therapy such as phototherapy, psoralens and ultraviolet A (PUVA), and retinoids. 
The  applicant  provided  evidence of  similarity  in  their  product  to  several  others  used  in  clinical  trials 
described in the literature for Crohn’s disease. The applicant also provided a list of studies in the current 
indication  where  IV/IM/SC  administrations  were  used.  Although,  again,  no  reference  to  specific 
formulations were made, taking  in  consideration that  most  resulted in  similar conclusions independent 
of  the  route  of  administration  (that  also  included  oral),  there  is  a  strong  rational  for  considering  the 
current formulation equivalent to the ones used in the reported clinical trials. 
The multiple DDI  described for MTX are present in the SmPC. 
Pharmacodynamics 
With this submission, the MAH proposes to add a new indication moderate to severe recalcitrant disabling 
psoriasis, which is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy such as phototherapy, psoralens 
and ultraviolet A (PUVA), and retinoids, and severe psoriatic arthritis in adult patients. 
In a general and non-specific way, the  studies provided support for the use of methotrexate in the new 
patient populationcovered by this extension of indication. The MAH was asked to clarify the difference in 
magnitude  of  PASI  reduction  in  moderate  vs  severe  recalcitrant  disabling  psoriasis  population.  A 
comprehensive literature  review  was  submitted  by  the  MAH  organising  the  findings  in  terms  of  PASI 
characterization of severity. The MAH has further reviewed the literature in order to scientifically support 
the interpretation of the correlation of PASI with  disease severity and has also clarified the difference in 
magnitude of PASI reduction in moderate vs severe recalcitrant disabling psoriasis population. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant has provided sufficient data and clarifications to support the proposed extension of 
indication.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Psoriasis is an  inflammatory disease of  the  skin associated with  increased epidermal proliferation. The 
aetiology of the disease is unknown, but there seems to be a genetic predisposition. The goal of therapy 
in  the  treatment  of  psoriasis  is  to  decrease  the  rate  of  epidermal  proliferation  and  the  underlying 
inflammation [Tung et al (1990)]  (12). 
The Eurogioderm guideline for the  systemic treatment of  psoriasis suggests methotrexate as preferred 
first-line therapy in patients with  psoriasis and ischemic heart disease if other patient  characteristics do 
not preclude its use [Nast et al. (2022)] (13). It also suggests that methotrexate, acitretin and apremilast 
should be considered as treatment in patients with  psoriasis and advanced congestive heart failure. The 
guideline does not recommend the use of methotrexate in moderate to severe psoriasis for patients that 
also have diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome or are pregnant or trying to become pregnant [Nast 
et al. (2022)]  (13). 
Table 3 Overview of main recommendations (flow chart) and recommendations for specific treatment 
circumstances (decision grid I+II) [Nast et al. (2020)]. 
Placebo-controlled trials designed to test the  efficacy of methotrexate for psoriatic arthritis  were carried 
out since 1964 [Black et al (1964)  in Warren et al (2008)] (14).  In addition  to improvement of arthritis,

a  significant  improvement in  psoriasis was observed. Efficacy was  assessed using  different  doses and 
dosing regimens that are used nowadays.  
Although  the  literature  is  sparse,  there  are  several more recent  studies  demonstrating  methotrexate 
efficacy for psoriasis. More recently, methotrexate has been compared directly with cyclosporine therapy 
in  a  randomized  controlled  trial  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  psoriasis.  At  16  weeks  of 
treatment, there was no significant  advantage of one drug over the other with  a psoriasis area severity 
index (PASI) 75  of  60%  and  71 %  for methotrexate  and  cyclosporine, respectively. However, 28%  of 
patients randomized for methotrexate dropped out  of the study because of elevated liver enzyme levels 
vs 2%  (elevated bilirubin)  in  the  cyclosporine group [Heydendael et  al  (2003)  in  Warren et  al  (2008)] 
(14).  There have been differing  experiences in  success rates  of treating  pustular  variants of  psoriasis, 
some claiming  a higher  success rate in  these  subgroups and  others  lower [Collins  et  al  (1992),  Baker 
(1976)  in Warren et al (2008)] (14). 
A 26-year retrospective study evaluated 150  severe psoriatics chronically treated with  weekly low-dose 
methotrexate. Although 76% reported "good" success with  methotrexate, 61% experienced side effects, 
including  abnormal  liver  function  tests,  bone  marrow  toxicity,  nausea  and  other  gastrointestinal 
symptoms, and hair loss [Haustein et al (2000) in Maryles et al (2003)] (9). 
Methotrexate is an effective treatment for psoriatic arthritis at  doses similar to  those used for psoriasis, 
with  lower doses being possible in the  maintenance phase of therapy [Zachariae et al (1987) in  Warren 
et  al  (2008)]  (14).  In  addition,  methotrexate  can  significantly  improve  psoriatic  nail  dystrophy  in  a 
proportion of patients [Nyfors (1978) in Warren et al (2008)] (14). 
In  the study  by  Heydendael with  88  patients  (grade of  evidence A2),  monotherapy with  methotrexate 
was  compared  to  monotherapy  with  cyclosporine.  Using  a  PASI  reduction  of  90%  as  an  outcome 
measure, the  study  showed  that  a  higher  percentage of  patients  treated  with  methotrexate  achieved 
total  remission  (40%)  compared  to  those  taking  cyclosporine (33%).  For  a  PASI  reduction  of  75%, 
however, cyclosporine demonstrated higher  efficacy, with  71%  of  patients  achieving  partial  remission 
compared to 60% of patients taking methotrexate [Heyendael et al (2003) in JEADV (2009)]  (15). 
Of  11  studies  investigating  the  efficacy of  methotrexate  monotherapy  in  psoriasis  vulgaris, a  total  of 
three fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the guidelines. After 16 weeks of treatment with methotrexate, 
approximately 60% of patients displayed a 75% reduction in PASI (level of evidence 2) [JEADV (2009)] 
(15).Clinical  experience with  methotrexate is  much greater than  the  documentation of the  efficacy and 
safety of methotrexate therapy in clinical studies. Clinical experience has demonstrated that the efficacy 
of  methotrexate  continues  to  increase with  longer  treatment.  As  a  result,  methotrexate  represents, 
above all, an  effective therapeutic  option  for long-term  therapy. Its  clinical application  is  restricted by 
severe  adverse  drug  reactions,  including  especially  hepatotoxicity,  bone  marrow  suppression, 
gastrointestinal  ulcerations,  and  very  rare, but  severe idiosyncratic  reactions.  However,  with  precise 
patient  selection, thorough  patient  information, strict  monitoring, use  of the lowest  effective dose, and 
the  additional  administration  of  folic  acid,  an  acceptable  safety  profile  can  also  be  attained  for 
methotrexate therapy [JEADV (2009)] (15). 
Since the  publication  of the  European S3-Guidelines on  the  systemic treatment  of psoriasis vulgaris in 
2009,  further  clinical trials  in moderate-to-severe psoriasis have been conducted  and the  Eurogioderm 
guideline for the systemic treatment of psoriasis [Nast et al. (2022)]  (13) has provided recommendation 
on the  use of methotrexate in  moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Table 2  shows the  various clinical  studies 
in  which  MTX  has  been  used  as  monotherapy  in  moderate  to  severe  psoriasis  [Haustein  and  Rutter 
(2000),  Heydendael et  al. (2003),  Ranjan et  al.  (2007),  Flytström  et  al. (2008),  Saurat et  al.  (2008),

Greebe et al  (1995)  in Dogra and  Mahajan (2013)]  (11).  The response to  monotherapy is  usually seen 
in  1–4  weeks, with  at  least 50%  reduction  in  PASI in  70–80%  of  treated patients.  MTX  has also been 
combined with several other systemic or topical agents to decrease its total cumulative dose and hence 
its side-effects, and also to increase the efficacy of the treatment [Dogra and Mahajan (2013)]. (11)

Appani  et  al  (2019)    (16)  performed  an  open-label,  prospective  study  of  patients  satisfying  the 
ClASsification  criteria  for  Psoriatic  ARthritis  study  (CASPAR)  criteria  for  psoriatic  arthritis  (PsA)  who 
received MTX  in  doses of ≥15  mg/week throughout  the follow-up  period of  9  months.  Disease activity 
was  assessed across various  domains by  tender  and  swollen  joint  count,  physician  and  patient  global 
assessment, DAS-28  ESR, Clinical Disease Activity Index for PsA (cDAPSA), Leeds Dactylitis Instrument 
basic, Leeds Enthesitis  Index (LEI),  Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Minimal  Disease Activity 
and  HAQ (CRD  Pune  version) at  baseline and at  3,  6  and 9  months  of  follow-up.  Response to  therapy 
was assessed by EULAR DAS-28 ESR, cDAPSA response, HAQ response and PASI75. MTX dose escalation 
and the use of combination DMARDS were dictated by disease activity. 
A total  of 73  patients were included, with mean (SD) age 44  (9.7) years and a mean (SD)  PASI score of 
4.58  (6.19)  at  baseline. The  mean  (SD)  dose  of  MTX  used  was  17.5  (3.8)  mg/week. Seven patients  
received additional  DMARDS  (LEF/SSZa).  At  the  end  of  9  months,  significant  improvement (P<  0.05) 
was  noted  in  the  tender  joint  count,  swollen  joint  count,  global  activity,  DAS-28  ESR,  cDAPSA, Leeds 
Dactylitis  Index basic, LEI, PASI and HAQ. Major cDAPSA response was achieved in 58.9%  of patients. 
EULAR  DAS-28 moderate and good response was achieved in  74%  and 6.8%  of patients,  respectively. 
Minimal  disease activity  was  achieved in  63%  of patients.  A PASI75  response and  HAQ  response was 
achieved in 67.9% and 65.8% of patients, respectively [Appani et al. (2019)]. (16)

all  adults  with  plaque  psoriasis in  whom  MTX  treatment  was performed by Tournier  et  al  (2019)  (17). 
The efficacy criterion was achievement of PASI 75 at week (W) 12/16.  The impact of demographic data, 
psoriasis characteristics (duration, topography, rheumatism), dosage (W12/16 dosage, cumulative dose 
after  4  weeks), and  mode  of  administration  (subcutaneous  vs.  oral, concomitant  use of  folic  acid)  on 
efficacy  was  evaluated.  Intention-to-treat  (ITT),  per  protocol  (PP),  and  multivariate  analyses  were 
performed.

plaque psoriasis (PASI score of 13.1  ± 7.8 at  baseline) were included. 99  patients were not  analysed at 
W12/16  (16  because  of  inefficacy,  16  because of  intolerance,  56  were  lost  to  follow-up  or  had  data 
missing).  PASI 75  was  achieved in  98  patients,  with  efficacy of  38.3%  in  the  intention  to  treat  (ITT) 
analysis and 58.3% in the PP analysis. In the  ITT analysis, absence of previous use of cyclosporine (P = 
0.01)  and  a cumulative  dose of MTX  >  60  mg after  4  weeks (P<  0.0001)  were associated with  higher 
PASI  75  rates.  In  the  PP  analysis,  only  absence  of  previous  use  of  cyclosporine  (P  =  0.0009)  was 
associated  with  a  better  PASI  75  results.  There  was  no  association  between  PASI  75  and  patient 
characteristics  (including  body  mass  index),  clinical  aspects  of  psoriasis,  route  of  administration,

combination with folic acid, or W12/16  dose. Adverse events were reported by 34.8% of patients.  These 
consisted  mainly  of  digestive  disorders  (nausea,  abdominal  pain),  asthenia  and  moderate  hepatic 
cytolysis.  The  frequency  of  adverse  events  was  correlated  with  methotrexate  dosage.  The  authors 
concluded that  their results were consistent with  the data in the literature [Tournier et al. (2019)].  (17) 
Warren  et  al  (2017)    (18)  performed a  prospective,  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled,  phase  3  trial  (METOP)  at  16  sites  in  Germany,  France,  the  Netherlands,  and  the  United  
Kingdom. Eligible  patients  were aged 18  years or older, had a diagnosis of  chronic plaque psoriasis for 
at least 6  months before baseline, had currently moderate to severe disease (mean (SD) PASI score at 
baseline  15.4  (5.9)),  and  were  methotrexate  treatment  naive.  Participants  were  randomly  assigned 
(3:1),  via a  computer-generated random number  sequence integrated  into  an  electronic data  capture 
system, to  receive either methotrexate at  a  starting  dose of  17.5  mg/week or placebo for  the  first  16 
weeks, followed by methotrexate treatment of all patients up to 52  weeks (methotrexate–methotrexate 
vs  placebo–methotrexate  groups).  Dose  escalation  to  22.5  mg/week  was  allowed  after  8  weeks  of 
methotrexate treatment  if  patients  had  not  achieved at  least a  50%  reduction  in  baseline PASI score, 
with  corresponding volume  increases in  placebo  injections.  Treatment  was  combined  with  folic  acid  5 
mg/week.  Group  allocation  was  concealed  from  participants  and  investigators  from  the  time  of 
randomisation until  an  interim  database lock at  week 16,  and  was  open label  from week 16  onwards, 
with  no masking of participants or investigators. The primary efficacy endpoint was a 75%  reduction in 
PASI score (PASI 75) from baseline to week 16. Between Feb 22, 2013, and May 13, 2015, 120 patients 
were  randomly assigned  to  receive methotrexate  (n=91)  or  placebo  (n=29).  At  week 16,  a  PASI  75 
response was  achieved  in  37  (41%)  patients  in  the  methotrexate  group  compared with  three  (10%) 
patients  in  the  placebo  group  (relative  risk  3.93,  95%  CI  1.31–11.81;  p=0.0026).  Subcutaneous 
methotrexate was generally well  tolerated; no patients  died or had serious infections, malignancies, or 
major adverse cardiovascular events. Serious adverse events were recorded in three (3%) patients who 
received methotrexate  for  the  full  52-week  treatment  period.  The  authors  remark that  their  findings 
show a favourable 52-week risk–benefit profile of subcutaneous methotrexate in patients with  psoriasis 
[Warren et al. (2017)]. (18)

Noor et  al (2017)  compared the  treatment efficacy and safety of methotrexate with  acitretin  in chronic 
plaque psoriasis. A total of 142 patients were enrolled, 71 patients in each group. Patients were randomly 
divided  into  two  groups,  A and  B  by  lottery  method.  They  were given  methotrexate  (25  mg  injection 
deep I/M once weekly) or acitretin (0.4mg/kg orally daily). At the end of 24 weeks, response to treatment 
was  evaluated  in  terms  of  reduction  in  PASI  score.  Safety  of  treatment  was  accessed  in  terms  of 
laboratory  investigations  i.e.,  transaminase,  triglycerides,  platelets  and  white  blood  cells  during 
treatment.  In  the  methotrexate  group,  an  excellent  response (PASI-75%)  was  noted  in  38  (53.5%), 
good response (PASI-50%) in 13 (18.3%),  fair response (less than 50% reduction in PASI) in 4 (5.6%), 
and  no response was  observed in  1  (1.4%)  patient.  In  acitretin  treated  group excellent response was 
noted  in 18  (25.3%),  good response in 27  (38.0%),  fair response in 8  (11.2%),  and no  response was 
observed  in  5  (7.04%)  of  patients.  The  authors  concluded  that  methotrexate  is  a  better  option  for 
treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis than acitretin [Noor et al. (2017)] (19). 
West  et  al  (2016)  performed a  meta-analysis on  efficacy in  psoriasis,  according to  PRISMA checklist. 
Eleven studies met  the  criteria for study design  and passed a Cochrane risk of bias  analysis. Based on 
this dataset, 45.2% [95% confidence interval 34.1-60.0]  of patients achieve 75% reduction of PASI from 
baseline (PASI75) at primary endpoint (12 or 16 weeks, respectively, n = 705 patients across all studies), 
compared to a calculated PASI75 of 4.4 [3.5-5.6]  for placebo, yielding a relative risk of 10.2 [95% C.I. 
7.1-14.7].  The figure above graphically summarises the PASI75 reported in the MTX-only treatment arm 
at  12  or 16  weeks,  respectively, in  each of  the  studies  analysed. As  evident  from the  figure,  there  is 
notable heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 92.7%) 
The pooled PASI75 estimate calculated across all studies  yielded at  PASI75 of 45.2%  (95%  confidence 
interval 34.1%–  60.0%) compared to a calculated PASI75 of 4.4% for placebo (95% confidence interval 
3.5%–  5.6%)  (Table  6).  This  yields  a  relative  risk of  10.2  (95%  confidence  interval  7.1–  14.7).  The 
authors conclude that  across published MTX studies on psoriasis, approximately 40% of patients achieve 
PASI75 between weeks 12– 16.

Forest plot  of efficacy (PASI75 outcome reported at 12  or 16 weeks) of MTX in  psoriasis as reported in 
the published clinical studies analysed by West et al (2016) (20). 
Von  Drateln  et  al.  (2015)  (21)  conducted  a  double-blind  clinical  trial  comparing  pioglitazone  versus 
methotrexate in  two  groups of  adult  patients  with  psoriasis. Patients  were scheduled  every month  for 
two  months,  the  PASI (Psoriasis Area Severity Index) were assessed and  complete blood count,  blood 
chemistry and liver profile were taken every time. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney 
U, Wilcoxon signed-rank test and χ2 test. A total of 9 patients were included, 4 in the pioglitazone group 
and  5  in  the  methotrexate  group.  The  patients  in  the  methotrexate  group  reduced  their  PASI  score 
significantly  after  two  months  of  treatment  (p  =  0.03),  but  not  the  pioglitazone  group  (p  =  0.3)  No 
adverse effects were reported in either group [Von Drateln et al. (2015)] (21). 
Barker et al (2011)  (22) compared the efficacy and safety of infliximab vs. methotrexate (MTX) in adults 
with  moderate-to-severe plaque  psoriasis.  MTX-naïve  patients  (n  =  868)  were  randomized  3  :  1  to 
receive infliximab 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22 or MTX 15 mg weekly with a dose increase to 20 
mg weekly at week 6 if the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) response was < 25%. At week 16, 
patients  with  <  PASI  50  response could  switch  treatment  groups.  The  primary efficacy endpoint  was 
PASI 75  response at  week 16.  Major secondary efficacy endpoints  were PASI 75  response at  week 26, 
and the  proportion of patients  achieving a Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) score of cleared (0)  or 
minimal (1)  at  weeks 16  and 26.  Others included Dermatology  Life Quality Index, 36-Item  Short Form 
Health Survey, and PGA, PASI 50, PASI 75 and PASI 90 responses over time. The primary endpoint was 
achieved by a significantly greater proportion of infliximab-treated patients (508 ⁄653, 78%) than MTX-
treated patients  (90 ⁄215,  42%;  P < 0.001).  Key secondary endpoints also were achieved by a greater 
proportion of  infliximab-treated patients.  Similar responses were observed at  week 26  in  patients  who 
switched  from  MTX  to  infliximab  at  week  16.  Overall adverse  event  (AE)  incidence  was  comparable 
between  groups,  but  incidence  of  serious  and  severe AEs  was  slightly  higher  in  the  infliximab  group 
[Barker et al. (2011)] (22) 
Fallah  Arani et  al  (2011)  conducted  a randomized controlled  trial  comparing the  effectiveness and  the 
adverse events of methotrexate and fumarates. Sixty patients with  moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris 
were randomly assigned to  treatment  for 16 weeks with  either methotrexate (30  patients,  mean ±  SD 
PASI score at baseline of 14.7±3.0;  15 mg per week) or fumarates (30  patients, mean ± SD PASI score 
at  baseline  of  18.0±6.9;  30  mg,  followed  by  120  mg  according  to  a  standard  progressive  dosage 
regimen) and were followed up for 4  weeks. The primary endpoint with  respect to  the efficacy was  the 
difference in  mean change from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) after 12  weeks of 
treatment.  The  study was  powered to  detect a  difference of  five points.  Analyses were by  intention  to 
treat. Six patients were excluded because five were not eligible and one withdrew consent. Two patients 
in the methotrexate group and one in the fumarate group dropped out during the 12 weeks of treatment 
because of non- appearance at the outpatient  clinic. In total, 25 patients in the methotrexate group and 
26 in the fumarate group were evaluated in the primary analysis. After 12 weeks of treatment, the mean 
±  SD  PASI  decreased  from  14.5  ±  3.0  at  baseline  to  6.7  ±  4.5  in  the  25  patients  treated  with 
methotrexate,  whereas  it  decreased from  18.1  ±  7.0  to  10.5  ±  6.7  in  the  26  patients  treated  with 
fumarates.  After  adjustment  for  baseline  values,  the  absolute  difference  (fumarates  minus 
methotrexate) in the mean values at 12 weeks was 1.4 (95%  confidence interval) 2.0 to 4.7; P = 0.417) 
[Fallah Arani et al. (2011)]  (23). 
Reich et  al. (2011)  performed a 52-week  clinical  trial,  in  which  317  patients  with  moderate-to-severe 
psoriasis randomly assigned to briakinumab, at a dose of 200 mg at weeks 0 and 4 and 100 mg at week 
8  and every 4 weeks thereafter (154  patients),  or methotrexate at  a  dose of 5  to  25  mg  weekly (163 
patients).  The  primary end  points  were the  percentages of patients  with  at least  75%  improvement in 
the  score  on  the  psoriasis  area-and-severity index  (PASI)  at  weeks  24  and  52  and  a  score  on  the

physician’s global assessment of 0 (clear; i.e., no apparent disease) or 1 (minimal disease) at weeks 24 
and 52. A total of 248  patients were enrolled in an ongoing 160-week open-label continuation  study. At 
baseline, the  mean ± SD PASI score of the patients  in the briakinumab group and methotrexate groups 
were  18.4±6.7  and  17.8±6.1,  respectively.  At  week  24,  a  total  of  81.8%  of  the  patients  in  the 
briakinumab group versus 39.9% in the methotrexate group had at least 75% improvement in the PASI 
score,  and  80.5%  versus  34.4%  had  a  score  of  0  or  1  on  the  physician’s  global  assessment.  The 
corresponding percentages at week 52  were 66.2%  versus 23.9%  with  at least a  75% improvement in 
the  PASI score and  63.0%  versus 20.2%  with  a score of  0  or  1  on  the  physician’s global  assessment 
(P<0.001  for all  comparisons). During  the 52-week  study, serious adverse events occurred in  9.1%  of 
the  patients  in  the  briakinumab  group  (12.9  events  per  100  patient-years)  and  in  6.1%  in  the 
methotrexate  group  (10.6  events  per  100  patient-years).  Serious  infections  occurred  in  2.6%  of  the 
patients  in the briakinumab group (4.1  events per 100  patient-years) and in  1.8%  in the methotrexate 
group (2.7 events per 100 patient-years); cancers occurred in 1.9%  (2.0 events per 100 patient-years) 
versus 0% [Reich et al. (2011)] (24). 
Akhyani  et  al.  (2010)    (25)  compared  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  mycophenolate  mofetil  (MMF)  vs. 
methotrexate (MTX) for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. Thirty-eight consecutive patients with 
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) >10  were randomly assigned for 12 weeks of treatment  with 
either  MTX  (18  patients;  initial  dose,  7.5  mg⁄  week)  or  MMF  (20  patients;  dose;  2  g  ⁄day)  and  were 
followed for 12  weeks after discontinuing  the  treatment.  The differences between the  two groups were 
analysed  at  the  end  of  treatment  and  follow-up  comparing  with  baseline  values.  After  12  weeks  of 
treatment,  the mean ± SD  score for the  PASI decreased from 16.46  ±  5.29  at baseline to 3.17  ± 2.35 
among 15  patients  treated  with  MTX,  whereas the score decreased from  17.43  ±  7.42  to  3.97  ±  5.95 
among  17  patients  treated with  MMF  (P  >0.05).  Twelve weeks after  discontinuing  the  treatment,  the 
scores were 4.77  ± 3.52  and 5.94  ±  4.27,  respectively (P >0.05).  PASI-75 were achieved in 58.8%  of 
patients  in  MMF  group  and  73.3%  in  MTX  group  (P  >  0.05).  Three  months  after  discontinuing  the 
treatment,  PASI-75 remained in  33.3%  of  patients  in  MMF  and  53.3%  of MTX  group  (P  >  0.05).  Both 
drugs were well tolerated, and side-effects were minor and transient [Akhyani et al. (2010)] (25). 
Ho et al (2010)  performed a randomized placebo-controlled trial comparing methotrexate, placebo, and 
traditional  Chinese medicine (TCM)  in  terms  of efficacy, safety, and quality  of  life for the  treatment  of 
psoriasis.  In  total,  61  patients  with  moderate  to  severe plaque  psoriasis  were randomized  to  receive 
treatment  with  methotrexate,  TCM  or  placebo  for  6  months.  The  primary  outcome  measure was  the 
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), and secondary outcome measures were the Physician’s Global 
Assessment (PGA) and the  Psoriasis Disability  Index (PDI).  In all, 50  patients completed the  study and 
were included  in the  analysis. For  the patients  who  completed the  study,  mean ± SD  PASI at  baseline 
was 22.0 ± 11.3 in the methotrexate group, 18.9 ± 8.2 in the TCM group and 20.4 ± 10.8 in the placebo 
group. Dropout  rates were highest  in the  TCM  group. For the  patients  who completed the  study, mean 
±  SD  PASI at  baseline was 22.0  ±  11.3  in  the methotrexate  group, 18.9  ± 8.2  in  the  TCM  group and 
20.4  ± 10.8  in  the placebo group. After 6 months  of treatment,  the scores were 5.7  ± 8.5,  16.0  ± 9.8 
and  13.9  ±  10.1,  an  improvement of  73.9%,  15.1%  and  32%,  respectively. There  was  a  significant 
difference between  the  three groups,  with  methotrexate showing  greater effectiveness than  the  other 
two groups. No significant difference was found between the TCM and placebo groups. The methotrexate 
group  also  had  greater  improvement  when  assessed  using  the  PGA  and  PDI.  Adverse Events  were 
reported  by 65%  of  the  MTX  group,  48%  of  the  TCM  group  and  30%  of  the  placebo group.  Nausea, 
vomiting  and  increased liver enzyme levels were common  in  the  MTX  group. The  TCM  group  reported 
infections  and  gastrointestinal  side-effects,  and  a  few  developed abnormalities  in  liver  function.  The 
placebo group also reported infections and had increased liver enzymes. [Ho et al. (2010)] (26).

Ranjan  et  al  (2007)  (27)  performed a  small  comparative trial  where  two  groups of  15  patients  each, 
having moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, were given weekly doses of methotrexate (15–20 
mg/week) or hydroxycarbamide (3–4.5 g/week). The severity of psoriasis was defined by a score of >10 
on  the  Psoriasis  Area and  Severity  Index (PASI)  scale  and  involvement  of  at  least  20%  of  the  body 
surface area. The clinical response was assessed by the percentage reduction in the baseline PASI scores 
for the next 12 weeks. 
At  the  end  of  12  weeks,  the  mean  PASI  score  in  the  methotrexate  group  was  5.69±5.93 
(baseline=25.11±11.75),  while  it  was  11.44±6.63  (baseline=22.99±5.66)  in  the  hydroxycarbamine 
group.  The  mean  percentage  reduction  in  the  PASI  score  at  12  weeks  was  77.28±18.80  in  the 
methotrexate  group  and  48.47±26.53  in  the  hydroxycarbamine group.  Ten  (66.66%)  patients  in  the 
methotrexate group achieved >75%  reduction in  the PASI score, while in  the hydroxycarbamide group 
only  two  (13.33%)  patients  showed  similar  results,  signifying  that  methotrexate  leads  to  a  faster 
clearance of  the disease. The methotrexate-related side effects, however, were also higher  [Ranjan et 
al. (2007)].  (27)

Table 8 Baseline characteristics and psoriasis severity score [Ranjan et al. (2007)]. (27) 
Heydendael  et  al  (2003)  conducted  a  randomized,  controlled  trial  comparing  methotrexate  and 
cyclosporine in  terms  of  effectiveness,  side  effects,  and  the  quality  of  life.  A  total  of  88  patients  with 
moderate-to-severe  psoriasis  were  randomly  assigned  to  treatment  for  16  weeks  with  either 
methotrexate (44 patients, PASI score; initial dose, 15 mg per week) or cyclosporine (44 patients; initial 
dose, 3  mg per kilogram of body weight per day) and were followed for another 36 weeks. The primary 
outcome was the  difference between groups in  the psoriasis area-and-severity index after 16  weeks of 
treatment, after adjustment for base-line values; scores were determined in a blinded fashion by trained 
observers. 
Two  patients  were  excluded  from  the  analysis  after  randomization  because  they  were  found  to  be 
ineligible,  and  one  patient  withdrew  his  consent.  Twelve  patients  in  the  methotrexate  group  had  to 
discontinue  treatment  because  of  reversible elevations  in  liver-enzyme  levels,  and  1  patient  in  the 
cyclosporine group had  to do  so because of  an elevation in the  bilirubin  level, but  all 13  were included 
in the  analysis. After 16  weeks of treatment,  the  mean (±SE)  score for the psoriasis area-and-severity 
index decreased from 13.4±3.6  at  base line to  5.0±0.7  among 43  patients  treated with  methotrexate, 
whereas the  score decreased from 14.0±6.6  to  3.8±0.5  among  42  patients  treated  with  cyclosporine. 
After adjustment for base-line values, the mean absolute difference in  values at  16 weeks was 1.3 (95 
percent  confidence interval, –0.2  to  2.8;  P=0.09).  The  physician’s global  assessment of  the  extent  of 
psoriasis, the  time to  and the  rates of remission, and  the quality  of life  were similar in  the two  groups 
[Heydendael et al. (2003)] (28). 
Cardiovascular comorbidity 
Moderate-to-severe  psoriasis  is  associated  with  several  well-established  cardiovascular  risk  factors 
including  obesity,  hypertension,  diabetes,  dyslipidaemia,  and  metabolic  syndrome  [Boehncke  et  al 
(2011) in Nast et al. (2022)]  (13). Psoriasis severity has been linked to a higher prevalence of these risk 
factors.  However,  there  is  conflicting  evidence  as  to  whether  psoriasis  is  associated  with  increased 
cardiovascular events and whether psoriasis itself represents is an independent cardiovascular risk factor 
[Kimball et  al (2012)  Nast  et al.  (2022)]  (13).  A recent systematic review and meta-analysis indicates 
that  subclinical  coronary artery disease diagnosed  with  cardiac computed  tomography  angiography is 
more prevalent in patients  with  psoriasis, with  an increased burden of disease and number of high-risk 
coronary plaques [Kaiser et al (2019) in Nast et al. (2022)]. (13) 
Assessment report

Therapy with  methotrexate is  associated with  a reduced risk of cardiovascular morbidity and  mortality 
in  patients  with  RA  as  well  as  in  patients  with  psoriasis  and  psoriatic  arthritis  [Choi  et  al  (2002), 
Prodanovich et al (2005),  Westlake et al (2010)  and Roubille et al (2015)  in Nast et al. (2022)]  (13). In 
a  longitudinal  cohort  study  of  6902  patients  with  psoriasis, Ahlehoff  et  al.  found  that  treatment  with 
methotrexate was associated with  a reduced risk of cardiovascular events compared to patients treated 
with  other  antipsoriatic therapies such  as ciclosporin and  retinoids [Ahlehoff et  al (2015)  in Nast  et  al. 
(2022)]  (13).  Methotrexate  therapy  decreases  carotid  intima-media  thickness  (a  marker  of 
arteriosclerosis) in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis [Martinez-Lopez et al (2018) in Nast et al. 
(2022)]  (13).    Preclinical and  pilot  studies  suggest  possible  cardioprotective effects  of  apremilast and 
fumarates but  there is no clinical evidence that either affect cardiovascular risk [Schmieder et al (2015) 
and Imam et al (2018) in Nast et  al. (2022)] (13). 
In a retrospective study by Van Dooren-Greebe et al., [(1995)  in Dogra  and Mahajan (2013)]  (11) 113 
patients with  severe psoriasis were treated with  low-dose MTX over 22  years. The treatment resulted in 
prolonged clearance or near clearance in 81% of the patients, while 73% of the patients had side-effects, 
most  frequently  abnormal  liver  function  tests,  nausea  and  gastric  symptoms.  The  maximum  weekly 
dosage was 15 mg (Weinstein schedule), with the mean cumulative dose being 4.803g. 
In another retrospective study, Kumar et  al. [(2002)  in  Dogra and  Mahajan (2013)] (11)  reviewed the 
data  on 244  patients  with  psoriasis who  were given once-weekly oral MTX  at  the  full  therapeutic dose 
(0.3–0.5  mg/kg/week) during  the  period  1981–2000.  An  improvement of  >  75%  occurred in  88%  of 
patients in 8.5 ± 5.1 weeks, and only three patients had significantly abnormal liver-function tests. Liver 
biopsies were taken before (34 biopsies) and after (13 biopsies) MTX therapy, which showed grade I/II 
changes  that  were  nonprogressive. These  studies  confirm  the  effectiveness of  MTX  monotherapy  in 
moderate to severe psoriasis. 
Comparing  MTX  with  other  therapies  such  as  ciclosporin  has  shown  conflicting  results.  Sandhu  et  al. 
[(2003) in Dogra and Mahajan (2013)] (11) found MTX to provide a faster relief than ciclosporin, whereas 
Haydendael  et  al.  [(2003)  in  Dogra  and  Mahajan  (2013)]  (11)  did  not  find  any  significant  difference 
between the  two agents.  In a randomized controlled study  comparing both  of these agents, ciclosporin 
was found  to  be significantly  more effective than  MTX  in  treating  psoriasis [Flytström  et  al.  (2008),  in 
Dogra and Mahajan (2013)].  (11) 
With  the  increasing  use  of  biological  response  modifiers  in  psoriasis  and  PsA,  there  is  a  need  for 
comparisons of these agents with MTX. The CHAMPION trial [Comparative Study of Humira (adalimumab) 
with  Methotrexate with  Placebo in Patients with  Psoriasis]) [Saurat et al. (2008),  in Dogra and Mahajan 
(2013)]  (11) can be considered a landmark study, as it evaluated the efficacy and safety of MTX versus 
a biological drug. At the end of the 16-week treatment period, PASI75 was achieved by 80% patients in 
the  adalimumab group,  36%  patients  in  the  MTX  group and  19%  patients  in  the  placebo group,  while 
PASI 100  was  achieved by  17%  patients  receiving  adalimumab,  7%  patients  receiving MTX  and  2% 
patients  receiving placebo. It  was concluded that  adalimumab showed superior efficacy compared with 
MTX  and placebo. In the  subanalysis of the  CHAMPION  trial,  it  was seen that  PASI75 was  achieved by 
70%  patients  who  were early responders to  MTX  (i.e.  those  who  achieved PASI50 at  week 8)  and  by 
41%  patients  who were late  responders to  MTX (i.e.  who achieved PASI50 at  week 12).  Less than  5% 
of patients who were late non-responders achieved PASI 75 [Reich et al. (2010), in Dogra and Mahajan 
(2013)]  (11). Hence, patients who do not respond to MTX by week 12 may be considered for alternative 
therapy. 
In another trial comparing subcutaneous briakinumab (a monoclonal antibody against the p40 molecule) 
and oral MTX, the former was found to be significantly superior to MTX in terms of efficacy, although the 
risk of infection and malignancy was also slightly higher [Fallah Arani et al. (2011), in Dogra and Mahajan 
(2013)]  (11). If the trials comparing biologicals and MTX are critically analysed, it is apparent that in all 
Assessment report

Page 26/48 
 
 
 
these trials,  MTX  was initially  started  at  the  lower dose, which  was  increased to  a  maximum of  15–25 
mg/week only when  there was  an unsatisfactory  response. Because the efficacy of MTX  may be dose-
dependent  [Montaudie  et  al.  (2011)  in  Dogra  and  Mahajan  (2013)]    (11),  the  low  initial  dose  of  MTX 
may be responsible for the relatively lower number of patients  achieving PASI 75 at week 12. In Indian 
trials, MTX has shown excellent efficacy and faster response with  few side-effects when given at  a dose 
of 0.3–0.5  mg/kg/week, hence, a comparison of the  biological  therapies with  the  full  therapeutic dose 
of MTX given from the outset may be warranted. 
Combination therapy 
Methotrexate  may  be  combined  with  psoralen  ultraviolet  A  therapy  (PUVA)  [Morison  et  al  (1982)  in 
Warren  et  al  (2008)]  (14),  ultraviolet  B  therapy  (UVB)  [Paul  et  al  (1982),  Armstrong  et  al  (1982)  in 
Warren et  al  (2008)]  (14)  and  etretinate  [Vanderveen et  al  (1982)  in  Warren  et  al  (2008)]  (14).  The 
aim of such combinations being to  reduce dosage and subsequent  toxicity, however, concerns over the 
potential  for  cancer  induction,  with  methotrexate  and  phototherapy  [Fitzsimons  et  al  (1983)],  and 
hepatitis,  with  methotrexate and retinoids [Gollnick (1996)]  has limited such  approaches [in Warren et 
al (2008)]  (14).  Colchicine has been combined with  methotrexate for treatment  of generalized pustular 
psoriasis [Horiguchi et al (1981) in Warren et al (2008)] (14). 
Methotrexate has also been combined successfully with cyclosporine in patients with severe, recalcitrant 
psoriasis, most of which had psoriatic arthropathy [Clark et al (1999) in Warren et al (2008)] (14). This 
allowed  reduction  in  dosages of both  drugs,  and  few adverse events were  recorded during  the  study. 
More recently, a prospective study of 20 patients severely affected with psoriasis on this combination of 
therapies found the  treatment effective with  limited  manageable toxicity [Aydin et  al (2006)  in  Warren 
et al (2008)]  (14). The combination has not been studied in the long term. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
No  new  studies  have  been  provided  specifically  to  address  the  efficacy  in  the  moderate  recalcitrant 
psoriasis  population.  The  presented  information  either  refers  to  combined  “moderate  to  severe” 
population, or simply to patients with  psoriasis, with or without  arthritis.  
A discussion about published studies in patients  with moderate to  severe psoriasis / psoriatic arthritis is 
provided,  supported  by  study  narratives  and  meta-analyses.  Most  of  the  discussion  in  the  clinical 
overview is based on the Eurogioderm guideline for the systemic treatment of psoriasis from Nast et al., 
published in 2022.   
No raw data from the discussed studies has been provided. This does not facilitate the discrimination of 
efficacy in moderate psoriasis from the efficacy in  severe psoriasis, for which a risk benefit has already 
been considered positive and authorised. 
Extension  of  the  indication  from  severe  to  moderate  to  severe  psoriasis  would  thus  consider  the 
discussion  of  the  added  benefit  and  risk  of  the  moderate  psoriasis  population.    Of  note,  injectable 
methotrexate  has  already been  approved  via  Decentralized  Procedure  (RMS  SE  +  22  CMSs)  with  the 
“moderate to  severe psoriasis” indication. Therefore, extension of the indication  for which  a risk benefit 
has been considered positive would be based on similar grounds.  
During  the  procedure,  the  MAH  was  asked  to  discuss  available  data  in  moderate  psoriasis,  and  its  
comparison to the data available in severe psoriasis. This included: 
a)  The  operational  definition  of  moderate psoriasis.  The  PASI has  a  significant  inter-observer 
variability, and patients  who score 5-10  with  some investigators may score higher with  others, 
Assessment report  
EMA/439575/2023  
Page 27/48 
 
 
 
making the  PASI 10  point  cut-off  a very debatable, at  least in  earlier trials,  where investigator 
training was not common.  
b) The data on moderate as compared to severe psoriasis population in available studies 
c)  The  adequacy  of  extrapolation  of  efficacy  on  severe  psoriasis  patients  observed  in  the 
presented studies, to the moderate population, should it not be able to fulfil b). 
The provided studies did  not  discriminate between  these populations,  and thus,  it  was  considered that 
the data performed covered both the moderate and the severe populations. 
Additionally, although  not requested by the  MAH,  a simplified indication “are indicated for patients  with 
moderate-severe  plaque  psoriasis”  was  suggested  by  CHMP,  removing  the  “recalcitrant  disabling” 
wording.  This  is  in  line  with  previously approved systemic biological  therapies. It  was  considered  that 
the  indication  wording  “’who  are candidates  for  systemic therapy’’  better  reflects  definition  of  patient 
severity and population and is in line with recent approvals from CHMP. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Considering the totality of evidence provided by the applicant the CHMP considered the extension of 
indication in  patients with  moderate psoriasis approvable. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
No new clinical data have been provided in this application. A review of relevant clinical data literature 
is presented by the MAH. 
Patient exposure 
Overall, here is a known difference between high-dose methotrexate as used in neoplastic diseases which 
frequently cause AEs and  SAEs, and low-dose  methotrexate treatment  (including  rheumatoid  arthritis, 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis,  Crohn’s disease and psoriasis patients). Low dose therapy is  well tolerated 
in the majority of patients. 
Nevertheless, the toxicity spectrum in low dose treated patients is widespread with respect to symptoms 
and  intensity,  including  serious and  sometimes fatal  cytopenia, pneumonitis  and  liver disease. Careful 
patient selection and regular monitoring as well as doses adapted to the actual needs of the patients are 
essential to reduce the toxicity of MTX in low-dose methotrexate treatment [Albrecht et al (2010)] (1). 
There were no new trials presented, so there is no new exposure in CT.  
Post-authorisation  experience 
The patient exposure is calculated by using the assumed average maintenance dose per day (WHO DDD) 
of 2.5  mg for MTX used for non-oncologic indications in  adults, given by the  WHO Collaborating Centre 
for Drug Statistics  Methodology. The weekly average dose is 2.5 mg x 7 = 17.5 mg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/439575/2023  
Page 28/48 
 
 
 
 
The MAH  has used  the WHO  DDD  for  non oncology indications, but  this  pertains  to 17.5  mg  per week, 
whilst the recommended dose for Nordimet is 15 mg per week. As such, the exposure is estimated to be 
267 627  patient treatment  years.  
Adverse events 
A review of adverse events from the literature for antineoplastics and psoriatic indications is performed 
below. 
Antineoplastics indication 
The  acute  effects  of  antineoplastic  drugs  often  include  nausea  and  vomiting,  sometimes  extremely 
severe. 
In  addition,  many  of  these  compounds  are irritant  or vesicant,  and  produce  local  pain,  irritation,  and 
inflammation  at  the  administration  site;  extravasation  may  lead  to  ulceration  and  necrosis. 
Hypersensitivity reactions may also occur. 
Many  of  the  adverse effects  of  antineoplastics  are  an  extension  of  their  therapeutic  action,  which  is 
generally not  selective for malignant  cells but  affects all  rapidly dividing  cells: antineoplastic therapy is 
then  made possible only by increased sensitivity or less effective recovery of malignant cells compared 
with  normal  cells,  and  dosage  is  carefully  controlled  and  timed,  and,  where  possible,  localized,  to 
maximize the  differences. In consequence, adverse effects may be expected from most antineoplastics 
in  tissues  where  normal  cell  division  is  fairly  rapid,  e.g.  the  bone  marrow,  lymphoreticular  tissue, 
gastrointestinal  mucosa,  skin,  and  gonads, as  well  as  in  the  foetus.  The  effects  may not  manifest  for 
days or weeks, depending both  on  the  rugs used and  the  rate of  division in  the  tissue concerned, and 
may sometimes be cumulative. Because of their effects on the various types of white  blood cells, many 
antineoplastics  also  cause profound  suppression  or  normal  immunity,  and  patients  may be  at  greatly 
increased risk of severe and disseminated infection. 
The rapid destruction  of large numbers of cells during  antineoplastic therapy of certain highly sensitive 
tumours,  and  the  consequent  release  of  breakdown  products  may  also  lead  to  problems  with 
hyperuricaemia and acute renal failure due to uric acid nephropathy (the ' tumour lysis syndrome'). 
In  the  very  long  term,  patients  who  have  undergone  successful  anti  neoplastic  chemotherapy  may 
develop secondary malignancies,  suggesting  that  antineoplastics  may themselves  be  carcinogenic. In 
addition,  most are potentially mutagenic and teratogenic, and use in pregnancy, particularly in the  first 
trimester, may lead to foetal abortion, stunting, or malformation [Martindale (2020c)]. 
The  most  common  dose-related  toxic  effects  of  methotrexate  are  on  the  bone  marrow  and 
gastrointestinal  tract. Bone-marrow depression can occur abruptly,  and leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, 
and anaemia may all occur. 
The nadir of the  platelet  and white-blood  cell counts is  usually around 5 to  10 days after a bolus dose, 
with  recovery between  about  14  to  28  days, but  some sources suggest  that  leucocytes may show  an 
early fall and rise, followed by a second nadir and recovery, within this  period. Ulceration of the mouth 
and  gastrointestinal  disturbances  are  also  early  signs  of  toxicity:  stomatitis  and  diarrhoea  during 
treatment  indicate  that  it  may  need  to  be  interrupted,  otherwise  haemorrhagic  enteritis,  intestinal 
perforation, and death may follow. 
Methotrexate is associated with  liver damage, both acute (notably after high doses) and, more seriously, 
chronic (generally after long-term use). Hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis may develop without  obvious signs 
of hepatotoxicity and have led to eventual death.

Other  adverse effects  include renal  failure and  tubular  necrosis after  high  doses, pulmonary reactions 
including  life-threatening  interstitial  lung  disease,  skin  reactions  (sometimes  severe),  alopecia,  and 
ocular irritation. Neurotoxicity may be seen: leukoencephalopathy, paresis, demyelination are associated 
particularly with intrathecal use and are more likely when cranial irradiation is also given. 
Intrathecal  use may also produce  arachnoiditis, an  acute  syndrome of  headache, nuchal  rigidity,  back 
pain, and fever. Other rarer reactions may include megaloblastic anaemia, osteoporosis, precipitation of 
diabetes, arthralgia, necrosis of soft tissue and bone, and anaphylaxis. 
Purpuric  skin  lesions  due  to  vasculitis  have  occurred after  both  high  dose  [Navarro  et  al  (1986),  in 
Martindale  (2014a)]    (29),  and  low dose  [Marks et  al (1984),  Tomer et  al  (1997)  Martindale  (2020a)] 
(6).  Accelerated rheumatoid  nodulosis has  been reported [Williams et  al  (1998),  Filosa  et  al  (1999)  in 
Martindale  (2020a)]  (6)  after the  use of methotrexate in  patients  with  rheumatoid arthritis.  Erosion of 
psoriatic  plaques,  accompanied  by  pain  and  erythema,  has  been  seen'  after  low-dose  methotrexate 
therapy;  blistering  and  necrosis  consistent  with  toxic  epidermal  necrolysis  has  occurred  [Reed  et  al 
(1983)  in  Martindale  (2020a)]  (6).  Possible exacerbation of  a photosensitivity  reaction to  ciprofloxacin 
has been described, [Nedorost et al (1989),  in Martindale (2020a)] (6)  and reactivation of sunburn has 
also been reported [Khans et al (2000)  in Martindale (2020a)] (6) several in cases where methotrexate 
was given within 2 to  5 days after the initial sunburn. 
Methotrexate  may cause defective oogenesis and  spermatogenesis, and fertility  may be impaired  (this 
may be reversible). Like other folate inhibitors,  it  is teratogenic, and  it has  been associated with foetal 
deaths. Lymphomas (generally reversible on withdrawal  of treatment) have occasionally been reported 
with  methotrexate therapy, although the association has been questioned [Martindale (2020a)]. (6)

The  appearance and  degree of  severity  of  undesirable  effects  depends  on  the  dosage  level  and  the 
frequency of administration.  However, as severe undesirable effects can occur even at lower doses, it is 
necessary for patients to be monitored regularly at short intervals. 
Psoriasis 
In  a  review  by  Warren  et  al  (2008)  (14),  nausea,  stable  leukopenia  and  mild  elevation  of  liver 
transaminases are listed as common and manageable side effects of methotrexate. 
Rarely,  hematopoietic  suppression  can  be  significant,  particularly  as  a  result  of  overdosing  of 
methotrexate [Roenigk et al (1988)  in Warren et al (2008)] (14).  Rare severe bone marrow suppression 
can also be due to  compromised renal function  or drug interactions  [Shupack et al (1988)  in  Tung et al 
(1990)]  (12).  Despite  its  rapid  cellular activity,  effects  on  bone marrow  have been rare. According  to 
McKinnon  et  al  (1985)  [in  Benedek  (2010)]    (30),  only  seven  instances  of  leukopenia  and  three  of 
pancytopenia had been reported as of 1985,  to  which they added six cases of pancytopenia, two  being 
fatal [McKinnon et al (1985)  in Benedek (2010)] (30). Bone marrow injury appears to be related to renal 
failure. Anagen alopecia, oral ulceration, and cutaneous erosions are rare when a weekly dosing schedule 
is used [Kaplan et al (1988) in Warren et al (2008)]. (14) 
Other  rare complications  include  cutaneous  ulceration  [Kaplan  et  al  (1988)],  ataxia  [Baker (1970b)], 
folliculitis,  reactivation of  tuberculosis [Smith  et  al  (1971)],  depression and other  psychotic symptoms 
[Baker (1970b)], [all in Warren et al (2008)]. (14) 
The incidence of central nervous system toxicity from low-dose methotrexate therapy is quite rare. The 
most common complaints include headache and dizziness [Kremer et al (1988), Nyfors (1978), Weinblatt 
et al (1985,  1988), Wernick et al (1989) in  Tung et al (1990)] (12). 
Individuals who consume alcohol while on methotrexate, are diabetic,  and/or are obese are more likely 
to  develop significant  liver toxicity.  Hepatotoxicity  is  also a  major  concern in  long  term  methotrexate 
therapy  [Coe  et  al  (1968),  Roenigk el  a1  (1988),  Weinstein  el  al  (1973)  in  Tung  et  al  (1990)]  (12). 
Toxicity leading  to  cirrhosis appears to  be  the  result  of  total  cumulative  dose of  the  drug  and  not  the 
duration of therapy [Weinstein et al (1973)  in Tung et al (1990)] (12).  The weekly dosing schedule has 
been shown  to  have a lower  incidence in  promoting pathological  changes than  the  daily dose  regimen 
[Menard et al (1980),  Roenigk et al (1969) in Tung et al (1990)].  (12) 
Assessment report  
EMA/439575/2023

Hepatotoxicity  is the  major problem of  low  dose pulse methotrexate therapy in  patients  with  psoriasis 
[Roenigk et al (1998) in Grim et al (2003)]  (31). Elevation of hepatic enzymes, especially transaminases, 
occurs  in  about  20%  of  patients  shortly  after  initiation  of  low  dose  pulse  methotrexate  therapy,  but 
generally resolves within 1-3 weeks of treatment. However, the risk of developing severe hepatotoxicity 
(grade  III  or  IV)  occurs  later  and  has  been  reported  in  approximately  3-25%  of  psoriatic  patients  
[Roenigk et al (1998), Olsen (1995) in Grim et al (2003)]  (31). Malatjalian et al (1996)  [in Maryles et al 
(2003)]  (9)  reported a 23.1 % incidence of severe hepatotoxicity, including severe hepatic fibrosis and 
liver  cirrhosis,  in  patients  treated  with  long-term  methotrexate  for  psoriasis.  However,  patients  with 
rheumatoid  arthritis  on  low  dose  pulse  methotrexate  therapy  rarely  develop  severe  hepatotoxicity 
[Roenigk et al (1998), Olsen (1995) in  Grim et al (2003)]. (31) 
Roenigk et  al (1998)  [in  Warren et  al (2008)]  (14)  have published recommendations on methotrexate 
therapy for psoriasis and suggest liver biopsy at a cumulative dose of 1.5  g. According to Hashkes et al 
(1997)  [in  Gutierrez-Suarez  et  al  (2010)  (32)],  routine  invasive  liver  biopsies  are  not  necessary  in 
patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis since several studies have shown no long-term adverse effects 
or liver fibrosis in patients treated for a mean of 3.5 to 5 years [Haskes et al (1997)  in Gutierrez-Suarez 
et  al  (2010)]  (32).  Liver  biopsy is  only  indicated  if  pre-existing  or a  recently acquired  liver disease is 
found [Nieuhues et al (2006)  in Gutierrez-Suarez et al (2010)] (32). 
Liver biopsy is associated with  significant comorbidity and rarely mortality; therefore, novel noninvasive 
ways to monitor for hepatotoxicity have been explored. Three monthly monitoring of serum levels of the 
aminoterminal  propeptide  of  type  III  collagen  (pIIINP)  may  allow  70%  of  patients  to  be  monitored 
without  liver biopsy [Zachariae et  al (1989),  Boffa et  al (1996),  Zachariae et  al (2001)  in  Warren et  al 
(2008)]  (14). 
Other rare but important  complications include pulmonary fibrosis/alveolitis, infection,  osteopathy, and 
mutagenicity.  Methotrexate  osteopathy  presents  as a  triad  of  severe pain  localized  to  the  distal  tibia, 
osteoporosis, and  compression fractures of  the  distal  tibia.  Withdrawal  of  methotrexate appears to  be 
the only treatment [Zonneveld et al (1996) in Warren et al (2008)] (14). 
Two  patterns  of methotrexate-induced pulmonary disease have been reported  [Carson et  al  (1987)  in 
Tung et al (1990)] (12).  The first is a hypersensitivity reaction characterised by interstitial pneumonitis, 
granuloma formation and the development of bronchopneumonia; the second, a toxic drug reaction with 
diffuse alveolar damage and other signs of nonspecific lung injury [Phillips et al (1986, 1987), Rail et al 
(1963)  in Tung et al (1990)]  (12). 
Especially in patients  with rheumatoid arthritis,  low dosage methotrexate therapy can induce interstitial 
lung  injury.  The  X-ray  film  generally  shows  linear  and  reticulonodular  basal  and/or  midlung  field 
infiltrates.  A  biopsy  specimen  shows  monocellular  cell  desquamation  into  the  alveoli,  along  with  a 
tendency to form non-caseating granulomas that  contain multicellular giant cells. About 40% of patients 
have  concomitant  eosinophilia  and  17%  have  a  rash  [Olsen  (1991)  in  Grim  et  al  (2003)]  (31).  The 
strongest  predictor  for  lung  injury  is  old  age  (≥60  years), diabetes  mellitus,  rheumatoid  pulmonary 
involvement, previous use of DMARDs  and hypoalbuminaemia [Alarcon et al (1997) in Grim et al (2003)] 
(31).  Many  reports describe opportunistic  infections  caused by Pneumocystis carinii  in  patients  on  low 
dose pulse methotrexate therapy. 
Several reports  associate these  infections  with  pancytopenia  [Jeurissen et  al  (1989),  Al-Awadhi  et  al 
(1993),  Basin et al (1991) in Grim et al (2003)]   (31), whereas others describe pulmonary infection only 
[Thomas et  al  (1986),  Groenendal et  al (1990),  Stewart  et al  (1990)  in  Grim  et  al (2003)]  (31).  Very 
often, these  patients are elderly with  decreased creatinine clearance and  infections of the  urinary tract 
treated with  cotrimoxazole/trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Once  pulmonary  toxicity  is  suspected,  treatment  with  methotrexate  should  be  withheld  [Tung  et  al 
(1990)]. 
MTX  does  not  seem  to  affect  the  lung  in  children  with  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  and  therefore, 
pulmonary  function  tests  are  usually  not  necessary  in  those  patients  [Schmeling  et  al  (2002)  in 
Gutierrez-Suarez et al (2010)] (32). 
As a known teratogen [Warkany (1978)  in  Tung et al (1990)]  (12) methotrexate should not  be used in 
pregnant  women.  For  the  same reason,  methotrexate should  not  be  given  to  females of  childbearing 
potential.  Contraceptive  measures  [Hatcher  et  al  (1988-89)]  should  be  employed  in  patients  of 
childbearing age, and continue  for 12 weeks after stopping therapy [Hanna  et at  (1980),  Roenigk et al 
(1988),  Voorhees et al (1969)], [all in Tung et al (1990)] (12). 
Males should also be advised to use contraception while on methotrexate therapy and for 3 months after 
completing  treatment.  Reversible  oligospermia  has  been  observed  in  male  patients  receiving 
methotrexate  therapy,  but  the  drug  does  not  seem  to  affect  ovarian  functions  [Jolivet  et  al  (1983), 
Shamberger et  al  (1981),  Sussman  et  al  (1980)  in  Tung  et  al (1990)]  (12).  Because of the  S-phase-
specific action of the drug, the slowly dividing spermatogonial stem cells are not expected to be affected. 
The actively dividing  spermatocytes and spermatids, on the other hand, are influenced by the action of 
methotrexate,  thus  suppressing  spermatogenesis [Shamberger  et  al  (1981),  Sussman  et  al  (1980)  in 
Tung  et  al  (1990)]  (12).  There is  no  evidence of  irreversible harmful  effects  of  methotrexate  on  the 
testes, and male patients treated with the drug at the time of conception have produced normal offspring 
[Perry (1983) in Tung et al (1990)] (12). 
Methotrexate  carries  a  theoretical  risk  of  carcinogenesis.  Indeed,  there  has  been  a  report  of 
metastasizing  squamous  cell  carcinoma of  the  skin  in  a  psoriasis patient  on  long-term  methotrexate 
therapy [Jensen et al (1989) in Warren et al (2008)] (14). 
Furthermore, long-term follow-up  of a cohort of patients on  PUVA and other therapies for psoriasis has 
suggested  a relative risk of  2:1  for  squamous cell  carcinoma of the  skin  in  those  who  have had  high-
dose methotrexate  exposure vs  low  or no  exposure  [Stern  et  al  (1994)  in  Warren  et  al  (2008)]  (14). 
This  risk  was  independent  of  PUVA,  and  thus,  close  surveillance  of  psoriasis  patients  on  long-term 
methotrexate therapy is advisable. 
Supplementation with  folic and folinic acids 
Folate  deficiency and  methotrexate toxicity share some similar symptomatology. Depleted  intracellular 
folate levels have been documented in hepatocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes of methotrexate-
treated patients with  rheumatoid arthritis [Kremer et al (1986),  Morgan et al (1991)  in Bannwarth et al 
(1994)] (33). Initial plasma homocysteine levels, an indicator of folate status, were found to be predictive 
of future  toxicity during  methotrexate therapy in folate unsupplemented  patients  [Morgan et  al (1991) 
in Bannwarth et al (1994)] (33). It was therefore postulated that folate supplementation would be useful 
in  reducing  some  of  the  toxic  manifestations  associated  with  low  dosage  methotrexate  therapy 
[Bannwarth et al (1994)]  (33). 
Folic  acid  1mg  daily  was  shown  to  reduce methotrexate  toxicity  without  compromising  its  efficacy  in 
rheumatoid  arthritis  [Morgan  et al  (1990)  in  Bannwarth et  al  (1994)]  (33).  An uncontrolled  long  term 
trial  provided  indirect  evidence that  the  incidence  of  nausea,  diarrhoea, stomatitis,  and  liver function 
abnormalities may be lowered by folic acid 7mg weekly [Stewart et al (1991b) in Bannwarth et al (1994)] 
(33). Clinical studies reveal a decrease of about 50%  in reported adverse effects in rheumatoid arthritis 
patients receiving supplementation therapy, especially with respect to nausea and fatigue [Morgan et al 
(1990),  Shiroky et al (1993) in Grim et al (2003)] (31). In an open study, high dosage calcium folinate  
(45  mg/week) was reported to  be effective in preventing methotrexate-related nausea, but this benefit 
Assessment report  
EMA/439575/2023  
Page 34/48 
 
 
 
was  overshadowed by  the  worsening  of  the  disease activity  [Tishler  et  a1  (1988)  in  Bannwarth  et  al 
(1994)]  (33).  Calcium folinate 1  mg taken  simultaneously with  methotrexate had no  obvious effect on 
either the disease activity or on methotrexate toxicity [Weinblatt et al (1993a) in Bannwarth et al (1994)] 
(31).  Conversely,  calcium  folinate  2.5  or  5  mg/week  decreased  the  common  adverse  effects  of 
methotrexate,  including  transaminase elevations,  oral ulcers,  and  gastrointestinal  symptoms,  without 
interfering with  its efficacy. In this study, calcium folinate was given 24 hours after the weekly oral dose 
of methotrexate 7.5 to 30mg [Shiroky et al (1993) in Bannwarth et al (1994)] (33). 
In double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in adults with  rheumatoid arthritis, 1-5 mg of folic acid led to 
a significant reduction in adverse effects while preserving the efficacy of methotrexate therapy. However, 
in order to preserve the anti-inflammatory effect a slightly higher dosage of methotrexate was necessary 
[Ortiz  et  al  (1998),  Van  Ede  et  al  (2001)  in  Niehues  et  al  (2006)]  (10).  Moreover,  in  adults  with 
rheumatoid arthritis  folic acid supplementation lowers homocysteine levels, which  are increased during 
low-dose  methotrexate  [Morgan  et  al  (1998),  Van  Ede  et  al  (2002)  in  Niehues  et  al  (2006)]  (10).  It 
seems that  folic acid supplementation is associated with a reduced methotrexate discontinuation rate in 
adults [Harten  (2005) in Niehues et  al (2006)] (10). 
Folic  acid  (l  mg/day)  application  in  children  with  juvenile  rheumatoid  arthritis  has  been  studied  in  a 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study and has not affected anti-inflammatory efficacy [Hunt 
et al (1997)  in Niehues et al (2006)]  (10). 
However, in this study  there were no systematic data  on toxicity, there was a rather small cohort of 19 
children  with  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis,  and  the  observation  period  was  very  short  (13  weeks). 
Therefore,  it  is  difficult  to  deduce  a  recommendation  based  on  this  study.  Huemer  et  al  (2003)  [in 
Niehues et al (2006)]  (10) studied  the effect of folic acid supplementation  and methotrexate treatment 
on homocysteine levels in children. They showed that  patients with  juvenile idiopathic arthritis receiving 
methotrexate have significantly elevated baseline plasma homocysteine levels compared with age- and 
sex-matched healthy control individuals but that there is no significant impact of folate supplementation 
on homocysteine levels. Thus, in patients  with  minor adverse effects with  methotrexate the use of folic 
acid at a dosage of 1 mg/day is feasible [Niehues et al (2006)] (10). 
For psoriasis patients, addition of folic acid (5 mg daily) can help to alleviate gastrointestinal side effects, 
and close monitoring of liver function and full blood count allow continued therapy in most. 
A  recent  study  has  suggested  that  folic  acid  supplementation  may  reduce  the  treatment  efficacy  of 
methotrexate in the control  of psoriasis [Salim et al (2006)  in Warren et al (2008)]  (14).  However, the 
total  numbers in this  study were small, and firm conclusions not  possible. Currently, it is recommended 
that psoriasis patients on methotrexate therapy should have supplemental folic acid at 5 mg/d including 
the day of methotrexate dosing [Strober et al (2005) in Warren et al (2008)] (14). 
Not  only the dosage of folate, but  also the timing  of the  dose may play a role. When a dose of calcium 
folinate equal to the methotrexate dose was given 4 hours after methotrexate administration, the efficacy 
of methotrexate did  not  change, and the  incidence of stomatitis  and  gastrointestinal  toxicity tended  to 
decrease [Buckley et a1 (1990) in Bannwarth et al (1994)]  (33). A single dose of calcium folinate 20 mg 
weekly administered midway between weekly doses (5  to 25  mg, mean 18.5  mg) of methotrexate had 
no adverse effects on disease control [Hanrahan et al (1988) in Bannwarth et al (1994)] (33). In contrast, 
calcium  folinate  15mg  given  2  hours  after  methotrexate  caused  exacerbation of  rheumatoid  arthritis 
[Joyce et al (1991) in Bannwarth et al (1994)] (33). In these 2 studies, there was no difference between 
placebo and  calcium folinate  regarding methotrexate-induced adverse effects [Bannwarth et al (1994)] 
(33).  Also Van  Ede  et  al  (1998)  [in  Grim  et  al  (2003)]  (31)  observed that  late  administration  of  folic 
acid, i.e. 3 to 4 days after methotrexate, was no more effective than placebo in controlling nausea. 
Assessment report  
EMA/439575/2023  
Page 35/48 
 
 
 
Furthermore,  folate  supplementation  did  not  reduce  the  incidence  of  postoperative  infectious 
complications in methotrexate-treated patients [Perhala et al (1991) in Bannwarth et al (1994)] (33). 
Bressolle et al (2000)  [in Grim et al (2003)] (31) reported increases of methotrexate total clearance and 
volume  of  distribution  in  patients  taking  folic  acid  supplementation  therapy.  This  observation  was 
interpreted as increased cellular uptake of methotrexate, with the folic acid supplements promoting the 
intracellular  sequestering of  methotrexate. It  is  also  possible that  the  reduced AUC  is  associated  with 
increased intracellular folate levels. 
Folinic acid may also be used for oral supplementation therapy. If doses of low dose pulse methotrexate 
are 5-12.5mg weekly, 2.5mg of folinic acid is administered the day after LDMTX.  If the dose is 15-30mg 
weekly, the  amount of folinic acid is increased to 5mg, given the day after methotrexate [Roenigk et al 
(1998),  Shiroky (1997) in Grim et al (2003)] (31). 
Post marketing  experience 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Local tolerance 
When methotrexate is given by the intramuscular route, local undesirable effects (burning  sensation) or 
damage  (formation  of  sterile  abscess,  destruction  of  fatty  tissue)  at  the  site  of  injection  can  occur 
commonly. 
Subcutaneous application  of  methotrexate is  locally well  tolerated. Only  mild local  skin reactions were 
observed, decreasing during therapy [eMC-50 (2014)] (7). 
The product under consideration Methotrexate 25 mg/ml solution for injection will be supplied in prefilled 
pen containing volumes in a range of 0.3 ml  to 1.0 ml.  The reference product Lantarel FS from Pfizer is 
supplied  in  prefilled  syringes  with  volumes  in  the  range  of  1  ml  to  2.67  ml.  Several  other  product 
strengths of methotrexate are marketed including Metoject 50 mg/ml solution for injection of Medac. 
Safety in special populations 
Paediatric population: The product is indicated for the treatment in adult patients in this  indication. 
Notwithstanding,  the Applicant  has provided observational data on efficacy and safety (Bronckers et al, 
2020) on 187 paediatric patients treated with MTX, either isolated or in combination or sequentially with 
biologicals. In a follow up between 1 to 5 years, the efficacy and safety patterns did not differ significantly 
from what has been observed in adults. 
Elderly population (treatment of psoriasis) 
Much  lower  doses  of  methotrexate  are  effective in  controlling  psoriasis  in  the  elderly,  probably  as  a 
consequence of reduced renal clearance. Patients older than  80 years have been adequately controlled 
on only 2.5 mg of methotrexate per week [Fairris et al (1989) in Warren et al (2008)] (14). 
It  is  prudent  to  accept  that  some  residual  areas  of  psoriasis  will  remain  to  prevent  relative  over 
treatment.  Complete  clearance  of  psoriasis  should  not  be  a  goal  of  treatment.  Although  the  use  of 
methotrexate can have fatal  consequences, most  of such  cases are attributable  to  absolute or  relative 
overdosage [Baker (1970) in Warren et al (2008)] (14). 
Patients with  renal impairment 
Assessment report  
EMA/439575/2023  
Page 36/48 
 
 
 
Patients  with  renal impairment  have a higher  overall rate of  toxicity for  a variety of drugs.  The risk of 
severe toxicity  is  increased about  4-fold  in  patients  with  renal  impairment.  Concomitant  use  of  other 
potentially  nephrotoxic drugs,  including  NSAIDs,  and preexisting  renal insufficiency are additional  risk 
factors. Therefore, although  direct toxicity  of low  dose MTX  has  not  been proven, the  dosage regimen 
should be adjusted in patients with  severe renal impairment [Albrecht et al (2010)] (1). 
Before  starting  MTX  therapy  and  for  monitoring,  investigation  of  serum  creatinine  with  creatinine 
clearance and serum albumin assay should be obtained once a month for the first 3 months, then every 
4-12  weeks [Pavy et al (2006) in Albrecht et al (2010)] (1). 
Methotrexate is not generally considered nephrotoxic when used at low doses for inflammatory disease, 
although  renal  impairment is  reported  [Kremer  et  al  (1995)  in  Nast  et  al.  (2022)]  (13).  Methotrexate 
and 7-hydroxymethotrexate are mainly excreted through the kidneys, via glomerular filtration and active 
transport. Methotrexate clearance is therefore reduced (and thus risk of toxicity increased) in the context 
of chronic kidney disease, depending on the stage. In a cohort of 77 patients with RA and various stages 
of chronic kidney disease, the elimination  half-life of a single dose of intramuscular methotrexate (7.5-
15  mg) was directly related to  glomerular filtration  rate, with  a decrease in methotrexate of 44.7 %  in 
the category of patients with  the poorest renal function (i. e., creatinine clearance < 45 ml/min, roughly 
equivalent to stage 3b) [Bressolle et al (1998) in Nast et al. (2022)] (13). Pooling data from randomised 
clinical trial of methotrexate for RA also indicates that presence of renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
< 79 ml/min) increases the odds ratio for severe and pulmonary toxicity by four compared to those with 
a creatinine clearance > 99.8 ml/min (reference group) [Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trial Archive Group 
(1995)  in Nast et al. (2022)]  (13). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific information was provided, regarding the interested population. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The information provided did not allow to discriminate the AEs that led to discontinuation nor the timing 
of  discontinuation  in  psoriasis indication  vs  the  other  indications  or  severity. This  did  not  prevent  full 
assessment of the safety considering the well-known safety profile of methotrexate. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The MAH has not provided a discussion regarding the frequency of AEs in any population with 
psoriasis: neither moderate, nor moderate to severe, neither with  nor without  arthritis.  A reference has 
been made to risk factors for hepatotoxicity in the psoriasis indication. It is understood that the 
baseline characteristics of the patients in several studies (such as BMI> 30 in up to 30% of pts) may 
increase the frequency of identified AEs, both in methotrexate and comparator arms. 
Upon request from CHMP,  the safety profile in the moderate psoriasis population  has been discussed as 
compared to the “moderate to severe" population. In the presented studies, moderate population has 
not been discriminated from the severe population. It is understood that the safety profile in the 
moderate to severe psoriasis population should not differ from the pooled safety characteristics that 
have been presented by the MAH. This takes also into consideration the associated risk factors in the 
psoriatic population, such as the cardiac, metabolic, and hepatic comorbidities. Therefore, it is 
adequate to consider that the safety profile of the population with moderate psoriasis should not be 
significantly different from the severe population.

The MAH has provided a discussion on special populations which are not a particular concern on the 
interested one. The SmPC adequately mentions the safety profile of the moderate to severe psoriasis 
patient population. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Although  no  new  adverse reactions has been  identified  in the  interested  population,  it  was  considered 
important to  understand if the moderate psoriasis population  had a similar safety pattern  as the severe 
population.  Upon  request,  the  MAH  provided a  detailed  discussion  on  both  efficacy  and  safety  of  the 
product of both RCTs, observational studies and of SmPCs of similar approved products. The data shows 
that in the presented studies, moderate to severe patients were analysed altogether, thus not being able 
to  discriminate  among them.  Thus,  it  is  adequate to  support  that  the  previously discussed frequency, 
seriousness or  other  characteristics  of  the  AEs  which  are  valid  to  “moderate” should  also  be  valid  to 
“moderate to severe” population. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the  list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease  or condition 
Psoriasis is a  common, genetically determined,  inflammatory and proliferative disease of the  skin,  the 
most characteristic lesions consisting of chronic, sharply demarcated, dull-red scaly plaques, particularly 
on extensor parts of limbs and in the scalp. The pathogenesis of psoriasis is still incompletely understood.  
Psoriasis is a disabling disease and may even be life-threatening  on rare occasions. Psoriasis affects 1.5 
to  3%  of  the  general population  in  Europe. The  first  manifestation  of  psoriasis may  occur at  any age. 
Two peaks of onset are frequently reported: in the  second and third  decades and about  the age of 60. 
In 3% of patients,  psoriasis begins in childhood. Patients  with  a family history of psoriasis tend to  have 
an earlier age of onset. The duration may vary from a few weeks to a whole lifetime. The clinical course 
is unpredictable but in the majority of cases psoriasis is a chronically remitting and relapsing disease. 
Chronic stable plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris) is the commonest form of the disease, accounting for 
85-90  %  of  cases.  The  circumscribed  infiltrated  skin  lesions  are  scaly  and  erythematous  and  often 
symmetrically distributed over the body. 
3.1.2.  Available  therapies  and unmet  medical  need 
Topical corticosteroids are commonly used for mild to moderate cases. Other topical medications include 
keratolytic agents, anthralin,  coal  tar, vitamin  D  analogs, and  retinoids. For  more widespread disease, 
phototherapy  (ultraviolet  B  [UVB] or  psoralen with  ultraviolet  A  [PUVA])  is  commonly used.  Systemic 
therapy,  including  methotrexate  (MTX),  cyclosporine,  synthetic  retinoids,  and  fumaric  acid  are  often 
effective  in  patients  with  moderate  or  severe  disease.  Apremilast,  an  oral  selective  inhibitor  of  the 
enzyme phosphodiesterase 4,  is also approved for the treatment  of psoriasis. Biological therapies have 
emerged as an  alternative  treatment  option  for  patients  with  moderate to  severe psoriasis in  need of 
systemic  therapy.  Expression  of  tumour  necrosis  factor  (TNF)-induced  proteins  in  psoriatic  plaques 
provided the rationale for the development of TNF-neutralizing therapies for psoriasis, and the anti-TNF 
agents  etanercept, adalimumab, and  infliximab are approved for the  treatment  of  moderate to  severe 
psoriasis. Ustekinumab, a  p40 IL  12/23  inhibitor,  is  approved for the  treatment  of moderate to severe 
psoriasis. More targeted biological therapies such as guselkumab and risankizumab, IL-23 inhibitors and 
anti-IL-17  monoclonal antibodies such  as brodalumab, ixekizumab, and secukinumab are also available 
with higher results in terms of PASI 90 (about 70-75%  at week 16). These more targeted therapies such 
as IL-17 and IL-12/23  inhibitors have added incremental clinical benefit.  
3.1.3.  Main  clinical  studies 
There were no new studies to support the updated indication. The applicant included literature references 
and bibliographic research. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Methotrexate has been used in a moderate to severe psoriasis population. In this population with a broad 
range  of  seriousness  level,  efficacy regarding  soft  and  robust  endpoints  (namely  PASI 75)  has  been 
described between 14 and 60%. Start of effect, duration, maintenance of effect have not been discussed  
Assessment report  
EMA/439575/2023  
Page 42/48 
 
 
 
to  a  great  detail.  However,  in  trials  lasting  more  than  9  months,  there  seems  to  a  plateau  in  the 
improvement phase, followed by a decrease phase. 
Not all presented studies discriminate the PASI reduction. Where available, the level of PASI 75 reduction 
as presented  in  literature  ranged between  9  and 82.7%  in  moderate to  severe psoriasis  (32  studies), 
and between  50  and 92%  in  the  severe population (11  studies).  The frequency of published  moderate 
to  severe patients  reaching PASI 100  was between  4.5  and 18%  and  in  severe patients  PASI 100  ws 
observed in between 30 to 69%. 
Start  of  effect,  duration,  and  maintenance of  effect  have not  been  discussed, but  in  general for  trials 
lasting  more than  9  months,  there seems to  exist a plateau in  improvement around week 24,  followed 
by a decrease. 
The MAH  has presented data upon request of  the CHMP,  which support the  fact that  the  discrimination 
between mild and moderate is usually clear and surely clearer than the discrimination between moderate 
and severe populations. Moreover, in the studies discussed, the “moderate to severe" population PASI / 
BSA scores has shown that most patients were within the moderate expected boundary. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The  degree  of  response  and  maintenance  of  effect  in  the  moderate  population  cannot  be  clearly 
distinguished from the literature, however it can be derived from the METOP study (Warren, 2017) (18). 
These  study  data  are  considered sufficiently  robust  to  demonstrate  the  effect  of  methotrexate  in  the 
“moderate to  severe” population.  However, the  uncertainty  remains regarding the  degree of  response 
and maintenance of effect in the moderate population. 
The population to be added to  the presently approved indication [i.e.  moderate psoriasis] lacks precise 
definition.  A  PASI  score  between  5-10  is  usually  considered  to  be  representing  the  “moderate” 
population,  but  as  there  is  high  inter-rater  variability  with  PASI,  a  patient  scored  as  mild  for  some 
clinicians  may  easily  be  upgraded  to  moderate  by  other  clinicians.  In  clinical  trials,  severity  of  the 
condition  is usually more precise, and clinicians  are trained  to the  study  inclusion criteria.  In the  post-
marketing setting,  defining the “moderate" condition is not  easy between patients, slightly symptomatic 
not  needing  systemic  treatment,  and  more  severe  patients  which  require  systemic  treatment  with 
immunomodulators  and  where  the  benefit  outweighs  the  known  safety  risks.  Thus,  the  request  of 
widening  of  the  indication  to  moderate patients  may in  practice  extend the  indication  to  patients  that 
would be considered mild for some prescribers.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile in the  moderate to severe population seem not  to differ in the nature of AEs. No clear 
information  on  frequency,  seriousness,  time  to  event  or  risk  factors  was  available for  the  moderate 
population. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In  the severe psoriasis treated  patients,  serious adverse events have been reported,  in  line  with  what 
has been described for low dose methotrexate for other conditions. Moderate patients may be less willing  
to  accept  some  adverse events  to  get  the  disease  under  control  as  they  would  if  they  were  severe 
patients.  Moderate patients  tend  to have a shorter disease duration,  be younger and with  an expected 
longer treatment duration. Thus, methotrexate exposition would likely be different. Notwithstanding,  the 
data which supported the severe indication, was mostly based upon analysis of the “moderate to severe”

population, which mostly comprised of moderate patients. Therefore, the discussion on a different safety 
pattern between moderate and severe populations becomes theoretical but not confirmed in practice.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance  of favourable  and unfavourable  effects 
The  favourable  effects  in  the  moderate population  have  not  been  individualized  nor  quantified.  Still, 
given that  most  studied  patients  were in  the  “moderate”  band of  the  spectrum,  data available for  the 
“moderate to severe” band  should adequately cover and be similar to  the “moderate” band, allowing  a 
B/R assessment in moderate psoriasis.  
The unfavourable effects have also  not  been discriminated in  the  “moderate”  population.  Again, given 
the  burden  of  moderate  patients  in  the  studies  which  studied  patients  “moderate  to  severe”,  the  
unfavourable profile should be similar. 
3.7.2.  Balance  of benefits and risks 
The information presented for both  efficacy and safety on the extended population (moderate psoriasis 
patients),  allows the maintenance of the  positive B/R balance in  moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in 
adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk  balance

3.8.  Conclusions 
The proposed extension of the indication in plaque psoriasis from the severe population to the “moderate 
to severe” population is approvable.

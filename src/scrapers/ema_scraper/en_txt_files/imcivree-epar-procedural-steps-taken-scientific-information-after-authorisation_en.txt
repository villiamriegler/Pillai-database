Based on the submitted data and clinical considerations, 
to change posology recommendations in patients 
with renal impairment, based on final results from 
study RM-493-029,  a Phase I, open-label, single-
dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 
setmelanotide in subjects with varying degrees of 
renal impairment; with secondary objectives to 
evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose 
of setmelanotide administered subcutaneously in 
subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
new dosing recommendations (including information on 
dose titration with lowest starting dose and maximum 
dose) for patients with severe renal impairment have been 
added. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with 
mild or moderate renal impairment.

On 22 April 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Nulojix. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharma 
EEIG. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to an existing indication as follows:2  
NULOJIX, in combination with corticosteroids and a mycophenolic acid (MPA), is indicated for 
prophylaxis of graft rejection in adults receiving recipients of a renal transplant (see section 5.1 
for data on renal function). It is recommended to add an interleukin (IL)-2 receptor antagonist for 
induction therapy to this belatacept-based regimen. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

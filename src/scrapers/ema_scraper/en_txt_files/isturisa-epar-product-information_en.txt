4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in endocrinology or internal 
medicine and with access to the appropriate facilities for monitoring of biochemical responses since 
the dose must be adjusted to meet the patient’s therapeutic needs, based on the normalisation of 
cortisol levels. 
Posology 
The recommended starting dose is 2 mg osilodrostat twice daily. For patients of Asian ancestry, a 
reduced starting dose of 1 mg twice daily is recommended (see section 5.2). 
The dose can be gradually titrated (initially by dose increments of 1 or 2 mg) based on individual 
response and tolerability, with the aim to achieve normal cortisol levels. It is recommended that 
cortisol levels (e.g. 24-hour urinary free cortisol, serum/plasma cortisol) be monitored every 1-2 weeks 
until adequate clinical response is maintained. Thereafter, less frequent monitoring may be considered 
as clinically indicated, unless there are reasons for additional monitoring (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Increases in dose should not occur more frequently than once every 1-2 weeks and should be guided 
by the results of cortisol assessments and by the individual clinical response. 
The dose of osilodrostat should be decreased or treatment temporarily interrupted if cortisol levels are 
below the lower limit of normal, or if there is a rapid decrease in cortisol levels to the lower part of the 
normal range, or if the patient has signs or symptoms suggestive of hypocortisolism (see section 4.4). 
Isturisa may be resumed after resolution of symptoms at a lower dose, provided that cortisol levels are 
above the lower limit of normal in the absence of glucocorticoid substitution. Management of other 
suspected adverse reactions at any time during treatment may also require a temporary dose reduction 
or temporary interruption of treatment. 
The usual maintenance dose in clinical studies varied between 2 and 7 mg twice daily. 
The maximum recommended dose of Isturisa is 30 mg twice daily. 
If a dose is missed, the patient should take the prescribed dose at the next scheduled time; the next 
dose should not be doubled. 
Elderly (65 years or above) 
There is no evidence to suggest that dose adjustment is required in patients aged 65 years or above. 
However, data on the use of osilodrostat in this population are limited and Isturisa should therefore be 
used with caution in this age group. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). Urinary free 
cortisol (UFC) levels should be interpreted with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal 
impairment, due to reduced UFC excretion. Alternative methods for cortisol monitoring should be 
considered in these patients. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). For patients 
with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B), the recommended starting dose is 1 mg twice 
daily. For patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), the recommended starting dose is 
1 mg once daily in the evening, with initial up-titration to 1 mg twice daily (see section 5.2). 
Data on use in patients with hepatic impairment is limited. More frequent monitoring of adrenal 
function may be required in patients with hepatic impairment during dose titration. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Isturisa in patients less than 18 years of age have not yet been established.

Method of administration 
Oral use. 
Isturisa can be taken with or without food. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypocortisolism 
Inhibition of cortisol synthesis by osilodrostat has led to hypocortisolism-related events such as 
cortisol withdrawal syndrome (symptomatic decrease of cortisol levels, but still above the lower limit 
of the normal range) and adrenal insufficiency (cortisol levels below the normal range). 
Cortisol levels should be monitored at regular intervals (see section 4.2), since hypocortisolism-related 
events can occur at any time during treatment. Additional monitoring is recommended especially 
during conditions of increased cortisol demand, such as physical or psychological stress, or during 
changes in concomitant medications that may affect osilodrostat exposure (see section 4.5). It is 
recommended to use laboratory methods that do not exhibit significant cross-reactivity with cortisol 
precursors such as 11-deoxycortisol that may increase during osilodrostat treatment. 
Patients should be alerted to the signs and symptoms associated with hypocortisolism (e.g. nausea, 
vomiting, fatigue, abdominal pain, loss of appetite and dizziness). 
Symptomatic patients should be monitored for hypotension, hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia and/or 
hypoglycaemia. If hypocortisolism is suspected, cortisol levels should be measured and temporary 
dose reduction or interruption of osilodrostat considered. If necessary, corticosteroid substitution 
should be initiated. Isturisa may be resumed after resolution of symptoms at a lower dose, provided 
that cortisol levels are above the lower limit of normal in the absence of glucocorticoid substitution. 
QTc prolongation 
In a thorough QT study, osilodrostat was associated with a dose-dependent QT interval prolongation 
(mean maximum estimated QTcF increase by +5.3 ms at the highest recommended dose of 30 mg) 
which may cause cardiac arrhythmias (see section 5.1). Adverse reactions of QT prolongation and 
clinically relevant ECG findings have been reported in clinical studies. 
An ECG should be performed prior to the start of Isturisa treatment, within one week after treatment 
initiation, and as clinically indicated thereafter. If the QTc interval exceeds 480 ms prior to or during 
treatment, cardiology consultation is recommended. Temporary dose reduction or interruption may be 
required. 
Any hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia or hypomagnesaemia should be corrected prior to Isturisa 
administration and electrolyte levels should be monitored periodically during therapy. 
Isturisa should be used with caution and the benefit-risk carefully weighed in patients with risk factors 
for QT prolongation such as: 
- 
- 
congenital long QT syndrome, 
significant cardiovascular disease (including congestive heart failure, recent myocardial 
infarction, unstable angina, sustained ventricular tachycardia, advanced heart block and 
clinically significant bradyarrhythmias), and 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concomitant medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval (see section 4.5). 
- 
If Isturisa is used in patients with these risk factors, more frequent ECG monitoring is recommended. 
Corticotroph tumour growth 
Discontinuation of osilodrostat treatment should be considered in patients who develop MRI-verified 
corticotroph tumour invasiveness during treatment. 
Concomitant use with strong enzyme inhibitors and inducers 
Caution and closer monitoring are advised when co-administered medicinal products that strongly 
inhibit or induce multiple enzymes are introduced or discontinued during osilodrostat treatment (see 
section 4.5), as they may affect osilodrostat exposure and may result in a risk of adverse events (due to 
a potential increase in exposure) or of decreased efficacy (due to a potential decrease in exposure). 
Women of childbearing potential 
Isturisa may cause foetal harm. Pregnancy status should be verified in women of childbearing 
potential prior to the initiation of Isturisa, and these patients should be advised of a potential risk to the 
foetus and of the need to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least one week after 
stopping treatment (see section 4.6). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Potential pharmacodynamic interactions 
Co-administration of osilodrostat with other therapies known to affect the QT interval can lead to QT 
prolongation in patients with known cardiac rhythm disorders (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). A washout 
period should be considered when switching from other products known to affect the QT interval such 
as pasireotide or ketoconazole. 
Effects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of osilodrostat 
The potential for clinical drug-drug interactions (DDI) with concomitantly administered medicinal 
products that inhibit transporters or a single CYP or UGT enzyme is low (see section 5.2). 
Strong enzyme inhibitors 
Caution is advised when co-administered medicinal products that strongly inhibit multiple enzymes 
are introduced or discontinued during osilodrostat treatment (see section 4.4). 
Strong enzyme inducers 
Caution is advised when co-administered medicinal products that strongly induce multiple enzymes 
(e.g. rifampin) are introduced or discontinued during osilodrostat treatment (see section 4.4). 
Effects of osilodrostat on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products 
Because osilodrostat and its major metabolite M34.5 may inhibit and/or induce multiple enzymes and 
transporters, general caution is advised when osilodrostat is co-administered with sensitive enzyme or 
transporter substrates with a narrow therapeutic index. Available interaction data is summarised below 
(see also section 5.2). 
Clinical studies 
In a healthy volunteer study (n=20) using a single dose of 50 mg osilodrostat and a probe drug 
cocktail, osilodrostat was found to be a mild inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5, a mild to moderate 
inhibitor of CYP2C19, and a moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2. 
- 
CYP2D6 – AUC geometric mean ratio of 1.5 for dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) when 
dosed with osilodrostat compared to when dosed alone. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
CYP3A4 – AUC geometric mean ratio of 1.5 for midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) when dosed 
with osilodrostat compared to when dosed alone. 
CYP2C19 –AUC geometric mean ratio of 1.9 for omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate) when dosed 
with osilodrostat compared to when dosed alone. However, an in vitro signal of time-dependent 
inhibition has been observed, thus the consequence following repeated dosing is unclear. 
Osilodrostat should be used with caution when co-administered with sensitive CYP2C19 
substrates with a narrow therapeutic index. 
CYP1A2 –AUC geometric mean ratio of 2.5 for caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate) when dosed with 
osilodrostat compared to when dosed alone. However, an in vitro signal of CYP1A2 induction 
has been observed, thus the consequence following repeated dosing is unclear. Osilodrostat 
should be used with caution when co-administered with sensitive CYP1A2 substrates with a 
narrow therapeutic index such as theophylline and tizanidine. 
In a healthy volunteer study (n=24), osilodrostat (30 mg twice daily for 7 days before concomitant 
administration with a combined oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl oestradiol and 0.15 mg 
levonorgestrel and continued for another 5 days) did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the 
AUC and Cmax of ethinyl estradiol (geometric mean ratio: 1.03 and 0.88, respectively) and AUC of 
levonorgestrel (geometric mean ratio: 1.02). The Cmax of levonorgestrel fell slightly outside the 
bioequivalence acceptance range (geometric mean ratio: 0.86; 90% confidence interval : 0.737-1.00). 
The effects of a longer induction period and an interaction with other hormonal contraceptives have 
not been studied (see also sections 4.4 and 4.6). 
In vitro data 
In vitro data for osilodrostat and its major metabolite M34.5 suggest a potential for both inhibition and 
induction for CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4/5, a potential for time-dependent inhibition of 
CYP2C19, and an inhibitory potential for CYP2E1 and UGT1A1. It cannot be excluded that 
osilodrostat may affect the exposure of sensitive substrates for these enzymes. 
In vitro data for osilodrostat and its major metabolite M34.5 suggest an inhibitory potential for 
OATP1B1, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3 and MATE1. It cannot be excluded that osilodrostat may 
affect the exposure of sensitive substrates for these transporters. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Based on preclinical data, osilodrostat may cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant 
woman. A pregnancy test before initiating treatment is recommended in women of childbearing 
potential. Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and for at least 
one week after treatment. If hormonal contraceptives other than the oral combination of 
ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel are used, an additional barrier method of contraception is 
recommended (see section 4.5). 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of osilodrostat in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Isturisa should not be used during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether osilodrostat or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with 
Isturisa and for at least one week after treatment. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fertility 
There is no information on the effect of osilodrostat on human fertility. Animal studies have shown 
effects on the menstrual cycle and reduced female fertility in rats (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Isturisa may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be 
warned about the potential for dizziness and fatigue (see section 4.8) and should be advised not to 
drive or use machines if these symptoms occur. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequent adverse reactions reported in the pivotal phase III study with osilodrostat were 
adrenal insufficiency (51%), fatigue (44%), oedema (21%), vomiting (22%), nausea (42%) and 
headache (34%). 
The most serious adverse reaction associated with the use of osilodrostat is adrenal insufficiency (see 
also sections 4.2 and 4.4).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
CYP11B1 inhibition by osilodrostat is associated with adrenal steroid precursor accumulation and 
testosterone increases. In a clinical study with osilodrostat, mean testosterone levels in female patients 
increased from high normal at baseline to above the upper limit of the normal range. The increases 
reversed when treatment was interrupted. The testosterone increase was associated with mild to 
moderate cases of hirsutism or acne in a subset of patients. 
ACTH values above 10-fold upper limit of normal were observed in some Cushing’s disease patients 
treated with osilodrostat in the clinical studies (see section 5.1) and may be associated with cortisol 
values below the lower limit of normal. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
Overdosage may result in severe hypocortisolism. Signs and symptoms suggestive of hypocortisolism 
may include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, low blood pressure, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, dizziness 
and syncope. 
In case of suspected overdosage, Isturisa should be interrupted, cortisol levels checked, and if 
necessary corticosteroid supplementation initiated. Close surveillance may be necessary including 
monitoring of the QT interval, blood pressure, glucose, fluid and electrolyte balance until the patient’s 
condition is stable.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Anticorticosteroids, ATC code: H02CA02 
Mechanism of action 
Osilodrostat is a cortisol synthesis inhibitor. It potently inhibits 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1), the 
enzyme responsible for the final step of cortisol biosynthesis in the adrenal gland. 
CYP11B1 inhibition is associated with the accumulation of precursors such as 11-deoxycortisol and 
acceleration of adrenal biosynthesis including androgens. In Cushing’s disease, the fall in plasma 
cortisol concentration also stimulates ACTH secretion, via the feedback mechanism which accelerates 
steroid biosynthesis (see section 4.8). 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In a thorough QT study (n=86 male and female healthy volunteers) with osilodrostat, the maximum 
QTcF interval duration differences to placebo were 1.73 ms (90% CI: 0.15, 3.31) at the 10 mg dose 
and 25.38 ms (90% CI: 23.53, 27.22) at a supratherapeutic dose of 150 mg. Based on an interpolation 
of these results, the mean maximum prolongation at the highest recommended dose of 30 mg is 
estimated to be +5.3 ms. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of osilodrostat in patients with Cushing’s disease were evaluated in a 
prospective phase III study (study C2301) that used a randomised withdrawal design. The study 
consisted of a 26-week open-label period of single-arm osilodrostat treatment, followed by an 8-week 
randomised withdrawal period in which patients were randomised in 1:1 ratio to either osilodrostat or 
placebo and a subsequent osilodrostat open-label period. 
The eligibility criteria included Cushing’s disease (with confirmation of the pituitary source of excess 
adrenocorticotrophic hormone), and a mean urinary free cortisol (mUFC, derived from three 24-hour 
urine collections) value greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening. 
A total of 137 adult patients were enrolled. The mean age was 41.2 years, and the majority of patients 
were female (77%). Seven patients were aged 65 years or older. Prior therapy included pituitary 
surgery in 88% of patients and prior medical therapy in 75% of patients. The mean and median 
baseline mUFC levels were 1006.0 nmol/24 h and 476.4 nmol/24 h, respectively 
(ULN: 138 nmol/24 h). Co-morbidities at baseline included hypertension (67.9% of patients), obesity 
(29.9%), diabetes mellitus (21.9%) and osteoporosis (27.7%). 
Patients received a starting dose of 2 mg osilodrostat twice daily and the dose could be up-titrated 
based on individual response and tolerability during an initial 12-week period. Patients with no further 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dose increases during the following 12 weeks and with a mUFC ≤ULN at week 24 were randomised in 
a 1:1 ratio at week 26 to receive either osilodrostat or matching placebo for 8 weeks (double-blind 
randomised withdrawal period), followed by open-label osilodrostat for the remainder of the study. At 
week 26, 71 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to continue receiving osilodrostat (n=36) or to 
switch to placebo (n=35). Patients who were not eligible for randomisation at week 24 (n=47) 
continued on open-label osilodrostat treatment. 
The primary objective was to compare the proportion of complete responders at week 34 (the end of 
the 8-week randomised withdrawal period) between patients randomised to continued active treatment 
and placebo. For the primary endpoint, a complete response was defined as a mUFC value ≤ULN at 
week 34. Patients whose dose was increased during the randomised withdrawal period or who 
discontinued randomised treatment were considered non-responders. The key secondary endpoint was 
the complete response rate at week 24. Patients with dose increases between weeks 12 and 24 and 
patients with no valid mUFC assessment at week 24 were counted as non-responders for the key 
secondary endpoint. 
The study met its primary and key secondary endpoints (Table 2). 
Median mUFC levels decreased to 62.5 nmol/24 h (-84.1% change from baseline, n=125) at week 12, 
to 75.5 nmol/24 h (-82.3%, n=125) at week 24 and to 63.3 nmol/24 h (-87.9%, n=108) at week 48.

The efficacy of osilodrostat was also assessed in study C1201 in nine adult Japanese patients with 
non-pituitary causes of Cushing’s syndrome. The study enrolled patients with adrenal adenoma (n=5), 
ectopic corticotropin syndrome (n=3) and ACTH-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia 
(n=1), and consisted of a 12-week dose titration period (starting dose 2 mg twice daily), a 36-week 
maintenance period and an optional long-term extension. At week 12 (primary endpoint) a complete 
response (mUFC ≤ULN) was observed in 6 patients (66.7%) and a partial response (mUFC decrease 
by at least 50%) in one additional patient (11.1%). The median average dose used in the study was 
2.6 mg/day (range 1.3-7.5 mg/day). The mean duration of treatment in this study was 24 weeks, and 
long-term exposure was limited. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Isturisa in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in adrenal cortical hyperfunction (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Osilodrostat is a highly soluble, highly permeable compound (BCS class 1). It is rapidly absorbed (tmax 
~1 h) and oral absorption in humans is assumed to be nearly complete. Steady state is reached by 
day 2. 
Co-administration with food did not affect absorption to a clinically significant extent. In a healthy 
volunteer study (n=20), the administration of a single dose of 30 mg osilodrostat with a high-fat meal 
resulted in a modest reduction of AUC and Cmax by 11% and 21%, respectively, and the median tmax 
was delayed from 1 to 2.5 hours. 
No clinically relevant accumulation was observed in clinical studies. An accumulation ratio of 1.3 was 
estimated for the 2 to 30 mg dose range. 
Distribution 
The median apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of osilodrostat is approximately 100 litres. Protein 
binding of osilodrostat and of its major metabolite M34.5 is low (less than 40%) and 
concentration-independent. The osilodrostat blood-to-plasma concentration ratio is 0.85. 
Osilodrostat is not a substrate for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 transporters. 
Biotransformation 
In a human ADME study in healthy subjects following the administration of a single dose of 50 mg 
[14C]-osilodrostat, metabolism was deemed the most important clearance pathway for osilodrostat 
since ~80% of the dose was excreted as metabolites. The three main metabolites in plasma (M34.5, 
M16.5 and M24.9) represented 51%, 9% and 7% of the dose, respectively. Both M34.5 and M24.9 
have longer half-lives than osilodrostat and some accumulation is expected with twice-daily dosing. 
The decrease in the contribution of osilodrostat to the radioactivity AUC with time post-dose was 
found to coincide closely with a corresponding increase in the contribution of M34.5. 
Thirteen metabolites were characterised in the urine, with the three main metabolites being M16.5, 
M22 (an M34.5 glucuronide) and M24.9, with 17, 13 and 11% of the dose, respectively. The 
formation of the major urinary metabolite M16.5 (direct N-glucuronide) was catalysed by UGT1A4, 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2B7 and 2B10. Less than 1% of the dose was excreted as M34.5 (di-oxygenated osilodrostat) in the 
urine but 13% of the dose was identified as M22 (M34.5-glucuronide). The formation of M34.5 was 
non-CYP-mediated. 
Multiple CYP enzymes and UDP glucuronosyltransferases contribute to osilodrostat metabolism and 
no single enzyme contributes more than 25% to the total clearance. The main CYP enzymes involved 
in osilodrostat metabolism are CYP3A4, 2B6 and 2D6. Total CYP contribution is 26%, total UGT 
contribution is 19% and non-CYP non-UGT mediated metabolism was shown to contribute to ~50% 
of total clearance. In addition, osilodrostat showed a high intrinsic permeability, low efflux ratio and 
modest impact of inhibitors on the efflux ratio in vitro. This suggests that the potential for clinical 
drug-drug interactions (DDI) with concomitantly administered medicinal products that inhibit 
transporters or a single CYP or UGT enzyme is low. 
In vitro data indicate that the metabolites do not contribute to the pharmacological effect of 
osilodrostat. 
Elimination 
The elimination half-life of osilodrostat is approximately 4 hours. 
In an ADME study, the majority (91%) of the radioactive dose of osilodrostat was eliminated in the 
urine, with only a minor amount eliminated in the faeces (1.6% of dose). The low percentage of the 
dose eliminated in the urine as unchanged osilodrostat (5.2%) indicates that metabolism is the major 
clearance pathway in humans. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Exposure (AUCinf and Cmax) increased more than dose-proportionally over the therapeutic dose range. 
Drug-drug interactions (see also section 4.5) 
In vitro data indicate that neither osilodrostat nor its major metabolite M34.5 inhibits the following 
enzymes and transporters at clinically relevant concentrations: CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
UGT2B7, P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, MRP2, OATP1B3 and MATE2-K. Since the exposure of M34.5 has 
not yet been determined after repeated dosing, the clinical relevance of the in vitro drug-drug 
interaction results for M34.5 is unknown. 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
In a phase I study in 33 subjects with varying degrees of hepatic function using a single dose of 30 mg 
osilodrostat, AUCinf was 1.4- and 2.7-fold higher in the moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe 
(Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment cohorts, respectively. Cmax was 15 and 20% lower in the moderate 
and severe cohorts. The terminal half-life increased to 9.3 hours and 19.5 hours in the moderate and 
severe cohorts. Mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) did not influence exposure to any significant 
extent. The absorption rate was not affected by the degree of hepatic impairment. 
Renal impairment 
In a phase I study in 15 subjects with varying degrees of renal function using a single dose of 30 mg 
osilodrostat, comparable systemic exposure was seen in subjects with severe renal impairment, 
end-stage renal disease and normal renal function. 
Race/ethnicity and bodyweight 
The relative bioavailability was approximately 20% higher in Asian patients compared to other 
ethnicities. Body weight was not shown to be a major determinant of this difference. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Age and gender 
Age and gender had no significant impact on osilodrostat exposure in adults. The number of elderly 
patients in clinical studies was limited (see section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In repeat dose toxicity studies conducted in mice, rats and dogs, the central nervous system, liver, 
female reproductive organs, and the adrenal gland were the primary target organs. The NOAEL for 
hepatic, reproductive organ and adrenal effects in long-term (26- and 39-week) studies was at least 
four-fold human clinical exposure based on AUC. CNS findings (aggression, hypersensitivity to touch 
and increased or decreased activity) were noted in the rat, mouse and dog. The NOAEL for the CNS 
effects was approximately 2-fold human free Cmax based on the most sensitive species. 
Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity 
Genotoxicity assays conducted in vitro in bacterial systems and in vitro and in vivo in mammalian 
systems with and without metabolic activation do not indicate a relevant risk in humans. In rat and 
mice carcinogenicity studies, an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenoma/carcinoma (at lower 
doses in males than females), and neoplastic changes of thyroid follicular adenoma/carcinoma (in male 
rats only) were observed. The findings are likely rodent specific and considered not relevant to 
humans. 
Fertility and reproductive toxicity 
Reproductive studies in rabbits and rats demonstrated embryotoxicity, foetotoxicity (increased 
resorptions and decreased foetal viability, decreased foetal weights, external malformations, and 
visceral and skeletal variations) and teratogenicity at maternally toxic doses. The NOAEL was 10-fold 
human exposure (AUC) in a pre- and postnatal developmental study, and 8- to 73-fold human 
exposure (AUC) in a rat fertility and early embryonic development study. The maternal and foetal 
NOAEL in the rabbit embryofoetal development study was 0.6-fold human exposure (AUC). 
Juvenile toxicity 
The findings in juvenile rat toxicity studies were largely consistent with those observed in adult rat 
studies. Delayed sexual maturation was noted at high doses with no effects on overall reproductive 
performance or parameters after a 6-week recovery period. There were no effects on long bone growth 
or behavioural performance.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Isturisa is and what it is used for 
What Isturisa is 
Isturisa is a medicine that contains the active substance osilodrostat. 
What Isturisa is used for 
Isturisa is used in adults to treat endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, a condition in which the body 
produces too much of a hormone called cortisol. Too much cortisol may lead to a variety of symptoms 
such as weight gain (particularly around the waist), a moon-shaped face, bruising easily, irregular 
periods, excessive body and facial hair, and generally feeling weak, tired or unwell. 
How Isturisa works 
Isturisa blocks the main enzyme that makes cortisol in the adrenal glands. The effect of this is to 
decrease the over-production of cortisol and improve the symptoms of endogenous Cushing’s 
syndrome. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Isturisa 
Do not take Isturisa: 
- 
if you are allergic to osilodrostat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Isturisa. 
If any of the following apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Isturisa: 
- 
if you have a heart disorder or a heart rhythm disorder, such as an irregular heartbeat, including 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a condition called prolonged QT syndrome (QT interval prolongation). 
if you have a liver disease; your doctor may need to change your dose of Isturisa. 
- 
Contact your doctor immediately if you have two or more of these symptoms during your treatment 
with Isturisa. This may indicate that you have adrenal insufficiency (low cortisol levels): 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
weakness 
light-headedness 
tiredness 
lack of appetite 
nausea (feeling sick) 
vomiting 
Tests before and during treatment 
Your doctor will test your blood and/or urine before you start treatment and regularly during 
treatment. This is to detect any possible abnormalities in your magnesium, calcium and potassium 
levels and also to measure the levels of cortisol. Depending on the results, your doctor may change 
your dose. 
This medicine may have an unwanted effect (called QT prolongation) on the function of the heart. 
Your doctor will therefore also check for this effect by performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) before 
you start treatment and during treatment. 
If your Cushing’s syndrome is caused by a benign tumour (called adenoma) in the pituitary gland, 
your doctor may consider stopping your treatment if a pituitary scan shows that the adenoma has 
expanded into neighbouring regions. 
Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not recommended for patients aged under 18 years. This is because there is a lack of 
data in these patients. 
Other medicines and Isturisa 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. It is 
particularly important that you mention any of the following medicines: 
- 
medicines that may have an unwanted effect (called QT prolongation) on the function of the 
heart. These include medicines used for abnormal heart rhythm such as quinidine, sotalol and 
amiodarone; medicines used for allergies (antihistamines); antidepressants such as amitriptyline 
and drugs for mental health disorders (antipsychotics); antibiotics, including the following 
types: macrolides, fluoroquinolones or imidazole; and other medicines for Cushing’s disease 
(pasireotide, ketoconazole) 
theophylline (used to treat breathing problems) or tizanidine (used to treat muscle pain and 
muscle cramps) 
- 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
This medicine should not be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding, unless your doctor has advised 
you to do so. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have 
a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
Contraception 
Women who could become pregnant should use an effective method of contraception during treatment 
and for at least one week after the last dose. Ask your doctor about the need for contraception before 
you start taking Isturisa. 
Driving and using machines 
Dizziness and tiredness may occur during treatment with Isturisa. Do not drive or operate machines if 
you get these symptoms. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
How to take Isturisa 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. 
The usual starting dose is two 1 mg tablets twice a day (about every 12 hours). Patients of Asian 
ancestry and patients with liver disease may need a lower starting dose (one 1 mg tablet twice a day). 
After you have started treatment, your doctor may change your dose. This will depend on how you 
respond to the treatment. The highest recommended dose is 30 mg twice a day. 
Isturisa tablets are taken by mouth and can be taken with or without food. 
If you take more Isturisa than you should 
If you have taken more Isturisa than you should and you feel unwell (for example if you feel weak, 
light-headed, tired or sick, or if you have to vomit), or if someone else accidentally takes your 
medicine, contact a doctor or hospital for advice immediately. Medical treatment may be needed. 
If you forget to take Isturisa 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Instead, just wait until it is time for your 
next dose and take that at the scheduled time. 
If you stop taking Isturisa 
Do not stop taking Isturisa unless your doctor tells you to. If you stop your treatment with Isturisa, 
your symptoms may come back. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Some side effects may be serious. Please take particular note of the following: 
- 
Tell your doctor immediately if you experience a heart disorder or heart rhythm disorder, such 
as a fast and irregular heartbeat, even when you are at rest, heart palpitations, blackouts or 
fainting (this could be a sign of a condition called QT prolongation, a side effect that may affect 
up to 1 in 10 people). 
Tell your doctor immediately if you have two or more of these symptoms: weakness, 
light-headedness, tiredness (fatigue), lack of appetite, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting. This may 
indicate that you have adrenal insufficiency (low cortisol levels), a side effect that may affect 
more than 1 in 10 people. Adrenal insufficiency occurs when Isturisa lowers the amount of 
cortisol too much. It is more likely to occur during periods of increased stress. Your doctor will 
correct this by using a hormone medicine or by adjusting the dose of Isturisa. 
- 
Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
vomiting 
nausea (feeling sick) 
diarrhoea 
abdominal pain 
tiredness (fatigue) 
build-up of fluid leading to swelling (oedema), particularly of your ankles 
abnormal blood tests (increased levels of testosterone, increased levels of adrenocorticotrophic 
hormone, also known as ACTH, low levels of potassium)

Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  EMA  Decisions 
P/177/2011 (for vildagliptin) and P/169/2010 (for vildagliptin/metformin) on the granting of a product-
specific waiver. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Vildagliptin is an oral antidiabetic agent which belongs to the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors 
class. It was approved in the EU under the name Galvus in September 2007. Two additional marketing 
authorisations were granted in EU for duplicate licenses in November 2008 (Jalra and Xiliarx). The 
fixed dose combination with metformin was approved in November 2007 as Eucreas and duplicate 
licenses in December 2008 (Icandra and Zomarist). 
Despite the benefits patients have from combination treatment of insulin and oral anti-diabetic (OAD), 
the use certain OADs is associated with increased risk of hypoglycaemia and/or weight gain. Thus, 
there is currently an unmet medical need for patients with T2DM who would benefit from insulin-OAD 
combination treatment to add another effective drug with good tolerability to the armamentarium of 
oral agents available for combination with insulin.  
The present submission provides safety and efficacy data in support of a new indication for vildagliptin 
in combination with insulin (with or without metformin).  
The MAH proposes that a positive benefit-risk balance has been established to allow for usage of 
vildagliptin in combination with insulin (with or without metformin), as follows: 
“Vildagliptin is also indicated for use in combination with insulin (with or without metformin) when diet 
and exercise plus a stable dose of insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control” 
In addition, an update of Sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in accordance with the safety and 
efficacy data provided in this application is proposed.

T2DM = type 2 diabetes; vilda = vildagliptin; sita = sitagliptin. 
The MAH have conducted two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with the objective to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin in combination with insulin in insulin-treated patients 
with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with insufficient glycaemic control. Study CLAF237A23135 included 
patient with T2DM treated with basal and premixed insulin, with or without metformin. This study is 
considered pivotal for the indication.  
The second study, Study CLAF237A2311 (which was submitted with the original marketing 
authorization application), included patients on insulin treated with any insulin regimen resulting in

almost half of the patients being treated with 3 or more insulin injections and insulin doses of 
approximately 80 U/day. Moreover, concomitant metformin was not allowed. Therefore, the study is 
not considered fully representative of current clinical practice.  
In addition, two 6 months studies in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment 
(CLAF237A23137 and CLAF237A23138) previously submitted  and assessed within procedure 
EMEA/H/C/771/1048/1051/WS/149 are provided as supportive evidence given that the majority of 
patients in these two studies (68% to 82% across studies and degree of renal impairment) were 
treated with insulin. 
2.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study CLAF237A23135 
This was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study with a 24-
week treatment period. Following a 2-week screening period, patients with T2DM receiving a stable 
dose of long-acting, intermediate-acting or pre-mixed insulin by one or two daily injection with or 
without stable metformin treatment were randomized 1:1 to treatment with vildagliptin 50 mg bid or 
placebo.  
No dose finding study was performed. The vildagliptin dose selected corresponds to the already 
approved dosing regimen which is acceptable. 
Patient enrolment was stratified by metformin use and conducted to achieve an approximately 60/40 
ratio of patients receiving concomitant metformin treatment or no metformin treatment, respectively. 
Additionally, patients were stratified by the type of insulin (long-acting vs. intermediate-acting or pre-
mixed insulin). Following screening, scheduled study visits were at Week 0 (start of study treatment), 
then at 4-week intervals: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 (end of study treatment) weeks, as depicted in 
Figure 1 below. 
Patients continued on a stable dose of long or intermediate-acting or pre-mixed insulin and metformin, 
if applicable, throughout the study. 
Figure 1 Design of study CLAF237A23135 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/565928/2012

The overall study design is acceptable. Both patients with metformin treatment and without such 
treatment were included and patients were stratified by metformin use, allowing assessment of both 
combinations.  
Main inclusion and exclusion criteria 
The study population consisted of male and female patients with T2DM, who had to be 18 to 80 years 
old, with HbA1c between ≥7.5 and ≤11% and FPG <270 mg/dL (15 mmol/L) at screening visit. Patients 
had to be treated with a stable dose (≤1 unit/kg/day) of long-acting, intermediate-acting or pre-mixed 
insulin for at least 12 weeks prior to screening visit. Patients could also be treated with a stable dose of 
metformin (≥1500 mg qd or a maximally tolerated dose) for at least 12 weeks prior to Visit 1. Body 
mass index had to be 22-40 kg/m2. 
Patients were excluded if treated with other OAD than metformin. Other important exclusion criteria 
were significant cardiovascular (CV) disease (e.g. congestive heart failure NYHA III or IV, recent 
myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke). 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are adequate and would identify a representative population on a 
stable background therapy. Of note, patients with significant CV disease were excluded. This is 
acceptable. Current experience regarding CV safety with vildagliptin and use in patients with CHF has 
been assessed both in procedures EMEA/H/C/771/WS/06/G and EMEA/H/771/WS/187. It was 
concluded that there was no indication of an increased risk of CV events with vildagliptin in a 
population which included 16-18 % high risk patients. Furthermore, analysis of data in patients with 
documented CHF did not indicate an increased incidence of overall adverse events (AEs) or cardiac (i.e. 
arrhythmic, heart failure-related or ischaemic) AEs with vildagliptin relative to all comparators. 
Although there are limitations to the available data, there are currently no safety signals with regards 
to cardiac safety.  
Objectives and endpoints 
The primary efficacy objective was to demonstrate superiority of vildagliptin vs. placebo for the change 
in HbA1c from baseline to study endpoint in the overall population.   
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline to study endpoint in the full 
analysis set (FAS). 
Key secondary efficacy objective was to demonstrate superiority of vildagliptin vs. placebo in the 
subgroups using insulin alone or insulin + metformin.  
Other secondary objectives included evaluation of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and responder rates 
defined as proportion of patients reaching predefined HbA1c target. 
The chosen objectives and outcomes are adequate. The primary objective is in line with the recently 
adopted “Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of diabetes” 
(CPMP/EWP/1080 Rev.1). The key secondary endpoint is relevant for the evaluation of the subgroups 
of patients treated with or without metformin. In addition an exploratory endpoint, investigating 
measures of insulin resistance and sensitivity as well as pancreatic β-cell function, was included. This 
will however not be further discussed in this report. 
Treatments 
Patients were instructed to take one tablet (vildagliptin 50 mg or vildagliptin 50 mg matching placebo) 
before the breakfast meal every day and one tablet (vildagliptin 50 mg or vildagliptin 50 mg matching 
placebo) before the evening meal every day except the day of the study visit. 
Adjustments to the dose of study medication or metformin were not allowed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/565928/2012  
Page 7/50 
 
 
 
 
Insulin 
The dose of insulin had to remain stable or within a 10% increase of the baseline dose throughout the 
trial (with no change in frequency or insulin type) unless dose adjustments were required for safety 
reasons at the investigator’s discretion. This could include insulin dose decreases for safety reasons at 
anytime without specific dose limits. 
The addition of rapid or short-acting insulin and/or additional doses or amounts of the patient’s usual 
insulin according to rescue medication criteria was allowed. 
Rescue medication 
Rescue medication included rapid or short acting insulin and/or additional doses or amounts of the 
patient’s usual long-acting, intermediate-acting or pre-mixed insulin when administered according to 
prespecified criteria and when elevated glucose was not due to illness, or other incidental circumstance 
potentially causing deterioration of glucose control. No medications other than these specified insulin 
alterations were considered as rescue medication. Within the specified guidelines the insulin type, dose 
and dose frequency used for rescue were at the investigator’s discretion. 
Patients were to maintain stable metformin and insulin doses throughout the study. Instructions for 
allowed insulin dose adjustments (within a 10 % increase from baseline) as well as for rescue 
medication (insulin) were in place. This is of importance considering the study duration of 24 weeks 
with a placebo control in order not to jeopardise the wellbeing of the participants. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy variable was the change from HbA1c (unit in %) measurement at baseline to the 
study endpoint, censored at the start of major change in insulin background therapy. The superiority of 
vildagliptin 50mg bid over placebo was evaluated by testing the following hypothesis: 
H0: δ  vilda 50mg bid + insulin = δ  placebo + insulin versus Ha: δ vilda 50mg bid + insulin < δ  placebo + insulin 
where δ are the change from baseline to study endpoint in HbA1c in the treatment group indicated. 
The primary efficacy variable was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with 
treatment, pooled center, metformin use stratum and type of insulin stratum as the classification 
variable and baseline HbA1c as the covariate. A closed testing hierarchical methodology was used to 
maintain an overall 2.5% level for the primary one sided hypothesis and the two key secondary 
onesided hypotheses (namely the same variable assessed within the sub-populations of patients 
treated with insulin and concomitant metformin therapy, and patients treated with insulin only). The 
analysis of the primary efficacy variable using the Full analysis set was the primary basis of conclusion. 
A sensitivity analysis based on the PP set was also performed to assess the robustness of the 
conclusion. 
The percentage of patients meeting each of the pre-defined responder criteria (categorical changes in 
HbA1c) was summarized in both the Full analysis and Per Protocol sets. 
In addition to the two key secondary objectives, further secondary efficacy variables consisted of FPG 
and the exploratory efficacy variables (insulin resistance and sensitivity, beta-cell function parameters 
from oGTT). These variables were analyzed using the same ANCOVA model as specified for the primary 
efficacy variable. 
All efficacy analyses were performed on data censored at the start of major changes in the insulin 
background therapy. Major change in insulin background therapy was defined as: a) rescue medication 
taken for ≥7 days in any 30-day period or ≥5 days consecutively, or b) any change (for reasons other 
than rescue) in insulin frequency and/or insulin type and/or ≥10% increase in dose for ≥7 days in any 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/565928/2012  
Page 8/50 
 
 
 
 
30-day period or ≥5 days consecutively. In addition, changes in HbA1c were analyzed also using 
uncensored data. 
Demographic and background data as well as safety data were summarized by treatment group. 
Handling of missing data 
Data after discontinuations for any reason (or if final schedule visit measurement is missing for any 
reason) were imputed by carrying the last on-treatment measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) 
forward (LOCF) through the final schedule visit (Week 24 visit). 
Patients who started major changes in insulin background therapy were considered as censored from 
the start date of major changes in insulin onward. Data after the start of major changes in insulin were 
imputed by the last on-treatment measurement before or at the start of major insulin therapy 
changes, carried forward (LOCF) through the final schedule study visit (Week 24 visit). 
Statistical methods were generally adequate. 
The initiation of rescue medication should be seen as evidence of lack of efficacy. The use of censoring 
and LOCF should hence imply that subjects in need of a major change in insulin background therapy 
were treated as “failures” in the analyses. Of importance to support the primary analysis is however 
the sensitivity analysis without censoring of data. This may be considered a more conservative analysis 
under the assumption that it will be more subjects in the placebo arm that needed rescue/a major 
change in insulin background therapy. 
Regarding the HbA1c responder analyses the same approach as in the primary analysis seems to have 
been used (i.e. LOCF). This should, analogous the primary analysis, imply a non-responder imputation 
in subjects who were censored due to a major change in insulin background therapy. However, the 
same, i.e. a non-responder imputation, is not necessarily true for patients who discontinued study 
treatment but is depending on the reason for discontinuation.  
2.2.2.  Results 
Disposition of patients 
A total of 717 patients were screened for eligibility and 268 failed screening. The most common 
reasons for screen failure were having not met diagnostic/severity criteria (49.6% of all screen 
failures) and unacceptable laboratory values (48.5%). 
The randomization scheme resulted in an approximate 1:1 allocation for vildagliptin 50 mg bid and 
placebo, 228 and 221 patients respectively enrolled in the trial. The percentage of patients who 
discontinued was slightly higher in the placebo group mainly due to a higher percentage of patients 
that were lost to follow-up or who withdrew consent. Discontinuations due to AEs were infrequent, with 
a slightly higher incidence in the vildagliptin group than in the placebo group (Table 3). The largest 
imbalance was observed due to loss of follow-up (7 vs 0 in the placebo and vildagliptin groups 
respectively).

Table 3 Patient disposition (Randomized set) 
Table 4 Number (%) of patients in the analysis sets 
Percentages are based on the number of patients in the Randomized set. 
No major differences between treatment groups were observed for other protocol deviations not 
leading to exclusion from any analysis population. Most frequent was mis-stratification with regard of 
insulin type during randomization that occurred in 51.8% of patients in the vildagliptin group and 
47.5% of patients in the placebo group, and oGTT test not performed at Visits 2, 5 and/or 8 (18.9% 
vs. 20.4%). The oGTT was made for exploratory purposes and the lack of data is therefore not crucial 
for the current assessment. 
The high numbers of mis-stratification was due to incorrect choice of insulin type by the investigators 
in the IRT system. Sites were instructed to enter in the IRT system the type of insulin for a patient as 
long-acting or pre-mixed/intermediate. However, a number of investigators entered the incorrect 
insulin type and the patients were stratified by the IRT system by this designation. The mis-
stratification did not result in unbalanced distribution of the three different types of insulin (long-
acting, intermediate and premixed) in the two treatment groups. Given the inaccuracies within the IRT 
insulin category data, the insulin categories from the eCRF were considered for the primary or 
secondary analysis. 
Conduct of the study 
There were no amendments to the study protocol (released on 8-Jul-2010). 
A total of 67 centers in 11 countries enrolled at least one patient (number of centers in brackets): 
Australia (5), Belgium (4), Czech Republic (6), Germany (13), Guatemala (5), Hong-Kong (2), Hungary 
(5), India (10), Romania (4), Slovakia (9), United Kingdom (4). Forty-five out of 67 sites were located 
in Europe.

Randomisation and blinding 
At Visit 2 all eligible patients were randomized via IRT to one of the two treatment arms. Patients were 
stratified by: 
•  With or without concomitant metformin therapy; 
•  Type of insulin (long-acting vs. intermediate-acting/pre-mixed, regardless of rapid or short-
acting insulin included in pre-mixed formulations). 
Patients, investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, and data analysts remained blinded 
to the identity of the treatments from the time of randomization until database lock. 
Randomisation and blinding procedures were generally adequate, although mis-stratification occurred. 
As explained above, this was apparently due to difficulties in filling the form with regards to insulin 
treatment.  Although the different types of insulin regimens (long-acting vs intermediate-
acting/premixed) may be used in slightly different populations, the mis-stratification is not considered 
to affect the outcome.  
Baseline demographics and background characteristics 
Both treatment groups were well-balanced for most demographic and patient disease background 
characteristics at baseline. 
Both treatment groups were well-balanced for all patient characteristics at baseline (Table 5- 2). Mean 
age was 59 years in both groups, and approximately 30% of patients were ≥65 years of age. The 
proportion of male/female patients was balanced (nearly 1:1) in both treatment groups. Most patients 
were Caucasian, followed by Asian (predominantly Indian ethnicity) and Other (predominantly 
Hispanic/Latino ethnicity). Mean BMI was 29 kg/m2 in both treatment groups.

Similar baseline characteristics as for the overall RAN population were seen in the subset of the RAN 
patients with (139 vildagliptin and 137 placebo) and without (89 vildagliptin and 84 placebo) 
concomitant metformin use except for a slightly lower body weight in patients without concomitant 
metformin use (75.4 and 74.8 kg in the vildagliptin and placebo groups, respectively). 
Most patient baseline background characteristics were comparable between both treatment groups. 
Mean HbA1c was 8.8% in both treatment groups, and distribution to BMI baseline categories was 
similar in both groups. FPG was slightly higher in the vildagliptin than in the placebo group (9.6 vs. 9.1 
mmol/L). Mean duration of type 2 diabetes was 13 years in both groups. 
Prior treatment with insulin was also comparable in both treatment groups. The proportion of patients 
using premixed insulin was higher than of intermediate or long-acting insulin, with comparable 
proportions of patients in both treatment groups. The number of insulin injections per day (1.8 in both 
treatment groups), duration of insulin use (4.4 years in both groups) and the mean total daily insulin 
dose (39.9 and 41.9 units in the vildagliptin and placebo groups, respectively) were also well balanced 
in both treatment groups. In spite of the mis-stratification, prior insulin treatment was balanced. 
The mean metformin daily doses at screening were similar, with 1928 mg/day in the vildagliptin and 
1948 mg/day in the placebo group. Mean metformin doses were adequate, indicating that the patients 
included were true treatment failures. 
Overall similar baseline background characteristics as for the overall RAN population were seen in both 
subsets of the RAN patients with and without concomitant metformin. Higher proportion of patients 
(71.1%) was treated with premixed insulin in the insulin without concomitant metformin subgroup 
than in the insulin and metformin subgroup (54.0%). 
Apart from the study indication, non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, most frequent medical 
conditions were vascular disorders (68.9% and 73.8% of patients in the vildagliptin and placebo 
groups, respectively, of these the most frequent was hypertension, 68.0% and 71.5% of patients, 
respectively). Also frequently reported were nervous system disorders (37.7% vs. 38.5%, most 
frequently peripheral neuropathy, 31.6% vs. 32.6%), surgical and medical procedures (29.4% vs. 
24.4%), eye disorders (29.8% vs. 30.8%), and other metabolism disorders such as hyperlipidaemia 
(27.2% vs. 24.4%). 
Thus, background medical conditions were as expected in a population of patients with type T2DM of 
long duration. 
Primary efficacy results 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline to study endpoint in the full 
analysis set (FAS). The ANCOVA results for the change in HbA1c from baseline to endpoint for both Full 
analysis set and Per-protocol set are summarized in Table 6. 
Vildagliptin 50 mg bid as add-on to stable insulin therapy regardless of metformin therapy 
demonstrated a reduction in HbA1c at study endpoint of -0.77% from a baseline of 8.80%, and the 
difference vs. placebo of -0.72% was statistically significant (p<0.001). 
In the pivotal study CLAF237A23135, all efficacy data were censored at major change to the insulin 
background therapy. A total of 64 patients (14.3%), 27 (11.8%) in the vildagliptin group and 37 
(16.7%) in the placebo group, had a major change to their insulin background therapy. Thus, the 
proportion of patients who were censored due to major changes in the insulin background therapy was 
higher in the placebo group.  
The data of all 64 patients were censored for the analysis of the efficacy variables, including HbA1c. 
Efficacy data after the start of major changes in insulin were imputed by the last on-treatment

measurement before or at the start of major insulin therapy changes, carried forward (LOCF) through 
the final schedule study visit (Week 24 visit). 
Results from the analysis using HbA1c data not censored at major change in insulin were similar as for 
censored data; the reduction in HbA1c at study endpoint in the vildagliptin group was -0.86% and the 
difference vs. placebo of -0.67% was statistically significant (p<0.001). 
Similar results were also observed for the subsets of patients with or without concomitant metformin 
therapy. Differences between treatment with vildagliptin and placebo were slightly higher in patients 
not receiving concomitant metformin (-0.84%) than in those patients who received metformin 
(- 0.63%); differences vs. placebo were statistically significant (p<0.001) for both subsets of patients. 
Similar results for HbA1c reduction not censored at major change in insulin were shown in the insulin 
with metformin and insulin without metformin subgroups, the difference vs. placebo was -0.59% and -
0.78%, respectively, both differences were statistically significant (p<0.001). Results in the Per 
protocol set were similar to the Full analysis set results. 
Table 6 ANCOVA results for change in HbA1c (%) from baseline to study endpoint (Full Analysis Set 
and Per Protocol Set) 
Baseline is measurement obtained on Day 1, or on sample obtained on an earlier visit (scheduled or unscheduled) 
which was closest to Day 1, if Day 1 measurement is missing. Study endpoint is defined as the final available post-
randomization assessment obtained at any visit (scheduled or unscheduled), prior to the start of major changes in 
insulin background therapy, up to the final scheduled visit including week 24. n is the number of patients with 
observations at both baseline and endpoint. Adjusted means and the associated standard errors (SE), confidence 
intervals (CI), and p values were from an ANCOVA model containing terms for treatment, Hba1c at baseline, 
metformin use (not required for metformin use subgroups), insulin type and pooled centers. 
Primary analysis is based on FAS.

The primary endpoint was met for the study. The reduction of HbA1c from baseline was statistically 
significantly greater in the vildagliptin treated group. The reduction was clinically relevant. Also the 
secondary endpoints, i.e. to show superiority for vildagliptin compared to placebo in the two 
subgroups, were met. 
The subgroup of patients on background metformin therapy consisted of 267 patients of which 133 
were exposed to vildagliptin. Corresponding figures for patients no on metformin were 169 (88). 
The sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint without censoring of data supports the outcome in the 
primary analyses.  
HbA1c values in the vildagliptin treatment group were consistently lower than in the placebo group at 
all post- baseline study visits as well as at study endpoint. 
Figure 2 Mean HbA1c (%) by treatment and visit (Full analysis set) 
Unadjusted means and standard errors (vertical bars) are given. 
Study endpoint is defined as the final available post-randomization assessment obtained at any visit (scheduled or 
unscheduled), prior to the start of major changes in insulin background therapy, up to the final scheduled visit 
including week 24. 
The mean HbA1c time profiles for the subsets of patients receiving or not receiving concomitant 
metformin therapy resembled those of the overall FAS population; however, differences between the 
vildagliptin and the placebo groups were generally slightly larger in patients taking no concomitant 
metformin medication than in those patients taking metformin. 
The curves separated after four weeks of treatment with a maximum effect was observed at week 16 
where after the HbA1c reduction reached a plateau.

Additional sensitivity analyses for the HbA1c using BOCF 
In the pivotal study CLAF237A23135, the primary efficacy endpoint was the change in HbA1c from 
baseline to study endpoint (HbA1c censored at major change in insulin) in the FAS population. Data 
after discontinuations for any reason (or if final schedule visit measurement is missing for any reason) 
and data after the start of major changes in insulin were imputed by carrying the last on-treatment 
measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) forward (LOCF) through the final schedule visit (Week 24 
visit). Patients who had major changes in insulin background therapy were considered as censored 
from the start date of major changes in insulin onward (decreases in insulin dose were not considered 
major change in insulin). The HbA1c measurement taken at or before the start of major change in 
insulin reflects the lack of efficacy of the study treatment while maintaining a stable insulin dose.  
The analysis of the primary endpoint showed that adding vildagliptin 50 mg bid to stable insulin 
therapy regardless of metformin therapy resulted in a robust reduction in HbA1c at study endpoint 
(- 0.77%) and the difference vs. placebo of -0.72% was statistically significant (p<0.001). In addition, 
an analysis of all available HbA1c data regardless of major changes in insulin background therapy for 
change in HbA1c at study endpoint from baseline in FAS was performed. The results were similar to 
the censored data; the reduction in HbA1c at study endpoint in the vildagliptin group was -0.86% and 
the difference vs. placebo of -0.67% was statistically significant (p<0.001). 
An additional analysis using BOCF for patients with missing data at Week 24 and patients with major 
change in insulin background treatment was performed. The results were similar to the pre-planned 
analyses presented above confirming the efficacy of vildagliptin: The reduction in HbA1c at study 
endpoint in the vildagliptin group was -0.76%, and the difference vs. placebo of -0.62% was clinically 
relevant and statistically significant (p<0.001). 
In conclusion, vildagliptin 50 mg bid in combination with a stable insulin therapy with or without 
metformin demonstrated a clinically relevant and statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared 
to placebo, irrespective of the method used for analysis of the change in HbA1c. 
The requested analysis using BOCF, a theoretically more conservative approach, shows consistent 
results and, hence supports the primary analysis although, as might be expected, the difference 
between vildagliptin and placebo is somewhat smaller. 
Key secondary efficacy outcomes 
Treatment responders 
Responder rates based on the proportion of patients reaching predefined HbA1c levels were distinctly 
higher in the vildagliptin group than in the placebo group for all defined categories, and differences 
between treatment with vildagliptin and placebo were statistically significant for all responder 
categories (Table 7). 
Results for patients in the Per Protocol set were very similar. Similar results were observed for the 
subsets of FAS patients with and without concomitant metformin use, and differences between the 
vildagliptin and the placebo groups were statistically significant except for the two responder criteria 
“HbA1c < 7% in patients with baseline HbA1c ≤ 8%” and “HbA1c ≤ 6.5%” in patients without 
concomitant metformin use; however, the absolute number of patients in both treatment groups who 
met these two criteria appears to be low in both treatment groups.

Table 7 Number of patients who responded at study endpoint by treatment (Full Analysis Set and Full 
Analysis Set by concomitant metformin use) 
Baseline is measurement obtained on Day 1, or on sample obtained on an earlier visit (scheduled or unscheduled) 
which was closest to Day 1, if Day 1 measurement is missing. Study endpoint is defined as the final available post-
randomization assessment obtained at any visit (scheduled or unscheduled), prior to the start of major changes in 
insulin background therapy, up to the final scheduled visit including week 24.

3) Denominator includes only patients with 7% ≤ baseline HbA1c ≤ 8% and endpoint HbA1c measurement.HbA1c ≤

Thus, in the overall population, significantly higher proportions of patients reached the predefined 
targets. The overall responder rate was 22 %. Also in the subgroups with concomitant metformin or 
without metformin treatment all responder rates were in favour of vildagliptin treatment although 
numbers were small. The responder analysis appears to support the primary outcome.  
Additional sensitivity analysis for responder rates 
In the pivotal study CLAF237A23135, the responder rates analysis was carried out on data censored at 
major change to insulin therapy.

As requested by the reviewer, an additional analysis was performed where all subjects with missing 
HbA1c at Week 24 and patients who had major change in insulin background therapy were included as 
non-responders. The results of this analysis (Table 8) are consistent with the results from pre-planned 
analysis, and therefore support the efficacy of vildagliptin 50 mg bid used in combination with insulin.

The number of patients classified as responders are the same although the percentage of patients are 
slightly different due to a different analysis population (here, including all randomised patients). The 
use of a failure approach seems hence to further confirm that using LOCF (as in the pre-planned 
analyses) implied that an assessment indicating lack of efficacy was carried forward. 
Fasting plasma glucose 
At baseline, adjusted mean FPG values in the vildagliptin treatment group compared to the placebo 
group were similar (9.84 vs. 9.50 mmol/L). ANCOVA results showed that the mean FPG decreased with 
vildagliptin by -0.77 mmol/L and by -0.18 mmol/L in the placebo group; the difference between 
treatment groups was -0.59 mmol/L (p=0.05) (Table 9). 
Differences in changes in FPG between the vildagliptin and the placebo groups were larger in the 
subset of patients taking insulin without concomitant metformin (-1.07 mmol/L) than in patients taking 
insulin with concomitant metformin (-0.21 mmol/L), the differences between the vildagliptin and the 
placebo groups were not statistically significant for any subset of patients. 
Similar differences in changes in FPG between the vildagliptin and the placebo groups were observed 
for the Per protocol set; however, statistical significance was not achieved for the overall PP set and for 
any subset of patients.

Table 9 ANCOVA results for change in FPG (mmol/L) from baseline to study endpoint by treatment 
(Full analysis set) 
Baseline is measurement obtained on Day 1, or on sample obtained on an earlier visit (scheduled or unscheduled) 
which was closest to Day 1, if Day 1 measurement is missing. Study endpoint is defined as the final available post-
randomization assessment obtained at any visit (scheduled or unscheduled), prior to the start of major changes in 
insulin background therapy, up to the final scheduled visit including week 24. n is the number of patients with 
observations at both baseline and endpoint. 
Adjusted means and the associated standard errors (SE), confidence intervals (CI), and p values were from an 
ANCOVA model containing terms for treatment, FPG at baseline, metformin use (not required for metformin use 
subgroups) insulin type and pooled centers.  
* indicates statistical significance at 5% level. 
Consistent with the HbA1c results, FPG in the vildagliptin treatment group was consistently lower than 
in the placebo group at all post-baseline study visits as well as at study endpoint. However, the 
difference between treatment groups was largest in the first months of the study (i.e., Weeks 4, 8 and 
12) and decreased towards the end of the study. 
In patients taking insulin with metformin, differences in FPG between the vildagliptin and the placebo 
groups were generally smaller than in patients taking no concomitant metformin, and virtually no 
difference between treatments was observed at Week 24 and at study endpoint in both subsets of 
patients. 
Although a less prominent effect was observed on FPG there was a trend in favour of vildagliptin 
treatment in all analyses. Considering the clinically relevant effect on HbA1c, this is acceptable and 
may reflect a more prominent effect of vildagliptin during daytime compared to night-time.

Comparison of results in subpopulations 
In the pivotal study CLAF237A23135, mean changes in HbA1c were summarized for the subgroups 
HbA1c baseline category, BMI baseline category, age category, gender and race. Overall, the results 
for all subgroup categories were in line with the overall study results. 
Change in HbA1c by HbA1c baseline category 
Consistent with previous studies in the vildagliptin program, patients with a higher baseline value 
(HbA1c > 8%) showed a greater reduction in HbA1c from baseline to endpoint censored at major 
change in insulin (-1.10% and -0.31% in the vildagliptin 50 mg bid and in the placebo groups) 
compared to patients with HbA1c ≤ 8% (-0.28% and +0.15% in vildagliptin and placebo groups, 
respectively). 
Similar results were seen for baseline categories HbA1c > 9% and ≤ 9%. Change from baseline to 
endpoint censored at major change in insulin in patients with HbA1c >9% were -1.40% and -0.56% in 
the vildagliptin 50 mg bid and the placebo groups, respectively, and in patients with baseline HbA1c ≤ 
9% changes were -0.61% and +0.03%, respectively. 
Change in HbA1c by BMI category at baseline 
No consistent effect of BMI at baseline on changes in HbA1c was observed. Patients with a BMI 
<30 kg/m2 showed a mean change in HbA1c from baseline at endpoint censored at major change in 
insulin of -0.96% and -0.13% in the vildagliptin 50 mg bid and the placebo group, respectively; 
patients with a BMI ≥ 30 kg had a mean change of -0.81% and -0.30% in the vildagliptin and placebo 
groups, respectively, and for those patients with a BMI ≥ 35 kg the changes were mean -0.28% 
(median -0.3%) and mean -0.62% (median -0.4%), respectively. The low number of patients with a 
BMI ≥ 35 kg at baseline (23 and 26 patients in the vildagliptin and the placebo group) limits the 
robustness of conclusions to be drawn for this BMI category. 
Change in HbA1c by gender 
No gender-related effect on change in HbA1c was observed. The mean changes in HbA1c from baseline 
at endpoint censored at major change in insulin in male patients were -0.90% and - 0.17% in the 
vildagliptin and the placebo treatment groups, respectively, and the corresponding changes in females 
were -0.90 and -0.23%, respectively. 
Change in HbA1c by race 
Caucasian patients (the majority of all patients) showed a mean change in HbA1c from baseline at 
endpoint censored at major change in insulin of -0.71% and -0.21% in the vildagliptin 50 mg bid and 
the placebo groups, respectively; for Asian patients a slightly higher mean change of -1.02% was 
observed in the vildagliptin group compared to Caucasian patients, and a similar change as for 
Caucasian patients in the placebo group (-0.25%). For “Other” patients a change in HbA1c of -1.32% 
and +0.13% was observed. The low number of patients in this subgroup (25 and 19 patients in the 
vildagliptin and the placebo group) does not allow valid conclusions to be drawn. 
The subgroup analyses revealed (as expected) a greater reduction in HbA1c in patients with higher 
HbA1c at baseline. There was no relevant influence on HbA1c response by BMI, gender or race. 
2.2.3.  Supportive studies 
The study design and results from supportive studies, relevant to the present application have 
previously been submitted. The studies are briefly summarized below.

Study CLAF237A2311 
Study CLAF237A2311 was a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients 
with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 7.5-11%) who had been treated for at least 3 months with insulin were 
included in the trial. Eligible patients were randomized equally to vildagliptin 50 mg bid or placebo in 
addition to continuing their insulin therapy. The study included 296 patients of which 144 were 
randomised to vildagliptin and 152 to placebo. 
In study CLAF237A2311, mean diabetes duration was about 15 years, with more than 6 years of 
insulin therapy, both longer than in CLAF237A23135 (about 13 and 4.4 years, respectively). Patients 
had mean BMI 33 kg/m2 (more than 2/3 of patients were obese) and were receiving mean daily dose 
of insulin 82 U/day, which was twice as high as in pivotal study CLAF237A23135. The mean daily 
number of insulin injections was 2.8 and 45% of patients were receiving more than 3 injections per 
day, with one third requiring more than 4 injections per day. Generally, patient demographics, 
background characteristics and exposure to study drug were comparable for both the vildagliptin and 
placebo populations. Mean baseline HbA1c (8.53%) was similar to the baseline HbA1c (8.8%) in the 
pivotal Study CLAF237A23135. 
The patients on vildagliptin treatment in study CLAF237A2311 showed a 0.51% mean decrease in 
HbA1c from a baseline of 8.52%. At study endpoint a statistically significant difference in change from 
baseline in HbA1c was observed with vildagliptin 50 mg bid combination treatment as compared to 
placebo (-0.27%, p=0.022). 
The mean difference in HbA1c between the patients on vildagliptin treatment and was smaller than the 
difference in the pivotal study. Importantly, this slight improvement in glycemic control was 
accompanied by lower incidence and numbers of hypoglycemic events (incidence of events 22.9% vs. 
29.6%; number of events 113 vs. 185, vildagliptin vs. placebo, respectively). A post-hoc subgroup 
analysis in the patient subgroup ≥ 65 years revealed a distinct difference (mean -0.6%, p=0.001) in 
favour of vildagliptin. 
This study was assessed within the original MAA for vildagliptin. The addition of vildagliptin to insulin 
therapy resulted in a larger reduction in HbA1c compared to placebo (-0.27 %). At that time, the 
CHMP had concerns, whether a difference of 0.27% would be clinically meaningful.  It should be noted 
that study CLAF237A2311 included patients with longer diabetes duration and a longer history of 
insulin treatment as well as higher insulin doses than study CLAF237A23135. The HbA1c outcome was 
markedly lower in this study compared to study CLAF237A23135. It could be speculated that this is 
due to lower endogenous insulin secretion in patients with longer duration and thus a diminished effect 
of vildagliptin. It is, however, noteworthy that although the effect on HbA1c was modest, the incidence 
of hypoglycaemias was lower in the vildagliptin treated group. The data from study CLAF237A2311, 
however, lend some additional support to the efficacy of vildagliptin in combination with insulin. 
Studies CLAF237A23137 and CLAF237A23138 
Both Study CLAF237A23137 and Study CLAF237A23138 were 24-week randomized, double-blind 
studies in patients with different degrees of renal impairment. The majority of patients (68% to 82% 
across the two studies and the degree of renal impairment) in these studies were treated with insulin 
at study entry, either as monotherapy or in combination with oral antidiabetics. Efficacy was an 
exploratory objective.  
Study CLAF237A23137 included patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, and vildagliptin 
50 mg qd was compared to placebo, either added to patient’s background anti-diabetic therapy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/565928/2012  
Page 21/50 
 
 
 
 
Study CLAF237A23138 included patients with severe renal impairment and vildagliptin 50 mg qd was 
compared to sitagliptin 25mg qd, either added to patient’s background anti-diabetic therapy. 
Overall, there were no major between-treatment differences in demographic or other baseline 
characteristics in studies CLAF237A23137 and CLAF237A23138. Mean HbA1c in the two studies (7.6% 
to 7.8%) was lower than the mean HbA1c in study CLAF237A23135 (8.8%). Patients enrolled in the 
two renal studies had a long-standing T2DM, with the duration ranging from 15 to 19 years, longer 
than the duration of T2DM in study CLAF237A23135. 
In Study CLAF237A23137, 68.4% of randomized patients with moderate renal impairment were 
treated with insulin at study entry, and of the randomized patients with severe renal impairment in this 
study, 80.5% were on insulin background therapy at baseline. 
In Study CLAF237A23138, 81.8% of randomized patients were on insulin background therapy at 
baseline.  
A post-hoc analysis was performed in the subgroups of patients treated with insulin from studies 
CLAF237A23137 and CLAF237A23138. The results of this analysis showed clinically relevant reductions 
in HbA1c with vildagliptin 50 mg qd.  
In the group of patients with moderate renal impairment in Study CLAF237A23137 (N=196), mean 
HbA1c was reduced by -0.61% from a baseline of 7.98% with vildagliptin and by -0.09% from a 
baseline of 7.88% with placebo (mean absolute changes from baseline).  
In patients with severe renal impairment on insulin background therapy at baseline (N=175), mean 
HbA1c was reduced by - 0.74% from a baseline of 7.71% with vildagliptin and by -0.21% from a 
baseline of 7.75% with placebo.  
In study CLAF237A23138, in patients on insulin background therapy at baseline (N=114), comparable 
efficacy was seen with vildagliptin 50 mg qd and sitagliptin 25 mg qd. Mean HbA1c was reduced 
by -0.50% from a baseline of 7.57% with vildagliptin and by -0.58% from a baseline of 7.83% with 
sitagliptin. These results were consistent with the data obtained from the Full analysis set in these 
studies. In both studies, insulin doses did not change significantly from baseline. 
Studies CLAF237A23137 and CLAF237A23138 were assessed in the Type II variation procedure 
EMEA/H/C/771/1048/1051/WS/149 with the aim of including a posology for patients with moderate to 
severe renal impairment. A majority of patients in both studies were on a background treatment with 
insulin in monotherapy or in combination with OADs. A reduced vildagliptin dose was used due to the 
increased exposure of vildagliptin in patients with renal impairment. Also in this population, a clinically 
relevant reduction of HbA1c was observed when vildagliptin was added to insulin. 
Impact of BMI on efficacy 
In Study CLAF237A23135 the highest BMI subgroup (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m²) had the smallest mean 
reduction from baseline in HbA1c (- 0.28%), compared with the BMI categories < 30 and ≥ 30 kg/m² 
(mean change from baseline -0.96% and -0.81%, respectively). However, the low number of patients 
with a BMI ≥ 35 kg at baseline (23 and 26 patients in the vildagliptin and the placebo group) limits the 
conclusions to be drawn for this BMI category.  
It is noteworthy that in Study CLAF237A2311 the mean reduction in HbA1c from baseline was the 
same, -0.4%, irrespective of the BMI subgroup (<30, ≥ 30 or ≥ 35 kg/m²) [CSR CLAF237A2311, Table 
9-3]. Data from two dedicated add-on to insulin studies do not suggest that vildagliptin efficacy is 
influenced by BMI.

Table 10 and Table 11 provide an overview of changes in HbA1c from baseline by BMI subgroups in 
key clinical studies where vildagliptin was used as monotherapy, or as add-on therapy, focusing on the 
approved doses. In most of the studies HbA1c improvements were similar across the different BMI 
subgroups (Studies 2301, 2310, 2327, 2327E1, 2303, 2308, 2338, 2354, 2304, 2305), while in some 
studies there was a trend towards a smaller HbA1c reduction in patients with higher BMI (Studies 
2384, 2309,). Importantly, clinically relevant efficacy was maintained across all BMI categories. 
This new analysis supports the conclusion in the CHMP Assessment Report that there is no relevant 
influence on HbA1c response by BMI, i.e. vildagliptin was efficacious irrespective of the BMI category. 
Importantly, vildagliptin has not been associated with weight gain (Foley et al, 2010), which is an 
important consideration for T2DM patients with high BMI.

Although in some of the studies (2384, 2309, 2327, 2303 and 2354) there is a trend towards a lower 
effect with higher BMI, this finding is not consistent across the studies. Clinically relevant efficacy was 
maintained across all BMI categories. Overall, there appears to be no relevant influence on HbA1c 
response by BMI. 
2.2.4.  Discussion 
The scope of the current type II variation is to add a new indication for both vildagliptin and the fixed 
vildagliptin/metformin combination for use in combination with insulin (with or without metformin). 
Data from four clinical studies have been provided out of which study CLAF237A23135 is considered to 
be the pivotal study. No dose finding study was performed. The vildagliptin dose selected corresponds 
to the already approved dosing regimen which is acceptable. 
Study CLAF237A23135  
The overall study design is acceptable. Both patients with metformin treatment and without such 
treatment were included and patients were stratified by metformin use, allowing assessment of both 
combinations. 60 % of patients were to be treated with metformin. The inclusion and exclusion criteria 
were adequate and would identify a representative population on a stable background therapy. Of 
note, patients with significant CV disease were excluded. However, current experience regarding CV 
safety with vildagliptin and use in patients with CHF has been assessed both in procedures 
EMEA/H/C/771/WS/06/G and EMEA/H/771/WS/187. Although there are limitations to the available

data, there are currently no safety signals with regards to cardiac safety. The exclusion of these 
patients can be accepted since the study is not sized to detect rare events.  
The primary objective, HbA1c change from baseline, is in line with the recently adopted “Guideline on 
clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of diabetes” (CPMP/EWP/1080 Rev.1). The 
key secondary endpoint is relevant for the evaluation of the subgroups of patients treated with or 
without metformin. Statistical methods were adequate. 
The study enrolled 399 patients of which 228 were treated with vildagliptin. The subgroup of patients 
on background metformin therapy consisted of 267 patients of whom 133 were exposed to vildagliptin, 
thus the population on triple therapy is limited. Corresponding figures for patients not on metformin 
were 169 (88). However, since the combination with vildagliptin and metformin has been shown 
efficient and is already approved, the main objective is to show that the triple combination can provide 
additional benefit for the patient and thus the study size is acceptable.  
Randomisation and blinding procedures were generally adequate, although mis-stratification occurred. 
This did, however, not result in imbalances with regards to previous insulin therapy.  
Patients were to maintain stable metformin and insulin doses throughout the study. Instructions for 
allowed insulin dose adjustments (within a 10 % increase from baseline) as well as for rescue 
medication (insulin) were in place. This is of importance considering the study duration of 24 weeks 
with a placebo control in order not to jeopardise the wellbeing of the participants. 
Discontinuation rates were rather low. More patients withdrew from the placebo group with the largest 
imbalance due to loss of follow-up (7 vs 0 in the placebo and vildagliptin groups respectively). 
Treatment groups were well balanced with regards to baseline demographic and background data. An 
adequate proportion of patients were recruited in Europe. In spite of the mis-stratification, prior insulin 
treatment was balanced. Mean insulin (39.9 and 41.9 units in the vildagliptin and placebo groups 
respectively) and metformin doses were adequate (1928 mg/day and 1948 mg/day in the vildagliptin 
and placebo groups respectively), indicating that the patients included were true treatment failures. 
Background medical conditions were as expected in a population of patients with type 2 DM of long 
duration. 
The primary endpoint was met for the study. The reduction of HbA1c from baseline was statistically 
significantly greater in the vildagliptin treated group (-0.72 %, placebo corrected). The reduction was 
clinically relevant. The sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint without censoring of data supports 
the outcome in the primary analyses. An additional sensitivity analysis using BOCF, a theoretically 
more conservative approach, showed consistent results and, hence supports the primary analysis 
although, as might be expected, the difference between vildagliptin and placebo is somewhat smaller. 
Also the secondary endpoints, i.e. to show superiority for vildagliptin compared to placebo in the two 
subgroups (with or without concomitant metformin therapy), were met. In the subgroup on 
concomitant metformin treatment a placebo-adjusted HbA1c change from baseline of -0.63 % was 
observed and the corresponding result in the group not treated with metformin was -0.84 %. 
In the overall population, significantly higher proportions of patients reached the predefined targets. 
The overall responder rate was 22 %. An additional analysis was performed where all subjects with 
missing HbA1c at Week 24 and patients who had major change in insulin background therapy were 
included as non-responders. The results of this analysis are consistent with the results from pre-
planned analysis, and therefore support the efficacy of vildagliptin 50 mg bid used in combination with 
insulin. Also in the subgroups with concomitant metformin or without metformin treatment all 
responder rates were in favour of vildagliptin treatment although numbers were small. The overall 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/565928/2012  
Page 26/50 
 
 
 
 
responder rate was 21 % and 24 % in patients with concomitant metformin and without metformin, 
respectively. 
Although a less prominent effect was observed on FPG there was a trend in favour of vildagliptin 
treatment in all analyses. Considering the clinically relevant effect on HbA1c, this is acceptable and 
may reflect a more prominent effect of vildagliptin during daytime compared to night-time. 
The subgroup analyses revealed (as expected) a greater reduction in HbA1c in patients with higher 
HbA1c at baseline. There was no relevant influence on HbA1c response by BMI, gender or race. 
Considering the consistent findings both in the primary and secondary endpoints, the data provide 
sufficient support on the efficacy of vildagliptin to lower HbA1c in combination with insulin both with 
and without concomitant treatment with metformin. 
Supportive data 
Study CLAF237A2311 was assessed within the original MAA for vildagliptin. The addition of vildagliptin 
to insulin therapy resulted in a placebo corrected reduction in HbA1c of -0.27 %. Thus the HbA1c 
outcome was markedly lower in this study compared to study CLAF237A23135. At the time of the 
initial application, the CHMP had concerns, whether this difference would be clinically meaningful.  It 
should be noted that study CLAF237A2311 included patients with longer diabetes duration and a longer 
history of insulin treatment as well as higher insulin doses than study CLAF237A23135. It could be 
speculated that the lower response is due to lower endogenous insulin secretion in patients with longer 
duration and thus a diminished effect of vildagliptin. It is, however, noteworthy that although the effect 
on HbA1c was modest, the incidence of hypoglycaemias was lower in the vildagliptin treated group. 
The data from study CLAF237A2311 is therefore considered to lend some additional support to the 
efficacy of vildagliptin in combination with insulin. 
Studies CLAF237A23137 and CLAF237A23138 were assessed in the Type II variation procedure 
EMEA/H/C/771/1048/1051/WS/149 with the aim of including a posology for patients with moderate to 
severe renal impairment. A majority of patients in both studies were on a background treatment with 
insulin in monotherapy or in combination with OADs. A reduced vildagliptin dose was used due to the 
increased exposure of vildagliptin in patients with renal impairment. Also in this population, a clinically 
relevant reduction of HbA1c was observed when vildagliptin was added to insulin. 
Long-term data on the efficacy of vildagliptin 50 mg bid add-on therapy in patients with T2DM 
inadequately controlled by insulin with or without concomitant metformin treatment beyond the 24 
week treatment period in study CLAF237A23135 are not available. However, the long term efficacy of 
vildagliptin has been established in earlier clinical studies, which is considered sufficient.  
In conclusion – the efficacy of vildagliptin in providing a clinically relevant lowering of HbA1c when 
added to insulin therapy with or without concomitant metformin treatment has been adequately 
shown.  
2.3.  Clinical Safety aspects  
A list of all studies relevant for this application is given in Table 1 and Table 2. Descriptions of study 
design are given in the efficacy section of this report. 
2.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Primary safety population 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/565928/2012

The primary safety population is comprised of patients from the two studies providing key safety 
information for the indication, Study CLAF237A23135 and Study CLAF237A2311. Study 
CLAF237A23135 enrolled 449 patients (228 vildagliptin and 221 placebo), and study CLAF237A2311 
enrolled 296 patients (144 vildagliptin and 152 placebo). 
At baseline, both study populations were similar with respect to age, percentage of patients ≥65 years 
and male/female ratio. More patients from the Caucasian and Black races were enrolled in Study 
CLAF237A2311, while more than one-third of patients in CLAF237A23135 were of Indian or Chinese 
ethnicity. Consequently BMI was higher in Study CLAF237A2311 and a higher percentage of patients 
had BMI of ≥30 kg/m2 compared with patients in Study CLAF237A23135. 
Baseline disease characteristics of patients in the Primary safety population showed characteristics 
common to insulin treated patients with a long history of T2DM. Patients in Study CLAF237A2311 had a 
longer history of T2DM and use of insulin. They were treated with higher daily number of insulin 
injections (mean 2.8 vs 1.8 injections/day) and a higher daily dose of insulin (mean 82U vs 41 U/day) 
indicating the use of a more intensive insulin regimen than in Study CLAF237A23135. This difference in 
insulin treatment should be considered when evaluating the hypoglycaemic events in the two studies. 
In spite of the differences between the study populations in studies CLAF237A23135 and 
CLAF237A2311, the pooling of the safety data is endorsed. 
Safety population in the supportive studies 
Two safety studies, CLAF237A23137 and CLAF237A23138, with 525 and 148 patients respectively, 
were previously submitted to support the removal of the label restriction of vildagliptin in patients with 
moderate and severe renal impairment. The data from the safety populations in these two studies are 
included since the majority of patients (68% to 82% across studies and degree of renal impairment) 
were treated with insulin and thus represent an additional source of safety data for the use of 
vildagliptin in combination with insulin. 
The demographic and disease characteristics in Study CLAF237A23137 and Study CLAF237A23138 
were well-balanced between treatment groups at baseline. Most patients were Caucasian. 
Evaluations 
Adverse events (AEs) reported by patients in the Primary safety population and the safety population 
in the supportive studies were coded by primary system organ class (SOC) and preferred term 
according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The most recent version of 
MedDRA available at the time of study completion was used to code AEs for that particular study. Since 
each study had a different completion date, four different versions of MedDRA were used to code AEs: 
Version 8.0 (Study CLAF237A2311), 13.0 (Study CLAF237A23138), 13.1 (Study CLAF237A23137) and 
14.0 (Study CLAF237A23135). 
The number and percentage of patients with treatment-emergent AEs (events started after the first 
dose of study medication or events present prior to start of double-blind treatment but increased in 
severity), were summarized by primary SOC, preferred term, maximum severity and relationship to 
study drug. The number and percentage of patients who died, had serious adverse events (SAEs) or 
AEs leading to discontinuation were tabulated separately.

Table 12 Population groupings for safety assessment 
By pooling of data, a relatively large safety population was obtained. Safety data beyond 24 weeks is 
not available for the current combination. This is acceptable considering that the safety profile of 
vildagliptin is rather well known.  
2.3.2.  Results 
Patient exposure 
In the Primary safety population the mean duration of exposure to study medication ranged from 21 to 
23 weeks across all treatments and was close to the intended duration of 24 weeks. The majority of 
patients (>60% in all treatment groups) were exposed to study medication for ≥24 weeks.

In Study CLAF237A23137, the mean duration of exposure to study medication in patients with 
moderate or severe renal impairment in the randomized population was comparable between 
treatment groups, and was approximately 23 weeks (median 24 weeks). The majority of patients 
(>70% in both treatment groups) were exposed to study medication for 24 weeks or more. 
In Study CLAF237A23138, the mean duration of exposure to study medication in patients with severe 
renal impairment in the randomized population was 1.5 weeks longer in the sitagliptin group (22.9 
weeks) compared with the vildagliptin group (21.4 weeks), though median values were similar 
(approximately 24 weeks). The majority of patients (70% and 75% in the vildagliptin and sitagliptin 
groups, respectively) were exposed to study medication for 24 weeks or more. 
In line with the low drop-out rate, the mean exposure in all studies was close to 24 weeks. Time of 
exposure was similar between active treatment and placebo/active comparator in all trials. 
Adverse events 
Primary safety population 
In Study CLAF237A23135, AEs were reported by a higher percentage of patients in the vildagliptin 
group compared with the placebo group (57.7% vs. 47.5%, respectively). A higher percentage of 
patients in the vildagliptin group compared with the placebo group reported an AE in the primary SOC 
infections and infestations (22.5% vs. 14.5%, respectively) and gastrointestinal disorders (13.7% vs. 
7.2%, respectively) (Table 14). These imbalances were largely driven by a higher percentage of 
patients reporting upper respiratory tract infection (RTI) (7.0% vs. 3.2%, respectively) or diarrhoea 
(4.4% vs. 1.8%, respectively) in the vildagliptin group compared with the placebo group. 
In Study CLAF237A2311, similar proportion of patients reported AEs in the vildagliptin and placebo 
groups (81.3% vs. 82.9%, respectively). Vildagliptin patients had higher incidences of gastrointestinal 
disorders (25.7% for vildagliptin vs. 11.8% for placebo), while placebo patients had higher incidences 
of infections and infestations (30.6% for vildagliptin vs. 44.7% for placebo), and skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders (22.2% for vildagliptin vs. 31.6% for placebo); (Table 14). 
Taken together, vildagliptin treated patients had higher incidences of gastrointestinal disorders while 
placebo treated patients had higher incidences of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.

In study CLAF237A23135, the reporting of adverse events was higher in the vildagliptin treated group 
than in the placebo groups whereas reporting rates were similar in both groups in study 
CLAF237A2311. The overall reporting pattern did not differ between studies, with a distinctly higher 
reporting of gastrointestinal disorders in the vildagliptin treated groups compared to placebo. Generally 
the reporting rate was lower in study CLAF237A23135 which may reflect that this study included 
patients with less advanced T2DM than study CLAF237A2311.  
Supportive studies 
In Study CLAF237A23137, the overall incidence of AEs in patients with moderate renal impairment and 
in patients with severe renal impairment was similar between the vildagliptin and placebo groups 
(Moderate: 67.5% vs 72.9%; Severe: 72.6% vs 74.2%, respectively). An imbalance was seen in the 
incidence of infections and infestations in the patients with severe renal impairment which was higher 
in the vildagliptin group compared with the placebo group (30.6% vs. 19.6%, respectively), however 
this was explained by existing imbalance in the medical history. Overall, the most commonly reported 
SOCs were similar across treatment groups and were not driven by any specific AEs. 
In Study CLAF237A23138, the overall incidence of AEs was similar in the vildagliptin group compared 
to the sitagliptin group (81.9% vs. 86.2%, respectively). For the following SOCs slightly higher 
incidences were reported with sitagliptin than with vildagliptin: gastrointestinal disorders (24.1% vs. 
33.8% in the vildagliptin and the sitagliptin groups, respectively), general disorders and administrative 
site conditions (37.3% vs. 47.7%), and nervous system disorders (25.3% vs. 36.9%). Slightly higher 
incidences were reported with vildagliptin than with sitagliptin for the SOCs of metabolism and 
nutrition disorders (38.6% vs. 29.2%). 
Safety data from studies CLAF237A23137 and CLAF237A23138 were assessed in the Type II variation 
procedure EMEA/H/C/771/1048/1051/WS/149. In this procedure it was concluded that no new or 
unexpected safety concerns were identified and that the safety profile in patients with impaired renal 
function was similar to that of the overall population. 
Deaths 
A total of 3 patients died during the treatment period in the following studies: Study CLAF237A23135 
(1 patient), Study CLAF237A2311 (2 patients). One death in Study CLAF237A23135 was suspected by 
the investigator to be study drug related, however this patient was in the placebo group.  
There was no imbalance in the deaths in the two studies in patients with T2DM and moderate or severe 
renal impairment. Nine patients died in Study CLAF237A23137 (4 in the vildagliptin and 5 in the 
placebo group) and 4 patients died in Study CLAF237A23138 (2 patients in each treatment group). 
None of these deaths were suspected to be related to the study drug. 
There was no imbalance between groups with regards to death across the four studies. More deaths 
were observed in the studies including patients with renal impairment which could be explained by the 
more advanced disease in these patients. 
Serious adverse events 
Primary safety population 
In Study CLAF237A23135, SAEs were reported by 9 patients in both treatment groups (4.0% and 
4.1% for vildagliptin and placebo groups, respectively). Most SAEs were isolated events and reported 
by not more than one patient each. There were two hypoglycemia SAEs reported for each treatment 
group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/565928/2012  
Page 32/50 
 
 
 
 
In Study CLAF237A2311, SAEs were reported by similar percentages of patients in the vildagliptin 
group and placebo group (8.3% vs. 9.2%, respectively). Most SAEs were isolated events and reported 
by not more than one patient each, with the exception of hypoglycemia, which was reported by 4 
patients in the placebo group but none in the vildagliptin group. 
Overall, the incidence of SAEs was low in both studies. More hypoglycaemia SAEs were reported by 
patients in the placebo groups compared to the vildagliptin patients. Most SAEs were isolated events 
reported by not more than one patient each. Cardiovascular events (i.e. MI or stroke) were reported 
more frequently in the placebo groups than in the vildagliptin treated groups (1 vs 7 events for 
vildagliptin and placebo respectively). Infections were reported more frequently in the vildagliptin 
treated groups (7 vs 3 events). Four malignancies (prostate cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the 
skin, gastric cancer and breast cancer) were reported in the vildagliptin treated groups versus none in 
the placebo treated groups. Narratives of these events have been provided. One case of breast cancer 
was recorded in study CLAF237A23135. The patient underwent mammography which revealed a 
suspicious spot. On Day 39, she underwent a biopsy and the histology revealed mammary carcinoma. 
In study CLAF237A2311, three malignancies were reported. One case of gastric cancer was diagnosed 
on day 79 of study treatment, one case of prostate cancer was diagnosed on day 5 of study treatment 
and one case of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin was diagnosed on day 39 of study treatment. Any 
relationship with the vildagliptin treatment is unlikely due to the very short duration of exposure to 
vildagliptin.  
Supportive studies 
In Study CLAF237A23137, there were no trends in SAEs reported in patients with moderate or severe 
renal impairment. The majority of SAEs was isolated events across many different SOCs and was 
reported by ≤2 patients each. 
In Study CLAF237A23138, there were no consistent trends in SAEs reported in patients with severe 
renal impairment. The most notable differences were seen in the cardiac disorder SOC (4.8% with 
vildagliptin vs. 10.8% with sitagliptin), not driven by a specific AE, and in the respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders SOC (2.4% with vildagliptin vs. 6.2% with sitagliptin). 
Safety data from studies CLAF237A23137 and CLAF237A23138 were assessed in the Type II variation 
procedure EMEA/H/C/771/1048/1051/WS/149. In this procedure no trends with regards to SAEs were 
observed for any of the treatment groups. Considering the underlying disease no unexpected SAEs 
were observed. 
Adverse events of pre-defined risk 
A comprehensive Risk Management Plan (RMP) is in place for vildagliptin since its original approval. It 
defines the following identified and potential risks: hepatic, muscle, skin and/or vascular, 
neuropsychiatric-related events, acute pancreatitis, breast cancer, infections, hypoglycemia and 
angioedema. The RMP for the fixed dose combination of vildagliptin and metformin includes lactic 
acidosis as an additional identified risk due to the metformin component. The primary safety 
population and the Supportive studies discussed in the present application have been reviewed for 
these identified and potential risks. 
Primary safety population 
In Study CLAF237A23135, events of pre-defined risk were generally balanced between the vildagliptin 
group and in the placebo group with the exception of events in the Infections and Infestations SOC 
(22.5% vs. 14.5%, respectively). The majority of these events were mild in severity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/565928/2012  
Page 33/50 
 
 
 
 
In Study CLAF237A2311, the incidence of events of pre-defined risk in any category was lower in the 
vildagliptin group compared with the placebo group and did not indicate an increased risk with 
vildagliptin for any of these risk categories.

With regards to the identified and potential risks: hepatic, muscle, skin and/or vascular, 
neuropsychiatric-related events, acute pancreatitis and infections, no imbalances were observed when 
both studies CLAF237A23135 and CLAF237A2311 were considered. A higher reporting of infections

were observed in study CLAF237A23135, however, in study CLAF237A2311 the reporting was higher in 
the placebo group. The potential/identified risk breast cancer (one case reported for vildagliptin in 
study CLAF237A23135) and hypoglycaemia were not included in this analysis. Hypoglycaemia is 
further discussed below.   
Supportive studies 
In studies CLAF237A23137 and CLAF237A23138 no clinically meaningful differences in AEs of pre-
defined risk were found between vildagliptin and comparators in patients with moderate or severe 
renal impairment, except infections AEs, more frequently reported in vildagliptin-treated patients with 
severe renal impairment, compared to placebo-treated patients, which was explained by imbalance in 
medical history in those groups. 
Safety data from studies CLAF237A23137 and CLAF237A23138 were assessed in the Type II variation 
procedure EMEA/H/C/771/1048/1051/WS/149. In this procedure it was concluded that the data 
provided in patients with moderate renal impairment, although limited, did not evoke any concerns 
that patients with moderate renal impairment are more prone to develop AEs of special interest. In 
most cases the rates were numerically in favour of vildagliptin and no statistically significant 
differences were observed compared to placebo. Oedema-related AEs and infections were more 
common in patients with severe renal impairment which is what could be expected in this more 
severely ill population. However, apart from infections being more common in the vildagliptin group no 
statistically significant differences were observed. 
In study CLAF237A23138, no statistically significant differences were observed between treatments. 
Oedema-related AEs and infections were more commonly reported in this study compared to 
CLAF237A23137. More skin/vascular related events were reported in the vildagliptin treated group (12 
% vs 6.2 %) than in the group treated with sitagliptin. 
Adverse drug reactions 
Safety data were pooled across studies CLAF237A23135 and CLAF237A2311, re-coded to a common 
MedDRA dictionary version and analyzed according to a pre-defined algorithm used to define ADRs for 
previously approved indications. Pooling of data was performed to be able to cover a broad patient 
population treated with different insulin regimens, including also patients taking metformin as 
concomitant medication. 
An adverse event was considered as an ADR if the following two criteria are met: 
•  ≥1% greater in the vildagliptin 50mg bid plus insulin group than in placebo plus insulin group; 
•  Among adverse events which the investigator suspected to be related to study drug, a 
difference of > 0.2% where there is > 1 event difference in the vildagliptin 50mg bid plus 
insulin group than in placebo plus insulin group.

The following ADRs and frequencies were identified: 
The proposed frequency categories to these ADRs are based on the requirements outlined in the EMA 
SmPC guidance and the actual incidence of suspected drug-related AEs presented in Table 18 that 
meet the ADR definition described above.  
The overall incidence of withdrawals due to the above adverse reactions was 0.3% in the vildagliptin 
treatment group and there were no withdrawals in the placebo group. 
The incidence of hypoglycemia was similar in both treatment groups (14.0% in the vildagliptin group 
vs 16.4 % in the placebo group). Two patients reported severe hypoglycaemic events in the vildagliptin 
group, and 6 patients - in the placebo group. 
Change in body weight was also analyzed to provide the complete list of side effects expected with 
anti-diabetic treatments. At the end of the study, effect on mean body weight was neutral (+ 0.6 kg 
change from baseline in the vildagliptin group and no weight change in the placebo group). 
Considering the improvement in HbA1c (which usually would result in some weight gain) with 
vildagliptin, the MAH’s conclusion that the effect on body weight was neutral is endorsed.  
Hypoglycaemic events 
Primary safety population 
The number (%) of patients with hypoglycaemic events in the Primary safety population is summarized 
in Table 18. 
In Study A23135, the percentage of patients who experienced hypoglycaemic events was low and 
comparable in both treatment groups (8.4% and 7.2% in the vildagliptin and placebo groups, 
respectively). Two patients in each treatment group experienced severe hypoglycaemic events 
classified as either grade 2 or suspected grade 2 hypoglycemia. One patient in the vildagliptin group 
discontinued due to a severe hypoglycaemic event. 
The total number of hypoglycaemic events occurring in the vildagliptin group was higher than in the 
placebo group. Among patients reporting a hypoglycaemic event, most patients reported only one 
hypoglycaemic event during the study and most of hypoglycaemic events were assessed as mild. The 
relationship to study drug was more frequently suspected in the vildagliptin group compared with the 
placebo group (68.6% vs. 41.7% of events, respectively) while glucose levels ≤2.2 mmol/L were 
reported by a higher percentage of patients in the placebo group than in the vildagliptin group (13.9% 
vs. 7.8% of events, respectively). 
The proportion of patients experiencing hypoglycaemic events by age group was similar in the 
vildagliptin and placebo groups (8.1% vs. 7.1% of patients <65 years, and 9.0% vs. 7.5% of patients 
≥ 65 years, respectively). 
In Study A2311, the percentage of patients experiencing at least one hypoglycaemic event was lower 
in the vildagliptin group (22.9%) compared with the placebo group (29.6%). Fewer patients in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/565928/2012  
Page 37/50 
 
 
 
 
 
vildagliptin group experienced one hypoglycaemic event compared with the placebo group. The 
number of patients experiencing two, or more than two hypoglycaemic events was similar in both 
treatment groups (Table 18). 
The total number of hypoglycaemic events occurring in the placebo group (185 events) was higher 
than in the vildagliptin group (113 events). All of the hypoglycaemic events recorded in the vildagliptin 
group were categorized as Grade 1, while 6 events (4 patients) in the placebo group were categorized 
as either Grade 2 or suspected Grade 2. More events in the placebo group were considered moderate 
or severe in nature (15.9% in vildagliptin vs. 24.9% in placebo). No patient discontinued due to 
hypoglycaemic events. The number of asymptomatic low blood glucose occurrences was similar in both 
treatment groups. 
Both the percentage of patients experiencing hypoglycemia and the number of hypoglycaemic events 
were lower in Study CLAF237A23135 than in Study CLAF237A2311which could be explained with the 
use of more intensive insulin treatment regimen in study CLAF237A2311. 
Table 18 Hypoglycaemic events by event profile and treatment in the Primary safety population -
Studies A23135 and A2311 (Safety population) 
1 mmol/L glucose = 18.0 mg/dL glucose 
Hypoglycaemic events are defined as: a) symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia, where the patient is able to 
initiate self-treatment and plasma glucose measurement is <3.1 mmol/L (grade 1), b) symptoms suggestive of 
hypoglycaemia, where the patient is unable to initiate self-treatment and plasma glucose measurement is <3.1 
mmol/L (grade 2), c) symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia, where the patient is unable to initiate self-treatment 
and no plasma glucose measurement is available (suspected grade 2) 
The number of hypoglycaemic events were balanced (study CLAF237A23135) or lower in the 
vildagliptin treated groups (CLAF237A2311). There is no indication of an increase in severity of

hypoglycaemic events when vildagliptin is used in combination with insulin. In study CLAF237A23135, 
insulin doses could be reduced for safety reasons at the investigator’s discretion. This could include 
insulin dose decreases for safety reasons at anytime without specific dose limits. The need for insulin 
dose decreases was not markedly different between groups albeit slightly higher in the vildagliptin 
group (21.9 % on vildagliptin vs 19.9 % on placebo had any decrease from baseline). Considering that 
the difference in risk for hypoglycaemia was small (8.4% vs 7.2%, vildagliptin and placebo, 
respectively), no amendments of the SmPC with warnings regarding risk of hypoglycaemia when 
vildagliptin is used in combination with insulin are needed. 
The lower incidence of hypoglycaemias while still achieving a modest lowering of HbA1c in study 
CLAF237A2311, give some indication that also patients with advanced T2DM may have some benefit 
from the addition of vildagliptin to insulin considering that frequent hypoglycaemias hinders further 
increases of the insulin dose. 
Hypoglycaemic events in supportive studies 
In Study A23137, the percentage of patients with moderate renal impairment who experienced 
hypoglycaemic events was slightly higher in the vildagliptin treatment group compared with the 
placebo group (17.2% vs. 11.6%, respectively). Grade 2 or suspected grade 2 hypoglycaemic events 
were experienced by 2 patients in each treatment group. No patients discontinued treatment due to 
hypoglycaemic events. 
In Study A23137, the percentage of patients with severe renal impairment who experienced 
hypoglycaemic events was similar in the vildagliptin treatment group compared with the placebo group 
(15.3% vs. 12.4%, respectively). Grade 2 or suspected grade 2 hypoglycaemic events were 
experienced by 2 patients in each treatment group. Two patients in the vildagliptin group discontinued 
due to hypoglycaemic events. Both patients discontinuing due to hypoglycaemia were on insulin 
background therapy. 
In Study A23138, the percentage of patients with severe renal impairment who experienced 
hypoglycaemic events was similar in both treatment groups (15.7% vs. 15.4% in the vildagliptin and 
sitagliptin groups, respectively). No patients discontinued treatment because of hypoglycaemic events 
in either treatment group. Grade 2 hypoglycaemic events were reported in one patient in each 
treatment group, and an additional patient in the sitagliptin group had a suspected grade 2 
hypoglycaemia. 
Overall, the percentage of patients with renal impairment who experienced hypoglycaemic events was 
slightly higher in the vildagliptin group compared to placebo. The number of patients experiencing 
Grade 2 or suspected grade 2 (severe) hypoglycaemia was very low and similar across the vildagliptin 
and comparator groups. 
Safety data from studies CLAF237A23137 and CLAF237A23138 were assessed in the Type II variation 
procedure EMEA/H/C/771/1048/1051/WS/149. Although reporting of hypoglycaemia was slightly 
higher in the vildagliptin treated groups, the incidence of grade 2 hypoglycaemia was low.  
AEs suggestive to hypoglycaemia 
In Study CLAF237A23135, AEs suggestive of hypoglycaemia (dizziness, headache, tremor, palpitations, 
hyperhidrosis, hunger, asthenia, chills, fatigue, malaise) occurring with frequency ≥ 2% were overall 
balanced between vildagliptin 50 mg bid and placebo. Insulin doses could be reduced for safety 
reasons at the investigator’s discretion. Differences in the frequencies of any dose decrease, and for 
dose decreases of ≥ 5%, ≥10% and ≥20%, between vildagliptin and placebo were small. An additional 
analysis was performed to assess the frequencies of AEs suggestive of hypoglycaemia in subjects who 
had at least one reduction of their insulin dose from baseline by ≥ 5%. This cut-off for dose reduction 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/565928/2012  
Page 39/50 
 
 
 
 
was chosen to include also minor changes in insulin dose which may be triggered by signs and 
symptoms of hypoglycaemia without confirmatory blood glucose measurement. Similar to the reported 
incidence of hypoglycaemia AEs in vildagliptin and placebo patients, most of the AEs suggestive of 
hypoglycaemia were also balanced between the vildagliptin and the placebo groups. An imbalance was 
only seen in the PT blood glucose decreased (asymptomatic low blood glucose), documented in more 
patients in the placebo group (14.6% vs. 4.3 with vildagliptin), and tremor reported by more patients 
in the vildagliptin group (21.7% vs. 9.8%). Overall, a similar overall distribution of the AEs of 
hypoglycaemia and hypoglycaemia symptoms was observed for vildagliptin and placebo. Therefore, the 
observed reductions in insulin are likely not due to an increased risk of hypoglycaemia with vildagliptin 
in these patients. 
Although there were some imbalances (i.e. more tremor and chills reported for vildagliptin and more 
blood glucose decreased reported for placebo) the overall pattern and reporting rates are similar 
between groups. 
Body weight 
In Study CLAF237A23135 body weight at Week 24 remained unchanged in the vildagliptin group (78.0 
kg at baseline, 78.2 kg at Week 24) and slightly decreased in the placebo group (79.0 kg at baseline, 
78.3 kg at Week 24), mean difference to placebo 0.9 kg. In Study CLAF237A2311 body weight slightly 
increased in both groups and the mean difference to placebo was 0.86 kg. 
Only modest increases in body weight were observed in both studies. 
Hypoglycaemia and changes in body weight in the groups with and without metformin 
The incidence of hypoglycaemic events in the subgroup taking concomitant metformin was comparable 
in both treatment groups (7.2% with vildagliptin and 8.0% with placebo). One patient in each 
treatment group had Grade 2 hypoglycaemia, and one patient in the placebo group had suspected 
Grade 2 hypoglycaemia. A slightly higher percentage of patients in the vildagliptin group compared 
with the placebo group experienced hypoglycaemic events in the subgroup of patients without 
concomitant metformin (10.1% vs. 6.0%, respectively). One patient in the vildagliptin group 
experienced Grade 2 hypoglycaemia and no patients in the placebo group had Grade 2 hypoglycaemia. 
These small differences in the incidence of hypoglycaemia between vildagliptin-treated and placebo 
within in the subgroups with or without concomitant metformin therapy are not considered clinically 
meaningful. The slightly higher incidence of hypoglycaemia in the insulin only subgroup might be due 
to the slightly better improvement in HbA1c than in the insulin-metformin subgroup (-0.84% and -
0.63%, respectively). 
Very similar hypoglycaemia rates (vildagliptin 7.2% and placebo 8.0%) were observed in patients on 
background metformin therapy whereas a higher percentage was observed with vildagliptin (10.1 %) 
compared to placebo (6.0%) in patients without metformin. The MAH’s interpretation, that this could 
be explained by the larger effect on HbA1c by vildagliptin in the group only treated with insulin, is 
endorsed. 
An additional analysis was performed for changes in body weight (
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/565928/2012

Table 20). There was no change in weight in vildagliptin-treated patients, overall and in the subgroups 
with or without concomitant metformin. Vildagliptin was weight-neutral in both groups.

Discontinuations due to AEs 
Primary safety population 
In Study CLAF237A23135, the percentage of patients with an AE that resulted in discontinuation was 
low in both treatment groups (4.0% with vildagliptin and 2.3% with placebo). Most AEs were isolated 
events and reported in not more than one patient each. Discontinuations suspected to be related to 
study drug were one case each of: elevation of liver enzymes, hypoglycemia, diarrhea and dyspepsia in 
the vildagliptin group, and death in the placebo group.  
In Study CLAF237A2311, the percentage of patients reporting an AE leading to discontinuation was low 
but greater in the vildagliptin group compared with the placebo group (6.9% vs. 1.3%, respectively). 
Discontinuations suspected to be related to study drug were hypersensitivity (1 case of moderate 
exanthema of the forearm; no other associated symptoms) and muscle spasm (1 case) in the 
vildagliptin group, and gastritis (1 case) in the placebo group. All other discontinuations were not 
suspected to be related to study drug. 
Overall, the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation was low, and most were isolated events 
reported by not more than one patient each.  
Supportive studies 
In Study CLAF237A23137, there were no meaningful imbalances in the incidence of AEs leading to 
discontinuation in either treatment group in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. Most 
of the individual AEs leading to discontinuation were reported by no more than one patient each, with 
the exception of hypoglycemia and peripheral edema which were each reported by two patients in the 
vildagliptin group. Both patients discontinuing due to hypoglycemia were on insulin background 
therapy. 
In Study CLAF237A23138, there were no meaningful imbalances in the incidence of AEs leading to 
discontinuation in either treatment group in patients with severe renal impairment. The most notable 
difference between treatments was for the respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders SOC (0% 
with vildagliptin vs. 6.2% with sitagliptin), which was not driven by a specific AE. Most of the individual

AEs leading to discontinuation were experienced by no more than one patient, with only 
discontinuation due to chronic renal failure being reported by two patients in the vildagliptin group. 
Overall, the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation was low, and most were isolated events 
reported by not more than one patient each. Most frequent AEs leading to discontinuation were 
reported by patients in the sitagliptin and the placebo groups in the cardiac disorders or respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders SOCs. 
Studies CLAF237A23137 and CLAF237A23138 were assessed in the Type II variation procedure 
EMEA/H/C/771/1048/1051/WS/149. In patients with severe renal impairment, discontinuations due to 
AEs were slightly more common in the vildagliptin group compared to the placebo group and the rate 
was somewhat higher than in patients with moderate renal impairment. It is, however, agreed that 
there were no meaningful imbalances observed. 
2.3.3.  Discussion 
In support of the current application for the new indication: “Vildagliptin is also indicated for use in 
combination with insulin (with or without metformin) when diet and exercise plus a stable dose of 
insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control”, safety data from four clinical studies have been 
provided. Two of these studies, CLAF237A23135 and CLAF237A2311 were performed in a typical T2DM 
population, whereas studies CLAF237A23137 and CLAF237A23138 were performed in patients with 
impaired renal function. Study CLAF237A2311 was included in the original MAA for vildagliptin and 
studies CLAF237A23137 and CLAF237A23138 have been assessed within a previous type II variation 
with the aim of amending a posology for the use of vildagliptin in patients with renal impairment. 
The safety data from studies CLAF237A23135 and CLAF237A2311 were pooled in order to get a larger 
safety database with patients treated with the combination of vildagliptin and insulin. In study 
CLAF237A23135, 60 % of patients included were treated with the triple combination vildagliptin, 
insulin and metformin. Patients included in study CLAF237A2311 had a longer duration of diabetes and 
had been treated with insulin for a longer time than patients included in study CLAF237A23135. In 
spite of the differences between the study populations in studies CLAF237A23135 and CLAF237A2311, 
the pooling of the safety data is endorsed. 
By pooling of data a relatively large safety population of 744 patients, out of which 372 were treated 
with vildagliptin, was obtained. In line with the low drop-out rates, the mean exposure in all studies 
was close to 24 weeks. Time of exposure was similar between active treatment and placebo/active 
comparator in all trials. Safety data beyond 24 weeks is not available for the currently investigated 
combination. This is acceptable considering that the safety profile of vildagliptin is rather well known.  
In study CLAF237A23135, the reporting of adverse events was higher in the vildagliptin treated group 
than in the placebo groups (57.7 % vs 47.5 %) whereas reporting rates were similar in both groups in 
study CLAF237A2311 (81.3 % vs 82.9 %). The reporting rate was lower in study CLAF237A23135 
which may reflect that this study included patients with less advanced T2DM than study 
CLAF237A2311. The overall reporting pattern did not differ between studies, with a distinctly higher 
reporting of gastrointestinal disorders in the vildagliptin treated groups compared to placebo.  
There was no imbalance between groups with regards to death across the four studies. Only three 
deaths were reported in studies CLAF237A23135 and CLAF237A2311, of which two occurred in the 
placebo treated groups. More deaths were observed in the studies including patients with renal 
impairment which could be explained by the more advanced disease in these patients. 
Overall, the incidence of SAEs was low in both studies (4.0 %/4.1 % and 8.3 %/9.2 % for 
vildagliptin/placebo). More hypoglycaemia SAEs were reported by patients in the placebo groups 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/565928/2012

compared to the vildagliptin patients. Most SAEs were isolated events reported by not more than one 
patient each. Cardiovascular events (i.e. MI or stroke) were reported more frequently in the placebo 
groups than in the vildagliptin treated groups (1 vs 7 events for vildagliptin and placebo respectively). 
Infections were reported more frequently in the vildagliptin treated groups (7 vs 3 events). Four 
malignancies (prostate cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, gastric cancer and breast cancer) 
were reported in the vildagliptin treated groups versus none in the placebo treated groups. Narratives 
of these events have been provided. All cases were diagnosed after 5 to 79 days of vildagliptin 
treatment. Any relationship with the vildagliptin treatment is unlikely due to the very short duration of 
exposure to vildagliptin. Breast cancer is included as a potential risk in the RMP. 
With regards to the identified and potential risks: hepatic, muscle, skin and/or vascular, 
neuropsychiatric-related events, acute pancreatitis and infections, no imbalances were observed when 
both studies CLAF237A23135 and CLAF237A2311 were considered. A higher reporting of infections 
were observed in study CLAF237A23135, however, in study CLAF237A2311 the reporting was higher in 
the placebo group. The potential/identified risk breast cancer (one case reported for vildagliptin in 
study CLAF237A23135) and hypoglycaemia were not included in this analysis.   
The number of hypoglycaemic events were balanced (study CLAF237A23135) or lower in the 
vildagliptin treated groups (CLAF237A2311). There is no indication of an increase in severity of 
hypoglycaemic events when vildagliptin is used in combination with insulin. In study CLAF237A23135, 
insulin doses could be reduced for safety reasons at the investigator’s discretion. This could include 
insulin dose decreases for safety reasons at anytime without specific dose limits. The need for insulin 
dose decreases was not markedly different between groups albeit slightly higher in the vildagliptin 
group (21.9 % on vildagliptin vs 19.9 % on placebo had any decrease from baseline). Considering that 
the difference in risk for hypoglycaemia was small (8.4% vs 7.2%, vildagliptin and placebo, 
respectively), no amendments of the SmPC with warnings regarding risk of hypoglycaemia when 
vildagliptin is used in combination with insulin are needed. 
The lower incidence of hypoglycaemias while still achieving a modest lowering of HbA1c in study 
CLAF237A2311, give some indication that also patients with advanced T2DM may have some benefit 
from the addition of vildagliptin to insulin considering that hypoglycaemias limit the possibility of 
increasing the insulin dose.  
Only modest increases in body weight were observed in both studies. Considering the improvement in 
HbA1c (which usually results in some weight gain) with vildagliptin, the MAH’s conclusion that the 
effect on body weight was neutral is endorsed.  
Overall, the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation was low, and most were isolated events 
reported by not more than one patient each. 
Safety data from studies CLAF237A23137 and CLAF237A23138 were assessed in the Type II variation 
procedure EMEA/H/C/771/1048/1051/WS/149. In this procedure it was concluded that no new or 
unexpected safety concerns were identified and that the safety profile in patients with impaired renal 
function was similar to that of the overall population.  
The MAH also performed an analysis across studies CLAF237A23135 and CLAF237A2311 in order to 
identify adverse drug reactions, applying the same algorithm as for previously approved indications.  
The adverse reactions selected for inclusion in the SmPC section 4.8 as well as the proposed 
frequencies are endorsed.  
In conclusion, safety data have been provided in a relatively large population treated with the 
combination of vildagliptin and insulin. Limited data are also available in a population treated with the 
triple combination of vildagliptin, insulin and metformin. The data provided give no indication of a 
Assessment report

significantly different safety profile with these combinations compared to combinations already 
approved and no new safety issues have been identified.  
2.4.  Changes to the Product Information 
The  MAH  proposed  the  following  changes  to  the  Product  Information  (PI),  to  which  the  CHMP  agreed 
(new text underlined and deleted text marked as strikethrough): 
 4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Vildagliptin is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults: 
As monotherapy 
- 
in patients inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone and for whom metformin is 
inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance. 
As dual oral therapy in combination with 
- 
metformin, in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of 
monotherapy with metformin, 
a sulphonylurea, in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of 
a sulphonylurea and for whom metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance, 
a thiazolidinedione, in patients with insufficient glycaemic control and for whom the use of a 
thiazolidinedione is appropriate. 
- 
- 
Vildagliptin is also indicated for use in combination with insulin (with or without metformin) when diet 
and exercise plus a stable dose of insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
4.2 
Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Adults 
When used as monotherapy or in dual combination with metformin, with or a thiazolidinedione or with 
insulin (with or without metformin), the recommended daily dose of vildagliptin is 100 mg, 
administered as one dose of 50 mg in the morning and one dose of 50 mg in the evening. 
When used in dual combination with a sulphonylurea, the recommended dose of vildagliptin is 50 mg 
once daily administered in the morning. In this patient population, vildagliptin 100 mg daily was no 
more effective than vildagliptin 50 mg once daily.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
In controlled clinical trials using vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily in combination with insulin, with or 
without concomitant metformin, the overall incidence of withdrawals due to adverse reactions was 0.3% 
in the vildagliptin treatment group and there were no withdrawals in the placebo group. 
The incidence of hypoglycaemia was similar in both treatment groups (14.0% in the vildagliptin group vs 
16.4% in the placebo group). Two patients reported severe hypoglycaemic events in the vildagliptin 
group, and 6 patients in the placebo group. 
At the end of the study, effect on mean body weight was neutral (+0.6 kg change from baseline in the 
vildagliptin group and no weight change in the placebo group). 
[…] 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
[…] 
A 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 449 patients to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) in combination with a stable dose of 
basal or premixed insulin (mean daily dose 41 units), with concomitant use of metformin (N=276) or 
without concomitant metformin (N=173). Vildagliptin in combination with insulin significantly 
decreased HbA1c compared with placebo. In the overall population, the placebo-adjusted mean 
reduction from a mean baseline HbA1c 8.8% was -0.72%. In the subgroups treated with insulin with or 
without concomitant metformin the placebo-adjusted mean reduction in HbA1c was -0.63% 
and -0.84%, respectively. The incidence of hypoglycaemia in the overall population was 8.4% and 
7.2% in the vildagliptin and placebo groups, respectively. Patients receiving vildagliptin experienced no 
weight gain (+0.2 kg) while those receiving placebo experienced weight reduction (-0.7 kg). 
In another 24-week study in patients with more advanced type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled on 
insulin (short and longer acting, average insulin dose 80 IU/day), the mean reduction in HbA1c when 
vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) was added to insulin was statistically significantly greater than with 
placebo plus insulin (0.5% vs. 0.2%). The incidence of hypoglycaemia was lower in the vildagliptin 
group than in the placebo group (22.9% vs. 29.6%). 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Vildagliptin was approved in the EU in September 2007. Vildagliptin is currently approved as 
monotherapy (when metformin is inappropriate) and in combination with metformin, SU and 
thiazolidinedione. The fixed dose combination with metformin was approved in November 2007. 
Despite the benefits patients have from combination treatment of insulin and OAD, the use of certain 
OADs is associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia and/or weight gain.

The current type II variation is an application for a new indication: “Vildagliptin is also indicated for use 
in combination with insulin (with or without metformin) when diet and exercise plus a stable dose of 
insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control.” for Galvus/Jalra/Xiliarx (vildagliptin) and to include 
the triple combination with metformin in the indication for Eucreas/Icandra/Zomarist (vildagliptin and 
metformin).  
The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. 
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
One of the main targets in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is to control the hyperglycaemia 
while maintaining or lower body weight and without inducing too much hypoglycaemia. With the 
current variation the MAH has provided data from one pivotal study (CLAF237A23135) and three 
supportive studies (CLAF237A2311, CLAF237A23137 and CLAF237A23138) to support the concomitant 
use of vildagliptin and insulin with or without concomitant metformin. 
In the pivotal study, which enrolled 399 patients and included patients both on dual therapy with 
vildagliptin and insulin (40 %) and triple therapy (vildagliptin/insulin/metformin, 60 % of patients), a 
clinically relevant and statistically significant placebo-adjusted lowering of HbA1c (-0.72 %) was 
observed. Patients who needed rescue with additional insulin doses (> 10 % increase from baseline) 
were censored. The sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint without censoring of data supports the 
outcome in the primary analyses. Also the secondary endpoints, i.e. to show superiority for vildagliptin 
compared to placebo in the two subgroups, were met. In the subgroup on concomitant metformin 
treatment a placebo-adjusted HbA1c change from baseline of -0.63 % was observed and the 
corresponding result in the group not treated with metformin was -0.84 %. These data are further 
supported by the responder analysis where significantly higher proportions of patients reached the 
predefined targets. The responder rate was 21-24 % both in the overall population and in the two 
subsets (with or without concomitant metformin). Additional sensitive analyses were provided, which 
all supported the primary analysis. 
In study CLAF237A2311, which was assessed within the original MAA for vildagliptin, the addition of 
vildagliptin to insulin therapy resulted in a placebo corrected reduction in HbA1c of -0.27 %. Thus the 
HbA1c outcome was markedly lower in this study compared to study CLAF237A23135. At the time of 
the initial application, the CHMP had concerns, whether this difference would be clinically meaningful.  
It should be noted that study CLAF237A2311 included patients with longer diabetes duration and a 
longer history of insulin treatment as well as higher insulin doses than study CLAF237A23135. It could 
be speculated that the lower response is due to lower endogenous insulin secretion in patients with 
longer duration and thus a diminished effect of vildagliptin. It is, however, noteworthy that although 
the effect on HbA1c was modest, the incidence of hypoglycaemias was lower in the vildagliptin treated 
group than in the placebo group. Thus the data from study CLAF237A2311 indicate that also patients 
with long-standing T2DM could benefit from the addition of vildagliptin to insulin considering that 
hypoglycaemias limit the possibility of increasing the insulin dose. 
Studies CLAF237A23137 and CLAF237A23138 were assessed in the Type II variation procedure 
EMEA/H/C/771/1048/1051/WS/149 with the aim of including a posology for patients with moderate to 
severe renal impairment. A majority of patients in both studies were on a background treatment with 
insulin in monotherapy or in combination with OADs. A reduced vildagliptin dose was used due to the 
increased exposure of vildagliptin in patients with renal impairment. Also in this population, a post-hoc 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/565928/2012  
Page 47/50 
 
 
 
 
analysis showed a clinically relevant reduction of HbA1c (about -0.50 %) when vildagliptin was added 
to insulin. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Long-term data on the efficacy of vildagliptin 50 mg bid add-on therapy in patients with T2DM 
inadequately controlled by insulin with or without concomitant metformin treatment beyond 24 weeks 
are not available. However, studies with longer duration were included in the MAA for vildagliptin, 
which is considered sufficient.  
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
The safety data from studies CLAF237A23135 and CLAF237A2311 were pooled in order to get a larger 
safety database with patients treated with the combination of vildagliptin and insulin. In spite of the 
differences between the study populations in studies CLAF237A23135 and CLAF237A2311, the pooling 
of the safety data is endorsed. By pooling of data a relatively large safety population of 744 patients, 
out of which 372 were treated with vildagliptin, was obtained. Safety data beyond 24 weeks is not 
available for the currently investigated combination. This is acceptable considering that the safety 
profile of vildagliptin is rather well known.  
In study CLAF237A23135, the reporting of adverse events was higher in the vildagliptin treated group 
than in the placebo groups (57.7 % vs 47.5 %) whereas reporting rates were similar in both groups in 
study CLAF237A2311 (81.3 % vs 82.9 %). The reporting rate was lower in study CLAF237A23135 
which may reflect that this study included patients with less advanced T2DM than study 
CLAF237A2311. The overall reporting pattern did not differ between studies, with a distinctly higher 
reporting of gastrointestinal disorders in the vildagliptin treated groups compared to placebo. This is in 
line with the safety profile as previously described for vildagliptin. 
Overall, the incidence of SAEs was low in both studies (4.0 %/4.1 % and 8.3 %/9.2 % for 
vildagliptin/placebo) and there were no imbalances with regards to deaths. More hypoglycaemia SAEs 
were reported by patients in the placebo groups compared to the vildagliptin patients. Most SAEs were 
isolated events reported by not more than one patient each.  
With regards to the identified and potential risks: hepatic, muscle, skin and/or vascular, 
neuropsychiatric-related events, acute pancreatitis and infections, no imbalances were observed when 
both studies CLAF237A23135 and CLAF237A2311 were considered.  
The number of hypoglycaemic events were balanced (study CLAF237A23135) or lower in the 
vildagliptin treated groups (CLAF237A2311). There is no indication of an increase in severity of 
hypoglycaemic events when vildagliptin is used in combination with insulin. In study CLAF237A23135, 
the need for insulin dose reductions did not markedly differ between treatment groups, It is therefore 
concluded that no recommendations on insulin dose adjustments when vildagliptin is added are 
warranted. The effect on body weight was neutral.  
Safety data from studies CLAF237A23137 and CLAF237A23138 were assessed in the Type II variation 
procedure EMEA/H/C/771/1048/1051/WS/149. In this procedure it was concluded that no new or 
unexpected safety concerns were identified and that the safety profile in these more vulnerable 
patients with impaired renal function was similar to that of the overall population.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/565928/2012  
Page 48/50 
 
 
 
 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Four malignancies (prostate cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, gastric cancer and breast 
cancer) were reported in the vildagliptin treated groups versus none in the placebo treated groups in 
studies CLAF237A23135 and CLAF237A2311. However, any relationship with the vildagliptin treatment 
is unlikely due to the very short duration of exposure to vildagliptin (5-79 days) at diagnosis. Breast 
cancer is included as a potential risk in the RMP. 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Considering the consistent findings in the pivotal study, both for the primary and secondary endpoints, 
the data provide sufficient support on the efficacy of vildagliptin to lower HbA1c in combination with 
insulin both with and without concomitant treatment with metformin.  
The safety data provided does not indicate that the safety profile with this new combination differs 
from that observed in previous studies with vildagliptin. Hypoglycaemias were reported at similar 
frequencies in the vildagliptin treated and placebo groups and there was no indication of an increased 
severity of events in spite of improved glucose control. Patients with significant CV disease were 
excluded from the pivotal study; however, safety data from the supportive studies performed in 
patients with impaired renal function have not evoked any new safety concerns.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
The efficacy of vildagliptin in providing a clinically relevant lowering of HbA1c when added to insulin 
therapy with or without concomitant metformin treatment has been adequately shown. Some 
additional analyses of the data were requested to ensure the robustness of the outcome. 
Safety data have been provided in a relatively large population treated with the combination of 
vildagliptin and insulin. Somewhat limited data are also available in a population treated with the triple 
combination of vildagliptin, insulin and metformin. The data provided give no indication of a 
significantly different safety profile with these combinations compared to combinations already 
approved and no new safety issues have been identified. 
Conclusion 
The benefit risk balance for vildagliptin in combination with insulin with or without concomitant 
metformin is considered positive.

Paediatric population
Adolescents (aged 12 through 17 years)
EMEND is given for 3 days as part of a regimen that includes a 5-HT3 antagonist. The recommended
dose of capsules of EMEND is 125 mg orally on Day 1 and 80 mg orally on Days 2 and 3. EMEND is
administered orally 1 hour prior to chemotherapy on Days 1, 2 and 3. If no chemotherapy is given on
Days 2 and 3, EMEND should be administered in the morning. See the Summary of Product
Characteristics (SmPC) for the selected 5-HT3 antagonist for appropriate dosing information. If a
corticosteroid, such as dexamethasone, is co-administered with EMEND, the dose of the corticosteroid
should be administered at 50 % of the usual dose (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).
The safety and efficacy of the 80 mg and 125 mg capsules have not been demonstrated in children less
than 12 years of age. No data are available. Refer to the powder for oral suspension SmPC for
appropriate dosing in infants, toddlers and children aged 6 months to less than 12 years.
General
Efficacy data in combination with other corticosteroids and 5-HT3 antagonists are limited. For
additional information on the co-administration with corticosteroids, see section 4.5. Please refer to the
SmPC of co-administered 5-HT3 antagonist medicinal products.
Special populations
Elderly (≥ 65 years)
No dose adjustment is necessary for the elderly (see section 5.2).
Gender
No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender (see section 5.2).

Renal impairment
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment or for patients with end stage renal
disease undergoing haemodialysis (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. There are limited data in
patients with moderate hepatic impairment and no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
Aprepitant should be used with caution in these patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Method of administration
The hard capsule should be swallowed whole.
EMEND may be taken with or without food.
4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Co-administration with pimozide, terfenadine, astemizole or cisapride (see section 4.5).
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment
There are limited data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and no data in patients with
severe hepatic impairment. EMEND should be used with caution in these patients (see section 5.2).
CYP3A4 interactions
EMEND should be used with caution in patients receiving concomitant orally administered active
substances that are metabolised primarily through CYP3A4 and with a narrow therapeutic range, such
as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, alfentanil, ergot alkaloid derivatives, fentanyl, and
quinidine (see section 4.5). Additionally, concomitant administration with irinotecan should be
approached with particular caution as the combination might result in increased toxicity.
Co-administration with warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate)
In patients on chronic warfarin therapy, the International Normalised Ratio (INR) should be monitored
closely during treatment with EMEND and for 14 days following each 3-day course of EMEND (see
section 4.5).
Co-administration with hormonal contraceptives
The efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days after administration
of EMEND. Alternative non-hormonal back-up methods of contraception should be used during
treatment with EMEND and for 2 months following the last dose of EMEND (see section 4.5).
Excipients
EMEND capsules contain sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance,
glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
Sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say
essentially ‘sodium-free’.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Aprepitant (125 mg/80 mg) is a substrate, a moderate inhibitor, and an inducer of CYP3A4. Aprepitant
is also an inducer of CYP2C9. During treatment with EMEND, CYP3A4 is inhibited. After the end of
treatment, EMEND causes a transient mild induction of CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and glucuronidation.
4
 
Aprepitant does not seem to interact with the P-glycoprotein transporter, as suggested by the lack of
interaction of aprepitant with digoxin.
Effect aprepitant on the pharmacokinetics of other active substances
CYP3A4 inhibition
As a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, aprepitant (125 mg/80 mg) can increase plasma concentrations of
co-administered active substances that are metabolised through CYP3A4. The total exposure of orally
administered CYP3A4 substrates may increase up to approximately 3-fold during the 3-day treatment
with EMEND; the effect of aprepitant on the plasma concentrations of intravenously administered
CYP3A4 substrates is expected to be smaller. EMEND must not be used concurrently with pimozide,
terfenadine, astemizole, or cisapride (see section 4.3). Inhibition of CYP3A4 by aprepitant could result
in elevated plasma concentrations of these active substances, potentially causing serious or
life-threatening reactions. Caution is advised during concomitant administration of EMEND and orally
administered active substances that are metabolised primarily through CYP3A4 and with a narrow
therapeutic range, such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, alfentanil, diergotamine,
ergotamine, fentanyl, and quinidine (see section 4.4).
Corticosteroids
Dexamethasone: The usual oral dexamethasone dose should be reduced by approximately 50 % when
co-administered with EMEND 125 mg/80 mg regimen. The dose of dexamethasone in chemotherapy
induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) clinical trials was chosen to account for active substance
interactions (see section 4.2). EMEND, when given as a regimen of 125 mg with dexamethasone
co-administered orally as 20 mg on Day 1, and EMEND when given as 80 mg/day with
dexamethasone co-administered orally as 8 mg on Days 2 through 5, increased the AUC of
dexamethasone, a CYP3A4 substrate, 2.2-fold on Days 1 and 5.
Methylprednisolone: The usual intravenously administered methylprednisolone dose should be
reduced approximately 25 %, and the usual oral methylprednisolone dose should be reduced
approximately 50 % when co-administered with EMEND 125 mg/80 mg regimen. EMEND, when
given as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, increased the AUC of
methylprednisolone, a CYP3A4 substrate, by 1.3-fold on Day 1 and by 2.5-fold on Day 3, when
methylprednisolone was co-administered intravenously as 125 mg on Day 1 and orally as 40 mg on
Days 2 and 3.
During continuous treatment with methylprednisolone, the AUC of methylprednisolone may decrease
at later time points within 2 weeks following initiation of the EMEND dose, due to the inducing effect
of aprepitant on CYP3A4. This effect may be expected to be more pronounced for orally administered
methylprednisolone.
Chemotherapeutic medicinal products
In pharmacokinetic studies, EMEND, when given as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on
Days 2 and 3, did not influence the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered intravenously on
Day 1 or vinorelbine administered intravenously on Day 1 or Day 8. Because the effect of EMEND on
the pharmacokinetics of orally administered CYP3A4 substrates is greater than the effect of EMEND
on the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered CYP3A4 substrates, an interaction with orally
administered chemotherapeutic medicinal products metabolised primarily or partly by CYP3A4 (e.g.,
etoposide, vinorelbine) cannot be excluded. Caution is advised and additional monitoring may be
appropriate in patients receiving medicinal products metabolised primarily or partly by CYP3A4 (see
section 4.4). Postmarketing events of neurotoxicity, a potential adverse reaction of ifosfamide, have
been reported after aprepitant and ifosfamide co-administration.
Immunosuppressants
During the 3-day CINV regimen, a transient moderate increase followed by a mild decrease in
exposure of immunosuppressants metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, everolimus
and sirolimus) is expected. Given the short duration of the 3-day regimen and the time-dependent
limited changes in exposure, dose reduction of the immunosuppressant is not recommended during the
3 days of co-administration with EMEND.
5
Midazolam
The potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of midazolam or other benzodiazepines
metabolised via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, triazolam) should be considered when co-administering these
medicinal products with EMEND (125 mg/80 mg).
EMEND increased the AUC of midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, 2.3-fold on Day 1 and
3.3-fold on Day 5, when a single oral dose of 2 mg midazolam was co-administered on Days 1 and 5
of a regimen of EMEND 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 to 5.
In another study with intravenous administration of midazolam, EMEND was given as 125 mg on
Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, and 2 mg midazolam was given intravenously prior to the
administration of the 3-day regimen of EMEND and on Days 4, 8, and 15. EMEND increased the
AUC of midazolam 25 % on Day 4 and decreased the AUC of midazolam 19 % on Day 8 and 4 % on
Day 15. These effects were not considered clinically important. 
In a third study with intravenous and oral administration of midazolam, EMEND was given as 125 mg
on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, together with ondansetron 32 mg Day 1, dexamethasone
12 mg Day 1 and 8 mg Days 2-4. This combination (i.e. EMEND, ondansetron and dexamethasone)
decreased the AUC of oral midazolam 16 % on Day 6, 9 % on Day 8, 7 % on Day 15 and 17 % on
Day 22. These effects were not considered clinically important.
An additional study was completed with intravenous administration of midazolam and EMEND.
Intravenous 2 mg midazolam was given 1 hour after oral administration of a single dose of EMEND
125 mg. The plasma AUC of midazolam was increased by 1.5-fold. This effect was not considered
clinically important.
Induction
As a mild inducer of CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and glucuronidation, aprepitant can decrease plasma
concentrations of substrates eliminated by these routes within two weeks following initiation and
treatment. This effect may become apparent only after the end of a 3-day treatment with EMEND. For
CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 substrates, the induction is transient with a maximum effect reached 3-5 days
after end of the EMEND 3-day treatment. The effect is maintained for a few days, thereafter slowly
declines and is clinically insignificant by two weeks after end of EMEND treatment. Mild induction of
glucuronidation is also seen with 80 mg oral aprepitant given for 7 days. Data are lacking regarding
effects on CYP2C8 and CYP2C19. Caution is advised when warfarin, acenocoumarol, tolbutamide,
phenytoin or other active substances that are known to be metabolised by CYP2C9 are administered
during this time period.
Warfarin
In patients on chronic warfarin therapy, the prothrombin time (INR) should be monitored closely
during treatment with EMEND and for 2 weeks following each 3-day course of EMEND for
chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (see section 4.4). When a single 125 mg dose of EMEND
was administered on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3 to healthy subjects who were stabilised on
chronic warfarin therapy, there was no effect of EMEND on the plasma AUC of R(+) or S(-) warfarin
determined on Day 3; however, there was a 34 % decrease in S(-) warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate)
trough concentration accompanied by a 14 % decrease in INR 5 days after completion of treatment
with EMEND. 
Tolbutamide
EMEND, when given as 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, decreased the AUC of
tolbutamide (a CYP2C9 substrate) by 23 % on Day 4, 28 % on Day 8, and 15 % on Day 15, when a
single dose of tolbutamide 500 mg was administered orally prior to the administration of the 3-day
regimen of EMEND and on Days 4, 8, and 15.
6
Hormonal contraceptives
The efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days after administration
of EMEND. Alternative non-hormonal back-up methods of contraception should be used during
treatment with EMEND and for 2 months following the last dose of EMEND.
In a clinical study, single doses of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone
were administered on Days 1 through 21 with EMEND, given as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 8 and
80 mg/day on Days 9 and 10 with ondansetron 32 mg intravenously on Day 8 and oral dexamethasone
given as 12 mg on Day 8 and 8 mg/day on Days 9, 10, and 11. During days 9 through 21 in this study,
there was as much as a 64 % decrease in ethinyl estradiol trough concentrations and as much as a 60 %
decrease in norethindrone trough concentrations. 
5-HT3 antagonists
In clinical interaction studies, aprepitant did not have clinically important effects on the
pharmacokinetics of ondansetron, granisetron, or hydrodolasetron (the active metabolite of
dolasetron).
Effect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant
Concomitant administration of EMEND with active substances that inhibit CYP3A4 activity (e.g.,
ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone,
and protease inhibitors) should be approached cautiously, as the combination is expected to result
several-fold in increased plasma concentrations of aprepitant (see section 4.4). 
Concomitant administration of EMEND with active substances that strongly induce CYP3A4 activity
(e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) should be avoided as the combination
results in reductions of the plasma concentrations of aprepitant that may result in decreased efficacy of
EMEND. Concomitant administration of EMEND with herbal preparations containing St. John’s Wort
(Hypericum perforatum) is not recommended.
Ketoconazole
When a single 125 mg dose of aprepitant was administered on Day 5 of a 10-day regimen of
400 mg/day of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the AUC of aprepitant increased
approximately 5-fold and the mean terminal half-life of aprepitant increased approximately 3-fold.
Rifampicin
When a single 375 mg dose of aprepitant was administered on Day 9 of a 14-day regimen of
600 mg/day of rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, the AUC of aprepitant decreased 91 % and the
mean terminal half-life decreased 68 %.
Paediatric population
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Contraception in males and females
The efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days after administration
of EMEND. Alternative non-hormonal back-up methods of contraception should be used during
treatment with EMEND and for 2 months following the last dose of EMEND (see sections 4.4 and
4.5).
Pregnancy
For aprepitant no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. The potential for reproductive
toxicity of aprepitant has not been fully characterised, since exposure levels above the therapeutic
exposure in humans at the 125 mg/80 mg dose could not be attained in animal studies. These studies
did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal
development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). The potential effects on
7
reproduction of alterations in neurokinin regulation are unknown. EMEND should not be used during
pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
Breast-feeding
Aprepitant is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether aprepitant is excreted in
human milk; therefore, breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with EMEND.
Fertility
The potential for effects of aprepitant on fertility has not been fully characterised because exposure
levels above the therapeutic exposure in humans could not be attained in animal studies. These fertility
studies did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to mating performance, fertility,
embryonic/foetal development, or sperm count and motility (see section 5.3).
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
EMEND may have minor influence on the ability to drive, cycle and use machines. Dizziness and
fatigue may occur following administration of EMEND (see section 4.8).
4.8  Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The safety profile of aprepitant was evaluated in approximately 6,500 adults in more than 50 studies
and 184 children and adolescents in 2 pivotal paediatric clinical trials.
The most common adverse reactions reported at a greater incidence in adults treated with the
aprepitant regimen than with standard therapy in patients receiving Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy
(HEC) were: hiccups (4.6 % versus 2.9 %), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (2.8 % versus
1.1 %), dyspepsia (2.6 % versus 2.0 %), constipation (2.4 % versus 2.0 %), headache (2.0 % versus
1.8 %), and decreased appetite (2.0 % versus 0.5 %). The most common adverse reaction reported at a
greater incidence in patients treated with the aprepitant regimen than with standard therapy in patients
receiving Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy (MEC) was fatigue (1.4 % versus 0.9 %).
The most common adverse reactions reported at a greater incidence in paediatric patients treated with
the aprepitant regimen than with the control regimen while receiving emetogenic cancer chemotherapy
were hiccups (3.3 % versus 0.0 %) and flushing (1.1 % versus 0.0 %).
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The following adverse reactions were observed in a pooled analysis of the HEC and MEC studies at a
greater incidence with aprepitant than with standard therapy in adults or paediatric patients or in post-
marketing use. The frequency categories given in the table are based on the studies in adults; the
observed frequencies in the paediatric studies were similar or lower, unless shown in the table. Some
less common ADRs in the adult population were not observed in the paediatric studies.
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon
(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot

†Nausea and vomiting were efficacy parameters in the first 5 days of post-chemotherapy treatment and were
reported as adverse reactions only thereafter.
Description of selected adverse reactions
The adverse reactions profiles in adults in the Multiple-Cycle extension of HEC and MEC studies for
up to 6 additional cycles of chemotherapy were generally similar to those observed in Cycle 1.
In an additional active-controlled clinical study in 1,169 adult patients receiving aprepitant and HEC,
the adverse reactions profile was generally similar to that seen in the other HEC studies with
aprepitant.
Non-CINV studies
Additional adverse reactions were observed in adult patients treated with a single 40 mg dose of
aprepitant for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) with a greater incidence than with
ondansetron: abdominal pain upper, bowel sounds abnormal, constipation*, dysarthria, dyspnoea,
hypoaesthesia, insomnia, miosis, nausea, sensory disturbance, stomach discomfort, sub-ileus*, visual
acuity reduced, wheezing.
*Reported in patients taking a higher dose of aprepitant.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V.
4.9  Overdose
In the event of overdose, EMEND should be discontinued and general supportive treatment and
monitoring should be provided. Because of the antiemetic activity of aprepitant, emesis induced by a
medicinal product may not be effective.
Aprepitant cannot be removed by haemodialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antiemetics and antinauseants, ATC code: A04AD12
10
Aprepitant is a selective high-affinity antagonist at human substance P neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors.
3-day regimen of aprepitant in adults
In 2 randomised, double-blind studies encompassing a total of 1,094 adult patients receiving
chemotherapy that included cisplatin  70 mg/m2, aprepitant in combination with an
ondansetron/dexamethasone regimen (see section 4.2) was compared with a standard regimen (placebo
plus ondansetron 32 mg intravenously administered on Day 1 plus dexamethasone 20 mg orally on
Day 1 and 8 mg orally twice daily on Days 2 to 4). Although a 32 mg intravenous dose of ondansetron
was used in clinical trials, this is no longer the recommended dose. See the product information for the
selected 5-HT3 antagonist for appropriate dosing information.
Efficacy was based on evaluation of the following composite measure: complete response (defined as
no emetic episodes and no use of rescue therapy) primarily during Cycle 1. The results were evaluated
for each individual study and for the 2 studies combined.
A summary of the key study results from the combined analysis is shown in Table 1.

Time (hours) 
Statistically significant differences in efficacy were also observed in each of the 2 individual studies.
In the same 2 clinical studies, 851 adult patients continued into the Multiple-Cycle extension for up to
5 additional cycles of chemotherapy. The efficacy of the aprepitant regimen was apparently
maintained during all cycles.
In a randomised, double-blind study in a total of 866 adult patients (864 females, 2 males) receiving
chemotherapy that included cyclophosphamide 750-1,500 mg/m2; or cyclophosphamide
500-1,500 mg/m2 and doxorubicin (≤ 60 mg/m2) or epirubicin (≤ 100 mg/m2), aprepitant in
combination with an ondansetron/dexamethasone regimen (see section 4.2) was compared with
standard therapy (placebo plus ondansetron 8 mg orally (twice on Day 1, and every 12 hours on
Days 2 and 3) plus dexamethasone 20 mg orally on Day 1).
Efficacy was based on evaluation of the composite measure: complete response (defined as no emetic
episodes and no use of rescue therapy) primarily during Cycle 1.

In the same clinical study, 744 adult patients continued into the Multiple-Cycle extension for up to
3 additional cycles of chemotherapy. The efficacy of the aprepitant regimen was apparently
maintained during all cycles.
In a second multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, clinical study, the aprepitant
regimen was compared with standard therapy in 848 adult patients (652 females, 196 males) receiving
a chemotherapy regimen that included any intravenous dose of oxaliplatin, carboplatin, epirubicin,
idarubicin, ifosfamide, irinotecan, daunorubicin, doxorubicin; cyclophosphamide intravenously
(< 1,500 mg/m2); or cytarabine intravenously (> 1 g/m2). Patients receiving the aprepitant regimen
were receiving chemotherapy for a variety of tumour types including 52 % with breast cancer, 21 %
with gastrointestinal cancers including colorectal cancer, 13 % with lung cancer and 6 % with
gynaecological cancers. The aprepitant regimen in combination with an ondansetron/dexamethasone
regimen (see section 4.2) was compared with standard therapy (placebo in combination with
ondansetron 8 mg orally (twice on Day 1, and every 12 hours on Days 2 and 3) plus dexamethasone
20 mg orally on Day 1).
Efficacy was based on the evaluation of the following primary and key secondary endpoints: No
vomiting in the overall period (0 to 120 hours post-chemotherapy), evaluation of safety and
tolerability of the aprepitant regimen for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), and
complete response (defined as no vomiting and no use of rescue therapy) in the overall period (0 to
120 hours post-chemotherapy). Additionally, no significant nausea in the overall period (0 to
120 hours post-chemotherapy) was evaluated as an exploratory endpoint, and in the acute and delayed
phases as a post-hoc analysis.
A summary of the key study results is shown in Table 3.

* The confidence intervals were calculated with no adjustment for gender and region, which were included in the
primary analysis using logistic models.
The benefit of aprepitant combination therapy in the full study population was mainly driven by the
results observed in patients with poor control with the standard regimen such as in women, even
though the results were numerically better regardless of age, tumour type or gender. Complete
response to the aprepitant regimen and standard therapy, respectively, was reached in 209/324 (65 %)
and 161/320 (50 %) in women and 83/101 (82 %) and 68/87 (78 %) of men.
Paediatric population
In a randomised, double-blind, active comparator-controlled clinical study that included 302 children
and adolescents (aged 6 months to 17 years) receiving moderately or highly emetogenic
chemotherapy, the aprepitant regimen was compared to a control regimen for the prevention of CINV.
The efficacy of the aprepitant regimen was evaluated in a single cycle (Cycle 1). Patients had the
opportunity to receive open-label aprepitant in subsequent cycles (Optional Cycles 2-6); however
efficacy was not assessed in these optional cycles. The aprepitant regimen for adolescents aged
12 through 17 years (n=47) consisted of EMEND capsules 125 mg orally on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on
Days 2 and 3 in combination with ondansetron on Day 1. The aprepitant regimen for children aged
6 months to less than 12 years (n=105) consisted of EMEND powder for oral suspension 3.0 mg/kg
(up to 125 mg) orally on Day 1 and 2.0 mg/kg (up to 80 mg) orally on Days 2 and 3 in combination
with ondansetron on Day 1. The control regimen in adolescents aged 12 through 17 years (n=48) and
children aged 6 months to less than 12 years (n=102) consisted of placebo for aprepitant on Days 1, 2
and 3 in combination with ondansetron on Day 1. EMEND or placebo and ondansetron were
administered 1 hour and 30 minutes prior to initiation of chemotherapy, respectively. Intravenous
dexamethasone was permitted as part of the antiemetic regimen for paediatric patients in both age
groups, at the discretion of the physician. A dose reduction (50 %) of dexamethasone was required for
paediatric patients receiving aprepitant. No dose reduction was required for paediatric patients
receiving the control regimen. Of the paediatric patients, 29 % in the aprepitant regimen and 28 % in
the control regimen used dexamethasone as part of the regimen in Cycle 1.
The antiemetic activity of EMEND was evaluated over a 5-day (120 hour) period following the
initiation of chemotherapy on Day 1. The primary endpoint was complete response in the delayed
phase (25 to 120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy) in Cycle 1. A summary of the key study
results are shown in Table 4.

An analysis of efficacy in subpopulations in Cycle 1 demonstrated that, regardless of age category,
gender, use of dexamethasone for antiemetic prophylaxis, and emetogenicity of chemotherapy, the
aprepitant regimen provided better control than the control regimen with respect to the complete
response endpoints.
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties
Aprepitant displays non-linear pharmacokinetics. Both clearance and absolute bioavailability decrease
with increasing dose.
15
 
Absorption
The mean absolute oral bioavailability of aprepitant is 67 % for the 80 mg capsule and 59 % for the
125 mg capsule. The mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of aprepitant occurred at approximately
4 hours (tmax). Oral administration of the capsule with an approximately 800 Kcal standard breakfast
resulted in an up to 40 % increase in AUC of aprepitant. This increase is not considered clinically
relevant.
The pharmacokinetics of aprepitant is non-linear across the clinical dose range. In healthy young
adults, the increase in AUC0- was 26 % greater than dose proportional between 80 mg and 125 mg
single doses administered in the fed state.
Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of EMEND on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on
Days 2 and 3, the AUC0-24hr (mean±SD) was 19.6 ± 2.5 µg•h/mL and 21.2 ± 6.3 µg•h/mL on
Days 1 and 3, respectively. Cmax was 1.6 ± 0.36 µg/mL and 1.4 ± 0.22 µg/mL on Days 1 and 3,
respectively.
Distribution
Aprepitant is highly protein bound, with a mean of 97 %. The geometric mean apparent volume of
distribution at steady state (Vdss) is approximately 66 L in humans.
Biotransformation
Aprepitant undergoes extensive metabolism. In healthy young adults, aprepitant accounts for
approximately 19 % of the radioactivity in plasma over 72 hours following a single intravenous
administration 100-mg dose of [14C]-fosaprepitant, a prodrug for aprepitant, indicating a substantial
presence of metabolites in the plasma. Twelve metabolites of aprepitant have been identified in human
plasma. The metabolism of aprepitant occurs largely via oxidation at the morpholine ring and its side
chains and the resultant metabolites were only weakly active. In vitro studies using human liver
microsomes indicate that aprepitant is metabolised primarily by CYP3A4 and potentially with minor
contribution by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19.
Elimination
Aprepitant is not excreted unchanged in urine. Metabolites are excreted in urine and via biliary
excretion in faeces. Following a single intravenously administered 100 mg dose of [14C]-fosaprepitant,
a prodrug for aprepitant, to healthy subjects, 57 % of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and
45 % in faeces.
The plasma clearance of aprepitant is dose-dependent, decreasing with increased dose and ranged from
approximately 60 to 72 mL/min in the therapeutic dose range. The terminal half-life ranged from
approximately 9 to 13 hours.
Pharmacokinetics in special populations
Elderly: Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of aprepitant on Day 1 and 80 mg once
daily on Days 2 through 5, the AUC0-24hr of aprepitant was 21 % higher on Day 1 and 36 % higher on
Day 5 in elderly ( 65 years) relative to younger adults. The Cmax was 10 % higher on Day 1 and 24 %
higher on Day 5 in elderly relative to younger adults. These differences are not considered clinically
meaningful. No dose adjustment for EMEND is necessary in elderly patients.
Gender: Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of aprepitant, the Cmax for aprepitant is
16 % higher in females as compared with males. The half-life of aprepitant is 25 % lower in females
as compared with males and its tmax occurs at approximately the same time. These differences are not
considered clinically meaningful. No dose adjustment for EMEND is necessary based on gender.
Hepatic impairment: Mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) does not affect the
pharmacokinetics of aprepitant to a clinically relevant extent. No dose adjustment is necessary for
patients with mild hepatic impairment. Conclusions regarding the influence of moderate hepatic
impairment (Child-Pugh class B) on aprepitant pharmacokinetics cannot be drawn from available data.
16
There are no clinical or pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh
class C).
Renal impairment: A single 240 mg dose of aprepitant was administered to patients with severe renal
impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) and to patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring
haemodialysis.
In patients with severe renal impairment, the AUC0- of total aprepitant (unbound and protein bound)
decreased by 21 % and Cmax decreased by 32 %, relative to healthy subjects. In patients with ESRD
undergoing haemodialysis, the AUC0- of total aprepitant decreased by 42 % and Cmax decreased by
32 %. Due to modest decreases in protein binding of aprepitant in patients with renal disease, the AUC
of pharmacologically active unbound aprepitant was not significantly affected in patients with renal
impairment compared with healthy subjects. Haemodialysis conducted 4 or 48 hours after dosing had
no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant; less than 0.2 % of the dose was recovered
in the dialysate.
No dose adjustment for EMEND is necessary for patients with renal impairment or for patients with
ESRD undergoing haemodialysis.
Paediatric population: As part of a 3-day regimen, dosing of aprepitant capsules (125/80/80-mg) in
adolescent patients (aged 12 through 17 years) achieved an AUC0-24hr above 17 µg•hr/mL on Day 1
with concentrations (Cmin) at the end of Days 2 and 3 above 0.4 µg/mL in a majority of patients. The
median peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was approximately 1.3 µg/mL on Day 1, occurring at
approximately 4 hours. As part of a 3-day regimen, dosing of aprepitant powder for oral suspension
(3/2/2-mg/kg) in patients aged 6 months to less than 12 years achieved an AUC0-24hr above
17 µg•hr/mL on Day 1 with concentrations (Cmin) at the end of Days 2 and 3 above 0.1 µg/mL in a
majority of patients. The median peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was approximately 1.2 µg/mL on
Day 1, occurring between 5 and 7 hours.
A population pharmacokinetic analysis of aprepitant in paediatric patients (aged 6 months through
17 years) suggests that gender and race have no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics
of aprepitant.
Relationship between concentration and effect
Using a highly specific NK1-receptor tracer, positron emission tomography (PET) studies in healthy
young men have shown that aprepitant penetrates into the brain and occupies NK1 receptors in a dose-
and plasma-concentration-dependent manner. Aprepitant plasma concentrations achieved with the
3-day regimen of EMEND in adults are predicted to provide greater than 95 % occupancy of brain
NK1 receptors.
5.3  Preclinical safety data
Pre-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and
repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction and development.
However, it should be noted that systemic exposure in rodents was similar or even lower than
therapeutic exposure in humans at the 125 mg/80 mg dose. In particular, although no adverse effects
were noted in reproduction studies at human exposure levels, the animal exposures are not sufficient to
make an adequate risk assessment in man.
In a juvenile toxicity study in rats treated from postnatal day 10 to day 63 aprepitant led to an earlier
vaginal opening in females from 250 mg/kg b.i.d. and to a delayed preputial separation in males, from
10 mg/kg b.i.d. There were no margins to clinically relevant exposure. There were no
treatment-related effects on mating, fertility or embryonic/foetal survival, and no pathological changes
in the reproductive organs. In a juvenile toxicity study in dogs treated from postnatal day 14 to day 42,
a decreased testicular weight and Leydig cell size were seen in the males at 6 mg/kg/day and increased
uterine weight, hypertrophy of the uterus and cervix, and oedema of vaginal tissues were seen in
females from 4 mg/kg/day. There were no margins to clinically relevant exposure of aprepitant. For
17
short term treatment according to recommended dose regimen these findings are considered unlikely
to be clinically relevant.

SmPC of co-administered 5-HT3 antagonist medicinal products.
Special populations
Gender
No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender (see section 5.2).
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment or for patients with end stage renal
disease undergoing haemodialysis (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. There are limited data in
patients with moderate hepatic impairment and no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
Aprepitant should be used with caution in these patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Method of administration
The oral suspension may be taken with or without food.
For details on preparation and administration of the suspension, see section 6.6.
4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Co-administration with pimozide, terfenadine, astemizole or cisapride (see section 4.5).
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment
There are limited data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and no data in patients with
severe hepatic impairment. EMEND should be used with caution in these patients (see section 5.2).
CYP3A4 interactions
EMEND should be used with caution in patients receiving concomitant orally administered active
substances that are metabolised primarily through CYP3A4 and with a narrow therapeutic range, such
as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, alfentanil, ergot alkaloid derivatives, fentanyl, and
quinidine (see section 4.5). Additionally, concomitant administration with irinotecan should be
approached with particular caution as the combination might result in increased toxicity.
Co-administration with warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate)
In patients on chronic warfarin therapy, the International Normalised Ratio (INR) should be monitored
closely during treatment with EMEND and for 14 days following each 3-day course of EMEND (see
section 4.5).
Co-administration with hormonal contraceptives
The efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days after administration
of EMEND. Alternative non-hormonal back-up methods of contraception should be used during
treatment with EMEND and for 2 months following the last dose of EMEND (see section 4.5).
21
Excipients
EMEND powder for oral suspension contains sucrose and lactose. Patients with rare hereditary
problems of fructose or galactose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption, total lactase
deficiency, or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
Sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet, that is to say essentially
‘sodium-free’.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Aprepitant (125 mg/80 mg) is a substrate, a moderate inhibitor, and an inducer of CYP3A4. Aprepitant
is also an inducer of CYP2C9. During treatment with EMEND, CYP3A4 is inhibited. After the end of
treatment, EMEND causes a transient mild induction of CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and glucuronidation.
Aprepitant does not seem to interact with the P-glycoprotein transporter, as suggested by the lack of
interaction of aprepitant with digoxin.
Effect of aprepitant on the pharmacokinetics of other active substances
CYP3A4 inhibition
As a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, aprepitant (125 mg/80 mg) can increase plasma concentrations of
co-administered active substances that are metabolised through CYP3A4. The total exposure of orally
administered CYP3A4 substrates may increase up to approximately 3-fold during the 3-day treatment
with EMEND; the effect of aprepitant on the plasma concentrations of intravenously administered
CYP3A4 substrates is expected to be smaller. EMEND must not be used concurrently with pimozide,
terfenadine, astemizole, or cisapride (see section 4.3). Inhibition of CYP3A4 by aprepitant could result
in elevated plasma concentrations of these active substances, potentially causing serious or
life-threatening reactions. Caution is advised during concomitant administration of EMEND and orally
administered active substances that are metabolised primarily through CYP3A4 and with a narrow
therapeutic range, such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, alfentanil, diergotamine,
ergotamine, fentanyl, and quinidine (see section 4.4).
Corticosteroids
Dexamethasone: The usual oral dexamethasone dose should be reduced by approximately 50 % when
co-administered with EMEND 125 mg/80 mg regimen. The dose of dexamethasone in chemotherapy
induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) clinical trials was chosen to account for active substance
interactions (see section 4.2). EMEND, when given as a regimen of 125 mg with dexamethasone
co-administered orally as 20 mg on Day 1, and EMEND when given as 80 mg/day with
dexamethasone co-administered orally as 8 mg on Days 2 through 5, increased the AUC of
dexamethasone, a CYP3A4 substrate, 2.2-fold on Days 1 and 5.
Methylprednisolone: The usual intravenously administered methylprednisolone dose should be
reduced approximately 25 %, and the usual oral methylprednisolone dose should be reduced
approximately 50 % when co-administered with EMEND 125 mg/80 mg regimen. EMEND, when
given as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, increased the AUC of
methylprednisolone, a CYP3A4 substrate, by 1.3-fold on Day 1 and by 2.5-fold on Day 3, when
methylprednisolone was co-administered intravenously as 125 mg on Day 1 and orally as 40 mg on
Days 2 and 3.
During continuous treatment with methylprednisolone, the AUC of methylprednisolone may decrease
at later time points within 2 weeks following initiation of the EMEND dose, due to the inducing effect
of aprepitant on CYP3A4. This effect may be expected to be more pronounced for orally administered
methylprednisolone.
Chemotherapeutic medicinal products
In pharmacokinetic studies, EMEND, when given as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on
Days 2 and 3, did not influence the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel administered intravenously on
22
Day 1 or vinorelbine administered intravenously on Day 1 or Day 8. Because the effect of EMEND on
the pharmacokinetics of orally administered CYP3A4 substrates is greater than the effect of EMEND
on the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered CYP3A4 substrates, an interaction with orally
administered chemotherapeutic medicinal products metabolised primarily or partly by CYP3A4 (e.g.,
etoposide, vinorelbine) cannot be excluded. Caution is advised and additional monitoring may be
appropriate in patients receiving medicinal products metabolised primarily or partly by CYP3A4 (see
section 4.4). Postmarketing events of neurotoxicity, a potential adverse reaction of ifosfamide, have
been reported after aprepitant and ifosfamide co-administration.
Immunosuppressants
During the 3-day CINV regimen, a transient moderate increase followed by a mild decrease in
exposure of immunosuppressants metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, everolimus
and sirolimus) is expected. Given the short duration of the 3-day regimen and the time-dependent
limited changes in exposure, dose reduction of the immunosuppressant is not recommended during the
3 days of co-administration with EMEND.
Midazolam
The potential effects of increased plasma concentrations of midazolam or other benzodiazepines
metabolised via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, triazolam) should be considered when co-administering these
medicinal products with EMEND (125 mg/80 mg).
EMEND increased the AUC of midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, 2.3-fold on Day 1 and
3.3-fold on Day 5, when a single oral dose of 2 mg midazolam was co-administered on Days 1 and 5
of a regimen of EMEND 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 to 5.
In another study with intravenous administration of midazolam, EMEND was given as 125 mg on
Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, and 2 mg midazolam was given intravenously prior to the
administration of the 3-day regimen of EMEND and on Days 4, 8, and 15. EMEND increased the
AUC of midazolam 25 % on Day 4 and decreased the AUC of midazolam 19 % on Day 8 and 4 % on
Day 15. These effects were not considered clinically important. 
In a third study with intravenous and oral administration of midazolam, EMEND was given as 125 mg
on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, together with ondansetron 32 mg Day 1, dexamethasone
12 mg Day 1 and 8 mg Days 2-4. This combination (i.e. EMEND, ondansetron and dexamethasone)
decreased the AUC of oral midazolam 16 % on Day 6, 9 % on Day 8, 7 % on Day 15 and 17 % on
Day 22. These effects were not considered clinically important.
An additional study was completed with intravenous administration of midazolam and EMEND.
Intravenous 2 mg midazolam was given 1 hour after oral administration of a single dose of EMEND
125 mg. The plasma AUC of midazolam was increased by 1.5-fold. This effect was not considered
clinically important.
Induction
As a mild inducer of CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and glucuronidation, aprepitant can decrease plasma
concentrations of substrates eliminated by these routes within two weeks following initiation and
treatment. This effect may become apparent only after the end of a 3-day treatment with EMEND. For
CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 substrates, the induction is transient with a maximum effect reached 3-5 days
after end of the EMEND 3-day treatment. The effect is maintained for a few days, thereafter slowly
declines and is clinically insignificant by two weeks after end of EMEND treatment. Mild induction of
glucuronidation is also seen with 80 mg oral aprepitant given for 7 days. Data are lacking regarding
effects on CYP2C8 and CYP2C19. Caution is advised when warfarin, acenocoumarol, tolbutamide,
phenytoin or other active substances that are known to be metabolised by CYP2C9 are administered
during this time period.
Warfarin
In patients on chronic warfarin therapy, the prothrombin time (INR) should be monitored closely
during treatment with EMEND and for 2 weeks following each 3-day course of EMEND for
23
chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (see section 4.4). When a single 125 mg dose of EMEND
was administered on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3 to healthy subjects who were stabilised on
chronic warfarin therapy, there was no effect of EMEND on the plasma AUC of R(+) or S(-) warfarin
determined on Day 3; however, there was a 34 % decrease in S(-) warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate)
trough concentration accompanied by a 14 % decrease in INR 5 days after completion of treatment
with EMEND. 
Tolbutamide
EMEND, when given as 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on Days 2 and 3, decreased the AUC of
tolbutamide (a CYP2C9 substrate) by 23 % on Day 4, 28 % on Day 8, and 15 % on Day 15, when a
single dose of tolbutamide 500 mg was administered orally prior to the administration of the 3-day
regimen of EMEND and on Days 4, 8, and 15.
Hormonal contraceptives
The efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days after administration
of EMEND. Alternative non-hormonal back-up methods of contraception should be used during
treatment with EMEND and for 2 months following the last dose of EMEND. 
In a clinical study, single doses of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone
were administered on Days 1 through 21 with EMEND, given as a regimen of 125 mg on Day 8 and
80 mg/day on Days 9 and 10 with ondansetron 32 mg intravenously on Day 8 and oral dexamethasone
given as 12 mg on Day 8 and 8 mg/day on Days 9, 10, and 11. During days 9 through 21 in this study,
there was as much as a 64 % decrease in ethinyl estradiol trough concentrations and as much as a 60 %
decrease in norethindrone trough concentrations. 
5-HT3 antagonists
In clinical interaction studies, aprepitant did not have clinically important effects on the
pharmacokinetics of ondansetron, granisetron, or hydrodolasetron (the active metabolite of
dolasetron).
Effect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant
Concomitant administration of EMEND with active substances that inhibit CYP3A4 activity (e.g.,
ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone,
and protease inhibitors) should be approached cautiously, as the combination is expected to result
several-fold in increased plasma concentrations of aprepitant (see section 4.4). 
Concomitant administration of EMEND with active substances that strongly induce CYP3A4 activity
(e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) should be avoided as the combination
results in reductions of the plasma concentrations of aprepitant that may result in decreased efficacy of
EMEND. Concomitant administration of EMEND with herbal preparations containing St. John’s Wort
(Hypericum perforatum) is not recommended.
Ketoconazole
When a single 125 mg dose of aprepitant was administered on Day 5 of a 10-day regimen of
400 mg/day of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the AUC of aprepitant increased
approximately 5-fold and the mean terminal half-life of aprepitant increased approximately 3-fold.
Rifampicin
When a single 375 mg dose of aprepitant was administered on Day 9 of a 14-day regimen of
600 mg/day of rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, the AUC of aprepitant decreased 91 % and the
mean terminal half-life decreased 68 %. 
Paediatric population
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
24
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Contraception in males and females
The efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced during and for 28 days after administration
of EMEND. Alternative non-hormonal back-up methods of contraception should be used during
treatment with EMEND and for 2 months following the last dose of EMEND (see sections 4.4 and
4.5).
Pregnancy
For aprepitant no clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. The potential for reproductive
toxicity of aprepitant has not been fully characterised, since exposure levels above the therapeutic
exposure in humans at the 125 mg/80 mg dose could not be attained in animal studies. These studies
did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal
development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3). The potential effects on
reproduction of alterations in neurokinin regulation are unknown. EMEND should not be used during
pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
Breast-feeding
Aprepitant is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether aprepitant is excreted in
human milk; therefore, breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with EMEND.
Fertility
The potential for effects of aprepitant on fertility has not been fully characterised because exposure
levels above the therapeutic exposure in humans could not be attained in animal studies. These fertility
studies did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to mating performance, fertility,
embryonic/foetal development, or sperm count and motility (see section 5.3).
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
EMEND may have minor influence on the ability to ride a bicycle and use machines. Dizziness and
fatigue may occur following administration of EMEND (see section 4.8).
4.8  Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The safety profile of aprepitant was evaluated in approximately 6,500 adults in more than 50 studies
and 184 children and adolescents in 2 pivotal paediatric clinical trials.
The most common adverse reactions reported at a greater incidence in adults treated with the aprepitant
regimen than with standard therapy in patients receiving Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy (HEC)
were: hiccups (4.6 % versus 2.9 %), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (2.8 % versus 1.1 %),
dyspepsia (2.6 % versus 2.0 %), constipation (2.4 % versus 2.0 %), headache (2.0 % versus 1.8 %), and
decreased appetite (2.0 % versus 0.5 %). The most common adverse reaction reported at a greater
incidence in patients treated with the aprepitant regimen than with standard therapy in adults receiving
Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy (MEC) was fatigue (1.4 % versus 0.9 %).
The most common adverse reactions reported at a greater incidence in paediatric patients treated with
the aprepitant regimen than with the control regimen while receiving emetogenic cancer chemotherapy
were hiccups (3.3 % versus 0.0 %) and flushing (1.1 % versus 0.0 %).
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The following adverse reactions were observed in a pooled analysis of the HEC and MEC studies at a
greater incidence with aprepitant than with standard therapy or in post-marketing use. The frequency
categories given in the table are based on the studies in adults; the observed frequencies in the
paediatric studies were similar or lower, unless shown in the table. Some less common ADRs in the
adult population were not observed in the paediatric studies.

†Nausea and vomiting were efficacy parameters in the first 5 days of post-chemotherapy treatment and were
reported as adverse reactions only thereafter.
Description of selected adverse reactions
The adverse reactions profiles in adults in the Multiple-Cycle extension of HEC and MEC studies for
up to 6 additional cycles of chemotherapy were generally similar to those observed in Cycle 1.
In an additional active-controlled clinical study in 1,169 patients receiving aprepitant and HEC, the
adverse reactions profile was generally similar to that seen in the other HEC studies with aprepitant.
Non-CINV studies
Additional adverse reactions were observed in adult patients treated with a single 40 mg dose of
aprepitant for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) with a greater incidence than with
ondansetron: abdominal pain upper, bowel sounds abnormal, constipation*, dysarthria, dyspnoea,
hypoaesthesia, insomnia, miosis, nausea, sensory disturbance, stomach discomfort, sub-ileus*, visual
acuity reduced, wheezing.
*Reported in patients taking a higher dose of aprepitant.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V.
4.9  Overdose
In the event of overdose, EMEND should be discontinued and general supportive treatment and
monitoring should be provided. Because of the antiemetic activity of aprepitant, emesis induced by a
medicinal product may not be effective.
Aprepitant cannot be removed by haemodialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antiemetics and antinauseants, ATC code: A04AD12
Aprepitant is a selective high-affinity antagonist at human substance P neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors.
3-day regimen of aprepitant in adults
In 2 randomised, double-blind studies encompassing a total of 1,094 adult patients receiving
chemotherapy that included cisplatin  70 mg/m2, aprepitant in combination with an
ondansetron/dexamethasone regimen (see section 4.2) was compared with a standard regimen (placebo
plus ondansetron 32 mg intravenously administered on Day 1 plus dexamethasone 20 mg orally on
Day 1 and 8 mg orally twice daily on Days 2 to 4). Although a 32 mg intravenous dose of ondansetron
was used in clinical trials, this is no longer the recommended dose. See the product information for the
selected 5-HT3 antagonist for appropriate dosing information.
Efficacy was based on evaluation of the following composite measure: complete response (defined as
no emetic episodes and no use of rescue therapy) primarily during Cycle 1. The results were evaluated
for each individual study and for the 2 studies combined.
A summary of the key study results from the combined analysis is shown in Table 1.

Statistically significant differences in efficacy were also observed in each of the 2 individual studies.
In the same 2 clinical studies, 851 adult patients continued into the Multiple-Cycle extension for up to
5 additional cycles of chemotherapy. The efficacy of the aprepitant regimen was apparently
maintained during all cycles.
In a randomised, double-blind study in a total of 866 adult patients (864 females, 2 males) receiving
chemotherapy that included cyclophosphamide 750-1,500 mg/m2; or cyclophosphamide
500-1,500 mg/m2 and doxorubicin (≤ 60 mg/m2) or epirubicin (≤ 100 mg/m2), aprepitant in
combination with an ondansetron/dexamethasone regimen (see section 4.2) was compared with
standard therapy (placebo plus ondansetron 8 mg orally (twice on Day 1, and every 12 hours on
Days 2 and 3) plus dexamethasone 20 mg orally on Day 1).
Efficacy was based on evaluation of the composite measure: complete response (defined as no emetic

In the same clinical study, 744 adult patients continued into the Multiple-Cycle extension for up to
3 additional cycles of chemotherapy. The efficacy of the aprepitant regimen was apparently
maintained during all cycles.
In a second multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, clinical study, the aprepitant
regimen was compared with standard therapy in 848 adult patients (652 females, 196 males) receiving
a chemotherapy regimen that included any intravenous dose of oxaliplatin, carboplatin, epirubicin,
idarubicin, ifosfamide, irinotecan, daunorubicin, doxorubicin; cyclophosphamide intravenously
(< 1,500 mg/m2); or cytarabine intravenously (> 1 g/m2). Patients receiving the aprepitant regimen
were receiving chemotherapy for a variety of tumour types including 52 % with breast cancer, 21 %
with gastrointestinal cancers including colorectal cancer, 13 % with lung cancer and 6 % with
gynaecological cancers. The aprepitant regimen in combination with an ondansetron/dexamethasone
regimen (see section 4.2) was compared with standard therapy (placebo in combination with
ondansetron 8 mg orally (twice on Day 1, and every 12 hours on Days 2 and 3) plus dexamethasone
20 mg orally on Day 1).
Efficacy was based on the evaluation of the following primary and key secondary endpoints: No
vomiting in the overall period (0 to 120 hours post-chemotherapy), evaluation of safety and
tolerability of the aprepitant regimen for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), and
complete response (defined as no vomiting and no use of rescue therapy) in the overall period (0 to
120 hours post-chemotherapy). Additionally, no significant nausea in the overall period (0 to
120 hours post-chemotherapy) was evaluated as an exploratory endpoint, and in the acute and delayed
phases as a post-hoc analysis.
A summary of the key study results is shown in Table 3.

* The confidence intervals were calculated with no adjustment for gender and region, which were included in the
primary analysis using logistic models.
The benefit of aprepitant combination therapy in the full study population was mainly driven by the
results observed in patients with poor control with the standard regimen such as in women, even
though the results were numerically better regardless of age, tumour type or gender. Complete
response to the aprepitant regimen and standard therapy, respectively, was reached in 209/324 (65 %)
and 161/320 (50 %) in women and 83/101 (82 %) and 68/87 (78 %) of men.
Paediatric population
In a randomised, double-blind, active comparator-controlled clinical study that included 302 children
and adolescents (aged 6 months to 17 years) receiving moderately or highly emetogenic
chemotherapy, the aprepitant regimen was compared to a control regimen for the prevention of CINV.
The efficacy of the aprepitant regimen was evaluated in a single cycle (Cycle 1). Patients had the
opportunity to receive open-label aprepitant in subsequent cycles (Optional Cycles 2-6); however
efficacy was not assessed in these optional cycles. The aprepitant regimen for adolescents aged 12
through 17 years (n=47) consisted of EMEND capsules 125 mg orally on Day 1 and 80 mg/day on
Days 2 and 3 in combination with ondansetron on Day 1. The aprepitant regimen for children aged
6 months to less than 12 years (n=105) consisted of EMEND powder for oral suspension 3.0 mg/kg
(up to 125 mg) orally on Day 1 and 2.0 mg/kg (up to 80 mg) orally on Days 2 and 3 in combination
with ondansetron on Day 1. The control regimen in adolescents aged 12 through 17 years (n=48) and
children aged 6 months to less than 12 years (n=102) consisted of placebo for aprepitant on Days 1, 2
and 3 in combination with ondansetron on Day 1. EMEND or placebo and ondansetron were
administered 1 hour and 30 minutes prior to initiation of chemotherapy, respectively. Intravenous
dexamethasone was permitted as part of the antiemetic regimen for paediatric patients in both age
groups, at the discretion of the physician. A dose reduction (50 %) of dexamethasone was required for
paediatric patients receiving aprepitant. No dose reduction was required for paediatric patients
receiving the control regimen. Of the paediatric patients, 29 % in the aprepitant regimen and 28 % in
the control regimen used dexamethasone as part of the regimen in Cycle 1.
The antiemetic activity of EMEND was evaluated over a 5-day (120 hour) period following the
initiation of chemotherapy on Day 1. The primary endpoint was complete response in the delayed
phase (25 to 120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy) in Cycle 1. A summary of the key study
results are shown in Table 4.

The estimated time to first vomiting after initiation of chemotherapy treatment was longer with the
aprepitant regimen (estimated median time to first vomiting was 94.5 hours) compared with the
control regimen group (estimated median time to first vomiting was 26.0 hours) as depicted in the
Kaplan-Meier curves in Figure 2.

An analysis of efficacy in subpopulations in Cycle 1 demonstrated that, regardless of age category,
gender, use of dexamethasone for antiemetic prophylaxis, and emetogenicity of chemotherapy, the
aprepitant regimen provided better control than the control regimen with respect to the complete
response endpoints.
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties
Aprepitant displays non-linear pharmacokinetics. Both clearance and absolute bioavailability decrease
with increasing dose.
32
 
Absorption
The mean absolute oral bioavailability of aprepitant is 67 % for the 80 mg capsule and 59 % for the
125 mg capsule. The mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of aprepitant occurred at approximately
4 hours (tmax). Oral administration of the capsule with an approximately 800 Kcal standard breakfast
resulted in an up to 40 % increase in AUC of aprepitant. This increase is not considered clinically
relevant.
The pharmacokinetics of aprepitant is non-linear across the clinical dose range. In healthy young
adults, the increase in AUC0- was 26 % greater than dose proportional between 80 mg and 125 mg
single doses administered in the fed state.
Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of EMEND on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on
Days 2 and 3, the AUC0-24hr (mean±SD) was 19.6 ± 2.5 µg•h/mL and 21.2 ± 6.3 µg•h/mL on
Days 1 and 3, respectively. Cmax was 1.6 ± 0.36 µg/mL and 1.4 ± 0.22 µg/mL on Days 1 and 3,
respectively.
Distribution
Aprepitant is highly protein bound, with a mean of 97 %. The geometric mean apparent volume of
distribution at steady state (Vdss) is approximately 66 L in humans.
Biotransformation
Aprepitant undergoes extensive metabolism. In healthy young adults, aprepitant accounts for
approximately 19 % of the radioactivity in plasma over 72 hours following a single intravenous
administration 100 mg dose of [14C]-fosaprepitant, a prodrug for aprepitant, indicating a substantial
presence of metabolites in the plasma. Twelve metabolites of aprepitant have been identified in human
plasma. The metabolism of aprepitant occurs largely via oxidation at the morpholine ring and its side
chains and the resultant metabolites were only weakly active. In vitro studies using human liver
microsomes indicate that aprepitant is metabolised primarily by CYP3A4 and potentially with minor
contribution by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19.
Elimination
Aprepitant is not excreted unchanged in urine. Metabolites are excreted in urine and via biliary
excretion in faeces. Following a single intravenously administered 100 mg dose of [14C]-fosaprepitant,
a prodrug for aprepitant, to healthy subjects, 57 % of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and
45 % in faeces.
The plasma clearance of aprepitant is dose-dependent, decreasing with increased dose and ranged from
approximately 60 to 72 mL/min in the therapeutic dose range. The terminal half-life ranged from
approximately 9 to 13 hours.
Pharmacokinetics in special populations
Gender: Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of aprepitant, the Cmax for aprepitant is
16 % higher in females as compared with males. The half-life of aprepitant is 25 % lower in females
as compared with males and its tmax occurs at approximately the same time. These differences are not
considered clinically meaningful. No dose adjustment for EMEND is necessary based on gender.
Hepatic impairment: Mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) does not affect the
pharmacokinetics of aprepitant to a clinically relevant extent. No dose adjustment is necessary for
patients with mild hepatic impairment. Conclusions regarding the influence of moderate hepatic
impairment (Child-Pugh class B) on aprepitant pharmacokinetics cannot be drawn from available data.
There are no clinical or pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh
class C).
Renal impairment: A single 240 mg dose of aprepitant was administered to patients with severe renal
impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) and to patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring
haemodialysis.
33
In patients with severe renal impairment, the AUC0- of total aprepitant (unbound and protein bound)
decreased by 21 % and Cmax decreased by 32 %, relative to healthy subjects. In patients with ESRD
undergoing haemodialysis, the AUC0- of total aprepitant decreased by 42 % and Cmax decreased by
32 %. Due to modest decreases in protein binding of aprepitant in patients with renal disease, the AUC
of pharmacologically active unbound aprepitant was not significantly affected in patients with renal
impairment compared with healthy subjects. Haemodialysis conducted 4 or 48 hours after dosing had
no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant; less than 0.2 % of the dose was recovered
in the dialysate.
No dose adjustment for EMEND is necessary for patients with renal impairment or for patients with
ESRD undergoing haemodialysis.
Paediatric population: As part of a 3-day regimen, dosing of aprepitant capsules (125/80/80-mg) in
adolescent patients (aged 12 through 17 years) achieved an AUC0-24hr above 17 µg•hr/mL on Day 1
with concentrations (Cmin) at the end of Days 2 and 3 above 0.4 µg/mL in a majority of patients. The
median peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was approximately 1.3 µg/mL on Day 1, occurring at
approximately 4 hours. As part of a 3-day regimen, dosing of aprepitant powder for oral suspension
(3/2/2-mg/kg) in patients aged 6 months to less than 12 years achieved an AUC0-24hr above
17 µg•hr/mL on Day 1 with concentrations (Cmin) at the end of Days 2 and 3 above 0.1 µg/mL in a
majority of patients. The median peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was approximately 1.2 µg/mL on
Day 1, occurring between 5 and 7 hours.
A population pharmacokinetic analysis of aprepitant in paediatric patients (aged 6 months through
17 years) suggests that gender and race have no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics
of aprepitant.
Relationship between concentration and effect
Using a highly specific NK1-receptor tracer, positron emission tomography (PET) studies in healthy
young men have shown that aprepitant penetrates into the brain and occupies NK1 receptors in a dose-
and plasma-concentration-dependent manner. Aprepitant plasma concentrations achieved with the
3-day regimen of EMEND in adults are predicted to provide greater than 95 % occupancy of brain
NK1 receptors.
5.3  Preclinical safety data
Pre-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and
repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction and development.
However, it should be noted that systemic exposure in rodents was similar or even lower than
therapeutic exposure in humans at the 125 mg/80 mg dose. In particular, although no adverse effects
were noted in reproduction studies at human exposure levels, the animal exposures are not sufficient to
make an adequate risk assessment in man.
In a juvenile toxicity study in rats treated from postnatal day 10 to day 63 aprepitant led to an earlier
vaginal opening in females from 250 mg/kg b.i.d. and to a delayed preputial separation in males, from
10 mg/kg b.i.d. There were no margins to clinically relevant exposure. There were no
treatment-related effects on mating, fertility or embryonic/foetal survival, and no pathological changes
in the reproductive organs. In a juvenile toxicity study in dogs treated from postnatal day 14 to day 42,
a decreased testicular weight and Leydig cell size were seen in the males at 6 mg/kg/day and increased
uterine weight, hypertrophy of the uterus and cervix, and oedema of vaginal tissues were seen in
females from 4 mg/kg/day. There were no margins to clinically relevant exposure of aprepitant. For
short term treatment according to recommended dose regimen these findings are considered unlikely
to be clinically relevant.

Contents of the pack and other information
1.  What EMEND is and what it is used for
EMEND contains the active substance aprepitant and belongs to a group of medicines called
"neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonists". The brain has a specific area that controls nausea and
vomiting. EMEND works by blocking signals to that area, thereby reducing nausea and vomiting.
EMEND capsules are used in adults and adolescents from the age of 12 years in combination with
other medicines to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy (cancer treatment) that are
strong and moderate triggers of nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin, cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin or epirubicin).

Warnings and precautions
Talk to the doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before you take EMEND or give this medicine to the child.

80 mg and 125 mg capsules have not been studied in this population.

Instructions for healthcare professionals on the preparation of the oral suspension 
Each pack of EMEND contains a sachet with the
powder for oral suspension, a 1 mL and a 5 mL oral
dispenser, one cap and one mixing cup.
1.  Fill the mixing cup with room temperature
drinking water.
2.  Fill the 5 mL oral dispenser with 4.6 mL of water
from the mixing cup.
Make sure no air is in the oral dispenser (if air
is present, remove). 
3.  Discard all the unused water remaining in the
mixing cup.
4.  Add the 4.6 mL of water from the oral dispenser
back into the mixing cup.
5.  Each sachet of EMEND for oral suspension
contains 125 mg of aprepitant which is to be
suspended in 4.6 mL of water giving a final
concentration of 25 mg/mL. 
Hold the EMEND powder for oral suspension
sachet upright and shake the contents to the bottom
before opening the sachet.
6.  Pour the entire contents of the sachet into the 4.6 
mL of water in the mixing cup and snap the lid
shut.
7.  Mix the EMEND suspension gently by swirling 20
times; then gently invert the mixing cup 5 times.
To prevent foaming, do not shake the mixing cup.
The mixture will be cloudy pink to light pink.

8.  Check the EMEND mixture for any clumps or
foaming:
-  If any clumps are present, repeat Step 7 until
there are no clumps.
-  If there is any foam, wait for the foam to
disappear before going on to Step 9.
9.  Fill the oral dispenser with the prescribed dose
from the mixing cup according to the table below.
-  Choose the oral dispenser based on dose:
-  Use 1 mL oral dispenser if dose is
1 mL or less. 
-  Use 5 mL oral dispenser if dose is
more than 1 mL.
-  It is common to have medicine leftover in the
cup.
Make sure no air is in the oral dispenser (if air is

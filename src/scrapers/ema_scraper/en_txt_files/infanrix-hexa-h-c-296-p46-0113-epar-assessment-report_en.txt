1.  Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
A phase IV, non-randomised, open-label, multicentre study with two parallel groups to 
assess the immunogenicity and safety of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals’ combined 
DTPa-HBVIPV/Hib vaccine administered as a three-dose primary vaccination course at 2, 4 
and 6 months of age in healthy infants in Canada. 
Combination vaccines are appealing due to the need for fewer injections; however, 
combinations can result in antigenic ‘interference’ resulting in a lower immune response 
than achieved by monovalent vaccines and has been noted with Hib combination products, although 
with unimpaired ability to induce immune memory. 
Immune response to vaccines can vary among populations; parameters such as early 
exposure to pathogen or to cross-reacting pathogens and genetic differences can influence 
response to vaccines . Trials comparing vaccine efficacy in various ethnic populations have not been 
conducted in Canada. Studies examining vaccine efficacy and effectiveness in population subgroups are 
important to informing disease control programs. 
Infanrix hexa (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib) has extensive immunogenicity and safety data available from non 
Canadian jurisdictions. Results from previous trials have demonstrated that when administered at 2, 4 
and 6 months of age, Infanrix hexa is considered equally efficacious as Pentacel + HBV 
vaccines in eliciting immune response to the vaccine antigens. Earlier Infanrix hexa studies did not 
include children of Canadian or Aboriginal origin. 
Due to the high rates of Hib disease in Canada, previous data showing antigenic interference with Hib, 
and the use of this vaccine to provide more easily hep B immunisation, this study focused on 
evaluating the immune response of the Infanrix hexa vaccine with respect to antibody concentrations 
to the Hib and hepatitis B antigens. This phase IV trial assessed vaccine safety and 
immunogenicity in a ‘real world’ setting, including vaccine administration by community-
based providers and co-administration of the other routine vaccinations recommended in 
the provinces where the study was undertaken.

2.  Assessment of the post-authorisation measure: Study No.: 
103506 (DTPa-HBV-IPV-118 PRI) 
The study groups were as follows: 
• 
• 
“Aboriginal infants”: infants of the Canadian First Nations, Metis and Inuit people. 
“Other Non-Aboriginal infants”: infants exclusive of Aboriginals. This group is referred to as 
“Non-Aboriginal infants” henceforth. 
All subjects were to receive three doses of GSK Biologicals’ combined DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine 
administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. All subjects were offered two doses of GSK Biologicals’ 
human rotavirus vaccine (HRV) at 2 and 4 months of age and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, 
meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine and influenza vaccine according to the recommended 
provincial infant immunisation schedules.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary objective was to assess the immune response to the Hib component of GSK Biologicals’ 
combined DTPa-HBVIPV/Hib preservative-free vaccine in terms of seroprotection rates one month after 
the three-dose primary vaccination course in “Aboriginal infants” and “Non-Aboriginal infant”. 
The secondary objectives were 1) to assess the immune response to the Hib component of the 
combined DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine in terms of anti-polyribosyl-ribitol phosphate (PRP) geometric 
mean concentrations 
(GMCs) one month after the three-dose primary vaccination course ; 2) to assess the immune 
response to the hepatitis B component of the combined DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine in terms of 
seroprotection rates and anti-HBs GMCs one month after the three-dose primary vaccination course ; 
3) to assess the safety of the combined DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine in terms of medically attended 
adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs) during the three-dose primary vaccination course. 
MAH’s overall conclusion  
•  One month after the primary vaccination with Infanrix hexa, anti-PRP seroprotection 
levels were seen in 97.9% of subjects in the Aboriginal Infants group and in 99.1% 
of subjects in the Non-Aboriginal Infants group. 
•  Anti-PRP GMCs were 6.123μg/ml (95% CI: 4.498-8.334) in the Aboriginal Infants 
group and 3.510μg/ml (95% CI: 2.745-4.488) in the Non-Aboriginal Infants group. 
•  One month after the primary vaccination with Infanrix hexa, seroprotective anti-HBs 
antibody concentration ≥10 mIU/mL was observed in 100% of subjects in Aboriginal 
Infants and Non-Aboriginal Infants and antibody concentration ≥100 mIU/mL was 
observed in 97.4% and 97.3% of subjects in Aboriginal Infants and Non-Aboriginal 
Infants groups, respectively. 
The anti-HBs GMCs were 1797.9 mIU/mL (95% CI: 1375.1- 2350.7) and 1544.4 
mIU/mL (95% CI: 1210.4-1970.5) for Aboriginal Infants and Non-Aboriginal 
Infants groups, respectively. 
• 
•  No confirmatory analyses were performed on the primary and secondary objectives. 
•  At least one unsolicited symptom that required medical attention during the 31-day 
follow-up period after vaccination was reported for 23.2% and 17.0% of subjects in 
Aboriginal Infants and Non-Aboriginal Infants groups, respectively. 
•  SAEs were reported for six subjects in the Aboriginal Infants group during the entire 
study period. One SAE (pyrexia) was assessed by the investigator as causally related 
to the study vaccine. All the SAEs were recovered/resolved by the end of the study. 
No fatal SAEs were reported. 
• 
In this study, the study vaccine was generally well tolerated. 
The MAH’s overall conclusion is endorsed.  
3.  CHMP overall conclusion 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the immunogenicity and safety data of this study are in line with the 
approved PI in the EU.  This Article 46 is fulfilled and no further action required. Therefore no changes 
to the PI are considered necessary. Based on the review of this Phase IV study, the CHMP considers 
that the benefit-risk balance for Infanrix-hexa remains unchanged. 
  PAM fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled) - No further action required 
  PAM not fulfilled (not all commitments fulfilled) and further action required:

SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION

Introduction 
Human Papillomaviruses and Disease Background 
It is widely accepted that infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is the central causal factor for 
the development of cervical cancer. Recent studies have shown that HPV can be identified in 98.7% of 
all cervical carcinomas.  Furthermore HPV infections are among the most common sexually 
transmitted infections in most populations and estimates of exposure range from 25% in many 
European countries to 70% in the US or 95% in high risk populations in Africa.  
HPV are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that infect the epithelial cells of the skin or 
mucosa. Based on their genomic differences within the oncogenes E6 and E7 and the capsid protein 
L1 over 100 genotypes are described to date. Thereof approximately 40 different genotypes lead to 
infections of the anogenital tract and about 16 are highly oncogenic with HPV types 16 and 18, being 
the most frequent found in cervical cancer. HPV-16 is detected in about 54% of cervical cancer cases, 
and the second type is HPV-18, detected in about 17% of cases. 
The time from occurrence of HPV infection to cancer development usually exceeds 20 years. 
However, persistent HPV infection is a necessary but not a sufficient factor for the development of 
cervical carcinoma. Other factors such as smoking, long-term use of oral contraceptives or high parity 
are suggested to play a role in the process that lead to cancer. 
The majority of genital HPV infections (>90%) however are transient sub-clinical infections that will 
be cleared or suppressed below the limits of detection by host cell defences within one to two years. In 
addition, any cervical lesion may spontaneously regress to normal without treatment with a probability 
of about 57% for CIN1, 43% for CIN2 and 32% for CIN3. The determinants leading to regression are 
not well understood.  
It is confirmed that persistent cervical infection by high risk HPV types is a precursor event to cervical 
cancer. 
The primary screening tool for cytological abnormalities is still the PAP smear test. Due to limitations 
of the original PAP test new methods have been developed. Currently liquid based PAP tests are 
routinely used. Nowadays the Bethesda classification system is used. This classification system 
specifies squamous cell abnormalities into four categories: atypical squamous cells (ASC), atypical 
squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion 
(LSIL), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).  
Although the immune response to HPV cervical infections is not fully understood, there is evidence 
that the host humoral and cell mediated immune responses are responsible for regression of HPV 
infection. With respect to the humoral immune responses anti-HPV antibodies are only detected in 50 
to 70% of infected women. Whereas the antibodies occur usually after several months post infection, 
they are long-lasting with steady levels. Because of the high level of antigenic specificity of HPV 
capsid antigens, there is no cross protection among subtypes but a type specific immunity develops.  
The interaction of cytokines, chemokines liberated during humoral and cell mediated immune 
reactions is assumed to be responsible for the regression associated with HPV. The severe outcome of 
HPV infection in immunosuppressed individuals as transplant recipients and HIV-positive women 
suggests that cell-mediated immunity is also important. Furthermore a polarisation of the immune 
response for a Th2 directed response was observed in woman with HPV infections that evolve into 
high grade lesions.

Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Cervarix, HPV-16/18 L1 AS04 vaccine contains recombinant C-terminally truncated major capsid L1 
proteins of HPV types 16 and 18 as active ingredients. The L1 proteins of HPV-16 and HPV-18 are 
separately produced using a recombinant Baculovirus expression system and the insect cell line Hi-5 
Rix4446 derived from Trichoplusia ni. After expression of the L1 proteins and further purification, the 
L1 proteins assembled separately as virus-like particles (VLP). The VLPs of each HPV type are 
formulated with the AS04 adjuvant system composed of aluminium hydroxide and 3-O-desacyl-4.-
monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL). The MPL immunostimulant is a detoxified derivative of the 
lipopolysaccharide of the gram negative bacterium Salmonella minnesota R595 strain.  
One dose of Cervarix, contains 20µg of HPV-16 L1 and 20µg of HPV-18 L1 proteins adjuvanted with 
AS04 and is presented as a sterile turbid liquid suspension for injection, filled as a 0.5ml monodose in 
either syringes or vials stored at 2-8°C.  A shelf life of 3 years is proposed. The vaccination schedule 
includes 3 doses administered at 0, 1, and 6 months intramuscularly. 
Active Substance  
The drug substance consists of two monovalent antigen bulks each containing C-terminally truncated 
versions of the major capsid L1 proteins of either type 16 or 18 HPV. These proteins are produced in 
separate production runs using the Baculoviruses expression vector system (BEVS) using GSK´s 
insect cell line cloned from the Hi-5 Trichoplusia ni insect cell line and HPV-16 L1 or HPV-18 L1 
encoding recombinant Baculoviruses. Following expression the L1 proteins are purified by a series of 
chromatographic and filtration procedures and are finally assembled into (VLP) closely resembling the 
configuration of native HPV virus particles. 
•  Manufacture 
Cell and Seed Banking 
The manufacturing of the HPV-16 L1 VLP and HPV-18 L1 VLP makes use of an established two-
tiered cell bank system of the Hi-5 Rix4446 cell line (Master and Working Cell Banks (MCB and 
WCB)) and an established two-tiered baculovirus Seed Lot system set up for the HPV-16 L1 and 
HPV-18 L1 gene-encoding recombinant baculoviruses (HPV-16 or HPV-18 Master and Working 
Seeds (MS and WS)).  
Satisfactory quality control testing are in place and satisfactory stability data and storage conditions 
have been described for these cell banks and seed lots. The MCB and WCB, as well as the End of 
Production Cells (EPC) were tested for identity, purity and safety (adventitious agents). The MS and 
WS, and their related control cells, were tested for identity, safety (adventitious agents) and 
Baculovirus content.  
This application concerns the first vaccine for human use that has been produced with a Baculovirus 
Expression Vector System. Hence, an extensive characterization was performed to confirm the safety 
and applicability of the integral elements of this novel system. The biological properties and 
characteristics of the Hi-5 Rix4446 cell line were extensively investigated. In particular, the Hi-5 
Rix4446 insect cell line has been examined for the presence of adventitious agents not only by 
applying the classical testing protocol but also by a variety of assays specifically designed for the 
detection of insect-specific viral contaminants. In addition, the tumorigenic potential of the cell line 
was investigated. The baculovirus seeds were also checked for classical and insect-specific 
contaminating viruses. Also, the construction and genetic stability of the recombinant baculovirus has 
been described in sufficient detail.

Manufacture and purification:  
A two-step process has been established for the large scale expression of L1 proteins in the Hi-5 
Rix4446 insect cells.  
First, recombinant baculovirus inocula of each serotype are prepared by amplification of the respective 
working seeds in the Hi-5 insect cell cultures. Next, these inocula are used for the infection of Hi-5 
production cell cultures. L1 protein is released from the cells by osmotic shock and subsequently 
purified by a series of chromatographic columns, a nanometric filtration, an ultrafiltration and a final 
sterile filtration to generate the L1 VLP purified bulks. 
The capacity of the individual steps of the purification cascade to efficiently eliminate viral 
contaminants has been demonstrated in viral clearance studies.  
The purified HPV-16 L1 VLP and HPV-18 L1 VLP protein bulks are stored in stainless steel vessels 
dedicated to the adsorption to aluminium for up to 3 days at 2°C-8°C or at room temperature. 
Process control and validation:  
The company has established a system of process control during the manufacturing of the active 
substance using in-process tests with assigned specifications and monitoring tests used to monitor the 
process consistency and performance. 
Validation of the HPV-16 L1 VLP and HPV-18 L1 VLP antigen production process was performed by 
the demonstration of process consistency through compliance with the pre-established QC standards 
and by the identification and validation of the manufacturing process critical parameters. 
Consistency was demonstrated for the three unit-steps of the drug substance production process: the 
recombinant HPV-16/18 baculovirus inoculum production process, the L1 single harvest production 
and L1 extraction and the L1 antigen purification process.  
Critical process parameters have been satisfactorily identified and batch data provided. 
Manufacturing process development: 
The comparability of HPV-16/18 L1 VLP antigen purified bulks prepared during the phase IIb and 
phase III development, including the final process purified bulks, was assessed by subjecting each type 
of materials to a series of physico-chemical analyses and by evaluation of the immunogenic properties.  
The results demonstrated satisfactory comparability. 
Elucidation of structure and other characteristics: 
An extensive number of batches of HPV-16 and HPV-18 drug substance produced by the final process 
has to date been subjected to structural and functional characterization. The physico-chemical 
properties of the L1-VLP assemblies were assessed in a multidisciplinary approach by identifying the 
electrophoretic profiles and molecular weight of L1 proteins (SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and 
capillary electrophoresis, mass spectrometry), the primary (amino acid analysis, peptide mapping, N- 
and C-terminal analysis), the secondary (Infra-Red and circular dichroism spectroscopy) and the VLP 
structure and size (size exclusion chromatography, electron microscopy, and disc centrifugation size 
analysis). In addition, drug substances were also characterized focussing on their immunological 
properties (antigenic activity, binding to polyclonal sera and immune response elicited in mice). The 
clear identity (match with the theoretical sequence) and consistent quality of drug substance material 
from different batches was confirmed in these studies.

Impurities: 
The applicant has considered host cell proteins (HCP), DNA, and infectious recombinant 
baculoviruses as potential impurities to be expected in drug substance purified bulks. Impurities are 
removed by the process very efficiently. Residual amounts of HCP were quantified by western blot 
and ELISA procedures. Also, data have been gathered to adequately demonstrate that other impurities 
such as lipids or carbohydrates are present only in negligible trace amounts.  
•  Specification: 
The release specifications for the drug substance include identity, purity by Coomassie-stained SDS-
PAGE, endotoxin content, total protein content, and antigenic activity. 
Analytical methods have been adequately described and validated. 
Batch analysis data were presented for four (HPV-16 L1 VLP) and five (HPV-18 L1 VLP) batches 
produced according to the final manufacturing process scale. Additional information was provided for 
batches from earlier process developmental stages.  The data were satisfactory. 
The Reference Standards established for the testing of the antigenic activity of drug substance bulks 
are the routine purified bulk batches for HPV-16 and for HPV-18. These batches complied with the 
specifications for identity, purity, sterility, endotoxin content, and protein content as set for drug 
product release control. 
Adjuvants: 
Satisfactory specifications and controls have been applied as appropriate to the adjuvants: O-desacyl-
4’- monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and aluminium hydroxide, hydrated (Al(OH)3). Non-
Pharmacopoeial methods have been satisfactorily validated. 
A detailed description of the analytical methods and their validation has been provided for the MPL 
powder and it is considered that the methods used are adequate to control the MPL powder on a 
routine basis.  Manufacturing of MPL has already been extensively assessed during the evaluation of 
Fendrix (EMEA/H/C/550, Hepatitis B (rDNA) Vaccine absorbed and adjuvanted):  
(http://www.emea.europa.eu/humandocs/Humans/EPAR/fendrix/fendrix.htm). 
See also Section 3.3 of this Assessment report for non-clinical evaluation of MPL itself as well as 
Cervarix. 
•  Stability 
The stability data obtained on purified bulks showed that the HPV-16 L1 VLP and HPV-18 L1 VLP 
antigen purified bulks are not affected by storage at +25 ± 2.5°C for 3 days or at + 2 to +8°C for 3 
days. No loss of antigen integrity (both at the protein or the VLP structure levels) and L1 VLP 
antigenic activity were observed. Similarly, storage of the purified bulks has had no impact on the 
quality of the derived adsorbed monovalent bulks, as evidenced by the similar immunogenicity 
profiles in mice and similar quality properties for all adsorbed monovalent bulks irrespective whether 
they were made with stored or freshly produced purified bulk material.  
Based on these data, the Company proposes a shelf life of 3 days at room temperature or at +2.0 to 
+8.0°C for the storage of HPV-16 L1 VLP and HPV-18 L1 VLP antigen purified bulks. 
Medicinal Product  
The HPV vaccine is prepared from HPV-16 L1 VLP and HPV-18 L1 VLP formulated with the AS04 
adjuvant system composed of aluminium hydroxide and 3-O-desacyl-4.-monophosphoryl lipid A 
(MPL). The vaccine is presented as a sterile turbid liquid suspension for injection, filled as a 
monodose in either syringes or vials stored at 2-8°C.

•  Pharmaceutical Development 
Formulation development 
The composition of Cervarix was determined based on the data obtained from non-clinical challenge 
animal models and from clinical epidemiological and natural history studies.  These studies showed 
that in order to be efficacious against HPV infection and related clinical lesions an HPV vaccine 
would need to induce strong antibody responses against the L1 capsid protein (assembled as VLPs), 
B-cell memory and T-cell responses. 
The Cervarix vaccine formulation was therefore selected to be a combination of L1 proteins 
assembled as VLPs, to insure the induction of protective anti-HPV L1 antibodies, and the proprietary 
adjuvant AS04 developed by GSK Biologicals, to insure the induction of persistently high levels of 
antibodies as well as the induction of a specific cell-mediated immunity.  
Data from pre-clinical immunogenicity studies supported the formulation of the vaccine containing an 
antigen to aluminium to MPL weight ratio of 1:25:2.5, respectively. The clinical study HPV-005 
evaluated three HPV-16/18 L1 AS04 candidate vaccine formulation with 6 μg, 20 μg or 60 μg of each 
antigen in comparison to the Al(OH)3 adjuvanted vaccine. There was a trend for higher antibody titres 
with increasing antigen dose levels that suggested that the 12 μg L1 dose was less immunogenic than 
the other antigen doses. Based on clinical data it was concluded that the HPV-16/18 L1 AS04 vaccine 
formulated with 20μg HPV-16 L1 and 20μg HPV-18 L1 afforded an acceptable balance between 
vaccine tolerability and the immune response elicited. 
The applicant quotes additional studies performed in the context of the approval of the Fendrix® anti 
hepatitis B vaccine (containing 20 µg of antigen in combination with 50 µg of MPL adsorbed to 
AlPO4) in order to support the formulation development strategy chosen for Cervarix.  
Manufacturing process development 
To allow for the withdrawal of the nominal content (0.5 ml), each syringe or vial is filled with an 
overfill. No overage of the active ingredient is applied for the formulation of the HPV vaccine. 
The Company made several optimisations during the development of the HPV-16/18 vaccine 
manufacturing process. The comparability of the drug product prepared during the phase IIb and phase 
III development, including the final process drug product, has been carried out by comparing 
properties of vaccine lots from different stages of the process development.  Physicochemical 
characterization confirmed that the lots of the different process development stages were comparable.  
Preclinical comparison of the immunogenicity induced by the different process development stages 
vaccine lots showed that all lots were able to elicit humoral and cellular immune responses which were 
consistent and comparable. 
Immunogenicity of different vaccine lots prepared during Phase IIb and Phase III development was 
further investigated in humans in clinical study HPV-012. The results showed that the Phase IIb and 
Phase III HPV vaccine formulations had comparable immunological properties (induction of 
antibodies, rate of seroconversion). 
•  Adventitious Agents 
In general, robust measures and precautions have been taken to ensure the safety of the HPV vaccine 
against non viral as well as viral adventitious agents.  
With respect to non-viral adventitious agents: 
•  Appropriate precautions have been taken during the preparation of the HPV vaccine to ensure the 
final product is free of bacteria, mycoplasma and fungi 
•  A cellular feature identified in the Hi-5 Rix4446 cells was not considered to be associated with 
replicative or infectious properties 
5
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  No materials of animal origin are used in the current routine production process of the HPV 
vaccine except casamino-acids that are used in the preparation of the MPL immunostimulant and 
for which the source is compliant with the current CPMP Note for Guidance 
(EMEA/CPMP/410/01). 
With respect to viral adventitious agents: 
The investigations performed demonstrated satisfactory viral clearance capacity of the HPV-16 L1 
VLP and HPV-18 L1 VLP antigen production processes and the absence of infectivity during QC 
testing or specific infectivity experiments both in the starting materials as well as during routine 
production; thereby supporting the viral safety of the HPV vaccine. 
•  Manufacture of the Product 
Drug product manufacture is a step-wise process in which the HPV-16 L1 VLP and HPV-18 L1 VLP 
as well as the liquid MPL are first individually adsorbed to Al(OH)3 to generate adsorbed bulks. The 
final bulk vaccine is produced by mixing defined amounts of adsorbed bulks and adding buffer 
solutions and Al(OH)3 to reach the intended final formulation. The MPL immunostimulant utilized 
here has previously been employed by GSK as a component of the Fendrix hepatitis B vaccine and the 
pertaining documentation has been reviewed and approved in the context of the licensing of the latter.  
The final vaccine is filled as a monodose in either sterile syringes (type 1 glass) or sterilised type I 
glass vials. Both container types are closed with grey butyl rubber stoppers.  The same 
container/closure material is used for other commercial vaccines manufactured by GSK Bio. 
The qualitative and quantitative composition of Cervarix is shown below.

describing unit operations and controls. 
Process Control and validation 
The following intermediates are generated during the manufacture of the final drug product: 
• HPV-16 and HPV-18 adsorbed monovalent bulks (AMBs) 
• MPL liquid bulk (MLB) 
• MPL adsorbed bulk (MAB) 
GSK has established a system of process control during the manufacturing of the drug product using 
in-process tests with assigned specifications and monitoring tests used to monitor the process 
consistency and performance.

All critical tests ensuring the product quality are performed during the Quality Control testing of the 
HPV-16 L1 and HPV-18 L1 AMBs and MPL liquid bulk. 
No process controls are applied for AMBs and MABs production. The process control of MLB 
production is tested by measuring the MPL particle size during the microfluidization procedure and 
before the final sterile filtration. In addition, the bioburden before sterile filtration is monitored. 
The QC testing programme established for AMBs addresses identity of the L1 protein, sterility, 
protein content and completeness of adsorption. Specifications and results of analysis are provided for 
four HPV-16 L1 VLP and five HPV-18 L1 VLP AMB batches 
Satisfactory validation of the methods used for control testing has been provided. 
Validation of the HPV vaccine production process was performed by the demonstration of process 
consistency through compliance with the pre-established QC standards and by the identification and 
validation of the manufacturing process critical parameters. 
These QC data met the specifications considered to be indicators of the consistency and robustness of 
the mentioned process steps. 
For the MPL liquid bulk production process additional data have been collected for consistency 
batches by investigating the effect of different process parameters of the microfluidization step.  
Critical process parameters have been satisfactorily identified and batch data provided. 
The validation of final HPV vaccine production step was further confirmed by means of in vivo 
consistency studies addressing immunogenicity issues for the final product. For this, the ability of 
three final process HPV vaccine lots to induce the production of HPV-L1 specific antibodies and a 
cellular immune response (IFN-γ and IL-5) was studies in BALB/c mice. These experiments 
confirmed that all three batches were capable of inducing a consistent immune response.   
In conclusion, validation of the manufacturing was satisfactory. 
Control of excipients 
Satisfactory specifications and controls (Pharmacopoeials and in-house) have been applied as 
appropriate to the excipients. Non-Pharmacopoeial methods have been satisfactorily validated. 
•  Product Specification 
The final bulk vaccine is tested for sterility. Final containers are subjected to tests for identity, sterility, 
general safety, in vitro relative potency, pH, volume, protein content, aluminium content, MPL content 
and completeness of adsorption for MPL, HPV-16 L1 VLP and HPV-18 L1 VLP proteins. 
Satisfactory data from the analysis of consistency batches and from stability studies have been 
provided. 
Analytical methods used for release testing have been satisfactorily validated. 
Satisfactory batch analysis data have been provided for 3 lots of each final bulk and final containers  
Reference Standards or Materials  
Two types of reference standard preparations are currently used for HPV vaccine testing: 
•  Purified bulk reference standard: Two routine HPV-16 L1 VLP and HPV-18 L1 VLP purified bulk 
preparations are used for testing completeness of adsorption to aluminium (unbound HPV-16 L1 
7

VLP and HPV-18 L1 VLP, respectively). Batch analysis data for these two batches has been 
provided. 
•  Final container reference standard: A routine final container preparation of HPV vaccine is 
employed for potency testing. 
Reference standards used for MPL testing: 
•  Three reference standard established for the testing of the MPL content of HPV final container 
vaccines is a routine MPL liquid bulk batch. This batch complied with the specifications set at the 
time of release.  
•  Stability of the Product 
Final bulk: 
Three final bulk lots have been followed in long-term stability studies. Results available at this time 
for the final process consistency lots stored in polyethylene containers at +2 to +8°C provide evidence 
for a stability period for at least 18 months. 
Finished product  
Stability data presented have been generated on the three consistency lots produced according to the 
final manufacturing process and on vaccine lots representative of the proposed consistency 
formulation and presentation but derived from earlier production process stages administered in 
Phases IIb/III of the clinical development. 
A number of stability studies are ongoing and will be completed as post-approval commitments.  
During the procedure, stability data was updated and from the data provided, no signs of instability 
were evident. 
The proposed shelf life for the vaccine finished product is 36 months at +2-8°C and is considered to be 
satisfactory.

Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Non-clinical pharmacological, pharmacokinetics and toxicology studies were undertaken on HPV-
16/18 L1 VLP AS04 in parallel with studies on AS04 and MPL, based on  
- 
- 
- 
the CPMP Note for Guidance on preclinical pharmacological and toxicological testing of 
vaccines (CPMP/SWP/465/95),  
the Guideline on adjuvants in vaccines for human use (EMEA/CHMP/VEG/134716/2004),  
the Note for Guidance on Reproductive Toxicology: Detection of Toxicity to Reproduction 
for Medicinal Products (CPMP/ICH/386/95). 
Based on these same guidelines secondary pharmacodynamic, pharmacodynamic drug interaction, 
pharmacokinetics, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies were not performed on the HPV-16/18 L1 
VLP AS04 vaccine and secondary pharmacodynamic, pharmacodynamic drug interaction and 
carcinogenicity studies were not performed on MPL. 
GLP 
Primary pharmacology studies were not performed under GLP conditions.  
Safety pharmacology and toxicology studies were carried out under GLP conditions.  
Pharmacology 
•  Primary pharmacodynamics  
Given the species specificity of HPV precluding the evaluation of any human HPV-16/18 vaccine in 
protection animal models, primary pharmacodynamic studies aimed at the preclinical evaluation of the 
immunogenicity of the HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine were carried out in mice and Rhesus 
monkeys. 
•  A first group of experiments in BALB/c mice compared the immunogenicity of different HPV-
16/18 L1 VLP AS04 formulations containing various doses of aluminium salt (Al(OH)3), MPL or 
HPV-16/18 L1 VLP antigen. 
•  A second group of experiments in BALB/c mice targeted the characterisation of both humoral and 
cellular immune responses induced by HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 by comparing the immune 
responses to the immunogenicity of plain HPV-16/18 L1 VLP and HPV-16/18 L1 VLP Al(OH)3. 
These pre-clinical experiments demonstrated that the HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine provides 
a superior immunogenicity profile for a protective HPV vaccine compared to the HPV-16/18 L1 
VLP Al(OH)3 and the plain HPV-16/18 L1 VLP formulations. The HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 
vaccine was indeed able to induce higher and more persistent anti-HPV-16/18 L1 VLP antibody 
levels, higher levels of IgG2a antibodies and superior levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α, cytokines with 
known antiviral properties. In addition, HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 also induced elevated 
frequencies of memory B-cells which should have a positive impact on antibody persistence. The 
comparison of the immunogenicity of HPV-16/18 L1 VLP Al(OH)3 and HPV-16/18 L1 VLP 
AS04 formulations in rhesus monkeys, more closely related to humans, confirmed the superior 
9

immunogenicity profile associated to the use of the HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine including 
the induction of higher levels of neutralizing antibodies. 
Another series of experiments was performed to evaluate the immunostimulatory properties of the 
AS04 adjuvant containing 3-O-desacyl-4’-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), a derivative from 
Salmonella minnesota Lipopolyssacharides (LPS), and aluminium salt (Al(OH)3). 
•  Two experiments, performed on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and on a 
human monocytic cell line (U937), demonstrated that AS04, like MPL, is a potent inducer of pro-
inflammatory cytokine (IL-6 and TNF-α) secretion by monocytes in vitro.  
•  A third experiment performed in mice demonstrated that AS04 is functionally equivalent to MPL 
regarding the in vivo induction of antigen-presenting cell maturation as evaluated by the 
upregulation of CD40 expression. 
•  Secondary pharmacodynamics 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies were performed according to the Note for Guidance on 
Preclinical Pharmacological and Toxicological testing of vaccines (CPMP/465/95) and Guideline on 
Adjuvants in Vaccines for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/VEG/134716/2004). 
•  Safety pharmacology programme 
The possible side effects of the HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine on cardiovascular and respiratory 
parameters in the anaesthetized SPF female Wistar rats were investigated. Intramuscular 
administration of 0.1ml/animal of the HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine did not produce any 
treatment-related effects on blood pressure, heart rate, ECG (lead II) or respiration depth and rate. 
•  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed according to the Note for Guidance on 
Preclinical Pharmacological and Toxicological testing of vaccines (CPMP/465/95) and Guideline on 
Adjuvants in Vaccines for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/VEG/134716/2004). 
Pharmacology / MPL 
The activity of 3-O-desacyl-4’-monophosphoryl Lipid A (MPL), a derivative from Salmonella 
minnesota LPS, regarding the induction of co-stimulatory molecules (APC maturation) and the 
induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines has been investigated. A first set of primary 
pharmacodynamic studies performed in mice or on murine cells demonstrated that MPL plays a key 
role in inducing antigen –presenting cell (APC) maturation by the up-regulation of CD80, CD86 and 
CD40 co-stimulatory molecules both in vitro and in vivo, and by inducing the secretion of pro-
inflammatory cytokines  (IL-6, TNF-α) by APC in vitro. The experiments emphasize that MPL plays a 
significant role in the activation of innate immunity, which is critical for the induction of antigen-
specific adaptive immune response. The role played by MPL on the induction of co-stimulatory 
molecules, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines on human cells was further confirmed by in 
vitro studies on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or on whole blood. MPL stimulation of 
human whole blood was shown to induce a panel of cytokines (IL-12, IFN-γ, IFN-α, IL-10), pro-
inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, Il-1β) as well as chemokines (PCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β). 
Finally, in vitro studies on human PBMCs were shown to be supportive of the hypothesis that MPL 
acts through interactions with the human TLR4 receptor, but not with the human TLR2 receptor, to 
activate peripheral blood monocytes.  
A cardiovascular and respiratory safety pharmacology study was performed in Beagle dogs and did 
not show any statistically significant nor physiologically relevant effects on the blood pressure, heart 
rate, respiration depth or rate or any abnormalities in the electrocardiogram waveform. 
The Pharmacology studies showed that MPL plays a significant role in the activation of innate 
immunity and does not induce undesirable pharmacological effects on cardio-respiratory functions in 
animal models.

Pharmacokinetics 
Studies to demonstrate absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the active ingredients in 
Cervarix have not been performed for any of the component viruses. This is in line with Note for 
guidance on preclinical pharmacological and toxicological testing of vaccines (CPMP/SWP/465/95).    
Pharmacokinetics / MPL 
The pharmacokinetics, absorption, distribution and elimination of 14C-MPL have been investigated 
following a single intramuscular or a single intravenous administration to the male Han Wistar rat at 
nominal dose levels of 100 μg/kg bodyweight.  For both routes of administration, the dose was 
formulated as an aqueous solution, and was administered as a bolus injection over ca. 30 seconds. The 
highest observed concentrations of radioactivity in blood were 14.9 (occurring at 4 hours post-dose) 
and 248 (occurring at 5 minutes post-dose) ng equivalents of MPL/g of sample, following 
intramuscular and intravenous administration, respectively. The concentration remained relatively 
constant thereafter following intramuscular administration, and at 168 hours post-dose was 11.4 ng 
equivalents of MPL/g.  The elimination half-life following intravenous administration was 76.5 hours. 
Relatively low quantifiable levels of radioactivity were detected in all tissues investigated at 56 days 
post-dose in both studies, with the highest concentrations observed in the fat and spleen. 
The routes and rates of elimination were similar following both intramuscular and intravenous 
administration. The major route of elimination of MPL-related material was via the faeces accounting 
for a mean of approximately 24 % of the dose for both routes, with urinary elimination accounting for 
a mean of approximately 4 % of the dose. Radioactivity in the expired air traps accounted for a mean 
of approximately 2 % of the dose for each set of air traps. The mean total of radioactivity in the tissues 
and residual carcass was approximately 6 % of the dose, with the injection site accounted for 
approximately 0.2 % of the dose. The mean total recovery of radioactivity (including cage washes and 
cage debris) was approximately 38 %.  The low total recovery is considered to be due to the 
elimination of volatile organic molecules that had not been trapped efficiently by the chosen trapping 
solution used in these studies. 
Based on the MPL-related material recovered in the faeces, urine, expired air traps, tissues (excluding 
the injection site) and residual carcass following intramuscular administration, approximately 35% of 
the dose appeared to be absorbed.  However, the total absorption is likely to be much higher than this 
value since only 0.2% of the dose was recovered from the injection site. 
In conclusion the pharmacokinetic studies conducted in rats have shown that MPL-related material is 
widely distributed throughout the body, notably to the fat and spleen, and is then likely eliminated 
mainly via the expired air, with only low levels of radioactivity remaining in the carcass.  
Toxicology 
•  Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose toxicity of the HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine was assessed as part of the repeat-dose 
toxicity study in rabbits. The treatment was well tolerated and no treatment-related systemic effect was 
noticed on haematology, body-weight, clinical signs, mortality and clinical chemistry over a 14-day 
observation period. 
•  Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
Repeated-dose toxicity studies have been performed with Cervarix and AS04 (intramuscular 
administration in rabbits).  
The HPV-16 /18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine and the AS04 adjuvant were well tolerated. The organ-weight 
data, macroscopic pathology evaluation, and evaluation of systemic effects showed no consistent 
treatment-related findings. Signs of inflammation at the injection sites of the test vaccine were 
observed. Histological examination of the administration sites a few days after vaccination with HPV-
16/18 L1 VLP AS04 revealed evidence of sub-acute inflammation with slight to moderate focal 
degeneration, necrosis, or regeneration of myofibres. Animals which solely received aluminium 
hydroxide or AS04 also showed evidence of inflammation at the injection site although the 
11

inflammation was of shorter duration and less extensive. Examination after a treatment free period (4 
or 13 weeks) revealed evidence of histological changes (i.e. myofibres regeneration) that were 
indicative of an ongoing process of recovery. 
The injection site reaction  was accompanied with a temporary increase in the number of neutrophils 
and in fibrinogen, which may be a consequence of the recruitment of inflammatory cells following 
injections of the formulations. 
•  Genotoxicity 
According to the Note for Guidance on preclinical pharmacological and toxicological testing of 
vaccines (CPMP/SWP/465/95) and the Guideline on adjuvants in vaccines for human use 
(EMEA/CHMP/VEG/134716/2004) genotoxicity studies are not required for this vaccine. 
•  Carcinogenicity 
According to the Note for Guidance on preclinical pharmacological and toxicological testing of 
vaccines (CPMP/SWP/465/95) and the Guideline on adjuvants in vaccines for human use 
(EMEA/CHMP/VEG/134716/2004) carcinogenicity studies are not required for this vaccine. 
•  Reproduction Toxicity 
The reproductive and developmental toxicity of Cervarix and the AS04 adjuvant alone was assessed in 
a study in female rats of the CD strain. The influence of Cervarix on fertility, embryo-fetal, peri-natal 
and post-natal survival and development was examined.  
The study did not show any effect of vaccination with Cervarix or administration of AS04 on any 
phases of reproduction and foetal development in rats.   
An immune response to the vaccine was observed, and antibodies were transferred to the offspring 
during gestation and also during lactation.  
•  Local tolerance  
Local tolerance was assessed as part of the toxicity studies by intramuscular administration of the 
vaccine in rabbits.  
The in vitro mutagenicity (Ames) and clastogenicity (CHO cells) tests, and in vivo micronucleus assay 
demonstrated no genotoxic potential of the MPL adjuvant. 
Toxicology / MPL 
Pre-clinical toxicity studies have been carried out to detect potential toxic signs associated with MPL 
administration and are shortly summarized below: 
Acute toxicity of MPL was tested in Sprague-Dawley rats by intraperitoneal injections of single 
dosages of 10, 40, 400, and 4000 μg of MPL per body weight kg. Dosage-related effects were 
restricted to a slight increase in the incidence and relative severity of interstitial infiltration of 
mononuclear inflammatory cells in the omentum most probably due to the route of injection 
(intraperitoneal). This slightly irritating effect of MPL was neither apparent at dosages below 400 
μg/kg nor was it correlated with any other anatomical or clinical changes. 
Repeat-dose toxicity of MPL administered intravenously was examined in two rat studies with 
dosage levels of 100, 1000, or 2500 μg/kg/day for 8 days, and of 40, 200, or 1000 μg/kg/day for 7 
days, respectively, and in dogs with dosage levels of 6, 120, or 1200 μg/kg/day during 14 days. In the 
first study, a dosage of 5000 μg/kg/day was initially tested and decreased to 2500 μg/kg/day due to 
excessive mortality. In contrast, no mortality occurred in the second study. In rats, reversible 
decreased body weight gain and food consumption were observed at all dosages. The incidence of 
clinical signs was increased at MPL dosage of 2500 μg/kg/day while no remarkable clinical signs were 
12
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
observed at lowest dosages. A decrease in platelets was observed in males at MPL dosage ≥ 1000 
μg/kg/day level, but not in females. A dose-dependent decrease was noted in erythrocytes, 
haemoglobin and hematocrit. A dose–related increase in segmented neutrophils was also noted. Organ 
weight increase was noticed in all groups, with a wider organ distribution at higher MPL dosages. The 
histopathological examination performed in the first study revealed changes generally characterized by 
infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells in several organs. These effects were minor at the 40 
μg/kg/day dose, which was therefore considered well-tolerated. In dogs, repeated intravenous 
administrations of MPL only produced mild toxicity at dosage levels of 120 and 1200 μg/kg/day. A 
dosage level of 6 μg/kg/day was considered a no-observed-effect-level for this study.  
No toxicokinetic studies were performed during the repeated-dose toxicity study program, according 
to the Note for Guidance on preclinical pharmacological and toxicological testing of vaccines 
(CPMP/SWP/465/95 guidance), and the Guideline on adjuvants in vaccines for human use 
(EMEA/CHMP/VEG/134716/2004). 
Genotoxicity studies performed in vitro did no reveal any MPL-related mutagenic activity or 
genotoxic effect. In vivo studies did not show any evidence of increased frequency of micronucleated 
immature erythrocytes or bone marrow cell toxicity linked to MPL. 
Reproductive and developmental studies carried out in rats and rabbits by subcutaneous 
administration of MPL at dosage levels of up to 100 μg/kg/day showed no indication of maternal or 
embryo toxicity or teratogenicity, and no adverse effects of the maternal treatment on the F1 
generation, their maturation and reproductive performance. 
In conclusion, MPL showed effects expected from a strong stimulation of the immune system. Under 
the reported studies, MPL appears to have a high safety margin and is suitable as human vaccine 
immunostimulant at the proposed dosage of 50 μg/vaccine dose, which corresponds to a 1.7-0.7 μg/kg 
dose for a 30-70 kg-weighing person.  
Ecotoxicity / environmental risk assessment 
According the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of medicinal products for 
human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), an ERA is not required for vaccines. 
Overall, it can be concluded that none of the ingredients of the HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine will 
enter the environment in quantities that merit ecological concern following its prescribed use in 
humans. Therefore, no specific precautionary and safety measures need to be taken regarding the 
environmental release from use in patients, and disposal of unused products or waste materials derived 
from the vaccine 
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, fertility, embryo-foetal and postnatal 
toxicity (up to the end of the lactation period).  
4.  Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The clinical development programme to support licensure of the Cervarix consisted of 9 clinical 
studies. Approximately 24348 subjects were included. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
13
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
Pharmacokinetics 
No clinical pharmacology studies describing the pharmacokinetic properties of Cervarix were 
conducted in support of this application. This is in accordance with the Guideline on clinical 
evaluation of new vaccines (EMEA/VWP/164653/05), which states, that pharmacokinetic studies are 
generally not required for injectable vaccines because they do not provide information useful for 
establishing adequate dosing recommendations. Pharmacodynamic evaluations related to the humoral 
and cellular immune responses to HPV were assessed in Phase I through Phase III studies.  
Pharmacodynamics / Immunogenicity 
The pharmacodynamics of the vaccine relate to its interaction with the immune system. Therefore, this 
section will discuss the data on the systemic immune response to vaccination. 
The antibody response and cell mediated immune response to the candidate HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 
vaccine was investigated in exploratory phase I/IIa studies HPV-003, HPV-004 and HPV-005 (see 
Table below) and pivotal studies HPV-012, HPV-013 and HPV-014 (see Table below). In addition, 
immunogenicity was also evaluated in the efficacy studies HPV-001, HPV-007 and HPV-008 (see 
section Clinical Efficacy).

For all studies anti-HPV-16/18 antibody titres were summarized by geometric mean titres (GMTs) 
with their 95% confidence intervals prior to vaccination and at relevant time points following 
vaccination. Furthermore reverse cumulative distribution curves for these antibody titres were 
displayed. In addition seropositivity rates and their exact 95% confidence intervals were calculated. 
Dose response study 
In the dose escalating and selection study HPV-005 (for study outline see table in Pharmacodynamic 
section) the appropriate amount of the L1 derived VLPs for HPV-16 and HPV-18 were evaluated with 
respect to the safety profile and the immunogenicity (antibody responses). HPV-16/18 vaccine lots of 
different antigen content ranging from 6µg, 20µg and 60µg of each of the two HPV-16 and HPV-18 
L1 VLP per dose were investigated. A total of 210 healthy women 18 to 30 years of age were enrolled 
in this study.

While differences in immunogenicity are marginal or not significant – depending on the type of 
recombinant L1 - choice of the 40 µg dose (20 µg HPV 16 L1 and 20 µg HPV 18 L1) appears to be 
appropriate and represents a conservative dose selection. 
A candidate vaccine with an antigen content of 20µg HPV-16 L1 and 20µg HPV-18 L1 per dose was 
chosen for the further clinical development program.  
AS04 Adjuvanting System 
Consistently high immunogenicity of Cervarix is largely mediated by the use of AS04 as an 
adjuvanting system. The following table shows superiority of AS04 compared to conventional 
aluminium hydroxide or plain VLPs:

LL/UL = Lower/Upper limits of the 95% confidence interval on the Log10 mean titre 
Results shown above (with regard to GMTs) are, in principle, representative and consistent for all 
clinical trials conducted throughout the pharmaceutical development program and support the use of 
AS04 as the preferred adjuvanting system for recombinant HPV 16/18 L1 particles. 
Humoral immune response: 
The immunogenicity induced by three doses of Cervarix has been evaluated in 5,303 female subjects 
from 10 to 55 years of age. 
A number of different approaches were pursued, finally evolving into three different assay systems 
that were applied in all pivotal clinical studies for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the immune 
response induced. These assays include: 
•  An ELISA binding assay for antibody quantification (determination of GMTs) 
•  An inhibition assay to measure the amount of serum antibodies against neutralizing epitopes 
present on the surface of HPV 16 and 18  
•  A neutralization assay involving HPV pseudoparticles developed by the US National Cancer 
Institute 
These assays were carefully cross validated against each other showing reasonable concordance of 
assay results. Thus, antibodies measured by ELISA in individual clinical trials are to a great extent 
functional. Consequently, the humoral part of the immunological mode of action of Cervarix may be 
explained by neutralization of wild-type HPV 16 and 18, respectively. 
Measuring GMTs themselves does not provide sufficient information on the quality of the immune 
response. The following graphs provide some insight into the correlation between vaccine-induced 
serum antibody titres and their capacity to inhibit binding of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (V5 
and J4) to their corresponding epitopes on the viral surface. Moreover, the graphs illustrate again the 
superiority of the AS04 adjuvanting system over Al(OH)3 with regard to GMTs, titres of functional 
antibodies and persistence of functional, i.e. virus neutralizing antibodies.

Significant differences (p<0.05) between the antibody titres of the AS04 and the aluminium group are indicated in the figure 
by asterisks (n=9-19 subjects for the aluminium salt group, n=21-37 subjects for the AS04 group).  
Arrows indicate vaccination timepoints.  
The two lower figures demonstrate the correlation between vaccine-induced serum antibody titres and their capacity to 
inhibit binding of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (V5 and J4) to their corresponding epitopes on the viral surface. 
Persistence of a quantitatively and qualitatively acceptable immune response is an important element 
to assure long-term protection from disease as well as to define the correct time point for booster 
vaccination. 
Local immunity: 
A key element to understand the immunological mode of action of Cervarix is to investigate the local 
activity of antibodies, such as IgGs transudated from the serum to the cervical mucosa. 
The first issue, i.e. the local immune response, was addressed in the very early phase of the clinical 
development program and was aimed at measuring IgG activity in cervical samples and correlating 
these activities to serum antibody activities. These early results of Study HPV-005 are presented in 
the table below.

Careful interpretation of data allows the conclusion that there is a dose-effect-relationship, however, 
the clinical significance of local antibody activity and titres remains unclear. Nevertheless some 
evidence has been provided that i.m. injection of recombinant HPV 16 and 18 L1 particles do trigger 
an immune response at the target organ/tissue. 
A subset of approximately 90 subjects in study HPV-014 provided blood samples and had cervico-
vaginal secretion (CVS) samples collected one year after the third dose of the vaccine (Month 18). 
Cervico-vaginal HPV-16 VLP antibodies were detected in 85.7%, 80.8% and 77.3% of subjects in the 
[15-25], [26-45] and [46-55] age groups, respectively. Similarly, cervico-vaginal HPV-18 VLP 
antibodies were detected in CVS in 71.4%, 61.5% and 68.2% of subjects in the [15-25], [26-45] and 
[46-55] age group, respectively  
Cell mediated immunity: 
Vaccine efficacy and, in particular, long-term efficacy requires evaluation of the involvement of the 
cellular part of the immune system. A battery of methods has been developed and applied in a variety 
of studies to investigate activation of T-cell response and formation of memory B cells following

been applied is outlined below.

In essence, vaccination with Cervarix apparently addresses a number of immunological compartments 
which is evidenced by specific expression of cytokine profiles. Expression levels and proliferative 
responses were strongly depended on antigen doses administered and reacted anamnestically on a 
multiple dose vaccination schedule indicating development of an immunological memory.  
Also for the cell mediated immune response AS04 turned out to be superior with regard to its capacity 
to stimulate various elements of the cellular immune system compared to Al(OH)3. 
In conclusion, there is sufficient evidence that Cervarix induces a strong cell mediated immune 
response. For the time being none of the cell-mediated immunity (CMI) parameters measured can, 
however, be correlated with clinical efficacy.

Only an MPL-containing vaccine such as Cervarix has a booster effect on a confirmed pre-existing 
anti-MPL immune response. A HAV (Hepatitis A) vaccine that does not contain MPL components has 
no such effect. However, even for Cervarix the booster effect on a pre-existing MPL “immunity” is 
weak to moderate and, most likely, will have no clinical effect. Such type of anti-MPL immune 
response is expected upon contact with any type of MPL-like substance which in most instances will 
be bacterial antigens containing MPL components in their outer cell wall structure. 
Whether or not residual MPL “immunity” might impair immunogenicity of Cervarix has been 
addressed by grouping a subset of the study population from study HPV-013 into four different anti- 
MPL titer categories.

slightly more pronounced for HPV 16 L1 compared to HPV 18 L1. Overall, anti HPV L1 titres are 
higher in this specific subset of a study population. Apparently, pre-existing anti MPL “immunity” is 
an advantage rather than a risk with regard to the potential to trigger an optimal immune response 
following vaccination with Cervarix.

Persistence of Immunity 
Phase IIb efficacy/long-term efficacy studies HPV 001 and HPV 007 provide the currently best 
available overview on the long-term persistence of immunity. The outline of these studies is described 
under supportive studies further below.

Studies HPV-001 and HPV-007: Persistence of Anti-HPV-16 and Anti-HPV-18 Antibodies 
(Binding ELISA) after Vaccination (0, 1, 6 Month Schedule, Serology Post-Dose III)  
These data are a good indicator for long term persistence of vaccine induced immune response until at 
least month 64 post dose 1. Evaluation of the long-term persistence of the initial immune response is 
ongoing in a number of studies (see table below).

Study HPV-012 
Information about the study outline can be found in the table provided in the beginning of the 
Pharmacodynamic/Immunogenicity section of this report. 
A total of 770 subjects were vaccinated in this study. Of these, 458 subjects 15-25 years of age (mean: 
20.2+/-3.0 years) received one of three lots of HPV-16/18 vaccine, 154 subjects 15-25 years of age 
(mean: 20.3+/-3.0 years) received a previous formulation and 158 subjects 10-14 years of age (mean: 
12.4+/-1.4 years) also received one of the three vaccine lots. 
At Month 7, all initially seronegative subjects, regardless of their age and regardless of the vaccine 
they received, had seroconverted to both HPV-16 and HPV-18.

The secondary objective of demonstrating non-inferiority of the 10-14 year age group compared to the 
15-25 year age group when receiving the same  production lot was also met, since at Month 7, the 
upper limit of the 95% CI on the difference between the percentage of subjects who seroconverted in 
the older age group versus the younger age group was <10% and that the upper limit of the 95% CI on 
the GMT ratio between the older age group and younger age group was <2 . Overall, adolescents 
achieved significantly higher GMTs for both antigens (>2-fold) as compared to subjects 15-25 years 
of age.

Study HPV-013 
Information about the study outline can be found in the table provided at the beginning of the 
Pharmacodynamic/Immunogenicity section of this report. 
Secondary objectives included evaluation of antibody responses against HPV-16, HPV- 
18 and MPL (by ELISA) at Month 0, 2 and 7. 
A total of 2067 subjects were vaccinated in this study: 1035 subjects in the HPV group 
(mean age: 12.1+/-1.4 years) and 1032 subjects in the control group (mean age: 12.1+/-1.4 
years). Of these, 675 subjects were included in the immunogenicity subset. 
After the third dose, all initially seronegative subjects had seroconverted for both antigens 
and had achieved GMTs of 19882.0 EU/mL for anti-HPV-16 antibodies and 8262.0 
EU/mL for anti-HPV-18 antibodies.

PRE = Pre-vaccination 
PII(M2) = Post Dose II (Month 2)

Initially seropositive subjects also elicited immune responses to the vaccine and achieved 
GMTs levels for both antigens that were comparable to initially seronegative subjects. 
In the above described two clinical trials (HPV-012 and HPV-013) performed in girls and adolescents 
aged 10 to 14 years, all subjects seroconverted to both HPV types 16 and 18 after the third dose (at 
month 7) with GMTs at least 2-fold higher as compared to women aged 15 to 25 years. On the basis of 
these immunogenicity data, the efficacy of Cervarix is inferred from 10 to 14 years of age. 
Study HPV-014 
In another clinical trial (study 014) performed in women aged 15 to 55 years, all subjects 
seroconverted to both HPV types 16 and 18 after the third dose (at month 7). The GMTs were, 
however, lower in women above 25 years. Nevertheless, all subjects remained seropositive for both 
types throughout the follow-up phase (up to month 18) maintaining antibody levels at an order of 
magnitude above those encountered after natural infection. Information about the study outline can be 
found in the table presented in the Pharmacodynamics / Immunogenicity section of this report.  
Older age, smoking, and, even more pronounced a combination of both may significantly reduce the 
immunogenicity. 
Factors such as hormone contraception, hormone replacement therapy, pre- or post menopausal status, 
do not significantly reduce immunogenicity of Cervarix. 
27
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Study HPV-014 further demonstrated, that seropositivity with regard to HPV 16 and 18 at the time of 
vaccination has some marginal influence on the kinetics of the immune response as well as on final 
GMTs and is more pronounced in older individuals compared to those who are younger: 
Whether or not vaccination of a seropositive female population has any effect on clinical efficacy of 
Cervarix cannot be assessed for the time being. 
Immunogenicity in Other Populations: 
The effect of other medicinal products including vaccines on the immunogenicity of Cervarix has not 
been investigated. 
Cervarix has not been investigated in male subjects. 
Cervarix has not been investigated in pregnant and lactating women. 
Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of Cervarix was assessed in 2 controlled, double-blind, randomised Phase II and III 
clinical studies that included a total of 19,778 women aged 15 to 25 years. 
In the phase II HPV-001/007 study (described in this report under supportive studies) only HPV naïve 
women (negative for oncogenic HPV DNA [HPV-16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 
68], seronegative for HPV-16 and HPV-18 and normal cytology at study entry) were enrolled. In the 
pivotal phase III trial HPV-008 women were included without pre-screening for the presence of HPV 
infection, i.e. regardless of baseline cytology and HPV serological and DNA status.

•  Main studies  
The Applicant performed two sets of trials, the 001 – 007 set (of which the data were initially 
submitted) listed in this report under supportive studies and the 008 trial, of which the data of an 
interim analysis was submitted with the response to the CHMP LoQ at day 120 of the review. Both 
trials 007 and 008 are still ongoing and continue to generate data on both efficacy and safety. Data is 
available from studies HPV-001/007 (5.5 years) and HPV-008 (15 months). 
Study HPV-008    
HPV-008 is a controlled, double blinded Phase III randomized clinical trial performed in Asia 
Pacific, Europe, Latin America and North America. HPV-008 has been conducted under the 
supervision of an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) with duration of 48 months of 
follow-up. 
The presented event-driven interim analysis was to be performed when at least 23 cases of CIN2+ 
with HPV-16 or HPV-18 DNA detected in the lesion. 
METHODS 
Study Participants and Sample sizes 
A total of 18729 subjects were enrolled in the study. The study is conducted in 133 centres in 14 
countries spread across four study regions: Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America and North America. 
The target was to enrol approximately 18 000 unscreened women aged 15 to 25 years.  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected to allow enrolment of a broad population of 
women, including both those previously uninfected with HPV (HPV naïve) and those previously or 
currently infected with HPV (HPV non-naïve). No HPV serological testing, HPV DNA screening or 
cervical cytological screening was performed prior to enrolment.  
Inclusion Criteria 
•  A woman between, and including, 15 and 25 years of age at the time of the first vaccination. 
•  Subject must be free of obvious health problems as established by medical history 
and clinical examination before entering into the study.

•  Subject must be of non-childbearing potential (e.g. surgically sterilized) or, if of 
childbearing potential, she must be abstinent or must be using adequate contraceptive 
precautions for 30 days prior to the first vaccination and must agree to continue such precautions for 
two months after completion of the vaccination series. 
•  Has had no more than 6 lifetime sexual partners prior to enrollment. This criterion 
may not be applicable in subjects less than 18 years of age, according to local 
regulatory/ethical requirements. 
•  Subject must have intact cervix (e.g. no history of cauterization or surgical treatment 
involving damage to the transformation zone of the cervix). 
Main Exclusion Criteria 
•  Pregnant or breastfeeding. Women must be at least 3 months post-pregnancy and not 
breastfeeding to enter the study.

•  Use  of  any  investigational  or  non-registered  product  (drug  or  vaccine)  other  than  the  study 
vaccine(s)  within  30  days  preceding  the  first  dose  of  study  vaccine,  or  planned  use  during  the 
31 
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
study period. 
•  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immune-
modifying  drugs  within  six  months  prior  to  the  first  vaccine  dose.  Inhaled  and  topical  steroids 
were allowed.

Enrollment will be deferred until the subject is outside of specified window. 
Study cohorts/data sets analyzed 
At the interim analysis analysis of efficacy is performed on the Total Vaccinated cohort for efficacy 
1 (primary analysis) and on the Total Vaccinated cohort for efficacy 2. 
Analysis of safety is performed on the Total Vaccinated cohort (primary analysis) and on the ATP 
cohort for safety. 
Analysis of immunogenicity is performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity (primary analysis) 
and on the Total Vaccinated cohort. 
Total Vaccinated cohort for efficacy 1 (TVC-1) 
The Total Vaccinated cohort for efficacy 1 (TVC-1) includes all vaccinated subjects (at least one 
dose) for whom data concerning efficacy endpoint measures are available and who were HPV DNA 
negative and seronegative to the relevant HPV type (HPV-16 or HPV-18) at study entry. Women 
with high-grade or missing cytology (0.5%) were excluded from the efficacy analysis. 
For this cohort, the follow-up time for a subject started at the day after Dose 1. 
Total Vaccinated cohort for efficacy 2 (TVC-2) 
A pre-specified analysis, Total Vaccinated cohort for efficacy 2 (TVC-2) was identical to the TVC-1 
analysis except that it excluded women with abnormal cytology at study entry.  
In addition, subjects must be negative for HPV DNA (by PCR) at Month 0 for the corresponding 
HPV type considered in the analysis (i.e. HPV type associated with the efficacy endpoint). For this 
cohort, the follow-up time for a subject started at the day after Dose 1. For all stratified efficacy 
endpoints, the principal analysis is performed on subjects who were seronegative (by ELISA) prior 
to vaccination for the corresponding HPV type considered in the analysis. 
This analysis complements the analysis on TVC-1 and is performed at the interim analysis on 
primary and secondary endpoints that are associated with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 only. 
According-to-protocol (ATP) cohort for analysis of efficacy 
The ATP cohort for analysis of efficacy includes all evaluable subjects (i.e. those meeting all 
eligibility criteria, complying with the procedures defined in the protocol, with no elimination 
violations) for whom data concerning efficacy endpoint measures are available and have a normal or 
low-grade cytology (i.e. negative or ASCUS or LSIL) at Month 0. In addition, subjects must be 
negative for HPV DNA (by PCR) at Months 0 and 6 for the corresponding HPV type considered in 
the analysis (i.e. HPV type associated with the efficacy endpoint). For this cohort, the follow-up time 
for a subject started at the day after Dose 3. For all stratified efficacy endpoints, the principal 
analysis is performed on subjects who were seronegative (by ELISA) prior to vaccination for the 
corresponding HPV type considered in the analysis. At the final analysis, the ATP cohort for 
efficacy will be the primary cohort for all endpoints, except for endpoints evaluated in HPV DNA 
positive woman at Month 0. 
According-to-protocol (ATP) cohort for analysis of immunogenicity 
The ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity includes all evaluable subjects (i.e. those meeting all 
eligibility criteria, complying with the procedures defined in the protocol, with no elimination 
criteria during the study) for whom data concerning immunogenicity endpoint measures are 
available. This includes subjects for whom assay results are available for antibodies against at least 
one study vaccine antigen component after vaccination. Subjects who acquire either HPV-16 or 
HPV-18 infection during the trial are excluded from the ATP cohort for immunogenicity.

Treatments 
The candidate HPV vaccine and hepatitis A control vaccine were administered (0.5 ml dose) 
intramuscularly into the deltoid of the non-dominant arm according to a 0, 1, 6-month schedule. 
For the immunogenicity subset blood samples were drawn from all subjects at Months 0, 7 and 24 
for HPV-16/18 serology testing by ELISA. Exit colposcopy was performed within 30 days after 
cytology results of the Month 48 visit depending on the cytological results. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of study HPV-008 was to demonstrate, that Cervarix protects individuals from 
histopathologically confirmed CIN2+ associated with HPV-16 or HPV-18 cervical infection detected 
within the lesional component of the cervical tissue specimen (by PCR), overall and stratified 
according to initial (Month 0) HPV-16 and/or 18 serostatus (by ELISA). CIN2+ is defined as CIN2, 
CIN3, adenocarcinoma in-situ (AIS) and invasive cervical cancer. 
Secondary objectives included the prevention of CIN 1, protection against persistent infection with 
HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 and the immunological response to vaccination. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint for the interim analysis was protection against CIN2+ lesions associated 
with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 among subjects who are negative for HPV DNA (by PCR) at 
baseline for the corresponding HPV type. 
Secondary Endpoints included  
-  Protection against persistent infection (6-month and 12-month definition) with HPV-16 or HPV-
18 among subjects who are negative for HPV DNA at baseline for the corresponding HPV type. 
-  Protection  against  persistent  infection  (6-month  definition)  with  the  following  oncogenic  HPV 
types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68.  
-  Protection against CIN2+ and CIN1+ associated with HPV-16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 
58, 59, 66 and 68. 
- 
Immune  response  in  a  subset  of  subjects  from  selected  study  sites  and  immune  correlates  of 
protection against persistent infection (presented under PD/Immunogenicity). 
Statistical methods 
Incidence rates and vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ associated with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 (by 
PCR) in HPV DNA negative and seronegative subjects at baseline have been calculated using the 
conditional exact method.

18644 subjects were vaccinated and included in the study, of whom 9319 subjects received the HPV 
vaccine (vaccine group) and 9325 subjects received the hepatitis A vaccine (control group). 
Of the 18644 vaccinated subjects in the study, 954 subjects withdrew from the study at the time of 
the interim analysis: 496 subjects in the vaccine group and 458 subjects in the control group (see 
table). The majority of these subjects (46.8%) were lost to follow-up (446 subjects), withdrew their 
consent not due to an adverse event (279 subjects), or migrated or moved from the study area (113 
subjects). Eight subjects withdrew due to a SAE (3 subjects in the vaccine group and 5 subjects in 
the control group). Nine subjects withdrew due to a non-serious AE (6 subjects in the vaccine group 
and 3 subjects in the control group). 
Recruitment 
The study initiation date was 06 May 2004. An event-triggered interim analysis was planned when at 
least 23 cases of CIN2+ with HPV-16 or HPV-18 DNA were detected in TVC-1. At the time of the 
interim analysis, the majority of subjects (N=13046) had completed their Month 18 visit. The interim 
analysis has been performed on 03 November 2006.

Conduct of the study 
Because potential study conduct and data integrity issues were identified at one study site, all 21 
subjects from this site were excluded from the analyses. Additionally, 64 subjects were randomized 
but not vaccinated. There were four amendments to the study protocol dated 12 March 2004.

The demographic profiles of both groups of subjects were comparable with respect to mean age, 
regional distribution, racial distribution, mean height and weight. The mean age was 20 years and the 
population was predominantly of Caucasian or East & South East Asian origin (54.8% and 23.3%, 
respectively). 
Overall, 29.8% of the subjects were identified as smokers, 92.2% of the subjects had less than three 
sexual partners during the past year, and 94.5% of the subjects were negative for Chlamydia. 
Regarding the HPV-16 status, 80.9% of the subjects were DNA negative and seronegative, 13.9% of 
the subjects were DNA negative and seropositive, 2.5% of the subjects were DNA positive and 
seronegative, and 2.8% of the subjects were DNA positive and seropositive. Regarding the HPV-18 
status, 87.2% of the subjects were DNA negative and seronegative, 10.5% of the subjects were DNA 
negative and seropositive, 1.3% of the subjects were DNA positive and seronegative, and 1% of the 
subjects were DNA positive and seropositive. 
Outcomes and estimation 
In study 008 the primary analyses of efficacy included only women who were HPV DNA negative 
and seronegative to the relevant HPV type (HPV 16 or HPV 18) prior to study entry and had 
received at least one dose of Cervarix or the control. Women with high-grade or missing cytology 
(0.6%) were excluded from the efficacy analysis. 
Overall, 74.0% of women enrolled were naïve to both HPV16 and HPV18 at study entry.  A total of 
22% of women enrolled into study 008 had abnormal low grade cytology and/or evidence of 
infection with an oncogenic HPV type at baseline. 
Histopathology 
Protection against CIN2+ associated with HPV-16/18 (primary endpoint) 
In the protocol-specified primary endpoint interim analysis, the observed vaccine efficacy (VE) 
against CIN2+ associated with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 was statistically significant (VE = 90.4% 
[53.4%, 99.3%], p<0.0001), i.e. 2 cases in the vaccine group vs. 21 cases in the control group. The 
observed vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ associated with HPV-16 alone was 93.3% [47%, 99.9%], 
i.e. 1 case in the vaccine group vs. 15 cases in the control group. The observed vaccine efficacy 
against CIN2+ associated with HPV-18 alone was not statistically significant 83.3% [-78.8%, 
99.9%] due to a limited number of events at the time of the analysis, i.e. 1 case in the vaccine group 
vs. 6 cases in the control group.

The regional distribution of the 23 cases of CIN2+ associated with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 was as 
follows: 7 cases in Asia Pacific (N=5368), 10 cases in Europe (N=5934), 1 case in Latin America 
(N=2164) and 5 cases in North America (N=2160). 
For this analysis, the association with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 was based only on the detection of 
viral DNA by PCR in the biopsy sample and did not consider whether or not the HPV-16 and/or 
HPV-18 detected was likely to be responsible for the development of the lesion. Other oncogenic 
HPV types were frequently detected in lesions and in some cases subjects had longstanding 
infections with the other type(s) detected. 
Therefore an additional post-hoc analysis was conducted to evaluate vaccine efficacy against lesions 
likely to be causally associated with HPV-16 and /or HPV-18. This post-hoc analysis (clinical case 
assignment) assigned causal association of an HPV type with the lesion based on the presence of the 
HPV type in cytology samples prior to detection of the lesion. Based on this case assignment, the 
analysis excluded 3 CIN2+ cases (2 in the vaccine group and 1 in the control group) which were not 
considered to be causally associated with HPV-16 or HPV-18 infections acquired during the trial. 
The following table therefore presents results of the clinical case assignment analysis. The observed 
vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ associated with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 was 100% [74.2%, 100%], 
i.e. 0 cases in the vaccine group vs. 20 cases in the control group. The observed efficacy against 
CIN2+ associated with HPV-16 alone was 100% [64.5%, 100%], i.e. 0 cases in the vaccine group vs. 
15 cases in the control group. The observed efficacy against CIN2+ associated with HPV-18 alone 
was 100% [-49.5%, 100%], i.e. 0 cases in the vaccine group vs. 5 cases in the control group. Since 
the majority of CIN2+ cases in the control group resulted from infections, which were first detected 
prior to completion of the full three-dose schedule, the absence of cases in the vaccine group reflects 
the onset of a vaccine effect prior to completion of the full vaccination course.

between the vaccine and control groups was not statistically significant  
However, in a pre-specified analysis (TVC-2) who’s cohort excluded women with abnormal 
cytology at study entry, the 12 month persistent infection endpoint for HPV 18 reached statistical 
significance with vaccine efficacy of 89.9% (97.9% CI: 11.3; 99.9). One case was observed in the

Study HPV-008 was designed to evaluate vaccine efficacy against 6 Month HPV-16/18 persistent 
infection as a secondary endpoint. 
Despite the presented results in the table above 6-month protection against persistence HPV 16 / 18 
infection is not accepted as a pre-defined endpoint and is therefore not considered in the assessment 
of efficacy. 
Protection against persistent infection (6-month definition) associated with HPV-16/18 regardless of 
their initial serostatus at baseline. 
The vaccine efficacy against persistent infection (6-month definition) with HPV-16 alone in HPV 
DNA negative subjects at baseline, regardless of their initial serostatus, was 81.1%; 95% CI; 0.5%, 
88.4%]. The efficacy against persistent infection with HPV-18 alone was 72.6% (95% CI; 49.3%, 
86.3%).  
Furthermore statistically significant protection against persistent infection (6-month) associated with 
oncogenic HPV types in HPV DNA negative subjects at baseline was observed for HPV-31, HPV-45 
and HPV-52 (VE = 36.1% (95% CI, 0.5%, 59.5%), 59.9% (95% CI, 2.6%, 85.2%) and 31.6% (95% 
CI, 3.5%, 51.9%), respectively). However, VE against 12-month persistent infection and CIN2+ did 
not reach statistical significance. There is currently no firm evidence for cross-protection against 
non-vaccine HPV types.

Ancillary analyses 
•  Clinical studies in special populations 
Currently no data in the male population has been provided.  
Supportive studies 
HPV-001 and HPV-007  
Study HPV-001 was a double-blind, randomised, controlled study conducted in 32 centres in the US, 
Canada and Brazil. The primary objective of Study HPV-001 was to evaluate vaccine efficacy 
against HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 incident infections which has not been an accepted endpoint for the 
demonstration of efficacy in the claimed indication. Main secondary objectives of the study were to 
evaluate vaccine efficacy against persistent infections, cytological abnormalities and 
histopathological lesions associated with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 or associated with other high-risk 
HPV types. The study also evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine. Study HPV-001 
is completed. 
Study HPV-007 is the extension of study HPV-001 and evaluates the long-term efficacy of the HPV-
16/18 vaccine in a subset of subjects (70 %) vaccinated in Study HPV-001 for an additional 36 
months. The maximum follow-up period in Study HPV-001 was 27 months. For all subjects, there 
was an interval between completion of Study HPV-001 and their first visit in Study HPV-007 (mean: 
14 months). In total, from the time of first vaccination in Study HPV-001 until their Month 24 visit 
in Study HPV-007, subjects have been evaluated for up to 64 months (i.e., 58 months after the third 
dose), with a mean follow-up period of 60 months (i.e., 54 months after the third dose). Study HPV-
007 is ongoing and interim data (a 24 months interim analysis, mean follow-up of 60 months after 
dose 1 administered in Study HPV-001) are presented. 
The design of Study HPV-007 closely follows that of Study HPV-001 to ensure consistency in 
collection of information on efficacy of the vaccine. 
Results 
Prophylactic efficacy against HPV-16/18 in a population naïve to oncogenic HPV types  
Women were vaccinated in study 001 and evaluated for efficacy up to month 27 and then a subset 
(N=776) was followed in study 007 up to 5.5 years after the first dose. The primary efficacy 
endpoint was incident infection with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18. Twelve-month persistent infection 
was evaluated as additional efficacy endpoint. There were five cases of 12-month persistent HPV-
16/18 infection (4 HPV-16; 1 HPV-18) in the control group and one HPV-16 case in the vaccine 
group in study 001. In study 007 the efficacy of Cervarix against 12-month persistent HPV-16/18 
infection was 100% (95% CI: 66.5; 100). There were ten cases of persistent HPV-16 infection, and 
four cases of persistent HPV-18 infection, all in the control group. 
•  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of Cervarix was assessed in two controlled, double-blind, randomised Phase II and III 
clinical trials that included a total of 19,778 women aged 15 to 25 years. 
The phase III trial (HPV-008) enrolled women regardless of baseline cytology and HPV serological 
and DNA status. The primary efficacy endpoint was CIN2+ associated with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18. 
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 and 3 was used in the clinical trials as a surrogate 
marker for cervical cancer. The secondary endpoints included 12-month persistent infection. 
The primary analyses of efficacy (TVC-1) included only women who were HPV DNA negative and 
seronegative to the relevant HPV type (HPV-16 or HPV-18) at study entry and had received at least 
one dose of Cervarix or the control (74.0% of women enrolled).  An interim analysis  with mean

follow-up 15 months was provided, however, the vaccine efficacy (ATP cohort post-dose 3) has not 
been evaluated in the primary efficacy population. 
For HPV-16 all endpoints reached statistical significance. For HPV-18, the difference between the 
vaccine and control groups was not statistically significant for CIN2+ and 12 month persistent 
infection, due to a limited number of events at the time of the analysis. However, in a pre-specified 
analysis (TVC-2) that excluded women with abnormal cytology at study entry, the 12 month 
persistent infection endpoint for HPV-18 reached statistical significance with vaccine efficacy of 
89.9% (97.9% CI: 11.3; 99.9).  
An additional post-hoc analysis was conducted to determine vaccine efficacy against lesions likely 
to be causally associated with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18. This post-hoc analysis (clinical case 
assignment) assigned causal association of an HPV type with the lesion based on the presence of the 
HPV type in cytology samples prior to detection of the lesion. Based on this case assignment, the 
analysis excluded 3 CIN2+ cases (2 in the vaccine group and 1 in the control group) which were not 
considered to be causally associated with HPV-16 or HPV-18 infections acquired during the trial. 
Based on this analysis there were no cases in the vaccine group and 20 cases in the control group 
(Efficacy 100%; 97.9% CI: 74.2, 100). 
The phase II trial (HPV-001/007) enrolled only women who were tested negative for 14 oncogenic 
HPV DNA types,  seronegative for HPV-16 and HPV-18 and had normal cytology. The primary 
efficacy endpoint was incident infection with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18. 
Women were vaccinated and evaluated for efficacy up to month 27 and then followed in study 007 
up to 5.5 years. There were five cases of 12-month persistent HPV-16/18 infection (4 HPV-16; 1 
HPV-18) in the control group and one HPV-16 case in the vaccine group. The efficacy of Cervarix 
against 12-month persistent HPV-16/18 infection was 100% (95% CI: 66.5; 100).  
There was no evidence of protection from disease caused by the HPV types for which subjects were 
HPV DNA positive at study entry. However, individuals already infected with one of the vaccine-
related HPV types prior to vaccination were protected from clinical disease caused by the remaining 
HPV type. 
The immunogenicity induced by three doses of Cervarix has been evaluated in 5,303 female 
subjects from 10 to 55 years of age. No minimal antibody level associated with protection against 
CIN of grade 2 or 3 or against persistent infection associated with vaccine HPV types has been 
identified for HPV vaccines.  
In clinical trials, 99.9% of initially seronegative subjects had seroconverted to both HPV types 16 
and 18 one month after the third dose. Vaccine-induced IgG Geometric Mean Titres were well above 
titres observed in women previously infected but who cleared HPV infection. Initially seropositive 
and seronegative subjects reached similar titres after vaccination. 
The phase II study (HPV-001/007) evaluated the immune response against HPV-16 and HPV-18 up 
to 64 months post dose 1. Vaccine-induced IgG Geometric Mean Titres for both HPV-16 and HPV-
18 peaked at month 7 and then declined to reach a plateau from month 18 up to the end of the 
follow-up (month 64). At the end of the follow-up period, GMTs for both HPV-16 and HPV-18 were 
still at least 11-fold higher than titres observed in women previously infected but who cleared HPV 
infection  and >98% of the women were still seropositive for both antigens.  
In subjects above 25 years of age in study 014 all subjects seroconverted to both HPV types 16 and 
18 after the third dose (at month 7). The GMTs were, however, lower in women above 25 years. 
Nevertheless, all subjects remained seropositive for both types throughout the follow-up phase (up to 
month 18) with GMTs that were still at least 9 fold higher than in subjects from a control group who 
had cleared an HPV infection (seropositive and PCR negative).  
In two clinical trials performed in girls and adolescents aged 10 to 14 years, all subjects 
seroconverted to both HPV types 16 and 18 after the third dose with GMTs at least 2-fold higher as 
compared to women aged 15 to 25 years. On the basis of these immunogenicity data, the efficacy of 
Cervarix is inferred from 10 to 14 years of age.

Clinical safety 
•  Patient exposure 
The safety information presented here is derived from the studies that were included in the pooled 
analysis of safety (HPV-003, 004, 005, 001, 007, 008, 012, 013, 014, 015 and 016 studies) as 
summarised in the following. The current pre-licensure safety database included females only.  
Of the 29,953 healthy girls and women included in the overall clinical development program of the 
HPV-16/18 vaccine candidate, 16,142 subjects have received at least one dose of HPV 16-18 vaccine 
and 13,811 subjects have received one of the control vaccines (Havrix 720, Havrix 360 or Al(OH)3. 
Subjects included in various clinical trials covered a broad age range, starting from 10 years of age 
onwards. The studies were conducted in Europe, Asia Pacific, North and Latin America and 
consequently included a range of ethnicities, including subjects of Caucasian, Hispanic, Black and 
Asian origin. 
All women and girls enrolled in the trials were to be free of obvious health problems based on 
medical history and clinical examination and had to have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to 
administration of each vaccine dose.

The current safety database allows for the detection of rare adverse events and vaccine-related rare 
events compared with the reporting of events in the control groups. Studies that were pooled had 
similar study designs with respect to vaccination schedule and methods of determination and capture 
of adverse events. Long-term follow-up data is available from studies HPV-001/007 (5.5 years), 
HPV-008 (approximately Month 24 for some subjects), HPV-013 (Month 18) and HPV-014 (Month 
18). 
•  Adverse events  
The following endpoints were evaluated in clinical studies: 
Solicited symptoms: Occurrence of solicited local (injection site pain, redness and swelling) or 
general symptom (fatigue, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea 
and/or abdominal pain), headache, rash, pruritus, myalgia, arthralgia and urticaria, (within 7 days 
(Day 0-6) after each vaccination) 
o  Unsolicited symptoms: Occurrence of unsolicited symptoms within 30 days 
(Day 0-29) following each vaccination. 
o  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs): Occurrence of SAEs following vaccination. 
o  New Onset of Chronic Disease (NOCD)/ New Onset of Autoimmune Disease 
(NOAD)  
•  Medically Significant Conditions: Occurrence of medically significant 
conditions (MSCs) throughout the study period, regardless of causal relationship 
to vaccination and intensity. 
•  Pregnancies: Occurrence of pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes. 
The following Adverse Reactions are reflected in the SPC (section 4.8)  
Adverse reactions considered as being at least possibly related to vaccination have been categorised 
by frequency. Frequencies are reported as very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10) and 
uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100). 
The most common adverse reaction observed after vaccine administration was injection site pain 
which occurred after 78% of all doses. The majority of these reactions were of mild to moderate 
severity and were not long lasting. 
Nervous system disorders: 
Very common: headache 
Uncommon: dizziness 
Gastrointestinal disorders: 
Common: gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: 
Common: itching/pruritus, rash, urticaria 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: 
Very common: myalgia 
Common: arthralgia 
Infections and infestations: 
Uncommon: upper respiratory tract infection 
General disorders and administration site conditions: 
Very common: injection site reactions including pain, redness, swelling; fatigue 
Common: fever (≥38°C) 
Uncommon: other injection site reactions such as induration, local paraesthesia

A similar safety profile has been observed in subjects with prior or current HPV infection as 
compared to subjects negative for oncogenic HPV DNA or seronegative for HPV-16 and HPV-18 
antibodies. 
Assessment of the Safety data set:   
The overall incidences for each of the three local symptoms were higher in the HPV group compared 
to the control groups. The most frequently reported solicited local 
symptoms reported was pain (reported following 78.0% of HPV, 52.5% of ALU, 41.3% of HAV360 
and 58.9% of HAV720 doses). Most of the pain was mild to moderate in intensity, and grade 3 pain 
was reported following 6.3% of HPV doses. There was a slight increase in the incidence of redness 
and swelling with subsequent doses. Grade 3 redness and swelling occurred at low frequencies. 
Reporting rates of fever and particularly urticaria within 30 minutes after vaccination were 
consistently low whereas reporting rates of rash or itching were common but similar between the 
HPV-16/18 vaccine group and the control groups. 
Fatigue, headache and myalgia were the most frequently reported solicited general symptoms. There 
were no differences in the percentages of doses followed by any or grade 3 fatigue, gastrointestinal 
symptoms and headache between the HPV vaccine group and the HAV720 vaccine group. The 
incidence of grade 3 symptoms did not increase with subsequent doses. 
There was a slightly higher incidence of arthralgia in the HPV group when compared to the control 
HAV720 vaccine (reported after 10.2% (95% CI [9.8; 10.6]) of HPV doses versus 8.6% (95% CI 
[8.0; 9.2]) of HAV doses). There were no differences in the percentages of doses followed by grade 3 
arthralgia between the HPV vaccine group and the HAV720 vaccine group. The incidences of grade 
3 symptoms did not increase with subsequent doses. 
There was a slightly higher incidence of myalgia in the HPV group when compared to the HAV720 
control vaccine (reported after 28.1% (95% CI [27.5; 28.7]) of HPV doses versus 26.5% (95% CI 
[25.6; 27.5]) of HAV doses). Grade 3 myalgia also occurred more frequently in the HPV group and 
was reported after 1.4% (95%CI [1.3; 1.6]) of HPV vaccine doses as compared to 0.2% (95% CI 
[0.1; 0.5]) of ALU, 0.5% (95% CI [0.3; 0.8]) of HAV360 and 0.6% (95% CI [0.4; 0.8]) of HAV720 
doses (see following Table) . There was no significant increase of grade 3 myalgia with subsequent 
doses (1.3%, 1.1% and 1.7% following dose 1, dose 2 and dose 3 of HPV vaccine, respectively).

Data Source = Pooled safety analysis 
For an additional evaluation of the incidence of myalgia and arthralgia, the safety data collected from 
the large controlled efficacy trial HPV-008 (conducted in subjects aged 15 to 25 years) were also 
reviewed. Although there was a slightly higher percentage of HPV doses followed by arthralgia, 
myalgia and grade 3 myalgia when compared to the HAV720 control, these symptoms were of short 
duration, not associated with other symptoms that may evoke a general disease associated with 
arthralgia/myalgia, and did not result in a high level of absenteeism from work or school. 
•  Serious adverse events 
All reports of serious adverse events and case fatalities in studies HPV-003, HPV-004, HPV-005, 
HPV-001, HPV-007, HPV-008, HPV-012, HPV-013, HPV-014, HPV-015 and HPV-016 were 
included in the analysis. From a total of 29,953 subjects vaccinated in these studies, 882 subjects 
reported at least one SAE during the entire follow up period (see table below). There was no 
difference on the overall reporting rates of SAEs during the different follow-up periods.

Data source = Pooled safety analysis 
A total of 27 subjects reported SAEs assessed by the investigator as possibly related to vaccination. 
From these, 11 subjects received HPV-16/18 vaccine, 13 subjects received the control vaccine (either 
Aluminium or HAV) and 3 subjects received a blinded vaccine. Overall, the most frequently reported 
SAEs were pregnancy-related events: spontaneous abortions (2 HPV; 2 HAV; 3 ALU) and 2 foetal 
malformations (2 HAV). Five reported events were considered as potentially immune mediated 
(optic neuritis, thrombocytopenia, erythema nodosum, inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis 
reactive). 
•  Laboratory findings 
Blood samples were collected to evaluate changes in biochemical and haematological parameters. 
For all studies where these parameters were evaluated, the haematology and biochemistry profiles 
were similar for all groups and there were no values out of range that were considered to be 
clinically significant.

•  Safety in special populations 
Regardless of serological HPV status, HPV DNA status or previous/current HPV disease status the 
incidence of solicited symptoms was closely aligned to that observed in HPV DNA negative and 
HPV seronegative subjects and to the one observed in the overall population (Pooled Total 
Vaccinated Cohort). 
The pooled safety analysis for studies HPV-012, 013 and 014 was stratified according to age. A 
slight decrease in the reactogenicity profile of the HPV-16/18 vaccine with increasing age was 
observed.  
Pregnancy 
A total of 1,737 pregnancies have been reported over the entire follow-up period for completed or 
ongoing clinical studies (see following Table for details). A total of 503 pregnancies (29%) are still 
ongoing. The majority of pregnancies were reported in subjects between 15 to 25 years of age, i.e., 
the age group where the largest clinical study, HPV-008, is currently ongoing in more than 18,000 
subjects.  Of these 1,737 pregnancies, 769 (44.3%) resulted in the delivery of a normal infant, 210 
(12.1%) pregnancies were terminated by an elective abortion and 155 (8.9%) resulted in a 
spontaneous abortion. Of note, the rates of spontaneous abortion (8.9%) from this analysis are below 
reported background rates of spontaneous abortion in the general population. Literature reviews 
show a range from 12-15% for clinically recognised pregnancies and from 17-22% for early 
pregnancy losses which may be defined as pregnancy losses within 14 days after conception, around 
the next menstruation, and which could be confused with menstrual bleeding . 
In addition, a total of six stillbirths occurred, five of which were in women whose treatment status 
remains blinded (i.e., these subjects received either the HPV-16/18 vaccine or the HAV720 control 
vaccine). 
When comparing the pregnancy outcomes per treatment group, there were no major differences in 
the rates of any specific pregnancy outcome between the HPV-16/18 vaccine group and the control 
groups. The rate of abnormal infants in the HPV-16/18 group was lower than the control group 
HAV720.  
Concerning abnormal infants information available so far show that from the 18 reported pregnancy 
cases (6 in the HPV group, 4 in the ALU group and 8 in the HAV720 group), no cluster of events 
was identified. Nine pregnancies resulted in 11 neonatal deaths. Five of these deaths were related to 
prematurity. The remaining 6 neonatal deaths were related to respiratory distress syndromes (2 
cases), aspiration pneumonia, intracranial haemorrhage, polycystic kidney disease with 
anhydramnios or gastrochisis.

Data source = Pooled safety analysis 
A secondary analysis of pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes was conducted that focused on 
pregnancies in women for which their last menstrual period (LMP) occurred from -30 days to +45 
days around vaccination. These pregnancies occurred despite the fact that subjects were strongly 
advised (through the informed consent process) to take precautions to avoid pregnancy until 2 
months after the last vaccination, and that pregnancy testing was conducted prior to vaccination.  
A total of 415 subjects reported pregnancies around vaccination (defined as LMP initiated from -30 
days to +45 days around vaccination). 57.3% of subjects gave birth to normal infants, 16.1% of 
pregnancies resulted in elective abortion and 8.9% resulted in spontaneous abortion, whereas 9.4% 
of pregnancies are still ongoing. Except for a slight increase in the proportion of elective abortions, 
these rates are comparable to the outcome rates for all pregnancies. A total of 7 women delivered an 
abnormal infant. Outcomes in one of the control groups (HAV720), was observed when compared to 
the HPV group (5 in HAV720 group and 2 in HPV group). No reports of abnormal infants were 
received in the ALU and HAV360 control groups. 
When comparing the outcomes between treatment groups, an imbalance with higher rates of 
spontaneous abortion was observed in the HPV group compared to the HAV720 group (11.0% 
versus 5.7%). This imbalance was not observed between the HPV group and the ALU group (11.0% 
versus 13.8%).

To further evaluate this observed imbalance, the ongoing study HPV-009 was also analysed in this 
respect.While cases of any abnormal pregnancy outcome experienced by a subject whose last 
menstrual period (LMP) occurred within 60 days of vaccination was unblinded the overall number of 
pregnancies per group are not available from study 009 since these pregnancies are still blinded and, 
contrary to study HPV-008, an interim analysis is not foreseen. Only the absolute numbers and not 
the rates of pregnancy  outcomes can therefore be compared between the treatment groups. Therefore 
it is currently unknown whether the number of pregnancies would be comparable in the two 
treatment groups. 
The observed imbalance in study HPV-008 appears to be mostly concentrated in the group of women 
who had their LMP within 30 days before vaccination. In study HPV-009 a similar, albeit smaller, 
imbalance is seen. The reported frequencies of spontaneous abortions following HPV-16/18 vaccine 
administration among women whose pregnancy occurred around vaccination can be  considered 
close to the lower limit (12-22%) of the range of background incidence rates of spontaneous abortion 
reported in the medical literature . 
Several studies, including the large study HPV-008, are still ongoing and further follow-up will be 
collected on all pregnancies occurring among women in these studies. Close monitoring of 
pregnancy-related events is covered post-licensure (see RMP).  
The effect on breast-fed infants of the administration of Cervarix to their mothers has not been 
evaluated in clinical studies. 
Cervarix should only be used during breast-feeding when the possible advantages outweigh the 
possible risks.

•  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In Studies HPV-001, 012, 013 and 014 the use of medication, including anti-pyretic medication, was 
recorded. Overall, no major differences concerning use of anti-pyretics was observed.  
•  Discontinuation due to adverse events/deaths 
The number of subjects vaccinated, completed and withdrawn with the reasons for 
withdrawal are summarised in the table below. A total of 55 subjects were withdrawn from the 
study due to serious or non-serious adverse events (including 33 subjects in the HPV- 
16/18 vaccine group) as described below: 
Five case fatalities were reported in the overall HPV clinical development. None of these were 
assessed by the investigator as possibly related to vaccination. Two case fatalities were associated 
with motor vehicle accidents. One case fatality was associated with homicide. The remaining 2 cases 
refer to dead due to osteosarcoma complications and ketoacidosis due to diabetes. 
In addition to the 5 case fatalities described above, 13 foetal deaths were also reported to 
the Company as pregnancy outcomes. These cases were kept blinded as they were 
reported from studies that are currently ongoing. Although these case fatalities remain blinded, no 
safety signal has been identified based on the description of these events.

New Onset of Chronic Disease (NOCD) 
New onset chronic diseases (NOCD) were reported throughout the study periods regardless of causal 
relationship to vaccination and intensity. All adverse events reported during the trial were compared 
with a pre-defined list of symptoms/conditions that may evoke chronic diseases. The number of 
subjects experiencing an NOCD was similar between HPV vaccine and the control groups in any 
given reporting period (see following table). 
The most commonly reported NOCD were asthma, urticaria and hypersensitivity, which were each 
reported at similar frequencies in the HPV vaccine and control groups.

New Onset of Autoimmune Disease (NOAD) 
Overall, the reporting rates of NOAD were low and no cluster of events has been detected in any 
treatment group. The most frequently reported events were related to thyroid disease as would be 
expected based on the background incidence rates of thyroid disease in young female population. No 
clear difference in the reported rates of thyroid disease between treatment groups in any of the 
follow-up periods has been observed to date. No cluster in terms of either time to onset of AEs and 
number of doses has been observed. The other events were kept blinded as most of these events have 
been reported only once. The low frequency of autoimmune diseases constitutes a limitation of their 
assessment in the clinical program. Therefore, they will be further evaluated in ongoing and the 
planned post-licensure activities.  
Seven cases of neurological disorders (five cases in the HPV group and two in the control group) 
have been identified. These cases appear to be isolated events. Final diagnoses are unclear for 3 
cases. The time to onset varies between 9 days to 7 months. Thus, no cluster in terms of either time 
to onset of AEs and number of doses has been observed.  Considering the safety database and the age 
of the target population, the adverse events might be explained just by chance. The cases do not 
indicate an increased risk for demyelinating disease or nerve disorders. Autoimmune diseases 
including demyelinating neurological diseases as well as neurological diseases are addressed in the 
RMP.  
•  Discussion on clinical safety 
The most frequently reported solicited symptoms after administration of the HPV-16/18 L1 VLP 
AS04 vaccine were injection site reactions including pain, redness and swelling, all reported more 
frequently in the HPV group as compared to the control groups. Solicited general symptoms were 
reported less frequently than local symptoms after vaccination. Among these, myalgia and arthralgia 
were reported more frequently in the HPV-16/18 vaccine group as compared to control groups. The 
majority of the reports were of low grade intensity and the symptoms were transient, not associated 
with any general disease and resolved without sequelae.  
There was no clinically meaningful increase of symptoms with increasing number of doses. The 
majority of the solicited local and general symptoms reported were mild to moderate in intensity, and 
usually resolved within 3 or 4 days after vaccination.  
Compliance with the full vaccination course was equally high in both HPV-16/18 vaccine and 
control groups, suggesting that the higher rates of local and general symptoms following HPV-16/18 
50 
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vaccine did not negatively impact tolerability or acceptance of the vaccination treatment.  There were 
no unusually high rates of occurrence of unsolicited adverse events, and there was no evidence that 
any unsolicited adverse event occurred more frequently in the HPV-16/18 vaccine group than in 
control groups. Separate analysis of NOAD revealed no clear trend or cluster, although as the 
incidence rates of autoimmune diseases are low, further post-marketing evaluation is necessary to 
fully assess the issue. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were low and similar between 
groups. 
The impact on pregnancy and pregnancy outcome could not be fully analysed at the time of 
assessment, since most of the pregnancies were ongoing and/or remained blinded concerning 
allocation to vaccine. Use of contraceptives was required per protocol for the period during the 
vaccination period and therefore, there is currently no robust data available on the use of Cervarix in 
pregnant women. A slight imbalance of spontaneous abortions in study HPV-008 was mostly 
observed in the group of women who had their LMP within 30 days before vaccination.  
The reported frequencies of spontaneous abortions following HPV-16/18 vaccine administration 
among women whose pregnancy occurred around vaccination can be considered close to the lower 
limit (12-22%) of the range of background incidence rates of spontaneous abortion reported in the 
medical literature. However, vaccination should be postponed until after completion of pregnancy. 
Close monitoring of pregnancy-related events is covered postlicensure (see RMP). 
The reporting rates of New Onset of Autoimmune Disease (NOAD) were low. No cluster in terms of 
either time to onset of AEs and number of doses has been observed.  A review of the cases and 
analyses from the overall database do not indicate an increased risk for demyelinating disease or 
nerve disorders. Autoimmune diseases including demyelinating neurological diseases as well as 
neurological inflammatory disorders are addressed in the RMP.

Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
During the evaluation of Cervarix, no major objections were identified. A number of minor concerns 
were raised in regard to the novel insect cell production system and these have been adequately 
addressed, however several commitments have been made by the applicant, and several follow-up 
measures defined to provide further information post-approval. In conclusion, all quality issues can 
be considered resolved.

No animal model exists for human papilloma virus infection. Consequently Cervarix has not been 
tested for protection. Pharmacology studies in animals show that MPL induces innate immunity and 
showed no induction of undesirable pharmacological effects on cardio-respiratory functions.  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies in mice and monkeys show that the activation of the innate 
immunity by AS04 is paralleled by the induction of a strong and persistent specific immune response 
by the Cervarix vaccine. Safety pharmacology studies on cardio-respiratory functions showed no 
undesirable pharmacological effects with Cervarix. 
Studies on secondary pharmacology or pharmacodynamic drug interactions have not been 
performed, which is acceptable for this vaccine. 
Two studies targeting the determination of the pharmacokinetics of MPL-related material following 
intravenous and intramuscular administration in rats were carried out. The MPL-related material is 
widely distributed throughout the body, notably in the fat and spleen, and is then likely eliminated 
via the expired air with only low levels remaining in the carcass. 
Signs of inflammation at the injection sites of the test vaccine were observed. These injection site 
reactions were local and followed by a recovery process. This local effect is most likely the sign of 
the strong adjuvant effect induced by AS04. Furthermore, up to three times the full human dosage 
was used in the rabbit studies, probably amplifying this local reaction. The injection site reaction was 
accompanied with a temporary increase in the number of neutrophils and in fibrinogen, which may 
be a consequence of the recruitment of inflammatory cells following injections of the formulations. 
In vitro mutagenicity and clastogenicity tests, and in vivo micronucleus assay demonstrated no 
genotoxic potential of the MPL adjuvant. The mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of the Cervarix 
vaccine was not further evaluated, which is accepted since the vaccine is based on L1 protein and 
HPV oncoproteins are absent. 
The reproductive toxicity study in CD rats did not show any effects of vaccination or AS04 
administration on fertility, embryofoetal development and pre- and post-natal development. 
Antibodies from vaccinated dams cross the placenta and are secreted in the milk.  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, fertility, embryo-foetal and 
postnatal toxicity (up to the end of the lactation period). 
Efficacy 
The efficacy of Cervarix was assessed in two controlled, double-blind, randomised Phase II and III 
clinical trials that included a total of 19,778 women aged 15 to 25 years. 
Endpoints included CIN2+ associated with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 and 12-month persistent 
infection. 
For HPV-16 all endpoints reached statistical significance.  
For HPV-18, the difference between the vaccine and control groups was not statistically significant 
for CIN2+ and 12-month persistent infection due to a limited number of events at the time of the 
analysis. However, in a pre-specified analysis that excluded women with abnormal cytology at study 
entry, the 12-month persistent infection endpoint for HPV-18 reached statistical significance with 
vaccine efficacy of 89.9% (97.9% CI: 11.3; 99.9).  
An additional post-hoc analysis based on the presence of the HPV type in cytology samples prior to 
detection of the lesion excluded 3 CIN2+ cases which were not considered to be causally associated 
with HPV-16 or HPV-18 infections acquired during the trial. Based on this analysis there were no 
cases in the vaccine group and 20 cases in the control group (Efficacy 100%; 97.9% CI: 74.2, 100). 
There was no evidence of protection from disease caused by the HPV types for which subjects were 
HPV DNA positive at study entry. However, individuals already infected with one of the vaccine-
53 
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
related HPV types prior to vaccination were protected from clinical disease caused by the remaining 
HPV type. 
In clinical trials assessing immunogenicity, 99.9% of initially seronegative subjects had 
seroconverted to both HPV types 16 and 18 one month after the third dose. Vaccine-induced IgG 
Geometric Mean Titres were well above titres observed in women previously infected but who 
cleared HPV infection. Initially seropositive and seronegative subjects reached similar titres after 
vaccination. 
Study HPV-014 demonstrated, that seropositivity with regard to HPV 16 and 18 at the time of 
vaccination has some marginal positive influence on the kinetics of the immune response as well as 
on final GMTs and is more pronounced in older individuals compared to those who are younger: 
Whether or not vaccination of a seropositive female population has any effect on clinical efficacy of 
Cervarix cannot be assessed for the time being. 
In two further clinical trials performed in girls and adolescents aged 10 to 14 years, all subjects 
seroconverted to both HPV types 16 and 18 after the third dose with GMTs at least 2-fold higher as 
compared to women aged 15 to 25 years. On the basis of these immunogenicity data, the efficacy of 
Cervarix is inferred from 10 to 14 years of age. 
Safety 
The most frequently reported solicited symptoms after administration of the HPV-16/18 L1 VLP 
AS04 vaccine were injection site reactions including pain, redness and swelling, headache, myalgia 
and arthralgia. Solicited general symptoms were reported less frequently than local symptoms after 
vaccination. The majority were of low grade intensity and the symptoms were transient and resolved 
without sequelae.  
There was no clinically meaningful increase of symptoms with increasing number of doses. No 
unusually high rates of occurrence of unsolicited adverse events, and no evidence that any 
unsolicited adverse event occurred more frequently in the HPV-16/18 vaccine group than in control 
groups were observed. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were low and similar between 
groups. 
The impact on pregnancy and pregnancy outcome could not be fully analysed at the time of 
assessment, since most of the pregnancies were ongoing and/or remained blinded concerning 
allocation to vaccine. A slight imbalance of spontaneous abortions in study HPV-008 was mostly 
observed in the group of women who had their LMP within 30 days before vaccination.  
The reported frequencies of spontaneous abortions following HPV-16/18 vaccine administration 
among women whose pregnancy occurred around vaccination can be considered close to the lower 
limit (12-22%) of the range of background incidence rates of spontaneous abortion reported in the 
medical literature. However, vaccination should be postponed until after completion of pregnancy. 
Close monitoring of pregnancy-related events is covered post authorisation (see RMP). 
The effect on breast-fed infants of the administration of Cervarix to their mothers has not been 
evaluated in clinical studies. Cervarix should only be used during breast-feeding when the possible 
advantages outweigh the possible risks. 
Administration of Cervarix should be postponed in subjects suffering from an acute severe febrile 
illness. However, the presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, is not a contraindication for 
immunisation. 
The reporting rates of New Onset of Autoimmune Disease (NOAD) were low. Seven cases of 
neurological disorders were of particular interest (five cases  in the HPV group and two in the control 
group). The cases appear to be isolated events and no cluster in terms of either time to onset of AEs 
and number of doses has been observed. The cases do not indicate an increased risk for 
54 
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
demyelinating disease or nerve disorders. Autoimmune diseases including demyelinating 
neurological diseases as well as neurological inflammatory disorders are addressed in the RMP. 
Cervarix should not be used in case of hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the 
excipients.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the 
proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these. 
•  User consultation 
A user consultation has been performed and was considered to be satisfactory. 
Risk-benefit assessment 
The benefits of Cervarix are currently based on 2 controlled, double-blind, randomised Phase II and 
III clinical studies. Both trials are still ongoing and continue to generate data on both efficacy and 
safety. Data is available from studies HPV-001/007 (5.5 years) and HPV-008 (mean follow-up 15 
months). The phase III interim analysis was event driven. 
The primary efficacy composite endpoint, protection against CIN2+ associated with the HPV-16/18, 
was met.  
Other composite HPV-16/18 endpoints (6-months and 12-months persistence, CIN1+ and ASCUS+) 
were also statistically significant but not considered for the demonstration of efficacy against 
cervical cancer.  
For HPV-16 all endpoints reached statistical significance. For HPV 18 the difference between the 
vaccine and control groups was not statistically significant for CIN 2+ and 12-month persistent 
infection. However, in a pre-specified analysis that excluded women with abnormal cytology at 
study entry, the 12-month persistent infection endpoint for HPV-18 also reached statistical 
significance. 
The safety profile of Cervarix was comparable to the control groups. No clear evidence for a serious 
safety risk has been identified. 
Taking all of the data into consideration the benefits of Cervarix outweighs the risks and the 
risk/benefit ratio is positive.  
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of 
the opinion that:  
•  pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed 
to investigate further some of the safety concerns. 
•  no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information.

Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Cervarix in  
The prevention of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN grades 2 and 3) and 
cervical cancer causally related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18.  
The indication is based on demonstration of efficacy in women aged 15-25 years following 
vaccination with Cervarix and on the immunogenicity of the vaccine in girls and women aged 
10-25 years.  
See section 5.1 for information on the evidence that supports the efficacy of Cervarix in 
prevention of CIN grades 2 and 3 associated with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18.

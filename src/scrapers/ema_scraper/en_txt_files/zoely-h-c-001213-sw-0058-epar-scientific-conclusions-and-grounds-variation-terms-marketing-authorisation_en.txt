Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report for the non-interventional imposed PASS final 
study report for the medicinal product(s) mentioned above, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are 
as follows:  
The study eliminated a 1.5-fold risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) for NOMAC-E2 
(nomegestrol acetate/estradiol) compared to COCLNG (combined hormonal contraceptive 
containing levonorgestrel). The results of the study show that nomegestrol acetate/estradiol (Zoely) 
may have a risk of VTE in the same range as observed with COCLNG. Therefore, in view of 
available data regarding the PASS final study report, the PRAC considers that changes to the 
product information are warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for the results of the study for the medicinal product(s) 
mentioned above, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of these medicinal 
product(s) is unchanged, subject to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) of the medicinal 
product(s) mentioned above should be varied.

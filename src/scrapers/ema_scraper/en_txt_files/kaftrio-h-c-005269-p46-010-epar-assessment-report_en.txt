1.  Introduction 
On January 13th 2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Kaftrio, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Kaftrio is currently indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic fibrosis 
(CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Kaftrio obtained initially a marketing authorization 
in patients aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or heterozygous for F508del in the CFTR gene with 
a minimal function (MF) mutation in 2020. In 2021, the indication was extended to patients aged 12 
years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Recently, the indication was extended to children with CF aged 6 
years through 11.  
Elexacaftor and tezacaftor are CFTR correctors and facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking of 
F508del-CFTR, leading to an increase in the amount of CFTR protein, while ivacaftor increases channel 
gating of the CFTR protein at the cell surface. The combined effect of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and 
ivacaftor results in increased CFTR activity as measured by CFTR chloride transport. 
Within this procedure, the MAH submitted final study results of Study VX19-445-117, a Phase 3b, 
open-label study in CF subjects 12 years of age and older, heterozygous for F508del and a minimal 
function mutation (F/MF genotypes), with abnormal glucose tolerance. The MAH stated that Study 
VX19-445-117 is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
In Study VX19-445-117, the study drug was administered orally as 2 ELX 100 mg/TEZ 50 mg/IVA 75 
mg tablets in the morning and 1 tablet of IVA 150 mg in the evening. This pharmaceutical formulation 
and posology are authorized for patients aged 6 and older, weighing 30 kg or more and thereby also 
for the study population aged 12 years and older.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
Study VX19-445-117 (Study 117) was a Phase 3b, open-label study in CF subjects 12 years of 
age and older, heterozygous for F508del and a minimal function mutation (F/MF genotypes), with 
abnormal glucose tolerance.

Table 1. Key eligibility criteria Study 117 
Treatments 
Study drug tablets were administered orally as ELX 200 mg qd/TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h.  
Patients received 2 ELX 100 mg/TEZ 50 mg/IVA 75 mg tablets in the morning and 1 tablet of IVA 150 
mg in the evening. Study drug was administered within approximately 30 minutes of consumption of a 
fat-containing meal or snack. 
During the Treatment Period, patients were to be administered ELX/TEZ/IVA for approximately 48 
weeks. 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of ELX/TEZ/IVA on glucose tolerance in CF subjects 
with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or CF-related diabetes (CFRD). 
The secondary objective was to evaluate safety and tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The change from baseline in 2-hour blood glucose levels following an oral glucose tolerance test 
(OGTT) to the average of Week 36 and Week 48.

Secondary endpoints 
- 
Proportion of subjects with improvement in dysglycaemia categorization (CFRD, IGT, normal 
glucose tolerance [NGT]) at Week 48. 
-  Safety and tolerability of ELX/TEZ/IVA based on adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory 
values, ECGs, vital signs, and pulse oximetry. 
Other endpoints 
-  Change from baseline in sweat chloride (SwCl) through Week 48 
-  Absolute change in body mass index (BMI) from baseline at Week 48 
-  Absolute change in body weight from baseline at Week 48 
-  Change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fructosamine at Week 48 
-  Change from baseline in insulin use (dose) at Week 48 in subjects using insulin 
-  Change from baseline in post-OGTT diabetes-related biomarkers (including insulin, C-peptide, 
glucagon, calculated indices of insulin secretion [insulinogenic index], and insulin resistance 
[HOMA-IR]) at Week 48 
-  Change from baseline in biomarkers of inflammation (including C-reactive protein [CRP]) at 
Week 48 
-  Change from baseline in biomarkers of pancreatic function (including fecal elastase-1 [FE-1] 
and serum immunoreactive trypsinogen [IRT]) at Week 48 
-  Change from baseline in post-OGTT incretin levels (including glucagon-like peptide 1 [GLP-1] 
and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide [GIP]) at Week 48 
-  Change from baseline in percent of time spent in target blood glucose range of ≥70 to <140 
mg/dL (≥3.89 to <7.77 mmol/L) as measured by 7-day continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) 
in subjects with CFRD at Week 48 
-  Change from baseline in selected continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) parameters (including 
but not limited to percent of time spent between ≥140 and <200 mg/dL [≥7.77 and <11.10 
mmol/L], percent of time spent ≥200 mg/dL [≥11.10 mmol/L], and mean amplitude of 
glycemic excursion* [MAGE]) in subjects with CFRD at Week 48 
*Note: definition corrected for MAGE (originally defined as maximum amplitude of glucose excursions 
in the study protocol). 
Sample size 
Assuming a within group standard deviation (SD) of 45 mg/dL and a 10% dropout rate at Week 48, a 
sample size of 60 subjects was considered to have more than 95% power to detect a mean decrease 
from baseline of -30 mg/dL in 2-hour blood glucose levels post-OGTT to the average of Week 36 and 
Week 48, based on a 2-sided, 1-sample t-test at a significance level of 0.05. 
Therefore, approximately 60 subjects (F/MF genotypes) were planned to be enrolled, of whom 
approximately 30 subjects with IGT, and 30 subjects with CFRD. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Not applicable, as this is an open-label single arm trial.

Statistical Methods 
Analysis sets 
All Subjects Set - all subjects who were enrolled. This analysis set was used for all individual subject 
data listings and disposition summary tables, unless otherwise specified. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS) - all enrolled subjects who carry the intended CFTR allele mutation and have 
received at least 1 dose of study drug. The FAS was used to summarize subject demographics and 
baseline characteristics, and for analyses of all efficacy endpoints, unless otherwise specified. 
Safety Set - all subjects who have received at least 1 dose of study drug. The Safety Set was used for 
all safety analyses. 
Efficacy analyses 
The primary null hypothesis to be tested was that the mean change from baseline in 2-hour blood 
glucose levels following OGTT to the average of Week 36 and Week 48 is equal to zero. 
OGTT results were considered valid only when the subject was fasting for at least 8 hours. Any non-
fasting OGTT results were disregarded and data for that assessment was considered missing. 
The primary analysis was performed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with 
the change from baseline in 2-hour post-OGTT blood glucose levels at each post-baseline visit as the 
dependent variable. The primary result obtained from the model was the estimated change from 
baseline to the average of Week 36 and Week 48. Data obtained from Week 24, Week 36, and Week 
48 visits were included in the model. The least square (LS) mean estimate along with the 
corresponding 2-sided 95% CI and probability (P) value were provided. The LS mean change from 
baseline at each post-baseline visit with 95% CI, obtained from the model, were also provided. 
Furthermore, the LS mean change from baseline (with SE) at each post-baseline visit, obtained from 
the model, was plotted. 
In addition, the post-baseline raw values and the change from baseline at each post-baseline visit up 
to Week 48 were summarized descriptively (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum). 
For the secondary endpoint, improvement in dysglycaemia categorization, abnormal or normal glucose 
tolerance (NGT) as determined by an OGTT, were classified as either: 
-  CFRD: 2-hour post-OGTT blood glucose level ≥200 mg/dL (≥11.10 mmol/L) or fasting 
hyperglycemia (blood glucose level ≥126 mg/dL [≥7.00 mmol/L] after an 8-hour fast) 
- 
IGT: 2-hour post-OGTT blood glucose level ≥140 to <200 mg/dL (≥7.77 to <11.10 mmol/L) and 
fasting blood glucose level <126 mg/dL (<7.00 mmol/L) 
-  NGT: 2-hour post-OGTT blood glucose level <140 mg/dL (<7.77 mmol/L) and fasting blood 
glucose level <126 mg/dL (<7.00 mmol/L) 
Improvement in dysglycaemia categorization: response at Week 48 compared to baseline (i.e., CFRD 
at baseline to IGT or NGT at Week 48, or IGT at baseline to NGT at Week 48 OGTT). 
The number and proportion of subjects with and without response at Week 48, defined as 
improvement from baseline dysglycaemia categorization (i.e., CFRD at baseline to IGT or NGT based 
on Week 48 OGTT measurement, and IGT at baseline to NGT based on Week 48 OGTT measurement), 
were presented for patients with abnormal glucose (CFRD or IGT) at baseline. The exact, 2-sided 95% 
Clopper-Pearson CI of the proportion of subjects with improvement was also presented. In addition, 
the number and proportion of subjects in each dysglycaemia category at baseline and each post-
baseline visit were presented.

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 69 patients enrolled and received at least 1 dose of study drug, and 66 (95.7%) patients 
completed study drug treatment (Table 2). Three (4.3%) patients discontinued treatment: 2 due to 
commercial drug availability and 1 due to physician decision.

Recruitment 
Study initiation: 15 January 2021 (date first eligible subject signed the informed consent form) 
Study completion: 14 July 2022 (date last subject completed the last visit) 
The study was conducted at 38 sites in Australia and the EU. 
Conduct of study 
Protocol amendments 
The original study protocol dated 24 August 2020 was amended twice (Sept 2020 and Apr 2021). 
Changes mostly pertained clarifications and updates in exploratory endpoint definitions or 
measurements. In addition, the definition of IGT and CFRD was updated to eliminate a gap in glucose 
values in previous protocol versions. There were no changes in conduct to the statistical analysis plan. 
Protocol deviations 
Two patients had important protocol deviations: one patient had study drug compliance of 71% and 
the other patient did not fast prior to the OGTT at Week 48.

Baseline data 
The included study population had a median age of 22.7 years (min, max 12.7, 51.5), 27.5% (n=19) 
of patients were <18 years of age and 55.1% was male (Table 3). The majority of patients (69.6%) 
were White, and 11.6% were Hispanic or Latino. At screening, 40 (58%) subjects were classified as 
having CFRD and 29 (42%) subjects were classified as having IGT based on the OGTT (Table 4). At 
baseline, the mean 2-hour post-OGTT blood glucose level was 217.6 mg/dL, and 20 (29%) subjects 
were receiving insulin; subjects were counseled on the safe withholding of insulins prior to each OGTT. 
The most common concomitant medications were those typically used for the management of CF; anti-
diabetic medications, except for exogenous (subcutaneously injected) insulins, were prohibited per the 
protocol.

Table 11. AEs occurring in at least 10% of patients by PT (Safety Set) 
Severity of adverse events 
Most patients had AEs that were mild or moderate in severity. In total ten (14.5%) patients had severe 
AEs, which were all grade 3 events reported for one or two patients each.  
Relationship of adverse events 
Ten (14.5%) patients had AEs that were assessed by the investigator as related to study drug, and 30 
(43.5%) patients had AEs that were assessed by the investigator as possibly related to study drug. AEs 
at least possibly related to study drug were most frequently reported for system organ class (SOC) 
investigations (21.7%), followed by skin- and subcutaneous tissue disorders (18.8%), gastrointestinal 
disorders and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (17.4% each).  
The most common (>5%) at least possibly related AEs were sputum increased (10.1%), cough 
(7.2%), blood bilirubin increased (8.7%), rash (7.2%), abdominal pain (7.2%), headache (5.8%), 
diarrhoea (5.8%), alanine aminotransferase increased (5.8%). 
Deaths and other serious adverse events 
There were no life-threatening AEs or deaths.  
Six (8.7%) patients had SAEs, none of which were considered to be related to study drug. These SAEs 
were mostly reported within the SOC infections and infestations (3 patients, 4.3%), i.e.: infective 
pulmonary exacerbation of CF, influenza and sinusitis.  
Study drug discontinuation 
No patients had AEs that led to discontinuation of study drug. Five (7.2%) patients interrupted study 
drug due to AEs of rash (2.9%), urticaria (1.4%), increased alanine aminotransferase (2.9%),

increased aspartate aminotransferase (2.9%), increased blood creatinine phosphokinase (1.4%), 
abdominal pain (1.4%) and pyrexia (1.4%). 
Adverse events of special interest 
Elevated transaminase event 
Seven (10.1%) patients had nonserious elevated transaminase events, most of which were assessed 
by the investigator as mild or moderate in severity. Two (2.9%) patients had elevated transaminase 
events that led to study drug interruption and no subjects had elevated transaminase events that led 
to discontinuation. 
Rash events 
Twelve (17.4%) patients had at least 1 rash event. Most patients had rash events that were mild or 
moderate in severity; none were serious. Three (4.3%) patients had rash events that led to treatment 
interruption, all of whom resumed study drug. There were no study drug discontinuations due to rash 
events. 
By sex, 5 (16.1%) female patients and 7 (18.4%) male patients had rash events. Of the female 
patients with rash events, 3 (27.3%) patients had concomitant use of hormonal therapy, and 2 
(10.0%) patients did not. 
Clinical laboratory evaluation 
Chemistry 
Elevated transaminase events - are described above.  
Creatinine kinase (CK) – The majority of subjects had CK levels ≤2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); 4 
(5.8%) subjects had CK levels >5 × ULN. AEs of blood CK increased were reported in 5 (7.2%) of 
patients.  
Other chemistry parameters - Six patients (8.7%) had AEs related to chemistry findings (excluding 
liver function tests and CK), all of these were mild or moderate in severity and none led to treatment 
interruption or discontinuation. 
Hematology 
There were no trends observed in hematology parameters. Three (4.3%) subjects had AEs related to 
hematology findings (anaemia/red blood cell count decreased and platelet count decreased). 
Vital signs 
There were no trends observed in the vital signs or ECG parameters. No patients had AEs related to 
vital signs values. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Design and conduct 
With this article 46 procedure, the MAH presented final study results of Study VX19-445-117, a Phase 
3b, open-label study in CF subjects 12 years of age and older, heterozygous for F508del and a minimal 
function mutation (F/MF genotypes), with abnormal glucose tolerance. Study VX19-445-117 is a 
standalone study. No changes to the current product information for Kaftrio have been proposed.  
Study 117 was designed to evaluate the effect of ELX/TEZ/IVA on glucose tolerance in CF subjects with 
impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or CF-related diabetes (CFRD). Due to the single arm trial design and

lack of discussion on the minimal important clinical difference in CF for the main clinical endpoints, 
interpretation of obtained results is hampered. 
The investigated dose of ELX/TEZ/IVA is identical to the registered posology for the study population. 
It is acceptable that results for some exploratory endpoints (i.e. change from baseline in: CGM 
parameter MAGE in patients with CFRD at Week 48, HbA1C, insulin use, post-OGTT diabetes-related 
biomarkers, biomarkers of inflammation, biomarkers of pancreatic function and post-OGTT incretin 
levels) have not been presented by the Applicant, as none of these endpoints are validated in CF-
related diabetes and interpretation is limited.  
Results 
Efficacy 
A total of 69 patients enrolled and received at least 1 dose of study drug, and 66 (95.7%) patients 
completed study drug treatment. The median age of the study population was 22.7 years, with 19 
patients (27.5%) <18 years of age. At screening, 58% of patients was classified as having CFRD and 
42% was classified as having IGT based on the OGTT. At baseline, 29% of patients was receiving 
insulin.  
The primary endpoint was met with a statistically significant mean within-group change of -35.0 mg/dL 
(95% CI: -49.2, -20.7; P<0.0001) in the 2-hour post-OGTT blood glucose levels from baseline to the 
average of Weeks 36 and 48. Results in the subgroups of CFRD and IGT patients indicated 
improvements in both populations: -40.7 mg/dL and -26.7 mg/dL, respectively.  
Results for the secondary endpoint supported the primary endpoint, with an improvement in 
dysglycaemia category from baseline to Week 48 in 37.7% of patients. 
These results indicate that ELX/TEZ/IVA does at least not deteriorate glucose tolerance in CF subjects 
with IGT or CFRD.  
Subgroup analysis by age (i.e. adolescents 12-18 years vs. adults ≥18 years) have not been 
presented. In line with previous procedures for ELX/TEZ/IVA, it is acceptable to pool results for 
adolescents and adults and no separate analysis per age group is requested. 
Safety 
No new safety concerns were identified. Almost all patients (97.1%) experienced at least 1 adverse 
event (AE). Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity. Ten (14.5%) patients had severe AEs, which 
were all grade 3 events reported for one or two patients each. Six (8.7%) subjects had serious adverse 
events (SAEs), none of which were considered to be related to study drug. There were no life-
threatening AEs or deaths. The data related to AEs of special interest rash events and transaminase 
elevations were consistent with prior experience. ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally safe and well tolerated 
with a low rate of treatment discontinuations. Overall, the AEs were mostly consistent with common 
manifestations of CF disease or with the known safety profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA. 
Conclusion 
Based on final results of Study 117, glucose tolerance in CF patients aged 12 years and older with IGT 
or CFRD is at least not deteriorated by treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA. No new safety concerns were 
identified.The benefit risk of ELX/TEZ/IVA remains positive and no update to the product information is 
deemed necessary.

Applicant’s response 
The requested endpoints were exploratory analyses. There is limited information available relating to 
how these parameters change in a cystic fibrosis (CF) population with abnormal glucose metabolism, 
and none of these endpoints are validated or utilized in routine clinical practice for the diagnosis or

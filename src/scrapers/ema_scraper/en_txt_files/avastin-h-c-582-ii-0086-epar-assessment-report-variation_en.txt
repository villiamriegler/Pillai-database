2.1.  Introduction

28 April 2016 
Lung cancer has been among the most common cancers in the world for several decades. The 2012 
worldwide estimates of cancer incidence and mortality by GLOBOCAN, indicate a total of 1.8 million 
new lung cancer cases and 1.6 million lung cancer related deaths, accounting for 13.0% of all cancer 
cases (except non-melanoma skin cancers) and 19.4% of all cancer deaths (except non-melanoma 
skin cancers). Furthermore, lung cancer incidence rates were two-fold higher in males compared to 
females (1,241,601 and 583,100, respectively). In 2013, the estimated number of lung cancer related 
deaths is 159,480 in the United States (Siegel et al 2013) and 269,610 in the European Union 
(Malvezzi et al 2013). 
The two most prevalent sub-types of lung cancer are small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC). Approximately 85% of all lung cancers are NSCLC, which is frequently further 
subdivided into non-squamous carcinoma (including adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and other 
cell types) and squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma accounting for approximately 15% to 25% of all 
NSCLC (~230,000 to 380,000 cases) (Brambilla et al, WHO 2014 and Schrump et al, Principles and 
Practice of Oncology 2011). 
Adenocarcinoma (40% of lung cancers) is the most common type of lung cancer, and is also the most 
frequently occurring in non-smokers as reported in United States (US) data (American Cancer Society 
2013). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/510480/2015 
Page 6/68 
 
 
 
 
 
NSCLC is associated with high mortality rates as >70% of the patients are diagnosed with locally 
advanced or metastatic disease (Molina et al 2008) [stages III and IV according to the American joint 
committee on cancer staging (AJCC)].  
In NSCLC, the first oncogenic driver mutations that were amenable to anti-cancer treatment were 
‘activating’ mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Lynch et al. 2004; Paez et al. 
2004). The incidence of activating EGFR mutated NSCLC is approximately 40% in East Asian 
populations and approximately 10% in Western populations (Mansuet-Lupo et al. 2014). 
According to the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines, first-line treatment with a 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), erlotinib, gefitinib, or afatinib, should be prescribed to patients with 
tumours bearing an activating (sensitising) mutation. 
About the product 
Avastin contains bevacizumab, a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody which bind to vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the key driver of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, and thereby 
inhibits the binding of VEGF to its receptors, Flt 1 (VEGFR-1) and KDR (VEGFR-2), on the surface of 
endothelial cells. Neutralising the biological activity of VEGF regresses the vascularisation of tumours, 
normalises remaining tumour vasculature, and inhibits the formation of new tumour vasculature, 
thereby inhibiting tumour growth. 
Avastin was initially authorised in the EU on 12 January 2005 for the treatment of metastatic 
carcinoma of the colon or rectum in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. It is 
currently approved in combination with other medicines to treat metastatic carcinoma of the colon or 
rectum (mCRC), metastatic breast cancer (mBC), Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), advanced 
and/or metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC), epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal 
cancer and metastatic carcinoma of the cervix (see SmPC section 4.1 for full detailed indications). 
As part of the present variation, the applicant applied for the following indication: 
Bevacizumab, in combination with erlotinib, is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with 
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) activating mutations. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Bevacizumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and not to be a 
significant risk to the environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk 
Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 21*), the ERA of 
bevacizumab   may consist of a justification for not submitting any ERA studies as proteins  are not 
expected to pose a significant risk to the environment. 
In the current application IMS Health marketing data for Europe for the period 2004-2014 was used to 
refine the predicted environmental concentration in surface water (PECsw) for Tarceva. In terms of 
absolute values, the average European PECsw for Tarceva had the highest value at 0.00212 μg/l in 
2010 and the highest maximum single-country PECsw is 0.00451 μg/l (Luxembourg). Thus, all use-
based surface water PECs for Tarceva during the past decade, are well below the action limit of 0.01 
μg/l. These PECs were derived without factoring in human metabolism or sewage works removal.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/510480/2015 
Page 7/68 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the ERA submitted by the Applicant in 2010, erlotinib is not readily or inherently 
biodegradable. Further, in sediment/water systems it is only removed through formation of NERs (Non-
Extractable Bound Residues), and not through biodegradation. Adsorption during sewage treatment is 
not sufficiently high to make a significant transfer to the soil compartment likely through land-
spreading of surplus sludge. 
Erlotinib showed limited chronic toxicity to the surface water model organisms algae, daphnia and fish, 
with the lowest NOEC (No Observed Effect Concentration) of these three organism groups being 0.52 
mg/l for fish; hence, the surface water PNEC (Predicted No Effect Concentration) is 52 μg/l. Similarly, 
erlotinib was not highly toxic to sediment-dwelling midge larvae, oligochaetes or nematodes, with the 
lowest organic carbon corrected chronic sediment NOEC of 250 mg/kg. Lastly, erlotinib was not toxic to 
activated sludge micro-organisms with a NOEC of 1000 mg/l nominal concentration. 
Erlotinib is not considered to be a persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) substance as it does not 
fulfil the Bioaccumulation criterion (BCF <2000). It is, however, persistent due to its non inherent 
biodegradability and a whole system DT50 of 86 days. Erlotinb is also toxic according to the CMR 
classification as it causes mammalian embryolethality, however it is not toxic based on chronic aquatic 
ecotoxicity. 
No new environmental fate and effect studies have been submitted for Tarceva in the current 
application.  
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
According to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human 
Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 21*), in the case of products containing proteins as active 
pharmaceutical ingredient(s), an ERA justifying the lack of ERA studies may be submitted.  As 
bevacizumab is a protein (monoclonal antibody) the lack of ERA studies is acceptable. 
The PECsw value for elotinib was below the action limit of 0.01 μg/l and thus a Phase II ERA was not 
required. The Applicant has nevertheless submitted chronic toxicity tests with algae (OECD 201), 
daphnia (OECD 211) and fish (OECD 210).  All risk PEC/PNEC characterisation ratios are well below 1. 
Therefore, no significant risks to the environmental compartments of concern (sewage treatment 
plants, surface water, groundwater and sediment) have been identified. In addition, erlotinib is not 
considered a PBT substance. 
With regard to erlotinib, the applied indication does not represent an expansion of the patient 
population in comparison to the already approved indication for erlotinib. The use of erlotinib is 
therefore not expected to increase significantly. 
In conclusion the use of bevacizumab in combination with erlotinib, in this extension of indication of 
Avastin, is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No specific pharmacokinetics (PK) studies were conducted to support this application. 
The  MAH  submitted  a  list  of  all  available  studies  providing  PK  and  PK-drug  drug  interaction  for 
bevacizumab however three studies pertinent to the current application are summarised below. 
-  Study  JO19907:  Phase  II  study  of  first-line  carboplatin-paclitaxel  (CP)  with or  without  bevacizumab 
in Japanese patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC (Niho et al 2012). 
After  stratification  for  disease  stage,  performance  status,  and  gender,  patients  were  randomized  in  a 
2:1 ratio to receive either 3-weekly (q3w) cycles of 15 mg/kg intravenous (IV) bevacizumab with 200 
mg/m2 paclitaxel and area under the curve (AUC) + 6 mg/mL/min (AUC6) carboplatin (bevacizumab + 
CP) or CP alone.  
The  study  was  conducted  in  two  steps.  Step  1  was  performed  to  evaluate  the  tolerability  of 
bevacizumab + CP in Japanese patients. In Step 2, eligible patients were randomly assigned to the two 
treatment arms. Serum samples for bevacizumab concentrations were collected at different time points 
from patients in the bevacizumab + CP treatment arms. 
PK  parameters  for  bevacizumab  were  assessed  in  51  Japanese  patients  with  non-squamous  NSCLC 
who received bevacizumab + CP. PK analyses showed that bevacizumab had a mean CL of 2.92 ± 0.56 
mL/day/kg,  a  mean  half-life  of  11.3  ±  2.1  days,  mean  V1  of  46.51  ±  6.79  mL/kg,  a  mean  AUCinf  of 
5,314 ± 1,013 μg • day/mL and a mean residence time (MRT) of 16.3 ± 3.0 days. 
-  Study  NCT00043823  (OSI2486S):  Phase  I/II  study  evaluating  bevacizumab  in  combination  with 
erlotinib for patients with recurrent NSCLC (Herbst et al. 2005) 
This  was  a  single-arm  trial  carried  out  at  two  centres  in  the  United  States  that  investigated  the 
efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety of combining bevacizumab (7.5 or 15 mg/kg q3w) with erlotinib 
(100 or 150 mg orally [po] daily [qd]) in patients with non-squamous NSCLC (Stage IIIB/IV) who were 
previously  treated  with  ≥  1  chemotherapy  regimen.  Patients  were  not  selected  on  the  basis  of  EGFR 
mutation status. 
In Phase I of the study, 3 patients were treated in each of the first two cohorts (Cohort 1, 7.5 mg/kg 
bevacizumab  q3w  with  100  mg  erlotinib  po  qd;  Cohort  2,  15  mg/kg  bevacizumab  q3w  with  100  mg 
erlotinib  po  qd);  6  patients  were  treated  in  Cohort  3  (15  mg/kg  bevacizumab  q3w  with  150  mg 
erlotinib  po  qd).  In  the  absence  of  dose-limiting  toxicities,  Phase  II  of  the  study  was  expanded  to 
include an additional 28 patients in Cohort 3, ensuring that 34 patients were treated at the protocol-
defined Phase II dose established in Phase I (15 mg/kg bevacizumab q3w and 150 mg/day erlotinib). 
Plasma samples for erlotinib concentrations and serum samples for bevacizumab concentrations were 
collected at different time points.  
Cmax  was  achieved  approximately  4  hours  after  oral  administration  of  both  100  and  150  mg  daily 
erlotinib.  Cmax  and  AUC0–24  increased  with  dose.  The  AUC0–24  for  150  mg  daily  erlotinib  was  26% 
higher  than  for  the  100  mg  dose.  Plasma  clearance  values  were  comparable  for  100  and  150  mg/d 
erlotinib (173 ± 200 L/d vs 184 ± 130 L/d); elimination half-life (t ½) values were 1.25 and 0.92 days, 
respectively.  Minimum  steady-state  concentration  (Css  min)  measured  from  days  8  to  147  was  also 
similar for each dose. 
For Bevacizumab, the mean terminal half-life (t ½) was 22.1 ± 14 days; the AUC0–N was 5.0 ± 2.0 day 
• μg/mL. The clearance (CL), volume of distribution of the central compartment (Vc), and steady state 
volume  of  distribution  (Vss)  were  3.2  ±  1.0  mL/kg/d,  36.8  ±  7.9  mL/kg,  and  77.4  ±  25  mL/kg, 
respectively.  The  Cmax  was  396  ±  76  μg/mL  which  increased  to  517  ±  82  μg/mL  on  day  64  after

This  was  a  multicentre,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind,  randomized  Phase  III  study.  Patients  with 
advanced  NSCLC  who  had  experienced  clinical  or  radiographic  progression  during  or  after  standard 
first-line  chemotherapy  or  chemoradiotherapy  were  randomized  to  receive  150  mg/day  erlotinib  po 
plus  placebo,  or  150  mg/day  erlotinib  +  15  mg/kg  bevacizumab  q3w,  until  disease  progression  or 
unmanageable  toxicity.  Plasma  samples  for  erlotinib  concentrations  and  serum  samples  for 
bevacizumab concentrations were collected at different time points. 
The  PK  substudy  did  not  meet  its  prespecified  patient  enrolment  goal  of  at  least  17  PK-evaluable 
patients  in  each  treatment  group.  Although  17  patients  in  each  arm  were  enrolled  into  the  PK 
substudy,  only  12  patients  in  the  erlotinib  +  placebo  group  and  10  patients  in  the  erlotinib  + 
bevacizumab groups were evaluable for PK. 
The average (CV%) peak  concentration of erlotinib in the presence and absence of bevacizumab  was 
1491 ng/mL (53%) and 1890 ng/mL (45%), respectively. The average T max was 5.2 and 3.5 hours and 
the  average  AUC  was  23.4  and  31.5  hr  •  μg/mL  in  the  presence  and  absence  of  bevacizumab, 
respectively. Overall, erlotinib in combination with bevacizumab had a lower C max, a later Tmax, and a 
lower overall exposure compared with erlotinib with placebo. 
Trough concentrations (Ctrough) for bevacizumab were similar to the observed Ctrough values measured 
in previous bevacizumab PK studies that used the same dosing regimen (e.g., Study AVF0757g), and 
were  also  similar  to  Ctrough  values  predicted  using  simulations  from population  PK  modeling  (Lu et  al. 
2008). 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  PK  of  Bv  have  been  extensively  characterized  in  multiple  clinical  studies  with  doses  from  1  to 
20 mg/kg  administered  at  a  frequency  ranging  from  weekly  to  q3w  in  patients  with  various  tumour 
types including NSCLC. 
There are no mechanistic reasons that suggest EGFR mutation status would affect the PK of Bv, and so 
no  studies  have  been  performed  to  address  this.  Because  the  clearance  mechanism  of  Bv  is  not 
considered  to  be  associated  with  the  EGFR  mutation  status  of  patients’  tumours,  the  PK  of  Bv  in 
patients with activating EGFRmut+ NSCLC is expected to be consistent with the PK described by PopPK 
modelling. 
These findings support the Bv dosing strategy proposed for patients with activating EGFRmut+ NSCLC, 
in which Bv is administered based on body weight-adjusted dose (15 mg/kg) q3w. 
The PK of Erl has also been extensively characterized and thus not further addressed in this document.  
Exploration of Influence of Racial/Ethnic Factors  
Data from two studies in Caucasians and Japanese patients; JO19907 and JO16564 (Yamamoto et al. 
2008),  support  the  similarity  in  exposure  for  both  Bv  and  Erl  across  racial/ethnic  groups.  Overall 
findings from Study JO19907 suggested that the PK of Bv in Japanese patients appeared similar to that 
reported  in  predominantly  Caucasian  patients  treated  with  Bv + CP  in  Study AVF0757g  (see  EPAR  for 
variation  EMEA/H/C/582/II/09).  Study  JO16564  characterized  the  PK  of  Erl  in  Japanese  patients  and 
the results demonstrated that the Erl PK profile in Japanese patients to be similar to that observed in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/510480/2015

Caucasian patients. 
So far there has not been any indication of a treatment difference as function of ethnicity. With regard 
to  erlotinib,  the  activating  mutation  is  the  main  determinant  of  treatment  effect  regardless  of  ethnic 
origin.  Studies  OPTIMAL,  EURTAC  and  ENSURE  clearly  demonstrate  this  (see  Tarceva  EPAR).  Thus, 
based  on  current  knowledge,  it  is  expected  that  the  effect  of  Erl+Bv  observed  in  the  Japanese 
population in study JO25567 could be extrapolated to a European population. 
Population PK Analyses for Bevacizumab and Erlotinib 
The  PK  of  Bv  has  been  characterized  previously  in  patients  with  solid  tumours  (i.e.,  colorectal  cancer 
[CRC],  hormone  refractory  prostate  cancer  [HRPC],  metastatic breast  cancer [mBC],  or  NSCLC)  from 
eight clinical trials in which Bv was administered either as a single agent or in combination with various 
chemotherapies.    These  data  comprise  the  “Reference  PopPK  Model”  provide  a  reference  model  for 
additional popPK analyses of data from other patient populations across various tumour types.   
Although  race  was  evaluated  in  the  Reference  PopPK  Analysis,  patient  numbers  were  too  low  across 
the  race  categories  to  conclude  whether  a  significant  difference  in  Bv  exposure  was  observed.    An 
external  analysis  compared  the  results  of  Study  JO19907  against  the  Reference  PopPK  Model,  and 
confirmed that the PK of Bv from Japanese patients with NSCLC in Study JO19907 was similar to the 
predominantly  Caucasian  patients  included  in  this  model.  This  result  is  consistent  with  published 
results  of  PK  analyses  for  therapeutic  monoclonal  antibodies  that  support  that  race  (Japanese  and 
others) is not a covariate associated with PK when body weight is taken into account. 
Exploration of Bevacizumab-Erlotinib Pharmacokinetic Interaction 
The  PK  of  the  combination  of  Bv  and  Erl  was  studied  in  a  Phase I/II  trial  in  patients  with  NSCLC 
(Study NCT00043823/OSI2486s).  The  results  from  this  study  showed  that  combining  Bv  (15 mg/kg 
q3w)  and  Erl  (150mg/day)  was  well  tolerated  and  active  in  NSCLC.    These  results,  together  with  the 
results from Study OSI3364g, a phase III study where a PK sub-part of the study showed no clinically 
significant difference in the PK parameters of Erl or its metabolite OSI-420 in the presence or absence 
of Bv, were used to support the dose justification of Bv and Erl in Study JO25567. 
Bv  and  Erl  do  not  share  clearance  pathways.    Thus,  it  is  not  expected that  Bv  would  have  any  direct 
effect  on  exposure  of  Erl  or  its  metabolites,  and  similarly,  Erl  would  not  be  expected  to  alter  Bv 
exposure. Erl is metabolized primarily via the CYP3A4 pathway and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2, and 
the  pulmonary  isoform  CYP1A1.  Agents  known  to  inhibit or  induce  CYP3A4  and  CYP1A2  function  may 
alter the PK of Erl.  However, the metabolism of Bv is primarily via proteolytic catabolism throughout 
the body and not via cytochrome P450 (CYP450) pathways.  Therefore, Bv would not be expected to 
alter  Erl  disposition.    Furthermore,  Bv  is  not  a  cytokine  modulator;  therefore,  it  is  not  expected  that 
any indirect or direct effect of Bv on CYP-450 enzyme levels would lead to alterations of the exposure 
of  Erl  or  its  metabolites.    In  addition,  there  is  no  known  mechanism  that  would  suggest  that  the 
mutated EGF receptor would affect the clearance of Bv.  
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Based on the data submitted, it is expected that the effect of Erl+Bv observed in the Japanese 
population in study JO25567 could be extrapolated to a European population. The Population PK model 
for Erl indicates no clinical significant relationship between predicted apparent clearance and ethnicity 
and the PK-DDI data available for Bv given in combination with Erl do not suggest a potential for a PK-
DDI between Bv and Erl.

EGFR mutation testing 
EGFR status was determined prior to study screening at each medicinal institution, using cells derived 
from paraffin embedded sections, pleural fluid, bronchial lavage or transbronchial brushing followed by 
analysis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The assay methods used and EGFR mutation status of 
patients  were  recorded  at  inclusion  into  the  study.  For  patients  enrolled  in  Study  JO25567,  EGFR 
testing  was  performed  at  three  major  reference  laboratories  that  are  certified  by  an  international 
standard  for  clinical  testing  laboratories  (ISO  15189)  and  maintain  qualification  by  The  College  of

American Pathologists, and in addition conduct testing according to Japanese Good Laboratory Practice 
and Good Clinical Practice. 
Treatments 
Erlotinib  150  mg tablet  was  to  be  taken  once  daily before  breakfast  with  1 glass  (approximately  200 
mL) of water, every day.  
Bevacizumab:  15  mg/kg  intravenous  drip  infusion  was  performed  on  Day  1  of  each  cycle  (1  cycle  is 
assumed  to  be  21  days).  When  administering,  the  preceding  cycle  period  must  have  ended 
(administration on the 22 to 25 day counting from the preceding administration day, excluding cases in 
which administration was delayed due to an adverse event).  
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
To  compare  the  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  of  erlotinib  plus  bevacizumab  combination  therapy 
(Erl+Bv group) with Erlotinib monotherapy (Erl group) based on blinded review by an IRC, to minimize 
any potential bias in the assessment of the primary endpoint. 
Secondary Objectives 
To  compare  the  Erl+Bv  group  and  Erl  group  with  respect  to  each  of  the  following  items:  Overall 
survival  (OS),  tumour  response  (response  rate,  disease  control  rate,  and  duration  of  response), 
improvement  of  symptoms  and  QOL  based  on  Functional  Assessment  of  Cancer  Therapy  for  patients 
with Lung cancer (FACT-L), safety profile. 
Exploratory Objectives 
Measurement  of  serum  angiogenic  factor,  ligands,  etc.,  measurement  of  gene  polymorphism, 
measurement of plasma VEGF, gene expression analysis using tumour tissue, measurement of protein, 
and measurement of proteomics. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
Progression  free  survival  (PFS)  defined  as  the  period  from  registration  in  the  study  until  the  date  of 
confirmation of progressive disease (PD) or the date of death from any cause, whichever occurs first. 
Secondary endpoints 
- Overall survival (OS) defined as the period from registration in the study until death irrespective of 
the cause

stable disease (SD), according to RECIST 
- Duration of response (DOR) defined as the period from first report of response (CR or PR, whichever 
status was recorded first) until PD was confirmed or death (whichever occurs first). 
- Quality of life (QoL) was evaluated using FACT-L including 5 low-order scales: 1. Feeling of physical 
health,  2.  Feeling  of  social  health,  3.  Feeling of  mental  health,  4.  Feeling  of  functional  health,  and  5.

Sample size 
From past findings on patients with NSCLC who are positive for EGFR gene mutation, the median PFS 
of Erlotinib used alone was set at 13 months. Out of consideration for the anticipated additional effect 
of bevacizumab, HR was set at 0.7, and when supposing a one-sided significance level of 20% and a 
power of 80%, the required number of PFS events is 89. When setting the registration period at 12.5 
months and the study period at 28 months, and taking into consideration the number of discontinued / 
dropout  patients,  the  number  of  patients  required  to  accumulate  89  events  is  150  patients  in  the  2 
groups (75 patients in each group). 
In order to increase the precision of the estimated value, even if 89 events are observed in the early 
stages, observation will be continued during the 28-month study period, and even more events are to 
be accumulated. In addition, if the target number of events is not reached within the study period, the 
study period (follow-up period) will be extended until at least 89 events are observed. 
Randomisation 
Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to the Erl+Bv group or Erl group at a ratio of 1:1 using the 
dynamic allocation method, based on the stratification factors shown below. 
Stratification factors: 
1) Gender: Female vs. male 
2) Clinical stage: IIIB vs. IV vs. post-operative recurrence 
3) Smoking status: Non or Former light smoker vs. Other 
4) EGFR gene mutation type: Exon19del vs. L858R 
Blinding (masking) 
Study JO25567 was an open-label study.  
Statistical methods 
The FAS was the main analysis set for the analysis of efficacy. In addition, as reference, efficacy was 
analysed using the per protocol set (PPS) as well. 
The  Kaplan-Meier  method  was  used  to  estimate  the  survival  function,  the  median  PFS  and  the  95% 
confidence  interval  of  the  same  was  calculated,  and  the  2  groups  were  compared  using  the  log-rank 
test. The confidence interval was calculated based on the Greenwood method. 
In addition, the hazard ratio of PFS in the Erl+Bv group compared to that of the Erl group was shown 
using a proportional hazard model.  
The  estimate  and  the  95%  confidence  interval  were  calculated  for  response  rate  and  disease  control 
rate. The Clopper-Pearson method was used to calculate the confidence interval.  
Overall survival and duration of response was analysed similarly to PFS. 
QOL  Evaluation  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  FACT-L  scoring  manual.  With  respect  to  the 
total score and each subscale score, the statistics at each time point were calculated, and the changes 
over time were summarized. Similar summarization was carried out regarding changes in scores from 
baseline. 
In  the  safety  analysis  population,  the  incidence  of  adverse  events  /  adverse  drug  reactions  and  the 
95% confidence interval were estimated.

The most common later lines of therapy were other EGFR TKI’s, pemetrexed, docetaxel, carboplatin, 
cisplatin and bevacizumab. It is noted that bevacizumab was used more commonly by patients in the 
Erl arm than the Erl+Bv arm. More than three quarters of patients received second-line therapy in both 
treatment arms. Third-line of treatment was received by 63.6% and 56.0% of patients in the Erl arm 
and Erl+Bv arm, respectively. Fourth and later lines of treatment were used by more patients in the Erl 
arm (53.2%; n=41) compared to the Erl+Bv arm (37.3%, n=28). 
Numbers analysed 
Of 154 randomized patients, 2 patients (Erl+Bv group) were discontinued before the start of 
administration due to pulmonary artery thrombosis and increased pleural effusion, so the number of 
patients who were administered the investigational drug at least once (safety analysis population) was 
152 patients (Erl+Bv group: 75 patients, Erl group: 77 patients).

Supportive study(ies) 
- Study OSI3364g: A Phase III, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial 
to evaluate the efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with erlotinib compared with erlotinib alone for 
treatment of advanced NSCLC after failure of standard first-line chemotherapy. 
Patients with advanced NSCLC who had experienced clinical or radiographic progression during or after 
standard  first-line  chemotherapy  or  chemo-radiotherapy  were  randomized  to  receive  either  Erl  (150 
mg  daily  orally)  plus  placebo  or  Erl  (150  mg  daily  orally)  plus  Bv  (15  mg/kg  IV  q3w),  until  disease 
progression  or  unmanageable  toxicity.    All  patients  were  followed  for  survival  until  death,  loss  to 
follow-up, or study termination. 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of Erl+Bv relative to Erl monotherapy, 
as  measured  by  OS.    Secondary  objectives  were  PFS,  ORR,  duration  of  response,  safety  and 
pharmacokinetics  (PK).    The  possible  relationship  between  exploratory  biomarkers  including  EGFR 
mutations and efficacy outcomes was also investigated.  
A total of 636 (317 in the Erl+Pl arm, 319 in the Erl+Bv arm) patients were enrolled into this study. In 
the subgroup of 25 patients with activating EGFRmut+ tumours (13 in the Erl+Pl arm, 12 in the Erl+Bv 
arm), some differences were apparent between the two arms; a lower proportion of females, ECOG PS 
0 and ‘never smokers’ and the higher proportion of patients ≥ 65 years in the Erl+Pl arm; see Section 
3.1 for details.  Overall, 64% of patients were Caucasian.   
The results of the primary analysis showed a similar OS in both treatment arms (stratified HR 0.970; 
95% CI 0.80, 1.18; p = 0.7583).  The median OS was 9.2 months (95% CI 7.85, 11.60) in the Erl+Pl 
arm vs 9.3 months (95% CI 7.39, 11.47) in the Erl+Bv arm.  One year survival rates were also similar 
in the two arms (42.1% in the Erl+Bv arm vs 40.7% in the Erl+Pl arm).  
With respect to PFS, the risk of disease progression or death was reduced by 38% in the Erl+Bv arm 
compared  to  the  Erl+Pl  arm  (stratified  HR  0.62;  95%  CI  0.52,  0.75;  log-rank  p-value  =  <0.0001).  
The  median  PFS  was  1.7  months  Erl+Pl  vs  3.4  months  Erl+Bv.    The  ORR  was  12.6%  with  Erl+Bv 
compared  with  6.2%  for  Erl+Pl.    For  patients  with  an  objective  response,  the  median  duration  of 
response was 9.7 months in the Erl+Bv arm vs 8.4 months in the Erl+Pl arm. 
In  the  activating  EGFRmut+  subgroup  of  25  patients  (13  Erl+Pl  vs  12  Erl+Bv),  the  observed 
unstratified HR for OS was 0.47 (95% CI 0.11, 2.00); the KM estimated median OS was 20.2 months 
in  the  Erl+Pl  arm  and  not  reached  in  the  Erl+Bv  arm.    Compared  with  Erl+Pl,  treatment  with  Erl+Bv 
resulted in a 39% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death (unstratified HR: 0.61; 95%CI 
0.21, 1.78), which is consistent with the HR observed in the ITT population.  The median PFS was 11.0 
months in Erl+Pl arm vs 17.1 months in Erl+Bv arm. 
Study BO20571: A Phase II study of erlotinib in combination with bevacizumab versus chemotherapy 
plus bevacizumab in first-line advanced NSCLC patients 
This  was  an  open-label,  multicentre,  randomized,  2-arm  study  in  patients  with  advanced  non-
squamous NSCLC without prior systemic chemotherapy for stage IIIB/IV or recurrent disease.   
Patients  were  randomized  on  a  1:1  basis  to  either  Erl+Bv  or  chemotherapy  +  Bv  (CT+Bv)  using  the 
following  stratification  factors:  region  (Western  Europe  vs  Eastern  Europe  vs  other  region),  smoking 
status  (current  smoker  vs  past  smoker  vs  never  smoked),  gender  and  tumour  histology 
(adenocarcinoma  vs  other  histology).    In  the  Erl+Bv  arm,  Erl  was  given  orally  at  a  dose  of  150  mg 
daily and Bv at 15 mg/kg IV q3w until disease progression.  Patients in the CT+Bv arm received four to 
six  cycles  of  a  standard  platinum-containing  regimen  (gemcitabine/cisplatin  or  carboplatin/paclitaxel) 
plus Bv (15 mg/kg q3w IV).

The  primary  efficacy  parameter  was  PFS  (RECIST  version  1.0)  with  tumour  assessments  scheduled 
every 6 weeks for the first 8 cycles and then every 12 weeks thereafter. 
This  study  was  terminated  prematurely  as  results  from  the  first  interim  analysis  (data  cut-off  17 
September 2008) indicated inferior PFS for patients in the Erl+Bv arm compared with the CT+Bv arm 
(HR 2.17; 95% 0.88; 5.34) which was confirmed in an updated interim analysis (data cut-off 6 January  
2009;  HR  2.05;  95%  CI  [1.11;  3.77]).    The  duration  of  follow-up  was  extended  in  order  to  observe 
more  events,  specifically  for  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  EGFRmut+  tumours  for  whom  a  longer 
duration  of  OS  was  expected.    The  efficacy  results  presented  for  patients  with  activating  EGFRmut+ 
tumours are based on the final analysis.   
A  total  of  124  (61  CT+Bv  vs  63  Erl+Bv)  patients  were  enrolled  into  this  study.    The  EGFRmut+ 
subgroup  comprised  24  patients  (11  CT+Bv  vs  13  Erl+Bv).    The  median  age  was  58  years  in  the 
CT+Bv  arm  and  60  years  in  the  Erl+Bv  arm.    In  the  overall  activating  EGFRmut+  population,  the 
majority  (83%)  was  Asian,  men  and  women  were  equally  distributed  and  all  patients  had  good 
performance  status  at  baseline  (ECOG  PS  0  or 1).    Adenocarcinoma  (88%)  was  the  predominant 
histologic type reported.  Overall, the study arms were generally well balanced except that the Erl+Bv 
arm had more past/current smokers than the CT+Bv arm (46% vs 27%, respectively). 
At the final analysis, 73% (8/11) of patients in the CT+Bv arm vs 69% (9/13) in the Erl+Bv arm had 
experienced  a  PFS  event.    Relative  to  the  CT+Bv  arm,  the  risk  of  disease  progression  or  death  was 
reduced by 60% in the Erl+Bv arm (HR 0.40, 95%CI 0.13-1.19]).  The KM-estimated median was 11.0 
in the CT+Bv arm and 16.4 months in the Erl+Bv arm. 
Study  SAKK  19/05:  Bevacizumab  and  erlotinib  as  first-line  therapy  in  advanced  non-squamous  non-
small-cell  lung  cancer  (stage  IIIB/IV)  followed  by  platinum-based  chemotherapy  at  disease 
progression: A multicenter phase II trial. 
Knowledge  of  EGFR  status  was  not  required  at  study  entry.    Patients  were  scheduled  to  receive 
erlotinib  (150  mg  po  daily)  plus  bevacizumab  (15  mg/kg  q3w  IV)  until  disease  progression  or 
unacceptable  toxicity.  Upon  disease  progression,  patients  received  6  cycles  of  a  standard  platinum-
regimen 
containing 
[1250 mg/m2]/carboplatin [AUC 5]).

The  primary  endpoint  for the  study  was  IRC  assessed  disease  stabilization  rate  (DSR; defined  as  CR, 
PR or SD) after 12 weeks of Erl+Bv treatment according to RECIST version 1.0.  Secondary endpoints 
included  DSR  at  6  and  18  weeks,  objective  response,  best  ORR,  AE,  time  to  progression,  time  to 
treatment failure and QoL.  Overall survival was assessed for both treatment phases.  
QoL  was  assessed  using  the  Lung  Cancer  Symptom  Scale  (LCSS),  with  the  addition  of  one  global 
indicator to assess patients’ estimation of overall treatment burden. 
Of the 101 evaluable patients, 12 (12%) had activating EGFR mutation tumours (exon 19 deletion or 
exon  21  L858R).    In  the  overall  evaluable  population  of  101  patients,  the  majority  had  stage  IV 
disease  (86%)  with  adenocarcinoma  being  the  most  common  cancer  histologic  type  (89%).    The 
median  age  of  patients  was  65  years  (range  32-80  years)  and  most  of  the  patients  were 
former/current smokers (67%).  The gender distribution was balanced (52.5% women vs 47.5% men) 
and all patients had good functional status at baseline (ECOG PS 0 [52.5%] or 1 [47.5%]). 
In the 12 patients with activating EGFR mutation tumours, the DSR at 12 weeks was 83.3% (10/12).  
Of the 10 patients with at least SD at 12 weeks, one patient had CR, five patients had a PR and four 
patients had SD.  The median TTP was 11.1 months (95% CI 1.3 – 15.4 months) and the median OS 
was not reached.  One-year and 2-year OS rates were 83% and 71%, respectively.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
No dose response study was conducted to support this extension of indication which is considered 
acceptable as there is no rationale for a change in dose based on EGFR mutation status. The 
tolerability of concomitant use of erlotinib 150 mg/day and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg/3 weeks was 
confirmed in previous studies (NCT00043823 and OSI2950g). 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Overall, the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the pivotal study are considered adequate. The inclusion 
criteria clearly define the patient population. Patients with T790M mutation of exon 20 were excluded. 
Furthermore, it seems that patients with symptomatic as well as asymptomatic progression were 
eligible. However, no patients with ECOG PS of 2 or higher were included in the pivotal study. This is 
reflected in the SmPC, Section 5.1. The posology as proposed for the study is considered tolerable and 
in line with current practice.  
The objectives are considered clinically relevant. The primary endpoint was PFS by IRC, which is 
acceptable in a first-line setting.  Secondary endpoints included OS, tumour response and QoL.  
The sample size, with >70 patients in each group, is acceptable. The level of power (80%) is 
considered low, but acceptable and in accordance with the ICH guideline E9. However, the level of 
significance (one-sided alfa=20%) may be considered low, but not unusual in phase II studies. The 
risk of a false-positive result is considerably higher compared to standard alfa = 5% in phase III 
studies. 
The MAH has used dynamic allocation, which is less preferred as discussed in the CHMP guideline on 
adjustment for baseline covariates (EMA/295050/2013). Nevertheless, it is considered reasonable for 
this specific study in order to avoid small strata. It seems unlikely that a selection bias could have had 
any impact on the patient allocation. This is supported by the fact that the deterministic part of the 
algorithm was never used, and it seems also unlikely that the individual sites would have had 
knowledge about all other sites in order to predict the next patient’s allocation. The stratification 
factors are few and reasonable. 
During the conduct of the study the protocol was amended 12 times. None of these are considered 
critical. 
The majority of the patients are female, and the median age is 67 years in both groups. The mean 
Brinkman index is higher in the Erl + Bv group, meaning that these patients had a higher consumption 
of cigarettes but the groups seem to be well-balanced with regard to smoking status (non-smoker, 
former, other).  
There is a difference in terms of initial date of diagnosis to the first day of administration, and also with 
regard to the period from the date of diagnosis of recurrence to the first day of administration. Patients 
in the Erl group seem to have a longer period from diagnosis to treatment. However, sensitivity 
analyses show that these differences did not have any major effect on the primary endpoint. 
The included patients were solely Japanese. This may raise some concerns regarding the validity and 
generalizability of the results to a Western population. However, there is robust scientific evidence to 
support the claim that EGFR activating mutations (exon 19 deletions and L858R) in tumours of Asian 
and Caucasian NSCLC patients are sufficiently similar to justify extrapolation of the results from the 
Japanese study JO25567 to Caucasians. The effect of bevacizumab in different ethnic groups has been 
investigated in several clinical trials. So far there has not been any indication of a treatment difference 
depending on ethnicity. Studies OPTIMAL, EURTAC and ENSURE have previously demonstrated that the 
Assessment report

Page 38/68 
 
 
 
 
 
EGFR mutations is the main driver of treatment effect, thus, allowing an extrapolation between 
Japanese (Asians) and Caucasians patients. 
Distribution  of  exon  19  deletion  and  exon  21  L858R  seems  to  be  well  balanced  between  treatment 
arms,  and  a  sensitivity  analysis  excluding  these  patients  from  the  PFS  analysis,  indicate  that  the  HR 
and the 95%CI remain unchanged. Thus, these patients do not seem have any impact on the overall 
PFS estimate.  
The currently validated testing to identify patients, for whom first-line treatment with erlotinib is 
considered appropriate, is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of EGFR exon 19 
deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations. In this context, the cobas EGFR Mutation Test, 
based on PCR analysis of DNA extracted from patient tumour tissue, has been validated through CE-
marking in the EU. This test is also approved by the FDA. The results from the concordance study 
WO29921 confirmed that there is concordance between the three main assay types (PNA-LNA PCR-
Clamp, PCR Invader, and Cycleave) used in study JO25567 and the cobas test. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study JO25567 met its primary endpoint. The primary endpoint, PFS by IRC, shows a clear difference 
in  favour  of  the  Erl+Bv  group.  The  median  PFS  is  16.0  months  vs.  9.7  months.  The  HR  is  0.54 
(95%CI:  0.36;  0.79).  The  difference  is  both  statistically  and  clinically  significant.  Treatment  with 
Erl+Bv provides a longer period without progression, thus, prolonging the time to second-line therapy. 
However, having in mind that the population represents the same population as one would expect in a 
clinical  setting  and  in  a  phase  III  study  with  the  same  primary  endpoint,  there  is  a  reasonable 
biological  rationale  for  observing  the  difference  in  PFS.  The  p-value  for  the  HR  is  highly  statistically 
significant. 
PFS by exon 21 L858R mutation and exon 19 deletion are in line with the overall estimate. However, 
the difference in PFS in patients with exon 21 L858R is not statistically significant. This is mainly due to 
small numbers.  
The  subgroup  analysis  shows  that  the  point  estimate  for  all  the  different  subgroups  is  below  1,  and 
thus  in  line  with  the  overall  estimate.  However,  due  to  small  number  of  patients  in  some  subgroups, 
wide  confidence  intervals  are  observed,  but  no  firm  conclusion  can  be  drawn  with  regard  to  these 
subgroups.  
Looking  at  PFS  by  mutation  status,  patients  with  exon  19  deletion  seems  to  have  a  greater  effect  of 
Erl+Bv. There has been some discussion in the scientific community whether the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs 
differs  between  exon  19  deletion  and  exon  21  L858R  mutation.  There  seems  to  be  some 
evidence/indications  that  exon  19  deletion  might  the  associated  with  longer  PFS  (Jackman  et  al. 
(2006), Riely et al. (2006), Sun et al. (2011)).  
It is well-known that skin  rash due treatment with erlotinib is associated with good response. It may 
be  somewhat  problematic  to  interpret  the  data  since  both  groups  are  treated  with  erlotinib.  With 
regard  to  PFS  the  addition  of  Bv  to  Erl  does  not  have  any  major  detrimental  effect  on  the  good 
response associated with skin rash. There seems to be an advantage of adding Bv to Erl with regard to 
response  rates.  Patients  with  Grade  >  2  rash  seems  to  have  higher  response  rates  and  much  higher 
disease  control.  The  addition  of  Bv  to  Erl  does  not  seem  to  have  a  detrimental  effect  on  the  good 
response  associated  with  skin  rash  in  patients  treated  with  Erl.  In  the  primary  endpoint  PFS  by  IRC, 
patients  were  censored  due  to  unconfirmed  PD,  withdrawal  or  continuation  at data  cut-off,  and  there 
are  no  apparent  differences  between  treatment  arms.  Furthermore,  the  PFS  by  investigator  supports 
PFS  by  IRC.  Thus,  the  censoring  of  patients  in  the  two  treatment  groups  do  not  seem  to  have  any 
major impact on the overall results, and do not seem to be biased.

With  regard  to  the  secondary  endpoints,  there  seems  to  be  no  difference  in  OS  between  the  two 
groups.  The  OS  data  is  still  considered  immature  at  present  due  to  the  limited  number  of  deaths.  At 
the cut-off date of 7 November 2014 there were 27 deaths in each arm (36.0% of the patients in the 
Erl  +  Bv  arm  vs.  35.1%  in  the  Erl  arm).  HR  was  1.04  (95%  CI  0.61;  1.77).  Based  on  the  further 
updated OS data (cut-off 28 October 2015) there seems to be no detrimental effect of bevacizumab on 
OS. However, data are still not mature. In addition, the multitude of additional lines of treatment and 
anti-cancer agents used (e.g. patients in the Erl-arm could also receive Bv) makes the interpretation of 
the OS data even more uncertain. 
However, the MAH should submit mature OS data from Study JO25567 by June 2018, as an imposed 
post  authorisation  efficacy  study  to  the  marketing  authorization  as  the  initial  efficacy  assessment  is 
based  on  surrogate  endpoints.  In  addition,  the  MAH  should  discuss  any  further  outcome  data  on  the 
combination  of  bevacizumab  +  erlotinib  in  this  indication  (e.g.  data  from  the  ongoing  ACCRU  study, 
NCT number NCT01532089) (see Annex II). 
A slight difference in favour of the Erl+Bv group with regard to overall response is observed, but the 
actual difference in number of patients is very small. Although one would expect a significant increase 
in response rate by the addition of bevacizumab to erlotinib, this was not observed. However, the 
response rate in both groups is considered high (64% in erl vs. 69% in Erl+Bv). But more importantly 
the duration of response was 13.3 months in Erl+Bv group compared to 9.3 months in erl group. This 
difference is considered clinically relevant and correlates very well with PFS data. Thus, it seems that 
the effect of erlotinib is maintained for a longer time with the addition of bevacizumab, and this is of 
clinical importance in a disease with a very aggressive course. The observed difference in PFS is 
clinically highly relevant, the point estimate is robust, and the study has met its primary endpoint. The 
observed median PFS in the Erl group is in line with previous findings. 
With  regard  to  QoL,  there  seems  to  be  no  clinically  significant  difference  between  the  two  groups. 
Thus,  apparently  the  addition  of  Bv  to  Erl  do  not  seem  to  have  a  detrimental  effect  on  the  QoL. 
However, since study JO25567 is an open-label study, the reliability of these data is questionable. 
Three supportive studies are presented; OSI3364g, BO20571 and SAKK 19/05. The SAKK 19/05 study 
is  not  randomized.  Only  OSI3364g  is  a  phase  III  double-blinded  study.  All  studies  were  in  first-line 
except  for  OSI3364g,  which  was  in  second-line  setting.  None  of  the  supportive  studies  conducted  a 
prospective  EGFR  mutation  testing.  Gender  and  smoking  status  were  the  only  common  stratification 
factors  in  the  randomized  studies.  With  regard  to  PFS,  the  observed  results  support  the  findings  in 
study JO25567. However, a direct comparison is not possible, due to several differences between the 
studies. Nonetheless, it is encouraging to see supportive evidence from these studies. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Study JO25567 met its primary endpoint. The primary endpoint, PFS by IRC, shows a clear difference 
in  favour  of  the  Erl+Bv  group.  The  difference  is  both  statistically  and  clinically  significant.  Treatment 
with  Erl+Bv  provides  a  considerable  longer  period  without  progression,  thus,  prolonging  the  time  to 
second-line  therapy.  There  seems  to  be  no  detrimental  effect  of  bevacizumab  +  erlotinib  on  OS, 
however, data are not mature yet. In addition, the multitude of additional lines of treatment and anti-
cancer agents used (e.g. patients in the Erl-arm could also receive Bv) makes the interpretation of the

should submit mature overall survival data for study JO25567 (due date: Q2 2018) 
In  addition,  the  MAH  should  discuss  any  further  outcome  data on  the  combination  of  bevacizumab  + 
erlotinib in this indication (e.g. data from the ongoing ACCRU study, NCT number NCT01532089) (due

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Because of differences in trial designs (including studies with different comparator regimens compared 
with Study JO25567) and in order to be able to assess safety in patients of different ethnicity/race, it 
was not considered clinically meaningful to provide pooled integrated displays of the safety data from 
the  pivotal  Study  JO25567  compared  with  the  key  supporting  studies  BO20571,  AVF3671g,  and 
OSI3364g.    However,  where  feasible  and  appropriate,  side-by-side  displays  of  safety  data  from  the 
different studies are presented for ease of comparison and identification of common characteristics of 
the safety profile across studies that employed a combination arm of bevacizumab and erlotinib.   
Pivotal dataset from Study JO25567 is based on the clinical data cutoff date of 31 March 2014, which is 
an update from the cutoff date of 30 June 2013 of the primary CSR to provide an additional 9 months 
of safety follow-up.

Table 21: Overview of erlotinib exposure 
The median duration of erlotinib exposure in the Erl+Bv arm is 431 days in study JO25567. A similar 
number of patients in both groups had a dose reduction to 100 mg erlotinib. The exposure to Erl+Bv 
may be considered adequate to allow evaluation of the safety profile.  Few patient continued treatment 
beyond  18-20  months.  Otherwise,  a  comparable  number  of  patients  are  exposed  to  study  treatment 
throughout the study duration. 
Adverse events 
The observed safety profile in studies supporting this application is described in the table below.

Common AEs 
Table 23: Overview across studies of All-grade adverse events occurring with a ≥10% higher incidence 
in the Erl+Bv arm than in Erl Arm (safety analysis population) - JO25567 
Grade ≥ 3 AEs 
There is a considerable difference in the overall number of patients experiencing a Grade ≥ 3 AEs; 68 
(90.7%)  in  the  Erl+Bv  group  vs.  41  (53.2%)  in  the  Erl  group  in  Study  JO25567.  There  are  slightly 
more  infections  in  the  Erl+Bv  group,  but  no  clear  pattern  is  observed.  There  are  considerable  more 
patients  experiencing  hypertension  in  the  Erl+Bv  group,  which  is  expected.  As  it  will  be  discussed 
later,  there  are  very  few  discontinuations  due  to  hypertension.    Dermatitis  acneiform  is  more 
commonly seen in the Erl+Bv group. There are slightly more hepatobiliary disorders in the Erl group. 
An updated analysis with clinical cutoff of date of 31 March 2014 did not show any relevant changes or 
differences.  
An overview of Grade ≥3 AEs with a ≥2% higher incidence in the Erl+Bv group than in the Erl group 
showed  an  excess  of  AEs  in  the  Erl+Bv  arm,  primarily  driven  by  a  large  difference  in  hypertension. 
Only  one  Grade  5  AE  occurred  (drowning),  and  it  was  observed in  the  Erl  group.  Seven  Grade  4  AEs 
were  observed  in  the  Erl  group  compared  to  1  in  the  Erl+Bv  group.  The  incidence  of  Grade  3  AEs  is

higher in the Erl+Bv group, and seems to be explained by the higher exposure to bevacizumab.

bevacizumab was discontinued in the Erl+Bv group was 11 subjects (14.7%). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
In Study JO25567, the only AE leading to death seen during the clinical trial was one patient (1.3%) in 
the  Erl  arm  who  died  due  to  drowning  during  the  clinical  trial  period.  No  patient  in  the  Erl+Bv  group 
died  due  to  an  AE.  The  patient  in  the  Erl  group  was  a  67  year-old  female  and  the  drowning  event 
occurred  on  Day  40  since start  of  erlotinib  administration.  Although  unknown  whether  the  death  was 
an  accident  or  suicide,  the  investigator  assessed  that  the  causal  relationship  with  erlotinib  was 
“unlikely related.” 
The primary cause of PD-related deaths was not recorded. With regard to non-PD related deaths, there 
were only 3 cases: in the Erl+Bv group one patient died of pneumocystis pneumonia, in the Erl group 
one patient died due to drowning and one patient died due to thrombosis. 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
The overall incidence of SAEs was 25.3% vs. 24.7%, in Erl+Bv group and Erl group respectively. There 
is  a  tendency  to  more infections  in  the  Erl+Bv  arm,  but  no  apparent  pattern  could  be  observed.  One 
case of cancer (pancreatic cancer) was observed in the Erl+Bv group. On the other hand two cases of 
neoplasms  (lipoma  and  nasal  cavity  cancer)  were  observed  in  the  Erl  group.  No  conclusions  can  be 
drawn based on these few cases.  Eight cases of hepatobiliary disorders were observed in the Erl group 
compared to 0 in the Erl+Bv group. 5 out of 8 were classified as “hepatic function abnormal”.

Vital signs, physical findings and other observations related to safety 
Blood pressure  
In  Study  JO25567,  hypertension  (including  increase  in  blood  pressure)  as  an  AE  was  seen  in  59 
patients (78.7%) in the Erl + Bv arm and 11 patients (14.3%) in the Erl arm.  Throughout the clinical 
trial  period,  diastolic  blood  pressure  tended  to  be  somewhat  higher  in  the  Erl + Bv  arm,  but  with 
systolic  blood  pressure,  no  marked  changes  in  median  values  were  seen  in  either  arm  at  any  point 
during the clinical trial period. 
Body weight  
Decrease in body weight as an AE was seen in 33 patients (44.0%) in the Erl + Bv arm and 19 patients 
(24.7%) in the Erl arm.  No marked changes were seen in either arm at any point during the clinical 
trial period. 
Other vital signs  
No marked changes were seen in either arm at any point during the clinical trial period with respect to 
any of the other vital signs.

Other studies 
In Study BO20571, vital signs (weight, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure and pulse rate) 
were  summarized  for  the  overall  safety  analysis  population  (absolute  values  and  changes  from 
baseline) and these data did not raise any safety concerns. 
In  Study  AVF3671g,  clinically  significant  abnormalities  for  vital  signs,  physical  findings,  and  other 
observations related to safety were reported as AEs and summarized as the appropriate AE category. 
In Study OSI3364g, vital signs were taken at baseline and every 3 weeks during infusion. Each of the 
groups  showed  a  slight  increase  from  baseline  in  mean  diastolic  and  systolic  blood  pressures.  The 
mean diastolic blood pressure among Erl + Bv patients was approximately 1−3 mmHg higher than that 
among  Erl + Pl  patients,  and  the  mean  systolic  blood  pressure  among  Erl + Bv  patients  was 
approximately  5−10  mmHg  higher  than  that  among  Erl + Pl  patients.    These  observations  were 
consistent  with  the  AE  reporting  of  blood  pressure  increased  under  the  MedDRA  system  organ  class 
term  of  Investigation)  in  6  patients  (1.9%)  in  the Erl + Bv  arm  versus  in  1  patient  (0.3%)  in  Erl + Pl 
arm and of hypertension in 79 patients (25.2%) in the Erl + Bv arm versus in 27 patients (8.6%) in the 
Erl + Pl arm. 
Safety in special populations 
Male patients have a higher incidence of AEs than females, however, no differences in the AE pattern is 
observed between males and females. With regard to “age”, there seems to be higher incidence of SAE 
in  elderly  (>75  years)  in  the  Erl+Bv  group.  This  difference  was  not  observed  in  the  Erl  group. 
However, the number of patients over 75 years is low in both groups.  
With  regard  to  ECOG,  patients  with  PS  0  experienced  more  Grade>=3  AEs  in  Erl+Bv  group,  while 
patients  with  ECOG  PS  1  experienced  more  Grade  ≥3  AEs  in  the  Erl  group.  The  main  drivers  are 
hypertension and proteinuria. Both AEs are known AESIs related to the use of bevacizumab.  
With regard to AE profile as function of smoking, no clinically relevant differences could be observed. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Overall,  the  pharmacokinetics  drug-drug  interaction  (PK-DDI)  data  available  to  date  for  bevacizumab 
given in combination with erlotinib (described below) do not suggest a potential for a PK-DDI between 
bevacizumab  and  erlotinib.    Therefore,  safety  concerns  are  not  expected  from  pharmacokinetic 
interaction between bevacizumab and erlotinib. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In  Study  JO25567,  discontinuation  of  one  component  of  study  treatment  did  not  necessitate 
discontinuation of both drugs. The higher proportion of patients with AEs leading to discontinuation of 
study treatment in the Erl+Bv arm (Erl: 18.2% vs. Erl+Bv: 45.3%) was primarily driven by proteinuria 
and hemorrhagic events (epistaxis and haemorrhoidal haemorrhage). 
There were no new safety findings, but a considerable number of patients in the Erl+Bv withdrew from 
Bv  because  of  AEs.  However,  patients  in  the  Erl+Bv  arm  received  a  median  of  15.5  cycles  of 
bevacizumab,  which  is  considered  a  relatively  high  exposure.  Having  this  in  mind,  the  observed 
difference in withdrawal rate must somewhat be expected.  
In the Erl+Bv group there was 34 AEs that led to the discontinuation of bevacizumab. Twenty-one of 
the 34 AEs are resolved or resolving. The unresolved events were related to proteinuria.  
There  are  more  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  in  patients  older  than  65  years.  However,  there  is  no 
difference in AE pattern between age groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/510480/2015 
Page 48/68 
 
 
 
 
 
There seems to be more AEs in elderly patients, but the AEs pattern is comparable between different 
age groups. 
Adverse Events that Led to Dose Modification or Interruption 
A  total  of  27  patients  (36.0%)  in  the  Erl+Bv  group  experienced  an  AE  leading  to  withholding  of 
bevacizumab.  The  AEs  were  both  AESIs  related  to  bevacizumab  and  erlotinib.  A  similar  number  of 
patients in both groups experienced an AE that led to erlotinib dose reduction. Slightly more patients 
(44(57.1%) vs. 51(68%)) in the Erl+Bv group experienced an AE that led to withholding of erlotinib.  
Overall, there are more dose modifications and interruptions in the Erl+Bv group. However, this may 
also be expected when combining these two treatments.  
The  main  reasons  for  dose  interruption  in  the  Erl+Bv  group  were  hypertension,  proteinuria,  rash, 
dermatitis,  haemoptysis,  periodontal  disease  and  paronychia.  None  of  the  events  of  proteinuria 
resolved  and  only  80%  of  the  events  of  hypertension  resolved.  The  majority  of  the  rest  of  AEs 
resolved. 
The  most  common  AEs  leading  to  erlotinib  dose  modification  or  interruption  were  skin  and  nail 
disorders.  These  AEs  were  most  likely  to  stay  unresolved  with  sequalae.  However,  these  AEs  can  be 
treated in the clinical setting and often patients continue treatment.  
Post marketing experience 
Bevacizumab  in  combination  with  intravenous  5-fluorouracil–based  chemotherapy  for  the  first-line 
treatment  of  patients  with  metastatic  carcinoma  of  the  colon  or  rectum  was  approved  in  the  United 
States on 26 February 2004 and in the EU on 12 January 2005. The total number of patients exposed 
to  bevacizumab  in  the  postmarketing  setting,  across  indications,  from  the  International  Birth  Date 
(IBD) up to 25 February 2015 is estimated to be approximately 2,048,911 patients.

Duration  of  safety  follow-up  in  the  pivotal  and  supporting  studies  was  until  resolution  or  up  to  28-30 
days after the last dose of study treatment. The duration of safety follow-up is considered acceptable.  
All  the  common  AEs  are  well-known  and  clinically  manageable.  Exposure  adjusted  incidence  of 
dermatitis and paronychia show that in the case of paronychia it seems that the addition of Bv to Erl 
leads to an increased incidence. The Applicant has reflected this in the SmPC. 
The  overall  number  of  patients  with  Grade  ≥3  AEs  is  higher  in  the  Erl+Bv  group.  There  are  slightly 
more  infections  in  the  Erl+Bv  group,  but  no  clear  pattern  is  observed.  There  are  considerable  more 
patients  experiencing  hypertension  in  the  Erl+Bv  group,  which  is  expected,  however,  there  are  very 
few  discontinuations  due  to  hypertension.    Other  common  AEs  are  paronychia  and  dermatitis 
acneiform,  which  mostly  are  associated  with  erlotinib,  but  seems  to  occur  more  frequently  in  the 
Erl+Bv group. Hypertension, proteinuria, epistaxis and decreased weight, which are mainly associated 
with bevacizumab, are also seen frequently in the Erl+Bv group. 
The  incidence  of  all  grade  AESI  for  Bv  and  Erl  show  some  clear  differences.  There  are  considerably 
more bleedings, hypertension and proteinuria in the Erl+Bv group. With regard to AESI related to Erl 
there are no major differences between the two groups. Thus, the main differences are driven by AESI 
related to bevacizumab. Both erlotinib and bevacizumab are associated with GI perforation. However, 
the combination of these two products do not seem to increase the number of GI perforation.

Most  Grade  ≥3  AESI  are  related  to  hypertension,  proteinuria  and  rash.  No  events  of  GI  perforation, 
PRLS,  wound  healing  complications  and  CHF  are  observed.  Very  few  events  of  ATE  and  VTE  are 
observed. 
Rash  is  a  well-known  AESI  that  is  associated  with  good  response  to  erlotinib.  No  major  differences 
were  seen  in  the  overall  number  of  AEs,  SAEs  and  in  treatment  discontinuation.  The  addition  of 
bevacizumab  to  erlotinib  does  not  seem  to  have  a  detrimental  effect  with  regard  to  this  prognostic 
AESI. 
The  addition  of  erlotinib  to  bevacizumab  seems  to  lead  to  an  increased  number  of  haemorrhagic 
events. However, most of the bleeding events were Grade 1-2 epistaxis, and in most cases the event 
was  manageable  and  did  not  lead  to  discontinuation  of  bev.  Only  two  Grade  3  AEs  haemorrhagic 
events  were  observed  in  the  Erl+Bv  group.  The  bleeding  events  did  not  have  any  major  clinical 
implications. In addition, this fact should be seen in light of the higher exposure to study treatments in 
the Erl+Bv group.  
Concerning  hypertension,  only  2  events  led  to  treatment  discontinuation,  which  reflects  the  fact  that 
this event is clinically manageable. The majority of the hypertension AEs had a peak severity of Grade 
≥3.  The  Applicant  has  revised  the  SmPC  to  reflect  the  findings  in  study  JO25567.  Patients  with  prior 
hypertension  are  at  increased  risk  of  developing  proteinuria.  Eleven  (11)  patients  discontinued 
treatment  and  6  patients  experienced  a  peak  severity  of  Grade  ≥  3  proteinuria.  With  regard  to  AESI 
related to Erl there are no major differences between the two groups. Thus, the main differences are 
driven  by  AESIs  related  to  bevacizumab.  No  events  of  GI  perforation,  PRLS,  wound  healing 
complications and CHF are observed. Very few events of ATE and VTE are observed. This is reassuring. 
No AESIs led to death.  
The  majority  of  deaths  across  all  studies  were  due  to  disease  progression.  In  the  pivotal  Study 
JO25567: No patients died in the Erl + Bv arm due to an AE. The only AE leading to death seen during 
this  clinical  trial  was  one  patient  (1.3%)  in  the  Erl  arm  who  died  due  to  drowning  during  the  clinical 
trial period.   
The incidence of SAEs was similar between the Erl + Bv and Erl treatment arms (Erl: 24.7% vs. Erl + 
Bv: 25.3%) in Study JO25567. 
Male  patients  seem  to  have  more  AEs,  but  the  AE  profile  is  comparable  between  genders.  There  are 
too few patients over 75 years to draw any conclusion. A divergent picture is observed with regard to 
ECOG score between the two groups, but the main drivers are hypertension and proteinuria, which are 
known AESIs related to bevacizumab. 
Overall, the AEs leading to dose modification or interruption are well-known AESIs related to Bv or Erl. 
The unresolved AEs are well-known and well-characterised, and reflected in the SmPC. These AEs are 
often clinically manageable. 
There were no new safety findings, but a considerable number of patients in the Erl+Bv withdrew from 
Bv  because  of  AEs.  However,  patients  in  the  Erl+Bv  arm  received  a  median  of  15.5  cycles  of 
bevacizumab,  which  is  considered  a  relatively  high  exposure.  Having  this  in  mind,  the  observed 
difference in withdrawal rate must somewhat be expected. In the Erl+Bv group there was 34 AEs that 
led  to  the  discontinuation  of  bevacizumab.  Twenty-one  of  the  34  AEs  are  resolved  or  resolving.  The 
unresolved events were related to proteinuria. 
Overall, males seem to have more AEs, but the AE profile is comparable between genders. There are 
too few patients over 75 years to draw any conclusion. A divergent picture is observed with regard to

ECOG score between the two groups, but the main drivers are hypertension and proteinuria, which are 
known AESIs related to bevacizumab. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
There  were  no  new  safety  findings,  but  the  incidence  rate  for  some  of  these  AEs  and  the 
discontinuation rate was higher  in the combination group. The reason(s) for this high incidence rate is 
most  likely  due  to  longer exposure  to  study  treatments  in  the  Erl+Bv  group.  No  imbalance  in  deaths 
was  observed  in  the  pivotal  study,  in  the  Erl+Bv  arm  vs  Erl  arm.  The  safety  findings  are  in  general 
clinically manageable and do not give rise to any major concern.

Bleeding/ Hemorrhage  
EU SPC section 4.4: 
Additional risk 
minimization 
measures 
None proposed 
Patients treated with Avastin have an 
increased risk of haemorrhage, especially 
tumour-associated haemorrhage. Avastin 
should be discontinued permanently in patients 
who experience Grade 3 or 4 bleeding during 
Avastin therapy (NCI-CTCAE v.3) (see section 
4.8). 
Patients with untreated CNS metastases were 
routinely excluded from clinical trials with 
Avastin, based on imaging procedures or signs 
and symptoms. Therefore, the risk of CNS 
haemorrhage in such patients has not been 
prospectively evaluated in randomised clinical 
trials (see section 4.8). Patients should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of CNS 
bleeding, and Avastin treatment discontinued 
in cases of intracranial bleeding.  
There is no information on the safety profile of 
Avastin in patients with congenital bleeding 
diathesis, acquired coagulopathy or in patients 
receiving full dose of anticoagulants for the 
treatment of thromboembolism prior to 
starting Avastin treatment, as such patients 
were excluded from clinical trials. Therefore, 
caution should be exercised before initiating 
therapy in these patients. However, patients 
who developed venous thrombosis while 
receiving therapy did not appear to have an 
increased rate of Grade 3 or above bleeding 
when treated with a full dose of warfarin and 
Avastin concomitantly (NCI-CTCAE v.3). 
Labelled in section 4.8 of the EU SPC 
Pulmonary hemorrhage 
EU SPC section 4.4:  
None proposed 
Patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated 
with Avastin may be at risk of serious, and in 
some cases fatal, pulmonary 
haemorrhage/haemoptysis. Patients with 
recent pulmonary haemorrhage/ haemoptysis 
(> 2.5 ml of red blood) should not be treated 
with Avastin. 
Proteinuria

Patients with a history of hypertension may be 
at increased risk for the development of 
proteinuria when treated with Avastin. There is

related to the dose. Monitoring of proteinuria 
by dipstick urinalysis is recommended prior to 
starting and during therapy. Grade 4 
proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) was seen in 
up to 1.4% of patients treated with Avastin. 
Therapy should be permanently discontinued in 
patients who develop Grade 4 proteinuria 
(nephrotic syndrome) (NCI-CTCAE v.3).

In clinical trials, the incidence of arterial 
thromboembolic reactions including 
cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), transient 
ischaemic attacks (TIAs) and myocardial 
infarctions (MIs) was higher in patients 
receiving Avastin in combination with 
chemotherapy compared to those who received 
chemotherapy alone. 
Patients receiving Avastin plus chemotherapy, 
with a history of arterial thromboembolism, 
diabetes or age greater than 65 years have an 
increased risk of developing arterial 
thromboembolic reactionsduring therapy. 
Caution should be taken when treating these 
patients with Avastin.  
Therapy should be permanently discontinued in 
patients who develop arterial thromboembolic 
reactions. 
Labelled in section 4.8 of the EU SPC. 
Hypertension 
EU SPC section 4.4:  
None proposed 
An increased incidence of hypertension was 
observed in Avastin-treated patients. Clinical 
safety data suggest that the incidence of 
hypertension is likely to be dose-dependent. 
Pre existing hypertension should be adequately 
controlled before starting Avastin treatment. 
There is no information on the effect of Avastin 
in patients with uncontrolled hypertension at 
the time of initiating therapy. Monitoring of 
blood pressure is generally recommended 
during therapy. 
In most cases hypertension was controlled 
adequately using standard antihypertensive 
treatment appropriate for the individual 
situation of the affected patient. The use of 
diuretics to manage hypertension is not 
advised in patients who receive a cisplatin-
based chemotherapy regimen. Avastin should 
be permanently discontinued if medically

Labelled in section 4.8 of the EU SPC. 
Congestive heart failure 
EU SPC section 4.4: 
None proposed 
Reactions consistent with CHF were reported in 
clinical trials. The findings ranged from 
asymptomatic declines in left ventricular 
ejection fraction to symptomatic CHF, requiring 
treatment or hospitalisation. Caution should be 
exercised when treating patients with clinically 
significant cardiovascular disease such as pre-
existing coronary artery disease, or congestive 
heart failure with Avastin. 
Most of the patients who experienced CHF had 
metastatic breast cancer and had received 
previous treatment with anthracyclines, prior 
radiotherapy to the left chest wall or other risk 
factors for CHF were present. 
In patients in AVF3694g who received 
treatment with anthracyclines and who had not 
received anthracyclines before, no increased 
incidence of all Grade CHF was observed in the 
anthracycline + bevacizumab group compared 
to the treatment with anthracyclines only. CHF 
Grade 3 or higher reactions were somewhat 
more frequent among patients receiving 
bevacizumab in combination with 
chemotherapy than in patients receiving 
chemotherapy alone. This is consistent with 
results in patients in other studies of 
metastatic breast cancer who did not receive 
concurrent anthracycline treatment (NCI-
CTCAE v.3). 
Labelled in section 4.8 of the EU SPC. 
Wound healing 
complications 
EU SPC section 4.4:

Avastin may adversely affect the wound 
healing process. Serious wound healing 
complications, including anastomotic 
complications, with a fatal outcome have been 
reported. Therapy should not be initiated for at 
least 28 days following major surgery or until 
the surgical wound is fully healed. In patients 
who experienced wound healing complications 
during therapy, treatment should be withheld 
until the wound is fully healed. Therapy should 
be withheld for elective surgery.

Gastrointestinal 
perforations 
EU SPC section 4.4: Gastrointestinal  
perforations and Fistulae (see section 4.8)   
None proposed 
Patients may be at an increased risk for the 
development of gastrointestinal perforation 
and gall bladder perforation when treated with 
Avastin. Intra-abdominal inflammatory process 
may be a risk factor for gastrointestinal 
perforations in patients with metastatic 
carcinoma of the colon or rectum, therefore, 
caution should be exercised when treating 
these patients. Prior radiation is a risk factor 
for GI perforation in patients treated for 
persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical 
cancer with Avastin and all patients with GI 
perforation had a history of prior radiation. 
Therapy should be permanently discontinued in 
patients who develop gastrointestinal 
perforation. 
GI-vaginal Fistulae in study GOG-0240 
Patients treated for persistent, recurrent, or 
metastatic cervical cancer with Avastin are at 
increased risk of fistulae between the vagina 
and any part of the GI tract (Gastrointestinal-
vaginal fistulae). Prior radiation is a major risk 
factor for the development of GI-vaginal 
fistulae and all patients with GI-vaginal fistulae 
had a history of prior radiation. Recurrence of 
cancer within the field of prior radiation is an 
additional important risk factor for the 
development of GI-vaginal fistulae.

to 2.7% (including gastrointestinal fistula and 
abscess) in patients with metastatic colorectal 
cancer.   
From a clinical trial in patients with persistent, 
recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study 
GOG-0240), GI perforations (all grade) were 
reported in 3.2% of patients, all of whom had 
a history of prior pelvic radiation 
The occurrence of these events varied in type 
and severity, ranging from free air seen on the 
plain abdominal X-ray, which resolved without 
treatment, to intestinal perforation with 
abdominal abscess and fatal outcome. In some 
cases underlying intra-abdominal inflammation 
was present, either from gastric ulcer disease, 
tumour necrosis, diverticulitis, or 
chemotherapy-associated colitis. 
Fatal outcome was reported in approximately a 
third of serious cases of gastrointestinal 
perforations, which represents between 0.2%-
1% of all Avastin treated patients. 
In Avastin clinical trials, gastrointestinal 
fistulae (all grade) have been reported with an 
incidence of up to 2% in patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer and ovarian 
cancer, but were also reported less commonly 
in patients with other types of cancer. 
GI-vaginal Fistulae in study GOG-0240 
In a trial of patients with persistent, recurrent 
or metastatic cervical cancer, the incidence of 
GI-vaginal fistulae was 8.3% in Avastin treated 
patients and 0.9% in control patients, all of 
whom had a history of prior pelvic radiation. 
The frequency of GI-vaginal fistulae in the 
group treated with Avastin + chemotherapy 
was higher in patients with recurrence within 
the field of prior radiation (16.7%) compared 
with patients with recurrence outside the field 
of prior radiation (3.6%). The corresponding 
frequencies in the control group receiving 
chemotherapy alone were 1.1% vs. 0.8%, 
respectively. Patients who develop GI-vaginal 
fistulae may also have bowel obstructions and 
require surgical intervention as well as 
diverting ostomies.

Uncommon ( ≥ 0.1% to < 1%) reports of 
fistulae that involve areas of the body other 
than the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. 
bronchopleural and biliary fistulae) were 
observed across various indications. Fistulae 
have also been reported in post-marketing

may be a risk factor for gastrointestinal 
perforations in patients with metastatic 
carcinoma of the colon or rectum, therefore, 
caution should be exercised when treating 
these patients. Prior radiation is a risk factor 
for GI perforation in patients treated for 
persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical 
cancer with Avastin and all patients with GI 
perforation had a history of prior 
radiation. Therapy should be permanently 
discontinued in patients who develop 
gastrointestinal perforation.

for which ONJ is an identified risk. Caution 
should be exercised when Avastin and 
intravenous bisphosphonates are administered 
simultaneously or sequentially. 
Invasive dental procedures are also an 
identified risk factor. A dental examination and 
appropriate preventive dentistry should be 
considered prior to starting the treatment with 
Avastin. In patients who have previously

Wound healing complications  
Avastin may adversely affect the wound 
healing process. Serious wound healing 
complications, including anastomotic 
complications, with a fatal outcome have been 
reported. Therapy should not be initiated for at 
least 28 days following major surgery or until 
the surgical wound is fully healed. In patients 
who experienced wound healing complications 
during therapy, treatment should be withheld 
until the wound is fully healed. Therapy should 
be withheld for elective surgery.  
Necrotising fasciitis, including fatal cases, has 
rarely been reported in patients treated with 
Avastin. This condition is usually secondary to 
wound healing complications, gastrointestinal 
perforation or fistula formation. Avastin 
therapy should be discontinued in patients who 
develop necrotising fasciitis, and appropriate 
treatment should be promptly initiated.

Pregnancy 
There are no clinical trial data on the use of 
Avastin in pregnant women. Studies in animals 
have shown reproductive toxicity including 
malformations (see section 5.3). IgGs are 
known to cross the placenta, and Avastin is 
anticipated to inhibit angiogenesis in the 
foetus, and thus is suspected to cause serious 
birth defects when administered during 
pregnancy. In the postmarketing setting, cases 
of foetal abnormalities in women treated with 
bevacizumab alone or in combination with 
known embryotoxic chemotherapeutics have 
been observed (see section 4.8). Avastin is

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Study  JO25567  showed  a  clinically  and  statistically  significant  difference  in  favour  of  Erl+Bv  in  the 
treatment  of  non-squamous  NSCLC  in  terms  of  PFS.  Treatment  with  Erl+Bv  provides  a  considerably 
longer period without progression (median PFS 16.0 months for Erl+Bv versus 9.7 months for Erl). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Based on the updated OS (cut-off 28 October 2015) there seems to be no detrimental effect of Bv on 
OS.  However,  due  to  the  multitude  of  additional  lines  of  treatment  and  anti-cancer  agents  used,  the 
OS data is difficult to interpret. In addition, the data are still not mature at this time point, and thus 
the Applicant is asked to provide mature OS post-approval (see Annex II condition). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The  overall  number  of  patients  with  Grade  ≥3  AEs  is  higher  in  the  Erl+Bv  group  (41(53%)  vs.  68 
(91%)). There are considerably more patients experiencing hypertension in the Erl+Bv group, which is 
expected, however, there are very few discontinuations due to hypertension.  Other common AEs are 
paronychia  and  dermatitis  acneiform,  which  are  mainly  associated  with  erlotinib,  but  seem  to  occur 
more frequently in the Erl+Bv group. Hypertension, proteinuria, epistaxis and decreased weight, which 
are mainly associated with bevacizumab, are also seen frequently in the Erl+Bv group. 
Assessment report

The addition of erlotinib to bevacizumab seems to lead to an increased number of haemorrhagic events 
(mostly epistaxis). Eight cases of hepatobiliary disorders were observed in the Erl group compared to 0 
in the Erl+Bv group. 5 out of 8 were classified as “hepatic function abnormal”.  
Finally,  discontinuations  due  to  adverse  events  are  considerably  more  often  observed  in  the  Erl+Bv 
group.  More  than  one  third  of  the  withdrawals  in  the  Erl+Bv  group  are  due  to  proteinuria  and 
haemorrhage. There are also more dose modifications and interruptions in the Erl+Bv group.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Patients  with  EGFR-mutated  non-squamous  NSCLC  are  often  faced  with  rapid  progression  and  death. 
The  use  of  TKI  targeted  at  EGFR  activating  mutations  has  prolonged  PFS  and  OS.  The  addition  of 
bevacizumab  to  erlotinib  in  the  first-line  setting  seems  to  prolong  PFS  even  more.  Thus,  the  time  to 
second-line therapy is extended considerably. This is considered of clinical relevance.  
The  combination  of  erlotinib  and  bevacizumab  leads  to  more  AEs,  discontinuations  and  dose 
modifications of treatment. However, the toxicity was generally manageable with dose modification or 
interruptions. No patient in the Erl+Bv group died due to a treatment-related AE. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Overall,  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  erlotinib  in  the  treatment  of 
EGFR-mutated non-squamous NSCLC patients is considered positive due to the clinically relevant PFS 
gain, which outweighs the toxicity. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Study JO25567 met its primary endpoint. The primary endpoint, PFS by IRC, shows a clear difference 
in  favour  of  the  Erl+Bv  group.  The  difference  is  both  statistically  and  clinically  significant.  Treatment

with  Erl+Bv  provides  a  longer  period  without  progression,  thus,  prolonging  the  time  to  second-line 
therapy. The p-value for the HR is highly statistically significant. 
PFS by exon 21 L858R mutation and exon 19 deletion are in line with the overall estimate. 
The subgroup analysis of PFS shows that the point estimate for all the different subgroups is below 1. 
Looking  at  PFS  by  mutation  status,  patients  with  exon  19  deletion  seems  to  have  a  greater  effect  of 
Erl+Bv. There has been some discussion in the scientific community whether the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs 
differs between exon 19 deletion and exon 21 L858R mutation. There seems to be some evidence that 
exon 19 deletion might the associated with longer PFS.  
With regard to the secondary endpoints, there is no difference in OS between the two groups. The OS 
data is considered immature at present due to insufficient follow-up. A slight difference in favour of the 
Erl+Bv  group  with  regard  to  overall  response  is  observed,  but  the  actual  difference  in  number  of 
patients  is  very  small.  The  MAH  will  provide  mature  OS  data  from  study  JO25567  (see  Annex  II 
condition).  
Although response rate was quite similar between treatment arms (64% in Erl vs. 69% in Erl+Bv) the 
duration  of  response  was  13.3  months  in  Erl+Bv  group  compared  to  9.3  months  in  Erl  group.  This 
difference is considered clinically relevant and correlates very well with PFS data. Thus, it seems that 
the effect of erlotinib is maintained for a longer time with the addition of bevacizumab, and this is of 
clinical  importance  in  a  disease  with  a  very  aggressive  course.  The  observed  difference  in  PFS  is 
clinically  relevant,  the  point  estimate  is  robust,  and  the  study  has  met  its  primary  endpoint.  The 
observed median PFS in the Erl group is in line with previous findings.  
There  were  no  new  safety  findings,  but  the  incidence  rate  for  some  of  these  AEs  and  the 
discontinuation rate was higher in the combination group. The reason(s) for this high incidence rate is 
most  likely  due  to  longer exposure  to  study  treatments  in  the  Erl+Bv  group.  No  imbalance  in  deaths 
was  observed  in  the  pivotal  study,  in  the  Erl+Bvarm  vs  Erl  arm.  The  safety  findings  are  in  general 
clinically manageable and do not raise major concern. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
The MAH should submit mature overall survival data for study JO25567 and discuss any further 
outcome data on the combination of bevacizumab + erlotinib in NSCLC patients with EGFR activating 
mutations (e.g. data from the ongoing ACCRU study, NCT number NCT01532089) by December 2018.

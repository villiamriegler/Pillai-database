Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC assessment report on the PSUR for bosutinib, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
A review of the cardiovascular events received during this reporting interval found five cases of 
increased blood pressure (including three serious cases) and one cerebrovascular accident (serious). 
Although these cases were inconclusive for an association between bosutinib exposure and 
hypertension, increased reporting rates of the events of hypertension was shown in clinical trials in 
comparison to imatinib, with hypertension being one of the most commonly reported cardiovascular 
adverse events. In clinical trials, hypertension was reported in about 7.7% patients (cut-off date of 
2014) in 1st, 2nd and later lines of bosutinib therapy, including 1.2% events considered drug-related. 
In view of the above, it is considered that hypertension should be reflected as common adverse 
reaction in the product information for Bosulif. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding Bosulif, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for bosutinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product containing bosutinib is favourable subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.

Centralised Procedure 
Brief description of the product: 
Hyperlink to the Product Information: 
Chemical class:  small interfering ribonucleic 
acid (siRNA) 
Summary of mode of action:  Amvuttra 
(vutrisiran) is a chemically stabilized 
double-stranded siRNA that specifically targets 
variant and wild-type transthyretin (TTR) 
messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and is 
covalently linked to a ligand containing 
three N-acetylgalactosamine residues to enable 
delivery of the siRNA to hepatocytes.  The 
chemical modification of the oligonucleotide 
leads to enhanced hepatic stability and 
prolonged liver residence time and thereby 
allowing for infrequent dosing. 
Through a natural process called RNA 
interference (RNAi), vutrisiran causes the 
catalytic degradation of TTR mRNA in the liver, 
resulting in the reduction of variant and wild-
type serum TTR protein levels and potentially 
enabling a reduction of TTR amyloid deposits in 
affected tissues. 
Important information about its composition:  
The active moiety is vutrisiran, and the active 
ingredient is vutrisiran sodium.  
Amvuttra is supplied as a 0.5 mL solution 
containing 25 mg vutrisiran in a single-use 1 mL 
pre-filled syringe with a needle shield.

PART II   SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
PART II: MODULE SI EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE INDICATION AND 
TARGET POPULATION 
Treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) in 
adult patients with stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy 
Hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) is a rare, autosomal 
dominant, progressive disease caused by variants in the transthyretin (TTR) gene.  
Historically, 2 clinical syndromes of hATTR amyloidosis have been described:  hATTR 
amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (previously known as familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy) 
and hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (previously known as familial amyloidotic 
cardiomyopathy), both of which are characterised by amyloid deposits of both variant and 
wild type (wt) TTR.[Ando 2013]  As hATTR amyloidosis is a systemic disease with amyloid 
deposition in multiple organs, the majority of patients manifest signs and symptoms of both 
neuropathy and cardiomyopathy and thus the terminology has evolved, referring to 
1 hereditary disease with a spectrum of clinical manifestations rather than attempting to 
classify the disease into 2 distinct syndromes.[Benson 2018; Coelho 2013; Swiecicki 2015]  
However, historical prevalence data separately describe hATTR amyloidosis with either 
polyneuropathy or cardiomyopathy, or disease by genotype.[Rapezzi 2013; Schmidt 2018] 
The literature provides very limited incidence and prevalence data for hATTR amyloidosis.  
This is due to the fact that this is a rare disease with varying endemicity and penetrance 
(i.e., the probability of the genetic variation causing the disease) not only by genotype, but 
also by region within the same genotype.[Planté-Bordeneuve 2003]  Misdiagnosis due to the 
variation in presentation and age of onset adds to the challenges in estimating incidence and 
prevalence of the disease.[Adams 2016; Conceicao 2016] 
The epidemiology of hATTR amyloidosis is summarised in Table 2. 
Table 2: 
Epidemiology of hATTR Amyloidosis 
Incidence 
Global estimates of incidence of hATTR amyloidosis are not available in the literature.  However, 
in Portugal, where hATTR amyloidosis is endemic, mean incidence of hATTR amyloidosis with 
polyneuropathy over the 2010 to 2016 period was estimated to be 0.87 cases per 100,000 adults per 
year.[Ines 2018]  In general, while incidence may be estimated from prevalence data (described 
below), variability in both regional prevalence and estimates of survival limit the usefulness of such 
approximations.   
Prevalence 
Until 1990, hATTR amyloidosis was considered to be endemic to northern Portugal, northern 
Sweden, and 2 regions of Japan.  Since the 1990s, new endemic areas have been identified, and the 
disease has been reported in approximately 40 countries, including many countries in Europe, the 
United States (US), China, and India.[Adams 2019; Waddington Cruz 2016]  The prevalence of 
hATTR amyloidosis varies depending on TTR genotype and genetic penetrance, and therefore 
varies by region.  Furthermore, reports of penetrance have varied widely, even for the same variant.  
For example, the penetrance with the valine to methionine variant at position 30 in the TTR gene 
(V30M) has been reported to be as low as 28% in Cyprus [Dardiotis 2009] and as high as 91% in 
Portugal.[Planté-Bordeneuve 2003]

Amvuttra (vutrisiran) 
Although the majority of patients develop a mixed phenotype of polyneuropathy and 
cardiomyopathy and the terminology has evolved to refer to 1 hereditary disease with a spectrum of 
symptoms [Benson 2018; Coelho 2013; Swiecicki 2015], historical prevalence data separately 
describe hATTR amyloidosis with either polyneuropathy or cardiomyopathy, or disease by 
genotype.[Rapezzi 2013; Schmidt 2018]  The estimated prevalence of hATTR amyloidosis in 
various regions, phenotypes, and genotypes is presented below for patients with polyneuropathy 
and with cardiomyopathy.  
hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy:  
The global prevalence of hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy has been estimated to be 
~10,186 (range: 5,526–38,468) patients, with endemic clusters in Portugal, Sweden, and 
Japan.[Schmidt 2018]   
Portugal is known to have the largest cohort of patients with hATTR amyloidosis with 
polyneuropathy, with 99% of affected families carrying V30M.[Parman 2016]  The mean estimated 
crude prevalence in 2016 was 22.93 cases per 100,000 adults, which accounted for nearly 20% of 
worldwide patients.[Ines 2018]  In certain municipalities of northern Portugal, the prevalence is 
estimated to be as high as 3.95 cases per 2000 inhabitants (197.5 cases per 100,000 
individuals).[Ines 2015] 
In Sweden, the estimated prevalence of hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy is reported as 
250 cases (2.60 cases per 100,000 individuals),[Parman 2016] with certain regions of northern 
Sweden reporting prevalence rates as high as 104 cases per 100,000 individuals.[Sousa 1993] 
The prevalence of hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy in other nonendemic European 
countries including France, Italy, Germany, and Turkey is lower than that reported in endemic 
areas of Portugal and Sweden, ranging from 0.03 to 0.91 per 100,000.  Genetic heterogeneity is 
observed in nonendemic countries, although V30M is the prevalent variant in France, Germany, 
and Italy.[Parman 2016] 
In Japan, the prevalence of hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy is estimated to be lower than 
in Europe at 0.87-1.1 per million (0.099 per 100,000 individuals).  However, in endemic areas in 
Japan, prevalence estimates are as high as 15.5 per million (1.55 per 100,000 individuals) in 
Nagano prefecture.[Kato-Motozaki 2008] 
In the US, hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy is estimated to be approximately 2 in 
100,000 individuals (based on an estimate of 6400 total patients [Coelho 2016]).  
hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy: 
Among patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, infiltrative cardiomyopathy may 
be latent, but present in half of patients.[Adams 2019]  The worldwide prevalence of hATTR 
amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy is unknown, but it is almost certainly underdiagnosed, 
particularly in the older African American population where the valine to isoleucine variant at 
position 122 in the TTR gene (V122I) has been reported in up to 3.9%.[Jacobson 1996]  This 
variant has been shown to increase the risk of cardiac amyloid deposition, congestive heart failure, 
and death, and diagnosis of hATTR amyloidosis is often not considered in symptomatic patients 
from this population.[Buxbaum 2010; Dharmarajan 2012; Jacobson 2011; Jacobson 1997]  In 
contrast, the frequency of V122I is lower in Caucasian and Hispanic populations in the US (0.44% 
and 0%, respectively).[Jacobson 1997; Yamashita 2005]    
Demographics of the Target Population (Age, Sex, Race/Ethnic Origin) 
Sex and age at disease manifestation and diagnosis: 
Overall, hATTR amyloidosis clinical symptoms tend to manifest in adults, and thus the disease is 
typically diagnosed at the adult stage of life.[Ando 2013]  The onset of disease-related symptoms 
varies across different populations and genotypes, with the onset of symptoms occurring anywhere 
from 20 years of age onward.  Adult patients with the V30M TTR genotype can manifest the 
disease at age 30 to 50 years (early onset) or after age 50 years (late onset).  Patients with 
non-V30M TTR genotypes typically manifest the disease after age 50 years.

The Transthyretin Amyloidosis Outcomes Survey is a global, multicenter, longitudinal, 
observational survey to collect data on TTR amyloidosis (both hereditary and wt).  An evaluation 
of patients with hATTR amyloidosis who enrolled in this registry between December 2007 and 
September 2011 illustrated the variability among different countries and genotypes in not only age 
at onset, but distribution between male and female patients.  The median age of onset of symptoms 
for patients with the V30M variant was 33.9 years, compared with 54.5 years for patients with 
other variants, producing a bimodal age-of-onset distribution overall.  The male-to-female ratios 
reported in countries other than the US ranged from 0.7 in Portugal to 1.9 in Germany.  The male-
to-female ratio of patients from the US was 4.6.[Coelho 2013]   
The demographics and other characteristics of patients with hATTR amyloidosis who were 
enrolled in the randomised, global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 pivotal study of 
patisiran (ALN-TTR02-004; APOLLO) further illustrate the variability in these characteristics 
among patients with hATTR amyloidosis:  median age at entry was 62 years (range, 24-83 years), 
median time since diagnosis was 1.37 years (range, 0.0-21.0 years), 74.2% of patients were male, 
and 57.3% of patients had a non-V30M genotype (39 TTR variants overall).  Similar variability 
was observed in patients in the ongoing, global, Phase 3, randomised, open-label, study of 
vutrisiran (ALN-TTRSC02-002 [Study 002; HELIOS-A]):  median age at entry was 60 years 
(range, 26-85 years), median time since diagnosis was 2.2 years (range, 0.0-15.3 years), 64.6% of 
patients were male, and 54.9% had non-V30M variant (25 TTR variants overall). 
Race/ethnic origin of patients with hATTR amyloidosis: 
Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis is a world-wide disease and therefore occurs in patients across 
different races and ethnicities.   
The V30M variant occurs primarily in families originating from Portugal, Sweden, and Japan.  
Those patients with the V30M variant with a relatively early age of onset (30-50 years) are usually 
from endemic regions within those 3 countries and present with sensory neuropathy, autonomic 
dysfunction, and cardiac conduction disturbances.[Carvalho 1992; Soares 2005]  
Patients with late onset V30M (after age 50) and non-V30M variants, found in multiple different 
non-endemic regions throughout the world, present with motor neuropathy, in addition to sensory 
and autonomic neuropathy, and often have cardiomyopathy and/or heart wall thickening from 
cardiac amyloid involvement.[Ando 2013]  
Certain genotypes, such as the V122I variant found in up to 3.9% of African Americans, manifest 
as hATTR amyloidosis that usually starts with a cardiac-predominant phenotype but can then 
progress to include polyneuropathy in 30% to 50% of patients.[Buxbaum 2017; Jacobson 1997; 
Maurer 2016] 
Existing Treatment Options 
The treatment of hATTR amyloidosis requires a multidisciplinary approach primarily involving 
neurology, cardiology, and gastroenterology specialties.  Historically, palliative/symptomatic 
therapies directed at specific symptoms such as pain, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea have been the 
mainstay of treatment.   
Patisiran, a ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) therapeutic, is approved in the US, European 
Union (EU), Japan, and other regions for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR 
amyloidosis in adults.  Patisiran targets the production of TTR synthesis in the liver by acting on 
messenger RNA (mRNA) through RNAi.  Directly and specifically targeting the underlying 
pathophysiological basis of disease is critical to halting, and potentially reversing, the progression 
of disease and for providing highly effective therapy for patients with a broad range of disease 
severity and disease manifestations.  Treatment with patisiran, which directly targets hepatic 
synthesis of TTR, has been shown to result in improvements in neuropathy (modified neuropathy 
impairment score +7 [mNIS+7]), quality of life (Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy 
[Norfolk QoL-DN]), and multiple other disease manifestations compared to placebo in patients 
with hATTR amyloidosis who exhibited a broad range of disease severity and TTR 
genotypes.[Adams 2018; Adams 2021]  In the APOLLO study (which was the basis for the 
approval of patisiran), the magnitude of TTR reduction correlated with the improvement in

mNIS+7 score at 18 months, where a higher magnitude of TTR reduction led to greater 
improvements in mNIS+7 score at a population level.  In total, 56.1% of patisiran-treated patients 
demonstrated improvements from baseline in polyneuropathy scores during the study, compared to 
only 3.9% of placebo-treated patients.   
Inotersen, approved in the US, EU, and other countries for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of 
hATTR amyloidosis in adults, is an antisense oligonucleotide that targets the production of TTR 
synthesis in the liver via RNAse H-mediated cleavage of mRNA. Subcutaneous (SC) weekly 
injection of inotersen has been shown to decrease TTR and result in a significantly smaller increase 
(i.e., worsening) in mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL-DN than placebo after 66 weeks of 
treatment.[Benson 2018]  However, despite these benefits, the safety profile of inotersen is 
characterised by the serious risks of thrombocytopenia and glomerulonephritis, which are listed as 
warnings in product labelling due to the serious and potentially life‑threatening nature.[Akcea 
Therapeutics ; Benson 2017]  Both of these risks have been observed with other antisense 
oligonucleotide treatments.  Because of these risks, inotersen treatment requires frequent 
monitoring of platelet and renal function laboratory parameters.  In addition, inotersen is 
contraindicated in some patients, including patients with a platelet count less than 100 × 109/L and 
patients with a history of acute glomerulonephritis caused by inotersen. 
Tetramer stabilisers (tafamidis and diflunisal) are also used in clinical practice for the treatment of 
the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis but are associated with limitations in terms of efficacy 
and labeling.  
Tafamidis has been shown to delay peripheral neurologic impairment in early-stage patients with 
hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, but there is no evidence of its impact on clinical activity 
in patients with more advanced disease.  Furthermore, the majority of patients receiving tafamidis 
continue to experience neuropathy progression with a steady decline in quality of life, ability to 
walk, and to perform activities of daily living [Barroso 2017].  Tafamidis has been approved in 
several regions for the treatment of patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, 
including the EU (stage 1 polyneuropathy only) and Japan. 
Diflunisal, a generic, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, has been demonstrated to bind to 
and stabilise the TTR tetramer in a manner similar to tafamidis.  While used off-label in some 
countries where available, diflunisal is not an approved treatment for hATTR amyloidosis in any 
country.  In the US, diflunisal carries boxed warnings for cardiovascular thrombotic events and 
gastrointestinal risk.[Cadila Healthcare Limited 2017] 
Orthotopic liver transplantation eliminates variant TTR from the circulation but does not affect the 
hepatic production of wt TTR, which continues to be made by the transplanted liver.  Orthotopic 
liver transplantation is only effective in slowing the progression of disease in patients with an early 
age of onset (<50 years of age),[Okamoto 2009] especially for those with the V30M variant and 
short disease duration before transplant.  Consequently, almost two-thirds of patients with hATTR 
amyloidosis are not transplant-eligible.  Even when orthotopic liver transplantation is possible, 
morbidity and mortality are substantial; patients require life-long immunosuppressive medications, 
with their attendant risks of infection and renal injury.  One-year mortality rates of up to 10% have 
been reported.[Bispo 2009; Herlenius 2004; Okamoto 2009]  
Natural History of hATTR Amyloidosis  
Overall, hATTR amyloidosis is a rapidly progressive, multisystem disease that results in poor 
quality of life and premature death.  
In patients with hATTR amyloidosis, amyloid-mediated injury to large and small peripheral nerve 
fibers manifests clinically as a length-dependent symmetrical polyneuropathy. [Ando 2013; Benson 
2007; Plante-Bordeneuve 2011]  Sensory abnormalities include painful dysesthesias in the feet and 
hands, as well as loss of sensation, which may lead to thermal burns in these areas and to joint 
damage in the lower limbs.  Progressive muscle atrophy and motor weakness in both lower and 
upper limbs lead to impaired ambulation, and inability to perform activities of daily living.  Patients 
typically progress over several years from being able to walk without support, to the use of a 
walking stick for ambulation, then use of a wheelchair, and ultimately becoming bed ridden.

Autonomic dysfunction results in debilitating orthostatic hypotension leading to loss of 
consciousness, severe gastrointestinal symptoms (including early satiety, chronic nausea/vomiting, 
malnutrition/weight loss, and both diarrhea and constipation), and bladder dysfunction with 
recurrent urinary tract infections, as well as cardiac arrhythmias.  Renal amyloid deposition 
resulting in proteinuria and renal insufficiency can occur with V30M as well as other genotypes 
such as Gly47Glu and Ser77Tyr.[Lobato 2012] The rate of neuropathy progression is influenced by 
TTR genotype, age at symptom onset, and extent of neurologic impairment at time of diagnosis.   
In the heart, infiltration of cardiac tissue with amyloid leads to wall thickening and 
cardiomyopathy, manifested by heart failure due to diastolic and systolic dysfunction, as well as 
conduction disturbances and arrhythmias.[Ando 2013; Benson 2007; Carvalho 2015; Plante-
Bordeneuve 2011]  Similar to polyneuropathy, patients with more severe cardiac disease at the time 
of diagnosis experience rapid progression with substantial worsening of echocardiographic and 
biomarker measures of cardiac function, ambulation, and quality of life seen over a period of 18 
months or less.[Ruberg 2012]  In the APOLLO study, patients with echocardiographic evidence of 
cardiac amyloid involvement in the placebo group experienced substantial worsening of N-terminal 
pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), left ventricular end diastolic volume, and global 
longitudinal strain over 18 months. 
The constellation of progressive morbidity from amyloid infiltration in patients with hATTR 
amyloidosis results in severe disability, wasting due to gastrointestinal malabsorption, malnutrition, 
and cardiac cachexia.[Gertz 1992]  Death can result from heart failure (including sudden death 
caused by ventricular arrhythmias or electromechanical dissociation) or infection.[Plante-
Bordeneuve 2011]  The median survival is 4.7 years following diagnosis [Swiecicki 2015] with a 
reduced survival (3.4 years) for patients presenting with cardiomyopathy.[Castano 2015; Gertz 
1992; Sattianayagam 2012; Swiecicki 2015] 
Important Comorbidities 
Patients with hATTR amyloidosis often have poor nutritional status and overall wasting due in part 
to severe gastrointestinal manifestations including frequent episodes of diarrhea.[Antunes 2014]  
Furthermore, as late-onset disease manifests in the elderly, diseases commonly associated with 
aging such as osteoarthritis, ocular events, thyroid dysfunction, and malignancies are important 
comorbidities.  In addition to the ocular symptoms that present as manifestations of hATTR 
amyloidosis, dry eye has been reported, and decreases in visual acuity are noted as the disease 
progresses.[Ando 2013]  Depression may also be an important comorbidity as a result of this 
debilitating disease.[Lopes 2015; Rousseau 2013] 
Baseline comorbidities reported by APOLLO patients with hATTR amyloidosis with 
polyneuropathy (N=225) were generally consistent with the underlying disease of hATTR 
amyloidosis and were similar to baseline comorbidities reported by HELIOS-A patients with 
hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (N=164).  In APOLLO patients, the most frequently 
reported (≥50% of patients overall) medical history conditions at baseline were in the System 
Organ Classes (SOCs) of Nervous system disorders (86.2%), Gastrointestinal disorders (71.1%), 
Cardiac disorders (66.7%), Surgical and medical procedures (60.0%), and Vascular 
disorders (56.2%).  Eye disorders were reported by 44% of patients at baseline in APOLLO.  In 
HELIOS-A patients, the most frequently reported (≥50% of patients overall) medical history 
conditions at baseline were in the SOCs of Nervous system disorders (84.8%), Gastrointestinal 
disorders (70.7%), Cardiac disorders (68.9%), Eye disorders (52.4%), and Vascular 
disorders (50.0%).

PART II: MODULE SII  NONCLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY 
SPECIFICATION 
Executive Summary of Important Nonclinical Findings 
Vutrisiran binds to a conserved sequence in humans and monkeys, and thus is 
pharmacologically active in humans and monkeys, but not in rodents or rabbits.  There were 
no target organs of toxicity identified nonclinically when vutrisiran was administered on a 
once monthly (qM) schedule.  Nonadverse vutrisiran-related findings after qM vutrisiran 
administration were observed in the liver, kidney, injection sites, and inguinal lymph nodes.  
The liver is the primary site of vutrisiran uptake and accumulation.  In mice, vacuolation, 
enlargement/swelling, degeneration/necrosis, and/or increased hepatocellular glycogen were 
observed and occasionally correlated with slight alterations in clinical pathology parameters 
and increases in liver weights.  In rats, findings in liver included hepatocellular vacuolation, 
increased mitotic figures in hepatocytes, increased single cell necrosis, and increased 
basophilic foci of hepatocellular alteration and hepatocellular karyomegaly.  In monkeys, 
basophilic granules in Kupffer cells and/or hepatocytes were observed and likely represent 
accumulation of vutrisiran in these cells.[Frazier 2015; Janas 2018]  In the kidneys of rats, 
cytoplasmic basophilic granules, likely representing hematoxylin-stained vutrisiran, were 
present in the proximal tubules.[Frazier 2015; Janas 2018; Lenz 2018] The incidence and 
severity of this rat-specific finding did not progress with increased study duration.  Transient 
(≤24 hours) edema and/or erythema was observed at the SC injection site in rats.  
Microscopically, injection site findings included infiltrates of mixed inflammatory cells 
and/or vacuolated macrophages.  Vacuolated macrophages were also present in injection sites 
in mice (occasionally accompanied by fibroblast vacuolation) and in monkeys; the presence 
of these macrophages represented a normal phagocytic response.  In the lymph nodes of 
mice, rats, and monkeys, microscopic findings of vacuolated macrophages were not 
associated with any degenerative changes or clinical pathology correlates, did not progress 
with chronic dosing, most likely reflected uptake of vutrisiran, and were partially or fully 
reversed.  The no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) in the chronic repeat-dose studies 
were 150 mg/kg/qM in rats and 300 mg/kg/qM in monkeys, the highest doses evaluated. 
Serum transthyretin (TTR) is a carrier of retinol binding protein (RBP), which facilitates 
transport of vitamin A in the blood.  TTR also serves as a minor carrier for thyroxine (T4).  
Studies in monkeys confirmed the secondary pharmacological effects associated with 
reductions in TTR (up to 99%), namely reductions, relative to baseline, in vitamin A (up to 
89%) and T4 (up to 48%).  There were no findings in the eye, pituitary, or thyroid in 
monkeys (further explanation is provided in Table 3).  
In the safety pharmacology study in monkeys, there were no observed effects on 
electrocardiogram or hemodynamic parameters, respiratory rate, or body temperature.  
Neurological parameters, evaluated during repeat-dose toxicity studies in monkeys, were 
unaffected by vutrisiran administration at doses ≤300 mg/kg (highest dose tested). 
Evaluation of fertility (rats), embryo-foetal (rabbits), and postnatal development (rats) 
indicated no direct effects associated with exposure to vutrisiran; however, some adverse 
effects were noted in the rat embryo-foetal development study that were likely secondary to 
maternal toxicity/stress resulting from the exaggerated once daily dosing schedule during 
gestation.  Vutrisiran was not teratogenic in either rats or rabbits. Vutrisiran was not 
mutagenic or clastogenic and is not considered to have an immunostimulatory or 
immunotoxic potential.

Toxicity 
Target Organ Toxicity Identified from Acute and Repeat-Dose Toxicity Studies 
The liver is the primary site of vutrisiran 
uptake and accumulation.  Nonadverse 
vutrisiran-related findings were observed in 
the liver in repeat-dose toxicity studies 
conducted in rats and monkeys following 
once-monthly SC dose administration.  
There was no progression with chronic 
dosing, and the findings showed a trend of 
reversibility.   
Liver: 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice, vacuolation, 
enlargement/swelling, degeneration/necrosis, and/or 
increased hepatocellular glycogen were observed 
and occasionally correlated with slight alterations in 
clinical pathology parameters and increases in liver 
weights.  In the 13-week repeat-dose rat toxicity 
study, vacuolation, increased mitotic figures, 
necrosis, and basophilic foci were observed.  With 
exception of the basophilic foci, these findings 
partially or fully reversed after a 12-week recovery.  
Similar findings were observed in the 6-month 
repeat-dose rat toxicity study, and in general, 
findings increased in incidence and/or severity.  An 
exploratory 6-month study in rats evaluating dosing 
regimen (monthly vs every 3 months) suggests 
cumulative dose and/or schedule contribute to foci 
of hepatocellular alteration in rats, a finding not 
observed in other nonclinical species.  In rats, there 
were no clinical pathology correlates to any of the 
hepatic findings and they were not considered to be 
adverse.  In the 13-week repeat-dose toxicity study 
in monkeys, basophilic granules in Kupffer cells 
were seen at ≥100 mg/kg, which were partially 
reversed after a 12-week recovery.  In the 9-month 
repeat-dose monkey toxicity study, basophilic 
granules in Kupffer cells and/or hepatocytes were 
observed at ≥30 mg/kg (females) or ≥100 mg/kg 
(males).  The basophilic granules in Kupffer cells 
and/or hepatocytes likely represent accumulation of 
vutrisiran.[Frazier 2015; Janas 2018] These findings 
were not associated with any abnormal clinical 
pathology findings and were not considered to be 
adverse. 
In a dose range-finding reproductive study in 
pregnant rats, clinical pathology changes suggestive 
of altered liver function, hepatocellular injury, 
hepatobiliary alteration, and/or cholestasis were 
observed in females receiving weekly doses at 50 or 
150 mg/kg prior to mating followed by daily doses 
during the period of organogenesis at 10 or 
30 mg/kg.  A subsequent study in nonpregnant 
female rats dosed daily for 12 days revealed similar 
findings.  In the pivotal embryo-foetal development

adrenal cortical function. 
Clinical trial data revealed no safety

Key Safety Findings from Nonclinical Studies 
study in rats, vacuolation/degeneration, 
hypertrophy, and individual hepatocyte necrosis 
were seen at ≥10 mg/kg, with additional findings of 
focal/multifocal hepatocyte necrosis, infiltrates, and 
basophilic granules in Kupffer cells at 30 mg/kg.  It 
should be noted that all of these findings in rats 
were associated with a highly exaggerated dosing 
schedule (once daily) during gestation relative to the 
once quarterly clinical dosing schedule.  In the 
pivotal rat embryo-foetal development study, the 
NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 10 mg/kg, which 
is 323 times the normalised maximum 
recommended human dose when adjusted for 
surface area.   
Lymph Nodes: 
Vacuolated macrophages were observed after once 
monthly (qM) dosing in mice (≥500 mg/kg), rats 
(females at ≥12 mg/kg, males at ≥40 mg/kg), and 
monkeys (≥30 mg/kg), and was reversible following 
a 12-week recovery period (rats and monkeys).  
These findings were not associated with any 
degenerative changes or any clinical or clinical 
pathology correlates, did not progress with chronic 
dosing, and most likely reflected uptake of 
vutrisiran. 
Adrenal Gland: 
In a 12-week Tg-rasH2 wt mouse study, subcapsular 
cell hyperplasia was observed after 3 qM doses at 
≥1000 mg/kg.  This finding was not seen in any 
other nonclinical species evaluated.  This finding 
was of unknown significance since it is a common 
background finding in Tg-rasH2 mice.[Boyle 2018] 
Kidney: 
Nonadverse, reversible, basophilic granules in the 
cytoplasm of renal proximal tubular epithelial cells 
were seen in rats at ≥40 mg/kg/qM, that were 
occasionally accompanied by vacuolation 
(≥50 mg/kg).  In pregnant rats (30 mg/kg once daily 
for 12 days), hyaline droplet accumulation, 
vacuolation, and basophilic granules in the tubule 
cells and pigment in the tubular lumen were 
observed.  The basophilic granules in the proximal 
tubules are a rat-specific finding and represent the 
uptake of vutrisiran.[Frazier 2015; Janas 2018; Lenz

Key Safety Findings from Nonclinical Studies 
Relevance to Human Usage 
Clinical trial data revealed no safety 
concerns related to pancreatic function.   
Clinical trial data revealed no safety 
concerns related to prostate function.   
No impact on male or female fertility or 
embryo-foetal development was detected in 
animal studies.  
There are no data on the effects of 
vutrisiran on human fertility. No data are 
available on the use of vutrisiran in 
pregnant women.   
The use of vutrisiran in pregnant women is 
considered missing information as 
summarised in Part II: Module SVII.  
Pancreas: 
Interstitial edema, adipocyte necrosis, and infiltrates 
in adipose tissue were observed in pregnant rats that 
received vutrisiran once daily for 12 days at 
30 mg/kg in the pivotal embryo-foetal development 
study.  This finding was not observed in mice, rats, 
or monkeys receiving vutrisiran monthly.  This 
finding was considered to be related to maternal 
toxicity/stress associated with the exaggerated once 
daily dosing schedule and may have been secondary 
to decreased serum protein/albumin that was 
observed in a previous 12-day dosing study at 
30 mg/kg in female rats.[Duncan 1986] 
Prostate: 
In the fertility and early embryonic development 
study in rats, reduction in absolute and relative 
prostate weights were observed at ≥30 mg/kg after 
once weekly (qw) administration.  This finding 
correlated with decreased secretion in the prostate 
gland, observed microscopically, and reduced body 
weights.  The prostate changes had no effects on 
fertility or sperm parameters.  No prostate findings 
were observed in mice, rats, or monkeys receiving 
vutrisiran monthly. 
Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity 
Fertility: 
In toxicity and fertility studies in rats, no effects on 
male or female fertility were observed.   
Embryo-Foetal and Developmental Toxicology: 
Embryo-foetal development studies have been 
performed in rats and rabbits during organogenesis.  
In pregnant rats, daily SC administrations of 
vutrisiran throughout organogenesis at doses up to 
30 mg/kg (qw for 3 weeks prior to mating and once 
daily during the period of organogenesis) resulted in 
elicited reductions in serum TTR protein 
(>95% from baseline), T4 (67% from control on 
Premating Day 14 and below the detection limits on 
GD 21), and vitamin A (≥72% from controls).   
No effects on embryo-foetal survival or foetal body 
weights were observed.  The vutrisiran-related 
foetal skeletal variations were not considered 
adverse , and no vutrisiran-related foetal 
malformations were observed.  
In pregnant rabbits, daily SC administrations of 
vutrisiran throughout organogenesis at doses up to 
30 mg/kg/day resulted in minimum decreases in 
maternal food consumption and absolute body 
weights when compared to controls at doses

Key Safety Findings from Nonclinical Studies 
≥3 mg/kg/day.  There were no vutrisiran-related 
foetal findings.  The maternal and developmental 
NOAEL was concluded to be 30 mg/kg/day. 
Peri/Postnatal Developmental Toxicity in Rats: 
There were no effects on gestation, parturition, 
lactation, or maternal behaviour or on peri/postnatal 
development in offspring at ≤20 mg/kg (highest 
dose tested) when vutrisiran administered on GDs 7, 
13, and 19 and on lactation days 6, 12, and 18.   
Carcinogenicity and Genotoxicity 
Carcinogenicity: 
No data on carcinogenicity assessment are available 
in the nonclinical programme.  Two-year rat and 
mice carcinogenicity studies are ongoing. 
Genotoxicity: 
GLP-compliant genotoxicity studies (bacterial 
reverse mutation, human peripheral blood 
lymphocyte chromosome aberrations, and rat bone 
marrow micronucleus) indicated that vutrisiran is 
neither genotoxic nor clastogenic. 
Drug Abuse and Liability Assessment 
No dedicated dependence studies were conducted 
with vutrisiran.  Based on a review of the 
nonclinical findings, there was no evidence of 
significant drug distribution to the brain, effects on 
central nervous system (CNS) activity, behaviour, 
or neurological examinations. 
Safety Pharmacology 
Based on its physiochemical properties, vutrisiran 
has a low likelihood of direct cardiac ion channel 
interactions or delaying ventricular repolarization.  
Single subcutaneous doses at ≤300 mg/kg (highest 
dose tested) did not result in QT prolongation or 
electrocardiogram abnormalities in monkeys.  No 
effects were seen on the respiratory or 
cardiovascular systems at ≤300 mg/kg.  No 
CNS-related observations were noted in repeat-dose 
monkey toxicity studies at ≤300 mg/kg/qM (highest 
dose tested). 
Other Toxicity-related Information 
Drug-drug interactions: 
Vutrisiran is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 
(CYP) enzymes.  Vutrisiran showed no direct or 
time-dependent inhibition toward any of the CYP 
isoforms evaluated in vitro.  CytochromeP450 
induction and transporter substrate/inhibition studies 
have not been conducted with vutrisiran; however, 
Relevance to Human Usage 
There are no or limited data in the 
nonclinical programme to inform on the 
potential for carcinogenicity in humans.  
The pharmacologic mode of action of 
vutrisiran is not considered to pose an 
increased risk of carcinogenicity. 
Based on the findings from the nonclinical 
programme, there is no evidence that 
vutrisiran has a potential for genotoxicity in 
humans.   
There is no evidence that vutrisiran has a 
potential for abuse in humans, based on 
findings in both the nonclinical and clinical 
programmes. 
There is no evidence that vutrisiran has a 
potential for neurological, respiratory, or 
cardiovascular (including QT interval 
prolongation or delaying ventricular 
repolarization) effects in humans, based on 
findings in the nonclinical programme. 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Vutrisiran is not expected to cause 
interactions or to be affected by inhibitors or 
inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes, or to 
modulate the activity of transporters. 
Therefore, vutrisiran is not expected to have

in vitro CYP induction and transporter data for 
similar siRNA-GalNAc conjugate molecules 
suggest a low potential for drug-drug interaction 
with vutrisiran.[Ramsden 2019] 
Secondary pharmacology: 
Repeated administration of vutrisiran to monkeys at 
≤300 mg/kg/qM resulted in mean maximum 
reductions, relative to baseline, in vitamin A (up to 
89%) and T4 (up to 48%) as well as mean 
maximum reductions in the primary 
pharmacodynamics effect of serum TTR (up to 
99%).  There were no effects on the eye, pituitary, 
or thyroid gland. 
Immunogenicity: 
Anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), measured as 
immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M 
(IgM), or IgG+IgM directed against vutrisiran were 
evaluated in rats and monkeys.  There were no 
apparent effects on exposure or any associated 
clinical signs.  In the 6-month study in rats, ADAs 
were not detected in any samples.  In the 9-month 
study in monkeys, ADAs were detected 
8/32 monkeys (1/8 control, 2/8 at 30 mg/kg, 5/8 at 
100 mg/kg, 0/8 at 300 mg/kg), with 3 samples 
positive at baseline (including 1 control) suggesting 
pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies, and with all 
titers being ≤100.   
Immunostimulation: 
Vutrisiran is not considered to have an 
immunostimulatory potential based on evaluations 
in vitro in a human whole blood assay and in vivo 
in monkeys. 
Relevance to Human Usage 
clinically significant interactions with other 
medicinal products.  
The risk of development of clinical 
consequences of vitamin A deficiency, 
including delayed symptoms, in patients 
receiving vutrisiran is expected to be low, as 
transport and tissue uptake of vitamin A can 
occur in the absence of retinol binding 
protein (RBP).[Biesalski 1999; Episkopou 
1993; van Bennekum 2001]  As was done in 
the clinical studies, patients will be 
instructed to take the daily recommended 
amount (2500-3000 IU) of supplemental 
vitamin A.  Because of a theoretical risk, 
despite the lack of evidence in the clinical 
development programme, clinical 
consequences of vitamin A deficiency, 
including delayed symptoms, is addressed 
as an important potential risk as summarised 
in Section Part II: Module SVII. 
Immunogenicity to drugs in nonclinical 
species is not generally predictive of the 
potential for immunogenicity in humans.   
Immunogenicity has been further evaluated 
in clinical studies. The presence of ADAs 
had no impact on the safety or efficacy of 
vutrisiran.  
There is no evidence from nonclinical 
studies that vutrisiran has a potential for 
immunostimulation in humans.

PART II: MODULE SIII  CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE 
In this RMP, data from the following 2 studies in the vutrisiran clinical development 
programme are considered for the evaluation of the safety profile of vutrisiran: 
•  ALN-TTRSC02-001 (Study 001) is a completed, Phase 1, randomised, single-
blind, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD), and pharmacokinetics (PK) of vutrisiran in 
healthy adult volunteers.   
•  ALN-TTRSC02-002 (Study 002; HELIOS-A) is an ongoing, global, Phase 3, 
randomised, open-label study designed to evaluate efficacy, safety, PK, and PD of 
vutrisiran in adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy.  
Patients were randomised 3:1 to vutrisiran or patisiran, which serves as a 
reference comparator.  Patisiran (ONPATTRO) is a marketed small interfering 
ribonucleic acid (siRNA) therapeutic that targets TTR messenger ribonucleic acid 
(mRNA).  The study consists of 2 parts:   
−  A completed 18-month Treatment Period (i.e., the “Treatment Period”), with 
the primary efficacy analysis at Month 9.  
−  An ongoing Treatment Extension Period (at least 18 months), in which all 
patients, including those initially treated with patisiran, are treated with 
vutrisiran.

The Phase 3 HELIOS-A study included a comparison of vutrisiran data to placebo data from 
the Phase 3 multicenter, multinational, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 
patisiran in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (Study ALN-TTR02-004; 
APOLLO).  The APOLLO placebo group (n=77 patients treated with placebo for a total of 
96.1 patient-years of exposure) served as an external reference to reflect the type of disease-
related events commonly reported in this population, as APOLLO was conducted in a similar 
patient population as HELIOS-A.  This external reference for safety was utilised for the 
characterisation of the safety profile of vutrisiran, as described in Section Part II: Module 
SVII.

PART II: MODULE SIV  POPULATIONS NOT STUDIED IN 
CLINICAL TRIALS 
SIV.1  Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies within the 
Development Programme 
The pivotal, Phase 3, randomised, open-label HELIOS-A study includes patients with 
hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy who are representative of the overall population 
with the disease.  The main exclusion criteria were designed to ensure patient safety where 
the impact of vutrisiran is unknown (e.g., during pregnancy) and to ensure that the efficacy 
and safety of vutrisiran could be accurately ascertained by avoiding confounding factors. 
Key exclusion criteria from this study are presented in Table 8 with a determination of 
whether the criterion is considered as missing information. 
Other exclusion criteria from HELIOS-A that were designed to avoid confounding 
assessment of safety and efficacy or that could impact study execution and compromise data 
integrity are listed below.  There is no expected difference in the safety profile of patients 
excluded for these reasons that would warrant inclusion as missing information. 
•  Other known causes of sensorimotor or autonomic neuropathy 
•  Type I diabetes (any length of time) 
•  Type II diabetes (for ≥5 years) 
•  Vitamin B12 deficiency 
•  Untreated hypo- or hyperthyroidism 
•  Current or future participation in another investigational device or drug study or 
previous investigational agent or device (within 30 days or 5 half-lives of the 
investigational drug, whichever is longer) 
•  Received prior TTR-lowering treatment or participated in a gene therapy trial for 
hATTR amyloidosis 
•  Taking tafamidis, diflunisal, doxycycline, or tauroursodeoxycholic acid 
•  Had (within 3 months) or was planning a major surgery  
•  Had had known human immunodeficiency virus; evidence of acute or chronic 
hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus infection; or an active infection requiring 
systemic antiviral, antiparasitic or antimicrobial therapy that will not be completed 
prior dosing  
•  History of intolerance to SC injection(s) 
•  Malignancies within 2 years (except for basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the 
skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix that was successfully treated) 
•  Acute coronary syndrome within 3 months  
•  Uncontrolled clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia or unstable angina  
•  Known history of alcohol abuse within the past 12 months or daily heavy 
consumption  
•  An anticipated survival less than 2 years

of the safety and efficacy of 
vutrisiran 
Because vutrisiran 
specifically reduces serum 
TTR, it is unlikely to benefit 
patients with other non-TTR 
mediated forms of 
amyloidosis.  Furthermore, 
vutrisiran is not distributed to 
the CNS and would not be 
effective in leptomeningeal 
amyloidosis.  This exclusion 
criterion aligns with the 
inclusion criterion defining 
the qualified population as 
patients with hATTR

SIV.2  Limitation to Detect Reactions in Clinical Trial Development 
Programme 
In HELIOS-A, 155 patients with hATTR amyloidosis were exposed to vutrisiran for 
approximately 233 person-years as of the data cutoff date of 26 August 2021.    
Based on this dataset, the clinical safety data would enable detection of very common 
(incidence of ≥1/10) and common (≥1/100 to <1/10) adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and 
ADRs with a frequency of approximately 1 (or more) events in 44 patient-years of exposure.  
The vutrisiran clinical safety data do not allow detection of ADRs that are uncommon 
(≥1/1000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1000), or very rare (<1/10,000). 
In the HELIOS-A study, vutrisiran was administered to 155 patients for a median duration of 
21.19 months (range:  0.8 to 29.3 months).  Hence, long-term safety (>2 years) data are 
considered missing information. Based on the available data, there are no known vutrisiran 
ADRs that have a long latency, are due to prolonged exposure, or are due to cumulative 
effects.

PART II: MODULE SVI  ADDITIONAL EU REQUIREMENTS FOR 
THE SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
SVI.1 
Potential for misuse for illegal purposes 
Vutrisiran has low abuse potential based on its physiochemical properties, proposed 
mechanism of action, and lack of abuse or dependence properties observed in nonclinical and 
clinical studies. Vutrisiran is a chemically modified double-stranded siRNA that specifically 
targets variant and wild-type TTR mRNA.  It is not chemically or pharmacologically similar 
to other drugs with known abuse potential and does not produce psychoactive effects such as 
sedation, euphoria, and mood changes.   
Vutrisiran is predominantly taken up by the liver, and it is expected that its large molecular 
weight precludes passive permeation of the blood brain barrier.  Nonclinical studies in 
Sprague-Dawley rats demonstrate that vutrisiran does not cross the blood brain barrier 
following a single 3 mg/kg dose of [3H]-vutrisiran.  There are no known transporters, 
receptors, or ion-gated channels for active uptake of vutrisiran into neurons.  No 
vutrisiran-related neurobehavioural changes were noted in nonclinical toxicology studies.   
Within the clinical development programme, there has been no evidence of abuse potential in 
patients treated with vutrisiran.  In clinical studies, the safety profile of vutrisiran is consistent 
with the targeted mechanism of action and does not suggest any type of rewarding effects or 
other abuse-related behaviours.  No cases of intentional overdose or drug abuse of vutrisiran 
have been reported in any clinical study. 
Overall, based on the known physiochemical properties, composition, proposed mechanism 
of action, safety profile, and lack of abuse/dependence properties observed in nonclinical and 
clinical studies, vutrisiran is not considered a drug with potential for abuse.

PART II: MODULE SVII  IDENTIFIED AND POTENTIAL RISKS 
SVII.1  Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP Submission 
The safety profile of vutrisiran has been characterised based on data from the clinical 
development programme, nonclinical study observations, the patient population, the 
mechanism of action, and other relevant safety information to identify potential ADRs, risks, 
and missing information. 
Adverse drug reactions for vutrisiran are defined as the most frequently reported adverse 
events (AEs) in vutrisiran-treated patients in the HELIOS-A study, while accounting for 
commonly reported AEs in the background disease population using the data from the 
external reference APOLLO placebo group.  Additional considerations included temporal 
relationship and biologic plausibility.  Adverse events were analysed using individual 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Preferred Perms (PTs) and also 
grouping by medical concept.  The frequency criterion included AEs (individual PT and/or 
grouped medical concept) reported in >5% of vutrisiran-treated patients in HELIOS-A and 
>3% higher frequency compared to the APOLLO placebo group (Study 002 CSR2 Table 
14.3.1.2.1).  Refer to 2.7.4, Section 5.9 and the Vutrisiran ADR Justification Document in 
Module 1 for details on selection of the following ADRs.  
•  Arthralgia was reported in 10.7% of vutrisiran-treated patients compared with 
none in the APOLLO placebo group. 
•  The medical concept of dyspnoea, which includes the PTs Dyspnoea, Dyspnoea 
exertional, and Dyspnoea paroxysmal nocturnal, was reported in 6.6% of 
vutrisiran-treated patients compared with no patients in the APOLLO placebo 
group. 
•  Based on the SC mode of vutrisiran administration, injection site reactions (ISRs) 
are an ADR, which were reported in 4.1% of vutrisiran-treated patients. 
•  The medical concept of pain in extremity, which includes the PTs Pain in 
extremity and Limb discomfort, was reported in 14.8% of vutrisiran-treated 
patients compared with 10.4% of patients in the APOLLO placebo group. 
•  Based on a gradual increase in mean levels of blood alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 
over time and a disproportionate incidence of elevations >1.5x upper limit of 
normal (ULN) in the vutrisiran group of HELIOS-A, ALP increased is an ADR, 
which was reported in 9.0% of vutrisiran-treated patients.  
SVII.1.1  Risks Not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns 
in the RMP 
Risks that are not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns for 
vutrisiran are outlined below. 
Reason for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in 
the RMP: 
•  Risks with minimal clinical impact on patients (in relation to the severity of the 
indication treated) 
The adverse reactions outlined below were self-limiting and mostly mild in severity, and 
none caused treatment discontinuation.  Considering the severity of hATTR amyloidosis, 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals 
33 
European Union Risk Management Plan 
Amvuttra (vutrisiran) 
these risks are not included as important safety concerns for management within the risk 
management plan (RMP). 
Arthralgia 
Arthralgia was reported in 13 (10.7%) vutrisiran-treated patients in HELIOS-A compared 
with none in the APOLLO placebo group (Study 002 CSR2 Table 14.3.1.2.1).  Adverse 
events of arthralgia were mostly mild or moderate in severity, with 1 patient having a severe 
AE; none of the events were serious (Study 002 CSR2 Tables 14.3.1.4.1 and 14.3.1.5).  No 
AEs of arthralgia led to treatment interruption, treatment discontinuation, or study withdrawal 
(Study 002 CSR2 Tables 14.3.1.6.1, 14.3.1.7.1, and 14.3.1.8.1).  Adverse events of arthralgia 
did not increase over time (Study 002 CSR2 Table 14.3.1.2.3).  Therefore, AEs of arthralgia 
are considered to have minimal clinical impact on patients in the context of the severity of 
hATTR amyloidosis and are not included as important safety concerns for risk management 
within the RMP. 
Dyspnoea 
The medical concept of dyspnoea was reported in 8 (6.6%) vutrisiran-treated patients in 
HELIOS-A compared with no patients in the APOLLO placebo group (Study 002 CSR2 
Table 14.3.1.24).  Adverse events within the dyspnoea medical concept were mild or 
moderate in severity; none of the events were severe or serious (Study 002 CSR2 
Tables 14.3.1.4.1 and 14.3.1.5).  No AEs of dyspnoea led to treatment interruption, treatment 
discontinuation, or withdrawal from a clinical study (Study 002 CSR2 Tables 14.3.1.6.1, 
14.3.1.7.1, and 14.3.1.8.1).  Adverse events of dyspnoea did not increase over time 
(Study 002 CSR2 Table 14.3.1.2.3).  Therefore, AEs of dyspnoea are considered to have 
minimal clinical impact on patients in the context of the severity of hATTR amyloidosis and 
are not included as important safety concerns for risk management within the RMP. 
Injection site reactions 
Based on the SC mode of vutrisiran administration, ISRs are an ADR, which were reported in 
5 (4.1%) vutrisiran-treated patients and in 0.6% of the 836 total doses of vutrisiran 
administered in HELIOS-A (Study 002 CSR2 Table 14.3.1.9.1).  Injection Site Reactions 
were all mild, nonserious, transient, and did not lead to treatment interruption, 
discontinuation, or withdrawal from the clinical study (Study 002 CSR2 Tables 14.3.1.6.1, 
14.3.1.7.1, and 14.3.1.8.1).  No patient had more than 1 ISR; thus, there was no increase over 
time.  Symptoms included bruising, erythema, pain, pruritus, and warmth (Study 002 CSR2 
Listings 16.2.7.1 and 16.2.7.3).  Injection site reactions are considered to have minimal 
clinical impact on patients in the context of the severity of hATTR amyloidosis and are not 
included as important safety concerns for risk management within the RMP. 
Pain in extremity 
The medical concept of pain in extremity was reported in 18 (14.8%) of vutrisiran-treated 
patients compared with 8 (10.4%) of patients in the APOLLO placebo group (Study 002 
CSR2 Table 14.3.1.25).  Adverse events within the pain in extremity medical concept were 
mild or moderate in severity; none of the events were severe or serious (Study 002 CSR2 
Tables 14.3.1.4.1 and 14.3.1.5).  None of the pain in extremity AEs led to treatment 
discontinuation (Study 002 CSR2 Listing 16.2.7.1).  Adverse events of pain in extremity did 
not increase over time (Study 002 CSR2 Table 14.3.1.2.3).  Therefore, AEs of pain in 
extremity are considered to have minimal clinical impact on patients in the context of the 
severity of hATTR amyloidosis and are not included as important safety concerns for risk 
management within the RMP.

Blood alkaline phosphatase increased 
Increases in blood ALP >1.5x ULN were observed in 11 (9.0%) vutrisiran-treated patients in 
HELIOS-A compared to 1 (2.4%) patisiran-treated patient in HELIOS-A and 1 (1.3%) 
APOLLO placebo patient (Study 002 CSR2 Table 14.3.5.3.3).  Of the 11 vutrisiran-treated 
patients with increases in ALP >1.5x ULN, 4 patients had confounding factors, such as bone 
fractures, or no clear increase from the patient’s baseline levels.  One was reported as a 
treatment-emergent AE assessed as moderate and related to vutrisiran treatment.  Vutrisiran 
treatment continued uninterrupted, and the patient’s ALP levels gradually improved to 
baseline with ongoing vutrisiran dosing.  Of the patients with elevations from baseline and no 
confounding factors, any concurrent elevations in liver function tests were typically mild and 
transient with all ALT and AST values <3x ULN and all bilirubin levels <2x ULN.  
Therefore, an increase in blood ALP is considered to have minimal clinical impact on 
patients in the context of the severity of hATTR amyloidosis and is not included as an 
important safety concern for risk management within the RMP. 
SVII.1.2  Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in 
the RMP 
There are no important identified risks pertaining to vutrisiran.  The following important 
potential risk and missing information have been determined based upon detailed review of 
clinical data, nonclinical findings, and other safety information available at the time of the 
data-lock for this RMP.  
Important Potential Risks: 
Clinical Consequences of Vitamin A Deficiency, Including Delayed Symptoms 
Because of the mechanism of action of vutrisiran in reducing TTR, there is a theoretical risk 
of vitamin A deficiency.  Serum TTR is a carrier of RBP, which facilitates transport of 
vitamin A in the blood.  Transthyretin knockout mice have little-to-no circulating vitamin A 
or RBP, but have normal RBP levels and vitamin A stores in the liver and exhibit no signs or 
symptoms of vitamin A deficiency provided they have access to dietary 
vitamin A.[Episkopou 1993]  In addition, individuals with RBP mutations who have no 
circulating RBP and very low vitamin A levels exhibit mild clinical symptoms.[Biesalski 
1999]  Together, these findings indicate that vitamin A transport and tissue uptake can occur 
in the absence of circulating RBP.  
Given the role of TTR as a carrier of RBP and thus vitamin A, there were reductions in 
circulating TTR (up to 99%) and vitamin A (up to 89%) in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in 
monkeys, but there were no detectable effects on the eye. 
In HELIOS-A, reductions in circulating vitamin A have also been observed in patients during 
vutrisiran and patisiran treatment.  A decrease in serum vitamin A levels is a known PD 
effect of reducing serum TTR protein, and this PD effect was similar between vutrisiran and 
patisiran groups in HELIOS-A (Study 002 CSR2 Figure 14.2.5.1).  However, no clinically 
notable trends or changes in ocular AEs were noted or considered attributable to the decrease 
in serum vitamin A levels. 
As a precaution, vitamin A supplementation at the recommended daily amount was advised 
in the clinical studies and will continue to be recommended to patients undergoing treatment 
with vutrisiran.

Amvuttra (vutrisiran) 
Risk-benefit impact:  
There have been no clinical symptoms of vitamin A deficiency detected in the clinical study 
data.  Given the known mechanism of action of vutrisiran in reducing TTR and the decreased 
serum vitamin A levels seen in clinical studies, there is a potential risk of clinical 
consequences of vitamin A deficiency, including delayed symptoms.  This risk will be 
characterised further in Study ALN-TTRSC02-005 (Vutrisiran PASS Protocol), hereafter 
referred to as ‘Study 005’.  As a precautionary measure, patients are advised to take a vitamin 
A supplement.  
Hypersensitivity Reactions 
Hypersensitivity reactions can occur due to a variety of immune mediated (eg, antibody 
mediated, or T cell mediated) and non-immune mediated (eg, pseudoallergy) responses that 
are often drug specific. [Dezsi 2014; Pichler 2007; Szebeni 2014]   
In the vutrisiran group of the HELIOS-A study, 2 patients had a single event of drug 
hypersensitivity. Neither event was serious nor considered related to study drug. 
In addition, 3 (2.5%) patients had a total of 3 treatment-related events (erythema, pruritus, 
and rash) mapped to the Hypersensitivity SMQ (scope: narrow and broad).  None were severe 
or serious. 
One patient experienced 6 severe events (dizziness, dry mouth, hyperhidrosis, hyperthermia, 
scleral discolouration, and dyspepsia) within 2 days of their first dose of vutrisiran as well as 
additional mild or moderate events within 2 days of subsequent doses. While the pattern of 
variable tolerance did not suggest anaphylaxis, a drug hypersensitivity reaction could not be 
ruled out. 
Risk-benefit impact:  
In the vutrisiran clinical studies, an increased risk of serious or severe hypersensitivity 
reactions has not been observed, and no specific risk factors have been identified.  However, 
as with all drugs, hypersensitivity reactions are possible.  Given a lack of observed serious 
and severe hypersensitivity in the vutrisiran clinical development program, the impact of this 
important potential risk on the risk-benefit balance of vutrisiran is expected to be very limited 
but will be characterised further in Study 005. 
Missing information: 
Longer-term Safety (>2 years) 
In the HELIOS-A study, vutrisiran has been administered to 155 patients.  Of these 155 
patients, 118 patients completed ≥18 months of treatment, 79 patients completed ≥21 months 
of treatment, 35 patients completed ≥24 months of treatment, and 5 patients completed ≥27 
months of treatment.  With limited longer-term safety data, the side effects following chronic 
treatment with vutrisiran are unknown.  Based on the available data, there are no known 
vutrisiran adverse drug reactions that have a long latency, are due to prolonged exposure, or 
are due to cumulative effects. 
Risk-benefit impact:  The effects following longer term treatment (>2 years) with vutrisiran 
are currently unknown.  The collection of safety data during longer term treatment (>2 years) 
with vutrisiran will occur in the ongoing HELIOS-A study and Study 005.

Use in Patients with Moderate or Severe Hepatic Impairment 
In HELIOS-A, a total of 8 patients (6.6%) had mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin 
(TBILI) ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >ULN, or 
TBILI >1.0×ULN to 1.5×ULN and any AST) at baseline (see Table 9).  There were no 
patients who had moderate or severe hepatic impairment.  In the study, there were no hepatic 
safety concerns in patients treated with vutrisiran. 
Risk-benefit impact:  Vutrisiran has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe 
hepatic impairment.  The effect of this missing information on the risk-benefit balance for 
patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment is unknown.  These patients will be 
eligible to enroll in Study 005.   
Use in Pregnant Women and Effects on Pregnancy Outcomes 
Vutrisiran was noted to be neither genotoxic nor clastogenic in in vitro and in vivo studies, 
and nonclinical studies indicated there was no direct embryo-foetal toxicity, no detectable 
level of vutrisiran via foetal transfer noted at any dose, and no developmental effects from 
exposure during lactation.  However, there is a potential concern regarding the possibility of 
foetal damage due to vitamin A deficiency. 
In the clinical studies with vutrisiran, women of child-bearing potential were required to use 
highly effective methods of contraception, and women who were pregnant were not enrolled 
in the study.  Thus, there are no data on the safety of vutrisiran in this population. 
Risk-benefit impact:  Vutrisiran is expected to have low risk for reproductive and 
developmental toxicity in humans based on available data from nonclinical studies.  
However, given the lack of clinical data in pregnant women, the effect of vutrisiran on 
pregnancy outcomes and to the foetus and/or infant is currently unknown.  
Outcomes in women exposed to vutrisiran during pregnancy or while breastfeeding will be 
evaluated in Study 005.

The primary mechanism of action of vutrisiran is to reduce the level of TTR.

there is a reduction in TTR levels.

Impact on the risk-
benefit balance of 
the product 
The primary mechanism of action of vutrisiran is to reduce the level of 
TTR.   Serum TTR is a carrier of retinol binding protein (RBP), which helps 
transport vitamin A in the blood.   Therefore, there is a theoretical risk of 
vitamin A deficiency when TTR levels are reduced. However, there is 
evidence that vitamin A can be transported to tissues without RBP. 
[Biesalski 1999; Episkopou 1993]  In studies of vutrisiran in mice and 
monkeys, RBP and serum vitamin A were reduced; however, no evidence of 
vitamin A deficiency were observed. Patients in the clinical study were 
advised to take vitamin A supplementation at the usual recommended daily 
dose. 
In HELIOS-A, reductions in circulating vitamin A have been observed in 
vutrisiran and patisiran treatment.  A decrease in serum vitamin A levels is a 
known PD effect of reducing serum TTR protein, and this PD effect was 
similar between vutrisiran and patisiran groups in HELIOS-A (Study 002 
CSR2 Figure 14.2.5.1).  However, no clinically notable trends or changes in 
ocular AEs were noted or considered attributable to the decrease in serum 
vitamin A levels.  This risk will be characterised further in the ongoing 
HELIOS-A study and Study 005. 
Prolonged dietary deficiency and other conditions such as gastrointestinal 
malabsorption due to a variety of causes can lead to vitamin A deficiency in 
the hATTR amyloidosis population.  
Supplementation of vitamin A at the recommended daily amount 
(2500-3000 IU) is recommended to reduce the potential risk of clinical 
consequences of vitamin A deficiency, including delayed symptoms, as 
transport and tissue uptake of vitamin A can occur through alternative 
mechanisms in the absence of RBP and because some patients may not get 
adequate vitamin A from their diet due to hATTR amyloidosis-related 
gastrointestinal symptoms.  During treatment with vutrisiran, vitamin A 
supplementation should not be adjusted based on serum vitamin A levels 
since laboratory tests for serum vitamin A do not reflect the total amount of 
vitamin A in the body during treatment with vutrisiran. 
There have been no clinical symptoms of vitamin A deficiency detected in 
the clinical study data. Given the known mechanism of action of vutrisiran in 
reducing TTR and the decreased serum vitamin A levels seen in clinical 
studies, there is a potential risk of clinical consequences of vitamin A 
deficiency, including delayed symptoms. However, this risk will be 
characterised further in the ongoing HELIOS-A study and Study 005.  As a 
precautionary measure, patients are advised to take a vitamin A supplement. 
Public health

The public health impact of clinical consequences of vitamin A deficiency, 
including delayed symptoms, due to vutrisiran is expected to be low.

responses that are often drug specific.  [Dezsi 2014; Pichler 2007; Szebeni

Evidence source(s) 
and strength of 
evidence 
Hypersensitivity is a theoretical risk for any drug. Possible hypersensitivity 
reactions were observed in vutrisiran clinical studies.  One clinical study 
patient experienced recurrent adverse events that could suggest a 
hypersensitivity reaction. 
Characterisation of 
the risk 
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
In the vutrisiran group of the HELIOS-A study, 2 patients had a single event 
of drug hypersensitivity.  Neither event was serious nor considered related to 
study drug. 
In addition, 3 (2.5%) patients had a total of 3 treatment-related events 
(erythema, pruritus, and rash) mapped to the Hypersensitivity SMQ (scope:  
narrow and broad).  None were severe or serious. 
One patient experienced 6 severe events (dizziness, dry mouth, 
hyperhidrosis, hyperthermia, scleral discolouration, and dyspepsia) within 
2 days of their first dose of vutrisiran as well as additional mild or moderate 
events within 2 days of subsequent doses.  While the pattern of variable 
tolerance did not suggest anaphylaxis, a drug hypersensitivity reaction could 
not be ruled out. 
Patients with hypersensitivity to vutrisiran or any of the excipients are at 
higher risk.  Patients with a personal history of atopy may be at higher risk in 
general; however, there are no specific data to suggest that these patients 
would be at higher risk of a reaction to vutrisiran. 
Preventability 
As with all drugs, hypersensitivity reactions are possible.  Patients should be 
monitored for signs of hypersensitivity reactions and treated appropriately. 
Impact on the risk-
benefit balance of 
the product 
Public health 
impact 
In the vutrisiran clinical studies, an increased risk of serious or severe 
hypersensitivity reactions has not been observed, and no specific risk factors 
have been identified.  However, as with all drugs, hypersensitivity reactions 
are possible.  Given a lack of observed serious and severe hypersensitivity in 
the vutrisiran clinical development program, the impact of this important 
potential risk on the risk-benefit balance of vutrisiran is expected to be very 
limited but will be characterised further in Study 005. 
The public health impact of hypersensitivity reactions is expected to be low.

Details 
Evidence Source: 
In the HELIOS-A study, vutrisiran has been administered to 122 patients 
during the Treatment Period.  There have been 118 patients treated for at 
least 18 months.  Therefore, the side effects following chronic treatment with 
vutrisiran are unknown.  Based on the available data, there are no known 
vutrisiran adverse drug reactions that have a long latency, are due to 
prolonged exposure, or are due to cumulative effects. 
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information: 
The effects following longer term treatment (>2 years) with vutrisiran are 
currently unknown.  The collection of safety data during longer term 
treatment (>2 years) with vutrisiran will occur in the ongoing HELIOS-A 
study and Study 005. 
Evidence Source: 
In HELIOS-A, a total of 8 patients (6.6%) had mild hepatic impairment 
(TBILI ≤ULN and AST >ULN, or TBILI >1.0×ULN to 1.5×ULN and any 
AST) at baseline (see Table 9).  There were no patients who had moderate or 
severe hepatic impairment.  In the study, there were no hepatic safety 
concerns in patients treated with vutrisiran. 
Population in need of further characterisation: 
Vutrisiran has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment.  These patients will be eligible to enroll in Study 005. 
Evidence Source: 
Vutrisiran was noted to be neither genotoxic nor clastogenic in in-vitro and 
in vivo studies, and nonclinical studies indicated there was no direct embryo-
foetal toxicity, no detectable level of vutrisiran via foetal transfer noted at 
any dose, and no developmental effects from exposure during lactation.  
However, there is a potential concern regarding the possibility of foetal 
damage due to vitamin A deficiency. 
In the clinical studies with vutrisiran, women of child-bearing potential were 
required to use highly effective methods of contraception, and women who 
were pregnant were not enrolled in the study.  Thus, there are no data on the 
safety of vutrisiran in this population. 
Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information: 
Vutrisiran is expected to have low risk for reproductive and developmental 
toxicity in humans based on available data from nonclinical studies.  
However, given the lack of clinical data in pregnant women, the effect of 
vutrisiran on pregnancy outcomes and to the foetus and/or infant is currently 
unknown.  
Outcomes in women exposed to vutrisiran during pregnancy will be 
evaluated in Study 005.

PART V RISK MINIMISATION MEASURES (INCLUDING 
EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RISK 
MINIMISATION ACTIVITIES) 
Routine Risk Minimisation Measures  
V.1 
Careful consideration of the risk-benefit balance for vutrisiran has concluded that routine risk 
minimisation activities are sufficient to manage the safety concerns of vutrisiran.  Routine 
risk communication through product labeling is considered sufficient to describe the safety 
profile for the product and to communicate to healthcare professionals the appropriate actions 
to prevent or mitigate risks, as warranted.  Routine risk minimisation activities 
recommending specific clinical measures to address the risk have been proposed in the label 
as appropriate to the safety concern.  
If, through routine or additional PV activities as summarised in Section Part III, new risks are 
identified, the risk communication and minimisation measures will be updated as necessary.  
An overview of the proposed risk minimisation activities for the important potential risk and 
missing information for vutrisiran is provided in Table 16.

Part VI  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR AMVUTTRA 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Amvuttra.  The RMP details 
important risks of Amvuttra, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about Amvuttra's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Amvuttra's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Amvuttra should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Amvuttra should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Amvuttra's RMP. 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
I 
Amvuttra is authorised for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis 
(hATTR amyloidosis) in adult patients with polyneuropathy.  It contains vutrisiran as the 
active substance and it is given by SC injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Amvuttra’s benefits can be found in Amvuttra’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage link to the EPAR summary landing 
page. 
II 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND 
ACTIVITIES TO MINIMISE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE 
THE RISKS 
Important risks of Amvuttra, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Amvuttra 's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the PIL and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., 
with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including in the Periodic Safety Update Report assessment, so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary.  These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.

If important information that may affect the safe use of Amvuttra is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
II.A 
Important risks of Amvuttra are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Amvuttra.  Potential risks are concerns 
for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of Important Risks 
II.B 
Important Potential Risk: Clinical Consequences of Vitamin A Deficiency, Including Delayed 
Symptoms 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
The primary mechanism of action of Amvuttra is to reduce the level of 
transthyretin (TTR).  Serum TTR is a carrier of retinol binding protein 
(RBP), which helps transport vitamin A in the blood.  Therefore, there is a 
theoretical risk of vitamin A deficiency when TTR levels are 
reduced.  However, there is evidence that vitamin A can be transported to 
tissues without RBP.[Biesalski 1999; Episkopou 1993] In studies of 
Amvuttra in mice and monkeys, RBP and serum vitamin A were reduced; 
however, no evidence of vitamin A deficiency was observed.   Patients in the 
clinical study were advised to take vitamin A supplementation at the usual 
recommended daily dose. 
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Prolonged dietary deficiency and other conditions such as gastrointestinal 
malabsorption due to a variety of causes can lead to vitamin A deficiency in 
the hATTR amyloidosis population.  
Risk minimisation 
measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
•  The secondary pharmacologic effect on serum vitamin A levels is 
described in SmPC sections 4.4, 4.5, 5.1, and 5.3, and PIL Section 2.  
•  Legal status:  Prescription-only

Hypersensitivity is a theoretical risk for any drug. 
In the vutrisiran group of the HELIOS-A study, 2 patients had a single event 
of drug hypersensitivity.  Neither event was serious or considered related to 
study drug. 
In addition, 3 (2.5%) patients had a total of 3 treatment-related events 
erythema, pruritus, and rash) mapped to the Hypersensitivity SMQ (scope:  
narrow and broad).  None were severe or serious. 
One patient experienced 6 severe events (dizziness, dry mouth, 
hyperhidrosis, hyperthermia, scleral discolouration, and dyspepsia) within 
2 days of their first dose of vutrisiran as well as additional mild or moderate 
events within 2 days of subsequent doses.  While the pattern of variable 
tolerance did not suggest anaphylaxis, a drug hypersensitivity reaction could 
not be ruled out. 
Patients with hypersensitivity to vutrisiran or any of the excipients are at 
higher risk.  Patients with a personal history of atopy may be at higher risk in 
general; however, there are no specific data to suggest that these patients 
would be at higher risk of a reaction to vutrisiran.

Study: HELIOS-A Randomised Treatment Extension (Ongoing) 
Purpose of the study:  The HELIOS-A-RTE study is a Phase 3 global, open-label study to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of ALN-TTRSC02 in patients with hATTR Amyloidosis.  
The aim of the study is to collect further longer-term safety and efficacy data on vutrisiran in 
patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. 
Study ALN-TTRSC02-005, Study 005:  Prospective, Observational Study (Planned) 
Purpose of the study:  This is a prospective, observational study to monitor and assess the 
safety of Amvuttra® [vutrisiran] in a real-world cohort of hATTR amyloidosis patients.  The 
aim of the study is to characterise the long-term (>2 years) safety of vutrisiran under real-
world conditions, including determining the incidence of selected events (eg, hypersensitivity 
reactions and clinical consequences of vitamin A deficiency, including delayed symptoms) in 
hATTR amyloidosis patients exposed to vutrisiran, as well as provide comparative safety 
data from patients including untreated patients and patients treated with other therapies for 
hATTR amyloidosis excluding patisiran, following local standard of care.  The secondary 
objectives are to characterise the safety of vutrisiran in sub-populations (eg, patients with 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment, patients who are pregnant), to describe the 
epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients treated with vutrisiran in a real-world 
setting and to evaluate information from all pregnant or lactating women exposed to 
vutrisiran, including pregnancy outcomes, and selected infant outcomes.

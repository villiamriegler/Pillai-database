Based on the CHMP review of the available information and 
on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, 
the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of sildenafil actavis continues to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considered that the 
benefit risk profile of sildenafil actavis continues to be 
favourable in the treatment of adult men with erectile 
dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve or maintain a 
penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual 
performance. In order for sildenafil actavis to be effective, 
sexual stimulation is required. The CHMP recommends that 
the renewal be granted with unlimited validity.

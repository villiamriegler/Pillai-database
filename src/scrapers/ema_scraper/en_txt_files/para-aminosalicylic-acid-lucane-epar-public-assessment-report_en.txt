1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Lucane Pharma submitted on 1 March 2012 an application for Marketing Authorisation 
to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA)  for  PAS-GR,  through  the  centralised  procedure  falling 
within  the  Article  3(1)  and  point  4 of  Annex  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004.  The  eligibility  to the 
centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 15 February 2012. 
PAS-GR was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/10/826 on 17 December 2010. PAS-
GR was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication:  “Treatment of 
tuberculosis”. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
“PAS-GR is indicated for the treatment of tuberculosis in combination with other active agents. It is 
most commonly used in patients with Multi-Drug Resistant TB (MDR-TB) or in situations when 
primary medication therapy with recommended agents is not possible due to a combination of 
resistance and/or intolerance.  
PAS-GR is indicated in adults, infants, children and adolescents.” 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Para-aminosalicylic acid Lucane as an orphan 
medicinal product in the approved indication. The outcome of the COMP review can be found on the 
Agency's website: ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human medicines/Rare disease designation. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/83/EC – relating to applications relying on well-established medicinal 
use supported by bibliographic literature. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on bibliographic literature substituting all non-clinical tests and 
clinical studies.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
This application is for PAS-GR a gastro-resistant granule formulation of para-aminosalicylic acid 
intended for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) in combination with other medicinal products. 
The proposed indication for PAS-GR is the treatment of tuberculosis in combination with other active 
agents. It is most commonly used in patients (adults and children) with Multi-Drug Resistant TB 
(MDR-TB) or in situations when primary medication therapy with recommended agents is not possible 
due to a combination of resistance and/or intolerance.  
The proposed posology is 4g (one sachet) three times a day i.e. every 8 hours in adults and 
150 mg/kg, divided in two intakes daily for children  
Tuberculosis  
TB is one of the leading causes of death due to a single pathogen worldwide. It is estimated by the 
World Health Organization (WHO) that 32% of the world population is infected with Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis. 9.2 million new cases of TB and 1.7 million deaths from TB were reported in 2007. 
Multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) 
Resistance to TB drugs is defined as a level of resistance to four times or greater the standard 
concentration of drug required to inhibit a fully susceptible organism. Resistance can be to a single 
drug, for example mono-resistance to isoniazid, or to multiple drugs, for example to both isoniazid 
and streptomycin.  
Multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) is defined as high-level resistance to both rifampicin and isoniazid 
with or without additional drug resistances.  
Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) is defined as MDRTB with additional resistance to a 
fluoroquinolone and at least one second line injectable agent.  
In 2006, WHO estimated that there were approximately 500,000 cases of Multi-drug resistant TB 
(MDR-TB). In addition, new cases of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) have been 
reported around the globe.1 This situation poses a serious problem for low income countries, 
especially those with a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.  
MDR-TB and XDR-TB are also now of special concern in wealthy countries as a result of mass 
immigration giving MDR-TB and XDR-TB a high priority in global public health and biomedical 
research.2

In Europe, data from 2008 indicate that MDR-TB was 6.0% of the total case load for 25 countries 
with reporting data. Furthermore, XDR-TB reporting has increased since 2007 and 7.3% of the MDR 
TB cases reported from 13 countries. Therefore, MDR-TB remains a threat and XDR-TB is now 
established within the EU/EEA borders.3 
Management options  
The WHO guidelines on the treatment of MDR-TB proposes grouping of anti-tuberculosis agents into 
the following categories: 
Group 1 – First-line oral agents: pyrazinamide; ethambutol; rifabutin 
Group 2 – Injectable agents: kanamycin; amikacin; capreomycin; streptomycin  
Group 3 – Fluoroquinolones: levofloxacin; moxifloxacin; gatifloxacin; ofloxacin  
Group 4 – Oral bacteriostatic: ethionamide; protionamide; cycloserine; terizidone; para-
aminosalicylic acid 
Group 5 – Agents with unclear efficacy: clofazimine; linezolid; amoxicillin/clavulanate; thioacetazone; 
clarithromycin; imipenem/cilastatin; high-dose isoniazid. 
The revised guidelines (2011)4 state that streptomycin is considered as a first line agent and its use 
in MDR-TB patients is not recommended. In Group 4 products, among the oral bacteriostatic agents, 
the association with cure was higher with ethionamide than with cycloserine, which was higher than 
with PAS. Ethionamide or prothionamide should therefore always be included in a regimen unless 
there is a particular contraindication. PAS is recommended only if an additional medicinal product is 
needed to achieve a five-drug regimen or if ethionamide or cycloserine cannot be used or are unlikely 
to be effective. 
Para-aminosalicylic acid is included in the British Thoracic Society Guidelines list of reserve drug 
products for MDR-TB. It recommends that treatment should start with five or more drug products to 
which the organism is, or is likely to be, susceptible and continued until sputum cultures become 
negative.  
None of the agents classified in Group 4 are licensed throughout the EU. Cycloserine and ethionamide 
have national authorisations in a limited number of countries.  
2.1.2.  About the product 
The product, Para-aminosalicylic acid Lucane (PAS-GR), is a gastro-resistant granular form of para-
aminosalicylic acid (PAS) and belongs to the pharmacological class of anti-tuberculosis agents. It is 
intended to treat tuberculosis (TB) resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin, termed multi-drug 
resistant TB (MDR-TB) and MDR-TB also resistant to a fluoroquinolone and a second-line injectable 
agent termed extensively-drug resistant TB (XDR-TB), in combination with other agents to which the 
bacterial organism is sensitive (WHO 2008). The intended indication is in combination with other 
active agents for the treatment of MDR-TB.

Para-aminosalicylic acid  
Para-aminosalicylic acid was the second medicinal product to be introduced for the treatment of TB in 
1946. The recognition of its therapeutic role, in particular the ability to reduce the emergence of 
resistance to both streptomycin and isoniazid led to its use in combination with these agents in 
standard therapy of TB in the1940s until the 1970s. With the introduction of rifampicin and 
ethambutol in the 1970s and the decline in incidence of TB the use of PAS declined and standard 
regimens excluding PAS became routine practice throughout Europe and the United States.  
In the 1950s and 1960s many products containing PAS were available and licensed and marketed for 
the treatment of TB in Europe, some are listed below but are no longer available:  
•  Spain: Apir Pas (IBYS), B-Pas (Wander), Gamirpas (Gamir), Parispas (Parisis), Vadrine (Inibsa),  
• 
Italy: Eupasal Sodico (Sholl), Italpas Sodico (Issolabi), Pasdrazide (Bruco), Salf-Pas (Salf),  
•  Sweden : Na-PAS (Ferrosan),  
•  UK: Paramisan Sodium (Smith and Nephew), Paskalium (Glenwood), Therapas (Smith and 
Nephew).  
• 
France: B-P.A.S (Laboratoires Wander), P.A.S Sodique, (Laboratoires Diamant), Para-amino-
salicylate de sodium (Rhone Poulenc). 
In the 1990s, TB strains resistant to the routine treatments of TB emerged and the incidences of 
MDR-TB and XDR-TB increased and became an obvious public health problem. The need for 
additional medicinal products became urgent. PAS was made available in some countries (notably the 
US) and from there in other countries (FR, Latvia, Portugal, amongst others).  
Following the emergence of MDR-TB, PAS-GR (the formulation under consideration in this application) 
was developed in the USA for the treatment of MDR-TB. This gastro-resistant formulation of para-
aminosalicylic acid (registered as Paser) was granted an Orphan Drug Designation and Marketing 
Authorisation in USA in 1994. It has also been approved in Russia and Republic of South Africa. It is 
included in the WHO Green Light Committee programme of essential, quality-assured second-line TB 
drugs since 1999.  MDR-TB is now recognized as a major threat to public health within the EU. PAS is 
listed as an essential second-line agent for the treatment of MDR- and XDR-TB in the WHO treatment 
guidelines. These guidelines have been adopted by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and 
Control (ECDC) and are followed throughout the EU. 
2.1.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
In accordance with Article 10a of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended the application relies on well- 
established medicinal use supported by bibliographic literature.  According to Article 10a of Directive 
2001/83/EC, as amended it is possible to replace results of pre-clinical and clinical trials by detailed 
references to published scientific literature (information available in the public domain) if it can be 
demonstrated that the active substance of a medicinal product has been in well-established medicinal 
use within the Community for at least 10 years, with a recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of 
safety. In this regard, the provisions of Annex I (Part II.1) to Directive 2001/83/EC shall apply. 
The requirements of Article 10a application are discussed below: 
a)  Factors which have been taken into account by the CHMP in order to establish a well-established 
use 
Assessment report  
EMA/18511/2014  
Page 10/55 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
Time over which the substance has been used 
This medicine has been used for this indication for over 10 years.  
There is evidence which show that PAS has been used for more than 10 years in the European Union. 
In particular, it was used in France where the Central Pharmacy of Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de 
Paris (AGEPS), the largest European Public Hospital, has been supplying a form of PAS for use in the 
majority of MDR-TB patients from before 2000 until 2009. Since October 2009, AFSSAPS (now 
ANSM) approved the use of Paser (PAS-GR) on a named-patient basis under a nominative 
“Authorisation Temporaire d'Utilisation” (ATU) for patients with MDR- and XDR-TB. In January 2011, 
its use was approved under a cohort ATU (no: 589293-1). 
Literature references were also submitted in support of the well-established use, in particular with 
regards to the period 2000-2004 for the treatment of MDR-TB or XDR-TB in combination with other 
anti-tuberculosis drugs in Latvia (Bloss et al 2010).  
-  Quantitative aspects of use of the substance 
MDR-TB and XDR-TB are extremely rare in the European Union and therefore it is difficult to provide 
evidence of quantitative use beyond data available from various stated sources i.e. WHO, national 
treatment guidelines, literature reports, testimonials of individual treating physicians, data from 
France under the ATU system and from importing wholesalers.   
The applicant has information which shows that PAS-GR is used in France for compassionate use 
under the ATU scheme.  As stated above, it has been approved under a cohort ATU from 2011 (no: 
589293-1) and prior to this PAS-GR was used on a named-patient basis under a nominative ATU.  
Over the 1st quarterly period of ATU, 65 patients received PAS-GR. On 30 June 2013, a cumulative 
total of 203 adults MDR-TB patients had been included in the French Cohort ATU, of whom 152 were 
still on treatment. 
In support, there is also information which shows that a hospital preparation of PAS was used in 
France until 2009.  
Further on, the Latvian study (Bloss 2010) reports a total of 1027 pulmonary TB cases identified over 
a period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004.  Among these patients, 686 (67%) received 
PAS at a daily dosage of 16 g. The individual durations of treatment were not specified.  
In addition, a specific analysis on patients in the European Union (EU 27) has been provided by Dr 
Richard Menzies, responsible person for the global worldwide analysis on “Multidrug Resistant 
Pulmonary Tuberculosis Treatment Regimens and Patient Outcomes: An Individual Patient Data Meta-
analysis of 9,153 Patients”, published recently (Ahuja 2012). The studies were originally included in 
the Individual Patient Data meta-analysis for MDR-TB conducted for the WHO (in 2010).  From this 
larger dataset, patients treated at seven European centres were selected (Spain, the Netherlands, 
Latvia, Estonia, Italy, UK and France). These had treated 1504 MDR-TB patients in total, and 280 
received PAS.  Patients were enrolled from 1982 up to 2008, although the majority of studies- and 
the largest - were conducted between 2000 and 2004.  
From the above and having considered the prevalence of the disease, the CHMP concluded that PAS 
has been significantly used in practice in the EU for MDR-TB and that the criterion of the extent of 
use is fulfilled.

- 
The  degree  of  scientific interest  in  the  use  of  the  substance  (reflected in  the published  scientific 
literature) 
The inclusion of PAS for the treatment of MDR- and XDR-TB in all International and Regional 
guidelines together with direct evidence of usage in various European countries as reported in the 
scientific literature, are considered supportive to the well-established medicinal use for this serious 
disease. The CHMP therefore concludes that this criterion is fulfilled. 
-  Coherence of scientific assessments 
The literature provides a consistent view that PAS-GR is a treatment option as part of a multiple 
regimen treatment in MDRTB/ XDRTB.  Overall there is coherence in the literature reviewed and 
analysed. 
Various National Treatment Guidelines and WHO guidance state the use of PAS as part of the 
treatment regimen for MDR-TB and counts it as an alternative or addition to others in Group 4, 
namely ethionamide, protionamide and cycloserine.  Its availability is critical for patients who cannot 
tolerate other Group 4 agents or in whom the organism has developed resistance to these agents.  
The CHMP therefore concludes that this criterion is fulfilled. 
b)  The CHMP considers that the documentation submitted by the Applicant has covered the various 
aspects  of  the  safety  and  efficacy  and  includes  review  of  the  relevant  literature.  The 
documentation, both favourable and unfavourable has been communicated. 
Specific evidence of efficacy and safety of the use of PAS in MDR-TB is sparse and restricted to a 
small number of publications describing outcomes where PAS has been used as part of the multi-drug 
regimen. Likewise to the other employed medicinal products, there are no controlled studies 
demonstrating efficacy or safety of individual therapeutic agents. The sponsor is referring to earlier 
studies demonstrating efficacy and safety of PAS in the treatment of TB (Dubovski 1991) together 
with clinical use and has discussed the relevance of these data for the use of PAS-GR in MDR-TB.  
Particular attention has been paid to any missing information and the CHMP considers that adequate 
justifications have been provided by the applicant demonstrating that an acceptable level of safety 
and efficacy can be supported. 
c)  The applicant explained the relevance of data submitted concerning the product reviewed in the 
literature being different from the product intended for marketing and provided a justification to 
support the usage of the enteric coated formulation that constitutes controlled release. 
Based on these data, the CHMP accepted that the product studied in the literature can be considered 
similar to the product intended for marketing.  
d)  It is noted that PAS has been used in the EU and, in particular, is currently available for 
compassionate use in France.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
PAS-GR is presented as gastro-resistant granules containing 4 grams of para-aminosalicylic acid as 
the active substance. Granules are off white to light brown, approximately 1.5 mm diameter. 
Other ingredients are: colloidal silicon dioxide, dibuthyl sebacate, methacrylic acid – ethyl acrylate 
copolymer (1:1) dispersion 30%, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose and talc. 
PAS-GR is available in sachets consisting of Paper/Low Density Polyethylene/Aluminium 
foil/Primer/Low Density Polyethylene (Paper/LDPE/alu/LDPE).  
The product is supplied with a calibrated dosing spoon to measure small doses for young children. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS), also known as 4-aminosalicylic acid is chemically designated as 4-
amino-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and has the following structure: 
This amphoteric substance appears as off white to beige powder and it is slightly soluble in water. Its 
solubility is increased with alkaline salts of alkali metals (NaHC0 3) and in weak nitric acid; the amine 
salts of hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acids are insoluble. 
PAS has no chiral centres and therefore no stereoisomers are expected. There is possibility that the 
isomers (regioisomers) such as 3-amino salicylic acid, 5-amino salicylic acid and 6-amino salicylic 
acid may be formed. However, sufficient evidence was provided assuring that the level of these 
regioisomers are controlled and that the proposed manufacturing process consistently produces 4-
aminosalicylic acid. 
No polymorphisms have been observed for PAS. Analysis of multiple production batches by IR, 
melting point, and XRPD demonstrated consistency of the polymorphic form. Moreover, solvent 
studies showed that the same form is obtained from a variety of solvents. 
Particle size of the active substance is considered a critical attribute for the manufacture of the 
finished product, as PAS is not dissolved in the dosage form. Therefore an appropriate test on particle 
size determination was included in the active substance specification. 
Manufacture 
PAS is synthesised by a four-step process using well defined starting materials and reagents. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
have been presented for the intermediate products, starting materials and reagents.

The molecular structure of PAS was elucidated by elemental analysis and spectroscopic methods. A 
combination of ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectroscopy, infrared (IR) absorption spectroscopy, 
nuclear magnetic resonance (1H and 13C NMR), and mass spectrometry (MS) were used to determine 
the chemical structure. 
Potential impurities have been well discussed in relation to their origin (starting materials, 
manufacturing process and degradation products) and potential carry-over into the final substance. 
The possibility of genotoxic impurities was also considered during the development. Impurities with a 
potential structural alert have been identified and are controlled by appropriate specification limits. 
In general, sufficient information regarding the manufacturing process, starting materials, critical 
steps and intermediates, process validation and manufacturing process development was provided. 
The synthesis and process parameters were well characterised and described. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, solubility, colour of solution, identity 
(IR, colorimetric reaction), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), pH of saturated 
solution, water content (KF), melting point, heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), 
particle size and chlorides (Ph. Eur.). 
A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Some of the proposed methods are in 
accordance with the Ph. Eur. Complete method validation data was provided for the non compendial 
(in-house) analytical methods. 
Although the analytical method for impurity testing was considered acceptable, further improvements 
to this method (with regards to the sample preparation) were recommended. Currently, to prevent 
the degradation of one of the impurities during the analytical procedure, first dilution of the impurity 
reference standard is made with different diluent then dilution of the active substance whereas 
subsequent dilutions are performed with the same diluent. There is a risk that if the impurity is not 
soluble in the sample diluent, then it could not be detected in the sample. Therefore the applicant 
was recommended to develop, an analytical procedure where the impurity and the active substance 
are dissolved in the same diluent using the same preparation technique. 
Furthermore, the applicant was recommended to perform the suitability test as described in Ph. Eur. 
2.5.12 for the Karl Fisher (KF) method for determination of water. Very low levels of water were 
reported in the active substance and these were below the limit recommended by the Ph. Eur. for 
validation of suitability. However, the Ph. Eur 2.5.12 suitability range is given as an example only. 
Therefore the applicant was recommended to finalise the method validation for determination of 
water content in the active substance by validating the suitability range. 
In  general  specification  limits  and  analytical  methods  proposed  are  suitable  to  control  the  quality  of 
the active substance.  
Batch analysis results for PAS have been presented for two commercial scale batches. All batches 
were manufactured by the proposed commercial manufacturers according to the proposed process. 
Data demonstrated consistency between batches and that batches comply with the proposed 
specification. It can be concluded that the batch analysis results indicate that the manufacturing 
process is reproducible and under control. 
Stability 
Stability studies were not performed under ICH conditions and samples were stored at a temperature 
not less than 15°C which represents the long term condition. 
Assessment report  
EMA/18511/2014  
Page 14/55 
 
 
 
 
Primary stability studies according to ICH guidelines have been initiated on three commercial scale 
batches of the active substance stored in the commercial package. PAS will be included in a stability 
program under refrigerated conditions (5°C ± 3°C). Stability data will be generated, in accordance 
with current ICH recommended storage conditions, to support the re-test period and storage 
conditions for PAS. Meanwhile, and until a re-test period is set based on suitable stability results, the 
active substance will be fully controlled prior to each manufacture of the finished product. 
No forced degradation study was performed in support of this application. The degradation pathways 
were discussed based on a published literature reference. The absence of such studies was 
acceptable because the active substance will be fully tested before use and no-retest period was 
proposed. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The objective of pharmaceutical development was to obtain a stable formulation, with high content of 
the active substance, in the form of spherical and smooth granules displaying uniform gastro-
resistant coating to protect them from acidic degradation. The active substance is unstable at acidic 
conditions and has better stability in a neutral or alkaline pH range. In acidic conditions it degrades 
via decarboxylation and forms meta-aminophenol, the major degradation component. The 
formulation development was aimed at obtaining a controlled (delayed) release of the active 
substance able to reduce fluctuation of the plasma levels. Development of gastro-resistant dosage 
form was based on the fact that PAS is known for gastro-intestinal side effects and therefore the 
enteric coating will improve the formulation tolerability. As an age-appropriate dosage form granules 
also assure the flexibility to administer the product to young children by sprinkling into food or mixing 
with drinks. 
Limited information has been provided on the development of the finished product. However the 
product has been commercially used in US since 1994. The applicant has provided further information 
based on literature references for formulation development and development of controlled release 
enteric coated formulation. 
The finished product contains PAS formulated as microspheronised core beads that are subsequently 
enteric-coated. It is a delayed release formulation from the gastro-resistant coating. The excipients 
were selected on grounds of compatibility with the active substance and suitability for the type of wet 
granulation process. All excipients used in the formulation comply with the current European 
Pharmacopoeia monograph and are commonly used excipients for this pharmaceutical form. The wet 
granulation process selected was extrusion/spheronisation. For this process, shape, size and yield 
were considered critical quality attributes in order to produce uniform coating and to adequately 
control dissolution. 
A summary of studies performed to optimize both the enteric coating and the controlled release 
coating was presented. It was shown that the use of Eudragit L-30D was found to be successful in 
protecting the product during the acid stage. For the controlled release in the buffer medium 
(phosphate buffer), a combination of ethylcellulose dispersion (Aquacoat) with hypromellose and with 
dibuthyl sebacate as plasticizer was found to be appropriate. The chosen release-rate controlling 
coating was found to be adequate to delay the dissolution of the spherical granules which could 
provide twice daily dosing. 
Assessment report  
EMA/18511/2014  
Page 15/55 
 
 
 
 
 
Dissolution method for testing dissolution of the granules is based on two phase testing, one in the 
acidic medium to test for enteric coating and the second phase is for alkaline medium. Dissolution 
method is well designed for this type of specialized dosage form. Although the dissolution method is 
sensitive enough to detect batches of the finished product that do not comply with the specification, 
its discriminatory power has not been fully documented. However, appropriate applied in-process 
controls, as well as the manufacturer’s experience with the product provide assurance that only 
batches that comply with the proposed specifications are released. Nevertheless, the applicant was 
recommended to continue its efforts for developing a dissolution method with an appropriate 
discriminatory power or to further demonstrate the discriminatory power of the currently used 
method. 
According to SmPC, the contents of the sachet (granules) could be added to a glass of orange or 
tomato juice. They will not dissolve, but swirling the juice in the glass will help re-suspend the 
granules if they sink. A justification that the enteric coated granules will not dissolve in acidic foods 
has been provided. However, the pH of foods is known to fluctuate with brands. No compatibility 
study has been provided and the applicant has modified the instructions in the SmPC that these 
granules should be taken immediately after dispersion. It has been demonstrated that the enteric 
coating is resistant to acidic pH, and that its functionality is preserved in the acidic vehicles proposed 
for administration in the SmPC, therefore it should also preserve the active substance from contact 
with those vehicles during administration. These indicate that PAS-GR granules will be stable in any 
acidic fluids such as orange juice or tomato juice. 
A measuring device (measuring spoon) has been developed to measure the prescribed dose when 
below 4 g per intake (few patients, mostly children, may need a lower daily dose usually 150 mg of 
PAS per kg of body weight per day, divided in 3 intakes). The device called “Spoonbox” has been 
designed to sample from 500 mg expressed in active substance up to 3750 mg. The increment is 
250 mg. The device is CE marked. The dosing device is adapted to the posology regimen. The 
marking appearing on the Spoonbox (graduated scale and scale intervals) are suitable in relation to 
the dosing advice as stated in the SmPC. 
Granules are packed in sachets consisting of Paper/Low Density Polyethylene/Aluminium 
foil/Primer/Low Density Polyethylene (Paper/LDPE/alu/LDPE). The container closure system complies 
with the Ph. Eur. and the EC requirements. The choice of the packaging has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
It can be concluded that the formulation development of the product was satisfactorily described. The 
key critical parameters were identified and evaluated. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin are used for the preparation of the finished 
product. 
Manufacture of the product 
Main steps of the manufacturing process of the finished product are wet mixing, extrusion, 
spheronisation, fluid-bed drying, sieving, coating and filling into sachets. Detailed description of the 
manufacturing process was provided.   
The applicant has provided sufficient information on the manufacturing process of the granules and all 
the in-process controls that are applied during the manufacture. The manufacturing process takes 
place at two sites; one is responsible for the manufacture of the uncoated granules and packaging of 
the final product, and the other site is responsible for coating. The manufacturing process has been 
Assessment report  
EMA/18511/2014  
Page 16/55 
 
 
 
 
 
validated and it was demonstrated to be capable of reproducibly producing a finished product of the 
intended quality. Adequate in-process controls are in place for this pharmaceutical form.  
Product specification 
The finished product release specification include appropriate tests for appearance, identification 
(HPLC, colour reaction and UV), water content (KF), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution 
(Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC) and microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.). 
A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Complete method validation data was 
provided for the non compendial (in-house) analytical methods. 
Batch analysis results on seven industrial batches confirm consistency and uniformity of manufacture 
and indicate that the process is capable of consistently producing a finished product that meets the 
predefined specifications and that the manufacturing process is under control. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data have been provided for three industrial scale batches of the finished product. The 
stability batches have been manufactured according to the manufacturing process proposed for 
marketing and the samples were packed in the container proposed for the market. Up to eighteen 
months stability data have been provided under long term conditions (25ºC/60%RH) according to 
ICH conditions. In addition results for 5 batches stored under non-ICH conditions (15ºC) were 
provided in support of the shelf-life. Stability data were available on 18 months for 2 batches and 12 
months for 3 batches stored under 15ºC conditions. All results comply with specifications. 
Samples were tested for appearance, water content, assay, related substances and dissolution. The 
analytical procedures used were stability indicating and these were the same analytical methods as 
used for release of the finished product. 
The overall stability data for PAS gastro-resistant granules proved that the product is stable under 
tested conditions. The results generated during the stability studies support the proposed shelf life 
and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The information provided about the active substance, PAS, was of acceptable quality. In general 
sufficient information regarding the manufacturing process, materials, critical steps and 
intermediates, process validation and manufacturing process development have been provided. The 
synthesis and process parameters have been well characterised and described. Specification limits 
and analytical methods are suitable to control the quality of the active substance. No re-test period 
for the active substance was established as stability data were not sufficient. Para-aminosalicylic acid 
must be tested prior to use.  
Selection of the type of formulation and of the manufacturing process has been justified. Limited 
information has been provided on the development of the finished product and this was accepted in 
view of the fact that the product has been commercially used in US since 1994. The applicant has 
provided further information based on literature references for formulation development and 
development of controlled release enteric coated formulation. This is based on the fact that PAS is 
known for GI side effects and therefore the enteric coating will improve the formulation tolerability.  
The controlled release formulation is based on a publication where the authors have suggested that 
the use of controlled release formulation will reduce fluctuations of the active substance in plasma. 
Assessment report  
EMA/18511/2014

Physicochemical and biological properties of the finished product have been well analysed, and the 
critical parameters for performance of the product have been defined and are routinely controlled, 
namely acid resistance, solubility in neutral pH solutions and bead particle size.  
The method of manufacture is considered standard and has been satisfactorily described, including 
in-process tests. The data shows consistent manufacture and is considered sufficient for this 
manufacturing process. A satisfactory validation protocol has been provided. 
The proposed specifications were justified based on the batch and stability results, and are in general 
adequate for assuring the product quality and therefore were accepted.  
The stability program is considered satisfactory. The batches placed on stability are considered 
representative of the product to be marketed. The results generated during the stability studies 
support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  Development of an analytical test procedure where the impurity standard and the sample (active 
substance) are dissolved in the same diluent using the same preparation technique. The new 
method, appropriate validation data, and analytical results for at least 3 consecutive production 
scale batches of the active substance should be implemented via appropriate regulatory 
procedure.  
2.  Validation of the method for the determination of water content in the active substance (Karl 
Fisher method). Linearity, accuracy, precision, and intermediate precision should be determined.  
3.  Development of an alternative dissolution method with an appropriate discriminatory power or 
demonstration that the current dissolution method has an appropriate discriminatory power to 
be able to differentiate between batches that meet specification requirements and batches that 
will be out of the specification limits.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Since  literature  references  have  been  provided  in  support  of  the  application  (with  many  studies 
performed more than 60 years ago until 2004), it cannot be verified whether the studies cited were in 
compliance  with  GLP  regulations,  however,  it  is  assumed  that  the  studies  were  conducted  in 
compliance and accordance with the standards prevailing at the time of conduct of the studies.  This 
is however satisfactory due to the accepted well established use of the product. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
A number of in vitro studies have demonstrated that PAS is bacteriostatic against M. tuberculosis, 
whereby the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranged between 1 and 10 μg/mL and anti-
bacterial activity was reported in a few MDR strains. 
In vivo efficacy has also been reported in mouse models of tuberculosis; the effective concentrations 
appear to range from 1% to 5%.  Para-aminosalicylic acid is believed to exert its effect on M. 
tuberculosis via an inhibition of folic acid biosynthesis and/or inhibition of mycobactin synthesis 
(which in turn reduces iron uptake).  However, the exact mechanism is yet to be elucidated. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies and safety pharmacology 
Safety pharmacology studies do not appear to have been conducted; however, clinical data are not 
indicative of a potential to cause substantial effects on the cardiovascular, respiratory or central 
nervous systems. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Animal studies have shown that PAS is rapidly and totally absorbed, and rapidly excreted.  The 
distribution of PAS in vivo was evaluated in the rat, guinea-pig and rabbit.  Repeated dose studies 
appear to have been performed in the rat and the data do not suggest any demonstrable retention of 
PAS.  The majority (80-90%) of the administered dose is excreted in urine and is excreted mostly as 
unchanged compound. 
Studies in the dog suggest that probenecid had no effect on the clearance of PAS and the applicant 
has suggested that clinical data are supportive of this finding.  Ex vivo studies using rat stomach and 
bowel suggest that PAS may interfere with the penetration of vitamin B12 across the bowel wall.  In 
light of these findings, the potential for malabsorption of Vitamin B12 has been included within the 
SmPC, section 4.5.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The applicant has suggested that a review of the literature identified no general toxicity studies of 
PAS that were relevant to the application.  Under these circumstances, non-clinical investigations are 
normally not required when there is sufficient well-documented clinical experience to establish all 
aspects of clinical efficacy and safety. No safety issues with the excipients, dibutyl sebacate and 
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose were identified.  The applicant has indicated that the maximum 
repeatable dose of dibutyl sebacate in a 2-year rat study was higher than that proposed clinically; 
which is supportive of the use of this excipient, given that the proposed treatment duration is up to 
24 months. 
The genotoxic potential of PAS-Na appears to have been investigated in vitro.  The active substance 
was non-mutagenic in the Ames test, but caused chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocyte 
cells.  However, the effective concentrations were higher than that observed clinically.  No in vivo 
genotoxicity studies have been performed with PAS-Na.  The applicant undertakes to do so (post-
authorisation). 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed which is not surprising as this compound was 
marketed well in advance of the ICH S9 Guideline.  The applicant has clarified that PAS has not been 
identified as a carcinogen and that no cases of cancer have been associated with the clinical use of 
PAS. 
The effects of PAS-Na on embryofetal development have been evaluated in the rat and rabbit.  An 
increase in fetal weight was noted in both the rat and rabbit.  Skeletal malformations (involving the 
skull bones and the sternum) were noted in the rat at 77 mg/kg/day.  Although these findings were 
not of a dose-related nature, it is evident that the exposures evaluated in the rabbit study are below 
those proposed clinically and so no definitive conclusions with respect to reprotoxicity can be made at 
this time.  The applicant has proposed to use standard pharmacovigilance reporting systems to 
monitor the risk of PAS-GR use in pregnant women.  
For the drug substance and drug product, the majority of the proposed impurity limits are in line with 
ICH Q3A(R2) and ICH Q3B(R2) Guidelines, and/or are acceptable from a toxicological point of view. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the Questions and answers document for the Guideline on the environmental risk 
assessment of medicinal products for human use [EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010], Log P has been 
determined experimentally (shake-flask, slow-stirring or eventually HPLC method); however, the final 
study report should be provided. 
In accordance with the EMA “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products 
for Human Use” [CHMP/SWP/4447/00, 1 June, 2006], the applicant has refined the fraction of market 
penetration (Fpen) based on prevalence of the disease, and estimated that the PEC surface water will 
be below the threshold limit of 0.01 µg/L.  Further clarification of calculations performed in order to 
refine the Fpen is required.  In addition, the applicant has not adequately discussed the impact of the 
anti-microbial activity of PAS-GR on the environment.  Further discussion with respect to the anti-
microbial activity of PAS-GR and its potential effect on the environment is necessary. 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for further investigation to be addressed: 
Assessment report  
EMA/18511/2014  
Page 20/55 
 
 
 
 
 
The Phase I ERA is still considered to be incomplete and the following issues still need to be 
addressed: 
- 
The applicant should ensure that the periodical consumption of PAS-GR is based upon the 
maximum proposed treatment duration of 24 months. 
-  During the calculation of CONai, it is not clear how the figure of 1100 was derived.  The formula 
described in the Q&A (p.12/12) on Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal 
products for human use concerning Fpen and CONai region should be correctly applied, and the 
values used should be clearly justified 
- 
In accordance with ERA guideline, for phase I, the estimation should be based only on the drug 
substance, irrespective of its route of administration, pharmaceutical form, metabolism and 
excretion.  Hence the factor of 0.8 for the calculation of CONai should be deleted. 
- 
The Phase I ERA is still considered to be incomplete as the applicant still has not adequately 
discussed the anti-microbial properties of PAS-GR.  At the very least, an estimate of 
PECSW:PNECmicroorganism should be provided as PAS is considered to be a compound with anti-
microbial activity that could affect microbial communities. 
The applicant is advised to carefully consider the outstanding deficiencies of the ERA and if the PECsw 
value is equal to or above 0.01g/L; then a Phase II environmental fate and effect analysis should be 
performed.  The applicant should commit to providing a revised ERA which addresses these concerns 
within 12-18 months of approval. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A number of in vitro studies have demonstrated that PAS is bacteriostatic against M. tuberculosis, 
whereby the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranged between 1 and 10 μg/mL and anti-
bacterial activity was reported in a few MDR strains.  The data presented suggest that PAS is fairly 
specific for M. tuberculosis; however, the applicant has subsequently clarified that PAS is active 
against M. bovis at similar concentrations. 
In vivo efficacy has also been reported in mouse models of tuberculosis; the effective concentrations 
appear to range from 1% to 5%; although, there was some discrepancy with respect to the effective 
vs the toxic concentrations. 
The distribution of PAS in vivo was evaluated in the rat, guinea-pig and rabbit.  Repeated dose 
studies appear to have been performed in the rat and the data did not suggest any demonstrable 
retention of PAS.  However, the maximum study duration appears to be 48 hours.  Given that the 
proposed treatment duration is up to 24 months, the applicant was asked to discuss the potential for 
retention of PAS-GR following repeated administration.  In the absence of non-clinical data, the 
applicant has made reference to clinical data which suggests that there is some evidence of 
accumulation over time.  However, the absence of published reports of severe adverse events (SAEs) 
with PAS or PAS-GR, suggests that any potential accumulation of PAS does not translate into 
significant toxicity. 
In accordance with the SmPC Guideline (2009), the applicant was asked to clarify the level of 
information available as to whether PAS is a substrate, inducer or inhibitor of the enzymes and 
transporter systems [e.g. cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, P-gp, organic anion transporters].  The 
data from the literature suggest that PAS-GR is unlikely to cause any clinically significant interactions 
Assessment report  
EMA/18511/2014  
Page 21/55 
 
 
 
 
 
at the level of the CYP enzyme.  The applicant was unable to locate data on the potential for 
interactions at the level of transporter systems and no further information is requested.  
The non-clinical safety data in support of PAS-GR was quite limited and it is the view of the CHMP 
that additional general toxicity data would not be necessary in light of the availability of clinical data.  
The applicant has agreed to submit further safety data by way of Periodic Safety Update Reports 
(PSURs).   
In vitro, PAS-GR was shown to be genotoxic at concentrations in excess of those proposed clinically.  
In accordance with the ICH S2(R1) guideline, the applicant should conduct an in vivo genotoxicity 
study and provide the data as a post-authorisation commitment.  In addition, Section 5.3 of the 
SmPC reflects the level of information available. 
The effects of PAS-Na on embryofetal development have been evaluated in the rat and rabbit.  
Skeletal malformations (involving the skull bones and the sternum) were noted in the rat at 77 
mg/kg/day.  Although the incidence of these findings was not considered to be dose-related, the 
proposed SmPC has been revised to reflect the observed findings and to give some indication of how 
the no-effect/effect doses relate to that proposed clinically. 
The Phase I environmental risk assessment (ERA) is still considered to be deficient.  The periodical 
consumption of PAS was based upon a 10 month treatment period when in clinical practice, PAS-GR 
may be administered for up to 24 months; so this should be rectified.  The formula described in the 
Q&A (p.12/12) on Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human 
use concerning Fpen and CONai region should be correctly applied, and the values used should be 
clearly justified.  In accordance with ERA guideline, for phase I, the estimation should be based only 
on the drug substance, irrespective of its route of administration, pharmaceutical form, metabolism 
and excretion.  Moreover, the applicant still has not adequately discussed any broad anti-microbial 
properties of PAS-GR.  At the very least, an estimate of PECSW:PNECmicroorganism should be 
provided as PAS is considered to be a compound with anti-microbial activity that could affect 
microbial communities.  The applicant is therefore advised to carefully consider the outstanding 
deficiencies of the ERA and if the PECsw value is equal to or above 0.01 µg/L; then a Phase II 
environmental fate and effect analysis should be performed. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers the following measures to address the non-clinical issues:  
-  An in vivo genotoxicity study should be conducted with PAS-GR; 
- 
- 
To provide a final study report for determination of the octanol:water coefficient 
To provide a revised environmental risk assessment within 12-18 months of Marketing

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
Due to the bibliographic nature of this application, it cannot be verified whether the studies cited were 
in compliance with GCP regulations.  However, it is assumed that these were conducted in compliance 
and accordance with the standards prevailing at the time of conduct of the studies. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
According to the applicant the initial and pivotal PK study (Peloquin 1994) for PAS-GR was conducted 
in 12 adult healthy volunteers (7 women including 1 dropout, and 5 men). Following an overnight fast 
and the oral administration of a single 4 g dose of Paser (PAS-GR), 15 serial plasma samples and 5 
consecutive urine collections were taken over a 24 hour-period.  Plasma concentrations of PAS and its 
inactive metabolite acetyl-PAS (AcPAS) were measured by HPLC.  
PAS showed a median (range) time to peak concentration of 6h (1.5 to 24h, with a single outlier 
female volunteer at 24h). Plasma concentrations peaked with a median (range) of 15.25μg/mL (9.36-
35.4). The acetylated metabolite of PAS (Ac-PAS) peaked with median (ranges) time of 8h (4-24) and 
plasma concentrations of 17.61μg/mL (13.17-22.86).  
The plasma half-life of PAS from PAS-GR was 1.62±0.85 h i.e. it was twofold higher when compared 
to that from earlier formulations, partially because of the prolonged absorption of the granules. The 
absorption profile of PAS-GR was delayed (no test) as compared with historical data.  
In a similar historical study (Wan 1974a5), a single dose of 4 g sodium PAS (PAS Na) was 
administered in a fasting state either dissolved or suspended in 250 mL water in 3 out of the 12 
healthy volunteers.  Peak plasma levels of PAS occurred at 0.5h. Other salts of PAS were also tested 
in groups of 3 healthy volunteers each and showed earlier peaks than with PAS-GR: 0.75h for 
potassium PAS and 1.5-2 h for calcium PAS, respectively. Moreover, the absorption of the free acid 
was erratic with delayed peaks after 3-4 h because of poor dissolution of the free acid given as a 
suspension.  A follow-up study from the same group (Wan 1974b6) confirmed most findings of the 
earlier study on a group of healthy volunteers participating to each of the 4 consecutive sequences 
(one sequence per drug).  
A comparison of PK parameters of single oral doses of 3-6 g of PAS or PAS-GR in various studies 
performed historically and involving a total of 60 adult healthy volunteers shown that absorption of 
four different drug forms was essentially complete, with sodium PAS having a statistically significant 
(p<0.05) higher rate of absorption than PAS or than Ca PAS (Wan 1974a, Wan 1974b). In adult 
healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of 4 g of PAS-GR the typical Cmax was much lower

(between 3 and 7 times) than that obtained with tablets of PAS. Peak plasma concentrations were 
also achieved much later with a typical Tmax delayed at least twofold with granules of PAS-GR 
compared with tablets of PAS.  
According to the applicant, the PAS-GR formulation should therefore allow a smoother rise in plasma 
concentrations. Moreover, its delayed absorption as compared to historical formulations of PAS should 
limit the occurrence of AE which were mostly related to an immediate gastric effect of these 
formulations.  
Influence of food 
The effects of food on the PK of a single dose of 6 g of Paser were evaluated under five different 
conditions (fasting, food, orange juice, antacids, and high-fat meal) in the Peloquin 2001 study. 
Subjects receiving a high-fat meal presented significantly delayed Tmax and higher Cmax when 
compared to fasting subjects (p<0.05). As expected when compared to data from previous studies 
with para-amino benzoic acid (Drucker 1964), both the rate and extent of absorption of PAS were 
affected by a high-fat meal.  Statistically significant (p<0.05) increases in AUC0-inf by 1.7 fold and in 
24h-urinary recovery by 1.5 fold were observed in the Peloquin 2001 study. An increased solubility of 
the free acid in the small intestine in the presence of lipids could be the cause of the increase in both 
the rate and extent of absorption. Following the higher amount administered as explained above, 
though not a direct comparison, the relative proportion of Ac-PAS in the urine was decreased from 
65% with 4 g PAS-GR (Peloquin 1994) to 53% with 6 g PAS-GR (Peloquin 2001).  
The changes in PK parameters were minimal with the co-administration of other “food” (either orange 
juice or antacids). 
Distribution 
According to the applicant the distribution of PAS has been established in historical studies, including 
Way 19487 , after a single oral dose of 4 g of sodium PAS.  At 15 minutes about 70% of the 
compound was present in the plasma and it remained unchanged after 3 hours.  In vitro experiments 
using the ultra-filtration technique with 0.05, 0.1 and 0.5 g of PAS dissolved in 3.5% BSA were used 
to determine the albumin binding of PAS.  At plasma levels of 40-100μg/mL, i.e. those achieved with 
historical formulations, 50-60% was bound to plasma proteins, presumably albumin (Figure 1).  
Albumin binding decreased from 70% to 60% and 50% in an inverse relationship to the increase in 
PAS concentration.  As concentrations achieved with PAS-GR are at least twofold lower than with 
these old formulations, albumin binding might not be higher with this new formulation.

Elimination 
In the Way 1948 study, nine healthy adults received a single 4 g oral dose of sodium PAS, 
approximately 85% of the compound was found urine within 7 hours either free or conjugated. 
According to the applicant, this rapid excretion of PAS suggested that to maintain clinical 
effectiveness it had to be given at four hour intervals.  As shown in two other studies (Wan 1974a 
and Wan 1974b), there was no significant difference in the total amount of excreted metabolites 
between all forms tested.  In the pivotal PK study for PAS-GR (Peloquin 1994), within 24h post-dose, 
the median quantity of PAS and that of Ac-PAS in the urine were approximately 260 and 2300 mg, 
respectively, showing that, as with historical formulations described above, most of the 4000 mg-
granules dose was recovered in the urine. Therefore the coefficient of extraction (F) 65.2% 
represents a low estimate for F, close to the ratio obtained from AUC0-24 of PAS-GR compared with 
simulated AUC0-24 from other PAS formulations in patients (59.6%). The median renal clearance of 
PAS-GR was only 7.3% of the Cl/F ratio3, as most of it was acetylated before excretion. The 
estimates for Ac-PAS renal clearance were similar to the Cl/F ratio, suggesting this metabolite is 
primarily cleared by the kidneys. 
Metabolism 
The major metabolites of PAS are by conjugation: to glycine in para-aminosalicyluric acid (PASU) up 
to 25% of the dose and to N-acetyl in N-acetyl para-aminosalicylic acid (Ac-PAS) up to 70% of the 
dose. Together they constitute more than 90% of the total metabolites of PAS found in urine as 
demonstrated in Way 1948, Wan 1974a and Wan 1974b). In the Wan 1974a study the apparent 
discrepancy in the bioavailability of PAS (calculated from plasma concentrations and urinary excreted 
metabolites) was explained by the concentration-dependent metabolism of PAS into Ac-PAS, 
responding to rate limiting capacity of acetylation during absorption, as previously shown with para-
amino benzoic acid (Drucker 1964). The follow-up study (Wan 1974b) confirmed the capacity-limited

formation of Ac- PAS. When the rate of absorption is high (increased drug doses, or boluses), during 
the absorption phase high concentrations of drug traverse the gut and perfuse the liver, saturating 
enzymatic acetylation capacities in the liver. Consequently, the relative proportion of acetylated 
metabolite in the excreted waste decreases. Conversely if the rate of absorption is low or doses are 
administered in repeated small intakes, concentrations of drug perfusing the liver cannot influence 
the metabolism and Ac-PAS is produced in proportionally larger quantities.  The ratio of Ac-PAS/PAS 
in the urine was 2.74 for PAS acid (with absorption delayed) compared with a mean of 1.28 for the 
salts (Wan 1974b). Expressed as a percentage of absorbed drug excreted as Ac-PAS, there was a 
significantly higher (p<0.05) proportion of 73.1% for PAS compared with 56.4% for PAS Na, 57.7% 
for PAS Ca and 54.5% for PAS K.  Moreover, this capacity limitation step occurs during the absorption 
phase and first-pass effect in the GI tract and the liver, as the rate constant for elimination was the 
same in all cases. 
Special populations 
Patients with hepatic impairment  
The PK of 20 mg/kg IV-PAS administered in 3 min-boluses were compared in 7 patients with liver 
disease (4 alcoholic cirrhosis, 2 acute viral hepatitis, 1 chronic cholangitis) was compared with the PK 
obtained in 7 healthy volunteers in a study8 by Held. The half-life and plasma clearance were within 
the same ranges in the 2 populations as seen in Table 1 below.  
Patients with renal impairment 
In the study by Held, 5 patients with terminal renal failure who were under chronic dialysis showed 
half-life in the same range as that in healthy volunteers, however the plasma clearance was 
significantly lower (p <0.025) in healthy volunteers, see Table 1.  
Table 1 
The elimination rate of PAS depends on its metabolism and renal clearance which are both dose-
dependent. However as the renal clearance of the 2 main metabolites are greater than that of PAS, 
the rate limiting parameter of its elimination should be liver function. However this was not confirmed 
in this study as the PK was not altered in patients with hepatic failure. Conversely in renal failure 
patients, PAS was more rapidly eliminated which was also unexpected from a product mainly 
eliminated unchanged by the kidney. The increased plasma clearance of PAS could be explained by an 
altered distribution (partly related to a decreased protein binding) of the drug and/or an increased 
activity of the conjugation enzymes in patients with terminal renal failure.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Based on early studies showing prolonged half-life, plasma concentrations, urinary excretion of free 
fraction in rapid acetylators, and decreased albumin binding of isoniazid in the presence of PAS. 910    
In the studies by Palva11 and Heinivaara12 PAS caused decreased intestinal absorption of vitamin B12, 
leading to deficiencies seen during prolonged treatment of at least two weeks. The interaction could 
be mediated via competitive inhibition of the absorption of folate which is structurally similar to PAS; 
the production of the intrinsic factor or its binding to vitamin B12 remained normal1314. According to 
the study by Heinivaara megaloblastic anaemia however is only extremely rarely reported and in a 
study in 74 patients treated with PAS for a maximum of 3 years no case was reported.  
Statistically significantly decreased serum concentrations and prolonged Tmax of rifampicin 
(10mg/kg/d) were observed throughout the 8 hour-observation period in 30 patients concomitantly 
receiving oral 0.2 mg/kg/d of PAS granulates (Boman 1971). This interaction was actually related to 
one excipient (bentonite) in the formulation of the granules (and not in the tablets) which was shown 
to adsorb rifampicin rapidly and strongly (Boman 1975).  The PAS-GR formulation is devoid of any 
bentonite.  
PAS was shown to significantly interfere with the absorption of oral digoxin by reducing its plasma 
concentrations and AUC. It was shown however that this interference was not by adsorption with 
digoxin but possibly through changes in the function of the intestinal wall as shown on a severely 
reduced D-xylose absorption15 
In an heterogeneous group of 5 healthy volunteers and 6 TB patients, granulated sodium PAS in a 
dose regimen of 3x4 g on Day1 and 10 g on Day 2 did not modify plasma levels of cycloserine (3x250 
mg on Day1 and 500 mg on Day 2) as assayed in bioassays, whereas the chemical assays showed 
significantly (p<0.05) lower concentrations of cycloserine.  It was hypothesized that PAS could delay 
the biotransformation of cycloserine therefore prolong its half-life and retard the formation of inactive 
metabolites of cycloserine;  PAS did not modify the albumin binding of cyscloserin or its urinary 
elimination.16 
In another study, commonly co-administered second line drugs were reported to have no effect on 
the PK of PAS-GR in healthy volunteers.  However, no group receiving PAS-GR alone was available; 
moreover these PK data are not provided in the publication: it is only stated that very similar PK 
parameters were observed when PAS-GR was administered together with cycloserine, ethionamide, 
clofazimine and pyridoxine (Peloquin 2001) as compared to former studies without these co-
administered drugs (Peloquin 1994).

In low income countries the incidence of HIV-1 infection in MDR-TB and XDR-TB patients is common. 
Studies evaluating drug-drug interactions between second-line anti-TB medicines, including PAS, and 
anti-retrovirals have not been conducted to date. Considering the PK parameters of PAS and its 
metabolic profile it is proposed that significant interactions are unlikely and thus it is recommended to 
use standard dosing regimens of PAS to treat in co-infected HIV patients.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
According to the literature, para-aminosalicylic acid is bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis.  
The mechanism of action of para-aminosalicylic acid resembles that of sulfonamides, competing with 
paraminobenzoic acid (PABA) for dihydropteroate synthetase (dhps), a key enzyme in the 
biosynthesis of folates.  Para-aminosalicylic acid appears to be a weak inhibitor of DHP in vitro, 
raising the possibility that it may have a different and/or additional target within the folate synthesis 
pathway. 
In general the selection of resistant strains by antibacterial agents that inhibit folate synthesis is a 
relatively common and hence problematical phenomenon. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In vitro studies17 revealed that a concentration of 1.5μg/mL of PAS is sufficient to inhibit the growth 
of mycobacterium tuberculosis but this is not elaborated upon.  
The study by Peloquin in 1994 showed that plasma levels of PAS exceeded the MIC for TB (1-2 
μg/mL) for over 24 hours with the recommended posology of 12 g/day given in three divided doses.  
In the view of the investigators, the MIC level obtained for Paser was above that required for 
therapeutic activity for over 24 hours as according to several references the MIC for PAS ranges 
between <1 and 2μg/mL.  
According to the applicant, the MIC level and time above this level (1 and 2 μg/mL) was considered to 
be the predictor of therapeutic activity as up to 20 years ago it was common practice to select the 
dosage regimen for an antibiotic to achieve blood levels above the MIC for the entire dosing interval. 
This approach was initially based on clinical experience with agents that were not rapidly bactericidal, 
e.g. the sulphonamides, tetracyclines and penicillin. Since then the relevance of the PK-PD 
relationship to the efficacy of some antibacterial agents has been debated and for most antibiotic 
classes other PK/PD indices have been shown to drive efficacy. These are either: Cmax/MIC, AUC/MIC 
or time > MIC. It is not fully elucidated which parameter drives response to PAS.

Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Frequency of dosing  
The minimum frequency of dosing for a standard 4g dose of PAS-GR was evaluated within a set of 
sequential studies (Peloquin 1999). The serum concentrations achieved following 8 days of treatment 
with either 4 g given twice (BID) or once daily (OD), respectively in two groups of 6 MDR-TB patients 
each were measured. After twice daily dosing the median (range) steady-state plasma concentrations 
after a one week-treatment were 25.8 (4.2-53.2) μg/mL at 4h post dose, 23.3 (1.6-51) μg/mL at 8h 
post dose and 16.4 (5.6-44.5) μg/mL at 12h post dose, respectively. As can be seen, plasma 
concentrations were relatively stable over the sampling period. Conversely after OD dosing, plasma 
concentrations were 23.4 (14.6-30.3) μg/mL at 6h post dose but dropped to 3.7 (1.6-13.8) μg/mL at 
12h post dose and to nil at 24h post dose. According to the applicant these results indicated that 
PAS-GR when administered twice daily but not once daily provided levels above the MIC for the entire 
dosing  
In the Peloquin 1999 study, data from 40 MDR-TB patients (14 females, 26 males) on chronic 
treatment (duration not specified) with 4 g PAS-GR twice daily was evaluated.  Median plasma levels 
were 24.83 (0-95.57) μg/mL within 4-8h post dose and 20.58 (0-90.51) μg/mL within 9-12h post 
dose.  According to the applicant these results confirms that the BID dosing provides MIC above 1 
μg/mL over the day in long-term treatment. Only 2/88 plasma concentrations determinations were nil 
and only 5/88 were lower than 1μg/mL.  It confirmed that adequate concentrations were achieved 
during long-term treatment with a twice daily dosing of 4 g PAS-GR.  
Regarding dosing in children, a study with slow release PAS conducted in S Africa (Liwa et al., 2012), 
indicates that PAS at 150 mg/kg daily dosage divided in 1 or 2 gifts would provide similar exposure as 
in adults.  
Dose effect  
In chronic use of PAS-GR median levels of PAS were relatively steady over the 4h-periods allowing 
pooling data of the 3 time points to evaluate the difference in PK after the initial single dose in 
volunteers and PK at steady-state after a multiple dose regimen in TB patients (Peloquin 1994). 
Median plasma levels of approximately 10μg/mL after the first dose rose to 28.5 μg/mL after 1 week 
of a multiple dose regimen (4 g tid), indicating accumulation of PAS with a multiplication by a median 
factor of 3.5 of plasma concentrations (Peloquin 1994).  
Based on findings of the two studies above it is not justified to use doses of PAS higher than 4 g per 
intake. 
Implications of different formulations of PAS on the PK-PD profile  
The original studies of the efficacy of PAS (British Medical Research Council 1950, Tuberculosis 
Chemotherapy Centre 1960) used the sodium salt.  Since then several different formulations of PAS 
were developed with the aims of reducing the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects and extending the 
half-life to enable fewer administrations per day as, at the time, the target PK-PD parameter was the 
duration of the serum level of PAS exceeding the MIC.  
It was clear from several studies that the different forms of PAS presented different PK profiles. 
Figure 2, from the Wan 1974b study shows the PK profile of the sodium, potassium and calcium salts 
of PAS and the free acid. 
Assessment report  
EMA/18511/2014  
Page 29/55 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2 
A resin complex formulation of the free acid, designed to release the drug more slowly in the small 
intestine so as to reduce gastro-intestinal toxicity and to extend the half-life was approved in the US 
and Europe (Rezipas DESI 1969). The PK profiles of this product, the salts and the free acid were 
compared in a study18. The free acid (PAS) and the resin complex form of PAS tended to show lower 
and delayed peak plasma concentrations, just like PAS-GR. 
PAS free acid and PAS resin showed a delayed absorption and reduced Cmax when compared to the 
PAS salts. The delayed absorption has been reported to be due to either the lower solubility of the 
free acid in aqueous conditions in the small intestine or to the slower release from the resin complex.  
These differences in PK profile between the rapidly absorbed salts and PAS in the form of the free 
acid or that of the resin complex were not considered to affect the efficacy of the drug against M. 
tuberculosis as all agents met the surrogate marker of time above MIC.  Moreover, X-Ray data from 
318 patients showed no statistically significant differences between 6 formulations in clinical 
improvement from after 2 months treatment (Figure 3).  Bacteriologic analyses also indicated that 
the 6 formulations were equal in preventing or postponing the development of TB resistant to 
isoniazid or to other antimicrobial drugs administered in 709 patients (Yue 1966).

Figure 3 
Very little information exists on the relevant PK/PD relationships for second-line agents used to treat 
MDR-TB. The documented clinical efficacy of PAS combined with relatively infrequent resistance 
justifies its use as a bacteriostatic second-line drug (Dartois 2010).  
According to the applicant, in a review of PK/PD parameters of anti-TB drugs, PAS, as a bacteriostatic 
agent, has surprisingly higher Cmax/MIC and AUC/MIC ratios when compared with the bactericidal 
agents such as isoniazid and rifampicin (Budha 2008). As a bacteriostatic agent it may be that the 
time above the MIC may be the most important parameter; however no ultimate evidence is 
available.  
Peloquin’s group in the US recommends administration of PAS-granules to keep inhibitory 
concentrations above the MIC for most of the dose interval and to target a Cmax of 20-60 μg/mL 
which occurs at approximately 6 hours post dose with Paser (vs. 2 hour post dose with the earlier 
tablet forms). They recommend a dose increase if the Cmax is below 10μg/mL (Peloquin 2002). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
In the pivotal PK study (Peloquin 1994), the median time to peak concentration for PAS-GR was 6 
hours with a range of 1.5 to 24 hours (delayed in comparison to earlier formulations) and plasma 
concentrations PAS-GR peaked with a (range) of 15.25µg/ml (9.36- 35.4).  These values appear to 
be lower than what has been described for earlier and other formulations of PAS (PAS Na, PAS K and 
PAS Ca), which would fit with the anticipated formulation effects. It should however be noted that 
there is a lack of clarity regarding the assay methodologies of the quoted references. Therefore it is 
not clear whether any cross-study comparison will be valid.

Food effect 
One literature reference is provided to describe the effect of food on PAS-GR, this appeared to show 
that the AUC of PAS-GR increased with administration of food. However, other drugs were co-
administered and the effect of these drugs on the PK of PAS is not known or evident from the 
references.   
Distribution, metabolism and elimination 
PAS appears to be relatively bound to albumin, this binding appear to become saturated with increase 
in plasma concentrations of PAS. The major metabolites of PAS are para-aminosalicyluric acid and N-
acetyl para-aminosalicyclic acid as they appear to constitute 90% of the total metabolites. However, 
it is unclear what the effect of genetic polymorphism on PAS is. PAS and its metabolite Ac-PAS 
appears to be primarily cleared via the kidneys. From the Peloquin 1994 study, the plasma half- life 
of PAS-GR was estimated to be approximately 1.62 hours; this said to be higher when compared to 
earlier formulations.  
Special populations 
The results of the study that was done in patients with renal and hepatic impairment showed that the 
PK of PAS was unaltered in patients with hepatic impairment. However, no conclusion can be made as 
there is a lack of clarity regarding the severity of the hepatic impairment. This same study also 
showed that in patients with terminal renal failure and on chronic dialysis there was an increase in 
plasma clearance of PAS. However, no conclusion can be made regarding these results. In the 
absence of data regarding use in patients with renal impairment, warnings have been included in 
sections 4.3 and 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Children 
Data from a study conducted in South Africa (Liwa 2012) substantiate the proposed posology in 
children.  10 children were included in the study and were given 75mg/kg bid on the first visit and 
150mg/kg OD on the second visit. The Cmax after the 75mg bid and 150mg OD regimen were 45.4 
µg/ml and 56.5 µg/ml, respectively and the AUC0-12 were 233.3 and 277.9 µg/hr/ml, respectively. 
These results obtained in visit 1 and 2 were apparently not different statistically from each another 
and from the results obtained in adults.  Additionally, the mean and median plasma concentrations 
were above the MIC for M.tuberculosis during the sampling period (12 hours). However, there was a 
very high variability and the mean 12 h concentration was 6.8±6.7 μg/mL and 21.2±29.6μg/mL after 
75 mg/kg BID or 150 mg/kg OD, respectively; also, a number of children had individual plasma 
concentrations falling below MIC. Therefore 150mg/kg given daily is probably the barest minimum 
required to achieve accumulation and a sustained concentration in children.  
Interactions  
It appears that PAS might interfere with the PK of other antituberculosis drugs. It is suggested that 
PAS prolongs the T1/2 and also cause decreased albumin binding of isoniazid in rapid acetylators. It 
also appears that PAS prolongs the half-life of cycloserine.  Additionally, it is suggested that PAS 
interferes with the absorption of Vitamin B12 and digoxin. Overall it is considered that the PK drug-
drug interactions for PAS have been incompletely characterised. No studies or literature references 
have been identified which adequately addressed these specific issues.  
It is unlikely that the applicant would be able to carry out the whole range of studies normally 
required as this application is based entirely on bibliographic references. However, these gaps have 
been highlighted in the SmPC.

Pharmacodynamics 
Overall the pharmacodynamic action of para-aminosalicylic acid appears to be poorly characterised. 
However, PAS is considered to be bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  
Para-aminosalicylic acid appears to be a weak inhibitor of DHP in vitro, raising the possibility that it 
may have a different and/or additional target within the folate synthesis pathway. 
According to the references provided, the MIC for PAS is most likely between 1 and 10μg/mL.  
The PK/PD relationship is also unclear but it has been suggested to be the time above MIC based on 
historical data. 
There is no description of the pharmacodynamic action of PAS when used in combination with other 
anti-tuberculosis drugs.  It is would appear that none of the other anti-tuberculosis agents act via the 
folate synthesis pathway and it is unlikely that there is a potential for them to compete with or 
oppose PAS at the receptor level.  
In the Peloquin study, when 4g of PAS-GR was administered, the Cmax was reduced and absorption 
delayed in comparison to the various salts of PAS (Na, Ca and K) and the free acid. According to the 
applicant, PAS-GR should be administered to keep inhibitory concentrations above the MIC for most 
of the dose interval and Cmax should be targeted between 20-60µg/ml as Tmax is expected to occur 
approximately 6 hours post-dose.  It appears that with twice daily dosing of PAS-GR steady-state 
plasma concentration remain relatively constant for up to 12 hours in contrast to the once daily 
regimen where plasma concentrations dropped by 12 hours post-dose.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics  
In conclusion, the pharmacokinetics of para-aminosalicylic acid has been broadly characterised and it 
appears that PAS is primarily metabolised via acetylation to N-acetyl para-aminosalicylic acid and it is 
excreted mainly through the kidneys. There is a lack of knowledge regarding DDIs, transporter 
systems and excretion via the renal pathway but these gaps have been highlighted in the SmPC.  
The performance of the current PAS product is expected to be the same as that tested by Peloquin et 
al. 
Pharmacodynamics  
The suggestion for the PK/PD relationship is the time above MIC but other parameters might be of 
relevance. Data from a South African study showed similar PK parameters between adults and 
children.

British Medical Research Council. Treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis with Streptomycin 
and para-amino-salicylic acid (1950) 
The first of these was a controlled trial19 coordinated by the Medical Research Council in the UK. In 
this study 166 patients aged 15-30 years presenting with bilateral pulmonary TB categorized on X-
Ray classification were randomly allocated to receive one of the following 3 treatment regimens for 3 
months with a further 3 month-follow-up period (where the treatment was either collapse therapy or 
streptomycin in the PAS group). The outcome at 6 months is reported hereafter. Patients were 
randomized and treated as follows:  
1.  Streptomycin 1g per day by single IM injection (N= 54)  
2.  PAS 20 g of the sodium salt per day given in four divided doses, per os (N= 59)  
3.  Streptomycin 1g/d and PAS 20 g/d as above (N=53)  
According to the applicant, although this old study was not GCP compliant (e.g. patients were 
unaware that they were participating in an investigation), its methodology is well described and 
appropriate statistics were relevant to the comparison of streptomycin vs. PAS groups. These groups 
can be justifiably compared as they are well balanced and with an important number of similar 
subjects. Various endpoints including clinical (temperature, sedimentation rates), radiological, and 
bacteriological assessments (bacteriological content of the sputum, bacterial drug resistance) were 
assessed in the study. Statistical methods are not described and no test or p-value is given; it is only 
mentioned that any observed differences were statistically significant.  
Through historical comparison with a former study from the Medical Research Council in 1948 in 
which the control group were treated with bed rest only, this present study showed that PAS given 
alone had a clear beneficial effect when compared with no treatment (bed rest alone) in the previous 
trial.  
Results demonstrated that collapse therapy was similar in both groups in the follow-up period (it 
occurred in 20 PAS patients compared with 22 streptomycin patients) as well as at each time point. 
Clinically, responses were equally rapid in streptomycin and PAS groups and weight gain similar after 
six months. There were 2 (3%) patients deaths and 4 cases (7%) deteriorated (radiological 
assessment) during treatment with PAS, which historically can be compared to 14 (27%) deaths and 
18 (34%) deteriorations in untreated patients, and is compared to 5 (9%) deteriorations and 5 (9%)  
deaths with streptomycin alone in the same trial. On X–Ray evaluation, PAS was found to be 
statistically (test not described) less effective than streptomycin alone (improved patients: 33 (56%) 
vs. 40 (74%), respectively). 
In the sixth month the number of patients with negative bacteriological results (via direct 
examination and culture) were significantly higher (test not described) in the combination group than 
in the two other monotherapy groups with 28 (33%) vs. 16 (19%) and 6 (8%) for streptomycin and 
PAS, respectively. When given in combination there was a dramatic decline in the development of 
streptomycin-resistant bacterial organisms: 33 out of 49 (67.3%) patients developed resistant 
organisms in the streptomycin treated group compared with 5 out of 48 (10.4%) patients receiving 
the combination. At the end of the six month-period 89% of the combination patients producing 
positive culture had completely sensitive strains vs. only 21% of the streptomycin alone patients.

According to the applicant, this study also supported the notion that streptomycin resistance was 
responsible at least in part for failure of the drug to prevent clinical deterioration and that the better 
results obtained with combination to PAS were due to maintenance of streptomycin sensitivity. The 
study showed that this effect was maintained up until the sixth month of follow-up despite the 
treatment had only lasted 3 months.  
Tuberculosis Chemotherapy Centre, Madras.  A concurrent comparison of isoniazid plus 
PAS with three regimens of isoniazid alone in the domiciliary treatment of pulmonary 
tuberculosis in south India (1960) 
The second study20 evaluated the efficacy of PAS given in combination with isoniazid compared to the 
efficacy of three different regimens of isoniazid alone in Madras, India.  
In this prospective, double-blind, controlled trial 341 patients aged over 12 years (only 2 patients 
were less than 15 years, both belonging to the combination group) were included. They presented 
with acute pulmonary TB with a positive bacteriological testing on a minimum of 4 sputum specimens 
and were randomised to receive 12 month-combination therapy with: 
-  PAS plus isoniazid standard dose (N= 90) or 
-  One of three different schedules of isoniazid monotherapy (N=87 for isoniazid standard dose 
group).  
The follow-up lasted five years. The dosages of PAS and isoniazid used were based on patients’ 
weight. The mean daily dose at the start of treatment was 0.23 g/kg (the standard dose was 10 g/d 
and ranged from 7.5 to 10 g/d according to body weight) for PAS (given twice daily as the sodium 
salt of PAS) and 4.6 mg/kg for isoniazid in the combination therapy group, and 8.7 mg/kg (i.e. a 
double dose, given in a single or in 2 separated doses) and 4.5 mg/kg (given twice daily) in the 
monotherapy groups (the standard dose was 200 mg/day and varied depending on body weight).  
The study was methodologically acceptable (double blind) though not GCP compliant as there was 
absence of informed consent and recording of religious information). Moreover, there were some 
statistically significant (p<0.01) pre-treatment differences between groups in the extent of cavitation 
for the combination group as 15 (17%) patients had gross extent cavitation compared with 8 (9%) in 
the standard dose isoniazid monotherapy group.  
The radiographic spread of tuberculosis occurred in 26% and 21% in each group, respectively, and 
hence despite pre-treatment differences, (cf. above) after over 12 full months, 85% of the 
combination and 62% of the comparable dose isoniazid monotherapy group showed a moderate or 
greater improvement. Over the year of treatment 35 patients had their treatment changed because of 
clinical deterioration with a strikingly significant difference of only 1 patient vs. 15 (p<0.001) in the 
combination and isoniazid standard treatment groups, respectively.  
At 12 months, negative cultures were seen in 90% of patients treated with PAS and isoniazid 
compared with 51% of patients with the comparable dose of isoniazid monotherapy regimen, a 
difference statistically significant (p<0.01). Resistance to isoniazid emerged within 1 month in the 
monotherapy groups and more slowly in the combination therapy group. At 12 months, 8% of 
patients in the PAS plus isoniazid group had isoniazid-resistant bacterial organisms vs. 47% of 
patients who received the comparable dose of isoniazid monotherapy. At 12 months 86% vs. 44% 
(p<0.01) were bacteriologically quiescent among the two groups above, respectively. The authors

concluded that the potential public health risk from excretors of isoniazid-resistant organisms was 
appreciable with isoniazid monotherapy; a risk that started early in therapy and continued throughout 
the 12-month therapy period.  
When comparing the combination group to the equivalent dose of isoniazid monotherapy group, only 
one patient of the 3 who died vs. 4 of the 4 who died, actually died from pulmonary tuberculosis. 
According to the applicant, these two pivotal trials converge in demonstrating the statistically 
significant benefit of combination therapy with 12-20 g/d PAS for 3-12 months over monotherapy of 
either isoniazid or streptomycin on clinical, radiological and bacteriological endpoints in a 
representative number of patients with pulmonary TB.  
Supportive studies 
Several controlled clinical trials carried out at the Tuberculosis Chemotherapy Centre in Madras, India 
or in the UK by the British Medical Research Council are considered by the applicant to be supportive 
of combination therapy with PAS in treating active TB (Table 3). For a series of methodological 
reasons summarized in the table, these studies can only be considered as supportive to the efficacy 
of PAS. However, the high numbers of patients exposed for long periods of time to treatment with 
PAS are of particular interest for the safety evaluation.

These supportive trials have been carried out in a total of 1626 (mainly adult) patients with 
pulmonary tuberculosis, among who 920 received PAS in a combination therapy group.  The duration 
of treatment with PAS-combination was 12 months and in the majority of cases the dose was 
between 0.17 and 0.3 g/kg/day (i.e. 10-15 g/d) except in 2 studies which evaluated a lower dose of 
6 g/day PAS (Tuberculosis Chemotherapy Center 1973; BMJ 1973). Bacteriological efficacy results 
were favourable to the combination with PAS, provided the dose was sufficient. This was clearly 
shown on the incidence and speed of emergence of resistant strains as compared to isoniazid 
monotherapy (Selkon 1964).  
Most of the studies detailed above are further elaborated in the safety section and not always the 
same numbers of patients are reported for the efficacy and safety section.  
More recent studies specifically in MDR-TB have been performed in India (e.g. Prasad 2006). Multiple 
second line treatments (including 0.15 g/kg/day PAS in two separate intakes) were associated with

therapeutic efficacy of 74% bacterial conversion in 46 hospitalized patients (13-62 year-old; 24-64 
kg) who were resistant to at least five first line drugs. Despite the fact that it remains difficult to 
attribute the individual benefit to one drug or the other, it points towards a very favourable effect of 
PAS. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Para-aminosalicylic acid gastro-resistant granules (PAS-GR) has been proposed for the treatment of 
tuberculosis in combination with other active agents, especially in multi-resistant TB or in situations 
when primary medication therapy with recommended agents is not possible due to a combination of 
resistance and or intolerance.  
This is a bibliographic application and no clinical studies have been conducted and demonstration of 
efficacy of this product relies entirely on historical literature references. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The two pivotal references and the supportive references were all conducted pre-GCP and therefore 
not entirely in line with GCP principles. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study by the Medical research council showed that 56% of the patients that were given just PAS 
improved on x-ray assessment compared with 87% in the group that were given a combination of 
streptomycin and PAS. However, when compared with bed rest alone, PAS appeared to be better. In 
terms of bacteriological assessment of sputum, PAS in combination with Streptomycin appeared to be 
better than PAS alone or streptomycin alone (in the 6th month of treatment, 33% of the combination 
group had negative cultures compared with 8% in the PAS group). Additionally, when PAS was given 
in combination with streptomycin, the emergence of streptomycin resistance was reduced as 89% of 
the combination group had sensitive strains compared with 21% of the streptomycin only group. 
In the study by the Tuberculosis Chemotherapy Centre there was a rapid decline in the proportion of 
patients with positive cultures.  By 3 months, 78% of the patients who were given PAS + isoniazid 
had negative cultures. On x-ray assessment 63% of the patients on PAS and isoniazid who had 
moderate cavitations at the start of treatment had no cavitations at 12 months.  Also, it appears that 
when PAS was given in combination with isoniazid the incidence of isoniazid resistant organisms was 
reduced in comparison to the isoniazid only groups. 
In terms of the use of PAS in the treatment of MDR-TB/XDR-TB, these two studies provide some 
evidence that PAS or PAS-GR could be useful in the treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis 
(MDR-TB) and extensively-drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) as the emergence of resistance was 
lower when PAS was co-administered with either streptomycin or isoniazid.  
The results from the other literature references support the effectiveness of PAS in the treatment of 
active TB when used in combination with other drugs.  A recent study in 46 previously treated 
tuberculosis patients, presenting with MDR-TB and given a regimen containing PAS at 150 mg/kg/day 
in two divided dosages, showed sputum culture conversion in 29 out of 39 hospitalised patients 
(74%) after mean time of 4.4 months.

Additional expert consultation 
No additional experts were consulted during the assessment. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
The applicant provided data from a study conducted in South Africa (Liwa 2012) to substantiate the 
proposed posology in children (see Pharmacokinetics section for details).   
The proposal is for the dosage to be adapted to the patient’s weight at 150 mg/kg/day, divided in two 
to three intakes.  However, for a 50 mg/kg thrice daily dosage recommendation, no PK/ PD data have 
been provided in support.  In fact, a higher dosage of 75 mg/kg t.d.s could have some advantages 
but currently no information is available around its potential adequacy.  As such, the CHMP 
recommends that the proposed dosage, adapted to the patient’s weight at 150 mg/kg, be divided in 
two intakes daily. 
In view of the submitted data, the CHMP considers that PAS has a recognised efficacy in terms of the 
conditions set out in Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, the references provided by the applicant suggest that when PAS was used in 
combination with other anti-tuberculosis drugs (Streptomycin and Isoniazid), it could be effective in 
the treatment of active TB. It also appears to reduce the incidence of resistant organisms. It is 
therefore considered that PAS can make a contribution as part of a treatment regimen for MDR-TB or 
XDR-TB. It is possible to assume that if the MIC for Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains within the 
normal population distribution then there is a potential that PAS may assist in the overall treatment 
regimen. 
In view of the submitted data, the CHMP considers that PAS has a recognised efficacy in terms of the 
conditions set out in Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
When PAS was introduced (1946) the incidence of TB was very high in Western Europe and the USA 
with reported rates in many countries of over 150:100,000.  In the UK, where the number of cases 
has been recorded since 1900, over 80,000 notified cases were reported in 1945 (an incidence of 
180:100,000 -NHS Tuberculosis 2006).  In France, TB became a disease of mandatorily notification in 
1966, and in 1972 its incidence was reported as 60:100,000 with over 30,000 cases (La tuberculose -
fr, 2000). 
Following the confirmation of the efficacy of PAS and the discovery that combined therapy with 
isoniazid and streptomycin reduced the development of drug resistance, its use in combination 
became accepted practice. After extensive use in the treatment of TB, the adverse event profile of the 
active substance (PAS) is quite well characterized. Different preparations of PAS were developed with 
the aim of reducing the GI toxicity. Moreover free PAS acid is poorly soluble in water (0.2%) and 
aqueous solutions of the acid are very unstable and are decarboxylated to meta-aminophenol.

Patient exposure 
None directly provided. 
The applicant states that the manufacturer of Paser (PAS-GR), Jacobus Pharmaceutical Company Inc, 
has supplied a total of 781,359 packs to the US and overseas between 1996 and 2010. Assuming 
each patient is treated for 2 years as per the WHO recommendations and a patient will consume 3 
packs per month (one pack is 10 days treatment at one sachet 3 times a day) or 36 packs per year. 
There are therefore over 21,000 patient-years or if all receive 2 year treatment, over 10,000 patients 
during this time.  Additionally, Paser has been available in South Africa on a named-patient basis 
since 2008 and a total of 42,649 packs have been supplied from 2008-2010, i.e. 580 patients treated 
for 2 years. It is not possible to determine how many patients in the EEA have received Paser over 
this period as Jacobus supplies Paser to the WHO and not to individual countries who obtain the 
product via the Green Light Committee Program. In the EEA Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have been 
approved into the Green Light Committee program since 2000 and may have procured Paser for the 
treatment of MDR- and XDR-TB from the Global Drug Facility. The NGO, Médecins Sans Frontières, 
also supply Paser and other forms of PAS to developing countries with a high burden of TB 
throughout the world. Currently they are treating over 2,000 patients with PAS (Ms. Karen Day, 
Personal communication November 2011).  
All of the above indicate that PAS has been included in standard treatment regimens for MDR- and 
XDR- TB in Europe for at least 10 years and hence the use of the product in this indication can be 
said to be well established and safe as there was no report of SAE published. 
Adverse events 
In the early and pivotal clinical trial comparing PAS with streptomycin, 34 (58%) patients reported GI 
side effects including nausea in 22 (38%), diarrhoea in 19 (33%), and vomiting in 14 (24%) with 
sodium PAS at a dose of 20 g/day alone and in 27 (51%) of patients in the combination group (British 
Medical Research Council 1950).  In a single instance it was necessary to reduce the daily dose of 
PAS, but no patient had to discontinue treatment.  Three patients developed a rash under PAS alone: 
in two it remained not severe and the treatment could be continued; the other patient developed an 
extensive rash with fever after 4 weeks of treatment. Four patients developed rashes in the 
combination group.  
In the other pivotal trial (Tuberculosis Chemotherapy Centre 1960), a total of 7 patients had to 
change treatment because of toxicity; only one case occurred in the combination group (vs. none in 
the isoniazid standard dose monotherapy group: i.e. all other 6 cases were in the double dose 
isoniazid monotherapy groups). This change in treatment was due to a hypersensitivity reaction 
attributed to PAS.  Moreover, 3 cases of hypersensitivity to PAS (2 rashes and 1 fever with intense 
itching) were encountered among the 90 patients in the combination group.  An episode of jaundice 
unrelated-to-treatment but to an intercurrent hepatitis developed in one patient. An episode of 
isoniazide-related neuritis occurred in one patient from the combination group vs. none from similar 
dose isoniazide monotherapy group (and 19 in double dose isoniazide groups). Eventually no patient 
had to receive a reduced dosage of PAS because of an adverse event.  
In the study conducted in children (Soderhjelm 1949), no signs of toxicity (leucopenia or vomiting) 
were reported.  
As the original product, PAS free acid, caused acute gastro-intestinal (GI) discomfort very rapidly 
after ingestion, many patients could not tolerate the medicinal product which could lead to poor 
compliance in chronic treatment.  As the solubility of PAS increases with increasing pH, TB patients

receiving chronic treatment with high doses of PAS, received the sodium salt or co-administration 
with bicarbonate rather than the poorly soluble free acid in order to minimize the dangers of possible 
renal damage in (Way 1948).  Different preparations of PAS were developed with the aim of reducing 
the GI toxicity (Yue 1966).  Others which were reported to offer better GI tolerance were:

ascorbic conjugate of PAS (Pentikainen 1973),  
PAS adsorbed on to an anionic exchange resin (Hollander 1955)  
phenyl PAS (Cohen 1958)  
Sodium salt of PAS was reported to cause less nausea than the free acid formulation (Way 1948). The 
adverse events profiles of phenyl p-aminosalicylate, para-aminosalicylate anionic exchange resin 
complex, sodium PAS and calcium PAS were actually compared in a first study (Table 4, Cohen 
1958).

The reduction in the number of patients reporting GI symptoms with the resin and phenyl forms of 
PAS in the 2 studies above indicated that it was possible to formulate PAS to improve GI safety when 
compared with the salts.

GI tolerability of PAS-GR  
The development objective for PAS-GR was to provide a therapeutically active formulation of PAS 
which would avoid the high level of GI side effects seen with earlier forms of the salts and to more 
resemble the PK profile of later developments such as the resin complex of PAS.  
The purpose of PK studies with the PAS-GR formulation was also to evaluate the safety profile and 
tolerability of single and repeated doses of the product in patients and healthy volunteers (Peloquin 
1994, Peloquin 1999, Peloquin 2001).  In healthy volunteers receiving a single 4 g dose of PAS-GR, 
GI symptoms were recorded on visual analog scales (VAS) before and at several time points after 
dosing.  GI side effects were also recorded in the 6 patients receiving PAS granules as part of their 
MDR-TB treatment regimen (Peloquin 1994).  In healthy subjects, seven positive responses for AE 
potentially due to PAS-GR at any time point were recorded (3.65% of all VAS). There were two 
reports of mild stomach pain 4 and 12 hours after the dose, respectively; two of mild nausea 1 hour 
after the dose and three of mild to moderate bloating 1 and 12 hours after the dose, respectively, all 
in 4 of the 12 subjects.  In TB patients, 2 of 6 (33%) developed diarrhoea after approximately 3 days 
into treatment which resolved over 3 days. A third of patients reported having soft stools during the 
same time. The drug was continued in all patients (Peloquin 1994).  
Using visual analog scales, GI adverse effects were reported by 12 patients in another study with 
PAS-GR (Peloquin 1999).  Several patients reported mild-severe GI symptoms (Table 6).

PAS-GR was associated with few (11) generally mild or moderate GI adverse effects and no serious 
adverse events were noted. The granule form of PAS was well tolerated with both dosing regimens (4 
g BID or OD).  
In the Peloquin 2001 study, in 16 healthy subjects who received 6 g PAS-GR, the reported AEs 
included: nausea and vomiting, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, headache, diarrhoea, abdominal 
cramps and metallic taste. The details of each respective AE frequencies are however not provided. It 
is only mentioned that, in comparison with the regimen under fasting conditions, food modestly 
decreased the incidences of nausea (p=0.06) and that of vomiting (p=0.1).  
Conclusions on safety  
The active principle of PAS-GR (PAS) has been extensively used from the middle of the last century to 
date and its safety profile is quite well characterized from clinical studies (Table 7). Most frequent AEs 
were related to the gastrointestinal system (26.4%) and are extensively described above as attempts 
to reduce these AEs led to the development of several alternative formulations of PAS. Cutaneous 
hypersensitivity reactions were also frequent (6.3%) as well as AE related to the nervous system 
(6.1%). Hepatic abnormalities were reported with a relatively high incidence (2.1%). A variety of 
other AE have also been reported.

Hypersensitivity to PAS is described after a period of exposure to the drug and a delay of about four 
weeks, in a normally progressively occurring febrile context in a patient previously afebrile (Simpson 
1960). A rash or itching of the skin are frequent accompanying symptoms. When the drug was not 
discontinued hepatic features might have appeared (jaundice, hepatomegaly, and elevated liver 
enzymes). Hepatic complications of PAS were also quite frequently reported in observational studies 
(Rossouw 1975). Though not reported in studies in Table 7, moderate hypothyroidism was a well-
known complication with PAS related to a direct effect on the synthesis of thyroid hormone (with no 
interaction with iodine uptake) as shown in 5 euthyroïd tuberculous patients treated for up to 22 
weeks with 12-15 g/d sodium PAS (Edwards 1954).  
Only a limited proportion of PAS-related AE (7(14%): 5 (10%) GI disturbances, 1 (2%) rash, 1 (2%) 
fever) actually resulted in treatment discontinuation as shown in one retrospective monocentric study 
on 171 MDR-TB pulmonary patients (Goble 1993).  
The specific tolerability of PAS-GR was studied in healthy volunteers (Peloquin 1994, Peloquin 2001) 
and in TB patients under the compassionate use program in France (ATU 1st quarterly report) or in 
clinical studies (Peloquin 1994, Peloquin 1999). The incidence of AE with PAS-GR (Table 8) is 
therefore based on a much more limited database of 110 subjects than that obtained with all other 
formulations of PAS. A total of 37 (33.7%) subjects with AE have been recorded. Digestive AE remain 
the most frequent (23.7%) though with a lower incidence than with previous formulations. A variety 
of other AE have also been reported; their respective incidence is not always available.

In addition despite the limited sample size, under named-patient use (“nominative ATU”) in France, a 
total of 11 children have received PAS-GR since mid-2011 and until today there have been no 
reported AEs.  
These data support the proposition that the enteric-coated, granule form of PAS (PAS-GR), is safe 
and well tolerated compared with the original forms of the free para-aminosalicylic acid or its salts.  
This concurs with the WHO recommendation of the use of the enteric-coated granule forms of PAS, as 
a Group 4 bacteriostatic agent, as they are well tolerated (WHO 2008; 2011). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The only clinical studies that have been conducted with PAS-GR are pharmacokinetic studies provided 
as literature references (Peloquin studies). Demonstration of safety relies solely on literature 
references. PAS was used in the latter part of the last century for the treatment of active tuberculosis 
in combination with other anti-TB medicinal products. It would appear that the use of PAS diminished 
and was discontinued in many European countries due to its significant adverse gastro-intestinal side 
effects of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In line with this, most of the side-effects noted in the 
literature references were mainly gastro-intestinal in origin, although cases of hypersensitivity, 
giddiness/vestibular symptoms, and jaundice were also noted.  
According to the applicant, PAS-GR has been developed to reduce the gastro-intestinal side effects. In 
the Peloquin PK studies, mild to moderate gastro-intestinal side effects were also noted but the 
frequencies of these are unknown.  
In terms of exposure it is unclear how many people were exposed to PAS when it was commonly 
used. According to the applicant a total of 781,359 packs of PAS-GR have been supplied to the US 
and other parts of the world between 1996 and 2010, which means approximately 10,000 patients, 
may have been exposed to it. It is not clear how many patients have been exposed to PAS-GR or any 
other forms of PAS in the EU but the applicant considers that Latvia and Estonia have been part of 
the WHO Green Light Programme since 2000 and therefore may have procured PAS-GR.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing 
have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Para-aminosalicylic acid is known to have severe gastro-intestinal side effects which lead to 
discontinuation of its use in many parts of Europe and PAS-GR appears to also present with gastro-
intestinal side effects but it is unclear how frequent this is. It also potentially interacts with other anti-
tuberculosis drugs but the type and frequency of adverse events as a result of this is not clear.  
Overall, it appears the main problem with PAS is its gastro-intestinal side effects. It is unclear 
however how many patients have been exposed to it in the past 10 years and it is also unclear if PAS 
is used on a routine basis as second line treatment of MDR-TB or XDR-TB.  
In view of the submitted data, the CHMP considers that PAS has an acceptable level of safety in terms 
of the conditions set out in Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 1 of 14 November 2013, the PRAC 
considers by consensus that the risk management system for para-aminosalicylic acid granules (PAS-
GR) in the treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in combination with other medicinal anti-TB 
agents is acceptable. 
Advice on conditions of the marketing authorisation  
The PRAC advises that the following should be conditions of the Marketing Authorisation: 
Assessment report  
EMA/18511/2014

Risk management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
1.  At the request of the European Medicines Agency;  
2.  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. 
If the submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted at the same 
time. 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
The PRAC considers that no additional risk minimisation measures will be necessary for the safe and 
effective use of the medicinal product.

The PRAC agreed. 
-  Pharmacovigilance Plan 
The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that routine pharmacovigilance 
is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product. This will include targeted follow-up 
questionnaire for reports of lack of effect and enhanced follow up of all women of child-bearing age to 
confirm pregnancy and pregnancy outcome. Isolates from cases of treatment failure, which may 
indicate potential resistance, will be investigated for PAS resistance and the mechanisms of 
resistance. 
The PRAC also considered that routine PhV is sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk 
minimisation measures.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
PAS was originally (1946) employed as a first-line anti-TB medicine. It was introduced into anti-TB 
chemotherapy during an era when the benefits of combination drug therapy had been acknowledged 
but the number of medicines available was quite limited. 
It appears that PAS when used in combination with other anti-tuberculosis agents (streptomycin and 
isoniazid), was effective for the treatment of active tuberculosis.

EMA/18511/2014

Beneficial effects 
PAS when given in combination with streptomycin or isoniazid reduced the emergence of resistant 
organisms to both streptomycin and isoniazid. Potentially therefore PAS can make a contribution as 
part of a treatment regimen for MDR-TB or XDR-TB. It can be assumed that if the MIC for 
mycobacterium tuberculosis remains within the normal population distribution then PAS would 
contribute to the overall treatment regimen. 
The World health organisation (WHO), recommends the inclusion of PAS as part of the therapeutic 
options for dealing with MDR-TB. There are also microbiological arguments to support the use of PAS 
in the management of the difficult-to-treat MDR-TB: it has in vitro activity on resistant strains, it does 
not share similar mechanism of action and resistance pattern with other available agents, providing 
rationale for its use as part of multi-therapy for treating MDR-TB. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
PD and efficacy 
There is a lack of clarity regarding the PK/PD relationship of PAS but it is suggested that it is the time 
above MIC that is important for the bacteriostatic activity. PAS-GR should be administered to keep 
inhibitory concentrations above the MIC for most of the dose interval and Cmax should be targeted 
between 20-60µg/ml. With this in mind a posology of 4g, 8 to 12 hourly in adults would be suitable. 
To support this proposal, the applicant provided data from several PK studies (Peloquin 1994, 1999) 
and a more recent South- African Study (Liwa 2012).  Overall, these data suggests that plasma 
concentrations would remain above the MIC for M.tuberculosis using a 4g bid regimen.  A 4 g tid 
regimen, if tolerated, would be even a more secure approach.  It guarantees higher exposure 
because of the higher variability in plasma concentrations observed with the bid regimen and also 
because accumulation of PAS occurs with the thrice daily regimen (median concentrations after one 
week of treatment was 28.5µg/ml) leading to sustained plasma concentrations of PAS. The 4g tid 
regimen is a close approximation of the dose used in the ‘pivotal’ study (BMRC 1950). An in-vitro 
dissolution study is provided in support of the current PAS formulation. In conclusion, the information 
provided is considered sufficient to support the proposed dose regimen in adult. 
With regards to the paediatric population, 150mg/kg daily dose is proposed, based on data from the 
South African study which show that the PK parameter values obtained were not significantly different 
from what was observed in adults. However, no data are available in neonates and this is reflected in 
the SmPC.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
PAS was used in the latter part of the last century for the treatment of active tuberculosis, as part of 
a combination therapy. It would appear that the use of PAS diminished and was discontinued in many 
European countries due to its significant adverse gastro-intestinal side effects of nausea, vomiting 
and diarrhoea. PAS-GR has been developed with aim to reduce the gastro-intestinal side effects. It 
would also appear that cases of hypersensitivity, giddiness/vestibular symptoms, and jaundice have 
also been reported with the use of PAS.  
Assessment report  
EMA/18511/2014 
Page 52/55 
 
 
  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
In terms of exposure it is unclear how many people were exposed to PAS when it was commonly 
used. According to the applicant, a total of 781,359 packs of PAS-GR have been supplied to the US 
and other parts of the world between 1996 and 2010, which means approximately 10,000 patients, 
may have been exposed to it.  From the information provided, PAS was used on a regular basis for 
more than 10 years from the first systematic and documented use in the EU and no safety concerns 
have been reported when PAS is used in combination with other medicinal products in the treatment 
of MDR-TB or XDR-TB, but this cannot be absolutely certain. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
PAS has been shown historically to be beneficial when used as part of a treatment regimen for 
pulmonary tuberculosis. It has also been shown to reduce the emergence of resistant organisms to 
other anti-TB agents when used together.  It was used widely in the past (1950s, 60s and 70s) but 
discontinued due to the significant gastro-intestinal side effects.  
It is considered that PAS can make a contribution as part of a treatment regimen for MDR-TB or XDR-
TB. It can be assumed that if the MIC for mycobacterium tuberculosis remains within the normal 
population distribution then PAS would contribute in the overall treatment regimen.  
Para-aminosalicylic acid Lucane (PAS-GR) has been developed to reduce significant GI side effects 
and therefore could be potentially useful in adequate posology. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Overall, the benefit-risk is considered to be positive as it would appear that PAS is effective in the 
treatment of active tuberculosis and it also appears to reduce the incidence of resistant organisms. It 
is therefore considered that PAS can make a contribution as part of a treatment regimen for MDR-TB 
or XDR-TB with the assumption the MIC for mycobacterium tuberculosis remains within the normal 
population distribution.  Furthermore, PAS has been included in WHO guidelines since 1997 and it is 
still included in the latest guidance for treatment of MDR-TB. 
The CHMP concludes that PAS has been in well-established medicinal use within the Union, with 
recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety in terms of the conditions set out in Annex I of 
Directive 2001/83/EC.   
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
PAS-GR is a gastro-resistant granular form of para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS), intended to treat multi-
drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), which is defined as high-level resistance to both rifampicin and isoniazid 
with or without additional drug resistances and extensively-drug resistant TB (XDR-TB defined as 
MDRTB with resistance to a fluoroquinolone and at least one second line injectable agent).  PAS-GR is 
to be used in combination with other agents to which the bacterial organism is sensitive.   
For both MDR-TB and XDR-TB, it can be difficult to put together an adequate treatment regimen due 
to resistant organisms. Therefore it is considered that PAS-GR have a place in the treatment of MDR-
TB/XDR-TB if an adequate dose is used, as it has been shown that PAS is effective in the treatment of

TB when used in combination with other anti-TB agents and also shown to reduce emergence of 
resistant strains.

Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Para-aminosalicylic acid Lucane in the treatment of tuberculosis 
“for use as part of an appropriate combination regimen for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in adults 
and paediatric patients from 28 days of age and older when an effective treatment regimen cannot 
otherwise be composed for reasons of resistance or tolerability (see section 4.4). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents”.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder of transformed, hematopoietic 
progenitor cells characterized by overproduction of immature myeloid cells and mature granulocytes in 
the spleen, bone marrow, and peripheral blood. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 9/128 
 
 
 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
CML mainly affects adult patients with an average age at diagnosis of 65 years. Approximately 8,450 
new cases of CML could be diagnosed and about 1,130 people could die of the malignancy in the US 
during 2020 (Howlader et al 2020). In Europe, a similar incidence of CML has been reported with 10 to 
15 cases/million/year, without any major geographic or ethnic differences (Hochhaus et al 2017).  
2.1.3.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The  hallmark  of  CML  is  the  Philadelphia  (Ph)  chromosome  found  in  up  to  95%  of  patients.  The  Ph 
chromosome  results  from  a  reciprocal  translocation  t(9;22)(q34;q11)  which  fuses  a  portion  of  the 
Abelson (ABL1) gene on chromosome 9 with a portion of the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene on 
chromosome 22.  
The  resulting  fusion  gene  encodes  a  chimeric  protein  (BCR-ABL1),  resulting  in  a  constitutively  active 
tyrosine  kinase  domain.  This  oncoprotein  promotes  cell  growth  and  replication  through  downstream 
signaling pathways such as RAS, RAF, JUN kinase, MYC, and STAT (Jabbour and Kantarjian 2018). 
Treatment with TKIs, inhibiting theses consequences of the mutation and re-establishing a 
constitutively active tyrosine kinase domain has dramatically improved the prognosis in CML associated 
with a nearly normal life-expectance in affected patients. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The natural history of CML is characterized by a triphasic course. In most of the patients, the disease is 
diagnosed  in  the  chronic  phase  (CP),  which  is  characterized  by  overproduction  and  accumulation  of 
immature myelogenous cells and mature granulocytes in the spleen, bone marrow, and peripheral blood. 
If CML-CP remains untreated, or it is not controlled with available therapies, patients will progress to an 
intermediate phase known as accelerated phase (AP), marked by the presence of primitive blast cells in 
the bone marrow and peripheral blood.  
Most  patients  with  CML-AP  eventually  progress  to  a  blastic  phase  (BP),  a  condition  resembling  acute 
leukemia in which myeloid or lymphoid blasts proliferate in an uncontrolled manner (Apperley 2015). 
Based on the experience with TKIs, the best approach to avoid advanced CML (CML-AP/-BP) is preventing 
progression and keeping patients in the well-controlled chronic phase. 
The prognosis of CML has changed during the past two decades from a disease with an overall survival 
of only 5-7 years to one in which patients responding to TKI treatment can expect a near to normal life 
expectancy (Apperley 2015). However, some patients do not respond to the treatment (primary 
resistance), lose their response (secondary resistance), or experience tolerability issues. Also, the 
detection of BCR-ABL1 mutations in CML-CP, in particular T315I mutation, are associated with a 
greater likelihood of resistance to TKI treatment and consequent disease progression (Soverini et al 
2005). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Since the approval of imatinib in 2001, the 10 year survival rates for patients with CML have improved 
from  approximately  20%  to  around  80-90%,  and  targeted  therapy  with  TKIs  has  become  the  gold 
standard of treatment (Jabbour and Kantarjian 2018). There are four TKIs approved for the treatment 
of newly diagnosed CML (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib), with imatinib being the most commonly 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 10/128 
 
 
 
used  in  clinical  practice  in  CML-CP  patients  (Apperley  2015,  Banegas  et  al  2019,  and  Hochhaus  et  al 
2020). 
For patients with CML-CP who experience treatment failure (intolerance or resistance) to previous TKI 
therapy, the therapeutic options are limited. Treatment selection is further complicated by consideration 
of the patients’ comorbidities, age, emergence of mutations, and the safety profile of each particular TKI 
(Hochhaus et al 2017, Hochhaus et al 2020, NCCN 2020). 
After treatment failure on a 2G-TKI, ponatinib, a 3G-TKI, is an option. However, clinical guidelines do 
not  recommend  its  use  in  patients  with  existing  cardiovascular  risk  factors  because  cardiovascular 
toxicity can occur in about 30% of patients (Cortes et al 2018, Hochhaus et al 2020, NCCN 2020). 
Despite  available  therapies  for  CML  have  greatly  broadened  treatment  choices  and  improved  patient 
outcomes,  there  remain  challenges  in  the  management  of  CML.  The  choice  and  sequencing  of  TKIs 
remains  controversial  with  the  complexity  of  safety and  tolerability  considerations  in  the  context  of  a 
long-term therapy  (Mauro  et  al  2013,  Cortes  and  Kantarjian  2016).  Especially  patients  treated  in  the 
third and further lines of therapy represent a population with a high unmet need requiring therapies with 
potent anti-leukemic activity to control the disease and with a well-tolerated safety profile. 
The  current  European  Treatment  guidelines  (Hochhaus  et  al,  2020)  summarises  the  current  situation 
and concludes for the treatment beyond the second line:  
“The definition of an acceptable response to third, fourth or fifth line treatment cannot be formalised, 
but  a  BCR-ABL1  transcript  level  >1%  or  a  cytogenetic  response  less  than  complete  (Ph+  >0%)  are 
insufficient for optimal survival. There are no comparative studies and the choice of TKI should be guided 
by the sensitivity profile of specific BCR-ABL1 KD-mutations if possible, and, in particular T315I where 
only  ponatinib  is  efficacious.  Suboptimal  responses  to  two  or  more  TKIs  should  lead  to  prompt 
consideration of an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT).” 
Insofar, an efficacious inhibitor that targets the myristoyl pocket of BCR-ABL1, in contrast to the currently 
available TKIs that target the BCR-ABL1 ATP binding site and does not interact with the ATP-binding site 
may be beneficial. It offers the chance for activity against cells expressing clinically observed ATP-binding 
TKI resistant mutations. However, whether inhibition of the new binding site is also associated with an 
improved safety and tolerability when administered as monotherapy compared to TKIs binding to the 
ATP-binding  site  of  BCR-ABL1  remains  open,  since  inhibition  of  a  new  binding  site  may  also  lead  to 
different toxicities in humans.  
Asciminib  in  principle  may  thereby  fulfil  a  medical  need  in  the  treatment  of  CML,  particularly  in  the 
situation of post 2G-TKI treatment failure as currently applied. 
Currently  authorized  TKIs  for  Ph+  CML  patients  with  resistance  or  intolerance  to  prior  therapy,  with

2.2.  About the product 
Asciminib (ABL001), administered orally, is a potent inhibitor of ABL/BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase. BCR-
ABL1  is  a  chimeric  oncoprotein  with  the  constitutively  active  ABL1  tyrosine  kinase  domain.  Asciminib 
inhibits  the  ABL1  kinase  activity  of  the  BCR-ABL1  fusion  protein,  by  specifically  targeting  the  ABL 
myristoyl pocket. 
Figure 1: Structural formula: 
At the time of application, asciminib had not yet been approved anywhere in the world and applied for 
approval  of  the  indication “treatment  of  adult  patients  with  Philadelphia-chromosome-positive  chronic 
myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML) in chronic phase (CP) previously treated with two or more tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors”. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 13/128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The recommended total daily dose of asciminib for adult patients with Ph+ CML-CP previously treated 
with 2 or more tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is 80 mg to be taken orally as 40 mg twice daily (b.i.d.). 
Mode of action: 
Asciminib  (ABL001)  is  an  inhibitor  that  targets  the  myristoyl  pocket  of  BCR-ABL1,  in  contrast  to  the 
currently available TKIs that target the BCR-ABL1 ATP binding site. By virtue of asciminib not interacting 
with the ATP-binding site, asciminib maintains activity against cells expressing clinically observed ATP-
binding TKI resistant mutations. Additionally, due to asciminib specifically targeting the ABL kinase family 
(ABL1,  ABL2,  BCR-ABL1),  asciminib  offers  the  potential  for  improved  safety  and  tolerability  when 
administered as monotherapy when compared to TKIs binding to the ATP-binding site of BCR-ABL1. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
Asciminib as a single agent or in combination with other TKIs has been assessed in CML patients in third-
line and beyond (3L+), in T315I mutation positive CML, in Ph+ ALL and as add-on to frontline imatinib 
treatment in patients not achieving deep molecular response. 
In  this  application,  data  from  an  ongoing  Phase  III  study  [Study  ABL001A2301  Primary  endpoint 
analysis]  (hereafter  referred  to  as  Study  A2301)  and  ongoing  Phase  I  study  [Study  ABL001X2101 
Primary  analysis]  (hereafter  referred  to  as  Study  X2101)  provide  robust  evidence  to  support  the 
proposed indication in Ph+ CML-CP. 
Study  CABL001A2301  is  a  Phase  III,  multi-center,  open  label,  randomized  study  of  asciminib  40  mg 
b.i.d. versus bosutinib 500 mg q.d. in patients with CML-CP, previously treated with two or more TKIs. 
Study CABL001X2101 is a first in human (FIH) dose escalation Phase I, multi-center, open-label study 
of asciminib in patients with Ph+ CML or Ph+ ALL. Overview of these studies is provided Table 12. 
The efficacy claims for asciminib in third line and beyond (3L+) for patients with Ph+ CML CP who are 
resistant and/or intolerant to treatment with at least 2 prior TKIs are based primarily on the results from 
the primary analysis of the registration Study A2301. Supportive evidence of efficacy of asciminib as a 
single-agent  in  3L+  Ph+  CML-CP  is  provided  by  data  from  the  subset  of  patients  with  CML-CP  not 
harboring the T315I mutation from the Study X2101. 
The safety profile of asciminib in patients with Ph+ CML-CP previously treated with two or more TKIs is 
primarily  based  upon  the  results  of  study  A2301,  with  supportive  evidence  from  Study  X2101.  It  is 
further supported by analyses in safety pools comprising of data from Study A2301 and Study X2101 
(all CML-CP/-AP patients treated with asciminib monotherapy regardless of T315I mutation). 
Exposure  to  treatment  with  asciminib  in  Study  A2301  is  currently  limited  and  the  overall  size  of  the 
exposed population seems limited to about 356 patients and about 48 weeks (median; additional data 
cut off: 6.01.2021). Updated data including longer follow-up data from week 96 (cut-off date of 06-Oct-
2021), were submitted after the initial submission during the procedure.  
The applicant has discussed the development plan of asciminib and proposed package to support the 
marketing authorisation application (MAA) with the EMA in a scientific advice meeting on 30-Nov-2016. 
In general, it seems that CHMP’s guidance as given in previous scientific advice was adequately 
followed. In addition, a pre-submission meeting with the CHMP Rapporteur, the Co-Rapporteur on 04th 
of November 2020 (and with EMA on 04 of December 2020). These meetings were held to clarify the 
overall strategy for the planned MAA for asciminib in order to align on the overall content and format 
of the planned MAA in support of the proposed indication and procedural and regulatory aspects for the 
MAA for asciminib.

2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General Information 
The chemical name of asciminib is N-[4-(chlorodifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-6-[(3R)-3-hydroxypyrrolidin-1-
yl]-5-(1H-pyrazol-3-yl)  pyridine-3-carboxamide  hydrochloride  corresponding  to  the  molecular  formula 
C20H18ClF2N5O3.HCl.  It  has  a  relative  molecular  mass  of  486.30  g/mol  (salt  form)  and  the  following 
structure: 
Figure 2 active substance structure: 
The active substance is a white to slightly yellow powder. It is slightly soluble in water, absolute ethanol 
and isopropanol, soluble in methanol, but practically insoluble in acetone. 
The chemical structure of asciminib was confirmed by a combination of elemental analysis, HR-MS, UV-
spectroscopy, IR-spectroscopy, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and 19F-NMR.  
The active substance exhibits stereoisomerism (one stereocentre). The R-form is manufactured, the S-
form is routinely controlled as an impurity.  
The  solid-state  properties  of  the  active  substance  were  measured  by  XRPD  and  DSC.  The  active 
substance exhibits polymorphism. Two anhydrous crystalline modifications A and B have been identified. 
A third form, modification C,  was observed as a physical mixture but could not be isolated as a pure 
Assessment report

form. Modification A is routinely manufactured and is stable. Polymorphic identity is routinely controlled 
by means of XRPD testing (release and stability testing). 
Active substance solubility is relevant for finished product performance (i.e. in-vitro drug release). The 
provided solubility data indicate poor solubility of the active substance in aqueous media, especially if 
the pH is above 3. However, the active substance is able to form super saturated solutions at pH 4.5 and 
6.8.    
Active  substance  particle  size  is  relevant  for  finished  product  manufacturability  and  finished  product 
performance. The active substance particle size is routinely controlled. The limits are justified based on 
developmental studies and particle size results used for the manufacture of clinical batches of finished 
product. 
It has been established that the active substance is not hygroscopic as less than 0.05% water uptake 
was measured after 1 day exposure at 92% relative humidity at 25 °C. 
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Asciminib hydrochloride is synthesized in a convergent synthesis, with three chemical transformations 
in the two side chains and four chemical transformations in the main chain, followed by hydrochloride 
salt  formation  and  milling.  The  synthesis  starts  from  well-defined  starting  materials  with  acceptable 
specifications.  
A reaction scheme including all starting materials, reagents, catalysts, solvents, intermediates and the 
active substance is provided. A detailed narrative description is given for each step. Input quantities, 
yields, process parameters and IPCs are stated.  
The selection of starting materials is based on general principles outlined in the ICH Q11. Each starting 
material has defined structure and chemical properties. The manufacturing process of each material and 
impurity  profile  is  known.  Carry-over  of  impurities  is  discussed.  Scientific  advice  was  given  by  CHMP 
regarding  acceptability  of  starting  materials  (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/642260/2017)  and  the  Applicant  has 
followed the recommendations of the CHMP.  
No reprocessing is proposed and only fresh solvents are used during the process. Critical process steps 
are  indicated  and  their  control  is  described.  Control  of  intermediates  is  explained.  Specifications  are 
presented for each isolated intermediate. 
The active substance is non-sterile. Accordingly, no process validation and/or evaluation data were 
submitted in the course of the MA application. 
Information  on  manufacturing  process  development  is  provided  including  involved  manufacturers, 
applied synthetic processes and scale up. Late phase toxicological and clinical batches (including primary 
stability  batches)  were  manufactured  according  to  an  earlier  synthetic  process  which  is  considered 
representative to the commercial process. Release data presented demonstrate similar quality between 
the respective batches and the commercial batches. Clinical batches and primary stability batches are 
thus representative of active substance generated by the commercial process at the commercial site. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised.  
A  comprehensive  discussion  on  actual  and  potential  impurities  (including  mutagenic  impurities)  of 
starting  materials,  isolated  intermediates  and  final  DS  is  provided  (including,  reagents,  solvents, 
catalysts, by-products and degradations products). Mutagenicity assessment has been performed in line

with ICH M7 assuming a maximum daily dose of 0.5 g/d. Impurities (including mutagenic impurities) are 
either controlled as specified or unspecified impurities in starting materials, intermediates and final the 
final  active  substance  or  appropriate  purge/control  was  shown  by  means  of  purge  factor  calculation, 
spike  and  purge  studies,  otherwise  demonstrated  process  understanding  (e.g.  investigation  of  the 
likelihood of formation of impurities under worst-case conditions) or analytical data for 6 representative 
batches. The finished product is intended for an advanced cancer indication as defined in the scope of 
ICH S9 and therefore, mutagenic impurities can be controlled according to ICH Q3A.  
The active substance is packaged in a PE bags, placed in quadruple laminated foil bags (PE, PET, AL, 
PET). Bags are sealed and may be stored in drums. The primary packaging material (PE bag) complies 
with  relevant  Ph.  Eur.  and  foodstuff  legislation  requirements.  Packaging  materials  are  appropriately 
controlled. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, and 
container closure 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for:  appearance  (visual),  particle  size  (laser  light 
diffraction), identity (IR, XRPD), enantiomer (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), 
sulphated  ash  (Ph.  Eur.),  heavy  metals  (ICP-OES,  ICP-MS),  related  substances  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC) 
and microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.). 
Relevant parameters are included in line with ICH Q6A and Ph. Eur. 2034 (‘Substances for pharmaceutical 
use’) and the specified limits are appropriately justified.  
Related  substances  (including  enantiomer)  are  controlled  in  line  with  ICH  Q3A  and  Ph.  Eur.  2034 
identification-  (NMT  0.10%  for  unspecified  impurities)  and  qualification  (NMT  0.15%  for  specified 
impurities and enantiomer) thresholds.  
Residual solvents, including benzene (potentially present as an impurity in other solvents), are controlled 
according to ICH Q3C option 1 limits.  
Palladium, used as catalyst for active substance synthesis, is specified in line with the respective ICH 
Q3D option 1 limit (oral administration).   
Skip testing of microbiological quality is proposed by the Applicant. This is acceptable as batch data from 
more than 20 batches is submitted and active substance is used in the manufacturing of a non-sterile 
solid dosage form.   
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods 
appropriately  validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch  data  is  presented  for  early  to  late  phase  toxicological  and  clinical  batches  (including  primary 
stability batches) as well as commercial batches. Reported batch data demonstrate the similar quality of 
late phase clinical batches (including primary stability batches) and commercial batches (irrespective of 
manufacturer  or  synthetic  process).  Overall,  clinical  batches  and  primary  stability  batches  are 
representative for commercial active substance. Commercial batches comply with the active substance 
specification.

2.4.2.4.  Stability 
Stability data from three pilot scale batches of active substance, stored in a container closure system 
representative of that intended for the market, for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25°C / 
60%  RH)  and  intermediate  conditions  (30°C  /  75%  RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated 
conditions (40°C / 75% RH), according to the ICH guidelines, were provided.  
All relevant parameters of the active substance specification were tested: appearance, identity by IR and 
XRPD,  related  substances  by  HPLC,  enantiomer  by  HPLC,  loss  on  drying,  assay  and  microbial 
enumeration test. Residual solvents (including benzene), Pd content, assay of salt-forming agent and 
particle size have not been tested. This is acceptable as these parameters are not stability indicating.  
Neither significant changes nor any trends were observed.  
Batches manufactured by the commercial manufacturer have also been placed on stability. Results for 
commercial stability batches are presented for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% 
RH) and 9 months under long-term conditions (30°C / 75% RH). Neither significant changes nor any 
trends were observed. The active substance remains stable over the investigated period irrespective of 
the container closure system.  
Stress studies (including photostability) demonstrate that active substance in solid state remains stable 
under any tested condition. Photostability has been tested in line with ICH Q1B.  
Stress  studies  for  active  in  solution  indicate that  specified impurities  could  potentially  be  formed,  but 
would  be  detected  by  the  related  substances  method  (appropriate  mass  balance  and  peak  purity  is 
demonstrated). Stability indicating properties of the HPLC methods used for determination of assay and 
related substances are demonstrated by forced degradation studies. Asciminib hydrochloride was found 
to be stable in the solid state, but sensitive to acidic, alkaline and oxidative conditions and in solution. 
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Asciminib  20  mg  and  40  mg  film-coated  tablets  are  an  immediate  release  dosage  form  for  oral 
administration packaged in blisters. The two strengths (20 mg and 40 mg), which are dose proportional, 
are sufficiently differentiated by colour, size and debossing. The quantitative and qualitative composition 
is presented in the dossier. 
Excipients  used  in  the  drug  product  formulation  are:  lactose  monohydrate,  microcrystalline  cellulose, 
hydroxypropyl  cellulose,  croscarmellose  sodium,  magnesium  stearate,  colloidal  silicon  dioxide  and 
different coating premixes for each strength. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC 
and in paragraph 2.4.1 of this report. The choice and amount of the excipients are based on compatibility 
studies as well as on pharmaceutical experience gained from the development of asciminib film-coated 
tablets and similar products. A discussion of each excipient and how it was chosen has been presented. 
Information on compatibility studies is provided. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients 
and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished 
product formulation.

(which  has  been  sufficiently  justified).  Physicochemical  and  biological  properties  are  sufficiently 
discussed.  
Asciminib hydrochloride is classified as a BCS class II compound with high permeability and strongly pH-
dependent solubility. High saturated solubility is observed at acidic pH 1 and a decrease in solubility is 
observed  with  increasing  pH  (above  pH  2).  Asciminib  hydrochloride  is  described  as  irregular  particles 
and to ensure reproducibility during manufacturing, a milling step is performed by the active substance 
manufacturer to ensure a consistent particle size.  
The active substance particle size limits have been set in the active substance specification.  
Due to poor blend flow properties and low bulk and tapped density during the direct compression process, 
it  was  decided  to  develop  a  formulation  and process  using  dry  granulation  via  roller  compaction.  The 
material generated by roller compaction showed good processability and satisfactory in vitro dissolution 
results. Consistency of polymorphic form during manufacturing and shelf-life of drug product has been 
assessed using X–ray powder diffraction method. It can be concluded that no conversion of asciminib 
polymorphic form A occurs during finished product manufacture or shelf life.  
A  design  of  experiments  (DoE)  study  was  performed  to  optimize  the  formulation  and  select  a  final 
formulation  for  pivotal  clinical  trials.  This  study  was  done  by  altering  the  ratio  of  granules  to  extra-
granular  excipients  in  the  formulation,  selected  excipient  levels  and  drug  substance  particle  size 
distribution  (PSD).  The  final  formulation  was  used  throughout  the  pivotal  clinical  studies  and  in 
registration stability studies. 
During development, the proposed dissolution method for the finished product has been optimized for 
the following parameters: choice of dissolution apparatus, medium volume and pH, temperature, and 
rotation  speed.  The  dissolution  temperature  and  volume  selected  are  in  line  with  Ph.  Eur. 
recommendations and the EU bioequivalence guideline CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98, therefore no further 
justification is required. Selection of the rotation speed, dissolution medium and apparatus is justified 
by extensive development based on active substance and drug product characteristics and solubility data 
across solutions of different pH (1.2-pH 6.8). The selection of the dissolution medium for routine control 
is considered sufficiently justified by data presented.  
The  applicant  explains  that  presence  of  asciminib  free  base  is  the  most  critical  attribute  impacting 
performance  of  the  asciminib tablets.  The  dissolution  method  was  developed to discriminate  between 
batches containing a certain amount of free base of the active substance content. A correlation between 
the dissolution results and XRPD testing for formation of free base is described. The results justify the 
finished product acceptance criteria for routine dissolution testing - Q≥80% after 20 minutes according 
to Acceptance table 1 of harmonized EP, USP and JP (release: levels 1 and 2 only and shelf-life: levels 
1,  2  and  3).  This  correlation  is  considered  sufficient  evidence  for  the  discriminatory  power  of  the 
dissolution method, while the method was found not to be discriminatory in terms of critical material 
attributes and critical manufacturing parameters within the ranges tested. The discriminatory power is 
considered  adequately  demonstrated.  Information  regarding  bioavailability  studies  performed  is 
sufficiently presented. 
The  process  development  consisted  of  a  systematic  approach  based  on  scientific  investigations  and 
iterative risk management across production scales. Pivotal clinical batches and drug product registration 
stability  batches  were  manufactured  at  pilot  scale  at  Novartis  Pharma  AG,  Basel,  Switzerland.  The 
manufacturing  process  was  then  transferred  to  Novartis  Pharma  Stein  AG,  which  is  the  proposed 
commercial manufacturing site.

The  primary  packaging  is  PCTFE/PVC/Alu  blisters.  The  materials  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC 
requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  six  main  steps:  pre-blending,  dry  granulation,  screening,  final 
blending, tableting and film-coating. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
A narrative process description and process-flow charts are provided for each step of the finished product 
manufacturing process. The manufacturing process involves preparation of the inner phase (granules) 
which  are  further  blended  with  outer  phase  (extra-granular)  excipients  to  form  a  final  blend  which  is 
then compressed into tablets followed by film-coating.  
The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
A hold time of 12 months for bulk film-coated tablets packed in low density polyethylene (LDPE) bag, 
closed and placed in a triple foil (PETP/Al/PE) bag with silica gel desiccant is accepted. The start of the 
shelf-life  is  calculated  according  to  the  requirements  of  the  guideline  CPMP/QWP/072/96:  Note  for 
Guidance on Start of Shelf-life of the Finished Product Dosage Form”.   
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. Production scale batches of asciminib 20 mg (3 batches) and 40 mg 
(3  batches)  film-coated  tablets  have  been  used  for  manufacturing  process  validation  batches  at  the 
proposed commercial manufacturing site Novartis Pharma Stein AG, Switzerland. Validation batch data 
are  presented  for  final  blend,  compression  and  film-coating  steps  and  show  that  the  manufacturing 
process,  operated  within  the  evaluated  parameter  ranges,  can  perform  effectively  and  reproducibly 
produce a medicinal product compliant with specifications.  
2.4.3.3.  Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The finished product specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form; appearance 
(visual, size), mean mass, identity (NIRS, UV, HPLC), assay (NIRS, HPLC), degradation products (RTR / 
HPLC), water content (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (NIRS / Ph. Eur.) and 
microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.). 
Parameters included in specification comply with requirements of ICH Q6A and Ph. Eur. for this dosage 
form.  Justification  is  provided  for  all  tests  that  have  been  included  in  the  specification.  Potential 
degradation products have been discussed. Appropriate acceptance criteria have been defined. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Real  time  release  (RTRT)  parameters  are  Identity,  Assay,  and  uniformity  of  dosage  units  by  content 
uniformity (all by NIRS). The NIRS method will be the primary test method for batch release dependent 
on a successful parallel testing phase. During the parallel testing phase, 15 batches per dosage strength 
will be tested both by NIRS and the alternative HPLC method. The NIR methods for identification, assay 
and content uniformity in general have been developed and validated in accordance with the Guideline 
on the use of near infrared spectroscopy by the pharmaceutical industry and the data requirements for 
new  submissions  and  variations  (EMEA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/17760/2009)  and  are  considered  as 
acceptable. The switch from parallel testing to RTRT based on NIRS is documented in a post-approval 
Assessment report

change  management  protocol  (PACMP)  which  describes  the  studies  to  be  performed  and  suitable 
acceptance  criteria.  The  PACMP  is  considered  acceptable  and  the  changes  can  be  made  by  type  IA 
variation following successful implementation of RTRT by NIRS. 
Stability  indicating  properties  of  the  HPLC  methods  used  for  determination  of  assay  and  related 
substances  are  demonstrated  by  forced  degradation  studies.  The  microbial  enumeration  test  method 
validation report is provided and is considered acceptable.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a risk-
based  approach  in  line  with  the  ICH  Q3D  Guideline  for  Elemental  Impurities.  Based  on  the  risk 
assessment and the presented batch data, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any 
elemental impurity controls. 
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has  been  performed  considering  all  suspected  and  actual  root  causes  in  line  with  the  “Questions  and 
answers  for  marketing  authorisation  holders/applicants  on  the  CHMP  Opinion  for  the  Article  5(3)  of 
Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  referral  on  nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicinal  products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004-  Nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicinal  products”  (EMA/369136/2020).  Based  on  the 
information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance 
or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed necessary. 
Batch analysis data (3 batches each) for representative clinical, stability and production scale batches of 
Asciminib 20 mg and 40 mg film-coated tablets are presented. All results comply with the specifications.  
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  three  pilot  scale  batches  of  each  strength  of  finished  product  stored  for  up  to  24 
months under long term conditions (25°C / 60% RH), 12 months under intermediate conditions (30°C / 
75% RH) and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  medicinal  product  are  representative  to  those  proposed  for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
All stability data, except of 12 months stability data at 30 °C/75% RH and 6 months stability data at 
40°C/75% RH comply to the specifications. After 6 months under accelerated conditions and 12 months 
under intermediate conditions, a degree of disproportionation of the salt form to free base was observed. 
Under  accelerated  conditions,  water  content  also  increased  without  an  impact  on  other  measured 
parameters. No significant change or trends were observed under long term conditions.  
Additional stability studies, such as, freeze and thaw cycle test, photostability and open dish study 
have been performed. Photostability testing in line with ICH Q1B indicates that the finished product is 
not sensitive to light. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months and storage conditions (“Do not 
store above 25°C” and “Store in the original package in order to protect from moisture”) as stated in the 
SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable. 
2.4.3.5.  Post approval change management protocol(s)  
A post approval change management protocol (PACMP) to switch from parallel testing to RTRT based on 
NIRS is provided and is acceptable (see above under product specification).

2.4.3.6.  Adventitious agents 
Lactose monohydrate is the only excipient of animal origin. It is confirmed that the lactose is produced 
from  milk  from  healthy  animals  in  the  same  condition  as  those  used  to  collect  milk  for  human 
consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of ruminant material other than 
calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform 
Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. There were no major objections raised on the submitted dossier 
and all other concerns raised have been satisfactorily resolved. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical program has been designed in accordance with the ICH S9, a guideline for non-clinical 
evaluation of anticancer pharmaceuticals. The pivotal toxicology and toxicokinetic studies submitted to 
support this application were conducted in rats, dogs and monkeys in compliance with GLP regulations. 
The  dose-range  finding  studies  do  not  claim  GLP  compliance.  Asciminib  salt  was  used  for  the  GLP 
toxicology studies in rats (26-week) and monkeys and as solid dispersion in the 4-week rat and the dog 
study. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
A series of studies with ABL1 constructs featuring the myristoyl binding site of the ABL1 kinase domain 
revealed that asciminib binds to ABL1 with a KD of 0.5 nM. In biochemical assays, asciminib inhibited 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 22/128 
 
 
 
 
 
ABL1 kinase activity with IC50 values of 2.6 ± 0.8 nM (radiometric filter-binding assay) and 0.5 ± 0.1 nM 
(caliper assay). 
In isothermal titration calorimetry experiments, the binding constant of asciminib to the wild-type 
ABL146-534 protein was 0.32 and 0.9 nM (two experiments) and therefore similar to that of the T315I 
mutant (KD values 0.5 and 0.8 nM). Inhibition of cell proliferation for engineered Ba/F3 cells dependent 
upon the T315I mutated BCR-ABL1 was characterised by the mean IC50 value of 7.64 ± 3.22 nM. In 
contrast, the mean IC50 value for Ba/F3 cells dependent on wild-type BCR-ABL1 was with 0.61 ± 0.21 
nM much lower. The IC50 values are mentioned in the SmPC. 
Experiments  on  large  tumour  cell  line  panels  revealed  high  selectivity  of  asciminib  for  BCR-ABL1 
expressing cells (inhibition of cell proliferation at low nanomolar concentrations whereas IC50 in other 
cell lines lay in micromolar range). 
Asciminib inhibited the proliferation of Ba/F3 cells overexpressing wild-type BCR-ABL1 in the absence of 
IL3 with IC50 of 0.25 nM. Also in Ba/F3cells transfected with ABL1 constructs containing clinically relevant 
mutations (T315I, E255K, E255V, Y253H, F359V, Q252H, G250H and E459K), asciminib remained potent 
with IC50 values ranging between 0.1 and 1 nM. 
The Applicant submitted four in vivo studies shown in the Tabulated Summaries (Table below):  
Table 2  
Pharmacology Tabulated Summaries 
Two primary metabolites of asciminib, the oxidation product and the pyrrolidine cleavage product, were 
found  to  be  less  potent  in  inhibition  of  ABL  enzymatic  activity  (with  ca.  10-fold  higher  IC50  values  in 
caliper assay) and in inhibition of cell proliferation in Ba/F3 cell line overexpressing BCR-ABL1 (with >6-
fold higher IC50 values). Taking into account the low levels of these metabolites in plasma of patients, 
their contribution to the pharmacological activity is expected to be minimal. 
The in vivo efficacy of asciminib was evaluated in mice bearing KCL-22 xenografts, animal model of CML. 
Plasma exposure after single oral administration of asciminib increased dose-proportionally between 3 
and 15 mg/kg, and appeared super-proportional at doses of 30 mg/kg and higher. Treatment with 3, 
7.5, 15 and 30 mg/kg led to dose-proportional maximal inhibition of pSTAT5, a downstream signalling 
effector of BCR-ABL1, to 62%, 98%, 99% and 99%, respectively. At the 30 mg/kg dose level, greater 
than 80% inhibition of pSTAT5 was maintained for 16 hours after treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022

In KCL-22 xenograft models, twice-daily administration of 7.5 mg/kg or higher doses induced significant 
tumour regression of more than 50%. The extent of regression increased with dose. The efficacy of once-
daily treatment with 30 mg/kg asciminib resulted in 63% tumour regression and was thus comparable 
to that after twice-daily treatment with 15 mg/kg. Asciminib retained its efficacy in the nilotinib-resistant 
KCL-22R CML xenograft mouse model harbouring a T315I mutation, where twice-daily administration of 
30 mg/kg led to 56% of tumour regression. 
In  disseminated  Philadelphia  chromosome-positive  acute  lymphoblastic  leukaemia  patient-derived 
xenografts, complete suppression of tumour burden was observed at 7.5 and 30 mg/kg BID.  
Asciminib delayed the emergence of resistance compared to nilotinib. Animals receiving asciminib at 15 
mg/kg BID or 30 mg/kg QD relapsed with a median time to endpoint of more than 40 days, whereas 
after nilotinib administration resistance development manifested earlier than 40 days post-treatment. At 
higher asciminib doses, emergence of resistance was further significantly delayed with median tumour 
relapse of more than 60 days. 
Combination of asciminib with nilotinib appeared to be more effective than either drug alone. Asciminib 
at 30 mg/kg BID given together with nilotinib at 75 mg/kg BID induced 99% tumour regression, while 
lower extent of tumour growth inhibition was observed with either drug alone, although the difference 
was not statistically significant.  
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro kinase profiling over 335 protein and 14 lipid kinases showed no substantial activity on these 
targets at the concentration of 10 μM. 
An off-target screening on a large panel of receptors, enzymes and transporters revealed a greater 
than 50% inhibition at 10 μM in the lipoxygenase 5-LO assay (IC50 = 3.3 μM), the vesicular 
monoamine transporter VMAT2 functional assay (IC50 = 3.5 μM), and for the serotonin 5HT2B receptor 
in antagonist mode (IC50 = 5.1 μM). At higher concentration, activity was noted on the adenosine Ad3 
receptor (IC50 = 21 μM), 5HT2A as antagonism (IC50 = 18 μM) and norepinephrine transporter NET 
(IC50 = 22 μM). In patients receiving 40 mg BID, the geometric mean total plasma Cmax was 1.8 μM 
corresponding to the free plasma Cmax of 0.048 μM asciminib. In the case of 80 mg QD dosing 
schedule, mean free plasma Cmax was 0.1 μM. Even for the latter dosing, the safety margin is higher 
than 30, therefore, off-target related adverse reactions from interactions on lipoxygenase, vesicular 
monoamine transporter and the serotonin 5HT2B receptor are unlikely clinically relevant, especially 
given low brain penetration. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Asciminib inhibited hERG potassium current with IC50 value of 11.4 μM. Asciminib inhibited the Nav1.5 
channel with a measured IC50 of 29.7 μM and at the highest test concentration of 30 μM reduced the 
Cav1.2  current  by  11%  and  the  IKs  current  by  5.2%.  This  is  far  above  the  free  maximal  plasma 
concentration in patients.  
Asciminib  oral  administration  to  male  Beagle  dogs  up  to  60  mg/kg  did  not  affect  diastolic  arterial 
pressure. Treatment with 60 mg/kg asciminib resulted in increased heart rate (+44%) and decreased 
mean arterial pressure (-15%), which were reversible within 17 hours after dosing. On the contrary, a 
decrease in systolic pressure (-13%) and in arterial pulse pressure (-15%) were not reversible up to 24 
hours after treatment with 60 mg/kg. A shortened QT interval at 60 mg/kg through 13 hours post-dose 
appears to be a consequence of concurrently increased heart rate.

In toxicology studies in rats, no effects of asciminib on central nervous and respiratory system were 
observed up to 600 mg/kg/day (see toxicology section). 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been performed. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The absorption of asciminib was investigated after single-dose administration in Sprague-Dawley and 
Hanover Wistar rats, C57BL/6 mice, cynomolgus monkeys (intravenous and oral route), and in Beagle 
dogs (oral route).  
For this purpose, the analytical LC-MS/MS methods for quantitative determination of asciminib in rat, 
mouse, dog, rabbit and monkey plasma as well as the method for measuring drug concentrations in rat 
plasma by means of HPLC with MS/MS detection were developed and in general successfully validated. 
Most validation criteria were met in all matrices. The carryover effect (asciminib response in the blank 
samples injected immediately after the ULOQ samples was more than 20% of the mean response at the 
LLOQ level) observed in all but rabbit plasma.  
After intravenous administration of asciminib, plasma clearance was low to moderate as compared to 
hepatic blood flow and the half-life of the drug was short to moderate (1.1 – 3.7 h), in contrast to human 
(7 – 14 h). The volume of distribution was low to moderate across species, i.e. about 0.7- to 3-fold the 
body water. Following oral dosing, asciminib was moderately absorbed in most animals with exception 
of mice and dogs where the absorption was rapid. The oral bioavailability varied between species and 
was 21% in the mouse, 9% and 49% in the rat, 66% in the dog, and 37-76% in the monkey. In rats, 
the  fraction  absorbed  was  similar  to  absolute  bioavailability  indicating  a  minor  first-pass  metabolism 
effect.  In  monkeys,  fraction  absorbed  was  1.4  times  higher  suggesting  a  moderate  first-pass  effect, 
which  is  consistent  with  the  low  plasma  clearance.  Gender  differences  were  not  investigated  in  the 
absorption studies.  
The ability of asciminib to permeate across human gastrointestinal tract was assessed using a low efflux 
MDCK  cell  line  where  P-gp  was  knocked  out.  Incubation  with the  drug  for  2  h  at  10  μM  in  the  apical 
compartment led to 88% recovery at the basolateral side pointing out high permeability of asciminib. 
Dissolution  of  asciminib  from  film-coated  tablets  at  40  mg  dose  (two  tablets  containing  20  mg  of  a 
hydrochloride salt of asciminib each) was faster with increasing levels of bile acid, bile salt, and lecithin. 
The addition of cyclodextrin to the fasted intestinal media accelerated dissolution. Accordingly, the flux 
of asciminib decreased in the following order: flux aqueous buffer > fasted state intestinal media > fed 
state intestinal media. The flux in fasted intestinal media was slower when cyclodextrin was added. 
The  plasma  protein  binding  was  high  and  independent  of  concentration  in  all species  tested  (0.945 – 
0.980,  0.973  in  human).  The  human  serum  protein  binding  was  similar  to  plasma  protein  binding 
suggesting that the anticoagulant heparin had no significant effect on the protein binding of asciminib. 
The  blood-to-plasma  ratio  of  asciminib  was  0.80  in  human  and  0.88  –  1.02  in  preclinical  species, 
indicating that asciminib is distributed about 3- to 4-fold more in plasma than in red blood cells. 
After oral administration of 30 mg/kg radiolabelled asciminib to rats, total radioactive components were 
eliminated relatively fast with Tlast being 48 hours or less. Only liver, skin and uveal tract had measurable 
radioactivity  concentrations  until  168  h.  In  male  rats,  the  highest  radioactivity  concentration  in  most 
tissues occurred between 2 h and 4 h post dose. Tissues with highest radioactivity concentrations were 
kidney,  liver,  adrenal,  pancreas,  salivary  gland,  heart,  fat  (brown),  spleen,  lung,  and  gastrointestinal 
Assessment report

tract. This is consistent with target organs of toxicity in animal models being pancreas, liver and adrenal 
gland. Melanin binding of asciminib was observed. The brain tissue/blood Cmax ratio of 0.0149 indicated 
little penetration of the blood-brain barrier. Moderate penetration into the reproductive system of male 
rats  was  found  as  the  tissue/blood  AUClast  ratio  in  the  testes  was  0.510.  In  female  rats,  the  overall 
distribution  pattern  was  similar  to  that  in  male  rats.  The  tissue  radioactivity  concentrations  in  female 
reproductive organs were similar to that in blood or muscle. 
Asciminib was detected in foetal plasma of rats and rabbits in the embryo-foetal developmental studies 
indicating placental transfer. Transfer of asciminib to milk was not investigated. 
Radiolabelled asciminib was used for the metabolism assessment. In vitro metabolism was characterised 
in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, monkey and human hepatocytes. The time-course of asciminib consumption 
by hepatocytes was used to calculate intrinsic clearance values, which ranked as follows across species: 
rat > dog > monkey > human. Interestingly, clearance was markedly lower at higher drug concentration 
for all species studied, indicating possible involvement of transporters. Indeed, asciminib was found to 
be a substrate of P-gp and BCRP (see Clinical AR). Major in vitro biotransformation routes for different 
species  were  direct  glucuronidation,  amide  hydrolysis,  oxidation  at  the  pyrrolidinol  ring  (ketone 
formation, hydroxylation, oxidative ring opening), and O-dealkylation. However, pronounced interspecies 
differences were observed: direct glucuronidation occurred most readily in human, to a lesser extent in 
the dog and monkey, and was noticeably absent in the rat, where the oxidative pathways were most 
prominent.  For  human,  direct  glucuronidation  was  the  major  biotransformation  pathway,  with  the 
respective  metabolites  together  accounting  for  ca.  18%  of  the  radioactivity.  The  other  major  human 
metabolic reactions included oxidative ring opening and oxidation of alcohol to ketone, each contributing 
ca. 5% of the radioactivity. No unique human metabolites were detected.  
Excretion and in vivo metabolism was evaluated in Hanover Wistar rats and cynomolgus monkeys. The 
species selection is justified as both rats and monkeys were used in the pivotal toxicology studies. 
In general, asciminib metabolism was low in all species with 86% - 93% of total AUC as parent in plasma. 
No human major metabolites (AUC >10% total) were found. 
In  rats  independently  of  the  route  of  administration  (i.v.  and  p.o.),  the  major  metabolic  route  was 
oxidation of the pyrrolidine ring followed by ring opening forming a number of products. In rat plasma, 
asciminib  was  the  major  component  (91%  and  86%  of  drug-related  material  following  i.v.  and  p.o. 
dosing,  respectively).  The  most  prominent  metabolite  in  plasma  was  the  product  derived  from  the 
oxidation of alcohol to ketone (2.7% for i.v. and 4.1% for p.o.). 
In  the  monkey,  asciminib  was  metabolised  mainly  by  oxidative  pathways  including  hydroxylation, 
oxidation of alcohol to ketone, and oxidation of the pyrrolidine ring and subsequent ring opening. The 
major component in plasma was asciminib (91.1% and 88.4% of drug-related material after i.v. and p.o. 
administration, respectively) followed by the monohydroxylation product (3% - 4% of the dose). The 
direct O-glucuronide metabolites were found in urine but only to a negligible extent in faeces, probably 
due to their conversion back to the parent drug within the gastrointestinal tract. 
In human plasma as found in the clinical study CABL001A2102, parent drug was the predominant drug-
related component, with an average mean contribution to plasma radioactivity exposure of 92.7%. No 
metabolite  with  mean  contribution  to  plasma  radioactivity  exposure  ≥  10%  was  detected.  Therefore, 
further toxicological qualification of metabolites is not warranted. Circulating metabolites found were the 
direct O-glucuronide (4.93%), the ketone product of alcohol oxidation (1.88%), and the alcohol formed 
from oxidative opening of the pyrrolidinol ring (0.39%).  The glucuronide metabolite was not found in 
the rat plasma due to the absence of glucuronidation pathway in rats but was observed in the monkey 
plasma. The other two above-mentioned metabolites were also detected in the rat and monkey plasma.

After intravenous or oral administration of radiolabelled asciminib to normal HanWistar rats, the 
majority of radioactivity (> 70%) was excreted into faeces. Following intravenous dosing to bile-duct 
cannulated rats, biliary excreted radioactivity accounted for 62.8% of asciminib dose indicating that 
majority of faecal excretion was from biliary elimination. 31.6% of radioactivity was recovered in 
faeces, with the majority being the parent drug (22.7% of the dose), suggesting gastrointestinal 
secretion. After oral asciminib administration to bile-duct cannulated rats, 47.8% of the dose was 
recovered in bile and 46.4% in faeces. Following both i.v. and oral administration of 14C-asciminib to 
cynomolgus monkeys, the radioactivity was predominantly excreted through faeces (>70% of the 
dose). In all pre-clinical species investigated irrespective of the administration route, renal excretion 
was minor and accounted for less than 10% of the dose. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
Toxicology studies submitted included one single dose study and repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats, 
dogs and monkeys (up to 9 months duration), in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies, reproductive 
toxicity studies, phototoxic potential and a number of investigative studies. All pivotal studies were 
conducted in compliance with GLP regulations and used the intended clinical route of administration 
(oral). 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Asciminib was evaluated in one single dose toxicity study in male dogs with escalating doses up to 600 
mg/kg. Within this study the potential toxicity, potential effects on electrocardiography and heart rate 
and the TK profile of asciminib was evaluated. 
Single escalating doses of up to 60 mg/kg were tolerated by the animals whereas single escalating 
doses of 150 and 600 mg/kg resulted in severe vomiting. Hepatocellular injury was noted at 600 
mg/kg due to alterations in ALT and AST activity. At this highest dose, one of the three animals 
exhibited an increase of heart rate; this effect correlated with the highest exposures of asciminib (Cmax 
and AUC). 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Non-pivotal 2 weeks repeat dose toxicity studies were conducted in rats, dogs and monkeys; in monkeys 
a  one-week  study  was  additionally  conducted.  The  pivotal  repeat-dose  toxicity  of  asciminib  was 
evaluated in rats (4- and 26-weeks), dogs (28-weeks), and monkeys (13- and 39-weeks); these studies 
were in compliance with GLP.

In  the  non-pivotal  studies,  dogs  exhibited  the  most  adverse  effects  related  to  asciminib,  especially 
pancreatic  toxicity.  At  doses  ≥60  mg/kg/day  increased  amylase  and  lipase  activities  correlated  with 
degeneration/necrosis of pancreatic acinar cells observed microscopically. Pancreatic toxicity was also 
observed in the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity study in dogs. Microscopic effects on the pancreas together 
with  increased  amylase  and  lipase  levels  were  also  seen  in  monkeys  at  a  dose  of  150  mg/kg/day. 
However,  since  no  control  animals  were  integrated  in  the  monkey  study,  the  findings  are  difficult  to 
interpret.  Elevations  in  liver  enzymes  and/or  bilirubin  values  were  observed  in  dogs  and  monkeys. 
Microscopic observations included minimal infiltration in monkeys whereas in dogs no asciminib-related 
effects correlated with the elevated enzyme levels. Administration of asciminib resulted in reduction in 
red blood cell mass in rat, dog and monkey indicating hemolytic anemia. 
The pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed in rats (4- and 26-weeks), dogs (28-weeks), 
and monkeys (13- and 39-weeks); these studies were in compliance with GLP.

Target organs in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats were the hematopoietic system, liver, spleen, 
adrenal gland, harderian gland and the GI tract/duodenum. Most of the adverse effects resolved during 
the recovery phase. .  Hepatic changes can be considered as the dominant effect in relation to the clinic. 
These  changes  were  characterised  by  increased  incidences  of  hepatocyte  individual  cell  necrosis, 
centrilobular  hepatocyte  hypertrophy,  increased  periportal  population  of  a  mixed  cellular  infiltrate, 
increased incidence of mononuclear cells, pigmented hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, bile duct hyperplasia, 
and  increased  basophilic  foci  of  cellular  alteration  hepatocellular  necrosis.  A  NOAEL  could  not  be 
established in the rat studies since hepatocellular necrosis occurred already at the lowest dose tested 
(≥15 mg/kg/day). This exposure was equivalent or even below the intended clinical dose of 80 mg QD. 
Target organs in the repeat-dose toxicity study in dogs were the hematopoietic system, pancreas and 
liver. Pancreatic toxicity was the limited factor in this study. The pancreas as a target organ was already 
found in the single dose toxicity study. Although asciminib was tolerated up to the highest dose tested 
(60 mg/kg), a NOAEL could not be established due to the pancreatic toxicity which was observed at ≥3 
mg/kg/day (corresponding to exposure multiples below the intended human dose of 40 mg BID or 80 
mg  QD).  The  reason  of  this  toxicity  was  evaluated  in  additional  studies  but  could  not  be  established 
during  these  studies.  Since  pancreatic  enzyme  increase  and  pancreatitis  events  were  reported  in  the 
clinical development program, effects on the pancreas should be carefully monitored in patients.  
Target organs identified in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in monkeys were the liver, kidney, adrenal 
gland,  hematopoietic  system.  Histopathologically,  hepatic  changes  were  characterised  by  reversible 
diffuse hepatocellular hypertrophy in monkeys and occurred at AUC exposures, which was 18-fold higher 
than the one achieved in patients at the 40 mg BID dose. The monkey studies were the only studies in 
which a NOAEL could be established: 30 mg/kg in the 13 week and 50 mg/kg in the 39-week study. 
Anatomic changes were not present at the end of the recovery period. However, changes in haematology 
could be an indicator of organ toxicity; thus, the appropriate values should be carefully monitored in the 
clinical setting. 
Moderate CV effects (increased heart rate, decreased systolic pressure, decreased mean arterial 
pressure, and decreased arterial pulse pressure) were observed with asciminib in jacket telemetered 
male dogs at single dose of 600 mg/kg or in the invasive telemetry CV safety study at 60 mg/kg. 
There was no QTc prolongation. Based on the exposure achieved in the 4-week dog toxicity study, the 
anticipated Cmax at 600 mg/kg in dogs was estimated to be ≈ 142000 ng/mL, which would correspond 
to a free Cmax of 6.3 μM (Free fraction in dog: 0.02); a value 100-fold and 60-fold higher than the one 
achieved in patients at 40 mg BID and 80 mg QD respectively. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity

Asciminib showed no evidence for a genotoxic potential. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
As this application is for the use of asciminib for the treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia 
chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) previously treated 
with two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors no carcinogenicity studies were submitted, which was 
considered acceptable.

The potential for reproductive and/or developmental toxicity of asciminib was investigated in a study on 
fertility and early embryonic development in the rat and studies on embryo-foetal development in rats 
and  rabbits.  Asciminib  was  orally  applied.  Toxicokinetic  data  on  maternal  and  foetal  exposures  were 
concomitantly obtained with the studies on embryo-foetal development. All pivotal studies were carried 
out in accordance with the relevant ICH guidelines and in compliance with GLP regulations. A study on 
pre-postnatal development was not performed.  
In  the  study  on  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development,  effects  were  observed  on  sperm  motility 
and/or sperm counts and the number of live embryos at the highest dose of 200 mg/kg/day which equal 
AUC exposures 19-fold or 13-fold higher than those achieved in patients at the 40 mg twice-daily and 
80 mg once-daily doses, respectively. Therefore, the NOEL for reproductive effects and early embryonic 
development was considered to be 50 mg/kg/day equalling clinical exposures approximately 5- or 3-fold 
higher than human therapeutic exposures at 40 mg twice daily, respectively 80 mg QD. Otherwise no 
maternal or paternal toxicity was noticed at 200 mg/kg/day. 
In the study on embryo-foetal development in the rat, the high dose group of 600 mg/kg/day had to be 
terminated because of severe clinical signs and mortality. A slightly increased incidence of foetuses and 
litters with malformations (cleft palate, anasarca) and visceral variations observed in the mid dose group 
of 150 mg/kg/day was attributed to asciminib treatment. There was a dose-related increase in foetal 
weights  from  the  low  dose  on  (25  mg/kg/day).  Foetal  variations,  primarily  at  150  mg/kg/day,  in  the 
urinary tract and skeleton (skull, vertebral column and ribs) were suggestive of changes in the rate of 
development. Foetal exposure to asciminib was shown with foetal plasma levels showing approximately 
1/10  of  maternal  levels.  The  maternal  NOAEL  was  considered  to  be  at  150  mg/kg/day.  The  embryo-
foetal NOAEL was established at 25 mg/kg/day resulting in exposures which equal human therapeutic 
exposures. 
In the embryo-foetal development study in rabbits, the high dose group of 300 mg/kg/day had to be 
terminated due to distinct signs of toxicity. An increased number of resorptions, a lower number of live 
foetuses and accordingly an increased post-implantation loss was noticed in the mid dose group of 50 
mg/kg/day. Additionally, a low incidence of foetuses with cardiac malformations was observed in this 
dose group. Since similar abnormalities concerning the heart and major vessels were also noted in the 
dose-range finding study in the rabbit, a relationship to asciminib treatment cannot be discounted. Foetal 
exposure to asciminib was shown by obtaining toxicokinetic data from foetal and maternal plasma. The 
maternal NOAEL was considered to be 50 mg/kg/day. Based on the increased post-implantation loss and 
cardiac malformations observed, the embryo-foetal NOAEL was established at 15 mg/kg/day. Exposures 
at this dose equal human therapeutic exposures. 
Since asciminib showed teratogenicity in rats and rabbits at human therapeutic exposures, a pre-
/postnatal development study was not performed

2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
The recommended daily dose of asciminib in patients is 40 mg/day BID or 80 mg QD. Because of the 
relatively  high  sensitivities  of  the  animal  species  to  the  toxic  effects  of  asciminib,  a  margin  of  safety 
either could not be established or was low with respect to the repeat dose toxicity studies relative to the 
exposure levels obtained in humans at the human oral dose of 40 or 80 mg/day. One exception were 
the repeat-dose toxicity studies in monkeys.

2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
The local tolerance of asciminib has been evaluated using the murine local lymph node assay (LLNA 
TIER I). The result of this study demonstrated that asciminib appeared to be a strong sensitiser, since 
the cell count index exceeded the threshold of 1.3 at the lowest concentration of 0.25% (1.65). 
Moderate irritating potential was ascribed to asciminib and should adequately labelled in the SmPC. 
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
Studies on impurities 
In  silico  testing  of  potential  mutagenic  impurities  was  performed  with  Derek  Nexus,  Lhasa  Ltd.  Case 
Ultra,  MCASE  Inc.  and  Sarah  Nexus,  Lhasa  Ltd.  systems.  According  to  the  Applicant  predictions  were 
performed in years 2015, 2016, 2019 and 2020 and different version numbers of the programs have 
been used.  
In silico positive impurities were tested with follow up Ames tests. Theses assays were not performed 
under GLP conditions but according to the study protocols, general rules of OECD and UK MHRA were 
followed. 
The impurities thionyl chloride (CAS 7719-09-7), Glycerol (CAS 56-81-5),  p-nitrophenol (CAS 100-02-
7),  p-aminophenol  (CAS  123-30-8),  N,N-Diisopropyl  ethylamine  (DIPEA,  CAS  7087-68-5), 
Methanesulfonic acid (CAS 75-75-2), 4-(trifluoro methoxy)aniline (CAS 461-82-5), and (cyclohex-2-en-
1-one, CAS 930-68-7) were assessed for their mutagenic potential using literature data. Based on this 
review, only thionyl chloride (CAS 7719-09-7) was considered to be mutagenic impurity. 
Phototoxicity 
The in vivo mouse oral photo-local lymph node assay demonstrated a phototoxic potential at dose ≥ 200 
mg/kg/day.  At  the  no-observed-adverse-effect  level  (NOAEL)  of  60  mg/kg/day,  the  Cmax  was  12000 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 34/128 
 
 
 
 
ng/mL, exposure 15- or 6-fold than the Cmax exposure in patients at the dose of 40 mg BID or 80 mg 
QD, respectively. 
Mechanistic studies 
The toxicological effects of asciminib was established when administered as a single dose followed by 3 
days of observation (sighting phase) and as a daily dose (repeat phase) for 2 weeks to male dogs. The 
study  was  also  designed  to  assess  the  time-course  toxicity  effects  and  the  toxicokinetic  profile  of 
asciminib. 60 mg/kg asciminib administered as single dose to male beagle dogs was generally tolerated. 
Further, the same dose was not tolerated after repeated dosing for up to 2 weeks with toxicity findings 
similar to previously known findings of asciminib in beagle dogs (Study 1270620). 
One further study was performed in order to investigate/characterise the early onset pancreatic toxicity 
in male dogs, when administered at 60 mg/kg/day for 3 to 7 days.  
In a 4-week dog toxicity study (study no. 1270620), administration of asciminib resulted in atrophy of 
the pancreas at 60 mg/kg. The pancreas was replaced by adipocytes with bands of fibrous tissue on the 
mesenteric surface with bands of fibrous tissue extending through the adipocytes. Degeneration/necrosis 
of acinar cells with fibrosis was present in males and females given ≥15 mg/kg/day. The effects were not 
reversible.  Increased  amylase  and 
lipase  activities  correlated  with  pancreatic  acinar  cell 
degeneration/necrosis.  
In this mechanistic study similar findings were present in the animals: There was an increase in lipase 
and amylase activity which correlated with pancreatic findings including acinar and duct cell degeneration 
and fibroplasia. Oedema and inflammatory cell infiltration was limited to animals most severely affected 
by acinar and duct cell degeneration. The mechanism of this toxicity could not be attributed to a specific 
cell signature. As a result, the reason for the pancreatic toxicity which was present only in the dog could 
not be elucidated. However, changes if lipase and amylase values should be carefully monitored in the 
clinical setting. 
In addition, evaluation of the pancreatic toxicity included assessment of circulating microRNAs in dog 
plasma as markers of pancreatic injury. MicroRNAs are known to play an important role in pancreatic 
physiology and each islet cell type has a specific pattern of microRNA expression (Klein et al. 2013). The 
treatment  with  a  drug  inducing  pancreas  injury  or  the  progression  of  pancreas  injury  during  disease 
shows  an  increase  of  plasma  levels  of  microRNAs  (Erener  et  al.  2013,  Chakraborty  et  al.  2011). 
Measurement of mRNA signature was done at several time points within a two week investigative study 
in male dogs.  
One  out  of  three  dogs  had  a  slight  increase  of  pancreatic  exocrine,  endocrine  alpha-  and  beta-cells 
microRNA  signatures.  This  result  is  difficult  to  interpret.  It  may  be  concluded  that  these  changes  of 
pancreatic microRNA signatures were concomitant to the mild increases of lipase and amylase activities 
and correlated with the presence of pancreas injury. 
Because there is a very high overall protein sequence conservation of ABL1 and ABL2 kinase domains 
across human and toxicology relevant species (mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, minipig, cynomolgus and rhesus 
monkeys), the potential of on-target side effects occurring across these domains was evaluated. Further, 
the potential impact of any amino acid variant on asciminib (ABL001) binding affinity using 3D structural 
data was evaluated. 
Based on protein sequence homology and structural modelling, from a sequence analysis, asciminib is 
likely to bind similarly to rat, rabbit, dog, cynomolgus monkey and human ABL1/ABL2.

2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A Phase I ERA has been provided for the active substance asciminib hydrochloride in accordance with 
the current guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). 
The  PEC  surfacewater  value  is  below  the  action  limit  of  0.01  µg/L  and  the  ERA  can  stop  in  Phase  I. 
Asciminib hydrochloride is not a potential PBT substance as log Kow is below the trigger value of 4.5.  
Based on the data provided it can be expected that asciminib hydrochloride will not pose a risk to the 
environment when used in accordance with the SmPC. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamic effects: In vitro, asciminib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of ABL1 at mean 
IC50  values  below  3 nanomolar.  In  patient-derived  cancer  cells,  asciminib  specifically  inhibits  the 
proliferation  of  cells  harbouring  BCR::ABL1  with  IC50  values  between  1  and  25 nanomolar.  In  cells 
engineered to express either the wild-type or the T315I mutant form of BCR::ABL1, asciminib inhibits 
cell growth with mean IC50 values of 0.61 ± 0.21 and 7.64 ± 3.22 nanomolar, respectively. In mouse 
xenograft models of CML, asciminib dose-dependently inhibited the growth of tumours harbouring either 
the wild-type or the T315I mutant form of BCR::ABL1, with tumour regression being observed at doses 
above 7.5 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg twice daily, respectively. The IC50 values are mentioned in the SmPC. 
Experiments  on  large  tumour  cell  line  panels  revealed  high  selectivity  of  asciminib  for  BCR-ABL1 
expressing  cells.  Two  primary  metabolites  of  asciminib,  the  oxidation  product  and  the  pyrrolidine 
cleavage product, were found to be less potent in inhibition of ABL enzymatic activity and due to their 
low levels of these metabolites in plasma of patients, their contribution to the pharmacological activity 
is expected to be minimal. 
Combination of asciminib with nilotinib appeared to be more effective than either drug alone. Based on 
the pharmacokinetic data, the applicant claimed that asciminib exposure was similar in single-agent use 
and in the combination, so that the synergistic interaction cannot be attributed to pharmacokinetic drug 
interactions. This conclusion was not agreed. As is clear from plasma concentration vs. time profile in 
study  RD-2013-50274,  AUC  of  asciminib  is  higher  when  combined  with  nilotinib.  Similar  moderate 
increase in exposure in the combination setting was observed in the clinical study X2101 and was related 
to the ability of nilotinib to inhibit UGTs and moderately CYP3A4. The SmPC of the product was updated 
accordingly. 
No  substantial  off-target  kinase  activity  was  detected.  A  greater  than  50%  inhibition  was  found  for 
lipoxygenase, for the vesicular monoamine transporter and for the serotonin 5HT2B receptor with IC50 
in low micromolar range, however the safety margin for the 80 mg QD dose is higher than 30, therefore, 
off-target  related  adverse  reactions  from  interactions  on  the  above-mentioned  targets  are  unlikely 
clinically relevant, especially given low brain penetration. 
Asciminib had no marked effects on hERG and some other cardiac channels (Nav1.5, IKs, L-type Cav1.2) 
and on cardiovascular parameters in dogs.  
In order to study pharmacokinetics of asciminib in pre-clinical models, the analytical LC-MS/MS methods 
for quantitative determination of the drug in rat, mouse, dog, rabbit and monkey plasma were developed 
and  in  general  successfully  validated.  The  general  problem  in  the  validation  was  the  carryover  effect 
observed  in  all  but  rabbit plasma.  The  applicant  examined  bioanalytical  raw  data  from  the  respective 
toxicokinetic  studies  for  the  possible  impact  due  to  the  observed  carryover.  The  observed  greatest 
difference (high to low) between sequential incurred samples was 31.5 - 155 times (depending on the 
study), instead of 1000 times in the method validation. Based on the most significant carryover in each 
Assessment report

Page 36/128 
 
 
 
matrix  (42.2%  -  72.5%  of  the  response  at  the  LLOQ  level  depending  on  the matrix)  observed  in  the 
validation  runs,  the  estimated  maximum  contribution  from  the  high  concentration  sample  to  the 
immediate  next  sample  was  calculated  as  0.9%  -  5.5%  depending  on  the  matrix  and  the  respective 
toxicokinetic study. It was concluded that the observed carryover in the method validation has no impact 
on study sample analysis.  
After intravenous administration of asciminib, plasma clearance was low to moderate and the half-life of 
the  drug  was  short  to  moderate.  Following  oral  dosing,  asciminib  was  moderately  absorbed  in  most 
animals with exception of mice and dogs where the absorption was rapid. The studies were performed 
only  with  male  animals.  The  applicant  justified  the  use  of  only  male  animals  by  the  fact  that  in  the 
asciminib toxicity studies, no apparent AUC and Cmax difference were seen between male and female 
animals (see Toxicology section). Since in the toxicity studies, performed in rat, dog and monkey, the 
male to female ratios of AUC and Cmax over the different dose ranges or time of dosing were generally 
acceptable (usually less than 2-fold different, the use of male animals only was not considered to have 
an impact on understanding the pharmacokinetics of asciminib in the preclinical species. Some studies 
were conducted with free base and some with the chloride salt of asciminib, the latter being the clinically 
used formulation. This is acceptable since the intended clinical administration route is oral, and the free 
base is expected to be protonated in the stomach. 
The  plasma  protein  binding  was  high  and  independent  of  concentration  in  all species  tested  (0.945 – 
0.980).  After  oral  administration  of  radiolabelled  asciminib  to  rats,  tissues  with  highest  radioactivity 
concentrations  were  kidney,  liver,  adrenal, pancreas,  salivary  gland, heart,  fat  (brown),  spleen, lung, 
and  gastrointestinal  tract.  This  is  consistent  with  target  organs  of  toxicity  in  animal  models  being 
pancreas, liver and adrenal gland. Melanin binding of asciminib was observed. Little penetration of the 
blood-brain  barrier  was  detected.  Asciminib  was  detected  in  foetal  plasma  of  rats  and  rabbits  in  the 
embryo-foetal developmental studies indicating placental transfer.  
Major  in  vitro  biotransformation  routes  of  asciminib  for  different  species  were  direct  glucuronidation, 
amide  hydrolysis,  oxidation  at  the  pyrrolidinol  ring  (ketone  formation,  hydroxylation,  oxidative  ring 
opening),  and  O-dealkylation.  For  human,  direct  glucuronidation  was  the  major  biotransformation 
pathway. The other major human metabolic reactions included oxidative ring opening and oxidation of 
alcohol to ketone. No unique human metabolites were detected. 
In rats, the major metabolic route was oxidation of the pyrrolidine ring followed by ring opening forming 
a number of products. In rat plasma, asciminib was the major component. In the monkey, asciminib was 
metabolised mainly by oxidative pathways. The major component in plasma was asciminib. The direct 
O-glucuronide metabolites were found in urine but only to a negligible extent in faeces, probably due to 
their conversion back to the parent drug within the gastrointestinal tract. In human plasma, parent drug 
was  the  predominant  drug-related  component.  No  metabolite  with  mean  contribution  to  plasma 
radioactivity exposure ≥ 10% was detected. Therefore, further toxicological qualification of metabolites 
is not warranted.  
In rats and monkeys, asciminib was mainly excreted into faeces. The majority of faecal excretion was 
apparently  from  biliary  elimination.  In  all  pre-clinical  species  investigated  irrespective  of  the 
administration route, renal excretion was minor and accounted for less than 10% of the dose. 
Target  organs  besides  the  pancreas  were  liver,  hematopoietic  system,  adrenal  gland  and  the  gastro-
intestinal tract. Most of the findings reversed during a 4-week recovery phase.  
Elevations in liver enzymes and/or bilirubin values were observed in rats, dogs and monkeys and were 
characterised  by  centrilubolur  hepatocyte  hypertrophy  slight  bile  duct  hyperplasia  and  increased 
individual  hepatocyte  necrosis  in  rats  and  reversible  diffuse  hepatocellular  hypertrophy  in  monkeys. 
These changes were fully reversible.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 37/128 
 
 
 
A  minimal  to  mild,  regenerative  reduction  in  red  blood  cells  mass  in  rat,  dog  and  monkey  has  been 
observed and was consistent with a regenerative, extravascular, haemolytic anaemia. 
Minimal mucosal hypertrophy/hyperplasia (increase in thickness of the mucosa with frequent elongation 
of villi) was present in the duodenum of rats treated at high doses of asciminib (600 mg/kg/day). These 
changes were fully reversible. 
In rats and monkeys, minimal or slight hypertrophy of the adrenal gland and mild or moderate decreased 
vacuolation in the zona fasiculata occurred. These changes were fully reversible. 
Dose-limiting toxicity in dogs only was mortality as a consequence of pancreatic toxicity. This pancreatic 
acinar atrophy was observed at AUC exposures below to those achieved in patients at the 40 mg BID or 
80 mg QD dose. There was a correlation between the presence of increased serum amylase and lipase 
activities and the presence of pancreatic acinar cell damage at necropsy. The reason for this toxicity was 
evaluated  in  several  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  including  different  dose  and  time  frames  and  an 
assessment of circulating microRNAs. However, the cause for this mortality could not be clearly attributed 
to  a  specific  cell  signature.  Pancreatic  enzyme  increase  should  be  carefully  monitored  in  the  clinical 
setting (see section 4.4 of the SmPC).  
Administration  of  asciminib  resulted  in  moderate  CV  effects  (increased  heart  rate,  decreased  systolic 
pressure,  decreased  mean  arterial  pressure,  and  decreased  arterial  pulse pressure)  were  observed  in 
jacket telemetered male dogs at single dose of 600 mg/kg or in the invasive telemetry CV safety study 
at 60 mg/kg. There was no QTc prolongation indicating no effect on QT prolongation. Only few events of 
electrocardiogram QT prolonged were reported in the clinical studies. However, an effect of asciminib on 
QT prolongation cannot be completely ruled out (see section 4.4 of the SmPC).  
Reproductive toxicity of asciminib was evaluated in a study of fertility and early embryonic development 
in the rat and embryo-toxicity studies in rats and rabbits. A study on pre-postnatal development was not 
performed which was agreed beforehand in a Scientific Advice by EMA.  
It is unknown whether or not asciminib is present in human milk. Since there is the potential for serious 
adverse reactions in nursing infants the following advice on use during breast-feeding: “Because of the 
potential  of  serious  adverse  reactions  in  the  breast  fed  newborn/infant,  breast-feeding  should  be 
discontinued during treatment and for at least 3 days after stopping treatment with asciminib.” is given 
under SmPC section 4.6. This is in line with the EMA “Guideline on risk assessment of medicinal products 
on  human  reproduction  and  lactation:  from  data  to  labelling”  (EMEA/CHMP/203927/2005),  and  with 
other  products  of  this  class  and  thus  agreed.  However,  the  wording  of  the  SmPC  concerning  breast-
feeding should also be reflected in the wording of the PIL. Therefore, the wording of the PIL has been 
updated to reflect the wording of the SmPC. 
Asciminib  showed  no  evidence  for  a  genotoxic  potential  in  a  standard  genotoxicity  battery. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted in accordance with ICH S9. 
Asciminib was found to be phototoxic in vitro and in vivo. 
In silico positive impurities were tested with follow up Ames tests. Theses assays were not performed 
under GLP conditions however according to the study protocols, general rules of OECD and UK MHRA 
were followed and lack of full GLP compliance is acceptable. 
Asciminib PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. and is not a PBT substance as log 
Kow does not exceed 4.5. Asciminib hydrochloride will not pose a risk to the environment when used in 
accordance with the SmPC.

2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology related information and PK profile of asciminib has been evaluated in healthy 
volunteers (single and multiple doses of 40 mg, single 80 mg dose in hADME study) and patients with 
CML-CP without and with the T315I mutation at a dose range between 10 to 200 mg BID and 80 to 200 
mg QD. PK and PD data were also evaluated in several models, including IVIVC, popPK, PBPK and ER.

Asciminib was analysed in human plasma using a validated LC-MS/MS method with the LLOQ of 
1.00 ng/mL (expressed in free base) and a dynamic range of 1.00 to 5000 ng/mL for the analyte using 
25 or 50 μL of human plasma. 
Absorption  
Asciminib HCl is very slightly soluble, although above pH 3 the drug substance solution is able to form 
of a supersaturated solution which precipitates over time as the free base form (see quality part). The 
two  forms  of  asciminib  drug  substance  (free  base  and  HCl  salt  form)  demonstrated  a  strong  pH 
dependent  solubility  profile  in  aqueous  solution.  Asciminib  HCl  film-coated  tablet  40 mg  formed  a 
supersaturated solution in pH 4.5 and 6.8, the amount of the asciminib in solution was therefore greater 
than the one expected by the equilibrium solubility values across the neutral pH.  
Different formulations have been used in the clinical studies: asciminib free base as solid dispersion in 
capsule (strengths of 5, 20, and 50 mg) and FCT formulation (strength of 20 mg) and asciminib HCl in 
FCT  formulation  (strengths  of  20  mg  and  40  mg).  All  PK-relevant  studies,  such  as  DDI,  special 
populations,  have  utilised  the  FMI  tablet  (Final  Market  Image)  that  was  bioequivalent  to  the  early 
capsule. 
Two  stage  biorelevant  dissolution  studies  with  fasted  state  simulated  gastric  (FaSSGF)  and  intestinal 
(FaSSIF) fluids were performed using the 40 mg FCT. The results showed that the asciminib tablet was 
rapidly dissolved in FaSSGF (pH 1.6) and remained in solution in FaSSIF (pH 6.5) while one would have 
expected precipitation based on the equilibrium solubility values. With increasing levels of bile acid, bile 
salt  and  lecithin,  the  flux  of  asciminib  through  a  membrane  decreased  (aqueous  buffer  >  FaSSIF  > 
FeSSIF). These results suggest that asciminib may be prone to sequester when high levels of bile acids 
are present in the gastrointestinal tract. 
The  absolute  bioavailability  of  asciminib  was  not  evaluated  in  clinical  studies.  The  estimated  absolute 
bioavailability was 73% in the PBPK model. The bioavailability of asciminib decreased with food and was 
more pronounced with a high-fat meal with 62.3% decrease in AUCinf compared to 30% decrease with 
a  low-fat  meal.  Tmax  was  observed  at  mean  2  hours,  and  was  delayed  by  1  and  2  hours  when 
administered with a low-fat and high-fat meal, respectively (Figure 3 below).

Distribution 
The fraction of asciminib binding to plasma proteins was 97.3% in human, i.e. unbound fraction in plasma 
(fu) was 2.7%. In the mass balance study, the mean (SD) blood / plasma ratio for total radioactivity 
averaged over 0.5 to 48 hours, was 0.581 (0.04). 
The geo-mean (geoCV%) apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) was 89.0 L (6.1%) based on the mass 
balance  study  and  the  PopPK  analysis.  For  a  typical  individual  (70  kg  male)  the  combined  apparent 
volumes  of  central  and  peripheral  compartments  were  approximately  111  L  (V1 46.5 L,  V2  64.5 L), 
suggesting distribution into tissues. 
Based on animal data, no or little CNS exposure to asciminib is expected in human. 
Elimination 
The apparent terminal elimination half-life (T1/2) was observed in HV with 10.5 - 14 hours.

The apparent clearance (CL/F) of asciminib was 4.34 L/hr in HV (geomean; 80 mg single dose in mass 
balance study), thus, for human PK a low first-pass metabolism effect is expected. Based on PopPK in 
patients the apparent clearance was 6.31 L/hr for a total daily dose of 80 mg. 
Figure 4 Proposed main elimination pathways 
In the mass balance study A2102 mean recovery of radioactivity in urine and faeces was 91.0±2.25% 
of dose with 80.0±1.58% for faeces and 11.0±1.46% for urine. 
Parent asciminib was the main drug-related component in plasma at all time points analysed, with mean 
92.7%  of  the  total  radioactivity  AUC0-24 hours.  Metabolite  M30.5  (direct  O-glucuronide)  accounted  for 
4.93% of total AUC. Minor metabolite M44 accounted for 1.88% of total AUC. Trace amount of M29.5 
(0.39%)  was  also  detected.  10  radiolabelled  metabolites  were  characterized  and  quantified  in  the 
excreta. 
In urine, unchanged asciminib ranged from 1.8 to 3.1% of the administered radioactive dose, with an 
average value of 2.5%. The estimated mean CLr of asciminib (0.108 L/hour) was minimal with only 1.4% 
of the glomerular filtration rate (7.5 L/hour), suggesting minimal renal transporters involvement.  
In the cumulative faeces asciminib accounted for 53.7% to 58.5% of the administered radioactive dose, 
with an average value of 56.7%. The O-glucuronide metabolite M30.5 that was detected in urine as the 
dominant component was absent in faeces because it was presumably converted back to parent in the 
gastro-intestinal lumen. The amount of unchanged asciminib in faeces may therefore be overestimated 
as it also included the undetermined amount of M30.5. 
The  main  biotransformation  pathways  of  asciminib  are  oxidation  at  the  pyrrolidinol  ring  and  direct 
glucuronidation.  Negligible  biotransformation  pathway  included  oxidation  of  alcohol  to  ketone, 
O-dealkylation and amide hydrolysis. Various combinations of the above biotransformation reactions 
were also observed. 
Asciminib has one chiral centre and the therapeutic isomer has R-configuration, with no observed inter-
conversion.

Considering the low human plasma exposure of M29.5 (0.39%) and M44 (1.88% of total AUC) after a 
single asciminib dose of 80 mg, the contribution of both metabolites to total pharmacological activity in 
human is negligible (0.22% and 0.80% for M29.5 and M44, respectively). 
The different UGT2B7 phenotypes and allele-combination genotypes did not result in statistically 
significant difference in Ctrough levels. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Exposure, both AUC and Cmax, increased in an over-proportional manner for BID regimens between 10-
200 mg, and increased nearly dose proportional for QD regimens between 80-200 mg. 
Accumulation of asciminib exposure was observed at steady state with the geo-mean ratio of 1.65-2.29 
for the BID dosing. No time-dependent PK was observed. 
The intra-individual variability in healthy volunteers was low with approximately 6-29%, the inter-subject 
variability was low to moderate with 14-52% for AUC and Cmax. 
In CML patients, the inter-subject variability at 40 mg BID was moderate with 47-50% for AUClast and 
Cmax, respectively. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
In the ongoing multicentre, open-label, 5-arm, dose escalation first-in-human Phase I study X2101 in 
patients  with  CML  or  Ph+  ALL  the  MTD/RDE  (recommended  extension  dose)  the  PK  profile  and 
preliminary  evidence  of  efficacy  in  a  dose  range  of  10-280  mg  was  evaluated.  Full  PK  sampling  was 
performed on C1D1, C1D15, C2D1. Pre-dose samples were also taken up to cycle 6. See Table below for 
a PK summary. 
Geo-mean CL decreased from 8.40 to 3.81 L/hr (for 10 mg BID to 280 mg BID, resp.), with 7.6 L/hr for 
40 mg BID. Clearances for 80-200 mg QD doses were between 5.29-5.76 L/hr. 
In the pivotal Phase III, multi-centre, open-label, active-controlled randomized study A2301 Ph+ CML-
CP  patients  received  40mg  BID.  Full  PK  sampling  was  obtained  for  14  patients,  all  patients  provided 
samples for sparse PK. 
Geo-mean (geo-CV%) Ctrough from the full-sampling group at C2D1 was 297 ng/ml (47.2%). Ctrough levels 
in the total population (full and sparse PK) remained similar over the 24 week study time.

Non-compartmental analysis from study X2101 showed that at steady state (C2D1), AUC0-24hr (= total 
daily exposure, i.e., 2x AUCtau for 40 mg BID) and Cmax were 40% and 130% higher, respectively, and 
Ctrough (Cmin) was 23% lower at 80 mg QD compared to 40 mg BID.

each. Based on the simulation, the average AUC0-24h values were comparable between the two regimens 
40 mg BID and 80 mg QD. Cmax and Cmin were approximately 70% higher and 27% lower, respectively, 
for 80 mg QD compared to that of 40 mg BID, respectively. 
Table 12   Summary of simulated PK metrics of 40 mg BID and 80 mg QD 
Population PK modelling 
PK modelling was used for further analysis of the pharmacokinetics of asciminib. 
A two-compartment PopPK model for asciminib with a delayed first-order absorption and was used to 
characterize PK of asciminib. An over-proportional increase of exposure with dose was described through 
the PopPK model using dose as a covariate on CL already in the base model. Using dose as a covariate 
on bioavailability, was not sufficient to describe the PK of asciminib. Also allometric scaling with fixed 
exponents at 0.75 and 1 for CL and V1 was already incorporated in the base model. 
Modelling  revealed  nominal  total  daily  dose,  baseline  body  weight  and  baseline  aGFR  were  to  be 
statistically significant covariates on CL. Formulation was found to be a statistically significant covariate 
of  ka.  Modelling  results  for  the  final  PopPK  covariate  model  parameter  estimates  are  shown  in  the 
following table.  
Using total daily dose as a covariate results in no differentiation between the 40 mg BID and the 80 mg 
QD regimen. Results for the evaluation of the dose regimen as a covariate were submitted and showed 
a better fit for the 40 mg BID regimen compared to the 80 mg QD regimen.

Special populations 
In the dedicated renal impairment study A2105 6 subjects in the normal cohort, and 8 subjects in severe 
renal impairment cohort were enrolled and received a single 40 mg asciminib dose. 
Severe  renal  impairment  resulted  in  an  increase  of  +56%  in  AUCinf  and  +49%  in  AUClast  with 
comparable Cmax (+8%). CL/F was reduced by -36%. T1/2 was prolonged to 17.1 hours. Results for the 
unbound fraction were comparable.

In the popPK analysis, renal function was found to be a statistically significant covariate on clearance. 
The applicant states that this effect is clinically not relevant and no dose adjustment for subjects with 
renal impairment is needed. 
The dedicated hepatic impairment study A2103 assessed the PK of 40 mg asciminib in 32 non-cancer 
subjects with impaired hepatic function based on Child-Pugh (CP) classification and healthy subjects 
with normal hepatic function (8 subjects per group). 
Compared to normal, CP-A showed 22% higher AUCinf, 21% higher AUClast, 26% higher Cmax; 
CP-B had similar exposure (3% higher AUCinf and AUClast, 1.7% lower Cmax); CP-C had 66% higher 
AUCinf, 55% higher AUClast, and 29% higher Cmax. CL/F of asciminib was comparable among normal, 
mild and moderate HI groups but lower for the severe group. T1/2 of in the severe group was 
prolonged. Results for unbound fractions were comparable.

In the popPK model, while not statistically significant, a trend to lower clearance was observed in the 
severe hepatic impaired group. The clearance for a typical patient following a total daily dose of 60 mg 
and 80 mg is 6.97 L/h and 6.31 L/h, respectively. The PopPK derived steady-state AUC0-24h for 
subjects with severe hepatic impairment (based on the individual estimates (EBE) of the subjects from 
the hepatic impairment study A2103) was 13018 ng*h/mL and hence marginally higher than the 
AUC0-24h in patients with CML with normal hepatic function (i.e., AUC0-24h: 12638 ng*h/mL for 40 
mg b.i.d.). 
Based on the popPK results there was no apparent difference in the PK of asciminib in female (43% of 
all  patients)  compared  to  male  patients.  Both  race  (non-Asian,  Asian)  and  ethnicity  (non-Japanese, 
Japanese) were found not to be statistically significant covariates on clearance and the impact of body 
weight on AUC was minimal. Age, studied over the range of 22 to 88 years in Study X2101 and of 24 to 
83  years  (asciminib  treatment  arm)  in  Study  A2301,  was  not  found  to  be  a  statistically  significant 
covariate on clearance. In clinical PK studies only 8 patients between 65-74 years of age were evaluated 
for PK. However, the pivotal study included CML patients of up to 83 years, so that exposure data have 
been obtained at least from sparse sampling. 
Table 16 Age Distribution of patients across studies 
No clinical study with asciminib has been conducted in children, hence the PK of asciminib in children is 
unknown. 
PBPK modelling 
A PBPK model for asciminib was developed and validated (Study 2000208) as a CYP3A4, UGT and 
BCRP substrate and perpetrator of CYP enzymes for the dose of 40 mg asciminib to predict the effect 
Assessment report

of food, and hepatic or renal impairment. This model was also applied (Study 2001088) to predict DDI 
scenarios which has not been tested clinically for the doses of 80 and 200 mg. Furthermore, it was 
used to predict the effect of food, hepatic and renal impairment under these conditions. 
The PBPK model was developed for 40 mg BID, only study CABL001X2101 included also a dosing 
regimen of 80 mg QD. Data from this study was then split into training PK dataset and a verification PK 
dataset. For a single dose of 40 mg in healthy subjects, the model predicted PK parameters within 
26% of the observed values. For multiple dosing in a wider dose range (20-200 mg) including 80 mg 
QD the PBPK model predicted parameters within 45% of the observed values.  
A stepwise “middle out” PBPK modelling workflow was implemented using Simcyp simulator 19.1 as 
outlined in the following figure:

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In  combination  with  acid  reducing  agents  (20  mg  rabeprazole)  in  study  A1101  the  GMRs  (AUC  0.99, 
Cmax  0.91)  and  90%  CIs  of  asciminib  PK  parameters  were  within  0.80  to  1.25,  showing  that 
bioavailability of asciminib was not affected by the co-administration of rabeprazole. 
In study A2107 the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole as oral solution unexpectedly decreased AUCinf 
and Cmax by -40% and -50%. In contrast, when itraconazole was given as a capsule, exposure (AUCinf: 
+4%) and Cmax (+4%) tended to be slightly increased and CL/F and Vz/F slightly decreased compared 
to asciminib alone. 
With the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor clarithromycin AUCinf was increased by 36% and Cmax by 19%. 
With  the  P-gp  inhibitor  quinidine,  AUCinf  and  Cmax  were  slightly  lower  by  -13%  and  -11%,  resp., 
confirming that asciminib absorption and elimination is independent of P-gp. 
With  the  strong  CYP3A4  inducer  rifampicin,  AUCinf  was  slightly  lower  by  -15%  and  -11%,  and  Cmax 
slightly higher +9%. 
Study  E2101  investigated  the  effect  of  multiple  doses  of  400  mg  imatinib,  an  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4 
(reversible and time-dependent), P-gp, UGT1A3/4, UGT2B17 and BCRP on single-dose 40 mg asciminib. 
Both,  imatinib  and  asciminib  were  administered  30  minutes  after  start  of  a  low-fat  meal.  Asciminib 
exposure was about doubled (+108%) in combination with imatinib under low-fat conditions and Cmax 
+59% increased, clearance was reduced to ~48% in combination. 
In  patient  study  X2101  in  combination  with  nilotinib  and  imatinib  AUCtau  and  Cmax  of  asciminib 
moderately increased by up to 2.1-fold, and no difference was observed in combination with dasatinib. 
After multiple doses of asciminib, CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 were mildly inhibited, with exposure of substrate 
CYP3A4 midazolam increased for AUCinf +28% and Cmax +11%, and S-warfarin AUCinf +41 and Cmax 
+8%. The exposure of CYP2C8 substrate repaglinide was nearly unaffected by asciminib. 
The inhibitory effect of asciminib on dasatinib, nilotinib and imatinib was also mild with AUC increases 
up to +52%. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
The  objective  of  study  DMPK  R1400553  was  to  evaluate  the  contributions  of  individual  CYP  and  UGT 
enzymes to asciminib metabolism in human liver microsomes. In the kinetic analysis of individual CYP 
activity followed by scaling the individual contributions to asciminib hepatic intrinsic oxidative clearance, 
CYP3A4 was determined as a major contributor to the oxidative metabolism in human liver (~96.0%), 
followed by CYP2J2, CYP2C8, and CYP2D6. CYP4F12 contribution was assumed negligible due to its very 
low  intrinsic  clearance.  Chemical  inhibition  of  specific  UGT  enzymes  showed  that  UGT2B7  is  likely  to 
contribute  the  most  to  the  asciminib  direct  glucuronidation  in  human  liver  microsomes  (~57%),  with 
UGT1A3, UGT1A4, and UGT2B17 as minor contributors. 
Based  on  the  relative  contribution  of  the  oxidative  pathway  from  human  ADME  study  CABL001A2102 
and relative involvement of individual CYP enzymes from study DMPK R1400553, CYP3A4 was estimated 
to contribute 35.1% to the total clearance of asciminib in humans (study DMPK R1709012). Other CYP 
enzymes  were  estimated  to  contribute  to  a  minor  extent  (CYP2C8:  0.5%,  CYP2D6:  0.2%,  CYP2J2: 
0.76%). Using intrinsic clearance via each UGT enzyme involved calculated based on the data from study 
DMPK  R1300172  and  the  relative  contribution  of  glucuronidation  to  the  biotransformation  from  study 
CABL001A2102, contribution of UGT2B7 was determined as 27.9%. The contribution of UGT2B17 and 
Assessment report

UGT1A3/UGT1A4  to  asciminib  total  clearance  was  16.3  and  14.1%,  respectively  (study  DMPK 
R1709012). 
In vitro studies of asciminib potential to inhibit metabolic enzymes revealed Ki values in low micromolar 
range for CYP3A4/5, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and UGT1A1 (reversible inhibition in all cases as no time-
dependent inhibition was observed). 
In  in  vitro  studies,  asciminib  was  found  to  be  substrate  of  P-gp  and  BCRP,  but  not  of  MATE1,  OCT1, 
OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1. It was not investigated whether asciminib is a substrate of 
MATE2-K, OAT1 and OAT3 but this is acceptable given a low contribution of renal excretion to elimination 
of asciminib. 
In vitro studies revealed asciminib's potential to induce CYP3A4/5.  
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
In  contrast  to  ABL1  kinase  inhibitors  such  as  imatinib,  nilotinib  or  dasatinib that  bind  to  the  catalytic 
ATP-binding site, asciminib targets the autoregulatory allosteric myristoyl pocket present in ABL catalytic 
SH1 domain, which is specific for this family of kinases (ABL1 and ABL2). Asciminib can thus also bind 
in addition to an ATP-competitive TKI. Asciminib binds with high affinity of KD 0.5 nM and induces the 
formation of an inactive kinase formation. 
In a mouse xenograft model, a single asciminib dose of 7.5 mg/kg showed an IC90 for pSTAT-5 inhibition 
of 121 ng/mL (i.e. 7.3 nM for unbound concentration). At the T315I mutation asciminib showed an IC50 
of 7.64 nM for inhibition of proliferation of T315I-expressing cells compared to wt cells 0.61 nM. 
No studies were performed to assess PD or PK/PD of asciminib in healthy subjects. The PD of asciminib 
is evaluated based on a PD model of BCR-ABL1 %IS levels. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Triplicate 12-lead ECG readings were obtained from all patients with independent review. The data from 
Study X2101 were considered adequate to characterize the concentration-ECG relationship across doses 
ranging from 10 to 280 mg BID or 80 to 200 mg QD. 
The concentration-effect analysis demonstrated that the therapeutic dose of single agent asciminib did 
not have a clinically relevant effect on cardiac repolarization with an estimated mean increase of QTcF 
< 10 ms up to 10582 ng/mL, which is 2-fold the geo-mean Cmax at 200 mg BID These findings indicate 
a low proarrhythmic risk with asciminib as a single agent at 40 mg BID in CML patients without T315I 
mutation. 
AEs related to QT prolongation reported in both CML studies were mostly confounded by other factors 
including concurrent medical conditions, and concomitant medications but the additive role of asciminib 
cannot be fully excluded. As some asymptomatic QTc prolongations and AEs related to QTc prolongation 
were  observed,  caution  should  be  exercised  when  administering  asciminib  at  40  mg  BID  with  drugs 
known to cause Torsade de Pointes.

Exposure-response analyses 
The  analysis  included  303  patients  with  CML-CP  from  Study  A2301  and  Study  X2101.  267  patients 
received BID, 36 patients received QD dosing, including 67 subjects with T315I mutation. At baseline, 
majority of the subjects had >10% BCR-ABL1 IS >1% levels.  
The observed-data time-courses showed decreases in log10-transformed BCL-ABL for all dose regimens 
without an apparent dose-dependency. There was no gender-related difference in overall pattern in BCR-
ABL1 time course. 
Computed  median  predicted  MMR  rate  suggested  a  slightly  positive  exposure-efficacy  relationship, 
though not a meaningful difference with 34%, 35%, and 39% for 40 mg BID, 80 mg QD and 200 mg 
BID at 48 weeks, respectively. For 40 mg BID, MMR rates at the evaluated time-points were comparable 
for patients who had 2 and ≥3 prior TKI treatments, but MMR rates were lower compared to 1 prior TKI. 
Table 17 MMR rate at 24- and 48-week for 40 mg BID 
Source: ER report Table 4-8 
As regards the mutT315I subgroup, at doses <200 mg BID, most of these patients did not experience a 
decrease in BCR-ABL1 below -1 log10, or equivalently, 0.1% except those who had only one prior TKI 
treatment. MMR rates with 200 mg BID were 20.7% for 24 weeks and 23.7 % for 48 weeks. 
At baseline, mutations (other than T315I and V299L) were identified in 17 of 157 patients randomized 
to asciminib and newly emerging mutations were seen in 12 patients in the asciminib arm. Due to the 
limited  number  of  patients  with  each  of  the  detected  mutations,  and  the  variability  in  the  level  of 
response observed, a conclusive statement on the possible contribution of mutations to a lower efficacy 
cannot be made at time of week 96 analysis. 
The exposure-safety relationship was explored using various safety endpoints such as laboratory, vital 
signs abnormalities, fatigue/asthenia, TEAEs of grade 3 or higher, TEAE leading to dose reduction or 
dose interruption, changes in serum creatinine and QTcF change from baseline. For all safety endpoints 
analysed, there was a lack of clinical relevant difference in probability for a safety event with increase 
in the asciminib PK metrics within the investigated dose range.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology profile has been evaluated in healthy volunteers (single and multiple doses of 
40 mg, single 80 mg in mass balance) and patients with CML-CP without and with the T315I mutation 
between 10 to 200 mg BID and 80 to 200 mg QD as well as several models including IVIVC, popPK, 
PBPK and ER. 
The analytical methods were adequately described and validated and are considered suitable to analyse 
asciminib in human plasma. Also drug interference for the DDI studies was evaluated and acceptable.  
The  PBPK  model  applied  (Study  2001088)  was  based  mainly  on  40  mg  single  dose  data  and  a  small 
number of patients for 80 mg QD. was used to build the model. For a single dose of 40 mg in healthy 
subjects, the model predicted PK parameters within 26% of the observed values, which is considered 
appropriate. The PBPK model was also applied (Study 2001088) to predict DDI scenarios which has not 
been tested clinically for the doses of 80 and 200 mg. Furthermore, it was used to predict the effect of 
food, hepatic and renal impairment under these conditions. For multiple dosing in a wider dose range 
(20-200  mg)  including  80  mg  QD  the  PBPK  model  predicted  parameters  within  45%  of  the  observed 
values. The small number of patients for 80 mg QD is considered problematic and in addition to that 
over-proportional  exposure  with  dose  leads  to  further  uncertainties  in  prediction.  The  Applicant 
concluded that the developed PBPK model can be used to predict DDI scenarios for doses and regimens 
which  have  not  been  tested  clinically  and  for  predictions  regarding  food  effect  and  renal  or  hepatic 
impairment. However this was not considered acceptable. 
Absorption:  When  a  40  mg  FCT  dose  was  tested,  asciminib  HCl  formed  a  supersaturated  solution  in 
simulated gastric fluids. Still, for a supersaturated solution it might be expectable that precipitation could 
occur after drug intake if the dose, i.e. concentration, was increased. The applicant discussed that the 
excipient  hydroxypropyl  cellulose  acts  as  precipitation  inhibitor.  In  response  to  LOQ,  additional 
dissolution  data  were  obtained  and  used  to  update  the  IVIVC  model  and  these  data  supported  that 
asciminib precipitation at higher doses was minimal and absorption could be considered comparable at 
all doses. Asciminib is classified as BCS II with low solubility and moderate to high permeability, which 
can be agreed as the fraction absorbed is obviously above 85%, based on the mass balance study. In 
vitro, permeability in simulated gastric/intestinal fluids was reduced the higher the bile acid/bile salt/lipid 
content was. This was discussed by the applicant as resultant from sequestration of asciminib with bile 
acids. This is in accordance with reduced bioavailability in fed state, comparably with all formulations 
and independently of drug base or HCl salt. The food effect was more pronounced with high-fat with a 
reduction of exposure of about 65% compared to the low-fat state with ~30% decrease compared to 
fasted. Tmax was also delayed by 2 and 1 hours, respectively. Based on this, in both CML-patient studies 
the study drug was administered in fasted state, with at least 2 hours before and 1 hour after intake. In 
these studies patients received 40 mg BID, 12 hours apart. Considering these food requirements, BID 
dosing may become difficult for compliance. This was one reason for the applicant for applying also for 
a  not  approvable  80  mg  QD  regimen  in  addition  to  40  mg  BID  as  investigated  in  phase  III.  The 
information in the PI regarding intake with food is acceptable. 
Distribution: Asciminib shows a high PPB of 97.3% (unbound fraction 2.7%) and mostly binds to serum 
albumin, followed by HDL and VLDL, with lesser contributions from alpha1-glycoprotein and LDL. The 
blood-plasma ratio was about 0.58 for total radioactivity in the mass balance study. Vz was calculated 
with 46.5 L and 64.5 L for the central and peripheral compartments, reflecting moderate distribution to 
peripheral tissues. Distribution into CNS is not expected. 
Elimination: Mean total recovery of radioactivity in the mass balance study was >91%, which is sufficient 
for determination of the main elimination pathways in accordance with the requirements of the EMA DDI

GL. As AUC and Cmax are nearly dose-proportional, mass-balance data can be extrapolated from 80 mg 
to  40  mg  dose.  Main  elimination  route  is  hepatic  after  metabolism  and  about  31.1%  of  parent  are 
excreted biliary/intestinal via BCRP. Renal excretion of unchanged asciminib is only ~ 2.5%. Asciminib 
can be considered a low-extraction drug as the apparent clearance is lower than 20% the hepatic blood 
flow. With a half-life of 10.5-14 hours in HV asciminib BID dosing will result in higher accumulation as in 
QD  dosing.  Main  biotransformation  pathways  are  via  glucuronidation  and  oxidation.  The  2  non-
glucuronide  metabolites  of  asciminib  M29.5  and  M44  have  an  about  2-2.5-fold  lower  activity  than 
asciminib  and  their  plasma  concentrations  are  <2%  of  total  AUC.  Therefore,  their  contribution  to  a 
pharmacological effect can be considered negligible and their PK has not been further evaluated, which 
is acceptable. M30.5 is a direct glucuronide via UGT2B7 that is excreted biliary and was also the most 
abundant metabolite in urine (7.0%). Glucuronides excreted in bile are usually cleaved in GI tract, as 
was discussed by the applicant for M30.5. Based on non-clinical findings a potential for an enterohepatic 
circuit was questioned. Both the aspect of sequestration by bile acids and the large intestine environment 
which leads to low solubility of asciminib were discussed by the applicant and it can be agreed that a 
clinically relevant enterohepatic re-absorption is not expectable. UGT2B7 polymorphisms did not result 
in  clinically  relevant  exposure  difference.  Inter-conversion  via  biotransformation  processes  of  the 
therapeutic R-enantiomer to the S form has not been observed. 
PK in patients: PK for AUC and Cmax was over-proportional after twice daily dosing and nearly dose-
proportional after once daily dosing in CML patients. Trough concentrations increased with increasing 
dose and remained constant over the 24-week treating period. Steady-state had been reached at day 
15 of treatment, with an accumulation ratio of 1.65 for 40 mg BID, which could be expected based on 
T1/2 of >10 hours. No time-dependency was observed. Asciminib showed a moderate inter-subject 
variability with ~43-50% for AUC and Cmax at both proposed BID and QD dosing regimens. The intra-
individual variability in HV was low with approximately 6-29% for AUC and Cmax. PK data for smallest 
patient groups, especially 280mg BID were only presented as listing. Upon request the applicant 
tabulated primary and secondary PK parameters for all doses investigated in dose-finding study X2101. 
PK was slightly over-proportional at the dose range tested from 10mg BID to 120mg BID. CL/F in 
steady-state at the proposed dose regimens was (geo-mean) 7.6 L/hr at 40mg BID. MTD was not 
achieved in Study X2101, suggesting a large therapeutic window of asciminib. Based on the available 
safety, efficacy and PK data the applicant decided for the asciminib dose of 40 mg BID as the 
recommended Phase III dose. 
Special populations 
In the renal impairment study with a single 40 mg dose, subjects with severe renal impairment compared 
to  normal  renal  function  subjects  had  56%  higher  AUCinf  and  49%  higher  AUClast  and  a  36%  lower 
CL/F.  In  the  popPK  analysis,  renal  function  was  found  to  be  a  statistically  significant  covariate  on 
clearance.  The  applicant  argues  that  this  effect  is  clinically  not  relevant  and  no  dose  adjustment  for 
subjects  with  renal  impairment  is  needed.  However,  safety  data  suggest  a  worse  safety  profile  for 
patients with moderate renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function or mild renal 
impairment.  
As the effect of renal impairment could be underestimated for the 40 mg BID posology, the PopPK model 
was  further  used  to  evaluate  whether  renal  impairment  was  impacting  asciminib  PK  behaviour  by 
external validation and testing renal function as a categorical covariate (i.e., normal vs severe) on CL 
and V1. It was concluded that the current PopPK model is suitable for application in patients with severe 
renal impairment. No further significant co-variate effect was found than the aGFR. The median predicted 
AUC0-24 and Cmax for severely impaired patients are 40% higher than that of a typical individual with 
normal renal function, for a dose of 40 mg b.i.d. Given the relatively flat exposure-safety relationship 
over a 5-fold difference in exposure it could therefore be agreed that no dose adjustment is needed for 
subjects with renal impairment, including severe renal impairment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 56/128 
 
 
 
For  subjects  with  mild  liver  impairment  (Child-Pugh  A)  AUC  and  Cmax  were  approximately  21-26% 
increased,  whereas  moderate  cirrhosis  (CP-B)  had  only  minor  effects  (1.7-3%  increase).  In  both 
categories elimination T1/2 and clearance were unchanged compared to normal. In the severe cirrhosis 
group  (CP-C),  after  a  single  dose  of  asciminib  AUCinf  was  66%  and  Cmax  29%  higher  with  reduced 
clearance and prolonged T1/2 (17.5 hours, max >23 h) showing that especially the elimination phase is 
impaired  by  CP-C  liver  disease.  The  PopPK  derived  steady-state  AUC0-24h  for  subjects  with  severe 
hepatic  impairment  for  40  mg  b.i.d.  were  only  slightly  higher  than  in  patients  with  CML  with  normal 
hepatic function. 
Similar to the discussion for RI in view of the much higher doses which did not result in major toxicities 
and no MTD, there might be a sufficiently broad therapeutic window in general, to accept that a dose 
reduction is not warranted for any grade of HI.  
To address the concern of over- and underprediction of the PBPK model new sensitivity analysis on the 
percentage  of  re-absorption  and  additional  exploratory  PBPK  simulations  were  performed.  A  model 
assuming no re-absorption via enterohepatic circulation described the observed data with least deviation.  
As regards to other special population groups, no apparent difference in PK was observed for gender, 
race and ethnicity or weight. As asciminib is a low-extraction drug, no impact on total clearance due to 
reduced blood flow in elderly is immediately expected. No dose adjustment is necessary in these groups 
based on current knowledge. The PI is adequate in this respect.  
Drug interactions – in vitro 
CYP3A4 appeared to be the major contributor to Phase I metabolism and responsible for 35.1% of total 
metabolic clearance of asciminib in humans (as calculated based on in vitro and human ADME data). The 
relative contribution of UGT2B7, UGT2B17 and UGT1A3/4 was estimated as 27.9%, 16.3% and 14.1% 
of the total metabolism, respectively. 
In vitro studies of asciminib potential to inhibit metabolic enzymes revealed Ki values in low micromolar 
range for CYP3A4/5, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and UGT1A1 (reversible inhibition in all cases as no time-
dependent inhibition was observed).  
According to the basic model, in vivo studies to assess the impact of inhibition of the aforementioned 
enzymes by asciminib on metabolism of the relevant substrates would be warranted. The applicant has 
provided a DDI risk assessment using the mechanistic static model. According to the latter, only in vivo 
studies  with  CYP3A4,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9  and  UGT1A1  were  deemed  necessary  for  80  mg  QD, 
which was taken as “the-worst-case scenario”. This is acceptable. In vivo effects were investigated for 
all these enzymes except UGT1A1. The applicant found no apparent increase in blood concentration of 
bilirubin,  an  endogenous  substrate  of  UGT1A,  in  the  clinical  studies  A2301  and  X2101  and  concluded 
that  there  was  no  relevant  UGT1A1  inhibition  by  asciminib  at  doses  of  40  mg  BID  and  200  mg  BID 
(X2101 only). This was further supported by PopPK analysis that showed a lack of correlation between 
the  probability  of  grade ≥2  increase  in  total  bilirubin  and  any  PK  metrics  analysed  (daily  AUC,  Cmax, 
Cmin). It is agreed that the absence of an in vivo study with UGT1A1 is justified.  
In  in  vitro  studies,  asciminib  was  found  to  be  substrate  of  P-gp  and  BCRP,  but  not  of  MATE1,  OCT1, 
OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1. It was not investigated whether asciminib is a substrate of 
MATE2-K, OAT1 and OAT3 but this is acceptable given a low contribution of renal excretion to elimination 
of asciminib.  
Asciminib was found to inhibit BCRP, P-gp, MATE2-K, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1 in vitro to 
an extent warranting in vivo studies. The ratio of unbound portal vein concentration for asciminib 40 mg 
b.i.d. to Ki,u value for OCT1 was 0.035. The respective values for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 are 0.10 and 
0.13 (80 mg q.d.). No exposure increase was observed for the OATP substrate repaglinide in study A2106 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 57/128 
 
 
 
(geometric mean AUCinf ratio: 1.08), therefore, the OATP inhibition is considered unlikely. This is agreed. 
The ratio of unbound plasma concentration for asciminib 80 mg q.d. to Ki,u values for OAT3 and MATE2-
K are 0.11 and 0.05, respectively. As these transporters are renal transporters and the contribution of 
the renal route to asciminib elimination is low, in vivo studies on DDI due to interference with MATE2-K 
and OAT3 can be waived. 
In vitro studies revealed asciminib's potential to induce CYP3A4/5. As CYP3A4/5 induction is mediated 
by  the  pregnane  X  receptor  (PXR),  P-gp  and  OATP1B1  may  also  be  induced.  In  line  with  the  EMA 
Guideline on the investigation of drug interactions, in vitro induction studies of PgP and/or OATP1B1 in 
hepatocytes should be performed and the applicant committed to perform such in vitro studies as a post-
authorisation measure (PAM). 
In vivo – as victim 
The PPI study suggested minor effect on rate and extent of asciminib absorption with increased pH by 
rabeprazole. Therefore, compared with the normal fasting gastric conditions, drug dissolution at higher 
gastric pH conditions should not be the rate limiting step for drug absorption. The SmPC does not state 
anything about pH affecting substances which is appropriate based on the minor effects.  
For the controversial itraconazole results in A2107 the applicant provided the following discussions in the 
SCP: “Further investigations of this unexpected result suggested that the most plausible explanation was 
a  pre-systemic  effect,  potentially  a  complex  formation  with  hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin,  an 
excipient in the itraconazole solution used (hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin concentration was 40 times 
the concentration of itraconazole in the oral solution [8 g cyclodextrin per 200 mg itraconazole dose]). 
It has been hypothesized that hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin could have sequestered asciminib and 
therefore decreased the free asciminib concentration available for absorption in the gut.”  
SmPC section 5.2 provides information about the itraconazole oral solution, i.e. cyclodextrin DDI. Several 
other drugs and especially food contain cyclodextrin e.g. as emulsifying excipient. This DDI could thus 
also occur with other drugs or food and drinks containing cyclodextrin or other sequestering/trapping 
substances. The applicant is currently performing further in vitro tests with different cyclodextrins and 
committed to submit results as a PAM. 
Asciminib exposure was only mildly affected by concomitantly administered drugs that are strong CYP3A 
inducers (rifampicin) or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (itraconazole, clarithromycin). Although CYP3A4 is the 
main metabolising enzyme, this pathway was considered to only contribute to overall 36% to hepatic 
elimination – in addition to UGT-mediated glucuronidation and biliary secretion.  
Smoking (UGT induction) did not relevantly affect asciminib PK based on the patient studies. 
In  the  dedicated  DDI  study  E2101  in  HV,  asciminib  AUC  was  calculated  as  about  doubled  under  co-
administration with imatinib (inhibitor of CYP3A4, P-gp, UGT1A3/4, UGT2B17 and BCRP) with a low-fat 
meal, Tmax was delayed and clearance was 5.19 L/h. In this DDI arm, clearance for asciminib alone was 
11.1 L/h, as compared to values in other HV single-dose studies of ~4.1-7 L/h. Taking into consideration 
that the same study (arm 2) evaluated the food effect of a single-dose of 40 mg asciminib and a low-fat 
meal was  found to reduce exposure by 30%, delay  Tmax by about 1 hour and increase clearance by 
40% (from 6.86 L/hr to 9.7 L/hr), the SD asciminib PK parameters with imatinib under low-fat conditions 
were quite similar to the low-fat conditions only.  
The applicant clarified the magnitude of sole imatinib-mediated DDI effect, i.e. excluding the food-effect, 
as perpetrator and victim by PBPK simulations which did not reveal any clinically relevant differences to 
the observed study results. This is reassuring. 
With  nilotinib  (moderate  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4,  UGT2B17  and  UGT1A3/4,  BCRP)  in  fasted  state 
accumulation increased up to about 2-fold as without perpetrator. PBPK modelling estimated a roughly 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 58/128 
 
 
 
comparable distribution of pathway involvement in asciminib hepatic clearance, so it could be supported 
that each inhibition was only mild. Dasatinib (CYP3A4 inhibitor) effects in fasted state were minor only.  
Regarding rifampicin, which is also an UGT1A inducer, the combined induction effect only led to a 15% 
decrease in exposure, with shorter half-life and a higher clearance, supporting that either pathway, CYP- 
and UGT-mediated, is only mildly affected.  
Asciminib  absorption  and  elimination  was  only  minimally  affected  by  P-gp  inhibitor  quinidine. 
Accordingly, P-gp inhibitors can be co-administered at all recommended doses without restrictions. The 
SmPC does not state anything about P-gp DDI which is appropriate based on the minor effects. 
BCRP was considered by the applicant to be saturated at intestinal concentrations, so that a contribution 
to efflux was deemed irrelevant; regarding liver efflux, the applicant discussed that in the PBPK model 
inclusion of BCRP improved prediction and explained that due to the lowest Km (intracellular 0.14µM) it 
would be saturated first, with a fractional contribution of ~31%. Based on this, no clinical DDI study was 
performed. This can be accepted. 
In vivo – as perpetrator 
In  the  clinical  perpetrator  DDI  study  asciminib  was  a  mild  inhibitor  (i.e.  AUC  increase  1.25-2-fold  or 
clearance ≤ 50% decrease) of CYP3A4 (midazolam) and CYP2C9 (warfarin). It had no clinically relevant 
effect on CYP2C8 (repaglinide; also a substrate of OATP1B1/3) at 3 days of 40mg BID. According to the 
static model it was the 80 mg single dose that would have an effect on CYP2C8, but not the 40mg dose. 
The applicant satisfactorily justified that 40 mg BID for 3 days was sufficient to study the DDI.   
In CML patients, dasatinib, imatinib (3A4 substrates) and nilotinib (3A4 and 2C8 substrate) were only 
mildly affected by co-administration of various doses of asciminib; however, a conclusive assessment of 
those DDI data is hampered by the very small patient numbers. 
Transporter  inhibition  for  UGT1A1  was  not  evaluated  in  a  dedicated  DDI  study.  In  the  SmCP  it  was 
discussed:  “In  the  clinical  studies  A2301  and  X2101,  no  apparent  increase  of  bilirubin  blood 
concentration, an endogenous substrate of UGT1A1, has been observed, indicating that there was no 
relevant UGT1A1 inhibition by asciminib at doses of 40 mg BID and 200 mg BID (X2101 only). This was 
further supported by PopPK analysis that showed a lack of correlation between the probability of grade 
≥2 increase in total bilirubin and any PK metrics analysed (daily AUC, Cmax, Cmin).” This is acceptable.  
For  OATP1B1/3,  repaglinide  was  only  mildly  affected.  For  BCRP  and  OATPs  a  risk  assessment  with 
rosuvastatin was performed by M&S and estimated only low DDI potential also with 80 mg. 
Based on the results of RIS assessment, the CYP3A4 induction effect can be considered negligible. At 
both doses, the resulting net effect is a weak CYP3A4 inhibition. 
Overall, none of the clinically investigated or modelled DDI, both for asciminib as victim or perpetrator, 
at the proposed doses 40 mg BID and 80 mg QD revealed a strong effect. Only for some simulation a 
moderate effect was observed.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Asciminib is an allosteric high-affinity inhibitor of BCR-ABL1 kinase. It does not bind to the catalytic ATP-
binding pocket where also the resistance-promoting acquired T315I mutation is located. 
A Proof-of-concept study was not performed. Final RP3D selection of 40 mg BID was obviously not based 
on clear clinical PD effects, but based on ER assumptions considering preclinical experiments and popPK 
simulations from the phase I study X2101 in CML-patients. 
ER analyses for efficacy were utilised to retrospectively evaluate a potential relationship of reduction of 
BCR-ABL1 IS  with dose from the CML study data, both for non-T315I-mutated BCR-ABL1 and T315I-
Assessment report

mutated). No significant dose-/exposure-response effect was observed between 10 mg BID and 200 mg 
BID asciminib. However, some differences for number of TKI-pretreatment lines and BCR-ABL1 baseline 
levels  were  seen:  the  less  prior  lines  and  the lower the  baseline level the higher  the  MMR  rate  at  24 
weeks and 48 weeks.  
Considering the allosteric inhibition mechanism and the unbound Cmin above IC90 for pSTAT-5 inhibition 
for dose regimens at least above 80 mg QD, potential reasons for an absent (observed and simulated) 
clinically relevant ER effect were justified by the applicant with a near efficacy plateau that might have 
already been reached at the lowest dose tested.  
The applicant was asked to clarify whether (secondary) mutations under treatment have been detected 
and  investigated  in  accordance  with  the  objectives  of  study  A2301  and  whether  they  led  to  reduced 
efficacy. From the data at the week 96 analysis no specific pattern of reduced or lack of efficacy could 
be  derived,  not  only  because  of  small  patient  numbers  but  also  due  to  contrasting  responses  for  the 
same mutation (e.g. for M244V or Y253H mutations). 
The safety ER analyses revealed a lack of clinically relevant differences in exposure-response for various 
safety parameters between doses of 40 mg BID, 80 mg QD and 200 mg BID. The various tabulations 
from the linear mixed effects models or logistic regressions were impossible to summarise. Considering 
the proportion of patients having observed AEs with the different doses up to 200mg BID, as discussed 
during  the  presubmission  meeting  for  thrombocytopenia,  there  seems  a  low  exposure-response 
relationship for safety. 
Overall, based on the data from study X2101, the risk for QTcF prolongation above the clinically relevant 
threshold of 10msec is low at both proposed dose regimens. The SmPC and PL contain, though, a warning 
that caution should be exercised when concomitant drugs known to cause Torsade de Pointes are given.  
Exposure-response was also evaluated for in T315I-mutated BCL-ABL. In general, asciminib showed a 
PD effect also in this group, though at much higher doses and still a lower effect than in non-mutated 
CML-CP patients. For comparison, the in vitro IC50 for T315I was ~10-fold higher than for wild-type and 
the obtained Cmin with 200 mg BID was comparably so (2799 ng/ml vs. ~200ng/ml for 80mg QD). Data 
can still be considered supportive in so far that an ATP-binding pocket T315I-resistance might obviously 
be partially overcome by an inhibition of the allosteric binding site as with asciminib. 
Despite the genotyping for PK from A2301, biomarker data that were collected for exploratory endpoints 
will be evaluated after end of study. For this, a post-approval commitment is expected (PAM-REC). The 
applicant  also  explained  that  exploratory  biomarker  analyses  for  asciminib  in  combination  with  other 
TKIs, with exception of BCR::ABL mutation analysis was removed from the protocol of study X2101 due 
to technical infeasibility.  
Clinical data regarding genetic impact on PD response is limited to the T315I mutation, these data are 
discussed in the efficacy section. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
It is concluded that asciminib pharmacokinetics are overall well investigated.  
For special populations with severe renal or hepatic impairment based on the current data it is concluded 
that no dose adjustment is needed. The DDI potential is overall only mild in magnitude. Similarly, PD is 
mostly satisfactorily evaluated. A few open aspects will be addressed by the applicant as PAMs. 
In the Phase III Study A2301, asciminib 40 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) posology was further evaluated based 
on based on preclinical evidence, the results of the PopPK-exposure analysis and the pharmacokinetic, 
efficacy  and  safety  data  available  from  the  first  in-human  study  phase  1  trial  X2101.  The  applicant 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 60/128 
 
 
 
proposed in the SmPC a recommended total daily dose of asciminib for adult patients with Ph+ CML-CP 
previously treated with 2 or more tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of 80 mg to be taken orally either as 80 
mg  once  daily  (q.d.)  or  as  40  mg  twice  daily  (b.i.d.).  In  view  of  CHMP,  the  80  mg  once  daily  (q.d.) 
posology was to be removed throughout the SmPC because: 
-  Non-compartmental  analysis  at  steady-state  showed  that  the  main  PK  parameters  were  not 
comparable:  Cycle  1  d15:  80mg  QD  vs.  40mg  BID  AUC0-24hr  1.74  (90%  CI  1.36-2.22),  Cmax  2.33 
(90% CI 1.81-3.00), Cmin 0.83 (90% CI 0.62-1.12); 
- The 80 mg once daily (q.d.) posology was investigated in a limited number of patients only (n=17) and 
the exposure-response modelling is not sufficiently robust for decision-making; 
- The risks for the 80 mg once daily (q.d.) posology are not sufficiently characterized, in particular for 
special populations or DDI, mostly investigated with 40 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) posology.  
More data will be provided post-approval from the ongoing trial A2302, which compares the outcome 
of both posologies. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Asciminib  (ABL001)  is  an  inhibitor  that  targets  the  myristoyl  pocket  of  BCR-ABL1,  in  contrast  to  the 
currently available TKIs that target the BCR-ABL1 ATP binding site. By virtue of asciminib not interacting 
with the ATP-binding site, asciminib maintains activity against cells expressing clinically observed ATP-
binding TKI resistant mutations. Therefore, approval in adult patients for the treatment of Philadelphia 
chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) previously treated with 
two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors is applied.  
Efficacy  claim  for  the  applied  indication  “treatment  of  adult  patients  with  Philadelphia  chromosome-
positive chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) previously treated with two or more 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors” is based on the results of the primary analysis of the pivotal Phase III study 
[CABL001A2301] (ASCEMBL, hereafter referred to as Study A2301) (corresponding to a data cut-off 
date of 25-May-2020, current efficacy cut off-date: 96 weeks -06-Oct 2021).  
Supportive evidence from the first phase 1 trial in patients [CABL001X2101] (hereafter referred 
to as Study X2101; corresponding to a data cut-off date of 02-Apr-2020) is available. However, since 
the primary endpoint of trial X2101 was the incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first 
cycle of study treatment, the main focus of this data is clearly safety (evaluation of MTD and safety and 
tolerability of asciminib) and information regarding efficacy remains secondary.  
No  combined  efficacy  analyses  could  be  performed  for  studies  A2301  and  X2101  as  intra-
patient dose escalation was allowed in Study X2101. 
The design of Study A2301 including the comparator arm was discussed with EMA before study initiation. 
The applicant confirmed that both studies, trial A2301 and X2101, were conducted in full compliance 
with Good Clinical Practice and were closely monitored by the sponsor for compliance with the protocol 
and its procedures described therein. 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Selection of the asciminib 40 mg BID dosing schedule was based on preclinical evidence, the results of 
the  PopPK-exposure  Analysis  [RD-2019-00440],  [RD-2013-50145],  [PopPK  Report]  and  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 61/128 
 
 
 
 
pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety data available from the first in-human study phase 1 trial X2101. 
In this study patients with CML-CP who had prior treatment with at least 2 prior TKIs, received treatment 
with increasing doses of oral asciminib monotherapy between 10 mg to 200 mg on a continuous BID 
schedule). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for asciminib monotherapy in patients with CML-CP was 
not achieved; based on the totality of available data the 40 mg BID dose was selected as recommended 
Phase II dose (RP2D). 
Nevertheless, increased toxicity was observed at doses ≥ 80 mg BID (pancreatitis) as well as a trend for 
higher rates of discontinuation due to AE, dose limiting toxicity (DLT), and grade 3/4 AE with increasing 
doses above this limit.  
Simulations  performed  using  asciminib  population  PK-PD  model  predicted  that  the  probability  of 
achieving BCR-ABL1 mRNA ≥ 1 log reduction at 6 and 12 months was higher with 40 mg BID compared 
to  20  mg  BID.  Moreover,  estimates  from  Study  X2101  were  found  to  be  above  the  threshold  trough 
concentration  required  for  90%  inhibition  of  pSTAT5  derived  from  a  preclinical  PK-PD  KCL-22  mouse 
xenograft  model  (free  IC90:  30  to121  ng/mL,  after correction  for protein  binding)  and  in  vitro gIC50 
assessed in the KCL-22 cell line (1 ng/mL = 2.1 nM after correction for protein binding). 
The  applicant  thus,  decided  to  select  the  asciminib  40  mg  BID  posology  for  further  evaluation  in  the 
Phase  III  Study  A2301.  From  the  results  of  Study  A2301  this  dose  is  now  applied  for  the  target 
population.

A Phase III, multi-center, open-label, randomized study of oral ABL001 
(asciminib) versus bosutinib in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic 
phase (CML-CP), previously treated with 2 or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 
EudraCT number 2016-002461-66 
Study initiation date: 26-Oct-2017 (first patient first visit) 
Data cut-off date: 25-May-2020 (primary endpoint completion date, study is ongoing) 
Updated data including longer follow-up data from week 96 cut-off date of 06-Oct-2021, were 
submitted after the initial submission during the procedure and reflect the current outcome for this 
report. 
Methods 
•  Study Participants  
Male or female ≥ 18 years of age with a diagnosis of CMLCP, who had received prior treatment with 2 
or more ATP binding site TKIs (i.e. imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, radotinib or ponatinib), and were 
treatment failure (as per guidelines adapted from the 2013 ELN recommendations) or intolerant to the 
most recent TKI. As bosutinib has no activity against BCRABL1 T315I and V299L mutations, patients 
who had T315I or V299L mutations documented in their medical records were not eligible for this 
study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 62/128 
 
 
 
 
 
For patients intolerant to the most recent TKI therapy, the threshold for BCR-ABL1 ratio was reduced 
from ≥ 1 to >0.1% by Amendment 3 to the protocol, in order to ensure that the CML third line patient 
population is adequately represented. No more than 66 patients (approximately 30% of the overall 
study population) that were intolerant to their most recent TKI therapy with BCR-ABL1 <1% were to 
be recruited to ensure that the CML third line patient population is adequately represented. 
Exclusion criteria were adequately defined in order to ensure homogeneity of the included population 
and to avoid imbalance of intrinsic or extrinsic risks between both arms. Exclusion of subjects with 
well-known specific treatment risks (T315I or V299L mutation, second chronic phase of CML after 
previous progression to AP/BC or previous/planned hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation) is deemed 
acceptable for this trial. 
No issue of concern was identified regarding the selected study population from the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. 
•  Treatments 
Asciminib and bosutinib were administered as tablets to be taken orally in accordance with a 40 mg BID 
and 500 mg QD dosing regimen, respectively. Asciminib was to be taken in fasted state; food was to be 
avoided for at least 2 hours before the dose and for at least 1 hour after the dose (water was permitted); 
whereas bosutinib was to be taken in fed state. 
Dose escalation beyond the standard doses of 40 mg BID for asciminib was not permitted. For bosutinib, 
dose escalation to 600 mg QD was permitted according the approved posology. Similarly, the approach 
for dose reduction/interruption is adequately defined in the study protocol. For asciminib, only 1-step 
dose  reduction  to  total  daily  dose  of  40  mg  was  allowed,  and  for  bosutinib  2-step  sequential  dose 
reduction up to total daily dose of 300 mg was allowed. 
Adequate methods for compliance control were addressed in the protocol and established in the study 
conduct. 
Duration  of  treatment  is  planned  as  up  to  the  EOsT  defined  as  up  to  96  weeks  after  the  last  patient 
received  the  first  dose  or  up  to  48  weeks  after  the  last  patient  had  switched  to  asciminib  treatment 
(whichever was longer, unless patients had discontinued study treatment earlier). 
The applicant justifies the decision to choose Bosutinib as comparator because, in contrast to dasatinib 
and nilotinib, it was specifically evaluated in patients R/I ≥ 2 prior TKIs, and the dose of 500 mg q.d. was 
selected as it is the approved dose for ≥ 2 lines (2L) of therapy in CML (Khoury et al 2012). Ponatinib 
was not selected as the comparator in Study A2301, because ponatinib’s dose was being evaluated in a 
randomized study as a post-approval commitment due to the occurrence of arterial occlusive events at 
the approved dose of ponatinib (45 mg q.d.) at the time when the Study A2301 started (Cortes et al 
2020). 
The  open-label  conduct  of  the  study  is  justified  as,  in  addition  to  differences  in  dose  adaptations, 
conditions for drug administration differ markedly for ABL001 and bosutinib (ABL001 needs to be taken 
in a fasted state, bosutinib should be taken with food), making blinding with double-dummy treatment 
complex and carrying the inherent risk of administration and dosing errors. This justification is accepted 
in principle; in particular, since an open label design was also used in the pivotal trials for other second 
or third generation TKIs in CML. 
Concomitant treatment: The use of any concomitant medication/therapies deemed necessary for the 
supportive care of the patient were permitted; except as specifically prohibited due to potential PK or 
metabolic interaction with the products. 
•  Objectives 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 63/128 
 
 
 
The primary clinical question of interest is: Is the efficacy of asciminib (40 mg bid) superior to bosutinib 
(500  mg  qd)  in  CML  patients  in  chronic  phase,  previously  treated  with  2  or  more  tyrosine  kinase 
inhibitors, with regards to achieving MMR at 24 weeks while on study treatment and without meeting 
any treatment failure criteria (defined in section 5.4.4) prior to 24 weeks, regardless of dose modification, 
dose interruption, or deviation in any intake of concomitant medications. (Superiority in efficacy of 
asciminib over bosutinib in the target population) 
In consequence, the null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the treatment groups with 
respect to MMR rate at 24 weeks.  
The primary estimand is described by the following attributes: 
• 
• 
Population:  CML  patients  in  CP,  previously  treated  with  2  or  more  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors. 
Further details about the population are provided by in/exclusion criteria. 
Endpoint: MMR achieved at 24 weeks while on study treatment without meeting any treatment 
failure criteria (see below treatment failure criteria) prior to 24 weeks. A patient was counted as 
having achieved MMR at 24 weeks if he/she met the MMR criterion (BCR-ABL1 ratio ≤ 0.1%) at 
24 weeks while on study treatment unless the patient met any treatment failure criteria prior to 
24 weeks. 
• 
Intercurrent events: 
o  Treatment discontinuation (i.e. having performed an EOT visit) prior to 24 weeks due to 
any reason (e.g. intolerance, treatment failure, death, etc.): non response 
o  Meeting any treatment failure criteria prior to 24 weeks: non response 
o  Dose  modification:  dose  interruption,  or  deviation  in  any  intake  of  concomitant 
medications: ignore (treatment policy strategy) 
• 
Treatment of interest: the randomized treatment (the investigational treatment asciminib or the 
control treatment bosutinib) received for at least 24 weeks with or without dose modification, 
dose interruption or deviation in any intake of concomitant medications. 
•  Handling of remaining intercurrent events : no other intercurrent events foreseen 
• 
The  summary  measure:  difference  in  MMR  rate  and  its  95%  confidence  interval  at  week  24 
between the two treatment arms

compared to 15%. To test the null hypothesis that the MMR rate at 24 weeks is equal in the two 
treatment arms, based on two-sided 5% level of significance and with 90% power, 222 patients were 
needed in total based on 2:1 randomization allocation. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Patients were assigned to  asciminib or bosutinib in a ratio of 2:1. Randomization was stratified by 
cytogenetic response status at screening (MCyR or no MCyR). In this study, an open-label study design 
was considered appropriate, due to inherent difference in the conditions for drug administration for the 
two treatment arms and use of objective efficacy endpoints. 
•  Statistical methods 
The statistical analysis plan was finalized prior to the conduct of the primary analysis and unblinding of 
the database.  
The  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS)  comprised  of  all  randomized  patients.  According  to  the  intent  to  treat 
principle,  patients  were  analyzed  according  to  the  treatment  and  stratum  that  were  assigned  at 
randomization.  Unless  otherwise  stated,  the  FAS  was  used  for  the  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy 
endpoint and all other secondary efficacy endpoints. 
The null hypothesis was that there is no difference between the treatment groups with respect to MMR 
rate at 24 weeks. The Cochrane-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) chi-square test, stratified by the randomization 
stratification factor (MCyR vs no MCyR at screening), was used to compare MMR rate between the two 
treatment groups, at the two-sided 5% level of significance. Patients with missing PCR evaluations at 24 
weeks were considered as non-responders. 
The  95%  CI  for  the  difference  in  MMR  rate  between  treatment  groups  was  provided  using  the  Wald 
method. In addition, the common risk difference and corresponding 95% CI were provided by using the 
Mantel-Haenszel method. 
The analysis of the key secondary endpoint (MMR at week 96 while on study treatment without meeting 
any treatment failure criteria prior to 96 weeks) will be performed at 96-week analysis time point, which 
was not reached prior to submission. 
No  confirmatory  statistical  testing  of  non-key  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  was  performed;  however, 
nominal p-values were presented. 
MMR and CCyR rate at and by time points were analysed using the same methods as for the primary 
endpoint.  
Time to event endpoint were generally analysed and graphically displayed using the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) 
approach. 
TTF  was  compared  between  the  two  treatment  groups  using  stratified  log-rank  test  stratified  by  the 
randomization strata. The hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals were computed from a stratified 
Cox model. The same methods will be applied for PFS and OS, which were not mature yet. 
In  addition  to  the  primary  efficacy  analysis,  various  supplementary  and  sensitivity  analyses  were 
performed to assess the overall robustness of the primary efficacy results. 
Efficacy analyses in subgroups were exploratory and intended to investigate the consistency of 
treatment effect.

•  Participant flow 
•  Recruitment 
Study initiation date: 26-Oct-2017 (first patient first visit). 
Data cut-off date at submission: 25-May-2020 (primary endpoint completion date, study is ongoing). 
Current cut-off date: 06-Oct-2021 (week 96 assessment). 
•  Conduct of the study 
Three  amendments  were  performed  during  the  study  conduct.  In  Amendment  3  a  change  was 
implemented  which  allows  patients  in  the  bosutinib  arm  into  the  asciminib  arm  according  predefined 
conditions. The changes implemented are not likely to have impaired the integrity of trial A2301 in a 
relevant manner, which would allow presuming a decreased reliability of efficacy and safety outcome. 
Protocol deviations were reported in 66.1% of patients; the proportion of patients with protocol deviation 
was higher in the asciminib arm (70.7%) compared to the bosutinib arm (56.6%). This may be explained 
at  least  partially  by  a  longer  duration  of  treatment  exposure  in  patients  randomized  to  asciminib 
compared to bosutinib (median 43.36 weeks vs. 29.21 weeks) and mainly caused to higher frequencies 
of  deviations  in  the  ‘Other  deviation’  category  in  the  asciminib  arm  (57.3%)  vs.  in  the bosutinib  arm 
(38.2%). Protocol deviations, specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, may have contributed also. They were 
reported  in  61  patients  (26.2%)  with  no  significant imbalance  between  the  two  treatment  arms  (e.g. 
visit done outside of study site, change in drug supply method and change in assessment/procedure). 
However, the assessment revealed a relevant difference of about 5 % more deviations in the asciminib 
arm with respect to not met inclusion and exclusion criteria. However, further assessment clarified that 
this issue is unlikely to have biased the outcome.  
Stratification to the wrong stratum (15.3% vs. 13.2%) based on the sensitivity analysis this deviation 
did not have an impact on the primary analysis. 
•  Baseline data 
Overall, the median age of patients in the study was 52 years (range: 19-83), 18.9% patients were ≥ 65 
years and 2.6% patients were ≥ 75 years. 51.5% patients were female and 48.5% patients were male. 
A majority of the patients were White (74.7%), with 14.2% being Asian, and 4.3% being Black or African 
American. Almost all patients (98.7%) had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1  
Considering the progress in CML treatment during the last twenty years and the hereby resulting intrinsic 
feasibility difficulties in the applied late line population, the two treatment arms can be seen as overall

balanced for the demographic characteristics. Differences noted were primary regarding ethnicity and 
sex. Patients in the asciminib arm (9.6%) compared fewer Hispanic/Latino to the bosutinib arm (22.4%). 
Similarly,  the  proportion  of  males  was  slightly  higher  in  the  asciminib  arm  (52.2%)  compared  to  the 
bosutinib arm (40.8%). 
Overall the included patients were heavily pre-treated, with approximately half of the patients 
receiving study treatment as 3rd-line therapy.  
•  Numbers analysed 
233 patients with CML-CP were enrolled into the ITT analysis of this study, of whom 157 patients were 
randomized to treatment with asciminib and 76 patients to treatment with bosutinib (2:1). 
As of the initial 25-May-2020 data cut-off, 119 patients (51.1%) continued to receive treatment. Twice 
the  proportion  of  patients  were  ongoing  in  the  asciminib  arm  (61.8%)  relative  to  the  bosutinib  arm 
(28.9%). Overall, discontinuations in both treatment arms were predominantly due to lack of efficacy, 
followed by AEs and physician decision, although all were less frequent in the asciminib arm relative to 
the bosutinib arm (lack of efficacy: 21.0% vs. 31.6%; AE(s): 5.1% vs. 21.1%; physician decision: 6.4% 
vs. 7.9%). The majority of discontinuations before Week 24 were related to AEs while after Week 24, 
discontinuations were mainly due to lack of efficacy (Table below).

•  Twenty-two patients randomized to bosutinib switched to asciminib treatment after meeting 
lack of efficacy criteria as per protocol. 
As of the Week 96 cut-off (06-Oct-2021), 99 of the 233 patients (42.5%) were continuing the 
study treatment with 84 patients (53.5%) and 15 patients (19.7%) still ongoing in the asciminib 
and bosutinib arms, respectively. Compared with the Week 24 cut-off (25-May-2020), 13 
additional patients discontinued study treatment in the asciminib arm (5 patients discontinued 
due to lack of efficacy, 4 due to PI decision, 3 due to AE, and one due to patient/guardian 
decision), and 7 additional patients discontinued treatment in the bosutinib arm (3 patients 
discontinued due to lack of efficacy, 3 due to AE, and one due to patient/guardian decision). 
•  Outcomes and estimation 
With respect to MMR: 
Primary endpoint: Major molecular response (MMR) rate at 24 weeks 
The MMR rate at 24 weeks was 25.5% in the asciminib arm compared to 13.2% in the bosutinib 
arm.  
The treatment difference in the MMR rate was both statistically significant, 12.2% (95% CI: 2.19, 22.30, 
two-sided  p-value:  0.029)  (per  the  Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel  two-sided  test,  stratified  by  the  MCyR 
status at baseline). A clinically relevant two-fold increase in the MMR rate at 24 weeks was observed 
between the two treatment arms (Table below).

Subjects without PCR assessment at 96 weeks were considered as non-responders, unless both 84 and 108 weeks 
PCR assessments indicated that the subject was in MMR: 0 subjects in the asciminib arm and 0 in the bosutinib arm 
with missing PCR assessment at 96 weeks were imputed as having MMR at 96 weeks.

Sensitivity analyses 
Results  of  the  predefined  sensitivity  analyses  demonstrated  consistency  with  the  primary  results  and 
thereby claiming confirmation of their robustness.  
Two patients (one from each arm) had missing data after 24 weeks. Statistical significance could not be 
concluded if patient in the bosutinib arm is assumed a responder but not the patient on asciminib arm, 
while statistical significance could be concluded for all other constellations. As both patients were MMR 
responders after week 96, no constellation is implausible. The true constellation must remain speculative 
such  that the  decision  must  rely  on  the  pre-specified  approach,  however, the  conclusion of  statistical 
significance is not robust.   
Discrepancies between stratum assigned at randomization (IRT) and that derived based on bone marrow 
aspirate  data  as  reported  in  the  CRF,  had  no  significant  impact  on  the  interpretation  of  the  efficacy 
results.  The  analysis  of  MMR  rate  at  Week  24  adjusting  by  the  stratum  based  on  the  CRF  data 
demonstrated  consistency  with  the  primary  results  which  adjusted  by  the  stratum  based  on  the 
randomization data. However, since interpretation of this data does not reflect the long term outcome, 
the relevance of this observations may be challenged. 
The imputation rule in case of missing PCR evaluations at Week 24 was used however not applicable in 
the primary analysis as no patient with missing Week 24 assessment had both a 16-week and a 36-week 
assessment  indicating  MMR  [Study  A2301  CSR  Primary  endpoint  analysis-Section  11.1.1.2]. 
Consequently, the results from the analysis of the primary endpoint not using the imputation rule were 
the same as those from for the primary analysis. 
Off-note: Hypothesis testing for the primary and key secondary endpoints follows a hierarchical testing 
approach  to  preserve  overall  alpha  level  of  5%  (two-sided).  Therefore  since  the  test  of  the  primary 
endpoint was significant the key secondary endpoint can be tested at the 5% significance level at the 
96-week analysis time point.

The provided subgroup analyses demonstrated a homogeneous and consistent treatment effect in favor 
of asciminib across most major demographic and prognostic subgroups reported in Figure OE 2 above. 
The MMR rate at Week 24 was higher in patients on asciminib regardless of baseline cytogenetic response 
(MCyR or no MCyR) or the detection of BCR-ABL1 mutations. 
The subgroup analysis by line of therapy of randomized treatment confirmed the benefit of asciminib in 
heavily pretreated patients. A consistent treatment benefit with respect to the primary endpoint MMR 
rate at Week 24 was observed with asciminib compared to bosutinib whether given as 3rd-line therapy 
(29.3%  vs.  20.0%),  4th-line  therapy  (25.0%  vs.  13.8%),  or  ≥   5th-line  therapy  (16.1%  vs.  0%).

According to the applicant these results may demonstrate the efficacy of asciminib irrespective of the 
number of previous lines of treatment with TKIs. 
Other secondary efficacy results 
MMR rate at and by all scheduled data collection time points 
The MMR rate at each scheduled time point was higher for the asciminib arm compared to the bosutinib 
arm, with relevant differences starting to be noted at Week 12 (17.8% in the asciminib arm compared 
to 9.2% in the bosutinib arm; common treatment difference after adjusting for the baseline MCyR status 
was 8.58%, (95% CI: -0.18, 17.34) (CSR Table 11-5). 
Time to MMR 
Among patients who achieved MMR, responses were achieved faster in patients treated with asciminib 
(median time to MMR: 15.6 weeks) compared to bosutinib (median time to MMR: 24.0 weeks) 
Duration of MMR 
The majority of patients who achieved MMR continued in MMR: only 2 patients (5.6%) in the 
asciminib arm versus one subject in the bosutinib arm subsequently lost their response.  
The KM estimated proportion of patients maintaining their MMR for at least 48 weeks was 96.1% (95% 
CI: 85.4, 99.0) in the asciminib arm vs 90.0% (95% CI: 47.3,98.5) in the bosutinib arm. 
With respect to Cytogenetic Response: 
Cytogenetic response rate (complete, partial, major, minor, minimal, no response) at and by all

The CCyR rates at Week 24 and by Week 24 (based on patients who were not in CCyR at baseline) 
were both 40.8% in the asciminib arm compared to 24.2% in the bosutinib arm. The treatment 
difference in the CCyR rate was 17.3% (95%: 3.62, 30.99, nominal p value= 0.019) (Table below). By

Source: Table 14.2-2.3, Table 14.2-2.4 
The CCyR rates continued to be higher in the asciminib arm compared to the bosutinib arm at Week 
48 (39.8% vs 21.0%) and by Week 48 (45.6% vs 35.5%). By the time of the 30-day update cut-off, 
overall CCyR rates were 47.6% (compared to 42.7% at the previous cut-off) in the asciminib arm and 
35.5% (compared to 30.7% at the previous cut-off) in the bosutinib arm. 
The CCyR rate at Week 96 (based on patients who were not in CCyR at baseline) was 39.8% in the 
asciminib arm and 16.1% in the bosutinib arm, corresponding to a common treatment difference (after 
adjusting for baseline MCyR status) of 23.9% (95% CI: 10.3, 37.4). 
Time to CCyR 
Time to CCyR among subjects who achieved CCyR was the same between the two treatment arms, with 
medians of approximately 24 weeks (Median: Asciminib 24.3 weeks versus Bosutinib 24. 2 weeks) in the 
recent updated interim analysis. 
Duration of CCyR 
The majority of patients who achieved CCyR continued to be in CCyR at the time of their last assessment 
(48/49 in the asciminib arm and 21/22 in the bosutinib arm). 
The KM estimated proportion of patients maintaining CCyR for at least 48 weeks was 97.6% (95% CI: 
84.3, 99.7) in the asciminib arm vs 91.7% (95% CI: 53.9, 98.8) in the bosutinib arm. 
The KM estimated median duration of CCyR has not been reached in either treatment arm. 
The  majority  of  patients  who  achieved  CCyR  continued  to  be  in  CCyR  at  the  time  of  the  96  weeks 
assessment (50/51 in the asciminib arm and 20/22 in the bosutinib arm). The KM estimated proportion 
of patients maintaining CCyR for at least 72 weeks was 97.8% (95% CI: 85.6, 99.7) in the asciminib 
arm vs 81.3% (95% CI: 41.5, 95.2) in the bosutinib arm. 
Time to treatment failure 
The  probability  of  patients  experiencing  treatment  failure  (defined  as  not  meeting  efficacy  criteria  or 
treatment discontinuation due to any reason) continued to be lower in the asciminib arm with a 60% 
relative  risk  reduction  in  favor  of  asciminib  (Hazard  ratio=0.4;  95%  CI:  0.3,  0.6;  p<0.0001).  The 
proportion  of  patients  experiencing  treatment  failure  by  the  30-day  update  cut-off  date  was  48.4% 
(compared to 45.2% at the previous cut-off) in the asciminib arm versus 80.3% (compared to 73.7% at 
the previous cut-off) in the bosutinib arm. The median time to treatment failure was not reached for the 
asciminib arm while it was 0.5 years in the bosutinib arm.  
In  the  week  96  evaluation,  the  risk  of  experiencing a  treatment  failure  (defined  as  meeting  a  lack  of 
efficacy criteria based on ELN 2013 recommendations or discontinuing treatment due to any reason) was 
56% still lower in the asciminib arm than in the bosutinib arm (Hazard ratio=0.44; 95% CI: 0.3, 0.6; 
p<0.0001). 
The median time to treatment failure was 2 years in the asciminib arm and 6 months in the bosutinib 
arm.

Progression free survival 
The median follow-up time for progression free survival (PFS) extends to 14.4 months in the asciminib 
arm and 13.2 months in the bosutinib arm. 
The KM estimated PFS rate at 1 year was 96.3% (95% CI: 91.3, 98.5) in the asciminib arm and 91.1% 
(95% CI: 79.5, 96.3) in the bosutinib arm 
Recent updated results are shown in the following Figure below: 
Figure 10: Kaplan-Meier plot of progression-free survival (Study A2301, FAS) 
PFS at week 96 is reported with a median follow-up time for PFS of 1.8 years in the asciminib arm and 
1.1 years in the bosutinib arm. Overall, by the cut-off date, 9 patients (5.7%) in the asciminib arm and 
5 patients (6.6%) in the bosutinib arm either experienced a disease progression to AP/BC or died 
during the study. The KM estimated PFS rate at 2 years was 94.4% (95% CI: 88.6, 97.3) for the 
asciminib arm and 91.1% (95% CI: 79.5, 96.3) for the bosutinib arm. 
Overall survival 
A total of five patients (3.2%; two on-treatment and three during survival follow-up) in the asciminib 
arm and two patients (2.6%, one on-treatment and one during survival follow-up) in the bosutinib arm 
died on-study, including two additional deaths (one in each treatment arm) during survival follow-up 
reported after the previous cut-off date (06-Jan-2021).

At the Week 96 cut-off date, a total of 7 patients died: 5 in the asciminib arm and 2 in the bosutinib 
arm. The KM estimated OS rate at 2 years was 97.3% (95% CI: 92.9, 99.0) for the asciminib arm and 
98.6% (95% CI: 90.2, 99.8) for the bosutinib arm. 
•  Ancillary analyses 
Impact of COVID-19 
The COVID-19 pandemic had minimal effect on the primary study results. 191/233 patients had planned 
24-week visit before the COVID-19 pandemic (started from 1-Jan-2020). 
The  primary  endpoint  assessment  (BCR-ABL1  level  at  Week  24  only  assessed  at  central 
testing laboratory) was missed for 2 patients due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These patients 
were considered as non-responders in the primary analysis.  
The  results  from  the  sensitivity  analysis  excluding  patients  (29  patients  in  the  asciminib  arm  and  13 
patients in the bosutinib arm) with a planned Week 24 visit after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic 
were consistent with the results from the primary analysis: 
−  The MMR rate at Week 24 was 28.9% in the asciminib arm compared to 12.7% in the bosutinib 
arm.

Supportive study: Study X2101 
The Study X2101 is an ongoing, multi-center, open-label dose finding Phase 1 study (First in patient) to 
define the MTD and/or RDE(s), safety, tolerability, PK and to provide preliminary evidence of efficacy of 
asciminib given as single agent or in combination with either nilotinib or imatinib or dasatinib. 
The study was designed to include 5 arms: 
Arm 1: asciminib as single agent in patients with CML-CP/-AP  
Arm  2:  asciminib  in  combination  with  nilotinib  in  patients  with  CML-CP/-AP  (introduced  with  protocol 
amendment 4) 
Arm  3:  asciminib  in  combination  with  imatinib  in  patients  with  CML-CP/-AP  (introduced  with  protocol 
amendment 6) 
Arm 4: asciminib in combination with dasatinib in patients with CML-CP/-AP (introduced with protocol

Arm 5: asciminib as single agent in patients with CML-BP and Ph+ ALL 
A total of 330 patients were planned and 317 patients were enrolled and analyzed as of the cut-off date. 
The study is still enrolling patients in Arm 4. 
With respect to the applied indication, this AR focuses mainly on the subset of patients from 
Study X2101, receiving single agent asciminib for CML-CP not harboring the T315I mutation 
(subset of Arm 1).  
Study population 
In Study X2101, a subset of 115 enrolled patients received single agent asciminib at any dose for CML-
CP not harboring the T315I mutation. The various asciminib single agent treatment cohorts into which 
these patients with CML-CP not harboring the T315I were enrolled, were: 10 mg b.i.d. (n=1), 20 mg 
b.i.d. (n=13), 40 mg b.i.d. (n=30), 80 mg b.i.d. (n=8), 150 mg b.i.d. (n=5), 160 mg b.i.d. (n=3), 200 
mg b.i.d. (10), 80 mg q.d. (n=17), 120 mg q.d. (n=17), and 200 mg q.d. (n=11) [CSR Study X2101 
Primary analysis-Table 14.1-1.1.1.2]. 
Treatment 
The starting dose of asciminib for patients with CML-CP/-AP selected for the dose escalation part of this 
study was set at 10 mg orally administered b.i.d. under fasted conditions. The selection of the starting 
dose of asciminib was based on 4-week GLP toxicology studies conducted in rats and dogs. In addition, 
the PK-pharmacodynamic (PD) mouse model suggested a b.i.d. regimen was required to maintain PD 
effect. The starting dose of 10 mg b.i.d. was expected to be safe and tolerated in adult patients with 
CML-CP/-AP. Based on further PK modeling and pre-clinical studies which suggested response in BCR-
ABL1 transcripts also when a q.d. regimen was considered in Study X2101, decision was taken to open 
a cohort of patients dosed on a q.d. regimen at 120 mg q.d. as starting dose level. 
The  dose  range  covered  were  initially  based  on  the  projections  for  the  human  PK  of  asciminib  and 
projections for the relationship between asciminib systemic exposure and toxicity. The dose levels were 
updated as more PK and safety data became available and clinical experience was used to elucidate the 
relationships between dose, systemic exposure, and toxicity.

Based on the above, actual dose levels evaluated in patients with CML-CP/-AP included 10 mg b.i.d., 20 
mg b.i.d., 40 mg b.i.d., 80 mg b.i.d., 150 mg b.i.d., 160 mg b.i.d., 200 mg b.i.d., 80 mg q.d., 120 mg 
q.d., and 200 mg q.d. 
Results  
MMR rate at scheduled time-point 
Among  86  evaluable  CML-CP  patients  not  harboring  the  T315I  mutation,  50  (58.1%)  patients 
achieved MMR at any time-point. The MMR rate at Week 24 was 23.3%; an increasing MMR rate 
(for patients who were not in MMR at baseline) over time was observed [SCE-Table 3-22]. A similar trend 
of increasing MMR rate over time was observed across all lines of therapy for all patients evaluable for 
MMR with CML-CP not harboring the T315I mutation [CSR SCE-Figure 3-8]. 
Time to MMR and duration of response 
Time of MMR: Overall, among 50/86 patients with CML-CP without the T315I mutation who achieved 
MMR, the median time to first MMR was 38.3 weeks, ranging from 2 to 192 weeks after starting 
treatment with single agent asciminib. Similarly, a wide range of time to response was observed across 
all dose levels with the majority of responses being observed within the first 48 weeks of treatment [CSR 
Study X2101 Primary analysis-Table 14.2-6.2]. 
Duration  of  MMR:  Overall,  among  50/86  patients  with  CML-CP  without  the  T315I  mutation  who 
achieved  MMR,  most  (46  patients)  maintained  this  response  level  or  improved  it  to  a  deeper  level  of 
response  at  the  time  of  their  last  assessment.  Given  the  median  (maximum)  duration  of  treatment 
exposure of 183.4 (302) weeks, this indicates that the responses achieved were highly durable. The KM 
estimated proportion of patients maintaining their first MMR for at least 48 weeks was 96% (95% CI: 
89.5,  100.0)  and  for  at  least  96  weeks  was  93%  (95%  CI:  85.7,  100.0)  [CSR  Study  X2101  Primary 
analysis-Table 14.2-5.2]. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Asciminib (ABL001) is an inhibitor that targets the myristoyl pocket of BCR-ABL1, in contrast to the 
currently available TKIs that target the BCR-ABL1 ATP binding site. By virtue of asciminib not 
interacting with the ATP-binding site, asciminib maintains activity against cells expressing clinically 
observed ATP-binding TKI resistant mutations. Therefore, in a first step, approval in adult patients for 
the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase (Ph+ 
CML-CP) previously treated with two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors is applied. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Efficacy  claim  for  the  applied  indication  “treatment  of  adult  patients  with  Philadelphia  chromosome-
positive chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) previously treated with two or more 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors” is based on the results of the primary analysis of the pivotal Phase III study 
Study A2301 (data cut-off date of 06-Jan 2021/ 06-Oct 2021).  
Supportive evidence from the first phase 1 trial in patients (Study X2101) is available. Cut -off 
date  is  02-Apr-2020.  However,  since  the  primary  endpoint  of  trial  X2101  was  the  incidence  of  dose 
limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first cycle of study treatment, the main focus of this data is clearly 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 81/128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
safety and evaluation of MTD. Due to the mix-up of several dosages as well as drug combinations and 
diseases (Ph+ALL, CML-CM+AP) information regarding efficacy in the small cohorts remains limited and 
mainly supportive regarding outcome after longer treatment.  
No  combined  efficacy  analyses  could  be  performed  for  studies  A2301  and  X2101  as  intra-
patient dose escalation was allowed in Study X2101. 
The pivotal Study A2301 is an ongoing, randomized, open-label, active-controlled (bosutinib), multi-
center Phase III study to compare the efficacy and safety of asciminib with that of bosutinib in patients 
with CML-CP, previously treated with at least 2 prior TKIs. A total of 233 patients were randomized in a 
2:1 ratio to receive either asciminib 40 mg b.i.d. (n=157) or bosutinib 500 mg q.d. (n=76), stratified 
by the patient's cytogenetic response status at baseline.  
Twice as many patients were ongoing in the asciminib arm (61.8%) relative to the bosutinib arm 
(28.9%) at the time of the data cut-off. Median duration of exposure to study treatment was 
approximately 50% longer in the asciminib 40 mg b.i.d. arm (43.4 vs. 29.2 weeks) compared to the 
bosutinib 500 mg q.d. indicating a higher probability for treatment discontinuation (and switch to 
asciminib in patients meeting protocol defined lack of efficacy criteria) in the bosutinib arm. However, 
also other reasons may have contributed to the higher treatment discontinuation rate considering the 
open trial design. 
The proposed dose of 40 mg BID in fasting state was selected based on preclinical evidence, the results 
of  the  PopPK-exposure  Analysis  and  the  pharmacokinetic,  efficacy  and  safety  data  available  from  the 
first in-human study phase 1 trial X2101. According to the results of this trial, a signal for an increased 
toxicity was observed at doses ≥ 80 mg BID, although the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for asciminib 
monotherapy in patients with CML-CP was not achieved. Thus, the applicant selected the dose of 40 mg 
b.i.d. for the pivotal trial A2301, taken orally on an empty stomach, with no food to be consumed for at 
least 2 hour before the dose was taken, and for at least 1 hour after the dose was taken.  
However, the applicant applied also for a different posology than administered in the pivotal trial: a dose 
of  80  mg  q.d.  is  proposed  as  an  alternative  regimen  to  the  40  mg  b.i.d.  Since  this  dose  was  only 
preliminary investigated in 17 subjects in trial X2101, definitive conclusions on comparative efficacy and 
particularly regarding safety cannot be reliably drawn. In conclusion, the benefit risk balance for the 80 
mg  q,d  posology  may  be  different  and    this  recommendation  should  not  be  included  in  the  product 
information.  The applicant has accepted to remove the 80 mg q.d. as an alternative dosing regimen, as 
recommended by the CHMP. The already initiated trial CABL001A2302 , that was regarded as PASS to 
evaluate the benefit risk balance for the 80 mg q,d posology, is now considered as PASS for long-term 
safety, important identified and important potential risks in currently proposed dosing regimen of 40 mg 
BID. 
Bosutinib and not ponatinib was selected as comparator for trial A2301, since this product was specifically 
evaluated and approved in the EU in patients R/I ≥ 2 prior TKIs at the recommended dose of 500 mg 
q.d..  Insofar  this  comparator  is  fully  acceptable,  as  already  agreed  during  CHMP’s  previous  scientific 
advice.  
Similarly, an open-label conduct of the study is acceptable. It was justified since in addition to differences 
in  dose  adaptations,  conditions  for  drug  administration  differ  markedly  for  asciminib  and  bosutinib 
(asciminib needs to be taken in a fasted state, bosutinib should be taken with food). It was agreed that 
these issue making blinding with double-dummy treatment complex and probably carrying the inherent 
risk of administration and dosing errors. Moreover, acceptance is in accordance with CHMP’s previous 
decision to accept open label designs already for pivotal trials for previous second or third generation 
TKIs in this disease. However, it needs to be considered that issues as treatment discontinuation and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 82/128 
 
 
 
particularly the switch to a treatment alternative may be more reliably assessed in a double-blinded trial 
design. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were adequately chosen in order to select the intended target population 
of adult patients (>18 years of age) with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia 
in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) previously treated with two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors. No specific 
concern  became  obvious  regarding  the  selected  study  population  from  the  inclusion  and  exclusion 
criteria. 
Major  molecular  response  (MMR)  in  principle  is  an  acceptable  surrogate-marker  in  CML.  However, 
selection of MMR at week 24 as primary endpoint needs to be supplemented by long-term surrogate data 
as MMR at week 96, which was meanwhile provided.  
Moreover, assessment of the treatment duration and other secondary endpoints, which are standard in 
CML  trials  and  thus  fully  acceptable,  is  also  not  fully  mature  and  need  an  update  as  far  as  available 
during this procedure and late on. Nevertheless, the issue remains that the high discontinuation rate in 
the bosutinib arm due to non-response may had affected the reported efficacy outcome also at the end. 
The statistical methods are standard and generally considered acceptable.  
The randomisation stratification factor was adequately taken into account by a correspondingly stratified 
analysis. Using the common risk difference and corresponding 95% CI using Mantel-Haenszel method is 
considered as the appropriate method for summarizing the treatment effect as risk differences can be 
easier interpreted (compared to e.g. odds ratios) and as the method is consistent with the hypothesis 
test. 
Adjustment for multiplicity was pre-planned only for the key secondary endpoint, which had not yet been 
analysed. Analyses of additional endpoints were not consistently confirmatory. 
In  accordance  with  the  primary  estimand,  patients  who  discontinued  treatment  before  week  24  were 
considered as treatment failures such that these do not cause a missing data problem for the primary 
analysis. Although only few patients still on treatment had missing data at week 24, considering that 
one more responder in the bosutinib group would change the conclusion regarding statistical significance, 
handling  of  missing  data is  of  relevance.  Considering  the  tipping  point  analysis  after  96  weeks,  more 
responders  in  the  bosutinib  arm  among  patients  with  intercurrent  events  are  required  to  change  the 
conclusion  with  regard  to  statistical  significance  (at  least  more  than  5,  if  no  additional  responders 
occurred  under  asciminib).  However,  the  supplementary  analyses  demonstrate  that  this  is  not 
implausible such that the tipping point analysis provides also no conclusive support for the robustness 
of the conclusion of statistical significance after 96 weeks, if other estimands than the pre-specified are 
of interest.  
The  two  treatment  arms  were  overall  balanced  for  the  demographic  characteristics  assessed,  with 
differences  observed  in  ethnicity  and  sex.  Patients  in  the  asciminib  arm  (9.6%)  included  fewer 
Hispanic/Latino patients compared to the bosutinib arm (22.4%). Similarly, the proportion of males was 
slightly higher in the asciminib arm (52.2%) compared to the bosutinib arm (40.8%). No evidence for 
bias is observed. 
The  studied  population  in  study  A2301  consisted  of  heavily  pre-treated  CML  patients  with  half  of  the 
patients (52.4%) receiving study treatment as 3rd-line therapy and the other half as 4,5 or 6th line of 
treatment. Sixty-four percent (64%) of the patients entered the study due to lack of efficacy on last TKI 
and 35% due to tolerability issues with last TKI. Imbalances between the treatment arms were noted 
with respect to prior lines of TKI treatment (pts with 2 prior TKIs (57% asci vs 43% bosu), discontinuation 
of prior treatment due to lack of efficacy (60% in asci arm  vs 71% bosu) and a lower proportions of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 83/128 
 
 
 
patients  received  nilotinib  and  ponatinib  in  the  asciminib  arm  than  in  the  bosutinib  arm  (66.2%  vs. 
73.7% and 14.6% vs. 23.7%). The requested additional information revealed no evidence for bias.  
The applicant clarified that it is not intended to allow asciminib also for treatment of Ph+ CML-CP patients 
harboring a T315I mutation who have received two or more TKIs.   
Supportive data from Trial X2101 
Study X2101, is an ongoing Phase I, first-in-patients, multicenter, open-label, dose escalation study to 
define  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  and/or  recommended  dose  for  expansion  (MTD/RDEs),  to 
characterize  safety  and  tolerability,  and  to  assess  the  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  profile  and  preliminary 
evidence of efficacy of asciminib given as single agent or in combination with either nilotinib or imatinib 
or dasatinib in patients with CML or Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [5 arm-trial].  
Supportive efficacy data from a small cohort of CML-CP and AP patients was submitted from trial X2101. 
In this first-in-patients, phase 1 trial, efficacy from CML patients exposed to the applied dose of 40 mg 
b.i.d. (n=30) an alternative dose of 80 mg q.d. (n=17) is evaluable.  
This data allow at preliminary evaluation of efficacy after longer exposure and seems to be the only 
source for the proposed alternative posology of 80 mg asciminib o.d.. However, the presented outcome 
analyses among 86 evaluable CML patients not harboring the T315I mutation include also patients that 
were treated with a higher (and probably lower) doses of asciminib due to the design. This 
heterogeneity precludes any pooling of the data and impeded interpretation of the results and makes 
further conclusions a priori difficult. Thus, the pivotal relevance of the data is seen as limited compared 
with that derived from trial A2301. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
It is agreed that study A2301 indicate efficacy of asciminib in the target population applied for and the 
trial  met  its  primary  objective.  Thus,  formal  statistical  superiority  regarding  this  outcome  was 
demonstrated  for  asciminib  40  mg  BID  relative  to  bosutinib  500  mg  QD  with  respect  to  the  primary 
endpoint of MMR at 24 weeks while on study treatment without meeting any treatment failure criteria as 
pre-specified in the study protocol.  
A MMR rate of 25.5% is reported in the asciminib arm (nearly twice as high) compared to 13.2% in the 
bosutinib arm after 24 weeks of treatment. It is acknowledged that this result is statistically significant 
and may indicate a potentially clinical meaningful difference in the heavily pre-treated study population 
of 12.2% (95% CI: 2.19, 22.30, two-sided p-value: 0.029) (per the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel two-sided 
test stratified by the MCyR status at baseline) in favour for asciminib.  
MMR rate seems to be consistent also at later time points up to week 48/60/96 according the recent 
interim update of data submitted after start of procedure.  
Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analysis presented for the outcome MMR at week 24 are in line with 
the primary outcome. The efficacy of asciminib is irrespective of the number of previous lines of TKIs as 
demonstrated in MMR rate at 24 weeks (asciminib compared to bosutinib) as 3rd-line therapy (29.3% 
vs. 20.0%), 4th-line therapy (25.0% vs. 13.8%), or  5th-line therapy (16.1% vs. 0%). 
Other secondary endpoints support also the primary analysis as demonstrated in favour of asci with a 
shorter median time to MMR (12.7 weeks vs 14.3 weeks for bosutinib), a higher duration of MMR (KM 
estimated proportion of patients maintaining their MMR for at least 48 weeks was 96.1% (95% CI: 85.4, 
99.0) in the asci arm vs 90.0% (95% CI: 47.3, 98.5) in the bosutinib arm). However, it is considered 
that current database is affected by the issue that only few participants are remaining in the bosutinib 
arm.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022

Loss  of  response  has  been  observed  in  both  treatment  arms  in  the  current  study  and  has  also  been 
described previously in a small subset of the bosutinib treated patients as part of the compassionate use 
program (source bosutinib EPAR). As loss of response has only been seen in a limited number of subjects, 
both CHMP agreed that this is not a reason to question the benefit of asciminib treatment in principle. 
The initially requested further information on reasons for loss of response in these patients (i.e. was loss 
of  response  determined  objective  through  assessment,  or  due  to  another  reason)  together  with  an 
update of the cases of loss of response in the asciminib arm was provided and does not lead to major 
changes in the assessment outcome.  
From  a  methodological  point  of  view  it  is  important,  that  for  the  primary  estimand,  treatment 
discontinuation and meeting any treatment failure criteria were included as components in the primary 
endpoint by considering these as non-response (i.e. a composite strategy was applied in accordance with 
ICH  E9  (R1)),  which  implies  that  these  events  are  considered  as  clinically  relevant  and  of  equal 
importance  than  not  achieving  MMR  at  week  24.  This  is  generally  appropriate  for  meeting  treatment 
failure criteria. While it is also agreed that treatment discontinuation can be considered as a negative 
outcome  considering  that  long-term  disease  control  is  possible  only  under  continuous  treatment,  the 
reasons  for  treatment  discontinuation  should  also  be  taken  into  account,  particularly  considering  the 
open-label design. However, response received on the initial concerns and the increase of the difference 
in  MMR  at  week  96  in  favour  for  asciminib  modifies  the  issues  regarding  the  relevance  of  the 
discontinuation reasons, since superiority no longer depends from a single patient between the arms.  
Moreover,  imbalances  between  the  treatment  arms  with  respect  to  prior  lines  of  TKI  treatment,  the 
higher proportions of patients discontinued the prior TKI due to intolerance in the asciminib arm vs. the 
bosutinib arm and particularly the fact that lower proportions of patients received nilotinib and ponatinib 
in  the  asciminib  arm  than  in  the  bosutinib  arm  in  combination  were  noted.  Although  these  baseline 
imbalances could have favored all asciminib at the end, the effect seems not so pronounced that it may 
have  affect  the  efficacy  outcome  significantly.  In  conclusion,  the  main  uncertainty  which  remains  is 
caused by the higher discontinuation rate due to a lack of efficacy or adverse events in the bosutinib 
arm. Overall, the potential impact of baseline imbalances was sufficiently clarified with the response and 
no longer raise concern regarding the described benefit. 
A difference was observed between patients discontinuing last prior TKI due to intolerance (2.1%; 95%CI 
-20.8 - 25.0) or due to resistance on their last TKI (15.5%; 95%CI 5.3 - 25.7). Further analysis revealed 
that this is not due to the unbalanced baseline distribution of prognostic factors. It was suggested that 
this is due to limited efficacy of bosunitinib in patients with prior failure of their last TKI (MMR rate: 5.6% 
patients with failure compared to 31.8% patients intolerant to last TKI). However, the applicant clarified 
that at the time of primary endpoint assessment at Week 24, by treatment arms, the responder group 
in the asciminib arm had the same proportion of patients with intolerance or resistance to last TKI (50% 
each). However, in the bosutinib arm, the responder group had more patients who were intolerant to 
last TKI (70%).  
Given  the  trial  was  open-label  and  patients  who  withdrew  from  the  study  were  considered  non-
responders, it could be that the discrepancy between patients with prior failure or intolerance was due 
to the withdrawal of patients rather than a difference in response. For these subgroups, the Applicant is 
requested to provide the number of patients who had an assessment at 24 weeks and the outcomes for 
these patients by treatment arm. For those patients who did not have an assessment at 24 weeks, a 
detailed  summary  of  reasons  for  discontinuation  was  provided  and  clarified  that  prior  failure  or 
intolerance is not explained by non-response due to withdrawal/missing data.  
Supportive data from Trial X2101 
Among 86 evaluable CML-CP (-AP?) patients not harboring the T315I mutation results may be assessed 
as in-line with the outcome in the pivotal trial A2301. The MMR rate at Week 24 is reported with 23.3% 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 85/128 
 
 
 
(compared with 25 % in A2301). As could be expected, the MMR rate increases over time: 50 (58.1%) 
patients achieved MMR at any time-point. The duration of MMR among the 50/86 patients with CML-CP 
who achieved MMR the KM estimated proportion of patients maintaining their first MMR for at least 48 
weeks  was  96%  (95%  CI:  89.5,  100.0)  and  for  at  least  96  weeks  was  93%  (95%  CI:  85.7,  100.0). 
However, since only 47 of the 86 subjection analysed received the applied posology [40 mg b.i.d. (n=30) 
an alternative dose of 80 mg q.d. (n=17)], the interpretability of the reported outcome is critical due to 
several reasons. In particular, since also patients treated with higher doses (up to 200 mg bid) were 
included.  
Nevertheless, the data presented seems be support the efficacy in CML in principle and particularly allow 
a first glance on efficacy after longer exposure, since treatment duration is significantly longer (183.4 
weeks in 115 CML-CP patients) than in the pivotal trial A2301. Moreover, efficacy data from X2101 is 
the only source for the proposed, but rejected alternative posology of 80 mg asciminib o.d.. 
Further conclusions from this data source are difficult due to the highly heterogeneous phase I population 
included and the probable differences in disease-stage (including CML-AP) and the primary dose-finding 
aim of the design.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of asciminib in patients with Ph+ CML-CP not harboring the T315I mutation and treated with 
two or more TKIs has been demonstrated in the pivotal study A2301 supported with data from study 
X2101. Outcome after longer treatment duration with the surrogate endpoint MMR at week 96 was also 
provided and confirms the superiority in efficacy against bosutinib. The currently available data set 
with Week 96 efficacy is seen as mature. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The safety profile of asciminib has been characterized based on the safety data from Study A2301 (pivotal 
study),  Study  X2101  (supportive  study)  and  pooled  analysis  data  (in  total  356  patients).  The  overall 
safety  database  is  small.  For  comparison  to  other  approved  TKIs,  dasatinib  database  comprised  511 
patients when the product was approved; bosutinib database comprised 1209 patients who received at 
least 1 dose of oral bosutinib alone or in combination with another anticancer agent. 
The safety evaluation of asciminib monotherapy in patients with Ph+ CML-CP is based on the data from 
the primary analysis (data cut-off date: 25-May-2020) of an ongoing Phase III, multi-center, open-label, 
randomized,  active-controlled  Study  –  Study  A2301  (asciminib  group;  N=156  and  bosutinib  group; 
N=76). The safety population exposed to asciminib in the pivotal phase III study (n=156) is smaller than 
in bosutinib (n=248), dasatinib (n=258) or nilotinib (n=556) pivotal trials. 
The safety data from the Study X2101 (data cut-off date: 02-Apr-2020) provides supportive evidence of 
asciminib safety in patients with CML-CP. 
A  30-day  update  was  submitted  as  well,  that  provided  an  updated  evaluation  of  efficacy  and  safety. 
Updated  data  were  analysed  included  longer  follow-up  data  with  a  cut-off  date  6-Jan-2021, 
corresponding  to  approximately  7.5  months  and  9  months  additional  follow-up  for  study  A2301  and 
Study  X2101,  respectively.  In  general,  these  updated  safety  results  seem  consistent  with  the  safety 
results submitted in the original CO and SCS. 
Based on previous regulatory experience on TKIs the safety database in the target population could be 
considered  overall  large  enough  to  allow  safety  assessment.  However,  as  the  product  is  intended  for 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 86/128 
 
 
 
 
long-term treatment in a heavily pre-treated CML population, updated longer follow-up safety data is to 
be provided to allow the assessment of the long-term risk.  
Therefore, as a response to Day 120 List of Questions, an updated safety analysis of the pivotal Study 
A2301,  at  cut-off  date  06-Oct-2021  and  with  9  months  additional  follow-up,  was  presented  and 
discussed.  
Furthermore, the Week 96 interim CSR for Study A2301 was provided with the responses to the Day 180 
List of Outstanding Issues, with an additional safety update. 
Pooled  data  from  Study  A2301  and  Study  X2101  enable  an  evaluation  of  the  impact  of  asciminib 
treatment at different doses and different treatment regimens. Safety pools are defined as follow: 
• 
• 
Pool A (asciminib All patients Safety Pool; N=356): Data from all patients treated with asciminib 
in the Study A2301 (N=156) along with data from all patients with CML-CP/-AP (regardless of 
T315I mutation) treated with single agent asciminib at any dose from Study X2101 (N=200). 
Pool C (asciminib 40 mg b.i.d. Safety Pool; N=187): Data from all patients treated with asciminib 
in the Study A2301 (N=156) along with data from patients with CML-CP (regardless of T315I 
mutation)  treated  with  a starting  dose  of  single  agent  asciminib  40  mg  b.i.d.  in  Study  X2101 
(N= 31). 
In  this  Assessment  Report,  safety  assessment  focuses  mainly  on  the  pivotal  trial  Study  A2301  and 
information from Study X2101.  
The safety population in each study included subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. 
Of  note,  patients  on  bosutinib  treatment  in  the  study  were  offered  the  option  to  receive  asciminib 
treatment within 96 weeks after the last patient was randomized on study, and if investigator considered 
this treatment to be in the best interest of the patient. Patients intolerant to bosutinib were not allowed 
to switch to asciminib. 
As of the primary analysis cut-off (25-May-2020), 22 patients had switched treatment from bosutinib 
to asciminib, with additional two at the data cut-off date of 06-Oct-2021. The safety profile of 
asciminib observed in the patients who switched from bosutinib to asciminib is consistent with that 
observed in patients receiving asciminib in the randomization phase of the study. 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
In the pivotal Study A2301, as of the data cut off of 6-Jan-2021, the median duration of exposure to 
asciminib  was  67.1  weeks  (approximately  15.6  months),  which  was  longer  by  23.8  weeks  from  43.4 
weeks at the previous cut-off on 25-May 2020; 67.3% of patients were exposed for at least 48 weeks of 
asciminib  treatment.  The  longest  duration  of  exposure  was  approximately  6.5  years  in  Asciminib  All 
Patients Pool and approximately 3 years in the study A2301. 
The median duration of exposure to bosutinib at the data cut off of 6-Jan-2021, remained similar at 29.7 
weeks compared to 29.2 weeks at the previous cut-off. The reason for this is that majority of patients 
had discontinued bosutinib by the time of primary analysis cut-off. The maximum exposure to bosutinib 
increased  to  149  weeks.  Total  exposure  was  204.3  patient-years  and  61.2  patient-years  for  patients 
randomised to asciminib treatment group and the bosutinib treatment group, respectively. 
An updated safety analysis with a cut-off date of 06-Oct-2021 increased the median duration of exposure 
in Study A2301 to 23.7 months, and in asciminib All patients Pool to 26.6 months .  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 87/128 
 
 
 
There  is  a  substantial  difference  in  exposure  between  asciminib  and  bosutinib  treatment  groups.  The 
median duration of exposure to study drug was approximately three times longer in the asciminib arm 
(103.14 weeks; range: 0.1 to 201.1) compared to that in the bosutinib arm (30.50 weeks; range: 1.0 
to 188.3). This is due to the fact that more patients discontinued study medication in the bosutinib vs 
asciminib treatment group.  
The per-protocol doses of asciminib and bosutinib in the study A2301 were 40 mg b.i.d. and 500 mg q.d. 
respectively. In case of toxicities, the dose of asciminib could be reduced to 20 mg b.i.d. For bosutinib, 
two levels of dose reduction were allowed: 400 mg q.d. and 300 mg q.d. Doses below 20 mg b.i.d. for 
asciminib and below 300 mg q.d. for bosutinib were not allowed. In Study A2301, median dose intensities 
were 79.8 mg/day (minimum-maximum: 33-80) and 478.6 mg (minimum-maximum: 181-566) for the 
asciminib and bosutinib treatment groups, respectively. 
The Study A2301 included patients with a diagnosis of Ph+ CML-CP (n = 157 patients); however 1 patient 
(in the asciminib arm) was not included in the Safety set (n = 156 patients), as this patient developed 
cytopenia  after  randomization  and  subsequently  did  not  receive  study  treatment  per  Investigator’s 
decision. As of the 25-May-2020 data cut-off date, 119 patients (51.1%) continued to receive treatment. 
Treatment discontinuation was less frequent in the asciminib treatment group compared to the bosutinib 
treatment  group  (37.6%  versus  69.7%).  Lack  of  efficacy  and  AEs  were  the  primary  reasons  for 
discontinuation in both treatment groups, and both were less frequent in the asciminib treatment group 
compared to the bosutinib treatment group (lack of efficacy: 21.0% versus 31.6%; AE(s): 5.1% versus 
21.1%). As of updated 06-Jan-2021 data cut-off date, 106 of the 233 patients (45.5%) were continuing 
the study treatment with 89 patients (56.7%) and 17 patients (22.4%) still ongoing in the asciminib and 
bosutinib  arms,  respectively.  Since  the  previous  cut-off,  8  additional  patients  discontinued  study 
treatment in the asciminib arm (4 patients discontinued due to lack of efficacy, one due to AE, and 3 due 
to PI decision), and 5 additional patients in bosutinib arm (3 patients discontinued due to lack of efficacy 
and  2  due  to  AE).  Lack  of  efficacy  (27.5%)  and  AEs  (11.6%)  remained  the  primary  reasons  for 
discontinuation, and both were less frequent in the asciminib treatment group compared to the bosutinib 
treatment group (lack of efficacy: 23.6% versus 35.5%; AE(s): 5.7% versus 23.7%). At the Week 96 
cut-off,  the  frequency  of  AEs  leading to  study  treatment  discontinuation  continued  to be  lower  in the 
asciminib arm; 7.7% on asciminib and 26.3% on bosutinib. 
In  Study  X2101,  as  of  the  02-Apr-2020  data  cut-off  date,  123  patients  (61.5%)  were  continuing 
treatment with single-agent asciminib and 77 patients (38.5%) had their treatment discontinued. The 
most  frequent  reasons  for  discontinuation  of  treatment  were  physician's  decision  (16.0%)  and  AE(s) 
(9.5%). Of the 32 patients (16%) who discontinued due to physician’s decision, 29 patients discontinued 
due to lack of efficacy (including 8 who received transplantation and one who was re-assigned to Arm 
4),  1  patient  due  to  both intolerance  and  lack  of  efficacy  and  2  patients  due  to  other  reasons.  As  of 
updated 06-Jan-2021 data cut-off date, 113 patients (56.5%) were continuing treatment with single-
agent asciminib and 87 patients (43.5%) had discontinued study treatment, with 10 additional patients 
(6 patients in 200 mg b.i.d. dose group and 1 patient each in 40 mg b.i.d., 160 mg b.i.d., 80 mg q.d. 
and 120 mg q.d. dose groups) having discontinued the study relative to the previous data cut-off. The 
most frequent reasons for discontinuation of treatment remained physician’s decision (16.5%) and AE(s) 
(10.0%). 
In the study A2301, the proportion of patients with at least one dose reduction (39.1% vs. 46.1%) at 
least one dose interruption (53.2% vs. 73.7%), and discontinuation (43.6% vs. 78.9%) was lower in the 
asciminib group compared to bosutinib group. 
Dose reductions were primarily attributable to AEs in both the treatment groups; 23.1% in the asciminib 
treatment group and 44.7% in the bosutinib treatment group. Dosing errors (17.9%) were the second 
common  reason  for  dose  reduction  in  the  asciminib  treatment  group  in  comparison  to  bosutinib  arm 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 88/128 
 
 
 
(1.3%). The higher frequency for dosing errors as the cause of dose reductions in the asciminib arm is 
attributable to the difference in dosing regimen between both arms; asciminib was administered twice 
daily, therefore any missed dose was reported as a dose reduction. 
Dose interruptions were primarily attributable to AEs (60.5% vs, 40.4%) and dosing errors (17.1% vs. 
12.2%);  the  incidence  of  both  reasons  was  higher  in  the  bosutinib  treatment  group  than  asciminib 
treatment group. 
Permanent discontinuation were primarily due to lack of efficacy in both the treatment groups (23.7% 
in  the  asciminib  treatment  group  compared  to  35.5%  in  the  bosutinib  treatment  group).  Permanent 
discontinuation due to AEs was less frequently reported in the asciminib group (6.4%) as compared with 
the bosutinib group (25.0%). 
In Study A2301, demographic characteristics were well balanced between the asciminib and bosutinib 
treatment groups with the exception of gender and ethnicity.  
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
Overall,  in  the  pivotal  study  2301,  the  incidence  of  AEs  in  all  categories  was  lower  in  the  asciminib 
treatment group compared to the bosutinib treatment group, with the exception of fatal SAEs, where no 
difference was apparent. 
In Study X2101, all patients who received 80 mg q.d. dose had experienced at least one AE (regardless 
of study treatment relationship). Eight (44.4%) patients had experienced SAEs and 1 patient had fatal 
SAE that was not suspected to be study treatment related as assessed by the investigator. Three patients 
had AEs that led to study treatment discontinuation. Although the number of patients who received 80 
mg q.d. in this study is too small to draw a certain conclusion, nevertheless the incidence of AE for all 
categories is evidently higher in comparison to asciminib 40 mg b.i.d in the study A2301. 
The incidence of AEs for all AE categories in the Asciminib safety pools was consistent with the asciminib 
treatment group in Study A2301. The treatment –related AEs and SAEs, however, were experienced by 
a higher number of patients (> 10%) in the asciminib All Patients Safety Pool compared to asciminib 
treatment group in Study A2301 which was attributed to the longer exposure. 
Table 25 
Overview of adverse events – Safety set (cut-off date 6-Jan-2021) 
Since fewer patients in the asciminib treatment group discontinued study medication compared to the 
bosutinib  treatment  group  which  resulted  in  marked  differences  in  the  median  exposure  to  the  two 
treatment groups (67.14 weeks vs 29.21 weeks, respectively), in order to adjust for the imbalance in

treatment  exposure  when  comparing  the  crude  frequency  of  AEs  between  asciminib  and  bosutinib  in 
Study A2301 and between asciminib treatment group in Study A2301 and the asciminib Safety Pools, 
the applicant provided also summary tables calculating exposure-adjusted incidence rates (EAIRs) and 
cumulative  incidence  proportions  at  Week  8,  24  and  48.  The  AEs  assessed  based  on  the  EAIRs  were 
consistent for both the asciminib 40 mg b.i.d. Safety Pool and the asciminib All Patients Safety Pool and 
were generally also consistent with the asciminib treatment group in Study A2301. However, the EAIR 
for the asciminib 80 mg q.d. treatment group in the Study X2101 was significantly higher (AEs 1557.9; 
treatment related AEs 255.4) in comparison to other groups/safety pools. 
Table 26 
Overview of adverse events by EAIR – Safety set (cut-off date 6-Jan-2021) 
In the pivotal study A2301, the SOCs in which AEs were reported more frequently in asciminib group (≥
10%  difference  relative  to  the  bosutinib  group)  were  infections  and  infestations  (+16.0%), 
musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (+12.2%),  and  nervous  system  disorders  (+11.6%) 
and vascular disorders (+10.0%) On the other hand, AEs were less frequently reported in the asciminib 
group relative to bosutinib group for the SOCs of GI disorders (-38.6%) and investigations (-19.2%). 
All patients who were treated with asciminib 80 mg q.d. in the study X2101 had at least one AE, and in 
majority of patients (88.9%) AEs reported were treatment-related. The incidence of AEs in majority of 
SOC was much higher than for the asciminib 40 mg b.i.d group in pivotal study.  
In  Responses  to  D120  LoQ,  the  applicant  presented  both  the  detailed  descriptive  analysis  of  adverse 
events by dose cohort in the Study X2101, as well as the comprehensive exposure-safety analysis (data 
not shown here). 
AEs by preferred term 
Thrombocytopenia  (23.1%),  neutropenia  (19.2%),  headache  (18.6%),  fatigue  (13.5%).  arthralgia 
(12.2%),  hypertension  (12.2%),  diarrhoea  (11.5%),  nausea  (11.5%),  and  nasopharyngitis  (10.9%) 
were the AEs (all grades, regardless of study treatment relationship) that occurred most frequently (≥ 
10%) in the asciminib treatment group in the Study A2301. The most frequently (≥ 10%) reported AEs 
in the bosutinib treatment group included diarrhoea (71.1%), nausea (46.1%), ALT increase (28.9%), 
vomiting (26.3%), rash (23.7%), AST increase (21.1%), neutropenia (17.1%), abdominal pain (15.8%), 
headache (14.5%), and thrombocytopenia (14.5%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022

In the asciminib treatment group, 54.5% of the patients had at least one grade ≥ 3 AE with the majority 
of  the  grade  ≥  3  AEs  occurring  in  either  1  or  2  patients  per  preferred  term.  The  incidence  of  most 
frequently occurring grade ≥ 3 AEs (≥ 5%) were thrombocytopenia (17.9%), neutropenia (15.4%), and 
hypertension (5.8%). The incidence of grade ≥ 3 AEs (regardless of study treatment relationship) was 
lower in the asciminib treatment group, relative to bosutinib treatment group (54.5% vs. 67.1%). 
All patients who received 80 mg q.d. dose in the Study X2101 had experienced at least one AE. The most 
frequently reported AEs (all grades) were upper respiratory tract infection (44.4%; 8 patients), fatigue 
(38.9%;  7  patients),  headache  (33.3%),  arthralgia  (33.3%),  hypertension  (33.3%),  and  diarrhoea 
(33.3%). Except for hypertension (22.2%; 4 patients) and lipase increase (16.7%; 3 patients), all grade 
≥ 3 AEs were reported infrequently in either 1 or 2 patients. 
For  Asciminib  Safety  pools,  in  general,  the  nature  and  frequency  of  the  AEs  were  largely  consistent 
(difference of ≤ 10%) with those from the asciminib treatment group in Study A2301. Higher incidence 
(of ≥ 10%) was observed for lipase increase (+13.2%) in the asciminib All Patients Safety Pool compared 
to asciminib treatment group in Study A2301.

Treatment-related AEs 
In  the  study  A2301,  similar  to  the  previous  data  presented,  proportion  of  patients  having  treatment 
related  AEs  was  lower  in  asciminib  treatment  group  (66.0%)  compared  to  bosutinib  treatment  group 
(89.5%). The most frequently reported AEs associated with asciminib therapy were thrombocytopenia 
(19.9%), neutropenia (15.4 %) and headache (9.0%). Adverse event that was reported more frequently 
in the asciminib group (with a ≥ 5% difference relative to the bosutinib group) was thrombocytopenia 
(+5.4%). The incidence of grade ≥ 3 treatment related AEs were 50.0% and 29.5% in the bosutinib and 
asciminib treatment groups respectively with thrombocytopenia and neutropenia being most frequent in 
asciminib treatment group and ALT increased, diarrhoea, neutropenia in bosutinib treatment group.  
In the Study X2101 80 mg q.d., majority of the patients (88.9%; 16/18 patients) had treatment related 
AEs.  The  most  frequently  reported  were  fatigue  and  thrombocytopenia  (each  27.8%;  5  patients).  4 
Assessment report

patients (22.2%) had lipase increased. For comparison in the 40 mg b.i.d safety pool, lipase increased 
was reported in 9.1% of patients.  Eleven patients (66.7%; 12/18 patients) had grade ≥ 3 AEs which 
were suspected to be study treatment related. 
The frequently reported suspected AEs (all grades and grade ≥ 3) and their incidence in both the asciminib 
40 mg b.i.d. Safety Pool and the asciminib All Patients Safety Pool were largely similar (difference of ≤ 
10%) with those observed in the asciminib treatment group in Study A2301, except for lipase increased 
in asciminib All Patients Safety Pool (+10.8%). 
Majority of the AEs reported in the asciminib and bosutinib groups (76.9% vs. 85.5%) occurred within 
the first 2 months of start of the treatment. The incidence rate of AEs decreased over time (post 8 weeks 
and up to 24 weeks) with the exception of incidence of haematological AEs that remained same, and 
higher incidence of ALT/AST increase and lipase increase in the bosutinib group. 
ADRs 
In the Study A2301, the most frequent ADRs occurring in asciminib treatment group with an incidence 
rate  of  ≥  20%  were  thrombocytopenia  (29.5%),  neutropenia  (23.1%),  and  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection  (24.4%).  The  most  frequent  grade  ≥   3  ADRs,  with  an  incidence  rate  of  ≥   5%,  were 
thrombocytopenia (22.4%), neutropenia (18.6%), and hypertension (5.8%). 
All patients in the Study X2101 (asciminib 80 mg q.d.) experienced at least one ADR and 13 patients 
experienced  at  least  one  grade  ≥  3  ADR.  The  most  frequent  ADRs  (all  grades)  occurring  in  asciminib 
treatment group with an incidence rate of ≥ 20% were upper respiratory tract infection, musculoskeletal 
pain  and  fatigue  (each  44.4%),  thrombocytopenia  and  dyslipidemia  (each  33.3%),  headache, 
hypertension,  abdominal  pain  and  pancreatic  enzyme  increase  (each  27.8%),  neutropenia,  anaemia, 
dizziness, nausea, diarrhoea, rash, arthralgia (each 22.2%). 
As to the asciminib safety pools, the incidence of majority of the ADRs was similar to the ADRs observed 
in  Study  A2301,  the  ADRs  with  a  higher  incidence  of  ≥  20%  were  musculoskeletal  pain  (36.2%), 
thrombocytopenia  (27.5%),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (28.1%),  fatigue  (25.8%),  headache 
(23.6%) and pancreatic enzyme increase (21.3%). 
Of note, in several categories the frequency of ARDs has shifted to a higher frequency category due to 
the fact that frequency in Asciminib All patients safety pool was higher than in the pivotal study (40 mg 
b.i,d treatment group). 
AEs of special interest 
The  AESIs 
identified  with  asciminib 
treatment  are:  myelosuppression,  pancreatic 
toxicity, 
hypersensitivity,  hepatotoxicity,  hepatitis  B  virus  reactivation,  reproductive  toxicity,  GI  toxicity, 
phototoxicity, QTc prolongation, cardiac failure, edema and fluid retention, ischemic heart disease and 
CNS conditions, and haemorrhage. 
The key categories of AESI with similar incidence between the asciminib group and the bosutinib group 
in  Study  A2301  were:  myelosuppression  (37.8%  vs.  36.8%,  with  the  exception  of  thrombocytopenia 
(part of the myelosuppression grouped AESIs; 29.5% vs. 19.7%), pancreatic toxicity (8.3% vs. 9.2%), 
and  QTc  prolongation  (3.8%  vs.  1.3%).  Hypersensitivity  related  events  (19.2%  vs.  34.2%),  and 
hepatotoxicity events (including laboratory terms) (9.0% vs. 31.6%) are less frequently reported in the 
asciminib group compared to the bosutinib group.  
In Study X2101 80 mg q.d. dose group, myelosuppression, pancreatic toxicity, hypersensitivity, and QTc 
prolongation were reported in 44.4%, 27.8%, 38.9%, and 22.2% of patients, respectively. 
Myelosuppression  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 93/128 
 
 
 
Myelosuppression-related events are very common during TKI treatment and are considered to be due 
to  the  combined  effect  of  suppression  of  the  leukemic  clone  and  inhibition  of  non-leukemic 
haematopoiesis. 
In Study A2301, the incidence of myelosuppression-related events was comparable in both treatment 
groups  (37.8%  vs.  36.8%  in  the  asciminib  and  bosutinib  groups  respectively)  with  the  exception  of 
thrombocytopenia (part of the myelosuppression grouped AESIs; 29.5% vs. 19.7%). Events leading to 
treatment  discontinuation  were  infrequent  (3.8%  vs.  5.3%).  Thrombocytopenia  was  more  frequently 
observed  in  the  asciminib  group  (see  above),  but  was  generally  manageable  with  dose 
adjustments/interruptions and required treatment discontinuations in only a small proportion of patients 
(3.2% vs. 1.3%). 
Eight  of  18  patients  (44.4%)  in  the  80  mg  q.d.  group  had  myelosuppression-related  events,  with  3 
patients having grade ≥ 3 events. The overall incidence of myelosuppression events in both asciminib 
Safety Pools was mostly consistent with that reported for the asciminib group in Study A2301. 
Myelosuppression related events are generally reversible and manageable with appropriate monitoring, 
and dose interruption/modification. 
The  overall  incidence  of  thrombocytopenia  (all  grades)  was  higher  in  the  asciminib  treatment  group 
(28.8%)  relative  to  the  bosutinib  treatment  group  (18.4%).  The  cumulative  incidence  of 
thrombocytopenia events was higher at week 8 (by 11.9%) and at Week 24 (by 9.8%) in the asciminib 
treatment group compared to the bosutinib treatment group. Thrombocytopenia events were suspected 
to be treatment related (per investigator determination) in 24.4% and 17.1% of patients in the asciminib 
and the bosutinib treatment groups, respectively. 
Grade ≥ 3 events were reported in higher proportion of patients in the asciminib treatment group relative 
to  the  bosutinib  treatment  group  (21.8%  vs.  9.2%).  The  incidence  of  SAEs  was  low  (1.3%)  in  the 
asciminib treatment group and none in the bosutinib treatment group. Five patients (3.2%) discontinued 
the study drug due to thrombocytopenia in the asciminib treatment group compared to 1 patient (1.3%) 
in the bosutinib treatment group. Dose interruptions were required in 18.6% in the asciminib and 9.2% 
in the bosutinib treatment group. Despite a higher frequency of thrombocytopenia in the asciminib group, 
the frequency of haemorrhage was relatively similar between asciminib and bosutinib (10.3% vs 9.2%). 
The EAIR for thrombocytopenia, was 37.1 per 100 PTY in the asciminib treatment group and 31.5 per 
100 PTY in the bosutinib treatment group. 
Pancreatic toxicity 
The pancreas was identified as a toxicity target organ in nonclinical studies. The mechanism of action of 
pancreatitis is not completely understood at this time. In Study A2301, pancreatic toxicity AEs occurred 
in 8.3% of patients in the asciminib group and 9.2% in the bosutinib group. All pancreatic events were 
related  to  laboratory  findings  (lipase/amylase  increases)  with  no  co-existing  clinical  events.  None  of 
events were considered as serious. 
In the asciminib 80 mg q.d. group, 1 patient had pancreatitis (suspected). Three patients (1.6%) in the 
40  mg  b.i.d.  Safety  Pool  and  9  patients  (2.5%)  in  the  asciminib  All  Patients  Safety  Pool  experienced 
clinical  events  of  pancreatitis  or  acute  pancreatitis  (all  suspected).  Two  patients  discontinued  study 
treatment (1 × pancreatitis and 1 × acute pancreatitis).  
Overall, pancreatic toxicity events (including clinical events) were of low severity and were reversible; 
and were managed by dose reduction or interruptions.  
Caution is nevertheless recommended in patients with previous history of pancreatitis and a warning has 
been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.

Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity represents a known risk with approved TKIs. As hypersensitivity events can potentially 
be life-threatening, patients with known allergies to TKIs were excluded from Study A2301. 
In  Study  A2301,  hypersensitivity  events  (including  skin  reactions)  were  seen  less  frequently  in  the 
asciminib group (19.2% vs. 34.2% in the bosutinib group) and no patient discontinued treatment with 
asciminib due to hypersensitivity. In the asciminib 80 mg q.d. dose group, 7 patients had hypersensitivity 
events (all skin disorders). Within the asciminib All Patients Safety Pool, with the exception of 2 index 
cases (bronchospasm and hypersensitivity) in Study X2101, the majority of hypersensitivity events were 
skin disorders (primarily rash), that were either mild or moderate (grade 1/2) in nature, were transient, 
and were manageable. 
Hepatotoxicity 
In  Study  A2301  the  incidence  of  hepatotoxicity  events  (including  laboratory  terms)  was  lower  in  the 
asciminib  treatment  group  (8.3%)  compared  to  the  bosutinib  treatment  group  (30.3%).  No  clinical 
events related to hepatotoxicity AESI were reported, only laboratory/enzyme elevations were noted. The 
incidence  of  the  most  frequently  occurring  events:  ALT  increase  and  AST  increase  were  lower  in  the 
asciminib  treatment  group  (each  3.8%)  compared  to  bosutinib  treatment  group  (27.6%  and  21.1% 
respectively).   
Hepatitis B virus infection reactivation 
One patient in the asciminib All Patients Safety Pool, had hepatitis B  virus infection reactivation. This 
patient was from the Study X2101, 120 mg q.d. dose cohort and had grade 1 event of viral hepatitis 
carrier, which was considered as a SAE. 
Reproductive toxicity 
Nonclinical studies provide evidence towards foetal malformation due to in-utero exposure to asciminib. 
Information  regarding  the  human  implications  are  not  available  due  to  limited  exposure  in  this 
population.  
In  study  A2301  three  patients  (1.9%)  in  the  asciminib  treatment  group  and  1  patient  (1.3%)  in  the 
bosutinib treatment group had reproductive toxicity events. The reproductive toxicity events reported in 
the  asciminib  treatment  group  were  spontaneous  abortion  and  maternal  exposure  during  pregnancy 
(both grade 3 and both occurring in the same patient), a congenital cardiovascular anomaly (1 patient) 
and maternal exposure during pregnancy (post confirmation of pregnancy, patient opted for an elective 
termination by mifepriston). These events therefore were not related to any inborn anomaly detected in 
a newborn of a patient treated with the study drugs. 
Gastrointestinal toxicity 
Overall,  GI  toxicity  events  occurred  in  a  considerably  lower  proportion  of  patients  in  the  asciminib 
treatment group (31.4%) compared to the bosutinib treatment group (78.9%). 
There were no fatal GI toxicity events. Neither of the treatment groups had any grade 4 events. Grade 
≥ 3 events were reported in 1.9% of patients in the asciminib treatment group and 11.8% of patients in 
the bosutinib treatment group. Serious AEs were noted in 2 patients (1 patient with non-cardiac chest 
pain and the second patient with vomiting and nausea) in the asciminib treatment group and 1 patient 
(vomiting) in the bosutinib treatment group. No patient discontinued in the asciminib treatment group 
compared to 2 patients (2.6%) in the bosutinib treatment group who discontinued study treatment due 
to GI toxicity events. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 95/128 
 
 
 
In Study X2101 (asciminib 80 mg q.d. dose group) eleven of 18 patients had events related to GI toxicity. 
Two patients had a grade 3 event and one SAE (vomiting). 
Ischemic heart and CNS conditions 
Cases  of  ischemic  heart  and  CNS  conditions  were  reported  in  9  and  4  patients  in  the  asciminib  and 
bosutinib treatment groups, respectively. Of note, 3 patients in the asciminib treatment group had new 
events at the follow-up cut-off date 06-Jan-2021 as compared to previous cut-off date (25-May-2020) 
cerebral infarction (grade 3), myocardial infarction (grade 1) and CPK increase (grade 4). 
Three  patients  in  the  asciminib  treatment  group  (blood  creatine  phosphokinase  increase,  myocardial 
infraction  and  cerebral  infarction)  and  1  patient  in  the  bosutinib  treatment  group  (blood  creatine 
phosphokinase  increase)  had  events  suspected  to  be  in  treatment  related  (per  investigator’s 
assessment). 
One patient experienced a fatal ischemic stroke (which was not considered to be treatment related by 
the investigator, medical history included hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy as per ECG) and 
leading to patient discontinuation. 
Overall, 36 patients (10.1%) in asciminib all patients safety pool has ischemic heart and CNS condition 
events. 
The observed incidence of ischemic heart and CNS condition events could be explained by the multiple 
confounding factors/underlying conditions in these patients and the role of asciminib in the development 
of these events is not possible to determine at this point.  
An updated information on ischemic heart and CNS conditions, based on the updated Safety Pool with 
Week 96 cut-off date (06-Oct-2021) has been provided. Two additional events (i.e., Troponin increased, 
Vascular graft occlusion) were included in the updated Week 96 output and presented. Due to MedDRA 
version update, the PT “arterial bypass occlusion” was demoted to a LLT, and is linked to a PT “vascular 
graft occlusion”. The patient presented is not a new patient with PT (narrative provided as part of X2101 
primary analysis CSR) but this patient is now captured as part of the ischemic heart and CNS output due 
to  a  MedDRA  version  change  from  23.1  to  24.1.  The  event  of  troponin  increase  was  not  related  to 
asciminib by the investigator, there was no dose change and the patient recovered the same day.   
Overall, the frequency of ischemic heart and CNS conditions was comparable in asciminib and bosutinib 
treatment group in the study A2301 (6.4% vs 5.3%; EIAR per 100PTY 3.8% vs 5.9%).  
Cardiac failure 
In the Study A2301 asciminib 40 mg b.i.d. dose, cardiac failure occurred in 1.3% (2 patients) and 1.3% 
(1 patients; grade 3) in the asciminib treatment group and the bosutinib treatment group, respectively, 
with no risk difference between groups. The cardiac events in the asciminib treatment group were cardiac 
failure and ejection fraction decrease (each occurring in 1 patient); both were of grade 3 severity and 
were considered as SAEs. Three of 18 patients in the Study X2101 (asciminib 80 mg q.d. dose group) 
had events related to cardiac failure with all 3 patients having grade ≥ 3 events. All were considered as 
SAEs and all required medication or therapy. As of updated data cut-off date 06-Jan-2021, one additional 
patient (congestive hepatopathy, ejection fraction decreased) had cardiac failure event in the asciminib 
All Patients Safety Pool (200 mg b.i.d.). 40 days after the last dose of asciminib (discontinuation due to 
COVID 19 pneumonia), the patient died due to pneumonia. The occurrence of heart failure reported in 
patients receiving asciminib was strongly confounded by predisposing classic cardiovascular risks. 
QTc prolongation 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 96/128 
 
 
 
 
In Study A2301, QTc prolongation related events were reported in 4 patients in the asciminib group and 
1 patient in the bosutinib group. No grade 4 events were reported and none of the events led to study 
discontinuation. In the asciminib group, two cases of ECG QTc prolonged were reported as AEs; one of 
these  patients  experienced  QTcF  >  500  ms  with  >  60  ms  increase  –  the  event  resolved  with  dose 
interruption and did not reoccur after asciminib was resumed at the reduced dose of 20 mg b.i.d. 
At therapeutic doses, asciminib appears not to have a relevant effect on cardiac repolarization as the 
estimated mean and upper bound of the 90% CIs ΔQTcF at 40 mg b.i.d., 80 mg q.d., 200 mg b.i.d. and 
at the HCRE (which is the worst case scenario for Cmax at 200 mg b.i.d.) were below 10 ms, which is 
the threshold that is considered clinically significant.  
The findings for the assessment of QT prolongation showed an asciminib dose dependent increase in the 
QT  prolongation,  although  not  clinically  significant  in  the  therapeutic  doses.    These  QT  prolongation 
findings are addressed in the current proposed SmPC and RMP.  
Cardiac arrhythmias 
The EAIR for cardiac arrhythmias was similar between patients in the bosutinib (EAIR = 4.7, 3 patients 
of 76) and the asciminib (EAIR = 5.1, 10 of 156 patients) 40 mg b.i.d. arms in Study A2301 as well as 
in the asciminib 40 mg b.i.d. (EAIR = 5.0, 15 of 187 patients) and asciminib All patients (EAIR = 6.8, 
48 of 356 patients) Safety Pools.  
In the Study A2301 asciminib 40 mg b.i.d arm, ten (6.4%) patients reported the following arrhythmia 
PTs: palpitations (four (2.6%) patients); electrocardiogram QT prolonged, syncope (two (1.3%) patients 
each); tachycardia, bradycardia, sinus bradycardia, arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, ventricular tachycardia, 
heart rate decreased (one (0.6%) patient each). The following additional arrhythmias were identified in 
the asciminib 40 mg b.i.d. and asciminib All patients Safety Pools only: Atrial fibrillation (two (1.1%) and 
seven  (2.0%)  patients,  respectively);  cardiac  flutter,  sinus  tachycardia  (one  (0.5%  and  0.3%, 
respectively) patient each). The following arrhythmias were identified in the asciminib All patients Safety 
Pool  only:    Bundle  branch  block  right,  extrasystoles,  heart  rate  irregular,  sinus  arrhythmia, 
supraventricular tachycardia, tachyarrhythmia, ventricular extrasystoles (one (0.3%) patient each).  
Treatment-related arrhythmias as assessed by the investigator occurred in four (2.6%) patients in the 
asciminib 40 mg b.i.d. arm of Study A2301, in six (3.2%) patients in the asciminib 40 mg b.i.d. patient 
Safety  Pool,  and  in  13  (3.7%)  patients  in  the  asciminib  All  patients  Safety  Pool.  Treatment-related 
arrhythmias  which  occurred  in  ≥2  patients  in  either  of  the  groups  were  palpitations,  atrial  fibrillation, 
electrocardiogram QT prolonged, and tachycardia. 
Grade 3 arrhythmias occurred as follows:  
Two (1.3%) patients with the reported PTs of syncope and electrocardiogram QT prolonged (one (0.6) 
patient each) from the asciminib 40 mg b.i.d. arm of Study A2301;  
three  (1.6%)  patients  with  the  reported  PTs  of  atrial  fibrillation,  syncope,  and  electrocardiogram  QT 
prolonged (one (0.5%) patient each) in the asciminib 40 mg b.i.d Safety Pool;  
eleven (3.1%) patients with the reported PTs of atrial fibrillation (four (1.1%) patients); syncope (three 
(0.8%)  patients);  and  arrythmia,  electrocardiogram  QT  prolonged,  extrasystoles,  tachyarrhythmia, 
ventricular tachycardia (one (0.3%) patient each) in the asciminib All patients Safety Pool.  
Grade 4 arrhythmias occurred in one (0.6%) patient with the reported PT of cardiac arrest originating 
from the 40 mg b.i.d. arm of Study A2301; the same patient was represented in the asciminib 40 mg 
b.i.d. (0.5%) and All patients (0.3%) Safety Pools. 
Grade  5  arrhythmias  occurred  in  one  (0.3%)  patient  with  the  reported  PT  of  cardiac  arrest  in  the 
asciminib All patients Safety Pool and represented a patient from Study X2101. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 97/128 
 
 
 
Arrhythmias reported as SAEs occurred as follows: One (0.6%) patient with the reported PT of cardiac 
arrest originating from the 40 mg b.i.d. arm of  Study A2301; two (1.1%) patients reported the PTs of  
atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrest (one (0.5%) patient each) from the asciminib 40 mg b.i.d. Safety 
Pool; seven (2.0%) patients reported the PTs atrial fibrillation (three (0.8%) patients),  cardiac arrest 
(two  (0.6%)  patients),  and  arrhythmia  and    ventricular  tachycardia  (one  (0.3%)  patient each)  in  the 
asciminib All patients Safety Pool. 
Oedema and fluid retention 
Oedema and fluid retention adverse events were reported in 8.3% (13 patients) and 7.9% (6 patients) 
in the asciminib and bosutinib treatment groups, respectively, and most patients experienced grade 1 or 
2 events.   
Four of 18 patients in the Study X2101 (asciminib 80 mg q.d. dose group) had events related to oedema 
and fluid retention however none having grade ≥ 3 events. 
The  edema  and  fluid  retention  events  in  the  asciminib  40  mg  b.i.d.  Safety  Pool  were  consistent  with 
those in the asciminib treatment group in Study A2301, whereas the incidence was higher (+6.9%) in 
the  asciminib  All  Patients  Safety  Pool  (15.2%),  compared  to  the  asciminib  treatment  group  in  Study 
A2301 (8.3%). As of updated data cut-off date 06-Jan-2021, two additional patients (pleural effusion 
(grade 3 and oedema peripheral (grade 2)) had oedema and fluid retention events in the asciminib All 
Patients Safety Pool. 
Relevant events related to edema and fluid retention (oedema, including oedema peripheral, and pleural 
effusion) are already listed as ADRs of ‘common’ frequency in Section 4.8 of the proposed SmPC. 
Phototoxicity 
In the asciminib 40 mg b.i.d. Safety Pool, 2 patients (1.1%) and in the asciminib All Patients Safety Pool 
12 patients (3.4%) had phototoxicity events. None of these events was of grade ≥ 3 severity and none 
was SAE. Events in the asciminib 40 mg b.i.d. Safety Pool were photosensitivity reaction and sunburn 
(each  in  1  patient),  of  which  photosensitivity  reaction  was  suspected  to  be treatment  related  (by  the 
investigator). The events in the asciminib All Patients Safety Pool were photosensitivity reaction (2.5%; 
9 patients), sunburn (0.8%; 3 patients) and retinal phototoxicity (0.3%, 1 patient). Treatment-related 
AEs were noted in 6 patients (5 patients with photosensitivity and 1 retinal phototoxicity).  
No  new  photosensitivity/phototoxicity  findings  were reported  in  the  Week  96  cut-off  data  from  Study 
A2301. 
Haemorrhage 
In the pivotal study, haemorrhage events occurred with relatively similar incidence (+2.3%) in patients 
in the asciminib and the bosutinib treatment groups, despite the fact that thrombocytopenia was much 
more frequently observed in asciminib treatment group. No pattern for a specific site of bleeding has 
been identified. 
2.6.9.  Serious adverse events, deaths, and other significant events 
2.6.9.1.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events were reported in a lower proportion of patients in the asciminib treatment group 
(15.4%) compared to the bosutinib treatment group (23.7%). The incidence of SAEs (by PTs) suspected 
to be treatment related was also lower in the asciminib treatment group compared to the bosutinib arm. 
Overall,  the  number  of  individual  SAEs  in  the  pivotal  study  was  too  low  to  conclude  on  the  trend.  In 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 98/128 
 
 
 
asciminib Safety Pool A (All Patients) pleural effusion and pneumonia were reported in 9 and 8 patients, 
respectively, and all cases of pneumonia were grade 3.  
Overall, 5 deaths occurred in the pivotal study A2301, 4 in asciminib and 1 in bosutinib treatment group. 
On-treatment deaths were reported for 3 patients with a similar frequency between treatment groups: 
2  patients  (1.3%)  in  the  asciminib  treatment  group  (embolism  arterial  and  ischaemic  stroke)  and  1 
(1.3%) in the bosutinib treatment group (septic shock). Although, deaths in the asciminib group were 
not  suspected  to  be  study  treatment-related,  as  discussed  before,  under  ischemic  heart  and  CNS 
conditions the role of asciminib in the development of these events is not possible to completely rule out 
at this point. Similarities to ponatinib may be discussed. 
In Study X2101 asciminib 80 mg q.d. dose one on-treatment death has occurred due to cardiac arrest 
and wasn’t either reported as treatment related, however, as commented above, whether or not there 
was a connection with the asciminib treatment is still considered uncertain.  
Overall, 14 patients died in the asciminib All Patients Safety pool, including two patients who died due 
to COVID-19. 
2.6.9.2.  Laboratory findings 
Haematological abnormalities, as was expected were very commonly experienced by the patients in all 
treatment groups. Most common AEs was thrombocytopenia in asciminib treatment groups and anaemia 
in bosutinib treatment group.  
In Study A2301, the incidences of new or worsened grade 3 hematologic laboratory abnormalities were 
similar (difference < 5%) in both the treatment groups. Incidence of grade 4 were higher (difference > 
5%) in the asciminib treatment group for platelets decrease (+6.5%) and neutrophils decrease (+6.1%) 
relative to the bosutinib treatment group. 
Study  X2101  asciminib  80  mg  dose  group:  The  most  frequently  (≥  40%)  noted  new  or  worsened 
hematologic  laboratory  abnormalities  (all  grades)  were  lymphocytes  decrease  (50%)  and  platelets 
decrease (44.4%).  
All the post-baseline hematologic laboratory abnormalities in both the asciminib 40 mg b.i.d. Safety Pool 
and the asciminib All Patients Safety Pool were consistent with those in the asciminib treatment group 
in Study A2301, with the exception of lymphocytes decrease; 17.1% in the asciminib treatment group 
in Study A2301 and 38.6% in the asciminib All Patients Safety Pool.

Assessment report

New or worsened post-baseline clinical chemistry laboratory abnormalities occurred in similar proportions 
of patients in the two treatment groups, with only few notable differences. Most of these abnormalities 
were mild-to-moderate (grade 1 or 2) in both treatment group. 
The most frequently (≥ 40%) noted new or worsened post-baseline biochemical laboratory abnormalities 
(all grades) in patients receiving 80 mg q.d. dose were pancreatic lipase increase, phosphate decrease 
(each  55.6%),  triglycerides  increase  (52.9%),  and  potassium  increase  (50.0%).  Except  for  grade  3 
phosphate  decrease  and  grade  4  urate  increase  each  (16.7%;  n=3),  new  or  worsened  post-baseline 
biochemical laboratory abnormalities grade ≥ 3 were only seen in either 1 or 2 patients. 
The biochemical laboratory abnormalities which were noted with ≥ 10% higher incidence in the asciminib 
All Patients Safety Pool compared to asciminib treatment group in Study A2301 were pancreatic lipase 
increase  (+19%),  potassium  increase  (+17.9%),  phosphate  decrease  (+17.4%),  ALT  increase 
(+13.1%), albumin decrease (+12.6%) AST increase (+11.3%), calcium corrected decrease (+11.2%) 
and amylase increase (+11%). The longer exposure to asciminib treatment in Study X2101 than in Study 
A2301 is claimed to be the reason for these higher frequencies.

Triglycerides increase was noted in >50% of patients in both the treatment groups (70.5% vs. 53.9% 
in the asciminib and bosutinib treatment group respectively). 
Hyperglycaemia was more frequently reported as AEs in patients on asciminib (in 83.3% of patients vs. 
68.4% in the bosutinib arm), However, after treatment initiation, worsening of glycated hemoglobin was 
observed with similar frequency in patients on bosutinib (5.8%) vs. asciminib (4.9%).  
The majority of glucose concentration increases were grade 1/2 and did not result in HbA1c increase.

The number of patients ≥65 years of age in the pivotal Study A2301 (n=29) and the number of patients 
≥75 years of age in the All patients Safety Pool (n=21) were low. 
The proportion of patients having treatment related AEs in Study A2301 was higher (+18.6%) in 18 to 
<  65  years  (66.9%)  age  category  compared  to  ≥  65  years  (48.3%)  age  category.  The  proportion  of 
patients  having  AEs  requiring  additional  therapy  was  higher  (+16.3%)  in  ≥  65  years  (79.3%)  age 
category compared to 18 to < 65 years (63.0%) age category. The incidence of SAEs and AEs leading 
to discontinuation were higher (>10% difference) in the 65-74 year old age group compared to the <65 
year old age group.  
The  incidence  of  majority  of  AEs  in  both  the  age  subgroups  in  the  asciminib  arm  were  consistent 
(difference of < 10%). Largest differences were observed in the incidence of (cerebro)vascular disorders 
and accidents and injuries, as could be expected to increase with advanced age. No new, age specific 
safety risks were identified in the elderly population (65-74 vs. <65 years of age) treated with asciminib. 
Due to the low numbers, no meaningful conclusions could be drawn in the >75 year-old age categories. 
Gender 
The overall safety was similar for both genders in the asciminib and bosutinib treatment groups in Study 
A2301. However, in the asciminib treatment group higher incidence of AEs suspected to be treatment 
related was observed in females (74.7%) compared to males (53.1%) and higher incidence AEs requiring 
additional therapy was observed in females (74.7%) compared to males (58.0%); whereas for the AEs 
(grade  ≥  3)  males  (55.6%)  had  a  higher  frequency  compared  to  females  (45.3%).  In  the  bosutinib 
treatment group, females had higher incidence of grade ≥ 3 treatment related AEs compared to males 
(55.6% vs. 41.9%). 
Race 
No clinically relevant differences were observed amongst ethnic sub-groups. However, due to small sub-
group size the data should be interpreted with caution. 
Safety in patients with Ph+ CML-CP harbouring the T315I mutation 
Patients with a T315I “gatekeeper” mutation were excluded from the pivotal study as bosutinib has no 
inhibitory activity against this mutation. Protocol Amendment  9 of supportive study X2101 incorporated 
an expansion of Arm 1 to further assess asciminib as a single agent in patients with Ph+ CML-CP or -AP 
harbouring the T315I mutation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 103/128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, 70 patients with CML-CP harboring the T315I mutation were treated with asciminib single agent 
across 10 dose levels (10 to 200 mg b.i.d. and 80 to 200 mg q.d.), and the median duration of exposure 
was 80.8 weeks (84.3% were exposed for at least 24 weeks).  
In 48 patients treated with asciminib 200 mg b.i.d., which is the RDE for this population, the median 
duration of exposure was 69.8 weeks (83.3% were exposed for at least 24 weeks). Results summarized 
below represent data from 200 mg b.i.d. cohort.  
All  48  patients  (100%)  had  at  least  one  AE  during  the  study.  Fatigue  (29.2%),  nausea  (27.1%), 
diarrhoea and increased lipase (20.8% each) were the most frequent AEs. Grade ≥3 AEs were reported 
in 56.3% of patients. SAEs were reported in 10/48 (20.8%) patients, of whom 1/48 (2.1%) had a SAE 
that was suspected to be treatment related. SAEs were infrequent with no event reported in more than 
2 patients. Study treatment discontinuation due to AEs was reported in 3/48 (6.3%) patients including 
2/48 (4.2%) patients with AEs that were suspected to be treatment related. Pancytopenia and increased 
lipase (both treatment related) and thrombocytosis were the AEs that led to treatment discontinuation 
in one patient each. 
Renal impairment 
There  is  a  limited  safety  data  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  and  no  patient  with  severe  renal 
impairment  was  included  in  the  asciminib  studies.  From  the  safety  data  of  the  pivotal  (A2301)  and 
supportive study (X2101) a worse safety profile for patients with moderate renal impairment compared 
to  patients  with  normal  renal  function  or  mild  renal impairment  may  be  suggested.  Grade  ≥3 events, 
SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation were reported with higher frequencies. Due to the small sample 
size (n=10 in pivotal study and n=30 in Asciminib all safety pool) these results should be interpreted 
with caution.  
The effect of renal impairment on the PK of asciminib is extensively discussed in PK section of this report, 
in  particularly  the  comparability  of  asciminib  80  mg  q.d.  vs  40  mg  b.i.d  dose.  The  median  predicted 
AUC0-24  and  Cmax  for  severely  impaired  patients  are  60%  and  40%  higher  than  that  of  a  typical 
individual with normal renal function, respectively, for either a dose of 80 mg q.d. or 40 mg b.i.d. The 
applicant concluded that this difference in median AUC or Cmax in subjects with normal and severe renal 
impairment is not considered to be clinically relevant given the relatively flat exposure-safety relationship 
over  a  5-fold  difference  in  exposure.  Furthermore,  glucuronidation  amounts  only  up  to  7%  of  the 
elimination. Based on this, inhibition of M30.5 formation due to renal impairment status is considered to 
be not clinically relevant. According to the applicant that no dose adjustment is needed for subjects with 
renal impairment, including severe renal impairment.  
Hepatic impairment 
The applicant recommends no dose adjustment based on results from a dedicated hepatic impairment 
study [Study A2103], considering results of this study showed no relevant impact of mild or moderate 
hepatic impairment on the PK of asciminib. Asciminib AUCinf was increased by 22%, 3% and 66% in 
subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to subjects with 
normal hepatic function, following oral administration of a single 40 mg dose of asciminib. 
Patients with mild hepatic impairment were included in the development program of asciminib. At the 
06-Jan-2021 cut-off date, the data showed that the safety in patients with mild hepatic impairment was 
comparable to patients with normal hepatic function. When analysing AESIs, although most of the safety 
topics of interest were well balanced between the subgroups in both 40 mg b.i.d. Safety  Pool and All 
patients  Safety  Pool,  myelosuppression  and  Pancreatic  toxicity-laboratory  events  were  reported  with 
>10% higher incidence in the mild hepatic impairment group compared to the group of patients with 
normal hepatic function. The relevance of this finding is hard to assess, considering the low number of 
patients with mild hepatic impairment at baseline (47 out of 345 patients in the All patients Safety Pool).

Reassuring is that no increase of hepatic toxicity clinical events was detected in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment, the events were with low frequency and were well balanced between the subgroups. 
Furthermore, in clinical studies with asciminib the majority of the reported events were mild to moderate, 
reversible hepatic enzyme or bilirubin level abnormalities, with no evidence of irreversible liver damage 
with the use of asciminib monotherapy for treatment of CML
CP/AP. There was no case related to DILI 
(drug induced liver injury) and none of the reported events were fatal or life-threatening. 
‑
Paediatric population 
No  clinical  study  with  asciminib  has  been  completed  in  children  so  far.  A  PIP  has  been  agreed  for 
asciminib. 
Pregnancy, birth, and lactation 
Based on findings from animal studies and it's mechanism of action, asciminib can cause foetal harm 
when  administered  to  a  pregnant  woman.  The  pregnancy  status  of  females  of  reproductive  potential 
should be verified prior to starting treatment with asciminib. Asciminib can be used during pregnancy 
only if the expected benefit to the patient justifies the potential risk to the foetus. However, sexually-
active  females  of  reproductive  potential  should  use  effective  contraception  during  treatment  with 
asciminib  and  for  at  least  3  days  after  the  last  dose.  The  risk  for  adverse  effects  to  a  developing 
embryo/foetus in female partner of male patients is negligible and male contraception use is not required. 
It is not known whether asciminib is transferred into human milk after administration. There are no 
data on the effects of asciminib on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential 
for serious adverse drug reactions in the breastfed child, breastfeeding is not recommended during 
treatment and for at least 3 days after stopping treatment with asciminib. 
2.6.9.4.  Immunological events 
In preclinical studies with asciminib no signs of immunotoxicity were seen. In Study A2301, exploratory 
biomarker  analysis  will use  flow  cytometry  to  characterize  defined  immune  cell  populations,  including 
those implicated in immunomodulatory effects of other TKIs (bosutinib, imatinib, dasatinib). In order to 
provide an insight into immunomodulatory effects of asciminib, exploratory biomarkers will be analysed 
at study end and reported at the time of the final CSR. This is considered acceptable, and data awaited. 
2.6.9.5.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Food effect 
Food decreases the oral bioavailability of asciminib, therefore it needs to be taken in the fasted state. 
Food consumption should be avoided for at least 2 hours before and 1 hour after taking asciminib. 
Drug interactions 
Asciminib is a substrate of CYP3A4, UGT2B7 and UGT2B17, contributing with 36%, 13.3% and 7.8% to 
its clearance, respectively. It is estimated that the efflux transporter BCRP contributes to total systemic 
clearance by 31.1%. 
Co-administration with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor clarithromycin resulted in an asciminib AUC and Cmax 
increase of 36% and 19%. No dose adjustment is needed. Co-administration with the strong CYP3A4 
inducer rifampicin resulted in an asciminib AUCinf decrease of 14.9%. Therefore, co-administration with 
strong CYP3A4 inducers should be used with caution at all recommended doses. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 105/128 
 
 
 
 
Asciminib is a low affinity substrate of P-gp. In a clinical DDI study with the strong P-gp inhibitor quinidine 
no  exposure  increase  of  asciminib  was  observed  confirming  that  P-gp  is  of  low  importance  for  the 
disposition of asciminib. No dose adjustment is proposed. 
Asciminib can be administered with acid reducing agents without dose adjustments. 
Clinical DDI studies demonstrated that asciminib (40 mg b.i.d.) is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 
and  no  inhibitor  of  CYP2C8.  Co-administration  with  substrates  of  CYP3A4  with  a  narrow  therapeutic 
window should be used with caution at all recommended doses.  
At asciminib 40 mg b.i.d./ 80 mg q.d., substrates of CYP2C9 with a narrow therapeutic index should be 
used  with  caution.  If  co-administration  cannot  be  avoided,  the  CYP2C9  substrates  dose  should  be 
reduced. If co-administration with warfarin cannot be avoided, the frequency of international normalized 
ratio (INR) monitoring should be increased as the anti-coagulant effect of warfarin may be enhanced. 
Based on PBPK simulations asciminib was characterized to result in no clinical relevant inhibition of P-
gp, BCRP and OATP1B1/OATP1B3 substrates (AUC increase < 25%). No dose adjustment is proposed 
when co-administering asciminib with P-gp, BCRP and OATP substrates. 
2.6.9.6.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The frequency of AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation reported in the study A2301 was 
lower in the asciminib group compared to the bosutinib group. Overall, 11 patients discontinued 
treatment in the asciminib treatment group in the study A2301. Reasons for discontinuation were 
thrombocytopenia (3 patients), neutropenia /neutrophil count decreased, platelet count decreased, 
lipase increased, amylase increased, cerebral disorder, ejection fraction decreased and ischaemic 
stroke.  In eight out of eleven patents, the AEs resolved upon discontinuation of asciminib. In two 
patients, in whom AEs leading to discontinuation were still ongoing did not accept survival follow-up) 
and in the third patient neutrophil count decreased was still ongoing. Of note, two patents died, one 
on-treatment (ischemic stroke) and one during survival follow-up (cerebral disorder). 
2.6.9.7.  Exposure- safety analyses 
The  applicant  provided  an  exposure-safety  analyses  where  exposure-safety  relationship  was  explored 
using various safety endpoints such as laboratory and vital signs abnormalities and AEs. The exposure 
metrics were based on daily predictions of AUC, Cmax and Cmin from the population PK model and a 5-
day-average  prior  to  safety  event.  In  all  safety  endpoints  analysed  (except  Grade  2  or  Higher  AST 
increase),  no  significant  relationship  was  found  between  probability  of  safety  events  and  increase  in 
exposure within the range of dose levels and regimens investigated.  
2.6.9.8.  Post marketing experience 
Asciminib has been approved by FDA in 10/2021, but post marketing data are not yet available. 
2.6.10.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety evaluation of asciminib was primarily based on the data from the pivotal Phase III trial (Study 
A2301)  in  adults  patients  with  Ph+  CML-CP  previously  treated  with  ≥   ATP-competitive  TKIs.  The 
supportive safety information was collected from the Phase 1 study X2101 in heavily pre-treated patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 106/128 
 
 
 
 
with CML-CP/-AP. The population enrolled from these studies is considered to adequately represent the 
target population. 
The  safety  data  from  the  Study  2301  and  Study  X2101  has  been  pooled  to  enable  evaluation  of  the 
impact of asciminib treatment at different doses and different treatment regimens. The pooling strategy 
is based on the similarity of the study populations (patients treated with at least two prior TKIs) in these 
studies.  Furthermore,  the  consistency  of  the  safety  results  between  Study  A2301  and  the  asciminib 
Safety  Pool  reinforces  the  safety  profile  of  asciminib  across  different  dose  levels.  In  addition,  the 
asciminib  All  patients  Safety  Pool  enables  an  informed  assessment  of  the  safety  profile  of  asciminib, 
judgment of the overall benefit-risk of the drug in the treatment of Ph+ CML-CP and a more robust safety 
evaluation based on a larger pool of patients with a longer duration of follow-up. Overall, this approach 
is considered acceptable. An updated ADR table for the section 4.8 of the SmPC has been submitted with 
the responses to the Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues . Since frequencies of adverse reactions at Week 
96 cut-off for the Study A2301 were unchanged in comparison to Week 48, there was no change in AR 
frequencies in the updated Safety Pool. 
This application was submitted with the interim results from an ongoing studies Study 2301 and Study 
X2101 with the data cut-off dates 25-May-2020 and 2-Apr-2020, respectively. Additionally, an updated 
data  analysis,  including  longer  follow-up  data  with  a  cut-off  date  of  06-Jan-2021,  corresponding  to 
approximately  7.5  months  and  9  months  additional  follow-up  for  Study  A2301  and  Study  X2101, 
respectively, has been provided.  As a response to Day 120 List of Questions, an updated safety analysis 
of  the  pivotal  Study  A2301,  at  cut-off  date  06-Oct-2021  and  with  9  months  additional  follow-up  was 
presented and discussed.  
The  Week  96  interim  CSR  for  Study  A2301  was  submitted  with  the  responses  to  the  Day  180  List  of 
Outstanding Issues. 
The  safety  database  is  small  (n=356  in  the  pool  A,  asciminib  all  patients  safety  pool).  The  applicant 
argues  that,  based  on  previous  regulatory  experience  on  TKIs  the  safety  database  in  the  target 
population could be considered overall large enough to allow the initial safety assessment. Furthermore, 
the applicant is planning to collect the additional safety data for asciminib, with relevant studies described 
in the RMP section. Overall, this approach is acceptable. The long-term safety data of the probably life-
long treatment in the target population is, however, considered essential.  
In Study A2301, demographic characteristics were well balanced between the asciminib and bosutinib 
treatment  groups  with  the  exception  of  gender  and  ethnicity.  This  is  acknowledged  and  probably  not 
avoidable in a late line population. 
Regarding the prior antineoplastic therapy in the study A2301, the imbalances between the treatment 
arms  were  noted  with  respect  to  prior  lines  of  TKI  treatment,  reasons  of  discontinuation  of  prior 
treatment and prior TKIs received, however, it is considered that these imbalances do not bias in favour 
of asciminib. 
The  median  duration  of  exposure  to  asciminib  in  Study  A2301  was  43.4  weeks  (range  0.1  to  129) 
compared to 29.2 weeks (range:1.0-117.0) for bosutinib group at the data cut-off date 25-May-2020. 
With the longer follow-up at the data cut-off date 6-Jan-2021, the difference in the exposure to study 
treatment  between  asciminib  and  bosutinib  treatment  groups  was  further  increased  (67.1  weeks  for 
asciminib arm compared to 29.7 weeks for bosutinib arm).  
An updated safety analysis with a cut-off date of 06-Oct-2021 increased the median duration of exposure 
in Study A2301 to 23.7 months and to 26.6 moths in asciminib All patients Safety Pool.  
There  is  a  substantial  difference  in  exposure  between  asciminib  and  bosutinib  treatment  groups.  The 
median duration of exposure to study drug was approximately three times longer in the asciminib arm 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 107/128 
 
 
 
(103.14 weeks; range: 0.1 to 201.1) compared to that in the bosutinib arm (30.50 weeks; range: 1.0 
to  188.3).  This  is  because  more  patients  discontinued  study  medication  in  the  bosutinib  vs  asciminib 
treatment group. 
The per-protocol dose of asciminib in the study A2301 was 40 mg b.i.d. In case of toxicities, the dose of 
asciminib could be reduced to 20 mg b.i.d. Doses below 20 mg b.i.d. for asciminib were not allowed. At 
the data cut-off date of 06-Jan-2021, at least one dose reduction was reported for 39.1% of patients in 
on  asciminib  and  in  23.1%  of  patients  the  reason  was  AE.  In  the  section  4.2  of  the    SmPC  the  dose 
reductions  to  50%  of  dose  were  proposed.  However,  considering  the  lack  of  significant  and  clinically 
relevant  safety-exposure  relationships,  as  discussed  in  the  responses  to  the  D120  LoQ  this 
recommendation needed   clarification. In the response to D180 LoOI, the applicant clarified the issue 
regarding  dose  modification.  A  dose  reduction  is  not  the  recommended  first  step  to  manage  ARs, 
therefore, the former table 1 in the SmPC has been removed to not cause misunderstanding regarding 
dose  modifications  steps  to  be  followed,  which  is  endorsed.  Dose  reduction  is  only  a  conservative 
measure  to  minimize  the  risk  of  AE  recurrence  when  asciminib  treatment  was  resumed  after  AE 
resolution.  The  former  table  2  (now  table  1  of  the  proposed  SmPC)  adequately  reflects  the  proposed 
management of ARs and is considered appropriate. 
In the asciminib treatment group, overall, 11 patients discontinued treatment due to AEs. Reasons for 
discontinuation were thrombocytopenia (3 patients), neutropenia /neutrophil count decreased, platelet 
count decreased, lipase increased, amylase increased, cerebral disorder, ejection fraction decreased and 
ischaemic stroke. In eight out of eleven patents, the AEs resolved upon discontinuation of asciminib. 
Overall 91.0% of patients in the asciminib group experienced AEs compared to 97.4% in the bosutinib 
treatment group. Grade ≥ 3 AEs were lower in patients on asciminib (54.5%) as compared to bosutinib 
(67.1%). Furthermore, AEs suspected to be study treatment related, AEs requiring dose interruption, 
dose adjustments, and additional therapies were also reported less frequently in the asciminib treatment 
group  compared  to  the  bosutinib  treatment  group.  Also  the  overall  incidence  of  fatal  SAEs  was 
comparable  between  the  groups.  Considering  the  lower  overall  exposure  in  the  bosutinib  arm  due  to 
discontinuation, these findings seemed in line with claims for a more favourable safety profile of asciminib 
compared with bosutinib.  
Due to the early discontinuation of a higher proportion of patients from the bosutinib group, EAIRs were 
calculated for AEs. Results indicated lower EAIRs in the asciminib group for overall AEs irrespective of 
relationship to study treatment and treatment-related AEs. 
The EAIR for the asciminib 80 mg q.d. treatment group in the Study X2101 was significantly higher (AEs 
1557.9; treatment related AEs 255.4) in comparison to other groups/safety pools. This would suggest a 
less  favourable  safety  profile  when  compared  to  the  40  mg  b.i.d  dosing.  Furthermore,  since  data  for 
patients  treated  at  higher  then  currently  proposed  doses  (>  80  mg  per  day)  is  integrated  in  the  all 
patients  safety  pool  and  therefore  not  discussed  separately  (except  for  the  safety  data  in  patients 
harbouring the T315I mutation, discussed below) the applicant additionally discussed the safety profile 
of the patients treated at higher daily doses. The extensive exposure analysis showed lack of association 
between higher doses/regimens of asciminib and occurrence of AEs (in particular TEAEs and SAEs). 
To further assess the safety profile of asciminib given at 80 mg q.d. dose, the applicant has initiated a 
phase IIIb treatment optimisation study of 80 mg asciminib total daily dose in third-line CML-CP. This 
data  should  provide  additional information  regarding  80  mg  q.d.  dosing  regimen,  the  regimen that  is 
considered to represent more convenient alternative for the patients. Following the request by the CHMP, 
the applicant has removed the 80 mg q.d. posology throughout the proposed product information. 
The most commonly reported AEs in the asciminib treatment group were related to myelosuppression, 
specifically  thrombocytopenia  and  neutropenia.  The  frequency  of  neutropenia  was  relatively  similar 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 108/128 
 
 
 
between  patients  on  asciminib  (19.2%)  and  bosutinib  (17.1%),  however,  the  frequency  of 
thrombocytopenia was higher in patients in the asciminib group (23.1% vs 14.5% in bosutinib group). 
Other  commonly  AEs  reported  in  the  asciminib  treatment  group  were  headache,  fatigue,  arthralgia, 
hypertension, nausea, diarrhoea and nasopharyngitis. Thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and hypertension 
were the most frequent grade ≥ 3 events in asciminib treatment group. This could be probably explained 
due to the more rapid action on the target in the haematopoietic cells and is in line with previous findings 
in 2G-TKIs pivotal trials were the first generation product imatinib was the comparator.  
AEs related to thrombocytopenia were mostly reported within the first 6 months of therapy in both the 
treatment groups, although at a higher frequency in the asciminib group and treatment discontinuation 
due to thrombocytopenia AESIs was low: 3.2% in the asciminib group and 1.3% in the bosutinib group. 
Despite the higher frequency of thrombocytopenia events in patients on asciminib, the observation of 
haemorrhagic events was similar between both treatment groups (11.5% vs. 9.2%) 
In general, the safety events observed for bosutinib are well known and the reported incidences of drug 
related TEAEs are overall considered in accordance with the known safety profile of this drug. 
An  increased  mortality  was  reported  in  the  asciminib  arm  in  comparison  to  the  bosutinib  arm  in  the 
pivotal trial: overall, 5 deaths occurred, 4 in asciminib and 1 in bosutinib treatment group. On-treatment 
deaths were reported for 3 patients with similar frequencies in both treatment groups: 2 patients (1.3%) 
in the asciminib treatment group (embolism arterial and ischaemic stroke) and 1 (1.3%) in the bosutinib 
treatment group (septic shock).  
In Study X2101 asciminib 80 mg q.d. dose one on-treatment death has occurred due to cardiac arrest, 
which  might  also  have  been  the  sequela  of  a  thromboembolic  event.  Overall,  14  patients  died  in  the 
asciminib All Patients Safety pool, including two patients who died due to COVID-19.The adverse events 
of  special  interest  identified  with  asciminib  treatment  are:  myelosuppression,  pancreatic  toxicity, 
hypersensitivity,  hepatotoxicity,  hepatitis  B  virus  reactivation,  reproductive  toxicity,  GI  toxicity, 
phototoxicity, QTc prolongation, cardiac failure, oedema and fluid retention, ischemic heart disease and 
CNS conditions, and haemorrhage. 
Myelosuppression-related events are very common during TKI treatment and are considered to be due 
to  the  combined  effect  of  suppression  of  the  leukemic  clone  and  inhibition  of  non-leukemic 
haematopoiesis.  
In Study A2301, the incidence of myelosuppression-related events was comparable in both treatment 
groups  (37.8%  vs.  36.8%  in  the  asciminib  and  bosutinib  groups  respectively)  with  the  exception  of 
thrombocytopenia (part of the myelosuppression grouped AESIs; 29.5% vs. 19.7%). Events leading to 
treatment  discontinuation  were  infrequent  (3.8%  vs.  5.3%).  Thrombocytopenia  was  more  frequently 
observed  in  the  asciminib  group  (see  above),  but  was  generally  manageable  with  dose 
adjustments/interruptions and required treatment discontinuations in only a small proportion of patients 
(3.2%  vs.  1.3%).  A  dose  dependence  of  these  AEs  was  discussed  since  in  the  80  mg  q.d.  group  the 
frequency  of  myelosuppression-related  events  increased  (44.4%  of  the  18  patients),  with  3  patients 
having grade ≥ 3 events. The overall incidence of myelosuppression events in both asciminib Safety Pools 
was mostly consistent with that reported for the asciminib group in Study A2301. However, in general it 
is  acknowledged  that  myelosuppression  related  events  are  generally  reversible  and  manageable  with 
appropriate monitoring, and dose interruption/modification in TKI treatment of CML. 
The pancreas was identified as a toxicity target organ in nonclinical studies. The mechanism of action of 
pancreatitis is not completely understood at this time, but also known for other TKIs. In Study A2301, 
pancreatic toxicity AEs occurred in 8.3% of patients in the asciminib group and 9.2% in the bosutinib 
group. All pancreatic events were related to laboratory findings (lipase/amylase increases) with no co-
existing  clinical  events.  None  of  events  were  considered  as  serious.  Two  patients  discontinued  study

treatment (1 × pancreatitis and 1 × acute pancreatitis). Overall, pancreatic toxicity events (including 
clinical  events)  were  of  low  severity  and  were  reversible;  and  were  managed  by  dose  reduction  or 
interruptions. Caution is nevertheless recommended in patients with previous history of pancreatitis. 
Hypersensitivity  events  (including  skin  reactions)  were  seen  less  frequently  in  the  asciminib  group 
(19.2% vs. 34.2% in the bosutinib group) and no patient discontinued treatment with asciminib due to 
hypersensitivity. In the asciminib 80 mg q.d. dose group, 7 patients had hypersensitivity events (all skin 
disorders).  Within  the  asciminib  All  Patients  Safety  Pool,  with  the  exception  of  2  index  cases 
(bronchospasm and hypersensitivity) in Study X2101, the majority of hypersensitivity events were skin 
disorders (primarily rash), that were either mild or moderate (grade 1/2) in nature, were transient, and 
were manageable. 
In  Study  A2301  the  incidence  of  hepatotoxicity  events  (including  laboratory  terms)  was  lower  in  the 
asciminib  treatment  group  (8.3%)  compared  to  the  bosutinib  treatment  group  (30.3%).  No  clinical 
events related to hepatotoxicity AESI were reported, only laboratory/enzyme elevations were noted. The 
incidence  of  the  most  frequently  occurring  events:  ALT  increase  and  AST  increase  were  lower  in  the 
asciminib  treatment  group  (each  3.8%)  compared  to  bosutinib  treatment  group  (27.6%  and  21.1% 
respectively). There was no evidence of irreversible liver damage with the use of asciminib monotherapy 
for treatment of CML
CP/AP. 
The applicant presented a comprehensive analysis of arterial occlusive events (AOEs) and asciminib. As 
‑
vascular  adverse  events  (including  AOCs)  are  known  problem  in  patients  with  CML  receiving  TKIs 
(especially ponatinib) is the analysis and applicant’s discussion on this issue considered very important 
in characterisation of the risk pertinent to asciminib treatment. 
AOEs represent off
target relevant complications of TKIs. The AOEs observed with other TKIs used to 
treat CML are considered to result from the inhibition of one or more kinases, other than ABL1 and ABL2. 
Considering  asciminib  inhibits  only  the  tyrosine  kinase  activity  of  ABL1,  ABL2  and  BCR::ABL1  by 
‑
specifically targeting the ABL myristate binding pocket and hence does not engage the orthosteric ATP-
binding site, it is unlikely that it would cause off-target kinase pharmacological effects resulting from the 
inhibition  of  protein  kinases  other  than  ABL1  and  ABL2.  Nilotinib  and  ponatinib  interact  with  a 
considerable  number  of  clinically  relevant  vascular  targets  implicated  in  endothelial  cell  survival  and 
angiogenesis. Of note, ponatinib inhibits a large number of kinases, including VEGFR kinases that are 
strongly associated with causing AOEs. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms associated with the onset 
of vascular occlusive events observed with ponatinib treatment, are still unknown. 
Thorough  assessment  of  AOE  events  in  clinical  trials  A2301  and  X2101  is  much  appreciated.  It  is 
reassuring that ischemic heart and central nervous system events, that could be considered important 
arterial  occlusive  events,  have  been  reported  with  similar  frequencies  in  the  asciminib  arm  and  the 
bosutinib arm of Study A2301 (Week 96 update 6.4% vs. 5.3%).  
Grade 3 AOEs were reported in 0.6% of patients in the asciminib arm (cerebral infarction) and Grade 5 
in 1.3% (ischaemic stroke and mesenteric artery thrombosis). Furthermore, in asciminib All patients pool 
there were 28 patients (7.9%) that experienced AOEs. Grade 3 AOEs were reported in 3.1% of patients, 
grade 4 in 0.3% and grade 5 in 0.6%. When indirectly compared, frequencies were substantially lower 
than in the pivotal study for registration of ponatinib.  
In  the  Week  96  cut-off  for  study  A2301,  no  additional  AOE  was  reported  in  patients  randomized  to 
asciminib. Most patients who experienced AOEs with asciminib had baseline cardiovascular risk factors 
and  unfavourable  cardiovascular  medical  history  along  with the  prior  exposure  to  multiple  other  TKIs 
including nilotinib and/or ponatinib. The assessment of an association between the occurrence of AOEs 
with duration of exposure, cumulative dose, and daily dose intensity did not reveal a clear trend. This 
while in the 5-year analysis of the PACE study such a trend has been found for ponatinib.

There was one additional patient who experienced AOEs (mesenteric arterial occlusion and mesenteric 
artery thrombosis) in the week 96 cut-off for study A2301. This 52-year-old female patient was initially 
randomised to bosutinib, but switched to asciminib after meeting lack of efficacy criteria on bosutinib. 
The Investigator did not suspect a relationship between the events of mesenteric artery thrombosis and 
mesenteric artery occlusion and asciminib. However, a possible causal relationship between mesenteric 
arterial occlusion and the use of asciminib, from the assessors’ point of view, could not be completely 
ruled out.  
In  an updated information  on  AOEs,  based  on the updated  Safety  Pool  with Week  96  cut-off  date,  in 
comparison to the previous Week 48 cut-off date, one additional patient was reported to experience AOE 
in the asciminib All patients Safety Pool (Troponin increased – Grade 1; not related). 
Nevertheless, currently available safety data has provided no evidence that asciminib increased the risk 
of  occurrence  of  AOEs  among  patients  who  have  prior  history  of  cardiovascular  events  and  therefore 
patients with a medical history of previous episodes of AOEs should only be carefully followed up in line 
with the standard care guidelines. In line with this, the applicant has proposed a general statement as 
conservative  approach  to  be  added  to  the  “Hypertension”  paragraph  in  the  Warning  and  Precautions 
section of the SmPC, which is endorsed. 
In Study A2301, QTc prolongation related events were reported in 4 patients in the asciminib group and 
1 patient in the bosutinib group. No grade 4 events were reported and none of the events led to study 
discontinuation. In the asciminib group, two cases of ECG QTc prolonged were reported as AEs; one of 
these  patients  experienced  QTcF  >  500  ms  with  >  60  ms  increase  –  the  event  resolved  with  dose 
interruption and did not re-occur after asciminib was resumed at the reduced dose of 20 mg b.i.d. In 
this context, it is reassuring that at therapeutic doses, asciminib appears not to have a relevant effect 
on  cardiac  repolarization.  AEs  related  to  QT  prolongation  were  mostly  confounded  by  other  factors 
including concurrent medical conditions, and concomitant medications but the additive role of asciminib 
cannot be fully excluded. Appropriate warnings regarding QT prolongation and combination with drugs 
known to cause Torsade de Pointes have been included in the SmPC. 
Cardiac failure occurred with similar frequencies (1.3%) in both treatment arms. The cardiac events in 
the asciminib treatment group were cardiac failure and ejection fraction decrease (each occurring in 1 
patient);  both  were  of  grade  3  severity  and  were  considered  as  SAEs.  Ejection  fraction  decrease  (1 
patient) was the only event suspected to be treatment related in the asciminib treatment group and this 
patient  discontinued  the  study  due  to  this  event.  The  occurrence  of  heart  failure  reported  in  patients 
receiving asciminib was confounded by predisposing classic cardiovascular risks. It is agreed that this 
does not support including heart failure as an adverse drug reaction in SmPC section 4.8. 
Apart from QT prolongation and palpitations (already included in section 4.8), it is agreed that there is 
no  reasonable  evidence  of  a  causal  association  of  asciminib  for  one  of  the  other  single  events  of 
arrhythmia warranting inclusion as adverse drug reaction in the SmPC. PSURs will provide data from the 
post-marketing setting on the safety of asciminib. 
Fluid retention (including cases of pleural effusion) have been reported in patients treated with asciminib. 
Relevant events related to oedema and fluid retention (oedema, including oedema peripheral, and pleural 
effusion)  are  already  listed  as  ADRs  of  ‘common’  frequency  in  Section  4.8  of  the  proposed  SmPC. 
Considering that most of the events were mild to moderate (grade < 3), reversible, resolving without 
dose interruption and modification, and that none of the patients discontinued the treatment due to fluid-
retention relevant events, the existing evidence currently does not warrant the inclusion of fluid retention 
as a relevant warning in Section 4.4 of the proposed SmPC. 
Treatment-related  AEs  were  noted  in  6  patients  (5  patients  with  photosensitivity  and  1  retinal 
phototoxicity)  in  asciminib  All  Patients  Safety  Pool.  The  applicant  considers no  specific  precautions  or 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 111/128 
 
 
 
warnings in section 4.4 of the proposed SmPC regarding the risk of photosensitivity are needed based 
on available non-clinical and clinical data. The assessor is, however, of the opinion that data, obtained 
so far from the study X2101 where patients are exposed to the asciminib considerably longer than in the 
pivotal study, has showed asciminib potential to induce photosensitivity reactions in relevant number of 
patient. It is acknowledged that no events related to phototoxicity were reported in the pivotal Study 
A2301, however, this only reflects a limited number of patients enrolled. Of note, in the bosutinib arm 
of the pivotal study no photosensitivity reactions were reported although bosutinib is known to cause 
photosensitivity reactions with common frequency. It is also not clear whether the patients in the pivotal 
study were advised to avoid direct sunlight or ultraviolet (UV) radiation as this is precaution advised in 
order to minimise the risk of photosensitivity associated with bosutinib treatment. No mention of this 
could be found in the protocol of the study. The applicant presented updated data with responses to the 
Day  180 
List  of  outstanding 
Issues 
regarding  photosensitivity 
reactions.  No  new 
photosensitivity/phototoxicity findings were reported in the Week 96 cut-off data from Study A2301. The 
photosensitivity-/phototoxicity-related  events  will  be  monitored  in  the  context  of  the  periodic  safety 
update  report  (PSUR)  and  SmPC  is  to  be  revised  accordingly  should  there  be  an  increased  signal 
detected.  
Haemorrhage events occurred with relatively similar incidence (+2.3%) in patients in the asciminib and 
the  bosutinib  treatment  groups,  despite  the  fact  that  thrombocytopenia  was  much  more  frequently 
observed in asciminib treatment group. No pattern for a specific site of bleeding has been identified. 
With  regard  to  other  laboratory  findings,  worsened  post-baseline  clinical  chemistry  laboratory 
abnormalities  occurred  in  similar  proportions  of  patients  in  the  two  treatment  groups,  with  only  few 
notable differences. Most of these abnormalities were mild-to-moderate (grade 1 or 2) in both treatment 
group. Triglycerides increase was more pronounced in the asciminib arm (Asci: 70.5% vs. Bosu: 53.9% 
in the asciminib and bosutinib treatment group respectively). 
Hyperglycaemia was more frequently reported as AEs in patients on asciminib. However, after treatment 
initiation,  worsening  of  glycated  haemoglobin  was  observed  with  similar  frequency  in  patients  on 
bosutinib (5.8%) vs. asciminib (4.9%). The majority of glucose concentration increases were grade 1/2 
and did not result in HbA1c increase. This suggest that the higher frequency of increases in glucose in 
the  asciminib  arm  were  not  sustained  over  time.  This  is  acknowledged.  Still,  almost  all  patients 
experienced  an  incidental  glucose  increase,  and  it  is  considered  valuable  information  for  the  treating 
physician that this might occur with asciminib treatment, therefore “Hyperglycaemia” as ARD is included 
in the section 4.8 of the SmPC, as requested. 
The number of patients ≥65 years of age in the pivotal Study A2301 (n=29) and the number of patients 
≥75 years of age in the All patients Safety Pool (n=21) were low. . The incidence of majority of AEs in 
both the age subgroups in the asciminib arm were consistent. Overall, no concerns are raised with regard 
to  any  differences  in  terms  of  age,  gender  or  race.  However,  subgroup  conclusions  from  such  small 
population are in general less informative.  
There  is  a  limited  safety  data  in  patients  with  renal impairment,  in  fact,  no  patient  with  severe  renal 
impairment  was  included  in  the  asciminib  studies.  From  the  safety  data  of  the  pivotal  (A2301)  and 
supportive study (X2101) a worse safety profile for patients with moderate renal impairment compared 
to patients with normal renal function or mild renal impairment may be suggested although these results 
should be interpreted with caution due to a small sample size. The effect of renal impairment on the PK 
of  asciminib  is  extensively  discussed  in  PK  section  of  this  report,  in  particularly  the  comparability  of 
asciminib  80  mg  q.d.  vs  40  mg  b.i.d  dose.  Overall,  it  can  be  agreed  with  the  applicant  that  no  dose 
adjustment is needed for subjects with renal impairment, including severe renal impairment.  
Furthermore, considering the results of the dedicated hepatic impairment study where no relevant impact 
of mild or moderate hepatic impairment on the PK of asciminib was shown, the applicant recommended 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 112/128 
 
 
 
no dose adjustment in patents with hepatic impairment. In the development program of asciminib, only 
patients  with  mild  hepatic  impairment  were  included  and  the  data  showed  that  the  safety  in  these 
patients was comparable to patients with normal hepatic function. When analysing AESIs, although most 
of the safety topics of interest were well balanced between the subgroups in both 40 mg b.i.d. Safety 
Pool  and  All  patients  Safety  Pool,  myelosuppression  and  pancreatic  toxicity-laboratory  events  were 
reported with >10% higher incidence in the mild hepatic impairment group compared to the group of 
patients with normal hepatic function. The relevance of this finding is hard to assess, considering the low 
number of patients with mild hepatic impairment at baseline. Reassuring is that no increase of hepatic 
toxicity clinical events was detected in patients with mild hepatic impairment, the events were with low 
frequency and were well balanced between the subgroups. It is agreed with the applicant that no warning 
in patients with hepatic impairment towards the possible risk of developing fatal hepatic failure during 
asciminib therapy, nor dose adjustment in patents with hepatic impairment is currently warranted.  
The proposed indication allows for treatment of patients harbouring the T315I mutation, however, the 
applicant did not intend to allow for treatment of Ph+ CML-CP patients harboring a T315I mutation who 
have received two or more TKIs. In total 48 patients harbouring the T315I mutation have been treated 
in  supportive  Study  X2101  with  asciminib  200  mg  b.i.d.,  the  recommended  dose  for  this  population. 
Grade ≥3 AEs (56.3%) and SAEs (20.8%) were reported in higher frequencies compared to the asciminib 
arm  in  the  pivotal  trial  (50.6%  and  13.5%,  respectively).  However,  the  number  of  T315I  mutated 
patients is relatively limited and median exposure was substantially longer (69.8 weeks) compared to 
the pivotal trial (43.4). No new safety signals have emerged and study discontinuation due to AEs was 
in line with the pivotal trial (6.3%). Although hampered by indirect comparison, the safety profile seems 
favourable compared to the registered alternative in this setting, ponatinib.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
2.6.11.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
From the safety outcome in the limited database available for the treatment with asciminib, it may be 
presumed  that  the  safety  risks  associated  with  asciminib  treatment  are  tolerable  and  indicate  a 
manageable safety profile similar to that of other approved TKIs.  
In addition, the updated safety data as provided with the response to Day 180 questions, suggests no 
new safety signals compared to the primary data cut-off. Furthermore, no association of AOEs with 
dose intensity, cumulative dose or duration of exposure of asciminib based on the currently available 
data has been shown. 
The CHMP considers a number of category 3 PASS necessary to address issues related to long term 
safety. The studies are listed in the Pharmacovigilance plan.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Scemblix is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic 
myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) previously treated with two or more tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (see section 5.1) 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Since the approval of imatinib in 2001, the 10 year survival rates for patients with CML have improved 
from  approximately  20%  to  around  80-90%,  and  targeted  therapy  with  TKIs  has  become  the  gold 
standard of treatment (Jabbour and Kantarjian 2018). There are four TKIs approved for the treatment 
of newly diagnosed CML (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib), with imatinib being the most commonly 
used  in  clinical  practice  in  CML-CP  patients  (Apperley  2015,  Banegas  et  al  2019,  and  Hochhaus  et  al 
2020). 
For patients with CML-CP who experience treatment failure (intolerance or resistance) to previous TKI 
therapy, the therapeutic options are limited. Treatment selection is further complicated by consideration 
of the patients’ comorbidities, age, emergence of mutations, and the safety profile of each particular TKI 
(Hochhaus et al 2017, Hochhaus et al 2020, NCCN 2020). 
After treatment failure on a 2G-TKI, ponatinib, a 3G-TKI, is an option. However, clinical guidelines do 
not recommend its use in patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors because cardiovascular 
toxicity can occur in about 30% of patients (Cortes et al 2018, Hochhaus et al 2020, NCCN 2020). 
Despite  available  therapies  for  CML  have  greatly  broadened  treatment  choices  and  improved  patient 
outcomes,  there  remain  challenges  in  the  management  of  CML.  The  choice  and  sequencing  of  TKIs 
remains  controversial  with  the  complexity  of  safety and  tolerability  considerations  in  the  context  of  a 
long-term therapy  (Mauro  et  al  2013,  Cortes  and  Kantarjian  2016).  Especially  patients  treated  in  the 
third and further lines of therapy represent a population with a high unmet need requiring therapies with 
potent anti-leukemic activity to control the disease and with a well-tolerated safety profile. 
The  current  European  Treatment  guidelines  (Hochhaus  et  al,  2020)  summarises  the  current  situation 
and concludes for the treatment beyond the second line:  
“The definition of an acceptable response to third, fourth or fifth line treatment cannot be formalised, 
but a BCR-ABL1 transcript level >1% or a cytogenetic response less than complete (Ph+ >0%) are 
insufficient for optimal survival. There are no comparative studies and the choice of TKI should be 
guided by the sensitivity profile of specific BCR-ABL1 KD-mutations if possible, and, in particular T315I 
where only ponatinib is efficacious. Suboptimal responses to two or more TKIs should lead to prompt 
consideration of an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT).” 
Insofar, an efficacious inhibitor that targets the myristoyl pocket of BCR-ABL1, in contrast to the currently 
available TKIs that target the BCR-ABL1 ATP binding site and does not interact with the ATP-binding site 
may be beneficial. It offers the chance for activity against cells expressing clinically observed ATP-binding 
TKI resistant mutations. However, whether inhibition of the new binding site is also associated with an 
improved safety and tolerability when administered as monotherapy compared to TKIs binding to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 121/128 
 
 
 
ATP-binding  site  of  BCR-ABL1  remains  open,  since  inhibition  of  a  new  binding  site  may  also  lead  to 
different toxicities in humans.  
Asciminib  in  principle  may  thereby  fulfil  a  medical  need  in  the  treatment  of  CML,  particularly  in  the 
situation of post 2G-TKI treatment failure as currently applied. 
Patients with T315I mutated BCR-ABL1 are a separate, multi-drug resistant population for which up to 
now only ponatinib has shown efficacy and is specifically and separately approved. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Efficacy  claim  for  the  applied  indication  “treatment  of  adult  patients  with  Philadelphia  chromosome-
positive chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) previously treated with two or more 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors” is based on the results of the primary analysis of the pivotal Phase III study 
Study  A2301  (data  cut-off  date  of  25-May-2020/06-Oct  2021).  This  trial  is  an  ongoing,  randomized, 
open-label, active-controlled (bosutinib), multi-center Phase III study to compare the efficacy and safety 
of asciminib with that of bosutinib in patients with CML-CP, previously treated with at least 2 prior TKIs. 
A total of 233 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either asciminib 40 mg b.i.d. (n=157) 
or bosutinib 500 mg q.d. (n=76), stratified by the patient's cytogenetic response status at baseline. 
Supportive evidence from Phase I Study X2101 is available. Cut-off date is 02-Apr-2020. This trial is an 
ongoing Phase I, first-in-patients, multicenter, open-label, dose escalation study intended to define the 
maximum  tolerated  dose  and/or  recommended  dose  for  further  clinical  evaluation  (MTD/RDEs-
approach). Primary objective in this trial was to characterize safety and tolerability and to assess the 
pharmacokinetic  (PK)  profile  as  well  as  dose-finding  for  the  pivotal  trial  by  analysing  the  preliminary 
evidence of efficacy. Asciminib was studied given as single agent or in combination with either nilotinib 
or imatinib or dasatinib in patients with CML or Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)[ 5 arm-trial].  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In  the  pivotal  Study  A2301,  superiority  with  regard  to  the  primary  endpoint  “MMR  rate  at  week  24” 
against the comparator bosutinib was shown (25.5% versus 13.2%, respectively; treatment difference: 
12.2%; 95% CI: 2.2, 22.3; p = 0.029) (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test, stratified by MCyR 
status  at  baseline,  two-sided).  At  the  new  cut-off  (6-Oct  2021),  clinical  superiority  versus  bosutinib 
increased compared to the primary analysis, as reflected by a more than 2-fold improvement in MMR 
rate compared to bosutinib at Week 96; 37.6.% (95% CI: 29.99, 45.65) in the asciminib arm compared 
to 15.8 % (95% CI: 8.43, 25.96) in the bosutinib arm, corresponding to a common treatment difference 
of 21.7%; 95% CI: 10.5, 33.0; p = 0.001 (after adjusting for baseline MCyR status). 
The  Kaplan-Meier  (KM)  estimated  proportion  of  patients  maintaining  MMR  for  at  least  72  weeks  was 
96.7% (95% CI: 87.4, 99.2) in the asciminib arm and 92.9% (95% CI: 59.1, 99.0) in the bosutinib arm. 
The  CCyR  rate  (based  on  patients  who  were  not  in CCyR  at  baseline)  by  Week  24  was  40.8%  in  the 
asciminib arm compared to 24.2% in the bosutinib arm. The CCyR rate by Week 48 was 45.6% in the 
asci arm compared to 35.5% in the bosutinib arm and 39.8% in the asciminib arm and 16.1% in the 
bosutinib arm at Week 96.  
In ASCEMBL, 12.7% of patients treated with asciminib and 13.2% of patients receiving bosutinib had 
one or more BCR::ABL1 mutations detected at baseline. MMR at 24 weeks was observed in 35.3% and 
24.8% of patients receiving asciminib with or without any BCR::ABL1 mutation at baseline, respectively. 
MMR at 24 weeks was observed in 25% and 11.1% of patients receiving bosutinib with or without any 
mutation  at  baseline,  respectively.  The  MMR  rate  at  24 weeks  in  patients  in  whom  the  randomised 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/634238/2022  
Page 122/128 
 
 
 
treatment  represented  the  third,  fourth,  or  fifth  or  more  line  of  TKI  was  29.3%,  25%,  and  16.1%  in 
patients treated with asciminib and 20%, 13.8%, and 0% in patients receiving bosutinib, respectively. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The clinical relevance of a more rapid or even deeper molecular response remains uncertain as it is not 
sufficiently  linked  to  better  overall  survival.  Considering  the  known  slower  velocity  of  response  for 
bosutinib  at  the  time  the  trial  was  planned,  the  early  comparison  of  MMR  at  week  24  (PEP)  favours 
significantly  asciminib.  Therefore  MMR  rate  at  96  weeks  and  CCyR  rate  at  24  and  96  weeks  are  also 
considered supportive and included in the effects table and the SmPC.  
Uncertainty remains also regarding the characterisation of impact of mutations on asciminib response 
and clonal evolution during treatment therefore the submission of biomarker results of study A2301, 
included in final biomarker report of final CSR is recommended.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of asciminib in treatment of adult patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase previously 
treated  with  two  or  more  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors,  is  based  mainly  on  short-term  data  from  a 
comparative phase 3 study against the approved comparator bosutinib. Supportive Phase 1 safety data 
in a more heterogeneous study population is also available.  
The  incidence  of  AEs  in  all  categories  was  lower  in  the  asciminib  treatment  group  compared  to  the 
bosutinib treatment group, with the exception of fatal SAEs, where no difference was apparent (crude 
frequencies: 1.3 % vs 1.3%, respectively, EAIR calculation was not provided). 
Some  AEs  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  asciminib  treatment  group  (e.g.,  thrombocytopenia, 
arthralgia, hypertension, nasopharyngitis), others occurred more frequently in the bosutinib group (e.g. 
nausea,  diarrhoea,  vomiting,  abdominal  pain,  rash,  AST  increase)  and  e.g.  neutropenia  and  anaemia 
were reported equally in the both groups. 
Thrombocytopenia  (23.1%),  neutropenia  (19.2%),  headache  (18.6%),  fatigue  (13.5%).  arthralgia 
(12.2%),  hypertension  (12.2%),  diarrhoea  (11.5%),  nausea  (11.5%),  and  nasopharyngitis  (10.9%) 
were the AEs (all grades, regardless of study treatment relationship) that occurred most frequently (≥ 
10%)  in  the  asciminib  treatment  group  in  the  Study  A2301.  The  frequency  of  thrombocytopenia  was 
higher in patients in the asciminib group (23.1% vs 14.5% in bosutinib group) and three patients (out 
of in total 11) discontinued treatment with asciminib due to thrombocytopenia. 
Overall  mortality  was  increased  in  asciminib  treated  patients;  5  deaths  occurred  in  the  pivotal  study 
A2301,  4  in  asciminib  and  1  in  bosutinib  treatment  group.  On-treatment  deaths  were  reported  for  3 
patients  with  a  similar  frequency  between  treatment  groups:  2  patients  (1.3%)  in  the  asciminib 
treatment group (embolism arterial and ischaemic stroke) and 1 (1.3%) in the bosutinib treatment group 
(septic shock). In Study X2101 asciminib 80 mg q.d. dose one on-treatment death has occurred due to 
cardiac arrest which is reported as not treatment related. However, in four out of 18 subjects exposed 
with this once daily 80 mg dose regime potential arterial occlusive events were reported.  
Adverse  events  of  special 
interest  (AESIs) 
include  myelosuppression,  pancreatic 
toxicity, 
hypersensitivity,  hepatotoxicity,  hepatitis  B  virus  reactivation,  reproductive  toxicity,  GI  toxicity, 
phototoxicity, QTc prolongation, cardiac failure, edema and fluid retention, ischemic heart disease and 
CNS conditions, and haemorrhage.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Although the applicant in general presumed an improved safety profile and tolerability of Scemblix over 
bosutinib, the evidence for the correctness of this assumption is based on outcome after exposure in the 
small number of 356 patients with a limited follow up. Thus, the assessment of infrequent adverse events 
and interpretation of differences in the observed adverse event profiles remains uncertain as in other 
orphan  drugs.  Myelosuppression,  pancreatic  toxicity,  QTc  prolongation  are  identified  as  important 
identified  risk  and  hepatotoxicity,  hepatitis  B  virus  reactivation,  reproductive  toxicity  as  important 
potential risk in the RMP. Long-term safety and use in in patients with renal and hepatic impairment are 
considered  missing  information.  Several  category  3  PASS  studies  are  imposed  to  address  long  term 
safety and important identified risks.  
Due to the new mode of action different class adverse events may occur beside those well known. For 
example, treatment with ponatinib, a drug also with a different target in BCR-ABL1, is associated with a 
risk for thromboembolic/ arterial occlusive events up to 30 %, which was detected first after approval. 
Current available safety data do not indicate an increased risk for arterial occlusive events (AOE) with 
asciminib treatment. The updated safety data suggests no new safety signals compared to the primary 
data cut-off. Furthermore, no association of AOEs with dose intensity, cumulative dose or duration of 
exposure of asciminib based on the currently available data has been shown. Nevertheless, AOE will be 
closely monitored and registered in upcoming PSURs.  
Patient Related Outcome results suggest improvement in disease-related symptoms, health-related 
quality of life, work productivity and activity impairment with asciminib treatment. Although 
interpretation of PRO outcomes is hampered by the open-label design, the overall impact of the safety 
profile on quality of life seems limited. 
CYP3A4  appeared  to  be  the  major  contributor  to  Phase  I  metabolism  (35.1%  of  total  metabolic 
clearance). Moreover, according to the results of in vitro studies, asciminib has the potential to inhibit 
metabolic enzymes revealed Ki values in low micromolar range for CYP3A4/5, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 
and UGT1A1 as well BCRP, P-gp, MATE2-K, OAT3, and OCT1. In addition, it needs to be considered that 
a  significant  food  effect  was  described,  which  demands  that  the  drug  has  to  be  taken  twice  daily  in 
fasting state. Although these consequences are adequately described in the product information, a lot of 
potential  interactions  and  administration  errors  may  occur  and  could  affect  the  outcome  in  clinical 
practise. Therefore, submission of relevant studies is recommended.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The efficacy of asciminib in patients with PH+ CML-CP treated with two or more TKIs has been shown in 
the pivotal study A2301 compared to an active control, bosutinib, and is supported with data from study 
X2101. The pivotal study met its primary objective with superiority demonstrated for asciminib 40 mg 
BID relative to bosutinib 500 mg QD (MMR rate at 24 weeks was 25.5% vs 13.2%; p-value: 0.029). The 
efficacy of asciminib is irrespective of the number of previous lines of TKIs (3rd, 4th, 5th line).  
Efficacy data has been presented (MMR rate) up till week 96 showing an effect in favour of asciminib 
from week 12 and upward. Consistent to the primary analysis an increase in superiority of efficacy, as 
now  reflected  by  a  more  than  2-fold  improvement  in  MMR  rate  compared  to  bosutinib  at  Week  96; 
37.6.% (95% CI: 29.99, 45.65) in the asciminib arm compared to 15.8 % (95% CI: 8.43, 25.96) in the 
bosutinib  arm,  corresponding  to  a  common  treatment  difference  (after  adjusting  for  baseline  MCyR 
status) can now be confirmed from the updated outcome.  
This demonstrates a robust and mature efficacy for asciminib for the ‘treatment of adult patients with 
Ph+ CML in chronic phase (CP) previously treated with two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors’. However, 
it needs to be considered that only few participants remain in the bosutinib arm due to the low tolerability 
of the 500mg bosutinib dose. 
Further, also the other secondary endpoints support the primary analysis as demonstrated in favour of 
asciminib with a shorter median time to MMR, a higher duration of MMR, deeper responses as reflected 
in the BCR-ABL1 at week 24 IS ≤ 0.01% (MR4 or better), and a higher CCyR by Week 24.  
The asciminib safety profile was in general favorable relative to that of the TKI bosutinib as indicated by 
lower incidences of AEs, AEs with lesser severity, fewer AEs requiring dose adjustments and treatment 
discontinuations with asciminib in pivotal study A2301. Compared to bosutinib, gastro-intestinal adverse 
events and hepatotoxicity events were reported with substantial lower frequencies. The safety profile of 
asciminib is dominated by haematological adverse events of which thrombocytopenia and neutropenia 
were  most  frequently  reported.  Infections  and  haemorrhage  were  reported  with  relatively  high 
frequencies (39.7% and ~10%, respectively), but mostly of low grade (1-2).  Although severe events 
have  been  reported,  myelosuppression  related  events  were  generally  reversible  and  managed  by 
temporarily withholding treatment.  
Overall, no new safety signals have emerged from the safety pool with all patients in pivotal study A2301 
and supportive Study X2101 treated at 40 mg b.i.d., or updated safety data with an additional 9 month 
follow-up in the pivotal study.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy of asciminib compared to bosutinib in patients with PH+ CML-CP treated with two or more TKIs 
has been established in the pivotal study A2301. The safety profile of asciminib was favorable relative 
to  that  of  the  TKI  bosutinib  and  mainly  concerns  myelosuppression  related  adverse  events.  Although 
severe events have been reported in this heavily pre-treated CML population, the safety profile can be 
considered generally manageable with adequate monitoring and dose adjustment.

3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
N/A 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Scemblix is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Scemblix is not similar to Iclusig within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See Appendix on Similarity. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Scemblix is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Scemblix is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic 
myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) previously treated with two or more tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (see section 5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

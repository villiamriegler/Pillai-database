CONFIDENTIAL 
STATEMENT REGARDING LICENSE AGREEMENTS 
This Risk Management Plan has been prepared by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) on behalf of  
ViiV Healthcare (VH) and reviewed and endorsed by VH. GSK provide pharmacovigilance 
(PV) services under contract to VH from within their own PV system, details of which are 
settled in a pharmacovigilance agreement. GSK definitions, processes and/or systems are 
therefore referred to in this report. The integration of the data necessary for the management of 
safety for all products in VH is achieved via use of the GSK PV system; in GSK this is achieved 
by sharing an electronic global safety database. All adverse event (AE) reports for all VH 
marketed products and SAEs for investigational assets are collected into this GSK database, 
from which the information necessary for reporting to various competent authorities is obtained 
and constitutes a key body of data for signal management, risk management plans and aggregate 
safety report generation which is undertaken by GSK under the oversight of VH. 
Whilst GSK are the providers of all operational PV services for VH marketed products,  
as product owner, sponsor of clinical trials and Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH)  
of Medicinal Products, VH is accountable for safety governance of each of its products.  
This includes the decisions on product safety issues and the action to be taken following  
identification and assessment of safety issues by the product review team, such as  
suspension of trials, updates to the product label, and other risk management actions.

Rationale for submitting an updated RMP 
This RMP update follows the CHMP assessment of ViiV Healthcareâ€™s first annual interim reports from 
the additional pharmacovigilance activities (aPV),outlined in Part III, Pharmacovigilance Plan, with 
revisions to the milestone due dates. Other revisions include addition of post authorisation exposure, 
clarification that there is now the option for pregnant women to continue receiving CAB in ViiV 
Healthcare sponsored clinical studies, which is consistent with the approved study protocols, and 
inclusion of all aPV study protocols approved by the EMA and included in the PV Plan.

Brief description of the product 
CAB is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) formulated as a 
tablet for oral use and as a prolonged release suspension for 
intramuscular injection (IM). 
Summary of mode of action: 
CAB inhibits human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) integrase by binding 
to the integrase active site and blocking the strand transfer step of 
retroviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integration, which is essential 
for the HIV replication cycle.

Current: 
Tablets 
Vocabria tablets are indicated in combination with rilpivirine tablets for 
the short-term treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 
(HIV-1) infection in adults who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 
RNAâ€‰<50â€‰copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen without present 
or past evidence of viral resistance to, and no prior virological failure 
with agents of the NNRTI and INI class (see sectionsâ€‰4.2, 4.4 and 5.1) 
for: 
â€¢ oral lead-in to assess tolerability of Vocabria and rilpivirine prior to 
administration of long acting Vocabria injection plus long acting 
rilpivirine injection. 
â€¢ oral therapy for adults who will miss planned dosing with Vocabria 
injection plus rilpivirine injection. 
Suspension for Injection: 
Vocabria injection is indicated, in combination with rilpivirine injection, 
for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) 
infection in adults who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 
copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen without present or past 
evidence of viral resistance to, and no prior virological failure with 
agents of the NNRTI and INI class. 
Proposed: Not applicable 
Dosage in the EEA 
Current: 
The healthcare provider and patient may decide to use cabotegravir 
tablets as an oral lead-in prior to the initiation of Vocabria injection to 
assess tolerability (see Table 1) or may proceed directly to Vocabria 
injections (see Table 2  for monthly and Table 3  for every 2 month 
dosing recommendations). 
Oral lead-in 
When used for oral lead-in, Vocabria tablets together with rilpivirine 
tablets should be taken for approximately one month (at least 28 
days) to assess tolerability to cabotegravir and rilpivirine (see 
section 4.4). 
One Vocabria 30 mg tablet should be taken with one rilpivirine 25 
mg tablet, once daily When administered with rilpivirine, 
cabotegravir tablets should be taken with a meal (see cabotegravir 
tablet prescribing information).

TARGET POPULATION(S)  
SI.1 
Indication  
Incidence of HIV 
While HIV incidence globally has declined in recent years, the European Region has seen an increase in 
HIV diagnoses. In 2017, 159,420 individuals were newly diagnosed with HIV in the European Region, 
a rate of 20.0 new diagnoses per 100,000 population [ECDC, 2018a]. Incidence varies greatly within 
the European Region from a rate of 3.2 diagnoses per 100,000 in the Centre compared to 51.1 cases per 
100,000 population in the East (including Russia) [ECDC, 2018a]. European Union (EU) countries 
have a lower incidence rate of 6.2 diagnoses per 100,000 for a total of 25,353 new diagnoses in 2017 
[ECDC, 2018a]. In all European Region countries men were diagnosed with HIV more frequently than 
women, with male to female ratios ranging from 1.6 in the East to 5.8 in the Centre (3.1 in the EU) 
[ECDC, 2018a]. Of the newly diagnosed persons, 9.3% were 15-24 years old and 16.1% were over the 
age of 50 [ECDC, 2018a]. Of particular concern was the high percentage (53.1%) of individuals newly 
diagnosed with an Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) defining CD4 count (<350 
cells/mm3) [ECDC, 2018a]. This indicates individuals are infected with HIV for longer before 
receiving a diagnosis and treatment and are infectious for a longer period. 
Among newly diagnosed individuals, the transmission mode across the region was most commonly 
heterosexual transmission in both men and women (25.3% and 24.1%, respectively) [ECDC, 2018a]. 
Eastern Europe had a particularly large percentage of individuals infected through injection drug use 
(24.1%) compared to the West (2.7%) and Centre (2.7%) [ECDC, 2018a]. Western Europe (39.7%), 
and to a lesser extent the Centre (28.4%), had the most transmissions due to sex between men, while 
Eastern Europe had very few transmissions due to sex between men (3.9%) [ECDC, 2018a]. Mother-to-
child (MTC) transmission was quite low across the region, ranging from 0.5-0.9% of all new diagnoses 
[ECDC, 2018a]. A large percentage of new diagnoses, particularly in the West (22.5%) and Centre 
(41.2%), were of unknown transmission mode [ECDC, 2018a]. 
Prevalence of HIV  
In 2018, nearly 2.2 million people were estimated to be living with HIV in the European region [ECDC, 
2018b]. The burden of HIV varies greatly by country and region within Europe. The majority of these 
individuals were located in Eastern European countries where the prevalence was 1.36 million. Nearly 
all the 1.36 million people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) are in either Russia, where 998,000 PLWH 
live, or in the Ukraine, where 244,000 PLWH live [ECDC, 2018b]. In Western Europe there are 
776,000 PLWH; however, the number of PLWH is evenly distributed among the more populous 
countries [ECDC, 2018b]. France is home to 156,600 PLWH, Spain to 146,000, Italy to 130,000, the 
United Kingdom to 101,400, and Germany to 86,100 [ECDC, 2018b]. Based on the most current 
population sizes in these countries, the prevalence is highest in Portugal (0.38%), Spain (0.31%), 
France (0.23%), Italy (0.22%), and Switzerland (0.19%). Central Europe has a comparatively small 
population of PLWH at 31,000 with the vast majority of those individuals located in Poland and 
Romania [ECDC, 2018b and National AIDS Centre Agenda of the Ministry of Health, Poland, 2019].

Ribonucleic acid (RNA) <50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no prior treatment 
failure with agents of the Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI) and Integrase 
Strand Transfer Inhibitor (INSTI) class, and with no known or suspected resistance to either CAB or 
rilpivirine. Globally, certain populations such as women, sex workers, men who have sex with men 
(MSM) and persons who inject drugs (PWID) have a higher burden of disease compared with the 
general population. In Europe, the populations most at risk are MSM and PWID; however, 
heterosexual contact was responsible for nearly half of all new diagnoses in 2017 (excluding data from 
the Russian Federation) [ECDC, 2018a]. The Russian Federation has the highest prevalence of 
injection drug use in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, at 2.29%. HIV prevalence in this population 
ranges from 18 to 31% [UNAIDS, 2014]. In the Ukraine, the HIV prevalence among injection drug 
users is nearly 20 times that of the general population. In Estonia and Romania over 50% of injection 
drug users are infected with HIV [UNAIDS, 2014]. HIV prevalence among MSM ranged from 0.6% 
(in Bosnia & Herzegovina) to 17.6% (in the United Kingdom) [Koch Institute, 2017]. 
Several risk factors for the greater prevalence of HIV among MSM have been identified, including high 
numbers of sexual partners, high rate of unprotected anal intercourse, an increase in so-called 
â€˜chemsexâ€™ (use of recreational drugs to facilitate disinhibited sexual activity or similar), use of online 
social and sexual networking sites for meeting sexual partners, co-infection with sexually transmitted 
infections, visiting sex-themed venues, and sex tourism [Koch Institute, 2017]. 
The rate of new HIV diagnoses among men (9.0 per 100,000 population) are more than three times 
the rate among women (2.8 per 100,000 population) and this trend continued in all age- groups 
[ECDC, 2018a]. In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, women comprised about 39% of all adults 
living with HIV in 2017, while in North America and Western and Central Europe, about 23% of all 
those living with HIV were women [UNAIDS 2018]. In EU/European Economic Area countries the 
number of cases of heterosexual transmission of HIV has declined significantly among women from 
5638 in 2008 to 2949 in 2017 [ECDC, 2018a]. In eastern Europe, the Russian Federation has the 
largest population of women living with HIV (370,000), while in Western Europe the largest 
populations are in France (65,000), Italy (39,000), and Spain (34,000) [UNAIDS, 2019]. 
Mother-to-child transmission is fairly rare in the European Region, only accounting for 0.6% of new 
HIV diagnoses in 2017 [ECDC, 2018a]. More importantly, the number of MTC diagnoses has 
decreased by 47% from 673 in 2008 to 360 in 2017 [ECDC, 2018a]. In the eastern region of Europe, 
MTC cases were 0.5% of all new HIV diagnoses and represented a decrease of cases by 30% since 
2008 (348 in 2008 to 242 in 2017). This is considerably larger than the 20 cases (stagnant from 2008) 
of MTC in the Centre and 102 cases in the West 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 
(decrease of 60% since 2008) [ECDC, 2018a]. Overall, it is estimated that over 12,000 children infected 
with HIV via MTC were diagnosed in the European region over the last 10 years [ECDC, 2018a]. 
In high-income countries, racial minorities typically have a higher burden of disease. In Western and 
Central Europe, in 2013 approximately one third of people who were newly diagnosed with HIV 
infection transmitted through heterosexual transmission, in high-endemic regions [ECDC, 2018a]. 
Furthermore, it is estimated that 72,911 migrants to western Europe are infected with HIV; of which 
61,128 know their status, 55,762 are being treated, and 52,914 are virally suppressed. 
In the European region, 80% of PLWH have been diagnosed. Rates of diagnosis range from 87% in the 
West sub-region, 83% in the Centre sub-region, and 76% in the East sub-region. Among those 
diagnosed, 64% in the European region are on antiretroviral therapy (ART), 91% in the West, 73% in 
the Centre, and 46% in the East. Among those who are on ART, 86% of those in the European region 
are virally suppressed, 93% of those in the West, 75% of those in the Centre, and 78% of those in the 
East. Overall, in the European region, 43% of people living with HIV are virally suppressed. These 
figures vary widely based on the region; 74% of people living with HIV are virally suppressed in the 
west sub-region, 46% in the Centre sub-region, and only 26% in East sub-region, one of the lowest 
rates of viral suppression in the world [ECDC, 2018b]. 
Only specific fluids, such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk, from an HIV- infected 
person can transmit HIV. These specific fluids must come in contact with a mucous membrane or 
damaged tissue or be directly injected into the blood-stream (from a needle and/or syringe) for 
transmission to possibly occur [ECDC, 2018b]. Primary risk factors for HIV transmission include 
unprotected vaginal, anal and oral sex, as well as the transfusion of contaminated blood and the sharing 
of contaminated needles and/or syringes, particularly between injection drug users. Unprotected sex 
between men and injection drug use are the primary drivers of HIV transmission in Europe, and 
accounts for the higher proportion of men living with HIV compared to women in these regions 
[WHO, 2011]. 
SI.1.2 
The main existing treatment options  
Treatment of HIV requires use of combination antiretroviral therapy (CAR). The choice of the 
combination regimen depends on the status of the patient, particularly in terms of plasma HIV viral 
load, CD4+ cell counts, any previous treatment(s), prior treatment failure, and tolerability of the 
treatment on the part of the individual. Treatment guidelines have been developed to guide clinicians in 
selecting appropriate treatments for patients. The most commonly used guidelines are those developed 
by the World Health Organization (WHO) [WHO, 2018], the European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) 
[EACS, 2018] and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) in the United States of 
America (USA) [DHHS, 2018]. However, many countries have developed their own national 
guidelines to reflect the local epidemic. 
The management of treatment-experienced patients is a different process from that of 
treatment-naÃ¯ve patients. Treatment-experienced patients may require different combinations of drugs 
due to, for example, adverse events, consideration of drug-drug interactions for patients 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 
requiring concomitant medication due to co-morbidities, drug resistance, a desire to lower pill burden, 
simplification of dosing and regimen preference. Special populations, such as pregnant women and 
patients co-infected with tuberculosis or hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV) infection may also require 
different regimens based on their specific situations and a need to decrease the risk of adverse 
outcomes such as congenital anomalies (in the case of pregnant women), or drug-drug interactions in 
the case of co-infected patients. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to refer to the guidelines 
(EACS Guidelines and British HIV Association (BHIVA) Guidelines) in consideration of selecting the 
most appropriate antiretroviral regimen [EACS, 2018 and BHIVA, 2016). 
SI.1.3 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the (untreated) 
population, including mortality and morbidity  
The number of people dying from AIDS-related causes began to decline in the mid-2000s because of 
increased use of ART and the steady decline in HIV incidence since the peak in 1997. In 2015, an 
estimated 1.1 million (940,000â€“1.3 million) people died from AIDS-related causes worldwide, 
representing a 35% decline in AIDS-related mortality from 2010, when 1.5 million (95% Confidence 
Intervals: 1.3 millionâ€“1.7 million) AIDS-related deaths occurred [UNAIDS, 2016]. Western and 
Central Europe and North America experienced a 24% decline in AIDS-related deaths from 2010 to 
2015; in contrast, Eastern Europe and Central Asia experienced a 24% increase in AIDS-related 
mortality [UNAIDS, 2016]. In 2015, there were an estimated 22,000 (20,000-24,000) AIDS-related 
deaths in Western and Central Europe and North America, and 47,000 (39,000-55,000) AIDS-related 
deaths in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Sub-Saharan Africa experienced a 29% decline in AIDS-
related deaths between 2010 and 2015. More modest declines occurred in Asia and the Pacific (25%) 
and Latin America (17%) during the same period [UNAIDS, 2016].

PART II: MODULE SII - NON-CLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY 
SPECIFICATION  
Key safety findings from non-clinical studies with CAB and relevance to human 
usage:  
Relevance to human usage 
Experience to date has not confirmed a risk in 
humans associated with CAB use at 
recommended clinical doses; therefore, this effect 
is not expected to impact the target population. 
Key Safety findings (from non-clinical 
studies) 
Single and repeat dose toxicity 
Bone marrow depletion 
In monkeys: microscopic changes occurred in the bone 
marrow with corresponding changes in peripheral 
leukocyte, reticulocyte and platelet counts in males given 
1000 mg/kg/day (mkd) in the 14-day toxicity study. Bone 
marrow depletion was characterised by a generalised 
decrease in cellularity of all precursor cells. Subsequent 
data indicate this finding was most probably related to the 
overall moribund condition of the animals and not a direct 
toxic effect of CAB, since it was not observed at lower 
doses or in other species 
Hepatology findings: 
No indications of hepatotoxic potential of CAB were 
observed in nonclinical studies. 
Experience to date has identified a risk in humans. 
A small number of drug induced liver injury (DILI) 
cases were observed in Phase II studies at 
recommended clinical doses. 
Experience to date, including a thorough QTc 
clinical study, has not confirmed the risk in 
humans associated with CAB use, therefore this 
finding is not expected to impact target 
population. 
Cardiovascular effects (including potential for QT 
interval prolongation) 
In monkeys: a single dose of oral CAB at 1000 mkd in 
conscious, non-restrained male monkeys produced mild, 
transient increases in mean arterial pressure (3.7 to 8.6%) 
and a transient increase in heart rates (16 to 23%) during 
the first 2 h after dosing. No blood pressure or heart rate 
changes were seen in monkeys after ~ 3 weeks at 500 
mkd. There were no adverse effects on the heart (organ 
weight or histopathology) and no electrocardiogram (ECG) 
waveform or interval changes.

CONFIDENTIAL 
Key Safety findings (from non-clinical 
studies) 
Reproductive Toxicity 
Relevance to human usage 
CAB did not show a teratogenic potential or effect on 
reproductive function. The reproductive and 
developmental toxicity studies did not demonstrate any 
effects on fertility or fecundity, or maternal behaviour. 
There is no anticipated risk in humans based on 
the non-clinical study findings. CAB is not 
recommended during pregnancy unless the 
expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the 
foetus. 
The clinical significance in humans of the non- 
clinical pre- and post-natal findings in rats is 
unknown. Effects seen in the PPN study were at 
doses >30 times the systemic exposure at the 
maximum recommended human dose (exposure 
data from 26-week rat study) [m1.3].CAB is not 
recommended during pregnancy unless the 
expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the 
foetus. 
Developmental toxicity 
Effects of exposure in late stage pregnancy 
A pre- and post-natal (PPN) study conducted in rats 
demonstrated delayed onset of parturition, and in some 
rats, this delay was associated with an increased number 
of stillbirths and neonatal mortalities immediately after 
birth. Decreases in F1 pup survival and viability resulting in 
reduced litter sizes during the first 4 days of life at the 
maximum tested dose of 1000 mkd. In a follow up cross- 
fostering study, vehicle control or CAB at 1000 mkd was 
given orally by gavage to mated female rats on Gestation 
Day 6 through Lactation Day 7. Results from this study 
produced a similar decrease in pup survival and viability 
during the first 4 days of life as compared to findings from 
the first study (87.4% versus 98.9% in control). Further, 
results suggest that it is likely that the decrease in pup 
survival during the first 4 days of life is related to 
gestational exposure to CAB. This is supported by the lack 
of effects on postnatal deaths among control foster pups 
exposed to the test article via milk. There was no foetal 
mortality when rat foetuses were delivered by caesarean. 
Collectively these data suggested that a delay in the onset 
of parturition in rats receiving 1000 mkd led to increased 
foetal mortality (stillbirths) and neonatal deaths in a subset 
of rats immediately after birth. 
Juvenile toxicity 
No indications of juvenile toxicity of CAB were 
observed in non-clinical studies. 
Non-clinical data for CAB do not indicate a 
safety concern for humans.

CONFIDENTIAL 
Key Safety findings (from non-clinical 
studies) 
Genotoxicity 
Relevance to human usage 
No indications of a genotoxic potential of CAB were 
observed in genotoxicity tests (in vitro and in vivo). 
Non-clinical data for CAB do not indicate a 
safety concern for humans. 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in CD1 mice and 
Sprague Dawley rats over 104 weeks. Results indicate 
there was no CAB-related effect on the distribution of 
non-neoplastic or neoplastic lesions contributing to death 
or preterminal euthanasia of animals in the study and no 
non-neoplastic or neoplastic test item-related 
macroscopic and microscopic pathology findings. No 
indication of carcinogenetic potential was observed in 
tests for CAB. 
General safety pharmacology: 
There were no key safety findings from safety 
pharmacology studies for CAB. 
Mechanisms for drug interactions 
In vitro, no clinical drug interaction risk was identified for 
co-administered substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4, uridine 
5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1, 
1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9, 2B4, 2B7, 2B15, and 2B17,

multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) 1, MATE 2-K, 
multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 2, or

The non-clinical data for CAB do not indicate a 
safety concern for humans. 
Since there were no safety findings from 
safety pharmacology studies there is no 
indication of an unacceptable risk for 
administration of CAB to patients. 
CAB is not expected to affect the 
pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates of 
these enzymes or transporters. 
The following list comprises drugs for which 
significant decreases in CAB plasma 
concentrations may occur due to UGT1A1

CAB in vitro. 
CAB was shown to be an inhibitor of organic anion

No dose adjustment is required when CAB is co-
administered with OAT1/3 substrates, including 
sensitive substrates with narrow therapeutic 
indices, such as tenofovir disproxil fumarate 
(TDF) and methotrexate. Consistent with the lack 
of clinically relevant changes in OAT1/3 
substrates predicted by mechanistic static and 
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling, 
the renal safety data for oral CAB in combination 
with 
two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors 
(NRTIs), including the sensitive OAT1/3

clinically relevant inhibitor of OAT1/3.

PART II: MODULE SIII - CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE  
During clinical development of CAB (with Rilpivirine), the HIV treatment clinical trials described below 
have been conducted. Clinical trials with CAB for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis are not in scope of this 
RMP. 
The combination of oral CAB (10, 30, or 60 mg once daily) and oral RPV (25 mg once daily) has been 
administered to HIV-infected subjects in Study LATTE (LAI116482) (Phase IIb). All oral doses of 
CAB achieved durable suppression of HIV infection with a two-drug (CAB+RPV) maintenance 
regimen, and CAB was well tolerated across all doses studied. CAB 30 mg once daily was selected for 
use in studies LATTE-2 (200056), FLAIR (201584, and ATLAS (201585) based on pharmacokinetic, 
safety and efficacy results of Study LATTE (LAI116482). In Study 200056 (LATTE-2), subjectsâ€™ 
HIV-1 RNA suppression was induced with a three-drug antiretroviral regimen consisting of CAB + 
abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) fixed dose combination and then switched to a two-drug two-class 
regimen consisting of CAB long acting (LA) + RPV LA for the maintenance of HIV-1 RNA 
suppression. The overall objective of this study was to select an intramuscular dosing regimen of 
CAB+RPV LA based on a comparison of the Week 32 antiviral activity, tolerability, and safety of two 
IM dosing regimens, relative to CAB 30 mg plus ABC/3TC orally once daily, in HIV-1 infected 
antiretroviral-naÃ¯ve subjects. Subjects in the POLAR (209035) IIb study initiated CAB LA 600 mg + 
RPV LA 900 mg Q2M after transition from oral CAB 30 mg + RPV 25 mg in the LATTE 
(LAI116482) study. The CUSTOMIZE (209493) study was a phase IIIb, implementation study, of 
virologically-suppressed PLHIV receiving oral CAB 30 mg + RPV 25 mg once daily for 4 weeks, then 
IM CAB LA 600 mg + RPV LA 900 mg at Month 1, followed by IM CAB LA 400 mg + RPV LA 600 
mg every month through Month 12. 
CAB+RPV LA is an effective and well tolerated regimen for the maintenance of HIV-1 suppression, 
based on the Week 48 data from the two pivotal Phase III trials with CAB+RPV ( FLAIR (201584) 
and ATLAS (201585)). The Phase III trials showed that CAB+RPV LA is non-inferior to daily oral 
current antiretroviral regimen (CAR) in maintaining virologic suppression in HIV-1 infected subjects. 
Data from the Phase III/IIIb studies shows a small number of patients with confirmed virologic failure 
(CVF) that developed drug resistance. The Week 48 data from the Phase IIIb, ATLAS-2M (207966) 
trial, designed to assess the antiviral activity and safety of CAB+RPV LA dosing once every 4 weeks 
(Q4W) compared with 
CAB+RPV LA dosing once every 8 weeks (Q8W) in HIV-1 infected, virologically suppressed, adult 
subjects showed similar levels of viral suppression on the Q8W arm compared with the Q4W arm. 
Cumulatively, 2233 individuals up to 21 February 2020 were exposed to CAB in Phase II and III and 
IIIb ViiV Healthcare sponsored HIV treatment clinical trials.

PART II: MODULE SIV - POPULATIONS NOT STUDIED IN CLINICAL 
TRIALS  
There were no trials conducted specifically in special patient populations (e.g. pregnant or lactating 
women) as part of the development program for CAB. 
Missing information relevant for the approved indication is included in module SVII. 
SIV.1 
Exclusion criteria in pivotal clinical studies within the 
development programme  
All pivotal Phase III and IIIb clinical trials were conducted with the CAB+RPV LA combination 
regimen, so the exclusion criteria of the pivotal trials apply to the combination regimen and are not 
CAB LA specific 
Criterion 
Reason for exclusion 
Subjects with advanced 
HCV or requiring 
treatment for HCV during 
the first 48 weeks of 
maintenance therapy

Rationale 
Asymptomatic subjects with 
stable HCV were allowed to 
enrol in the Phase II, III and IIIb 
trials for CAB+RPV provided 
that certain criteria were met, 
including that these subjects 
did not have advanced liver 
disease and were assessed by 
the investigator that HCV 
treatment was not necessary 
during the study. 
Treatment with CAB+RPV in 
these HCV coinfected subjects 
will be guided by established 
guidance and medical practice. 
Limited data are available and 
do not indicate that these stable 
co- infected patients have 
different efficacy and safety 
outcomes compared to mono 
infected HIV patients. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
Rationale 
There  are  limited  data  from 
the  use  of  CAB  in  pregnant 
women. 
While reproductive toxicity 
testing has not identified a risk 
for CAB based on nonclinical 
findings, at recommended 
clinical doses, there have been 
no adequate and well controlled 
clinical studies of CAB in 
pregnant women.

Renal elimination is not a

significant effect of severe 
renal impairment on CAB 
metabolism is not anticipated. 
Moderate renal impairment did 
not have a significant effect on

renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance <30 mL/min and not

The clinical development programme is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions such as 
rare adverse reactions, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those caused by prolonged or 
cumulative exposure.

reactions 
Which are rare 
At the data-cut for the initial 
submission, CAB had been used in 
2233 subjects with HIV infection. 
Given that over 2233 subjects have 
been exposed to CAB at the time of 
initial submission, then there is a >99% 
probability that very common (>1 in 10) 
and common (>1 in 100) adverse events 
would have been observed. 
Although information on long-term (256 
weeks) safety is limited to a group of 
313 subjects (>3 years) from the 
LATTE-2 trial, no long-term adverse 
effect of CAB is apparent to date. 
Longer term data from study LAI116482 
(n=132 at 144 weeks) demonstrated that 
the combination of oral CAB+RPV had 
long term durability with a low rate of 
discontinuation due to virologic failure; 
as well as a safety and tolerability profile 
that was generally favourable. 
The long-term safety of CAB will be 
monitored through routine 
pharmacovigilance 
There were no new safety signals 
identified during CAB studies that might 
have been due to cumulative effects. No 
specific organ toxicity was detected. 
Due to prolonged 
exposure 
There is safety data available for 
809 subjects receiving CAB at the 
recommended dose for 1 to 2 
years, approximately 502 subjects 
receiving CAB for 2 to 3 years and 
approximately 313 subjects 
receiving CAB for 3 years or longer.

HCV co-infection 
Patients with moderate to 
severe hepatic impairment,

Asymptomatic subjects with stable HCV were allowed to enrol in the 
Phase III and IIIb CAB clinical studies provided that certain criteria 
were met, including that these subjects did not have advanced liver 
disease and were assessed by the investigator that HCV treatment 
was not necessary during the study up to primary endpoint. Beyond 
this timepoint, subjects in the study were allowed to receive treatment 
for HCV. During the Phase III studies, subjects co-infected with HCV 
(n=41) (based on HCV serology alone at Baseline) had similar 
treatment outcomes as mono-infected HIV subjects. 
Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment were excluded

The majority of subjects who enrolled into the Phase III CAB clinical 
studies were CDC category HIV infection stage 1 or 2, but there was 
a very limited number of subjects who were CDC category HIV 
infection stage 3 at baseline (approximately 6 (1%) subjects in Phase 
III). 
Subjects with genetic polymorphisms were not in general excluded 
from the CAB clinical studies. In trials where ABC-containing drugs

PART II: MODULE SV - POST-AUTHORISATION EXPERIENCE  
SV.1 
Post-authorisation exposure  
Cabotegravir for HIV treatment received its first marketing authorisation approval in Canada on 18 
March 2020. Based on the cumulative post-marketing exposure the benefit-risk profilefor CAB, in 
combination with RPV, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in its approved patient population remains 
favourable.  
SV.1.1  Method used to calculate exposure  
The algorithms used to derive post-approval exposure data are as follows: 
â€¢  For the film-coated tablet formulation, a standard dose of cabotegravir of 30 mg once daily for 30 days 
is assumed (presented per course â€“ 30 days = 1 course). Please note that for the oral formulation it is 
not possible to distinguish between use for HIV treatment and for PrEP. 
â€¢  For the IM injection formulation, a standard dose of 1 vial of cabotegravir (200 mg/mL) per month 
administered at the same time as 1 vial of rilpivirine (300 mg/mL) is assumed (presented as patient 
years). Please note: from the post-marketing sales data provided, it is not possible to distinguish 
between 4-weekly and 8 -weekly dosing, since vial sizes are not provided as part of the exposure data.  
SV.1.2 
Exposure  
Based on IQVIA data, an estimated 8088 patients have received 1 course of oral cabotegravir tablets 
during the period 01 July 2020 to 31 December 2022.  
The absolute number of vials of cabotegravir 200 mg/mL sold is 139 530, equivalent to an estimated 
cumulative exposure of 11 627 patient years. This can be broken down as follows:  
â€¢  23 789 vials of cabotegravir 200 mg/mL sold as Vocabria for HIV treatment, equivalent to an 
estimated exposure of 1982 patient years. 
â€¢  100 058 vials of cabotegravir + rilpivirine 200 mg/mL+300 mg/mL sold as Cabenuva for HIV 
treatment, equivalent to an estimated exposure of 8338 patient years.  
â€¢  15 683 vials of cabotegravir 200 mg/mL sold as Apretude for PrEP equivalent to an estimated 
exposure of 1307 patient years.

CONFIDENTIAL 
PART II: MODULE SVI - ADDITIONAL EU REQUIREMENTS FOR THE 
SAFETY SPECIFICATION  
Potential for misuse for illegal purposes  
The Marketing Authorisation Holder does not consider that there is a potential for misuse for illegal 
purposes with CAB. 
The INI class of compounds has no known drug abuse potential. There are no data suggesting that CAB 
has the potential to lead to illicit use, abuse, or dependency. 
No studies to investigate the potential for abuse or dependency with CAB have been performed given 
that: a) CAB is not centrally active, b) there is evidence that this compound has low blood brain barrier 
penetration, c) mechanistically, CAB does not interact with neurotransmitters/receptors involved in the 
drug-dependence mechanism, d) preclinical and clinical data available are not indicative of a potential 
for drug abuse and e) CAB will be administered in a healthcare setting by Healthcare Professionals 
(HCPs), which would further reduce any chance for misuse.

PART II: MODULE SVII - IDENTIFIED AND POTENTIAL RISKS  
SVII.1 
Identification of safety concerns in the initial RMP submission  
SVII 1.1  Risks not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety 
concerns in the RMP  
Not all adverse drug reactions or safety concerns for CAB are considered important risks for inclusion in 
the list of safety concerns in the RMP. Further information on these and the reason they are not considered 
important risks for CAB is provided below. 
Known risks that require no further characterisation and are followed up via routine 
pharmacovigilance namely through signal detection and adverse reaction reporting, and for which 
the risk minimisation messages in the product information are adhered by prescribers (e.g. actions 
being part of standard clinical practice in each EU Member state where the product is authorised):   
The majority of the adverse drug reactions that occurred in the Phase III clinical studies were non-
serious and Grade 1 or 2 in severity [m 2.5 Section 5.4.1.1]. These adverse drug reactions are included 
in the SmPC (Section 4.8). 
Psychiatric disorders: Depression, Anxiety, Abnormal dreams, Insomnia. 
Nervous system disorders: Headache, Dizziness, Somnolence, Vasovagal reactions (in 
response to injections) 
Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea, Vomiting, Abdominal pain, Flatulence, Diarrhoea. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash (includes the Medical dictionary for regulatory activities 
(MedDRA)  terms:  rash  erythematous,  rash  generalised,  rash  macular,  rash  maculo-  papular,  rash 
morbilliform, rash papular. rash pruritic) 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Myalgia 
General disorders and administrative site conditions: Injection site reactions (pain and discomfort, site 
nodule, induration, swelling, erythema, pruritus, bruising, warmth, haematoma, cellulitis, abscess, 
anaesthesia, haemorrhage, discolouration), Fatigue, Asthenia, Malaise, Pyrexia (includes the MedDRA 
terms: body temperature increased, feeling hot). 
Investigations:  Weight  increased,  Transaminase  increased,  Blood  bilirubin  increased,  Lipase 
elevations. 
In addition, the following safety concerns specific to CAB are not considered to lead to important risks 
for the product and are therefore not included as safety concerns in the RMP: 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Drug interactions with strong UGT1A1 inducers:  
Co-administration significantly decreases CAB plasma concentrations, increasing the potential for loss of 
therapeutic effect and development of resistance: Rifampin, rifapentine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, 
carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine [m.2.7.2 Section 2.5.6]. Based on these findings, co-administration of 
these compounds with CAB is contra-indicated in the product SmPC [see also PART II: MODULE SII ]. 
Drug interactions with antacids (polyvalent cations):  
Co administration has the potential to decrease oral CAB plasma concentration and has not been 
studied, this could increase the potential for loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance 
[m.2.7.2 Section 2.5.6]. Based on these findings, co-administration of antacid compounds with CAB 
are recommended at least 2 hours before or 4 hours after oral CAB in the product SmPC [see also 
PART II: MODULE SII ]. 
Opportunistic infections  
Patients receiving CAB or any other ART may still develop opportunistic infections and other 
complications of HIV infection. Therefore, the product SmPC states the patients should remain under 
close clinical observation by physicians experienced in the treatment of these associated HIV diseases. 
Transmission of infection  
While effective viral suppression with ART has been proven to substantially reduce the risk of sexual 
transmission, a residual risk cannot be excluded. The product SmPC states that precautions to prevent 
transmission should be taken in accordance with national guidelines. 
Drug Resistance  
All antivirals are prone to the selection of resistance in the setting of archived transmitted substitutions 
and/or incomplete adherence to therapy or low drug exposure for any reason. Cases of confirmed 
virologic failure with drug resistance were observed in a small number of participants in the CAB 
development programme but these were uncommon (<1.5% (n=7) in Phase III at Week 48) [m2.5 
section 4.6.2.3]. In the Phase IIIb ATLAS-2M study 10 subjects met CVF criteria through Week 48: 8 
subjects (1.5%) in the Q8W arm and 2 subjects (0.4%) in the Q4W arm [2019N406358_00]. The impact 
on the risk-benefit balance is low for the individual patients, provided patients remain in care as 
alternative treatment options are available if drug resistance or virologic failure occurs and oral standard 
of care regimens have been successful in achieving re-suppression. Given the low number of CVFs with 
identified resistance, the likelihood of resistance occurring in clinical practice is low. 
Suicidal behaviours  
As suicidal behaviours have been seen with other INSTIs, prospective suicidality monitoring 
was conducted during the course of Phase II and Phase III treatment studies. 
Suicidality assessments were collected prospectively during Phase II and Phase III studies using the 
eC-SSRS (m2.7.4 Section 2.1.6.6). Validated true positive alerts for suicidality assessments occurred 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 
at lower incidence in the CAB+RPV group compared with the CAR group during Phase III studies 
(3 subjects [<1%] in the CAB+RPV group; 6 subjects [1%] in the CAR group). There were seven 
serious reports of suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts with treatment with CAB+RPV during 
Phase II (m2.7.4 Section 2.1.6.6). There were no completed suicides, drug-related serious reports, or 
withdrawals from treatment with CAB+RPV, during the Phase II, III and IIIb trials. 
There is currently insufficient evidence to conclude that there is an association between suicidal 
ideation and suicidal behaviour with treatment with CAB+RPV to designate it as an important safety 
concern in the RMP. 
Adverse reactions with clinical consequences, even serious, but occurring with a low 
frequency and considered to be acceptable in relation to the severity of the indication 
treated:   
Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity reactions of the delayed type have been reported with other INSTIs (raltegravir and 
dolutegravir) and were characterised by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes, organ 
dysfunction, including hepatic failure. Administration of cabotegravir oral lead-in was used in 
clinical studies to help identify patients who may be at risk of a hypersensitivity reaction. Analysis of 
data from the FLAIR (201584) study at Week 124, and the overall OLI experience in Phase III/IIIB 
Studies, including FLAIR (201584), ATLAS (201585), and ATLAS 2-M (207966) evaluating safety 
and efficacy of CAB + RPV was performed. At Week 124 for the FLAIR (201584) study, patients 
electing to switch (at Week 
100) from abacavir (ABC)/dolutegravir (DTG)/lamivudine (3TC) to CAB + RPV in the Extension 
Phase, with and without an oral lead-in phase; creating an OLI group and a direct to injection (DTI) 
group. No cases of confirmed hypersensitivity were identified from this analysis in phase III studies 
and no safety concern was identified to preclude progression to DTI. No delayed type hypersensitivity 
reactions reports have been received during the CAB clinical development programme to date. The 
theoretical risk of hypersensitivity does not impact the overall risk-benefit profile of CAB as while its 
impact may be severe for an individual patient, considering the absence of reports in clinical 
development, it is expected to occur uncommonly or rarely. 
Other reasons for considering the risks not important:   
Potential for Off-label use 
Off-label use of CAB is possible as the indication restricts use to a clearly specified HIV infected 
population, in combination with RPV. Appropriate use of CAB+RPV is described in the SmPC. The 
risk of inappropriate use is considered low as prescribers are expected to adhere to the directions for 
use in the SmPC. The scenarios of potential off label use described below will be followed via routine 
pharmacovigilance, namely through signal detection and adverse reaction reporting. Relevant risk 
minimisation messages are included in the SmPC. 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Off label use as such is not considered an important risk for inclusion in the RMP as the outcomes of off 
label use scenarios described below are not expected to lead to serious clinical consequences. Clear 
advice in product labelling, widespread availability of alternatives including fixed dose combinations 
and treatment guidelines are anticipated to minimise the off- label usage in the following scenarios; 
Off label use of tablet dosage form  
Section 4.2 of the SmPC had language recommending that CAB should be first administered as an oral 
medication for 1 month (at least 28 days) in virologically suppressed patients prior to the initiation of 
CAB injection. While the oral lead-in stage is currently recommended, optional use has been evaluated 
in the development programme and review of safety data from the FLAIR (201584) Week 124 study 
analysis showed that initiating the CAB LA + RPV LA regimen with or without OLI (DTI) did not 
identify any new safety concerns related to omitting the OLI phase. At Week 124, rates of virologic 
suppression (HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL) were similar in both DTI (110/111 [99.1%]) and OLI groups 
(113/121 [93.4%]). The proposed DUS will assess drug usage patterns (Table 10). 
Off-label use of tablets in combination with antiretrovirals other than RPV  
The use of oral CAB together with other oral antiretrovirals is not indicated in the SmPC and as noted 
above is not thought to be a likely scenario given the availability of alternative fixed dose oral 
treatments. During the development programme, oral CAB has been administered in combination with 
ABC and 3TC during the induction phases of Phase II (LATTE + LATTE-2) studies. There were no 
concerning safety issues associated with the regimen, and CAB is not thought to present a safety issue 
if used in this way. 
Off-label use as first-line therapy  
It is unknown if resistance emergence may be more likely in subjects that are not already virally 
suppressed at treatment initiation with CAB+RPV. However, Section 4.1 of the SmPC clearly states 
that CAB injection is indicated, in combination with RPV injection, for the treatment of HIV-1 
infection in adults who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) without resistance to 
or past evidence of viral resistance to, and no prior virological failure with agents of the NNRTI and 
INI class. The treatment naÃ¯ve population has not been studied in the clinical development programme 
and CAB+RPV is clearly positioned as a switch regimen. 
Use in patients who are not virologically suppressed and unable to fully adhere to treatment 
regimen  
Section 4.2 of the SmPC states that prior to starting CAB, HCPs should carefully select patients 
who agree to the required injection dosing schedule and counsel patients about the importance of 
adherence to scheduled dosing visits to help maintain viral suppression and reduce the risk of viral 
rebound and potential development of resistance with missed doses. Section 4.1 of the SmPC states 
that subjects must be virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA 
<50 copies/mL) when starting treatment. The maintenance of virological suppression may be 
disrupted for example, in patients who struggle with adherence to oral regimens due to 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 
psychiatric disorders or that have gastrointestinal malabsorption issues who start the regimen while not 
fully suppressed. The issue of non-compliance is addressed in section SVII.3.1. 
Off-label use in adolescent population  
Section 4.8 of the SmPC states the safety and efficacy of CAB in children and adolescents aged under 18 
years have not been established. No data are currently available in the adolescent population, studies are 
planned as part of the paediatric clinical development. The risk of off- label use in this population is low, 
as clinicians will be aware of the limitations of data availability in the adolescent population. The 
availability of well-established treatments recommended in this population, may minimise the off-label 
usage in this scenario. The data from a DUS looking into usage patterns will indicate if there is use in 
adolescents. 
SVII.1.2  Risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety 
concerns in the RMP  
Important Identified Risk #1: Hepatotoxicity 
A risk of elevated transaminases has been observed with other INSTIs including dolutegravir and 
raltegravir. In Phase I, II, III and IIIb clinical studies, six participants exposed to oral CAB (60 mg n=2; 
30 mg n=4) had suspected DILI, one of whom was a healthy volunteer. No participant receiving CAB 
LA has developed suspected DILI to the date-lock point of this RMP. Administration of CAB oral 
lead-in was used in clinical studies to help identify patients who may be at risk of hepatotoxicity. 
Analysis from the FLAIR (201584) study at Week 124, including data from the Phase III/IIIB 
including studies ATLAS (201585), and ATLAS 2-M (207966), evaluating safety and efficacy of CAB 
+ RPV was performed. Investigators and patients elected to switch (at Week 100) from abacavir 
(ABC)/dolutegravir (DTG)/lamivudine (3TC) to CAB + RPV in the Extension Phase, with and without 
an oral lead-in phase, creating an OLI group and a DTI group. From the FLAIR (201584) Week 124 
analysis, overall initiating CAB LA + RPV LA regimen in studies FLAIR (201584), ATLAS (201585), 
and ATLAS 2-M (207966) with DTI, did not identify any new hepatotoxicity related safety concerns 
related to omitting the OLI phase. 
Risk Benefit Impact: Mild to moderate hepatoxicity, manifested as elevations in aminotransferases, 
was observed in six subjects exposed to CAB oral during the clinical trial programme, which resolved 
on cessation of drug treatment. If similar toxicity were to occur in patients receiving CAB LA in 
clinical practice, this could theoretically progress to more a serious nature and prolong the resolution 
of signs and symptoms since measurable CAB levels would persist, potentially for several months. 
Occurrence of DILI would require clinical management of the patient hepatic disorder and adoption of 
an alternative antiretroviral regimen. In the context of HIV treatment, the risk-benefit impact is 
considered acceptable given the availability of alternative treatments, and infrequency of DILI in the 
clinical programme. 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Important Potential Risk #2: Medication errors including treatment non- compliance  
Factors that could negatively impact therapeutic levels of the treatment leading to potential for 
treatment failure and/or resistance development include: if the CAB+RPV LA regimen component 
drugs are not administered correctly; the individual injectable components of the CAB+RPV LA 
regimen are not administered at the same time, as required; the patient does not receive their repeat 
injections within the specified window for dosing; the patient does not adhere to their injection visits; or 
the treatment with CAB+RPV LA is discontinued for any reason without the recipient moving onto 
another fully suppressive ARV regimen. The SmPC and Instructions for use (IFU) have been developed 
to minimise the risk of medication errors or lack of compliance with regimen requirements. 
Risk-Benefit impact: If the combination regimen is not administered correctly as per the proposed 
labelling, there is a risk of lower than intended drug doses, increased risk of adverse events, confusion 
over dosing strategy between Q4W and Q8W, or of monotherapy with either component of the dual 
regimen being delivered to patients. In turn, this may result in potential loss of viral suppression and/or 
increase the likelihood of emergence of viral resistance, especially if the patient discontinues without 
switching onto another suppressive Antiretroviral (ARV) regimen. In addition, patient non-adherence 
to their injection visit schedule could also negatively impact the effectiveness of CAB+RPV LA. As 
the treatment delivery is by healthcare professionals, the likelihood of medication errors is low. While 
the probability of medication errors such as maladministration, or confusion between available 
regimens may be higher at the time of initial market availability, it is anticipated the risk will reduce as 
HCPs become more familiar with the use of the product.

Hepatic failure, fibrosis and cirrhosis and other liver damage (SMQ Narrow Search) 
Potential mechanisms:

CONFIDENTIAL 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
Clinical trials have shown that transient elevations of liver enzymes (transaminitis) can potentially 
occur with a CAB-containing regimen for a variety of reasons; these events are uncommon. 
Clinical study data from the development programme with CAB provide the evidence for this risk 
(detailed below).

There have been four cases meeting liver stopping criteria that were compatible with DILI that occurred 
in subjects on CAB during the Phase IIb clinical trial programme. All four of the suspected DILI cases 
occurred during oral dosing. 
LATTE-2 (200056) 
The first subject from 200056 had underlying hepatic steatosis as a possible risk factor and 44 days after 
receiving oral CAB 30 mg and ABC/3TC developed ALT of 9x ULN, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
6.4x ULN and bilirubin within normal limits. The subject discontinued ART and the transaminases 
stabilised after approximately 8 weeks. The second subject had chronic active HCV and grade 3/4 
fibrosis and developed ALT of 7x ULN, AST 11x ULN and bilirubin 2x ULN 4 weeks after initiation of 
oral CAB 30 mg and ABC/3TC. The subject discontinued ART and transaminases stabilised after 
approximately one week. No alternative cause for the liver stopping criteria was identified for both cases. 
LATTE (LAI116482) 
This was a dose finding Phase II study in which two subjects receiving CAB 60 mg during the oral 
induction phase met liver stopping criteria (Grade 4 ALT). Routine chemistries for both subjects 
revealed rises in ALT values to 12x ULN, which returned to pre-treatment levels approximately 2 to 4 
weeks after discontinuing drug. The ALT elevation was considered possibly related to CAB and no 
definitive alternative etiology for the rise was identified. Both subjects remained asymptomatic and 
neither subject developed a concomitant elevation in bilirubin, no alternative cause for meeting the 
liver stopping criteria was identified for either case. 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Pharmacokinetic study (205712) 
An additional case was identified in this repeat dose pharmacokinetic drug interaction study to identify 
the potential for drug-drug interaction between oral CAB and rifabutin. 
A 50 to 60-year old male developed Grade 3 elevations in liver aminotransferases three weeks after co-
administration of oral CAB 30 mg and rifabutin 300 mg ended. Liver workup was unremarkable except 
for a fatty liver on ultrasound examination, the subject was asymptomatic throughout and the findings 
were consistent with a mixed hepatocellular and cholestatic type hepatitis. The elevated liver 
aminotransferases (ALT 8.34x ULN, bilirubin within normal limits) fully resolved after approximately 
2-3 weeks off study drugs. The investigator considered that there was a reasonable possibility of a 
causal relationship to CAB and rifabutin exposure, therefore the corresponding serious adverse event 
was reported as related to the study medications. 
Phase III 
During the pivotal Phase III studies (ATLAS and FLAIR) there have been no cases of suspected DILI, 
or hepatocellular injury attributed to CAB. No DILI cases were noted from the FLAIR (201584) study 
analysis evaluating safety and efficacy of CAB + RPV at Week 124 for patients electing to switch (at 
Week 100) to DTI, in consultation with their HCPs. None of these events in the randomized CAB + 
RPV group during Maintenance + Extension Phase (Day 1 to Week 124) were considered to represent 
DILI. 
Phase IIIb 
During the Phase IIIb trial (ATLAS 2M), 1 case of possibly DILI was observed in a subject receiving 
oral CAB+RPV, resulting in a transient rise in ALT and AST (ALT 206 U/L [>4x ULN], AST 137 U/L 
[>3x ULN] with no elevation in bilirubin at week 4a after receiving 28 days of oral CAB+RPV. 
Investigations were negative for viral hepatitis; syphilis and an autoimmune screen. The oral lead in 
(OLI) was extended while the subject was investigated for alternative causes of transaminitis. During 
this time ALT and AST remained elevated and the subject was withdrawn from the study after 
receiving a total of 11 weeks of oral CAB+RPV. The subject commenced ABC/3TC/dolutegravir and 
the ALT/AST returned to normal after 12 weeks. 
The risk of hepatotoxicity will be further evaluated in the ongoing Phase III/IIIb clinical studies. 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
None identified, as reports have been received involving a limited number of subjects receiving CAB in 
clinical studies, with or without known pre-existing hepatic disease. 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Preventability: 
Labelling will facilitate appropriate patient selection by physicians. Liver chemistry monitoring as part of 
routine SOC in HIV patients will facilitate identification of patients with increasing transaminases and 
prompt further investigation for cause. 
The SmPC includes a statement in the warnings and precautions and adverse drug reaction sections that 
hepatotoxicity, presenting as serum transaminase elevations, has been reported in a limited number of 
subjects receiving CAB. There is also a recommendation to monitor patientsâ€™ liver chemistries and to 
discontinue treatment with CAB should hepatotoxicity be suspected. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
The number of cases of suspected drug induced liver injury is very low in the context of overall product 
exposure and no severe cases have been identified. The risk is considered manageable through routine 
liver chemistry monitoring and discontinuation of CAB treatment, where necessary. The risk is, 
therefore, acceptable given the expected benefits to patients of this novel regimen, the seriousness of HIV 
infection and the need for lifelong treatment. 
Public health impact: 
To  date  very  few  subjects  have  developed  DILI  across  the  CAB  clinical  development 
programme,  and  therefore  public  health  impact  is  expected  to  be  low.  Liver  chemistry 
monitoring is routine standard of care in for HIV patients. 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Important Potential Risk: Medication errors including treatment non-compliance  
MedDRA terms: Medication errors SMQ 
Potential mechanisms: 
Initially a two-drug injectable regimen will be novel to HCPs treating HIV patients; entailing a 
requirement for different initiation and continuation doses as well as an option to use oral lead- in. The 
dual regimen will be separately packaged and marketed, which could potentially be a risk for 
administering an incomplete regimen. The requirement for different injection volumes at initiation (3 
mL) and continuation (2 mL) for the Q4W schedule, and the differences in volume for the continuation 
dose for the Q8W schedule compared with the Q4W schedule as well as the requirement to administer 
both CAB+RPV at the same visit as separate injections could introduce potential risk for inadequate 
regimen compliance or dosing or administration errors. A switch to a fully suppressive ARV regimen 
should also take place if discontinuation of CAB+RPV were to occur, to minimise the risk of viral 
resistance. If the drug or drugs are not administered correctly, the individual components of the 
regimen are not administered at the same time, as required, or the subject does not receive their repeat 
injections within the specified window for dosing, this could negatively impact therapeutic levels of the 
treatment leading to potential treatment failure and/or resistance development. Additionally, patient 
non- adherence to the injection visit schedule, errors with preparation of the injection, dispensing errors 
or storage errors could also negatively impact the effectiveness of CAB+RPV. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
In clinical studies, medication errors were uncommon; those that occurred had minimal clinical impact 
on subjects. There is potential for detection of some, but not all administration or dosing errors from the 
clinical studies and would likewise be the same in clinical practice as it is difficult to readily determine 
if an incorrect injectable dose has been administered. Overall, the potential risk to subjects due to 
medication errors is considered to be low, as the efficacy of the CAB+RPV LA regimen has not been 
affected in most cases observed in the clinical studies to date. 
Human factor studies were conducted using commercially representative medicinal product kits 
including representative drug product vials, to-be-marketed delivery devices and packaging, and to-be-
marketed labelling including instructions for use for the initiation and continuation doses of the 
combination drug regimen (CAB+RPV LA) under simulated use conditions with the objective to 
provide evidence that the user requirements have been adequately met. The conclusions from the 
human factor studies were used to create and refine the instructions for use. 
The risk of non-compliance and treatment discontinuation without prompt introduction of an appropriate 
new regimen is theoretical and could not be assessed in clinical trials. 
Characterisation of the risk: 
During the Maintenance Phase, up to week 48 of the Phase III pivotal studies FLAIR (201584) and 
ATLAS (201585) 14682 injections were administered (Data Source: ISS/ISE Table 3.110). 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Medication errors not associated with device malfunction were formally reported and were infrequent 
occurrences during these studies. These errors were reported to have occurred in 15 subjects, 
sometimes involving more than one drug, and sometimes involving more than one subject at the same 
investigative site. For most subjects (n=14), these involved receiving the wrong dose and in one subject 
this involved receiving the right dose and drug but from the wrong study (Data Source: Study 201584 
CSR Listing 66, Study 201585 CSR Listing 2). Of the 14 subjects receiving the wrong dose, eight 
involved an under dose and six an overdose. In 11 subjects these errors occurred during the first 12 
weeks of commencing CAB+RPV LA indicating an initial lack of familiarity with use of the product. 
In the FLAIR (201584) study, from Week 48 to Week 96, 2 subjects had syringe device malfunctions; 
these incidents included luer lock failure, leakage from syringe during dosing, and suspension did not 
move from needle . None of the device malfunctions resulted in maladministration of study drug. 
Four subjects had various dosing errors: administered dose  1 mL of study drug and administered 
study drug from wrong study. Dosing errors and device malfunctions occurred in the randomized 
CAB + RPV group only. 
Only 1 incident of device malfunction occurred during extension Phase from Week 96 to Week 124 
analysis; this incident was during a CAB injection, the site staff administered 1 mL and met resistance 
so they stopped and changed needles and then administered the remaining 1 mL without any issues. The 
subject received the correct treatment and there were no maladministration issues.. 
During the ATLAS 2M trial, 1 subject was underdosed (received 2 mL instead of 3 mL) with both 
CAB+RPV LA . No adverse events were directly attributable to these errors. No evidence of lack of 
efficacy has been detected as determined by absence of suspected or confirmed virological failure 
following the occurrence of an error. 
There have been no reports of attempts to combine CAB and RPV into a single syringe. 
In a controlled clinical trial setting the risk of non-compliance and treatment discontinuation without 
prompt introduction of an appropriate new regimen could not be characterised. Data on the risks from 
â€˜real worldâ€™ use will be gathered via routine pharmacovigilance. The marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) will also conduct a drug utilization study (DUS) and a post authorisation efficacy study (PAES), 
COMBINE 2 study to characterise the risk. 
The first study, Drug Utilization, Adherence, Effectiveness and Resistance: A Prospective 
Observational Cohort Study in Patients initiating an ARV regimen of CAB+RPV LA in collaboration 
with EuroSIDA (DUS) , will aim to better understand the patient population receiving CAB LA and/or 
RPV LA containing regimens in routine clinical practice, usage patterns, adherence, post marketing 
clinical effectiveness of this regimen and monitor for resistance among virologic failures for whom data 
on resistance testing are available. All patients who discontinue the regimen for any reason, will be 
followed for 24 months after discontinuation. During this 24-month follow up period, the study will 
collect data on the ARV regimen in the patients who switches to subsequent to CAB+RPV LA 
discontinuation, patient virological outcomes and data on resistance, where tested for and as available. 
However, the data on resistance testing collected by EuroSIDA may not be comprehensive and 
resistance testing cannot be mandated across the sites participating in EuroSIDA cohort within the 
current framework of data collection. Due to this limitation in the EuroSIDA cohortâ€™s ability to provide 
comprehensive data on HIV subtype and resistance, an additional study will be conducted. Assessment 
of effectiveness of the routine risk minimisation measures for treatment compliance, such as the 
compliance with the SmPC recommendations on adherence to the dosing schedule and how to handle 
treatment discontinuations, will be reported in the PBRER/PSUR. Data will be analysed from the DUS 
interim and final reports, and cases received via routine pharmacovigilance. 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 
The second study, COMBINE-2 for CAB+RPV LA Regimen: A Prospective Cohort Study to Monitor 
Adherence, Effectiveness and Resistance, will be in collaboration with the NEAT ID network. The 
study will also monitor for clinical effectiveness, discontinuations and resistance among patients on the 
CAB+RPV LA regimen. This study will aim to include at least 1000 patients across Europe, and will 
have mandatory testing for resistance and HIV subtype following virological failure if not already 
available and monitor for virologic outcomes for 24 months following initiation of the regimen. All 
patients who discontinue the regimen for any reason, will be followed for 24 months after 
discontinuation. The study will test for resistance and will monitor for emergence of resistance among 
those who discontinue CAB+RPV LA regimen and have viral failure while on subsequent ARV 
regimen. 
Together the DUS and COMBINE-2, will provide a large enough study population for a long term 
assessment of the regimen usage, adherence, clinical effectiveness, discontinuations and emergence of 
resistance. (See Table 10 and Table 11). 
Inadvertent partial intravenous administration with adverse outcomes is known to have occurred 
during the CAB + RPV development programme through the cut-off dates for this submission. There 
were also other potential cases without adverse outcomes which were detected by reviewing subjectâ€™s 
pharmacokinetic data. A higher than expected peak exposure could occur if an injection were 
accidentally administered into a vein in the early phases followed by a decline in drug levels in later 
phases. 
Over 48,000 CAB injections have been administered in the clinical program (Studies FLAIR 
(201584), ATLAS (201585), LATTE-2 (200056) and ATLAS 2-M (207966)) and no other 
adverse outcomes are known to have occurred with CAB LA as a result of partial intravenous 
administration or due to increased exposure in these studies. Symptoms such as feeling lightheaded, 
numbness or tingling, hard to breathe, chest discomfort, sweating, nausea and/or feeling anxious have 
occurred after an injection with RPV LA. In these cases, high RPV pharmacokinetic levels have been 
observed, which may indicate that a partial intravenous injection occurred. Not all patients in whom an 
accidental intravenous injection was suspected reported such symptoms. The majority of the symptoms 
resolved within minutes. 
Overall, no discernible trends or systematic errors were identified with administration of CAB LA, 
apart from initial lack of familiarity. There have been rare instances of partial intravenous 
administration of RPV LA which have resulted in adverse reactions. It is likely that the observed 
errors represent the experience in a group of HCPs that initially lacked familiarity with the product and 
injection administration technique. To assess this potential risk associated with medication errors and 
treatment non-compliance, data from the post-marketing setting will be collected and evaluated via 
routine pharmacovigilance, as evidence from the controlled clinical study programme is limited. 
Additional data will be collected and evaluated by the proposed DUS and COMBINE-2 studies 
regarding the consequences of medication errors and treatment non-compliance impacting clinical 
effectiveness, development of resistance and other adverse outcomes. 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
The CAB+RPV regimen will initially be novel to HCPs. The treatment has two or three stages for 
dosing, depending on whether dosing with an optional OLI is used, or direct initiation of injection 
dose(s), followed by different continuation injection doses corresponding to the Q4W and Q8W 
regimens, intramuscular initiation dose, and intramuscular continuation dose, with both CAB and RPV 
being administered as separate injections. There is a risk of administering an incomplete regimen, 
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 
potentially resulting in sub-optimal therapeutic levels. Inadvertent partial intravenous administration 
resulting in a higher than expected peak exposure initially could occur if an injection were accidentally 
administered into a vein in the early phases followed by a decline in drug levels in later phases also 
resulting in sub-optimal therapeutic levels. Treatment with CAB+RPV LA should not be initiated in 
patients who are not suitably suppressed, or those who may not be adherent to the regimen as this 
could potentially result in sub-optimal therapeutic levels. 
Preventability: 
The proposed label is clear concerning the requirement for the combined use and delivery of both CAB 
and RPV. The packaging for the different CAB and RPV dosing stages will be colour coded to help 
ensure the correct dosage is given at each visit. The primary colour of the 3 mL CAB dose is orange, 
and the primary colour of the 2 mL CAB dose is dark grey. The single entity packs will facilitate each 
injection by providing devices (needle, syringe, vial adapter) for correct administration procedure. 
Detailed instructions for use will be co-packaged with CAB and RPV, informed by user risk 
assessment, which identified critical steps in the dispensing, preparation, and administration of the 
regimen. The ability to complete the critical steps according to the instructions for use without errors 
was evaluated through extensive human factors studies. The instructions for use has been developed 
through an iterative process with the goal of reducing errors. The outer packaging for CAB+RPV 
injection has been developed to differentiate between initiation and continuation doses. 
Treating physicians will be advised to select patients who are committed and able to adhere to the 
required injection dosing schedule, and have been counselled about the importance of adherence to 
scheduled dosing visits, and the risks of treatment discontinuation without adopting an alternative fully 
suppressive regimen. 
In addition, HIV-infected patients transitioning onto the CAB+RPV regimen will be treatment 
experienced and already suppressed instead of treatment naÃ¯ve, and therefore are more likely to 
understand the importance of adherence for any HIV regimen to be effective. In many countries, regimen 
implementation tools, such as appointment reminder systems and protocols used by hospitals and clinics, 
are part of standard healthcare practices. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
The frequency of inadequate compliance with the complete drug regimen/maladministration is 
anticipated to be low in the treatment population and should decrease over time as HCPs become more 
familiar with the treatment. The HCP will also select patients who agree to the required injection 
dosing schedule and have been counselled about the importance of adherence to scheduled dosing 
visits, to decrease the chance of treatment non-compliance occurring. Therefore, the risk-benefit 
balance remains positive given the benefits of improved adherence and reduction in pill burden for 
patients afforded by this regimen. 
Public health impact: 
There is low anticipated public health impact, however if there is non-compliance there may be a risk of 
resistance to either or both components of the regimen developing, which could limit treatment options 
for individuals.

SVII.3.2  Presentation of missing information  
Use in Pregnancy  
Clinical experience of the use of CAB during pregnancy is limited.  
No studies have been conducted with CAB in pregnant women during the clinical development 
programme and pregnant and breastfeeding women were excluded from these clinical studies. Females of 
reproductive potential (FRP) are required to use effective contraception methods whilst receiving CAB in 
clinical studies and throughout long term follow up phases of studies after exposure to CAB LA. 
Subjects receiving CAB in ViiV Healthcare sponsored clinical studies who became pregnant 
(intrauterine) were initially required to discontinue CAB, however, there is no longer such a requirement 
based on reproductive toxicity studies in animals and the clinical and post-marketing data available to 
date. Women who are confirmed to be pregnant whilst participating in ViiV Healthcare sponsored CAB 
studies are now given the option to either continue in the study and continue receiving CAB and RPV, 
following a benefit/risk discussion with the investigator and providing revised informed consent, or they 
can choose to discontinue CAB and withdraw. Management of pregnancies are per protocol and all 
pregnancies will be followed up to outcome. Due to the long acting nature of the CAB injection exposure 
could occur at the time of conception and throughout the duration of the pregnancy even if injections 
were stopped as soon as pregnancy was identified. 
During the CAB+RPV development program at the data lock point of the submissions for the MAA, 
out of twelve pregnancies exposed to CAB (four oral only and eight long acting), there was one live 
birth of a healthy infant and two ongoing pregnancy at the time of database lock.  
There were three spontaneous abortions and one medical termination for anembryonic 
pregnancy. The remaining five pregnancies were electively terminated for non-medical 
reasons. 
Population in need of further characterisation:  
As clinical experience of the use of CAB as an injectable regimen during pregnancy is not available, it 
is not possible to define the risk in this patient population. Further information is required to understand 
the safety profile (i.e. maternal and foetal outcomes) in pregnant women taking CAB. 
Further studies are ongoing to collect additional information on the use of CAB during pregnancy 
(see APR and EPPICC, Table 10 or further information).

PART III: PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN (INCLUDING POST 
AUTHORISATION SAFETY STUDIES)  
III.1  Routine pharmacovigilance activities  
Routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal detection:  
Specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaires: None proposed. 
Other forms of routine pharmacovigilance activities: None proposed. 
No routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reaction reporting and signal detection activities 
are required. 
III.2  Additional pharmacovigilance activities  
The pharmacovigilance plan for CAB and CAB-containing products is to implement a post- marketing 
safety study (PASS) to further quantify the risk of hepatotoxicity and to possibly determine associated 
risk factors. In addition, the PASS will monitor for CAB discontinuation rates due to adverse events. A 
DUS will also be conducted to better understand the patient population receiving CAB+RPV LA 
injectable regimen in routine clinical practice, usage patterns, adherence and post marketing clinical 
effectiveness of this regimen. 
Study short name and title: A prospective observational cohort study to monitor for hepatotoxicity 
and regimen discontinuation due to liver related adverse events among patients initiating 
cabotegravir containing antiretroviral regimen.   
Rationale and study objectives: 
Uncommon cases of DILI with oral CAB were observed during the clinical trials program for CAB and 
RPV. During Phase III studies although hepatotoxicity was observed at higher rates with CAB LA 
compared to the oral comparator ART therapy, the difference was largely driven by acute viral hepatitis 
which occurred more frequently in subjects receiving CAB LA. Hepatotoxicity has been reported in a 
limited number of patients receiving CAB with or without known pre-existing hepatic disease. 
Healthcare professional should monitor liver chemistries and discontinue treatment with CAB if 
hepatotoxicity is suspected. 
The MAH proposes a five-year post authorization safety study (PASS) to be conducted in a real-world 
context. This prospective observational cohort study will monitor for hepatotoxicity and 
discontinuation of the regimen due to liver- related adverse events following initiation of CAB based 
ARV regimen. 
This safety study will be conducted through collaboration with EuroSIDA, a well-established, 
prospective observational cohort study of more than 22,000 patients followed in over 100 hospitals in 31 
European countries, Israel and Argentina. A detailed study protocol, once approved, will be implemented 
by the EuroSIDA coordinating centre.

CONFIDENTIAL 
Following the initiation of any ARV regimen containing CAB LA among HIV infected 
patients, the study will aim to: 
1.  Characterise the rates and risks of hepatotoxicity by: 
ï‚· 
ï‚· 
estimating the incidence of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations and risk factors 
for elevations 
estimating the incidence of cases of combined ALT and total bilirubin elevations and 
risk factors for elevations 
2.  Estimate the number of patients discontinuing CAB based ARV regimen due to any 
reason and specifically discontinuations due to liver related adverse events 
Study design: 
A prospective cohort study nested within the EuroSIDA study, using electronic patient medical 
information from participating clinical sites will be conducted over a period of five years to meet the 
study objectives. In addition to ALT and total bilirubin, the study will also assess other liver chemistry 
tests (LCTs) including changes to aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and 
Albumin levels. 
For this non-interventional study, treatment and laboratory testing decisions will be made by the 
treating physician according to standard practice, taking into account the treatment history, patient 
characteristics, the approved SmPC for CAB oral and LA formulations, contemporary regimen and 
local guideline or recommendations. 
Study population: 
The study population will include HIV positive patients over the age of 18 years, who are new users of 
CAB based ARV regimens. 
Milestones: 
A study-specific protocol was developed and submitted by 31 December 2020 for the EMAâ€™s review 
and endorsement. The study started once the protocol was approved by the EMA, and CAB LA was 
registered and commercially available in the relevant countries and will continue through to at least 
2025 or later, for a total of five years of monitoring. Annual reports (interim) with cumulative data 
will be submitted and a final report will be submitted 12 months after the study completion, by March 
2027.

Study short name and title: Drug Utilization, Adherence, Effectiveness and Resistance: A 
Prospective Observational Cohort Study in Patients initiating an ARV regimen of 
CAB+RPV LA in Collaboration with EuroSIDA   
Rationale and study objectives: 
ViiV Healthcare proposes a five-year DUS to be conducted in a real-world context. This prospective 
observational cohort study will aim to better understand the patient population receiving CAB LA 
and/or RPV LA containing regimens in routine clinical practice, usage patterns, adherence, and post 
marketing clinical effectiveness of these regimens and monitor for resistance among virologic failures 
for whom data on resistance testing are available. All patients who discontinue the regimen for any 
reason, will be followed for 24 months after discontinuation. During this 24-month follow up period, 
the study will collect data on the ARV regimen in the patients who switches to subsequent to 
CAB+RPV LA discontinuation, patient virological outcomes and data on resistance, where tested for 
and as available. 
The proposed study will be conducted through collaboration with EuroSIDA, a well- established, 
prospective observational cohort study of more than 22,000 patients followed in over 100 hospitals in 
31 European countries, Israel and Argentina. A detailed study protocol, once approved, will be 
implemented by the EuroSIDA coordinating centre. 
The study will evaluate the effectiveness of routine risk minimization measures for the safety concern 
of medication errors and assess the use of CAB LA and/or RPV LA containing injection regimens 
according to the SmPC recommendations by addressing the specific study objectives as outlined below. 
Following the initiation of any ARV regimen containing CAB LA and/or RPV LA among HIV infected 
patients, the study will aim to assess usage patterns, durability, discontinuation, and virological 
outcomes among persons first exposure to CAB LA and /or RPV LA containing regimens. The specific 
aims are to: 
1.  Describe CAB LA and/or RPV LA containing regimens usage patterns 
ï‚·  Descriptive analysis of patient population by baseline demographic and clinical characteristics 
ï‚·  Monitor for use of oral lead-in 
ï‚·  Comparison of treatment groups* 
a.  CAB LA monotherapy 
b.  CAB LA use in combination with ARVs other than RPV LA 
c.  RPV LA monotherapy 
d.  RPV LA use in combination with ARVs other than CAB LA 
e.  CAB+RPV LA containing regimens used in combination 
* Note that depending on numbers within these 5 treatment groups, groups may be combined.

CONFIDENTIAL 
2.  Assess adherence, durability and discontinuation for persons starting one of the regimens a-e 
above; 
ï‚·  Proportion of patients discontinuing the regimens of interest and lost to follow-up will be 
assessed. 
ï‚·  Reasons for discontinuation will be assessed. 
ï‚·  Non-adherence to dosing schedule will be assessed by 
a.  Estimating the number of patients that missed one or more consecutive injections without 
taking daily oral bridging therapy or any other oral ARV regimen while not on CAB LA 
and/or RPV LA containing regimens and average number of injections missed during a 12-
month period 
b.  Estimating the number of patients who received the injections seven or more days later 
than their scheduled injection visit and average duration of delayed injections 
3.  Assess the clinical effectiveness (i.e. proportion of patients experiencing virologic failure) 
among HIV patients who initiate CAB+RPV LA regimen and had suppressed viral load at 
regimen initiation (VL <50 copies/mL without present or past evidence of viral resistance to, 
and no prior virological failure with agents of the NNRTI and INI class) 
ï‚·  Estimate the proportion of patients with virologic failure, during the first 6 months after 
initiation of CAB+RPV LA 
ï‚·  Estimate the proportion of patients with virologic failure, 6, 12 and 24 months after initiation 
of CAB+RPV LA 
4.  Monitor for resistance and next treatment response among individuals who switched off CAB 
LA and/or RPV LA containing regimens a-e, where viral load data are available and resistance 
testing has been done as part of routine clinical practice 
ï‚·  Describe the ARV regimen patients are switched to after discontinuation of CAB LA and/or 
RPV LA containing regimens 
ï‚·  Monitor for resistance during the 24 months following the switch 
ï‚·  Describe virologic outcomes at 24 months after discontinuation of CAB LA and/or RPV LA 
containing regimens 
Study design: 
A prospective cohort study nested within the EuroSIDA study, using electronic patient medical 
information from participating clinical sites will be conducted over a period of five years to meet the 
study objectives. 
For this non-interventional study, treatment decisions and resistance testing decisions will be made by 
the treating physician according to standard practice, taking into account the treatment history, patient 
characteristics, the approved SmPCs for CAB and RPV oral and LA formulations and for the 
contemporary regimen and local guidelines or recommendations. All

CONFIDENTIAL 
patients who discontinue the regimen for any reason, will be followed for 24 months after 
discontinuation. 
Study population: 
The study population will include HIV infected patients over the age of 18 years, from EuroSIDA 
clinical sites who are new users of CAB LA and/or RPV LA containing regimens over a period of 5 
years. Persons will be eligible for inclusion from the date of starting the treatment regimens after 
approval and commercial availability of the regimens. Only the first exposure to CAB LA and/or RPV 
LA containing regimens will be included in analyses. 
Milestones: 
A study-specific protocol was developed and submitted by 31 December 2020 for EMAâ€™s review and 
endorsement. The study started once the protocol was approved by the EMA, and CAB+RPV LA was 
registered and commercially available in the relevant countries and will continue through to at least 
2025 or later, for a total of five years of monitoring. Annual (interim) reports with cumulative data will 
be submitted and a final report will be submitted 12 months after the study completion, by September 
2026. Please note study considerations above for lag in data from uptake in clinic to availability of data 
in EuroSIDA. 
CAB in Pregnancy studies:  
Due to the long acting nature of the CAB injection, exposure could occur at the time of conception and 
throughout the duration of the pregnancy even if injections were stopped as soon as pregnancy was 
identified. Cabotegravir reproductive and developmental toxicity studies did not demonstrate any effects 
on fertility or fecundity. There is no anticipated risk in humans based on the non-clinical study findings. 
No studies have been conducted with CAB in pregnant women. Pregnant and breastfeeding women were 
excluded from the CAB clinical studies. Women of childbearing potential were required to use highly 
effective measures to avoid pregnancy. Subjects that became pregnant were required to discontinue the 
study medication and discontinue the study, regardless of termination status of pregnancy. Clinical 
experience of CAB use during pregnancy is therefore limited. Thus, the safety of CAB during human 
pregnancy has not been established. The proposed SmPC states that CAB is not recommended during 
pregnancy unless the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus and additionally 
prescribers are reminded of long acting exposure following injection. 
In addition to routine pharmacovigilance to monitor pregnancies occurring with exposure to CAB, 
ViiV Healthcare has proposed two studies for post marketing data generation to assess the safety and 
effectiveness of CAB in pregnancy using data from The European Pregnancy and Paediatric 
Infections Cohort Collaboration (EPPICC) and The Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR). 
61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Study short name and title: European Pregnancy and Paediatric HIV Cohort Collaboration 
(EPPICC)  
Rationale and study objectives: 
Data from the EPPICC will assess maternal outcomes (pregnancy outcomes, abortions, still births and 
maternal viral load) and foetal outcomes (still births) following CAB use during pregnancy. The 
exposure to CAB relative to all gestation period including conception will be captured in this study, 
thus enabling assessment of pre-conception exposures along with first, second and third trimester 
exposures. 
Study design: 
This is a non-interventional study involving analysis of prospectively collected i.e. exposure data 
collected before the pregnancy outcome is known. 
Study population: 
EPPICC is an international network of cohort and surveillance studies set up in 2010 and coordinated 
by Penta Child Health (www.penta-id.org). The collaboration conducts epidemiological research on 
pregnant women living with HIV and their children (infected and HIV-exposed uninfected), with a 
focus on scientific and clinical management-related questions requiring a large sample size of patients 
which the contributing studies cannot answer individually. The safety and effectiveness of CAB in 
pregnancy will be assessed in real world, using observational data collected in cohort and surveillance 
studies of pregnant women living with HIV and their infants from European countries within EPPICC. 
Participating sites/cohorts in EPPICC will provide coded, anonymised data on pregnant women using 
CAB-containing ARV, as per detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) for data reporting, including 
a data specification guidance based on a modified HIV Cohorts Data Exchange Protocol (HICDEP) 
(www.hicdep.org). Following merger of these individual cohort/study datasets, analyses will be 
conducted on the pooled dataset to address the study objectives. 
Milestones: 
A study-specific protocol  was  developed and submitted by 31 December 2020 for the EMAâ€™s review 
and endorsement. The study started once the protocol was approved by the EMA. Four analyses have 
been planned: the first interim report was planned for submission when the number of pregnant women 
exposed to CAB-containing regimen in the cohorts reaches 25, followed by two more interim reports 
when the study population reaches 100 and 200 pregnancies. A final report will be completed 12 
months after the third interim report.

CONFIDENTIAL 
Study short name and title: Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR)  
Rationale and study objectives: 
The APR is an international registry that monitors prenatal exposures to antiretroviral drugs to detect a 
potential increase in the risk of birth defects through a prospective exposure- registration cohort. The 
APR is a ViiV Healthcare-sponsored study involving the collaborative effort of multiple companies. 
Data from the APR will assess maternal (pregnancy outcomes, abortions, still births and maternal viral 
load) and foetal outcomes (still births) following CAB use during pregnancy. Exposure to CAB relative 
to all gestation period and conception will be captured in the registry, thus enabling assessment of pre-
conception exposures along with first, second and third trimester exposures. 
Study design: 
This is a non-interventional study involving analysis of prospectively collected i.e. exposure data 
collected before the pregnancy outcome is known. 
Study population: 
The APR is a voluntary, international, prospective exposure registration cohort that was established in 
1989 to monitor and detect any teratogenic effects of ARV drugs used in pregnancy. Annually, the 
Registry enrols approximately 1300-1700 pregnant women exposed to ARV drugs for the treatment of 
HIV and HBV infection and prevention of HIV infection. This number includes approximately 1300 or 
15% of the 8,700 HIV infected women who give birth to live infants annually in the US and 
approximately 350 pregnant women from other countries. 
Clinicians register pregnant women with prenatal exposures to any ARV before the outcome of 
pregnancy is known, report data on exposure throughout pregnancy, and provide birth outcome data. 
Registration is voluntary and confidential. Defects are reviewed by a teratologist, and all data are 
reviewed semi-annually by an independent Advisory Committee. Exposure to ARVs is classified and 
analysed by the earliest trimester of exposure to each individual ARV medication. 
Birth defect prevalence (any pregnancy outcome > 20 weeks of gestation with a defect/live births) is 
compared to both internal and external comparator groups. The external comparators used are two 
population-based surveillance systems â€“ Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) by 
the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Texas Birth Defects Registry (TBDR). 
Internal comparators include exposures to other drugs and exposures in the second or third trimester of 
pregnancy relative to 1st trimester exposures when organogenesis occurs. 
Milestones: 
A study-specific protocol was developed and submitted by 31 December 2020 for the EMAâ€™s review 
and endorsement. The study started once the protocol was approved by the EMA. ViiV Healthcare, has 
proposed to conduct in depth interim analyses of non-defect data per schedule shown in the Table 10, in 
Section III.3. The first interim report will be authored and submitted when the number of pregnant 
women exposed to a CAB-containing regimen in the registry reaches 25, followed by two more interim 
reports when the study population reaches 100 and 200 pregnancies. A final report will be completed 12 
months after the third report.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN  
Summary of risk management plan for Vocabria 30 mg film-coated tablets 
(cabotegravir)  
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Vocabria 30 mg film-coated tablets. The 
RMP details important risks of Vocabria 30 mg film-coated tablets, how these risks can be minimised, 
and how more information will be obtained about Vocabria 30 mg film-coated tablets risks and 
uncertainties (missing information). 
Vocabria 30 mg film-coated tabletsâ€™ summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package 
leaflet give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Vocabria 30 mg 
film-coated tablets should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Vocabria 30 mg film-coated tablets should be read in the context of all 
this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain- language summary, 
all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Vocabria 30 mg 
film-coated tabletsâ€™ RMP. 
I.  The medicine and what it is used for  
Vocabria 30 mg film-coated tablets are authorised in combination with rilpivirine tablets for the short-
term treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults who are 
virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen without 
present or past evidence of viral resistance to, and no prior virological failure with agents of the 
NNRTI and INI class for: 
ï‚· 
ï‚· 
oral lead-in to assess tolerability of Vocabria and rilpivirine prior to administration of long acting 
Vocabria injection plus long acting rilpivirine injection. 
oral therapy for adults who will miss planned dosing with Vocabria injection plus 
rilpivirine injection. 
See SmPC for the full indication. It contains cabotegravir as the active substance and it is given by the 
oral route. 
Further information about the evaluation of Vocabria 30 mg film-coated tabletsâ€™ benefits can be 
found in Vocabria 30 mg film-coated tabletsâ€™ EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, 
available on the EMA website, under the medicineâ€™s webpage:

II.  Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Vocabria 30 mg film-coated tablets, together with measures to minimise such 
risks and the proposed studies for learning more about Vocabria 30 mg film-coated tabletsâ€™ risks, 
are outlined below. 
71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
ï‚·  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
ï‚· 
Important advice on the medicineâ€™s packaging; 
ï‚·  The authorised pack size â€” the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
ï‚·  The medicineâ€™s legal status â€” the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Vocabria 30 mg film-coated tablets is not yet 
available, it is listed under â€˜missing informationâ€™ below. 
II.A  List of important risks and missing information  
Important risks of Vocabria 30 mg film-coated tablets are risks that need special risk management 
activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there 
is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Vocabria 30 mg film- coated tablets. Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected 
(e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks  
Important identified risk: Hepatotoxicity 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Clinical trials have shown that transient elevations of liver enzymes 
(transaminitis) can potentially occur with a CAB-containing regimen 
for a variety of reasons; these events are uncommon. Clinical study 
data from the development programme with CAB provide the 
evidence for this risk. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
None identified, as reports have been received involving a limited 
number of subjects receiving cabotegravir in clinical studies, with or 
without known pre-existing hepatic disease

Important potential risk: Medication errors including treatment non-compliance 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
In clinical studies, medication errors were uncommon; those that occurred 
had minimal clinical impact on subjects. There is potential for detection of 
some, but not all administration or dosing errors from the clinical studies and 
would likewise be the same in clinical practice as it is difficult to readily 
determine if an incorrect injectable dose has been administered. Overall, the 
potential risk to subjects due to medication errors is considered to be low, 
as the efficacy of the CAB+RPV regimen has not been affected in most 
cases observed in the clinical studies to date. 
Human factor studies were conducted using commercially representative 
medicinal product kits including representative drug product vials, to-be-
marketed delivery devices and packaging, and to-be-marketed labelling 
including instructions for use for the initiation and continuation doses of 
the combination drug regimen (CAB+RPV) under simulated use conditions 
with the objective to provide evidence that the user requirements have 
been adequately met. The conclusions from the human factor studies 
were used to create and refine the instructions for use. 
The risk of non-compliance and treatment discontinuation without prompt 
introduction of an appropriate new regimen is theoretical and could not be 
assessed in clinical trials. 
The CAB+RPV regimen will initially be novel to Healthcare Professionals. 
The treatment has either two or three stages for dosing, if an optional oral 
lead-in dosing is used, or direct initiation of injection dose(s), followed by 
different continuation injection doses corresponding to the Q4W and Q8W 
regimens, intramuscular initiation dose, and intramuscular continuation 
dose, with both CAB and RPV being administered as separate injections. 
There is a risk of administering an incomplete regimen, potentially resulting 
in sub- optimal therapeutic levels. Inadvertent partial intravenous 
administration resulting in a higher than expected peak exposure initially 
could occur if an injection were accidentally administered into a vein in the 
early phases followed by a decline in drug levels in later phases also 
resulting in sub-optimal therapeutic levels. Treatment with CAB+RPV LA 
should not be initiated in patients who are not suitably suppressed, or those 
who may not be adherent to the regimen as this could potentially result in 
sub-optimal therapeutic levels.

Study short name: Drug Utilization, Adherence, Effectiveness and Resistance: A 
Prospective Observational Cohort Study in Patients initiating an ARV regimen of 
CAB+RPV LA in Collaboration with EuroSIDA   
Purpose of the study: ViiV Healthcare proposes a five-year DUS to be conducted in a real-world 
context. This prospective observational cohort study will aim to better understand the patient 
population receiving CAB LA and/or RPV LA containing regimens in routine clinical practice, usage 
patterns, adherence, and post marketing clinical effectiveness of these regimens and monitor for 
resistance among virologic failures for whom data on resistance testing are available. All patients who 
discontinue the regimen for any reason, will be followed for 24 months after discontinuation. During 
this 24-month follow up period, the study will collect data on the ARV regimen in the patients who 
switches to subsequent to CAB+RPV LA discontinuation, patient virological outcomes and data on 
resistance, where tested for and as available 
The proposed study will be conducted through collaboration with EuroSIDA, a well- established, 
prospective observational cohort study of more than 22,000 patients followed in over 100 hospitals 
in 31 European countries, Israel and Argentina. A detailed study protocol, once approved, will be 
implemented by the EuroSIDA coordinating centre. 
The study will evaluate the effectiveness of routine risk minimization measures for the safety concern 
of medication errors and assess the use of CAB LA and/or RPV LA containing injection regimens 
according to the SmPC recommendations by addressing the specific study objectives as outlined below. 
Following the initiation of any ARV regimen containing CAB LA and/or RPV LA among HIV infected 
patients, the study will aim to assess usage patterns, durability, discontinuation, and virological 
outcomes among persons first exposure to CAB LA and /or RPV LA containing regimens. The specific 
aims are to: 
1.  Describe CAB LA and/or RPV LA containing regimens usage patterns 
ï‚·  Descriptive analysis of patient population by baseline demographic and clinical 
characteristics 
ï‚·  Monitor for use of oral lead-in 
ï‚·  Comparison of treatment groups* 
a.  CAB LA monotherapy 
b.  CAB LA use in combination with ARVs other than RPV LA 
c.  RPV LA monotherapy 
d.  RPV LA use in combination with ARVs other than CAB LA 
e.  CAB+RPV LA containing regimens used in combination 
* Note that depending on numbers within these 5 treatment groups, groups may be combined.

2.  Assess adherence, durability and discontinuation for persons starting one of the regimens a-e 
above; 
ï‚·  Proportion of patients discontinuing the regimens of interest and lost to follow-up will be 
assessed. 
ï‚·  Reasons for discontinuation will be assessed. 
ï‚·  Non-adherence to dosing schedule will be assessed by 
a.  Estimating the number of patients that missed one or more consecutive injections 
without taking daily oral bridging therapy or any other oral ARV regimen while not on 
CAB LA and/or RPV LA containing regimens and average number of injections missed 
during a 12-month period 
b.  Estimating the number of patients who received the injections seven or more days later 
than their scheduled injection visit and average duration of delayed injections 
3.  Assess the clinical effectiveness (i.e. proportion of patients experiencing virologic failure) among 
HIV  patients  who  initiate  CAB+RPV  LA  regimen  and  had  suppressed  viral  load at  regimen 
initiation (VL <50 copies/mL without present or past evidence of viral resistance to, and no prior 
virological failure with agents of the NNRTI and INI class ) 
ï‚·  Estimate the proportion of patients with virologic failure, during the first 6 months after initiation 
of CAB+RPV LA 
ï‚·  Estimate the proportion of patients with virologic failure, 6, 12 and 24 months after 
initiation of CAB+RPV LA 
4.  Monitor for resistance and next treatment response among individuals who switched off CAB LA 
and/or RPV LA containing regimens a-e, where viral load data are available and resistance testing 
has been done as part of routine clinical practice 
ï‚·  Describe the ARV regimen patients are switched to after discontinuation of CAB LA and/or 
RPV LA containing regimens 
ï‚·  Monitor for resistance during the 24 months following the switch 
ï‚·  Describe virologic outcomes at 24 months after discontinuation of CAB LA and/or RPV 
LA containing regimens 
Study short name: COMBINE-2 for Cabotegravir + Rilpivirine LA Regimen: A 
Prospective Cohort Study to Monitor Effectiveness, Adherence and Resistance   
Purpose of the study: The study will aim to gather data from 1000 patients to assess clinical 
effectiveness, adherence, durability and discontinuations after initiating CAB+RPV LA regimen. The 
study will also monitor for resistance and response to subsequent ARV regimen among patients who 
switched off CAB+RPV LA regimen. 
The study population will include HIV positive patients over the age of 18 years, from NEAT ID 
Network clinical sites who are prescribed CAB+RPV LA regimen. As per label, adults who are 
virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen

II.C.2  Other studies in post-authorisation development plan  
Study short name: A prospective observational cohort study to monitor for 
hepatotoxicity and regimen discontinuation due to liver related adverse events 
among patients initiating cabotegravir containing antiretroviral regimen.   
Purpose of the study: Uncommon cases of DILI with oral CAB were observed during the clinical trials 
program for CAB and RPV. During Phase III studies although hepatotoxicity was observed at higher 
rates with CAB LA compared to the oral comparator ART therapy, the difference was largely driven by 
acute viral hepatitis which occurred more frequently in subjects receiving CAB LA. Hepatotoxicity has 
been reported in a limited number of patients receiving CAB with or without known pre-existing 
hepatic disease. Healthcare professional should monitor liver chemistries and discontinue treatment 
with CAB if hepatotoxicity is suspected. 
ViiV Healthcare proposes a five-year post authorization safety study (PASS) to be conducted in a real-
world context. This prospective observational cohort study will monitor for hepatotoxicity and 
discontinuation of the regimen due to liver- related adverse events following initiation of CAB based 
ARV regimen. 
This safety study will be conducted through collaboration with EuroSIDA, a well-established, 
prospective observational cohort study of more than 22,000 patients followed in over 100 hospitals in 31 
European countries, Israel and Argentina. A detailed study protocol, once approved, will be implemented 
by the EuroSIDA coordinating centre. 
Following the initiation of any ARV regimen containing CAB LA among HIV infected patients, 
the study will aim to: 
1. 
characterise the rates and risks of hepatotoxicity by: 
ï‚·  estimating the incidence of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations and risk factors for 
elevations 
ï‚·  estimating the incidence of cases of combined ALT and total bilirubin elevations and risk 
factors for elevations 
2.  Estimate the number of patients discontinuing CAB based ARV regimen due to any reason and 
specifically discontinuations due to liver related adverse events 
Study short name: European Pregnancy and Paediatric HIV Cohort Collaboration 
(EPPICC)   
Purpose of the study: Data from the EPPICC will assess maternal outcomes (pregnancy 
outcomes, abortions, still births and maternal viral load) and foetal outcomes (still births) 
following CAB use during pregnancy. The exposure to CAB relative to all gestation period 
including conception will be captured in this study, thus enabling assessment of pre-conception 
exposures along with first, second and third trimester exposures.

Study short name: Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR)   
Purpose of the study: The APR is an international registry that monitors prenatal exposures to 
antiretroviral drugs to detect a potential increase in the risk of birth defects through a prospective 
exposure-registration cohort. The APR is a ViiV Healthcare-sponsored study involving the 
collaborative effort of multiple companies. Data from the APR will assess maternal (pregnancy 
outcomes, abortions, still births and maternal viral load) and foetal outcomes (still births) following 
CAB use during pregnancy. Exposure to CAB relative to all gestation period and conception will be 
captured in the registry, thus enabling assessment of pre-conception exposures along with first, second 
and third trimester exposures.

Important risks of Vocabria 400 mg prolonged-release suspension for injection (2 mL), together with 
measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for learning more about Vocabria 400 mg 
prolonged-release suspension for injection (2 mL)'s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
ï‚·  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
ï‚· 
Important advice on the medicineâ€™s packaging; 
ï‚·  The authorised pack size â€” the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
ï‚·  The medicineâ€™s legal status â€” the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.

Evidence for linking the risk to the

Risk factors and risk groups 
In clinical studies, medication errors were uncommon; those that occurred 
had minimal clinical impact on subjects. There is potential for detection of 
some, but not all administration or dosing errors from the clinical studies and 
would likewise be the same in clinical practice as it is difficult to readily 
determine if an incorrect injectable dose has been administered. Overall, the 
potential risk to subjects due to medication errors is considered to be low, 
as the efficacy of the CAB+RPV regimen has not been affected in most 
cases observed in the clinical studies to date. 
Human factor studies were conducted using commercially representative 
medicinal product kits including representative drug product vials, to-be-
marketed delivery devices and packaging, and to-be-marketed labelling 
including instructions for use for the initiation and continuation doses of 
the combination drug regimen (CAB+RPV) under simulated use conditions 
with the objective to provide evidence that the user requirements have 
been adequately met. The conclusions from the human factor studies 
were used to create and refine the instructions for use. 
The risk of non-compliance and treatment discontinuation without prompt 
introduction of an appropriate new regimen is theoretical and could not be 
assessed in clinical trials. 
The CAB+RPV regimen will initially be novel to Healthcare Professionals. 
The treatment has either two or three stages for dosing; if an optional oral 
lead-in dosing is used, or direct initiation of injection dose(s), followed by 
different continuation injection doses corresponding to the Q4W and Q8W 
regimens, intramuscular initiation dose, and intramuscular continuation 
dose, with both CAB and RPV being administered as separate injections. 
There is a risk of administering an incomplete regimen, potentially resulting 
in sub- optimal therapeutic levels. Inadvertent partial intravenous 
administration resulting in a higher than expected peak exposure initially 
could occur if an injection were accidentally administered into a vein in the 
early phases followed by a decline in drug levels in later phases, also 
resulting in sub-optimal therapeutic levels. Treatment with CAB+RPV LA 
should not be initiated in patients who are not suitably suppressed, or those 
who may not be adherent to the regimen as this could potentially result in 
sub-optimal therapeutic levels.

II.C.1  Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation  
Study short name: Drug Utilization, Adherence, Effectiveness and Resistance: A 
Prospective Observational Cohort Study in Patients initiating an ARV regimen of 
CAB+RPV LA in Collaboration with EuroSIDA   
Purpose of the study: ViiV Healthcare proposes a five-year DUS to be conducted in a real-world 
context. This prospective observational cohort study will aim to better understand the patient 
population receiving CAB LA and/or RPV LA containing regimens in routine clinical practice, usage 
patterns, adherence, and post marketing clinical effectiveness of these regimens and monitor for 
resistance among virologic failures for whom data on resistance testing are available. All patients who 
discontinue the regimen for any reason, will be followed for 24 months after discontinuation. During 
this 24-month follow up period, the study will collect data on the ARV regimen in the patients who 
switches to subsequent to CAB+RPV LA discontinuation, patient virological outcomes and data on 
resistance, where tested for and as available. 
The proposed study will be conducted through collaboration with EuroSIDA, a well- established, 
prospective observational cohort study of more than 22,000 patients followed in over 100 hospitals 
in 31 European countries, Israel and Argentina. A detailed study protocol, once approved, will be 
implemented by the EuroSIDA coordinating centre. 
The study will evaluate the effectiveness of routine risk minimization measures for the safety concern 
of medication errors and assess the use of CAB LA and/or RPV LA containing injection regimens 
according to the SmPC recommendations by addressing the specific study objectives as outlined below. 
Following the initiation of any ARV regimen containing CAB LA and/or RPV LA among HIV infected 
patients, the study will aim to assess usage patterns, durability, discontinuation, and virological 
outcomes among persons first exposure to CAB LA and /or RPV LA containing regimens. The specific 
aims are to: 
1.  Describe CAB LA and/or RPV LA containing regimens usage patterns 
ï‚·  Descriptive analysis of patient population by baseline demographic and clinical 
characteristics 
ï‚·  Monitor for use of oral lead-in 
ï‚·  Comparison of treatment groups* 
a.  CAB LA monotherapy 
b.  CAB LA use in combination with ARVs other than RPV LA 
c.  RPV LA monotherapy 
d.  RPV LA use in combination with ARVs other than CAB LA 
e.  CAB+RPV LA containing regimens used in combination 
* Note that depending on numbers within these 5 treatment groups, groups may be combined.

2.  Assess adherence, durability and discontinuation for persons starting one of the regimens a-e 
above; 
ï‚·  Proportion of patients discontinuing the regimens of interest and lost to follow-up will be 
assessed. 
ï‚·  Reasons for discontinuation will be assessed. 
ï‚·  Non-adherence to dosing schedule will be assessed by 
a.  Estimating the number of patients that missed one or more consecutive injections 
without taking daily oral bridging therapy or any other oral ARV regimen while not on 
CAB LA and/or RPV LA containing regimens and average number of injections missed 
during a 12-month period 
b.  Estimating the number of patients who received the injections seven or more days later 
than their scheduled injection visit and average duration of delayed injections 
3.  Assess the clinical effectiveness (i.e. proportion of patients experiencing virologic failure) among 
HIV  patients  who  initiate  CAB+RPV  LA  regimen  and  had  suppressed  viral  load at  regimen 
initiation (VL <50 copies/mL without present or past evidence of viral resistance to, and no prior 
virological failure with agents of the NNRTI and INI class) 
ï‚·  Estimate the proportion of patients with virologic failure, during the first 6 months after initiation 
of CAB+RPV LA 
ï‚·  Estimate the proportion of patients with virologic failure, 6, 12 and 24 months after 
initiation of CAB+RPV LA 
4.  Monitor for resistance and next treatment response among individuals who switched off CAB LA 
and/or RPV LA containing regimens a-e, where viral load data are available and resistance testing 
has been done as part of routine clinical practice 
ï‚·  Describe the ARV regimen patients are switched to after discontinuation of CAB LA and/or 
RPV LA containing regimens 
ï‚·  Monitor for resistance during the 24 months following the switch 
ï‚·  Describe virologic outcomes at 24 months after discontinuation of CAB LA and/or RPV

Study short name: COMBINE-2 for Cabotegravir + Rilpivirine LA Regimen: A Prospective 
Cohort Study to Monitor Effectiveness, Adherence and Resistance   
Purpose of the study: The study will aim to gather data from 1000 patients to assess clinical 
effectiveness, adherence, durability and discontinuations after initiating CAB+RPV LA regimen. The 
study will also monitor for resistance and response to subsequent ARV regimen among patients who 
switched off CAB+RPV LA regimen. 
The study population will include HIV positive patients over the age of 18 years, from NEAT ID 
Network clinical sites who are prescribed CAB+RPV LA regimen. As per label, adults who are 
virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen 
without present or past evidence of viral resistance to, and no prior virological failure with agents 
of the NNRTI and INI class will be eligible for inclusion.

II.C.2  Other studies in post-authorisation development plan  
Study short name: A prospective observational cohort study to monitor for hepatotoxicity 
and regimen discontinuation due to liver related adverse events among patients initiating 
cabotegravir containing antiretroviral regimen.   
Purpose of the study: Uncommon cases of DILI with oral CAB were observed during the clinical trials 
program for CAB and RPV. During Phase III studies although hepatotoxicity was observed at higher 
rates with CAB LA compared to the oral comparator ART therapy, the difference was largely driven by 
acute viral hepatitis which occurred more frequently in subjects receiving CAB LA. Hepatotoxicity has 
been reported in a limited number of patients receiving CAB with or without known pre-existing 
hepatic disease. Healthcare professional should monitor liver chemistries and discontinue treatment 
with CAB if hepatotoxicity is suspected. 
ViiV Healthcare proposes a five-year post authorization safety study (PASS) to be conducted in a real-
world context. This prospective observational cohort study will monitor for hepatotoxicity and 
discontinuation of the regimen due to liver- related adverse events following initiation of CAB based 
ARV regimen. 
This safety study will be conducted through collaboration with EuroSIDA, a well-established, 
prospective observational cohort study of more than 22,000 patients followed in over 100 hospitals in 31 
European countries, Israel and Argentina. A detailed study protocol, once approved, will be implemented 
by the EuroSIDA coordinating centre. 
Following the initiation of any ARV regimen containing CAB LA among HIV infected patients, 
the study will aim to: 
1. 
characterise the rates and risks of hepatotoxicity by: 
ï‚·  estimating the incidence of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations and risk factors for 
elevations 
ï‚·  estimating the incidence of cases of combined ALT and total bilirubin elevations and risk 
factors for elevations 
2.  Estimate the number of patients discontinuing CAB based ARV regimen due to any reason and 
specifically discontinuations due to liver related adverse events 
Study short name: European Pregnancy and Paediatric HIV Cohort Collaboration 
(EPPICC)   
Purpose of the study: Data from the EPPICC will assess maternal outcomes (pregnancy outcomes, 
abortions, still births and maternal viral load) and foetal outcomes (still births) following CAB use 
during pregnancy. The exposure to CAB relative to all gestation period including conception will be 
captured in this study, thus enabling assessment of pre-conception exposures along with first, second 
and third trimester exposures.

Study short name: Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR)   
Purpose of Study: The APR is an international registry that monitors prenatal exposures to antiretroviral 
drugs to detect a potential increase in the risk of birth defects through a prospective exposure-
registration cohort. The APR is a ViiV Healthcare-sponsored study involving the collaborative effort of 
multiple companies. Data from the APR will assess maternal (pregnancy outcomes, abortions, still 
births and maternal viral load) and foetal outcomes (still births) following CAB use during pregnancy. 
Exposure to CAB relative to all gestation period and conception will be captured in the registry, thus 
enabling assessment of pre-conception exposures along with first, second and third trimester exposures.

CONFIDENTIAL 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
ï‚·  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
ï‚· 
Important advice on the medicineâ€™s packaging; 
ï‚·  The authorised pack size â€” the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
ï‚·  The medicineâ€™s legal status â€” the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Vocabria 600 mg prolonged-release 
suspension for injection (3 mL) is not yet available, it is listed under â€˜missing informationâ€™ below. 
II.A

Summary of important risks  
Important identified risk: Hepatotoxicity 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Clinical trials have shown that transient elevations of liver enzymes 
(transaminitis) can potentially occur with a CAB-containing regimen for a 
variety of reasons; these events are uncommon. Clinical study data from 
the development programme with CAB provide the evidence for this risk. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
None identified, as reports have been received involving a limited number 
of subjects receiving cabotegravir in clinical studies, with or without known 
pre-existing hepatic disease.

Important potential risk: Medication errors including treatment non-compliance 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
In clinical studies, medication errors were uncommon; those that occurred 
had minimal clinical impact on subjects. There is potential for detection of 
some, but not all administration or dosing errors from the clinical studies and 
would likewise be the same in clinical practice as it is difficult to readily 
determine if an incorrect injectable dose has been administered. Overall, the 
potential risk to subjects due to medication errors is considered to be low, 
as the efficacy of the CAB+RPV regimen has not been affected in most 
cases observed in the clinical studies to date. 
Human factor studies were conducted using commercially representative 
medicinal product kits including representative drug product vials, to-be-
marketed delivery devices and packaging, and to-be-marketed labelling 
including instructions for use for the initiation and continuation doses of 
the combination drug regimen (CAB+RPV) under simulated use conditions 
with the objective to provide evidence that the user requirements have 
been adequately met. The conclusions from the human factor studies 
were used to create and refine the instructions for use. 
The risk of non-compliance and treatment discontinuation without prompt 
introduction of an appropriate new regimen is theoretical and could not be 
assessed in clinical trials. 
The CAB+RPV regimen will initially be novel to Healthcare Professionals. 
The treatment has either two or three stages for dosing; if an optional oral 
lead-in dosing is used, or direct initiation of injection dose(s), followed by 
different continuation injection doses corresponding to the Q4W and Q8W 
regimens, intramuscular initiation dose, and intramuscular continuation 
dose, with both CAB and RPV being administered as separate injections. 
There is a risk of administering an incomplete regimen, potentially resulting 
in sub- optimal therapeutic levels. Inadvertent partial intravenous 
administration resulting in a higher than expected peak exposure initially 
could occur if an injection were accidentally administered into a vein in the 
early phases followed by a decline in drug levels in later phases, also 
resulting in sub-optimal therapeutic levels. Treatment with CAB+RPV LA 
should not be initiated in patients who are not suitably suppressed, or those 
who may not be adherent to the regimen as this could potentially result in 
sub-optimal therapeutic levels.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for epoetin theta, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Scientific conclusions and grounds for variation to the terms of the marketing 
authorisations 
Five cases of pure red cell aplasia were reported including three with positive neutralising antibodies 
tests (all by subcutaneous route). One case of pure red cell aplasia is particularly relevant because 
the patient had only received epoetin theta by subcutaneous route during one year but has no 
previous treatment with another erythropoietin stimulating agents. The role of epoetin theta cannot 
be excluded given the treatment duration (>1 year), the route of administration (subcutaneous) and 
the fact that no switch for another type of erythropoietin stimulating agents has been performed.  
Based on the above findings, the PRAC consider that the sections 4.4 and of 4.8 of the summary of 
product  characteristics  of  epoetin  theta  should  be  updated  to  reflect  that  neutralising  anti 
erythropoietin antibody-mediated pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) associated with epoetin theta therapy 
has been now reported in post marketing setting. The package leaflet should be updated accordingly. 
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR(s), the PRAC considered that changes 
to the product information of medicinal products containing epoetin theta were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for epoetin theta the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing epoetin theta is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

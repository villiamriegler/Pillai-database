ASSESSMENT 
Recommendation 
Based on the review of the data on safety and immunogenicity, the Rapporteur considers that the data 
of  the  interim  report  of  study  IC51-325,  long-term  immunity  and  safety  follow  up  of  infants  from  2 
months  to  18  years  of  age  in  a  paediatric  population  in  a  JEV-endemic  country  for  prevention  of  JEV 
infection should not be added to the SmPC and PIL of the product till all results of the ongoing booster 
study are available. 
Introduction 
This report concerns assessment of the interim report of safety and immunogenicity study CSR IC51-
325:  
“Long-term Immunity and Safety  With or Without a Booster Dose Following Primary Vaccination With 
the Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine IC51 (IXIARO) in a Pediatric Population in a JEV-endemic Country” 
which is submitted in the frame of Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 for Ixiaro. 
The MAH states that the clinical study interim report IC51-325 is submitted as Post Approval Measure 
resulting from the Typ II variation EMEA/H/C/0963/II/0039G. 
IXIARO  is  licensed  in  the  EU  since  31th  of  March  2009.  The  clinical  development  program  to  support 
licensure of IXIARO in adults consisted of 9 studies in which approx. 4,700 subjects were enrolled and 
vaccinated.  Currently  Ixiaro  is  indicated  for  active  immunization  against  Japanese  encephalitis  in 
children and adults from 2 months onwards. 
In  accordance  with  the  approved  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  (PIP)  EMEA-000559-PIP01-09-M03  the 
MAH has performed three clinical studies evaluating IXIARO in children.  
In study IC51-221 immunogenicity and safety of different dosages of IXIARO (2 doses of either 0.5 ml 
or 0.25 ml given on Day 0 and Day 28) has been compared to the locally licensed comparator vaccine 
JenceVac  (a  mouse-brain  derived,  inactivated  JE  vaccine  manufactured  by  Korean  Green  Cross)  on 
Days 0, 7 and 28 in a total of 60 children ≥ 1 to < 3 years of age. The results of study IC51-221 were 
discussed  during  the  PIP  agreement.  Based  on  those  data  the  PDCO  agreed  that  no  further  dose 
finding was needed in children <3 years of age.  
Study  IC51-322  was  designed  to  assess  the  systemic  and  local  safety  profile  and  immunogenicity  of 
IXIARO  administered  in  2  doses  in  a  28-day  interval  in  a  paediatric  population  (>2  months  to  18 
years)  from  non-endemic  regions.  It  was  planned  to  recruit  100  subjects,  however  due  to  slow 
recruitment, an interim report is provided including data from 60 subjects.  
Study IC51-323 was designed to assess the systemic and local safety profile of IXIARO administered in 
2 doses in a 28-day interval in a paediatric population (>2 months to 18 years) from endemic regions. 
In a  subset of subjects immunogenicity of IXIARO  was analysed. The study also assessed a potential 
‘half dose’ or 3µg given in 0.25ml in children ≥3 years to < 12 years. Active  comparators used were 
Prevenar and Havrix.  
Study  IC51-325  is  the  follow-up  study  of  IC51-323 to  investigate  the long-term  immunity  and  safety 
with  or  without  a  Booster  does  following  a  primary  vaccination  with  IXIARO.  The  study  involves 
children and adolescents aged ≥ 9 months to < 17 years and 7 months (at the time of enrolment into

For subjects in the Booster Group, the booster was administered once at 12 months after the first dose 
of  the  primary  immunization  with  IC51  in  Study  IC51-323.  The  IC51  dose  administered  for  boosting 
depended on the age of the subject at the visit at which the booster dose was given. Subjects aged ≥ 
14 months to < 3 years at Visit 2 were to receive a 0.25 mL dose and subjects aged ≥ 3 to < 18 years 
were to receive a dose of 0.5 mL.  
For adults, the rate of subjects with PRNT50 ≥ 1:10 varies between approximately 60% and 80% at 12 
months after the first dose of IC51. Based on these data, the EMA has approved that booster doses of 
IC51  should  be  administered  within  the  second  year  after  the  primary  series,  and  at  12  months  in 
subjects who are at continuous risk of contracting JE. 
Subjects were stratified by age as follows: 
Subjects in the Booster Group aged ≥ 14 months to < 3 years (at Visit 2 of this study): 
• 
IC51 0.25 mL, single booster dose intramuscularly, 12 months after first IC51 vaccination. 
Subjects in the Booster Group aged ≥ 3 to < 18 years (at Visit 2 of this study): 
• 
Batch number: JEV10C48B 
IC51 0.5 mL, single booster dose intramuscularly, 12 months after first IC51 vaccination. 
Study duration per subject was estimated to be 30 months (overall, including the parent study [IC51-
323], duration was estimated to be 37 months). 
For subjects in the Booster Group, the IC51 booster dose was to be given at Visit 2 (12 months [± 1 
month]  after  the  first  dose  of  IC51  in  Study  IC51-323).  Subjects  (or  parent/guardian)  were  to  be 
issued with diaries to record solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) on 7 consecutive days (Day 
0 to Day 6) after the booster injection. 
Immunogenicity and safety data were to be collected throughout the study from all subjects. 
Assessor’s comments: 
This study was designed to investigate the neccessity and time-frame of a booster-dose of Ixiaro after 
primary immunisation in the pediatric population. The immunogenicity results of study IC51-325 must 
be interpreted with some caution. In this study the immunogenicity of Ixiaro has been investigated in 
children and adolescents from the Philippines where natural exposure to JEV  and other flaviviruses is 
very common. Baseline seropositivity for JEV and DENV was found in a high proportion of subjects in 
the  parent  study  IC51-323.  Consequently,  natural  boosting  by  JEV  exposure  in  some  individuals  can 
also not be excluded. 
o  Study population / sample size 
300 healthy children were eligible for enrollment if they were 9 months to 18 years of age, received 2 
recommended doses in the parent study IC51-323, with their parent(s) / legal representative providing 
signed  consent  form  and  able  to  understand  the  protocol  requirements  and  to  fill  in  the  diary  card.

Between 08-December-2010 (first subject first visit) and 11-Nov-2011, a total of 300  subjects were 
enrolled at 3 centers in the Philippines and data are summarized till Visit 2 or Visit 2 a. 
o  Randomization procedure 
An  interactive  voice  response  system  (IVRS)/interactive  web  response  system  (IWRS)  was  used  to 
allocate subjects to the treatment groups (i.e., Booster or Non-booster Group). 
Investigators were to use the IVRS/IWRS to enroll and randomize subjects. 
o  Blinding 
For this open-label study, measures to maintain blinding are not applicable for this study. 
o  Treatments 
Subjects  in  the  Booster  Group  were  administered  a  single  booster  injection,  the  dose  of  which 
depended on their age at the booster administration visit (i.e., Visit 2, Month 12): 
• 
• 
IC51 3 μg/0.25 mL, intramuscularly, for subjects aged < 3 years; 
IC51 6 μg/0.5 mL, intramuscularly, for subjects aged ≥ 3 years. 
To  determine  JEV  neutralizing  antibody  titers  and  SCRs,  blood  samples  were  to  be  collected  from  all 
subjects at all visits (at Visit 1 only if not already performed as part of Visit 4 in Study IC51-323). 
o  Outcomes/Safety Criteria 
For subjects in the Booster Group, the IC51 booster dose was to be given at Visit 2 (12 months [± 1 
month]  after  the  first  dose  of  IC51  in  Study  IC51-323).  Subjects  (or  parent/guardian)  were  to  be 
issued with diaries to record solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) on 7 consecutive days (Day 
0 to Day 6) after the booster injection. 
Immunogenicity and safety data were to be collected throughout the study from all subjects. 
Solicited AEs were: 
• 
Local  symptoms:  injection  site  pain  (i.e.,  pain  without  touching),  itching,  tenderness  (i.e.,  pain 
upon touching), hardening, swelling, redness. 
•  Systemic  symptoms:  headache,  muscle  pain,  flu
like  symptoms,  excessive  fatigue,  rash,  fever 
(measured), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, irritability, loss of appetite.

At  Visit  2,  approximately  1  hour  after  the  booster  dose  and  at  Visit  2a,  the  injection  site  was  to  be 
inspected  by  the  investigator,  and  presence,  size  and  severity  of  local  reactions  were  assessed  and 
recorded. 
Recording Solicited Adverse Events in the Diary 
One  hour  after  the  booster  dose  was  administered,  the  investigator  and  the  subject/subject’s  legal 
representative were to complete the first day of the subject diary together. The subject/subject’s legal 
representative was to be trained by the investigator on how to complete the diary for the following 6 
days, including the recording of any symptoms, the measuring of the size of the affected area with a 
ruler,  where  appropriate,  and  taking  the  body  temperature  with  an  infrared  thermometer  in  the 
subject’s ear. 
Any symptoms that were ongoing after Day 6, and the date of the last day of symptoms, were also to 
be recorded. 
Subjects  were  to  complete  the  diary  themselves  unless  they  were  unable  to  read  and  write  or 
understand  the  diary  process,  in  which  case  the  subject’s  legal  representative  was  to  complete  the 
diary.  The  presence/absence  and  size/severity  of  local  and  systemic  symptoms  were  to  be  recorded 
once a day, at approximately the same time. The subject/subject’s legal representative was to record 
the  severity  of  a  symptom  by  ticking  the  appropriate  description  from  a  list,  to  help  remember  the 
event. This list was not identical to the grading scale used by the investigator to assess severity. The 
information  provided  by  the  subject’s  diary  was  to  form  the  basis  of  the  investigator’s  severity 
assessment when the diary was reviewed with the subject/subject’s legal representative at Visit 2a (or 
Early Termination Visit if applicable). 
Unsolicited Adverse Events 
An  AE  was  defined  as  any  untoward  medical  occurrence  in  a  subject  administered  an  investigational 
product, whether or not related to the treatment (i.e., vaccine). 
Any  symptoms  or  medical  events  not  solicited  were  unsolicited  AEs  and  were  to  be  graded  for 
intensity/severity and causality by the investigator. 
Laboratory  values  falling  outside  the  reference  range  were  to  be  assessed  by  the  investigator  and,  if 
clinically relevant, reported as an AE. 
Medically Attended Adverse Events 
All  AEs  where  the  subject  was  seeking  medical  care  (i.e.,  doctor’s  office,  emergency  service  or 
hospital) were to be considered medically attended AEs. An AE was not considered medically attended 
if the subject was using non
prescribed drugs. 
The investigator had to immediately report all SAEs.

Analysis Populations 
Safety  Population:  All  safety  analyses  were  based  on  the  Safety  Population,  defined  as  subjects  who 
entered into the study and were randomized. 
Intent-to-treat  (ITT)  Population:  The  ITT  Population  was  the  primary  analysis  population  for  the 
immunogenicity analyses and was defined as all subjects randomized. 
Per–Protocol  (PP)  Population:  Immunogenicity  analyses  were  repeated  for  the  PP  Population  and 
excluded any randomized subjects who met certain criteria. 
o  Protocol amendments 
There were no changes in the conduct of the study and no amendments to the protocol. 
  Results 
•  Recruitment/number analyzed 
Of  the  300  subjects  enrolled  in  the  study,  5  subjects  were  excluded  from  the  ITT  population  due  to 
major protocol violations. Table 1 shows the enrolled subjects. 
All subjects were Asian in origin. Age was a factor in determining a subject’s dose group in the Booster 
Group and so differences between dose groups in weight, height and body mass index were expected.

Proportions of male and female subjects were similar in the IC51 0.25 mL dose group but there were 
more  males  (59.7%)  than  females  (40.3%)  in  the  IC51  0.5  mL  dose  group.  More  details  on  age  of 
subjects are provided in the immunogenicity analysis.

Assessor’s comments: 
Overall  the  study  was  well  conducted.  Safety  results  were  available  for  all  of  the  300  randomized 
subjects.  The  dropout  rate  (1.6%)  is  low  for  the  time  of  the  interim  analysis.  6  minor  protocol 
violations  were  listed.  Two  subjects  reported  a  medical  history  of  dengue  prior  to  first  vaccination  in 
the parent study, one subject had visit 2 out of timeframe, one subject used prohibited medication of 
Prednisone  and  two  subjects  received  the  second  dose  of  Ixiaro  out  of  the  timeframe  in  the  parent 
study IC51-323. 
• 
Preliminary safety analysis  
In  the  safety  results,  ‘Month  12’  and  ‘Month  13’  refer  to  data  collected  at  Visit  2  and  Visit  2a, 
respectively; the time points are not a strict cut-off of 12 or 13 months after the initial vaccination in 
Study IC51-323. 
Of  the  150  subjects  in  the  Booster  Group,  148  subjects  received  the  booster  dose  at  Visit  2  (12 
months).  Mean  time  from  first  vaccination  in  Study  IC51-323  to  Visit  1  of  this  study  (Month  7)  and 
mean  time  from  Visit  2  (Month  12)  when  the  booster  was  administered  to  Visit  2a  (Month  13)  are

Assessor’s comments: 
Two  subjects  in  the  Booster  group  withdrew  from  study  prior  vaccination.  The  mean  time  of 
approximately  9  months  from  the  first  vaccination  in  the  parent  study  IC51-323  to  Visit  1  of  the 
current study was comparable for the two dose groups (258.8 days in 0.25 mL dose group vs. 262.6 
days  in  the  0.5  mL  dose  group).  The  time-period  from  Visit  2  at  month  12  (Booster-vaccination)  to

Visit 2a at month 13 (blood draw for antibody determination) was 28.7 days with a standard deviation 
of 8.69. For both dose groups the time-periods were comparable.  
Long-term Safety analysis prior to Booster vaccination 
All AEs reported as not recovered/not resolved at Month 7 (i.e., Visit 4 in Study IC51-323/Visit 1 in this 
study) and all new AEs reported in the Booster and Non-booster Groups up to Visit 2 (Month 12) were 
included in the analysis of AEs and are summarized in Table 3 and by age group in Table 4. The same 
4 age groups used for analysis and randomization in the parent study, i.e., ≥ 2 months to < 1 year; ≥ 
1  year  to  <  3  years;  ≥  3  years  to  <  12  years;  and  ≥  12  years  to  <  17  years  of  age at  primary 
immunization/Visit 1  in  Study  IC51-323,  were  used  for  the  analysis  of  unsolicited  AEs  from  Visit  1 of 
this study (Month 7) to Visit 2 (Month 12).

Table 3: Summary of Adverse Events from Visit 1 (Month 7) up to Visit 2 
(Month 12), Safety Population 
Assessor’s comment: 
The  safety  profile  of  both  groups  was  comparable.  40.3  %  of  study  subjects  reported  unsolicited 
adverse  events  that  started  at  beginning  of  the  current  trial  until  Visit  2  (month  12)  or  were  still 
unresolved from the parent Study IC51-323. The majority of AEs were rated with Grade 1 and 3.7 % 
rated their reported AEs as Grade 2. Only 1 % of subjects rated their observed AEs as Grade 3. None 
of  the  AEs  was  rated  as  Grade  4.  One  unrelated  SAE(  a  subject  with  concussion  secondary  to  a  fall) 
was  reported.  46  subjects  (15.3%)  reported  medically  attended  AEs,  which  were  infections  and 
infestations. No related medically AE was observed until Visit 2 in the clinical trial. No deaths ocurred in 
the study so far. 
The  next  Table  4  shows  a  summary  of  all  adverse  events  from  Visit  1  up  to  Visit  2  stratified  by  age

Age Group, Safety Population 
Assessor’s comments: 
Overall  the  rate  of  systemic  as  well  as  local  solicited  AEs  was  very  low  in  all  age  groups  which  were 
investigated in the ongoing study. 
There is a clear trend that the incidence of unsolicited AEs was highest in the younger age group (50 
%) and much lower in subjects ≥ 3 years to < 12 years (25.9 %) and in subjects ≥ 12 years to < 17 
years (26.8 %). The same trend was observed for infections and infestations (medically attended AEs). 
None  of  the  reported  AEs  in  any  age  group  was  considered  by  the  investigators  to  be  related  to  the 
study vaccine. 
Booster Dose Safety 
All AEs reported in the Booster Group from after the booster dose at Visit 2 (Month 12) up until Visit 2a 
(Month 13) were included in the analysis of AEs and are summarized in Table 5. 
For the purpose of comparing with the safety data at primary immunization, AEs starting between Visit 
2 and Visit 2a for the Booster Group were tabulated stratified by age at booster immunization/Visit 2, 
as follows: ≥ 9 months to 3 years; ≥ 3 to 12 years; ≥ 12 to 18 years.

Table 5: Summary of Adverse Events after the Booster Dose up to Visit 2a 
(Month 13), Booster Group Only, Safety Population 
Overall,  32.7%  of  study  subjects  who  received  a  booster  dose  of  IC51  reported  any  solicited  or 
unsolicited AE between Visit 2 (Month 12) and Visit 2a (Month 13); 29.6% with the 0.25 mL booster 
and 37.3% with the 0.5 mL booster dose. Solicited AE were reported by a total of 19.3% of subjects 
after  the  booster,  and  unsolicited  AE  by  a  total  of  20.7%  of  subjects;  in  two  subjects  (1.3%), 
unsolicited AEs were possibly related to vaccination. 
One SAE (abscess; Subject 23101256; booster dose of IC51 0.25 mL) reported between booster dose 
administration and Visit 2a (Month 13) was considered related to the study vaccine by the investigator, 
but not by the sponsor; this SAE was also the only medically attended AE that was considered related 
to  the  study  vaccine.  Overall,  2  subjects  (1.3%)  were  reported  with  SAEs  and  a  small  number  of 
subjects overall (13 subjects, 8.7%) were reported with medically attended AEs (Table 5): 
• 
In the ≥ 9 months to < 3 years age group, no SAE was reported. A total of 9 subjects (11.3%) had 
medically attended AEs. 
In the ≥ 3 years to < 12 years age group, 1 subject (2.6%) had an SAE and 3 subjects (7.7%) had 
medically  attended  AEs.  The  SAE  of  abscess,  which  was  also  a  medically  attended  AE,  was 
considered related to study vaccine by the investigator, but not by the sponsor. 
In the ≥ 12 years to < 18 years age group, 1 subject (3.4%) had an SAE of dengue fever and 1 
subject (3.4%) had a medically attended AE. 
• 
• 
The majority of medically attended AEs up to Visit 2a (Month 13) were infections and infestations and 
the  most  frequently  reported  medically  attended  AE  was  upper  respiratory  tract  infection.  The  only 
Ixiaro 
P46 038 
Page 12/29 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
medically  attended  AE  considered  related  to  the  study  vaccine  by  the  investigator  was  an  SAE  of 
abscess. 
Assessor’s comment: 
Again the safety profile of Ixiaro observed was comparable. Overall the rate of medically attended AEs 
observed in the time-period after the booster dose at Visit 2 until Visit 2a was 8.8 % of all subjects (13 
of 148 subjects). The percentage of medically attended AEs was lower after the Booster in comparison 
to  the  primary  vaccination.  Unfortunately  for  this  interim  analysis  these  data  were  only  presented  in 
line listings. The MAH should provide a summary of all medically attended AEs per age stratum in the 
final  report  of  this  study.  Two  SAEs  were  recorded  within  the  time  frame  of  one  month:  one  subject 
suffered from an abscess rated as related by the investigator but not by the sponsor and one subject 
suffered  from  dengue  fever  (unrelated).  As  the  abscess  was  not  located  at  the  vaccination  site  the 
assessor concurs with the sponsor’s judgement of non-relatedness. 
Solicited Adverse Events 
Solicited  AEs  experienced by  subjects  aged  ≥  9  months  to  <  3  years  within  7  days  after  the  booster 
dose are summarized by maximum severity in Table 6. 
Table  6:  Solicited  Adverse  Events  Experienced  by  Subjects  Aged  ≥  9  Months  to  <  3  Years 
within 7 Days after the Booster Dose by Maximum Severity, Safety Population 
Assessor’s comment: 
The  profile  of  solicited  reactions  is  comparable  to  that  seen  for  most  other  vaccines.  Overall  a  low 
percentage of subjects in the age group ≥ 9 months to < 3 years reported solicited adverse events. 5 
% of subjects reported any local AE and 10 % reported any systemic AE. The most frequently reported 
local AEs were injection site swelling (3.8 %) and the most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs 
were fever (6.3 %) as well as loss of appetite and irritability (each 2.5 %). The majority of AEs were 
graded as mild with the exception of one subject, who graded the swelling with Grade 3. Two events 
were rated with Grade 2: one subject reported swelling and another subject reported irritability. 
The solicited adverse events experienced by subjects aged ≥ 3 years to < 12 years within 7 days after 
the booster dose are summarized by maximum severity in Table 7.

Assessor’s comment: 
There was one application of a wrong dosage: Per protocol all subjects aged ≥ 3 years to < 12 years 
should have received a Booster dose of 0.5 mL of Ixiaro, but 1 subject incorrectly received 0.25 mL of 
Ixiaro,  which  is  shown  on  the  left  site  of  the  Table  7.  The  subject  who  received  the  incorrect  dose 
experienced  no  local  solicited  AE  but  flu-like  symptoms,  excessive  fatigue  and  loss  of  appetite  all 
classified Grade 3 and fever classified Grade 1.  
10.5% of 38 subjects who received the correct Booster dose of 0.5 mL experienced local solicited AEs 
which were all classified Grade 1. The most frequently reported systemic solicited AEs were fever (10.5 
%)  and  loss  of  appetite  (5.3 %).  All  systemic  events  were  classified  Grade 1,  but  one  event  of  fever 
was  classified  Grade 2.  Apparently  there is  no  dose dependent  frequency  of  solicited  adverse events. 
As expected a lower frequency of solicited local and systemic events was reported in the age group ≥ 9 
months to < 3 years (15 %) compared to subjects aged ≥ 3 years to < 12 years (26.3 %). 
Solicited AEs experienced by subjects aged ≥ 12 years to < 18 years within 7 days after the booster 
dose are summarized by maximum severity in Table 8.

Assessor’s comments: 
The  profile  of  solicited  reactions  is  comparable  to  that  seen  with  most  other  vaccines.  In  the  ≥  12 
years to < 18 years age group, 13.8% of subjects (4 of 29 subjects) had at least 1 solicited local AE 
and 20.7 % at least 1 solicited systemic AE within 7 days after the booster dose of 0.5 mL of Ixiaro. 
Pain  and  tenderness  were  mostly  classified  Grade  1  and  fever  as  well  as  headache  (each  6.9  %  as 
systemic AEs Grade 1). 1 event of vomiting and 1 event of diarrhea were classified Grade 2. No Grade 
3 events were reported.

Assessor’s comment 
With  regards  to  the  frequency  of  reported  unsolicited  AE  no  age  dependency  was  seen  as  for  the 
solicited AEs. Overall the unsolicited AEs after the booster dose were reported by 20.7 % of subjects. 
The  majority  of  subjects  reported  infections  and  infestations  which  mostly  consisted  of  upper 
respiratory  tract  infections  and  nasopharyngitis.  The  reported  frequencies  of  unsolicited  AEs  are 
comparable to the frequencies reported for the 5 months period between Visit 1 and Visit 2 before the 
booster dose was given. There is one AE (pruritus) considered related to the study vaccine in the age 
group  ≥  3  years  to  <  12  years.  This  event  of  pruritus  falls  under  the  predefined  “cases  of  special 
interest”  (i.e.  allergies)  after  the  booster  dose.  No  neurological  AEs  of  special  interest  were  reported 
until Visit 2a.

Assessor’s comments 
No  marked  changes  were  noted  neither  for  the  time  period  before  the  booster  dose  nor  after  the 
booster dose. 
SAEs 
Before the administration of the Booster dose one SAE of concussion was reported of severe intensitiy, 
which was considered as unrelated by the investigator. One subject was admitted to hospital after he 
received the booster dose and was diagnosed with dengue hemorrhagic fever.The SAE of dengue was 
considered not related. Another SAE of abscess was reported, which was considered as related by the 
investigator.  Two  independent  DSMB  members,  who  concluded  that  they  would  hardly  see  any 
relationship, unless the abscess developed at the site of the vaccine administration, which was not the 
case. 
Assessor’s comment: 
All three reported SAEs were considered as unrelated and all three SAEs are considered resolved. No 
deaths were reported. 
Assessor’s discussion on safety: 
Ixiaro given as a Booster dose 12 months after primary vaccination was demonstrated to be safe and 
well-tolerated in all pediatric age groups in this study. Overall the safety and  reactogenicity profile of 
Ixiaro seen after a Booster dose resulted in a lower AE rate compared to previous experience with this 
vaccine in a pediatric population after primary vaccination. No death was reported. All three reported 
SAEs were considered as unrelated and resolved. No new safety signals occurred.

Preliminary immonogenicity analysis  
All immunogenicity analyses were carried out using the ITT Population and were repeated using the PP 
Population as a supportive analysis. 
The  immunogenicity  of  IC51  was  assessed  for  the  Booster  Group  at  13  months  (Visit  2a)  after  the 
primary immunization, which was approximately 1 month after a single booster dose was administered 
at Visit 2, and for the Non-booster Group immunogenicity was assessed at 12 months after the primary 
immunization.  The  immunogenicity  endpoints  were  SCR  rates,  fold  increase  rates  and  GMTs.  The 
Ixiaro

analyses  were  repeated  with  stratifications  by  age  group  and  pre-existing  JEV  and  DENV  status  (see

A small number of subjects (34 of 300 subjects [11.3%]) in the Safety Population had a pre-existing 
JEV  antibody  PRNT50  titer  of  1:10  or  greater  and  were  considered  seropositive  at  baseline  of  Study 
IC51-323: 19 subjects (12.7%) in the Booster Group (0.25 mL, 1 [1.2%]; 0.5 mL, 17 [25.4%]) and 15 
subjects (10.0%) in the Non-booster Group.

Baseline  DENV  antibodies  were  present  in  85  of  300  subjects  (28.3%):  41  subjects  (27.3%)  in  the 
Booster Group (0.25 mL, 7 [8.6%]; 0.5 mL, 33 [49.3%]) and 44 subjects (29.3%) in the Non-booster 
Group. 
In the immunogenicity results, ‘Month 12’ and ‘Month 13’ refer to data collected at Visit 2 and Visit 2a, 
respectively; the time points are not a strict cut-off of 12 or 13 months after the initial vaccination in 
Study IC51-323. The mean time between Visit 2 and Visit 2a was 28.7 days, with a minimum of 7 days 
and a maximum of 52 days. To determine if time between Visit 2 and Visit 2a had an influence, GMTs 
were  also  summarized  at  Visit  2a  for  the  Booster  Group,  by  dose,  stratified  by  the  number  of  days 
between the Visit 2 (Month 12) and Visit 2a (Month 13) visits (7 to 15 days; 16 to 21 days; 22 to 35 
days; 36 to 52 days). 
The majority of subjects (107 of 150 subjects) had immunogenicity samples taken between 22 and 35 
days (i.e., Visit 2a) after the booster dose, which was administered at Visit 2. The seroconverion rates 
(primary endpoint), fold increase rates and geometric mean titers are summarized in Table 13 before 
and after the Booster dose.

Vaccination with a booster of IC51, comprising a dose of either 0.25 mL or 0.5 mL given approximately 
12  months  after  the  initial  vaccination,  produced  a  pronounced  immune  response  at  Visit  2a  (Month 
13) in all subjects in the ITT Population (Table 13): 
• 
Prior to the booster, seroconversion (defined as a PRNT50 titer ≥ 1:10) was still evident in 97.5% 
of subjects (95% CI: 91.4 to 99.3) in the group of subjects who later received the IC51 0.25 mL 
booster and in 89.6% of subjects (95% CI: 80.0 to 94.8) in the IC51 0.5 mL booster group; 
• 
•  After the booster, seroconversion occurred in all subjects in both the IC51 0.25 mL booster group 
(100.0%  of  subjects  [95%  CI:  95.5  to  100.0])  and  the  IC51  0.5  mL  booster  group  (100.0%  of 
subjects [95% CI: 94.6 to 100.0]); 
Four-fold  or  higher  increases  in  post-booster  titers  over  the  pre-booster  titers  were  observed  in 
91.9% of subjects (95% CI: 86.4 to 95.3) overall (in the IC51 0.25 mL booster group, 91.4% of 
subjects [95% CI: 83.2 to 95.8] and in the IC51 0.5 mL booster group, 92.5% of subjects [95% 
CI: 83.7 to 96.8]); 
Ten-fold  or  higher  increases  in  post-booster  versus  pre-booster titers  were  observed  in  82.4%  of 
subjects  (95%  CI:  75.5  to  87.7)  overall  (in  the  IC51  0.25  mL  booster  group,  86.4%  of  subjects 
[95% CI: 77.3 to 92.2] and in the IC51 0.5 mL booster group, 77.6% of subjects [95% CI: 66.3 to 
85.9]); 
• 
•  Geometric mean titers rose substantially after the booster dose in both the IC51 0.25 mL booster 
group  (from  67.27  pre-booster  to  2910.84  [95%  CI:  2235.06  to  3790.96])  and  the  IC51  0.5  mL 
booster group (from 40.40 pre-booster to 1365.87 [95% CI: 987.62 to 1888.98]). 
Assessor’s comments: 
Participants  who  were  primarily  vaccinated  with  two  doses  of  the  lower  dose  increment  (0.25  mL) 
showed  higher  seroconversion  rates  (97.5  %)  pre  Booster-  dose  compared  to  participants  who 
received two doses of the higher dose increment (0.5 mL) (89.6 %). The same trend was observed for 
the increase of titre after the Booster-dose. The Ten-fold increases in post-booster versus pre-booster 
titers were observed in 86.4 % of subjects, who received a 0.25 mL dose versus 77.6 % in subjects, 
who received a 0.5 mL dose. GMT increased approximately two times higher (2910.84) in the 0.25 mL 
group compared to the 0.5 mL group (1365.87). Seroconversion rate was 100 % in both dose groups. 
As  the  time  between  Visit  2  (booster  administration)  and  Visit  2a  (serological  sampling)  was  variable 
with  a  mean  of  28.7  days,  a  minimum  of  7  days  and  a  maximum  of  52  days,  GMTs  were  also

summarized at Visit 2a for the Booster Group, by dose, stratified by the number of days between the 
Visit 2 (Month 12) and Visit 2a (Month 13) visits (7 to 15 days; 16 to 21 days; 22 to 35 days; 36 to 52

Assessor’s comments: 
Due to the limited number of subjects in the different time-frames (7 to 15 days, 16 to 21 day and 36 
to  52  days)  the  results  of  GMTs  should  be  interpreted  with  caution.  Nevertheless  a  clear  trend  of 
increasing GMTs was observed with increasing time after the Booster dose until Day 35. After Day 35 a 
trend of decreasing GMTs was seen. 
Age dependency on Boosterability 
A  summary  of  SCR,  fold  increase  rates  and  GMTs  by  age  group  is  presented  in  Table  15  for  the  ITT

Assessor’s comments: 
Seroconversion rates observed pre-Booster differed only slightly in the different age and dose groups 
(78.6 % aged 1 to 3 years 0.5 mL to 100 % in most age groups). One month after the Booster-dose all 
subjects  showed  100  %  seroconversion.  With  regards  to  Ten-fold  increase  in  titers  the  magnitude  of 
the immune response in the older age group was generally lower compared to the younger age groups. 
There  is  however  a  significant  difference  in  the  antibody  levels  observed  following  vaccination  with 
Booster  doses  of  either  0.25mL  or  0.5mL  vaccine.  Children  receiving  the  half  dose  had  higher  GMTs 
after  the  Booster  dose  at month  13  (4075.93  <  1  year  and  2696.93  <  3years)  compared to  children 
receiving  the  full  vaccine  dose  (2029.32,  1  year  to  <  3  years;  1483.94,  3  years  to  <  12  years  and 
889.87, 12 years to < 17 years). Children in all age groups were boosterable one year after the first 
administration  of  Ixiaro,  but  resulted  in  different  antibody  levels  depending  on  the  dose  (0.25  mL  or 
0.5 mL) of the booster and the age of the vaccinee. 
Just for information: 
Results from booster vaccinations in adult subjects indicate that the immune response is boosterable in 
subjects  with  low  or  no  detectable  antibody  levels  up  to  24  month  following  the  primary  vaccination 
series.

Assessor’s comment: 
Table 16 shows determination of JEV antibody levels of the Booster group at month 12 (seropositive or 
seronegative subjects). 
These  results  should  again  be  interpreted  with  caution  due  to  the  very  low  number  of  subjects  being 
seronegative  prior  to  the  Booster.  All  seronegative  subjects  seroconverted  after  the  Booster  with  a 
much lower antibody response 224.01 (0.25 mL dose group); 671.93 (0.5 mL dose group) compared 
to the seropositive subjects 3106.10 (0.25 mL dose group); 1483.72 (0.5 mL dose group). 
Immunogenicity without the Booster

Group, 
by 
Up  to  Visit  2  (Month  12),  the  booster  and  non-booster  group  did  not  differ  in  treatments;  hence  the 
antibody persistence data could be pooled for the total population for Month 12, resulting in a higher 
sample size. 
As already observed in Study IC51-323, the antibody levels declined considerably between Day 56 and 
Month 7 (Visit 4 in Study IC51-323/Visit 1 in Study IC51-325): 
seroconversion  from  100.0%  to  87.7%  of  the  total  subjects  and  the  GMT  from  207.24  to  46.63.  At 
Visit 2 (Month 12), the immune response persisted and remained consistent with the level of response 
seen at Visit 1 (Month 7) (Table 17; ITT Population): 
•  Seroconversion rates overall were slightly lower at Visit 1 (Month 7; 87.7% of subjects [95% CI: 
83.5 to 90.9]) than at Visit 2 (Month 12) (91.9% of subjects [95% CI: 88.3 to 94.5]); 
•  Geometric mean titers overall were approximately the same at  Visit 1 (Month 7; 46.63 [95% CI: 
40.57 to 53.61]) and Visit 2 (Month 12) (49.30 [95% CI: 43.37 to 56.04]). 
Results for the time points before the booster were similar for the Booster Group and the Non-booster 
Group.

Table 18: Seroconversion  and  Raw  Geometric  Mean  Titers  after  Primary  Immunization  with 
IXIARO, Stratified by Age Group (as at Primary Immunization), Intent-to-treat Population 
Assessor’s comments: 
As already observed in the Booster groups the GMTs declined in all age groups considerably between 
Day 56 and month 7. A slight GMT decline was observed between month 7 and month 12 in all age-
groups. The immune response persisted in all age groups until 12 months after the first vaccination of 
Ixiaro.  In  both  middle  age  groups  the  antibody  persistence  was  generally  lower  compared  to  the 
youngest  and  oldest  age  groups.  Overall  the  results  of  antibody  persistence  in  all  age  groups  were 
comparable  between  the  Booster-group  and  Non-Booster-group  till  month  12  after  the  first 
vaccination.

Assessor’s discussion on immunogenicity 
12  months  after  the  primary  vaccination  series  with  Ixiaro  all  age  groups  showed  sustained  antibody 
persistence.  GMTs  remained  slightly  higher  in  the  younger  age  groups  who  received  either  0.25  mL 
compared  to  the  older  age  groups  who  received  0.5  mL.  All  subjects  in  the  Booster  group  were 
boosterable  and  achieved  protective  titers  of  antibodies  one  month  after  vaccination  with  either  0.25 
mL or 0.5 mL of Ixiaro. Most subjects had at least a 4-fold titer increase one month after the booster 
dose  in  all  pediatric  age  groups.  Antibody  titers  declined  considerably  between  day  56  and  month  7 
and stayed more or less stable until month 12 after the primary vaccination series. Higher GMTs were 
observed  in  younger  children  who  were  aged  less  than  1  year  at  priming  compared  to  the  older 
pediatric age groups.

RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND FURTHER ACTION IF 
REQUIRED 
The  ongoing  study  was  well  conducted,  with  all  randomized  participants  being  vaccinated  in  the 
booster group and analyzed for safety and immunogenicity outcomes. The dropout rate was low. 
The  vaccine  proved  to  be  safe  and  well  tolerated  by  subjects  aged  9  months  to  18  years  for  the 
booster  dose  with  either  0.25  mL  or  0.5  mL  depending  on  the  age  of  the  subjects  .  Analysis  of 
frequency  of  AEs  was  performed  according  to  3  age  Strata  (≥  9  months  to  <  3  years  old  subjects 
received 0.25 mL as a Booster dose whereas subjects aged ≥ 3 years to < 12 years received 0.5 mL).  
A lower frequency of solicited local and systemic events was reported in the  youngest age group (15 
%) compared to subjects aged ≥ 3 years to < 12 years (26.3 %). The highest frequency (34.5 %) of 
solicited local and systemic events was reported from the adolescents aged ≥ 12 years to < 18 years. 
Contrary to that the frequency of reported unsolicited AE showed no age dependency for the solicited 
AEs.  Overall  the  unsolicited  AEs  after  the  booster  dose  were  reported  by  20.3  %  of  subjects.  The 
majority  of  subjects  reported  infections  and  infestations,  which  were  frequently  reported  being  upper 
respiratory tract infections and nasopharyngitis. Overall the rate of adverse events was lower after the 
given Booster-dose compared to the primary vaccinations. 
All three reported SAEs were considered as unrelated and all three SAEs are considered resolved. No 
deaths were reported. No new safety signals were seen. 
Antibody persistence up to 12 month after the first vaccination was still high with lower antibody titers 
in the middle aged children compared to the youngest and oldest age groups. 
The immune response to the booster dose given 12 months after the first vaccination of Ixiaro showed 
high  antibody  titers  and  seroconversion  rate  of  100  %  in  all  age  groups  and  subjects  of  both  dose 
groups.  Ten-fold  increases  in  post-booster  versus  pre-booster  titers  were  observed  in  86.4  %  of 
subjects who received a 0.25 mL dose versus 77.6 % in subjects who received a 0.5 mL dose. GMTs 
were two fold higher (2910.84) in the 0.25 mL group compared to the 0.5 mL group (1365.87) [Table 
13]. The magnitude of the immune responses in the older age group was generally lower compared to 
the younger age groups. 
Nevertheless this study  was designed to investigate the  neccessity and time-frame of a booster-dose 
of  Ixiaro  after  primary  immunisation  in  the  pediatric  population.  The  immunogenicity  results of  study 
IC51-325  must  be  interpreted  with  caution.  In  this  study  the  immunogenicity  of  Ixiaro  has  been 
investigated in children and adolescents from the Philippines, where natural exposure to JEV and other 
flaviviruses is very common. Baseline seropositivity for JEV and DENV was found in a high proportion 
of  subjects  in  the  parent  study  IC51-323  and  a  natural  boosting  by  JEV  infection  in  some  individuals 
can also not be excluded and might have biased the results.  
Ixiaro is approved in the EU for children older than 2 months as a traveller’s vaccine. Natural boosting 
of JEV usually does not occur in Europe. 
The  design  of  this  Booster  study  IC51-325  is  in  compliance  with  the  latest  version  of  the  paediatric 
investigation plan (PIP). 
Overall  these  data  of  safety  and  immunogenicity  of  a  booster  dose  of  Ixiaro  generated  in  a  pediatric 
population  should  be  implemented  in  the  SmPC  and  PIL  after  all  results  of  the  ongoing  study  will  be 
available.

1.  Background information on the procedure
1.1.  Submission of the dossier
Pursuant  to  Article  7.2(b)  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No 1234/2008,  Boehringer  Ingelheim 
International  GmbH  submitted  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  on  05  January  2010  an  application 
for a group of variations consisting of an Extension of the Marketing Authorisation, 6 Type II variations, 
12 Type IB variations and 17 Type IA variations (including 3 Type IAIN).
The  extension  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  for  the  above mentioned  medicinal  product  concerns  a 
new strength: 150 mg.
The  applicant  has  also  applied  for  an  update  of  the  SmPC  to  include  a  new  indication  for  the  new 
strength  (150  mg)  and  for  110  mg  strength:  Prevention  of  stroke  and  systemic  embolism  in  adult 
patients with atrial fibrillation.
In addition, the variations to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concern the changes to the first 
generation synthesis, and the addition of an alternate routes of synthesis. It further concerns changes 
to  the  first  generation  synthesis  related  to  the  specifications  and  suppliers  of  starting  materials  and 
intermediates,  testing  of  the  drug  substance  and  specification  of  the  same.  The  application  also 
concerns  a  new  drug  product  manufacturing method  and  further changes  related  to  manufacture, in-
process  controls,  testing,  specifications  and  shelf-life  of  the  drug  product  for  the  registered  and  the 
new 150 mg strengths. 
Finally, information addressing FUM 005, related to the development of a new in-process control at the 
isolation step, has been also presented.

2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Introduction
The  need  for  development  of  new  orally  effective  anticoagulants  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with 
chronic  atrial  fibrillation  (AF)  is  well  established.  AF  is  the  most  common  sustained  cardiac  rhythm 
disturbance.  The  prevalence  of  paroxysmal  or  persistent  AF  is  estimated  at  0.4%  of  the  general 
population, including up to 1% of all adults. The prevalence of AF increases with age. It occurs in less 
15
than 1% of those under 60 years of age but in more than 6% of those over 80 years of age. It has a 
heterogeneous  clinical  presentation.  It  can  occur  with  or  without  symptoms  and,  although  it  is  often 
associated with heart disease, AF occurs in many patients with no other detectable cardiac disease. By 
convention, the term “non-valvular AF” is restricted to cases in which the rhythm disturbance occurs in 
the  absence  of  rheumatic  mitral  stenosis  or  a  prosthetic  heart  valve.  AF  increases  the  risk  of  stroke
and death. Most of the strokes, fatal and nonfatal, associated with AF are ischemic in nature, usually a 
result of a thromboembolism with the origin in a left atrial thrombus. One of every six strokes occurs in 
patients with AF. Estimated annual incidence of stroke in the non-treated AF population ranges from 2-
5% per year in moderate risk subjects to 5-10% per year in high risk subjects. The severity of AF in 
terms of stroke and systemic embolisation rates is determined by patient risk factors. Risk factors for 
stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular AF are a history of previous stroke or TIA, 
a  history  of  hypertension,  left  ventricular  dysfunction  (LVD)  or  congestive  heart  failure  (CHF), 
advanced  age  (generally,  over  75),  diabetes  mellitus,  and  coronary  artery  disease.  Patients  without 
any  of  these  risk  factors,  i.e.,  lone  AF,  have  a  more  favourable  prognosis  with  respect  to  the 
occurrence  of  stroke,  thromboembolic  events  and  mortality.  Prevention  of  thromboembolism  is  thus 
recommended for all patients with AF, except for those with lone AF or those with contraindications (1).
The  vitamin  K  antagonists  (VKAs,  coumarins),  in  particular  warfarin,  are  the  most  widely  prescribed 
oral  anticoagulants.  In  several  adequate  and  well-controlled  trials,  warfarin  decreased  the  risk  of 
stroke/systemic thromboembolism  by  68%  versus  placebo.  This  class  of  drugs  when  used  in  patients 
with  AF  also  has  shown  to  have  a  higher  risk  of  bleeding  at  therapeutic  doses  than  ASA  alone.  VKAs 
have  a  slow  onset  and  offset  of  action,  high  inter-  and  intra-individual  variability  in  their  effective 
plasma  concentrations,  and  have  a  high  potential  for  food  and  drug  interactions.  Because  of  these 
facts,  and  the  narrow  therapeutic  window  with  this  class  of  agent,  treatment  with  VKAs  creates  a 
major  burden  for  the  health  care  systems  in  each  country.  Special  anticoagulation  clinics  for  periodic 
monitoring and adjustment of the anticoagulant dose have been established at many medical centres, 
clinics  and  physician’s  offices.  Monitoring  is  based  on  normalized  prothrombin  times  (International 
Normalized Ratio [INR]).
Dabigatran etexilate  (DE)  is  the  oral  pro-drug  of  the  active  moiety  dabigatran  (INN).  Dabigatran is  a 
potent,  synthetic,  non-peptide  competitive,  rapidly  acting  and  reversible  inhibitor  of  thrombin.  Since 
thrombin  (serine  protease)  enables  the  conversion  of  fibrinogen  into  fibrin  during  the  coagulation 
cascade, its  inhibition  prevents the  development of thrombus. Dabigatran also  inhibits  free  thrombin, 
fibrin-bound  thrombin  and  thrombin  induced  platelet  aggregation.  DE  does  not  inhibit  thrombin  or 
factor  Xa,  respectively,  demonstrating  that  the  pro-drug  does  not  possess  anticoagulant  activity.  The 
pharmacokinetic (PK) profile is characterized by peak plasma concentrations of dabigatran that occur 2 
hours after oral administration of the prodrug and a terminal elimination half-life of 12-14 hours. With 
bid  dosing  the  steady  state  is  attained  within  3  days,  and  the  maximum  concentration  in  plasma 
(Cmax)  at  steady  state  is  about  30%  higher  than  after  the  first  dose.  Dabigatran  is  eliminated 
primarily  by  the  kidneys  with  urinary  excretion  accounting  for  up  to  80  %  of  the  dose  administered 
intravenously. 
Dabigatran  etexilate  has  been  approved  in  the  EU  on  18  March  2008  for  the  indication:  “Primary 
prevention  of  venous thromboembolic  events  in  adult  patients  who  have  undergone  elective  total  hip 
replacement surgery or total knee replacement surgery“.

2.2.  Quality aspects
2.2.1.  Introduction
Pradaxa 75mg and 110 mg hard capsules have been already approved in March 2008. 
In the context of the indication extension, a new 150 mg dose strength is proposed. Pradaxa 150 mg 
hard  capsules  consist  of  an  imprinted  hydroxypropylmethylcellulose  (HMPC)  capsule  with  light  blue 
opaque cap and cream-coloured, opaque body. For 150 mg capsules, capsule size 0 are used and the 
cap is imprinted (black) with Boehringer Ingelheim company symbol and the body with “R150”.
Capsules  will  be  marketed  in  polypropylene  bottle  with  a  polypropylene/  polyethylene  screw  closure 
and in aluminium / aluminium blister strips.
In addition to the introduction of a new strength, this application concerns a large number of changes 
submitted as grouping of type IA, IB and type II changes.
17
In  particular,  it  concerns  changes  to  the  first  generation  synthesis,  and  the  addition  of  an  alternate 
routes  of  synthesis,  identified  as  the  first  generation  synthesis  and  the  second  generation  synthesis, 
abbreviated as 1st gen and 2nd gen respectively, introduced by two type II variations. Both routes of 
synthesis are proposed for commercial manufacture. 
It  further  concerns  changes  to  the  1st  gen  synthesis  related  to  the  specifications  and  suppliers  of 
starting  materials  and  intermediates,  testing  of  the  drug  substance  and  specification  of  the  same, 
introduced via a number of appropriate type II, IB and IA variations. All drug substance changes also 
apply to both the existing and the new 150 mg strengths. 
The application also concerns a new drug product manufacturing method and further changes related 
to  manufacture,  in-process  controls,  testing,  specifications  and  shelf-life  of  the  drug  product  for  the 
registered  and  the  new  150  mg  strengths  introduced  via  a  number  of  appropriate  type  II,  IB  and  IA 
variations.  Finally,  information  addressing  FUM  005,  related  to  the  development  of  a  new  in-process 
control at the isolation step, has been also presented.
A detailed table of all the changes included in this application can be found above in section 1 of this 
report.
2.2.2.  Active Substance
Dabigatran etexilate (DE) is the oral pro-drug of the active moiety dabigatran. The dabigatran etexilate 
pro-drug  was  developed  due  to  the  limited  oral  availability  of  dabigatran,  and  it  is  converted  into 
dabigatran (DAB) in vivo via esterases. The drug substance is the mesilate salt form of the pro-drug, 
called dabigatran etexilate mesilate (DEM).
The  chemical  name  (IUPAC)  of  dabigatran  etexilate  mesilate  is  ethyl  N-{[2-({[4-((E)-amino 
{[(hexyloxy)  carbonyl]  imino}  methyl)  phenyl]  amino}  methyl)-1-methyl-1H-benzimidazol-5-yl] 
carbonyl}-Npyridin-2-yl-β-alaninate  methanesulfonate  corresponding  to  the  molecular 
formula 
C34H41N7O5 x CH4O3S (C35H45N7O8S) and the structure shown below:
DEM  exhibits  polymorphism.  Two  forms,  modification  I  and  II  are  known.  The  drug  substance  is 
modification  I  in  the  anhydrous  form,  possibly  mixed  with  modification  II.  A  hydrated  form  with  a 
stoichiomety close to a hemihydrate also exists.
Manufacture
With  regard  to  the  1st  gen  manufacturing  process  already  approved,  certain  changes  related  to 
solvents and other reagent and materials used in the manufacture have been introduced by a type II 
variation. The proposed changes do not affect the quality of the active substance.
In  addition  to  the  above,  the  list  suppliers  of  two  starting  materials  has  been  updated  and the 
impurities  specification  limit  and  method  for  one  starting  materials,  the  assay  specification  and 
methods of two starting materials and specification of some intermediates have been revised. 
18
Besides  the  changes  to  the  1st  gen  manufacturing  process,  a  new  alternate  route  of  synthesis
abbreviated as 2nd gen has been presented. 
The  active  substance  is  manufactured  (2nd  gen)  in  a  number  of  synthetic  and  recrystallisation  steps 
described  in  sufficient  detail.  The  synthetic  process  results  in  isolated  and  purified  intermediates. 
Control of these intermediates is critical to guarantee drug substance of consistently high quality. The 
specifications and controls in place for the isolated intermediates as well as the proposed IPCs, ensure 
the  production  of  drug  substance  consistently  in  conformance  with  the  proposed  regulatory 
specification for commercial production. 
Discussion on impurities with genotoxic potential in the starting material is presented.
All  identified  potentially  genotoxic  compounds  are  limited  in  the  starting  material  specification  and 
spiking  experiments  demonstrate  low  probability  of  any  such  substance  in  the  drug  substance 
considering a 300mg daily dose and corresponding TTC calculated on 5ppm. Carry over possibility was 
discussed and evaluated. An extensive evaluation of the known and potential genotoxic impurities has 
been  submitted.  Based  on  the  collected  data  it  is  concluded  that  alkyl  mesilates  are  not  present  at 
release  of  the  drug  substance  at  levels  of  any  safety concern,  and  they  do  not  form  on  storage.  The 
data show that the quantitative levels of the individual potential genotoxic/genotoxic impurities in the 
drug substance are kept below the TTC level of 1.5μg/day and that the sum of the genotoxic impurities 
will most likely also be kept below the TTC due to removal or reduction in quantity during the synthesis 
process. The submitted data is considered acceptable.
So  far,  a  large  number  of  batches  of  the  2nd  gen  synthesis  have  been  manufactured.  The  drug 
substance batches, manufactured at both proposed sites, are comparable with regard to batch results 
and stability data.
Specification
A common specification is proposed for the active substance produced by either of the two methods. 
The  specifications  for  the  control  of  the  drug  substance  includes  tests  for  appearance  (visual), 
identification (IR), colour and clarity of solution (Ph.Eur.), purity and polymorphism (DSC), impurities 
(HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  heavy  metals  (Ph.Eur.),  water  content  (Ph.Eur.),  sulphated  ash 
(Ph.Eur.), assay (HPLC and titration), particle size (Laser-beam diffraction).
Based  on  drug  substance  batch  experience  and  manufacturability  aspects  of  the  drug  substance  a 
widening  of  the  polymorphism  limit  and  widening  of  particle  size  distribution  range  were  introduced. 
Drug product manufacturability has also been demonstrated following the changes. 
Dissolution data and clinical batch experience showed that any variation in particle size within the new 
proposed range should have no impact on drug product dissolution. Furthermore, the widening of the 
polymorphism specification is supported by an in vivo bioequivalence study (1160.66). 
Also, minor changes to the assay titration method, to the HPLC method for testing related substances, 
to  the  GC  method  for  residual  solvents,  to  the  particle  size  method  and  to  the  methods  for  heavy 
metal, water content and sulphated ash have been made. The impurities limit has been tightened.  
Finally,  minor  changes  to  the  information  related  to  the  reference  standard  materials  used  for  the 
control of active substance have been introduced and descriptions of the methods used for the testing 
of immediate packaging of the active substance have been provided.
The  quality  of  drug  substance  produced  either  according  to  the  1st  gen  synthesis  or  to  the  2nd  gen 
synthesis is considered equivalent and that is supported by equivalent specifications for both. There is 
only one difference in the impurity profile as one impurity occurs in the 1st gen synthesis but cannot be 
19
formed in the 2nd gen synthesis. Both processes guarantee a uniform particle size distribution (PSD) of 
the final active substance independent of the route of synthesis. Mean PSD is same for both synthesis 
routes.
Stability
Stability  data  for  three  production-scale  primary  stability  batches  manufactured  at  the  proposed 
commercial  site  by  the  1st  generation  includes  24  months  long-term  data  obtained  at  25°C/60%  RH 
and  6  months  accelerated  data  obtained  at  40°C/75%  RH.  These  batches  are  representative  of  the 
commercial drug substance. The stability samples were packaged in a container/closure system which 
mimics the one which will be used for the commercial drug substance.
Both  at  long  term  and  accelerated  conditions  no  changes  in  tested  parameters  were  observed  apart 
from  an  increase  in  one  degradation  impurity  and  total  impurities.  From  the  statistical  evaluation  on 
the long term stability results it was concluded that results would comply also after 24 months storage.
Stability  data  for  six  production-scale  primary  stability  batches  manufactured  at  the  proposed 
commercial  sites  by  the  2nd  generation  includes  data  up  to  24  months  long-term  and  6  months 
accelerated. These batches are representative of the commercial drug substance. The stability samples 
were  packaged  in  a  container/closure  system  which  mimics  the  one  which  will  be  used  for  the 
commercial drug substance.
Both  at  long  term  and  accelerated  conditions  no  changes  in  tested  parameters  were  observed  apart 
from  an  increase  in  one  degradation  impurity  and  total  impurities.  From  the  statistical  evaluation  on 
the long term stability results it was concluded that results would comply also after 24 months storage. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product
Pharmaceutical Development
The  new  150  mg  strength  is  directly  proportional  to  the  two  authorised  strengths.  As  already 
mentioned  above  data  (including  bioequivalence  study  1160.66)  have  been  presented  to  support  a 
higher content of modification II in drug substance and finished product.
Stability  data  show  that  no  conversion  of  modification  I  into  modification  II  occurs  in  bulk  drug 
substance as well as in drug product during storage. The solubility of the two modifications in aqueous 
media at a variety of pHs is not significantly different, and the in vitro dissolution of the drug products 
of the two modifications is similar.
The  particle  size  distribution  of  the  drug  substance  can  potentially  impact  the  manufacturing  process 
and drug product dissolution. 
It  has  been  shown  that  the  difference  in  drug  substance  particle  size  has  no  impact  on  the  in  vitro 
dissolution behaviour of capsules. The drug product manufacturability has been demonstrated for both 
the 1st gen and the 2nd gen processes over a range of drug substance particle sizes. The current drug 
substance  quality  produced  according  to  the  current  1st  gen  and  2nd  gen  routes  of  synthesis  is 
controlled  to  tight  particle  size  upper  limits  to  ensure  suitable  drug  product  manufacturing  yield. 
Dissolution data and clinical batch experience show that any particle size variation within this range of 
quality should have no impact on the drug product dissolution.
The  dissolution  behaviour  of  HPMC  capsules  with  different  dosage  strengths  and  capsule  sizes  was 
tested to guarantee identical dissolution characteristics independent of the dosage strength and of the 
20
capsule  size.    The  dissolution  characteristics  of  the  HPMC  capsules  are  all  comparable  and  show  no 
significant differences concerning dosage strength and capsule size.
Finally a new pack size for 110 mg capsules has been introduced.
Adventitious agents
No excipients of human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of Pradaxa 150 mg capsules.
Manufacture of the product
The new 150 mg strength is manufactured by the same manufacturing process as the existing 75 and 
110 mg strengths.
However, this common manufacturing process compared with the process originally approved (referred 
to as 1st gen DP) has been modified (referred to as 2nd gen DP). Comparative dissolution profiles over a 
range  of  pH  were  provided  as  well  as  comparative  release  and  stability  data  for  the  main  changes 
during development. Comparative batch data bridging the main changes were also presented.
Minor  changes  in  relation  to  the  manufacture  of  pellets  have  been  introduced.  The  pellets  are  drug 
product  intermediates  manufactured  by  routine  production.  The  holding  times  for  the  above  types  of 
pellets have also been re-established.
Due to introduction of 2nd gen DP manufacturing process the batch size is increased. 
The applied in-process controls (IPCs) for the drug product intermediates and packaging of the finished 
product have been revised in accordance with new manufacturing process, by deleting non significant 
tests, tightening limits, changing the methods used or adding alternate ones.
New information on development of a new in-process control at the isolation step in order to fulfil the 
EMEA/H/C/829 FUM 005, which is considered fulfilled by the data presented.
With regard to the manufacturing sites involved, a manufacturing site has been deleted and a new one 
has  been  introduced,  two  new  sites  for  secondary  packaging  have  also  been  introduced  and  site  for 
drug product testing has been added.
For  the  2nd  gen  DP  process, process  evaluation was  successfully carried  out  on  three  pilot  batches  of 
each strength of Pradaxa capsules.
Product specification
The  Pradaxa  150  mg  capsules  specification  for  batch  release  and  shelf-life  is  in  line  with  the  already 
authorised  strengths  and  includes  the  following  tests:  appearance  (visual),  loss  on  drying  for  pellets 
(gravimetry), loss on drying for capsule shell (gravimetry), identification (HPLC, UV- at release only), 
active ingredient content (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.-at 
release only), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.). 
Compared  with  the  specification  initially  approved,  the  related  substances  shelf-life  limits  have  been 
tightened  for  two  impurities  for  capsules  in  blister.  The  limit  for  loss  on  drying  (LOD)  of  pellets  and 
capsule shell at release and shelf-life has also been tightened. Minor changes to the approved LOD test 
procedure  for  pellets  and  capsules,  to  the  HPLC  method  for  ID,  active  ingredient  content  and  active 
ingredient degradation and to the dissolution test procedure for 75 mg and 110 mg capsules have been 
made. New batch analysis data from new batches of reference standards have been also included.
21
Sufficient  justification  for  applying  no  testing  requirement  of  polymorphism  and  for  alkyl 
methanesulfonate  in  the  release  specification  has  been  provided  (see  discussion  above  on 
pharmaceutical development and manufacture of active substance).
Count  method,  weighing  and  visual  test  method  descriptions)  always  used  for  the  lidding  foil  were 
submitted, together with method descriptions  for the LOD and weighing tests used for the screw cap.
Results  from  the  2nd  gen  DP  process  are  presented  on  seven  batches  for  the  75  mg  strength,  on  six 
batches  for  the  110  mg  strength  and  on  seven  batches  for  the  150  mg  strength.  The  results  of  all 
batches comply with the specification and confirm consistency of the product.
Stability of the product
Three batches of each strength have been stored at 25ºC/60% RH for 12 months and at 40ºC/75% RH 
for 6 months in the proposed market blister and bottle packaging. 
No significant changes are observed at long term or accelerated condition for any strength in blister or 
in bottle. At long term condition no clear trend over 12 months was observed, apart from very minor 
changes for LOD (capsule shells) one degradation product and total degradation products at long term 
conditions and slightly higher at accelerated condition. 
Statistical  evaluation  on  stability  data  was  presented  and  showed  that  results  are  likely  to  be  within 
specification after the proposed 24 months storage in blister and bottle.
Photostability
Pradaxa  was  found  photostable.  There  were  no  differences between  the  directly  exposed  sample  and 
the dark control.
In-use stability
The in-use stability was tested over 30 days and the studies were performed at 25°C/60% RH on one 
primary stability batch of Pradaxa of each strength  that had been previously stored for 12 months at 
25°C/60% RH storage condition. The results of in-use stability study indicated that the desiccant in the 
cap of the polypropylene bottle was still active after the 30 days in-use period.
Stress stability studies
After open storage at 60°C/- for up to 85 days there was a decrease in the loss on drying values for 
pellets and capsule shells, and simultaneously only a slight increase in the degradation product levels.
Following  the  changes  in  the  manufacture  of  the  active  substance  and  the  finished  product  and 
because  of  the  limited  stability  data  available  the  shelf-life  on  Pradaxa  batches  manufactured  by  the 
2nd gen DP manufacturing process using active substance from the new method (2nd gen) of synthesis 
the shelf-life of Pradaxa capsules has been reduced without changes in the storage conditions.
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects
The  quality  information  of  Pradaxa  covering  the  active  substance  and  the  whole  range  of  capsule 
strength has been substantially updated by a number of appropriate variations submitted as grouping 
together with the extension application for the addition of a  new strength on 150 mg. All the applied 
changes have been accepted apart from one referring to the widening of limits for active degradation 
limits  in  the  specification  of  75  mg  and  110  mg  finished  product  in  PP  bottles  submitted  as  type  II 
variation. The reason for rejecting this variation was that based on batch results and stability results in 
22
both packaging materials the proposed changes in shelf-life limits of some related substances are not 
justified from the presented data on 3 strengths manufactured according to the 2nd gen DP process.
The  quality  of  Pradaxa  is  considered  to  be  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the  conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The quality of the active substance is considered sufficiently 
described  and  adequately  supported  by  data.  Sufficient  chemical  and  pharmaceutical  documentation 
relating to development, manufacture and control of the drug product has been presented.
Satisfactory information with regard to FUM 005 was also presented. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The  updated  quality  information  of  Pradaxa  including  the  results  of  tests  carried  out  and  the 
specification  set  for  the  dabigatran  active  substance  and  Pradaxa  capsules  indicate  satisfactory 
consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
Stability  tests  indicate  that  the  product  under  ICH  guidelines  conditions  is  chemically  stable  for  the 
proposed shelf life. FUM 005 is considered fulfilled.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology
Dabigatran etexilate mesilate (DEM) is the oral pro-drug of the active moiety dabigatran. Dabigatran is 
a potent, synthetic, non-peptide competitive, rapidly acting and reversible inhibitor of thrombin.  Since 
thrombin enables the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin during the coagulation cascade, its inhibition 
prevents the development of thrombus. Dabigatran also inhibits free thrombin, fibrin-bound thrombin 
and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. As a follow up on previous concerns the applicant provided 
experimental  documentation  for  competitive  inhibition  of  thrombin.  Furthermore  Dabigatran  is 
demonstrated to be equipotent for inhibiting free or clot bound thrombin.  
Comprehensive  experimental  documentation  for  the  off-target  binding  abilities  of  both  DEM  and 
Dabigatran  showed  that  only  DEM  exhibits  minor  unspecific  binding  in  this  binding  screen  at 
concentrations  50-60-fold  in  excess  of  relevant  concentrations  in  humans.  A  bleeding  time  study  in 
23
rats  treated  with  supratherapeutic  doses  showed  that  the  activated  factor  VII  or  activated 
prothrombinase complex would be relevant unspecific antidotes in case of bleeding episodes in man. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics
Absorption and Distribution
No further data was submitted and this was considered acceptable by the CHMP.
Metabolism
The  glucuronidation  of  dabigatran  was  investigated  in  vitro  by  using  human  liver  or  intestinal 
microsomes or expressed UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UDP = Uridine-Diphosphate). This indicated a 
much  lower  capacity  of  the  intestine  compared  to  the  liver  for  the  glucuronidation  of  dabigatran. 
Incubation with a broad range of UGT enzymes indicated that UTG 2B15 exhibited the highest activity 
for the glucuronidation of dabigatran. Additional data on the specific glucuronidation of dabigatran was 
obtained  through  co-incubation  with  several  non-specific  inhibitors  indicating  the  contribution  to  the 
glucuronidation  of  dabigatran  by  UGT1A9,  UGT2B7  and  UGT2B15.  It  was  concluded  that  dabigatran 
was  a  non-specific,  low-affinity  substrate  of  UGT1A9,  UGT2B7  and  UGT2B15;  the  latter  UGT  was 
probably the major catalyst for the formation of the 1-O-acylglucuronide.
Pharmacokinetic drug interaction
In vitro studies in P-gp-expressing Lewis-lung cancer porcine kidney 1 cells indicated that dabigatran 
etexilate  mesilate  was  a  substrate  of  P-gp,  and  dabigatran  was  not  a  substrate  of  P-gp.  DEM  was 
considered to be a low-to-medium-affinity substrate of P-gp with an estimated Km value of above 10 
µM.  Different  interaction/inhibition  studies  in  P-gp-expressing  cells,  using  digoxin,  amiodarone, 
clarithromycin,  itraconazole,  quinidine  and  ritonavir  as  probe  substrates  showed  that  the  potential  of 
DEM  and  dabigatran  to  inhibit  P-gp  activity  was  minimal  indicating  that  neither  DEM  nor  dabigatran 
would  influence the  biliary  excretion, urinary  secretion  or  tissue  distribution  of  co-administered  drugs 
that  are  substrates  of  P-gp.  Some  inhibitory  effects  on  DEM  transport  were  observed  and 
consequently, drug-drug interactions based on the inhibition of P-gp-mediated DEM could not be ruled 
out  if  the  concentrations  of  these  P-gp  modulators  at  the  interaction  sites  reach  or  exceed  the  IC50 
values estimated in this study (0.5 to 75 µM). However, due to high intrinsic passive permeability DEM 
is  expected  to  be  well  absorbed  in  humans  even  during  co  administration  of  potent  P-gp  substrate 
inhibitors.
Other pharmacokinetic studies
A comparative PK study was conducted in male and female mice of two different strains (Crl:NMRI and 
CrllCR:CD1)  following  a  single  oral  administration  of  DEM.  The  objectives  of  the  study  were  to 
investigate  possible  differences  between  these  two  mouse  strains  concerning  the  PK  behaviour  of 
dabigatran and to examine the extent of circulating conjugates of dabigatran. Although a slight gender 
effect was observed in mice similar glucuronidation of dabigatran was recorded in NMRI and CD1 mice, 
in accordance with previous data on metabolite pattern in NMRI mice showing non-quantifiable traces 
of acyl-glucuronides of dabigatran. No significant gender related differences in pharmacokinetics were 
seen in rats and monkeys.

No further data submitted. This was considered acceptable due to comprehensive existing data and the 
extensive clinical use
Genotoxicity
The  additional  mouse  lymphoma  assay  confirmed  previous  data  that  dabigatran  did  not  induce  any 
increase of mutants cells.
Carcinogenicity
Oral  administration  of  DEM  at  dosages  of  30,  100  or  200  mg/kg  to  CD-1  mice  for  up  to  104  weeks 
revealed no evidence of a carcinogenic potential. The findings in this study were generally associated 
with an impeded clotting mechanism. Oral administration of DEM at dosages of 30, 100 or 200 mg/kg 
to Han Wistar rats for 104 weeks revealed no evidence of a carcinogenic potential. Increased mortality 
and  a  variety  of  other  changes  associated  with  an  impeded  clotting  mechanism  were  observed  at  all 
dose  levels,  and  non-neoplastic  findings  considered  to  be  related  to  exaggerated  pharmacology  were 
seen in the prostate, ovaries, lungs, mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes, paws and skin.
Phototoxicity
The phototoxic potential of DEM has been evaluated in the 3T3 NRU assay using BALB/c 3T3 cells, and 
it  was  concluded  that  dabigatran  may  have  a  weak  phototoxic  potential  under  in  vitro  conditions  at 
concentrations of 15.63 µg/mL. The mean maximum plasma level (likely comparable to skin level) of 
dabigatran  in  humans  after  administration  of  400  mg  dabigatran  etexilate  was  291 ng/mL, 
approximately  50-fold  lower  than  the  concentration  of  15.63 µg/mL.  A  review  of  the  clinical  safety 
database  for  possible  evidence  of  a  clinical  signal,  however,  did  not  show  evidence  for  a  phototoxic 
effect  in  clinical  trial  data  from  over  8500  patients  exposed  to  dabigatran  (over  950  patient  years  of 
exposure)  in  completed  clinical  trials.  Therefore,  it  was  concluded  that  dabigatran  does  not  have  a 
phototoxic potential under in vivo conditions in man.
Impurities toxicity
The  MAH  submitted  an  extensive  evaluation  of  the  impurity  profile.  The  MAH  stated  that  a  safety 
assessment had been performed for all known genotoxins and for impurities with structural alerts for 
genotoxicity identified using appropriate software (i.e., DEREK and MCASE).
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment
The  environmental  risk  assessment  based  upon  the  extended  indications  and  the  maximum  dose  of 
300 mg showed that it is unlikely that dabigatran will cause environmental risk.
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects
The  additional  mouse  lymphoma  assay  confirmed  previous  data  that  dabigatran  did  not  induce  any 
increase  of  mutants  cells.  Oral  administration  of  DEM  at  dosages  of  30,  100  or  200  mg/kg  to  CD-1 
mice  or  Han  Wistar  rats  for  up  to  104  weeks  revealed  no  evidence  of  a  carcinogenic  potential.  The 
findings  were  generally  associated  with  an  impeded  clotting  mechanism.  The  phototoxic  potential  of 
DEM  was  evaluated  in  the  3T3  NRU  assay  using  BALB/c  3T3  cells,  and  it  may  be  concluded  that 
dabigatran may have a weak phototoxic potential under in vitro conditions at concentrations of 15.63 
µg/mL. A review of the clinical safety database for possible evidence of a clinical signal, however, did 
not  show  evidence  for  a  phototoxic  effect  in  clinical  trial  data  from  over  8500  patients  exposed  to 
dabigatran  (over  950  patient  years  of  exposure)  in  completed  clinical  trials.  Therefore,  it  was 
concluded  that  dabigatran  does  not  have  a  phototoxic  potential  under  in  vivo  conditions  in  man.  The 
25
impurities  and  degradation  products  BIBR  951,  BIBR  1087,  BIBR  1150,  BIBR  1154,  BIBR  1155  and 
CDBA  513  are  considered  qualified  up  to  the  specified  limits.  It  is  unlikely  that  dabigatran  use  will 
result in an environmental risk.
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects
New  non-clinical  studies  were  submitted  for: primary  pharmacodynamics,  safety  pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology.  Non-clinical  data  reveal  no  special  hazard  for  humans  based  on 
conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. Effects observed 
and assessed within initial marketing authorisation application in the repeat-dose toxicity studies were 
due  to  the  exaggerated  pharmacodynamic  effect  of  dabigatran.  An  effect  on  female  fertility  was 
observed  in  the  form  of  a  decrease  in  implantations  and  an  increase  in  pre-implantation  loss  at 
70 mg/kg (5-fold the plasma exposure level in patients). At doses that were toxic to the mothers (5 to 
10-fold  the  plasma  exposure  level  in  patients),  a  decrease  in  foetal  body  weight  and  viability  along 
with  an  increase  in  foetal  variations  were  observed  in  rats  and  rabbits.  In  the  pre-  and  post-natal 
study,  an  increase  in  foetal  mortality  was  observed  at  doses  that  were  toxic  to  the  dams  (a  dose 
corresponding  to  a  plasma  exposure  level  4-fold  higher  than  observed  in  patients).  In  conclusion, 
following  the  assessment  of  the  nonclinical  data  submitted  with  this  application  Section  5.3  of  the 
SmPC was updated with the information that in lifetime toxicology studies in rats and mice, there was 
no evidence for a tumorigenic potential of dabigatran up to maximum doses of 200 mg/kg.
2.4.  Clinical aspects
2.4.1.  Introduction
The MAH applied for the following indication for 110 and 150 mg strengths: 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with atrial fibrillation.
The following indication was granted for 110 and 150 mg strengths:
Prevention  of  stroke  and  systemic  embolism  in  adult  patients  with  nonvalvular  atrial  fibrillation  with 
one  or  more  of  the  following  risk  factors:  Previous  stroke,  transient  ischemic  attack,  or  systemic 
embolism  (SEE);  left  ventricular  ejection  fraction  <  40  %;  Symptomatic  heart  failure,  ≥  New  York 
Heart  Association  (NYHA)  Class  2;  Age  ≥  75  years;  Age  ≥  65  years  associated  with  one  of  the 
following: diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, or hypertension.
The new indication is mainly supported by one pivotal trial enrolling 18113 patients: the RE-LY study, a 
Randomized Evaluation of Long term anticoagulant therapy (RE-LY) comparing the efficacy and safety 
of two blinded doses of dabigatran etexilate with open label warfarin for the prevention of stroke and 
systemic  embolism  in  patients  with  non-valvular  atrial  fibrillation:  a  prospective,  parallel-group,  non-
inferiority trial.
In  addition  for  this  grouped  application  the  MAH  has  submitted  3  bioequivalence  and  8  new  drug 
interaction studies and 2 dose response studies (PETRO and PETRO-EX).
GCP
The  clinical  trials  were  performed  in  accordance  with  GCP  as  claimed  by  the  MAH.  The  MAH  has 
provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out 
in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
26
An inspection of the RELY study was requested by the EMA. The GCP inspection was triggered at D120 
of the procedure motivated by inconsistencies observed by the FDA in the transfer of  INR data   from 
case record forms to company data sets in the RELY study in addition to the fact that the application is 
primarily  based  on  one,  single  pivotal  study,  the  RE-LY  study.  Four  inspections  were  performed  from 
16th  August  to  16th  September:  the  Sponsor,  the  CRO  (Population  Health  Research  Institute  (PHRI)) 
and  2  investigator  sites  (in  the  US  and  Greece).  Two  critical  findings  were  identified  during  the 
inspection of the sponsor relating to 1) lack of proper oversight and documentation when implementing 
edit  checks  to  the  trial  database  at  the  CRO  PHRI  and  2)  critical  trial  management  due  to  poor 
oversight of delegated task, study kick-off and use of unapproved documents. Two critical finding were 
identified during the inspection of the Greek investigator site 901 relating to 1) gaps of more than the 
pre-specified  4  weeks  between  two  consecutive  INR  measurements  and  2)  inclusion  of  one  subject 
with  a  violation  of  an  exclusion  criterion  (CrCI < 30ml/min),  potentially  putting  him  at  unnecessary 
risk.  In  addition,  at  the  Greek  site  a  major  finding  related  to  transcription  errors for  INR-control  was 
identified for 5 out of approximately 50 patients. From a clinical point of view, the Greek findings had 
the potential to disfavour warfarin vs. DE. The MAH was asked for further clarifications. On D180 the 
CHMP considered the quality of INR control in the RELY study questionable due to transcription errors 
leading  to  inclusion  of  patients  in  the  analyses  as  having  INR-values  “in  therapeutic  range”  despite 
being  in  fact  “below  therapeutic  range”  (below  2-3).  In  the  response  to  the  D180  LoOIs  data  were 
provided to reassure the CHMP on the quality of the INR-control in the RE-LY study: the transcription 
errors  identified  at  the  Greek  site  901  did  not  affect  the  source  data.  Thus,  warfarin  treatment 
adjustments were not based on wrong INR values. The transcription errors were therefore not believed 
to have had impact on the primary efficacy- and safety endpoints. However, it was felt that the MAH 
had not adequately addressed the issue of INR transcription errors in patients on warfarin experiencing 
major events. Therefore, the MAH was requested to provide a review of the chain of INR transcriptions 
(source  –  CRFs  –  clinical  database)  in  all  warfarin  treated  subjects  who  experienced  thromboembolic 
events, myocardial infarction, and intracranial haemorrhage as quality of the INR control in RELY study 
may not have been as good as reported by investigators. At the end the CHMP was of the opinion that 
the  level  of  severity  of  the  identified  Greek  findings  was  not  expected  to  impact  the  overall  study 
results  and  that  the  issue  of  INR  transcriptions  from  source  (CRFs)  to  the  clinical  database  had  been 
adequately addressed by the MAH.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics
Main Pharmacokinetic data (from initial marketing authorisation application)
Dabigatran  etexilate  (DE)  has  a  low  solubility  in  water  and  a  high  permeability.  The  absolute 
bioavailability of DE was low i.e 5-8 %. The administration of DE with a high fat high caloric breakfast 
resulted in a slight increase in  Cmax (8%) and in a moderate increase in AUC (27%). Food was also 
shown  to  slow  the  rate  of  absorption  (approximately  2  hours  delay).  After  oral  administration  of  DE, 
7.3%  and  85.5%  (total  91.3%) of  the  dose  were  recovered in  the  urine  and  the  faeces  over  7  days, 
respectively.  The  mean  terminal  half-life  of  dabigatran  was  approximately  9-11  hours.  The  renal 
clearance  (≈  90  ml/min)  accounts  for  about  82%  of  its  total  clearance  (110  ml/min)  following  an  IV 
infusion of dabigatran. 
Bioequivalence study 1160.66 
DEM exhibits polymorphism (modifications I and  II). Bioequivalence had been demonstrated between 
drug product batches manufactured with pure form I drug substance and pure form II drug substance. 
Therefore,  drug  substance  batches  were  considered  comparable  whatever  the  route  of  synthesis  and 
the composition in modification I and II. 
Bioequivalence study 1160.70
The solubility of the compound was shown to be significantly pH dependent with increased solubility at 
acidic  pH,  and  limited  solubility  at  alkaline  pH  values.  Active  ingredient  layered  pellets  including  a 
tartaric acid core as a solubilizer filled into hard capsules were developed as the final clinical trial and 
29
commercial  dosage  form.  Bioequivalence  was  also  demonstrated  between  the  product  used  in  the 
clinical studies and the future commercial product.
Bioavailibility study 1160.87
The integrity of the HPMC capsules should always be preserved in clinical use to avoid unintentionally 
increased  bioavailability  of  DE.  Therefore,  patients  are  advised  not  chewing  the  capsules  before 
swallowing and also not to open the capsules and taking the pellets alone (e.g. sprinkled over food or 
into beverages). Adequate recommendations were proposed in the SmPC. 
Dose and time dependency 
Dabigatran  Cmax  and  AUC  increased  linearly  with  dose  from  10  to  400  mg.  Analysis  of  dabigatran 
trough  plasma  concentrations  indicated  that  steady  state  conditions  were  attained  on  Day  2  post-
administration.  Dabigatran  displayed  moderate  accumulation.  The  accumulation  ratios  for  AUCss  and 
Cmax ss were about 1.8 – 1.5. 
Variability
In healthy volunteers, the intraindividual variability was close to 36-39% for Cmax and AUC. In healthy 
volunteer, the interindividual variabilility of Cmax and AUC was much higher in single dose studies (62-
72%) than in multiple dose administration (19-26%). 
Target population
Several covariates were found to have a relevant effect on dabigatran pharmacokinetics in AF patients: 
CrCL, age, sex, weight, indicationand co-medications with Pg-p inhibitors,PPIs and antacids. 
Special populations
After  single  dose  administration,  the  exposure  of  dabigatran  increased  about  3-fold  in  subjects  with 
moderate  renal  impairment.  Haemodialysis  effectively  eliminates  dabigatran  from  blood.  Moderate 
hepatic  impairment  decreases  Cmax  (30%  decrease)  but  does  not  affect  AUC.  The  effect  of  severe 
hepatic  impairment  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  dabigatran  is  not  known.  There  is  a  marked  gender 
difference in the pharmacokinetics of dabigatran. In female patients, CL/F was lower (12.5%) than in 
male  patients.  This  decrease  in  CL/F  resulted  in  14%  higher  steady-state  exposure  (AUCτ,ss)  of  
female  patients  compared  to  male  patients.  All  the  results  suggest  that  ethnicity  is  not  a  factor 
influencing  meaningfully  the  pharmacokinetics  of  dabigatran.  A  trend  towards  increasing  dabigatran 
exposure  with  decreasing  weight  was  observed  in  male  and  female  patients.  An  across  study 
comparison and the population PK analysis indicate that there was a trend toward increasing exposure 
with increasing age likely to be due to age related decrease in creatinine clearance. 
Drug-drug interactions 
In view of its pharmacokinetic profile, dabigatran does not seem to induce, inhibit or be a substrate of 
the CYP450 enzyme system. In vitro studies have proven that interactions with usual hepatic CYP450
isoenzymes are unlikely.
P-gp inhibitors
Results of the newly provided studies add new information about the influence of P-gp inhibitors on the 
exposure of dabigatran. Some P-gp inhibitors are contra-indicated (e.g. ketoconazole) whereas the use 
of  others  like  verapamil,  amiodarone,  quinidine  and  clarithromycin  should  lead  to  precautionary 
measures.  Using  pharmacokinetic  and  clinical  outcome  data  from  the  RELY  study,  the  MAH had  
convincingly argued that the dabigatran dose should be reduced in case of concomitant treatment with 
verapamil,  but  not  with  amiodarone  or  quinidine.  The  MAH  was  also  asked  to  address  the  dose 
30
recommendations  with  regard to  concomitant  treatment with  verapamil  or  amiodarone and  moderate 
renal impairment. Although the number of events from the RE-LY study was small, it is justified in the 
opinion of the CHMP not recommending further dose reduction in case of concomitant treatment with 
verapamil, amiodarone or quinidine in patients with moderate renal impairment. The MAH’s reasoning 
for not contraindicating treatment with cyclosporine, itraconazole and tacrolimus was not agreed with, 
and the MAH’s accepted to include treatment with these drugs as a contraindication.
P-gp inducers
The  provided  study  with  rifampicine,  given  as  a  P-gp  inducer,  shows  that  dabigatran  exposure  is 
importantly reduced. The combination with strong P-gp inducers such as rifampicine or St John’s wort 
should be avoided.
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics
Dabigatran  etexilate  (DE)  is  a  reversible  inhibitor  of  thrombin  (direct  thrombin  inhibitor  [DTI])  of 
relatively  low  affinity.  As  for  all  anticoagulant  therapies,  its  anti-thrombotic  effect  is  counterbalanced 
by  an  increased  haemorrhagic  risk.  The  effects  of  dabigatran  were  assessed  using  coagulation  tests 
(Figure 1).

Anticoagulation measurement is necessary to assess the level of anticoagulation of patients: 
1/ In the RELY study. 
Considering  the  high  dose  recommended  in  the  claimed  indication,  the  aPTT  was  inappropriate  to 
assess the relation between pharmacological and clinical effects in the RELY study. Diluted TT and ECT 
were  considered  as  the  most  appropriate  tests  for  measurement  of  dabigatran  effect.  Indeed,  both 
31
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tests displayed a linear relationship with plasma concentrations over the  full  range of concentrations, 
with a high level of sensitivity. 
2/  In  real  life,  only  when  judged  necessary  by  physicians  (depending  on  patients  characteristics  or 
patients responses to dabigatran). 
Measurement  of  anticoagulant  effect  is  particularly  warranted  when  an  overdosing  is  suspected. 
Indeed,  assessment of  exposure/safety relationship  highlighted  a  clear  association  of  longer  aPTT  (at 
trough)  and  the  occurrence  of  major  and  any  bleeding  events.  Considering  the  increased  drug 
exposure  in  special  populations  and  situations  such  as  overdose,  patients  with  moderate  renal 
impairment,  elderly,  females  and  patients  with  low  weight,  informative  coagulation  tests  should  be 
available. The HYPHEN test, with dabigatran plasma calibrator and control, achieved the CE mark and 
is now commercially available. Relevant sections of the SmPC have been updated with this information.
PK/PD drug interactions
Despite  relatively  reassuring  PK/PD  studies,  adequate  warnings  were  added  in  the  SmPC  as  regards 
the increased haemorrhagic risk when dabigatran is combined with any drug acting on the coagulation 
system (e.g. enoxaparin, ASA, clopidogrel). Such combinations are not rare when considering the need 
to treat coronary artery diseases.  
Secondary pharmacology
Potential adverse events such as myocardial infarction and hepatic adverse events, identified in during 
initial marketing authorisation application as potential secondary adverse events, have been assessed 
below in Section Clinical Safety.
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
PK  characteristics  of  dabigatran  display  some  advantages  compared  to  warfarin:  lower  terminal  half-
life (9-11 hours), lower intra and inter individual variability, no drug interaction with CYP450 enzyme 
system, no interaction with food. However, exposure may be increased principally with impaired renal 
function,  age  and  co-medication  with  P-gp-inhibitors,  which  leads  potentially  to  increased  risk  of 
bleeding in these situations. Furthermore, contrary to VKAs, there is no antidote to dabigatran. Some 
drug-drug  interactions  have  been  highlighted  with  P-gp  inhibitors.  Indeed,  dabigatran  exposure 
appears  to  be  increased  with  amiodarone,  quinidine  and  verapamil.  Based  on  further  analyses  of  the 
RELY study, the MAH had convincingly argued in favour recommending dose reduction of dabigatran in 
case  of  concomitant  treatment  with  verapamil,  but  not  with  amiodarone  or  quinidine.    Also,  the 
proposal of not recommending further dose adjustments in patients with moderate renal impairment in 
case  of  concomitant  treatment  with  the  aforementioned  P-gp  inhibitors  (other  than  the  one  already 
mentioned  in  case  of  co-treatment  with  verapamil)  was  considered  by  the  CHMP  acceptable.  The 
wording  of  the  SmPC  includes  contraindications  against  the  concomitant  use  of  the  strong  P-gp 
inhibitors  itraconazole,  tacrolimus,  and  cyclosporine  along  with  ketoconazole  as  requested  by  the 
CHMP.  Regarding  P-gp  inducers,  study  with  rifampicine  showed  that  dabigatran  exposure  was 
importantly  reduced.  Such  combination  should  therefore  be  avoided.  Pharmacodynamic  interactions 
when  DE  is  combined  with  other  antithrombotic  agents  should  also  be  of  concern.  Follow  up  of  such 
bitherapies  (clopidogrel  +  dabigatran  or  AAS  +  dabigatran)  and  tritherapy  (clopidogrel  +  AAS  + 
dabigatran)  by  prescribers  is  of  relevance  as  an  increased  risk  of  bleeding  cannot  be  eliminated  in 
some patients. No dose adjustment had been judged necessary but a warning related to the bleeding 
risk was also added in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Dabigatran is a reversible inhibitor of thrombin (direct 
thrombin inhibitor [DTI]) of relatively low affinity. As for all anticoagulant therapies, its anti-thrombotic 
effect  is  counterbalanced  by  an  increased  haemorrhagic  risk.  Anticoagulation  measurement has  been 
32
requested at the time of the initial marketing authorisation application: (1) to better assess the drug 
during  its  clinical  development,  (2)  to  provide  tools  to  manage  patients  in  real  life  in  situations  of 
increased  bleeding  risks,  when  event  is  observed  or  when  it  is  foreseen  to  occur  (drug  interactions, 
overdoses,  surgery,  special  populations).  In  the  context  of  the  claimed  indication,  the  availability  of 
such test is of importance. Indeed, in specific situations known to be associated with a higher risk of 
bleeding (e.g. overdose), such test could become necessary. The MAH initially proposed aPTT for such 
monitoring. aPTT was not considered the most appropriate test as values were not linearly correlated 
to  concentrations.  Appropriate  test  should  display  a  linear  relationship  with  plasma  concentrations, 
with  a  high  level  of  sensitivity,  such  as  ECT  or  diluted  TT,  but  should  also  be  normalised  in  order  to 
allow  comparisons  between  laboratories. The  MAH  demonstrated  that  an  association  between  high 
anticoagulation activity, represented as greater ECT or TT levels, and the occurrence of major or any 
bleeding  events  exists.  In  contrast,  no  relationship  to  either  ECT  or  TT  became  obvious  for  efficacy 
related  events  such  as  the  occurrence  of  stroke/SEE  (primary  endpoint)  or  secondary  composite 
endpoints. Therefore, anticoagulation tests can only be used to define the theoretical risk of bleeding 
at a certain PD measure, but not to define a therapeutic range for the prevention of stroke. These tests 
can be used to decrease the dose in case of increased exposure but never to increase the dose in case 
of  lower  exposure.  The  MAH  identified  dabigatran  concentrations  not  to  be  exceeded  because  of  the 
increased risk of bleeding or in some special situations such as pre-surgical situations. The 200 ng/mL 
concentration is the value at trough (10-16 hours after the previous dose), not to be exceeded because 
of the increased risk of bleeding. Dabigatran concentration under 48 ng/mL is equivalent to elimination 
of at least 75% of dabigatran and should be recommended before special intervention such as surgery. 
The  Hemoclot  assay  is  a  diluted  thrombin  time  (TT)  coagulation  assay  which  can  be  calibrated  with 
lyophilised  dabigatran  standards  for  quantitative  assessment  of  dabigatran  concentrations  in  plasma. 
The MAH has established cooperation with the manufacturer, HYPHEN BioMed. The HYPHEN test, with 
dabigatran plasma calibrator and control, achieved the CE mark and is now commercially available.
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
The CHMP was of the opinion that all the issues regarding clinical pharmacology were positively solved. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies
Dose-response  was  evaluated  in  the  PETRO  study  (1160.20)  and  the  5  years  extension  study  to 
PETRO, PETRO-EX (1160.42). 
PETRO study (1160.20)
The PETRO study was a 12 week randomised, parallel group, double-blind (for DE), open-label (for ASA 
and  for  warfarin)  trial.  It  was  a  three-by-three  factorial  study  design,  testing  3  doses  of  DE,  either 
alone (no ASA) or in combination with one of two different doses of ASA. In addition, a tenth treatment 
group of warfarin alone was chosen as reference treatment. The objective was to determine the safety 
and  efficacy  of  DE  in  patients  with  non-rheumatic  atrial  fibrillation  (AF),  (paroxysmal,  persistent,  or 
permanent {chronic}) with or without concomitant treatment with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).
PETRO-EX study (1160.42)
The  PETRO-EX  study  was  a  long-term,  open-label  follow-up  treatment  of  patients  with  AF  who  had 
been  previously  treated  with  BIBR  1048  in  the  PETRO  trial.  The  primary  objective  was  to  study  the 
33
long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of  DE,  with  or  without  concomitant  chronic  treatment  with  ASA,  in 
patients  with  AF,  and  at  least  one  additional  risk  factor  for  thromboembolic  events.  The  dosages 
applied  in  these  2 dose-finding-studies  were  based on  data  from  the  BISTRO  studies  in  patients  with 
DVT, indicating safe and effective dosage of BIBR 1048 for the prevention of venous thromboembolism 
between  100  and  300  mg  per  day.  In  addition,  due  to  the  fact  that  patients  not  undergoing  major 
surgery  were  at  lower  risk  of  bleeding,  a  dose  range  of  DE  between  50  mg  bid  and  300  mg  bid  in 
combination with ASA (0mg, 81mg or 325 mg) was used in the studies.  Studies PETRO and PETRO-EX 
do  not  contribute  to  the  efficacy  of  DE  in  the  sought  indication  due  to  the  short  duration  and  the 
uncontrolled nature, respectively. 
Anticoagulation therapy has to balance prevention of thromboembolic events and risk of bleedings. In 
PETRO and PETRO-EX doses of DE below 150 mg per day had high rates of thromboembolic events and 
low bleeding rates, whereas DE doses of 600 mg per day produced unacceptable bleeding. The stroke 
incidences with a 300mg daily dose appeared to compare with historical trials with warfarin. The use of 
ASA  in  PETRO-EX,  which  included  exposure  up  to  5  years,  approximately  doubled  bleeding  rates.
Based  on  the  findings  in  the  PETRO  and  PETRO-EX  studies  it  was  agreed  by  the  CHMP  that  the  most 
appropriate daily dose of DE should be above 150mg but below 600mg daily.

2.5.2.  Main study
The single pivotal trial was the RELY study (1160.26).
RELY study (1160.26) 
Randomized Evaluation of Long term anticoagulant therapY
34
Methods
The  single  large  pivotal  RELY  study  was  a  prospective,  randomised,  multi-centre  (44  countries), 
parallel-group,  non-inferiority  trial  evaluating  long  term  anticoagulant  therapy  by  comparing  the 
efficacy and safety of two blinded doses of DE with open label warfarin for the prevention of stroke and 
systemic embolism (SEE) in patients with non-valvular AF.
The  duration  of  treatment  was  a  minimum  of  12  months'  treatment  after  the  last  subject  was 
randomized and a maximum treatment of approximately 3 years. Patients were assigned to 1 of the 3 
treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio: 1) DE 150 mg bid (blinded); 2) DE 110mg bid (blinded); 3) warfarin 
od, targeted therapeutic level of INR 2-3 (open-label). The dosage of DE was based upon the phase II 
PETRO trials suggesting that daily doses of DE seem to be above 150mg but below 600mg daily. 
The  quality  of  warfarin  management  was  expressed  by  the  time  INR  was  in  the  therapeutic  range 
between 2 and 3 (TTR). The TTR for warfarin reached a mean of 64.2%, and a median of 67%. As can 
be  expected,  the  TTR  was  higher  in  the  VKA  experienced  group  compared  to  the  VKA  naïve  group. 
Furthermore, there was a considerable difference of INR control between regions with Western Europe 
having the best INR control (TTR mean 68.7%, median 71.8%) and Asia having the worst control (TTR 
mean 54.3%, median 56.3%). In terms of countries, Sweden, followed by Finland, Australia, Denmark 
and  the  UK  had  the  highest  TTR,  and  Taiwan,  Mexico,  Romania,  Peru  and  India  the  lowest  TTR.  The 
applicant  has  argued,  that  the  TTR  is  comparable  to  the  warfarin  groups  in  contemporary  trials 
(SPORTIF-V  (68%),  SPORTIF  III  (66%),  ACTIVE-W  (64%),  AMADEUS  (63%)  and  AFFIRM  (62%).  
Admittedly, in these 5 trials the rate of VKA naïve patients, i.e. those with a less favourable TTR, was 
substantially lower compared to RELY, where VKA experienced and VKA-naïve patients were balanced.
Study Participants 
With the chosen in-and exclusion criteria an appropriate and relevant patient population was included 
in  the  RELY  study.  The  included  patients  suffered  from  symptomatic  or  asymptomatic  paroxysmal  or 
persistent  AF.  In  addition,  the  patients  had  one  of  the  following  additional  risk  factors  for  stroke:  a) 
Previous  stroke,  TIA  or  SEE  (21.8%);  b)  LVEF  ≤  40%  (10.7%);  c)  age  ≥  75  years  (40.0%);  d)  age 
≥65  years  and  one  of  the  following  additional  risk  factors:  i)  DM  (19.3%);  ii)  CAD  (24.2%);  iii) 
Hypertension  (67.3%).  Approximately  31%  of  subjects  had  one  stroke  risk  factor,  33%  had  two  risk 
factors and 33% had three or more risk factors. Exclusion of patients was based on a history of heart 
valve  disorder  and  severe,  disabling  stroke  as  well  as  conditions  associated with  an  increased  risk  of 
bleeding. Patients with severe renal impairment and active liver disease were also excluded.
Treatments
Patients were assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio: 
-dabigatran etexilate 150 mg bid (blinded)
-dabigatran etexilate 110mg bid (blinded) 
-warfarin od, targeted therapeutic level of INR 2-3 (open-label) 
The  duration  of  treatment  was  expected  to  be  a  median  of  20-24  months,  with  a  minimum  of  12 
months' treatment after the last subject was randomized and a maximum treatment of approximately 
3 years.
Recruitment of 15,000 subjects (for the first 2 years of the trial, closing Dec. 2007) was completed in 
1.5  years.  The  target  enrolment  was  achieved  approximately  6  months  earlier  than  expected  and  it 
35
was  predicted  that  the  number  of  subjects  randomized  would  be  increased  to  approximately  18,000 
(see below- amendments) 
Concomitant  drug  therapy  (fibrinolytics,  the  need  for  antiplatelet  therapy,  anticoagulation  other  than 
warfarin/dabigatran)  or  surgery/intervention  may  have  required  the  temporary  discontinuation  of 
study  warfarin  or  dabigatran. Due  to  the  ongoing  risk  of  stroke  and  systemic  embolism,  the  subjects 
eligible for the study usually required bridging anticoagulation as soon as possible. If the continuation 
of  anticoagulation  was  indicated,  strong  consideration  was  given  to  resuming  the  assigned  study 
medication (warfarin or dabigatran) as soon as medically justified.
Following  study  drug  discontinuation  due  to  AEs  (e.g.,  bleeds),  the  subjects  were  to  be  treated 
according  to  local  clinical  practice  wherever  possible.  For  subjects  who  required  resumption  of  oral 
anticoagulant therapy after resolution of a bleeding event, strong consideration was given to resuming 
assigned study medication unless absolutely contraindicated.
Objectives
The  primary  objective  is  to  demonstrate that  the  efficacy and  safety  of  2  blinded  doses  (110  mg  bid 
and 150 mg bid) of dabigatran etexilate are non-inferior to adjusted dose warfarin (target INR 2-3) for 
the  prevention  of  stroke  and  systemic  embolism  in  subjects  with  non-valvular  AF  with  at  least  1 
additional risk factor for stroke.
Outcomes/endpoints
Relevant  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  were  chosen  in  the  opinion  of  the  CHMP  that  mirror 
endpoints chosen in other trials with warfarin in AF.
o
o
The primary endpoint was incidence of stroke (including hemorrhagic) or non-Central Nervous 
System (CNS) systemic embolism, hereafter referred to as systemic embolism (SEE).
Secondary  endpoints  were  the  composite  endpoints  of  1)  Incidence  of  stroke  (including 
hemorrhagic),  SEE,  and  all  cause  death;  2)  Incidence  of  all  stroke  (including  hemorrhagic), 
SEE,  pulmonary  embolism  (PE),  myocardial  infarction  (MI),  vascular  death  (including  deaths 
from bleeding).
o Other endpoints were 1) individual occurrence or composites of any ischemic stroke (fatal and 
non-fatal), SEE, PE, acute MI, TIA, vascular death (including deaths from bleeding), all deaths, 
and hospitalisations; 2) Net Clinical Benefit (NCB) as measured by the composite of the clinical 
endpoint of stroke, SEE, PE, acute MI, all cause deaths, and major bleeds.
o
Safety  endpoints  were  bleeding  events  (major  and  minor),  intracerebral  haemorrhage,  other 
intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), hepatobiliary events and other adverse events (AEs).
Sample size
A total of 18113 subjects were randomised, 6015 to DE110 mg bid, 6076 to DE150 mg bid and 6022 
to warfarin. 
A  yearly  event  rate  of  1.6%  was  assumed  for  both  dabigatran  and  warfarin.  5,000 subjects  per 
treatment group were to be recruited in 2 years and followed up for 1 additional year to achieve 150 
events per treatment group. Within these parameters, each comparison had approximately 90% power 
to  conclude  the  non-inferiority  of  dabigatran  to  warfarin  at  a  one-sided  α=0.025  level  (without 
adjusting for multiple comparisons) based on the derived non-inferiority margin of 1.46.  With a total 
36
of  15,000 subjects  randomized  to  the  2 dabigatran  doses  and  warfarin  at  a  1:1:1  ratio,  to  achieve  a 
total of 450 events, using the  Hochberg procedure to compare each dabigatran dose to warfarin, the 
trial had approximately 84% power to conclude the non-inferiority of both dabigatran doses to warfarin 
using the non-inferiority margin of 1.46. A total of 15,000 subjects were recruited in less than 2 years 
(18 months).  If the recruitment was stopped at that time, the last randomized subject would have had 
to  be  followed  up  for  more  than  1  year  to  achieve  the  planned  total  number  of  events,  if  the  actual 
event rate was as expected.  In addition, based on the results from other published studies, the actual 
event rate could be less than 1.6%.  Because of these concerns, the operational committee decided to 
continue the recruitment as planned.  As a result, a total of 18,113 subjects were randomized.  It was 
expected that if the actual event rate was as planned, the statistical power would be increased. In the 
opinion of the CHMP the sample size calculation was adequate.
Randomisation
There  were  three  randomized  treatment  groups.  Randomization  was  performed  via  an  interactive 
voice-response  system  (IVRS)  with  an  allocation  ratio  of  1:1:1.  Randomisation  was  performed  in 
blocks.
Blinding (masking)
Patients and investigators were not blinded to warfarin or DE treatments. However, blinding was kept 
as  regards  the  two  doses  of  DE  treatment.  Though  a  double-blind  study  is  clearly  preferable  the 
difficulties  related  to  a  double-blind  warfarin  study  of  this  size  is  acknowledged  (close  monitoring, 
dose-adjustments, food and medication interactions). An Adjudication Committee blinded to treatment 
was  used  for  blindly  adjudicating  outcome  events.  Also,  the  sponsor,  the  Operations  Committee  and 
the  Steering  Committee,  remained  blinded  to  all  treatments.  In  addition,  the  outcome  events  were 
mainly objective outcomes whereby the risk of bias was minimised.  In view of the difficulties related 
to a double-blind study, this approach is deemed acceptable. The acceptability of the unblinded study 
design is also at least partially supported by the retrospectively obtained assay sensitivity as indicated 
by a clear dose-response relationship between DE 110bid and 150bid on primary endpoint.
Statistical methods
The RE-LY study was a non-inferiority study. The protocol specified non-inferiority margin (NIM) for the 
hazard ratio  was  1.46,  based  on  the  meta-analysis of  6  placebo-controlled  studies  (62%  relative  risk 
reduction of stroke by warfarin vs. placebo (95% CI 48-72%) (Hart et al, 1999)). The  non-inferiority 
margin  preserved  50%  of  the  benefit  of  warfarin  therapy  based  on  the  lower  bound  of  the  95% 
confidence interval of the VKA effect compared to placebo. The primary analysis compared the upper 
bound  of  the  95%  confidence  interval  of  the  hazard  ratio  for  each  DE  dose  compared  to  warfarin  to 
assess whether the individual DE doses met the protocol pre-specified NIM of 1.46, using the Hochberg 
procedure  to  adjust  for  multiple  testing.  It  could  be  argued  that  the  non-inferiority  margin  was  too 
wide  however,  in  view  of  the  clear  benefit  of  warfarin  vs.  placebo  in  primary  prevention  of 
thromboembolic events as demonstrated in historical warfarin atrial fibrillation trials (the AFSAK, SPAF, 
BAATAF  and  SPINAF  trials;  Arch  Intern  Med.  1994;  154:  1449-1457),  this  is  considered  acceptable. 
This  view  is  futher  supported  retrospectively  by  the  proven  superiority  of  DE  150bid  vs.  warfarin  as 
well  as  the  proven  dose-response  relationship  for  the  two  DE  dosages  on  the  primary  endpoint. The 
primary  efficacy  statistical  analysis  was  performed  on  the  “randomised  set”  including  all  randomised 
patients whether or not any randomised treatment was received. 
37
In the light of “death” as a competing risk (not a seldom event vs. stroke/SEE) an analysis of “time to 
event” as such is considered difficult. Therefore, the use of the Cox regression model as the statistical 
model (with treatment as the only factor in the model) for the analyses of the primary and secondary 
efficacy  variables  with  subsequent  presentation  of  hazard  ratios  is  considered  appropriate.  The 
Hochberg procedure was  applied for adjustment for multiplicity when evaluating the 2 dosages of DE 
for  the  primary  endpoint.  No  method  was  pre-specified  to  adjust  for  multiplicity  when  evaluating  the 
secondary  endpoints.  As  the  endpoints included  in  the  pre-specified  secondary  analyses  are  “natural” 
extensions of the primary endpoint, this may be acceptable.   
Results
Primary endpoint: Time to the first occurrence of stroke/SEE.
The yearly event rate for stroke/SEE was lowest for DE 150bid (134 patients, 1.11%), followed by DE 
110bid  (183  patients,  1.54%)  and  warfarin  (202 patients,  1.71%)  (Table  2),  and  was  driven  by
strokes. SEE was rare in all treatment groups. The Kaplan-Meier estimates are shown in figure 3.
Mainly  ischemic  strokes  accounted  for  the  primary  endpoint  with  a  yearly  event  rate  of  1.28%  (152 
patients),  0.86%  (103  patients)  and  1.14%  (134  patients)  for  DE  110bid,  DE150  and  warfarin.  The 
yearly event  rate  for  hemorrhagic  strokes  was  0.12% (14  patients),  0.10%  (12  patients)  and  0.38% 
(45 patients).
The stroke/SEE rates for warfarin appeared thus roughly comparable to the rates for warfarin in other 
AF trials (AMADEUS 1.3%, SPORTIF III 2.3%, SPORTIF V 1.2%, ACTIVE W stroke 1.4%).
For the risk of stroke/SEE both dosages of DE were non-inferior to warfarin with absolute and relative 
risk  reductions  amounting  to  0.17%  and  10%  for  DE  110bid  and  0.60%  and  35%  for  DE  150bid, 
respectively in comparison to warfarin (Table 3). The HRs were 0.90 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.10; p<0.0001) 
and 0.65 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.81; p<0.0001. Thus, the upper bound of the 95% CI was below 1.46, the 
protocol  specified  non-inferiority  margin,  for  both  doses.  DE  150bid  was  in  addition  statistically 
significantly superior to warfarin (p=0.0001). 
The DE 150mg Kaplan-Meier curve seemed to separate from the other two curves continuously during 
the whole trial (Figure 3).

Analyses of the two pre-specified secondary composite endpoints showed the same pattern as for the 
primary endpoint. The risks of “stroke, SEE and all cause death” and “stroke, SEE, PE, MI and vascular 
death”  were  similar  for  DE  110bid  vs.  warfarin  whereas  DE  150bid  was  superior  to  warfarin  for  both 
endpoints. As regards the individual components of endpoints, the event stroke was driven by ischemic 
stroke in all treatment groups (yearly event rates for DE 110bid, DE 150bid and warfarin were 1.28%, 
0.86%  and  1.14%,  respectively).  Haemorrhagic  strokes  were  rare,  but  less  than  one  third  for  DE 
compared to warfarin (yearly event rates for DE 110bid, DE 150bid and warfarin were 0.12%, 0.10% 
and  0.38%,  respectively.  Despite  low  absolute  numbers  of  ICH,  the  benefit  of  both  DE  dosages  vs. 
Warfarin was remarkable consistent across a large variety of subgroups (i.e. age, body weight, centre 
INR, +/- use of concomitant ASA).
The yearly event rates for MI (including silent MI)  were numerically higher for DE 110bid and 150bid 
vs. warfarin (0.82% and 0.81% vs. 0.64%) (table 8).

Despite small absolute differences vs. warfarin (DE 110bid: 0.18%; DE 150bid: 0.17%) a separation of 
the DE 150bid Kaplan-Meier curve from warfarin was observed after 3 months of treatment, and after 
23  months  the  separation  increased  continuously.  Thus,  an  overall  risk  of  MI  associated  with 
dabigatran  treatment  in  the  proposed  indication  seems  to  exist.    No  dose-response  relationship  was 
identified.  The  highest  risk  of  MI  was  found  in  subjects  with  a  previous  MI,  those  with  CAD,  HF, 
reduced  LVEF,  diabetes  and  moderate  renal  function.  The  relative  risk  for  DE  vs.  warfarin  was  not 
significantly  different  in  these  subgroups.  Otherwise,  a  particular  subgroup  of  patients  being 
particularly at risk of MI could not be identified. The pathophysiological mechanism is still unclear and 
markers  that  could  reveal  rebound  anticoagulation  have  not  been  collected,  but  the  generation  of 
hypotheses is expected from a further sub-study of RELY which is pending. The results and conclusions 
of this study will be provided as a post-authorisation commitment. The risk of MI does not change the 
overall  benefit  of  DE  vs.  Warfarin,  However,  careful  wording  in  the  SmPC  is  needed  and  MIs  are 
covered in the RMP as a potential risk. 
Also  for  the  pulmonary  embolism  (PE)  the  yearly  event  rates  were  numerically  higher  for  DE  110bid 
(0.12%)  and  150bid  (0.15%)  vs.  warfarin  (0.10%).  The  issue  was  discussed  by  the  MAH  in  the 
41
response  to  the  D120  LoQs  however;  no  conclusion  can  be  drawn  on  the  potential  association  of  PE 
and DE treatment. The very low overall number of PE during the study is acknowledged still, the signal 
of an increased risk of PE in DE treated patients should be covered in the RMP as a potential risk.
The  yearly  event  rate  for  all  cause  death  was  3.75%,  3.64%  and  4.13%  for  DE  110bid,  150bid  and 
warfarin,  corresponding  to  absolute  reductions  of  0.38%  and  0.49%  vs.  warfarin.  The  Kaplan-Meier 
curves for DE 110bid and 150bid separated from warfarin 16 months after randomisation. The HR for 
all cause death for DE 150bid vs. warfarin was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.77, 1.00; p=0.0475), however, after 
inclusion of additional outcome events identified after data base lock, the risk of all cause death for DE 
150bid  vs.  warfarin  shifted  to  not  statistically  different  (p=0.0517;  please  see  section  below  on 
ancillary  analyses).  Most  deaths  were  of  vascular  origin.  The  vascular  death  HR  for  DE  150bid  vs. 
warfarin was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.99; p=0.0430).
Participant flow
A  total  of  20,377  subjects  were  screened  (enrolled),  and  18,113  were  randomized  (entered).  There 
were  2,264  subjects  not  randomized  after  screening;  almost  70%  of  these  subjects  did  not  meet 
inclusion/exclusion  criteria.  The  randomized  subjects  were  equally  distributed  across  the  three 
treatment groups. Approximately 36% of the subjects were from the United States and Canada, 25.7% 
from Western Europe, 15.4% from Asia, 11.7% from Central Europe, 5.9% from Australia, Israel, and 
South Africa and 5.3% from Latin America. The number of subjects randomized to the three treatment 
regimens  was  equally  distributed  across  each  geographic  region.  All  except  73 randomized  subjects 
received  study  medication  (99.6%).  Overall,  17,360 (96.2%)  of  the  treated  subjects  completed  the 
study;  78.1%  completed  on  study  medication  and  18.1%  completed  follow  up  but  stopped  study 
medication  prematurely.  A  higher  frequency  of  subjects  completed  the  study  on  medication  in  the 
warfarin  group  compared  to  the  dabigatran  110  mg  bid  and  150  mg  bid  dose  groups  (80.8%  vs. 
77.1% and 76.4%, respectively). The three most common reasons for discontinuing study drug  were 
other, patient preference and outcome events, all more common on dabigatran. A total of 680 (3.8%) 
of the 18,042 treated subjects were prematurely discontinued from the study and did not complete the 
trial  follow-up;  there  were  no  significant  differences  across  treatment  groups.  The  majority  of  these 
subjects withdrew consent (412; 2.3%).
Recruitment
A total of 18113 subjects were randomised, 6015 to DE110 mg bid, 6076 to DE150 mg bid and 6022 
to warfarin. 
Conduct of the study
Study  period:    December  2005  –  March  2009,  conducted  at  951  sites  across  44  countries  (Europe, 
North America, Latin America, Asia, South Africa, Australia). The protocol changes put in place in order 
to  provide  a  balance  between  VKA  naïve  and  VKA  experienced  subjects  as  well  as  the  changes 
increasing  the  sample  size  from  15,000  to  18,000  patients  were  considered  by  the  CHMP  the  most 
important  ones.  A  negative  impact  on  the  study  conduct  is  not  expected  in  the  opinion  of  the 
Committee. Most other amendments are clarifications or are put in place for safety reasons. 
Baseline data
The  groups  were  generally  well  balanced  with  respect  to  demographic  and  disease  characteristic 
information:
42
The mean age was 71.5 years. Overall, 16.4% of subjects were < 65 years of age, 43.6% were in the 
range  65-75  years,  and  40.0%  were      75  years  old.  Males  comprised  63.6%  of  the  subjects.  The 
majority  of  patients  recruited  came  from  North  America  (36.1%),  followed  by  Western  Europe 
(25.7%), Asia (15.4%) and Central Europe (11.7%).
VKA use: The randomization of this trial was balanced by VKA use (VKA naïve and VKA experienced).
Pacemakers and implantable defibrillators were present in 10.7% and 2.2% of the subjects in this trial, 
respectively.  Approximately  28%  of  the  overall  population  in  this  study  had  a  previous  cardioversion 
and 2.1% had an atrioventricular (AV) node ablation
Renal  status:  Concordant  with  a  high  percentage  of  elderly  ≥  75  years  of  age  patients  with  mild  or 
moderate renal impairment were reasonably represented (45.8% and 18.5%, respectively). 
Baseline stroke risk factors where also well balanced in between treatment groups. 
The mean CHADS2 score was 2.1, median 2, corresponding to an intermediate stroke risk (approx 3-
5% per year; ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 guideline). Approximately one third of subjects had CHADS2 scores 
of 3 or higher. 
Concomitant medications: Medication at baseline was wide and corresponded to what can be expected 
from  a  patient  population  with  cardiovascular  comorbidity.  Approximately  40%  of  the  subjects  used 
ASA  at  least  once  during  the  study  while  20.5%  of  the  subjects  received  ASA  throughout  the  study. 
Clopidogrel was used at least once by 7.4% of subjects (slightly higher than the use at baseline), while 
2.4%  of  the  subjects  received  clopidogrel  throughout  the  study.  Approximately  1%  of  the  subjects 
received ASA plus clopidogrel throughout the study. A slightly higher use of PPI during the study was 
noted  in  the  DE  groups  (DE  110mg:  24.6%;  DE  150mg:  24.7%)  compared  to  the  warfarin  group 
(21.1%), probably due to the higher rate of gastrointestinal adverse events including GI bleedings,with 
DE  Overall,  it  can  be  resumed  that  a  relevant  patient  population  with  AF  was  enrolled  in  the  pivotal 
RELY  trial  (1160.26)  constituting  those  patients  typically  encountered  in  clinical  practice,  with 
considerable CV comorbidity as reflected in their advanced age with reduced renal function, stroke risk 
profiles,  and  concurrent  medications  (antihypertensives,  antiarrhytmics  and  other  drugs  used  in  AF, 
antithrombotic therapies, cholesterol lowering drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs).

Outcomes and estimation
The  yearly  event  rate  for  the  primary  endpoint  stroke/SEE  was  1.54%  (183 patients)  for  DE  110bid, 
1.11%  (134 patients)  for  DE  150bid  and  1.71%  (202 patients)  for  warfarin.  Mainly  ischemic  strokes 
accounted  for  the  primary  endpoint  with  yearly  event  rates  of  1.28%  (152  patients),  0.86%  (103
patients) and 1.14% (134 patients) for DE 110bid, DE 150bid and warfarin. The yearly event rates for 
hemorrhagic  strokes  were  0.12%  (14  patients),  0.10%  (12  patients)  and  0.38%  (45  patients).The 
stroke/SEE rates for warfarin appeared thus roughly comparable to the warfarin rates in other AF trials 
(AMADEUS  1.3%,  SPORTIF  III  2.3%,  SPORTIF  V  1.2%,  ACTIVE  W  stroke  1.4%).  For  the  risk  of 
stroke/SEE both dosages of DE were non-inferior to warfarin with absolute and relative risk reductions 
amounting  to  0.17%  and  10%  for  DE  110bid  and  0.60%  and  35%  for  DE  150bid,  respectively  in 
comparison to warfarin (Table 3). The HRs were 0.90 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.10; p<0.0001) and 0.65 (95% 
CI: 0.52, 0.81; p<0.0001. Thus, the upper bound of the 95% CI was below 1.46, the protocol specified 
non-inferiority  margin, for  both  doses.  DE  150bid  was  in  addition  statistically  significantly  superior  to 
warfarin  (p=0.0001).  The  DE  150bid  Kaplan-Meier  curve  seemed  to  separate  from  the  other  two 
curves continuously  during  the  whole  trial.  In  view  of  the  easier  administration  of  DE  (no  monitoring 
and  no  dose-adjustments)  the  efficacy  is  considered  of  clinical  benefit.  The  efficacy  of  DE  was  not 
affected  when  analysed  by  baseline  demographic  subgroups  (age,  gender,  ethnicity,  region,  weight, 
BMI and CrCL) – data not presented above. Several sensitivity analyses for stroke/SEE were performed
to support the efficacy results using the safety- and the per protocol set, investigator reported events 
and  stratified  analyses  by  baseline  VKA  use,  ASA  use  and  history  of  stroke/SEE/TIA.  The  analyses 
seemed to support the efficacy of DE. 
Subgroup analyses
Age:  The  rates  of  events  on  the  primary  endpoint  stroke/SEE  generally  increased  with  age  across  all 
treatment groups. In the three sub-groups of age (< 65, 65-75 and ≥75 years of age), DE 110 seemed 
of less benefit than DE 150. 
Renal function: Stroke rates increased with decreasing renal function in all treatment groups.
Gender:  Females  had  higher  rates  of  stroke/SEE  than  males.  They  also  experienced  a  slightly  better 
efficacy of DE 150, which can be explained by a higher exposure to dabigatran in correlation with slight 
decreased CL/F.
Body weight: Stroke rates increased with decreasing body weight in all treatment groups.
Ethnic  groups:  There  were  no  obvious  differences in  hazard  ratios  for  the  primary  endpoint  observed 
across different ethnic groups, but it is difficult to conclude for black subjects due to the small number 
of patients.
Regions: There was high difference in stroke rates by region. DE 150 consistently had a lower stroke 
rate compared to warfarin. DE 110 provided point estimates > 1 in some regions (the highest hazard 
ratios being in Central Europe), where the warfarin rate was also the lowest. 
Prior VKA use: Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint by prior VKA use did not seem to influence 
the overall efficacy of both DE dosages on the primary endpoint. The difference between DE 150bid vs. 
warfarin, however, was smaller in the VKA experienced group than in the VKA naïve group. 
Baseline  stroke  risk  factors:  DE  110bid  was  unaltered  non-inferior  to  warfarin  when  analysed  by 
baseline stroke risk factors.
44
 No altered efficacy was observed when the primary endpoint was analysed by CHADS2-score. As could 
be expected, the primary endpoint event rate increased with increasing CHADS2 score for all treatment 
groups.
INR  time  in  therapeutic  range  (2-3;  TTR):  Extensive  analyses  on  the  association  between  quality  of 
INR and outcomes were requested by CHMP and provided in the response to the D120 LoQ.
For the overall RE-LY trial the mean TTR (time in therapeutic range) was 64.4% and the median was 
67.3%.  The  mean  TTR  in  the  EU  countries  was  66.9%,  with  Sweden,  Finland,  Denmark  and  the  UK 
having the highest TTR and Romania, Poland, France and Slovakia the lowest. 
Not  unexpectedly,  the  outcome  of  warfarin  treatment  improved  with  increasing  TTR.  The  presented 
analyses  clearly  demonstrated  that  the  benefits  observed  in  the  comparison  of  DE  to  warfarin 
diminished  if  INR  control  was  good  with  TTR  >70%.  Still,  for  the  overall  population  as  well  as  for 
patients  ≥  75  years  of  age,  DE  150  appeared  more  attractive  with  respect  to  the  primary  endpoint 
(prevention  of  stroke/SEE)  when  compared  to  warfarin at  centres  with  TTR  >70%.  DE  110  appeared 
comparable to warfarin in this case. This information is included in section 5.1 of the SmPC.
Ancillary analyses
After data base lock 27 new events were identified by the sponsor (by routine site closeout visits) and 
the data coordinating center, PHRI. Of the 27 events 22 events were adjudicated as outcome events. 
Sensitivity  analyses  on  primary  endpoint,  all  cause  death,  vascular  death,  major  bleeds  and 
intracranial  haemorrhage  have  been  performed  including  the  new  adjudicated  outcome  events.  Only 
for all cause death a shift was observed for DE 150 mg: HRs (DE 150mg vs. warfarin) were unaltered 
0.88  (old  and  new  data)  with  unaltered  95%  CIs  of  0.77,  1.00.  However,  the  p-value  moved  from 
statistically significantly superior (p=0.0475) to not statistically significantly superior (p=0.0517). For 
NCB the HR for the comparison DE150 vs. warfarin was 0.90 (95%CI 0.82, 0.99), p= 0.0254. For the 
other outcome events the results were unaltered. Overall, the conclusions on efficacy and safety for DE 
vs. warfarin are unaltered despite the inclusion of the additional adjudicated outcome events.

Notes
The  annualized  rates  of  events  were  computed  from  the  total  patient  years 
of  exposure  and  the  number of  patients  with  at  least  one  event. Treatment 
comparisons  were  based  on  hazard  ratios  of  the  different  treatments.  The 
high  dose  was  superior  to  warfarin  in  stroke/SEE  reduction  and  similar  to 
warfarin in the rate of major bleeds. The low dose was similar to warfarin in 
efficacy (stroke/SEE)  and  superior  to  warfarin for  major  bleeds.  Both  doses 
significantly reduced intracranial hemorrhage compared to warfarin. Addition 
of  death  to  the  primary  endpoint,  as  a  competing  risk,  did  not  change  the 
efficacy compared to warfarin.
Analysis description The  statistical  model  for  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  the  Cox 
proportional hazard model including treatment as a factor in the model. The 
hazard  ratio  and  its  confidence  limits  were  determined  for  evaluating  the 
non-inferiority  of  dabigatran  over  warfarin.  The  Cox  regression  model  was 
also used for other time-to-event analyses.
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
Antithrombotic  therapy  for  patients  with  AF  is  currently  recommended  for  patients  with  a  high  risk 
factor  (stroke/SEE/TIA)  or  patients  with  one  or  more  moderate  risk  factors  (age  >75  years, 
hypertension, HF, LVEF <35%, diabetes mellitus) whereas anticoagulation in patients with weaker risk 
49
factors  (females,  age  65-74,  CAD,  thyreotoxicoxis)  is  debatable.  A  strengthening  of  the  treatment 
recommendations  has  been  proposed  recently  (ESC  2010  guideline 2)  with  the  recommendation  to 
provide anticoagulation to patients with one ‘major’ risk factor or more than 2 ‘clinically relevant non-
major’  risk  factors and  the  option  to  treat  if  one  ‘clinically  relevant  non-major’  risk  factor  is  present. 
The major risk factors are prior stroke/TIA/SEE and age ≥75 years. ‘Clinically relevant non-major’ risk 
factors are HF, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, females, age 65–74 years, and vascular disease. Thus, 
a relevant patient population with AF was enrolled in the pivotal RELY trial (1160.26) constituting those 
patients  typically  encountered  in  clinical  practice,  with  considerable  cardiovascular  co-morbidities  as 
reflected  in  their  advanced  age  with  reduced  renal  function,  stroke  risk  profiles,  and  concurrent 
medications.  In  contrast  to  recent  AF  trials  (SORTIF  III  and  IV,  ACTIVE-W,  AMADEUS)  patients  were 
balanced as regards their previous VKA use. 
The  yearly  event  rate  for  the  primary  endpoint  stroke/SEE  was  1.54%  (183 patients)  for  DE  110bid, 
1.11%  (134 patients)  for  DE  150bid  and  1.71%  (202 patients)  for  warfarin.  DE  110bid  was  non-
inferior and DE 150bid superior when compared to warfarin. The absolute and relative risk reductions 
amounted to 0.17% and 10% for DE 110bid and 0.60% and 35% for DE 150bid, respectively. The DE 
150  mg  Kaplan-Meier  curve  seemed  to  separate  continuously  from  the  other  two  curves  during  the 
whole trial indicating a consistent and increasing effect. Approximately half of all strokes were disabling 
including  fatal,  with  no  significant  differences  between  treatment  groups. Mainly  ischemic  strokes 
accounted  for  the  primary  endpoint  with  yearly  event  rates  of  1.28%  (152  patients),  0.86%  (103
patients) and 1.14% (134 patients) for DE 110bid, DE 150bid and warfarin. The yearly event rates for 
hemorrhagic strokes were 0.12% (14 patients), 0.10% (12 patients) and 0.38% (45 patients). 
Subgroup  analyses  of  the  primary  endpoint: Prior  VKA  use  did  not  seem  to  influence  the  overall 
efficacy  of  both  DE  dosages  on  the  primary  endpoint.  Analyses  by  “baseline  medication  use”, 
“medication  use  during  study”  and  by  different  demographic  subgroups  indicated  overall  consistent 
efficacy  as  the  point  estimate  for  HR  was  below  1  for  most  groups  for  both  DE  110mg  and  150mg. 
Further  analyses  of  D150  by  weight  cut-off  at  60kg  indicated  that  the  benefit  of  DE  150mg  bid  was 
preserved also in this low weight category and a dose reduction seems not indicated in these patients.
Stroke  rates  increased  with  decreasing  renal  function  and  decreasing  body  weight  as  well  as  with 
increasing  age  in  all  treatment  groups. When  the  primary  endpoint  was  analysed  by  baseline  stroke 
risk factors (LVEF <40%,  symptomatic HF, age >65 years with concomitant diabetes or hypertension 
or CAD) DE 150bid was still more favourable compared to warfarin. 
Two  secondary  endpoints  were  specified  in  the  protocol:  composite  endpoints  of  “stroke,  SEE  and  all 
cause  death”  and  “stroke,  SEE,  PE,  MI  and  vascular  death”:  the  event  rates  for  “stroke,  SEE  and  all 
cause  death”  and  “stroke,  SEE,  PE,  MI  and  vascular  death”  were  similar  for  DE  110bid  (4.85%  and 
4.17%)  and  warfarin  (5.20  %  and  4.27%)  whereas  DE  150bid  (4.32%  and  3.61%)  was  superior  to 
warfarin  for  both  endpoints.  Subgroup  analyses  of  the  secondary  endpoint  by  VKA  use  did  not  affect 
the  efficacy  of  DE  110mg  and  150mg  vs.  warfarin. Also  for  other  endpoints  the  efficacy  of  DE  vs. 
warfarin  was  similar  to  the  efficacy on  primary-  and  secondary  endpoints:  The  yearly  event  rates  for 
composite  endpoint  of  “ischemic  stroke,  SEE,  PE,  MI,  TIA,  hospitalisation  or  all  cause  deaths”  were 
20.80%,  21.61%  and  22.27%  for  DE  110bid,  DE  150bid  and  warfarin  respectively.  The  yearly  event 
rates for the “net clinical benefit” endpoint (composite endpoint of “stroke, SEE, PE, MI, all cause death 
and major bleed”) were 7.25%, 7.05% and 7.84% for DE 110bid, DE 150bid and warfarin respectively. 
The  HR  was  superior  for  DE  150mg  vs.  warfarin  for  the  “Net  clinical  benefit”  endpoint,  however,  the 
upper  limit  of  the  95%  CI  contained  1  (0.91  (95%  CI:  0.82,  1.00;  p=0.0393).  In  view  of  additional 
outcome events (identified after data base lock) shifting the superior effect of DE150 mg vs. warfarin

on “all cause death” to not significantly different, the applicant re-analysed NCB, the HR was then 0.90 
(95%CI 0.82, 0.99; p=0.0254). 
Analyses of the individual components of endpoints: The yearly event rates of strokes were lower for 
DE  110bid  and  DE  150bid  compared  to  warfarin  (1.44%,  1.01%  and  1.58%  respectively).  Absolute 
reductions  for  DE  110mg  and  150  mg  vs.  warfarin:  0.14%  and  0.57%,  respectively).  Likewise  the 
number of  subjects  with  1-,  2-  or  ≥3  strokes  was  lower  for  both  DE  dosages vs.  the  warfarin  group. 
The  frequency  of  ischemic  strokes  for  DE  110  bid  was  numerically  higher  than  for  DE  150bid  and 
warfarin (1.28%, 0.86% and 1.12% respectively). The difference for all strokes in favour of DE 110bid 
vs.  warfarin  was  mainly  driven  by  haemorrhagic  strokes  (0.12%  and  0.38%).  However,  the  Kaplan-
Meier curves for ischaemic strokes separated early for DE 150bid and by month 30 also for DE 110bid 
when  compared  to  warfarin.  As  regards”  time  to  first  haemorrhagic  stroke”  and  “time  to  first 
intracranial haemorrhage” both DE curves separated early (month 1-3) from warfarin. The severity of 
the strokes as evaluated by the Modified Rankin Score (score from 0-2; disabling stroke: score form 3-
6, 6= fatal outcome) was similar for all three treatment arms. The yearly event rate for SEE was very 
small in all treatment groups being lower for DE treated patients compared to warfarin (0.13%, 0.11% 
and  0.18%  for  DE  110bid,  DE  150bid  and  warfarin;  absolute  reductions  vs.  warfarin  amounted  to 
0.05% and 0.07%). The yearly event rates for MI were lowest in the warfarin group and similar in the 
DE treatment groups (warfarin 0.64%, DE 110 0.82%, DE 150 0.81%). The risk of MI was numerically
higher  for  either  dose  of  DE  vs.  warfarin  (HRs  were  1.29 (95%  CI:  0.96,  1.75;  p=0.0929)  for  DE 
110bid and 1.27 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.71; p=0.1240) for DE 150bid compared to warfarin) substantiated 
by a separation of the DE 150bid Kaplan-Meier curve from warfarin after 3 months of treatment. After 
23  months  the  separation  increased  continuously.  No  clear  pattern  was  observed  when  analysed  by 
baseline demographic characteristics, stroke risk factors, CHADS2 score, AF type, “baseline medication 
use” or by “medication use during study period”.  Further analyses on the MI risk were provided in the 
response to the D120 LoQ and D180 LoOIs. A dose-dependency for the increased risk of MI could not 
be  confirmed.  The  highest  risk  of  MI  was  found  in  subjects  with  a  previous  MI,  those  with  CAD,  HF, 
reduced  LVEF,  diabetes  and  moderate  renal  function.  The  relative  risk  for  DE  vs.  warfarin  was  not 
significantly different in these subgroups. Thus, a particular subgroup of patients being particularly at 
risk of MI could not be identified. The overall benefit risk of dabigatran is not considered to be affected 
by  this  finding,  however,  strong  warnings  have  been  inserted  in  the  SmPC  and  MI  was  included  as  a 
potential risk in the RMP.
According to the EMA guideline: Points to consider on application with 1. meta-analyses; 2. one pivotal 
study” (CPMP/EWP/2330/99), the confirmatory evidence provided by one pivotal study only has to be 
exceptionally compelling. The internal validity should be high, thus there should be no indications of a 
potential bias. As discussed above the latter has not been fulfilled in the present application. However, 
in  view  of  the  relatively  rare  nature  of  the  outcome  events  in  the  primary  endpoint  (stroke  /SEE)  it 
seems  unreasonable  to  require  an  additional  study  of  the  same  magnitude.  To  confirm  the  internal 
validity an inspection was conducted. In addition, extensive analysis on the association between quality 
of  INR  and  outcomes  were  requested  by  CHMP  and  provided  in  the  response  to  the  D120  LoQ  and 
D180 LoOIs.
For  the  overall  RELY  trial  the  mean TTR  (time  in  therapeutic  range)  was  64.4%  and  the  median  was 
67.3%.  The  mean  TTR  in  the  EU  countries  was  66.9%,  with  Sweden,  Finland,  Denmark  and  the  UK 
having  the  highest  TTR  and  Romania,  Greece,  Poland,  France  and  Slovakia  the  lowest.  Not 
unexpectedly,  the  outcome  of  warfarin  treatment  improved  with  increasing  TTR.  The  presented 
analyses  clearly  demonstrated  that  the  benefits  observed  in  the  comparison  of  DE  to  warfarin 
diminished  if  INR  control  was  good  with  TTR  >70%.  Still,  for  the  overall  population  as  well  as  for 
patients  ≥  75  years  of  age  DE  150  appeared  more  attractive  with  respect  to  the  primary  endpoint 
51
(prevention  of  stroke/SEE)  when  compared  to  warfarin at  centres  with  TTR  >70%.  DE  110  appeared 
comparable to warfarin in this case. For a discussion on major bleeding events and TTR please refer to 
the safety section below. The yearly event rates for PE were overall low but also numerically higher for 
both  DE  dosages  vs.  warfarin  albeit  the  absolute  differences  were  low  amounting  to  0.02%  for  DE 
110mg and 0.05% for DE 150mg. PE  is addressed in the RMP as a potential risk. It is reassuring that 
patients  randomised  to  any  of  the  DE  doses  had  lower  rates  of  all-cause  death  than  warfarin  (DE 
110mg:  3.75%;  DE  150mg:  3.64%;  warfarin:  4.14%),  although  a  statistically  significance  difference 
could no longer be proven for DE 150 after the new analyses. The HR for DE 150mg vs. warfarin was 
0.88  (95%  CI:  0.77,1.00;  p=  0.0517).  16  months  after  randomization  the  “all  cause  death”  Kaplan-
Meier  curves  for  DE  110mg  and  150mg  separated  from  warfarin  indicating  a  consistent  effect.  Most 
deaths were of vascular origin. The vascular death HR for DE 150mg vs. warfarin was 0.85 (95% CI: 
0.72, 0.99; p=0.0430). Subjects treated with DE 110 had the lowest rate of hospitalisation, which was 
significantly lower when compared with warfarin (p=0.0209).
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy
DE  110bid  was  non-inferior  and  DE  150bid  was  superior  when  compared  to  warfarin  for  the  primary 
outcome (time to the first occurrence of stroke/SEE). Also for the two secondary outcomes (composite 
of  “stroke,  SEE  and  all  cause  death”,  and  “stroke,  SEE,  PE,  MI  and  vascular  death”)  and  the  “other” 
endpoint Net Clinical Benefit DE 110bid was non-inferior and DE 150bid was superior when compared 
to warfarin. The effect of DE seemed consistent across the components of the composite endpoints. In 
view  of  the  easier  administration  of  DE  (no  monitoring  and  no  dose-adjustments)  and  from  a  pure 
efficacy point of view the consistent efficacy of both dosages of DE is considered a clinical benefit. One 
exception however was MI. Although small in absolute numbers, the risk of MI was numerically higher 
for  DE  110mg  and  150mg  vs.  warfarin,  substantiated  by  continuously  diverging  Kaplan-Meier  curves 
throughout study duration. A dose-response for MI could not be confirmed. Extensive analysis on the 
association  between  quality  of  INR  and  outcomes  were  requested  by  CHMP  and  provided  in  the 
response  to  the  D120  LoQ  and  D180LoOIs. Not  unexpectedly,  the  outcomes  associated  with  warfarin 
improved with increasing TTR. The presented analyses clearly demonstrated that the benefits observed 
in the comparison of DE to warfarin diminished if INR control was good with TTR >70%. Still, for the 
primary  endpoint  DE  150mg  bid  compares  favourably  to  warfarin  treated  patients  from  centres  with 
TTR ≥ 70%.
2.6.  Clinical safety
Patient exposure
Safety  data  are  derived  from  the  combined  SPAF  Phase  II/III  trials  (1160.20,  1160.42,  1160.49  and 
1160.26)  but  are  mainly  based  on  results  from  the  phase  III  RE-LY  study  A  total  of  18 042  patients 
were included in the safety analysis of  RELY (5 983 in DE 110 bid, 6 059 in DE 150 bid and 5 998 in 
warfarin). The mean total exposure to study drug was similar across treatment groups (20.5 months in 
DE 110 bid, 20.3 months in DE 150 bid and 21.3 months in warfarin).
The primary safety endpoint
The  primary  safety  endpoint  was  major  bleeding  events  (MBE)  adjudicated  by  an  Adjudication 
Committee  blinded  to  treatment.  Overall  the  definition  of  MBEs  and  life-threatening  bleeding  events 
used in the RE-LY study are considered acceptable. 
52
Adverse events 
Bleeding events
In the RELY study the yearly rate of major bleedings, the primary safety endpoint, was 2.87% for DE 
110mg bid, 3.32% for DE150 mg bid and 3.57% for warfarin (table 11). The MBE risk was significantly 
lower  for  DE  110  bid  compared  to  warfarin (HR  =  0.80 (95%  CI:  0.70,  0.93;  p=0.0026),  whereas  it 
was  numerically  lower  for  DE  150  bid  compared  to  warfarin,  but  the  difference  was  not  statistically 
significant  (HR  =  0.93  (95%  CI:  0.81,  1.07;  p=0.3146)). The  risk  of  life-threatening  bleeds, 
hemorrhagic strokes and ICHs was significantly lower in DE treated patients vs. warfarin (all p values 
≤0.0001, except for p=0.0305 for life-threatening bleeds for DE 150 mg bid vs. warfarin). The yearly 
rates  for  life-threatening bleedings  were  1.24%  1.49%  and  1.85%,  for  haemorrhagic  strokes  0.12%, 
0.10%  and  0.38%  and  for  ICH  0.23%,  0.32%  and  0.76%  for  DE  110bid,  DE150  bid,  and  warfarin, 
respectively  (table  11).  Despite  low  absolute  numbers  of  ICH,  the  benefit  of  both  DE  dosages  vs. 
Warfarin was remarkable consistent across a large variety of subgroups (i.e. age, body weight, centre 
INR, +/- use of concomitant ASA).

ICH consists of adjudicated hemorrhagic stroke and subdural and/or subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
As  regards  MBE  analysed  by  bleeding  criteria  “symptomatic  bleedings  in  critical  areas/organs”,  these 
were approximately halved for each dose of DE compared to warfarin. The  main bleeding localisation 
was intracranial  for warfarin” and constituted 18.7% of the MBE in the warfarin group and 8.6% and 
7.5%  in  the  DE  150bid  and  the  DE  110  bid  treatment  groups,  respectively  (table  12).  Fatal  bleeds 
were  also  more  frequent  with  warfarin  compared  to  DE  150bid  and  DE  110bid  (8.3%  vs.  5.9%  and 
6.1%).  Intracranial  fatal  bleedings  were  reported  more  frequently  for  warfarin  than  for  DE110  and 
DE150 (N= 23, 10 and 9 respectively) whereas GI fatal bleedings were more frequent for DE150  than 
for DE110 and warfarin (N= 10, 4 and 6 respectively). Gastrointestinal MBEs constituted a large part of 
53
all MBEs and were noticeably higher with both DE doses (table 12). The yearly event rates for any GI 
bleeds  was  5.41%,  6.13%  and  4.02%  and  for  GI  major  bleeds  1.14%,  1.57%  and  1.07%  for  DE 
110mg  bid,  DE  150mg  bid  and  warfarin,  respectively. The  risk  of  GI  major  bleeds  was  significantly 
higher for DE 150 bid compared to warfarin (HR = 1.47 (95% CI: 1.17, 1.85; p=0.0008]), including GI 
life threatening bleeds (HR = 1.62 (95% CI: 1.17,  2.26; p=0.0038), and was also significantly lower 
for DE110 bid vs. DE 150 bid.  There was a significant interaction of major GI bleed for age and certain 
stroke  risk  factors.  Thus,  the  risk  of  GI  bleeding  is  an  issue  of  concern  for  patients  ≥  75,  For  all 
treatment  groups  an  increased  risk  of  GI  bleeding  was  also  associated  with  concomitant  medication 
with  ASA,  clopidogrel  and  NSAIDs.  In  addition,  for  patients  “on  PPI  only  during  treatment”  an 
increased frequency of major GI bleed was observed.

MBEs by subgroup analyses
Age:  A  statistical  significant  interaction  for  the  risk  of  major  bleeds  with  treatment  was  observed  for 
age (p<0.0001). For subjects <75 years of age, the DE groups had lower rates of MBEs vs.  warfarin 
(<65 years: DE 110bid vs. warfarin, HR = 0.33 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.59); DE 150 bid vs. warfarin, HR = 
0.36 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.62); 65-<75 years: DE 110bid vs. warfarin, HR = 0.70 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.89); 
DE 150bid vs. warfarin, HR = 0.80 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.00)). However subjects ≥75 years of age on DE 
150bid  had  a  higher  rate  of  MBE  compared  to  warfarin  (DE  110:  4.44%;  DE  150:  5.12%;  warfarin: 
and 4.39%; DE 110 vs. warfarin HR 1.01 (CI 0.83, 1.23), DE 150 vs. warfarin 1.18 (CI 0.98, 1.43)). 
The increased rate of MBEs in the elderly population ≥ 75 years is worrisome due to the fragility of this 
population compared to the population below 75 years of age. Please refer to discussion on dosing in 
elderly in discussion on clinical safety.
ASA  use  during  the  study  had  a  strong  effect  on  bleeding  risk.  Subjects  who  took  ASA  at  least  once 
during  the  study  almost  doubled  the  risk  of  a  major  bleed  (hazard  ratio  =  1.91,  p-value<0.001) 
compared  with  those  who  did  not  use  ASA  during  the  study.  However,  no  statistical  significant 
interaction for the risk of MBE with treatment was observed for ASA.
Renal  dysfunction was  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of  bleeding,  for  all  treatments,  thus  the  rates  of 
MBEs increased with decreasing renal function. In the sub-group of moderate renal impairment (CrCL 
30-50  ml/min),  the  yearly  event  rate  of  MBEs  was  comparable    for  DE  110  vs.    warfarin  (5.65%  vs. 
5.68%)  however, lower for  DE 150 vs.  Warfarin (5.27% vs. 5.68%). 
In  the  sub-group  with  mild  renal  impairment  (CrCL  50-80  ml/min)  treatment  with  DE  150  caused 
higher  MBEs  rates  than  DE  110  (but  lower  rates  vs.  warfarin),  confirming  the  overall  relationship 
between increased dose and bleeding risk in this population, in spite of the paradoxical results in the 
moderate renal impairment sub-group.
In the response to the D120 LoQs subgroup analyses supported the use of the DE 150 mg dosage in 
patients  with  moderate  renal  failure  (i.e.  lowering  the  dosage  of  DE  did  not  decrease  the  rate  of 
bleedings), however caution should be envisaged for patients in concomitant high risk of bleeding. 
Body  weight:  Increased  rates  of  MBEs  by  decreasing  body  weight  were  observed  in  all  treatment 
groups.  The  interaction  was  however,  insignificant.  In  the  response  to  the  D120  LoQ  sub-group 
analyses were provided supporting the use of DE150 also in patients with bodyweight below 60 kg. 
Gender: the risk of MBEs was not influenced by gender.
INR  control:  Not  surprisingly  the  yearly  MBE  rate  in  warfarin  treated  patients  was  higher  if  INR  was 
poorly  controlled.  When  MBE  rates  where  further analysed  by  centre  time  in  therapeutic  range  (TTR) 
the  yearly  MBE  rate  was  higher  for  DE150  mg  bid  vs.  Warfarin  for  centres  with  TTR  ≥  70%.  Please 
refer to safety section for further discussion.   
Other adverse events
The  most  frequently  occurring  AEs  (in  MedDRA  preferred  terms)  for  DE  110  bid,  DE  150  bid,  and 
warfarin subjects  were  dyspnoea  (8.3%,  8.7%,  and  9.2%,  respectively),  dizziness  (7.6%,  7.6%,  and 
9.3%),  and  oedema  peripheral  (7.5%,  7.3%,  and  7.6%),  in  which  warfarin  subjects  had  the  highest 
incidence in all cases.
55
DE  110bid  and  150bid treated  subjects  had  the  highest  incidence  of  gastrointestinal  AEs  (34.6%  and 
34.5%, vs. 24.1% for warfarin). Diarrhoea, dyspepsia, and nausea were the most frequently reported 
GI AEs, all of which were reported at a higher frequency with the DE groups, particularly for dyspepsia 
(6.2%,  5.7%,  and  1.4%  for  DE  110bid,  DE  150bid,  and  warfarin,  respectively).  There  was  no 
consistent  dose-response relationship  with  respect to  GI  AEs.  A  thorough  discussion  was  provided  by 
the MAH in the response to the D120 LoQs on the increased risk of GI AEs as well as of GI bleedings 
associated with DE treatment. Though, the rates of  dyspepsia were higher in  both DE groups vs. the 
warfarin  group,  this  finding  seemed  not  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  GI  bleedings  in  the  DE 
groups vs. the warfarin group. In contrast, the risk of GI bleeding seemed disproportionately higher for 
DE150 bid vs. Warfarin in patients on “on PPI only during study”. Caution should be given for patients 
on PPI and  H2-blockers upon initiation of DE treatment as well as for patients on DE who experience 
symptoms or signs necessitating initiation of PPI or  H2-blocker treatment. The lower dose of DE may 
be appropriate in these cases.
Currently,  based  on  the  available  data  no  specific  conclusions  can  be  drawn  on  the  causal  relation 
between DE treatment and GI AEs and GI bleedings. Further data analysis regarding dyspepsia will be 
implemented in the ongoing RELY-ABLE trial. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP.
The  severity  of  AEs  was  comparable  between  treatment  groups  with  the  majority  of  AEs  being 
classified as mild or moderate. However, a greater percentage of subjects in the DE groups had GI AEs 
that  were  considered  severe  in  intensity  compared  with  warfarin  (5.0%,  5.5%,  and  4.2%  for  DE 
110bid, DE 150bid, and warfarin, respectively).
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events
In  the  RE-LY  study,  all  outcomes  of  death  were  adjudicated  for  cause  of  death. Dabigatran  treated 
subjects had the lowest incidence of deaths (7.4%, 7.2%, and 8.1% for DE 110 bid, DE 150 bid, and 
warfarin, respectively). Approximately 60% of deaths were vascular in  nature. Within the category of 
vascular deaths, slightly more than half were cardiovascular deaths (sudden/arrhythmic death or pump 
failure  death).  The  overall  rate  of  other  vascular  deaths  was  slightly  higher  for  warfarin compared  to 
both  dabigatran  groups  (1.7%,  1.5%,  and  2.1%  for  DE  110  bid,  DE  150  bid  and  warfarin, 
respectively). Non-vascular  deaths  were  balanced  across  treatment  groups.  These  included  cancer, 
respiratory failure, trauma, infection and other. Of the 1371 deaths observed in the trial (randomized 
set), 366 subjects had an adverse event with a fatal outcome (safety set). The incidence of fatal AEs 
was  generally  similar  between  treatment  groups  (2.0%,  1.8%,  and  2.3%  for  DE  110,  DE  150,  and 
warfarin,  respectively).  Pneumonia  and  cardiac  failure  were  the  most  frequent  fatal  AEs  during  the 
study  (0.1%  to  0.2%).  Sudden  cardiac  death  was  slightly  more  frequent  in  DE  110  than  in  the 
remaining  groups  and  4  fatal  hepatic  failures  (N=3  for  warfarin;  N=1  for  DE  110bid)  were  reported.
The reported incidence of SAEs was similar across all treatment groups (21.2%, 21.3%, and 22.6% for 
DE  110  bid,  DE  150  bid,  and  warfarin,  respectively).  SAEs  were  generally  similar  for  dabigatran  and 
warfarin  subjects. The  most  frequently  reported  SAEs  were  cardiac  failure  congestion  (1.4%,  1.0%, 
and  1.2%  for  DE  110  bid,  DE  150  bid,  and  warfarin  groups,  respectively),  pneumonia  (1.2%,  1.2%, 
and  1.0%),  AF  (1.1%,  0.9%,  and  1.2%),  and  cardiac  failure  (0.9%,  1.0%,  and  1.1%).    Two  hepatic 
lesions  (one  in  each  DE  groups)  were  reported,  however,  based  on  data  provided  in  the  response  to 
the D120 LoQs no association to DE treatment seemed evident. In terms of SOCs the most frequently 
occurring were cardiac disorders, infections and infestations, and GI-disorders. 
56
Laboratory findings
Treatment  with  DE  did  not  seem  to  be  associated  with  any  statistical  significant  or  clinically  relevant 
alteration in liver function tests. In the response to the D120 LoQs the low hepatotoxicity potential of 
dabigatran  was  confirmed.  Changes  in  haematological  parameters  were  consistent  with  bleeding 
events in the three treatment arms. 
Other findings related to safety
The  incidence  of  MI  was  numerically  increased  for  dabigatran  treated  subjects  compared  to  warfarin 
treated subjects. The higher frequency of MI compared to warfarin persisted regardless of at least one 
use  of  ASA, clopidogrel,  ASA+clopidogrel,  verapamil, diltiazem  and  beta  blocker. The  incidence  of  MI 
did not differ by age, gender, weight or region, except in Asia. However, the incidence of MI was low 
and  similar  across  all  treatment  groups.  There  was  a  higher  incidence  of  MI  for  Blacks  treated  with 
warfarin (2.47%) or dabigtran 150 mg bid (2.49%) compared with those treated with dabigatran 110 
mg bid (0%); however, the sample size in these groups was low (N= 52-67) in the treatment arms.
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions
Anticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregation agents
The  following  treatments  have  not  been  studied  and  may  increase  the  risk  of  bleeding  when  used 
concomitantly  with  dabigatran:  UFH,  low  molecular  weight  heparins (LMWH),  and  heparin  derivatives 
(fondaparinux, desirudin), thrombolytic agents, GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, ticlopidine, prasugrel, 
dextran,  sulfinpyrazone,  rivaroxaban,  and  vitamin  K  antagonists. UFH  can  be  administered  at  doses 
necessary to maintain a patent central venous or arterial catheter.
Clopidogrel:  In  a  phase  I  study  in  young  healthy  male  volunteers,  the  concomitant  administration  of 
dabigatran  etexilate  and  clopidogrel  resulted  in  no  further  prolongation  of  capillary  bleeding  times 
compared to clopidogrel monotherapy. In addition, dabigatran AUCτ,ss and Cmax,ss and the coagulation 
measures for dabigatran effect or the inhibition of platelet aggregation as measure of clopidogrel effect 
remained essentially unchanged comparing combined treatment and the respective mono-treatments. 
With a loading dose of 300 mg or 600 mg clopidogrel, dabigatran AUCτ,ss and Cmax,ss were increased 
by about 30-40 %. 
ASA:  The  effect  of  concomitant  administration  of  dabigatran  etexilate  and  ASA  on  the  risk  of  bleeds 
was  studied  in  patients  with  atrial  fibrillation  in  a  phase  II  study  in  which  a  randomized  ASA 
coadministration  was  applied.  Based  on  logistic  regression  analysis,  co-administration  of  ASA  and 
150 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily may increase the risk for any bleeding from 12 % to 18 % and 
24 % with 81 mg and 325 mg ASA, respectively.
NSAIDs:  NSAIDs  given  for  short-term  perioperative  analgesia  have  been  shown  not  to  be  associated 
with  increased  bleeding  risk  when  given  in  conjunction  with  dabigatran  etexilate.  With  chronic  use 
NSAIDs  increased  the  risk  of  bleeding  by  approximately  50 %  on  both  dabigatran  and  warfarin. 
Therefore, due to the risk of haemorrhage, notably with NSAIDs with elimination half-lives > 12 hours, 
close observation for signs of bleeding is recommended.
LMWH:  The  concomitant  use  of  LMWHs,  such  as  enoxaparin  and  dabigatran  etexilate  has  not  been 
specifically  investigated.  After  switching  from  3-day  treatment  of  once  daily  40 mg  enoxaparin  s.c., 
24 hours after the last dose of enoxaparin the exposure to dabigatran was slightly lower than that after 
administration  of  dabigatran  etexilate  (single  dose  of  220 mg)  alone.  A  higher  anti-FXa/FIIa  activity 
was  observed  after  dabigatran  etexilate  administration  with  enoxaparin  pre-treatment  compared  to 
57
that  after  treatment  with  dabigatran  etexilate  alone.  This  is  considered  to  be  due  to  the  carry-over 
effect of enoxaparin treatment, and regarded as not clinically relevant. Other dabigatran related anti-
coagulation tests were not changed significantly by the pre-treatment of enoxaparin.
Interactions linked to dabigatran etexilate and dabigatran metabolic profile
Dabigatran etexilate and dabigatran are not metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system and have no 
in vitro effects on human cytochrome P450 enzymes. Therefore, related medicinal product interactions 
are not expected with dabigatran.
Transporter interactions
P-gp inhibitors
Dabigatran  etexilate  is  a  substrate  for  the  efflux  transporter  P-gp.  Concomitant  administration  of 
strong P-gp inhibitors (such as amiodarone, verapamil, quinidine, ketoconazole and clarithromycin) is 
expected  to  result  in  increased  dabigatran  plasma  concentrations.  If  not  otherwise  specifically 
described,  close  clinical  surveillance  (looking  for  signs  of  bleeding  or  anaemia) is  required  when 
dabigatran is co-administered with strong P-gp inhibitors. A coagulation test helps to identify patients 
with an increased bleeding risk due to increased dabigatran exposure.
Systemic  ketoconazole,  cyclosporine,  itraconazole  and  tacrolimus  are  contraindicated.  Caution  should 
be  exercised  with  other  strong  P-gp  inhibitors  (e.g.  amiodarone,  quinidine  or  verapamil). 
Ketoconazole:  Ketoconazole  increased  total  dabigatran  AUC0-∞  and  Cmax  values  by  138 %  and  135 %, 
respectively,  after  a  single  dose  of  400 mg,  and  153 %  and  149 %,  respectively,  after  multiple  dosing  of 
400 mg  ketoconazole  once  daily.  The  time  to  peak,  terminal  half-life  and  mean  residence  time  were  not 
affected by ketoconazole. Concomitant treatment with systemic ketoconazole is contraindicated.
Amiodarone: When dabigatran was coadministered with a single oral dose of 600 mg amiodarone, the 
extent and rate of absorption of amiodarone and its active metabolite DEA were essentially unchanged. 
The dabigatran AUC and Cmax were increased by about 60 % and 50 %, respectively. The mechanism 
of  the  interaction  has  not  been  completely  clarified.  In  view  of  the  long  half-life  of  amiodarone  the 
potential for drug interaction may exist for weeks after discontinuation of amiodarone. 
Patients  treated  for  prevention  of  VTEs  after  hip  or  knee  replacement  surgery,  dosing  should  be 
reduced  to  150 mg  taken  once  daily  as  2  capsules of  75 mg  dabigatran  if  they  receive  concomitantly 
dabigatran  etexilate  and  amiodarone.  Close  clinical  surveillance  is  recommended  when  dabigatran 
etexilate  is  combined  with  amiodarone  and  particularly  in  the  occurrence  of  bleeding,  notably  in 
patients having a mild to moderate renal impairment.
Quinidine:  Quinidine  was  given  as  200 mg  dose  every  2nd hour  up  to  a  total  dose  of  1000 mg. 
Dabigatran  etexilate  was  given  twice  daily  over  3  consecutive  days,  on  the  3rd day  either  with  or 
without  quinidine.  Dabigatran  AUCτ,ss  and  Cmax,ss  were  increased  on  average  by  53 %  and  56 %, 
respectively with concomitant quinidine.
Patients  treated  for  prevention  of  VTEs  after  hip  or  knee  replacement  surgery,  dosing  should  be 
reduced  to  150 mg  taken  once  daily  as  2  capsules of  75 mg  dabigatran  if  they  receive  concomitantly 
dabigatran  etexilate  and  quinidine.  Close  clinical  surveillance  is  recommended  when  dabigatran 
etexilate is combined with quinidine and particularly in the occurrence of bleeding, notably in patients 
having a mild to moderate renal impairment.
Verapamil: When dabigatran etexilate (150 mg) was coadministered with oral verapamil, the Cmax and 
AUC  of  dabigatran  were  increased  but  magnitude  of  this  change  differs  depending  on  timing  of 
administration  and  formulation  of  verapamil. The  greatest  elevation  of  dabigatran  exposure  was 
58
observed with the first dose of an immediate release formulation of verapamil administered one hour 
prior to dabigatran etexilate intake (increase of Cmax by about 180 % and AUC by about 150 %). The 
effect was progressively decreased with administration of an extended release formulation (increased 
of  Cmax  by  about  90 %  and  AUC  by  about  70 %)  or  administration  of  multiple  doses  of  verapamil 
(increased  of  Cmax  by  about  60 %  and  AUC  by  about  50 %). Therefore,  close  clinical  surveillance 
(looking  for  signs  of  bleeding  or  anaemia)  is  required  when  dabigatran  is  co-administrered  with 
verapamil. In patients with normal renal function after the hip or knee replacement surgery, receiving 
dabigatran etexilate and verapamil concomitantly, the dose of dabigatran should be reduced to 150 mg 
taken  once  daily  as  2  capsules  of  75 mg.  In  patients  with  moderate  renal  impairment  and 
concomitantly  treated  with  dabigatran  etexilate  and  verapamil,  a  dose  reduction  of  dabigatran  to 
75 mg  daily  should  be  considered.   Close  clinical  surveillance  is  recommended  when  dabigatran 
etexilate is combined with verapamil and particularly in the occurrence of bleeding, notably in patients 
having  a  mild  to  moderate  renal  impairment. There  was  no  meaningful  interaction  observed  when 
verapamil was given 2 hours after dabigatran etexilate (increased of Cmax by about 10 % and AUC by 
about 20 %). This is explained by completed dabigatran absorption after 2 hours.
Clarithromycin:  When  clarithromycin  (500 mg  twice daily)  was  administered together with  dabigatran 
etexliate in healthy voluteers, increase of AUC by about 19 % and Cmax by about 15 % was observed 
without  any  clinical  safety  concern.  However,  in  patients  receiving  dabigatran,  a  clinically  relevant 
interaction  cannot  be  excluded  when  combined  with  clarithromycin.  Therefore,  a  close  monitoring 
should be exercised when dabigatran etexilate is combined with clarithromycine and particularly in the 
occurrence of bleeding, notably in patients having a mild to moderate renal impairment.
The following potent P-gp inhibitors have not been clinically studied but from in vitro results a similar 
effect  as  with  ketoconazole  may  be  expected:  itraconazole,  tacrolimus  and  cyclosporine,  which  are 
contra-indicated.
Neither  clinical  nor  in  vitro  test  results  are  available  for  posaconazole  which  is  not  recommended  for 
concomitant  treatment  with  dabigatran.  Inadequate  clinical  data  are  available  regarding  the  co-
administration of dabigatran and dronedarone, and their co-administration is not recommended.
P-gp inducers
Concomitant  administration  of  a  P-gp  inducer  (such  as  rifampicin,  St  Johns  wort  (Hypericum 
perforatum), carbamazepin, or phenytoin) is expected to result in decreased dabigatran concentrations 
and should be avoided.
Rifampicin: Pre-dosing of the probe inducer rifampicin at a dose of 600 mg once daily for 7 days decreased 
total dabigatran peak and total exposure by 65.5 and 67 %, respectively. The inducing effect was diminished 
resulting in dabigatran exposure close to the reference by day 7 after cessation of rifampicin treatment. No 
further increase in bioavailability was observed after another 7 days.
Other drugs affecting P-gp
Protease  inhibitors  including  ritonavir  and  its  combinations  with  other  protease  inhibitors  affect  P-gp 
(either as inhibitor or as inducer). They have not been studied and are therefore not recommended for 
concomitant treatment with dabigatran.
P-gp substrate
Digoxin:  In  a  study  performed  with  24  healthy  subjects,  when  dabigatran  was  coadministered  with 
digoxin,  no  changes  on  digoxin  and  no  clinical  relevant  changes  on  dabigatran  exposure  have  been 
observed.
59
Pantoprazole:  When  dabigatran  was  coadministered  with  pantoprazole,  a  decrease  in  the  dabigatran 
area  under  the  plasma  concentration-time  curve  of  approximately  30 %  was  observed.  Pantoprazole 
and other proton-pump inhibitors were co-administered with dabigatran in clinical trials and no effects 
on bleeding or efficacy were observed.
Ranitidine:  Ranitidine  administration  together  with  dabigatran  had  no  clinically  relevant  effect  on  the 
extent of absorption of dabigatran.
Discontinuation due to adverse events
Discontinuations due to AEs occurred more frequently in both DE groups (DE150 bid 20.5%, DE 110bid 
19.0%)  compared  to  the  warfarin  group  (15.7%).  Discontinuations  due  to  GI  disorders  were  most 
frequent  (DE150  bid  6.9%,  DE  110bid  6.5%,  warfarin  3.9%),  followed  by  cardiac  disorders,  nervous 
system  disorders  and  renal  and  urinary  disorders.  They  were  all  slightly  more  frequent  in  the  DE 
groups. Subjects treated with DE 150 bid had a higher risk of discontinuation due to MBEs compared 
with  DE  110  bid  and  warfarin  subjects  for  the  first  18  months  of  treatment.  After  this  time,  the  risk 
was generally similar, although there were fewer subjects in the study after this time. Subjects treated 
with DE 110 bid or warfarin had a similar risk of discontinuation due to MBEs for the first 18 months of 
treatment,  after  which  the  risk  was  higher  with  warfarin  treatment.  No  antidote  is  available  for 
neutralisation of the anti-thrombotic properties of DE treatment. Therefore, the risk of bleeding was an 
issue of concern for patients in need of acute surgical interventions. In the response to the D120 LoQs 
the MAH provided reassuring data indicating that the rate of outcome events (stroke/SEE, MBE, minor 
bleedings  or death)  in  subjects  with  interruption  of anticoagulant  therapy  for emergency  surgery and 
procedures were similar between DE (110mg and 150mg) and warfarin.
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety
The  safety  evaluation  is  mainly  based  on  the  RELY  study  with  approximately  18.000  subjects.  The 
number  of  subjects  exposed  to  DE  and  the  duration  of  exposure  to  DE  are  considered  sufficient  for 
safety evaluation. The primary safety endpoint was major bleeding events (MBE). Overall the definition 
of MBEs and life-threatening bleeding events used in the RE-LY study are considered acceptable. The 
yearly  event  rates  of  major  bleeds  (MBE)  were  2.87%,  3.32%  and  3.57%  for  DE  110bid,  DE  150bid 
and warfarin, respectively with absolute reductions vs. warfarin of 0.70% and 0.25%, respectively. The 
risk  of  major  bleeds  was  significantly  lower  for  DE  110bid  and  numerically  lower  for  DE  150bid  vs. 
warfarin (HRs of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.93; p=0.0026) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.81, 1.07; p=0.3146). The 
risk was also significantly lower for DE 110 mg bid compared to DE 150 bid (HR=0.86 (95% CI: 0.75, 
1.00;  p=0.0429).  When  MBEs  were  analysed  by  baseline  demographics,  only  age  had  statistical 
significant impact. 
For  patients  aged  ≥  75  years  the  risk  of  a  MBE  was  higher  for  DE150  bid  than  for  warfarin  (4.44%, 
5.12%  and  4.39%/year  for  DE110  bid,  DE150  bid  and  warfarin,  respectively,  HR  DE150  bid  vs. 
warfarin  =  1.18;  95%  CI:  0.98,  1.43).  Due  to  the  general  fragility  of  the  elderly  population  the 
increased rate of MBEs is worrisome. Still, the effect of DE on other endpoints also has to be taken into 
account:  The  rates  of  stroke/SEE  were  1.89%,  1.43%  and  2.15%/year  and  the  rates  of    ICH  were 
0.37%,  0.40%  and  1.00%/year  for  DE110  bid,  DE150  bid  and  warfarin,  respectively).  The  HRs  for 
DE150 bid vs. warfarin and DE110 bid vs. warfarin for net clinical benefit (NCB: composite of stroke, 
SEE, PE, acute MI, all cause death and MBE were  similar for patients ≥ 75 years (both close to 1). A 
favourable  effect  of  DE110  bid  vs.  warfarin  was  observed  on  stroke/SEE  and  ICH,  in  addition,  the 
death rates are similar between treatments (DE 110 5.22%, DE150 5.12% and, warfarin 5.13%/year). 
However the benefit on stroke/SEE  was less pronounced than for DE150 bid.  Thus, for patients ≥ 75 
60
years (please refer to discussion on patients ≥ 80 years below) 68 MBE (out of 10000 patients) would 
be  avoided  with  DE110  bid,  but  46  additional  strokes/SEEs  would  be  experienced  compared  with 
DE150  bid.  Thus,  DE110  bid  should  not  be  systematically  recommended  to  patients  between  75-80 
years.  DE110  bid  should  be  individually  envisaged  in  at  risk  patients,  since  the  bleeding  rates  were 
decreased with this dosage in patients ≥ 75 years. This is reflected in the SmPC.
For patients ≥ 80 years the HRs for both dosages of DE vs. warfarin on NCB were similar and in favour 
of  warfarin  (DE110  bid  =  1.12  (95%  CI:  0.93,  1.36);  DE150  bid  =  1.13  (95%  CI:  0.94,  1.35)).  The 
rates  of  MBE  in  DE  treated  patients  ≥  80  accounted  for  the  unfavourable  effect  on  NCB  (DE  110 
5.25%, DE150 6.24% and warfarin 4.70%/year). The increased rate of MBE  was however not due to 
an increased rate of devastating ICHs (DE110 bid 0.32%, DE150 bid 0.69% and warfarin 1.31%/year). 
Based  on  almost  comparable  NCB  between  DE  150  and  110  and  a  maintained  favourable  effect  on 
Stroke/SEE  (1.88%,  1.78%  and  2.72%  for  DE110  bid,  DE150  bid  and  warfarin)  and  ICH  (0.32%, 
0.69%  and  1.31%  for  DE110  bid,  DE150  bid  and  warfarin)  the  lower  dose  of  DE  seems  most 
appropriate  for  the  elderly  ≥  80  years  of  age  in  order  to  bring  down  the  risk  of  MBEs:  10  additional 
stroke/SEE  would  be  experienced  compared  to  DE  150bid  however,  99  MBE  and  37  ICH  would  be 
avoided with DE 110bid compared to DE 150bid.
For  the  elderly  patients  ≥  85  years,  data  being  limited  (approx.  250  per  treatment  arm),  conclusion 
should be drawn cautiously. However, the same beneficial pattern seems to exist for the low dosage of 
DE also for this subgroup.
Based  on  the MAH’s  analyses  of  stroke/SEE  and  MBE  in  subjects  with  different  degrees  of  renal 
dysfunction,  a  reduction  of  the  DE  dosage  seems  not  necessary.  In  patients  with  moderate  renal 
dysfunction  (CrCL  30-<50  ml/min)  the  rates  of  MBE  were  higher  for  DE110  bid  vs.  DE150  bid  group 
and  comparable  to  warfarin  group.  Thus,  DE150  bid  had  the  lowest  MBE  rate.  As  for  the  primary 
endpoint, the rates were less for both DE doses vs. warfarin and the corresponding HRs for DE110 bid 
and  DE150  bid  vs.  warfarin were  below  1.  However, due  to  a  higher  exposure  to  DE  in  patients  with 
moderate  renal  failure,  caution  is  advised  for  patients  at  concomitant  high  risk  of  bleeding. Patients 
with  severe  renal  dysfunction  with  CrCL  <  30  ml/min  were  excluded  from  the  study  and  the  existing 
contraindication for these patients must therefore also apply to the applied AF indication.
When MBE were analysed by time in therapeutic range (TTR) the rates of MBE associated with warfarin 
treatment  for  the  overall  population  decreased with  increasing  TTR.  For  centres  with  TTR  ≥  70%  the 
MBE  rates  were  marginally  higher  for  DE150  bid  than  for  warfarin  (2.90%,  3.32%  and  3.04%  for 
DE110  bid,  DE  150  bid  and  warfarin,  respectively).  Still,  for  this  population  the  rates  of  stroke/SEE, 
stroke/SEE/death and ICH (rates for ICH were remarkably reduced in the DE groups (0.19%, 0.21%, 
0.77%  for  DE110  bid,  DE  150  bid  and  warfarin,  respectively))  were  in  favour  of  DE150  bid  when 
compared to warfarin. Thus, due to the devastating effects of ICH the B/R of DE150 bid vs. warfarin is 
positive also when compared to well controlled warfarin treated subjects.
For  the  elderly  ≥  75  years  however,  the  pattern  in  MBE  noted  for  the  overall  study  population  with 
TTR>70% appeared even more pronounced (4.26%, 5.14% and 3.58% for DE110 bid, DE150 bid and 
warfarin respectively), the difference of DE150 bid vs. warfarin being statistically significant. The rates 
of  the  secondary  endpoints  stroke/SEE/death,  MBE  and  NCB  were  numerically  lowest  in  warfarin 
treated patients vs. both DE dosages. The rate of the primary endpoint (stroke/SEE) was numerically 
lowest  in  the  DE150  bid  group  (1.74%,  1.63%  and  1.76%  for  DE110  bid,  DE150  bid  and  warfarin 
respectively). 
For patients with moderate renal impairment, MBE where lowest in warfarin treated subjects with TTR 
≥  70%  (5.44,  5.23  and  4.18%  for  DE110  bid,  DE150  bid  and  warfarin,  respectively).  However,  for 
other endpoints (stroke/SEE, stroke/SEE/death, NCB and ICH) the rates were in favour of DE150 bid. 
61
Concomitant  use  of  ASA  had  a  clear  influence  on  the  yearly  rate  of  MBE  (rate  of  MBEs  was  nearly 
doubled  regardless  of  treatment  in  all  treatment  groups).  This  was  also  noted  for  the  other 
antithrombotic  therapies,  COX  2  inhibitor  and  other  NSAID.  Also  mild  and  moderate  renal  function, 
decreased body weight and increase number in stroke risk factors (CHADS2 score) increased the risk 
of MBE regardless of treatment. Thus, the favourable effect of DE150 bid was unaltered for these sub-
groups.
Statistically  significant  risk  reductions  for  both  DE110  bid  and  DE150  bid  vs.  warfarin  were  observed 
for adjudicated haemorrhagic strokes (absolute reductions in yearly rates: 0.26% and 0.28%; relative
reductions 69% and 74%,  p= 0.0001 and <0.0001), ICH (absolute reductions in yearly rates: 0.53% 
and  0.44%;  relative  reductions  70%  and  59%,  p<0.0001  for  both)  and  life-threatening  bleedings 
(absolute reductions in yearly rates: 0.61% and 0.36%; relative reductions 33% and 20%, p=0.0001
and 0.0305). For” time to first haemorrhagic stroke” and “time to first intracranial haemorrhage” both 
DE Kaplan-Meier curves separated from warfarin after 1-3 months of treatment. For “time to first life-
threatening bleed” the DE110 bid curve separated after 3 months- and the DE150 bid curve separated 
after  approximately  12  months  of  treatment.  The  effect  of  both  DE  dosages  on  ICH  was  remarkably 
consistent  across  a  wide  range  of  sub-groups  ((i.e.  age,  body  weight,  centre  INR,  +/-  use  of 
concomitant ASA).
In addition to the generally increased risk of bleeding in the elderly population, the above-mentioned 
safety outcomes are also somewhat offset by opposing effects on gastrointestinal bleedings. Based on 
the data provided in the response to the D120 LoQs a clear association between DE-treatment and GI-
bleeding  seem  to  exist.  The  yearly  event  rates  of  GI  MBEs  were  higher  for  DE110  bid  (1.14%)  and 
DE150 bid 1.57%) when compared to warfarin (1.07%) resulting in a statistically significant increased 
risk for DE150 bid vs. warfarin (HR=1.47 (95% CI:  1.17, 1.85; p=0.0008). A  clear separation of the 
DE150  bid  Kaplan-Meier  curve  was  apparent  after  just  a  few  days  of  treatment.  The  separation 
remained throughout the study. This significantly increased risk also included GI life-threatening MBEs 
and  “any  GI  bleeds”.  The  observed  GI  MBEs  were  dose  dependent.  The  risk  of  GI  MBEs  is  highly 
correlated to age (please refer to discussion above on dosage in the elderly population). 
For  the  overall  population  the  risk  of  GI  major  bleeding  while  on  DE  is  outweighed  by  the  benefits 
obtained on stroke/SEE and in particular on ICH. The frequency of ICH is lower for both DE doses for 
all  age  groups.  Though  the  absolute  difference  in  ICH  was  low,  the  clinical  relevance  is  considered 
significant  due  to  the  most  often  devastating  consequences  of  ICH.  The  risk  of  GI-bleedings  is
mentioned  in  the  SmPC.  For  the  sub-group  of  patients  on  "PPI  only  during  treatment"  6.2%,  10.2% 
and 8.2% experienced a major GI bleeding on DE 110bid, DE 150bid and warfarin, respectively. It is 
likely  that  caution  should  be  given  for  patients  on  PPI  upon  initiation  of  DE  treatment  as  well  as  for 
patients  on  DE  who  experience  symptoms  or  signs  necessitating  initiation  of  PPI  treatment.  Data 
provided  in  the  D180  LoOIs  proved  reassuring  effect  of  both  dosages  of  DE  on  stroke/SEE,  ICH  and 
deaths for these subgroups. The lower dose of DE  may be appropriate in these cases as 400 GI MBE 
(pr. 10.000 patients) could be avoided on DE 110 bid compared to DE 150 bid. 
No antidote is available for neutralisation of the anti-thrombotic properties of DE treatment. This is a 
matter of concern for DE treated patients undergoing acute surgical interventions. In the response to 
the  D120  LoQs  the  MAH  provided  reassuring  data  indicating  that  the  rate  of  outcome  events 
(stroke/SEE, MBE, minor bleedings or death) in subjects with interruption of anticoagulant therapy for 
emergency surgery and procedures were similar between DE (110mg and 150mg) and warfarin. With 
respect to the incidence of AEs in general, the safety of DE 110bid and DE 150bid was comparable to 
warfarin.  The  most  frequently  occurring  AEs  were  dyspnoea  (8.3%,  8.7%  and  9.2%  for  DE110  bid, 
DE150  bid,  and  warfarin,  respectively),  dizziness  (7.6%,  7.6%,  and  9.3%),  and  oedema  peripheral 
(7.5%,  7.3%,  and  7.6%),  in  which  warfarin  subjects  had  the  highest  incidence  in  all  cases.  An 
62
exception  was  however,  GI  AEs  for  which  the  DE  treatment  groups  had  higher  frequencies  than 
warfarin (DE110 bid: 34.6%; DE150 bid: 34.5%; warfarin: 24.1%). Diarrhoea, dyspepsia, and nausea 
were the most frequently reported GI AEs. The risk for dyspepsia with DE appeared during the first few 
weeks  of  treatment  and  remained  doubled  compared  to  warfarin  throughout  the  study.  Though,  the 
rates  of  dyspepsia  were  higher  in  both  DE  groups  vs.  warfarin,  this  finding  as  such  seemed  not 
associated with an increased risk of GI bleedings in the DE groups vs. the warfarin group. Deaths were 
slightly  higher  in  the  warfarin  group  (8.1%  vs.  7.2%  and  7.4%  in  the  DE150  bid  and  DE110  bid 
treatment  groups),  mainly  due  to  a  higher  frequency  of  “other  vascular  deaths”,  but  appeared 
otherwise  overall  comparable  between  the  treatment  groups.  Approximately  60%  of  all  deaths  were 
vascular  deaths  (the  majority  hereof  CV  deaths),  the  remaining  were  non-vascular  deaths.  The 
incidence of AEs with fatal outcome was overall comparable between the treatment groups.
Serious adverse events occurred with a similar incidence in all treatment groups and were consistent 
with  an  elderly  AF  population.  The  most  frequently  reported  SAEs  were  cardiac  failure  congestion 
(1.4%,  1.0%,  and  1.2%  for  DE110  bid,  DE150  bid,  and  warfarin  groups,  respectively),  pneumonia 
(1.2%, 1.2%, and 1.0%), AF (1.1%, 0.9%, and 1.2%), and cardiac failure (0.9%, 1.0%, and 1.1%).
As discussed in the efficacy section, patients treated with DE had a numerically increased risk of MIs 
(DE 150 mg bid vs. warfarin: 1.27 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.71; p=0.1240; DE 110 mg bid vs. warfarin: 1.29
(95%  CI:  0.96,  1.75;  p=0.0929).).  As  regards  interactions,  concerns  of  increased  bleeding  risk  are 
raised with concomitant medications with P-gp inhibitors or other antithrombotic therapies (clopidogrel, 
ASA).  Adequate  warnings  in  the  corresponding  sections  of  the  SmPC  (4.2.,  4.4.,  and  4.5.)  were 
introduced on each concomitant drug.
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety
The  risk  of  major  bleeds  was  significantly  lower  for  patients  randomised  to  DE  110 bid  vs.  patients 
randomised to  warfarin. A  qualitatively  similar  signal,  albeit  not  statistically  significant,  was  observed 
for patients randomised to treatment with DE150 bid. The main localisations of MBE were intracranial 
for  warfarin  and  gastrointestinal  for  dabigatran.  When  looking  into  the  components  of  MBEs  both  DE 
dosages  significantly  decreased  the  risk  for  haemorrhagic  strokes,  life-threatening  bleedings  and  ICH 
vs.  warfarin.  Not  unexpectedly,  the  outcome  associated  with  warfarin  improves  with  increasing  TTR. 
The  presented  analyses  clearly  demonstrated  that  the  benefits  of  DE  vs.  warfarin  diminished  if  INR 
control  was  good  with  TTR  >70%.  This  seemed  particularly  true  for  patients  > 75  years  -  in  these 
patients  MBE  and  NCB  were  numerically  highest  in  the  DE  treatment  groups.  Notwithstanding  these 
observations  ICH  were  consistently  lowest  in  the  DE  treatment  groups.  Some  major  safety  concerns 
have been identified in the DE groups, which are mainly related to risk of bleeding in the elderly, the 
risk of GI bleedings and myocardial infarction. These safety issues have been discussed by the MAH in 
the  response  to  the  D120LoQs  and  were  solved  by  appropriate  SmPC  wording:  due  to  the  general 
fragility  of  the  elderly  population  the  increased  rates  of  MBEs  and  GI-bleedings  are  worrisome.  The 
NCBs (composite of stroke, SEE, PE, acute MI, all cause death and MBE) of DE110 bid and DE150 bid 
were not in favour of DE for patients ≥ 80 years. This was primarily due to an increased incidence of 
GI bleedings. Based on a favourable effect of DE110 bid vs. warfarin on stroke/SEE and in particular on 
ICH and a reduced risk of MBE for DE110 bid vs. DE 150 bid a dose reduction to 110 mg seems to be 
appropriate  for  the  elderly  ≥  80  years of  age.  The  same  dose  recommendation seems  acceptable  for 
the very elderly ≥ 85 years though the data are more limited in this sub-group of very elderly. DE110 
bid should not be systematically recommended to patients between 75-80 years. DE110 bid should be 
individually envisaged in at risk patients, since the bleeding rates were decreased with this dosage in 
those patients.


The  MAH  shall  provide  an  educational  pack  for  each  therapeutic  indication,  targeting  all 
physicians  who  are  expected  to  prescribe/use  Pradaxa.  This  educational  pack  is  aimed  at 
68
increasing  awareness  about  the  potential  risk  of  bleeding  during  treatment  with  Pradaxa  and 
providing guidance on how to manage that risk.

The  MAH  must  agree  the  content  and  format  of  the  educational  material,  together  with  a 
communication  plan,  with  the  national  competent  authority  prior  to  distribution  of  the 
educational pack.  The educational pack must be available for distribution for both therapeutic 
indications  prior  to  the  launch  of  the  new  indication  (prevention  of  stroke  and  systemic 
embolism in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with one or more risk factors) in 
the Member State.

The physician educational pack should contain:
-
-
-
The Summary of Product Characteristics
Prescriber Guide
Patient Alert Cards 

The Prescriber Guide should contain the following key safety messages:
- Details of populations potentially at higher risk of bleeding
- Recommendations for dose reduction in at risk populations
- Management of overdose situations 
- The use of coagulation tests and their interpretation
- That all patients should be provided with a Patient alert card and be counselled about:

2.8.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits

Beneficial effects
The  pivotal  trial,  RELY  (1160.26),  compared  dabigatran  with  the  current  standard  warfarin  for  the 
prevention  of  stroke  and  systemic  embolism  in  adult  patients  with  non-valvular  atrial  fibrillation.  A 
relevant patient population including patients with considerable cardiovascular comorbidities, advanced 
age,  reduced  renal  function,  stroke  risk  profiles,  and  concurrent  medications  has  been  enrolled.  In 
contrast  to  recent  AF  trials  (SORTIF  III  and  IV,  ACTIVE-W,  AMADEUS)  patients  were  balanced  as 
regards  their  previous  VKA  use.  Superiority  of  DE150 bid  vs.  warfarin  was  demonstrated  for  the 
primary  endpoint  “time  to  first  occurrence  of  stroke/SEE”,  and  non-inferiority  was  demonstrated  for 
69
DE110  bid  vs.  warfarin. The  Kaplan  Meier  curves  suggest  that  the  effect is  consistent  over time.  The 
primary  endpoint  was  driven  by  strokes;  systemic  embolisms  (SSE)  were  very  rare  in  all  treatment 
groups.  Approximately  half  of  all  strokes  were  disabling,  with  no  significant  differences  between 
treatment  groups. Haemorrhagic  strokes  and  intracranial  haemorrhages  (ICH),  though  overall  rare, 
were  considerably  reduced  for  either  dose  of  dabigatran  compared  to  warfarin.  The  benefit  of  both 
dabigatran dosages vs. warfarin on ICH was remarkably consistent across a large variety of subgroups 
(i.e. age, body weight, centre INR, +/- use of concomitant ASA). Also for the secondary endpoints, the 
composites of “stroke, SEE and all cause death”, as well as “stroke, SEE, PE,  MI and vascular death” 
DE150 bid  was  superior  to  warfarin.  As  described  below,  some  of  the  components  of  the  latter 
composite were, however, in favour of warfarin. Not unexpectedly, the quality of warfarin treatment as 
expressed by the time in therapeutic range (TTR) influences the comparisons between dabigatran and 
warfarin. The outcome of warfarin treatment improved with increasing TTR and the presented analyses 
clearly demonstrated that the benefits observed in the comparison of dabigatran to warfarin diminished 
if INR  control was good with TTR >70%. This was reflected in Section 5.1 of  the SmPC. Still, for the 
overall population as well as for patients ≥ 75 years of age DE150 bid appeared more attractive with 
respect to the primary endpoint (prevention of stroke/SEE) when compared to warfarin at centres with 
TTR >70%. DE110 bid appeared comparable to warfarin in this case.
Choice of dabigatran dosages: Two DE dosages of 110 mg bid and 150 mg bid have been proposed by 
the MAH for this extension of indication. The overall results demonstrated an overall positive benefit for 
both  dosages  on  the  primary  composite  efficacy  endpoint  (stroke/systemic  embolism)  and  safety 
(decrease or similar overall bleedings) compared to warfarin. Age factor is of paramount importance as 
in  real  life,  elderly  patients  will  certainly  constitute  the  main  target  population  of  non  valvular  AF 
patients.  Despite  higher  bleeding  rates  on  DE  in  elderly  ≥  75  years,  DE110  bid  should  not  be 
systematically  recommended  to  patients  between  75-80  years  as  the  effect  of  DE110  bid  on 
stroke/SEE is lower than DE150 bid (but still favourable vs. warfarin). Thus, for patients ≥75 years of 
age  68  MBE  and  3  ICH  (out  of  10000  patients)  would  be  avoided  with  DE110,  but  46  additional 
strokes/SEEs  would  be  experienced  compared  with  DE150.  It  was  concluded  that  DE110  bid  can  be 
individually  envisaged  in  at  risk  patients,  since  the  bleeding  rates  are  decreased  with  this  dosage  in 
patients ≥ 75 years. In contrast for patients ≥ 80 years, DE110 bid seems to be the appropriate dose: 
ten  additional  stroke/SEE  would  be  experienced  however  99  MBE  and  37  ICH  would  be  avoided  with 
DE110 bid compared to DE150 bid. Data for the elderly ≥ 85 years are more limited. With DE110 bid 
53  more  stroke/SEE  would  be  observed  but  128  MBE  and  63  ICH  would  be  avoided  as  compared  to 
DE150  bid.  Though  the  overall  death  rates  were  higher  in  very  elderly  treated  with  dabigatran  as 
compared  to  warfarin  (DE110 bid: 11.13%;  DE150 bid:  9.25%;  warfarin:  7.95%)  the  frequency  of 
vascular  death  was  similar  between  the  3  groups  (DE110 bid: 5.33%;  DE  150 bid:  4.73%;  warfarin: 
4.64%).  The rates of overall death should also been seen in the context of the benefit of DE 110bid on 
often debilitating strokes and ICH in these very elderly patients.
Despite slightly higher exposure of DE in patients with moderate renal impairment, low body weight or 
patients of female gender no dose reduction is considered necessary for the overall population. 
The risk of major bleeds was significantly lower for DE110 bid treated patients vs. patients treated with 
warfarin  (HR  0.80  (95%  CI:  0.70,  0.93;  p=0.0026)).  No  significant  difference  was  observed  for  DE 
150bid  treated  patients  (HR  0.93  (95%  CI:  0.81,  1.07;  p=0.3146)).  Nonetheless,  subgroup  analyses 
showed,  that  patients  <75  years  of  age  had  a  significantly  lower  risk  of  major  bleedings  with  either 
dose  of  DE  compared  to  warfarin  (results  on  MBEs  are  based  on  analyses  including  outcome  events 
identified  after  data  base  lock).  The  risk  of  life-threatening  bleedings  and  ICH  were  statistically 
significantly reduced for either dose of DE compared to warfarin. Despite low absolute numbers of ICH, 
70
the benefit of both dabigatran dosages vs. warfarin was remarkably consistent across a large variety of 
subgroups (i.e. age, body weight, centre INR, +/- use of concomitant ASA).
The lack of need for dose adjustments and monitoring during treatment with dabigatran is regarded as 
a benefit vs. warfarin treatment. In addition to the lack of food interactions, dabigatran has a different 
interaction  profile  compared  to  warfarin,  offering  a  treatment  alternative  based  on  patients'  co-
medication.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects.
Study design: In the RELY study, patients and investigators were not blinded to warfarin or dabigatran 
treatments.  Blinding  was  only  kept  as  regards  the  two  doses  of  dabigatran  treatment.  It  cannot  be 
excluded that the unblinded study design may have influenced the outcomes of the study. Appropriate 
measures have been implemented to minimise bias but considering that all evidence rest on only one 
pivotal  study,  inspections  of  the  sponsor,  the  CRO  and  of  two  sites  (in  USA  and  Greece)  were 
conducted.  Another  reason  for  the  inspections  was  some  discrepancies  found  by  the  FDA  in  the 
database of the RELY study. The two critical findings at the sponsor's site were mainly due to lack of 
communication  between  sponsor  and  the  CRO  (which  was  the  PHRI  =  Population  Health  Research 
Institute). The PHRI contract did not specify all the tasks transferred from the MAH. As a consequence 
the  data  quality  was  compromised. Excessive  error  rate  on  study  critical  data  was  identified  by  the 
FDA,  in  particular  severe  transcription  errors  for  INR  values  transferred  from  CRFs  to  data  listings. 
Implementation  of  special  measures  were  required  to  solve  these  data  quality  issues  resulting  in 
extensive re-checks on CRF accuracy, data plausibility and consistency checks (between the CRF and 
database). This has been done and this issue was regarded by the CHMP as resolved. While the study 
was  conducted  perfectly  at  the  inspected  US  site,  from  a  clinical  point  of  view  one  critical  and  one 
major finding identified at the Greek investigator site 901 were considered of importance. Large gaps 
between two consecutive INR controls were identified in some patients despite protocol specified gaps 
of 4 weeks. In addition, INR transcription errors were identified in 5 patients out of 26 patients revised. 
These  findings  had  the  potential  to  disfavour  warfarin  vs.  dabigatran  due  to  potential  reporting  of 
embolic  events  in  patients  with  INR  values  ”out  of  therapeutic  range”  despite  being  reported  in  the 
study  protocol  as  being  in  therapeutic  range.  In  6  of  these  8  cases,  the  investigators  placed  the 
patients in therapeutic range despite being below therapeutic range. In the 2 additional cases, the INR 
was  already  within  therapeutic  range  either  in  the  source  data  or  in  the transcription.  There  were  no 
cases  of  placing  the  INRs  out  of  range  despite  being  within  therapeutic  range.  Hypothetically,  INR 
measurements might be unreliable. It could be argued that this issue is critical in an unblinded study.
However the identified Greek findings did not lead to dose-adjustments of warfarin treatment based on 
wrong INR values, the findings were thus not considered to influence the primary endpoint Stroke/SEE. 
In  response  to  the  D180  LoOIs  the  MAH  provided  clarification  on  the  issue,  and  no  additional 
inspections  of  other  Greek  or  European  sites  or  further  questioning  on  this  issue  were  deemed 
necessary. However, the CHMP concluded that the MAH had not adequately addressed the issue of INR 
transcription  errors  in  patients  on  warfarin  experiencing  major  events.  Therefore,  the  MAH  was 
requested  to  provide  a  review  of  the  chain  of  INR  transcriptions  in  all  warfarin  treated  subjects  who 
experienced thromboembolic events, myocardial infarction and intracranial haemorrhage. The MAH has 
thoroughly described the way of collecting source INR data collection and handling of source- and CRF 
INR data. Based on these descriptions the CHMP was of the opinion that there is no reason to believe 
that the errors have biased the results in favour of dabigatran.
For the proposed indication the target population and the pattern of use of dabigatran will completely 
change. The new indication  will include a great majority of elderly patients, with prescriptions mainly 
made  by  general  practioners  or  cardiologists  outside  of  hospital  environment,  with  a  monitoring  that 
could be softened with the time, due to the long-term duration of treatment. The safety consequences 
71
of  these  important  changes  have  been  sufficiently  addressed  by  the  MAH  in  the  clinical  program. 
Appropriate  prescriber  guides  (one  for  both  indications)  and  patient  alert  cards  have  been  drafted. 
Also, a drug utilisation study and post-authorisation studies aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
risk  minimisation  activities  and  to  assess  potential  off-label  use  outside  AF  will  be  conducted  as 
specified in the updated RMP and the LoU.
Risks

Unfavourable effects
The limitation of effective anti-thrombotic therapy is increased risk of bleedings.
Age: Age was a significant factor for MBE.  Whereas patients <75 years had a significantly lower risk of 
MBE with either dose of DE compared to warfarin , the risk for patients aged ≥ 75 years of a MBE was 
approximately  similar  for  DE  110bid  compared  to  warfarin  (HR  1.01  (95%  CI  0.83,  1.23)  but  was 
higher for DE 150bid  vs. warfarin (HR1.18 (95% CI 0.98, 1.43)). Moreover, in very elderly patients > 
85  years  of  age,  an  increased  risk  of  MBEs  was  reported  even  for  the  low  DE  dose  compared  to 
warfarin.  The  risk  of  bleedings  in  the  elderly  is  mitigated  by  dosing  recommendations.  As  for  the 
primary  endpoint  (stroke/SEE)  the  benefit  of  DE  vs.  warfarin  also  decreased  by  improved  warfarin 
treatment and INR-control (TTR> 70%). This was particularly true for the elderly patients aged ≥ 75 
years. The risk of MBE was markedly higher with DE compared to warfarin (yearly rate for DE110 bid 
4.26%,  for  DE150  bid  5.14%  and  for  warfarin  3.58%).  The  advantage  of  well  controlled  warfarin  is 
also reflected in the NCB (composite of stroke, SEE, PE, acute MI, all cause death and MBE) in patients 
aged  ≥  75  years.  However,  a  significant  advantage  of  warfarin  over  DE  is  not  evident  in  any  of  the 
provided subgroup analyses.
GI bleedings and GI AEs: GI bleedings occurred notably more frequent in patients randomised to DE. 
The yearly event rates of GI MBEs were dose dependent for DE (DE110 bid 1.11%, DE150 bid 1.57% 
vs.  1.07%  for  warfarin).  The  increased  risk  for  DE150  bid  vs.  warfarin  was  statistically  significant 
(HR=1.47 (95% CI: 1.17, 1.85; p=0.0008). A clear separation of the DE150 bid Kaplan-Meier curve in 
favour  of  warfarin  was  apparent  after  just  a  few  days  of  treatment.  The  separation  remained 
throughout the study. This significantly increased risk also included GI life-threatening MBEs and “any 
GI bleeds”. For both DE dosages post-hoc sub-group analyses of GI MBE suggested that patients <75 
years  had  lower  risk  of  GI  MBEs  whereas  patients  aged  ≥75  had  a  significantly  higher  risk  with  DE 
150bid  when  compared  to  warfarin.  The  risk  of  GI  bleeding  is  an  issue  of  concern  for  patients  > 75 
years  but  does  not  change  the  overall  risk  benefit  of  dabigatran.  This  safety  issue  necessitated  a 
strong warning in the SmPC, section 4.4. Gastrointestinal adverse events dominated the adverse event 
profile of dabigatran in this indication, mainly represented by dyspepsia, nausea, abdominal pain and 
gastritis.
Myocardial infarctions: Another risk is the numerically increased risk of MI for patients randomised to 
dabigatran when compared to warfarin, although the risk was small in absolute terms (0.81%, 0.82% 
and 0.64% for DE110 bid, DE150 bid and warfarin, respectively). The increased risk of MI associated 
with  DE  (both  dosages)  vs.  warfarin  does  not  seem  to  decrease  over  time.  No  clear  pattern  was 
observed  when  analysed  by  baseline  demographic  characteristics,  stroke  risk  factors,  CHADS2  score, 
AF  type,  baseline  medication  use  or  by  medication  use  during  study  period.  A  dose  response  for  the 
risk of MI could not be confirmed. In order to put MI into perspective of other outcomes, yearly event 
rates  and  absolute  differences  to  warfarin  for  several  patient  sub-groups  with  high  risk  of  MIs  were 
provided (previous MI; history of CAD and age >65 years; diabetes and age >65 years; heart failure; 
LVEF <40%; moderate renal dysfunction). Based on these analyses the benefit of DE on the ultimate 
outcome  of  death,  still  compares  favourably  to  the  increased  risk  of  MI.  The  pathophysiological 
72
mechanism  is  still  unclear  and  markers  that  could  reveal  rebound  anticoagulation  have  not  been 
collected,  but  the  generation  of  hypotheses  is  expected  from  a  further  sub-study  of  RELY  which  is 
pending  (1Q-2Q  of  2011).  The  numerically  increased  risk  of  MI  with  dabigatran  is  not  considered  to 
change  the  net  benefit  of  DE  vs.  warfarin.  Adequate  warning was  introduced  in  section  4.4  of  the 
SmPC. Furthermore, MI is covered as a potential risk in the RMP.
Hepatic  function:  Patients  with  active  liver  disease  (including  patients  with  ALT  or  AST  or  Alk. 
Phosphatase  elevations  2x  upper  limit  of  normal  (ULN))  as  well  as  patients  with  liver  enzyme 
elevations  on  ximelagatran  were  excluded  from  the  RE-LY  study.  In  view  of  the  potentially  lifelong 
treatment  the  follow-up  time  in  the  RELY  trial  was  considered  limited.  A  more  detailed  analysis  was 
performed  by  the  MAH  on  the  events  of  severe  LFT  elevations,  Hy’s  law  cases  and  hepatic  AEs  of 
interest (hepatic lesions, fatal hepatic failure and deaths with LFT elevations). The data confirm the low 
potential of hepatotoxicity of DE.
Patients with GI disorders requiring PPI: For patients “on PPI only during treatment” an increased risk 
for  major  GI  bleed  was  observed  (6.2%,  10.2%  and  8.2%  for  DE  110bid,  DE  150bid  and  warfarin, 
respectively). The risk seemed disproportionately higher for DE 150mg bid vs. warfarin for patients “on 
PPI  only  during  treatment”  compared  to  patients  “never  on  PPI”  and  “on  PPI  at  baseline”.  It  is  likely 
that caution should be given for patients on PPI upon initiation of DE treatment as well as for patients 
on DE who experience symptoms or signs necessitating initiation of PPI treatment. The lower dose of 
DE may be appropriate in these cases.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects
Renal  impairment:  Patients  with  severe  renal  insufficiency  have  not  been  studied  in  RELY. This  is 
already  a  contraindication  for  the  use  of  Pradaxa.  Patients  with  moderate  renal  failure  were  at 
increased  risk  of  bleedings  in  both  treatment  groups  with  no  evidence  of  dose-effect  relationship, 
however, based on clinical data, no dose-reduction is considered necessary in the SPAF indication. 
Pulmonary  embolism:  Apart  from  the  increased  risk  for  MIs,  there  was  also  a  weak  signal  for  an 
increased risk of PE with DE. PE is covered as a potential risk in the RMP.
Body weight: The rate of MBEs increased by decreasing body weight in all treatment groups however, 
there was no obvious impact of weight on the benefit risk of dabigatran vs. warfarin in this indication. 
Biological monitoring test/antidote: An appropriate biological test that display a linear relationship with 
plasma  concentrations,  with  a  high  level  of  sensitivity  and  that  allows  comparisons  between 
laboratories  is  essential  for  drug  monitoring. The  Hemoclot  assay  is  a  diluted  thrombin  time 
coagulation  assay  which  can  be  calibrated  with  lyophilised  dabigatran  standards  for  quantitative 
assessment  of  dabigatran  concentrations  in  plasma.  The  Hemoclot  assay  is  now  available  on  the 
market.
Guidance  has  also  been  provided  in  the  SmPC  on  how  to  handle  DE  before  and  after  surgical 
interventions, in emergency situations and overdosing, and when switching from other anticoagulants 
to DE.
Benefit-risk balance

Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Systemic embolism and in particular strokes are important outcome parameters in prevention therapy 
in  patients  with  non-valvular  AF  due  to  the  most  often  disabling  nature  of  these  events.  Estimated 
annual  incidence  of  stroke  in  the  non-treated  AF  population  ranges  from  2-5%  per  year  in  moderate 
risk  subjects  to  5-10%  per  year  in  high  risk  subjects.  In  view  of  these  considerations  the  clearly 
73
favourable  efficacy  of  DE  vs.  warfarin  on  strokes  across  all  age  groups  including  both  ischaemic 
(constituted the majority of the strokes) and haemorrhagic strokes is considered clinically meaningful. 
The  limitation  of  effective  anti-thrombotic  therapy  is  the  bleeding  risk.  Particularly  the  risk  of  major-
and  life-threatening  bleedings  is  of  importance,  as  this  can  lead  to  a  higher  risk  of  morbidity  and 
death.  The  increased  risk  of  MBE  in  the  elderly  population  ≥  75  years  of  age  for  DE  vs.  warfarin  is 
considered of major clinical relevance due to the fragility of this population. In addition, the risk may 
potentially  affect  the  sub-populations  of  patients  at  high  risk  of  bleeding  or  with  expected  higher 
exposure to DE (e.g. moderate renal failure, female gender, low body weight).
The  risk  of  GI  MBE  bleedings  was  significantly  higher  for  DE  (150  mg)  vs.  warfarin.  In  addition,  an 
increased risk of MIs seems to be associated with DE treatment. These unfavourable findings must be 
counterbalanced against the beneficial effects.
It  should  be  noted  however,  that  life-threatening  bleedings  were  significantly reduced  for  either  dose 
of  DE  compared  to  warfarin.  In  addition,  the  data  presented  on  all-cause  mortality  (analysed  as  a 
secondary  efficacy  endpoint)  are  reassuring.  For  patients  allocated  to  treatment  with  DE110  bid  or 
DE150  bid  the  relative  risk  compared  to  patients  treated  with  warfarin  was  0.91  ((0.80-1.03), 
p=0.1308)  and  0.88  ((0.77-1.00),  p=0.051),  respectively.  The  data  for  vascular  death  were  0.90 
((0.77-1.06), p=0.2081) and 0.85 ((0.72-0.99), p=0.043), respectively.

Benefit-risk balance
The overall risk of strokes has decreased in recent AF trials due to improved treatment of risk factors 
such  as  hypertension  and  heart  failure.  In  view  of  this,  the  reduced  risk  of  stroke/SEE  in  DE150  bid 
treated  patients  vs.  warfarin  treated  patients  is  a  significant  clinical  benefit.  Also  of  clinical  benefit  is 
the  decreased  risk  of  intracranial  haemorrhage,  the  perhaps  most  serious  and  devastating  bleeding 
complication with VKA. Although absolute reductions were small, the relative reductions in comparison 
to warfarin were marked and consistent across a large variety of sub-groups. 
Clinically  important  is  also  the  fact  that  the  favourable  outcome  on  the  primary  efficacy  outcome 
seemed not counterbalanced by an increased risk of major bleeding, at least in patients aged less than 
75  years.  The  increased  risk  of  bleeding  in  the  elderly  ≥  75  years  and  in  particular  ≥  80  years  is
worrisome  due  to  the  fragility  of  this  population.  Specific  dosing  recommendations  are  warranted  for 
this  population  to  mitigate  this  risk.  Warnings  for  patients  at  high  risk  of  bleeding  as  well  as  for 
patients  expected  to  have  higher  exposure  to  DE  (female  gender,  low  body  weight,  moderate  renal 
failure, concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors) have been included in the SmPC.
Dabigatran  was  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  gastrointestinal  bleedings  (including  all  GI 
bleedings, GI MBEs and GI life-threatening bleedings). GI bleedings were associated with concomitant 
medication  with  ASA,  clopidogrel, and  NSAIDs,  additionally  to  GI  disorders  requiring  treatment  with 
PPI  and  H2  blockers.  Moreover,  a  significant  interaction  of  major  GI  bleed  for  age  ≥  75  years  was
observed.  The  risk  of  GI  bleedings  did  not  change  the  overall  benefit  of  DE  vs.  warfarin  and  specific 
dosing  recommendations  for  the  elderly  as  well  as  for  certain  sub-groups  (subjects  with  known 
gastritis,  esophagitis,  or  gastroesophageal  reflux;  subjects  experiencing  gastritis,  esophagitis  or 
gastroesophagial  reflux  while  taking  dabigatran;  patients  treated  with  proton  pump  inhibitors  or  H2 
blockers) were implemented in the SmPC.
The  pathophysiological  mechanism  behind  the  numerically  increased  risk  of  MI  associated  with  DE 
treatment is not understood. Despite the potential serious outcome of such events, the overall benefit 
risk  of  DE  is  not  considered  affected  by  this  finding  due  to  the  beneficial  effect  on  stroke/SEE  and  in 
particular ICH. However, strong warnings have been inserted in the SmPC and MI has been included as 
a potential risk in the RMP.
74
In  addition  to  the  above  discussion,  the  reduced  risk  for  all  cause  death  is  reassuring  though  the 
difference vs. warfarin for either dose of DE was not statistically significant.
It  should  also  be  noted  that  global  INR  control  in  RELY,  although  being  comparable  to  contemporary 
trials in this indication, was not optimal from a Northern/Western European standard. When MBE were
analysed  by  time  in  therapeutic  range  (TTR)  the  outcome  of  warfarin  treatment  for  the  overall 
population improved with increasing TTR. For centres with TTR ≥ 70% the MBE rates were marginally 
higher for DE150 bid vs.  warfarin. Still, for this population the rates of stroke/SEE, stroke/SEE/death 
and ICH were in favour of DE150 bid when compared to warfarin. Thus, due to the devastating effects 
of ICH the B/R of DE150 vs. warfarin is positive also when compared to well controlled warfarin treated 
subjects.
Also  GI  AEs  were  considerably  more  frequent  with  DE  compared  to  warfarin.  These  adverse  events 
may result in poorer compliance and risk of under-treatment. GI AEs occurred with approximately the 
same magnitude in the pivotal VTE prevention trials as in the RELY trial, however, in the VTE program 
they were not more frequent as for the comparator enoxaparin.
2.8.1.  Discussion on the benefit-risk balance
Overall, both efficacy and safety of DE110 bid and warfarin in the prevention of stroke in nonvalvular 
atrial  fibrillation  was  considered  by  the  CHMP  comparable.  The  superior  efficacy  of  DE  150  bid  vs. 
warfarin on primary endpoint (stroke/SEE) and on ICH was considered of major clinical relevance.
Risk management plan
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that: 
Pharmacovigilance  activities  in  addition  to  the  use  of  routine  pharmacovigilance  were  needed  to 
investigate further some of the safety concerns and the following additional risk minimisation activities 
were  required: educational  pack  for  each  therapeutic  indication,  targeting  all  physicians  who  are 
expected to prescribe/use Pradaxa. 
2.9.  Recommendation
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  application,  recommended  the  granting  of  an  extension  of  the 
Marketing  Authorisation  for  the  above  mentioned  medicinal  product  concerning  a  new  strength:  150 
mg.
In addition, CHMP recommends the variations to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning

strength:  Prevention  of  stroke  and  systemic  embolism  in  adult  patients  with  nonvalvular  atrial 
fibrillation with one or more of the following risk factors: Previous stroke, transient ischemic attack, or 
systemic embolism (SEE); left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 %; Symptomatic heart failure, ≥ New 
York  Heart  Association  (NYHA)  Class 2;  Age  ≥ 75 years;  Age  ≥ 65 years  associated  with  one  of  the 
following: diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, or hypertension. 
In  addition  it  concerns  changes  to  the  first  generation  synthesis,  and  the  addition  of  an  alternate 
routes  of  synthesis.  It  further  concerns  changes  to  the  first  generation  synthesis  related  to  the 
specifications and suppliers of starting materials and intermediates, testing of the drug substance and 
specification of the same. The application also concerns a new drug product manufacturing method and 
further changes related to manufacture, in-process controls, testing, specifications and shelf-life of the 
drug product for the registered and the new 150 mg strengths. 
Finally, information addressing FUM 005, related to the development of a new in-process control at the 
isolation step, has been also presented.

As well as the refusal of the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change:
Variation requested
Type
B.II.d.1.e
Change  in  the  specification  parameters  and/or  limits  of  the 
II
finished  product  -  Change  outside  the  approved  specifications 
limits range
Widening  of  the  shelf-life  limits  for  degradation  products  in  the  specification  of  75  mg  and  110  mg 
capsules in PP bottles.
Based on batch results and stability results in both packaging materials the proposed changes in shelf-
life  limits  of  some  related  substances  are  not  justified  from  the  presented  data  on  three  strengths 
manufactured according to the 2nd gen DP process and therefore the proposed change is not accepted.

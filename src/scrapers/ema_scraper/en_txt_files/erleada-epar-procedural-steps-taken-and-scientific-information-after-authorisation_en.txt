greater than or equal to 5 mg/kg/day, mammary 
adenocarcinoma and fibroadenoma at 15 mg/kg/day or 50

interim analysis. The improvement in OS was demonstrated 
even though 39% of patients in the placebo arm crossed 
over to receive Erleada, with a median treatment of 15

Apalutamide caused developmental toxicity when 
administered at oral doses of 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg/day 
throughout the period of organogenesis (gestational days 
6-20) in a preliminary embryofetal developmental toxicity 
study in rats. These doses resulted in systemic exposures 
approximately 2, 4 and 6 times, respectively the exposure 
in humans at the dose of 240 mg/day. Findings included 
non-pregnant females at 100 mg/kg/day and embryofetal 
lethality (resorptions) at doses ≥50 mg/kg/day, decreased 
fetal anogenital distance and a misshapen pituitary gland 
(more rounded shape) at ≥25 mg/kg/day. Skeletal 
variations (unossified phalanges, supernumerary short 
thoracolumbar rib(s) and/or abnormalities of the hyoid) 
were also noted at doses ≥25 mg/kg/day, without resulting 
in an effect on mean fetal weight.

study ARN-509-003 (SPARTAN) showed that treatment with

compared with placebo (HR = 0.784; 95% CI: 0.643, 
0.956; 2-sided p = 0.0161). The median OS was 73.9 
months for the Erleada arm and 59.9 months for the 
placebo arm. The pre-specified alpha boundary (p ≤ 0.046) 
was crossed and statistical significance was achieved. This 
improvement was demonstrated even though 19% of 
patients in the placebo arm received Erleada as subsequent 
therapy. 
Ischaemic cerebrovascular disorders and alopecia have 
been added to the list of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
with frequency common. The existing warning on ischaemic 
heart disease has been amended to include information

be monitored for signs and symptoms of ischaemic heart 
disease and ischaemic cerebrovascular disorders. 
Management of risk factors, such as hypertension, 
diabetes, or dyslipidaemia should be optimised as per

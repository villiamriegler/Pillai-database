CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Fuzeon is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of 
HIV-1 infected patients who have received treatment with and failed on regimens containing at least 
one medicinal product from each of the following antiretroviral classes: protease inhibitors, non-
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, or who have 
intolerance to previous antiretroviral regimens (see section 5.1). 
In deciding on a new regimen for patients who have failed an antiretroviral regimen, careful 
consideration should be given to the treatment history of the individual patient and the patterns of 
mutations associated with different medicinal products. Where available, resistance testing may be 
appropriate (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Fuzeon should be prescribed by physicians who are experienced in the treatment of HIV infection. 
Posology 
Adults and adolescents ≥ 16 years: The recommended dose of Fuzeon is 90 mg twice daily injected 
subcutaneously into the upper arm, anterior thigh or abdomen. 
In case a Fuzeon dose is missed, patients should be instructed to administer the dose as soon as 
possible. However, if it is less than 6 hours before the next regular dose, the missed dose should be 
skipped. 
Elderly: There is no experience in patients > 65 years old.

Fuzeon is not recommended for use in children below age 6 due to insufficient data on safety and 
efficacy (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment including those 
receiving dialysis (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  
Hepatic impairment: No data are available to establish a dose recommendation for patients with 
hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  
Method of Administration 
Fuzeon is only to be administered by subcutaneous injection. For instructions on reconstitution before 
administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Fuzeon must be taken as part of a combination regimen. Please also refer to the respective summary of 
product characteristics of the other antiretroviral medicinal products used in the combination. As with 
other antiretrovirals, enfuvirtide should optimally be combined with other antiretrovirals to which the 
patient’s virus is sensitive (see section 5.1). 
Patients should be informed that Fuzeon is not a cure for HIV-1 infection.  
Animal studies have shown that enfuvirtide may impair some immune functions (see section 5.3). In 
clinical trials, an increased rate of some bacterial infections, most notably a higher rate of pneumonia, 
was seen in patients treated with Fuzeon; however, an increased risk of bacterial pneumonia related to 
the use of Fuzeon has not been confirmed by subsequent epidemiological data. 
Hypersensitivity reactions have occasionally been associated with therapy with enfuvirtide and in rare 
cases hypersensitivity reactions have recurred on rechallenge. Events included rash, fever, nausea and 
vomiting, chills, rigors, low blood pressure and elevated serum liver transaminases in various 
combinations, and possibly primary immune complex reaction, respiratory distress and 
glomerulonephritis. Patients developing signs/symptoms of a systemic hypersensitivity reaction should 
discontinue enfuvirtide treatment and should seek medical evaluation immediately. Therapy with 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enfuvirtide should not be restarted following systemic signs and symptoms consistent with a 
hypersensitivity reaction considered related to enfuvirtide. Risk factors that may predict the 
occurrence or severity of hypersensitivity to enfuvirtide have not been identified. 
Liver disease: The safety and efficacy of enfuvirtide has not been specifically studied in patients with 
significant underlying liver disorders. Patients with chronic hepatitis B and C and treated with 
antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events. 
Few patients included in the phase III trials were co-infected with hepatitis B/C. In these the addition 
of Fuzeon did not increase the incidence of hepatic events. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for 
hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products. 
Administration of Fuzeon to non-HIV-1 infected individuals may induce anti-enfuvirtide antibodies 
that cross-react with HIV gp41. This may result in a false positive HIV test with the anti-HIV ELISA 
test. 
There is no experience in patients with reduced hepatic function. Data is limited in patients with 
moderate to severe renal impairment, and in patients maintained on dialysis. Fuzeon should be used 
with caution in these populations (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Immune Reactivation Syndrome: In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time 
of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to 
asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or 
aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or 
months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or 
focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms 
should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. 
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to 
occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and 
can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 
Osteonecrosis: 
Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol 
consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been 
reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to CART. 
Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint 
stiffness or difficulty in movement. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions are expected between enfuvirtide and 
concomitantly given medicinal products metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. 
Influence of enfuvirtide on metabolism of concomitant medicinal products: In an in-vivo human 
metabolism study enfuvirtide, at the recommended dose of 90 mg twice daily, did not inhibit the 
metabolism of substrates by CYP3A4 (dapsone), CYP2D6 (debrisoquine), CYP1A2 (caffeine), 
CYP2C19 (mephenytoin), and CYP2E1 (chlorzoxazone). 
Influence of concomitant medicinal products on enfuvirtide metabolism: In separate pharmacokinetic 
interaction studies, co-administration of ritonavir (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) or saquinavir in 
combination with a booster dose of ritonavir or rifampicin (potent CYP3A4 inducer) did not result in 
clinically significant changes of the pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies do 
not indicate harmful effects with respect to foetal development. Enfuvirtide should be used during 
pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding: It is not known whether enfuvirtide is secreted in human milk. It is recommended that 
women living with HIV do not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid transmission of HIV and any 
possible undesirable effects in breast-fed infants. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. There is no 
evidence that enfuvirtide may alter the patient’s ability to drive and use machines, however, the 
adverse event profile of enfuvirtide should be taken into account (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
a. Summary of the safety profile 
Safety data mainly refer to 48-week data from studies TORO 1 and TORO 2 combined (see 
section 5.1). Safety results are expressed as the number of patients with an adverse reaction per 
100 patient-years of exposure (except for injection site reactions). 
The most frequently reported events were injection site reactions, diarrhoea and nausea. The addition 
of Fuzeon to background antiretroviral therapy generally did not increase the frequency or severity of 
most adverse reactions. 
b. Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 2 presents events seen at a higher rate among patients receiving Fuzeon + OB regimen than 
among patients on the OB alone regimen with an exposure adjusted increase of at least 2 patients with 
event per 100 patient-years. A statistically significant increase was seen for pneumonia and 
lymphadenopathy. Most adverse reactions were of mild or moderate intensity. Adverse reactions are 
listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency category. Frequency categories are 
defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); 
uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data).

c. Description of selected adverse reactions 
Injection site reactions 
Injection site reactions (ISRs) were the most frequently reported adverse reaction and occurred in 98% 
of the patients (Table 3). The vast majority of ISRs occurred within the first week of Fuzeon

administration and were associated with mild to moderate pain or discomfort at the injection site 
without limitation of usual activities. The severity of the pain and discomfort did not increase with 
treatment duration. The signs and symptoms generally lasted equal to or less than 7 days. Infections at 
the injection site (including abscess and cellulitis) occurred in 1.5% of patients.

In addition there have been a small number of hypersensitivity reactions attributed to enfuvirtide and 
in some cases recurrence has occurred upon re-challenge (see section 4.4). 
Other adverse reactions 
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic 
infections may arise.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have 
also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur 
many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4). 
Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk 
factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART. The frequency of this is unknown (see 
section 4.4). 
As a peptide, enfuvirtide can cause cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site. 
Laboratory abnormalities 
The majority of patients had no change in the toxicity grade of any laboratory parameter during the 
study except for those listed in Table 4. Through week 48, eosinophilia [greater than the Upper Limit 
of Normal of > 0.7 x 109/l] occurred at a higher rate amongst patients in the Fuzeon containing group 
(12.4 patients with event per 100 patient-years) compared with OB alone regimen (5.6 patients with 
event per 100 patient-years). When using a higher threshold for eosinophilia (>1.4 x 109/l), the patient 
exposure adjusted rate of eosinophilia is equal in both groups (1.8 patients with event per 100 patient-
years).

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No case of overdose has been reported. 
The highest dose administered to 12 patients in a clinical trial was 180 mg as a single dose 
subcutaneously. These patients did not experience any adverse reactions that were not seen with the 
recommended dose. In an Early Access Program study, one patient was administered 180 mg of 
Fuzeon as a single dose on one occasion. He did not experience an adverse reaction as a result. 
There is no specific antidote for overdose with enfuvirtide. Treatment of overdose should consist of 
general supportive measures.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: : Other antivirals, ATC code: J05AX07 
Mechanism of Action: Enfuvirtide is a member of the therapeutic class called fusion inhibitors. It is an 
inhibitor of the structural rearrangement of HIV-1 gp41 and functions by specifically binding to this 
virus protein extracellularly thereby blocking fusion between the viral cell membrane and the target 
cell membrane, preventing the viral RNA from entering into the target cell.  
Antiviral activity in vitro: The susceptibility to enfuvirtide of 612 HIV recombinants containing the 
env genes from HIV RNA samples taken at baseline from patients in Phase III studies gave a 
geometric mean EC 50 of 0.259 µg/ml (geometric mean + 2SD = 1.96 µg/ml) in a recombinant 
phenotype HIV entry assay. Enfuvirtide also inhibited HIV-1 envelope mediated cell-cell fusion. 
Combination studies of enfuvirtide with representative members of the various antiretroviral classes 
exhibited additive to synergistic antiviral activities and an absence of antagonism. The relationship 
between the in vitro susceptibility of HIV-1 to enfuvirtide and inhibition of HIV-1 replication in 
humans has not been established. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Antiretroviral drug resistance: Incomplete viral suppression may lead to the development of drug 
resistance to one or more components of the regimen.  
In Vitro resistance to enfuvirtide: HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to enfuvirtide have been 
selected in vitro which harbour substitutions in amino acids (aa) 36-38 of the gp41 ectodomain. These 
substitutions were correlated with varying levels of reduced enfuvirtide susceptibility in HIV site-
directed mutants. 
In Vivo resistance to enfuvirtide: In phase III clinical studies HIV recombinants containing the env 
genes from HIV RNA samples taken up to week 24 from 187 patients showed > 4 fold reduced 
susceptibility to enfuvirtide compared with the corresponding pre-treatment samples. Of these, 
185 (98.9%) env genes carried specific substitutions in region of aa 36 - 45 of gp41. The substitutions 
observed in decreasing frequency were at aa positions 38, 43, 36, 40, 42 and 45. Specific single 
substitutions at these residues in gp41 each resulted in a range of decreases from baseline in 
recombinant viral susceptibility to enfuvirtide. The geometric mean changes ranged from 15.2 fold for 
V38M to 41.6 fold for V38A. There were insufficient examples of multiple substitutions to determine 
any consistent patterns of substitutions or their effect on viral susceptibility to enfuvirtide. The 
relationship of these substitutions to in vivo effectiveness of enfuvirtide has not been established. 
Decrease in viral sensitivity was correlated to the degree of pre-treatment resistance to background 
therapy. (see Table 6). 
Cross-resistance: Due to its novel viral target enfuvirtide is equally active in vitro against both wild-
type laboratory and clinical isolates and those with resistance to 1, 2 or 3 other classes of 
antiretrovirals (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors and protease inhibitors). Conversely, mutations in aa 36-45 of gp41 which give resistance to 
enfuvirtide would not be expected to give cross resistance to other classes of antiretrovirals. 
Clinical Pharmacodynamic data 
Studies in Antiretroviral Experienced Patients: The clinical activity of Fuzeon (in combination with 
other antiretroviral agents) on plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4 counts have been investigated in two 
randomised, multicentre, controlled studies (TORO 1 and TORO 2) of Fuzeon of 48 weeks duration. 
995 patients comprised the intent-to-treat population. Patient demographics include a median baseline 
HIV-1 RNA of 5.2 log10 copies/ml and 5.1 log10 copies/ml and median baseline CD4 cell count of 
88 cells/mm3 and 97 cells/mm3 for Fuzeon + OB and OB, respectively. Patients had prior exposure to 
a median of 12 antiretrovirals for a median of 7 years. All patients received an optimised background 
(OB) regimen consisting of 3 to 5 antiretroviral agents selected on the basis of the patient's prior 
treatment history, as well as baseline genotypic and phenotypic viral resistance measurements. 
The proportion of patients achieving viral load of <400 copies/ml at week 48 was 30.4% among 
patients on the Fuzeon + OB regimen compared to 12% among patients receiving OB regimen only. 
The mean CD4 cell count increase was greater in patients on the Fuzeon + OB regimen than in 
patients on OB regimen only (see Table 5).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetic properties of enfuvirtide have been evaluated in HIV-1-infected adult and 
paediatric patients. 
Absorption: The absolute bioavailability after subcutaneous administration of enfuvirtide 90 mg in the 
abdomen was 84.3 ± 15.5%. Mean (± SD) Cmax was 4.59 ± 1.5 µg/ml, AUC was 55.8 ± 12.1 µg*hr/ml 
The subcutaneous absorption of enfuvirtide is proportional to the administered dose over the 45 to 
180 mg dose range. Subcutaneous absorption at the 90 mg dose is comparable when injected into 
abdomen, thigh or arm. In four separate studies (N = 9 to 12) the mean steady state trough plasma 
concentration ranged from 2.6 to 3.4 µg/ml. 
Distribution: The steady state volume of distribution with intravenous administration of a 90 mg dose 
of enfuvirtide was 5.5 ± 1.1 l. Enfuvirtide is 92% bound to plasma proteins in HIV infected plasma 
over a plasma concentration range of 2 to 10 µg/ml. It is bound predominantly to albumin and to a 
lower extent to α-1 acid glycoprotein. In in vitro studies, enfuvirtide was not displaced from its 
binding sites by other medicinal products, nor did enfuvirtide displace other medicinal products from 
their binding sites. In HIV patients, enfuvirtide levels in the cerebrospinal fluid have been reported to 
be negligible. 
Biotransformation: As a peptide, enfuvirtide is expected to undergo catabolism to its constituent amino 
acids, with subsequent recycling of the amino acids in the body pool. In vitro human microsomal 
studies and in in vivo studies indicate that enfuvirtide is not an inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes. In 
in vitro human microsomal and hepatocyte studies, hydrolysis of the amide group of the C-terminus 
amino acid, phenylalanine results in a deamidated metabolite and the formation of this metabolite is 
not NADPH dependent. This metabolite is detected in human plasma following administration of 
enfuvirtide, with an AUC ranging from 2.4 to 15% of the enfuvirtide AUC.  
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination: Clearance of enfuvirtide after intravenous administration 90 mg was 1.4 ± 0.28 l/h and 
the elimination half-life was 3.2 ± 0.42 h. Following a 90 mg subcutaneous dose of enfuvirtide the 
half-life of enfuvirtide is 3.8 ± 0.6 h. Mass balance studies to determine elimination pathway(s) of 
enfuvirtide have not been performed in humans.  
Hepatic impairment: The pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide have not been studied in patients with 
hepatic impairment. 
Renal impairment: Analysis of plasma concentration data from patients in clinical trials indicated that 
the clearance of enfuvirtide is not affected to any clinically relevant extent in patients with mild to 
moderate renal impairment. In a renal impairment study AUC of enfuvirtide was increased on average 
by 43-62% in patients with severe or end stage renal disease compared to patients with normal renal 
function. Haemodialysis did not significantly alter enfuvirtide clearance. Less than 13% of the dose 
was removed during haemodialysis. No dose adjustment is required for patients with impaired renal 
function. 
Elderly: The pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide have not been formally studied in elderly patients over 
65 years of age. 
Gender and Weight: Analysis of plasma concentration data from patients in clinical trials indicated 
that the clearance of enfuvirtide is 20% lower in females than males irrespective of weight and is 
increased with increased body weight irrespective of gender (20% higher in a 100 kg and 20% lower 
in a 40 kg body weight patient relative to a 70 kg reference patient). However, these changes are not 
clinically significant and no dose adjustment is required. 
Race: Analysis of plasma concentration data from patients in clinical trials indicated that the clearance 
of enfuvirtide was not different in Afro-Americans compared to Caucasians. Other PK studies suggest 
no difference between Asians and Caucasians after adjusting exposure for body weight. 
Paediatric population: The pharmacokinetics of enfuvirtide have been studied in 37 paediatric patients. 
A dose of 2 mg/kg bid (maximum 90 mg bid) provided enfuvirtide plasma concentrations similar to 
those obtained in adult patients receiving 90 mg bid dosage. In 25 paediatric patients ranging in age 
from 5 to 16 years and receiving the 2 mg/kg bid dose into the upper arm, anterior thigh or abdomen, 
the mean steady-state AUC was 54.3 ± 23.5 µg*h/ml, Cmax was 6.14 ± 2.48 µg/ml, and Ctrough was 
2.93 ± 1.55 µg/ml.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and late embryonal development. Long-term 
animal carcinogenicity studies have not been performed. 
Studies in guinea pigs indicated a potential for enfuvirtide to produce delayed contact hypersensitivity. 
In a rat model on the resistance to influenza infection, an impairment of IFN-γ production was 
observed. The resistance to influenza and streptococcal infection in rats was only weakly 
compromised. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and reconstitution 
Any unused medicinal product should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.  
Patients should be instructed on the use and administration of Fuzeon by a healthcare professional 
before using for the first time. 
Fuzeon must only be reconstituted with 1.1 ml of Water for Injections. Patients must be instructed to 
add the water for injections and then gently tap the vial with their fingertip until the powder begins to 
dissolve. They must never shake the vial or turn it upside down to mix—this will cause excessive 
foaming. After the powder begins to dissolve they can set the vial aside to allow it to completely 
dissolve. The powder may take up to 45 minutes to dissolve into solution. The patient can gently roll 
the vial between their hands after adding the water for injections until it is fully dissolved and this may 
reduce the time it takes for the powder to dissolve. Before the solution is withdrawn for 
administration, the patient should inspect the vial visually to ensure that the contents are fully in 
solution, and that the solution is clear and without bubbles or particulate matter. If there is evidence of 
particulate matter, the vial must not be used and should be discarded or returned to the pharmacy. 
The solvent vials contain 2 ml Water for Injections, of which 1.1 ml must be withdrawn for the 
reconstitution of the powder. Patients should be instructed to discard the remaining volume in the 
solvent vials. 
Fuzeon contains no preservative. Once reconstituted, the solution should be injected immediately. If 
the reconstituted solution cannot be injected immediately, it must be kept refrigerated until use and 
used within 24 hours. Refrigerated reconstituted solution should be brought to room temperature 
before injection.  
1 ml of the reconstituted solution should be injected subcutaneously in to the upper arm, abdomen or 
anterior thigh. The injection should be given at a site different from the preceding injection site and 
where there is no current injection site reaction. A vial is suitable for single use only; unused portions 
must be discarded.

Enfuvirtide 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains 
important information for you. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. 
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, 
even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible 
side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

Step-by-step guide to injecting Fuzeon  
1.  What Fuzeon is and what is it used for 
What Fuzeon is 
Fuzeon contains the active substance enfuvirtide and belongs to a group of medicines called 
‘antiretrovirals’.  
What Fuzeon is used for 
Fuzeon is used for the treatment of Human Immune deficiency Virus (HIV) - in combination with 
other antiretroviral medicines in patients infected with HIV. 
• 
• 
Your doctor has prescribed Fuzeon to help control your HIV infection. 
Fuzeon is not a cure for HIV infection. 
How Fuzeon works 
HIV attacks cells in your blood called CD4 or T-cells. The virus needs to make contact with, and get 
inside these cells in order for the virus to multiply. Fuzeon helps by preventing this. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Fuzeon 
Do not use Fuzeon if 
• 
you are allergic to enfuvirtide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Fuzeon. 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Fuzeon if: 
• 
• 
• 
you have ever had any lung problems 
you have ever had any kidney problems 
you have chronic hepatitis B or C or another liver disease - you are more likely to get serious 
liver problems while using this medicine   
Signs of previous infections 
In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a history of opportunistic infections, signs 
and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is 
started. It is believed that these symptoms are due to a recovery of the body’s immune system. This 
improvement enables the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious 
symptoms. If you notice any symptoms of infection, please inform your doctor immediately. 
Signs of autoimmune disorders  
In addition to the opportunistic infections, autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the 
immune system attacks healthy body tissue) may also occur after you start taking medicines for the 
treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months after the start of 
treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, 
weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, 
tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor immediately to seek necessary treatment. 
Patients with liver disease 
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti-HIV therapy are at an increased risk for 
serious liver problems. Speak with your doctor if you have a history of liver disease. 
Bone disease (osteonecrosis) 
Some patients taking combination anti-HIV medicines may develop a bone disease called 
osteonecrosis. This is where the bone tissue dies because the blood supply has been lost (death of bone 
tissue caused by loss of blood supply to the bone).  
 
 
Signs  of  osteonecrosis  are  joint  stiffness,  aches  and  pains  (especially  of  the  hip,  knee  and 
shoulder) and difficulty in movement. If you notice any of these signs please inform your doctor. 
Risk  factors  for  developing  this  disease  include:  how  long  you  have  been  taking  anti-HIV 
medicines, whether you take corticosteroids, how much alcohol you drink, how well your immune 
system works and being overweight.  
Other medicines and Fuzeon 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines. Fuzeon has 
been shown not to interact with your other anti-HIV medicines or rifampicin (an antibiotic). 
Fuzeon with food and drink 
You can use Fuzeon with or without food. However, you still need to follow the instructions given in 
the package leaflets for the other medicines you are taking. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
• 
• 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor 
for advice before taking this medicine. You should not use Fuzeon unless specifically told to by 
your doctor. 
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be 
passed on to the baby in breast milk.  If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, 
you should discuss it with your doctor as soon as possible.  
Driving and using machines 
Fuzeon has not been tested for its effect on your ability to drive a car or use tools or machines. If you 
feel dizzy while using Fuzeon do not drive or use any tools or machines. 
Fuzeon contains sodium 
Fuzeon contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say it is essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Fuzeon 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure.  
How to prepare and inject Fuzeon 
Fuzeon must be given as an injection just below the skin – called a ‘subcutaneous’ injection. Section 7 
tells you how to prepare Fuzeon and how to give yourself an injection. 
How much to use 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The recommended dose is 90 mg twice a day for adults and adolescents (16 years and older).  
This is given as a 1 ml injection just below the skin. 
It is best to use Fuzeon at the same time each day. 
Try and space the doses evenly apart at times which are good for you – for example, first thing 
in the morning and then in the early evening. 
See further instructions on how to use Fuzeon at the end of this leaflet (see Section 7). There you will 
find instructions on how to prepare Fuzeon and how to give yourself an injection. 
If you use more Fuzeon than you should 
If you use more Fuzeon than you should, talk to a doctor or go to a hospital straight away. Take the 
medicine pack with you.  
If you forget to use Fuzeon 
• 
• 
If you forget to use a dose, use it as soon as you remember it. However if it is less than 6 hours 
before you are going to take your next regular dose, skip the missed dose. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

If you stop using Fuzeon 
• 
• 
Keep using your medicine until your doctor tells you to stop. If you stop and there is a gap in 
your treatment this may speed up the chances of the HIV in your blood becoming resistant to 
Fuzeon. This is less likely if you use it regularly and without gaps in treatment. 
The HIV virus in your blood may eventually become resistant to Fuzeon. If this happens, your 
blood levels of virus may begin to rise. This is when your doctor may decide to no longer keep 
treating you with Fuzeon. Your doctor should discuss this with you at that time. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
Stop using Fuzeon and see a doctor straight away, if you notice any of the following serious side 
effects – you may need urgent medical treatment: 
• 
Allergic reaction (hypersensitivity) – signs may include: rash, a high temperature or chills, 
feeling or being sick, sweating or shaking. 
This side effect is rare (affects less than 1 in 1,000 people). These signs do not definitely mean you are 
allergic to this medicine.  
Tell your doctor if you get side effects where the injection is given 
The most common side effects (affect more than 1 in 10 people), are problems at the place on your 
body where you have the injection. You will probably have one or more of the following mild to 
moderate reactions:  
redness 
● 
swelling 
● 
feeling itchy  
● 
bruises 
● 
hardened skin or bumps 
● 
● 
pain, feeling sore or tender 
These reactions can appear in the first week of treatment and usually only last for up to 7 days. They 
generally do not get worse after this time. If you have any of these reactions do not stop using Fuzeon, 
but talk to your doctor about any concerns you have. 
Reactions may be worse when injections are repeated in the same place on the body. They may also be 
worse when the injection is given deeper than intended (for example, into a muscle). Rarely, you may 
get an infection at a place where an individual injection was given. To reduce the risk of infection, it is 
important that you follow the instructions provided in Section 7. 
Fuzeon can cause a build-up of a type of protein, called amyloid, under the skin at the injection site. 
This may feel like lumps under the skin. Please contact your doctor if this occurs. 
Other possible side effects 
Very common (affects more than 1 in 10 people)

STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO INJECTING FUZEON  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. You should check with 
your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.  
What to do if you are left-handed 
The pictures in this leaflet show people who are right-handed. If you are left-handed, do what comes 
naturally to you. You will probably find it most comfortable to: 
• 
• 
hold the syringe in your left hand and  
hold the vial between the thumb and forefinger of your right hand. 
When to have someone to help you 
It may be difficult at first to inject in some places, such as the upper arms. If you need help, ask your 
partner, a friend, or a family member. You may like to ask someone to come with you to an injection 
training session with your doctor or nurse. 
Your syringes 
The syringes supplied with this medicine have a coloured needle protector. This is attached to the 
needle and covers it after use to lower the risk of the needle accidently pricking another person. 
Although these syringes have this safety feature, it is still important that you dispose of used syringes 
properly. Follow the instructions given to you by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Safety Tips 
●  Wash your hands well. This will reduce the risk of bacterial infections.  
● 
Once you have washed your hands, do not touch anything except the medicine and supplies. 
●  When handling the syringe, do not touch the needle.

Do not touch the tops of the vials once they have been cleaned with alcohol swabs. 
Do not use opened materials. Make sure none of the items in your kit have been opened before 
use.  
Never use or share used needles. 
Never use a syringe with a bent or damaged needle. 
Never mix your medicine with tap water. 
Never inject your medicine with other injectable medicines. 
Only inject Fuzeon under the skin (‘subcutaneous’). 
Do not inject Fuzeon into your veins (‘intravenously’) or into your muscles (‘intramuscularly’). 
Dispose of all used materials into your special waste container with a lid. Do this even if the 
vials contain unused amounts of medicine or Water for Injections as these are for single use 
only. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have any questions about safe disposal of 
these items. 
The following is a basic, step-by-step guide to injecting your medicine.

Draw Up Water for Injections 
Step B: Mixing Fuzeon 
1. Pick up the 3 ml large syringe. Using your index finger, move the coloured needle protector away 
from the needle. 
2. To make sure that the needle is firmly on the syringe: 
• 
• 
needle may loosen. 
hold the plastic cap under the needle protector  
tighten the needle and cap with a gentle clockwise twist. Do not use too much force as the 
3. To remove the clear plastic cap: 
• 
push towards the syringe and then pull the cap off.  
4. Draw back 1.1 ml of air. 
5. Push the syringe needle into the rubber top of the vial of Water for Injections and press the plunger. 
This injects the air.  
6. Gently turn the vial upside down. Make sure the tip of the needle is always below the surface of 
the Water for Injections to help keep any air bubbles from entering the syringe. 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7. Slowly pull back the plunger until the water reaches the 1.1 ml mark. Please be aware that the vial 
contains more liquid than you need (2 ml); you only have to pull out 1.1 ml to prepare your 
injection properly. 
8. Tap the syringe gently to make any air bubbles rise to the top. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If too much air gets into the syringe, gently press the plunger to force any air back into the vial. 
Then pull out the water again. 
Make sure you have 1.1 ml of Water for Injections in the syringe.  
This step may be repeated until the correct amount of Water for Injections is in the syringe. 
9. Take out the needle from the vial. Make sure you never touch the needle with your fingers or 
anything else. 
10. Dispose of the vial and the Water for Injections into your special waste container with a lid - this 
vial is for single use only.  
Injecting Water For Injections Into Fuzeon Powder 
1. Gently tap the vial of Fuzeon to loosen the powder. 
2. Hold the main part of the water-filled syringe and push the needle through the rubber top of the vial 
at a slight angle. 
3. Press the syringe plunger in slowly.  
• 
• 
• 
Let the water flow slowly down the inside of the vial.  
Be careful not to forcefully shoot water into the powder, since this can cause foaming. 
If foaming happens, it may take longer for the powder to dissolve completely. 
4. After all of the Water for Injections has been added to the vial of Fuzeon, take out the syringe from 
the vial.  
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. Hold the main part of the syringe with one hand and gently press the coloured needle protector 
down on a flat surface until it covers the needle.  
- You will hear a click. Do not use your free hand to press the device over the needle. 
6. Throw away the syringe into the special waste container with a lid. 
Mixing the Water for Injections with the Fuzeon Powder 
1. Gently tap the vial with your fingertip until the powder begins to dissolve. Never shake the vial or 
turn it upside down to mix—this will cause too much foaming.  
2.  When the powder begins to dissolve you can put the vial aside to allow it to completely dissolve.  
- The powder may take up to 45 minutes to dissolve into solution.  
- The vial can also be gently rolled between your hands after adding the Water for Injections 
until it is fully dissolved.  
- This may reduce the time it takes for the powder to dissolve. 
3. After the powder has dissolved completely  
- Let any bubbles that may have formed settle.  
- If the bubbles are still there, gently tap the side of the vial to help settle them. 
4 It is important to check the liquid for bits (particles).  
- If you see any bits in the liquid, do not use it.  
- Dispose of the vial into the special waste container with a lid or return it to the pharmacy. 
Then start again with a new vial of Fuzeon powder. 
5. If you accidentally touch the rubber stopper, make sure to clean it again with a new alcohol swab 
6. Once a dose is mixed with Water for Injections, it must be used straight away. If not, store in a 
refrigerator and use within 24 hours.  
- Let the liquid get back to  room temperature before using. 
7. If you are preparing both of your daily doses at one time, make sure to use new syringes, Water for 
Injections, and Fuzeon for each dose.

Step C: Preparing for the injection 
Drawing up Fuzeon into the 1 ml syringe 
1. Wipe the top of the Fuzeon vial again with a new alcohol swab. 
2. Pick up the 1 ml small syringe. Using your index finger, move back the coloured needle protector 
away from the needle. 
3. To make sure that the needle is firmly on the syringe: 
• 
• 
hold the plastic cap under the needle protector 
tighten the needle and cap by slightly turning and pushing it towards the syringe. 
4. To remove the clear plastic cap: 
• 
push towards the syringe and then pull the cap off. 
5. Draw back 1 ml of air.  
 - Be careful not to pull the plunger too fast - it may go past the 1 ml marker or out of the syringe. 
6. Push the syringe needle into the rubber top of the Fuzeon vial and press the plunger. This injects the 
air.  
7. Gently turn the vial upside down.  
Make sure the tip of the needle is always below the surface of the solution to help keep air 
bubbles from entering the syringe.  
8. Slowly pull back the plunger until the solution reaches the 1.0 ml mark.  
- Be careful not to pull the plunger too fast - it may go past the 1 ml marker or out of the syringe. 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9. Tap the syringe gently to make any air bubbles rise to the top. 
- If too much air enters the syringe, gently press the plunger to force the air back into the vial.  
- Then pull out the liquid again. 
- Make sure you have 1.0 ml of liquid in the syringe (or whatever amount your doctor prescribed, if it 
is different).  
- This step may be repeated until the correct amount of solution is in the syringe. 
10. Take out the syringe from the vial. 
Step D: Injecting Fuzeon 
Tip:  Your doctor or nurse may suggest different injection techniques that will work best for you. 
Where to Inject 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Fuzeon is given as a 1 ml injection just below the skin – called a ‘subcutaneous’ injection. 
You can inject into your upper arm, upper thigh or stomach area (abdomen). 
Choose a different area from where you last injected yourself. 
Do not inject to a place where there is still a reaction from an earlier dose. Check for any places 
where you may have a reaction by pressing the skin to see if there are any hard bumps.  
Do not inject into areas that could become irritated by your belt or the waistline of your clothes. 
Do not inject into moles, scar tissue, bruises or your belly button (navel). 
Cleansing the injection site 
Clean the area for injection well with an alcohol swab. Do this in a circular motion, starting in the 
middle and working outward. Allow it to dry in the air completely. 
Putting in the needle and injecting 
1. Pinch as much of a skin fold as possible - without making yourself uncomfortable. 
2. Push the needle into the skin at a 45-degree angle. 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. When the needle is in:  
-  release the skin 
-  use this free hand to hold on to the main part of the syringe – this will help steady it and stop it from 
moving. 
4. Using the thumb of your other hand, press the plunger to inject the liquid. 
- After the dose is fully delivered, remove the needle from the skin.  
After pulling out the needle 
1. Hold the main part of the syringe with one hand  
- then gently press the coloured needle protector down on a flat surface until it covers the needle.  
- you will hear a click.  
Do not use your free hand to press the protector over the needle. 
2. Dispose of the syringe into a special waste container with a lid. 
3. If there is any blood where you have given the injection, cover the skin with a sticking plaster. 
Step E: Disposing of used supplies 
- Dispose of all used items straight into the special waste container with a lid. Do this even if the vials 
contain unused amounts of medicine or Water for Injections as these are for single use only. 
- Keep the cover of this container tight and keep it out of the reach of children.  
- Check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse about proper disposal of the container. 
. If you have any questions or concerns about the safe disposal of these materials, please talk to your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

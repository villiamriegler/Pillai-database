2.  Scientific discussion  
2.1.  Problem statement  
2.1.1.  Disease or condition  
Lonapegsomatropin Ascendis Pharma is proposed for growth failure in paediatric patients due to insufficient 
secretion of growth hormone, growth hormone deficiency, GHD.  
Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is characterised by too low systemic levels of growth hormone. Growth 
hormone (GH) is produced by the somatotroph cells of the anterior pituitary gland. The secretion of growth 
hormone from the pituitary gland is stimulated by growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and inhibited 
by somatostatin, both of which are produced by the hypothalamus. Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is 
often associated with defects arising in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus.  
The typical symptom of GHD in children is growth failure. Growth failure is suspected if the growth of 
paediatric subjects develops at a slower rate than would be expected based on the growth chart of the local 
geographic area. In this case, further diagnostic evaluations can be considered to find the cause of growth 
failure.1 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention  
The incidence of short stature associated with GHD has been estimated to be approximately 1:4,000 to 
1:10,000.2,3 GHD may be isolated or may occur in association with deficiencies of other pituitary hormones. 
GHD is the primary indication for growth hormone treatment in childhood. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis  
There are different causes of growth hormone deficiency, which can be categorized in different categories, 
namely: 
• 
Congenital (organic causes such as pituitary aplasia, primary empty sella syndrome etc. or genetic 
causes including various mutations) 
• 
Acquired (tumours of the hypothalamic-pituitary region, most commonly craniopharyngioma, head 
trauma, infection etc.) 
• 
Idiopathic (no clear aetiology) 
The aetiology of childhood GHD is usually hypothalamic in origin with impaired GHRH secretion, with the 
most common diagnosis being isolated idiopathic GHD (Cook 2009).

2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
In neonates, clinical presentations of congenital pituitary GHD include profound hypoglycaemia, 
hypoglycaemic seizures, prolonged jaundice, and microphallus and cryptorchidism in boys. The patients 
diagnosed at younger ages generally have more severe GHD, are more likely to suffer from multiple pituitary 
hormone deficiencies and tend to have had more complications at birth. A substantial reduction in growth 
rate may become apparent within the first few months of life (Huet 1999, Ogilvy-Stuart 2003, Ranke 2003). 
This is sometimes associated with a delay in fontanelle closure. 
Signs  
Although the most obvious feature of GHD may be short stature, the disease has broad health implications. 
Children with GHD may have a small midface, hands, and feet, excess subcutaneous truncal fat, reduced 
muscle mass, thin hair and nails, a high-pitched voice, delayed skeletal and dental maturation, and delayed 
puberty (Albanese 1994, Levy 1996). In addition, GHD can influence cognitive functions and the overall 
sense of well-being. When accompanied by other pituitary deficiencies, further clinical manifestations may be 
present. 
2.1.5.  Management  
The typical symptom of GHD in children is growth failure, and consequently, the aim of treatment is to 
normalize the growth rate during childhood and attainment of normal adult height. For over 30 years, GHD 
has been treated with daily recombinant human growth hormone. The effects of human growth hormone 
replacement in children can be evaluated by assessing the increase in height velocity and related auxological 
parameters and bone maturation. 
With current treatment algorithms paediatric recombinant human growth hormone doses are based on the 
body weight of the growing child which corrects for the higher physiological need for growth hormone during 
growth compared to adults. IGF-I plasma concentrations should be maintained in the normal age- and sex-
adjusted range for safety reasons. Periodic checks of IGF-I levels are required because they may increase 
over time, even if the growth hormone dosage does not change. 
While daily human growth hormone is both safe and effective, its frequency of administration can be 
burdensome for both children and their caregivers. Although children with GHD treated with daily growth 
hormone replacement can achieve normal adult height, real-world outcomes have not matched expectations. 
Due to nonadherence rates ranging from 5 to 82% (Fisher 2013), most GHD patients do not reach their 
target genetic height (Guyda 1999, Lustig 2004), leaving an opportunity to improve treatment outcomes in 
paediatric GHD. 
While there are multiple therapeutic goals of human growth hormone therapy in treating GHD including 
achievement of normal growth patterns, lean/fat body composition, bone mass, glucose homeostasis, 
cognition and improved quality of life, the most readily measured indicator of efficacy is linear growth 
according to the applicant. In view of the applicant, a therapy that results in improved growth outcomes at 
the end of 52 weeks of treatment is expected to result in better clinical effects with long-term therapy. 
For paediatric GHD patients, medicinal products for daily growth hormone supplementation are available (e.g. 
Omnitrope (EU/1/06/332), NutropinAq (EU/1/00/164)). A medicinal product for weekly growth hormone 
supplementation is available (Sogroya (EU/1/20/1501)) for adults GHD patients, apart from medicinal 
products for daily growth hormone supplementation.

2.2.  About the product  
Lonapegsomatropin is a long acting pegylated human growth hormone (somatropin). Lonapegsomatropin is 
designed to release somatropin with the same mode of action and distribution as daily somatropin, but with a 
once-weekly injection. Lonapegsomatropin consists of a parent drug, somatropin, which is transiently 
conjugated to a methoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG) carrier (4 x 10 kDa mPEG) via a proprietary TransCon 
linker (Linker A). The carrier has a shielding effect that minimises renal excretion and receptor-mediated 
clearance of lonapegsomatropin. At physiologic pH and temperature, lonapegsomatropin releases unmodified 
and fully active somatropin via autocleavage of the linker in a controlled manner that follows first-order 
kinetics. 
Human growth hormone (hGH) intermediate (with amino acid sequence identical to that of hGH of pituitary 
origin) is obtained from the fermentation of E. coli transformed with a genetically engineered plasmid 
containing the coding sequence for hGH.  
Lonapegsomatropin Ascendis Pharma drug product is a powder and solvent for solution for injection 
presented in a dual-chamber cartridge (DCC), reconstituted utilizing a proprietary, non-integral, re-usable GH 
Auto-Injector. Clinical development was initiated with a hGH conjugated with an 80 kDa mPEG-Linker (ACP-
001 – predecessor molecule), while current lonapegsomatropin is produced by conjugation of hGH with a 40 
kDa mPEG-Linker (ACP-011). It presents a less frequent treatment option (once a week) for paediatric 
patients with growth failure due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development  
This procedure is subject to a centralised procedure. No request for an accelerated assessment, conditional 
marketing authorisation or approval under exceptional circumstances was made. 
Quality development 
In the quality development of lonapegsomatropin, the applicant has applied relevant ICH and EMA/CHMP 
quality guidelines related to the development, quality control, manufacturing and stability of 
biological/biotechnological drug substances and drug products.  
Clinical development 
Five clinical development studies were conducted with lonapegsomatropin: two phase 1 (healthy adult 
volunteers) and three phase 3 studies (children with growth hormone deficiency). In total, across these 
studies, 379 subjects have been exposed to lonapegsomatropin: 306 children with GHD and 73 healthy 
adults. In the pivotal study CT-301, the proposed dosage of 0.24 mg hGH/kg/week was studied. 
Overall, the scientific advice was followed by the applicant.

2.4.2.  Active substance  
2.4.2.1.  General information  
Lonapegsomatropin is a recombinant human growth hormone (hGH) transiently conjugated to a 
methoxypolyethylene glycol carrier consisting of 4 × 10 kDa mPEG chains (mPEG-Linker). The hGH 
intermediate is obtained from fermentation of a strain of E. coli transformed with a genetically engineered 
plasmid containing the coding sequence for hGH. The mPEG-Linker is generated by conjugation of mPEG-
maleimide to Linker A (proprietary TransCon linker), converting mPEG-maleimide to mPEG-succinimide. At 
physiologic pH and temperature, lonapegsomatropin is designed to release (via autocleavage of the linker) 
somatropin with the same mode of action and distribution as daily somatropin, but with a once-weekly 
injection. The structure of lonapegsomatropin is provided in Figure 1 below. 
Figure 1. Lonapegsomatropin structure  
The hGH intermediate is a 191 amino acid residue protein with a molecular weight of approximately 22.125 
Da. The amino acid sequence of hGH is provided in the dossier. Cysteine residues Cys53 and Cys165 are

linked by an intra-molecular disulfide-bond as are cysteine residues Cys165 and Cys189. The amino acid 
sequence, the N-terminus and the disulfide-bonds of hGH intermediate are identical to that of hGH of 
pituitary origin. There are no post-translational modifications of the hGH. 
Lonapegsomatropin active substance is produced through chemical conjugation of hGH intermediate to the 
mPEG-Linker. The average molecular weight of lonapegsomatropin is approximately 63 kDa.

hGH Intermediate 
The hGH used for manufacture of lonapegsomatropin active substance is expressed by E. coli cells as 
inclusion bodies (IBs), which are then harvested, dissolved, refolded, modified and purified to yield hGH 
intermediate.  
The upstream process starts with the thawing of one vial of Working Cell Bank (WCB) in a shake flask 
followed by further propagation in the production bioreactor. The fermentation is terminated at the end of the 
production phase. The cells are harvested, separated from the fermentation media by centrifugation, followed 
by a homogenisation, recovery and storage of the IBs until the purification process starts. The upstream 
process is adequately described. As regards to the downstream manufacturing process, it includes: 
dissolution, refolding and modification of the IBs, chromatography steps and ultrafiltration/diafiltration. 
At the end of the manufacturing process, the hGH intermediate is filtered through the 0.2 μm filter and 
stored. There are no reprocessing steps during the manufacture of hGH intermediate. 
mPEG-Linker 
The manufacturing process for the mPEG-Linker consists of coupling of the mPEG-maleimide to Linker A. All 
starting materials for the synthesis process of mPEG-Linker are justified and adequately described in the 
dossier. There are no reprocessing steps during the manufacture of mPEG-Linker. 
Lonapegsomatropin 
Lonapegsomatropin active substance is manufactured through chemical conjugation of hGH intermediate to 
mPEG-Linker. The process includes UF/DF, conjugation reaction of hGH Intermediate with mPEG-Linker, 
chromatographic purification of lonapegsomatropin, buffer exchange and concentration by UF/DF, followed by 
final 0.2 μm filtration and filling.

validation, together with commercial-scale data were used to define the process parameters and their ranges, 
to implement suitable in-process tests throughout the manufacturing process and to set the acceptance 
criteria or acceptable ranges. Designation of parameters and in-process tests as critical or non-critical for the 
commercial process has been performed following principles of ICH guidelines. 
Hold times for in-process materials in lonapegsomatropin active substance manufacturing process were 
established based on experimental data. Overall data confirms that all proposed hold times for manufacturing 
of hGH intermediate and lonapegsomatropin active substance in commercial scale were justified by small-
scale data and/or manufacturing data at scale, and yield a product that meet all specification limits. In 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021

support to the established hold times, microbial hold studies were also performed, results of which, together 
with data from historical GMP batches, show that the process consistently operates with low amounts of 
endotoxins and bioburden. 
Clearance validation studies for certain impurities introduced or formed during the hGH intermediate 
manufacturing process have been conducted, demonstrating that the hGH intermediate purification process is 
capable of efficiently removing these process impurities to consistently low levels. 
In addition, regarding the lonapegsomatropin active substance manufacturing process, depletion studies were 
conducted and adequately demonstrated removal or reduction of impurities that are not controlled by the 
lonapegsomatropin specification, but which can impact the impurity profile of the active substance. Fate and 
purge of other impurities originating from chemical starting materials and from mPEG-Linker degradation and 
their potential impact on the quality of the active substance are also adequately discussed and respective 
control strategy is considered acceptable. The potential impact of each impurity on the quality of the 
lonapegsomatropin active substance has been assessed using impurity thresholds from ICH Q3A and ICH Q3B 
as an additional measure to ensure product quality. None of the impurities are considered mutagenic based 
on toxicological evaluations.  
PPQ campaigns covering the manufacturing of IBs, hGH intermediate, lonapegsomatropin active substance,

Lonapegsomatropin active substance clinical development was initiated with hGH intermediate conjugated 
with an 80 kDa mPEG-Linker (ACP-001 – lonapegsomatropin predecessor molecule) while current 
lonapegsomatropin is produced by conjugation of hGH with a 40 kDa mPEG-Linker (ACP-011). 
Lonapegsomatropin produced by the commercial process was used in long-term safety and efficacy extension 
study. 
Characterisation 
Both hGH intermediate and lonapegsomatropin active substance have been sufficiently characterised by 
physicochemical and biological state-of-the-art methods revealing that the active substance has the expected 
structure. 
Primary, secondary and tertiary structure, purity, impurities, high molecular weight species (HMWS), product 
variants, immunological identity and biological activity were studied in PPQ batches in order to characterise 
hGH intermediate and lonapegsomatropin active substance. It should be noted that the protein concentration 
is expressed as the content of hGH and not as the content of lonapegsomatropin. This is acceptable since a 
correlation was established between hGH content and lonapegsomatropin, in order to calculate the 
equivalence of lonapegsomatropin content and this is deemed acceptable. 
Presented results have confirmed the identity, structure and physical characteristics of hGH intermediate and 
lonapegsomatropin active substance. Results of hGH intermediate and hGH released from lonapegsomatropin 
are in a good correlation. 
The biological activity assay for hGH intermediate consists in a cell proliferation assay which is in line with the 
Ph. Eur. monograph 950. The biological activity is quantified relative to an in-house reference material, which 
is endorsed.  
Biological activity for lonapegsomatropin active substance is determined by the use of the same biological 
activity assay as for the hGH intermediate. The biological activity is measured for the liberated hGH.  
Control strategy for product related substances / impurities and process-related impurities is acceptable. 
Relevant species and substances are controlled by both the specification of hGH intermediate and/or 
lonapegsomatropin active substance or just by lonapegsomatropin active substance specification. Other 
impurities are either controlled as part of total impurities and/or have been proven to be reduced to low / 
below LOQ / negligible levels. Potential impurities originating from polymers in contact with intermediate and 
active substance materials are evaluated by risk assessment and by an extractable study performed by the 
manufacturer, followed by safety evaluation by the applicant. The approach is endorsed. 
Specification  
Release and shelf-life specification for hGH intermediate and for lonapegsomatropin active substance are 
provided in the dossier. hGH intermediate specification is predominantly based on the Ph. Eur. and USP 
somatropin monographs. The proposed hGH intermediate specification was considered acceptable, after the 
applicant was requested to provide additional information. Additionally, tightening of acceptance criteria for 
several test parameters was requested during assessment. The proposed specification covers all relevant 
characteristics of somatropin molecule. The acceptance criteria stated in the monographs were applied for 
testing the hGH intermediate with the compendial methods. The justification of the analytical procedures and 
acceptance criteria for the test parameters which are not described in the somatropin monographs is 
provided.  
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 19/142 
 
 
 
Proposed lonapegsomatropin active substance specification is, in general, in line with ICH Q6B guideline and 
covers most of the relevant characteristics of the molecule. Parameters covered include appearance, 
identification, quantity, purity and impurities and contaminants. Comprehensive justification of specification 
limits for parameters stated in the active substance specification is provided. Even though the proposed 
lonapegsomatropin specification is considered acceptable, since limited number of batches are taken as base 
for establishing acceptance criteria, the applicant is recommended to re-evaluate the current acceptance 
criteria for several specification parameters once data from a larger number of commercial process batches 
will be available (Recommendation). 
Analytical methods 
Description and system suitability criteria of non-compendial analytical procedures for hGH intermediate and 
for lonapegsomatropin active substance are provided in the dossier and are considered adequate. Summary 
of development history of analytical procedures is provided and found acceptable.  
Most of the analytical methods have been validated, and validation summaries are provided except for the 
bioburden and endotoxin compendial methods. The approach is considered acceptable. Since validations were 
performed in accordance with ICHQ2 (R1) and predetermined validation acceptance criteria were met, 
analytical methods are considered validated for their intended use.  
Batch analysis 
Analytical testing results for hGH intermediate batches used to manufacture lonapegsomatropin active 
substance for nonclinical studies, development studies, clinical studies, reference materials, stability testing 
and PPQ have been provided. Additional information on the manufacturing process, manufacturer, date of 
manufacturing, batch size, quality (GMP / non-GMP) and use is indicated. Additionally, brief descriptions of 
analytical procedures used only during the development and summaries of their respective validations, if 
applicable, are also provided. The results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the 
manufacturing process. The provided information is considered adequate. 
Reference materials 
For hGH intermediate, the current Ph. Eur. Chemical Reference Substances are used for identification and 
purity/impurity. For biological activity, WHO Somatropin International Standard was used until 2019, when it 
has been replaced by an in-house hGH Primary Reference Material (PRM). The PRM was calibrated against the 
WHO International Standard and was derived from a hGH intermediate development batch, used in the 
clinical study. A summary report for calibration of PRM against WHO standard is provided. A protocol for 
qualification and re-qualification of hGH PRMs and SRMs has been provided and is considered acceptable. 
Acceptance criteria for release of PRM and SRM are mostly aligned with the release specification for hGH 
intermediate and are considered acceptable. Additional characterization studies as those performed for the 
current PRM are added to the protocol for qualification of future RM. Proposed acceptance criteria for RMs 
stability testing are considered acceptable and adequate stability data for PRM has been provided in the 
dossier. 
For lonapegsomatropin, a two-tier in-house reference standard (PRM and SRM) has been established. The 
history of the establishment of reference standards used throughout the development is provided. The 
current PRM and SRM are derived from the active substance batches used in clinical studies. The production 
and testing of the current PRM and SRM are, in general, sufficiently described and considered adequate. 
Some differences between the PRM and SRM specifications and the current active substance specifications are 
observed and are considered appropriately justified by the applicant.  
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 20/142 
 
 
 
Stability data are presented for all lonapegsomatropin in house reference materials established so far. The 
proposed shelf-life is considered acceptable. The protocol for the establishment of future lonapegsomatropin 
reference materials is provided. The PRM and SRM will be prepared from batches representative of a 
commercial process, which will be tested according to the provided specification. Acceptance criteria will be 
the same as for the release specification of lonapegsomatropin active substance. Additionally, a stability 
protocol for the future reference standards has been provided. 
Stability  
For hGH intermediate, stability data have been provided for long-term and accelerated conditions.  
Stability testing is identical to release testing for the hGH intermediate, except for some quality attributes not 
expected to change during shelf-life. The methods used for PPQ batches stability testing are identical to the 
ones used for hGH intermediate release. The Applicant has evaluated the data obtained during the long-term 
conditions stability program against stability acceptance criteria in place at the time of the studies. Results 
were within the acceptance criteria and no significant changes have been observed. Additionally, all results 
provided are within the proposed commercial stability acceptance criteria.  
Increase in the percentage of impurities at accelerated conditions is discussed and the justification provided 
is endorsed.  
Adequate post-approval stability information is presented and acceptable handling of any confirmed OOS is 
proposed. In conclusion, based on the stability data provided, the proposed shelf-life for the hGH 
intermediate is endorsed. 
For lonapegsomatropin active substance stability data has been provided for long-term, accelerated and 
stress conditions. The batches for stability studies were stored in a container closure representative of the 
commercial containers. The long-term stability program is designed and performed according to ICH 
guidelines. 
Methods used for stability testing of PPQ batches are identical to the ones used for lonapegsomatropin active 
substance release. The stability-indicating properties of several analytical procedures have been investigated 
through forced degradation studies. Stability testing is identical to release testing for the lonapegsomatropin 
active substance, except for some quality attributes not expected to change during shelf-life. Long-term 
stability results, except for one test parameter for one batch, are within the commercial acceptance criteria, 
and no significant changes have been observed. For the noncompliant results, the explanation provided by 
the applicant is considered acceptable.  
Results from accelerated conditions studies remained within the acceptance criteria through the testing 
period. No significant changes have been observed. Results from stress conditions studies demonstrate a 
clear trend of autocleavage for lonapegsomatropin and an increase in impurities. Forced degradation studies 
demonstrate that the lonapegsomatropin active substance is sensitive to light exposure, heat, oxidation, 
acidic conditions (low pH), basic conditions (high pH) and agitation. Light exposure study, as part of the 
forced degradation study, was designed in accordance with ICH Q1B guideline. Results on confirmatory 
photostability testing for lonapegsomatropin active substance are not provided, but a confirmatory study is 
provided for the finished product. Based on the provided stability data, the proposed container for the active 
substance provides adequate protection. Freeze/thaw studies were performed and the provided results 
support the proposed number of freeze/thaw cycles for hGH intermediate and for lonapegsomatropin active 
substance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021

Adequate post-approval stability protocol information is presented and acceptable handling of any confirmed 
OOS is proposed.  
In conclusion, the stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the 
proposed shelf-life in the proposed container. 
2.4.3.  Finished medicinal product  
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development  
Lonapegsomatropin powder and solvent for solution for injection are presented in a dual-chamber cartridge 
(DCC): 
−  Chamber 1 containing a lyophilized cake prepared from different fill volumes of an aqueous 
compounded solution of lonapegsomatropin, succinic acid, trehalose dihydrate and tromethamine.  
−  Chamber 2 containing different volumes of diluent (WFI) for reconstitution. 
The primary packaging is a glass cartridge (Type I glass) with two chambers separated by a rubber stopper 
(bromobutyl). The cartridge is closed by a rubber stopper (bromobutyl) in one end and by a rubber closure 
disc (bromobutyl) in the other end. Injection needles with the dimensions 0.25 mm x 4 mm (31G x 5/32”) 
are supplied co-packed with the finished product. 
Following reconstitution utilizing a proprietary, non-integral, re-usable Auto-Injector medical device, 
lonapegsomatropin finished product will be presented as a single-use, sterile solution for subcutaneous (s.c.) 
administration.  
To accommodate dosing of the intended patient group, the finished product is supplied in nine strengths 
containing different amounts of lonapegsomatropin and based upon variable fill volume, two solution 
strengths are obtained (i.e., 11.0 mg hGH/mL and 22.0 mg hGH/mL). There is no overage in the 
lonapegsomatropin finished product formulation. An overfill is included in chamber 1 to compensate for loss 
in the DCC headspace. The volume in chamber 2 is based on calculations of the DCC bypass volume loss  and 
volume expansion during reconstitution of the dry matter in the lyophilized cake.  
The composition of the finished product is sufficiently described. All excipients are of pharmacopoeial grade 
(Ph. Eur./USP), non-animal origin and commonly used in parenteral formulations. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. 
Pharmaceutical development 
During the clinical phases, the formulation has been adjusted for the intended purpose, while assuring 
quality, safety and efficacy of the finished product. 
The compatibility of lonapegsomatropin active substance with the excipients listed above has been discussed 
by the applicant, as well as the choice of excipients, their concentration and characteristics that can influence 
the finished product performance. Lonapegsomatropin is shown to be sufficiently compatible with the 
excipients during long-term storage conditions and accelerated storage conditions. 
A brief summary describing the development of the finished product formulation as well as the differences 
between clinical formulations and proposed commercial formulation is provided and discussed. A predecessor 
ACP-001 molecule (containing 80 kDa mPEG carrier) was utilized in early development and clinical phase 2, 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 22/142 
 
 
 
whereas clinical phase 3 studies were conducted with lonapegsomatropin (containing 40 kDa mPEG carrier) in 
DCC or vials. The final formulation is shown to be robust with regards to variations in protein concentration, 
excipient concentrations, pH and residual moisture in the lyophilized product. The results of the DoE and 
humidity studies performed with lonapegsomatropin finished product to investigate the formulation 
robustness are submitted.  
Differences introduced during development are presented in sufficient detail in the dossier. In clinical 
development, finished product was first delivered as lyophilized powder of predecessor ACP-001 or 
lonapegsomatropin in vials, with WFI in PFS. To provide a more patient convenient container closure system 
(CCS), single-use DCC and a re-usable Auto-Injector were developed for lonapegsomatropin administration. 
Besides changes in the CCS, there have been additional manufacturing changes introduced (minor 
adjustment due to introduction of DCC), as well as site transfer from development site to the proposed 
commercial site. Following the changes in the primary container, dosing system and manufacturing process, 
adequate comparability study have been performed. Supporting data was also provided from an in-use 
stability study comparing the quality profile of the reconstituted finished product in vials and in DCC over 4 
hours. In conclusion, finished product program development is presented in sufficient detail. 
Container closure system 
The primary and secondary packaging of the finished product consist of the following parts:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
dual chamber cartridge (borosilicate glass type I, Ph. Eur., USP, siliconized) 
two rubber stoppers and rubber closure disc (bromobutyl grey, Ph. Eur., USP, siliconized) 
polypropylene snap-on cap (secondary packaging material, not in the contact with product) 
stainless-steel needle, CE marked, 0.25 mm x 4 mm (31G x 5/32”). 
The primary packaging components description, including test procedures and specifications for incoming 
primary packaging components are adequately presented in the dossier. Compliance with the relevant USP 
and Ph. Eur. monographs is stated for contact packaging materials. Short description of secondary packaging 
components is also provided. To justify the appropriateness of the container closure system, an extractable 
study was performed with the rubber material (bromobutyl grey) used for stoppers and closure disc. In 
addition, results of the leachables studies on brombutyl grey siliconized stoppers were provided. 
Following reconstitution utilizing the proprietary Auto-Injector device, lonapegsomatropin finished product will 
be presented as a single-use, sterile solution for subcutaneous administration, to be automatically dosed by 
the Auto-Injector as a single dose empty-all concept injection. The Auto-Injector provides a well-controlled 
reconstitution of the lyophilized finished product in which an automatic mixing step controlled by the device is 
followed by a manual mixing step.  
The Auto-Injector, provided separately, is a CE marked, re-usable, polypropylene electronic medical device, 
with a needle adaptor and a strength specific two-colour coding DCC label. Analysis of the testing data 
confirms that the Auto-Injector and DCC combination product meets the dose accuracy and precision 
requirements of ISO 11608-1, delivering the labelled dose (mg hGH) within the targeted limits. Dose 
accuracy testing also confirmed that proposed fill volumes are appropriate to deliver the labelled amount of 
product. 
The compatibility of the finished product with the injection needle and reconstitution diluent (WFI) has been 
demonstrated during stability studies.  
Overall, the container closure system is adequate for the intended use of the product.

2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls  
Lonapegsomatropin finished product is manufactured, packaged, stability tested and quality control tested in 
accordance with good manufacturing practice (GMP). The manufacturer responsible for the batch release of 
the finished product is: Ascendis Pharma A/S, Tuborg Boulevard 12, DK-2900 Hellerup, Denmark. 
Separate batch formulae for excipients and diluent are provided. The batch formula for lonapegsomatropin 
compounded solution is presented in formulae for calculations of required amounts. The batch formula and 
batch size for the intended commercial finished product batch size expressed in mass units is also stated. The 
maximum number of active substance batches that can be pooled for commercial finished product 
manufacturing, confirmed during process validation of PPQ batches, has been stated by the applicant. The 
approach is endorsed. The manufacturing process and process controls are sufficiently described in the 
dossier and start with the preparation of equipment, primary packaging components and succinic acid 
solution, which is sterile filtered through one 0.22 μm filter. Components of the finished product are mixed 
and sterile filtered through a 0.22 μm filter. On the filling line, the lonapegsomatropin compounded solution is 
in-line sterile filtered through one 0.22 μm filter and filled by weight into cartridges. Diluent (WFI) is 
prepared by distillation, filtered through a sterile 0.22 μm filter into a break tank and in-line sterile filtered 
through a 0.22 μm filter. WFI is then filled by weight into the cartridges. The filled DCCs are visually 
inspected and secondary packed. Operational and performance parameters are described. Primary packaging 
components are depyrogenated in a dry heat tunnel or sterilized in an autoclave under Ph. Eur. conditions 
and in line with the Guideline on the sterilisation of the medicinal product, active substance, excipient and 
primary container. The overall description of the manufacturing process and controls in considered 
acceptable. 
For process justification, technical and GMP batches manufactured in the commercial facility were 
investigated for selected process parameters, which were challenged to investigate the potential contribution 
of process variability to product quality and robustness of the manufacturing process. Data gathered during 
process justification have demonstrated a robust manufacturing process for lonapegsomatropin finished 
product.  
Process and hold times have been set through the entire manufacturing process. Steps that could potentially 
increase degradation were challenged at maximum or above proposed process/hold times. Other 
manufacturing steps were investigated below proposed process/hold times with explanation that these are 
unlikely to affect the quality of lonapegsomatropin finished product. Proposed hold times are appropriately 
justified and supported by data.  
A list of CQAs, indicating their potential impact on safety and efficacy, and associated controlled strategy has 
been provided. Most CQAs are controlled in the specifications or as IPCs. The criticality assessment and the 
justifications provided are considered appropriate. Overall, the control strategy is appropriately designed to 
ensure that each CQA is within the appropriate range, limit or distribution to assure the quality of 
lonapegsomatropin finished product. 
For PPQ, adequate bracketing concept was used. The PPQ covers all unit operations. All results obtained for 
the PPQ batches show that the manufacturing process of lonapegsomatropin finished product and the control 
strategy is suitable, by demonstrating the reproducibility, performance, consistency and robustness of the 
manufacturing process within pre-defined limits and specified conditions. Validation of aseptic processing 
included results of the three most recent media fills. All acceptance criteria are met. Adequate bracketing 
approach was also applied for the filter validation. The investigations and validations performed on the 
sterilizing filter have shown that the filter is capable of retaining bacteria and is compatible with the 
Assessment report

lonapegsomatropin compounded solutions, placebo and WFI. Based on the results from the extractables 
studies, the risk for patients due to potential leachables from the filter used for the manufacture of the 
lonapegsomatropin finished product is negligible. In conclusion, the sterilizing filter can be used to supply 
sterile lonapegsomatropin finished product to the patient. In order to further substantiate conclusions on 
sterilizing filter validation studies, a summary of results of extractables and leachables studies, with 
presented calculations of worst-case exposure of potential substances with regards to compound-specific 
permitted daily exposure levels are provided. Additionally, adequate data in support to transport validation 
are provided and is considered sufficient. 
In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished 
product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification  
Lonapegsomatropin finished product specification is provided in the dossier. Parameters covered include the 
following aspects: appearance for the diluent; appearance, reconstitution time and residual moisture for the 
lyophilized powder; appearance, general tests (osmolality, subvisible particles, pH), identification, protein 
content, uniformity of dosage units expelled volume, biological activity, linker cleavage, purity and impurities 
and contaminants for the reconstituted solution. The release and end of shelf-life testing specification for 
lonapegsomatropin finished product is provided. Wider limits for the end of the shelf-life are proposed for 
some QAs, which is considered acceptable. 
Revision/tightening of several specifications was requested during assessment. Even though the proposed 
lonapegsomatropin finished product specification is considered acceptable, since limited number of batches is 
taken as base for establishing acceptance criteria, the applicant is recommended to re-evaluate the current 
acceptance criteria once data from a larger number of commercial process batches will be available 
(Recommendation).  
Specifications are set taking into account release and stability results for finished product batches. Several 
clinical, PPQ and technical batches have been considered for establishing the specification. Overall, finished 
product acceptance criteria at release and during shelf-life are considered acceptable. 
No new impurities are formed during the finished product manufacturing process. A risk assessment 
performed in accordance with ICHQ3D on elemental impurities in the finished product is provided and 
deemed acceptable. Based on the risk assessment, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any 
elemental impurity controls. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
Initially, the applicant has provided a risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in 
lonapegsomatropin active substance and in the finished product. However, an updated risk assessment, 
including an evaluation of probability of contamination with nitrosamines during the manufacture of starting 
materials, was requested as a Major Objection. The requested risk evaluation has been performed, 
considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing 
authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 
referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment 
report - Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004 - Nitrosamine impurities in human 
medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided it is accepted that no risk was 
identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished 
product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary.

Analytical methods 
Description and system suitability criteria of non-compendial analytical procedures for the finished product 
are provided in the dossier and are considered adequate. For residual moisture for lyophilized powder, 
appearance (clarity and colour) of the reconstituted solution, visible particles, bacterial endotoxins, sterility, 
osmolality, sub-visible particles and pH, reference to Ph. Eur. and/or USP is given, which is considered 
acceptable. The biological activity of the finished product is determined using a cell proliferation assay, in line 
with the Ph. Eur. monograph 950. 
The validation for in-house methods is performed according to ICHQ2 (R1) and validation summaries 
(validated parameters and results) are provided. Provided summaries for all non-compendial methods show 
that all predetermined validation acceptance criteria were met and that all methods are considered validated 
for their intended use. Basic analytical procedures (residual moisture, clarity, colour, visible particles, 
osmolality, sub-visible particles and pH) have been verified and demonstrated to be suitable for the intended 
use. Procedures for bacterial endotoxins and sterility have been validated in accordance with the harmonized 
pharmacopeia to confirm suitability. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data for finished product batches used for nonclinical studies, analytical method validation, 
development studies, clinical studies, stability testing and PPQ are presented. All results met the acceptance 
criteria used at the time of release and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Reference materials 
See active substance section on Refence Materials, which is applicable also for the finished product. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product  
The presented stability protocols are considered acceptable. Stability studies are conducted in accordance 
with ICH Guidelines Q1A (R2) Stability Testing of New Drug Substance and Products, Q1D Bracketing and 
Matrixing Designs for Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products, and Q5C Quality of 
Biotechnological Products: Stability Testing of Biotechnological/Biological Products Stability. The parameters 
tested are the same as for release, except for several quality attributes which are not expected to change 
over time. The approach is considered acceptable. Container closure system used in stability testing is 
considered representative of the finished product container closure system. 
All primary and supportive stability batches have been manufactured at the finished product manufacturing 
site using the same commercial manufacturing process. Regarding the stability data provided, the 
degradation profile of the primary, supportive and PPQ batches are comparable. All presented data remained 
within the proposed acceptance criteria for long-term testing.  
In conclusion, it is considered acceptable to approve the proposed finished product shelf-life of 36 months at 
5°C, including storage at temperatures up to 30°C for up to 6 months. The finished product shelf-life was 
estimated based on statistical analysis using the ICH Q1E (Evaluation of Stability Data) approach, which is 
considered acceptable.  
In order to support the transfer of lonapegsomatropin finished product in and out of the refrigerator (2°C to 
8°C) to a maximum temperature of 30°C for 6 months during long-term storage, two temperature cycling 
studies were performed. Based on the provided data, justification of limits for several quality attributes and 
commitment provided by the applicant to re-evaluate the acceptance criteria once a sufficient number of 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 26/142 
 
 
 
finished product batches will be manufactured. It can be concluded that the storage up to 30°C can be 
accepted. It is acknowledged that this provides a benefit for the patient in providing flexibility in storing 
lonapegsomatropin finished product.  
The stability of lonapegsomatropin finished product after reconstitution is assessed by in-use stability studies 
conducted at study start and at selected testing time points up to the end of shelf-life. Although a minor 
increase in released hGH was observed 4 hours after reconstitution, all presented results comply with the 
proposed acceptance criteria. Available data therefore support an in-use storage period of up to 4 hours at up 
to 30°C. 
Photostability studies were conducted in accordance with ICH Q1B.It is concluded that lonapegsomatropin 
finished product is sensitive to light and that the secondary packaging intended for market provides sufficient 
protection against light.  
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life of lonapegsomatropin finished product of 36 months and 
storage conditions (Store in a refrigerator 2°C - 8°C. Do not freeze. Store in the original package in order to 
protect from light) or for up to 6 months at temperatures up to 30°C, as stated in the SmPC, are acceptable. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents  
Viral safety 
E. coli is used to manufacture lonapegsomatropin active substance. During the manufacturing process, no 
reagents derived from biological sources are used. As such the risk for viral contamination is negligible. The 
provided information does not give rise to specific comments or issues.  
TSE issues 
A white colorant is used for the closure of the active substance container; this colourant contains tallow of 
bovine or porcine origin. The material information sheet (MIS) from the manufacturer of the closure is 
provided. The MIS concludes that the tallow is unlikely to present any TSE risk. The provided information is 
considered sufficient.

2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
Two Major Objections were raised, concerning (1) the definition of a starting material and (2) the 
completeness of the nitrosamine risk evaluation. The Major Objections, as well as all the other concerns, 
have been satisfactorily resolved.  
In summary, from a quality point of view, a positive CHMP opinion of the quality part can be recommended to 
the CHMP.

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertain to re-evaluation of the active substance and finished product 
acceptance criteria once a large number of batches are being manufactured. This point is put forward and 
agreed as recommendation for future quality development. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development  
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following point for investigation. 
1.  To re-evaluate the active substance and the finished product specifications after a sufficient number 
of batches are manufactured and available. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects  
2.5.1.  Introduction  
A predecessor of lonapegsomatropin, ACP-001, with identical recombinant hGH and TransCon linker moieties, 
varying from lonapegsomatropin only in its mPEG composition (4 x 20 kDa chains for a total of 80 kDa), was 
used in early development. Based upon the overall similarity of the kinetics of the released hGH and 
subsequent insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) response and the associated efficacy and safety profiles 
investigated in nonclinical studies and in a clinical phase 1 study, data obtained for ACP-001 is judged 
applicable to lonapegsomatropin. Some studies, conducted as part of the ACP-001 program, were thus 
deemed supportive of lonapegsomatropin: IGF-I stimulation in repeat-dose study of ACP-001 in cynomolgus 
monkeys, potency testing of ACP-001 in hypophysectomized rats, human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) 
assay, skin sensitization test in mice and pre- and postnatal development toxicity study in rats.  
Like hGH, somatropin, when released from lonapegsomatropin, exerts its biological action via binding and 
activation of the growth hormone receptor (GHR). The nonclinical safety programme was designed in 
accordance with relevant regulatory guidelines. Bioanalytical and immunogenicity assays were developed and 
validated according to current guidelines and relevant white papers. The nonclinical program involved a range 
of in vitro and in vivo toxicity studies in CBA/J mice, Sprague Dawley rats, New Zealand White rabbits, and 
cynomolgus monkeys, which are considered relevant species for safety evaluation of lonapegsomatropin. In 
all repeat-dose toxicity studies the animals were dosed weekly by SC injection at dose levels up to 20-fold 
the clinical therapeutic dose of 0.24 mg hGH/kg/week. 
The lonapegsomatropin drug product strength is described in mg weight of hGH (as distinguished from mg 
weight of the entire prodrug). Exposure to lonapegsomatropin was confirmed throughout the once weekly 
dosing periods in all studies. The nonclinical development program for lonapegsomatropin has been designed 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 28/142 
 
 
 
with special focus on supporting the paediatric population. Therefore, the chronic repeat-dose toxicity studies 
were conducted in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys. 
The nonclinical program assessed both the parent prodrug, lonapegsomatropin, and the products of 
autocleavage (hGH, mPEG, the leaving group, and the remainder of the linker covalently bound to mPEG) as 
well as IGF-I, a biomarker of hGH receptor activation. In vitro assessment of the autocleavage products 
involved use of partly cleaved lonapegsomatropin as the test article. The nonclinical studies included 
assessment of the putative safety aspects of lonapegsomatropin, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics 
(PK/PD) of lonapegsomatropin, hGH, the leaving group, mPEG (both in serum and cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]), 
mPEG-linker, and IGF-I as well as immunogenicity aspects of lonapegsomatropin (binding/neutralizing anti-
hGH antibodies and binding anti-PEG antibodies). 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology  
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Both in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to evaluate the pharmacology and pharmacodynamics of 
lonapegsomatropin. 
An analytical comparability study was undertaken to compare the integrity of the released hGH from 
lonapegsomatropin to unconjugated hGH by RP-HPLC-MS, tryptic peptide map MS, MALDI-TOF MS and free 
thiol quantification. The comparability study indicated a high similarity of the released hGH to the control 
hGH, demonstrating that hGH is unaltered and unmodified when released from lonapegsomatropin. Potency 
of the released hGH was 3.1 IU/mg, confirming that the hGH released from lonapegsomatropin is fully active. 
The kinetic analyses of hGH and lonapegsomatropin were performed over a range of concentrations and tested 
in duplicate, by Surface Plasmon Resonance Technology. The concentration of free recombinant hGH liberated 
during analysis was assessed by RP-HPLC. 
A mean association rate constant ka ~ 106 M-1s-1 and dissociation rate constant kd ~ 10-4 s-1 were determined 
for the hGH:hGHR interaction, over the concentration range assessed, and thereby comparable to literature 
values based on similar studies (Cunningham, 1993). Samples analysed by RP-HPLC following each analytical 
run indicated that no significant release of hGH occurred from lonapegsomatropin (≤ 0.14% of the total hGH) 
during  the  timespan  (~  2.75  h)  of  the  sample  analysis.  Mean  dissociation  rate  constants  (kd)  across  the 
concentration range were slow (~ 10-4 s-1) and were similar for hGH and lonapegsomatropin.  
Thus, lonapegsomatropin was demonstrated to have markedly reduced binding to the GH receptor compared 
to  hGH  even  under  in  vitro  conditions  optimized  for  binding  and  with  equal  access  to  the  receptor  for  both 
lonapegsomatropin and hGH.  
The biological potency of hGH is routinely determined using an in vitro cell-based proliferation bioassay using 
the  rat  lymphoma  cell  line  Nb2-11.  Since  the  residual  activity  of  lonapegsomatropin  cannot  easily  be 
determined,  due  to  the  release  of  significant  amounts  of  hGH  during  the  assay  incubation  time  of  48  h,  an 
assessment was conducted using a non-cleavable, permanently conjugated hGH designated PermCon hGH.  
The  evaluation  of  PermCon  hGH  in  the  cell-based  proliferation  bioassay  indicated  that  PermCon  hGH  has  a 
maximum residual potency of 0.087 IU/mg compared to 3.5 IU/mg for the hGH control sample (relative to the 
WHO NIBSC somatropin reference standard set to a potency of 3.0 IU/mg). The hGH control showed slightly 
increased  values  (3.5  IU/mg)  compared  to  the  reference  standard  of  the  bioassay.  The  residual  activity  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 29/142 
 
 
 
PermCon hGH was calculated to be 2.5%, relative to the normalized hGH control sample even under in vitro 
conditions  with unhindered  accessibility  to  the  receptor  for  both  lonapegsomatropin  and  hGH.  These  results 
indicate  that  hGH  is  essentially  inactivated  following  a  permanent  PEGylation  mimicking  the  transient 
conjugation  of  mPEG  to  hGH  in  lonapegsomatropin.  Therefore,  lonapegsomatropin  can  be  considered  an 
essentially inactive hGH prodrug.  
The  in  vitro  studies  conducted  to  evaluate  the  pharmacology  and  pharmacodynamics  of  lonapegsomatropin 
included the predecessor molecule ACP-001 as a comparator. Results from these in vitro studies demonstrated 
that ACP-001 and lonapegsomatropin are comparable in terms of mass and integrity of released hGH, in vitro 
dissociation (kd) from hGHR, and potency of released hGH. In vitro binding (ka) to hGHR was slightly lower for 
ACP-001 than for lonapegsomatropin (3.2% versus 6.8% of that for hGH), most likely due to the larger size of 
the mPEG chains in ACP-001. 
In  summary,  ACP-001  and  lonapegsomatropin  were  shown  to  be  comparable,  and  therefore  the  nonclinical 
studies conducted with the predecessor molecule, ACP-001, (IGF-I stimulation in repeat-dose study of ACP-
001 in cynomolgus monkeys, potency testing of ACP-001, hERG assay, skin sensitization test in mice, and pre- 
and postnatal development toxicity study in rats) are deemed relevant for the pharmacodynamic and safety 
evaluation of lonapegsomatropin.  
Pharmacodynamics of hGH in vivo was evaluated via IGF-I, which is a recognized biomarker for hGH activity 
(Pawlikowska-Haddal,  2012),  and  via  measurement  of  body  weight,  which  is  a  biomarker  of  the  growth 
promoting effect of hGH, as body weight gain correlates with longitudinal growth (Blutke et al, 2014). 
Two dedicated pharmacology studies in hypophysectomized rats and in healthy monkeys were conducted to 
investigate  the  effects  of  hGH,  when  released  from lonapegsomatropin,  on  IGF-I  response,  and  subsequent 
pharmacological  effect  on  growth  measured  as  increased  body  weight.  These  studies  included  daily 
administration of somatropin as a comparator. 
Studies with ACP-001 in hypophysectomised rats showed that on µg hGH dose/kg bodyweight basis ACP-001 
was approximately twice as potent as hGH (measuring body weight gain), comparing 1q3d doses of ACP-001 
with 1qd doses of hGH for 10 days. In cynomolgus monkeys, after weekly SC administrations of ACP-001 at 
2.0 mg hGH/kg/week or daily SC administrations of somatropin at 0.3 mg hGH/kg/day (1 monkey/sex/group), 
the pre-treatment baseline corrected IGF-I AUCs for the female ACP-001 treated monkey was 47% and 268% 
higher during Week 1 and 4, respectively, compared to the female monkey treated with daily somatropin. For 
the male monkey, the AUCs for pre-treatment baseline corrected IGF-I were 109% and 208% higher during 
Week 1 and 4, compared to somatropin treated male monkey. Elevation of IGF-I was more or less consistent 
throughout  the  week  after  both  the  first  and  fourth  weekly  administration  of  ACP-001.  However,  since 
somatropin and ACP-001 were administered in two different experiments, no direct comparison can be made 
and because only one animal/sex/group was dosed, the strength of evidence is considered low. 
Concerning longer-term treatment with lonapegsomatropin, data are available from the repeated dose 
toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, where body weight and IGF-I levels were measured. In 
cynomolgus monkeys treated for one month, no effects on body weight were observed, but a non-dose-
related increase on baseline corrected (BLC) IGF-I was shown. When monkeys were treated for a longer 
period (26 weeks or 52 weeks), body weights were increased in both sexes, albeit in the 26-week study for 
males, the increase was non-dose-related. In the (sub)chronic studies in monkeys, BLC IGF-I increased dose-
related, albeit in the 26 weeks study, the highest dose did not further increase BCL IGF-I. The IGF-I levels in 
monkeys administered lonapegsomatropin SC once per week remained consistently elevated throughout the 
week after administration.  
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 30/142 
 
 
 
In the repeated dose toxicity studies in rats, the effects on body weight and BCL-IGF-I were less consistent.  
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies  
No secondary pharmacodynamic effects were observed in the toxicology studies at supraphysiological levels, 
therefore, no dedicated studies were conducted. 
In addition to an effect on growth, somatropin has secondary effects, e.g. on glucose transport, lipolysis or 
endocrine effects. These effects are considered to be mediated by hGH interaction with GH receptor in 
various tissues.  hGH released from lonapegsomatropin is shown to be equivalent with somatropin (see 
primary pharmacology). Consequently, there is no need to study the secondary pharmacological effects of 
lonapegsomatropin. Where relevant, secondary effects have been included in the SmPC: insulin sensitivity, 
hypoadrenalism, thyroid function and oestrogen containing therapy. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme  
Safety pharmacology studies included the in vitro hERG assay (using ACP-001), and in vivo studies 
evaluating the potential effect of lonapegsomatropin on central nervous system and respiratory function in 
Sprague Dawley rats and cardiovascular function in cynomolgus monkeys. In vivo safety pharmacology 
evaluations were conducted at the estimated tmax of lonapegsomatropin as well as the products of 
autocleavage (hGH, mPEG, and the leaving group). 
In vitro, the effects on the cardiovascular system were studied through the effects of partly hydrolysed ACP-
001 on the hERG tail current. A pre-incubation step was conducted at physiological pH and temperature for 7 
days  to  yield  partly  (approximately  61%)  cleaved  ACP-001.  CHO-K1  cells  expressing  the  hERG  ion  channel 
were  exposed  to  two  dilutions  of  Hydrolyzed  ACP-001,  346-  and  70-fold,  which  contained  nominal 
concentrations  of  hGH  (both  in  the  conjugated  and non-conjugated  forms)  of  15  and  72  μg/mL,  PEG  linker 
(both in the conjugated and non-conjugated forms) of 58 and 289 μg/mL and the leaving group of 48 ng/mL 
and 235 ng/mL, respectively. Hydrolyzed ACP-001 produced no statistically different effects on the hERG tail 
current compared to the Time Matched Control (at a 70-fold dilution, a mean loss of 2.9% from controls was 
calculated as a % of cisapride block). 
The results are in accordance with the computational assessment (DEREK) of the leaving group, which did 
not identify structural alerts for hERG channel inhibition. 
The  in  vivo  cardiovascular  evaluation  of  lonapegsomatropin  was  performed  by  including  short-term 
electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings in the GLP 4-week repeat-dose toxicity studies in adult and 26 and 52-
week  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  in  juvenile  cynomolgus  monkeys.  No  treatment  related  effects  on  the 
cardiovascular system were apparent in this study following SC administrations of lonapegsomatropin at dose 
levels  up  to  and  including  3.0  mg  hGH/kg/week  for  4  weeks.  SC  administration  of  lonapegsomatropin  in 
monkeys  did  not  impact  qualitative  or  quantitative  ECG  parameters  at  doses  up  to  and  including  4.8  mg 
hGH/kg/week, the highest dose administered, for up to 52 weeks. 
This respiratory evaluation was done in rats GLP study was conducted to evaluate the potential acute respiratory 
effects of lonapegsomatropin in male rats (n=8/group) and the assessment was based on mortality, clinical 
observations, and evaluations of respiratory function. Lonapegsomatropin following a single SC administration 
to  male  rats  did  not  result  in  any  effects  on  the  evaluated  respiratory  parameters  at  dose  levels  up  to  and 
including 3.0 mg hGH/kg.

A study was conducted to evaluate the potential acute neurobehavioral effects of lonapegsomatropin in male 
rats (n=10/group). Assessments of neurobehavioral effects were based on a standard functional observational 
battery (FOB) evaluations. FOB evaluations were conducted on all animals Day 1 (pre-dose, 8, and 24 h post-
dose) and Day 7, and assessments were performed by trained staff blinded to the assigned treatment groups. 
The  parameters  evaluated  in  the  FOB  were  based  on  those  outlined  in  Moser  et  al.,  1988  and  1996  and  a 
detailed  clinical  examination  of  each  animal  was  performed  following  FOB  examination.  A  single  SC 
administration of lonapegsomatropin to male rats at dose levels up to and including 3.0 mg hGH/kg did not 
result in any effects on the neurobehavioral endpoints. 
Similarly, in the repeated dose toxicity studies for up to 52 weeks at dose levels up to 4.8 mg hGH/kg/week, 
clinical signs or effects on renal functional parameters suggesting an adverse effect on the CNS function or 
the kidneys were not observed. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions  
Drug interactions for recombinant hGH are well-known from approved marketed hGH products with once 
daily administration. None of the other components following lonapegsomatropin autocleavage warrant 
assessment of drug interaction potentials as mPEG is considered biologically inert (Webster et al., 2007) and 
systemic concentrations of the leaving group was below LLOQ (25.0 pg/mL) at clinical steady state 
concentrations at the therapeutic dose level of 0.24 mg hGH/kg/week. Therefore, drug interaction studies 
have not been conducted, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics  
Assessments of toxicokinetic (TK) profile (lonapegsomatropin, hGH, the leaving group, mPEG(-linker)) and 
the response of the biomarker IGF-I (as PD marker) were included as part of the nonclinical safety 
assessments following subcutaneous (SC) administration of lonapegsomatropin to Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, 
female New Zealand White rabbits and Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) for a total duration of up 
to 52 weeks. Studies also included the predecessor molecule, ACP-001. ACP-001 possesses identical 
recombinant hGH and TransCon Linker moieties (including the leaving group), varying from 
lonapegsomatropin only in its mPEG composition (4 x 20 kDa mPEG). 
Methods of analysis 
Assays were developed for the evaluation of PK, PD and immunogenicity in the nonclinical studies. For the 
GLP studies in rats, rabbits and monkeys, assays were validated according to guidelines and sample analysis 
conducted in compliance with GLP. Lonapegsomatropin, ADP-001, hGH, mPEG, and IGF-I were quantified 
using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The provided validation reports, which 
included evaluating precision, accuracy (intra- and inter-assay), specificity, selectivity/matrix effects, and 
sample stability (long-term, freeze-thaw), demonstrate that the lonapegsomatropin and hGH assays were 
suitable to analyse monkey, rabbit, and rat serum. For the hGH assays, a pre-immunoprecipitation step was 
used to limit cross-reactivity with lonapegsomatropin, but incomplete removal of residual lonapegsomatropin 
still resulted in an overestimation of the hGH concentrations. For the rabbit, however, still, a 4 – 6-fold 
overestimation was found. In monkey and rat, the detection limit (LLOQ) was 5.0 and 2.0 ng/ml for 
lonapegsomatropin (hGH eq.) and hGH, respectively. The ELISA for mPEG detection (LLOQ 500 ng/ml) was 
developed and validated for rat, rabbit and monkey serum and for rat and monkey CSF. The assays were 
considered acceptable to evaluate systemic exposure based on incurred sample analysis for

lonapegsomatropin, hGH, mPEG, the leaving group and IGF-I. The leaving group and the mPEG-linker were 
quantified by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry [LC-MS/MS]. The detection 
limit for the mPEG linker was 2.0 µg/ml. For the leaving group, the LLOQs for rat, rabbit and monkey plasma 
were 75, 75 and 50 pg/mL, respectively. 
For detecting antibodies (ADAs) against both hGH and mPEG (monkey only), bridging ELISA immunoassays 
were developed for rat, rabbit and monkey serum. The anti-hGH ADA assays were selective, and the 
sensitivity was found to be 65.6, 63, and 250 ng/ml for the assay in rat, rabbit, and monkey serum, 
respectively. Drug tolerance was 20,000, 444, and 25,000 ng/mL lonapegsomatropin (hGH equivalents) in 
rat, rabbit, and monkey serum. For anti-mPEG ADA detection in monkey serum, drug tolerance was 15,000 
ng/ml lonapegsomatropin (hGH eq.). 
Serum samples confirmed positive for anti-hGH ADAs were assessed for the potency to neutralise the hGH-
stimulated proliferation of a rat lymphoma cell (Nb2-11). Anti-hGH neutralizing antibody assays were 
developed for rat, rabbit and monkey serum. These assays were selective, sensitive and the drug tolerance 
was 111, 25 and 45.7 ng/mL lonapegsomatropin (hGH eq.) in rat, rabbit and monkey serum, respectively.  
Absorption 
In SD rats, the toxicokinetics (TK) of lonapegsomatropin and hGH was assessed in a 4- and 27-week repeat-
dose toxicity study, in which lonapegsomatropin (0.75 up to 4.8 mg hGH/kg) was given subcutaneously (SC) 
every week (QW). A slow absorption (Tmax ~18h) was seen, and systemic exposure appeared sex-
dependent as AUC0-168hr and Cmax values were about 3-fold greater in males than females. The terminal 
elimination half-life (T1/2) was ~15 – 27 h. With increasing dose, a more or less dose-proportional increase 
in exposure was found. Upon repeated dosing, up to 70% lower exposure was seen in the 4-wk repeated 
dose study. These data correlated with the observed high (~50%) incidence of anti-hGH binding antibodies 
(ADAs) / neutralizing antibodies found at Day 28. Somatropin (hGH) was also found in circulation, and its 
pharmacokinetic profile followed the lonapegsomatropin levels but at a 16 – 46-fold lower serum 
concentration level. 
In the 27-week repeated dose study, anti-hGH binding ADAs were also widely detected in the treated animals 
(60 – 90% positive) upon repeated administration of lonapegsomatropin, and the majority of the binding 
ADAs were neutralizing. At several time points, only one or two individual concentrations above the assay 
LLOQ were found and, therefore, at week 13 and 26 of dosing, no AUC0-168hr values were available. For 
hGH, the systemic concentration also decreased over time, with a very limited number of animals being 
exposed for the entire week at the end of the 27-week treatment period. 
Developmental and reproductive toxicity studies were performed in SD rats and New Zealand White rabbits. 
The pharmacokinetic profile of lonapegsomatropin in the rat reproductive studies was comparable to the 4-wk 
repeated dose study and was hampered by the hGH ADA formation (40 – 90% positive animals).  
In rabbits, systemic exposure was not observed over the entire dosing period following weekly or every 
second-day dosing regimens as the presence of anti-hGH ADAs severely impacted serum concentrations of 
hGH and the subsequent IGF-I response. 
Autocleavage of lonapegsomatropin, apart from hGH, also generates the mPEG-linker (‘mPEG’), which can be 
assessed in serum samples. Systemic exposure to mPEG was shown throughout the 27-week repeated dosing 
study, and upon lonapegsomatropin dosing, a dose-proportional increase in mPEG exposure was seen 
leading, after 13 -26 weeks, to a 2- to 4-fold increase in exposure (AUC0-168). At week 26, the mPEG Cmax 
levels were found to be 89 – 193-fold higher than lonapegsomatropin Cmax. Systemic exposure of mPEG was 
still evident up to Week 43 in the recovery period for all dose levels. The terminal elimination half-life of 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 33/142 
 
 
 
mPEG was in the range of 485 – 950 h. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected from main and recovery 
animals at necropsy were all below the LLOQ for the mPEG (500 ng/mL). 
Studies using intravenous administration of lonapegsomatropin were not performed. Therefore, no 
information is available on absolute bioavailability, the volume of distribution and clearance in a preclinical 
species. A single-dose PK studies were performed in order to compare two manufacturing sites for both the 
hGH intermediate and for the drug substance. The PK of lonapegsomatropin following a single SC 
administration to monkeys of lonapegsomatropin generally appeared comparable. 
In cynomolgus monkeys, in total five repeat-dose toxicity studies, two exploratory, non-GLP, and three under 
GLP, were conducted, of which two 4-wk studies in adult and three (the 26- and 52-wk) repeat-dose studies 
in juvenile (13 - 17 month old) monkeys. In general, TK data for lonapegsomatropin, hGH, and mPEG in 
serum were independent of sex and age. Upon SC administration of lonapegsomatropin (0.4 up to 4.8 mg/kg, 
QW), as in rats, a slow absorption was seen and maximum lonapegsomatropin serum exposure (Cmax) was 
reached after 24 – 36 hrs, after which it slowly declined with an elimination half-life of 40 - 60 hrs. Levels of 
serum hGH (above endogenous baseline) followed the lonapegsomatropin levels but at a 100-fold lower 
concentration level. An approximate dose-proportional increase in lonapegsomatropin and hGH exposure was 
observed following single and repeated dosing and both compounds were not considered to accumulate (< 2-
fold) following repeated dosing. Increases in hGH levels were found to be associated with sustained elevated 
IGF-I levels. 
Across all these monkey studies, anti-hGH binding ADAs were only detected in 3 out of 110 treated animals 
(~3%) with no apparent impact on exposure. Anti-PEG binding antibodies were not detected in the 26- and 
52-week repeat-dose study.  
Autocleavage of lonapegsomatropin releases hGH, the leaving group and the linker moiety attached to mPEG. 
Pharmacokinetic profiling was not performed for the leaving group. The leaving group was assessed in the 
26- and 52-week monkey study, only at 24, 36, and 48 h post-dose, and found only in very low levels, below 
or up to 3-fold above the LLOQ (50 pg/ml) at the highest dose tested (4.8 mg/kg). Using LC-MS/MS, the 
mPEG-linker and the mPEG-backbone was quantified at week 26, and both concentration-time profiles were 
comparable at all dose levels, indicating the mPEG-linker molecule remains intact. 
Concerning serum mPEG, which was assessed in all five monkey studies, a dose-proportional increase in 
exposure was found and a 2- to 4-fold increase upon repeated dosing. Steady-state (SS) serum 
concentrations of mPEG were obtained approximately by Week 13, and levels were about 10- to 16-fold 
higher than lonapegsomatropin. The accumulation may be due to a lower clearance as the serum terminal 
elimination half-life of mPEG was found to be above 370 hrs up to 1310 hrs. Although mPEG was present in 
the systemic circulation, there were no quantifiable levels of mPEG (LLOQ 500 ng/ml) in the CSF at necropsy 
from main study animals or recovery animals in the 26- and 52-week studies indicating at least a 634-fold 
margin (serum/CSF). 
Distribution 
Dedicated distribution studies of lonapegsomatropin have not been conducted. This was acceptable to the 
CHMP, since somatropin (hGH) released from lonapegsomatropin is considered to be distributed in the same 
manner as endogenous GH. Given the size of the mPEG molecule (40 kDa), transiently bound to hGH, the 
volume of distribution is expected to be limited to the vascular space and extravascular space of highly 
vascularized organs and lymphatic tissues as well as mononuclear phagocyte system containing organs such 
as liver, spleen, kidney, lung, heart, and choroid plexus.  
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 34/142 
 
 
 
The distribution pattern of PEG has been investigated extensively and is well described in the literature. The 
non-cleavable portion of the linker covalently attached to mPEG is expected to follow the distribution and 
excretion pattern for mPEG(-linker). The high molecular weight mPEG limits its diffusion across membranes, 
thereby retaining the complex in the circulation. 
A semi-physiologically based PK model was established to estimate the time to reach steady-state, 
accumulation, and subsequent elimination of mPEG from the systemic circulation as well as from brain and 
peripheral tissue. In addition, the immunohistochemical presence of hGH (monkey only) and mPEG in the last 
injection site and selected areas of the brain is discussed in the toxicological section.  
Metabolism 
Autocleavage of lonapegsomatropin results in release of hGH, mPEG-linker and the leaving group. 
Recombinant hGH, when released from lonapegsomatropin in vivo, is considered to be metabolized in the 
same manner as endogenous GH, where GH is catabolized in the liver and kidney to its constitutive amino 
acids. 
In vitro release studies in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), showed that lonapegsomatropin, via 
autocleavage, releases hGH in a temperature- and pH-dependent fashion reaching a plateau above 90% 
ultimately. At 37°C and pH 7.4, the in vitro hydrolysis release kinetics showed a half-life of 105 h for ACP-
011 (lonapegsomatropin) and similar results were found with its predecessor ACP-001 (107 h). A faster 
release of hGH was observed at increased temperature or increased pH.  
Excretion 
Dedicated excretion studies on lonapegsomatropin have not been conducted. This was found acceptable by 
the CHMP, since somatropin released from lonapegsomatropin is considered to be excreted in the same 
manner as endogenous GH. 
Clearance of (m)PEG molecules is largely through glomerular filtration and excretion in urine, predominantly 
as intact PEG, and to a much lesser degree as smaller-sized degraded PEG. Hepatobiliary removal via 
hepatocyte and/or Kupffer cell uptake in the liver represents a minor route of PEG excretion and mPEG was 
observed to clear from the systemic circulation during the recovery phase of the long-term toxicity studies in 
rat and monkeys. 
In conclusion, within each species, similar TK data were obtained across the lonapegsomatropin studies. 
However, an interspecies comparison between rats, rabbits and monkeys is generally compromised given the 
high incidence of antibodies observed in rats and rabbits following repeated dosing, while there is a very low 
incidence of anti-hGH antibodies in monkeys. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology  
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity  
No single dose toxicity studies were included in the non-clinical safety programme and this was considered 
acceptable by the CHMP, since such studies are not required for compounds requiring chronic administration. 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 35/142 
 
 
 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity  
In the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats, with dosages up to 4.8 mg hGH/kg/week SC, no adverse effects 
have been found. The rats were 6-8 weeks at study initiation and reached adulthood during the pivotal 26-
week study. Noteworthy findings related to treatment with lonapegsomatropin were decreased body weight 
gain in male rats correlating with reduced food consumption and changes in cholesterol and triglyceride 
levels, which all resolved during the recovery period. These last two findings were expected pharmacological 
effects of exposure to hGH. Small vacuoles in choroid plexus epithelium at ≥1.2 mg/kg for 26 weeks were 
related to mPEG. Because there was no evidence of distortion of cytoplasmic or nuclear compartments, 
degeneration, or necrosis in cells containing mPEG IHC stained granules or vacuoles, the NOAEL was 
considered 4.8 mg hGH/kg/week. 
In two 4-week repeat-dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys, no adverse or other important effects 
were shown up to the maximum dose of 3 mg hGH/kg/week SC. After an investigative non-GLP study of 3 
mg hGH/kg/week SC, for 26 weeks in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys, a pivotal GLP 26-week study in this 
animal model was performed with doses up to 4.8 mg hGH/kg/week and a 26-week recovery period. The 
biomarker for hGH exposure IGF-I was increased above endogenous baseline levels for all treated animals 
and was dose depended. Most important findings at doses ≥1.2 mg/kg (lowest dose) were a minor increase in 
body weight, a minor decrease of cholesterol, and mild dilated mammary gland ducts, all expected 
exaggerated pharmacological responses to hGH, and completely resolved after the recovery period. Also, 
minimal vacuolation of choroid plexus epithelial cells, and granular mPEG IHC staining in several brain barrier 
elements were seen. The vacuolation was unlikely to represent a biologically significant finding. Due to the 
absence of distortion of cytoplasmic or nuclear compartments, degeneration or necrosis of the stained cells or 
surrounding cells/areas, none of these observations were considered adverse. Furthermore, the mPEG IHC 
staining and/or vacuolation was not associated with any adverse clinical signs, including CNS evaluation for 
tremors, convulsions, reactivity to handling, and unusual behaviour, conducted as part of the weekly clinical 
observations. The NOAEL was considered 4.8 mg hGH/kg/week. 
In a 52-week toxicity study in juvenile monkeys, aged 13.5 to 17.5 months at the start of dosing, followed by 
a subsequent 52-week treatment-free period, doses up to 4.8 mg hGH/kg/week SC showed comparable 
effects as in the 26-week study. At ≥0.4 mg/kg body weight increased a little, and cholesterol, triglycerides, 
and glucose (only in females) decreased slightly. At ≥1.6 mg/kg (males 4.8 mg/kg) mild dilated mammary 
gland ducts were shown, and at ≥1.6 mg/kg, minimal vacuolation of choroid plexus epithelial cells and 
granular mPEG IHC staining in several brain barrier elements were shown. Again, the NOAEL was considered 
4.8 mg hGH/kg/week. The amount of anti-drug antibodies was negligible, and the exposure margins related 
to the intended dose in GHD children of 0.24 mg hGH/kg/week were 38 for the AUC and 17 for the Cmax. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity  
In the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay, partly cleaved lonapegsomatropin did not increase in 
revertant colony counts in the presence or the absence of Aroclor-induced rat liver S9 mix and was 
comparable to vehicle control values. In contrast, positive controls 2-NF, SA, 9AAD and MMS all resulted in a 
robust increase in the number of revertant colonies. In vitro assessment of chromosomal aberration of 
human peripheral blood lymphocytes showed no significant or dose-dependent increases in structural or 
numerical chromosomal aberrations across the entire dose range (50-500 µg/ml) after 4 and 20 hours 
without S9-mix and after 4 hours with S9 mix. No cytotoxicity was observed for any treatment group. In 
contrast, the positive control mitomycin resulted in a statistically significant increase in structurally aberrant

cells. Micronuclei formation was evaluated in the 1 month repeat dose toxicity study in rats. This is 
considered acceptable. Analysis of the bone marrow of the femoral bone did not show a significant increase in 
micronuclei at doses up to 3 mg/kg given once per week for 4 weeks. In contrast, the positive control 
cyclophosphamide increased the number of micronuclei significantly. In conclusion, the genotoxicity of 
lonapegsomatropin has been studied concerning gene mutations in bacteria and mammalian cells and 
chromosomal aberrations in vitro and in vivo. The genotoxic potential for lonapegsomatropin is low. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity  
A weight of evidence approach based on non-clinical and clinical literature indicated that hGH and IGF-I did 
not have any relevant cancer risk. Recently published data from several long-term clinical studies showed no 
evidence of increased malignancy or cancer incidence in patients treated with recombinant hGH in childhood. 
These clinical data are supported by published nonclinical data from 2-year carcinogenicity studies in rats and 
mice with daily administration of high levels of recombinant rodent GH, demonstrating a complete absence of 
GH-related carcinogenic effects. Toxicology studies with lonapegsomatropin and the products of autocleavage 
(the leaving group, linker and mPEG) as well as supporting literature searches and computational 
assessments and genotoxicity evaluations were not suggestive of carcinogenic potential. Based on this 
assessment, no formal carcinogenicity studies in rodents have been performed. This is acknowledged and 
agreed. Lonapegsomatropin has no carcinogenic potential.   
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity  
In the fertility and early embryonic development study, rats were administered 0, 0.35, 0.7 and 1.4 mg 
hGH/kg lonapegsomatropin by SC every 48 h. This dosing regimen was implemented as an attempt to 
increase the exposure coverage to lonapegsomatropin and the products of autocleavage, as complete 
coverage over the dosing period could not be claimed for the weekly administration. The majority of animals 
were exposed to lonapegsomatropin, hGH, and mPEG at 1.4 mg hGH/kg, but anti-hGH binding antibodies 
were detected in nearly all animals. Some non-adverse changes in body weight gain were observed. There 
was no evidence of effects on reproductive performance/fertility, including ovarian, uterine or male 
reproductive parameters, and there were no embryo-lethal effects, at any dose level, and the NOAEL was 
considered to be 1.4 mg hGH/kg/48 h. 
In an embryo-foetal developmental toxicity study, rats were administered lonapegsomatropin by SC injection 
on Days 6 and 13 of gestation. Administration of 0.75, 1.5, or 3.0 mg hGH/kg/dose resulted in binding anti-
hGH antibodies in 12/20, 16/20, and 10/20 animals, respectively, but none of the animals tested positive for 
neutralizing antibodies. There was no test article related effects on pregnancy performance or foetal weights 
or morphology, including skeletal ossification. 
In rabbits, pregnant animals were administered 0, 0.35, 0.70, and 1.4 mg hGH/kg/48 h lonapegsomatropin 
from GD 7 to 19. Binding anti-hGH antibodies were detected in most samples at GD 17 and 29, impacting the 
serum concentrations of lonapegsomatropin and hGH. Body weight loss (especially after GD13), reduced food 
intake (especially after GD13), and increased serum FFA levels (4 to 9 times) were noted, possibly related to 
an exaggerated pharmacological effect. There was evidence of embryo-foetal mortality (increased number of 
resorptions and foetal death) at 1.4 mg hGH/kg/48 h and a number of different foetal abnormalities 
(dysmorphogenesis, including hydrocephaly, heart and major vessel malformations, and/or mispositioned 
kidney) at all dose levels. 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 37/142 
 
 
 
In a pre- and post-natal development study, ACP-001 was administered SC to female rats at doses of 0.75, 
1.5, 3.0 mg hGH- equivalent/kg/week for 6 weeks on Days 6, 13, and 20 of gestation, and Days 6, 13, and 
20 of lactation. There were no adverse treatment-related effects on pre and postnatal development, but anti-
hGH binding antibodies were present in the majority of the F0 generation animals over the course of the 
study; a proportion of these exhibited neutralizing capacity. Only at the first days after each dosing, 
sufficiently high peak levels are reached, but this peak and valley pattern appears different from the human 
situation. No specific mPEG IHC staining was noted in the F1 pups. Also, there was an absence of quantifiable 
concentrations of ACP-001, and hGH in serum from F1 pups on Day 22 of lactation, 2 days following the last 
dose to F0 animals, indicating that ACP-001 and products of autocleavage do not pass the placenta or are 
excreted in milk. 
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data  
The program assessed the safety of lonapegsomatropin as well as the products of autocleavage (hGH, mPEG, 
and the leaving group) through SC administration at dose levels up to 20-fold the clinical therapeutic dose of 
0.24 mg hGH/kg/week. Within each species, similar TK data were obtained across the lonapegsomatropin 
studies after a slow absorption. However, an interspecies comparison between rats, rabbits and monkeys is 
generally compromised given the high incidence of antibodies observed in rats and rabbits following repeated 
dosing, while there is a very low incidence of anti-hGH antibodies in monkeys.  
In the rat, a dose related increase in exposure was observed for hGH and lonapegsomatropin. Upon repeated 
dosing, however, given the ADA response, exposure decreased, and dose proportionality could not be 
assessed. In the monkey, systemic exposure to lonapegsomatropin, hGH, and mPEG was independent of sex, 
was comparable in juvenile and adult monkeys, and increased in an approximate dose proportional manner. 
In the rat, sex differences were observed resulting in higher exposures in males than females, whereas, in 
the monkey no sex differences were apparent. In general, the pharmacokinetic profile of hGH followed the 
lonapegsomatropin levels but at a 100- and 16- to 46-fold lower serum concentration level in monkey and 
rat, respectively. 
Steady state of mPEG in the systemic circulation was reached at approximately Week 13 in both rats and 
monkeys. In the monkey, mPEG accumulated by approximately 2- to 4-fold at steady state leading to 10-fold 
higher levels than lonapegsomatropin. A long half-life was observed in both species: 485 to 950 h in rats and 
370 to 1,310 h in monkeys, following the end of the 26/27- and 52-week dosing period in both rats and 
monkeys. 
2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance following SC administration of lonapegsomatropin was assessed as part of the repeat-dose 
toxicity studies conducted in rats and monkeys, covering both the ‘acute’ and longer-term periods. In these 
studies, comprehensive observations of the injection sites were based on dermal scoring and histological 
examination (H&E staining). In the rats, only very slight to slight oedema and/or erythema were occasionally 
noted in treated animals and controls. In the 52-week monkey study, the microscopic finding of increased 
adipocytes in injection sites was limited to lonapegsomatropin treated animals. Vacuolated macrophages and 
mononuclear cell infiltration were observed in injection sites more prominent at 4.8 mg hGH/kg/week and 
was considered related to a local effect of lonapegsomatropin. All injection site findings demonstrated full 
reversibility.

In a local lymph node assay (LLNA) with mice with partly cleaved ACP-001 at concentrations of the leaving 
group up to 23 μg/mL, this did not induce skin sensitization. This concentration of the leaving group is at a 
high overage compared to the clinical steady-state concentrations. Since ACP-001 and lonapegsomatropin 
contain the same TransCon linker and consequently release the leaving group during autocleavage of the 
linker, the results from the LLNA study conducted with ACP-001 were considered relevant, which is agreed by 
the CHMP. 
No significant absorbance was observed in the range of wavelengths from 230 to 700 nm, in alignment with 
the lack of chromophores in the leaving group. Thus, no concern for phototoxicity for the leaving group was 
demonstrated. The phototoxicity assay was not considered relevant for lonapegsomatropin, hGH, mPEG, or 
the remainder of the TransCon linker. 
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies  
No immunotoxicity or dependence studies have been conducted for Lonapegsomatropin, which is accepted by 
the CHMP.  
Based on comprehensive evaluations of literature searches, review of expert opinions, and QSAR evidence, it 
was concluded that the structural elements of the leaving group, TransCon linker, and mPEG did not show 
evidence of carcinogenicity or genetic toxicity in humans. 
The results of the nonclinical safety studies on impurities sufficiently justify the specification limits set for 
release and throughout the entire shelf-life for lonapegsomatropin drug substance and drug product. 
The excipients were also tested, as in all nonclinical safety studies the animals received dose formulations 
with the same excipients at similar or higher concentrations as in the clinical presentations. Tromethamine, 
trehalose dihydrate (Nelson 2015), and succinic acid are commonly used excipients in parental formulations 
for human use and are regarded as safe. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment  
The active substance somatropin is a nonglycosylated 22 kDa protein consisting of 191 amino acids, that is 
identical to the human growth hormone (hGH). Considering that the substance is a protein, the ERA can 
consist of a justification for not submitting ERA studies. As per the EMA Q&A document on ERA 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev.1), this is also applicable to protein substances that might be potential 
endocrine-disrupting substances such as hGH. Therefore, the CHMP agrees that the ERA can consist of a 
justification for not submitting ERA studies. Consequently, a phase I and PBT assessment are not required for 
the active substance somatropin. 
Based on the highest dose reported in the SPC of 22 mg somatropin weekly, which corresponds to 41.6 mg of 
the linker and mPEG succinimide molecule, and a refined Fpen of 0.004 based on prevalence for growth 
hormone deficiency in the EU of 4 in 10,000 (EU/3/19/2213), a refined PECsw of 0.0012 µg/L is calculated for 
the linker and mPEG succinimide molecule. As this is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L, a phase II is not 
warranted for the linker and mPEG succinimide molecule.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects  
Pharmacology 
No dedicated in vivo pharmacology studies were performed with lonapegsomatropin. In vivo studies were 
performed with ACP-001, the 4x20 kDa predecessor of lonapegsomatropin. ACP-001 was used as a 
comparator in the in vitro studies and was shown to release comparable hGH in terms of mass and integrity 
of released hGH, in vitro dissociation (kd) from hGHR, and potency of released hGH. Furthermore, PD 
equivalence with respect to the serum concentration-time profiles of IGF-I was demonstrated in the clinical 
bioequivalence study CT-101 with ACP-001 and lonapegsomatropin. These in vitro and clinical findings 
support the view that pharmacodynamic data obtained with ACP-001 can be supportive for the evaluation of 
the PD of lonapegsomatropin. PD studies in rats (1q3d) and cynomolgus monkeys (1qw) indicate that ACP-
001 is approximately twice as potent as somatropin (1qd) on µg hGH/kg body weight basis. Nevertheless, the 
strength of this evidence is limited due to the low number of animals and in monkeys, somatropin and ACP-
001 were administered in two different experiments so that no direct comparison can be made. 
More convincing PD data were obtained in the repeated dose toxicity studies, especially those in cynomolgus 
monkeys, where the IGF-I levels in monkeys administered lonapegsomatropin SC once per week remained 
consistently elevated throughout the week after administration. These increases were generally dose related. 
In the repeated dose toxicity studies in rats, the PD effects were less consistent. Interference of anti-hGH 
anti-drug antibodies or changes in food intake may have affected the results. 
No secondary pharmacology studies were performed. In addition to an effect on growth, somatropin has 
secondary effects, e.g. on glucose transport, lipolysis or endocrine effects. These effects are considered to be 
mediated by hGH interaction with the GH receptor in various tissues. hGH released from lonapegsomatropin 
is shown to be equivalent to somatropin (as indicated above). Consequently, there is no need to study the 
secondary pharmacological effects of lonapegsomatropin. Where relevant, secondary effects have been 
included in the SmPC: insulin sensitivity, hypoadrenalism, and thyroid function. 
Drug interactions for recombinant hGH are well-known from approved marketed hGH products with once-
daily administration. Potential interaction with oestrogen containing therapy is included in the SmPC. None of 
the other components following lonapegsomatropin autocleavage warrant assessment of drug interaction 
potentials as mPEG is considered biologically inert and systemic concentrations of the leaving group was 
below LLOQ (25.0 pg/mL) at clinical steady-state concentrations at the therapeutic dose level of 0.24 mg 
hGH/kg/week. Therefore, it can be agreed that drug interaction studies have not been conducted. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The bioanalytical methods used to quantify lonapegsomatropin, hGH, mPEG, IGF-I and the leaving group in 
the GLP studies have been adequately validated. In rat, however, the toxicokinetic (TK) hGH concentration 
data are impacted by anti-hGH antibodies and assay interference. Therefore, the safety margins concerning 
human exposure in GHD children as determined in the monkey are the most relevant. 
No formal ADME studies have been performed with lonapegsomatropin to characterize the pharmacokinetic 
profile of lonapegsomatropin and its release products: hGH, mPEG and the leaving group. Toxicokinetic data 
were used, as generated in the context of the repeat-dose toxicity studies performed in adult rats and 
monkeys and juvenile monkeys with once-weekly sc administration as in clinical. The toxicokinetic profile of 
the leaving group was assessed in rats, and only a sparse sampling was performed at 3 time points in the 
juvenile studies in cynomolgus monkeys. The choice of a sparse sampling in juvenile monkeys was 
acknowledged and the theoretical Cmax values were estimated using available PK data and the fact that 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 40/142 
 
 
 
lonapegsomatropin is releasing the leaving group in a 1:1 ratio. According to these estimations, the exposure 
ratio to human was at least 3, demonstrating that the animals were appropriately exposed to the leaving 
group to assess the safety profile. 
Within each species, similar TK data were obtained across the lonapegsomatropin studies after a slow 
absorption. However, an interspecies comparison between rats, rabbits and monkeys is generally 
compromised given the high incidence of antibodies observed in rats and rabbits following repeated dosing, 
while there is a very low incidence of anti-hGH antibodies in monkeys.  
In the rat, a dose-related increase in exposure was observed for hGH and lonapegsomatropin. Upon repeated 
dosing, however, given the ADA response, exposure decreased, and dose proportionality could not be 
assessed. In the monkey, systemic exposure to lonapegsomatropin, hGH, and mPEG was independent of sex, 
was comparable in juvenile and adult monkeys, and increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner. 
In the rat, sex differences were observed, resulting in higher exposures in males than females, whereas, in 
the monkey, no sex differences were apparent. In general, the pharmacokinetic profile of hGH followed the 
lonapegsomatropin levels but at a 100- and 16- to 46-fold lower serum concentration level in monkey and 
rat, respectively. 
Steady-state of mPEG in the systemic circulation was reached at approximately Week 13 in both rats and 
monkeys. In the monkey, mPEG accumulated by approximately 2- to 4-fold at steady-state leading to 10-fold 
higher levels than lonapegsomatropin. A long half-life was observed in both species: 485 to 950 h in rats and 
370 to 1,310 h in monkeys, following the end of the 26/27- and 52-week dosing period in both rats and 
monkeys. 
Toxicology 
Repeat dose: 
No adverse effects were found in rats; however, anti-hGH antibodies were evident. The effective amount of 
exposure is uncertain by the effect of neutralizing antibodies and the exposure margins in the rat (0.7 to 1.4) 
are much too small. Therefore, the rat studies are considered insufficient reliable to produce firm statements 
on toxicity. 
mPEG: 
An extensive evaluation of mPEG was performed. This is appreciated because there is a concern regarding 
PEGylated products for the PEG moiety, or that of the very closely related mPEG, with a high molecular 
weight (MW ≥30 kDa) when given to young children. Relatively low doses of PEG can cause vacuoles in the 
brain barrier elements of laboratory animals, especially in the choroid plexus (CP), and there is no marker for 
CP functionality. Because of the still developing brains in very young children and the uncertainty considering 
the consequences of the observed vacuolisation, currently, PEGylated products for long-term use are not 
approved for children <12 years old, as a precaution. 
A recent paper of Fletcher et al., 2019 tried to establish a threshold for PEG burden beyond which there are 
alterations in tissue architecture that could potentially lead to dysfunction. A high SC dose of 160 mg 
PEG/kg/week of a 40 kDa PEGylated molecule to cynomolgus monkeys for 3 months was still clinically well 
tolerated but led to adverse histopathological findings, while a dose of ≤120 mg PEG/kg/week did not lead to 
any adverse findings. The high PEG dose applied in this publication is about 360 times higher than the mPEG 
dose administered with lonapegsomatropin to GHD children (0.45 mg mPEG/kg/week). However, the 
exposure time is much shorter than that of lonapegsomatropin, and the monkeys were considerably older, 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 41/142 
 
 
 
namely 3 to 7 years old instead of 13.5 to 17.5 months at the start of dosing. Also, no kinetic data were 
measured or shown. 
At PEG doses ≤120 mg/kg/week, the choroid plexus tissue architecture appeared normal and, other than the 
presence of vacuoles, was comparable to vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 8A, B). At 160 mg/kg/week, 
individual, small clusters, or sheets of vacuolated macrophages expanded the choroid plexus interstitium and 
surrounded blood vessels (Fig. 8C). As a result of the severity of vacuolation in several monkeys, the 
presence of a continuous sheet of perivascular vacuolated macrophages, and the expansion of the 
interstitium by sheets of macrophages, choroid plexus macrophage vacuolation at a PEG dose of 160 
mg/kg/week was considered to be adverse due to the potential for functional consequences, despite the lack 
of overt signs of neurologic effects in this study (Fletcher et al., 2019).

An extensive nonclinical evaluation of potential mPEG toxicity was conducted in adolescent/adult rats and 
juvenile monkeys following weekly SC dosing of lonapegsomatropin for up to 27 and 52 weeks, respectively. 
In these studies, mPEG levels were investigated in both the systemic circulation and in CSF. Standard 
histopathology included routine H&E staining of the central (cerebrum, midbrain, cerebellum [including CP], 
medulla/pons, and spinal cord) and peripheral (sciatic nerve) nervous system. Comprehensive hGH and 
mPEG IHC staining, using a highly sensitive staining methodology, was performed on multiple brain regions 
with high GHR expression and high vascularization, including the 2 circumventricular organs (CVOs) CP and 
median eminence, considered representative for other CVOs in the brain. Detailed clinical observation 
focusing on the CNS were also included. However, because of the forming of anti-drug antibodies, the effects 
in rats are considered of minor importance. 
In the monkey, after administration of lonapegsomatropin at 0.40 mg hGH/kg/week (0.75 mg 
mPEG/kg/week) for 52 weeks, vacuolation was not observed by light microscopy (H&E staining) in CP or any 
other brain area. Therefore, this dose was considered the NOEL. At 1.6 and 4.8 mg hGH/kg (3.0 and 9.0 mg 
mPEG/kg/week, respectively) the observed vacuolation of CP epithelial cells and macrophages was not 
associated with evidence of distortion of cytoplasmic or nuclear compartments, degeneration, necrosis, or 
inflammation, was considered unlikely to impact cell or organ function, and hence was considered non-
adverse. Besides, no adverse clinical signs, including CNS evaluation for tremors, convulsions, reactivity to 
handling, and unusual behaviour, conducted as part of the weekly clinical observations, were seen. 
Therefore, 4.8 mg hGH/kg/week was considered the NOAEL, which is 18 times lower than the considered 
adverse PEG dose in the study of Fletcher et al., 2019. 
However, at 0.4 mg hGH/kg for 52 weeks, mPEG IHC staining did reveal granular staining in CP epithelial 
cells (all animals, minimal to mild in intensity; very rare to occasional in frequency), in <1% of macrophages 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 42/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(in 1 animal, minimal to mild in intensity), and in <1% of specialized glial cells (in 2 animals, minimal in 
intensity). IHC stained vacuoles were only observed in a few CP epithelial cells (all animals) and specialized 
glial cells (in 1 animal). Full reversibility of mPEG IHC staining of macrophages, specialized glial cells, and CP 
epithelial cells (in the third ventricle only) was observed after the treatment-free period at the low dose level 
and partially at the high dose level. Because of the highly sensitive IHC methodology, it is concluded that it is 
unlikely that it represents a biologically significant finding. 
In the 27-week rat study and the 52-week monkey study, mPEG IHC staining was predominantly detected in 
tissues associated with brain barrier function with high vascularity and only observed in cell types with a 
physiological direct exposure to plasma macromolecules either in circulation or in the interstitial vicinity of 
CVOs, and that lonapegsomatropin and mPEG did not pass or compromise the blood-brain barrier or blood-
CSF barrier structure. There are no indications in the literature that the brain barriers in children, including 
infants, should be more permeable to mPEG than those of adults. 
It is noted that the monkeys in the 52-week study were exposed for close to 10 months at steady-state 
(based on Cmax) and even longer above the mPEG systemic exposure vacuolation threshold of 100 μg 
PEG/mL (defined by Jacobsen 2017 and BPAC 2017).  
During the 52-week treatment-free period in monkeys, systemic exposure to mPEG declined and was below 
the LLOQ of 500 ng/mL at 7, 39, or 52 (in 2/4 animals) weeks into the treatment-free period for the 0.40, 
1.6, and 4.8 mg hGH/kg/week dose groups, respectively. The reversibility of mPEG IHC staining in the 
different cell types is likely a combined process of cell turnover, potential reuptake, migration of cells 
(macrophages), phagosome degradation of mPEG, and/or exocytosis, and mPEG is expected to be 
predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine by renal filtration. 
Steady-state (SS) levels of mPEG in the systemic circulation in monkeys were reached following 
approximately 13 weeks of repeated dosing. In a 52-week phase 3 study in GHD children (CT-301), 
investigating the safety and efficacy of lonapegsomatropin in prepubertal children, systemic mPEG levels 
were approaching SS around 3 months. 
In a 2-compartment allometrically scaled PK-model the mPEG concentration in serum and choroid plexus in 
monkey and GHD children for up to 4 years of treatment followed by a 2-year treatment-free period was 
predicted. The time to reach SS in the CP in GHD children is estimated to be 16 months, which reflects the 
very slow distribution from the circulation to CP. The predicted median SS level of mPEG in CP of GHD 
children administered lonapegsomatropin at 0.24 mg hGH/kg/week was ~2-fold below the SS levels in CP of 
monkeys at the NOEL of H&E stained vacuoles (0.40 mg hGH/kg/week), and furthermore, ~30-fold below the 
SS level in CP of monkeys at the NOAEL (4.8 mg hGH/kg/week) after 52 weeks repeated dosing. In GHD 
children, 90% of mPEG is cleared from the systemic circulation within approximately 3 months from the end 
of treatment, based on a predicted systemic half-life of 26 days, and 90% of mPEG is cleared from CP within 
16 months, based on the predicted half-life of approximately 5 months. However, some uncertainties remain 
regarding the used PK-model. 
The Safety Working Party (SWP) defined a threshold for observation of vacuolation in CP epithelial cells (H&E 
stained) at 0.4 μmol PEG/kg/month equivalent to 3.7 mg PEG (40 kDa)/kg/week (CHMP 2012). In 
comparison, the dose of mPEG in the 52-week toxicity study in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys at the NOEL of 
H&E stained vacuoles (0.40 mg hGH/kg/week) is 0.75 mg mPEG/kg/week and hence almost 5-fold below this 
threshold. The mPEG dose at the clinical therapeutic dose level of 0.24 mg hGH/kg/week is 0.45 mg 
mPEG/kg/week, and hence more than 8-fold below the CHMP indicated threshold.  
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 43/142 
 
 
 
The systemic SS mPEG level in monkeys (Cmax) for the low dose group (0.40 mg hGH/kg/week) at the NOEL 
of vacuoles (H&E staining) was ~25 μg/ml. In the GHD paediatric population (CT-301), the observed 
systemic SS mPEG level was ~13 μg/ml at the therapeutic lonapegsomatropin dose of 0.24 mg 
hGH/kg/week, giving an exposure margin close to 1.9-fold. However, there is not a NOEL for vacuolation 
detected by IHC staining; therefore, vacuolation in children’s CP is possible; though it would be expected to 
be a very slight effect. The problem is that vacuolation tends to grow with a longer duration, and the monkey 
study was only one year (or about two years when the recovery period is also taken into account). According 
to ICH S11, the central nervous system develops during the whole children’s lifespan but is strongest until 
the age of 2 – 3 years, which would be more or less covered by the monkey study. Besides, according to 
Fletcher et al. (2019), comparison with the 120 mg/kg/week PEG dose group in a previous 2-week toxicity 
study in monkeys (unpublished data in Fletcher 2019) demonstrated that increasing dose duration was only 
associated with an increase in the number of affected tissues with no qualitative changes in the level of 
vacuolation observed. Their interpretation is that the rate of PEG uptake in tissues appeared to be only 
slightly higher than the rate of excretion from the body at doses ≤ 120 mg/kg/week, which resulted in fairly 
minimal, albeit more widespread, vacuolation over time. This seems to be also the case in the studies with 
lonapegsomatropin. This makes it reasonable that a very low dose of 0.45 mg PEG/kg/week (ca. 360 times 
lower than the adverse dose (Fletcher, 2019), and 8 times lower than the acclaimed safe dose of 3.7 mg 
PEG/kg/week (CHMP, 2012) has a very low chance of getting adverse. 
In conclusion, from a non-clinical point of view the risk for adverse effects caused by vacuolation in the 
brains of young children at the intended dose of lonapegsomatropin is very small. 
Reproduction toxicology: 
There was no evidence of effects on fertility and embryo-fetal development at any dose level in rats. 
However, the exposures to lonapegsomatropin, hGH and mPEG at this dose were lower or around the 
intended human exposures; therefore, no firm conclusions can be made. For the embryo-fetal development 
study in rabbits the levels of lonapegsomatropin, hGH and mPEG during GD7 and GD13 were about 5 times 
higher than in the clinical intended exposure and dose-related, although with a large spreading. Also, the 
number of abnormalities induced in this interval were dose-related, although possibly not by type; there were 
a lot of types. Lower food consumption was stated as maternal toxicity, but those who were losing weight 
were fed extra with a special diet, so there was no large weight loss. Besides, reduced food intake and 
induced body weight loss occurred in the period from GDs 13 to 17, while the sensitive period for 
malformation is in the second week. Also, FFA spiked on GD13 only at a high dose. It was demonstrated by 
Laron et al. (1966) that in rabbits, hGH does not reach the foetus during the third week of gestation (i.e., 
approximately GDs 14 to 21), and Fhölenhag et al. (1994) similarly demonstrated that the foetuses of female 
rats exposed to GH during late gestation (GD 20/21) were unexposed to GH. Also, exaggerated 
pharmacology by hGH would be expected to induce teratogenicity by hyperglycaemia, but there was no 
indication for this. Therefore, the findings are inconclusive, as reflected in sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC.  
Phototoxicity: 
The phototoxicity assay was not considered relevant for lonapegsomatropin, hGH, mPEG, the remainder of 
the TransCon linker or the leaving group. The leaving group is not considered relevant as it is not expected 
that the leaving group accumulates in the skin or eye and is found only in very low levels in the systemic 
circulation.  
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment: 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution of 
Assessment report

Page 44/142 
 
 
 
the substance in the environment. Therefore, lonapegsomatropin is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects  
Overall, the primary pharmacodynamic studies provided adequate evidence that lonapegsomatropin is a long-
acting, transiently pegylated somatropin growth hormone designed to release somatropin with the same 
mode of action and distribution as daily somatropin, but with a once-weekly injection. In long-term studies in 
cynomolgus monkeys, a consistent elevation of plasma IGF-I has been demonstrated. The safety studies did 
not reveal untoward functional effects in vital organ systems. 
From a non-clinical point of view, there are no outstanding other concerns that need to be addressed. 
Therefore, lonapegsomatropin is considered approvable from a non-clinical point of view.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology  
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics  
At physiologic pH and temperature, lonapegsomatropin releases fully active, unmodified hGH via 
autocleavage of the linker in a controlled manner that follows first-order kinetics.  
Two clinical pharmacology studies were conducted to investigate PK and PD of lonapegsomatropin (CT-101 
and CT-102). Both were randomized, open-label, single dose studies in healthy volunteers. In addition, PK 
and PD assessments were made in Phase 2 (CT-004) and Phase 3 studies (CT-301 and CT-302) in paediatric 
subjects. In Phase 3 studies this was in part based on intensive sampling with non-compartmental analysis as 
well as sparse sampling and population analyses. 
Single dose, cross-over Study CT-101 compared (for bridging purposes) PK and PD, measured as hGH and 
IGF-I, between lonapegsomatropin and ACP-001 (predecessor molecule of lonapegsomatropin). ACP-001 was 
used in the dose finding Phase 2 study, CT-004, which was conducted before Study CT-101. Furthermore, 
Study CT-101 investigated PK and PD of lonapegsomatropin at three different dose levels. A formal endpoint 
for bioequivalence was not included in the study, however, the study was designed following the principles for 
bioequivalence studies as provided in applicable EMA guidelines.  
Single dose, cross-over bioequivalence Study CT-102 compared PK and PD, measured as hGH and IGF-I, of 
lonapegsomatropin administered via syringe/needle (reconstituted drug from single-use glass vial) or via GH 
Auto-Injector. The study was conducted following the principles for bioequivalence studies as provided in 
applicable EMA “Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence”.  
Bioanalysis 
The bioanalytical methods applied to PK and PD analyses were validated according to applicable guidelines. 
Incurred sample reproducibility (ISR) was included in both studies and passed acceptance for all analytes 
assessed. 
With respect to the anti-lonapegsomatropin and anti-hGH immunogenicity assays, these have been validated 
to a sufficient extent. Drug tolerance was acceptable for the binding assays. For the neutralising anti-hGH 
assay, lonapegsomatropin and hGH concentrations exceeded the tolerance level of the assay. However, this 
issue was resolved by taking samples at the trough level, allowing reliable assessment of the neutralising 
anti-hGH antibodies. 
Qualification of PK and PK/PD models 
The popPK model MODHGH002 was developed to estimate the serum PK for lonapegsomatropin and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 46/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
popPK/PD model for hGH/IGF-I. Lonapegsomatropin was described by a one-compartmental PK model with 
parallel first- and zero-order absorption from the subcutaneous administration site, with body weight and 
dose being a covariate for the volume of distribution, and body weight and gender being a covariate for 
maximum elimination rate. For hGH, PK was best described with a one-compartmental PK model with first-
order absorption and linear clearance, with body weight was a covariate for clearance and volume of 
distribution, gender and dose were also found to be covariates on clearance. For IGF-I, the final PK/PD model 
was an IGF-I turnover model with IGF-I-production stimulation by hGH, body weight as a covariate on Emax 
and kout and a correlation between kout and clearance. 
Another popPK model, MODHGH001, was developed in order to estimate the mPEG choroid plexus PK in 
cynomolgus monkey and human, extrapolated from mPEG choroid plexus data in rats. The outcome of this 
popPK study is discussed in the preclinical part of this AR in relation to the vacuolisation-related safety 
evaluation.  
Absorption  
Following SC administration, lonapegsomatropin distributes slowly (median tmax 36 h) from the SC 
administration site to the systemic circulation. Due to the autocleavage mechanism to release hGH, hGH can 
be liberated from lonapegsomatropin both at the administration site and in the systemic circulation. In 
paediatric GHD patients, the mean steady-state peak serum Cmax of lonapegsomatropin was 1230 ng /mL 
with a median Tmax of 25 hours. 
Systemic hGH was liberated from lonapegsomatropin with median Tmax for hGH observed at 16 h (range 8–48 
h) following dosing at 0.24 mg hGH/kg to healthy subjects in CT-101. At this dose, the mean observed hGH 
Cmax was 13.4 ng/mL, and hGH AUC0-168 was 617 h*ng/mL. In paediatric GHD patients, the mean steady-
state peak serum Cmax for released somatropin was 15.2 ng/mL with a median Tmax of 12 hours. The shape of 
the hGH concentration-time curve was similar to the lonapegsomatropin curve from the popPK study. This 
indicates that the linker release rate determines the shape of the hGH PK curve obtained by 
lonapegsomatropin, and the clearance of the free hGH determines the concentration difference between 
lonapegsomatropin and free hGH. The measured median Tmax of mPEG at 240 h is later than for hGH and 
lonapegsomatropin. This likely reflects the slow absorption of mPEG from the subcutaneous tissue. 
The leaving group serum levels could hardly be detected with the assay having a LLOQ of 25/50 pg/ml. 
Although the exact levels of this leaving group are unknown, considering the low levels, this issue is not 
further pursued. 
Results of bioequivalence Study CT-101 indicate that hGH levels are comparable for lonapegsomatropin and 
predecessor molecule ACP-001 at the 0.24 mg hGH/kg dose level, with the 90% CIs for the ratios for hGH 
AUC0-168, AUC0-336, and Cmax within the standard bioequivalence limits of 80-125%. Further, PD equivalence 
concerning the serum concentration-time profiles of IGF-I was demonstrated. Based on this outcome, PK 
data obtained with the predecessor molecule ACP-001 (e.g. in Study CT-004) are considered valuable for 
evaluating lonapegsomatropin PK a dose-finding. 
Results from Study CT-102 indicate that SC administration of lonapegsomatropin either via a syringe/needle 
or via the GH Auto-Injector results in comparable serum hGH and IGF-I exposure, since relevant 90% CI of 
Cmax, AUC0-168, AUC0-t, and AUC0-inf were all within the standard bioequivalence range of 80-125%. No 
appreciable difference in hGH or IGF-I inter-subject variation was observed between the two injection 
modalities. Based on this outcome, the clinical data obtained with lonapegsomatropin administered via a 
needle/syringe can be used to support the registration of lonapegsomatropin with the GH Auto-Injector.

Distribution 
Based on popPK modelling, the volume of distribution of lonapegsomatropin is 7.2 L (based on a 70 kg body 
weight). This Vd is close to the plasma volume, suggesting lonapegsomatropin is largely retained in the 
systemic circulation, probably due to its high molecular weight (63.2 kDa) limiting diffusion into tissues. The 
apparent volume of distribution V/F of lonapegsomatropin in children with GHD, an age of 8.5 years and a 
typical body weight of 19 kg for this age, was found to be 1.3 L.  
The assumed Vd of hGH is 70 mL/kg (i.e., 4.9 L based on a 70 kg body weight), based on the somatropin 
prescribing information. In the popPK model MODHGH002, the estimated Vd for hGH was much larger, i.e., 
374 L. The difference between the Vd for somatropin and hGH from lonapegsomatropin may be caused by the 
reduced bioavailability and the prolonged release rate of hGH when delivered in the form of 
lonapegsomatropin. 
Elimination 
The apparent half-life of lonapegsomatropin following single-dose administration to healthy subjects is 
approximately 52 h, whereas, in paediatric GHD patients, the mean half-life at steady-state was 30.7 h. The 
apparent half-life of hGH (when released from lonapegsomatropin) of approximately 24 h is much longer than 
for daily administered somatropin (2-3 h). The longer half-life is consistent with sustained release of hGH 
from lonapegsomatropin. 
The metabolic fate of mPEG has been investigated extensively in the literature, and the metabolism and 
excretion of mPEG are well understood. High molecular weight mPEGs such as from lonapegsomatropin are 
expected to be predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine by renal filtration. The apparent half-life of 
mPEG is approximately 500 h. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose-proportionality studies indicate a slightly higher than proportional increase in hGH levels with increasing 
dose, in a comparable fashion after a single dose and multiple-doses. Lonapegsomatropin is intended to be 
given as a 0.24 mg/kg weekly dose. Due to this fixed-dose posology, the observed more than dose-
proportional increase in lonapegsomatropin and hGH exposure, comparable after single and multiple-dose, is 
not considered an issue and will not be further pursued. 
Following multiple weekly administrations of lonapegsomatropin, no relevant accumulation was observed for 
hGH and Lonapegsomatropin. This finding is in line with the t1/2 of 25 and 50h for hGH and 
lonapegsomatropin, respectively. A marked 4.7-fold accumulation was observed for mPEG, which is expected 
based on the long t1/2 of 485h for this substance.  
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Lonapegsomatropin is considered to be cleared by the release of hGH and the PEG moieties. The hGH 
released from lonapegsomatropin is considered to be excreted in the same manner as endogenous GH. Data 
from the literature indicate that GH is cleared by 2 mechanisms, i.e., clearance by glomerular filtration and 
internalization and degradation of GH following interaction with growth hormone receptors present in a large 
number of tissues including the liver.  
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 48/142 
 
 
 
GHR binding and subsequent internalization and degradation are only considered relevant for the released 
hGH, as hGH within lonapegsomatropin is effectively shielded from receptor binding by the mPEG carrier (see 
preclinical AR). 
Clearance of the released mPEG molecules is known to proceed largely through glomerular filtration and 
excretion in urine, predominantly as intact mPEG.  
In light of the available knowledge on the clearance of hGH, the lack of specific studies on renal impairment 
is considered acceptable.  
Hepatic impairment 
In light of the available knowledge on the clearance of hGH and mPEG, the lack of specific studies towards 
hepatic impairment is considered acceptable. 
Gender 
Based on data from Studies CT-101 and CT-301 in PopPK Study MODHGH002, males have on average 33% 
higher hGH exposure than females. This difference is not considered to be clinically relevant.  
Race 
The effect of race on exposure to hGH from lonapegsomatropin provided in the Clinical Pharmacology 
summary is only based on data from Studies CT-101 and CT-301 in PopPK Study MODHGH002. Due to the 
limited number of non-White subjects in these 2 studies, no conclusion on the effect of race can be drawn at 
this stage. 
Body weight 
Lonapegsomatropin and hGH clearance increases with increasing body weight. 
Elderly 
No lonapegsomatropin and hGH PK data are available in the elderly, which is acceptable given the indication 
which is limited to paediatric GHD patients. 
Children 
In PopPK Study MODHGH002, no impact of age on hGH PK was evident once differences in body weight were 
accounted for. Therefore, age was not considered to have any additional impact on hGH exposure down to 
3.2 years of age, being the youngest patient included in Study CT-301. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies have not been conducted with lonapegsomatropin. As neither 
lonapegsomatropin, hGH nor mPEG are CYP substrates, the likelihood of drug-drug interactions is considered 
low. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics  
Pharmacology, primary pharmacodynamics and safety pharmacology endpoints have been obtained from in 
vitro and in vivo studies conducted with lonapegsomatropin.  
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 49/142 
 
 
 
 
In vitro studies have established that lonapegsomatropin can be considered as essentially inactive, since 
human growth hormone is effectively inactivated when bound to the carrier. Human growth hormone 
released from lonapegsomatropin is unmodified and shows a biopotency comparable to somatropin.  
Dedicated pharmacology studies on lonapegsomatropin were conducted in rats and monkeys and evaluated 
relative to daily somatropin. The continuous exposure to human growth hormone, following 
lonapegsomatropin administration, in contrast to intermittent exposure following daily somatropin, resulted in 
a more pronounced increase in systemic IGF-I concentration in monkeys as well as superior increases in body 
weight gain in hypophysectomized rats, compared to once-daily administration of somatropin at equivalent 
weekly doses. IGF-I is a recognized biomarker for human growth hormone activity. 
In contrast to human growth hormone released from lonapegsomatropin, other methods for creating long-
acting human growth hormone, based on modification by protein enlargement, exhibit an increased 
molecular size (range from 47.5 to >100 kDa). Hence their half-life is prolonged due to decreased renal and 
receptor-mediated clearance. These compounds may, however, as a result of increased molecular size, have 
restricted access to growth hormone receptors in some target tissues (e.g. growth plates and adipocytes) 
due to compromised tissue distribution while still effectively stimulating hepatic IGF-I production. This is due 
to facilitated access to hepatic growth hormone receptor via the glycocalyx-free open-fenestrated sinusoidal 
endothelium found in the liver. This can result in altered tissue ratios of human growth hormone and IGF-I, 
altering safety and efficacy compared to unmodified human growth hormone. 
Mechanism of action 
Growth hormone exerts its effects via growth hormone receptors, which are ubiquitously expressed in the 
body. GHR mRNA expression has been detected in multiple human tissues, including liver, fat tissue, skeletal 
muscles and bone tissues, such as the growth plates. The GHR is a member of the class I cytokine receptor 
family and consists of an extracellular cytokine binding domain, a single-pass transmembrane domain and a 
cytoplasmic domain with binding sites for non-receptor tyrosine kinases. GHR signal transduction is mainly 
handled by Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and mediated by signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1, 
3, and 5, which promote cellular growth and proliferation. 
In addition to activation of membrane-bound growth hormone receptor, active growth hormone/ receptor 
complexes have been demonstrated to be internalized to the cell nucleus or mitochondria of rat hepatocytes 
and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Although the exact function of these internalized receptors remains to be 
elucidated, they seem to be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and metabolism. 
Growth hormone is an anabolic hormone. It induces anabolic effects on the metabolism of proteins, lipids, 
and carbohydrates. Apart from this, growth hormone – among others - modulates cardiovascular function, 
and cognition. These effects are mediated both directly by growth hormone and indirectly by IGF-I. Growth 
hormone induces the production of IGF-I in the liver and peripheral tissues such as long bone growth plates 
and skeletal muscles. The liver is the primary source of circulating IGF-I, which regulates endogenous growth 
hormone production via a negative feedback loop, while locally produced IGF-I acts in an autocrine and 
paracrine fashion.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology

Growth hormone is a key regulator of postnatal longitudinal growth, affecting the epiphyseal plate of long 
bones directly and indirectly via IGF-I. In the resting zone (also called the reserve zone), mesenchymal stem 
cells are recruited and serve as a cellular reserve and matrix secretory cells. Stimulated by growth hormone, 
these cells differentiate and give rise to clonal lineages of chondrocytes. The further propagation of these 
chondrocytes in the proliferative zone is stimulated by growth hormone, both directly and indirectly, via IGF-
I. Stimulated by IGF-I, the chondrocytes then differentiate and expand to form hypertrophic chondrocytes. 
Finally, the hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo either apoptosis or differentiation to an osteoblast-like 
phenotype and eventually give way to growing vasculature and further osteoblasts in the ossification zone. 
The enhanced activity of osteoblasts is mediated by direct effects of GH as well as indirectly via IGF-I. 
The relative importance of local versus systemic IGF-I production in mediating bone growth remains a matter 
of some scientific debate, but the body of evidence points towards local IGF-I concentration being the 
determining factor. Govoni (2007) studied the effects of specific IGF-I knockout in chondrocytes of mice. In 
this model, IGF-I concentration in cartilage was reduced by 40%, while circulating levels of IGF-I were 
unaltered. During the prepubertal growth from 4 to 12 weeks of age, body elongation was concurrently 
reduced by 27% compared to wild-type littermates. Likewise, the effects of reduced circulating IGF-I levels 
on longitudinal growth have been studied in detail. Yakar et al. (1999) found that 75% reduction of 
circulating IGF-I levels by specific knockdown of hepatic IGF-I did not significantly affect longitudinal growth. 
Taken together, these studies indicate that while circulating levels of IGF-I are needed for maintaining a 
basal level of anabolic effects and for regulating growth hormone secretion, local concentrations of IGF-I may 
be of proportionally greater importance for longitudinal growth. 
Secondary pharmacology 
The growth hormone/IGF-I axis has profound effects on the metabolism of lipids, proteins, and 
carbohydrates. Growth hormone directly increases lipolysis in adipose tissue and inhibits the uptake of free 
fatty acids (FFAs) into adipocytes. FFAs are converted into triglycerides in the liver and released into the 
bloodstream as lipoproteins. Furthermore, growth hormone reduces overall protein oxidation and increases 
protein synthesis in skeletal muscles, leading to increased muscle mass. 
Growth hormone effects on carbohydrate metabolism are highly dependent on the systemic concentrations of 
growth hormone. Insulin resistance is thus observed both in adults suffering from excess production of 
growth hormone (acromegaly) and in those with growth hormone deficiency. Low doses (≤0.1 mg/day fixed-
dose) of human growth hormone in patients with growth hormone deficiency can improve insulin sensitivity 
by increasing IGF-I secretion without increasing lipolysis or hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. 
Conversely, at supraphysiological doses (>0.6 mg hGH/day fixed-dose) hepatic glycogenesis is stimulated 
directly by growth hormone and decreased insulin sensitivity. 
In addition to its effects on growth and metabolism, growth hormone also exerts effects on the central 
nervous system, and human growth hormone replacement therapy has been shown to influence cognitive 
function, appetite, and sleep positively. Growth hormone enters the central nervous system from the 
systemic circulation and can thus be measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after systemic administration. The 
manner of how growth hormone enters the CSF and brain has yet to be elucidated. The presence of growth 
hormone receptors in the choroid plexus has led numerous authors to suggest that growth hormone may 
pass into the central nervous system via a receptor-mediated mechanism. However, these receptors' exact 
location and function remain to be fully explored, and to date, no direct evidence for receptor-mediated 
uptake of growth hormone into the central nervous system has been found. This is in contrast to the 
demonstrated receptor-mediated uptake of other hormones such as IGF-I and hepatocyte growth factor. 
Furthermore, growth hormone passed from the systemic circulation into the brain mesenchyme of mice 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 51/142 
 
 
 
through a non-saturable process. This indicates that the majority of growth hormone entering the central 
nervous system from the circulation does so by passive diffusion through the blood-brain barrier. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect  
IGF-I Response to treatment in paediatric GHD patients was initially assessed in study CT-004 that employed 
ACP-001. IGF-I was assessed at doses of 0.14 (N=12), 0.21 (N=14) and 0.30 mg hGH/kg/week (N=14) in 
pre-pubertal pediatric GHD subjects versus the active comparator somatropin administered once daily at 0.03 
mg hGH/kg/day (equivalent to 0.21 mg hGH/kg/week, n=13). Figure 9 illustrates the profiles of IGF-I and 
shows that ACP-001 produced elevated levels of IGF-I throughout the study. 
Figure 9. IGF-I serum concentration arithmetic means (+SD) over time following once-weekly 
administration of ACP-001 (Study CT-004) 
Figure 10 illustrates the relationship between the ACP-001 dose used in CT-004 and the average IGF-I SDS 
response. Both figures show that higher doses of ACP-001 were associated with greater IGF-I increases.

Figure 10. Average IGF-I SDS versus lonapegsomatropin dose at week 13 following once weekly 
administration of ACP-001 (Study CT-004) 
Figure 10 also shows the linear regression line of average IGF-I SDS at week 13 over lonapegsomatropin 
dose overlaid by observed average IGF-I SDS data and LS means of average IGF-I SDS at week 13. The LS 
means of average IGF-I SDS coincide well on the regression line, demonstrating a dose proportionality for 
lonapegsomatropin. The estimated regression coefficient of lonapegsomatropin dose is 8.45, which means on 
average a 0.1 mg/kg/week dose increase/decrease in lonapegsomatropin will result in an increase/decrease 
of 0.845 SDS in average IGF-I level. The results of change from baseline in IGF-I SDS are similar  
The observed prolonged hGH exposure in systemic circulation resulted in an IGF-I response supporting once-
weekly dose administration.  
The observed Cmax range of hGH released from lonapegsomatropin was generally overlapping with somatropin 
hGH concentration data obtained at the assumed Tmax of daily hGH.  
Lonapegsomatropin and hGH did not accumulate in the systemic circulation following once-weekly dose 
administration for 52 weeks. Systemic mPEG steady-state was reached at or before week 26.  
Within the popPK/PD analysis MODHGH002 it was identified that weight and gender were covariates on the 
hGH/IGF-I response. The apparent effect of gender was primarily associated with the adult population and 
not with the pediatric subjects.  
As IGF-I levels are known to be sex- and age-dependent, the IGF-I SDS was used to investigate whether 
there was clinical relevance for these covariates. Predictions of IGF-I SDS were made for males and females 
across a range of body weights. Predicted IGF-I SDS response differences between males and females and 
between lower (13kg) and higher (50 kg) body weight subjects were small and unlikely to be clinically 
relevant or require dose adjustment. In addition, monitoring of IGF-I would allow for increasing or decreasing 
the lonapegsomatropin dose in response to IGF-I levels.  
The Population PKPD model has been expanded to include data from CT-301EXT and CT-302, thereby 
encompassing paediatric subjects with BW >50 kg and their corresponding relevant ages. The new simulation 
in children with BW > 50 kg shows that, even less relevant than in the previous simulation, the spread of 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 53/142 
 
 
 
 
 
IGF1-SDS responses still increased 1 unit (between 1.5 and 2 for BW of 60 kg and around 2 for BW of 70 kg). 
Concerns were raised related to the tendency that for children >50 kg, the proposed dosing regimen would 
generate IGF-I SDS levels above the upper target limit of +2 SDS. Upon this, the SmPC was adjusted to 
clarify the appropriate starting dose based on the patient’s weight. 
For a dose reduction of 0.02 mg growth hormone/kg, a reduction in IGF-I of 0.21 SDS occurred. This analysis 
included treatment-naïve and treatment- experienced children with GHD with a wide range of ages and 
pubertal stages. When evaluated by Tanner Stage, the consistency was maintained: for a dose reduction of 
0.02 mg growth hormone/kg, a reduction in IGF-I of 0.25 SDS and 0.19 SDS was observed for Tanner Stages 
1-2 and 3-5, respectively. 
Somatropin starting doses with lonapegsomatropin  
The recommended starting dose in growth hormone treatment naïve GHD patients is 0.24 mg somatropin/kg 
body weight, given once weekly. This dosage was chosen based on the results of study CT-004. 
For paediatric GHD patients switching from daily somatropin medicinal products at a total weekly dosage of 
0.24 mg/kg/week or higher, the recommended somatropin starting dosage with lonapegsomatropin is 0.24 
mg somatropin/kg/week. In those who received somatropin doses at a total weekly dosage, somatropin 
dosage with lonapegsomatropin is lowered to the equivalent of the weekly dose of daily somatropin. 
The aforementioned starting dosages are recommended irrespective of age, gender, and Tanner stage.  
Lonapegsomatropin dosing may need to be adjusted during treatment. After lonapegsomatropin dose 
adjustment, the average IGF-I SDS level can be appropriately determined 4-5 days after the second 
lonapegsomatropin dose i.e. during stable dosing. 
Monitoring of IGF-I SDS levels  
Somatropin dosages with lonapegsomatropin are titrated based on IGF-I SDS levels. An individualized 
approach is mandatory in this respect due to interindividual differences in the sensitivity to somatropin. 
The IGF-I SDS levels 4-5 days after stable dosing provide an indication of the average IGF-I SDS levels 
during the interval of one week in between subsequent lonapegsomatropin doses. The peak IGF-I SDS levels 
are about 1 SDS higher than the average IGF-I SDS level. The trough IGF-I SDS levels are about 1 SDS 
lower than the average IGF-I SDS level. For this reason, determination of the average IGF-I SDS level 4-5 
days after stable dosing also indicates the variability in IGF-I SDS levels during the interval of one week in 
between subsequent lonapegsomatropin doses. Because of this, there is no need to determine peak and 
trough IGF-I SDS levels for lonapegsomatropin. 
For lonapegsomatropin treatment in children with GHD, evaluation of efficacy and safety is recommended at 
approximately 6 to 12-month intervals based on auxological parameters, biochemistry (IGF-I, hormone, 
glucose, and lipid levels), and pubertal status. In paediatric GHD patients who undergo pubertal transition 
and in advanced pubertal stages, more frequent monitoring of IGF-I may be considered based on analyses 
that showed a higher likelihood of IGF-I >2 SDS among Tanner Stages III-V. 
Somatropin dose adjustments based on IGF-I SDS levels  
IGF-I SDS levels are used as guidance for somatropin dosing with lonapegsomatropin. This dosing is targeted 
to achieve IGF-I SDS levels within the range between -2 and +2 (preferably close to 0 SDS). The somatropin 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 54/142 
 
 
 
dosing with lonapegsomatropin is adjusted in case of IGF-I SDS levels outside the normal range. Since the 
growth response is higher in case of IGF-I SDS levels within the range between 0 and +2 as compared to the 
range -2 up to 0,4 it may be decided on an individual base to target IGF-I SDS levels within the upper normal 
range. 
Based on analyses of the somatropin dose with lonapegsomatropin and IGF-I SDS levels, changing to the 
next higher or lower somatropin dose strength with lonapegsomatropin increases or decreases IGF-I levels on 
average by 0.3 SDS. Based on this, recommendations with respect to somatropin dosing with 
lonapegsomatropin based on IGF-I SDS levels have been developed and included in the SmPC.  
The dosage adjustments are recommended for paediatric GHD patients irrespective of any prior growth 
hormone treatment, age, gender, and Tanner stage.  
IGF-I SDS levels in clinical studies 
Study CT-301 
IGF-I SDS levels were within the IGF-I SDS range of -2 up to +2 for ≥50% of the time in 104/105 (99.0%) of 
lonapegsomatropin-treated study patients and 53/56 (94.6%) of somatropin-treated study patients in pivotal 
study CT-301.  
IGF-I SDS levels >+2 were observed in 7.6% of lonapegsomatropin-treated study patients and 3.6% of 
somatropin-treated study patients (Table 13).

In the lonapegsomatropin treatment arm, the proportions of study patients with IGF-I SDS levels >+2 tended 
to increase with time (week 13: 0%, week 26: 1.9%, week 39: 2.9%, week 52: 7.7%). Such a trend was not 
observed for the proportions of somatropin-treated study patients with IGF-I SDS levels >+2 (week 13: 
3.6%, week 26: 1.8%, week 39: 1.8%, week 52: 1.9%).

At each time point, the majority of study patients had IGF-I SDS levels in between -2 and +2 at baseline 
(78.1%), week 13 (61.8%), and week 26 (60.6%).  
In the majority of study patients (56.8%) serum IGF-I SDS levels >+2 were observed at any point during the 
study, including baseline. In 25.3% of study patients, IGF-I SDS levels >+3 were observed. The proportions 
of study patients with IGF-I SDS levels >+2 (baseline: 21.9%, week 13: 38.2%, week 26: 38.7%) and >+3 
(baseline: 3.4%, week 13: 11.8%, week 26: 15.5%) increased during follow-up.  
IGF-I SDS levels above +2 were observed in all GHD study patients under 3 years of age. 
Study CT-301 EXT 
In CT-301, average IGF-I SDS > +2 was observed in 7.7% of the lonapegsomatropin group versus 1.9% of 
the daily somatropin group at week 52 (at any time during study CT-301: 7.6% versus 3.6%). As stated 
above, no average IGF-I SDS >+3 were observed during CT-301 in either treatment group.  
At week 104, the proportions of patients who had IGF-I SDS levels >+2 were 19.0% and 22.6% for study 
patients who had been treated with respectively lonapegsomatropin and somatropin in study CT-301 (data 
lock-off June 2020). For paediatric GHD patients enrolled into study CT-302, the proportions of study patients 
with IGF-I SDS >+2 and >+3 at each visit was approximately 30% and 15%, respectively, through week 91 
(data lock-off June 2020). 
Among study patients who were included in study CT-301 followed by study CT-301 EXT, the proportions of 
study patients with IGF-I SDS levels above the normal range increased over time, especially after 52 weeks 
of treatment. However, among study patients who were included in study CT-302 followed by study CT-
301EXT the proportions of study patients in whom IGF-I SDS levels above the normal range were observed 
remained stable in study CT-301EXT as compared to study CT-302. 
The patient characteristics of study patients who did or did not experience IGF-I SDS levels above +2 in 
conducted Phase 3 studies on lonapegsomatropin were studied. Differences in Tanner stage were observed in 
these subgroups. Age (in years; odds ratio 1.20; p< 0.0001), weight (in kg; odds ratio 1.07; p< 0.0001), 
and more advanced Tanner stage (i.e. stage III, IV, and V)(odds ratios respectively 7.41, 11.55, and 12.55; 
all p< 0.0001) were significantly associated with IGF-I SDS levels >+2 in a logistic regression analysis. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology  
Bioanalysis  
Further clarification was requested on the bioanalytical method for hGH, lonapegsomatropin and mPEG. For 
the hGH ELISA used in Studies CT-101, CT301 and CT302, in a late amendment of the validation report 
CA16502-01, 0.29 % cross-reactivity with lonapegsomatropin was identified. The specificity of the ELISA for 
hGH in the presence of lonapegsomatropin should however be further clarified. As lonapegsomatropin levels 
are typically approximately 100-fold higher than hGH, the 0.29 % cross-reactivity translates to an 
approximate 18 % lower Cmax and 26% lower AUC0-t for hGH than actually measured in the assay.  
The bioanalytical method for hGH, lonapegsomatropin and mPEG and the results of the ELISA specificity were 
discussed for hGH in presence of lonapegsomatropin. The cross-reactivity was sufficiently clarified and 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 56/142 
 
 
 
 
 
characterized. hGH serum concentration data was corrected for cross-reactivity only in study CT-301 and 
hGH data provided both as measured and with the correction. This was due to the fact that the reference 
standard used in analysis of the samples from that study contained 0.4% free hGH. In other trials only the 
measured values were reported. 
With respect to the anti-mPEG immunogenicity assay, mPEG tolerance was 2500 ng/ml, whereas actual 
mPEG concentration at time of sampling were >7000 ng/ml. Additional data on drug-tolerance of the anti-
mPEG immunogenicity assay was provided, using a human positive control instead of a rabbit anti-mPEG 
monoclonal antibody positive control used during validation. Drug tolerance against the human mPEG was 
estimated to be 15000 ng/ml, which is higher than the 2500 ng/ml tolerance obtained using the rabbit 
positive control. It is agreed that the data obtained using the human positive control are deemed more 
clinically meaningful. Further relief of potential concerns on undetected anti-mPEG antibodies comes from the 
fact that the lonapegsomatropin, hGH and IGF-I concentration-time curves do not indicate (potentially 
unnoticed) antibodies affecting PK or PD. 
The PK of the leaving group is considered sufficiently characterised in children with GHD, and it has been 
demonstrated that the leaving group is rapidly removed from the system.  
Qualification of PK and PK/PD models 
During SC administration of the product, relatively high levels of mPEG are expected in the patients' serum. 
An important potential safety issue that has been raised for other pegylated product is the chance of 
vacuolisation in the choroid plexus. In order to estimate the mPEG levels in the choroid plexus of paediatric 
patients with GHD, a popPK model was developed, aiming to extrapolate the choroid plexus data in rats to 
those in the choroid plexus PK in cynomolgus monkey and human, thereby allowing a link between the 
preclinical safety data and the expected choroid plexus exposure in human. For this purpose, in part 1 of the 
popPK study, mPEG serum PK in rat and human were described with a one-compartmental model with first-
order absorption from the administration depot. In cynomolgus monkey, a dose-dependency was added.  
In part 2 of this popPK study, in order to predict the mPEG concentrations in the choroid plexus of 
cynomolgus monkey and human, the PEG40(N9-GP) rat choroid plexus half-life of 49 days determined by 
whole-body autoradiography was scaled to cynomolgus monkey and human. This was considered possible 
since the mPEG serum PK data that were obtained in rat, cynomolgus monkey and human obeyed the 
expected scaling factors to a reasonable extent. For this exercise, it was assumed that 1) the half-life in the 
different species scale allometrically with body weight with a scaling coefficient of βT1/2,BWT = 0.25, 2) the 
volume of distribution of mPEG in the choroid plexus was equal to the physiological volume of the choroid 
plexus of the respective species, and 3) the biodistribution coefficient K, that is the ratio between plasma and 
choroid plexus mPEG concentration at steady-state, is the same as for PEG40(N9-GP) and the same between 
the species. The Applicant provided an extensive discussion on the assumptions made in PopPK model.  
It is acknowledged that a serious effort was made to predict the mPEG exposure in human choroid plexus. 
Assuming that the underlying assumptions on the biodistribution coefficient, the scalability of the PEG40(N9-
GP) and the vacuolisation process in different species are true, the model indicated that steady state mPEG 
levels are reached in the human choroid plexus which are much lower than those predicted to result in 
vacuolisation in preclinical studies.  
However, the assumptions are considered highly theoretical and cannot be verified without generating 
additional data of mPEG in choroid plexus in different species. Further optimisation of the model without such 
additional data is not expected to yield a more trustworthy predicted mPEG exposure in the choroid plexus. 
Assessment report

Without verification of the assumptions, the predicted human mPEG concentrations in choroid plexus by the 
current model should be interpreted with great caution. 
Still, it is important to highlight that the assumption that transport of mPEG to the choroid plexus is driven by 
non-specific mechanisms is now considered plausible. Therefore, the assumption that the biodistribution 
coefficient in principle can be extrapolated from one to another species is now considered more likely to be 
true and accepted. This is assumed to apply in the provided popPK model intended for bridging of the 
preclinical safety data to the human situation.  
It is concluded that the model-predicted human mPEG concentrations, reaching steady state in the choroid 
plexus, should be interpreted with great caution. However, one reason for possible differences in mPEG 
distribution between serum and choroid plexus between different species, i.e. active transport of mPEG, when 
linked to lonapegsomatropin, by species specific transporters, via e.g. the growth hormone receptor, is now 
considered to be unlikely, since the somatropin part of lonapegsomatropin is shielded from this growth 
hormone receptor by mPEG. Therefore, from a theoretical point of view, it can be considered that the 
mechanism for transport of mPEG to the choroid plexus in different species proceeds via comparable non-
specific mechanisms. 
Since further optimisation of the model without additional mPEG choroid plexus data is not expected to yield 
more trustworthy predictions, this issue is not further pursued. 
Absorption 
Lonapegsomatropin is to be injected SC to the abdomen, buttock or thigh. In Study CT-301, the vast 
majority of patients rotated the injection sites as indicated in the proposed SmPC. Overall exposure to 
lonapegsomatropin, hGH, and IGF-I were broadly similar between administration sites, with no systematic 
differences observed. Based on this outcome, it is not expected that efficacy or safety would be sensitive to 
the administration site. 
Distribution 
In paediatric GHD patients, the absolute bioavailability following subcutaneous dose administration of 
lonapegsomatropin has not been investigated, which is indicated in the SmPC section 5.2. Further, the 
lonapegsomatropin NCA-based volume of distribution in children is reported in the same section.  
Special populations 
A theoretical discussion was provided on the potential effect of renal impairment, assuming mPEG was 
completely renally cleared. In a worst-case scenario, in case of severe renal impairment, a 4-fold increase in 
mPEG exposure to approximately 60 µg/ml may result. Additional data were provided, providing nuance to 
this previously sketched worst-case scenario, indicating that effects of renal impairment on mPEG 
concentration are expectedly lower, amounting up to a 2-fold increase. Provided data are considered 
sufficiently reassuring to omit a suggestion for alternate non-PEG containing products in case of renal 
impairment.  
Based on popPK analysis and visual inspection of the data, race and ethnicity (White, Black/African American, 
Asian, Hispanic) do not appear to be a significant covariate on hGH exposure. Information on the number of 
male/female subjects and the number of subjects per origin included in the clinical studies is adequately 
provided in section 5.2 of the SmPC.  
Lonapegsomatropin and hGH clearance increases with increasing body weight. The dose advice for children 
>50 kg was carefully assessed. It was agreed that dose titration should be based on average IGF-I SDS 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 58/142 
 
 
 
levels and it is recommended to ensure that levels remain within the normal range between -2 and +2 SDS, 
preferably close to 0. Changing to the next higher or lower lonapegsomatropin dose strength increases or 
decreases IGF-I on average by 0.3 SDS and this relationship held true for both treatment-naïve and 
treatment-experienced patients; hence, one set of dose adjustment recommendations is provided for all 
patients. 
In the popPK Study MODHGH002, age was not considered to have any additional impact on hGH exposure 
down to 3.2 years of age, being the youngest patient included in Study CT-301. hGH and mPEG PK data in 
patients <3.2 years of age appear limited. Treatment of patients at this young age is considered unlikely. 
Since the indication was restricted to paediatric GHD patients aged 3 years and above, this issue was not 
further pursued. 
Interactions 
With regard to potential DDI’s for lonapegsomatropin as a perpetrator, an extensive literature-based 
discussion on the potential for GH-related DDIs was provided. It is agreed that the information shows some 
inconsistency but that most reported changes in activity appear to concern CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 mediated 
interactions. Considering the limited data and the inconsistencies in the data, it is agreed that the clinical 
significance of the potential interactions is considered to be unknown and is adequately expressed in the 
SmPC.  
PK/PD analysis based on IGF-I SDS levels 
The actual lonapegsomatropin-IGF-I exposure-response analysis was not provided; however, the relationship 
between lonapegsomatropin dose and IGF-I response was discussed. In Study CT-004 at an ACP-001 dose of 
0.14, 0.21 or 0.30 mg hGH/kg/week in paediatric GHD subjects, IGF-I SDS at steady-state increases dose 
proportionality to ACP-001.  
In the PK/PD subset of Study CT-301, applying a 0.24 mg/kg/week lonapegsomatropin dose, IGF-I levels 
reached steady-state at or before Week 13. There was an approximate +1 increase in IGF-I SDS observed 
from baseline to Week 13 pre-dose. PopPK/PD predicted IGF-I SDS response differences between males and 
females and between lower (13 kg) and higher (50 kg) bodyweight subjects were small and unlikely to be 
clinically relevant.  
According to the model MODHGH003 IGF-I reaches a steady-state after 13 weeks of treatment with an IGF-I 
concentration around 0 SDS for the lonapegsomatropin and about -0.5 for daily growth hormone. For both 
treatments, IGF-I remained within de -2 and +2 SDS for the majority of the patients. Eight (8) patients 
treated with lonapegsomatropin reported IGF-I above 2 SDS for more than 50% of the time. 
A similar pattern was observed in the conducted clinical studies CT-301, CT-302, and CT-301 EXT.  
Based on the unknown exposition of growth hormone and IGF-I, there are concerns about the possible 
carcinogenetic effect of such an exposition. Further, there might be an increase in the development of 
diabetes mellitus type 2.  
Considering these potential safety risks, lonapegsomatropin dosing should be adapted to avoid 
supratherapeutic IGF-I SDS levels in (subgroups of) paediatric GHD patients as much as possible. The 
proportions of lonapegsomatropin-treated GHD study patients in whom IGF-I SDS levels above +2 were 
observed at any point upon lonapegsomatropin treatment were 7.6% in study CT-301, 48.6% in study CT-
301EXT, and 56.8% in study CT-302. The higher proportions in studies CT-302 and CT-301EXT as compared 
to study CT-301 are probably partially related to the less strict monitoring of IGF-I SDS levels in studies CT-
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 59/142 
 
 
 
302 and CT-301EXT as compared to study CT-301. Hence, regular monitoring of IGF-I SDS levels is 
mandatory.  
The fact that the proportion of study patients with IGF-I levels above +2 was highest among study patients in 
study CT-302 indicates that other factors apart from deliberate IGF-I SDS monitoring may explain the 
relatively high proportion of paediatric GHD patients with IGF-I SDS levels above +2. Respective factors 
include demographic factors. In line with this, advanced Tanner stages (3, 4, and 5) were associated with 
IGF-I SDS levels above +2 in logistic regression analyses.  
Practical guidance for somatropin starting doses, IGF-I SDS monitoring, and somatropin dose adjustments 
with lonapegsomatropin were upon request provided and reflected in the SmPC. The applicant indicated later 
that evaluation of efficacy and safety should be considered at approximately 6 to 12-month intervals and 
may be assessed by evaluating auxological parameters, biochemistry (IGF-I, hormones, glucose, and lipid 
levels), and pubertal status.  
The follow-up of conducted clinical studies is too short for the evaluation of long-term safety risks of 
lonapegsomatropin treatment. The applicant committed to conducting a PASS to evaluate the long-term 
clinical safety, including the risk of malignancies and/or diabetes mellitus type 2. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology  
Human growth hormone released from lonapegsomatropin maintains the same mode of action, including 
receptor-binding affinity, as human growth hormone administered on a daily basis.  
Overall, the CHMP agreed that the PK of lonapegsomatropin has been investigated to a satisfactory extent.  
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study  
Introduction 
Study CT-004 is a Phase 2, randomized, open-label active-controlled study in which the clinical effects of 
three different dose levels of weekly ACP-001, a predecessor of lonapegsomatropin, were compared with 
those of daily somatropin treatment over a study period of 26 weeks.  
Selection of study population 
55 Male and female pre-pubertal growth hormone treatment naïve children with GHD in Tanner stage I 
(boys: 3-12 years, girls: 3-11 years) were included.  
The diagnosis of GHD was based on the criteria laid down in the consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and 
treatment of GH deficiency in childhood and adolescence, issued by the Growth Hormone Research Society 
(GH Research Society, 2000).  
Impaired height was defined as the height of at least 2 standard deviations below the mean height for 
chronological age and sex according to CDC standards (2000). Impaired height velocity was defined as a 
mean height velocity which was at least 1 standard deviation below the mean height velocity for 
chronological age and sex according to the standards of Prader et al., (1989), whereas the time between 2 
height measurements is not less than 6 months.  
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 60/142 
 
 
 
Baseline IGF-I levels of GHD patients were at least 1 standard deviation below the mean IGF-I level 
standardized for age and sex (IGF-I Standard Deviation Score [SDS] ≤ -1.0) according to the central 
laboratory reference values.  
The Body Mass Index (BMI) of GHD patients had to be within ±2 standard deviations of the mean BMI for 
chronological age and sex according to the 2000 CDC standards (Kuczmarski et al., 2002). 
Randomization 
55 Included study patients were centrally randomized to one of four cohorts: one of three weekly ACP-001 
dose groups (0.14, 0.21, and 0.30 mg/kg/week) or a daily somatropin control dose group (0.03 mg/kg/day, 
i.e. 0.21 mg/kg/week) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.  
Prior to randomization, subjects were stratified using the minimization rule according to their age (˃ 3 to ≤ 6 
years and ˃ 6 years), peak GH levels in stimulation tests (≤ 5 ng/mL and ˃5 ng/mL) and gender. The 
minimization dynamic randomization method was used. 
Study treatment 
Both the investigational product (ACP-001) and the somatropin reference product (Genotropin) were 
administered subcutaneously by the study staff or by the parent or legal guardian.  
ACP-001 was administered in the morning hours, and somatropin was administered in the evening hours (at 
bedtime). The dose calculation was initially calculated based on the subject’s body weight prior to dosing at 
visit 1 and was subsequently adjusted according to the subject’s body weight at visit 3, prior to dosing and 
PK/PD sampling.  
Endpoints 
The following efficacy endpoints and criteria were taken for evaluation: 
- 
-  
-  
-  
Annualized height velocity (cm/year)  
Delta height SDS  
Change in serum IGF-I levels (ng/ml) and IGF-I SDS  
IGF-I SDS and number and percentage of subjects achieving normalization of serum IGF-I levels  
Treatment compliance 
Treatment compliance was evaluated at each study visit during the treatment period, based on the patient 
diary and completion and review of the dosing log and drug accountability records.  
Safety endpoints 
Safety endpoints included among other endpoints, the incidence of adverse events, local tolerability, 
immunogenicity, and IGF-I levels. The safety endpoints are described in more detail in the safety section of 
this assessment report. 
Statistical and analytical plan 
As this was an exploratory study, with safety as the primary endpoint, no hypothesis tests were performed to 
assess the efficacy of the investigational product. Efficacy analysis was performed (and tabulated) on both 
the FAS and the PP analysis set. 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 61/142 
 
 
 
ANCOVA tables were generated for different endpoints, including annualized height velocity and the change in 
the height standard deviation scores, estimating least-square means (and 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of 
the endpoint based on Week 13 and 27 data for each cohort, accounting for the cohort effect, gender, 
baseline value of the variable, age (in years) and peak GH level category. 
Other descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, min, max) were calculated for the cohorts by visit and 
time point for the other efficacy endpoints (summarized, by gender and by age group).  
Disposition of study patients 
In total, 170 patients with growth hormone deficiency were screened for inclusion at 38 centres (Figure 11). 
55 Study patients were randomized. 
One hundred and fifteen (115) patients were considered as screen failures. The most common reasons for 
discontinuation of the screening phase (~68%) were failure to comply with at least inclusion criteria numbers 
2 (IGF-I SDS > -1 SD) or 6 (GH stimulation test peak(s) > 10 ng/mL).  
Two study patients discontinued the study after screening, but prior to the administration of study treatment. 
The reason for discontinuation for both study patients was withdrawal of consent by the subject or 
parent(s)/legal guardian(s). These 2 study patients were not included in SAS, FAS or PP analysis set.

The demographics and baseline data of included patients are presented in Table 14. Mean age in cohorts 1 up 
4 was 8.0, 8.2, 7.3, and 7.5 years respectively. The majority of study patients (i.e. > 64%) was older than 6 
years of age. Most included study patients were men (≥ 64%). Mean IGF-I SDS levels were below -2.00 in all 
cohorts. Average height velocity was 3.36, 3.13, 3.52, and 3.86 cm/year in respectively cohort 1, 2, 3, and 
4. In about half of the study population, the mean peak growth hormone concentration was > 5 ng/ml. 
In the SAS, FAS and PP populations, a total of 7 study patients (13.2%) had thyroid axis deficiency of 
pituitary origin (i.e. 2, 0, 4 and 1 subject in Cohorts 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively). None of the other types of 
pituitary axis deficiencies screened for (i.e. ADH insufficiency, adrenal axis deficiency and gonadal axis 
deficiency of pituitary origin) were documented among the study patients.

Growth evaluation 
Across ACP-001 dose groups, a dose-dependent response at week 27 was observed for the annualized height 
velocity (12.0 to 13.58 cm/year) and change from baseline in height SDS (0.69 to 0.84). Importantly, the 
annualized height velocity was numerically higher for ACP-001 0.21 mg human growth hormone/kg/week 
compared with somatropin 0.21 mg human growth hormone /kg/week, 13.46 cm/year vs 11.67 cm/year,

respectively. The difference in LS mean concerning this parameter for these treatments was, however, not 
statistically significant.  
At week 27, the result for change from baseline in height SDS similarly demonstrated numerically higher 
values for equivalent weekly doses of ACP-001 compared to somatropin (0.79 vs 0.61, respectively). The 
difference in LS mean concerning this parameter for these treatments was, however, not statistically 
significant.

Study CT-301 (heiGHt study) 
Study CT-301 was a randomized, open-label Phase 3 clinical study evaluating once-weekly 
lonapegsomatropin as compared to somatropin product Genotropin administered daily over a period of 
52 weeks. 
Paediatric patients with growth hormone deficiency in the age range 3-12 years were included. The study 
consisted of a screening period of up to 6 weeks (plus a recommended period of up to 2 weeks between 
randomization and visit 1).  
Study patients who successfully completed the study were eligible to participate in extension study CT-
301EXT (see below).

Methods 
•  Study Participants  
Treatment-naïve, pre-pubertal paediatric GHD patients were included. The diagnosis of GHD was confirmed 
by 2 different growth hormone stimulation tests, defined as a peak GH level of ≤10 ng/mL, determined with 
a validated assay (GH Research Society, 2000). 
Additional criteria for enrolment were height SDS ≤‒2.0, IGF-I SDS ≤‒1.0, and delayed bone age (≥6 
months relative to chronological age). Subjects born small for gestational age, with idiopathic short stature, 
or with other causes of short stature were excluded. 
•  Treatments 
An identical total dose of 0.24 mg human growth hormone/kg/week was used for once-weekly 
lonapegsomatropin and daily somatropin product Genotropin. Both study treatments were administered via a 
vial and syringe/needle.  
Table 18 shows the dose volumes of lonapegsomatropin to be used for each weight range, both when only 
the 12.1 mg growth hormone/vial (11.0 mg/ml when reconstituted) was available early in the Phase 3 study, 
and the dose volumes that were used when both the 12.1 and 24.2 mg growth hormone/vials (11.0 and 22.0 
mg/ml when reconstituted, respectively) were available. All of these dose volumes provided an average dose 
of 0.24 ± 0.02 mg growth hormone/kg/week within each weight range.  
Table 18 
Drug concentration after reconstitution with 1 ml water for injection, dosing 
brackets, and volumes to be administered 
Somatropin product Genotropin was supplied as a lyophilized powder, dispensed in a 2-chamber cartridge. 
Genotropin was administered as a daily SC injection in a standard dose of 0.24 mg hGH/kg/week. The total 
weekly dose was equally split into 7 daily doses of 0.034 mg hGH/kg/day.  
Dose adjustment 
Treatment could be discontinued or dose-modified at any time during the trial. The following symptoms and 
laboratory abnormalities were considered to be the main guide for decision making concerning treatment 
discontinuation or dose modification: 
• IGF-I levels: For daily somatropin dosed in the evening, the morning IGF-I value on any visit day (including 
visit 6) represents the Eaverage, whereas for lonapegsomatropin, the values measured 48-72 h post-dose at 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 66/142 
 
 
 
 
visits 3 up to 5 represent at or close to Emax for IGF-I, whereas the IGF-I value at visit 6 (7-days post-dose) 
represents the Etrough. 
IGF-I >+2.0 SDS at any visit was to be confirmed by a second measurement as soon as possible if deemed 
to be clinically significant by the investigator. Follow-up blood samples were to be collected 5-7 days post-
dose in the lonapegsomatropin treatment arm, or at any day in the somatropin treatment arm. 
If the IGF-I SDS was still elevated above +2.0 and of clinical concern, the dose could be decreased to the 
next lower dose bracket for lonapegsomatropin or a 20% decrease in dose (initially to 0.19 mg/kg/week) for 
subjects on somatropin. Any re-establishment of the original dose (0.24 mg/kg/week) due to a subsequent 
sub-optimal IGF-I response needed to be discussed with the medical monitor. 
• Glucose parameters 
• HbA1c >6.2% 
• Fasting glucose level >5.5 mmol/l (100 mg/dl) 
• 2-h post-dose glucose level during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) ≥7.8 mmol/l 
For a subject who had evidence of borderline glucose intolerance or diabetes prior to starting growth 
hormone treatment (e.g., fasting plasma glucose (FPG) >98 mg/dL and/or HbA1c >5.9%), it might have 
been appropriate to treat for hyperglycaemia as needed, without initial trial drug treatment adjustment. 
However, if a subject with no evidence of glucose intolerance reached the above glucose parameter levels, 
the FPG and HbA1c were to be repeated within 2 to 4 weeks. If the repeat values were the same or worse, 
the lonapegsomatropin dose could be decreased to the next lower dose bracket (~20%) and the dose could 
be reduced by ~20% for a subject on somatropin (e.g., to 0.19 mg/kg/week or 0.027 mg/kg/day) or 
appropriate anti-glycaemic therapy(ies) could be started. If appropriate follow-up monitoring showed 
progressively worsening glucose intolerance, additional dose adjustments could be appropriate. If in any case 
treatment was to be discontinued, all subsequent visits and assessments were to continue as planned. 
If a subject developed any of the above listed criteria or developed a severe growth hormone-related adverse 
event at any time during the course of the study (e.g., peripheral oedema, severe headache, intracranial 
hypertension, or other adverse drug reaction and/or abnormal laboratory values), the investigator or medical 
monitor/sponsor (and independent safety committee if needed) could propose a dose modification. 
•  Objectives 
Primary objective 
The primary objective was to evaluate and compare the annualized height velocity (AHV) for once-weekly 
lonapegsomatropin compared to the commercially available daily human growth hormone formulation at 52 
weeks.  
Secondary objectives 
Secondary efficacy objectives were to evaluate and compare the annualized height velocity and change in 
height standard deviation score (SDS) of once-weekly lonapegsomatropin to daily human growth hormone 
over 52 weeks.  
An additional secondary objective was to evaluate IGF-I, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-
3), IGF-I SDS, and IGFBP-3 SDS, and the normalization of IGF-I SDS over 52 weeks of weekly 
lonapegsomatropin or daily somatropin therapy.

•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
• Annualized height velocity at 52 weeks for weekly lonapegsomatropin and daily somatropin treatment 
groups 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
• Annualized height velocity for the weekly lonapegsomatropin and the daily somatropin treatment groups 
over 52 weeks 
• Change in height SDS over 52 weeks for the weekly lonapegsomatropin and the daily hGH treatment 
groups 
• Serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels and IGF-I SDS and IGFBP-3 SDS; and the normalization of IGF-I SDS over 
52 weeks for the weekly lonapegsomatropin and the daily somatropin treatment groups 
•  Sample size 
Approximately 150 prepubertal, hGH-treatment naïve children (males and females) with growth hormone 
deficiency were included. Subjects were allocated to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio. Two thirds of the 
150 subjects (approximately 100 subjects) received lonapegsomatropin treatment to obtain an expected 90 
per protocol subjects in this cohort. One third of the 150 study patients (approximately 50 subjects) received 
somatropin treatment to obtain an expected 45 per protocol study patients in this cohort. 
In EMA scientific advice EMA/CHMP/SAWP/588843/2016 the CHMP indicated that a non-inferiority margin of 
1.8 cm/year had been accepted previously for a long-term growth hormone. The CHMP concluded that a non-
inferiority margin of 2.0 cm/year might be acceptable provided that the applicant would include an extensive 
justification for the chosen non-inferiority margin and its clinical relevance. A similar conclusion was drawn in 
EMA scientific advice EMA/CHMP/SAWP/711581/2017. A substantiation about the appropriateness of the non-
inferiority margin is however no longer relevant, since the annualized height velocity at week 52 of 
lonapegsomatropin was superior to that of somatropin (see below). 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Randomisation 
The study patients included were centrally allocated to 1 of 2 cohorts: either lonapegsomatropin or 
somatropin, in a 2:1 ratio. Dynamic allocation was used, with a complete randomization probability of 15%.  
Study patients were stratified using the minimization rule according to their age (≤6 and ˃6 years), peak 
growth hormone levels in stimulation tests (≤5 ng/mL and ˃5 ng/mL), and gender. All strata were assigned 
equal weights.  
Blinding 
Due to different administration frequencies for the treatment arms (lonapegsomatropin administered once-
weekly versus somatropin administered daily), the study was conducted in an open-label manner with 
procedures in place to keep selected sponsor staff (including the clinical and biometrics teams) blinded to 
treatment assignment during the study, and before finalization of the statistical analysis plan (SAP, 
Amendment 5, dated 19Feb2019). Study auxologists were kept blinded to treatment allocation as far as 
possible at sites.

•  Statistical methods 
Analysis of primary endpoint  
The primary endpoint, annualized height velocity at week 52, was compared between lonapegsomatropin and 
daily somatropin by a non-inferiority comparison with a non-inferiority margin of 2.0 cm/year, followed by a 
test of superiority if non-inferiority was established.  
An ANCOVA model was used to analyse annualized height velocity at week 52, after multiple imputation of 
missing data. The annualized height velocity at week 52 was included in the model as a response variable. 
The model included baseline age, peak growth hormone levels (log-transformed) at stimulation test, baseline 
height SDS – average SDS of parental height as covariates and treatment and gender as factors.  
In case the result for the primary endpoint was missing, height values were imputed using a multiple 
imputation model that contained the following variables: gender, baseline age, peak growth hormone levels 
(log-transformed) at stimulation test, baseline height SDS – average SDS of parental height, and height 
values at post-baseline visits. The multiple imputation was stratified by treatment. The estimates from the 
100 fitted models for each of the 100 imputed datasets were combined to provide an overall estimate of the 
between treatment group difference with a corresponding confidence interval and a p-value. 
For the primary efficacy analysis, a 2-sided 95% confidence interval was calculated for the difference in least-
square means between the 2 treatment groups [lonapegsomatropin minus somatropin] at week 52. If the 
lower confidence bound was >-2.0 cm, non-inferiority was demonstrated in terms of effectiveness. If the 
lower confidence bound was >0, superiority was established.  
Average IGF-I values were derived for lonapegsomatropin based on population pharmacodynamic (PD) 
modelling. 
Treatment-by-covariate interactions were examined as appropriate as part of the analysis model 
examination. Height velocities at other post-baseline visits were analysed similarly using the same ANCOVA 
model as described above for the primary efficacy analysis. The same ANCOVA model described above was 
also used to analyse observed cases as a sensitivity analysis of the primary analysis.  
Populations analysed 
Given that the primary objective of the study was based on testing for non-inferiority, the primary efficacy 
analyses was performed on both (intention-to-treat) ITT and (per-protocol) PP populations. The primary 
analysis population was the ITT population. The ITT population was analysed on the basis of the intention to 
treat a subject, i.e. the planned treatment regimen. The PP subset was analysed on the basis of the actual 
treatment given. Because the PP population excludes subjects who have missing data at week 52, the 
multiple imputation method described above was not used for the PP analysis. 
Intention-To-Treat Population (ITT): The Intent-to-Treat population included all randomized subjects who 
have received at least one dose of active treatment. 
Per Protocol Population (PP): The basis of PP population is the ITT population who have relevant data 
evaluable for the primary efficacy endpoint of annualized height velocity at 52 weeks. Specifically, study 
patients were excluded from the PP population if they: had a diagnosis known to impact growth (exclusion 
criteria 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13); took the wrong treatment (e.g. randomized to TransCon hGH cohort but took 
Genotropin; in error); missed or overdosed on at least 5 doses of TransCon hGH, or 35 doses of Genotropin; 
used prohibited concomitant medications at study entry (exclusion criteria 15, 16); failed to have a height 
measurement at the week 52 visit.

Results 
•  Participant flow 
358 Persons were screened for eligibility for study participation. 196 Persons were excluded prior to 
randomization. The majority of these persons (184/196 (93.9%)) did not meet the randomization criteria.  
A total of 162 subjects were randomized 2:1 to lonapegsomatropin (N = 106) or somatropin (N = 56) (Figure 
12). Among randomized study patients, 161 (99.4%) were dosed with study treatment. 159 of 161 study 
patients (98.8%) completed the study. Two study patients withdrew from the study: one study patient from 
the lonapegsomatropin arm withdrew consent, and another study patient from the somatropin arm was lost 
to follow-up. The particular reasons for withdrawal of consent were not reported.

There were no changes in the planned analyses. The following ad-hoc analyses have been conducted: 
•  
By visit analysis of change from baseline in height SDS by ANCOVA models to account for by visit 
difference in covariate effect. 
•  
ANCOVA analysis of change from baseline in QTcF at Week 26 and QTcF summary by baseline QTcF 
subgroups to adjust for baseline difference in QTcF analysis. 
•  
•  
Subgroup analysis by US vs non-US to assess treatment effect by region. 
Logistic regression to analyse the ratio of subjects with annualized height velocity <8 cm/year at 
week 52 to evaluate subjects with a reduced treatment response in growth. 
•  
Summarize the change from baseline in average IGF-I SDS for subjects with annualized height 
velocity <8 cm/year and ≥8 cm/year to evaluate potential causes for a reduced treatment response in 
growth. 
•  
To assess treatment-emergent adverse events that are essentially the same but coded under 
different preferred terms, summary of treatment-emergent adverse events by combined term (aggregate 
preferred term groupings into combined terms based on clinical judgement) and preferred term was 
performed. 
•  
Anti-lonapegsomatropin antibodies were tested post database lock and summaries were provided. 
•  Baseline data 
Overall, the demographics and baseline data between the treatment groups were balanced (Table 19).  
Study patients between 3.2 and 13.1 years of age were enrolled in the study. The mean age in each 
treatment group was similar (8.5 years in the lonapegsomatropin group vs 8.5 years in the somatropin 
group), with a similar proportion of study patients <6 years in each treatment group (23.8% vs 25.0%, 
respectively). More male than female study patients were enrolled (82.0% versus 18.0%).  
At baseline, study patients had diminished growth with a mean height velocity of 3.93 cm/year and a mean 
height SDS of -2.93. The mean average-parental height SDS was −0.52 (0.78). At baseline, bone age was 
delayed by an average of 2.42 years relative to chronological age. The majority of study patients (65.2%) 
had isolated, idiopathic aetiology of growth hormone deficiency. Equal proportions of study patients had 
isolated, organic aetiology of growth hormone deficiency (17.4%) and multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies 
(17.4%). 
Medical history and prior medication 
Overall, the medical history and type and frequency of prior treatments were balanced across treatment 
groups.  
Concomitant treatments  
Overall, the type and frequency of concomitant treatments, including hormone replacement therapies for 
thyroid and adrenal deficiencies were balanced across treatment groups.

Overall, 161 subjects were randomized and received at least one dose of study treatment and were included 
in the safety and ITT populations. 159 of 161 randomized subjects (98.1%) had relevant data evaluable for 
the primary efficacy endpoint at 52 weeks and were included in the PP population. 
•  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint: annualized height velocity at week 52 
For observed cases, for lonapegsomatropin, the mean (SD) annualized height velocity at week 52 was 10.90 
(2.29) cm/year, and for somatropin, the mean (SD) annualized height velocity was 10.22 (2.37) cm/year 
(Figure 13). Consistent results were seen in the analyses of the per-protocol set.

daily somatropin treatment (observed cases ITT population) 
Source: Figure 14.4.2 
The LS mean (SE) of annualized height velocity at week 52 was 11.17 (0.23) cm/year for lonapegsomatropin 
compared with 10.31 (0.30) cm/year for somatropin, with a difference in LS means (SE) of 0.86 (0.33) 
cm/year (95% CI: 0.22 to 1.50) (Table 20). The treatment difference was statistically significant in favour of 
lonapegsomatropin (P = 0.0088).  
Since the lower confidence bound was above the non-inferiority margin of -2.0 cm/year, non-inferiority was 
demonstrated.

Note: Missing data were imputed with multiple imputation method with 100 simulated datasets. For each imputed data set, 
an ANCOVA model with by visit annualized height velocity as the dependent variable, treatment and gender as factors, 
baseline age, baseline peak growth hormone levels (log transformed) at stimulation test, and baseline height SDS - 
average parental height SDS as covariates were fitted. The LS means, CIs, and p-values presented in the table are the 
overall estimates combined from all the 100 models. 
The statistical superiority outcome in week 52 annualized height velocity in study CT-301 for 
lonapegsomatropin vs somatropin is supported by a larger annualized height velocity for lonapegsomatropin 
at all visits during the study, with differences from week 26 onwards. Similar results were obtained in 
sensitivity analyses with different analysis models and missing data handling methods. 
Although the superiority of lonapegsomatropin was demonstrated statistically, it was not demonstrated 
clinically. Indeed, the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (0.22, 1.50) is inferior to the +2 cm limit 
of non-inferiority. 
The reported annualized height velocities in Table correspond to a mean (SD) height velocity SDS of 5.87 
(2.76) for once-weekly lonapegsomatropin and 5.27 (3.01) for somatropin.  
CT-301 analysis model examination: ANCOVA model considering treatment and age interaction 
Treatment-by-covariate interactions were evaluated for the primary analysis model as part of the analysis 
model examination. The treatment-by-age interaction was statistically significant (Table 21). Therefore, the 
interaction term was added to the primary analysis model.

CT-301 average IGF-I SDS 
ANCOVA results of average IGF-I SDS by visit are presented in Table 24. As IGF-I levels follow a predictable 
profile over the course of a week with a peak at approximately post-dose day 2 and return to pre-dose 
steady-state levels at post-dose day 7, average model-derived IGF-I SDS values are presented for 
lonapegsomatropin. 
In both treatment arms, IGF-I SDS values increased relative to baseline following treatment initiation and 
increased over time at subsequent visits. Compared to the somatropin arm, the once-weekly 
lonapegsomatropin arm reached the clinically desirable range of IGF-I SDS 0-2 sooner and stayed within this 
range, with a higher average observed IGF-I SDS throughout the study, thus paralleling the observed 
superior growth outcomes.  
Average IGF-I SDS levels rarely exceeded 2.0 at any time (7.6% in the once-weekly lonapegsomatropin arm 
vs. 3.6% in the somatropin arm), and never exceeded 3.0 in either arm.

•  Ancillary analyses 
Results from subgroup analyses for annualized height velocity at week 52 are illustrated in Figure 14. In each 
subgroup analysis, the clinical effects of once-weekly lonapegsomatropin tended to be larger relative to daily 
somatropin.  
A subgroup analysis of the clinical effects with respect to the primary endpoint within countries in the 
European Union was not available.

2.6.5.3.  Clinical studies in special populations  
In submitted clinical studies, the clinical effects of lonapegsomatropin have been evaluated in paediatric 
patients with growth hormone deficiency. In this population, no particular analyses were conducted in study 
patients with concomitant renal or hepatic impairment.  
Comparator somatropin medicinal product Genotropin is indicated in paediatric GHD patients aged 4 years 
and above. Clinical effects of lonapegsomatropin have been evaluated in paediatric patients aged 6 months 
and above. In total, 4 study patients under 3 years of age were included in submitted Phase 3 studies on 
lonapegsomatropin for paediatric GHD. All respective patients were included in single-arm study CT-302 
(Table 26).

Long-term efficacy data will be obtained in paediatric GHD study patients treated with lonapegsomatropin as 
part of the secondary objectives of the requested PASS. 
2.6.5.4.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)  
An integrated analysis was conducted across studies CT-301, CT-302, and CT-301EXT. Study CT-302 is an 
open-label study in which the clinical effects of lonapegsomatropin were evaluated in paediatric GHD patients 
aged 6 months and above. Study CT-301EXT is a long-term extension of parent open-label studies CT-301 
and CT-302 wherein the study patients differ in duration of study drug exposure, treatment experiences, and 
other demographical characteristics. Supportive studies CT-302 and CT-301EXT are discussed below. 
Separate integration analyses for efficacy were conducted for growth hormone treatment-naïve and growth 
hormone treatment-experienced study patients.  
Efficacy across studies was evaluated in two pools: 
- 
Efficacy pool I: a longitudinal review of a treatment-naïve study population that received 
lonapegsomatropin or somatropin in study CT-301 and lonapegsomatropin in study CT-301EXT. Study 
patients in this pool were randomized and received at least one dose of study treatment in study CT-
301 (Figure 15). 
- 
Efficacy pool II: a pooled review of efficacy data in study CT-301EXT in study patients who had 
received treatment with somatropin product Genotropin in study CT-301, and study patients in study 
CT-302 who had received prior somatropin treatment (Figure 16).

Descriptive summary and model-based analyses were performed to examine efficacy outcomes for efficacy 
pool I and efficacy pool II using all available data.

Efficacy endpoints and methodology for longitudinal analyses  
In efficacy pool I, annualized height velocity by visit in the lonapegsomatropin and 
somatropin → lonapegsomatropin groups was analysed. In efficacy pool II, annualized height velocity by visit 
after the switch to lonapegsomatropin was analysed.  
In both efficacy pools, change from baseline in height SDS, the absolute value and change from baseline in 
average IGF-I, average IGF-I SDS, IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-3 SDS were analysed.  
A rolling baseline taking into account data from the prior 52 weeks was used in the aforementioned analyses. 
Subgroup analyses 
All descriptive efficacy analyses in efficacy pool I and II were repeated on the following subgroups: 
•  Age (<3 years, ≥3 to <6 years, [≥6 to <11 years for girls, ≥6 to <12 years for boys] and [≥11 years 
for girls, ≥12 years for boys]) 
•  Gender 
•  Study baseline growth hormone -stimulation strata (≤5 ng/mL and ˃5 ng/mL) 
•  United States (US) vs. Non-US 
•  2-year completers (subjects with 2-year efficacy data)

Data were collected and analysed from the beginning of this CT-301 extension study enrolment through the 
data cut-off date of 30 September 2019. 
Subject disposition and key baseline characteristics efficacy pool I 
Subject disposition for efficacy pool I is presented in Table 27. Out of the 161 subjects enrolled and dosed in 
CT-301, 158 (98.1%) continued on to CT-301EXT. Three study patients (1.9%) have withdrawn from CT-
301EXT as of the 30 Sep 2019 data cut-off date.  
A total of 68 subjects (42.2%) had completed 2 years of therapy across CT-301 and CT-301EXT as of the

Efficacy pool I results 
Efficacy pool I annualized height velocity 
At the end of CT-301 (week 52), the annualized height velocity for lonapegsomatropin was 11.2 cm/year. 
Continued growth was observed with continued lonapegsomatropin treatment beyond the first year, with an 
annualized height velocity of 9.4 cm/year at week 78 (Table 28, Figure 17). 
At the end of CT-301 (week 52), the annualized height velocity for somatropin was 10.3 cm/year. After a 
treatment switch to lonapegsomatropin, the annualized height velocity at week 78 was 9.3 cm/year (Table , 
Figure).

Efficacy pool I change from baseline in height SDS 
The change from baseline in height SDS by visit for study patients in the efficacy pool I is summarized in 
Table 29 and illustrated in Figure 18. 
At week 78, a persistence in growth effect was observed. Study patients treated with lonapegsomatropin 
therapy for the first year achieved a LS mean (SE) increase in height SDS of 1.39 (0.05) compared with 1.24 
(0.06) for study patients treated with somatropin for the first year of therapy (p = 0.0436). The treatment 
difference (initial lonapegsomatropin minus initial somatropin) from week 52 (0.14) was maintained at week 
78 (0.15).  
Study patients switching from somatropin to lonapegsomatropin followed the same growth speed of those 
originally randomized to lonapegsomatropin, with an increase of approximately 0.29 height SDS from week 
52 to week 78 (1.10 to 1.39 for continuous lonapegsomatropin vs. 0.96 to 1.24 for switch to 
lonapegsomatropin).

Average IGF-I SDS values tended to be higher for lonapegsomatropin-treated study patients compared with 
somatropin-treated study patients in study CT-301, paralleling the observed superior growth outcomes. 
Beyond 52 weeks, for study patients continuing lonapegsomatropin treatment from study CT-301, IGF-I SDS 
values generally remained stable without further increase. For study patients switching from somatropin 
treatment in study CT-301 to lonapegsomatropin treatment in study CT-301EXT, an initial increase in IGF-I 
SDS values with subsequent stabilization was observed.  
Overall, the trends for IGFBP-3 SDS mirrored those for IGF-I SDS.

The change in height SDS at week 78 by subgroup (age, sex, peak stimulated growth hormone, country) for 
efficacy pool I is summarized in Table 31. 
Change in height SDS at week 78 across subgroups was generally consistent with the overall results for 
efficacy pool I, in which a greater change in height SDS was observed for study patients who were 
continuously treated with lonapegsomatropin compared to those treated with somatropin for the first 52 
weeks.

Efficacy pool II subject disposition and key baseline characteristics 
All 54 somatropin-treated study patients from study CT-301 (100%) and 137/143 treatment-experienced 
study patients enrolled and dosed in study CT-302 (95.8%) continued on to study CT-301EXT. As of the data 
cut-off (30 Sep 2019), 5 study patients (2.5%) had withdrawn from study CT-301EXT. Based on this data 
cut-off, no study patients had completed 2 years of lonapegsomatropin treatment in Efficacy Pool II.

Efficacy pool II results 
Efficacy pool II annualized height velocity 
A summary of annualized height velocity by visit for efficacy pool II is provided in Table 33.   
Overall, for efficacy pool II, the duration of prior daily somatropin treatment was 1.1 years. A trend for 
continued growth with lonapegsomatropin was observed in these treatment-experienced study patients, with 
a LS mean (SE) annualized height velocity of 8.36 (0.24) cm/year at week 52.

Note:  A rolling baseline was used to make sure the baseline was no more than 52 weeks apart. The rolling baseline was 
used to calculate the annualized height velocity to make sure there was a 1-year gap. In other words, from the 
15-month (65 weeks) visit onwards, the baseline value used for each successive height velocity calculation was the 
patient’s height at the visit 52 weeks previously. At each post-baseline visit, n is the number of subjects with non-
missing rolling baseline and specific post-baseline. The annualized height velocity at each visit was modelled using 
ANCOVA adjusting for parent study, baseline age, peak growth hormone levels (log transformed) at diagnosis, delta 
average-parental height SDS, prior daily growth hormone dose level (log transformed) and prior daily growth hormone 
treatment duration (log transformed) as covariates and gender as a factor. 
Efficacy pool II change from baseline in height SDS 
Following 52 weeks of treatment with lonapegsomatropin, an LS mean (SE) of 0.45 (0.04) increase in height 
SDS was observed for efficacy pool II (Table 34). While baseline height SDS differed based on the parent 
study, the change from baseline following lonapegsomatropin therapy was consistent across study patients in 
efficacy pool II.

Efficacy pool II average IGF-I SDS and IGFBP-3 
Overall, the average IGF-I SDS remained elevated above pre-treatment levels and was stable over time. The 
trend for the IGFBP-3 SDS in efficacy pool II mirrored that of the IGF-I SDS. 
Efficacy pool II subgroup analyses  
Subgroup analyses with respect to the annualized height velocity, delta height SDS, and delta IGF-I SDS for 
efficacy pool II at week 52 (age, gender, peak stimulated growth hormone level, country) are consistent with 
the subgroup results from study CT-302. 
Comparison of efficacy results of all studies  
Bone age  
Bone age at each visit was summarized descriptively for each subgroup for efficacy pool I and efficacy pool 
II.  
At baseline, bone age was delayed in both CT-301 arms (mean [SD] 2.5 [1.3] years in the 
lonapegsomatropin arm and 2.3 [1.1] years in the somatropin arm). In efficacy pool I the mean (SD) change 
in bone age at week 52 was 1.4 (0.9) years for study patients treated with lonapegsomatropin and 1.4 (0.7) 
years for study patients treated with somatropin. At week 104, the change in bone age was 2.6 years for 
both study patients continuously treated with lonapegsomatropin and study patients treated with somatropin 
followed by lonapegsomatropin. 
Patient experience data  
Patient experience data with lonapegsomatropin administered using vials with syringe/needle and the DCC 
and growth hormone auto-injector combination product were collected during studies CT-302 and 
CT-301EXT.  
After subjects began weekly treatment with lonapegsomatropin in study CT-302, the parents’ assessment of 
convenience and satisfaction were 64.6 and 80.9, respectively, at week 6 and 69.0 and 83.0, respectively, at 
week 13. 
After 6 weeks of growth hormone auto-injector use, the majority of study patients strongly or somewhat 
agreed with the following statements: 
1.  The growth hormone auto-injector did not cause a lot of pain or discomfort (95.5%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 95/142 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  The medicine could be injected without difficulty or making a mistake (100%) in a short amount of time 
(95.6%), without touching blood (97.8%), and left little to no marks on the skin (95.6%) 
3.  Study patients could see that it had been properly injected (95.5%) and were easily notified by sound 
and lights that the medicine was received or if there was a problem (95.6%) 
Overall, no study patient experienced an injury caused by the growth hormone auto-injector that required 
seeing a doctor for help. 
Analysis of clinical information relevant for dosing recommendations  
Based on the comparable annualized height velocity demonstrated for equivalent weekly doses 
(0.21 mg/kg/week) of ACP-001 and somatropin in the Phase 2 CT-004 study, a dose of 0.24 mg/kg/week 
was selected for the lonapegsomatropin and somatropin arms in the global pivotal Phase 3 study CT-001. 
Studies CT-302 and CT-301EXT also evaluated lonapegsomatropin 0.24 mg/kg/week. The slightly higher dose 
(0.24 mg/kg/week) relative to the dose evaluated in study CT-004 served to accommodate global somatropin 
dosing practices (Collett
Solberg 2019) in study CT-301. 
The recommended starting dosages of somatropin with lonapegsomatropin, subsequent dose titration, and 
‑
treatment monitoring are discussed in the sections on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics above. An 
individualized approach with respect to dosing is mandatory, due to individual differences in sensitivity to 
somatropin with lonapegsomatropin.  
Treatment with lonapegsomatropin should be supervised by a physician who is experienced in the diagnosis 
and management of paediatric patients with growth failure associated with GHD. The dosage of 
lonapegsomatropin should be individualized and titrated throughout therapy based on clinical response. 
Additionally, compliance should be assessed, and other potential causes of poor growth (e.g., 
hypothyroidism, under-nutrition, advanced bone age, and antibodies to recombinant human growth 
hormone) should be evaluated if patients experience failure to increase height velocity, particularly during the 
first year of treatment.  
Once the epiphyses are fused, patients should be clinically re-evaluated for need for treatment with growth 
hormone.  
2.6.5.5.  Supportive study(ies)  
Study CT-302 (fliGHt study)  
Study CT-302 was a Phase 3, global, open-label, single-arm 26-week clinical study that evaluated the clinical 
effects of once-weekly lonapegsomatropin in 146 paediatric GHD patients aged 6 months up to 17 years. 
Included patients had (n= 143) or had not received (n=3) prior growth hormone treatment. In respective 
study, the long-term safety and efficacy of lonapegsomatropin treatment were evaluated. 
Methods 
Dosing 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 96/142 
 
 
 
 
The initial dose of lonapegsomatropin was 0.24 mg human growth hormone/kg/week for all study patients, 
regardless of any prior dose of daily human growth hormone. Lonapegsomatropin was administered via vial 
and syringe/needle.  
At visit 2, the lonapegsomatropin dose was adjusted by the investigator based on weight. The goal for IGF-I 
SDS levels was to be between 0 and +2.0 SDS (unless a different target was identified in consultation with 
the medical monitor). Thus, if the IGF-I SDS measured at visit 2 (or the Cmax Visit, as applicable) was <0 
SDS, and after confirmation of IGF-I level as <0 SDS by a second measurement collected 5 days after dosing 
(± 1 day) at an unscheduled visit, the dose may have been increased by approximately 20% to the next 
higher weight bracket by the investigator. 
The investigator (with medical monitor preapproval) or medical monitor may have stopped or reduced the 
dose of trial treatment for an individual study patient at any time during the study in the presence of the 
symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. If treatment was discontinued, all subsequent visits and 
assessments were to continue as planned. 
Objective 
The primary objective was to assess the safety of undergoing the switch from commercially available daily 
human growth hormone to weekly lonapegsomatropin through the first 6 months of treatment in children 
with growth hormone deficiency aged 6 months to 17 years.  
Endpoints 
The efficacy endpoints after 26 weeks of lonapegsomatropin included annualized height velocity, change in 
height SDS, IGF-I SDS, and the proportion of study patients in each category (cut points of 0 to 2.0, −2.0 to 
2.0, and −1.0 to 2.0), and IGFBP-3 SDS. Preference for current once-weekly lonapegsomatropin or prior daily 
somatropin therapy and treatment burden was assessed in study patients ≥9 years old and their parents. 
Convenience and satisfaction were also assessed. These outcomes were analysed combined with data from 
extension study CT-301EXT.  
Results  
• 
Participant flow  
A total of 162 patients were screened, and 146 patients were enrolled into study CT-302 and received at 
least one lonapegsomatropin dose. Of the 146 study patients dosed, 144 (98.6%) completed the study and 
were included in the Full Analysis Set. Two study patients (1.4%) withdrew consent and were withdrawn from 
the study, one after 2 doses of the study drug and one after 9 doses. The reason why consents were 
withdrawn were not reported. 
• 
Baseline data 
The study patients enrolled in the study spanned a wide range of ages (1.2 to 17.4 years). Four study 
patients (2.7%) were less than 3 years old. Approximately 65.0% of study patients were pre-pubertal 
(Tanner stage 1) with the remaining in pubertal transition (Tanner stages 2 to 4). Other key demographic 
and baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 35.

A total of 143 study patients (97.9%) received daily somatropin treatment before enrolment in study CT-302. 
Treatment compliance 
Mean treatment compliance (SD) during the study was 98.4% (3.97%), with a range of 76.0 to 104.0%. The 
majority of study patients (132 study patients, 90.4%) had compliance rates >95%; 8 study patients (5.5%)

• 
Outcomes and estimation 
Annualized height velocity expressed in LS mean was 9.16 at week 13 and 8.72 at week 26. Height SDS 
increased during the study. According to the applicant, this indicates that the study patients reduced their 
growth deficit compared to normal age- and gender-matched children. The applicant indicated that more 
pronounced growth rates were observed for younger study patients and those with more severe growth 
hormone deficiency. 
CT-302 average IGF-I SDS 
At baseline in study CT-302, the mean (SD) IGF-I SDS was 0.85 (1.29). IGF-I SDS across visits based on an 
ANCOVA model are summarized in Table 36. In study CT-302, IGF-I was sampled on post-dose day 5 ± 1, 
which corresponds to the average weekly IGF-I value.

approached their genetic potential (average parental height SDS). After 52 weeks of lonapegsomatropin 
treatment, height SDS improved by mean (SD) 0.51 (0.33).

Study CT-301EXT (enliGHten study)  
Study CT-301EXT is an ongoing, global, open-label, single-arm, Phase 3, long-term extension clinical study. 
This study is conducted to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety data for once-weekly 
lonapegsomatropin (0.24 mg hGH/kg/week) in eligible paediatric patients with growth hormone deficiency 
who had previously participated in study CT-301 or study CT-302. 
Key results as available at the data cut-off date of 30 September 2019 have been included in the presented 
analyses across studies.  
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy  
Clinical efficacy of lonapegsomatropin treatment in paediatric patients with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) 
was evaluated in one Phase 2 dose-finding study (study CT-004) and three Phase 3 studies (studies CT-301, 
CT-302, and CT-301EXT). Study CT-301 is the pivotal study in the current application; studies CT-302 and 
CT-301EXT are supportive studies.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study design. Study CT-301 was a pivotal, 52-week, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 clinical study in 
paediatric GHD patients in which the clinical effects of once-weekly lonapegsomatropin compared with those 
of daily treatment with somatropin product Genotropin, both at a total dosage of 0.24 mg/kg/week. Included 
study patients were centrally allocated to lonapegsomatropin or somatropin, at a 2:1 ratio. 
Though study CT-301 was an open-label study, a blinding procedure was set in order to assess endpoints 
without knowing a patient’s treatment. However, an unspecified number of failures in the blinding procedure 
were reported. An appropriate reporting of unblinded study patients would have helped to better apprehend 
the level of bias in the study. 
Supportive study CT-302 was a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm 26-week clinical study that evaluated the 
clinical effects of once-weekly lonapegsomatropin in 146 paediatric GHD patients with growth hormone 
deficiency aged 6 months up to 17 years. As 143/146 (97.9%) of included patients had (n= 143) received 
(n=3) prior growth hormone treatment, the design of study CT-302 is suitable to evaluate the clinical effects 
of lonapegsomatropin in paediatric GHD patients who had received prior growth hormone treatment.  
Study patients who completed study CT-301 or CT-302 were eligible to participate in open-label extension 
study CT-301EXT. This is in line with the CHMP recommendation to evaluate the clinical effects of 
lonapegsomatropin in paediatric GHD patients for more than one year in both EMA scientific advice 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/588843/2016 and EMA/CHMP/SAWP/711581/2017). In study CT-301EXT all study 
patients were treated with weekly lonapegsomatropin at a dosage of 0.24 mg/kg/week. In some patients in 
study CT-301EXT, the safety and ease of use of lonapegsomatropin administration by means of a dual-
chamber cartridge and growth hormone auto-injector were evaluated after initial administration with a 
syringe. This is acceptable. 
Due to the open-label design of Phase 3 studies CT-301, CT-302, and CT-301EXT, the study results of these 
studies may be affected by bias to some extent. However, growth parameters which concern key endpoints in 
these studies can be measured objectively.  
Study population. In pivotal study CT-301 treatment-naïve pre-pubertal paediatric GHD patients aged 3-17 
years were included. These study patients were generally selected in line with general EMA guidance in this 
respect (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/94528/2005 Rev. 1) and EMA scientific advice on lonapegsomatropin 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/588843/2016).  
In study CT-302, paediatric GHD patients aged 6 months up to 18 years were included. These patients had to 
have received prior growth hormone treatment, except from those aged 6 months up to 3 years. GHD Was 
diagnosed according to criteria mentioned in guidelines on growth hormone deficiency.5,6  In addition, many 
in- and exclusion criteria were in line with those in pivotal study CT-301. Overall, respective criteria were 
endorsed by the CHMP in the scientific advice.

Comparator. In study CT-301, clinical effects of weekly lonapegsomatropin were compared with those of 
daily dosed somatropin product Genotropin, both at a total weekly dose of 0.24 mg/kg/week. The selected 
dosage of the somatropin product Genotropin is in line with the recommended posology of this product in the 
SmPC of Genotropin. It is acknowledged that a weekly lonapegsomatropin dosage of 0.24 mg/kg/week was 
accepted by the CHMP in the EMA scientific advice. The recommended starting dose in paediatric GHD 
patients who received prior growth hormone treatment, as well as the dose titration and treatment 
monitoring ((based on IGF-I SDS levels, auxological parameters, safety, gender, prior treatment with daily 
GH) and the frequency of this monitoring in particular circumstances (e.g. after a dose change, change of 
Tanner stage, or adverse events) in lonapegsomatropin-treated paediatric GHD patients irrespective of any 
prior growth hormone treatment, were substantiated. The applicant proposed for naïve and non-naïve 
children acceptable recommendations of dose titration and treatment evaluation in the SmPC according to 
IGF-I SDS levels and puberty status. The gender has no impact on the dose. In line with this, the somatropin 
dosing recommendations with lonapegsomatropin are the same for boys and girls with GHD (see also above 
clinical pharmacology section). 
Endpoints. The primary efficacy endpoint in study CT-301 was the annualized height velocity at week 52. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints in this study included the annualized height velocity over 52 weeks, the change 
in height SDS over 52 weeks, and serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels. Aforementioned primary and secondary 
endpoints are relevant for the evaluation of the clinical effects of growth hormone treatment and were 
considered acceptable in EMA scientific advice EMA/CHMP/SAWP/588843/2016. 
The CHMP advised in 2016 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/588843/2016) that increased adherence compared to daily 
injections and PROs should be considered as secondary outcome measures for pivotal study CT-301. 
Although these endpoints were not included in study CT-301, such endpoints were included in studies CT-302  
and study CT-301EXT. 
Studies CT-302 and CT-301EXT had similar endpoints. Considering the aforementioned scientific advice, the 
respective endpoints in these studies are also acceptable. 
Statistical analysis. For the comparison of clinical effects with respect to the primary endpoint annualized 
height velocity at week 52 in study CT-301, a non-inferiority margin of 2.0 cm/year was chosen. A test for 
superiority would be conducted if non-inferiority was demonstrated. In the EMA scientific advices it was 
indicated that this non-inferiority margin could be acceptable upon appropriate substantiation.  
Efficacy in studies CT-302 and CT-301EXT was evaluated in a descriptive manner, since no comparisons 
between study arms can be made between study arms in these open-label studies. 
Dynamic allocation (minimization rule) was used for randomization in study CT-301. When dynamic allocation 
is used the type 1 error control is not always ensured with conventional statistical methods, as indicated in 
the EMA Guideline on adjustment for baseline covariates in clinical trials (EMA/CHMP/295050/2013). The 
impact and implications of dynamic allocation methods on the statistical analysis were initially unclear. A re-
randomization test provided comparable results, indicating that dynamic allocation unlikely has led to a 
much-inflated Type I error.  
Eighteen major protocol deviations were reported in study CT-301. It was initially unknown to which extent 
obtained study results will change if study patients with major protocol deviations would be excluded. The 
applicant showed that upon exclusion of all study patients with major deviations, non-inferiority of 
lonapegsomatropin as compared to somatropin was still demonstrated in the per-protocol population.

From conducted geographical subgroup analysis concerning the primary endpoint in study CT-301, the 
obtained results in EU countries were unclear. The applicant demonstrated later in a primary subgroup 
analysis restricted to EU countries consistent results with the overall analysis. Though the EU population was 
a small fraction of the total study population (~12%), the CHMP agrees that non-inferiority was also 
confirmed in this subgroup. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Patient disposition. 162 Study patients were randomized in study CT-301. 104 of 106 (98.1%) study 
patients randomized to lonapegsomatropin and 55 of 56 (98.2%) study patients randomized to somatropin 
completed the study. Hence, premature study dropout was well-balanced between study treatment groups. 
Of the 146 study patients dosed in study CT-302, 144 (98.6%) completed the study.  
Baseline characteristics. In study CT-301, the demographics and baseline data between the treatment 
groups were balanced. At baseline, study patients had diminished growth with a mean height velocity of 3.93 
cm/year and a mean height SDS of -2.93. These data indicate a serious growth retardation. The majority of 
study patients (65.2%) had isolated, idiopathic aetiology of growth hormone deficiency. 
The proportion of men of the total study population that was included in studies CT-004, CT-301 and CT-302 
were respectively 71.7%, 82.0% and 75.3%. These proportions exceed the male proportion of growth 
hormone deficiency patients of 66.7%, i.e. a male: female ratio of 2:1, reported in the literature (e.g. 
Grimberg et al. 2005). The relatively high proportions of male GHD study patients in the clinical studies 
hamper comparisons between the studies on lonapegsomatropin and studies on other growth hormone 
medicinal products. 
The impact of gender on the lonapegsomatropin dosing recommendations was initially unclear. The applicant 
indicated later that currently available results on key efficacy endpoints are similar for male and female GHD 
patients. In line with this, the somatropin dosing recommendations with lonapegsomatropin are the same for 
boys and girls with GHD (see also above clinical pharmacology section). 
In study CT-302, no European patients were included. Like in study CT-301, the proportion of men (75.3% of 
study patients) was relatively high. Only four GHD patients under 3 years of age were included in study CT-
302 and they appeared to be more sensitive to the clinical effects of lonapegsomatropin compared to older 
paediatric GHD patients. During the assessment process, the applicant decided not to seek an indication for 
lonapegsomatropin in paediatric GHD patients under 3 years of age due to limited data in this group of 
patients. 
Compliance. The compliance in study CT-301 was between >95% and ≤100% for 99% of 
lonapegsomatropin-treated study patients and 94.6% of somatropin-treated study patients. In study CT-302 
mean treatment compliance (SD) during study CT-302 was 98.4% (3.97%) with a range of 76.0 to 104.0%. 
The majority of study patients (132 study patients, 90.4%) had compliance rates >95%. The aforementioned 
data show that the compliance rates of lonapegsomatropin were acceptable in paediatric GHD patients who 
either had or had not received prior growth hormone treatment. However, it is unclear whether the 
compliance rates in the trial can also be expected in clinical practice. 
Primary endpoint – Annualized height velocity at week 52. For observed cases in study CT-301, the 
mean (SD) annualized height velocity at week 52 was 10.90 (2.29) cm/year for lonapegsomatropin and 
10.22 (2.37) cm/year for somatropin. The LS mean (SE) of annualized height velocity at week 52 was 11.17 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 107/142 
 
 
 
 
(0.23) cm/year for lonapegsomatropin compared with 10.31 (0.30) cm/year for somatropin, with a difference 
in LS means (SE) of 0.86 (0.33) cm/year (95% CI: 0.22 to 1.50). Since the lower confidence bound was 
above the non-inferiority margin of -2.0 cm/year, non-inferiority was demonstrated. In addition, the 
treatment difference was statistically significant in favour of lonapegsomatropin (P = 0.0088); therefore, 
statistical superiority has been demonstrated but not clinically. Indeed, the upper bound of the 95% 
confidence interval (0.22, 1.50) is inferior to the +2 cm limit of non-inferiority. Consistent results were 
obtained from sensitivity analyses with different analysis models and missing data handling methods. As in 
clinical practice, paediatric GHD patients are titrated on growth (velocity) for efficacy and IGF-I (above the 
+2 SDS) for safety and adherence to treatment. The observed results suggest a difference in titration in both 
arms. Therefore, although the superiority of lonapegsomatropin over somatropin was demonstrated 
statistically, it is unclear whether comparable IGF-I levels would also provide a (clinically relevant) better 
response. Hence, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the clinical effects of weekly 
lonapegsomatropin are superior to those of daily somatropin. 
Secondary endpoints are in line with the primary outcome.  
A statistically significant treatment-by-age interaction was observed in study CT-301. This finding is 
consistent with the known effects of daily somatropin, where larger annualized height velocities are observed 
for younger children.7 The larger treatment difference in favour of lonapegsomatropin for younger children 
reflects greater treatment benefit for patients with greater growth potential compared to older GHD patients. 
It is well-known that older children have less growth benefit potential from growth hormone treatments. 
Because of this, the expected clinical response to lonapegsomatropin concerning growth will be more limited 
and not relevant after achieving final height in older GHD patients.  
In study CT-302, annualized height velocity in LS mean was 9.16 at week 13 and 8.72 at week 26. Observed 
height velocities tended to be somewhat lower compared to those observed in study CT-301. These 
observations are in line with literature indicating that growth in paediatric GHD patients continues at a lower, 
more constant rate after an initial catch-up growth in treatment- non-naïve paediatric GHD patients.8 
Secondary endpoint - Change in height SDS compared to baseline. In study CT-301, changes in height 
SDS compared to baseline tended to increase for both lonapegsomatropin (LS means week 5: 0.13, LS 
means week 52: 1.10) and somatropin (LS means week 5: 0.12, LS means week 52: 0.96) during follow-up. 
Treatment differences with respect to this endpoint were statistically significant from week 26 onwards. 
In line with the annualized height velocity, change from baseline in height SDS at week 26 upon 
lonapegsomatropin treatment tended to be larger in growth hormone treatment naïve patients in study CT-
301 (LS mean 0.68) compared to those in study CT-302 (LS mean 0.25). 
Secondary endpoint – Average IGF-I SDS levels. In study CT-301, average IGF-I SDS levels tended to 
increase for both lonapegsomatropin and somatropin from week 13 (LS mean lonapegsomatropin: 0.31, LS 
mean somatropin: -0.60) up to week 52 (LS mean lonapegsomatropin: 0.72, LS mean somatropin: -0.02). 
The average IGF-I SDS levels were higher for lonapegsomatropin as compared to somatropin throughout the 
study. In line with this pharmacodynamic effect, the clinical effects of lonapegsomatropin with respect to 
growth were larger than those of somatropin.

At baseline in study CT-302, the mean IGF-I SDS was +0.85. Upon switching from commercially available 
daily somatropin products to once-weekly lonapegsomatropin, average IGF-I SDS increased by approximately 
0.7. These data support improved growth parameters in these patients, as reported above. 
In the clinical studies, the average IGF-I SDS levels increased over time with a significant proportion of 
paediatric GHD patients with average IGF-I SDS levels above +2 (i.e. 7.6% in CT-301, 56.8% in CT-302 and 
48.6% in CT-301 EXT at any point) and above +3 (i.e. 25.3% in CT-302 and 19.6% in CT-301 Ext at any 
point), especially in non-naïve patients who switched from daily somatropin to weekly lonapegsomatropin. 
Chronically elevated IGF-I SDS levels may increase particular safety risks such as neoplasms, diabetes 
mellitus type 2, and brain hemorrhages. The patient characteristics of study patients in whom elevated IGF-I 
SDS levels were observed were initially unclear. In post hoc univariate logistic regression analyses, age, 
weight, and more advanced Tanner stages (3, 4, and 5) were significantly associated with IGF-I SDS levels 
above +2. Especially in these patients, regular monitoring of IGF-I SDS levels and dose adjustments in case 
of IGF-I SDS levels outside the normal range between -2 and +2 are mandatory (the IGF-I SDS target should 
be close to 0 SDS according to Collett-Solberg et al. 20199). Upon request, the applicant included practical 
guidance with respect to somatropin starting doses with lonapegsomatropin, treatment monitoring including 
evaluation of IGF-I SDS levels, and somatropin dose adjustment in the SmPC. A more specific discussion 
about these aspects is available in the clinical pharmacology section above. 
Subgroup analyses. According to a subgroup analysis in study CT-301, several baseline characteristics 
seem to be associated with a more pronounced favourable response to lonapegsomatropin as compared to 
somatropin treatment. These baseline characteristics include age < 6 years, a growth hormone level > 5 
ng/ml during a growth hormone stimulation test, male gender, and a patient origin outside the United States 
of America.  
The difference in effects between lonapegsomatropin and somatropin treatment with respect to the 
annualized height velocity at week 52 tended to be smaller in US patients compared to non-US patients in 
study CT-301. The reason for this trend was first unclear.  It was reported in literature that annualized height 
velocity in the first year is influenced by demographic variables, such as chronological age, bone age, height, 
height velocity, and IGF-I prior to initiating treatment, as well as severity of GHD.10 The US patients had 
older chronological age, older bone age, higher baseline height SDS, higher baseline IGF-I SDS, and higher 
baseline height velocity. In addition, the imprecision due to the small sample size in the US (n= 42) could 
explain the wider confidence interval in US patients as compared to non-US patients. It is likely that 
differences in baseline characteristics ma explain (part of) the observed difference. There is no evidence that 
the underlying treatment effect of lonapegsomatropin is different for US patients as compared to non-US 
patients. 
Ancillary analyses. An integrated analysis was conducted across studies CT-301, CT-302, and CT-301EXT. 
Efficacy across studies was evaluated in two pools:

lonapegsomatropin or somatropin in study CT-301 and subsequently lonapegsomatropin in study CT-
301EXT.

- 
Efficacy pool II: a pooled review of efficacy data in study CT-301EXT in study patients who had 
received treatment with somatropin product Genotropin in study CT-301, and study patients in study CT-
302 who had received prior somatropin treatment. 
The results of efficacy pool analyses should be interpreted with caution due to differences between particular 
studies. This especially applies to efficacy pool II, in which GHD patients from different studies were included. 
Efficacy pool analyses may therefore only be used for explorative purposes. 
The rationale for a rolling baseline was initially not understood. The applicant later clarified that the 
annualized height velocity concerns the annualized height velocity calculated based on the available data 
within the first year of follow-up or the annualized height velocity over the last year from follow-up week 65 
onwards. Hence, the annualized height velocity concerns the annualized height velocity within the last year.  
Some study patients prematurely discontinued study participation in studies CT-301, CT-302, and CT-
301EXT.  Limited information about this is available. The applicant later indicated that three out of five study 
patients who had participated in study CT-302 withdrew their consent in study CT-301EXT because of 
reaching satisfactory height, according to the investigator. 
Efficacy pool I. At the end of study CT-301 (week 52), the annualized height velocity for lonapegsomatropin 
was 11.2 cm/year. Continued growth was observed with continued lonapegsomatropin treatment beyond the 
first year, with an annualized height velocity of 8.7 cm/year at week 104. At the end of CT-301 (week 52), 
the annualized height velocity for somatropin was 10.3 cm/year. After a treatment switch to 
lonapegsomatropin, the annualized height velocity at week 104 was 9.0 cm/year. At week 104, the 
annualized height velocity of study patients who had received lonapegsomatropin (8.7 cm/year) and those 
who had received somatropin (9.0 cm/year) in study CT-301 was comparable. Data mentioned above indicate 
that after a switch from somatropin to lonapegsomatropin a similar annualized height velocity can be 
obtained as compared to patients who had been treated with lonapegsomatropin. Similar trends were 
observed for height increases and IGF-I levels.  
The aforementioned observations are in line with literature indicating that growth in paediatric GHD patients 
continues at a lower, more constant rate after an initial catch-up growth in treatment-naïve paediatric GHD 
patients.11   
Efficacy pool II. In efficacy pool II, the annualized height velocity was relatively constant (LS mean 8.6 up 
to 8.8 cm/year) from week 13 up to 52 in paediatric GHD patients who have received prior growth hormone 
treatment. This also applied to the average IGF-I SDS and IGFBP-3 levels. Changes in height SDS tended to 
increase with time (LS mean week 13: 0.13, LS mean week 52: 0.48).  
In a subgroup analysis of efficacy pool II younger paediatric GHD patients and those with more severe 
growth hormone deficiency (peak stimulated growth hormone ≤5 ng/ml) displayed more pronounced rates of 
growth as measured by the annualized height velocity and change from baseline in height SDS. The potential 
implications of the subgroup analysis for efficacy pool II for lonapegsomatropin treatment in clinical practice 
were initially unclear. The applicant indicated later that the subgroup analyses in efficacy pool II support the 
efficacy of lonapegsomatropin treatment in clinical practice across the ages, and spectrum of peak stimulated 
GH levels, among other variables in the Phase 3 studies. It is also agreed that the efficacy results in efficacy 
pool II also support the broad clinical efficacy of weekly lonapegsomatropin in patients who switched from 
daily somatropin treatment.

Growth hormone treatment may, at least in theory, result in earlier than expected closure of growth plates, 
leading to premature cessation of growth effects (Kang 2019). This was not observed for lonapegsomatropin. 
Bone age in years was similar at baseline, week 52 and week 104 in study patients who had been treated 
with either lonapegsomatropin or somatropin in study CT-301 and who received lonapegsomatropin in study 
CT-301EXT. 
The treatment burden as evaluated by the Child Sheehan Disability Scores for both the paediatric study 
patients and (their) parents decreased from baseline in study patients treated with lonapegsomatropin in 
studies CT-302 and CT-301EXT. This also applies to study patients who used the dual-chamber cartridge and 
growth hormone auto-injector combination product in study CT-301EXT. 
A consistent preference for once-weekly lonapegsomatropin relative to daily somatropin treatment was 
reported by children and parents at week 6 and 13 in studies CT-302 and CT-301EXT. This preference 
increased with continued lonapegsomatropin treatment. Acceptable convenience (≥ 69) and satisfaction (≥ 
80) scores of the TSQM-9 questionnaire were obtained in parents of study patient upon the use of 
lonapegsomatropin in efficacy pool II. This also applies to parents of study patients who switched to the dual-
chamber cartridge and growth hormone auto-injector combination product in study CT-301EXT. 
Available data indicate that the use of the dual-chamber cartridge and growth hormone-auto injector 
combination product was safe and easy to use in the majority of study patients. 
Study data of ongoing study CT-301EXT were initially submitted until the data cut-off in September 2019. 
Later, additional clinical efficacy data of ongoing study CT-301EXT were submitted until the data cut-off in 
June 2020.  
Long-term data on the clinical effects of lonapegsomatropin are yet unavailable. Growth on 
lonapegsomatropin treatment may decrease or even stop prematurely. It is yet unknown whether paediatric 
GHD patients on lonapegsomatropin treatment can achieve a similar final height as those who were treated 
with somatropin. For this reason, both the PDCO (P/0275/2020) and CHMP (scientific advice 
EMA/CHMP/SAWP/588843/2016 and EMA/CHMP/SAWP/711581/2017) indicated that long-term efficacy data 
on the clinical effects of lonapegsomatropin should be obtained. The PDCO requested data on the final 
heights of included paediatric GHD study patients. These data will be obtained as part of a requested PASS. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Lonapegsomatropin has been developed for treatment of paediatric GHD patients. All Phase 3 studies were 
conducted in these patients. A paediatric investigational plan was approved and completed (see above). 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy  
Submitted clinical studies support the clinical efficacy of lonapegsomatropin treatment in paediatric GHD 
patients who have or have not received prior growth hormone treatment. In the pivotal study CT-301, the 
mean annualized height velocity in growth hormone treatment naïve study patients at week 52 was 10.90 
cm/year for lonapegsomatropin and 10.22 cm/year for somatropin. The LS mean of annualized height 
velocity at week 52 was 11.17 cm/year for lonapegsomatropin compared with 10.31 cm/year for somatropin, 
with a difference in LS means of 0.86 cm/year (95% CI: 0.22 to 1.50). Non-inferiority was demonstrated. In 
addition, the treatment difference was statistically significant in favour of lonapegsomatropin (P = 0.0088). 
Taking into account the differences in IGF levels, there is, however, insufficient evidence to conclude 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 111/142 
 
 
 
 
therapeutic superiority of lonapegsomatropin over somatropin. 
Lonapegsomatropin is also effective in paediatric GHD patients who have received prior growth hormone 
treatment, but the clinical effects of lonapegsomatropin tend to be less pronounced in these patients than 
those who are naïve to growth hormone treatment.  
The clinical effects of long-term lonapegsomatropin treatment should be evaluated further.  
Long-term efficacy data, i.e. data on final height, will be generated as part of the secondary objectives of the 
PASS. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety  
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure  
A total of 379 individuals (306 children with GHD and 73 healthy adult subjects) have been exposed to at 
least 1 dose of lonapegsomatropin. At the 01 June 2020 data cut, of the 306 children included in the clinical 
programme 290 were exposed to lonapegsomatropin for more than one year. Lonapegsomatropin treatment 
was initiated under 3 years of age in four paediatric GHD patients. 
In the safety pool II 160 patients were mentioned to have a follow-up of ≥2 year. 
Overall, the mean duration of lonapegsomatropin treatment was 100.3 weeks, and the mean number of 
actual doses of study drug was 499.3. 
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events  
Overall, 29 study patients (9.5%) experienced treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events. 
Respective adverse events were reported at a comparable frequency among study patients who had (8.6%) 
and those who had not one or more IGF-I SDS levels above +2 (10.8%). Commonly reported (≥2 subjects 
overall) treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events were secondary hypothyroidism (2.6%), 
headache (2.0%), increased IGF-I (1.3%), growing pains and injection site atrophy (0.7% each). Strabismus 
and hypermetropia were also considered related to lonapegsomatropin treatment, but all cases were reported 
from the same investigator who had doubts about a possible relationship with drug products. The review of 
cases of strabismus and hypermetropia did not provide sufficient level of evidence of a causal relationship 
with lonapegsomatropin. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events  
There have been no deaths reported in the clinical development program for lonapegsomatropin. 
In Safety Pool II, 12 (3.9%) experienced 20 serious adverse events: 6 study patients (5.7%) in the CT-301 
lonapegsomatropin/CT-301EXT group, 3 study patients (5.5%) in the CT-301 somatropin/CT-301EXT group, 
and 3 study patients (2.1%) in the CT-302/CT-301EXT group. Besides the single patient in study CT-301 
treated with daily somatropin who reported a serious adverse event, several study patients treated with 
lonapegsomatropin experienced serious adverse events of epilepsy (including generalized tonic-clonic 
seizure; N=2), pyrexia (N=1), gastrointestinal viral infection (N=1), vomiting (N=1), cyclic vomiting 
syndrome (N=1), adenoidal hypertrophy (N=1), appendicitis (N=1), atrioventricular block (N=1), chest pain 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 112/142 
 
 
 
(N=1), tonsillitis (N=1), humerus fracture (N=1), pneumonia (N=1), headache (N=1), upper limb fracture 
(N=1), serum sickness-like disorder (N=1), and rash (N=1). None of these serious adverse events was 
assessed by the Investigator as related to the study drug or resulted in changes in study drug dose. 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings  
Although there were occasional excursions for individual subjects, the mean and median values of all 
haematology, chemistry, lipid panel (cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) and 
hormone and glycaemic parameters remained within the reference ranges at all time points. 
2.6.8.5.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for safety  
No such studies were conducted, which is agreed by the CHMP. 
2.6.8.6.  Safety in special populations  
There were no remarkable differences between the various age groups, genders or regions with respect to 
demographics, incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, or laboratory test results. It should be taken 
in mind that this indication is for children only. Therefore, no information on the elderly (over the age of 65) 
was included in the application. 
2.6.8.7.  Immunological events  
Anti-drug antibody findings following lonapegsomatropin exposure and its potential impact on clinical efficacy 
and safety were evaluated. The evaluation was conducted for all analysed samples up to the interim data cut 
date of 01 June 2020. 
Overall, transient positive results for anti-hGH binding antibodies were seen after baseline in a total of 
14 subjects (4.7%). Treatment-emergent anti-hGH antibodies were detected in 13 subjects, while 1 subject 
had a treatment-boosted positive result. 
Twelve subjects (4.0%) had treatment-emergent positive anti-lonapegsomatropin binding antibody results. 
Antibodies were transient in 6 subjects (2.0%) and persistent in 6 subjects (2.0%).  
Two subjects (0.7%) had treatment-emergent, transient positive results for anti-mPEG binding antibodies. 
The impact of persistent antibodies against lonapegsomatropin on clinical efficacy was initially unclear. The 
applicant later showed that the IGF-I SDS levels and height SDS of the six study patients with antibodies 
against lonapegsomatropin were within the range of study patients without such antibodies. Hence, observed 
persistent antibodies against lonapegsomatropin are non-neutralising, i.e. they do not affect efficacy.  
For safety, the applicant analysed the relation between injection site reactions and ADA. Of the 4 patients 
with injection site reactions (on lonapegsomatropin), only 1 was positive for ADA. Given the limited analysis 
and the low number of events, no firm conclusions can be drawn. This will be evaluated further as part of 
routine pharmacovigilance.

2.6.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions  
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with lonapegsomatropin. This is agreed by the 
CHMP. 
2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events  
There have been no treatment-emergent adverse events that led to the discontinuation of the study drug 
during any of the phase 3 studies of lonapegsomatropin. 
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience  
Lonapegsomatropin was approved in the United States on 25 August 2021 for the treatment of paediatric 
patients 1 year and older who weigh at least 11.5 kg and have growth failure due to inadequate secretion of 
endogenous growth hormone (GH). This approval occurred after the cut-off date for the safety report 
included in this application, and no post-marketing data are yet available. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety  
In the safety assessment information from Safety Pool II (consisted of integrated data from the three phase 
3 studies in children with GHD (CT 301, CT 302, and CT 301EXT)) was used. 
Exposure 
The number of patients (N=306) is limited for a safety database and does not fulfil the requirements of the 
ICH-E1 (at least 1500 patients exposed). However, as growth hormone is a well-known active substance, as 
is the PEG used, the safety database is considered sufficient to compare the safety profile with the known 
profile of growth hormone and the PEG.  
In Safety Pool II, 290 children were exposed to lonapegsomatropin for more than one year. Further, 160 
children were treated for ≥2 years. The mean exposure (SD) was 100.3 (29.5) weeks. This exposure is 
sufficient for the assessment of acute safety (within one year). For long-term safety, this follow-up time is 
considered insufficient as there is an ongoing discussion on the carcinogenic effect of GH (and/or IGF-I) and 
possible induction of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is anticipated that long-term safety risks of 
lonapegsomatropin treatment are more likely in the case of IGF-I SDS levels above +2. As indicated in the 
pharmacodynamic section, such IGF-I SDS levels were increasingly observed upon lonapegsomatropin 
treatment with time, especially in non-naïve patients. From the available scientific information, it is unclear 
what are the characteristics of paediatric GHD patients in whom such IGF-I SDS levels were observed. A 
follow-up measure regarding conducting a PASS is proposed. 
The PASS should not only collect information on malignancies and cases of diabetes mellitus type 2 but also 
should evaluate the – theoretical – adverse events induced by the PEG molecule (see non-clinical part of the 
dossier). Due to the absence of specific markers for safety risks of mPEG exposure, it is difficult to 
demonstrate that particular safety risks are due to long-term mPEG exposure. However, evaluation of renal, 
hepatic, immunologic, and neurologic adverse events, neurological examination (e.g. cranial nerves, motor 
and sensory function, gait, coordination and language), and laboratory parameters (e.g. serum creatinine, 
transaminases, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) are useful to evaluate potential safety risks due to mPEG 
exposure. Similar evaluations are conducted in ongoing PASS of medicinal products indicated for treatment of 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 114/142 
 
 
 
patients with haemophilia A. 
As the concerns are based on the ongoing discussion in the scientific community (malignancies and type 2 
diabetes mellitus) or non-clinical observations (PEG related issues) the PASS should be considered a category 
3.  
The indications of several PEGylated medicinal products are limited to patients aged 12 years and above due 
to uncertainties concerning the long-term safety risks of mPEG exposure. Considering lonapegsomatropin is 
transiently pegylated, mPEG clearance is expected to be faster with lonapegsomatropin compared to 
permanently PEGylated compounds for long-term use. In line with this, observed non-clinical and clinical data 
on therapeutic lonapegsomatropin doses thus far do not indicate increased safety risks in paediatric GHD 
patients aged 3-12 years. Hence, currently available data suggest that the safety risks of mPEG exposure are 
acceptable in paediatric GHD patients aged 3-18 years in the short-term. Based on the currently available 
data, the possibility of prolonged mPEG accumulation in the choroid plexus and other tissues and organs is 
considered to be small at the expected exposure range. Safety risks of long-term mPEG exposure with 
lonapegsomatropin will also be evaluated in a PASS.  
Patient and baseline characteristics 
Subjects were predominantly male (78.8%), the mean (SD) age for subjects who initiated lonapegsomatropin 
treatment was 9.7 (3.5) years. Of the patients, 69.7% were prepubertal (Tanner stage I) upon starting 
lonapegsomatropin treatment, particularly study patients who started in CT-301, which required study 
patients to be in Tanner stage I at enrolment. In the safety pool II 64.7% of study patients had prior human 
growth hormone treatment experience (198/306 study patients), and the mean (SD) duration of prior human 
growth hormone therapy was 1.10 (0.63) years (range: 0.25 to 3.97 years). The most frequent mentioned 
medical conditions are endocrine disorders.  
The male predominance is well-known, with an almost 2:1 male to female ratio. Therefore the 78.8% male 
patients in safety pool II and the 81.9% male patients in study CT-301 might induce some bias. The mean 
age for study patients who initiated lonapegsomatropin treatment was similar to the age of treatment 
initiation for the general paediatric GHD population. Traditionally, in studies evaluating growth in children, all 
patients included are pre-pubertal. Given the fact that 30.6% of the patients is not prepubertal, the effects of 
sex hormones introduce a bias; therefore, a comparison with literature should be made with caution. 
Overall, the most common (≥10%) concomitant medications were painkillers/ antipyretics (propionic acid 
derivatives, 38.9%; anilides, 33.7%); penicillins with extended-spectrum (19.3%), antihistamines for 
systemic use (17.0%); glucocorticoids (15.7%); plain multivitamins (15.0%), piperazine derivatives 
(14.4%); thyroid hormones (13.7% each); centrally acting sympathomimetics (13.1% each); selective 
beta-2 adrenoreceptor agonists (12.1%) corticosteroids and expectorants (11.4% each); and opium alkaloids 
and derivatives (10.5%). This is not unexpected for patients suffering from GHD. 
Overall, the type and frequency of concomitant treatments were balanced across patient study groups. 
Adverse events 
Overall, over three-quarters of subjects experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event 
(235/306; 76.8%). The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events considered by the investigator to be 
related to the study drug was 9.5%. 
The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (≥10%) were upper respiratory tract infection 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 115/142 
 
 
 
 
(23.2%), pyrexia (16.3%), nasopharyngitis (15.4%), headache (12.7%), and cough (12.1%). The 
occurrence of pyrexia was associated with adverse events pertaining to the system organ class Infections or 
infestations or with other adverse events commonly associated with pyrexia such as headache, vomiting and 
nausea in most cases which provide a more probable explanation. Moreover, interpretation of the imbalance 
of incidence of pyrexia observed between somatropin, and lonapegsomatropin groups is difficult considering 
the low number of patients enrolled. Therefore, there is not sufficient evidence of a causal relationship 
between pyrexia and lonapegsomatropin.  
Overall, most subjects experienced treatment-emergent adverse events that were mild (44.4%) or moderate 
(29.1%); 10 subjects (3.3%) experienced treatment-emergent adverse events that were severe.  
Overall, 29 subjects (9.5%) experienced treatment-related emergent adverse events. Commonly 
reported (≥2 subjects overall) treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events were secondary 
hypothyroidism (2.6%), headache (2.0%), increased IGF-I (1.0%), growing pains, scoliosis, and injection 
site atrophy (0.7% each). Three treatment-emergent adverse events strabismus and hypermetropia were 
considered related to lonapegsomatropin treatment by the same investigator who had doubts about a 
possible relationship with drug products. However, the review of these 3 cases (2 with lonapegsomatropin 
and 1 with somatropin) did not provide sufficient evidence for a causal relationship with lonapegsomatropin 
since strabismus and hypermetropia are not expected adverse reaction of growth hormone therapy.  
Except for injection site atrophy the safety profile of lonapegsomatropin was consistent with that of daily 
somatropin products evaluated in a clinical study setting.  
There have been no deaths reported in the clinical development program for lonapegsomatropin. 
Serious adverse events were experienced by 12 subjects (3.9%) overall; none of these serious adverse 
events were assessed by the investigator as related to the study drug or resulted in changes in study drug 
dose.  
Based on few available data on laboratory findings and multiple causes for reported excursions, no dose 
adjustments or specific warnings can be proposed in the product information. 
During the clinical program, there were no remarkable findings for vital signs. 
Local tolerability is of special interest with once-weekly preparations. In comparison with somatropin 
(study CT-301), the incidence reported 15 minutes after the administration of study patients was greater in 
the lonapegsomatropin group (redness (20% vs 3.6%), swelling (5.7% vs 0.0%), or other injection-related 
symptoms (1.0% vs 0.0%)). The incidence of bruising was comparable between both arms. In the open-label 
study (study CT-302) 15 minutes after the administration, study patients reported symptoms of redness 
(47.3%), swelling (12.3%) or pain (3.5%). In the lonapegsomatropin treated patients reporting of injection-
related symptoms decreased over subsequent weeks. Injection side atrophy was mentioned for 3 patients (of 
the 306 in the pool). In one patient, the atrophy resolved. In the somatropin group, injection site atrophy 
was not reported. Although anecdotally mentioned as an adverse event during daily growth treatment, 
injection site atrophy in 0.7% of the patients is surprising. In this aspect, it is reassuring that the frequency 
of lipoatrophy is more or less the same between daily growth hormone (1.2%) and the lonapegsomatropin 
when using the auto-injector (1.5%). To further reduce the injection site reactions, it is advised in the SmPC 
to vary the administration site to prevent lipoatrophy (this is a class warning). Based on these results and 
additional literature showing that growth hormone itself may cause the observed lipoatrophy, this adverse 
event is not thought to negatively impact the compliance to the lonapegsomatropin as compared to the daily 
somatropin treatment.

Dose reductions were mostly due to high IGF-I levels. In 1 subject this was temporary. In 3 subjects, the 
dose was reduced for the remainder of the study. Two subjects had their dose of study drug reduced due to 
headache. Temporarily dose reductions were due to coxitis, abdominal pain and viral gastroenteritis. One 
subject had a dose reduction while on somatropin treatment. The dose was reduced due to facial oedema. 
Doses of growth hormone treatment may need to be adjusted due to abnormal IGF-I levels and/or an 
inappropriate clinical response of a patient, as stated in the SmPC.  
In study CT-301 a QTcF change >60 msec was observed in one patient during lonapegsomatropin 
treatment, and a total of 14 study patients (13.3%) and 5 study patients (8.9%) in the lonapegsomatropin 
and somatropin arms, respectively, recorded a QTcF change >30 msec. A comparable trend was observed in 
study CT-004 performed with ACP-001 (predecessor molecule to lonapegsomatropin). Notwithstanding the 
observed increase in QTc the actual QTc was – after 26 weeks treatment -well within the normal range (sex 
and age-corrected). 
There were no remarkable differences between the various age groups, genders, or regions regarding 
demographics, incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, or laboratory test results.  
Overall, transient positive results for anti-hGH binding antibodies were seen after baseline in 4.7% of the 
patients. In one patient, a boost in anti-hGH antibodies was observed. 
Treatment-emergent positive anti-lonapegsomatropin binding antibodies were reported for 4.0% of patients. 
Treatment-emergent, transient positive results for anti-mPEG binding antibodies were reported for 0.7% 
(safety pool II) and 1.9% (study CT301) of the patients. Antibodies against lonapegsomatropin were 
persistent in 6 subjects (2.0%). It was shown later that there is no evidence that these antibodies neutralize 
the clinical efficacy of lonapegsomatropin treatment.  
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with lonapegsomatropin. However, the 
pharmacodynamic interactions of lonapegsomatropin can be derived from literature. 
No discontinuations due to adverse events were reported. 
Overall, there were no unexpected clinical safety findings, including any renal, hepatic, immune, or 
neurologic signals, potentially attributable to PEG accumulation across the phase 3 clinical development 
program in children with GHD. 
The experience with 141 patients using the GH auto-injector for 30.9 weeks (range: 1-42 weeks) did not 
reveal serious or unexpected safety issues.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Additional expert consultations 
The Safety Working Party (SWP) and the Non-clinical Working Group (NcWG) of the PDCO were consulted 
regarding the potential safety risks of long-term mPEG exposure in paediatric GHD patients. A joint meeting 
was held in July 2021. 
Afterwards, a CHMP request for consultation to the Modelling and Simulation Working Party (MSWP) was 
adopted and the MSWP has provided an answer in September 2021.

General questions 
1. Has the overall view concerning the risk of PEG induced vacuolization and subsequent long-term safety 
concerns changed based on newly available preclinical information since the SWP response to the PDCO 
regarding the use of PEGylated drug products in the paediatric population (EMA/CHMP/SWP/6475258/2012)?  
In a recent joint SWP/NcWG meeting, an overview of the toxicity findings (i.e vacuolation in the ependymal 
cells of the choroid plexus) regarding the latest known pegylated products since 2012 was presented and 
discussed. At that meeting it was concluded that “The recent collected data could be used to update the SWP 
response of 2012 and provide meaningful information for a more harmonised approach in the evaluation of 
pegylated products.” (SWP/NcWG minutes, 2020, Bonn).  
More specifically, the following conditions for the occurrence of vacuolisations, as described in the SWP 
response to PDCO (2012), could likely benefit from an update: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
cynomolgus monkeys as sole test species 
size of PEG moiety ≥ 40kDa 
study duration ≥ 6 weeks 
threshold for CP vacuolation at PEG exposure of ≥ 0.4 µmol/kg/month 
Since then, PEG-related vacuolations have been observed in other species, with smaller PEG moieties <40 
kDa, in studies with a duration shorter than 6 weeks and with a lower monthly PEG exposure than 0.4 
µmol/kg/month. 
The non-clinical data for PEGylated products causing vacuolations continue to support a lack of adverse 
(neurologic or other) clinical signs and effects on CNS development related to these vacuolations or PEG 
exposure, even at supra-therapeutical dose levels. 
At the same SWP/NcWG meeting, it was however also reiterated that “No new evidence regarding the 
mechanism of formation of vacuolation has been generated since 2012 and there is a need to have more 
clinical data to establish the clinical relevance of these findings.” (SWP/NcWG minutes, 2020, Bonn). 
If no,  
2. Which toxicological manifestations (i.e. signs and symptoms) might be expected following long-term PEG 
exposure in children and/or adolescents and/or adults, especially with respect to the central nervous system, 
kidney, liver and immune system in case of possible accumulation of PEG?  Are the manifestations, if any, 
expected to be age-dependent? 
In the non-clinical studies available to date, findings were limited to histopathological evidence of PEG 
containing macrophages and vacuoles among others at the level of the choroid plexus, kidney, spleen and 
lymph nodes. Depending on the localization, vacuoles can persist even after a long period of recovery. 
Although cellular changes may adversely affect the function of the cells [redacted – non-public details on 
specific product], and thereby organ functioning, functional PEG-related effects have not been observed in 
any of the studies. The clinical impact in children and adults remains unknown. 
Whereas the observed vacuolations are not considered age-dependent – vacuolations have been observed in 
adult and juvenile animals - a thorough risk assessment for use of pegylated products is needed before 
allowing chronic use in young children in view of the immature status of the CNS, the role of the choroid 
plexus in CNS homeostasis and the increased potential for accumulation in case of life-long use.

There is no biological rationale for differentiating between children above or below a certain age cut-off. The 
choroid plexus is fully developed before birth (Dziegielewska 2001, Liddelow 2015, Lun 2015). Also, the BBB 
and B-CSF-B are developed in the targeted paediatric population from 6 months onwards. 
Specific questions on lonapegsomatropin;  
3. Are there any valid reasons to consider that the elaborations above with respect to PEG induced 
vacuolization do not apply to lonapegsomatropin (which contains 40 kDa mPEG)?  
The experts consider that the conclusions on PEG vacuolation are applicable to Lonapegsomatropin too. 
Uptake of mPEG via somatropin receptor-mediated uptake does not take place, differentiating 
lonapegsomatropin from other PEGylated biopharmaceuticals that may undergo receptor-mediated uptake, 
via receptor binding of the active moiety, and thereby co-transport of PEG into the cell. 
However, in view of the occurrence of vacuolation in the CP in animal studies for this product and the 
observation that non-drug bound PEG can also result in CP vacuolation, a risk assessment for 
lonapegsomatropin as for other PEGylated products before authorizing chronic use in children is equally 
justified. 
This concerns a branched chain 4 x 10 kDa PEG, and thus in terms of conformation distinct from linear 40 
kDa PEG or banched 2x20 kDa PEG. The exact impact of the PEG conformation and size on the threshold for 
vacuolation is yet unknown. To our knowledge, PEG-related vacuoles have been observed with different types 
of PEG structures and sizes down to 2 kDa. 
4. Taking into consideration the available non-clinical (and lack of clinical) information, especially the fact 
that the mPEG concentration during lonapegsomatropin treatment remains below the 0.4 µmol/kg/month, do 
the experts agree with the non-clinical assessment of lonapegsomatropin and conclusions regarding an 
expected negligible effect on long term safety in paediatric GHD patients (potentially treated for up to 15 
years)?  
If no;  
a. Can these long-term safety issues be (partially) addressed non-clinically, and would an optimized animal 
PK (PD) -model be of help to assess the clinical relevance of non-clinical observations for humans?  
b. Which biomarkers, functional testing or even medical imaging, could be assessed to prevent/minimalize 
potential safety consequences of mPEG accumulation in paediatric GHD patients? 
The experts agree with the non-clinical assessment of Lonapegsomatropin. 
Reference is made to the NcWG advice for the paediatric investigation plan for lonapegsomatropin (EMEA-
002692-PIP01-19), concluding that the overall risk in this case was considered to be low. 
The most important arguments for reaching that conclusion were: 
• 
The availability of a comprehensive non-clinical package including a ‘long-term’ (52-week) monkey 
study using juvenile animals. Evaluation of PEG vacuoles was performed with a sensitive staining 
Assessment report

method. In addition, mPEG in the CSF was quantified and the study included detailed clinical CNS 
observations12. 
• 
The absence of adverse clinical signs, including tremors, in either rat or monkey studies. 
•  Although the expected vacuolation in CP epithelial cells has been observed in the NC studies with 
lonapegsomatropin, the vacuoles were small and the integrity of the cells was unaffected (no 
evidence of distortion of cytoplasmic or nuclear compartments, degeneration, necrosis or 
inflammation), even at supra-therapeutical dose levels. As a consequence, these vacuoles are 
unlikely to impact cell or organ function. 
• 
• 
• 
The applicant has demonstrated that the product does not undergo active transport across the blood-
CSF barrier (absence of mPEG in the CSF). 
The presence of a small safety margin between the dose of mPEG in the 52-week toxicity study in 
juvenile cynomolgus monkeys where no H&E stain vacuoles were seen (800 µg mPEG/kg/week) and 
the mPEG dose at the clinical therapeutic dose level of 0.24 mg hGH/kg/week (480 µg 
mPEG/kg/week) 
The exposure margin of 7.7 between the measured steady state mPEG concentrations in children (13 
µg/mL, age range: 1.2 - 17.4 years) administered lonapegsomatropin as part of the extension trial, 
CT-301EXT, relative to the mPEG exposure/vacuolation threshold of 100 μg/mL (Jacobsen and 
Bjørnsdottir, 2017). Of interest, steady state mPEG levels for the 4 children below the age of 3 years 
were found to be comparable to the overall population and ranged between 2.4 and 13.4 μg/mL. 
4a. Cf. NcWG advice for the paediatric investigation plan for lonapegsomatropin (EMEA-002692-PIP01-19). 
Additional non-clinical studies are not expected to generate any added value. In this regard, the experts 
agreed that a consultation of MsWP is considered most useful.  
4b. Question outside the scope of NcWG expertise.  
As part of previous discussions for other pegylated compounds, applicants have consistently responded that 
there are no markers for PEG accumulation in the choroid plexus or choroid plexus functioning. Input from 
clinical experts could be obtained regarding the sensitivity and feasibility of e.g. CNS imaging.  
SWP and the NcWG of PDCO discussed whether new methodologies, such as metabolomics, might have 
added value for the detection of new biomarkers. This is not a formal request in the context of the current 
procedure. However, input from the Applicant on the feasibility of using metabolomics to detect new 
biomarkers which are linked to the dysregulation of the choroid plexus and CNS homeostasis might reveal 
new possibilities for biomarkers with added value for future assessments of pegylated products.  
Modelling and simulation working party (MSWP) 
1. Is the semi-physiologically based PK MODHGH001 study to the MSWP’s opinion suitable for estimation of 
the mPEG exposure in human, as concluded by the Applicant, in light of the above-mentioned preclinical 
margin? 
12 Detailed clinical observations intended to detect pharmacological or toxicological side effects. Often, these observations are timed 
in relation to time of administration: prior to and just after administration, a couple of hours later etc. They generally consist of cage 
observations, handling observations, and observations of reaction to manipulation.

The MSWP acknowledged that the Applicant has made a serious effort to predict the mPEG exposure in 
human choroid plexus. However, the concentration predictions (i.e. PK model) relies on multiple assumptions 
such as: a) biodistribution between serum and choroid plexus is the same across species as in rats 
(allometrically scaled), b) pharmacokinetics of mPEG and PEG40(N9-GP) are scalable all species, and c) the 
formation of vacuoles are similar across species. In the absence of data, it is important to highlight that the 
underlying assumptions of the modelling exercise can never be verified and therefore uncertainties will 
remain. Thus, although mPEG concentrations in human serum is sufficiently well captured, the predictions of 
human mPEG concentrations in choroid plexus should be interpreted with caution. 
2. Previously, the MSWP concluded: “the predicted CP/CSF concentrations are not reliable and should not 
even be considered as supportive evidence in combination with the safety data”. Is the MSWP of the opinion 
that – in the light of the additional information – the PK MODHGH001 study can be considered sufficiently 
reliable to substantiate the safety profile of product in terms of mPEG exposure? 
Given the model assumptions mentioned in response to question 1, the opinion of MSWP is that the predicted 
human mPEG concentrations in choroid plexus should be interpreted with strong caution. The MSWP 
considers the current modelling analyses at best supportive for the hypothesis that mPEG levels in the human 
choroid plexus are non-toxic with respect to vacuolization as the model is mainly based on theoretical 
considerations and no data to verify the assumptions are available. Realizing that, without new data, 
uncertainties on the model assumptions will remain, the Applicant can only increase confidence in the model 
by collecting additional data on the pharmacokinetics of mPEG in the choroid plexus in different species. In 
addition, the Applicant could consider developing a PBPK model that may provide more granularity on the PK 
processes involved in the distribution to the CP. This exercise will be quite elaborative since in addition to 
using a standard PBPK software the Applicant will need to conduct literature research on systems data related 
to PK in CP. Uncertainties will however always remain as the choroid plexus mPEG concentration cannot be 
determined in paediatrics and therefore the final decision should be made on the totality of evidence.    
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
Paediatric GHD patients have been included in submitted studies. The safety data from these studies have 
been discussed above. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety  
The safety profile of somatropin within lonapegsomatropin across the phase 3 program was consistent with 
that of daily somatropin products evaluated in a clinical study setting. The safety risks associated with long-
term exposure of long-acting growth hormone lonapegsomatropin in GHD patients aged 6 months and above 
are unclear.  
The indications of several PEGylated medicinal products are limited to patients aged 12 years and above due 
to uncertainties concerning the long-term safety risks of mPEG exposure. Considering lonapegsomatropin is 
transiently pegylated, mPEG clearance is expected to be faster with lonapegsomatropin compared to 
permanently PEGylated compounds for long-term use.  
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 121/142 
 
 
 
 
 
At present, there is no clear evidence that the risk of mPEG accumulation in choroid plexus in paediatric GHD 
patients aged from 3 to 12 years is higher than in older children during short-term lonapegsomatropin 
treatment.  
In addition, observed non-clinical and clinical data on therapeutic lonapegsomatropin doses thus far do not 
indicate increased safety risks in animals and paediatric GHD patients aged 3-12 years. 
A PASS is planned to evaluate the occurrence of potential long-term safety risks such as the occurrence of 
diabetes mellitus type 2, malignancies, and adverse events due to long-term (i.e. 10 years and beyond) 
exposure to long-acting somatropin and mPEG associated with lonapegsomatropin. 
The planned PASS will provide more insight into the combined long-term safety risks of long-acting 
somatropin and mPEG with lonapegsomatropin in paediatric GHD patients.

Routine risk minimisation measures: 
According to section 4.2 of the SmPC, treatment should be initiated and 
monitored by physicians who are qualified and experienced in the diagnosis 
and management of paediatric patients with GHD. The amount and 
concentration of lonapegsomatropin is always expressed in terms of mg 
somatropin referring to the content of the somatropin moiety and not 
including mPEG-linker in order to prevent medication errors when patients 
switch from daily somatropin therapy. The posology and administration 
should be individualised for each patient. The recommended starting dose of 
“TRADENAME” is 0.24 mg somatropin/kg body weight, given once weekly. 
“TRADENAME” is intended to be administered after reconstitution of the 
powder for solution for injection with the enclosed solvent. “TRADENAME” 
should be administered by means of the GH Auto-Injector. The patient and 
caregiver should receive training to ensure understanding of the 
administration procedure by means of the device in order to be allowed to 
(self)-inject lonapegsomatropin.

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 25.08.2021. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points.

applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
Regarding the omission of particulars on the cartridge label, the Group considered the invented name as an 
important aspect to be stated on the label and should be displayed.  
Given the space constraints on the DDC label and the technical problems to increase the size of the label 
without compromising the performance of the combination product with the device, the QRD group 
exceptionally endorsed the use of “injection” as a linked term to the combined pharmaceutical dose form 
“powder and solvent for solution for injection”. EDQM was also consulted on the matter. 
Regarding expression of strength/INN, the Group agreed that there should be alignment on the expression of 
the strength with the INN. Medication errors have been reported when the INN does not correlate with the 
quantity declared in the strength. Section 2 of the SmPC and Annex IIIA should include information on the 
equivalence and interchangeability between pro-drugs and active moiety. 
The MAH has requested the omission of the pharmaceutical form from the DDC label. However, “injection” is 
displayed on the DDC label as a linked term to the combined pharmaceutical dose form “powder and solvent 
for solution for injection”.  
The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included in the 
Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, and translated in all languages but will appear in grey-
shaded to show that they will not be included on the printed materials.  
2.9.3.  Additional monitoring  
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Lonapegsomatropin Ascendis Pharma 
(lonapegsomatropin) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, 
on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context  
3.1.1.  Disease or condition  
Lonapegsomatropin is proposed for growth failure in children and adolescents aged from 3 years up 
to 18 years due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone (growth hormone deficiency or GHD).  
Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is characterised by too low systemic levels of growth hormone. Growth 
hormone (GH) is produced by the somatotroph cells of the anterior pituitary gland. The secretion of growth 
hormone from the pituitary gland is stimulated by growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and inhibited 
by somatostatin, both produced by the hypothalamus. Therefore, growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is often 
associated with defects in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus.  
The typical symptom of GHD in children is growth failure. Growth failure is suspected if the growth of 
paediatric subjects develops at a slower rate than expected based on the growth chart of the local geographic 
area. In this case, further diagnostic evaluations can be considered to find the cause of the growth failure.13 
The incidence of growth failure associated with GHD has been estimated to be approximately 1:4000 to 
1:10,000.14,15 Once GHD is diagnosed, the aim of growth hormone treatment is to normalise the growth rate 
during childhood and attainment of normal adult height.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need  
Available therapies 
The aim of GHD treatment is the normalization of the growth rate during childhood and attainment of normal 
adult height. The effects of human growth hormone replacement in children can be evaluated by assessing 
the increase in height velocity and related auxological parameters as well as bone maturation. For over 30 
years, GHD has been treated with daily recombinant human growth hormone. Examples of such medicinal 
products concern Omnitrope (EU/1/06/332) and Nutropin Aq (EU/1/00/164). Weekly growth hormone 
treatment is available for the treatment of adult GHD (Sogroya (EU/1/20/1501)). 
With current treatment algorithms paediatric recombinant human growth hormone doses are based on the 
body weight of the growing child which corrects for the higher physiological need for growth hormone during 
growth compared to adults. IGF-I plasma concentrations should be maintained in the normal age and sex-
adjusted range for safety reasons. Periodic checks of IGF-I levels are required because they may increase 
over time, even if the growth hormone dosage does not change. 
Unmet medical need 
While daily human growth hormone is both safe and effective, its frequency of administration can be

burdensome for both paediatric population and their caregivers. Although children with GHD treated with 
daily growth hormone replacement have the potential to achieve normal adult height, real-world outcomes 
have not matched expectations. Due to nonadherence rates ranging from 5 to 82% (Fisher 2013), most do 
not reach their target genetic height (Guyda 1999, Lustig 2004), leaving an opportunity to improve treatment 
outcomes in paediatric GHD. 
While there are multiple therapeutic goals of human growth hormone therapy in treating GHD, including 
achievement of normal growth patterns, lean/fat body composition, bone mass, glucose homeostasis, 
cognition and improved quality of life, the most readily measured indicator of efficacy is linear growth 
according to the applicant.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies  
In 26-week Phase 2 multicentre, randomized, open-label dose-finding study CT-004, the clinical effects of 
three different dosages (0.14 (n= 12), 0.21 (n= 14), and 0.30 (n= 14) mg/kg/week) of weekly ACP-001, a 
predecessor of lonapegsomatropin, have been compared with those of daily administration of somatropin 
product Genotropin at a dosage of 0.21 mg/kg/week (n=13) in 53 pre-pubertal paediatric GHD patients aged 
3-12 years in Tanner stage I. Included study patients were naïve to growth hormone treatment. 
In 52-week pivotal Phase 3 multicentre, randomized, open-label study CT-301, the clinical effects of weekly 
lonapegsomatropin (n= 105) and daily somatropin product Genotropin (n= 56), both at a total weekly 
dosage of 0.21 mg/kg/week were compared in 161 pre-pubertal paediatric GHD patients aged 3-12 years in 
Tanner stage I. Included study patients were naïve to growth hormone treatment. 
In 26-week Phase 3 multicentre, single-arm, open-label study CT-302, the clinical effects of 
lonapegsomatropin were evaluated in 146 paediatric GHD patients aged 6 months up to 18 years. The vast 
majority (97.9%) of included study patients had received prior daily growth hormone treatment.  
GHD study patients who had completed study CT-301 or CT-302 were eligible to enrol in Phase 3 multicentre, 
long-term, single-arm open-label study CT-301EXT. In an ongoing study CT-301EXT, all included study 
patients received lonapegsomatropin at a dosage of 0.21 mg/kg/week. At the data cut-off date of 01 JUN 
2020, 298 study patients had been included in study CT-301EXT.  
In the conducted studies, study treatment was administered subcutaneously by means of a syringe with 
needle. In 46 study patients in study CT-301EXT lonapegsomatropin was not only administered by means of 
a syringe with needle but also by means of a dual chamber cartridge and growth hormone auto-injector 
combination product in order to evaluate safety and ease of use of the latter product. 
Efficacy across studies was evaluated in two pools: 
• 
• 
Efficacy pool I: a longitudinal review of a treatment-naïve study population that received 
lonapegsomatropin or somatropin in study CT-301 and subsequently lonapegsomatropin in study CT-
301EXT. Study patients in this pool were randomized and received at least one dose of study treatment 
in study CT-301. 
Efficacy pool II: a pooled review of efficacy data in study CT-301EXT in study patients who had 
received treatment with somatropin product Genotropin in study CT-301, and study patients in study CT-
302 who had received prior somatropin treatment.

3.2.  Favourable effects  
Annualized height velocity, height SDS, and IGF-I SDS increased upon initiation of lonapegsomatropin 
treatment in paediatric GHD patients who were naïve or non-naïve to lonapegsomatropin treatment. 
Annualized height velocity. In pivotal study CT-301, mean height velocity at baseline for both 
lonapegsomatropin (n= 105) and somatropin (n= 56) treated paediatric GHD patients was 3.93 cm/year. At 
week 52, the mean annualized height velocity for lonapegsomatropin (10.90 cm/year) was higher than that 
of somatropin (10.22 cm/year) (LS means respectively 11.2 and 10.3; difference in LS means 0.86 (95% CI: 
0.22 – 1.50); p= 0.009). Non-inferiority and subsequently statistical superiority of lonapegsomatropin above 
somatropin were demonstrated. Clinical effects of lonapegsomatropin were more pronounced than those of 
somatropin at all study visits. Differences were observed from week 26 onwards.  
After inclusion in study CT-301EXT after completing study CT-301, mean annualized height velocities at week 
78 were similar for study patients who had received lonapegsomatropin (9.4 cm/year) and somatropin (9.3 
cm/year) in study CT-301. 
In study CT-302, the LS mean of the annualized height velocity at week 26 was 8.72 (95% CI 8.24- 9.20). A 
comparable annualized height velocity was observed at week 52 (LS mean 8.36 cm/year) in efficacy pool II. 
Height SDS. In pivotal study CT-301, mean height at baseline for lonapegsomatropin (n= 105) and 
somatropin (n= 56) treated paediatric GHD patients were respectively 112.9 and 112.2 cm. Mean height SDS 
at baseline for these study treatments was respectively -2.89 and -3.00. Height SDS increased progressively 
for both lonapegsomatropin and somatropin treatment during study CT-301. Increases in height SDS were 
larger for GHD study patients treated with lonapegsomatropin compared to those treated with somatropin. 
Observed differences were statistically significant from week 26 onwards. At week 52, the estimated 
treatment difference expressed in LS mean for the difference in height SDS between lonapegsomatropin (LS 
mean 1.10) and somatropin (LS mean 0.96) was 0.14 (95% CI: 0.03-0.26) (p= 0.01). 
Study patients treated with lonapegsomatropin in study CT-301 achieved a LS mean (SE) increase in height 
SDS at week 78 of 1.39 (0.05) compared with 1.24 (0.06) for study patients treated with somatropin in study 
CT-301 (p = 0.0436). Thus, the treatment difference (initial lonapegsomatropin minus initial somatropin) 
from week 52 (0.14) was maintained at week 78 (0.15).  
Study patients switching from somatropin to lonapegsomatropin followed the same growth speed of those 
originally randomized to lonapegsomatropin, with an increase of approximately 0.29 height SDS from week 
52 to week 78 (1.10 to 1.39 for continuous lonapegsomatropin vs 0.96 to 1.24 for a switch to 
lonapegsomatropin). 
In study CT-302, the mean difference between a subject’s height SDS and the average parental height SDS 
was -1.14. This difference decreased upon lonapegsomatropin treatment. After 52 weeks, height SDS was 
improved by a mean (SD) 0.51 (0.33). 
In efficacy pool II, the change from baseline in height SDS increased consistently with time (LS mean week 
13: 0.14, LS mean week 52: 0.45). 
IGF-I SDS. In pivotal study CT-301, mean IGF-I SDS at baseline for lonapegsomatropin (n= 105) and 
somatropin (n= 56) treated paediatric GHD patients was respectively -2.08 and -1.96. IGF-I SDS increased 
progressively for both lonapegsomatropin and somatropin treatment during study CT-301. Increases in IGF-I 
SDS tended to be larger for GHD study patients treated with lonapegsomatropin compared to those treated 
with somatropin. Observed differences were statistically significant from week 13 onwards. At week 52, the 
Assessment report

estimated treatment difference expressed in LS mean for the difference in IGF-I SDS between 
lonapegsomatropin (LS mean 0.72) and somatropin (LS mean -0.02) was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.49-1.00) (p 
<0.0001). 
Beyond 52 weeks, for study patients continuing lonapegsomatropin treatment from study CT-301, IGF-I SDS 
values generally remained stable without further increase. For study patients switching from somatropin 
treatment in study CT-301 to lonapegsomatropin treatment in study CT-301EXT, an initial increase in IGF-I 
SDS values with subsequent stabilization was observed. At week 78, IGF-I SDS levels of both groups were in 
the upper normal range, i.e. between 0 and +2. 
In study CT-302, mean IGF-I SDS level at baseline was 0.85. After initiation of lonapegsomatropin treatment 
a LS mean of 1.65 (95% CI 1.43- 1.86) was observed at week 26. 
In efficacy pool II, the average IGF-I SDS level remained elevated above pre-treatment levels (≤ 0.9 SDS) 
and was stable in the IGF-I SDS range between 0 and +2 over time. The trend for the IGFBP-3 SDS in 
efficacy pool II mirrored that of the IGF-I SDS. 
Compliance. In pivotal study CT-301 the compliance was between >95% and ≤100% for nearly all subjects 
(lonapegsomatropin: 104 subjects [99.0%], somatropin: 53 subjects [94.6%]).  
Mean treatment compliance to lonapegsomatropin treatment in study CT-302 (n= 146) was 98.4%. 
Bone age. In efficacy pool I the mean (SD) change in bone age at week 52 was 1.4 (0.9) years for study 
patients treated with lonapegsomatropin and 1.4 (0.7) years for study patients treated with somatropin. At 
week 104, the change in bone age was 2.6 years for both study patients continuously treated with 
lonapegsomatropin and study patients treated with somatropin followed by lonapegsomatropin. 
Patient/parent reported outcomes 
Treatment preference. A consistent preference for once-weekly lonapegsomatropin relative to daily 
somatropin treatment was reported by children and parents at week 6 and 13 in studies CT-302 and CT-
301EXT. This preference increased upon continued lonapegsomatropin treatment. 
The treatment burden as evaluated by the Child Sheehan Disability Scores for both the paediatric study 
patients and (their) parents decreased from baseline in study patients treated with lonapegsomatropin in 
studies CT-302 and CT-301EXT. This also applies to study patients who used the dual chamber cartridge and 
growth hormone auto-injector combination product in study CT-301EXT. 
Convenience and satisfaction were evaluated among parents of all study patients in study CT-302, in 
study CT-301EXT among parents of study patients who received somatropin in study CT-301, and among 
parents of study patients who switched to the growth hormone auto-injector in study CT-301EXT. In all these 
groups, evaluated study treatments were considered convenient (≥ 69) and satisfactory (≥ 80). Available 
data indicate that the use of the dual-chamber cartridge and growth hormone-auto injector combination 
product was safe in the majority of study patients. 
In summary, the clinical effects of weekly lonapegsomatropin with respect to growth-related parameters (i.e. 
annualized height velocity, change in height SDS compared to baseline, IGF-I SDS levels) were statistically 
larger than those of daily somatropin in pivotal study CT-301. The results from supportive studies indicate 
that lonapegsomatropin also promotes growth in paediatric GHD patients who have received prior somatropin 
treatment. Growth was maintained in GHD patients irrespective of whether they were naïve to growth 
hormone treatment. The efficacy of lonapegsomatropin was also supported by several patient/reported 
outcomes.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects  
Although the superiority of lonapegsomatropin over somatropin was demonstrated statistically, it was not 
demonstrated clinically. Indeed, the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (0.22, 1.50) is inferior to 
the +2 cm limit of non-inferiority. 
The male predominance among paediatric GHD patients is well-known with an almost 2:1 male to female 
ratio.16 This male preponderance was even higher in submitted studies. Therefore, the 78.8% male patients 
in safety pool II and the 81.9% male patients in study CT-301 might induce some bias. The potential impact 
of bias on the overall results due the preponderance of male paediatric GHD patients was evaluated. The 
impact of the male preponderance on obtained results and the recommended lonapegsomatropin doses is still 
unclear.  
The results on key efficacy endpoints indicate similar responses to study treatment in children of both sexes. 
However, as men are more sensitive to growth hormone treatment, an increasing sensitivity to growth 
hormone (expressed as change in IGF-I per growth hormone dose) over time may be observed, particularly 
in boys and could lead to safety concerns. It is unclear whether there were more dose adjustments in boys 
than girls during the conducted clinical studies.  
A limited number of GHD patients under 3 years of age (n= 4) were included in submitted clinical studies. 
Based on submitted graphical data, observed effect sizes with respect to growth parameters tended to be 
larger compared to paediatric GHD patients aged 3 up to 18 years and above. Considering 
lonapegsomatropin dosing per body weight was similar for all paediatric GHD patients, younger paediatric 
GHD patients tend to be more sensitive to lonapegsomatropin compared to older GHD patients. 
In dose-finding study CT-004, the annualized height velocity (mean 11.93 vs 11.64 cm/year), the difference 
in height SDS compared to baseline (0.68 vs. 0.62), and the proportions of study patients with IGF-I SDS 
levels in the range -2 up to +2 (81.8 vs. 76.9%) were comparable for ACP-001 at a dosage of 0.14 mg 
growth hormone/kg/week and somatropin at a dosage of 0.21 mg growth hormone/kg/week. The applicant, 
however, considered the clinical effects of ACP-001 and somatropin comparable at a dosage of 0.21 mg 
growth hormone/kg/week. Based on this, lonapegsomatropin at a growth hormone dosage of 0.24 mg growth 
hormone/kg/week was chosen for further clinical development. The clinical effects of a lower somatropin 
growth hormone dosage for lonapegsomatropin have not been evaluated. Respective effects remain therefore 
unknown. However, the applicant’s choice for a different dosing regimen is acknowledged, although the 
chosen somatropin dosage for lonapegsomatropin corresponds to the maximal recommended dose for the 
treatment of GHD in the somatropin based medicines which have a marketing authorization currently.  
Observed IGF-I SDS levels tended to be higher for lonapegsomatropin as compared to those of somatropin in 
pivotal study CT-301, while both study treatments were administered at a total weekly dose of 0.24 
mg/kg/week. The implications of supratherapeutic IGF-I SDS levels on the long-term clinical effects of 
lonapegsomatropin are yet unclear.  
The proportions of GHD study patients with IGF-I SDS levels above +2 upon lonapegsomatropin treatment 
tended to be lower in study CT-301 (7.6%) as compared to extension study CT-301EXT (48.6%) and study 
CT-302 (56.8%). The fact that monitoring of IGF-I SDS levels was more deliberate in studies CT-301EXT and 
CT-302 as compared to CT-301 may partially explain these findings. Hence, regular monitoring and potential

dose adjustments based on IGF-I SDS levels during lonapegsomatropin treatment appear to be important to 
achieve appropriate IGF-I SDS levels.  
The study patient/parents reported outcomes were in favour of lonapegsomatropin treatment in study CT-
302. Administration of lonapegsomatropin by a dual-chamber cartridge and growth hormone auto-injector 
device was also considered acceptable. If patients and their parents were kept blinded for the received study 
treatment, observed results might have been more favourable. 
Blinding was not appropriately reported in study CT-301. The fact that the primary endpoint measurement is 
objective did not exempt the applicant from making an accurate reporting of these unanticipated unblinding 
situations. This would have helped to better apprehend the level of bias in study CT-301.  
Study data of study CT-301EXT have been presented until the data cut-off of 01 June 2020. It is unclear 
which final heights can be achieved upon long-term lonapegsomatropin treatment in paediatric GHD patients 
and whether these final heights are appropriate. This will be evaluated in a PASS. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects  
A total of 378 individuals (305 children with GHD and 73 healthy adult subjects) have been exposed to at 
least 1 dose of lonapegsomatropin. Of the 305 children included in the clinical programme, 252 were exposed 
to Lonapegsomatropin for more than one year. Further, 44 patients had a follow-up of ≥2 years. The mean 
exposure (SD) was 70.2 (25.2) weeks.  
Overall, 26 subjects (8.5%) experienced treatment-related emergent adverse events. Commonly reported 
(≥2 subjects overall) treatment-related emergent adverse events were secondary hypothyroidism (2.6%), 
headache (2.0%), increased IGF-I (1.3%), and growing pains and injection site atrophy (0.7% each).  
There have been no deaths reported in the clinical development program for lonapegsomatropin. 
Serious adverse events were experienced by 7 subjects (2.3%) overall; none of the serious adverse events 
were considered related to the study drug by the investigator. Subjects experienced serious adverse events 
of epilepsy (including generalized tonic-clonic seizure; N=2), pyrexia (N=1), gastrointestinal viral infection 
(N=1), vomiting (N=1), adenoidal hypertrophy (N=1), and rash (N=1). None of these serious adverse events 
was assessed by the investigator as related to the study drug or resulted in changes in study drug dose. 
Although there were occasional excursions for individual subjects, the mean and median values of all 
haematology, chemistry, lipid panel and hormone and glycaemic parameters remained within the reference 
ranges at all time points. 
No remarkable findings for vital signs (weight, BMI, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart 
rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature) or during physical examination (except for those observations 
related to infections and growth hormone treatment) were noted with lonapegsomatropin therapy in the 
clinical program. None of the subjects with abnormal findings had any signs of intracranial hypertension. 
In comparison with somatropin (study CT-301) the incidence reported 15 minutes after the administration of 
subjects was greater in the lonapegsomatropin group (redness (20% vs 3.6%), swelling (5.7% vs 0.0%), or 
other injection-related symptoms (1.0% vs 0.0%)). The incidence of bruising was comparable between both 
arms. In the open-label study (study CT-302) 15 minutes after the administration subjects reported 
symptoms of redness (47.3%), swelling (12.3%) or pain (3.5%). In the lonapegsomatropin treated patients 
reporting of injection-related symptoms decreased over subsequent weeks. Injection side atrophy was

EMA/706519/2021 
Page 132/142 
 
 
 
mentioned for 3 patients (of the 305 in the pool). In one patient, the atrophy resolved. In the somatropin 
group, injection site atrophy was not reported.  
Dose reductions were mostly due to high IGF-I levels. In 1 subject, this was temporary. In 3 subjects the 
dose was reduced for the remainder of the study. Two subjects had their dose of study drug reduced due to 
headache. Temporarily dose reductions were due to coxitis, abdominal pain and viral gastroenteritis. One 
subject had a dose reduction while on somatropin treatment. The dose was reduced due to facial oedema.  
In study CT-301 a QTcF change >60 msec is observed in one patient during lonapegsomatropin treatment, 
and a total of 14 subjects (13.3%) and 5 subjects (8.9%) in the lonapegsomatropin and somatropin arms, 
respectively, recorded a QTcF change >30 msec. A comparable trend was observed in study CT-004 
performed with ACP-001 (predecessor molecule to lonapegsomatropin). Notwithstanding the observed 
increase in QTc the actual QTc was – after 26 weeks of treatment -well within the normal range (sex and 
age-corrected). 
There were no remarkable differences between the various age groups, genders or regions with respect to 
demographics, incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, or laboratory test results. 
Overall, transient positive results for anti-growth hormone-binding antibodies were seen after baseline in 
4.3% to 6.7% of the patients. In 2 patients, a boost in anti-growth hormone antibodies was observed. 
Treatment-emergent positive anti-lonapegsomatropin binding antibodies were reported for 3.6% - 3.8% of 
the patients. Antibodies were persistent in 6 subjects, but respective antibodies were non-neutralising.  
Treatment-emergent, transient positive results for anti-mPEG binding antibodies were reported for 0.7% - 
1.9% of the patients. No clear and consistent effect was seen on some selected safety issues (injection site 
reactions, hypersensitivity).  
No discontinuations due to adverse events were reported. 
Overall, there were no unexpected clinical safety findings, including any renal, hepatic, immune, or 
neurologic signals, potentially attributable to PEG accumulation across the phase 3 clinical development 
program in children with GHD. 
The experience with 45 patients using the growth hormone auto-injector for 10.1 weeks (range: 6-14 weeks) 
did not reveal serious or unexpected safety issues.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects  
The number of patients (N=305) is limited for a safety database and does not fulfil the requirements of the 
ICH-E1 (at least 1500 patients exposed). However, somatropin itself is a well-known active substance, and 
the safety database is considered sufficient from this perspective to compare the safety profile with the 
known profile of growth hormone. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the long-term 
safety risks -i.e. for 10 years and beyond- of lonapegsomatropin, particular concerning the long-acting 
properties of lonapegsomatropin and the mPEG exposure associated with lonapegsomatropin. 
Somatropin dosing for lonapegsomatropin 
Somatropin dosing for lonapegsomatropin is targeted to achieve IGF-I SDS levels within the normal range 
between -2 and +2 (preferably close to 0 SDS) apart from clinical benefit. Though IGF-I SDS levels within 
this target range were achieved in the majority of study patients in conducted studies, the proportions of 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 133/142 
 
 
 
GHD study patients with IGF-I SDS levels above +2 increased with time, especially in the youngest non-naïve 
patients. This is of concern, since the safety risks of long-acting lonapegsomatropin (e.g. malignancies, 
diabetes mellitus type 2) are expected to be higher with higher IGF-I SDS levels. This underscores the 
importance of regular evaluation of paediatric GHD patients including IGF-I SDS levels, and somatropin dose 
adjustments based on such evaluations if necessary. Additional recommendations on somatropin starting 
doses with lonapegsomatropin, dose adjustments, and treatment monitoring have later been included in the 
product information according to IGF-I SDS levels and puberty status for naïve and non-naïve patients. The 
long-term safety risks associated with the long-acting lonapegsomatropin medicinal product will be evaluated 
in a PASS. 
mPEG exposure 
An uncertainty with respect to clinical safety is the theoretical vacuolisation of mPEG in cells of the choroid 
plexus (CP) based on non-clinical observations. At 6.7 times the human dose of mPEG, a slight vacuolisation 
was seen in the CP-cells of juvenile cynomolgus monkeys after 52 weeks of treatment with 
lonapegsomatropin. After a treatment-free period of 52 weeks, the vacuolisation was partly recovered. At 
higher doses, this vacuolisation expands to more cells and more vacuoles. In a recent paper, at a dose of 360 
times the human dose, alterations in tissue architecture that could potentially lead to dysfunction are shown 
in the CP of cynomolgus monkeys after three months of treatment (Fletcher, 2019). However, still no signs 
were shown in the behaviour of these animals. 
The applicant made it plausible that the vacuolisation is driven by a non-specific transport process 
(fenestrated capillaries) probably independent of human age, and as the choroid plexus anatomy and 
function are highly conserved, the distribution of mPEG between plasma and choroid plexus is expected to be 
comparable between species. Although the results of the popPK model used for prediction of mPEG levels in 
the choroid plexus in patients 3-12 years of age should be used with caution, the model suggests that 
steady-state (SS) for mPEG in the choroid plexus in GHD children may be reached, and the model-predicted 
median SS level of mPEG in the CP of GHD children at 0.24 mg hGH/kg/week was ~2-fold below the SS 
levels in CP of monkeys at the NOEL (0.4 mg/kg/week). Because a mild vacuolisation in cells is not an 
adverse effect in itself, and the exposure to mPEG in GHD children will probably be below the vacuolisation 
limit, the risk for adverse effects in children caused by vacuolation is regarded as minimal from a non-clinical 
viewpoint. 
Based on the provided information from literature, it can be agreed that mPEG distribution in/out the choroid 
plexus is most likely solely driven by non-specific mechanisms, some of the mechanisms requiring energy 
(active) some not (passive), but solely non-specific. It is agreed that these mechanisms are likely preserved 
over different species, in contrast to such specific transporters, which may be species-specific. Therefore, the 
assumption that the biodistribution coefficient for distribution of mPEG between serum and choroid plexus 
can in principle be extrapolated from one to another species is now considered acceptable, and this is 
assumed to apply in the provided popPK model intended for bridging of the preclinical safety data to the 
human situation. Although this consideration may reduce the chance that mPEG distribution from serum to 
choroid plexus in humans is completely different from that obtained in other species, and this appears 
numerically confirmed by the predictions from the popPK choroid plexus model, actual strength of the support 
for that assumption from the model is limited. Therefore, the risk of prolonged mPEG accumulation in the 
human CP may not formally be excluded, but it seems to be unlikely. 
Assessment report  
EMA/706519/2021 
Page 134/142 
 
 
 
 
Although there are still uncertainties on the extrapolation of the mPEG exposure from animals to human GHD 
patients, the non-clinical data with lonapegsomatropin are considered reassuring as no significant deleterious 
effects with lonapegsomatropin were observed in cynomolgous monkeys despite vacuolisation of choroid 
plexus cells upon mPEG exposure. Furthermore, no specific effects possibly related to the vacuolisation of 
mPEG in the choroid plexus were highlighted in animals and during the clinical studies in human paediatric 
GHD patients. Though there was a concern of mPEG accumulation upon long-term use of lonapegsomatropin, 
there is no clear evidence that the short-term risk of mPEG accumulation in the choroid plexus and other 
tissues and organs of human paediatric GHD patients aged 3 up to 12 years is higher than in older children.  
The applicant agreed to evaluate potential long-term safety risks of lonapegsomatropin in a PASS because of 
current uncertainties with respect to long-term clinical safety. Long-term safety risks that will be evaluated 
include safety risks due to mPEG exposure and somatropin within lonapegsomatropin.  
Lonapegsomatropin safety in subgroups 
The inclusion of paediatric patients <3 years of age is based on data from 4 patients, which is considered 
very limited. It is unclear whether the clinical safety of long-acting lonapegsomatropin is comparable for GHD 
patients under 3 years of age, and those aged 3-18 years. Of the four patients included in the clinical study 
under 3 years of age, all experienced IGF-I SDS levels above +2. Apart from this, lonapegsomatropin may 
only be administered in paediatric GHD patients weighing 11.5 kg or more due to device restrictions. In line 
with above issues, the applicant decided to restrict the indication to GHD patients aged 3 years and above. 
No studies were submitted in which the teratogenic effects and effects on the placenta of lonapegsomatropin 
have been evaluated. However, in a peri- and postnatal developmental study in rats, there were no adverse 
effects on the pregnant/lactating female or on development of the conceptus and the offspring following 
exposure of the female from implantation through weaning to doses up to 13-fold the clinical dose of 0.24 mg 
somatropin/kg/week. 
Other uncertainties 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with lonapegsomatropin. However, the 
pharmacodynamic interactions of lonapegsomatropin (i.e. growth hormone) can be derived from literature.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion  
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The typical symptom of GHD in children is growth failure, and consequently, the main aim of treatment is the 
normalization of the growth rate during childhood and attainment of normal adult height. The effects of 
growth hormone replacement in children can best be evaluated by assessing the increase in height velocity 
and related auxological parameters as well as bone maturation. 
The study results of conducted clinical studies support the efficacy of lonapegsomatropin in paediatric GHD 
patients. Results with respect to growth-related parameters were in line with each other, also across different 
studies. Lonapegsomatropin also promotes growth in paediatric GHD patients who have received prior 
somatropin treatment. Growth was maintained in GHD patients irrespective whether they were naïve to 
growth hormone treatment at baseline. Bone age was similar in study patients treated for one year with 
either lonapegsomatropin or somatropin. The efficacy of lonapegsomatropin was also supported by several 
patient/parent-reported outcomes. 
Altogether, the efficacy data provide robust evidence for the clinical efficacy of weekly lonapegsomatropin 
treatment in paediatric GHD patients. Practical guidance with respect to starting doses, dose titration, and 
treatment monitoring is available in the SmPC for treatment-naïve and non-naïve patients. 
Although the safety database is limited, the short-term safety profile of lonapegsomatropin across the Phase 
3 program was consistent with that of daily somatropin medicinal products evaluated in a clinical study 
setting. The overall occurrence of treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events (e.g. headache, 
injection site atrophy) was low (8.5% of subjects). The experience with the growth hormone auto-injector did 
not reveal serious or unexpected safety issues.  
Safety risks associated with long-term exposure in recommended somatropin doses for long-acting growth 
hormone lonapegsomatropin in paediatric GHD patients are unclear. Potential carcinogenic effects of growth 
hormone (and/or IGF-I), and possible induction of type 2 diabetes mellitus will be evaluated in the planned 
PASS. Respective evaluations are also important to further characterize the long-term safety profile -i.e. for 
10 years and beyond up to epiphyseal closure or growth plate fusion- of lonapegsomatropin in paediatric GHD 
patients. Since the safety concerns are based on the ongoing discussion in the scientific community 
(malignancies and type 2 diabetes mellitus) and non-clinical aspects (PEG related issues, see below), the 
PASS should be considered a category 3 PASS.  
The safety risks concern especially paediatric GHD patients under three years of age, since these patients are 
more responsive to the clinical effects of lonapegsomatropin. Of the four patients included in the clinical study 
under 3 years of age, all experienced IGF-I SDS levels above +2. This is of importance since the medical 
need in this population is not considered high. Treatment adherence to daily growth hormone injections is not 
an issue. In addition, the faster titration possibility with daily dosing is considered an advantage over weekly 
dosing in this vulnerable patient population. Apart from this, lonapegsomatropin may only be administered in 
paediatric GHD patients weighing 11.5 kg or more due to device restrictions. In line with above issues, the 
applicant decided to restrict the indication to GHD patients aged 3 years and above.

Concerning the potential safety risks of vacuolization and mPEG accumulation due to long-term mPEG 
exposure with lonapegsomatropin in GHD patients aged 3 up to 18 years, it should be noted that it seems to 
be highly unlikely that the observed vacuolisation in animals might result in any observable toxicity (at the 
exposure used in clinical studies) and that the current (short-term) safety information in children does not 
indicate any safety issues that could be attributed to mPEG. In a 1-year monkey study, the no observed 
effect level (NOEL) for vacuolisation in choroid plexus cells was found at 1.7 times the human dose (the effect 
is an adaptive response). In a 3-month study in monkeys (Fletcher et al, 2019), the no observed adverse 
effect level (NOAEL) was found at 260 times the human dose (exaggerated adaptive response or toxic effect 
was found at 356 times the human dose). Though it is not absolutely clear which level of exposure is relevant 
for the safety assessment for humans; the NOEL or the NOAEL, from a mechanistic point of view, it is 
considered sufficiently justified that in- and outward cellular mPEG transport occurs via non-specific 
mechanisms and is highly preserved over various species. This provides reassurance that the non-clinical 
lonapegsomatropin safety data are relevant for the human situation. The non-clinical data on 
lonapegsomatropin support that, next to the presence of an uptake mechanism, also excretion mechanisms 
are in place for mPEG. In addition, the presence of a dynamic equilibrium, i.e., uptake of mPEG by 
pinocytosis, is balanced by excretion by, e.g. exocytosis and cell turnover, even in a theoretical situation 
where uptake is against a concentration gradient also sufficiently supported by the provided non-clinical data. 
Therefore, at the expected exposure range obtained with lonapegsomatropin, no prolonged mPEG 
accumulation, to a level inducing vacuoles, is expected to occur in choroid plexus, liver or kidney. Also, the 
non-clinical mPEG related findings in CP epithelial cells do not worsen over time, following up to 2 years of 
continuous mPEG exposure, which supports a dynamic equilibrium that balances cellular uptake and 
elimination. 
The long-term implications of observed vacuolisation in cynomolgous monkeys triggered by mPEG exposure 
with lonapegsomatropin in paediatric GHD patients are from a clinical perspective unknown and need further 
evaluation in a PASS. In this context, previous regulatory discussions and conclusions concerning other 
PEGylated medicinal products about indications, applicable patient populations, and clinical safety of long-
term mPEG exposure need to be considered for the current marketing authorization application. PEG 
accumulation has been discussed thoroughly by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
and the Paediatric Committee (PDCO), as well as the Safety Working Party.  
The long-term safety risks of mPEG exposure with lonapegsomatropin may be higher in younger GHD 
patients since the time to closure of the epiphyses is longer in these patients. Alternative growth hormone 
medicinal products are available for paediatric patients under 12 years of age (e.g. Omnitrope 
(EU/1/06/332), and Nutropin Aq (EU/1/00/164)). Based on observed vacuolisation in choroid plexus cells in 
cynomolgus monkeys, there was a concern about potential safety risks due to vacuolisation and mPEG 
accumulation in choroid plexus cells and other tissues and organs in human GHD patients upon long-term 
mPEG exposure with lonapegsomatropin. Considering this concern, the applicant attempted to predict the 
choroid plexus mPEG levels in children 3-18 years of age, including those aged 3-12 years by means of a 
popPK model, in which mPEG choroid plexus exposure in children was predicted based on extrapolation of 
measured choroid plexus PEG levels in the rat and the known serum mPEG exposure leading to vacuolisation 
in the monkey. It is considered plausible that mPEG transport into the choroid plexus is mediated by non-
specific transport processes, a process which is conserved in the various species. Active transport of mPEG, 
when linked to lonapegsomatropin via e.g. the growth hormone receptor, seems unlikely since the 
somatropin part of lonapegsomatropin is shielded from this growth hormone receptor by mPEG. Though the 
popPK model may support the proposed extrapolation of the mPEG choroid plexus data in rats to humans, 
the outcome of the popPK model should be considered with caution since a number of assumptions

underlying the choroid plexus model cannot be confirmed. Though the actual steady state serum mPEG levels 
in children is well below the steady state serum levels leading to vacuolisation in monkeys, further relief of 
concerns towards the possibility of vacuolisation and mPEG accumulation based on comparison of predicted 
choroid plexus mPEG levels in the monkey and children is thus limited, but the possibility of prolonged mPEG 
accumulation in the choroid plexus and other tissues and organs is considered to be small. Vacuolisation and 
accumulation after mPEG exposure in different tissues and organs has not been evaluated specifically in 
human GHD patients. 
Considering the above, and based on additional expert consultations with SWP, the NcWP of the PDCO and 
MSWP, non-clinical observations with respect to mPEG exposure may in principle be extrapolated to 
paediatric GHD patients under 12 years of age, though the assumptions underlying this potential 
extrapolation cannot be verified based only on the PopPK modelling. Safety risks of long-term 
lonapegsomatropin exposure will be evaluated in a PASS.  
Transient positive results for anti-growth hormone-binding antibodies were observed in a limited proportion 
of study patients. Antibodies were persistent in some subjects, but a clear and consistent effect on height 
velocity was not observed. Currently, available data do not indicate increased safety risks compared to 
antibody formation upon exposure to other growth hormone medicinal products. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks  
Efficacy of once-weekly lonapegsomatropin has been demonstrated in paediatric GHD patients who are naïve 
or non-naïve to growth hormone treatment. Results with respect to different growth-related parameters were 
in line with each other, consistent over time, also across different studies, and non-inferior compared to 
somatropin. The treatment difference between lonapegsomatropin and somatropin with respect to the 
primary endpoint annualized height velocity was statistically significant in favour of lonapegsomatropin (p= 
0.088) but there was insufficient evidence for clinical superiority. Indeed, taking into account the differences 
in IGF-I SDS levels, there is insufficient evidence to conclude a therapeutic superiority of lonapegsomatropin 
over somatropin. The results of the clinical studies were in line with literature indicating that growth in 
paediatric GHD patients continues at a smaller, more constant rate after an initial catch-up growth in 
treatment- non-naïve paediatric GHD patients.17 
An improvement with respect to different patient/parent-reported outcomes was also demonstrated. The 
majority of GHD study patients preferred weekly lonapegsomatropin above daily somatropin treatment.  
From the limited population, the short-term safety profile of lonapegsomatropin appears to be in line with the 
known growth hormone-containing medicinal products. Injection site reactions, and antibody formation 
against lonapegsomatropin are the most important short-term safety risks.  
There is some uncertainty regarding the clinical consequences of potential vacuolization in the choroid plexus 
due to long-term mPEG exposure with lonapegsomatropin. The extent in which non-clinical data with respect 
to mPEG exposure in the choroid plexus can be extrapolated to paediatric GHD patients is unknown. The 
acceptable margin between the steady state serum mPEG levels in paediatric GHD patients and preclinical 
serum levels leading to vacuolisation cannot convincingly be translated to the choroid plexus by model-
predicted choroid plexus mPEG exposure in the monkey and children due to uncertainties towards the 
assumptions for the PopPK model. However, the assumed margin in serum exposure between animals and

human GHD patients and the fact that no indications regarding mPEG related safety issues are apparent 
during short-term follow-up in any part of the dossier, supports a positive benefit-risk balance in paediatric 
GHD patients aged 3-18 years of age, i.e. intended target population.  
Previously, pegylated medicinal products for long-term use were indicated in paediatric patients aged 12 
years and above. In this respect, an important observation in the case of lonapegsomatropin was that 
vacuolization in the choroid plexus of juvenile cynomolgus monkeys did not affect the cell integrity and was 
not associated with clinical signs and symptoms at multiple times the mPEG exposure for therapeutic doses of 
lonapegsomatropin. As part of these studies, the applicant has also argued that mPEG, either linked to 
somatropin or released, does not undergo specific active transport across the blood-cerebrospinal fluid 
barrier, but is transported via non-specific mechanisms. These non-specific transport mechanisms appear 
more conserved over species, thus increasing trust in the relevance of the preclinical mPEG toxicity data for 
the human situation. Further, the applicant, SWP, and NcWG of the PDCO indicated that the blood-brain 
barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier in humans are fully developed at an age of 6 months. In the 
conducted clinical studies in paediatric GHD patients, the clinical efficacy and safety of lonapegsomatropin 
were similar in younger and older paediatric GHD patients.  
Based on aforementioned discussion and available data, it is concluded that there is thus far no evidence for 
an increased risk of development of clinical signs and symptoms upon mPEG exposure and accumulation in 
the choroid plexus and other tissues and organs, at therapeutic doses of lonapegsomatropin in paediatric 
GHD patients, even in GHD patients under 12 years of age.  
No prolonged mPEG accumulation, to a level inducing vacuoles, is expected to occur in the choroid plexus, 
liver or kidney. Although the risk of prolonged mPEG accumulation in the human CP seems to be unlikely, this 
risk will be closely followed in the PASS.  
The totality of evidence supports a positive benefit/risk balance in paediatric GHD patients aged 3-18 years. 
The long-term clinical effects of lonapegsomatropin treatment in paediatric GHD patients aged 3-18 years will 
be further evaluated in a PASS. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance  
Somapacitan medicinal product Sogroya (EU/1/20/1501) is indicated for the replacement of endogenous 
growth hormone in adults with GHD. Long-term safety risks of somapacitan are to be evaluated in a PASS. 
Previously, two growth hormone-containing depots for use in children were submitted for assessment 
(somatropin Biopartners and Nutropin depot). The Nutropin depot was withdrawn by the applicant before a 
final position could be reached by the CPMP.  
The other product somatropin Biopartners (EMEA/H/C/2196) was approved. Observed clinical effects with 
respect to this medicinal product were comparable with those observed for lonapegsomatropin. The applicant 
agreed on a PASS to elucidate the long-term risks of the observed exposure with growth hormone and IGF-I. 
The marketing authorisation ceased to be valid due to the sunset clause. 
Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Lonapegsomatropin Ascendis Pharma is positive, subject to the conditions 
stated in section ‘Recommendations’.

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the review of data on the quality, non-clinical and clinical properties of the active substance, the 
CHMP considers that lonapegsomatropin active substance (biological of the applicant) in comparison to 
somatropin (biological approved) previously authorised as a medicinal product in the European Union is to be 
qualified as a new active substance as it differs significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy 
from the previously authorised substance. 
Refer to Appendix on new active substance (NAS).  
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0275/2020 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

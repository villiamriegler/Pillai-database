1.  Introduction 
Humira (adalimumab) is currently approved for several inflammatory diseases in adults, including 
rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis, arthritic psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease and 
ankylosing spondylitis. In the paediatric population Humira is indicated for the treatment of juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, enthesitis-related arthritis, paediatric plaque psoriasis and Crohn´s disease. 
On 25 July 2016, the MAH submitted a completed study (P10-559) for Humira, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
The submission pertains to data available from patients less than 18 years of age recruited to a non-
interventional, open-label, post-marketing observational study (PMOS) in which Humira was prescribed 
for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in routine medical practice in Japanese patients, titled: 
“Humira 40mg/0.8ml for Subcutaneous Injection-Drug Use Investigation (All Patient Investigation) for 
Rheumatoid Arthritis” 
In total, 13 subjects below 18 years of age were enrolled in this PMOS. 
The study was submitted in synoptic format since the full study report is only available in the Japanese 
language. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Study P10-559 is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Humira as approved in Japan was used in this study. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Study P10-559 
Humira 40mg/0.8ml for Subcutaneous Injection-Drug Use Investigation 
(All Patient Investigation) for Rheumatoid Arthritis 
Description 
Post-marketing observational study 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
To clarify the following: 
1) Unknown adverse reactions (especially clinically significant adverse reactions) 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
Page 2/7 
 
 
 
 
 
2) Incidence and conditions of occurrence of adverse reactions in the clinical setting 
3) Factors that may affect the safety and effectiveness of Humira in Japanese patients for whom 
Humira was prescribed for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in routine medical practice. 
Study design 
This was a non-interventional, open-label, all-case, central registration method, post marketing 
observational study in which Humira was prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis in the routine medical 
practice.  
Study population /Sample size 
As a result of discussion with Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), the MAH 
committed to report with a minimum of 3000 patients having completed the study at which time the 
results were submitted for PMDA review. A total of 7740 patients have been recruited. 
Treatments 
Marketed product of Humira, 40mg/0.8ml for subcutaneous injection; the duration of treatment (for 
data collection) was 24 weeks. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Outcome Measures: 
• 
• 
Total number of patients with adverse events (Time Frame: at Week 24) 
Improvement rating on the basis of Disease Activity Score 28 ( Time Frame: at Weeks 4, 12, 24) 
Secondary Outcome Measures: 
• 
Effectiveness evaluation by the investigator (Time Frame: at Week 24) 
Clinical effectiveness as primary outcome measure (improvement rating based on Disease Activity 
Score 28 [DAS28]) was assessed using EULAR (European League Against Rheumatism) response 
criteria. Patients were classified as having good, moderate or non-response based on both the present 
DAS28 and DAS28 improvement (defined as the change of DAS from baseline DAS). For instance, 
when present DAS28 is <3.2 and the DAS28 improvement is >1.2, it is considered as Good response. 
Scores of good and moderate response were considered to have therapeutic response (Effective rate). 
Overall improvement rating (the effectiveness evaluation done by each physician) was defined as 
secondary outcome measure. The level of overall improvement rating was categorized into “Markedly 
improved”, “Improved”, “Not changed” or "Not assessable", comparing clinical conditions at Week 24 
or at discontinuation with baseline conditions. Investigators could describe the reasons for the rating.

Statistical Methods 
Data were analysed using descriptive methods.  
DAS missing data were processed using the last observation carried forward method, except for 
baseline values. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
In total, 7740 patients were treated with Humira.  
The total number of discontinuing patients was 2250 (2250/7740, 29.1%). 
Lack of efficacy (849/7740, 11.0%) and AEs (767/7740, 9.9%) were the most common reasons for 
discontinuation (see Table 1 below).

Reasons for discontinuation 
The PMDA had required a minimum of 3000 patients to complete the study. 
The flow of participants is shown in Figure 1 below.

Participant Flow 
Baseline data 
In total, 7740 patients were treated with Humira. The majority of patients were women (82.5%, 
n=6388). Patient age was 60.1 ± 13.0 years (mean ± SD). Disease duration was 10.5 ± 9.6 years 
(mean ± SD). Patients with prior treatment with biologics or DMARDs were 42.1% (n=3260) and 
94.2% (n=7289), respectively. Concomitant use of methotrexate was 71.1% (n=5503) and that of 
glucocorticoids was 67.4% (n=5215). 
Assessor’s comment: 
There were 13 patients under the age of 18 years who participated in this study. 
Efficacy results 
Effectiveness of Humira treatment was assessed for 6802 of 7740 patients. A total of 938 patients 
were excluded due to diagnoses other than RA (n=16), lack of assessable data (n=812) and too short 
treatment period (less than 2 weeks, n=254). 
The EULAR response was evaluated as a Primary Outcome Measure at Weeks 4, 12 or 24 (see Table 2 
below).

(see Table 3 below).

Assessor’s comment: 
No efficacy results were provided specific for the few paediatric patients in this study. Given the 
absence of data, no conclusions can be drawn for this population. 
Safety results 
The safety analysis was performed in 7740 patients. 
A total of 2155 patients (27.8%) experienced AEs. The incidence of SAEs and nonserious AEs was 
6.1% (n = 469) and 23.2% (n = 1796), respectively. The most frequent SAE was pneumonia (0.5%, n 
= 41) followed by interstitial lung disease (0.5%, n = 40). Among the 40 patients with interstitial lung 
disease, 13 patients had documented pre-existing interstitial lung disease. Rash was the most

frequently observed nonserious AE (3.3%, n = 255), followed by injection site erythema (2.1%, n = 
160). No overall safety profile change of Humira was seen and unknown clinically significant adverse 
events were not detected. 
Four of the 13 paediatric subjects experienced a total of 5 AEs (all nonserious) as follows: 
One 15-year-old patient experienced erythema 
One 15-year-old patient experienced a fungal infection and pruritus 
One 15-year-old patient experienced nasopharyngitis 
One 17-year-old patient experienced paronychia 
2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Given the few paediatric patients enrolled into this study (13/7740) and the very limited data that 
were provided for these patients, no conclusions on the impact for a European paediatric population 
can be drawn. Thus, these data are considered to have no influence on the benefit/risk for Humira. No 
changes to the SmPC are warranted.

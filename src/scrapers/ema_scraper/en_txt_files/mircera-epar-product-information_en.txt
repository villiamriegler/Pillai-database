CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adult patients 
(see section 5.1). 
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in paediatric 
patients from 3 months to less than 18 years of age who are converting from another erythropoiesis 
stimulating agent (ESA) after their haemoglobin level was stabilised with the previous ESA (see 
section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration. 
Treatment has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of 
patients with renal impairment. 
Posology 
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in chronic kidney disease patients 
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a 
physician’s evaluation of the individual patient’s clinical course and condition is necessary. Treatment 
should be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not 
greater than 12 g/dl (7.45 mmol/l). Subcutaneous use is preferable in patients who are not receiving 
haemodialysis to avoid puncture of peripheral veins. 
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and 
below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed. Haemoglobin variability should be addressed 
through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/dl 
(6.21 mmol/l) to 12 g/dl (7.45 mmol/l). A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/dl 
(7.45 mmol/l) should be avoided; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin 
values exceeding 12 g/dl (7.45 mmol/l) are observed are described below. 
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/dl (1.24 mmol/l) in adult patients and 1 g/dl (0.62 mmol/l) in 
paediatric patients over a four-week period should be avoided. If it occurs, appropriate dose 
adjustment should be made as provided. 
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved effective dose of treatment is 
used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia whilst maintaining a haemoglobin 
concentration below or at 12 g/dl (7.45 mmol/l).  
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Caution should be exercised with escalation of treatment doses in patients with chronic renal failure. 
In patients with a poor haemoglobin response to treatment, alternative explanations for the poor 
response should be considered (see section 4.4 and 5.1). 
It is recommended that haemoglobin is monitored every two weeks until stabilised and periodically 
thereafter (see section 4.4). 
Adult patients not currently treated with an erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA): 
In order to increase haemoglobin levels to greater than 10 g/dl (6.21 mmol/l), the recommended 
starting dose in patients not on dialysis is 1.2 microgram/kg body weight, administered once every 
month as a single subcutaneous injection. 
Alternatively, a starting dose of 0.6 microgram/kg bodyweight may be administered once every two 
weeks as a single intravenous or subcutaneous injection in patients on dialysis or not on dialysis. 
The dose may be increased by approximately 25% of the previous dose if the rate of rise in 
haemoglobin is less than 1.0 g/dl (0.621 mmol/l) over a month. Further increases of approximately 
25% may be made at monthly intervals until the individual target haemoglobin level is obtained. 
If the rate of rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.24 mmol/l) in one month or if the 
haemoglobin level is increasing and approaching 12 g/dl (7.45 mmol/l), the dose is to be reduced by 
approximately 25%. If the haemoglobin level continues to increase, therapy should be interrupted until 
the haemoglobin level begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be restarted at a dose 
approximately 25% below the previously administered dose. After dose interruption a haemoglobin 
decrease of approximately 0.35 g/dl (0.22 mmol/l) per week is expected. Dose adjustments should not 
be made more frequently than once a month. 
Patients treated once every two weeks whose haemoglobin concentration is above 10 g/dl 
(6.21 mmol/l) may receive methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta administered once-monthly 
using the dose equal to twice the previous once-every-two-week dose. 
Adult patients currently treated with an ESA: 
Patients currently treated with an ESA can be switched to methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta 
administered once a month as a single intravenous or subcutaneous injection. The starting dose of 
methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta is based on the calculated previous weekly dose of 
darbepoetin alfa or epoetin at the time of substitution as described in Table 1. The first injection 
should start at the next scheduled dose of the previously administered darbepoetin alfa or epoetin.

If a dose adjustment is required to maintain the target haemoglobin concentration above 10 g/dl 
(6.21 mmol/l), the monthly dose may be increased by approximately 25%. 
If the rate of rise in haemoglobin is greater than 2 g/dl (1.24 mmol/l) over a month or if the 
haemoglobin level is increasing and approaching 12 g/dl (7.45 mmol/l), the dose is to be reduced by 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
approximately 25%. If the haemoglobin level continues to increase, therapy should be interrupted until 
the haemoglobin level begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be restarted at a dose 
approximately 25% below the previously administered dose. After dose interruption a haemoglobin 
decrease of approximately 0.35 g/dl (0.22 mmol/l) per week is expected. Dose adjustments should not 
be made more frequently than once a month. 
Since the treatment experience is limited in patients on peritoneal dialysis, regular haemoglobin 
monitoring and strict adherence to dose adjustment guidance are recommended in these patients. 
Paediatric patients from 3 months to less than 18 years of age currently treated with an ESA: 
Paediatric patients whose haemoglobin level has been stabilised by treatment with an ESA can be 
converted to methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta administered once every 4 weeks as an IV or 
SC injection, but keeping the same administration route. The starting dose of methoxy polyethylene 
glycol-epoetin beta is calculated based on the total weekly ESA dose at the time of conversion (Table 
2).

Pre-filled syringes are not designed for administration of partial doses. Due to the available dose 
strengths of pre-filled syringes, paediatric patients with an ESA dose of <9 microgram/week 
(darbepoetin alfa) or <2000 IU/week of epoetin, should not be switched to methoxy polyethylene 
glycol-epoetin beta. 
If a dose adjustment is required to maintain the target haemoglobin concentration above 10 g/dl, the 
4 weekly dose may be adjusted by approximately 25%. 
If the rise in haemoglobin is greater than 1 g/dl (0.62 mmol/l) over 4 weeks or the haemoglobin level 
is increasing and approaching 12 g/dl (7.45 mmol/l), the methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta 
dose is to be reduced by approximately 25%. 
If the haemoglobin level continues to increase following dose reduction, therapy is to be interrupted 
until the haemoglobin level begins to decrease, at which point therapy should be restarted at a dose 
approximately 25% below the previously administered dose. 
Dose adjustments should not be made more often than once every 4 weeks. 
Treatment interruption  
Treatment is normally long-term. However, it can be interrupted at any time, if necessary. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Missed dose 
If one dose of treatment is missed, the missed dose is to be administered as soon as possible and 
administration of treatment is to be restarted at the prescribed dosing frequency. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta in paediatric patients less than 3 
months of age have not been established. No data are available. 
Special populations 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
No adjustments of the starting dose nor of the dose modification rules are required in patients with 
hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Elderly population 
In clinical studies 24% of patients treated with methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta were aged 
65 to 74 years, while 20% were aged 75 years and over. No dose adjustment is required in patients 
aged 65 years or older. 
Method of administration 
Treatment should be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously. It can be injected 
subcutaneously in the abdomen, arm or thigh. All three injection sites are equally suitable. For 
instructions on the administration of the medicinal product, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Uncontrolled hypertension. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
The safety and efficacy of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta therapy in other indications, 
including anaemia in patients with cancer, has not been established. 
Caution should be exercised with escalation of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta doses in 
patients with chronic renal failure since high cumulative epoetin doses may be associated with an 
increased risk of mortality, serious cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. In patients with a poor 
haemoglobin response to epoetins, alternative explanations for the poor response should be considered 
(see section 4.2 and 5.1). 
Paediatric population: 
Paediatric patients, especially children <1 year of age, should be carefully evaluated before switching 
from another ESA treatment and the haemoglobin level should be stabilised prior to switching.  
Following ESA conversion, it is recommended that haemoglobin is monitored every 4 weeks.  
If the current ESA dose is <9 microgram/week of darbepoetin alfa or <2000 IU/week of epoetin, the 
patient should not be switched to methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta, as the lowest available 
pre-filled syringe dose strength is 30 micrograms. Administration of partial doses with pre-filled 
syringes is not recommended. 
Supplementary iron therapy is recommended for all patients with serum ferritin values below 
100 microgram/l or with transferrin saturation below 20%. To ensure effective erythropoiesis, iron 
status has to be evaluated for all patients prior to and during treatment.  
Failure to respond to treatment should prompt for a search for causative factors. Deficiencies of iron, 
folic acid or vitamin B12 reduce the effectiveness of ESAs and should therefore be corrected. 
Intercurrent infections, inflammatory or traumatic episodes, occult blood loss, haemolysis, severe 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
aluminium toxicity, underlying haematologic diseases, or bone marrow fibrosis may also compromise 
the erythropoietic response. A reticulocyte count should be considered as part of the evaluation. If all 
the conditions mentioned are excluded and the patient has a sudden drop of haemoglobin associated 
with reticulocytopenia and anti-erythropoietin antibodies, examination of the bone marrow for the 
diagnosis of Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) should be considered. In case PRCA is diagnosed, 
treatment must be discontinued and patients should not be switched to another ESA. 
Physicians may request the Marketing Authorisation Holder to test or re-test serum samples in a 
reference laboratory for cases of suspected or confirmed AEAB-mediated PRCA or unexplained loss 
of effect under treatment (e.g. observed clinically by severe anaemia and low reticulocyte count). 
Pure Red Cell Aplasia caused by anti-erythropoietin antibodies has been reported in association with 
all ESAs, including methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta. These antibodies have been shown to 
cross-react with all ESAs, and patients suspected or confirmed to have antibodies to erythropoietin 
should not be switched to methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (see section 4.8). 
PRCA in patients with Hepatitis C: A paradoxical decrease in haemoglobin and development of severe 
anaemia associated with low reticulocyte counts should prompt to discontinue treatment with epoetin 
and perform anti-erythropoietin antibody testing. Cases have been reported in patients with hepatitis C 
treated with interferon and ribavirin, when epoetins are used concomitantly. Epoetins are not approved 
in the management of anaemia associated with hepatitis C. 
Blood pressure monitoring: As with other ESAs, blood pressure may rise during treatment with 
methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta. Blood pressure should be adequately controlled in all 
patients before, at initiation of, and during treatment with methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta. If 
high blood pressure is difficult to control by medical treatment or dietary measures, the dose must be 
reduced or administration discontinued (see section 4.2). 
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic 
epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported in association 
with epoetin treatment (see section 4.8). More severe cases have been observed with long-acting 
epoetins. At the time of prescription patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and 
monitored closely for skin reactions. If signs and symptoms suggestive of these reactions appear, 
methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta should be withdrawn immediately and an alternative 
treatement considered.  If the patient has developed a severe cutaneous skin reaction such as SJS or 
TEN due to the use of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta, treatment with ESA must not be 
restarted in this patient at any time. 
Haemoglobin concentration: In patients with chronic kidney disease, maintenance haemoglobin 
concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended 
in section 4.2. In clinical trials, an increased risk of death, serious cardiovascular events including 
thrombosis or cerebrovascular events including stroke was observed when ESAs were administered to 
target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/dl (7.5 mmol/l) (see section 4.8). 
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of 
epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control 
symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion. 
The safety and efficacy of treatment has not been established in patients with haemoglobinopathies, 
seizures, bleeding or a recent history of bleeding requiring transfusions or with platelet levels greater 
than 500 x 109/l. Therefore, caution should be used in these patients. 
Effect on tumour growth: Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta, like other ESAs, is a growth 
factor that primarily stimulates red blood cell production. Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed 
on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. As with all growth factors, there is a concern that ESAs 
could stimulate the growth of any type of malignancy. Two controlled clinical studies in which 
epoetins were administered to patients with various cancers including head and neck cancers, and 
breast cancer, have shown an unexplained excess mortality. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Misuse of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta by healthy people may lead to an excessive 
increase in haemoglobin. This may be associated with life-threatening cardiovascular complications. 
Traceability: In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the 
batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. There is no evidence that methoxy polyethylene glycol-
epoetin beta alters the metabolism of other medicinal products. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta in pregnant women.  
Animal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryofoetal 
development, parturition or postnatal development but indicate a class-related reversible reduction in 
foetal weight (see section 5.3). Caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta is excreted in human breast milk. 
One animal study has shown excretion of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta in maternal milk. 
A decision on whether to continue or discontinue breast-feeding or to continue or discontinue therapy 
with methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta should be made taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta therapy to the 
woman.  
Fertility 
Studies in animals have shown no evidence of impaired fertility (see section 5.3). The potential risk 
for humans is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and 
use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
(a) Summary of the safety profile 
The safety data base from clinical trials comprised 3,042 CKD adult patients, including 1,939 adult 
patients treated with methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta and 1,103 with another ESA. 
Approximately 6% of adult patients treated with methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta are 
expected to experience adverse reactions. The most frequent reported adverse reaction was 
hypertension (common). 
(b) Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions in Table 3 are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency 
category. Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); 
common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare 
(<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported from post-marketing setting. A slight decrease in 
platelet counts remaining within the normal range was observed in clinical studies. 
Platelet counts below 100 x 109/l were observed in 7% of adult patients treated with methoxy 
polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta and 4% of adult patients treated with other ESAs during clinical 
development. In a post-authorisation safety study with long treatment exposure of up to 8.4 years, 
baseline platelet counts below 100 x 109/l was present in 2.1% of adult patients in the methoxy 
polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta group and 2.4% of adult patients in other ESAs group. During the 
study, platelet counts below 100 x 109/l were observed yearly in 1.5% to 3.0% of adult patients treated 
with methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta and 1.6% to 2.5% of adult patients treated with other 
ESAs. 
Data from a controlled clinical trial with epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa reported an incidence of 
stroke as common. A post-authorisation safety study showed similar incidence of stroke between 
methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (6.3%) and reference ESAs groups (epoetin alfa, 
darbepoetin alfa and epoetin beta) (7%). 
As with other ESAs, cases of thrombosis, including pulmonary embolism, have been reported in the 
post-marketing setting (see section 4.4). 
Neutralising anti-erythropoietin antibody-mediated pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) has been reported, 
frequency unknown. In case PRCA is diagnosed, therapy with methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin 
beta must be discontinued, and patients should not be switched to another recombinant erythropoietic 
protein (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population  
In the two paediatric studies, the paediatric population studied comprised a total of 104 patients, of 
which 12 were less than 5 years of age, 36 were 5 to 11 years of age and 56 were 12 to 17 years of 
age. The safety profile of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta in the paediatric population 
included in these two studies was overall consistent with that known for the adult population, based on 
low patient exposure in these studies (see section 5.1).

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The therapeutic range of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta is wide. Individual responsiveness 
must be considered when treatment is initiated. Overdose can result in manifestations of an 
exaggerated pharmacodynamic effect, e.g. excessive erythropoiesis. In case of excessive haemoglobin 
levels, treatment with methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta should be temporarily discontinued 
(see section 4.2). If clinically indicated, phlebotomy may be performed. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other antianemic preparations, ATC code: B03XA03 
Mechanism of action 
Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta stimulates erythropoiesis by interaction with the 
erythropoietin receptor on progenitor cells in the bone marrow. Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin 
beta, the active substance of MIRCERA, is a continuous erythropoietin receptor activator that shows a 
different activity at the receptor level characterized by a slower association to and faster dissociation 
from the receptor, a reduced specific activity in vitro with an increased activity in vivo, as well as an 
increased half-life, in contrast to erythropoietin. The average molecular mass is approximately 60 kDa 
of which the protein moiety plus the carbohydrate part constitutes approximately 30 kDa. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
As primary growth factor for erythroid development, the natural hormone erythropoietin is produced 
in the kidney and released into the bloodstream in response to hypoxia. In responding to hypoxia, the 
natural hormone erythropoietin interacts with erythroid progenitor cells to increase red cell production. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Adult population 
Data from correction studies with patients treated once every two weeks and once every four weeks 
show that the haemoglobin response rates in the methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta group at 
the end of the correction period were high and comparable to comparators. The median time to 
response was 43 days in the methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta arm and 29 days in the 
comparator arm, with increases of haemoglobin within the first 6 weeks of 0.2 g/dl/week and 
0.3 g/dl/week, respectively. 
Four randomized controlled studies were performed in dialysis patients currently treated with 
darbepoetin alfa or epoetin at the time of enrollment. Patients were randomized to stay on their 
treatment at the time of enrollment or to be switched to methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta in 
order to maintain stable haemoglobin levels. At the evaluation period (week 29-36), the mean and 
median level of haemoglobin in patients treated with methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta was 
virtually identical to their baseline haemoglobin level. 
In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 4,038 CRF patients not on dialysis with 
type 2 diabetes and haemoglobin levels ≤ 11 g/dl, patients received either treatment with darbepoetin 
alfa to target haemoglobin levels of 13 g/dl or placebo (see section 4.4). The study did not meet either 
primary objective of demonstrating a reduction in risk for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
morbidity, or end stage renal disease (ESRD). Analysis of the individual components of the composite 
endpoints showed the following HR (95% CI): death 1.05 (0.92, 1.21), stroke 1.92 (1.38, 2.68), 
congestive heart failure (CHF) 0.89 (0.74, 1.08), myocardial infarction (MI) 0.96 (0.75, 1.23), 
hospitalisation for myocardial ischaemia 0.84 (0.55, 1.27), ESRD 1.02 (0.87, 1.18). 
Pooled post-hoc analyses of clinical studies of ESAs have been performed in chronic renal failure 
patients (on dialysis, not on dialysis, in diabetic and non-diabetic patients). A tendency towards 
increased risk estimates for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events associated 
with higher cumulative ESA doses independent of the diabetes or dialysis status was observed (see 
section 4.2 and section 4.4). 
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production. Erythropoietin receptors 
may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells. 
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total 
of 2,833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-
label study. Two of the studies recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy. The 
target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was >13 g/dl; in the remaining three studies it was 12-
14 g/dl. In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated 
with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls. In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard 
ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls. These studies have 
shown a consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia 
associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared 
to controls. Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be satisfactorily explained by differences 
in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human 
erythropoietin and those in the control group. 
A patient-level data analysis has also been performed on more than 13,900 cancer patients (chemo-, 
radia-, chemoradia-, or no therapy) participating in 53 controlled clinical trials involving several 
epoetins. Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.06 in 
favour of controls (95% CI: 1.00, 1.12; 53 trials and 13,933 patients) and for the cancer patients 
receiving chemotherapy, the overall survival hazard ratio was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.11; 38 trials and 
10,441 patients). Meta-analyses also indicate consistently a significantly increased relative risk of 
thromboembolic events in cancer patients receiving recombinant human erythropoietin (see section 
4.4). No patients treated with methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta were included in this data 
analysis. 
Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta is not approved for treatment of patients with chemotherapy 
induced anaemia (see section 4.1 and 4.4.).  
Paediatric population 
Two studies have been conducted in paediatric patients. One study with intravenous administration 
(IV) and one study with subcutaneous administration (SC) of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin 
beta. 
The study using IV administration was a phase II, dose-finding, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, 
multiple dose study (NH19707) conducted in 64 paediatric patients (aged 5 to 17 years old) with CKD 
on hemodialysis, to evaluate two conversion factors (group 1 and group 2) in order to switch from 
maintenance treatment with IV epoetin alfa/beta or darbepoetin alfa to methoxy polyethylene glycol-
epoetin beta, administed IV once every 4 weeks for 20 weeks. Efficacy was assessed based on the 
change in haemoglobin concentration (g/dl) between the baseline and evaluation period.  The adjusted 
mean change in haemoglobin from baseline to the evaluation period in group 1 was -0.74 g/dl [95% 
CI: -1.32 to -0.16] and in group 2 it was -0.09 g/dl [95% CI: -0.45 to 0.26]. 58% and  75% of patients 
maintained haemoglobin values within ±1 g/dl of baseline and 75% and 81% maintained haemoglobin 
values within 10-12 g/dl in group 1 and group 2 respectively. Subgroup analyses by age groups (5-11 
years and 12-17 years) were consistent with the observations in the overall population. Patients who 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
completed the 20 weeks of core treatment, who adequately maintained haemoglobin levels were 
eligible to enter an optional 52-week safety extension period with the same dosing frequency. 
The study using SC administration was a second phase II, dose-finding, open-label, single-arm, 
multicenter study (NH19708) conducted in 40 paediatric patients (aged 3 months to 17 years old) with 
CKD on dialysis, or not yet on dialysis, to evaluate the conversion factor used in group 2 in the IV 
study, in order to switch from maintenance treatment with SC epoetin alfa/ beta or darboepoetin alfa to 
methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta, administered SC once every 4 weeks for 20 weeks. 
Similarly, in this study, the primary efficacy endpoint was the change in haemoglobin concentration 
(g/dl) between the baseline and evaluation period. The mean change in haemoglobin concentration 
during the evaluation period was 0.48 g/dl [95% CI: 0.15 to 0.82], which was within the equivalence 
bounds of -1 to +1g/dl. The results of the mean change in haemoglobin concentration by age group (<5 
years, 5-11 years, ≥12 years) were consistent with the results of the primary endpoint during the 
evaluation period. Patients who completed the 20 weeks of core treatment, who adequately maintained 
haemoglobin levels, were eligible to enter an optional 24-week safety extension period with the same 
dosing frequency. 
In both the studies, the mean haemoglobin values remained within 10 to 12 g/dl throughout the entire 
evaluation period and safety extension period for the majority of patients. The safety profile observed 
in paediatric patients from both studies was consistent with that found in adults (see section 4.8). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Adult population 
The pharmacokinetics of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta were studied in healthy volunteers 
and in anaemic patients with CKD including patients on dialysis and not on dialysis. 
Following subcutaneous administration to CKD patients not on dialysis, the maximum serum 
concentrations of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta were observed 95 hours (median value) 
after administration. The absolute bioavailability of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta after 
subcutaneous administration was 54%. The observed terminal elimination half-life was 142 hours in 
CKD patients not on dialysis. 
Following subcutaneous administration to CKD patients on dialysis, the maximum serum 
concentrations of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta were observed 72 hours (median value) 
after administration. The absolute bioavailability of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta after 
subcutaneous administration was 62% and the observed terminal elimination half-life was 139 hours 
in CKD patients on dialysis. 
Following intravenous administration to CKD patients on dialysis, the total systemic clearance was 
0.494 ml/h per kg. The elimination half-life after intravenous administration of methoxy polyethylene 
glycol-epoetin beta is 134 hours. 
A comparison of serum concentrations of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta measured before 
and after haemodialysis in 41 CKD patients showed that haemodialysis has no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of this medicinal product. 
An analysis in 126 CKD patients showed no pharmacokinetic difference between patients on dialysis 
and patients not on dialysis. 
In a single dose study, after intravenous administration, the pharmacokinetics of methoxy polyethylene 
glycol-epoetin beta are similar in patients with severe hepatic impairment as compared to healthy 
subjects (see section 4.2). 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with data from 103 paediatric patients, aged 
from 6 months to 17 years, body weight ranging from 7 to 90 kg, and 524 adult patients. Paediatric 
patients received methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta IV (all on hemodialysis) or SC (on 
peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis or not yet on dialysis). Clearance and volume of distribution were 
found to increase with body weight and volume of distribution with age. The observed maximum and 
minimum serum concentrations of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta in paediatric patients, 
collected when their haemoglobin levels were stabilised, were comparable to those observed in adults 
for both routes of administration, IV and SC.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data show no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of cardiovascular 
safety pharmacology, repeat dose toxicity and reproductive toxicity. 
The carcinogenic potential of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta has not been evaluated in 
long-term animal studies. It did not induce a proliferative response in non-haematological tumor cell 
lines in vitro. In a six-month rat toxicity study no tumorigenic or unexpected mitogenic responses were 
observed in non-haematological tissues. In addition, using a panel of human tissues, the in vitro 
binding of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta was only observed in target cells (bone marrow 
progenitor cells). 
No significant placental transfer of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta was observed in the rat, 
and studies in animals have not shown any harmful effect on pregnancy, embryofoetal development, 
parturition or postnatal development. There was however a class-related reversible reduction in foetal 
weight and a decrease in postnatal body-weight gain of offspring at the doses causing exaggerated 
pharmacodynamic effects in mothers. Physical, cognitive, or sexual developments in the offspring of 
mothers receiving methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta during gestation and lactation were not 
affected. When methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta was administered subcutaneously to male 
and female rats prior to and during mating, reproductive performance, fertility, and sperm assessment 
parameters were not affected.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What MIRCERA is and what it is used for 
This medicine is prescribed to you because you have anaemia caused by your chronic kidney disease 
and associated with typical symptoms, such as tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath. This 
means that you have too few red blood cells and your haemoglobin level is too low (your body’s 
tissues might not receive enough oxygen). 
MIRCERA is indicated to treat only the symptomatic anaemia caused by chronic kidney disease in 
adult patients and in paediatric patients (aged 3 months to less than 18 years) on erythropoiesis 
stimulating agent (ESA) maintenance treatment after their haemoglobin level was stabilised with the 
previous ESA. 
MIRCERA is a medicine produced by gene-technology. Like the natural hormone erythropoietin, 
MIRCERA increases the number of red blood cells and haemoglobin level in your blood.

2.  What you need to know before you use MIRCERA 
Do not use MIRCERA 
• 
if you are allergic to methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta or to any of the other ingredients 
of this medicine (listed in section 6) 
if you have high blood pressure that cannot be controlled 
• 
Warnings and precautions 
The safety and efficacy of MIRCERA therapy in other indications, including anaemia in patients with 
cancer, has not been established. 
The safety and efficacy of MIRCERA therapy in paediatric patients have only been established in 
patients whose haemoglobin level has been previously stabilised by treatment with an ESA.  
Before treatment with MIRCERA 
• 
A condition called Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA, stopped or reduced production of red blood 
cells) due to anti-erythropoietin antibodies was observed in some patients treated with 
erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs), including MIRCERA. 
If your doctor suspects or confirms that you have these antibodies in your blood, you must not 
be treated with MIRCERA. 
If you are a patient with hepatitis C and you receive interferon and ribavirin you should discuss  
this with your doctor because a combination of ESAs with interferon and ribavirin has led to a 
loss of effect and development of PRCA, a severe form of anemia, in rare cases. ESAs are not 
approved in the management of anaemia associated with hepatitis C. 
If you are a patient with chronic kidney disease and anemia treated with an ESA and are also 
a cancer patient you should be aware that ESAs, might have a negative impact on your 
condition. You should discuss options for anemia treatment with your doctor. 
It is not known if MIRCERA has a different effect in patients with haemoglobinopathies 
(disorders associated with abnormal haemoglobin), past or present bleeding, seizures or with a 
high blood platelet count. If you have any of these conditions, your doctor will discuss it with 
you and must treat you with caution. 
Healthy people should not use MIRCERA. Using it can lead to too high haemoglobin levels and 
cause problems with the heart or blood vessels that may be life-threatening. 
During treatment with MIRCERA 
• 
If you are a patient with chronic renal failure, and particularly if you do not respond properly to 
MIRCERA, your doctor will check your dose of MIRCERA because repeatedly increasing your 
dose of MIRCERA if you are not responding to treatment may increase the risk of having a 
problem of the heart or the blood vessels and could increase risk of myocardial infarction, stroke 
and death.  
Your doctor may initiate treatment with MIRCERA if your haemoglobin level is 10 g/dl 
(6.21 mmol/l) or less. After initiation of therapy, your doctor will seek to maintain your 
haemoglobin level between 10 and 12 g/dl (7.45 mmol/l). 
Your doctor will check the amount of iron in your blood before and during MIRCERA 
treatment. If the amount is too low your doctor may give you an additional iron supplement. 
Your doctor will check your blood pressure before and during your MIRCERA treatment. If 
your blood pressure is high and cannot be controlled, either by appropriate medicines or a 
special diet, your doctor will interrupt your MIRCERA treatment or reduce the dose. 
Your doctor will check that your haemoglobin does not exceed a certain level, as high 
haemoglobin could put you at risk of having a problem of the heart or the blood vessels and 
could increase risk of thrombosis, including pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, stroke 
and death.  
Contact your doctor if you feel tired, weak or have shortness of breath, because this could mean 
that your MIRCERA treatment is not effective. Your doctor will check that you do not have 
other causes of anaemia and may perform blood tests or examine your bone marrow. If you 
have developed PRCA, your MIRCERA treatment will be discontinued. You will not receive 
another ESA and your doctor will treat you for this condition.

Children and adolescents 
MIRCERA can be used for the treatment of children and adolescents, 3 months of age to less than 18 
years, with anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease. They should be stabilised on ESA 
maintenance treatment prior to switching to MIRCERA and may or may not be receiving dialysis. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given this medicine if you, or your child, are 
under 18 years of age. 
Take special care with other products that stimulate red blood cell production: MIRCERA is one 
of a group of products that stimulate the production of red blood cells like the human protein 
erythropoietin does. Your healthcare professional will always record the exact product you are using. 
Serious skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis 
(TEN) have been reported in association with epoetin treatment. 
SJS/TEN can appear initially as reddish target-like spots or circular patches often with central blisters 
on the trunk. Also, ulcers of mouth, throat, nose, genitals and eyes (red and swollen eyes) can occur. 
These serious skin rashes are often preceded by fever and/or flu-like symptoms. The rashes may 
progress to widespread peeling of the skin and life-threatening complications. 
If you develop a serious rash or another of these skin symptoms stop taking Mircera and contact your 
doctor or seek medical attention immediately. 
Other medicines and MIRCERA 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
No interaction studies have been performed. There is no evidence that MIRCERA interacts with other 
medicines. 
 MIRCERA with food and drink 
Food and drink do not affect MIRCERA. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
MIRCERA has not been studied in pregnant or breast-feeding women. 
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Your doctor 
will consider what is the best treatment for you during pregnancy. 
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or intend to breast-feed. Your doctor will advise if you 
should stop or continue breast-feeding and stop or continue your treatment. 
MIRCERA has not shown evidence of impaired fertility in animals. The potential risk for humans is 
unknown. 
Driving and using machines 
MIRCERA does not affect your ability to drive and use machines.  
Important information about some of the ingredients of MIRCERA 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, that is to say it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use MIRCERA 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure.  
Your doctor will use the lowest effective dose to control the symptoms of your anaemia. 
If you do not respond adequately to MIRCERA, your doctor will check your dose and will inform you 
if you need to change doses of MIRCERA. 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment with MIRCERA must be started under the supervision of a healthcare professional. 
Further injections can be given by a healthcare professional or, after you have been trained, as an 
adult, you can inject MIRCERA yourself. Children and adolescents less than 18 years should not self-
inject MIRCERA, the administration should be performed by a healthcare professional or trained adult 
caregiver (follow the instructions at the end of this leaflet on how to use MIRCERA pre-filled syringe 
to give to yourself or another individual an injection.) 
MIRCERA can be injected under the skin in the abdomen, arm or thigh; or into a vein. Your doctor 
will decide which is best for you. 
Your doctor will carry out regular blood tests to monitor how your anaemia is responding to treatment 
by measuring your haemoglobin level. 
If you are an adult not currently treated with an ESA 
• 
If you are not on dialysis, the recommended starting dose of MIRCERA is 1.2 micrograms for every 
kilogram of your body weight to be administered under the skin once every month as a single 
injection. Alternatively, your doctor may decide to administer a starting dose of MIRCERA of 
0.6 micrograms for every kilogram of your body weight. The dose is to be administered once every 
two weeks as a single injection under the skin or into a vein. Once your anaemia is corrected your 
doctor may change your dosing to once a month administration. 
If you are on dialysis, the recommended starting dose is 0.6 micrograms for every kilogram of your 
body weight. The dose is to be administered once every two weeks as a single injection under the skin 
or into a vein. Once your anaemia is corrected your doctor may change your dosing to once a month 
administration. 
Your doctor may increase or decrease your dose or temporarily stop your treatment to adjust your 
haemoglobin level, as appropriate for you. Dose changes will not be made more often than once a 
month. 
If you are currently being treated with another ESA 
• 
Your doctor may replace your current medicine with MIRCERA. Your doctor will decide to treat you 
with MIRCERA administered as a single injection once a month. Your doctor will calculate your 
MIRCERA starting dose based on the last dose of your previous medicine. The first MIRCERA dose 
will be given on the planned injection day of your previous medicine. 
Your doctor may increase or decrease your dose or temporarily stop your treatment to adjust your 
haemoglobin to an appropriate level for you. Dose changes will not be made more often than once a 
month. 
If you use more MIRCERA than you should 
Please contact your doctor or pharmacist if you used too large a dose of MIRCERA as it may be 
necessary to perform some blood tests and interrupt your treatment. 
If you forget to use MIRCERA 
If you miss a dose of MIRCERA administer the missed dose as soon as you remember and talk to your 
doctor about when to use the next doses.  
If you stop using MIRCERA 
Treatment with MIRCERA is normally long-term. It can, however, be stopped on the advice of your 
doctor at any time. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

HOW TO GIVE THE INJECTION 
Step 1: Allow the syringe to adjust to room temperature 
Carefully remove the box 
containing the MIRCERA pre-
filled syringe from the refrigerator. 
Keep the syringe and the needle in 
the box to protect it from light and 
allow it to reach room temperature 
for at least 30 minutes (Figure C).  
•  Not allowing the medicine to 
come to room temperature 
could result in an 
uncomfortable injection, and it 
may be difficult to depress the 
plunger.  
•  Do not warm up the syringe in 
any other way. 
Figure C 
64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Open the box and Remove the 
plastic tray with the MIRCERA 
pre-filled syringe without peeling 
back the protective film (Figure D).  
Figure D 
Step 2: Clean your hands 
Disinfect your hands well with soap 
and warm water or hands sanitizer 
(Figure E).  
Figure E 
65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 3: Unpack and visually inspect the pre-filled syringe 
Figure F 
Figure G 
Peel back the protective film from 
the plastic tray and remove the 
packed needle and the syringe, 
holding the syringe by the middle of 
the body without touching the 
activation guards (Figure F). 
Only handle the syringe by the body, 
because any contact with the 
activation guards could cause 
premature release of the safety 
device. 
Examine the syringe for damage and 
check the expiration date on the 
syringe and box. This is important to 
ensure that the syringe and medicine 
are safe to use (Figure G).  
Do not use the syringe if: 
•  You have accidentally dropped 
the syringe. 
•  Any part of the syringe appears 
to be damaged. 
•  The contents are cloudy, hazy or 
• 
contain particles. 
If the colour is other than 
colourless to slightly yellowish. 
•  The expiration date has passed.

Step 4. Attach the needle to the syringe 
Figure H 
                                         Figure I 
Grasp the syringe in the middle of 
the body, hold the rubber tip cap 
firmly, and remove the rubber tip 
cap from the syringe (bend and pull) 
(Figure H).  
•  Once removed, immediately 
dispose of the rubber tip cap in 
the sharps/ puncture-resistant 
container.  
•  Do not touch the activation 
guards. 
•  Do not push the plunger. 
•  Do not pull on the plunger. 
Grasp the packaged needle firmly in 
both hands and examine the 
packaged needle for damage. Break 
the seal of the needle, using a 
twisting motion, and remove the 
needle cap (Figure I).   
Immediately throw away the needle 
cap in the sharps / puncture-
resistant container or sharps 
container. 
Do not remove the needle shield 
that protects the needle. 
Do not use the needle if: 
•  You have accidentally dropped 
the needle. 
•  Any part of the needle appears to 
be damaged. 
67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Attach the needle to the syringe by 
pushing it firmly straight onto the 
syringe and by twisting or turning it 
slightly (Figure J). 
Figure J 
Step 5. Remove the needle shield and prepare for injection 
Hold the syringe firmly with one 
hand in the middle of the body and 
pull the needle shield straight off 
with the other hand. Throw away 
the needle shield in the sharps/ 
puncture-resistant container or 
sharps container (Figure K).  
•  Once the needle shield is 
removed do not touch the needle 
or let it touch any surface, as the 
needle may become 
contaminated and may cause 
injury and pain if touched. 
•  You may see a drop of liquid at 
the end of the needle. This is 
normal. 
•  Never reattach the needle shield 
after removal. 
To remove air bubbles from the pre-
filled syringe, hold the syringe with 
the needle pointing up.  
Tap the syringe gently to bring any 
bubbles to the top (Figure L and M).  
Figure K 
Figure L 
68 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Push the plunger up slowly to 
remove all air, as shown to you by a 
healthcare professional. (Figure M). 
Figure M 
Step 6. Perform the injection  
There are two different ways (routes) to inject MIRCERA into your body.  Follow the 
recommendations of your healthcare professional about how you should inject MIRCERA.  
SUBCUTANEOUS ROUTE: 
If you are advised to inject MIRCERA under your skin, please administer your dose as 
described below. 
Choose one of the recommended 
injection sites as shown. 
You may inject MIRCERA into the 
upper arm, thigh or abdomen, but 
not in the area around the navel 
(belly button) (Figure N). 
The back of the upper arm is not a 
recommended site for self-injection.  
Use this injection site only if you 
inject someone else.  
When selecting an injection site: 
•  You should use a different 
injection site each time you 
administer an injection, at least 
three centimeters from the area 
you used for the previous 
injection.  
Figure N

•  Do not inject into areas that 
could be irritated by a belt or 
waistband.  
•  Do not inject into moles, scars, 
bruises, or areas where the skin 
is tender, red, hard or not intact.  
Clean the chosen injection site area 
using an alcohol pad to reduce the 
risk of infection; carefully follow the 
instructions of the alcohol pad 
(Figure O). 
•  Let the skin dry for 
approximately 10 seconds. 
•  Be sure not to touch the cleaned 
area prior to the injection and do 
not fan or blow on the clean 
area. 
Immediately throw away the 
alcohol pad. 
• 
Adopt a comfortable posture before 
performing an injection of 
MIRCERA.  
To be sure the needle can be inserted 
correctly under the skin, use your 
free hand to pinch a fold of loose 
skin at the clean injection site. 
Pinching the skin is important to 
ensure that you inject under the skin 
(into fatty tissue) but not any deeper 
(into muscle). Injection into muscle 
could result in an uncomfortable 
injection (Figure P). 
Carefully fully insert the needle into 
the skin at an angle of 90° in a quick, 
“dart-like” motion. Then keep the 
syringe in position and let go of the 
pinch of skin.

Do not move the needle while it is 
inserted in the skin.  
Once the needle is fully inserted into 
the skin, slowly push the plunger 
with your thumb while holding the 
syringe with the forefinger and the 
middle finger against the finger grips 
until all the medicine is injected.  
The plunger rod should be fully 
pushed down (depressed) and you 
should hear a click indicating the 
activation of the needle guard 
(Figure Q).  
Do not release the plunger before 
the end of injection or before the 
plunger is completely depressed.  
Take the needle out of the skin 
WITHOUT releasing the plunger 
(Figure R). 
Release the plunger, allowing the 
needle guard to protect the needle 
(Figure S). 
Now, the tear-off label can be 
removed, if necessary (Figure T).

After the injection:  
•  Place a sterile cotton ball or gauze over the injection site and press for several seconds. 
• 
•  Do not rub the injection site with a dirty hand or cloth. 
• 
Immediately throw away the cotton ball or the gauze after use. 
If needed, you may cover the injection site with a small bandage.  
Dispose of the syringe: 
•  Do not try to replace the needle shield on the needle. 
•  Do not reuse or resterilise the syringe and/or the needle.  
•  Do not throw away the used syringe with the needle via household waste.   
•  Throw away used syringes in a sharps/ puncture-resistant container and/or according to 
health institutions policies. 
•  Dispose of the full sharps/ puncture-resistant container. 
INTRAVENOUS ROUTE: 
If your healthcare professional has recommended injection of MIRCERA into a vein, you 
should follow the procedure described below.  
After preparation of the syringe as described in steps 1 to 5: 
Clean the venous port of the hemodialysis tubing with an alcohol swab as instructed by the 
provider or manufacturer.  Immediately throw away the alcohol swab after use. 
Insert the needle of the pre-filled syringe 
into the cleaned venous port (Figure U). 
Do not touch the injection site of the 
venous port 
Figure U

Push the plunger with the thumb while 
holding the syringe with the forefinger and 
the middle finger against the finger grips 
until all the medicine is injected (Figure V). 
Remove the pre-filled syringe from the 
venous port WITHOUT releasing the 
plunger.  
Once removed release the plunger, allowing 
the needle guard to protect the needle. 
Now, the tear-off label can be removed, if 
necessary (See Figure T).

Step 7: Dispose of the used syringe with the needle 
•  Do not try to replace the needle shield on the needle. 
•  Do not reuse or resterilise the syringe and/or the needle.  
•  Do not throw away the used syringe with the needle via household waste.   
•  Throw away used syringes in a sharps/ puncture-resistant container and/or according to 
health institutions policies. 
•  Dispose of the full sharps/ puncture-resistant container.

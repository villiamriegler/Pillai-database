SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR ENSPRYNG
(SATRALIZUMAB)
This is a summary of the risk-management plan (RMP) for Enspryng. The RMP details 
important risks of Enspryng, how these risks can be minimized, and how more 
information will be obtained about Enspryng’s risks and uncertainties (missing 
information).
Enspryng’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Enspryng should 
be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Enspryng should be read in the context of all this 
information, including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Enspryng’s RMP.
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
I.
Enspryng is authorized as monotherapy or in combination with immunosuppressive
therapy for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (also known as
Devic’s disease) in adult and adolescent patients from 12 years of age who have
antibodies to the aquaporin-4 (AQP4) receptor in their blood (see SmPC for the full
indication). It contains satralizumab as the active substance, and it is given
subcutaneously.
Further information about the evaluation of Enspryng’s benefits can be found in 
Enspryng’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA Web 
site, under the medicine’s Web page:
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/enspryng 
II.
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO
MINIMIZE OR FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS
Important risks of Enspryng, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Enspryng’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals.
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging.
The authorized pack sizeThe amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so as to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly.
The medicine’s legal statusThe way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of Enspryng, these measures are supplemented with additional 
risk-minimization measures mentioned under relevant risks below.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected 
continuously and regularly analyzed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Enspryng is not yet available, it is 
listed under “missing information” below.
II.A
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of Enspryng are risks that need special risk-management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Enspryng. 
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information about the safety of the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-
term use of the medicine).

Summary of Important Risks
Important identified risk: Serious infections 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
Serious infections is a class effect of IL-6 inhibitors. 
Although the overall rate of serious infections was 
comparable across treatment groups in both Phase III 
studies (BN40898 and BN40900), considering the small 
clinical database resulting from the rarity of the disease, 
serious infection is considered an important identified risk
for satralizumab.
Risk factors and risk groups Generally, immunocompromised patients or patients using 
satralizumab in combination with immunosuppressive 
therapy may be at higher risk of serious infections. 
However, no increased risk of serious infections or 
opportunistic infections was observed in the satralizumab 
group compared with the placebo group in Study BN40898 
with satralizumab in combination with immunosuppressive 
therapy. In addition, neutropenia may potentially increase 
the risk of serious infection, although no association 
between Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutropenia and serious 
infection were observed in the satralizumab studies.

Important potential risk: Serious hypersensitivity 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
No anaphylaxis or serious hypersensitivity reactions have 
been observed in the clinical development program with 
satralizumab, however, as therapeutic protein products
may lead to hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, serious 
hypersensitivity is considered an important potential risk 
for satralizumab.
Risk factors and risk groups
Patients with known hypersensitivity to satralizumab’s 
active substance or to any of its excipients.

Important potential risk: Hepatotoxicity 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Hepatotoxicity is an important potential or identified risk of 
other anti-IL-6R antibodies. Liver enzyme elevations were 
observed in satralizumab-treated patients in both Phase III 
studies with satralizumab. However, there is no evidence 
showing an increased risk of hepatotoxicity in patients 
treated with satralizumab compared with patients on 
placebo in the clinical development program with 
satralizumab.
In general, known risk factors for hepatotoxicity include 
age, gender, drug-interactions, high alcohol intake, 
malnutrition, HCV, HBV, HIV infections, and genetic 
predisposition. Patients with hepatic steatosis, alcohol liver 
disease, and other acquired or inherited liver diseases 
may be at a higher risk for developing hepatotoxicity.
Patients pre- or concomitantly treated with other 
medications associated with hepatotoxicity may be at 
higher risk for hepatotoxicity.
Risk-minimization measures Routine risk-minimization measures:
Routine risk communication: 
SmPC Section 4.2 - Posology and method of 
administration, dose modification advice for liver 
enzyme abnormalities, special populations: hepatic 
impairment 
SmPC Section 4.4 - Special warnings and precautions for 
use: Liver enzymes

characteristics
Important potential risk: Major cardiovascular events 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
A greater proportion of patients experienced elevations in 
total cholesterol or triglycerides in the satralizumab group 
compared with the placebo group in both Phase III studies 
BN40898 and BN40900. Although no increased risk of 
cardiovascular events was observed with satralizumab 
treatment, considering the limited exposure to 
satralizumab during the clinical studies and the exclusion 
of patients with serious uncontrolled cardiovascular 
disease in the Phase III studies, major cardiovascular 
event is considered a potential risk for satralizumab in 
susceptible patient population.
Important potential risk: Major cardiovascular events 
Risk factors and risk groups
Known risk factors accounting for more than 90% of major 
cardiovascular events are previous myocardial infarction, 
smoking, history of hypertension, diabetes, sedentary life 
style, abdominal obesity, psychosocial factors, alcohol 
consumption, and lack of daily consumption of fruits and 
vegetables. In addition, prior or concomitant treatments, 
including treatment for NMOSD (e.g., corticosteroids or 
mycophenolate), may be associated with hypertension, a 
risk factor for major cardiovascular events. Patients with 
evidence of serious uncontrolled cardiovascular disease 
were excluded from participation in the Phase III studies 
BN40898 and BN40900.

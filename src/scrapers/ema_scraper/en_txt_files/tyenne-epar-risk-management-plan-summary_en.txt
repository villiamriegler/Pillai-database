Centralised 
Chemical class 
Immunosuppressants, 
inhibitors/  Anti-human 
monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) sub-class 
Interleukin 
Summary of mode of action 
Tocilizumab  binds  specifically  to  both  soluble  and  membrane-
bound  IL-6  receptors  (sIL-6R  and  mIL-6R).  Tocilizumab  has 
been shown to  inhibit sIL-6R and mIL-6R-mediated signalling. 
IL-6  is  a  pleiotropic  pro-inflammatory  cytokine  produced  by  a 
variety  of  cell  types  including  T-  and  B-cells,  monocytes  and 
fibroblasts.  IL-6  is  involved  in  diverse  physiological  processes 
such as T-cell activation, induction of immunoglobulin secretion, 
induction of hepatic acute phase protein synthesis and stimulation 
of hemopoiesis. IL-6 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of 
diseases  including  inflammatory  diseases,  osteoporosis  and 
neoplasia. 
Important information about its composition  
Tocilizumab is a humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody against 
the  human  IL-6  receptor  produced  in  Chinese  Hamster  Ovary 
(CHO)  cells  by  recombinant  deoxyribonucleic  acid  (DNA) 
technology

EU Risk Management Plan 0.2 
MSB11456 (Tocilizumab) 
Version Date: 20-Jun-2023 
Part II: Safety Specification 
Part II: Module SI - Epidemiology of the indication(s) and target population(s) 
SI.1 Rheumatoid Arthritis 
Incidence 
In  adults  aged  18  years  and  older,  the  overall  incidence  of  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA)  is  45  per 
100,000 person years (PY) (Gabriel et al. 2003). 
Prevalence 
The overall prevalence of RA in most industrialized countries is between 0.3% and 1% (Woolf 
2003);  14/1000  female,  7.4/1000  male  population  (Gabriel  et  al.  1999).  Rates  are  lower  in 
developing countries and also relatively low in Japan (up to 2.4/1000 male and 2.0 to 7.0/1000 
female) (Woolf 2003). 
Demographics of the population in the proposed indication and risk factors for the disease 
Approximately 73% of patients with RA are female (Gabriel et al. 2003). Age and sex distribution 
is largely similar across American and European populations (Abdel-Nasser et al.1997). Incidence 
and prevalence of RA rises with increasing age. Socioeconomic factors may influence the time 
between symptom presentation and diagnosis but not risk of RA. 
Genetic susceptibility is a major determinant of susceptibility to RA; the majority of individuals 
who develop RA are Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) –DR4 or –DR1 or both. 
The main existing treatment options 
Numerous medications  are available for the treatment of RA, which have varying efficacy and 
safety profiles in the treatment of the disease. 
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used in the treatment of RA but 
provide only symptomatic relief. 
Conventional  disease-modifying  anti-rheumatic  drugs  (DMARDs),  for  example  methotrexate 
(MTX), have been the cornerstone of RA treatment for many years and are recommended for early 
treatment as there is evidence that these agents may maintain or improve physical function and 
retard radiographic joint damage. These conventional DMARDs, in particular MTX, are often used 
in  combination with  biologic DMARDs (see below).  However, treatment  is  limited by toxicity 
and/or ineffectiveness. 
Several biologic DMARDs targeting the cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) have been 
developed, but approximately  30% of patients  fail  to  respond to these therapies.  In addition  to 
biologics targeting the interleukin (IL)-6 pathway and TNFα, biologics with different mechanisms 
of action have also been approved for the treatment of RA, including those that target cytokine 
pathways such as IL-1 inhibitors; CTLA4 to inhibit the full activation of T-cells; and anti-CD20 
which depletes B-cells. Small molecules targeting Janus kinase have also been approved for the 
Page 12 of 148 
 
 
 
EU Risk Management Plan 0.2 
MSB11456 (Tocilizumab) 
Version Date: 20-Jun-2023 
treatment of RA. These immunomodulatory treatments are not approved for use in combination 
with each other. 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including mortality 
and morbidity 
Mortality: Compared with the general population, mortality is increased in patients with RA (SMR 
1.27 – 2.03) (Björnadal et al. 2002; Gabriel et al. 2003; Young et al. 2007). Published mortality 
rates from large observational studies in RA patients not treated with biologic DMARDs range 
from 3.08 to 5.18 events per 100 PY. Corresponding mortality rates in RA patients treated with 
anti-TNF therapies were lower (range 0.70 to 1.61 events per 100 PY) 
Discussion  of  the  possible  stages  of  disease  progression  to  be  treated:  Early  RA  is  typically 
defined as having RA symptoms of less than 2 years duration, however, it is not uncommon for 
early RA to be defined as symptoms in < 1, 3, or 5 years (Scott, 2007). 
Outcome of the (untreated) target disease: Patients may initially present arthritis symptoms, but 
cannot immediately be classified into RA. A review of early arthritis cohorts revealed that 13% to 
54%  of  patients  initially  classified  as  having  undifferentiated  arthritis  went  on  to  have  a 
classification  of  RA  after  1  year  of  follow-up,  while  21%  to  87%  had  persistent  arthritis  that 
remained unclassifiable (Hazes and Luime 2011). 
Important comorbidities 
As RA is associated with inflammation and changes of immunity, various comorbidities may be 
present. Comorbidities common among early RA patients include cardiovascular disease, anaemia, 
and depression. Coronary artery disease is the major cause of death in RA patients (SMR 1.79) 
(Björnadal  et  al.  2002).  Gastrointestinal  (GI) perforations,  infections,  malignancies,  and 
cardiovascular disease are leading causes of increased mortality and morbidity in this population. 
Given the complexities of interstitial lung disease (ILD), it is a well-recognized comorbidity to be 
monitored in the context of serious and opportunistic infections. 
SI.2 Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis 
Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) is a subset of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) that is 
characterized by the presence of arthritis and quotidian fever, accompanied by one or more of the 
following: rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly, and serositis. 
Incidence 
In  Europe,  incidence  of  sJIA  has  been  reported  as  0.4-0.9  per  100,000  (Moe  and  Rygg  1998; 
Huemer et al. 2001; Bernston et al. 2003; Kaipianinen Seppanen and Savolainen 2001; Pruunslid 
et al. 2007; Modesto et al. 2010). 
Prevalence 
The prevalence of JIA in Europe has been reported as between 3.5-86/100,000 (Prieur et al. 1987; 
Gare and Fasth 1992; Modesto et al. 2010), and sJIA accounts for 6%-15% of children with JIA 
seen in clinics in North America and Europe (Cassidy et al. 2005; Woo 2006). 
Page 13 of 148 
 
 
EU Risk Management Plan 0.2 
MSB11456 (Tocilizumab) 
Version Date: 20-Jun-2023 
Demographics of the population in the proposed indication and risk factors for the disease 
sJIA occurs throughout  childhood, with  a peak  onset  between 0  -  4  years (Ravelli  and Martini 
2007; Svantesson et al.1983; Gare and Fasth 1992; Bernston et al. 2003). Both sexes are equally 
affected (Cassidy and Petty 2005; Laxer and Schneider 1998; Symmons et al.1996). 
The Main Existing Treatment Options 
The initial treatment of sJIA varies depending on the extent of systemic symptoms and the number 
of joints with active arthritis. 
Various  non-biologic  treatments  for  sJIA  include  NSAIDs,  corticosteroids  (CS)  (oral  or 
intravenous  [IV])  and  DMARDs  (such  as  MTX  or  leflunomide).  MTX  can  be  dosed  orally  or 
subcutaneously  for  sJIA.  However,  its  use  in  sJIA  is  limited  by  its  efficacy  and  safety  profile. 
Adverse events (AEs) can include elevated liver function test results, anaemia, and teratogenicity. 
Based on clinical trial data, there is a lack of evidence to indicate that MTX is superior to placebo 
in the treatment of sJIA due to minimal effect on systemic features and active arthritis (Woo et al. 
2000).  Corticosteroids  are  often  administered  orally  or  intravenously  to  control  severe  disease. 
However, the AEs associated with the use of CS are numerous and include salt and water retention, 
weight gain, hypertension, peptic ulcer disease, mood swings, and bruising easily. Long-term use 
of CS is associated with complications such as osteoporosis, adrenal gland suppression, avascular 
necrosis,  cataracts,  lowered  resistance  to  serious  infection,  insulin  resistance,  osteopenia,  and 
growth  failure.  All  of  these  factors  contribute  to  long-term  disability.  Thus,  the  use  of  these 
medications in sJIA is limited by their side effect profile. 
Anti-cytokine biologic therapies are highly effective in treating sJIA, and both canakinumab (anti-
IL-1β) and tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R) are approved for the treatment of sJIA. Anakinra (anti-IL-
1R), approved for adult RA, is also commonly used to treat sJIA. Patients may also receive other 
RA biologics, including aTNF inhibitors, although these are generally considered less effective 
than the other anti-cytokine therapies. NSAIDs, MTX, and CS are often used concomitantly with 
biologic therapies, and can be used concomitantly with tocilizumab. 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including mortality 
and morbidity 
Mortality: sJIA is associated with an increased risk of mortality compared with children with other 
types of JIA (Woo 2006) Almost two-thirds of all deaths that occur in JIA, occur in children with 
sJIA (Wallace and Levinson 1991). As reported for a variety of JIA cohorts from the 1970s and 
1980s, mortality was 14% for sJIA and 3% for JIA (Laxer and Schneider 1998). Currently, JIA-
related mortality is estimated at less than 1% in Europe (Cassidy and Petty 2005). 
Important comorbidities 
Important  comorbid  conditions  are  serious  infections,  impaired  skeletal  development  in  sJIA, 
Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS), and altered immune status.

Based on (a) pJIA proportion of 27%-37% among all JIA in Europe (Bernston et al. 2003; Solau-
Gervais et al. 2010; Nordal et al. 2011) and (b) JIA incidence average of approximately 18 per 
100,000 (Bernston et al. 2003; Kaipianinen-Seppänen and Savolainen 2001; Danner et al. 2006; 
Pruunsild et al. 2007) and (c) Estonia incidences from study, Oligoarthritis of 11.7 per 100,000, 
and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) RF positive 4.4 per 100,000 (Pruunsild et al. 
2007). 
Projected worldwide incidence = 0.3 - 7.4 per 100,000. 
Worldwide  incidence  approximately  33%  of  JIA  (Ravelli  and  Martini  2007)  and  worldwide 
incidence 0.8 to 22.6 per 100,000 (Manners and Bower 2002). 
Prevalence 
Projected European prevalence for indicator conditions = 4.2 - 5.7 per 100,000. 
Based on (a) pJIA proportion of 27%-37% among all JIA in Europe (Bernston et al. 2003; Solau-
Gervais et al. 2010; Nordal et al. 2011) and (b) JIA prevalence 15.7 cases per 100,000 (Solau-
Gervais et al. 2010) 
Projected worldwide prevalence = 2.3 to 131.4 per 100,000. 
Worldwide indicator ~34% of JIA (Ravelli and Martini 2007) and worldwide prevalence range of 
7 to 401 per 100,000 (Manners and Bower 2002). 
Demographics of the population in the proposed indication and risk factors for the disease 
Oligoarthritis typically has an onset in children aged 2-4 years and predominately affects females 
(Dannecker and Quartier 2009; Ravelli and Martini 2007). Polyarthritis RF+ occurs primarily in 
adolescent  girls  (Dannecker  and  Quartier  2009;  Ravelli  and  Martini  2007).  The  onset  of 
Polyarthritis  RF-  has  two  peaks  at  2  -  4  years  and  6  -  12  years  (Ravelli  and  Martini  2007). 
Predominance of males with oligoarthritis and sJIA was found in studies from India, Turkey, and 
Singapore (Aggarwal and Misra 1994; Ozen et al. 1998). South Africa reported equal sex ratio for 
JIA (Haffejee et al. 1984). 
The Main Existing Treatment Options 
Main treatment options include NSAIDs, MTX, and CS. NSAIDs are effective for many patients. 
If NSAIDs are ineffective, second-line medications may be considered such as MTX and CS. 
Methotrexate can be dosed orally or subcutaneously for pJIA. Its use in pJIA is limited by its safety 
profile, which can include elevated liver function test results, anaemia, and teratogenicity. 
Corticosteroids  are  often  administered  orally  or  intravenously  to  control  severe  disease.  In 
addition, intra-articular steroid injections can also be utilized at the time of disease onset or during 
disease  course.  CS  have  a  more  limited  role  as  systemic  agents  in  the  treatment  of  pJIA  as 
compared with sJIA.

EU Risk Management Plan 0.2 
MSB11456 (Tocilizumab) 
Version Date: 20-Jun-2023 
NSAIDs, MTX, and CS can continue to be used concomitantly with tocilizumab in the treatment 
of pJIA. Leflunomide, a reversible inhibitor of de novo pyrimidine synthesis has also been reported 
to be effective in children with pJIA. 
Biological  agents  (other  than  tocilizumab)  have  provided  therapeutic  options  for  patients  with 
moderate  to  severe  pJIA;  these  options  include  etanercept,  adalimumab,  and  abatacept.  Two 
biologic agents are not used concomitantly. 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including mortality 
and morbidity 
Mortality: JIA-related mortality is estimated at less than 1% in Europe (Cassidy and Petty 2005). 
Mortality  estimates  specifically  for  the  subtypes  oligoarthritis  and  polyarthritis  JIA  are  not 
available.  However,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  mortality  rate  for  these  subtypes  is  higher,  because 
together the oligoarticular JIA and pJIA subtypes constitute 40% - 53% of all JIA and generally 
patients  with  oligoarthritis  have the best  prognosis  while those with polyarthritis  have a varied 
prognosis;  the  worst  outcomes  are  associated  with  joint  erosions  and  serious  complications  of 
iridocyclitis (Guillaume et al. 2000; Ravelli and Martini 2007). Despite oligoarticular JIA and pJIA 
accounting for the majority of cases in JIA they have a much lower risk of mortality compared to 
sJIA, which has mortality of 0.6% (Hashkes et al. 2010), which constitutes 10%-20% of all JIA. 
The Dutch and Germany registry of JIA patients treated with etanercept reported no deaths among 
patients with oligoarticular JIA and pJIA (Prince et al. 2009; Horneff et al. 2009). 
Important comorbidities 
Important comorbidities include uveitis/iridocyclitis, osteopenia and osteoporosis, and leg-length 
discrepancy, contractures, and growth retardation. 
SI.4 Giant Cell Arteritis 
Incidence 
The incidence of Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) appears to have a geographic gradient; the disease is 
more frequently found in high latitudes. In the Northern hemisphere, there is a significant increase 
in both incidence and prevalence with increasingly northerly latitudes. The highest incidence rates 
have been reported in Scandinavia and the United Kingdom at 20 to 30 cases per 100,000 people 
aged 50 years or older. By contrast, studies from Southern Europe have consistently reported lower 
incidence rates than those from Scandinavia at 7 to 10 cases per 100,000 people aged 50 years or 
older (González-Gay et al. 2009; Watts and Scott 2014). 
Prevalence 
The sex ratio and incidence appear to vary. Studies from Northern and Western Europe report that 
women are 2 to 3 times more likely to be diagnosed with GCA than men (Watts and Scott 2014). 
In the study by Petri et al. (2015), the incidence in women was reported as twice that in men in a 
UK-based patient population and within the reported range for studies in Northern and Western 
Europe.  The  ratio  of  females  to  males  diagnosed  with  GCA  is  lower  in  studies  from  Southern 
Europe and can be close to 1:1 in other countries (Petri et al. 2015).

EU Risk Management Plan 0.2 
MSB11456 (Tocilizumab) 
Version Date: 20-Jun-2023 
Demographics of the population in the proposed indication and risk factors for the disease 
GCA  primarily  affects  adults  50  years  of  age  or  older,  and  the  risk  for  GCA  increases  with 
advancing  age,  with  the  highest  rates  observed  in  individuals  between  70  and  79  years  of  age 
(González-Gay et al. 2009; Petri et al. 2015). In women, GCA incidence peaks from age 70 to 
79 years. In men, GCA incidence increases but plateaus, with the peak at 80 years and older. 
Susceptibility to GCA has been associated with an increased incidence of HLA-DR4 and HLA-
DRB1*0401 (González-Gay et al. 2000). Other genetic factors, particularly those involved in the 
immune and inflammatory pathways, are likely also important in the susceptibility to GCA. 
The Main Existing Treatment Options 
Glucocorticoids (steroids) are the cornerstone of treatment for GCA (Mukhtyar et al. 2009; Broder 
et  al.  2016).  Oral  steroids  (usually  prednisone/prednisolone)  are  initiated  at  a  dose  of  40  to 
60 mg/day  if  a  diagnosis  of  GCA  is  strongly  suspected  or  confirmed  by  biopsy  or  imaging 
(Mukhtyar et al. 2009). Patients with complicated GCA, for example those with evolving vision 
loss or history of amaurosis fugax, are often treated with IV methylprednisolone 500 mg to 1 g 
daily for 3 days (Mazlumzadeh et al. 2006). Once the clinical signs and symptoms of GCA have 
subsided, typically after 2 to 4 weeks, the steroid dose is gradually tapered. Introduction of anti-
platelet agents should be considered carefully owing to the risk of acute myocardial infarction, 
cerebral ischemia, hypertensive crisis, psychosis, and hyperosmolar decompensation of diabetes 
(Yates et al. 2014). 
Despite their effectiveness at inducing remission of systemic inflammation and preventing acute 
damage  (e.g.,  blindness),  this  comes  with  a  high  toxicity  burden,  with  approximately  80%  of 
patients suffering GC-related adverse clinical events at 10-year follow-up (Proven et al. 2003). In 
addition,  GC  are  not  as  effective  at  maintaining  remission,  with  many  patients  (up  to  50%) 
experiencing  relapse  or  flare-up  of  symptoms  during  reduction  or  discontinuation  of 
glucocorticoids  (Proven  et  al.  2003).  Tocilizumab  has  been  approved  after  demonstrating 
improved  induction  of  remission  compared  to  steroids  alone  and  maintenance  of  steroid  free 
remission  resulting  in  reduced  cumulative  steroid  dose.  Other  agents,  including  azathioprine, 
cyclophosphamide, MTX, infliximab, and etanercept, have shown conflicting or no evidence of 
benefit in the treatment of GCA. In spite of the paucity of evidence, MTX is used inconsistently 
as standard of care for glucocorticoid-sparing in relapsing patients. 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including mortality 
and morbidity 
Outcome  of  the  (untreated)  target  disease:  The  prognosis  for  patients  with  untreated  GCA  is 
extremely  poor,  with  many  patients  suffering  vision  loss,  or  death  from  myocardial  infarction, 
stroke, or dissecting aortic aneurysm (Foroozan et al. 2003; González-Gay et al. 2000) 
Important comorbidities 
GCA  patients  in  the  United  Kingdom  (UK)  are  reported  as  commonly  experiencing  aortic 
aneurysm, large vessel complications, polymyalgia rheumatica, visual disturbances, facial pain, 
osteoporosis,  hypokalaemia,  and  various  infections  such  as  oral/oesophageal  thrush  and  herpes 
zoster (Petri et al. 2015).

SI.5 Cytokine Release Syndrome 
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a potentially life-threatening symptom complex, caused by 
the  excessive  release  of  cytokines  by  immune  effector  or  target  cells  during  an  exaggerated 
immune  response.  CRS  can  be  triggered  by  infections  or  by  therapeutic  interventions,  which 
activate the immune response, with the extent of severity most likely related to the degree and 
duration  of  immune  activation.  Severe  or  life-threatening  CRS  is  a  medical  emergency,  and  if 
unsuccessfully managed, can result in significant morbidity or mortality. 
Incidence 
In  ZUMA-11  (Phase  2),  CRS  occurred  in  93%  of  the  101  subjects  treated  with  axicabtagene 
ciloleucel. Of these subjects who experienced CRS, Grade 1 or 2 occurred in 80% and Grade 3 or 
higher occurred in 12%. 
Out of 203 patients infused with tisagenlecleucel across Studies2 B22023, B2205J4 and C22015, a 
total of 141 patients experienced CRS of any grade. Of the 141 patients, 50 required intervention 
with tocilizumab. Demographics (ZUMA-1; Phase 2): 
– There was no significant  difference in  incidence of CRS observed in  subjects  based on their 
performance status (i.e., Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group), age, or sex. 
– Of the 101 subjects in ZUMA-1 (Phase 2), the age of the subjects ranged from 24 years to 77 
years, with a median age of 58 years. 
– Of these 101 subjects, 68 subjects were male and 33 were female. 
Demographics of the population in the proposed indication and risk factors for the disease  
Based  on  Studies  B2202,  B2205J,  and  C2201,  the  efficacy  population  for  the  tisagenlecleucel 
cohort included 28 males and 23 females (total 51 patients) of median age 17 years (range, 3–68 
years). 
Patient factors:  
In some reports, the severity of CRS and elevation of serum cytokines have been related to disease 
burden,  with  higher  disease  burden  predicting  more  toxicity  presumably  because  this  leads  to 
higher levels of T cell activation (Almasbak et al. 2016; Brudno and Kochenderfer 2016). Maude 
et al. (2014) reported that the baseline disease burden (the percentage of blast cells in bone marrow 
before infusion) correlated with the severity of the CRS; a higher disease burden was significantly 
associated with severe CRS (p=0.002), (Maude et al. 2014). CRS associated with adoptive T cell 
therapies has been consistently associated with elevated interferon gamma (IFNγ), IL 6, and TNFα

levels, and increases in IL 2, granulocyte macrophage–colony stimulating factor (GM CSF), IL 
10, IL 8, IL 5, and fractalkine (Kalos et al. 2011; Kochenderfer et al. 2012; Grupp et al. 2013; 
Davila et al. 2014). CRS has been known to be associated with end organ dysfunction (e.g., hepatic, 
renal, cardiac, pulmonary). In addition, worsening of underlying organ pathologies can occur in 
the setting of CRS. 
Dose-related (ZUMA-1; Phase 2): 
– Subjects who received product with total T cell numbers greater than the population median had 
a higher incidence of Grade 3 or higher CRS (17.6% vs 8.0%). 
– Subjects dosed with product potency (defined as IFN-γ production) greater than the population 
median had higher Grade 3 or higher CRS (20.0% vs 5.9%). 
The Main Existing Treatment Options 
Currently  only  tocilizumab  is  approved  in  the  European  Union  for  the  treatment  of  chimeric 
antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-induced CRS.  
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including mortality 
and morbidity 
The cytokines implicated in CRS may be directly produced by the infused CAR T cells, as well as 
other  immune  cells  such  as  macrophages  that  might  produce  large  amounts  of  cytokines  in 
response to cytokines produced by the infused CAR T cells. In contrast to neurologic AEs, Grade 
3 or higher CRS was more robustly associated with a broad array of cytokine that can be produced 
by activated myeloid and T cells rather than with the CAR T cell levels post-treatment. A wide 
variety  of  cytokines  including  IL-6,  interferon  γ,  TNFα,  IL-2,  IL-2  receptorα  (IL2Rα),  IL  1 
receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), IL-8, and IL-10 are elevated in the serum of patients experiencing 
fever,  tachycardia,  hypotension,  and  other  toxicities  after  CAR  T-cell  infusions  (Brudno  and 
Kochenderfer 2016). The association of CRS with several of these cytokines and chemokines is 
likely related to their known functional activities. IL 6 and TNFα mediate vascular permeability, 
hypotension, fever, and tissue damage (Sprague and Khalil 2009); chemokines such as IL-8 trigger 
mobilization  and  redistribution  of  activated  immune  cells  throughout  the  body  (Griffith  et  al. 
2014);  and  IL-1ra  and  IL-2Rα  are  indicative  of  macrophage  and  general  immune  activation 
(Ravelli et al. 2012). Levels of these cytokines decreased by 1 month post CAR T-cell infusion, a 
finding consistent with the timing and reversibility of CRS. In ZUMA-1 (Phase 2), CRS occurred 
in 93% of patients, 12% of whom experienced Grade 3 or higher (severe, life-threatening and fatal) 
CRS. 
CAR  T-related  AEs,  including  fever,  malaise,  fatigue,  anorexia,  myalgia,  arthralgia,  nausea, 
vomiting,  diarrhoea,  headache,  skin  rashes,  tachypnoea,  hypoxemia,  tachycardia,  hypotension, 
increased or decreased cardiac output, renal impairment, elevated transaminases and bilirubin, and 
bleeding, can cause severe distress and require medical intervention. In the short-term CRS will 
impact the patient’s quality of life although this is short lived and likely to be confined to the period 
of  hospitalization  with  limited  long-term  effects.  In  severe  cases,  CRS  related  serious  adverse 
events (SAEs) may be associated with death.

SI.6 COVID-19 
Incidence 
Coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19)  is  an  infectious  disease  caused  by  the  most  recently 
discovered coronavirus  named novel  severe acute  respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) (WHO 
2020a). As of 04 Oct 2021 (ie, based on WHO the most accurate numbers related to the DLP), 
approximately  237.9  million  confirmed  cases  of  COVID-19  had  been  reported  globally  by  the 
WHO. The United States had 44.0 million confirmed cases followed by India with approximately 
33.9 million confirmed cases, and Brazil with 21.5 million confirmed cases. In Europe, over 70.9 
million cases were confirmed. The UK, France, and Italy were the most affected nations in Europe 
with over 8, 6 and 4 million confirmed cases, respectively (WHO 2020a). 
Although  most  patients  have  mild  symptoms  and  good  prognosis,  COVID-19  can  develop  to 
severe  illnesses  including  pneumonia,  pulmonary  oedema,  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome, 
multiple organ failure, or death (Li et al. 2020). 
According  to  the  data  from  the  European  Centre  for  Disease  Prevention  and  Control  (ECDC), 
pooled data from 25 countries for Week 25 (27 June 2021) showed that there were 6 patients per 
100 000 population in hospital due to COVID-19. According to pooled weekly hospital admissions 
data from 18 countries, new admissions were 1 per 100 000 population (ECDC 2021). 
Demographics of the population in the proposed indication and risk factors for the disease 
According  to  WHO,  SARS-CoV-2  causing  COVID-19,  infects  people  of  all  ages.  However, 
evidence  suggests  that  older  people  (i.e.,  people  over  60  years  old)  and  those  with  underlying 
medical  conditions  (such  as  cardiovascular  disease,  diabetes,  chronic  respiratory  disease,  and 
cancer)  are  at  a  higher  risk  of  severe  COVID-19  disease.  The  risk  of  severe  disease  gradually 
increases with age starting from around 40 years (WHO 2020c). A meaningful number of cases of 
COVID-19  have  been  described  in  children.  A  study  retrospectively  enrolled  366  hospitalized 
children with respiratory symptoms from January 7 to 15, 2020 in China. COVID-19 was detected 
in  6  cases  (1.6%),  4  of  which  showed  typical  viral  pneumonia  patterns,  as  assessed 
radiographically  (Liu  et  al.  2020).  Another  report  from  the  Centre  for  Disease  Control  (CDC) 
showed that the number of cases of COVID-19  in  the United States  between June and  August 
2020,  was  highest  in  the  age  group  20–29  years,  accounting  for  more  than  20%  of  the  total 
(Venkatesan  2020).  Among  the  laboratory-confirmed  COVID-19–associated  hospitalizations 
Page 20 of 148 
 
 
reported through COVID-NET in the US, the cumulative rate of hospitalization as of 3 July 2021 
was reported to be: 100.4 per 100,000 (for age <18 years), 348 per 100,000 (for ≥18 years), 845.8 
per 100,000 (for 50-64 years), and 1703.2 per 100,000 population for patients aged 65 years and 
older (COVID-NET).

Clinical Management of COVID-19 
Prevention 
Up  to  the  RMP  DLP  (04-Oct-2021),  four  vaccines  have  been  granted  conditional  marketing 
authorization  in  the  European  Union:  the  Pfizer/BioNTech  vaccine  (Comirnaty)  was  granted 
conditional MA on 21 December 2020 for the prevention of COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of 
age and older and, as of 04 October 2021, is approved for individuals aged 12 years and older. 
Subsequent  conditional  MAs  were  granted  to  the  Moderna  vaccine  (Spikevax)  and  the 
AstraZeneca/Oxford University vaccine (Vaxzevria) in January 2021 and to the Janssen COVID-
19 vaccine on 11 March 2021 for the prevention of COVID-19 in individuals 18 years of age or 
older. 
Global efforts are underway to prioritize vaccination for adults most vulnerable to COVID-19. The 
long-term protection afforded by these vaccines is currently unknown. 
Treatments 
Treatment options for COVID-19 have been evolving since the pandemic was declared in March 
2020.  Initially,  treatment  was  largely  supportive  in  the  outpatient  or  hospitalized  setting  and 
included  the  use  of  anti-pyretics,  fluids,  antibiotics  if  bacterial  secondary  or  co-infection  was 
suspected, and supplemental oxygen. 
Of  note,  systemic  corticosteroids  were  not  routinely  recommended  until  emerging  data  from 
clinical trials, including the RECOVERY trial for the dexamethasone cohort (Horby et al. 2021) 
indicated  a  mortality  benefit  among  patients  requiring  supplemental  oxygen  or  mechanical 
ventilation.  The  RECOVERY  trial  demonstrated  that  dexamethasone  resulted  in  an  absolute 
reduction in mortality of 2.8% (22.9% for dexamethasone vs. 25.7% for Usual Care; age-adjusted 
rate  ratio,  0.83  [95%  CI:  0.75,  93]).  The  benefit  was  greatest  for  patients  who  were  receiving 
invasive  mechanical  ventilation  at  the  time  of  randomization  with  mortality  of  29.3%  for 
dexamethasone versus 41.4% for Usual Care (rate ratio, 0.64 [95% CI: 0.51-0.81]) (Horby et al. 
2021). The European Medicines Agency (EMA) endorsed use of dexamethasone in COVID-19 
patients on oxygen or mechanical ventilation on 18 September 2020 (EMA Webpage 2020). 
Several  other  therapies  for  the  treatment  of  severe  or  critical  COVID-19  have  been  granted 
conditional approvals/Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) globally. 
Remdesivir (RDV), a broad-spectrum antiviral, was granted conditional approval by the EMA on 
25  June  2020  and  is  indicated  for  use  in  adults  and  adolescents  from  12  years  of  age  with 
pneumonia  who  require  supplemental  oxygen.  The  recommendation  was  mainly  based  on  data 
from Study NIAID-ACTT-1, sponsored by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious

Diseases  (NIAID),  plus  supporting  data  from  other  studies  of  RDV.  Study  NIAID-ACTT-1,  a 
double-blind,  placebo-controlled  Phase  III  trial,  showed  that  treatment  with  RDV  resulted  in 
clinically meaningful improvements across multiple outcome assessments (including shortening 
the time to recovery) compared with placebo in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (Beigel et 
al. 2020). 
On 29 April 2021, the EMA announced they had begun evaluation of a marketing authorization 
application to extend the use of the JAK inhibitor baricitinib (Olumiant) to include treatment of 
COVID-19 in hospitalized patients from 10 years of age who require supplemental oxygen. The 
accelerated  assessment  is  based  on  results  from  the  two  Phase  III  studies  of  baricitinib  in 
hospitalized patients (COV-BARRIER and ACTT-2). However, uncertainty remains around the 
use of baricitinib with  concomitant corticosteroids,  and the Phase III COV-BARRIER  study in 
hospitalized COVID-19 patients failed to meet its primary endpoint, a difference in the proportion 
of participants progressing to the first occurrence of non-invasive ventilation (including high flow 
oxygen)  or  invasive  mechanical  ventilation  (including  extracorporeal  membrane  oxygenation 
[ECMO])  or  death  by  Day  28  (Lilly  and  Incyte  Press  Release  2021).  Another  Phase  III  study 
(ACTT-4) comparing baricitinib+RDV to dexamethasone+RDV was recently halted for futility 
(NIH Press Release 2021). 
On 24 June 2021, the FDA issued an EUA for Actemra (tocilizumab) for the treatment of COVID-
19 in hospitalized patients and paediatric patients (2  years of age and older) who are receiving 
systemic corticosteroids and require supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical 
ventilation, or ECMO. 
Medical Need 
Despite  ongoing  advances  in  the  development  of  vaccines  and  treatments  for  COVID-19, 
significant unmet medical need remains in the treatment of COVID-19, especially in hospitalized 
patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who may progress to multiple organ failure and death 
and  often  require  extensive  healthcare  resources,  including  ICU  admission  and  mechanical 
ventilation. 
Up to the RMP DLP (04-Oct-2021), the only treatment, which has been granted conditional MA 
for  hospitalized  COVID-19  patients  in  the  EU  is  remdesivir;  however,  consistent  benefits  in 
mortality, need for mechanical ventilation and duration of hospital stay have not been observed 
across different studies (Beigel et al. 2020; WHO Solidarity Trial Consortium 2021). Additionally, 
the  EMA  endorsed  use  of  dexamethasone  in  COVID-19  patients  on  oxygen  or  mechanical 
ventilation on 18 September 2020 (EMA Webpage 2020).

Key safety findings from non-clinical studies and relevance to human usage: 
Toxicity 
Local Tolerance Studies 
Multiple-dose studies in primates, in which tocilizumab was given IV in high doses, showed that 
tocilizumab  was  well  tolerated.  Additional  local  IV,  SC,  or  intramuscular  tolerance  studies  in 
rabbits also showed excellent local tolerability of tocilizumab and its formulation excipients. 
Relevance to human usage: Yes  
Discussion: Tolerance to tocilizumab has been confirmed by clinical data. 
Reproductive Toxicity Studies and Risk of Abortion  
Tocilizumab was not teratogenic in an embryo-foetal toxicity study in cynomolgus monkey at a 
daily dose of 50 mg/kg/day (highest dose) associated with a high systemic cumulative exposure of 
> 100 above the expected human efficacious concentration. A higher rate of abortion was however 
noted  in  this  dose  group  compared  with  the  placebo  and  other  low  dose  groups.  The  abortion 
incidence was within the historical background for the cynomolgus monkey in captivity (Boot et 
al. 1985; Vogel and Bee 1999; Hendrie et. al. 1996) and the individual cases of abortions/embryo-
foetal  death  did  not  show  any  consistent  relationship  to  dosing  or  duration  of  dosing  with 
tocilizumab. IL-6 does not appear to be a critical cytokine for embryo-foetal development since 
IL-6 deficient mice are fertile and their offspring show no abnormal phenotype. In addition, the 
difference in abortion rate in the cynomolgus monkey study was only marginally higher in the high 
dose group compared to the other treatment groups. Transfer of a murine analogue of tocilizumab 
into the milk of lactating mice has been observed.  
Preclinical data in mice do not suggest an effect on fertility in mice treated with a mouse IL-6R 
surrogate  antibody  for  tocilizumab.  With  this  antibody,  there  was  also  no  evidence  for  IL-6-
inhibition-related  effects  on  pre-natal  and  postnatal  development,  including  on  developing 
immune  function  in  the  F1  generation  treated  transplacentally.  Similarly,  there  were  no 
toxicologically relevant  effects  noted on fertility, pre- and postnatal  development,  and immune 
function in a combined fertility and pre- and postnatal development study in IL-6 knockout mice. 
Relevance to human usage: Unknown  
Discussion: Although IL-6 does not seem to be a critical cytokine for either foetal growth or the 
immunological control of the maternal/foetal interface, the relevance of this observation for human 
pregnancy  is  unknown.  However,  a  possible  relation  to  tocilizumab  cannot  be  excluded  as 
preclinical data suggests an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. Therefore, tocilizumab may 
represent  a  potential  risk  to  pregnant  women.  No  teratogenic  effects  have  been  identified  with 
tocilizumab. 
Single- and Multiple-Dose Toxicity Studies  
Toxicity  studies  have  shown  tocilizumab  to  be  well  tolerated  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  when 
administered in an IV single dose study up to 100 mg/kg multiple-dose study up to 50 mg/kg/day 
for 4 weeks or at an IV dose of 100 mg/kg/week for 6 months. Although the exposure in these 
Page 23 of 148

Version Date: 20-Jun-2023 
studies exceeds the targeted human average efficacious concentrations by factors of 125 (4-week 
study) or 39 (6-month study), no adverse effects that would be considered clinically significant in 
man were seen in the clinical pathology investigations, the histopathological evaluation, or in any 
additional studies. Because tocilizumab is targeted at autoimmune disease, it is important to note 
that  there  were  no  treatment  effects  on  the  morphology  of  primary  or  secondary  organs  of  the 
immune  system.  Two  toxicology  findings  were  observed  in  these  experiments  that  warranted 
closer  scrutiny.  These  included  reductions  of  ANCs  and  B-cell  counts  in  the  peripheral  blood. 
However,  analysis  showed  that  the  reduction  of  ANC  was  mild  and  not  associated  with  bone 
marrow manifestations or changes in  neutrophil function. Similarly, the  minor reduction in  the 
CD20+ B-cell ratio observed in cynomolgus monkey studies with up to 4-weeks of exposure was 
not associated with detectable alterations of the tissue B-cell compartments in lymphoid organs.  
Relevance to human usage: Yes  
Discussion: These findings have been adequately addressed in the clinical development program 
of the originator. 
Malignancies  
A carcinogenicity study of tocilizumab has not been conducted. As tocilizumab does not bind to 
rodent  IL-6R,  conventional  long-term  carcinogenicity  studies  in  rats  or  mice  are  thus, 
inappropriate to assess a function-associated carcinogenic potential of tocilizumab. A standard test 
set of in vitro genotoxicity studies conducted with tocilizumab has shown no evidence of genotoxic 
liabilities. IgG macromolecules do not penetrate cell walls or cell membranes and therefore, do 
not have direct interactions with cellular DNA. Because of this, IgG1 monoclonal antibodies do 
not  have  an  intrinsic  carcinogenic  potential,  and  thus,  such  tests  are  not  considered  to  be  of 
relevance for a carcinogenic risk assessment of antibodies.  
IL-6  is  recognized  as  one  of  the  most  potent  autocrine  growth  factors  in  the  pathogenesis  of 
numerous cancers, including thyroid carcinomas (Russell et al. 2004), prostate and ovarian cancer 
(Xiao et al. 2004; Hefler et al. 2003) and, in particular, hematologic malignancies such as multiple 
myeloma (Hilbert et al. 1995; Siegall et al.1990). Recently published data further demonstrated 
the contributing role of the sIL-6R transignalling in  a colon  cancer model  (Becker  et  al.  2004; 
Becker et al. 2005; Landi et al. 2003), suggesting that under conditions of chronic inflammation, 
IL-6  may  contribute  to  malignant  progression  and  resistance  of  various  malignancies  (through 
activation of gp130), which do not per se express the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor.  
While  the  direct  stimulatory  activity  of  IL-6  has  long  been  recognized,  recent  studies  have 
identified and characterized the role of IL-6 in the regulation of the signal transducer and activator 
of transcription 3 (STAT3), its critical role in tumour progression, and the negative interference of 
STAT3-regulated gene products in tumour immunosurveillance (Yu 2007). Not only does STAT3, 
constitutively  activated  by  malignant  cells,  inhibit  the  expression  of  mediators  necessary  for 
effective immune activation against tumour cells, but it also actively promotes the production of 
immunosuppressive factors that lead to a blockade of efficient anti-tumour response in situ.  
Recently  published  data  demonstrated  that  the  functional  maturation  of  dendritic  cells  in  the 
tumour environment, which is necessary for an effective activation of an anti-tumour response, is 
blocked by tumour-secreted IL-6 (Park et al. 2004), an effect which significantly contributes to the 
widely observed clinical phenomenon of tumour tolerance rather than rejection. Conversely, the 
Page 24 of 148 
 
 
EU Risk Management Plan 0.2 
MSB11456 (Tocilizumab) 
Version Date: 20-Jun-2023 
potential role of IL-6 as a therapeutic anti-tumour agent has been shown in a variety of preclinical 
tumour models although the use of recombinant IL-6 in patients was determined to be a multiple 
myeloma inducing growth factor (Mullen et al. 1992; Sun et al. 1992; Abroun et al. 2004; Salazar-
Onfray et al. 2007). 
Consistent  with  the  role  of  IL-6  in  tumour  progression,  nonclinical  pharmacology  studies 
conducted  with  tocilizumab  showed  clear  anti-proliferative  effects.  These  experiments 
demonstrated  that  tocilizumab  inhibits  the  proliferation  of  cell  lines  induced  by  IL-6/sIL-6R 
complex such as BAF-h130 and effectively stops the IL-6 dependent growth of human myeloma 
cell  lines  in  vitro  and  KPMM2  tumour  cells  in  vivo.  The  therapeutic  effect  of  IL-6  receptor 
blockage under in vivo conditions was shown in various disease models with MR16-1, a rodent-
specific analogue antibody to tocilizumab. MR16-1 completely prevented the lymphoproliferative 
manifestations in an IL-6 transgenic mouse model of Castleman’s Disease (Katsume et al. 2002) 
and halted the progression of tumour growth in a mouse model of colon carcinoma (Becker et al. 
2004). 
No lesions with a proliferative characteristic or any other type of pre-neoplastic findings have been 
seen in a cynomolgus monkey study of 6-months, in which the animals were continuously exposed 
to tocilizumab at serum concentrations more than 30-fold above the clinical effective serum levels. 
As suggested by the role of IL-6 in the physiology of cell regulation, chronic and complete IL-6 
depletion in vivo in IL-6 knockout mice does not lead to a higher spontaneous malignancy rate. 
Reports from experiments conducted in aged IL-6 knockout mice are particularly notable, as the 
life span was not compromised nor was there any palpable mass reported in these animals (Gomez 
et  al.  2006;  Dovi  et  al.  2003),  although  tissues  of  these  animals  were  not  histopathologically 
screened  for  the  presence  of  early  stage  malignant  disease.  There  is  no  direct  evidence  that 
tocilizumab would induce malignant transformation. On the contrary, other available evidence that 
IL-6 is a growth factor for tissue maintenance and regeneration under conditions of insult (direct 
damage or inflammation), and in malignant cells, IL-6 per se does not seem to disrupt the balance 
of  the  immunological  control  of  tumour  growth  and  metastasis  (immunosurveillance).  The 
nonclinical data suggest an association between elevated levels of IL-6 and tissue/tumour growth, 
but do not suggest that an inhibition of the IL-6R signalling pathways via chronic treatment with 
tocilizumab would lead to an increased risk of malignancies in patients. 
Relevance to human usage: Yes 
Discussion: The risk of malignancy is known to be increased in patients with RA and with some 
treatments commonly used in RA, such as MTX and biologic DMARDs (Bongartz et al. 2006). A 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) alert  was  published requiring the  manufacturers of TNF 
blockers  to  update  the  Boxed  Warning  in  the  prescribing  information  to  alert  healthcare 
professionals of an increased risk of lymphoma and other malignancies in children and adolescents 
treated with TNF blockers. EMA 2010 priorities also identified the risk of malignancy as one of 
the potential long-term adverse effects of immunomodulators, including the anti-TNFs, rituximab, 
and  tocilizumab.  Malignancies  are  considered  an  important  potential  risk  associated  with 
tocilizumab use. Refer to Module SVII.3.1 for details.

General Safety Pharmacology 
Pharmacology Studies 
The cardiovascular safety of tocilizumab has been investigated in a series of rigorously designed 
preclinical in vivo studies. These results indicate that tocilizumab does not adversely affect either 
cardiac integrity or electrophysiology; an alteration of blood pressure was also not observed in any 
of the preclinical studies. 
Relevance to human usage: No 
Discussion: Tocilizumab has not demonstrated an impact on cardiac integrity or electrophysiology 
in the clinical setting. Cardiovascular concerns are an important potential risk because tocilizumab 
treatment is associated with increases in LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and RA patients are at 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease. See important potential risk of elevated lipid levels and 
the potential risk of cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events in Module SVII.3.1. 
Effects on Bone Turnover and Quality 
IL-6 has been shown to stimulate osteoclast activity and bone resorption by an indirect mechanism, 
increasing interactions between osteoblast and osteoclast activities. The effects of IL-6 on bone 
destruction  and  the  potentially  therapeutic  benefit  on  IL-6  inhibition  were  studied  in  an  IL-6 
transgenic  mouse  model.  IL-6  over  expression  in  pre-pubertal  mice  induced  the  uncoupling  of 
osteoclast and osteoblast activities which in turn manifested as decreased trabecular and cortical 
bone growth, delayed ossification, and impaired skeletal growth (De Benedetti et al. 2006). Other 
studies in the transgenic juvenile mouse model demonstrated that effective inhibition of IL-6 was 
able to correct the IL-6-induced pathology (De Benedetti et al. 2001).  
While  treatment  with  tocilizumab  is  expected  to  block  IL-6-induced  osteoclastic  activities  and 
thereby normalize the physiologic process of bone remodelling, there are no preclinical data to 
suggest that IL-6 inhibition per se generates an abnormal imbalance of this process. The studies in 
juvenile animals are also relevant for adults as the fast growing body weight at this age requires a 
constant adaptation of the skeletal system via length-growth, increase in bone mass, but also bone 
shaping and adaptation to the constantly changing biomechanical strains. Therefore, studies of this 
type offer a more appropriate means than those in adults of assessing the effect ofIL-6 deprivation 
on bone remodelling. The phenotype of these mice did not show any irregularity and therefore, 
provides  no  evidence  for  an  IL-6  deficiency-induced  underlying  abnormal  bone  remodelling 
process. Nonclinical safety studies conducted with tocilizumab are in concordance with these data, 
showing that bone morphology was normal in primate toxicity studies over a tocilizumab exposure 
for up to 6 months. The histopathology of bone in these young adult animals with ongoing skeletal 
growth  showed  no  morphological/developmental  abnormalities.  Overall,  the  preclinical  data 
demonstrate  that  IL-6  is  a  key  regulatory  factor  in  osteoclast  activation  and  contributes  to  the 
osteopenic manifestations frequently associated with chronic inflammatory diseases. Preclinical 
studies  showed  that  inhibition  of  IL-6  normalizes  inflammation-driven  osteoclastic  bone 
destruction,  and  nonclinical  safety  studies  conducted  with  tocilizumab  demonstrated  that  IL-6 
inhibition, induced by continuous chronic exposure to tocilizumab, maintains a morphologically 
and functionally normal bone homeostasis.  
Relevance to human usage: Yes

Discussion: The incident rate of fractures (events per 100 PY) at 1 year in LITHE were 3.12 (95% 
CI: 1.35, 6.15) in the placebo group, 2.42 (95% CI: 1.05, 4.8) in the 4 mg/kg tocilizumab group, 
and 3.72 (95% CI: 1.98, 6.37) in the 8 mg/kg tocilizumab group.  
Effects of IL-6 Depletion on Maintenance of Mucosal Integrity of the GI Tract  
IL-6 is known to play an important role in maintenance of mucosal integrity and the depletion of 
IL-6 may impede that function (Dann et al. 2008). In IL-6 knockout mice, an IL-6 deficiency was 
found to exacerbate mucosal inflammation and damage caused by bacteria and chemical irritants, 
and  in  vitro,  IL-6  protected  colonic  epithelial  cells  against  inducible  apoptosis  by  increasing 
expression  of  anti-apoptotic  proteins.  Therefore,  IL-6  depletion  may  be  associated  with 
impairment of the maintenance of mucosal integrity. On the other hand, the downregulation of IL-
6 in animal models of colitis (direct chemically-induced colitis and immune-transfer colitis) has 
been  proven  to  ameliorate  symptoms  and  histologic  inflammatory  consequences  of  these 
experimentally induced colitis models thus proving a potential benefit of an anti-IL-6R antibody 
in colitis (Ishiguro et al. 2010).  
Relevance to human usage: Yes  
Discussion:  Complications  of  diverticulitis  is  an  identified  risk  of  tocilizumab  use,  per  data 
obtained in clinical trials. Refer to Module SVII.3.1 for more details.  
Effects of a Blockage of IL-6 Signalling with a Surrogate Antibody in Juvenile Mice  
Effects of a blockage of IL-6 signalling in juvenile animals have been investigated with a murine 
surrogate antibody of tocilizumab, termed MR16-1. MR16-1, a rat anti-mouse IL-6R monoclonal 
antibody (IgG1) has been thoroughly characterized in pharmacologic models as a suitable rodent 
analogue of human anti-IL-6 antibodies. For this safety assessment purpose, juvenile mice were 
treated once every 3 days from weaning (postnatal Day 22) until sexual maturation (postnatal Day 
79). Effects of MR16-1 were investigated on postnatal development and growth, immune system, 
skeletal development, and sexual maturation after IV administration of MR16-1 in juvenile mice. 
Toxicokinetic investigations yielded evidence that the study was done under full blockage of IL-6 
signalling. The observation of anti-drug antibodies did not impair the assessment.  
No  adverse  effects  were  observed  in  body  weight,  food  consumption,  haematology,  necropsy, 
organ weights, or histopathology in any treatment group during dosing or recovery period.  
With  respect  to  immune  system  in  juvenile  animals,  there  were  no  adverse  effects  in 
immunocompetence,  NK  cell  activities  in  any  treatment  group.  The  following  results  were 
obtained: 50- and 15-mg/kg groups, a decrease in CD3e+CD4+CD8a− ratio and peripheral blood 
count in males and females at end of the dosing period; decrease in CD3e+ ratio and count; increase 
in  CD3e+CD4+CD8a−  ratio  and  peripheral  blood  count  in  males  and  females  and  increase  in 
CD49b/Pan-NK cells+CD3e− ratio in females in the 50-mg/kg group at end of the recovery period, 
was observed. These changes are considered to have a minor impact on the immune system, since 
no adverse effects on immunocompetence (serum IgG and IgM production to KLH) was observed 
in any treatment group.  
With respect  to  sexual maturation and skeletal  development  in  juvenile animals,  there were no 
adverse  effects  in  the morphological  differentiation of external  genitalia,  oestrous  cycle, sperm 
examination, crown-rump length, or skeletal development in any treatment group.

From  these  study  results,  it  is  concluded  that  MR16-1  did  not  induce  any  toxicologically 
meaningful changes on postnatal development, growth, immune system, skeletal development, or 
sexual maturation in juvenile animals.  
Relevance to human usage: No  
Discussion: The applicability of these results to humans is limited because they were conducted 
with a murine surrogate antibody.

Potential for Misuse for Illegal Purposes 
No  studies  on  the  effects  of  the  potential  for  tocilizumab  to  cause  dependence  have  been 
performed.  However,  there  is  no  evidence  from  the  available  data  that  tocilizumab  treatment 
results in dependence. Drugs that have the potential for misuse for illegal purposes are accepted to 
share some general characteristics such as psychoactivity, less commonly, anabolic effects, and 
enhancement of haemoglobin levels. 
IL-6 signalling blockade, through the use of tocilizumab, would not reasonably be considered as a 
potential drug of misuse for illegal purposes as it does not share any characteristics with drugs that 
are commonly associated with illegal misuse. Furthermore, there is no evidence from completed 
clinical studies that tocilizumab has been associated with any clinical event that might suggest the 
potential for misuse for illegal purposes. There is also no evidence from the available data that 
tocilizumab treatment gives rise to dependence. 
Erythropoetins have been associated with illegal use, primarily in athletes, in order to stimulate 
the  bone  marrow  to  increase  red  blood  count  production  thereby  achieving  the  performance 
enhancement associated with training at high altitude. Results from clinical trials with tocilizumab 
have  demonstrated  improvement  in  anaemia  of  chronic  disease,  associated  with  chronic 
inflammatory  conditions,  but  no  increase  in  healthy  volunteers  or  in  patients  with  normal 
haemoglobin  labels.  Additionally,  supraphysiological  levels  of  haemoglobin  have  not  been 
recorded in patients receiving tocilizumab. Therefore, tocilizumab is not considered to be of use 
as a performance enhancing drug in this context. 
The  data  collected  in  the  clinical  studies  of  MSB11456  are  in  accordance  with  established 
scientific and medical knowledge, that tocilizumab does not relevantly impact haemoglobin levels.

Important identified risk 
Serious Infections 
This  safety  concern  is  considered  an  important  identified  risk  for  chronic  tocilizumab 
dosing, but is  assessed as important potential risk for the indication of COVID-19. For 
ease of review, all data related to COVID-19 are included below together with data related 
to chronic tocilizumab dosing. 
Potential 
mechanism 
Patients with RA, GCA, pJIA, and sJIA are at a higher risk of infection than 
the general population because of altered immunological function as well 
as  concomitant  therapies  used  to  treat  the  underlying  disease  (e.g., 
Page 40 of 148 
 
 
EU Risk Management Plan 0.2

Version Date: 20-Jun-2023 
corticosteroids  and  immunomodulating  agents).  Biologic  therapies  have 
been shown to be associated with infections, particularly serious infections, 
including tuberculosis and opportunistic infections. 
Patients with COVID-19 are at higher risk of secondary bacterial or fungal 
infection.  Superinfections  and  co-infections  are  common  in  respiratory 
viral  illnesses  including  COVID-19,  particularly  in  severe  hospitalized 
cases. Acute suppression of IL-6 may increase the infection risk due to IL-
6’s role in the acute-phase response and overall defence mechanism against 
infectious organisms. 
The source of information is clinical/safety data and medical literature. 
Evidence 
source(s) and 
strength of 
evidence 
Characterization 
of the risk 
Incidence  rates  of  serious  infections  in  RA  patients  treated  with  TNF 
antagonists  ranged  from  6.0  to  10.1  events  per  100  PY  (Johnston  et  al. 
2011; Nguyen-Khoa et al. 2010; Thyagarajan et al. 2012). 
Deaths due to infections: incidence rate ranged from 0.069 to 0.24 events 
per 100 PY (Lunt et al. 2010; Carmona et al. 2007). 
COVID-19 
The incidence of secondary infections or co-infection (bacterial, fungal, or 
viral) in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in China ranged from 1% to 
15% (Chen et al. 2020; Fu et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2020; Lin et al. 2020a; 
Zhou  et  al.  2020).  Common  bacterial  and  fungal  co-infections  reported 
were  Acinetobacter  baumannii,  Klebsiella  pneumoniae,  Mycoplasma 
pneumoniae, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus flavus, while common viral 
infections  were  influenza  A,  influenza  B,  respiratory  syncytial  virus, 
parainfluenza, Epstein-Barr virus, and adenovirus (Chen et al. 2020; Huang 
et  al.  2020;  Lin  et  al.  2020a;  Zhou  et  al.  2020).  A  retrospective  study 
reported 101 patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Zhijiang 
Medical Centre, China including 36 patients in the ICU. In total, 5 patients 
in the ICU (5.0%, 5 of 101 for all patients; 13.9%, 5 of 36 for patients in 
the  ICU)  were  diagnosed  with  secondary  bacterial  infection  (Fu  et  al. 
2020). Another retrospective study of 393 hospitalized COVID-19 patients 
in  the  United  States  (New  York)  between  3  March  and  27  March  2020 
reported an incidence of 1% and 5.6% of viral co-infection and bacteraemia 
respectively (Goyal et al. 2020). A single centre study in the United States 
(Stanford) from 3 to 25 March 2020 identified a 20% prevalence of other 
viral  respiratory  infections  among  115  hospitalized  COVID-19  patients. 
The  most  common  co-infections  were  rhinovirus/enterovirus  (6.9%), 
respiratory  syncytial  virus  (5.2%),  and  non-SARS-CoV-2  Coronaviridae 
(4.3%) (Kim et al. 2020). Zhou et al. (2020) observed an incidence of 59% 
for  sepsis  and  20%  for  septic  shock  in  191  patients  hospitalized  with 
Page 41 of 148

COVID-19 (Zhou et al. 2020). Chen et al. (2020) reported the prevalence 
of  4%  for  septic  shock  in  99  patients  with  COVID-19−associated 
pneumonia (Chen et al. 2020). 
Impact on Quality of Life 
Tocilizumab may reduce resistance to infections; therefore, patients will be 
monitored  for  any  signs  or  symptoms  of  infections.  Patients  may 
experience severe infections, which can sometimes be fatal. Vigilance for 
the  timely  detection  of  serious  infection  is  recommended  for  patients 
receiving biologic treatments for moderate to severe RA, GCA, pJIA, or 
sJIA  as  signs  and  symptoms  of  acute  inflammation  may  be  lessened, 
associated  with  suppression  of  the  acute-phase  reaction.  The  effects  of 
tocilizumab on C-reactive protein, neutrophils, and signs and symptoms of 
infection  should  be  considered  when  evaluating  a  patient  for  a  potential 
infection.  Similar  monitoring  requirements  and  recommendations  for 
vigilance apply for COVID-19 patients. 
Patients with diabetes reported a higher rate of serious infections compared 
to patients without diabetes. Patients treated with tocilizumab and taking 
background  corticosteroids  reported  a  higher  rate  of  serious  infections 
compared  to  patients  not  taking  background  corticosteroids.  The  rate  of 
serious infections appears to increase with body weight. 
Healthcare professionals should exercise caution when considering the use 
of tocilizumab in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections 
or with underlying conditions (e.g., diverticulitis, diabetes, or ILD which 
may predispose patients to infections). 
Vigilance  for  timely  detection  of  serious  infections  is  recommended  as 
signs  and  symptoms  of  acute  inflammation  may  be  lessened  due  to 
suppression of the acute-phase reactants. 
Prescribing  information  (EU  SmPC)  warnings  caution  when  considering 
the  use  of  tocilizumab  in  patients  with  a  history  of  recurring  or  chronic

Myllykangas-Luosujärvi found a 6-fold excess  mortality in  patients  with 
RA as a result of diverticular disease and postulated a link to medications 
used to treat RA (Myllykangas-Luosujärvi et al.1995). As corticosteroids 
are  known  to  be  associated  with  abscess  development,  and  since  both 
corticosteroids and NSAIDs have been implicated in perforated diverticular 
disease,  Mpofu  et  al.  undertook  a  case  control  study  to  investigate  their 
association  with  the  development  of  sigmoid  diverticular  abscess 
perforation  in  patients  with  and  without  RA  (Mpofu  et  al.  2004).  This

demonstrated a strong association between corticosteroid treatment in the 
development of sigmoid diverticular abscess perforation in both rheumatic 
and non-rheumatic patients. 
Data from claims databases suggest that treatment with corticosteroids may 
be  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  gastrointestinal  (GI)  perforations 
with  rates  of  0.19  for  biologics  administered  concomitantly  with 
corticosteroids, and 0.3 for corticosteroids (Curtis et al.2012). 
COVID-19 
Limited  information  is  available  for  GI  perforation  in  patients  with 
COVID-19. Associations between GI symptoms and COVID-19 have been 
evidenced  but  restricted  to  diarrhoea  (CDC  2020a;  WHO  2020a;  WHO 
2020b). In a retrospective cross-sectional study of 412 COVID-19 patients 
in Boston, United States, bowel wall perforation was observed in 1 patient 
(0.2%) (Bhayana et al. 2020). Zangrillo et al. (2020) reported a single case 
of  GI  perforation  in  a  case  series  of  73  mechanically  ventilated  patients 
with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the ICU in Milan, Italy (Zangrillo 
et al. 2020). A retrospective study included 81 adult COVID-19 patients 
with abdominal computed tomography performed from 1 April 2020 to 1 
May 2020 in Brazil. A single case of intestinal perforation was observed on 
abdominal  imaging  accounting  for  the  prevalence  of  1%  (Horvat  et  al. 
2021). More individual case reports have been published as Alnabwani et 
al,  who  reported  a  case  of  a  72  year  old  patient  with  severe  COVID  19 
infection who developed perforation and Argan et al who reported 3 cases 
of gastrointestinal perforations secondary to COVID 19 (Alnabwani et al. 
2022; Argan et al. 2021)

Characterization 
of the risk 
The source of information is clinical/safety data and medical literature. 
Decreases in neutrophil counts have been observed in RA, GCA, pJIA, and 
sJIA  patients  following  treatment  with  tocilizumab.  Severe  neutropenia 
may  be  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  serious  infections,  although 
there has been no association between grade 3 and 4 neutropenia and the 
occurrence of serious infections in clinical trials with tocilizumab to date. 
COVID-19 
In  a  pooled  analysis  of  66  paediatric  patients  with  COVID-19,  available 
from 12 studies (11 conducted in China and 1 in Singapore), neutropenia 
was reported in 6% of the patients (Henry et al. 2020). A retrospective study 
in Wuhan, China included 213 (mild/moderate: 175, severe: 38) COVID-
19  patients  who  had  been  discharged  or  died  by  15  March  2020.  On 
laboratory examinations, overall, 20.2% patients reported lower neutrophil 
count [mild/moderate: (21.1%), severe: (15.8%)] (Hu et al. 2020). 
Risk group or risk 
factors 
Patients  with  an  absolute  neutrophil  count  (ANC)  below  2  x  109/L  have 
increased risks. 
Preventability  
In patients not previously treated with tocilizumab for all indications other 
than COVID-19, initiation is not recommended in patients with an absolute 
neutrophil count (ANC) below 2 x 109/L. Monitoring during treatment is 
recommended  and  dose  modification  or  treatment  discontinuation  is 
recommended based upon ANC. In patients who develop an ANC < 0.5 x 
109/L continued treatment is not recommended. 
For  patients  with  COVID-19  who  develop  an  ANC  <1  x  109/L, 
administration of treatment is not recommended.

Characterization 
of the risk 
It  has  been  suggested  that  RA  may  be  associated  with  non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (Ahmed et al. 2006) which may be mediated by the action 
of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNFα. IL-6 is elevated in 
patients with hepatitis (Hill et al.1992) and alcoholic liver disease (Hill et 
al.1992).  Therefore,  IL-6  and  TNFα  are  involved  in  liver  injury. 
Paradoxically, IL-6 is also considered a hepatoprotective factor because it 
stimulates hepatocyte proliferation and mediates the regeneration of liver 
tissue after injury (Taub et al. 2003; Cressman et al. 1996). IL-6-deficient 
mice  develop  increased  liver  injury  in  response  to  CCl4  in  a  TNFα 
mediated  model  of  liver  injury  (Czaja  et  al.1995),  suggesting  IL-6  may 
function downstream of TNFα to ameliorate the injury response. 
Based  on  a  comprehensive,  cumulative  review  of  the  clinical  and  safety 
data, FDA Adverse Event Reporting System and Eudravigilance databases 
and peer reviewed literature, a causal association between tocilizumab and 
serious  hepatotoxicity  has  been  identified.  The  assessment  was  further 
validated by an independent drug-induced liver injury (DILI) expert panel 
on selected cases (Roche Drug Safety Report No. 1084454, 2019).  
The  overall  worldwide  incidence  rate  of  DILI  variously  specified  in  the 
general population is low (13.9-24.0 per 100,000 people). The incidence of 
acute and clinically significant DILI (requiring hospitalization or requiring 
specialist referral), however, is even lower (2.3-2.4 per 100,000 persons per 
year). At the more severe end of the spectrum, the occurrence of all-cause 
acute liver failure in the developed world is considered very rare (1 to 6 
cases  per  1,000,000  people  every  year).  There  is  wide  variability  in  the 
incidence rates of DILI in populations. This is due to the following reasons: 
 
difficulty  in  recognizing  and  diagnosing  DILI  (e.g.,  there  are  no 
widely accepted criteria for diagnosis of DILI, instead it is a diagnosis of 
exclusion) 
Page 46 of 148 
 
 
EU Risk Management Plan 0.2 
MSB11456 (Tocilizumab) 
Version Date: 20-Jun-2023 
 
difficulty in attribution of the event to a drug. There are multiple 
drug  agents  commonly  in  use  among  the  general  population,  and  in 
particular among patients with RA, where many DMARDs as well as over-
(e.g.,  anti-inflammatories)  are 
frequently  used 
the-counter  drugs 
recognized to have hepatotoxic effects 
 
under-ascertained  predisposing  factors  (such  as  heavy  alcohol 
consumption, use of herbal agents), as well as other factors prevalent in the 
RA population, such as obesity, diabetes, etc., that may impact individual 
background risk 
 
trade-offs in undertaking population-level studies that of necessity 
cover less detail on larger numbers of individuals, versus undertaking small 
studies with comprehensive data detail on more circumscribed populations 
but  with  multiple  exclusions,  which  by  default  are  less  representative  of 
patients  receiving  medical  care  under  real-world  conditions  or  of  target 
populations. 
Thus, the epidemiology data presented contains limitations which make the 
generalizability  of  these  results,  including  extrapolation  to  the  RA 
population  challenging.  This  was  further  compounded  by  inconsistent 
definition of DILI across different publications examined, and reporting of 
results for only a single drug comparator, further limiting the generalization 
of the results for the RA population with or without biological DMARD. 
As MTX is used as background therapy in a large number of RA patients, 
the observations with this agent are relevant in this context. In the MTX 
SmPC (Nordimet 2022), MTX is described as hepatotoxic, particularly at 
high  doses  or  with  prolonged  therapy.  Liver  atrophy,  necrosis,  cirrhosis, 
fatty  changes,  and  periportal  fibrosis  have  been  reported.  Changes  may 
occur without prior signs of toxicity, so it is imperative that hepatic function 
be  determined  before  treatment  is  started  and  monitored  regularly 
throughout therapy. 
In  addition,  the  MTX  SmPC,  describes  that  temporary  increases  in 
transaminases to 2-3 times of the upper limit of normal (ULN) have been 
reported by patients at a frequency of 13 - 20 %, however MTX should not 
be  started  or  should  be  discontinued  if  there  are  any  clinically  relevant 
abnormalities of liver function tests or liver biopsy. 
COVID-19 
Liver injury is commonly associated in patients infected with coronavirus 
(COVID-19, SARS, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). A review of 
12 studies from China found that in COVID-19 patients, the incidence of 
liver injury ranged from 14.8% to 53%, abnormal ALT from 13.3% to 28% 
and abnormal AST from 22.2% to 58% (Xu et al. 2020). 
A  prospective  cohort  study  reported  on  1611  hospitalized  patients  with 
confirmed  SARS-CoV-2  infection  from  15  April  2020  through  31  July 
Page 47 of 148

2020 in 38 different hospitals from 11 Latin American countries. Abnormal 
liver tests on admission were present in 45.2% (95% CI: 42.7–47.7) of the 
cohort.  Patients  with  elevated  ALT, 
total  bilirubin,  and  alkaline 
phosphatase accounted for 35.3%, 6.3%, and 19.4%, respectively. Among 
patients with elevated ALT, 32.6% of the cases presented moderate injury 
(2–5 times ULN) and 10.7% were severe (>5 times ULN) (Mendizabal et 
al. 2021). 
Retrospective  laboratory  diagnosis  of  1099  Chinese  COVID-19  patients 
from 11 December 2019 to 29 January 2020 showed ALT elevation (> 40 
U/L) occurred in 21.3% (158/741) and AST elevation (> 40 U/L) in 22.2% 
(168/757) of patients. Severe COVID-19 patients had a higher probability 
of ALT elevation, and AST elevations compared with non-severe patients 
(28.1%  vs.  19.8%  and  39.4%  vs.  18.2%,  respectively).  10.5%  (76/722) 
patients presented with abnormal bilirubin (> 17.1 μmol/liter) (Guan et al. 
2020). 
Another retrospective study in China (from 20 January 2020 to 17 February 
2020)  evaluated 
laboratory  findings  of  202  clinically  confirmed 
hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Elevated ALT (< 30 U/L for males and 
19 U/L for females) was present in 101 (50.0%) patients. Elevated AST and 
total bilirubin were found in 16.8% and 8.4% of the patients, respectively. 
67 (33.2%) patients had persistent abnormal liver function from admission 
till the last day of follow-up. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, identified as 
hepatic  steatosis  index  >36  points  and/or  by  abdominal  ultrasound 
examination, was present in 37.6% of the patients (Ji et al. 2020). 
A  retrospective  study  of  5700  COVID-19  patients  in  the  United  States 
(March-April 2020) identified 19 patients (0.4%) with cirrhosis, and 0.1% 
each  with  chronic  hepatitis  B  and  C  as  prevalent  comorbidity  before 
hospitalization (Richardson et al. 2020). Patients with liver injury were at 
9-fold  greater  risk  of  severe  COVID-19  (OR  9.04)  (Cai  et  al.  2020).  In 
addition,  immune-mediated  inflammation,  such  as  cytokine  storm  and 
pneumonia-associated hypoxia, might also contribute to liver injury or even 
develop into liver failure in patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill 
(Zhang et al. 2020a). 
Mild and moderate elevations of hepatic transaminases have been observed 
with  tocilizumab  treatment.  Increased  frequency  of  these  elevations  was 
observed when drugs, which are known to cause hepatotoxicity (e.g. MTX), 
were used in combination with tocilizumab. 
Serious  DILI,  including  acute  liver  failure,  hepatitis,  and  jaundice,  have 
been  observed  with  tocilizumab.  Cases  of  liver  failure  resulting  in  liver 
transplantation have been reported. 
Eight  cases  were  assessed  as  tocilizumab-related  moderate-severe  liver 
injury. Overall, the median latency for these cases was 98 days (range: 14 
to  1825  days).  The  cases  include  two  cases  of  acute  liver  failure/liver

transplant, five cases of CTCAE Grade 4 hepatotoxicity, and one case with 
Grade  2  hepatotoxicity.  These  eight  tocilizumab-related  DILI  cases 
represent a small proportion of the estimated 1,066,849 patients exposed to 
tocilizumab to date, resulting in a crude rate of ~8 cases/1,000,000 patients, 
representing a rare event frequency. 
Treatment with tocilizumab particularly when administered concomitantly 
with  MTX,  may  be  associated  with  elevations  in  hepatic  transaminases; 
therefore, caution should be exercised when considering treatment of any 
patients with active hepatic disease or hepatic impairment. 
Patients  hospitalized  with  COVID-19  frequently  have  elevated  ALT  or 
AST levels. Multiorgan failure with involvement of the liver is recognized 
as a complication of severe COVID-19. (Zhang et al. 2020a). 
In all indications other than COVID-19, caution should be exercised when 
considering  initiation  of  tocilizumab  treatment  in  patients  with  elevated 
transaminases  ALT  or  AST  above  1.5  ×  ULN.  In  patients  with  elevated 
ALT or AST above 5 × ULN, treatment is not recommended. 
In RA, GCA, pJIA, and sJIA, ALT/AST should be monitored every 4 to 8 
weeks  for  the  first  6  months  of  treatment  followed  by  every  12  weeks 
thereafter.  The  recommended  dose  modifications,  including  tocilizumab 
discontinuation, based on transaminases levels, in line with SmPC Section 
4.2.  For  ALT  or  AST  elevations  >  3–5  x  ULN,  tocilizumab  treatment 
should be interrupted. 
In patients with COVID-19, monitoring of ALT/AST according to current 
standard  clinical  practices  is  recommended.  In  patients  with  COVID-19 
with  elevated  ALT  or  AST  >  10  ×  ULN,  initiation  of  treatment  with 
tocilizumab is not recommended. 
The frequency of the observed serious hepatotoxicity events is considered 
rare and the benefit-risk profile of tocilizumab in the approved indications 
remains favourable. 
The  risk  of  hepatotoxicity  is  described  in  the  EU  SmPC,  Patient 
Information Leaflet and Educational Materials for Healthcare professionals 
and patients and also provides information regarding AST/ALT monitoring 
to help mitigate and manage the risk. The recommended tocilizumab dose 
modification  (reduction,  interruption  or  discontinuation)  are  already 
mentioned in the approved labels. Given the well-described and managed 
safety  profile  of  tocilizumab  and  the  known  efficacy,  benefit  risk  of 
tocilizumab in the indicated treatment populations remains positive.

Thrombocytopenia and the potential risk of bleeding 
Potential 
mechanism 
Thrombocytosis is among the most common extra-articular manifestations 
of RA and  IL-6 administration results in  substantial  increase in  platelets 
that could be explained by enhanced thrombopoiesis through induction of 
thrombopoietin. Thus, reduction (normalization) of platelet count may be 
expected with inhibition of the IL-6 receptors.

The source of information is clinical/safety data and medical literature. 
Patients  with  RA  are  frequently  on  concomitant  medications,  including 
MTX and steroids that may reduce platelet count. No association between 
decreases in platelet counts and serious bleeding events were reported nor 
was  there  a  relationship  between  body  weight  and  the  incidence  of 
thrombocytopenia. 
COVID-19 
A  meta-analysis  of  22  studies  (4889  patients)  from  China  published 
between December 2019 and April 2020 showed that 10.9%; 95% CI (8.1-
13.6) of COVID-19 patients had thrombocytopenia. The platelet count in 
severe COVID-19 patients was 14.47 × 109/L; 95% CI (33.0-4.06), which 
was not significantly lower than that in non-severe patients (Jin et al. 2020). 
A study of 1,476 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, reported 20.7% had 
thrombocytopenia during hospitalization. Compared with survivors, non-
survivors were older, were more likely to have thrombocytopenia and had 
lower nadir platelet counts. The study concluded that thrombocytopenia is 
common in patients with COVID-19 and is associated with increased risk 
of in-hospital mortality (Yang et al. 2020a). 
Among 191 COVID-19 patients, 7% had thrombocytopenia on admission 
(Zhou  et  al.  2020).  15  out  of  21  non-survivors  (8%  of  the  total  cohort)

COVID-19  patients,  thrombocytopenia  was  present  in  20%  of  the  cases 
(Zhou et al. 2020). A study investigated the prognostic factors of 28-day 
mortality  of  severely  affected  COVID-19  patients  and  the  association 
between mortality and the administration of low molecular weight heparin 
for  at  least  7  days.  Elevated  D-dimer,  prolonged  PT,  increased  age,  and 
lower platelet count were associated with higher 28-day mortality (Tang et 
al. 2020b).  
Significantly  lower  platelet  count  has  been  associated  with  over  5-fold

observed in patients following treatment with tocilizumab. The relationship 
of these elevations and the risk for cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease 
is unknown. 
Risk group or risk 
factors 
None identified. 
Preventability  
Lipid parameters such as total cholesterol, triglycerides, and/or low LDL 
should be monitored during the first 4-8 weeks of tocilizumab treatment. 
Patients  should  be  managed  according 
to  clinical  guidelines  for 
management of hyperlipidaemia.

Public health 
impact  
Potential  impact  on  public  health  is  minimal  given  the  low  frequency  of 
cardiovascular/cerebrovascular complications attributable to tocilizumab. 
Important potential risk 
Malignancies 
Potential 
mechanism 
Tocilizumab is an immunosuppressive agent and may therefore result in an 
increased risk of malignancy.

of the risk 
The source of information is clinical/safety data and medical literature. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis 
A  higher  risk  of  cancer  has  consistently  been  reported  in  RA  patients 
compared with the general population. This risk appears to be particularly 
higher  for  lymphoproliferative  malignancies  such  as  non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma and multiple myeloma in RA patients compared with the general 
population (Mellemkjaer et al.1996; Prior et al.1985).  
COVID-19 
In a systematic review of 17 studies involving 32,404 patients worldwide, 
the pooled prevalence of malignancies was 3.5% (95% CI: 1.7, 5.8), and 
ranged  from  0.5%  to  21%  in  COVID-19  patients  (Ofori-Asenso  et  al. 
2020).  It may be noted that patients with pre-existing malignancies have 
increased susceptibility to Covid-19 infection. In a retrospective study of 
388 hospitalized Italian COVID-19 patients between 13 February and 10 
April 2020, 6.4% of patients had active cancer.  
 There have been reports of cancer in patients treated with tocilizumab; no 
individual  type  of  tumour  was  more  common  than  expected  in  this 
population. 
Risk group or risk 
factors 
None identified. 
Preventability 
Not applicable. 
Impact on the 
risk-benefit 
balance of the 
product 
There  have  been  very  few  reports  of  cancer  with  tocilizumab,  and  no 
individual tumour type predominates. Despite the low event rate, a potential 
risk  cannot  be  excluded.  Tocilizumab  treatment  should  not  be  started  in 
subjects  with  cancer.  The  EU  SmPC,  Patient  information  leaflet  and

Educational  Materials  for  Healthcare  professionals  and  patients,  provide 
information regarding the risk. 
The risk of malignancy is known to be increased in patients with RA and 
with some treatments  commonly used in RA, such as  MTX and biologic 
DMARDs.  A  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  alert  was  published 
requiring the manufacturers of TNF blockers to update the Boxed Warning 
in  the  prescribing  information  to  alert  healthcare  professionals  of  an 
increased  risk  of  lymphoma  and  other  malignancies  in  children  and 
adolescents  treated  with  TNF  blockers.  Europe,  Middle  East,  and  Africa 
2010 priorities also identified the risk of malignancy as one of the potential 
long-term adverse effects of immunomodulators, including the anti-TNFs, 
rituximab, and tocilizumab. 
Concern is high because of the seriousness of the risk; however, the public 
health impact is considered low because of the low frequency of such events 
associated with tocilizumab.

None identified. 
The source of information is clinical/safety data and medical literature. 
Incidence  rates  of  demyelination  events  in  RA  patients  exposed  to 
traditional or biologic DMARDs were calculated based on data in subjects 
with  no  demyelination  events  before  cohort  entry  (n=82),  the  calculated 
incidence rate of demyelinating events was 0.041 per 100 PY (Benatsky S 
et al. 2010). 
COVID-19 
Evidence on demyelinating disorders such as Guillian-Barre syndrome in 
COVID-19 patients is scarce in the literature. Fragiel 2021 reported that the 
frequency  of  Guillain-Barre  syndrome  in  patients  attending  61  Spanish 
emergency  departments  during  the  first  2  months  of  the  pandemic  was 
0.15% in patients with evidence of COVID-19 infection and 0.02% in those 
without COVID-19 (Fragiel 2021). 
No  risk  factors  or  data  on  mortality  due  to  Guillain-Barre  syndrome  in 
COVID-19 patients were available in the literature. 
By its nature, such events would be expected to be serious.

Part III: Pharmacovigilance Plan  
III.1  Routine pharmacovigilance activities 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities will be carried out for the important identified and potential 
risks described above.  
The  robust  pharmacovigilance  system  established  by  Fresenius  Kabi  enables  collection  and 
analysis  of  safety  data  from  multiple  sources  including  spontaneous  notification,  literature, 
regulatory authorities, commercial partners as well as detection and management of signals and 
risks.  When  safety  information  is  received,  it  is  triaged  and  entered  into  a  safety  database. 
Individual  case  safety  reports  are  reviewed  by  a  safety  physician  on  a  case-by-case  basis  for 
completeness and accuracy and to assess the seriousness, causal relationship between an adverse 
event and the drug, as well as the expectedness. If relevant information is missing, Fresenius Kabi 
will  conduct  follow-up  investigations  to  collect  additional  data  such  as  outcome,  concomitant 
medications, concurrent disease(s), etc. 
Once MSB11456 is marketed, aggregate safety data will be reviewed periodically and compared 
to the previous period, taking into account the accumulated safety knowledge for the product to 
identify any safety signals or trends. Furthermore, a list of adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
will be closely monitored on an ongoing basis using appropriate Standardized Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Queries (SMQs) or relevant Preferred Terms (PT) when no 
SMQ is available. If a signal is detected, Fresenius Kabi will assess the data in order to validate 
the  signal  taking  into  account  previous  awareness,  strength  of  the  evidence,  as  well  as  clinical 
relevance. 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal detection will 
include: 
-  periodic summary and assessment of safety findings from multiple sources including signal 
detection  in  the  scheduled  Periodic  Benefit-Risk  Evaluation  Report  (PBRER)  for 
MSB11456; 
- 
specific  adverse  reaction  follow-up  forms  (targeted  questionnaires)  to  collect  relevant 
safety  information  in  a  standardized  manner  and  monitor  the  frequency  and  nature  of 
adverse events emerging during clinical trials and post-marketing use of MSB11456 related 
to some of the risks (Serious Infections, Complications of diverticulitis, Thrombocytopenia 
and the potential risk of Bleeding, Hepatotoxicity, Elevated lipid levels and the potential 
risk  of  Cardiovascular  and  Cerebrovascular  events,  Malignancies  and  Demyelinating 
disorders). 
For  further  details  on  the  specific  adverse  reaction  follow-up  forms  please  see  Annex  4  of  the 
RMP. 
III.2  Additional pharmacovigilance activities 
No additional pharmacovigilance activities will be carried out for MSB11456 at this point.

*The safety concerns Serious infection and Complications of Diverticulitis are considered important identified risks 
for chronic tocilizumab dosing but are assessed as important potential risks for the indication of COVID-19.  
V.2 Additional risk minimization measures  
Additional risk minimization measures are targeted for the indications of RA, GCA, pJIA, and 
sJIA.  The  CRS  indication,  an  acute  life-threatening  condition  treated  in  the  hospital  setting  by 
oncologists, has a different benefit-risk profile relative to previously approved indications. Given 
this therapeutic context, no additional risk minimization measure is required for treatment of CRS. 
Use of MSB11456 for CRS and its risk profile are in line with those specified in the EU SmPC. 
The additional risk-minimization measures in Table 9 are not applicable for COVID-19 indication.

Version Date: 20-Jun-2023 
Part VI: Summary of the Risk Management Plan for MSB11456 (tocilizumab) 
This is a summary of the Risk Management Plan for MSB11456. The RMP details important risks 
of MSB11456, how these risks  can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about MSB11456 risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
The SmPC and PIL give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients, respectively 
on how tocilizumab should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for MSB11456 should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of MSB11456 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
MSB11456 is authorized for rheumatoid arthritis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, juvenile 
idiopathic  polyarthritis,  giant  cell  arteritis,  cytokine  release  syndrome  induced  by  CAR  T-cell 
therapies and COVID-19 infection. It contains tocilizumab as the active substance and it is given 
by intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  MSB11456  benefits  can  be  found  in  MSB11456’s 
EPAR, including in  its  plain-language summary,  available on the European Medicines  Agency 
(EMA) website, under the medicine's webpage <link to the EPAR summary landing page>. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise the 
risks 
Important risks of MSB11456, together with measures to minimize such risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
proposed Product Information addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
  The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with 
or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  events  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly  analysed,  including  PBRER  assessment,  so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.

II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  MSB11456  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimize  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of MSB11456. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be 
collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

The source of information is clinical/safety data and medical literature. 
Patients with diabetes reported a higher rate of serious infections compared 
to patients without diabetes. Patients treated with tocilizumab and taking 
background  corticosteroids  reported  a  higher  rate  of  serious  infections 
Page 79 of 148

compared  to  patients  not  taking  background  corticosteroids.  The  rate  of 
serious infections appears to increase with body weight. 
Healthcare professionals should exercise caution when considering the use 
of tocilizumab in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections 
or with underlying conditions (e.g., diverticulitis, diabetes, or ILD which 
may predispose patients to infections). 
Vigilance  for  timely  detection  of  serious  infections  is  recommended  as 
signs  and  symptoms  of  acute  inflammation  may  be  lessened  due  to 
suppression of the acute-phase reactants.

Based on a comprehensive, cumulative review of the clinical and safety 
data,  FDA  Adverse  Event  Reporting  System  and  EudraVigilance 
databases  and  peer  reviewed  literature,  a  causal  association  between 
tocilizumab and serious hepatotoxicity has been identified. The assessment 
was further validated by an independent drug-induced liver injury (DILI) 
expert panel on selected cases.

Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Treatment with tocilizumab particularly when administered concomitantly 
with  MTX, may be  associated with  elevations  in hepatic transaminases; 
therefore, caution should be exercised when considering treatment of any 
patients with active hepatic disease or hepatic impairment. 
Patients  hospitalized  with  COVID-19  frequently  have  elevated  ALT  or 
AST levels. Multiorgan failure with involvement of the liver is recognized 
as a complication of severe COVID-19. (Zhang et al. 2020a).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study title and number CTBM100CDE02, an 8 week open-label interventional 
multicenter study to evaluate the lung clearance index as endpoint for clinical trials in cystic fibrosis 
patients ≥ 6 years of age, chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a stand alone study.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
CTBM100CDE02, an 8 week open-label interventional multicenter study to evaluate the lung 
• 
clearance index as endpoint for clinical trials in cystic fibrosis patients ≥ 6 years of age, chronically 
infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
CTBM100CDE02; An 8 week open-label interventional multicenter study to 
evaluate the lung clearance index as endpoint for clinical trials in cystic 
fibrosis patients ≥ 6 years of age, chronically infected with Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa 
Description 
The only parameter of lung function that is currently recognized as a surrogate endpoint in CF trials is 
the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). However, FEV1 mainly reflects large conducting 
airways and is relatively insensitive to changes in the small airways, where CF lung disease starts. 
Accordingly, there is a need for parameters that are more sensitive and allow detection of changes in 
disease severity. Previous studies suggest that LCI may be a more sensitive surrogate parameter to 
assess early lung disease, treatment effects in patients with milder lung disease and/or disease 
progression in CF patients.  
This was an open-label, single arm design study in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), aged 6 to 50 
years, representing the typical CF patient population, with chronic P. aeruginosa infection in a clinically 
stable condition and treated by standard inhaled Tobramycin mono-therapy in an on-off regimen as 
either tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS) or tobramycin inhalation powder (TIP). The main aim of the 
study was to assess the change of lung clearance index (LCI) after 4 weeks following onset of study 
drug inhalation versus Baseline.

This study was terminated prematurely. The reason for study termination was challenge with 
enrollment and patient recruitment. 
Methods 
Objectives 
Primary objective: To assess the change of lung clearance index (LCI) after 4 weeks following onset of 
study drug inhalation versus Baseline. 
Secondary objectives: The secondary objectives of the study were to assess: 
•  Change of forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) after 4 weeks following onset of study drug 
inhalation versus Baseline. 
•  Change in colony-forming units (CFU) after 4 weeks following onset of study drug inhalation versus 
Baseline. 
•  Change of LCI after 1 week following onset of study drug inhalation versus Baseline. The multiple 
breath washout device Exhalyzer D was used to assess the LCI, a system that is recommended by 
the European Cystic Fibrosis Society clinical trial network. 
•  Change of LCI, FEV1 and CFU between week 4 (end of study drug inhalation in the current 
treatment cycle) and week 8 (prior to start of study drug inhalation in the following treatment 
cycle). 
•  Correlation between the changes of LCI, FEV1 and CFU after 1 week, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks versus 
Baseline, respectively. 
Study design 
An open-label, single arm design study. This study was designed to evaluate LCI by a standardized 
procedure in a well characterized study setting to assess feasibility of LCI as a more sensitive method 
to measure effectiveness of antibiotic therapy in patients with mild lung disease. After a screening 
period to test the presence of P.aeruginosa, participants received treatment for 28 days and were 
followed for another 28 days off-treatment.

Study population /Sample size 
It was anticipated that 35 patients (children, adolescents and young adults) were to be recruited in the 
Germany, Austria and Switzerland (DACH) region at approximately 8 study sites, however in actual 
only 17 patients from Germany were recruited and analysed in this study 
Male and female patients aged 6 to 50 years at screening (Visit 1) and had confirmed diagnosis of CF, 
elevated LCI of ≥ 7.5, FEV1 of ≥ 50% predicted at screening and had P.aeruginosa in two sputum or 
deep cough throat swab cultures or bronchoalveolar lavage within 12 months prior to screening or in 
one culture within 12 months prior to screening were enrolled in the study and patients who had 
history of sputum culture or deep cough throat swab (or bronchoalveolar lavage) culture yielding 
Burkholderia cepacia complex within 2 years prior to screening, hemoptysis > 60 mL at any time within 
30 days prior to screening were excluded from the study. 
Drugs that support lung clearance e. g. pulmozyme (DNAse) or hypertonic saline or drugs that treat 
obstructive airways, e. g. long acting ß-Agonists could impact the LCI as well. In order to minimize the 
influence of these concomitant medications on the treatment effect of inhaled antibiotics, initiation or 
discontinuation of these therapies in the last 56 days (8 weeks) prior to screening Baseline visit and 
during the study was not allowed. 
Treatments 
Tobramycin either as TIS (300 mg/5mL or 300 mg/4mL) was to be nebulized or as TIP (112 mg), as 
prescribed by the treating physician. Neither TIS nor TIP was provided to the patient, therefore 
formulations and batch number details are unknown. 
The study duration of 8 weeks comprised a complete on / off treatment cycle starting with 28 days 
inhalation followed by 28 days without study drug inhalation. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy 
Primary efficacy variable time course and changes in LCI from Baseline (Visit 2) to Week 4 (Visit 4). 
The secondary efficacy variables were the changes in FEV1 % predicted, CFU and LCI and the 
comparison among themselves at respective visit were performed for safety set. 
Safety:  
Safety analyses including treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital signs, lab parameters and 
their change from baseline were evaluated based on safety set. All listings were ordered according to 
age categories 6 to 12, > 12 to 17 and > 17 for safety set. 
Statistical Methods 
The primary efficacy endpoint was assessed by changes in LCI from Baseline to Week 4. Baseline LCI 
was the assessment taken prior to the start of TBM100, which was typically the value at Visit 2. 
Between visits comparison for changes in LCI from baseline was analyzed using an analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) model with factors patient and visit. Estimates over time were presented as least square (LS) 
means, pairwise LS-Mean differences along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and two sided p-values 
for the pairwise differences between visits. Similarly for secondary efficacy variables, estimates of 
change over time was presented as LS means, pairwise LS-mean differences along with 95% CIs and 
two sided p-values for the pairwise differences between visits. For determining the correlation between

changes from baseline in LCI, FEV1 % predicted, CFU at Week 1, Week 4 and Week 8, estimates as 
Pearson correlation coefficient with their 95% CIs and p-values were presented. 
The safety set was used for all analyses in the study, which consisted of all patients that entered the 
study (provided informed consent) and had been exposed to at least one dose of study drug. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analyse 
In total, 17 patients entered into the study and were treated with TIS (5 patients) and TIP (12 
patients). None of the patient discontinued from the study and all 17 patients completed the study. 
Two patients (16.7%) in TIP group had at least one protocol deviation in the study. Protocol deviation 
criteria included prohibited concomitant medication and other reason (1 patient (8.3%) each). 
Baseline data 
There were three paediatric patients enrolled (aged 8, 17, 17), all patients completed the study.

Efficacy results 
Change in LCI was statistically non-significant at Week 1 (p=0.5910), Week 4 (p=0.4099) and Week 8 
(p=0.1492) when compared with Baseline. Results were similar when change in LCI was analyzed as 
Week 1 vs Week 4 and Week 8 and also Week 4 vs Week 8. The mean LCI was decreased slightly over 
time when compared to Baseline (17.985), Week 1 (17.506), Week 4 (17.101) and Week 8 (16.489). 
Change from Baseline in FEV1 after 4 weeks following onset of study drug inhalation 
Change in FEV1 was statistically non-significant at Week 1 (p=0.9254), Week 4 (p=0.6961) and Week 
8 (p=0.2783) when compared with Baseline. Results were similar when change in LCI was analyzed as 
Week 1 vs Week 4 and Week 8 and also Week 4 vs Week 8. The mean FEV1 was slightly decreased at 
Week 1 as compared to Baseline (76.838 vs 76.964), however there was a slight increase in mean 
FEV1 at Week 4 (77.481) and Week 8 (78.705)

Change from Baseline in CFU after 4 weeks following onset of study drug inhalation 
Change in CFU was statistically non-significant at Week 1 (p=0.3019), Week 4 (p=0.3540) and Week 8 
(p=0.9933) when compared with Baseline. Results were similar when change in CFU was analyzed as 
Week 1 vs Week 4 and Week 8 and also Week 4 vs Week 8. Mean CFU was decreased at Week 1 
(23389.9) and Week 4 (26113.0) as compared to Baseline (56594.3), however at Week 8 mean CFU 
was comparable (56285.0) with Baseline. 
Correlation between the changes of LCI, FEV1 and CFU after 1 week, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks versus 
Baseline, respectively

Change after Week 1 from Baseline: The correlation between LCI and CFU was moderately positive 
(r=0.59) and correlation was statistically significant (p=0.0321). Correlations between LCI and FEV1 
and between FEV1 and CFU were statistically non-significant (p=0.8337 and p=0.1808 respectively). 
Change after Week 4 from baseline: The correlation between LCI and CFU was moderately positive 
(r=0.79) and correlation was statistically significant (p=0.0046). Also the correlation between FEV1 
and CFU was moderately negative (r= -0.64) and it was considered to be statistically significant 
(p=0.0462). There was moderately negative correlation between LCI and FEV1 (r= -0.39) and 
correlation was statistically non-significant. Change after Week 8 from baseline: The correlations 
between any of the paired parameters were statistically non-significant (p≥0.0617). 
Due to the small sample size exploratory endpoints will not be discussed. 
Safety results 
Exposure 
The overall mean (SD) duration of exposure was 28.1 (1.52) days. Majority of patients (76.5%) were 
exposed from 21 to 28 days and rest of the patients (23.5%) were exposed for >28 days. Mean 
exposure was comparable between both the treatment groups (TIS: 26.8 days vs TIP: 28.6 days). 
Adverse events 
Overall, 5 patients (29.4%) had experienced adverse events: TIP (3 patients (25.0%) and TIS (2 
patients (40.0%)). Most commonly affected primary system organ classes (SOCs) were respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders (3 patients (17.6%)) followed by gastrointestinal disorders, injury, 
poisoning and procedural complications, and investigations (1 patient each (5.9%)). Most commonly 
reported AEs by preferred term included abdominal pain upper, sunburn, forced expiratory volume 
decreased, cough, haemoptysis, obstructive airways disorder (1 patient each (5.9%)). 
All patients had AEs of mild severity except for 1 patient (patient ID: 1005003). This patient (41 years 
old male) was into TIP treatment group and experienced an AE of headache, which was of moderate 
severity.  
Only 1 patient (5.9%) had a TEAE suspected to be study drug related. Patient ID 1001004 (23-year-
old male): Patient was into TIP treatment group and experienced 2 TEAEs: forced expiratory volume 
decreased and obstructive airways disorder. Both the events were of mild severity and considered to

be related to study drug as assessed by the Investigator. Both the events were resolved and no 
medication was administered due to events. 
There were no deaths or SAEs in the study.  
No notable clinically significant abnormality in clinical chemistry, vital signs, and physical findings were 
observed. 
Microbiology results 
At Week 1 and Week 4, overall mean Pseudomonas aeruginosa tobramycin MIC was reduced by 1.267 
μg/mL and 4.536 μg/mL respectively, as compared to Baseline. Overall mean Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
tobramycin MIC at Week 8 was increased by 1.036 μg/mL when compared to Baseline. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
This open label single armed study included 17 patients, half of the planned number, and was 
terminated early due to recruitment difficulties. 
The study did not meet its primary efficacy objective. The main efficacy results of the study have 
shown that changes in LCI, FEV1 or CFU were not statistically significant at Week 1, Week 4 and Week 
8 when compared with baseline. There was no specific trend observed with respect to correlation 
between the changes of LCI, FEV1 and CFU after 1 week, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks versus Baseline.   
All 17 patients had pathological LCI at Baseline and Week 4. There was a slight improvement in mean 
pathological LCI at Week 4 as compared to Baseline. Eight patients had pathological FEV1 at Baseline 
and Week 4. The mean pathological FEV1 was comparable between Baseline and Week 4. Nine patients 
had normal FEV1 at Baseline and Week 4. Mean normal FEV1 was slightly improved at Week 4 when 
compared to Baseline. 
There were no untoward safety findings in this small study.  
The MAH suggests that LCI alone does not seem to be an appropriate clinical endpoint for efficacy 
studies with antibiotic treatment (either i.v. or inhaled) in small groups of CF patients, based on the 
findings in this study and in the light of recently published literature (Vanderhelst et al, 2014; Horsley 
et al, 2013. 
The MAH concludes that on the basis of the paediatric results of study CTBM100CDE02, there is no 
change in the benefit-risk profile of TOBI or TOBI Podhaler for the existing indication worldwide. The 
efficacy and safety data from this study do not warrant an update of the product information of TOBI 
or TOBI Podhaler at this stage. This can be agreed.

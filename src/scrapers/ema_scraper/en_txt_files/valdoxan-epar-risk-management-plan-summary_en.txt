Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Valdoxan®/Thymanax®/ Agomelatine Anpharm / 
Agomelatine Biogaran / Agomelatine Egis (Agomelatine) 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  Valdoxan®/Thymanax®/ 
Agomelatine Anpharm / Agomelatine Biogaran / Agomelatine Egis. The RMP details important 
risks of Valdoxan®/Thymanax®/ Agomelatine Anpharm / Agomelatine Biogaran / Agomelatine 
Egis,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about 
Valdoxan®/Thymanax®/ Agomelatine Anpharm / Agomelatine Biogaran / Agomelatine Egis's 
risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Valdoxan®/Thymanax®/ Agomelatine Anpharm / Agomelatine Biogaran / Agomelatine Egis's 
summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential information 
to  healthcare  professionals  and  patients  on  how  Valdoxan®/Thymanax®/  Agomelatine 
Anpharm / Agomelatine Biogaran / Agomelatine Egis should be used. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Valdoxan®/Thymanax®/ Agomelatine  Anpharm / Agomelatine Biogaran / Agomelatine Egis 
are  authorised  for  treatment  of  major  depressive  episodes  in  adults  (see  SmPC  for  the  full 
indication). It contains Agomelatine as the active substance and it is given by oral route. 
Further information about the evaluation of Valdoxan / Thymanax’s benefits can be found in 
Valdoxan®/Thymanax®’s  EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the 
EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage:

II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise 
the risks  
Important risks of Valdoxan®/Thymanax®/ Agomelatine Anpharm / Agomelatine Biogaran / 
Agomelatine Egis, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for 
learning more about Valdoxan®/Thymanax®/ Agomelatine Anpharm / Agomelatine Biogaran / 
Agomelatine Egis's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
-  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
- 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
-  The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
 
 
-  The medicine’s  legal  status - the way  a medicine is supplied  to  the  patient (e.g.  with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  the  case  of  Valdoxan®/Thymanax®/  Agomelatine  Anpharm  /  Agomelatine  Biogaran  / 
Agomelatine  Egis,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In  addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions  is  collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Valdoxan®/Thymanax®/ Agomelatine Anpharm / Agomelatine Biogaran / 
Agomelatine Egis are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate 
or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks 
can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are  concerns  for  which  there  is 
sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of  Valdoxan®/Thymanax®/  Agomelatine  Anpharm  / 
Agomelatine Biogaran / Agomelatine Egis. Potential risks are concerns for which an association 
with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not 
been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on 
the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on 
the long-term use of the medicine);

Risk minimisation measures 
In clinical trials, hepatic reactions observed on Agomelatine usually 
consist  of  asymptomatic  isolated  transaminases  elevation  of  liver 
enzymes  (transaminases)  in  the  majority  of  patients,  detectable 
within the first months of treatment and reversible. 
In post-marketing experience, cases of liver injury, including hepatic 
failure (few cases were exceptionally reported with fatal outcome or 
liver  transplantation  in  patients  with  hepatic  injury  risk  factors), 
elevations  of  liver  enzymes  exceeding  10  times  the  upper  limit  of 
normal, hepatitis and jaundice have been reported in patients treated 
with Agomelatine. 
Known  risk  factors  of  hepatic  injury  (obesity/overweight/non-
alcoholic  fatty  liver  disease,  diabetes,  alcohol  use  disorder  and/or 
substantial  alcohol  intake  or  concomitant  medicinal  products 
associated with risk of hepatic injury).

Risk minimisation measures 
Agomelatine  is  metabolised  mainly  by  cytochrome  P450  1A2 
(CYP1A2)  (90%)  and  by  CYP2C9/19  (10%).  Medicinal  products 
that  interact  with  these  isoenzymes  may  decrease  or  increase  the 
bioavailability of agomelatine.  
Fluvoxamine,  a  potent  CYP1A2  and  moderate  CYP2C9  inhibitor 
markedly inhibits the metabolism of agomelatine resulting in a 60-
fold (range 12-412) increase of agomelatine exposure. 
Agomelatine must not be used in patients who are taking medicines 
that modify/increase the expected dose of agomelatine in the blood, 
such as fluvoxamine (another antidepressant) and ciprofloxacin (an 
antibiotic).

POST-AUTHORISATION SUMMARY OF POSITIVE OPINION* 
for  
ORENCIA 
International Nonproprietary Name (INN): abatacept 
On  17  December  2009  the  Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (CHMP)  adopted  a 
positive  opinion**  to  recommend  the  variation  to  the  terms  of  the  marketing  authorisation  for  the 
medicinal product Orencia. The Marketing Authorisation Holder for this medicinal product is Bristol-
Myers Squibb Pharma EEIG. 
The CHMP adopted a new indication as follows***: 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
ORENCIA  in  combination  with  methotrexate  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe 
active  rheumatoid  arthritis  in  adult  patients  who  have  had  an  insufficient  response  or  intolerance  to 
other  disease-modifying  anti-rheumatic  drugs  (DMARDs)  including  at  least  one  tumour  necrosis 
factor (TNF) inhibitor. A reduction in the progression of joint damage and improvement of physical 
function have been demonstrated during combination treatment with abatacept and methotrexate. 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
ORENCIA  in  combination  with  methotrexate  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe 
active  polyarticular  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (JIA)  in  paediatric  patients  6 years  of  age  and  older 
who  have  had  an  insufficient  response  to  other  DMARDs  including  at  least  one  TNF  inhibitor. 
ORENCIA has not been studied in children under 6 years old.

Characteristics  (SPC)  which  will  be  published  in  the  revised  European  Public  Assessment  Report 
(EPAR)  and  will  be  available  in  all  official  European  Union  languages  after  the  variation  to  the 
marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

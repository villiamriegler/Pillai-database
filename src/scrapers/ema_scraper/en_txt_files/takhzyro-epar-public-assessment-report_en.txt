2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
The claimed indication for lanadelumab is for routine prevention of angioedema attacks and the control of 
symptoms of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in patients aged 12 years and older. 
2.1.1.  Epidemiology  
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by unpredictable recurrent 
episodes of subcutaneous or submucosal oedema typically affecting the skin, upper airway, and gastrointestinal 
tract.  
At the time of the orphan designation (procedure number EMA/COMP/603277/2015 dated 13 November 2015), 
hereditary angioedema affected less than 0.5 in 10,000 people in the European Union (EU). 
2.1.2.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Hereditary angioedema is caused by mutations in the gene coding for C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), resulting 
in deficiency (HAE type I) or dysfunction (HAE type II) of C1-INH protein. 
C1-INH is the major serine protease inhibitor of the early complement proteases as well as the contact system 
proteases, plasma kallikrein and coagulation factor XIIa. Deficiency of C1-INH within the kallikrein-kinin 
(contact system) is believed to result in the loss of inhibition of plasma kallikrein activity leading to the increased 
bradykinin release from high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) and vascular leak mediated by bradykinin 
binding to the B2 receptor (B2-R) on the surface of endothelial cells. 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 9/114 
  
  
 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Acute angioedema attacks in HAE are characterized by painful, non-pruritic swelling of the face, larynx, 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, limbs, and/or genitalia, which may last up to 5 or more days. Most patients suffer 
multiple attacks per year and most patients with HAE experience attacks at multiple sites. Abdominal attacks are 
often associated with nausea, vomiting, and severe pain; intestinal symptoms resembling abdominal 
emergencies may lead to unnecessary surgery (Zuraw, 2008). 
Approximately 50% of all patients with HAE will experience a potentially life-threatening laryngeal attack in their 
lifetime (Bork et al., 2006). The incidence of death due to untreated laryngeal attacks is 30% to 40% and the 
risk of death is 3-fold greater in undiagnosed vs diagnosed patients (Bork et al., 2012; Bork et al., 2000). An 
audit conducted in the United Kingdom identified 55 HAE-related deaths in 33 families (Jolles et al., 2014). One 
death secondary to laryngeal oedema was recorded among 10 HAE patients included in a recent French study 
(Javaud et al., 2015). 
Due to the unforeseeable nature of the attacks, HAE has an important negative impact on the quality of life for 
patients suffering from the disorder. Among other things, frequent attacks negatively affect education and work. 
Since symptoms often begin by age of 10, this is especially important in children and adolescents as negative 
effects on performance in school will affect the future professional career. 
Three types of HAE have been described: 
•  HAE type 1 is caused by deletion or by expression of a truncated transcript leading to a quantitative 
defect in C1-INH;  
•  HAE type 2 is caused by point mutations leading to a qualitative defect in C1-INH.  
•  HAE type 3 predominantly involves females, with the use of oestrogen-containing oral contraceptives 
and pregnancy being precipitating factors. HAE type 3 is not caused by C1-INH deficiency but is 
associated with an increase in kininogenase activity leading to elevated levels of bradykinin. 
2.1.4.  Management 
Several clinically effective options for treating and preventing HAE attacks are approved for use. These include 
agents targeted at different components of the kallikrein-kinin pathway. C1-INH replacement therapy is 
achieved with human plasma-derived C1-INH (pdC1-INH) concentrates or recombinant human C1-INH. 
Ecallantide inhibits kallikrein activity and icatibant acts as bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist. 
HAE International treatment guidelines state that the goal of prophylactic treatment is to reduce the frequency 
and severity of attacks and thus to increase patients’ quality of life. The treatment guidelines recommend 
C1-INH or attenuated androgens as standard of care to prevent HAE attacks however, there are numerous 
contraindications, therapeutic class adverse events (AEs), risk factors for AEs, tolerance to therapy, and overall 
suboptimal control of HAE due to the need higher or more frequent dosing, threat of breakthrough attacks, and 
low attack-free rates.  
Plasma-derived C1-INH for intravenous use is approved European Union (EU)-wide for routine prevention of 
HAE attacks in adults, adolescents and children (6 years old and above) with severe and recurrent attacks, who 
are intolerant to or insufficiently protected by oral prevention treatments, or patients who are inadequately 
managed with repeated acute treatment. It requires IV infusion every three or four days due to its short half-life 
and may necessitate the placement of an indwelling catheter. Plasma-derived C1-INH has class warnings 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 10/114 
  
  
including hypersensitivity, thromboembolic events, and viral safety (risk of transmission of infectious agents) 
due to its plasma derivation. 
Berinert, a plasma-derived C1-INH for subcutaneous injection twice weekly, was recently approved for the 
prevention of HAE in EU through the decentralised procedure. The procedure involved 22 member states, thus 
the treatment will not be available in all member states.  
In addition, while not indicated for HAE patients in all EU countries, attenuated androgens and antifibrinolytics 
are available in many countries and used for prophylaxis in HAE patients.  
Current treatment guidelines recommend against the use of antifibrinolytics for long-term prophylaxis (LTP) due 
to limited efficacy. Attenuated androgens (e.g. danazol, stanozolol, and oxandrolone) increase hepatic 
production of C1 INH protein and are limited by safety issues. 
In spite of available medicinal products for the treatment of acute attacks, HAE still is a disorder with high 
mortality. Although existing preventive therapy with C1-INH ameliorates the number and severity of attacks, 
some patients still experience breakthrough attacks.  
About the product 
Lanadelumab is a recombinant fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody inhibitor of active pKal that binds both 
soluble and membrane-bound forms of the enzyme. It is hypothesized that by specifically inhibiting pKal, 
lanadelumab will prevent the release of bradykinin from HMWK, thereby preventing the vascular leak and 
swelling that is initiated when bradykinin binds to the B2 receptor. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was considered to be 
of major public health interest. In spite of available medicinal products for the treatment of acute attacks as well 
as prevention of attacks, HAE remains a disorder with high mortality with some patients still experiencing life 
threatening breakthrough attacks. 
The administration via subcutaneous route and frequency of administration of lanadelumab (Q2 weeks) offers 
an improvement for patient care compared to other substances registered for prevention of HAE attacks in the 
EU. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a sterile preservative-free solution for subcutaneous administration 
containing 300 mg of lanadelumab as the active substance at a concentration of 150 mg/ml. Each 300 mg vial 
is filled with a nominal volume of 2.0 ml of finished product. 
Other ingredients are: disodium phosphate dihydrate, citric acid monohydrate, histidine, sodium chloride, 
polysorbate 80 and water for injections (WFI).  
The finished product primary packaging components consist of a Type I glass vial, a rubber stopper, and a crimp 
seal with cap. Two needles and one syringe are provided together in an administration kit that will be 
co-packaged with the lanadelumab finished product vial. The medical devices (needle and syringe) are CE 
marked.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Lanadelumab (INN) is a recombinant fully human IgG1 kappa light chain monoclonal antibody expressed in 
Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, discovered by screening an antibody phage display library against active 
plasma kallikrein. Lanadelumab is composed of two light (213 residues) and two heavy (451 residues) chains 
(MW 145.7 kDa, theoretical, non-glycosylated). The identified affinity matured antibody was codon optimized 
for expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Lanadelumab contains six unique (4 H-H and 2 L-L) 
intra-chain and three (2 H-H and 1 H-L) unique inter-chain disulfide bonds. 
Complementarity determining regions (CDRs) in lanadelumab bind plasma kallikrein to occlude the active site 
and inhibit proteolysis of the endogenous substrate, high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK), thereby 
attenuating the generation of bradykinin, the potent vasodilator and mediator of hereditary angioedema 
pathology. The applicant concludes that lanadelumab have minimal Fc effector function potential. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
Lanadelumab active substance is manufactured by Rentschler Biopharma SE, Laupheim, Germany (Rentschler). 
All sites involved in lanadelumab active substance manufacturing and testing are GMP compliant. 
A batch of active substance is defined as the material purified from one single-use production bioreactor, 
cultivated from a single working cell bank (WCB) vial. The entire content of the bioreactor is purified to produce 
lanadelumab active substance. 
The active substance is produced using mammalian derived cells. The lanadelumab cell culture process includes 
vial thaw (one single WCB vial), inoculum expansion through a series of vessels with increasing working volumes 
(shake flasks, rocking and stirred tank bioreactors), a fed-batch production bioreactor, and cell culture harvest 
clarification utilizing depth and 0.2 µm filtration. Immediately prior to harvest, samples are withdrawn for tests 
of adventitious agents. At harvest the production bioreactor is cooled and the entire content is filtered.  
The lanadelumab purification process includes chromatography steps, viral inactivation and filtration steps and 
two ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) steps for concentration and buffer exchange. The filtration and filling step 
includes conditioning of the process stream, filling of the active substance into bottles and freezing. 
Multiple cycles of each purification unit operation are employed to process an entire harvest.  
Reprocessing (defined as a one-time 0.2 µm refiltration) is acceptable for the chromatography step pools. There 
is no impact on product quality after refiltration in these steps. 
Refiltration will be concurrently validated. 
A product and process control strategy in accordance with ICH Q8, Q9 and Q10 guidance has been established. 
Elements of the control strategy are defined as follows:  
  Critical quality attributes (CQAs) are the properties or characteristics for which an acceptable range has 
been established to ensure the desired product quality.  
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 12/114 
  
  
 
 
Process parameters are input variables that can be directly controlled, and critical process parameters 
(CPP) are those whose variability has an impact on a CQA. All input variables that do not have an impact 
on a CQA are designated as non-CPPs. 
Performance attributes (PA) are output variables or outcomes that cannot be directly controlled but 
indicate that the process performed as expected. An in-process control (IPC) is a performance attribute 
that may be an indicator of product quality. 
The acceptable ranges of the CPPs are considered the proven acceptable ranges (PARs). The criticality of each 
process parameter and selection of IPCs to assure process control were determined using a risk-based approach 
based on process characterization data and platform knowledge. 
Process parameter set points, normal operating ranges (NORs) and IPC ranges for each unit operation are 
established and identified in the batch records. Excursions outside the normal operating ranges are captured as 
deviations to the batch record. All deviations are assessed by Quality Assurance prior to batch disposition. 
An overview of CPPs, IPCs and their corresponding acceptable ranges for the cell culture, harvest steps and 
purification steps of the lanadelumab process has been provided. 
Changes in NORs within PARs are documented by the change control procedure and are not considered 
reportable. Changes outside PARs are handled via applications for variations, regardless of parameter criticality. 
Excursions outside NORs are captured as deviations for both critical and non-critical process parameters, and 
evaluated regarding impact to quality, safety and efficacy (the criticality is factored into the evaluation). For 
process parameters, the term ‘acceptable range’ is the same as the ICH ‘proven acceptable range’. IPC limits are 
either ‘acceptance criteria’ (rejection limits) or ‘acceptable ranges’ (action limits). 
Control of materials 
The raw materials have been sufficiently described.  
The source, history and generation of the production cell line are well described. 
The current cell banking system utilizes a two tier system consisting of a master cell bank (MCB) derived from 
the research cell bank (RCB) and a working cell bank (WCB) derived from a single vial of the MCB. Both the MCB 
and WCB were produced and tested according to cGMP regulations and ICH Q5A, Q5B and Q5D guidelines.  
A post-production cell bank (PPCB) was prepared from one of the process performance qualification batches 
(PPQ2) and tested to ensure species identity, the absence of adventitious agent contaminants and genetic 
stability.  
The overall approach and result of the cell bank testing is approvable.  
Process validation 
The process performance qualification (PPQ) studies were executed using the commercial process. The life-cycle 
of the lanadelumab process will be controlled through the process control strategy, release testing, stability 
monitoring and the continued process verification (CPV) program. 
The process performance qualification of the manufacturing steps for active substance has been adequately 
described and reported. Attribute results were generally within PPQ acceptance criteria. The manufacturing 
process for active substance can be considered validated. Attributes identified for process monitoring, CQAs at 
a minimum, are trended periodically to support the continued process verification activities.

The information provided regarding characterisation and validation of resin reuse is sufficient and the resin 
reuse at-scale validation approach is acceptable. 
The proposal for concurrent process validation of refiltration is acceptable.  
In-process pool hold times are adequately validated. 
The information provided regarding shipping validation is sufficient. 
Manufacturing process development 
The lanadelumab manufacturing process was developed in several steps. An overview of the different process 
versions has been provided.  
During the upstream scale-up, the major change to the downstream process was increased number of cycles for 
the chromatography steps.  
A major objection was raised regarding comparability between the clinical material and the commercial 
material. Additional data from extended characterisation, in-process controls, and short-term stressed stability 
studies (batch release data was submitted with the original application) was provided in response to the major 
objection and deemed satisfactory.  
The comparability studies were performed according to ICH Q5E, and batches were compared based on routine 
in-process data, release testing, characterization testing, and short term stressed stability data with 
prospectively defined acceptance criteria.  
In conclusion, based on the submitted data, comparability has been considered demonstrated for the process 
changes.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The information provided regarding assigned CQAs and the control strategy is adequate. The quality attributes 
evaluated and the criticality summary have been provided. 
Quality by Design (QbD) elements such as risk assessment and multivariate experimental design were used 
during process characterisation. Results from multivariate (and univariate) experiments were used to evaluate 
process parameter criticality, but parameter ranges were mainly established based on historical development 
and manufacturing and no design space is claimed. The terminology and definitions used for the control strategy 
elements is mainly in line with ICH Q8(R2)/Q9/Q10/Q11 as regards CQAs, CPPs and non-CPPs. The applicant 
considers CPP acceptable ranges to be proven acceptable ranges (PARs). This is acceptable.  
Characterisation 
Biochemical, biophysical, and biological characterisation of lanadelumab was conducted to provide a 
comprehensive understanding of the structural and functional properties and to enable an assessment of the 
criticality of product quality attributes.  
The active substance has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and biological state-of-the-art 
methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure of a monoclonal IgG1κ antibody.   
An overview of process- and product-related impurities and contaminants and the tests used to detect them has 
been provided. 
The approach to control residual DNA and protein A by in-process analyses and residual host cell protein (HCP) 
with the release specification is endorsed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 14/114 
  
  
The purification process demonstrated sufficient and robust clearance of several bioreactor process-derived 
impurities.  
Specification 
The release and shelf life specification for the active substance has been established to ensure the identity, 
strength, purity, quality and safety of lanadelumab through its shelf life. The proposed specifications are 
consistent with ICH Q6B.  
The analytical methods and the specifications were derived through the evaluation of (1) development 
experience, (2) characterization of the active substance and process validation data, (3) manufacturing history, 
release and ongoing stability data for active substance batches, and (4) toxicological and clinical evaluation of 
finished product manufactured with the active substance. In addition, compendia requirements for 
protein-based products were considered. 
The commercial specification strategy focused on analytical data generated for active substance batches 
representing the validated commercial process. 
HCP is below LOQ in all commercial scale batches, as analysed by a commercial kit. Given the batch data and the 
capability of the purification process to remove HCP from the active substance, the proposed limit seems 
reasonable.  
The justifications for omitting residual DNA and protein A analyses from release testing are acceptable.  
High mannose is classified as a critical quality attribute due to its possible impact to pharmacokinetics. It has 
been demonstrated that the level of high mannose is constant during long term storage of the active substance, 
manufacture of finished product and long term storage of finished product, thus a control for high mannose 
(man5 + man8) is included in the active substance specification. The proposed limit is acceptable considering 
that the levels of high mannose are in the low range when compared to other monoclonal antibodies, that the 
possibility of measurable differences in pharmacokinetics seems very low within the proposed range and that 
any potential negative effect on quality by high mannose levels in future batches is expected to be captured by 
other methods in the specification.  
Even though the statistical approach chosen to set the specification limits (tolerance interval) is not fully 
supported, the levels of impurities are low and based on the presented data the specifications are found 
acceptable.  
Analytical methods  
All analytical procedures used for testing of the active substance are described in sufficient detail. 
The potency is determined by measuring the equilibrium inhibition constant, Ki, for inhibition of human plasma 
kallikrein (pKal) activity. The result is reported in percent potency relative to a reference standard. The potency 
assay is also used as an identity test. 
The use of a commercially available, generic HCP ELISA assay is considered acceptable in view of the low levels 
of residual HCP in the active substance. Additional data on the specificity of the generic HCP assay has been 
provided. It is noted that the applicant intends to replace the generic HCP ELISA by a process-specific assay.

Batch analyses 
Batch data for all batches produced have been presented. Each batch was tested to the specification in place at 
the time of manufacture. Although some limits differ, the release data is reasonably consistent for all attributes.  
Batch data from preclinical and clinical development batches is also presented. Overall, the batch release results 
seem consistent. 
Reference materials 
To date, three lanadelumab reference standards, one historical, one primary and one working standard, have 
been produced. Data from release testing and characterisation of the current primary and working reference 
standards have been presented and considered acceptable. Reference standards are re-evaluated annually. 
Release testing, characterisation and annual retesting of future reference standards are described in the dossier. 
The approach is acceptable. 
Information provided regarding the historical reference standard is sufficient. 
Container closure 
The active substance container closure system is a sterile USP Class VI polyethylene terephthalate glycol 
copolyester (PETG) square bottle (2000 mL) fitted with a high density polyethylene screw cap. The bottles and 
caps are received with a Certificate of Analysis issued from the vendor, pre-sterilized by gamma radiation, 
ready-for-use and require no further processing or cleaning. The container closure is composed of materials that 
are considered safe for use, and is compatible with the active substance.  
Stability 
The container closure systems for all batches in the stability studies are of the same material of construction as 
that used for the commercial active substance container closure system. 
The stability studies are generally in compliance with ICH Q5C and the chosen analytical methods appear 
adequately stability indicating.  
The proposed end-of-shelf life specification acceptance limits are the same as the release limits as no significant 
trends were found during stability testing. 
Stability data generated at the long-term storage condition for the primary batches and for the supportive 
batches has been presented, as well as stability data at the accelerated temperature. The data supports the 
proposed commercial shelf life for the active substance. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development  
The finished product is a solution for injection containing 300 mg of lanadelumab as active substance, at a 
concentration of 150 mg/ml. Each 300 mg vial is filled with a nominal volume of 2.0 ml of finished product. The 
vials are intended for total use. 
Besides the active ingredient, lanadelumab, the composition comprises only compendial components (disodium 
phosphate dihydrate, citric acid monohydrate, histidine, sodium chloride, polysorbate 80, water for injections), 
typically used for formulating monoclonal antibodies, and is acceptable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 16/114 
  
  
The primary packaging components consist of a Type I glass vial, a rubber stopper, and a crimp seal with cap. 
The materials in contact with the product comply with Ph. Eur. Two needles and one syringe are provided 
together in an administration kit that will be co-packaged with the finished product vial. The medical devices 
(needles and syringe) are CE marked. 
An acceptable overview of the formulation development has been provided, including satisfactory data 
supporting the proposed composition.  
The same finished product buffer formulation, although with different protein concentrations (100 mg/ml or 150 
mg/ml), has been used throughout clinical studies and is proposed for commercial production. 
The only difference in the finished product formulation from Phase 1 clinical supply to Phase 3 and commercial 
product is an increase in protein concentration from 100 mg/ml to 150 mg/ml. There was no change to the 
excipients in the formulation matrix from the Phase 1 clinical drug product to the Phase 3 and commercial 
product. The formulation of the finished product is identical to that of the active substance. 
The Phase 1 studies were performed with a 100 mg/ml solution. The manufacturing process was transferred, 
including scale-up and change of concentration. This process, referred to as Version 1, was used for the Phase 
3 studies. It was then further optimized to the commercial process, referred to as Version 2. PPQ was executed 
with the Version 2 process. 
As a whole, the manufacturing process development has been described in sufficient detail. The results of 
process characterization studies were used to set the PARs. The development of the control strategy is generally 
well explained. The control strategy was based on CQAs, process characterisation, parameter impact 
assessment/parameter classification and process capability assessment.  
Comparability studies were performed to assess the changes implemented during development.  
The development of the primary container closure system has been sufficiently described in the dossier. 
Extractables/leachables studies were performed on the rubber stopper. Safety evaluation of the results confirm 
that all identified and quantified organic extractables have Human Daily Exposure values that are below the 
respective Tolerable Daily Intake when calculated for the maximum dose of 300 mg lanadelumab every 2 weeks.  
Compatibility with the syringe and in-use stability for the finished product in the administration syringe has been 
demonstrated and is considered appropriate. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is released by Shire Pharmaceuticals Ireland Ltd., Dublin, Ireland.  
The manufacturing process and process controls have been presented. The manufacturing steps comprise 
receipt of frozen formulated active substance, storage, thawing, pooling and mixing, bioburden reduction 
filtration, redundant sterile filtration, filling, stoppering, capping, lot printing, visual inspection, bulk packaging, 
shipping, labelling, and packaging.  
The batch numbering system has been described. The applicant proposes that the acceptable ranges for process 
parameters and IPCs are considered the PARs. This is acceptable. There is no reprocessing. 
Only one process parameter, fill weight, has been identified as critical. 
One in-process hold time has been defined and is related to hold of post-bioburden reduction filtered product. 
The proposed hold time is supported by PPQ results and is acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 17/114 
  
  
For the PPQ, consecutive full-scale batches of finished product were manufactured, including at least one 
minimum and one maximum batch size.  
All results met the protocol acceptance criteria as well as the finished product release specification. 
The presented validation of the aseptic processing is acceptable. 
The proposed total time out of refrigeration (TOR) from the start of thawed active substance pooling to the end 
of finished product bulk packaging is supported by hold time challenges during PPQ and is acceptable. 
Filter validation studies have been performed and included testing for microbial retention, product-specific 
bubble point, filter compatibility, lanadelumab antibody and polysorbate 80 binding, and extractables and 
leachables testing. A total product/filter contact time has been defined. 
Results from shipping qualification studies and a simulated shipping study have been provided and are 
acceptable. 
In conclusion, the process validation data are acceptable. 
Product specification 
Specification testing proposed for finished product batch release includes assays regarding the parameters 
identity, content, potency, purity and impurities and microbiological quantity tests as well as general properties 
tests. 
The release specification for the finished product is the same as that of the active substance except for the 
finished product-specific compendial tests (extractable volume and attributes related to the container closure 
system). 
Sterility is tested at release, while container closure integrity by dye ingress is performed on stability in lieu of 
sterility testing. This is acceptable. A test for polysorbate 80 was included upon request. 
 Analytical procedures 
Several of the analytical procedures used for release and stability testing of finished product are also used for 
release and stability testing of the active substance. The non-compendial method specific to the control of 
finished product, i.e. the container closure integrity test, has been appropriately validated. Compendial methods 
have been appropriately verified for their intended use. A summary of analytical procedures modifications 
during development has been provided. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analyses data has been presented for batches of the 300 mg strength, manufactured at the commercial 
site from active substance manufactured at the commercial scale. All data presented complies with the proposed 
finished product specifications. 
Batch analyses data is also provided for development batches.  
In conclusion, the batch analyses data demonstrates acceptable batch-to-batch consistency and reproducibility 
of the manufacturing process. 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018

Reference materials 
The reference standard for testing of finished product is the same as described for active substance. 
Stability of the product 
The stability studies have been conducted in accordance with ICH at the recommended long-term storage 
condition of 5°C±3°C and accelerated condition. The primary stability batches include three PPQ lots and three 
development batches. These six batches are manufactured at the commercial site using processes 
representative of the full-scale commercial process and were stored in the container closure system proposed 
for marketing. The development batches are manufactured with the Version 1 manufacturing process; the PPQ 
batches are manufactured with the Version 2 process (i.e. commercial process).  
After storage at the long-term storage condition of 5°C±3°C, test results for all product quality attributes are 
within the commercial specification.  
Vials may be stored below 25°C for a single period of 14 days, but not beyond the expiry date.  
The results of photostability studies demonstrate that lanadelumab is photosensitive at the ICH Q1B conditions. 
Therefore, the vials should be stored protected from light (i.e. in the outer carton).  
In conclusion, a finished product shelf life of 24 months stored at 5°C±3°C is supported by the data provided.  
Adventitious agents  
No animal derived raw material is used in the manufacturing process other than the CHO-derived production cell 
line. Foetal bovine serum was used during development of the production cell line and the applicant has provided 
a TSE certificate of suitability issued by the EDQM.  
The MCB, WCB and cells at the limit of in vitro cell age have been tested in accordance with ICH Q5A. Summary 
descriptions of the test methods used have been provided demonstrating the suitability of the respective 
methods. 
The manufacturing process includes virus removal and inactivation steps. The ability of the purification process 
to remove virus was evaluated using model viruses. The reports from the virus clearance studies contain 
sufficiently detailed information to demonstrate compliance with ICH Q5A and CPMP/BWP/268/65. Data 
supporting the relevance of the down-scaled process steps as models for the commercial process has been 
presented in sufficient detail. The results provided also support the claimed viral clearance throughout the resin 
lifetime for the chromatography steps.  
The data presented demonstrates effective reduction of a broad range of viruses. In addition, an acceptable 
safety margin has been demonstrated for retroviruses as requested by the guidelines.   
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product 
should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 19/114 
  
  
A major objection regarding comparability between the clinical and the commercial process versions was raised 
in during the procedure. Based on the additional data provided in response, it could be concluded that material 
from the different process versions can be considered comparable and consequently the major objection was 
considered resolved.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have been presented to give reassurance 
on viral/TSE safety. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The applicant submitted a complete non clinical package to support the indication. The description of the 
non-clinical data assessed by the CHMP is mentioned below.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
In vitro                                                                                                                                         
In vitro studies were conducted to characterize the nonclinical pharmacology of lanadelumab, including its 
binding to pKal, and its functional inhibition on pKal-induced generation of cHMWK and bradykinin. ELISA and 
fluorescence based assays demonstrated that lanadelumab-induced inhibition of pKal reduces both generation 
of bradykinin and hydrolysis of a synthetic Pro-Phe-Arg-AMC peptide reference substrate. The inhibition 
constant (K i)-value for inhibition of human pKal-mediated hydrolysis of the reference substrate was about 0.125 
nM. Lanadelumab was also a potent inhibitor of mouse, rat and cynomolgus monkey pKal with Ki-values of 
0.300, 0.170 and 0.069 nM, respectively. In contrast, lanadelumab was about 100-fold less potent inhibitor for 
rabbit pKal (Ki=14.1 nM) compared to the other enzyme orthologues. A surface plasmon resonance based assay 
with various pKal active site-directed inhibitors and prekallikrein indicated that binding of lanadelumab to pKal 
include the active site of the enzyme with no affinity to prekallikrein. X-ray crystal structure analysis of the 
lanadelumab Fab-pKal complex revealed interactions between HCs CDR1, CDR3 and LC CDR2 and that the 
lanadelumab epitope includes both amino acids in the active site as well as residues in the vicinity of the active 
site. The specificity of lanadelumab for active pKal without lanadelumab proteolysis is mediated by the 
orientation of Hv CDR3 binding to the S1-3 substrate sites of pKal. Bioactivity of lanadelumab in human plasma 
pretreated with lanadelumab in vitro and in plasma of rats and cynomolgus monkeys treated with lanadelumab 
was monitored by a Western blot assay via inhibition pKal-mediated cleavage of HMWK to cHMWK following 
contact system activation. In both the human in vitro and rat and cynomolgus monkey ex vivo 
pharmacodynamic bioactivity assays lanadelumab protected complete cleavage of HMWK in a dose dependent 
manner.

In vivo 
Due to the lack of established non-clinical animal models of HAE, the in vivo pharmacodynamics of lanadelumab 
was evaluated in the carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema model, in which bradykinin is a known 
proinflammatory mediator, and that can be used to access mechanistic aspects of pKal inhibition. In addition, of 
carrageenan to rat plasma in vitro has been shown to generate active pKal. Injection of carrageenan resulted in 
a maximum 2-fold increase in paw-volume 4 h after challenge. Lanadelumab pretreatment was found to inhibit 
carrageenan induced rat oedema in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum inhibition at 30 mg 
lanadelumab/kg by 73% following SC and 62% following IV infusion, respectively, suggesting an inhibition of 
pKal functional effects in vivo. Prophylactic inhibition of pKal appeared more effective than acute administration 
as the pharmacodynamic effect was more pronounced after SC dosing (24 h prior to carrageenan) as compared 
to IP administration (30 min prior to carrageenan) despite similar serum concentrations of lanadelumab (8 h 
post carrageenan).  
This demonstrated the activity of lanadelumab, however, as the rat carrageenan paw oedema model is not a 
non-clinical model of HAE, efficacious doses in this model were not used to predict clinical efficacious doses, 
which is considered appropriate. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
The potential for lanadelumab to inhibit the non-target serine proteases (activated protein C, C1s, cathepsin G, 
Factor VIIa, Factor Xa, Factor XIa, Factor XIIa, granzyme B, hepsin, matriptase, neutrophil elastase, plasmin, 
thrombin alpha, tissue plasminogen activator, tissue kallikrein 1, tissue kallikrein 2, tissue kallikrein 5, tissue 
kallikrein 12, trypsin, urokinase) were evaluated in vitro. All these serine proteases sharing key active amino 
acids and catalytic mechanism with pKal were evaluated at lanadelumab concentrations ≥ 1µM. Lanadelumab 
did not inhibit any of the 20 evaluated serine proteases including FXIa, which is most similar to pKal 
(74% similar amino acid sequences between the full length proteins and 82% similarity between the catalytic 
domains). The expected Cmax for lanadelumab in the highest and most frequent dose (300 mg 2qw patients in 
DX-2930-03) is 35 µg/mL (240 nM). 
The potential of lanadelumab to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) was evaluated using cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells 
(HUVEC). Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity was measured using natural killer cells isolated from 3 
different donors at effector-to-target cell ratios of 10:1. Complement-dependent cytotoxicity was performed 
using rabbit complement. Cell lysis was measured according to the release of the intracellular enzyme 
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase using a bioluminescent substrate. The primary positive controls for 
these experiments were 2 rabbit monoclonal antibodies against CD31, which induced ADCC and CDC in HUVEC. 
Rituximab was included as an additional positive control, which induced ADCC and CDC on target cells (Daudi B 
cells).  Under these assay conditions, lanadelumab-mediated ADCC and CDC were not observed, which is 
considered appropriate. Dissociation constant (K d) values for purified effector function receptors (Fcγ RI 
[CD64], Fcγ RIIA [CD32a], Fcγ RIIB/C [CD32b/c], Fcγ RIIIA [CD16a], Fcγ RIIIB [CD16b] and C1q determined 
by surface plasma resonance were equal to or lower than reported for other tested IgG antibodies. Based on the 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 21/114 
  
  
 
combined in vitro characterization experiments conducted lanadelumab is not considered to be a high risk 
molecule for eliciting ADCC or CDC.  A general secondary pharmacology profiling panel for off-target activity was 
not provided, which is acceptable for biologics. An in depth discussion on potential risks related to inhibition of 
pKal, particularly during long-term treatment with lanadelumab, based on experimental data and supporting 
references with focus on clot formation/ dissolution and potential consequences in humans was provided by the 
Applicant. Based on its indication (HAE) and mechanism of action (specific and incomplete pKal inhibition 
supporting a basal bradykinin generation) it is agreed that this discussion presented by the Applicant does not 
present any safety concerns in HAE patients. Long-term safety has been included as missing information in the 
RMP. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology studies with lanadelumab were integrated in the 4 week and 6 month repeat-dose toxicity 
studies performed in rat (function observational battery) and cynomolgus monkey (cardiovascular and 
respiratory). This approach follows the ICH Guidance S6 (R1) and is considered appropriate. 
No effects on the functional and behavioural or respiratory parameters evaluated were observed. 
In the 4 week SC toxicity study in cynomolgus monkey a mild reduction of heart rate detected by longer RR 
interval was observed in males dosed with 50 mg/kg/week at 19 to 22 hours following the day 28 dose. No 
concomitant changes in ECG parameters were detected in males (5 and 25 mg/kg) or females (5, 25 and 50 
mg/kg). No effects on monitored blood pressure were noted. 
Deficiencies in the timing of the recordings of the ECG parameters in relation to blood sampling for toxicokinetics 
as well as monitoring of blood pressure in restrained animals were detected. However, as the pharmacokinetic 
profile of lanadelumab is extended and the reduced heart rate observed in males of the 50 mg/kg group was 
transient and within the range of historical control data and no concomitant changes in the other ECG waveform 
or conduction parameters or blood pressure were observed in combination with absence of clinical signs or 
changes in behaviour patterns or body temperatures, this is not considered to be of toxicological significance. 
The applicant did not submit any in vitro safety studies such as hERG-channel testing. This is acceptable 
considering the nature of the drug product being a monoclonal antibody. 
No lanadelumab related cardiovascular findings were observed in the 6-months study in cynomolgus monkey 
with an average Cmax value of 744 µg/mL at study week 28 at the NOAEL of 50 mg/kg, providing a 21-fold 
exposure margin to expected maximum clinical exposure in HAE-patients treated with 300 mg lanadelumab by 
SC administration every 2 weeks. No cardiovascular effects were observed in the clinical trials conducted with 
lanadelumab. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No dedicated pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted with lanadelumab. This is acceptable 
for an antibody that specifically targets pKal. 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 22/114 
  
  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic/TK profiles of lanadelumab were evaluated following single- and repeat-dose SC 
administration in rats (4 weeks) and cynomolgus monkeys (4 weeks and 6 months). The PK/TK profile 
of lanadelumab was also evaluated in a 4-week IV infusion study in cynomolgus monkeys. Anti-drug antibody 
(ADA) response was measured in rats and cynomolgus monkeys and milk transfer was measured in the 
enhanced pre- and postnatal development (ePPND) study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. Lanadelumab 
exposure was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, solid phase extraction with acid 
dissociate and direct electro-chemiluminescent assays. These assays were designed to measure lanadelumab in 
rat and cynomolgus monkey plasma, and to measure antibodies to lanadelumab in rat and cynomolgus 
monkey plasma. 
Methods of analysis 
The used analytical methods appear to have been adequately characterized or validated and are considered 
suitable for determination of lanadelumab PK parameters, and anti-drug antibody levels where applicable.  
Absorption 
Pharmacokinetics of lanadelumab was evaluated in the rat following SC administration and in cynomolgus 
monkey following IV and SC administration. Lanadelumab exhibited typical PK behavior as expected from an 
IgG1 molecule: low clearance, low volume of distribution, and long half-lives in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, 
with SC bioavailability at approximately 66% in cynomolgus monkeys. In rats, lanadelumab was highly 
immunogenic, which resulted in the loss of exposure following repeated administration, limiting the utility of 
using rats for further toxicology studies, while immunogenicity was generally low in cynomolgus monkeys with 
both SC and IV routes of administration. The selection of the cynomolgus monkey as a single species for the 
pivotal 6-month toxicity study is endorsed. 
Distribution 
The estimated volume of distribution of lanadelumab was low, similar to plasma volume, which is consistent with 
the limited tissue distribution expected for an IgG mAb. Lanadelumab exhibited low (0.20%) milk transfer in 
cynomolgus monkeys. 
Metabolism 
No dedicated metabolism studies were performed and this is considered acceptable and in agreement with ICH 
S6(R1). The metabolic pathways of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals are generally understood and 
include degradation to small peptides and individual amino acids. 
Excretion 
As a monoclonal antibody, no urinary excretion is anticipated due to its molecular size. Therefore, no specific 
studies to measure excretion of lanadelumab were performed.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicity profile of lanadelumab has been evaluated in a toxicology program consistent with ICH S6. The 
pivotal toxicology studies were conducted in compliance with GLP regulations and standards. Rat and 
cynomolgus monkey were used as toxicology species based on in vitro pharmacology potency studies which 
indicated that pKal inhibition in rat and monkey was similar to human pKal inhibition. 
The toxicology studies were performed with SC injection. Studies up to 4 weeks duration (with 4-week recovery) 
and 6 months were performed in rats and monkey respectively. Due to high anti-drug antibody (ADA) response 
in rats that reduced drug exposure, and combined with the apparent similarity in toxicity profile in rats and 
cynomolgus monkey, the cynomolgus monkey was selected as the single species for the pivotal 6-month toxicity 
study. In addition, a 4-week IV infusion study with 4 weeks of recovery was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Standard safety pharmacology endpoints were incorporated into the repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats 
(CNS) and cynomolgus monkeys (CV and respiratory). No genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies have been 
performed. The routine battery of genotoxicity studies is not generally applicable to biotechnology derived 
products and a weight of evidence approach indicated low carcinogenic potential of lanadelubmab. The 
reproductive and developmental toxicity of lanadelubmab was evaluated in a ePPND study in monkey.  
The toxicokinetics of lanadelumab has been characterized across all of the preclinical safety studies including the 
reproductive and developmental toxicity studies. The toxicokinetic profile of lanadelumab display low clearance 
and a long half-life which is expected for a IgG1 molecules. Across all repeat-dose toxicology studies, 
lanadelumab exposure was similar in male and female animals with the exception of the 4-week study in rats 
where a majority of animals were confirmed positive for ADAs.  
Single-dose toxicity 
Lanadelumab was well tolerated in rats and monkeys in single doses up to 50mg/kg SC in both species and 
50mg/kg IV in monkey. An increase in APTT (up to 25%) was noted in both species. This can be considered a 
pharmacological effect of lanadelumab, which inhibits kallikrein, and is not considered adverse in the context of 
the single dose toxicology studies. 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
3 repeat-dose toxicity studies in rat and monkey have been performed with lanadelumab. Based on significant 
ADA-formation in the 4-week toxicity study in rats, the species was not used in longer term studies. Thus, the 
6-month study in Cynomolgus monkey is the only longer term repeated-dose study in the program. 
Rat 
Mortalities 
In the 4-week repeat-dose study in rats with exposure groups receiving lanadelumab doses 5, 25 or 50 
mg/kg/week, one control group male was found dead on study day 22. One control group female and 1 female 
from the 5 mg/kg group died on study days 22 and 29, respectively. These deaths are considered unrelated to 
treatment with lanadelumab.

Additional findings 
In the 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study in rats, there were reductions in body weight (2-6% which persisted 
after recovery (5-10%). However, the small magnitude of change is not considered a relevant effect, and was in 
fermales correlated with reductions in food intake. The increase in liver weight (8-10%), increase in liver 
enzymes (ALP (50%), AST (10%) and ALT (40%)) and the Kupffer cell hypertrophy in the lanadelumab treated 
groups are correlated and suggest a liver effect related to lanadelumab. Kupffer cell hypertrophy is seldom a 
spontaneous finding. It is often associated with test articles (or their carriers) wherein their physicochemical 
characteristics result in clearance from circulation by the Kupffer cells. However, there is no microscopic 
evidence of hepatocyte involvement. Because of the lack of microscopic evidence of hepatocyte injury and the 
recovery of the finding the issue is not further pursued. 
An increase in APTT was noted in all lanadelumab treated animals (6-15% in both sexes). However, this finding, 
which was noted also in the single–dose studies, was not correlated with abnormal bleeding patterns. It can be 
considered an indirect pharmacological effect of lanadelumab because reduced kallikrein activity limits intrinsic 
coagulation pathway. An effect of lanadelumab on APTT was not noted in the repeat-dose studies in monkey.   
Repeated SC administration in the rat resulted in a substantial decrease in exposure to lanadelumab in most 
animals at 25 and 50 mg/kg and some of the animals at 5 mg/kg. Indeed, 17/18 toxicokinetic animals were 
confirmed positive for positive for ADAs. Interestingly, ADAs were also noted in the control group but according 
to the Applicant there was no misdosing or contamination during collection or sample processing.  Nevertheless, 
it can be concluded that the ADA formation has hampered the interpretability of the study, and the NOAEL value 
is not considered reliable. Accordingly, there is no valid NOAEL value from the repeat-dose toxicity studies in the 
rat. 
Cynomolgus monkey 
Mortalities 
There were no mortalities in the monkey studies. 
Additional findings 
In the 4-week repeat-dose study in Cynomolgus monkey with exposure groups receiving lanadelumab doses 5, 
25 or 50 mg/kg/week, transient serum chemistry and hematology effects were noted across groups without 
apparent systematicity. Enlarged ovaries and nodules were noted in the ovaries of treated females but not in 
controls. In addition, two females in the 50mg/kg/week dose group (one SD29 and one recovery) had cysts in 
the ovaries that were microscopically confirmed. However, ovarian cysts are commonly reported lesions in the 
cynomolgus macaque why the finding is not considered treatment related. 
Longer RR interval (~30%) was noted on day 28 for males which generally demonstrated an expected inverse 
relationship to the potentially test article-related reduction in heart rate (~20% 22 hours post-dose). 
Considering the lack of concomitant changes in other cardiovascular parameters and clinical observations the 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 25/114 
  
  
 
 
changes are not consideredof relevance. In addition, no safety issues related to changes in heart rate and longer 
RR interval have been reported in the clinical studies.  
The 27 lanadelumab doses administered in the 6-month study in juvenile to adolescent cynomolgus monkeys 
(2.7-3.3 years) receiving lanadelumab doses 5, 25 or 50 mg/kg/week were well-tolerated. The only noteworthy 
finding in the study was mononuclear cell infiltrates that were noted at the injection site but also across various 
organs. While the infiltration was associated with degeneration at the injection site, the similarity in response 
across dose groups (including controls) suggests that the finding is procedure related. In addition, mononuclear 
(inflammatory) cell infiltration in various organs, including liver, kidneys, heart and lungs is a common 
histopathology finding in Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
No genotoxicity studies have been performed for lanadelumab in accordance with ICHS6. This is considered 
acceptable. The Applicant provided  information for carcinogenicity risk assessment that takes into consideration 
the pharmacology, mechanism of action, scientific literature, data from chronic toxicity studies, and clinical 
experiences with lanadelumab as well as Kalbitor® (ecallantide). Based on the pharmacology and mechanism of 
action of lanadelumab, there is no concern for a pharmacologic or pathway-associated carcinogenicity risk. In a 
2-year rat carcinogenicity study conducted with Kalbitor (ecallantide), a recombinant 60-amino acid peptide 
inhibitor of pKal, there were no test article-related neoplastic findings. Furthermore, no neoplastic or 
pre-neoplastic lesions or signs of immune suppression were observed in cynomolgus monkeys following 6 
months of weekly dosing of lanadelumab. Based on this, it is acceptable to assume that the carcinogenicity risk 
of lanadelumab would be low. Thus, no further studies are considered necessary.

Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
13-week repeat-dose fertility study 
13-weeks of lanadelumab treatment at 10 or 50 mg/kg/week in cynomolgus monkey did not show adverse 
effects on fertility parameters in doses up to 50mg/kg/week. 5/6 ADA-positive animals showed comparable TK 
profiles to their group means. ADA-positive monkey at 10 mg/kg showed significantly lower systemic exposure. 
However, effects on the menstrual cycle (prolongation or arrest) were observed in 2/5 high-dosed females. The 
applicant was therefore requested to discuss the clinical relevance of these findings taking into account a 
potential pharmacology-driven effect of lanadelumab on female reproductive physiology. In the response, the 
Applicant indicated that menstrual cycle disruptions or stopping of menstruation can occur in some laboratory 
female Cynomolgus monkeys at the start of dosing. Historical control data were also provided to further support 
this statement. It is also noted that there was no histopathological finding associated with lanadelumab 
administration in the ovaries or uterus at any dose level in the 13-week fertility study, and there have been no 
reports of irregular menstruation in the clinical studies with lanadelumab. Thus, the overall data suggest that the 
effects (prolongation or arrest) on the menstrual cycle noted in 2 high dose animals may well be due to normal 
menstrual cycle irregularity rather than driven by lanadelumab treatment. 
Enhanced pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study 
In an enhanced pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study with lanadelumab at 10 or 50 mg/kg/week in 
Cynomolgus Monkeys, two maternal control animals and one maternal animal administered 10 mg/kg/dose 
were sacrificed in a moribund condition due to birth difficulties on GD 139, 169, and 160, respectively. The 
infants were stillborn. In addition, a number of additional infants were stillborn or sacrificed due to trauma or 
failure to thrive. However, the mortalities are not considered attributed to administration of lanadelumab. 
Overall there were no lanadelumab-related difference in gestation length; prenatal loss (abortions and 
stillbirths); deaths; maternal or infant clinical observations, body weights, body weight change, or clinical 
pathology results; infant grip strength or external, morphological, neurobehavioral observations; infant skeletal 
development or organ weight differences. Mean plasma to milk ratio indicates a 0.20% milk transfer of 
lanadelumab from plasma post-partum.  
However, while there is a 0.2% milk transfer of lanadelumab from plasma post-partum, it is unknown whether 
lanadelumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs are known to be excreted in breast milk during the first few 
days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon afterwards; consequently, a risk to the 
breast-fed infant cannot be excluded during this short period. Afterwards, lanadelumab could be used during 
breast-feeding if clinically needed. This information has been included in section 4.6 of the SmPC.  
Other studies 
Tissue Cross-Reactivity of Lanadelumab with Human Tissues in Vitro  
In a tissue cross-reactivity study with lanadelumab with human tissues in vitro, specific lanadelumab staining 
was observed in multiple human tissues and consisted primarily of minimal to mild intensity cytoplasmic staining 
in endothelial cells and select nervous tissues in a variety of organs. However, tissue binding per se does not 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 27/114 
  
  
indicate biological activity in vivo. In addition, it is not likely that the cytoplasm is accessible to the antibody in 
vivo why the relevance of the endothelial cell binding is uncertain. 
To conclude, the toxicity profile of lanadelumab has been characterised in rat and Cynomolgus monkey in 
studies up to 6 months duration. The doses chosen are considered appropriate to characterise the toxicity of 
lanadelumab. Non-adverse toxicity findings in the SC studies include a treatment related but transient effect of 
heart rate and RR in monkey. While not observed in the clinical studies performed within this application, these 
are effects that may need further consideration. Infusion related effects were significant in animals across all 
dose groups in both species. However, this procedure related effect can be managed in the clinical situation. 
ADA development was prominent in the rat study, but less so in the cynomolgus monkey studies. While ADAs 
have been identified also in the clinical program, the data on ADA in animals are not reflective of the clinical 
situation. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The drug product is composed of naturally occurring amino acids, the use of which will not alter the 
concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore lanadelumab is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In repeat-dose studies evaluating once weekly SC injection in both rats (up to 28 days) and cynomolgus 
monkeys (up to 6 months) lanadelumab was well-tolerated at doses of up to and including 50 mg/kg (highest 
dose tested) with no organs of toxicity identified. Exposures in cynomolgus monkeys following 6 months of 
administration were approximately 23 fold greater than that noted at 300 mg q2 wks based on AUC. 
Lanadelumab is not expected to interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal material, as it is made up 
entirely of naturally occurring amino acids and contains no inorganic or synthetic linkers or other nonprotein 
portions; therefore no genotoxicity evaluation has been conducted. 
Carcinogenicity has not been evaluated in animals as based on the weight of evidence approach, lanadelumab 
is considered to have a low risk for carcinogenicity.  
The effects of lanadelumab on fertility were evaluated in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys. In a 13 week 
study, once weekly SC administration of lanadelumab had no effects on male or female fertility at doses of 10 or 
50 mg/kg (highest dose tested). Exposures in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys in the fertility study were 
approximately 21 fold greater than that noted at 300 mg q2 wks based on Cmax and AUC, respectively.  
In the ePPND study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys administered once weekly doses of 10 or 50 mg/kg 
(highest dose tested), there were no lanadelumab-related effects on pregnancy and parturition, embryo foetal 
development, survival, growth, and/or postnatal development of offspring. Exposures in the ePPND study were 
approximately 32 fold greater than that noted at 300 mg q2 wks based on AUC.   
2.3.7.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans. There are no objections to approval of lanadelumab from 
a non-clinical perspective.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic data for lanadelumab are available from four clinical studies; a Phase 1a, single ascending dose 
study in healthy volunteers, a Phase 1b multiple ascending dose in HAE patients, the pivotal placebo-controlled 
Phase 3 study (6 months of treatment) and a supportive, open-label Phase 3 extension study.

Page 29/114 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Methods 
Rich pharmacokinetic sampling for lanadelumab concentrations was performed in the Phase 1 study in healthy 
volunteers (DX-2930-01), and the data was analysed using non-compartmental methods. Sparse 
pharmacokinetic sampling was performed in the three studies in HAE patients (Phase 1b study DX-2930-02, and 
Phase 3 studies DX-2930-03 and DX-293004) and the data was primarily analysed by population PK modelling.  
Two different ELISA assays for determining lanadelumab concentrations in plasma have been used during the 
clinical development of lanadelumab, one was used to analyse samples from the study in healthy volunteers and 
one for the samples from the studies in HAE patients. Both methods were adequately validated and showed 
acceptable performance during analysis of study samples.  
The ADA analysis strategy included an initial screening step, followed by confirmation, titer determination, and 
evaluation of neutralizing activity for all positive samples. The screening, confirmatory, and titration methods 
employ an antibody-bridging design which is expected to detect all isotypes of anti-lanadelumab antibody. 
Absorption  
After subcutaneous (SC) administration, lanadelumab is slowly absorbed with a Tmax of 6-7 days. Absolute 
bioavailability after SC administration has not been determined. Preferred injection site (arm, thigh or 
abdomen) or self-administration vs. administration by health care professionals had no relevant effect on 
bioavailability.  
Between Phase 1 and Phase 3 in the clinical development, there was a change in the contract manufacturer 
responsible for supplying drug substance and drug product. The drug product used in Phase 3 was similar to the 
proposed commercial product. A comparability assessment made including Quality and Non-clinical data, and 
the products were considered comparable. 
Distribution 
Volume of distribution cannot be determined as F is not known. Lanadelumab is likely not largely distributed 
outside the vascular space. In the population PK model, the typical value for Vc/F was 12.8 L, and body weight 
was a significant covariate for Vc/F.  
Elimination 
No studies have been performed to characterise the elimination mechanisms of lanadelumab. Lanadelumab 
metabolism and elimination are expected to follow the normal immunoglobulin clearance pathways, resulting in 
degradation to small peptides and amino acids. 
After administration of single-dose of 0.1 – 3.0 mg/kg to healthy volunteers, the mean elimination half-life of 
lanadelumab was 17 to 21 days with no apparent dose dependency. In the final population PK model, including 
data from all four clinical studies, the typical steady state elimination half-life of lanadelumab was 15 days and 
the population estimates of typical CL/F was 25 ml/h. The estimated half-life is consistent with that observed for 
other monoclonal antibodies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 30/114 
  
  
Linearity 
There was no obvious non-linearity in lanadelumab pharmacokinetics after single dose administration of doses 
of 0.1 – 3.0 mg/kg, or after two repeated, flat doses of 30 – 400 mg. There was no apparent change in 
pharmacokinetics over time at repeated administration of 150 mg q4wks, 300 mg q4wks or 300 mg q2wks.  
Special populations 
There are no specific studies in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment, which is acceptable for an antibody, 
as renal or hepatic impairment are not expected to relevantly alter antibody exposure.  
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis, weight was shown to be a significant covariate for lanadelumab CL/F 
and Vc/F. Low-weight and high-weight patients are predicted to have a higher and lower exposure, respectively, 
than the average 70 kg patient.  
Due to a generally lower body weight, adolescents are by population pharmacokinetic analysis predicted to have 
a somewhat higher (on average <40% higher) exposure than the average adult patient. The observed mean 
AUC tau,ss values for adults and adolescents (N=21) were 460 and 629 μg*h/ml, respectively, confirming an 
about 37% difference. The model-predicted AUC range in the study population, based on a weight range of 178 
kg to 37 kg, is about 200-900 µg*d/ml. The observed AUC range was 121-832 ug*d/ml in adults and 
321-1050 ug*d/ml in adolescents. The maximum individual AUC in adolescents was, thus, approx. 30% larger 
than the maximum individual AUC in adults 
After correcting for body weight, age or gender had no apparent effect on lanadelumab exposure. Data are too 
limited to draw conclusions on the effect of race on lanadelumab pharmacokinetics.  
Interactions 
There is no specific pharmacokinetic in vitro or in vivo interaction data for lanadelumab. Pharmacokinetic 
interactions are not expected for an antibody without cytokine effects.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Introduction 
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of 
oedema predominately affecting the skin, digestive tract, and upper airway. The pathophysiological background 
to HAE is either a deficiency (HAE 1) or a dysfunction (HAE2) of C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), leading to 
dysregulation of plasma kallikrein activity. A third entity, “HAE with normal C1-INH”, formerly called HAE 3, has 
been identified. This group is believed to be heterogeneous and at least three different gene mutations leading 
to HAE with normal C1-INH have been identified.   
Lanadelumab is a monoclonal antibody designed to inhibit active plasma kallikrein proteolytic activity which in 
turn prevents the release of bradykinin from high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK), thereby preventing the 
vascular leak and swelling during an angioedema attack that is initiated when bradykinin binds to the B2 
receptor. 
Available and authorized drugs target the same pathway, including the same target for ecallantide, used in the 
acute treatment of HAE attacks in US. Of note, the overall B/R of ecallantide was considered negative by the 
CHMP in 2011. 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 31/114 
  
  
Mechanism of action 
Lanadelumab is a recombinant, fully human immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 kappa light chain monoclonal antibody 
that inhibits plasma kallikrein (pKal) proteolytic activity without binding prekallikrein, the inactive precursor 
found in the circulation. Increased pKal activity leads to angioedema attacks in patients with hereditary 
angioedema (HAE) through the proteolysis of high-molecular-weight-kininogen (HMWK) to generate cleaved 
HMWK (cHMWK) and bradykinin, a potent vasodilator that increases vascular permeability resulting in swelling 
and pain associated with HAE. It has been demonstrated that patients with HAE due to C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) 
deficiency or dysfunction have increased pKal activity, as indirectly measured by amount of cHMWK, both during 
and in between HAE attacks. 
Primary pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamic effect was assessed by two assays; a plasma kallikrein activity assay and a Western blot 
assay measuring the cleavage of HMWK. 
DX-2930-01 was a first-in-human, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1a, single-ascending dose study 
evaluating a single dose of lanadelumab (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg) in 32 healthy adult subjects. 
There was a dose-dependent inhibition of plasma kallikrein activity by lanadelumab 1 mg/kg (approx. 19% 
inhibition from baseline and 3 mg/kg (approx. 36%) but not by 0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg in healthy subjects. 
Furthermore, the highest dosing of lanadelumab, 3.0 mg/kg, reduced the levels of cleaved high molecular 
weight kininogen (cHMWK) from (mean [SD]) 53.9 [10.7] to 28.1 [7.4] at Day 5 (p=0.001). 
DX-2930-02 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b multiple-ascending dose study evaluating 2 
injections of lanadelumab (30, 100, 300 or 400 mg) separated by 2 weeks in 37 adult subjects with HAE.  
Lanadelumab 100, 300 and 400 mg induced a dose-dependent plasma kallikrein inhibition of approx. 30%, 
60%, and 70%, respectively. No effect compared to placebo was seen with 30 mg lanadelumab. Following the 
second dose of lanadelumab, the 300 and 400 mg dose groups demonstrate levels of plasma kallikrein inhibition 
comparable to that observed following the ex vivo plasma addition of 80 nM ecallantide, a plasma kallikrein 
inhibitor approved in the US for treatment of acute angioedema attacks due to HAE.  
Pre-dose plasma obtained from the HAE subjects contained approximately 52% cHMWK in contrast to 
approximately 8% in subjects without HAE in study DX-2930-01 contained cHMWK. Lanadelumab 300 and 400 
mg reduced cHMWK levels on Day 8 and 22 with a maximum reduction at Day 22.  In these dose groups, the 
level of cHMWK approached that observed in healthy subjects (8.3%). No significant effect of lanadelumab on 
cHMWK was seen later in this study; however, only two doses of lanadelumab, Day 0 and Day 14, were given.

Figure 1 Pharmacodynamic Effect of DX-2930 (lanadelumab) in HAE Subjects Based on Fluorogenic 
Assay—PD Population, Study DX-2930-02 
No dose between 100 and 300 mg has been studied whereas 3.0 mg/kg shows a significant response.  
DX-2930-03 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study evaluating 3 dose regimens (150 mg every 4 
weeks [q4wks], 300 mg q4wks, 300 mg q2wks) in subjects aged 12 years and older with HAE. 125 subjects 
received at least 1 dose of study treatment. 
Only descriptive data are provided (Figure 2). Numerically, levels of cHMWK are reduced in all lanadelumab 
treatment arms compared to placebo.

DX-2930-03) 
DX-2930-04 is an ongoing open-label extension study evaluating repeated 300 mg doses for up to 132 weeks in 
subjects aged 12 years and older with HAE who either previously received lanadelumab in Study DX-2930-03 
(rollover subjects) or were previously untreated (non-rollover subjects).

The results in rollover subjects treated with placebo in study DX-2930-03 and non-rollover subjects were 
comparable to the results in DX-2930-03. In rollover subjects treated with lanadelumab in study DX-2930-03, 
the cHMWK reduction was similar day 0 and day 192. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
The potential of lanadelumab to inhibit other serine proteases were tested. No inhibition was detected in any of 
the 20 serine proteases tested, including Factor IXa which is the most similar to plasma kallikrein. 
Effect of antidrug antibody or neutralizing antibody on pharmacodynamics 
For the neutralizing anti-lanadelumab antibody (NAb) assay, the applicant computed a cut-point with only 0.1% 
false positive (Table 2) allowed instead of the usual 1% rejection threshold. The use of this tighter false-positive 
coefficient increases the rate of false-negative results and is not recommended. A report with data using a cut 
point of 1 % was provided on request. This resulted in 3 new subjects with the presence of neutralizing ADAs 
over the rejection threshold giving a total of 10 subjects (4,5%) over the two Phase III studies as compared with 
7 subjects (3,2%) using the 0.1% cut-off (Table 3).

Table 3 Summary of Immunogenicity Response Using 1% False-Positive Cut Point For Neutralizing ADA Antibody 
Assay - Lanadelumab-treated Population
There was no apparent impact on the efficacy, pharmacokinetic, or pharmacodynamic profile of lanadelumab 
due to the presence of antibodies classified as neutralising with either cut-off. No subject discontinued treatment 
with lanadelumab or reported an AE indicative of a hypersensitivity reaction due to the presence of ADA 
classified as neutralising.  
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Efficacy 
Population PK/PD models were constructed to describe the relation between lanadelumab exposure and plasma 
kallikrein response (pKal) as well as high molecular weight kininogen (cHMWK). The latter model was used to 
predict the cHMWK time profiles at different dosing schedules and in patients of different weight (Figure 3).

Safety 
The relationship between lanadelumab exposure parameters and different safety parameters was also 
evaluated. No strong or significant correlations were observed between lanadelumab exposure and liver function 
tests, haematological parameters including aPTT, or cardiovascular parameters, respectively. There is therefore 
not apparent indication of a higher risk of systemic adverse events at a higher exposure.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic evaluation of a new active substance should aim at characterising the pharmacokinetic 
properties of the substance, in order to possibly support the proposed dose regimen and to predict situations 
and patient groups where exposure may be clinically significantly different from that in the pivotal 
efficacy/safety study population. Evaluation of exposure-response and/or exposure-toxicity relationships may 
aid estimation of what is a clinically relevant difference in exposure. Lanadelumab is an antibody, and some 
aspects of the pharmacokinetic behaviour can therefore be predicted without specific studies, such as 
elimination mechanisms and the potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions.  
Overall, the clinical pharmacology data package for lanadelumab, with plasma concentration data from one 
ascending single-dose study in healthy volunteers and three repeated-dose studies in HAE patients, and analysis 
primarily by population PK modelling, is considered relevant for an antibody. 
Plasma concentration data from study DX-2930-03 indicate that one patient in the placebo group was 
administered one dose of lanadelumab, with lanadelumab concentrations on day 56 in the same range as

patients receiving a 300 mg dose. According to the applicant this was due to an unintentional mix-up of study 
product and the patient was not included in the efficacy analysis. As there are no signs of systematic mis-dosing 
or mix-up, this single case is of no concern for the overall interpretation of the pharmacokinetic data.  
The ADA and Nab assays were clearly described and adequately validated. Long term stability testing is ongoing 
and will be reported post approval which was considered acceptable. The neutralizing antibody (Nab) assay is 
considered adequately validated. The Applicant originally computed a cut-point with only 0.1% false positive 
allowed instead of the usual 1% rejection threshold. In response to questions, the presence of neutralising 
anti-lanadelumab antibodies was re-calculated using a 1% false positive rate. This resulted in three additional 
subjects with the presence of neutralising ADAs over the rejection threshold giving a total of 10 subjects (4,5%) 
in the two Phase III studies as compared with 7 subjects (3,2%) using the 0.1% cut-off.  
The comparability between the Phase 1 and Phase 3 products and the Phase 3 and commercial products has 
been clarified and it is agreed by CHMP that the products can be considered comparable. Thus, no clinical 
comparability data is necessary.   
The estimated steady state half-life of 15 days supports the proposed q4w or q2w dosing. In line with linear 
pharmacokinetics, the AUC 0-2weeks at dosing with 300 mg q2w was similar to the AUC0-4weeks at dosing 300 mg 
q4w.   
No studies have been performed to characterise the elimination mechanisms of lanadelumab, which is 
acceptable. Also lack of dedicated pharmacokinetic studies in patients with renal or impairment and lack of in 
vitro data on protein binding and active transport is acceptable for an antibody. There is no pharmacokinetic 
concern for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, i.e. a concern for increased exposure. Whether patients 
with renal or hepatic impairment might be more susceptible to adverse events at normal exposure is discussed 
later in the report.  
Weight was a significant covariate for lanadelumab CL/F and Vc/F. The heaviest patient included in clinical 
studies weighed 178 kg and was predicted to have a lanadelumab AUC less than half of the AUC in a 70 kg 
patient, while the lightest patient, a 37 kg adult, was predicted to have a < 50% increase in AUC. Adolescents 
are predicted to have an on average < 40% higher exposure than the average adult patient. The chosen flat 
dose regimen may, thus, lead to a relatively high variability in exposure. Indeed, the individual observed AUC 
values in the study populations varied by almost 7-fold in adults and by more than 3-fold in adolescents. 
Variability in exposure of an active substance is not by itself a concern if the exposure range is within the 
therapeutic window from an efficacy safety as well as a safety point of view.  
The applicant made a subgroup analysis demonstrating overall adequate efficacy in patients > 100 kg. 
However, there were relatively few patients in this group, it included a wide body weight range and at the lowest 
tested dose (150 mg q4w), there was a possible trend towards lower efficacy in the highest weight group. Thus 
the applicant did no longer pursued the 150 mg q4w dose as a dosing alternative in the SmPC.  
The effect of weight appears not to be of concern for efficacy of the remaining alternatives, 300 mg q2w or 300 
mg q4w. Considering the safety profile and the PKPD data indicating no clear correlation between exposure and 
systemic adverse events, the higher mean AUC in adolescents as compared with the adult population might not 
be a concern for safety. Discussion on the posology is provided later in the efficacy section.  
The lack of evaluation of pharmacokinetic drug interaction potential is acceptable for an antibody. The 
disposition of lanadelumab is not expected to be dependent on metabolising enzymes or transport proteins. 
Direct effects of an antibody on metabolism or transport of other drugs are also not expected. Lanadelumab is

Page 37/114 
  
  
not reported to affect cytokine levels, and therefore secondary effects on cytokine inhibition of CYP activity are 
not anticipated.  
Pharmacodynamics 
In HAE type 1 and 2, plasma kallikrein activity is dysregulated due to the absence or dysfunction of C1-esterase 
inhibitor (C1-INH). 
Lanadelumab is a monoclonal antibody designed to inhibit active plasma kallikrein proteolytic activity. The dose 
dependent inhibition of plasma kallikrein activity by lanadelumab correlating with lanadelumab plasma 
concentrations seen in the two phase 1 studies DX-2930-01 (healthy subjects) and DX-2930-02 (HAE subjects) 
is therefore considered to indicate a drug effect on the intended target molecule.  
Loss of inhibition of plasma kallikrein activity leads to increased bradykinin release from high-molecular weight 
kininogen (HMWK) and thereby vascular leak mediated by bradykinin binding to the B2 receptor (B2-R) on the 
surface of endothelial cells. In both studies, there was a dose-dependent reduction of the cHMWK levels. The use 
of cHMWK as a marker for bradykinin levels is accepted and a putative role for lanadelumab in reducing HAE 
attacks is therefore considered supported.  
A clinical relevance of these results was supported by an ad hoc analysis in study DX-2930-02, which 
demonstrated an association between lanadelumab drug exposure and prevention of angioedema attacks as 
discussed in later in this report.  
In the proof of concept study DX-2930-02, no dose between 100 and 300 mg has been studied whereas 3.0 
mg/kg (the highest dose evaluated in study DX-2930-01) shows a significant response.  
3.0 mg /kg corresponds to 120 mg for an adolescent weighing about 40 kg and to 150 to 240 mg for an adult 
weighing 50 to 80 kg. The dosage of 150 mg should have been evaluated in the phase 2 study and, if relevant, 
as 150mg q2w in the phase 3 study; only 3 patients were < 50kg in the phase 3 study. 
The pharmacodynamic results from the two phase 3 studies are largely consistent with the results of the phase 
1 studies. In pivotal study DX-2930-03, only descriptive data are provided. Numerically, levels of cHMWK are 
reduced in all lanadelumab treatment arms compared to placebo. 
The overall incidence of ADA with lanadelumab treatment was 11.4% (25/220). A total of 7 (3.2%) subjects 
tested positive for low titre antibodies classified as neutralizing. 
There was no impact on pharmacodynamic profile of lanadelumab in any of the phase 3 studies due to the 
presence of antibodies classified as neutralizing. However, the low number of subjects should be remembered. 
In this context, it is of interest that lanadelumab induced neutralising ADA in up to 79% of exposed rodents in 
preclinical studies. The effect was dose-dependent.  
The PKPD model for cHMWK is considered acceptable for evaluation of the relationship between exposure and 
efficacy, while the other exposure-efficacy models have not been shown to perform adequately.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The Clinical Pharmacology data for lanadelumab are overall considered sufficient and have been adequately 
demonstrated.  
There was a clear effect of body weight on lanadelumab clearance. The proposed flat dosing regimen will lead to 
a relatively high variability in exposure, but the exposure range with the proposed dosing regimen, 300 mg q2w, 
might be expected to be within the therapeutic window for adolescents as well as for adults. The benefit of 
having a flat dosing regimen from a self-administration point of view is acknowledged.    
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 38/114 
  
  
However, in patients who are stably attack free, the possibility to reduce the dose regimen (e.g. 300mg Q4w) 
was considered beneficial by CHMP, especially for patients with low body weight (less than 50 kgs). This is based 
on the clinical efficacy data and is therefore introduced in the posology section of the SmPC.  
Plasma kallikrein activity and cHMWK levels were reduced by lanadelumab in a dose-dependent way. So far, no 
impact on pharmacodynamic profile by neutralising antidrug antibodies was seen. 
The SmPC adequately reflects the Clinical Pharmacology data. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The proposed indication of routine prophylaxis to prevent attacks and control the symptoms of HAE in patients 
12 years and older is based on the efficacy results from a single pivotal double-blind placebo controlled Phase 3 
study (Study DX-2930-03), supportive efficacy data, including durability of response, from the on-going 
open-label Phase 3 study (Study DX-2930-04), and the proof of concept from the Phase 1b multiple ascending 
dose trial (Study DX-2930-02).

Methods 
Study design 
The study design of study DX-2930-02 is summarised in Table 4 above.  
The range of lanadelumab dosing for the clinical development program was based upon estimation of the level 
of plasma kallikrein inhibition necessary to attain effective prophylaxis against HAE attacks. 
Ecallantide is a biologic plasma kallikrein inhibitor approved in the US to treat acute HAE attacks. The maximum 
plasma concentration (Cmax) obtained following ecallantide administration is approx 586 ng/mL or 83 nM. 
Conservative estimates of the amount of plasma kallikrein required to prevent an attack may equal that needed 
to treat an acute attack. Based on this, doses 0.1-3.0 mg/kg were used in the phase 1 first-in-human study in 
healthy subjects DX-2930-01. 
A conservative starting dose of 30 mg per dose was planned, with escalation to 100 and then 300 mg in a flexible 
dose-escalation scheme. Each cohort nominally consisting of 6 subjects randomised 2:1 to active drug and 
placebo. 
The flexible dose-escalation scheme allowed escalation to dose higher than 300 mg (up to a maximum of 400 
mg), if necessary, and if supported by the cumulative safety results. This resulted in the addition of 2 additional 
cohorts, in which subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive either placebo or 400 mg lanadelumab. 
Main eligibility criteria 
The main inclusion criteria were subjects ≥ 18 years of age with HAE type I or II. Subjects must also have been 
experiencing ≥ 2 HAE attacks per year, with at least 1 attack in the past 6 months. 
Efficacy Endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint: 
- Number of HAE attacks per week from Day 8 to Day 50  
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
- Number of HAE attacks per week from Day 1 to Day 50 
- Number of HAE attacks per week from Day 8 to Day 64 
- Number of HAE attacks per week from Day 8 to Day 92 
Results 
37 subjects were enrolled in the study; 13 placebo, 24 lanadelumab. 
The mean age was 39.9 years and ranged from 18 to 71 years. 62% of the subjects were female. All treated 
subjects were white. 
The baseline demographics in the treatment arms were acceptably balanced comparing placebo and total 
lanadelumab with the exception of gender (67% in the placebo group; 54% in the lanadelumab group). There 
was however poor balance between the different lanadelumab treatment arms in several parameters. The most 
prominent difference was seen in the number of HAE attacks which ranged from 7.0 attacks in the last 12 
months in the lanadelumab 30 mg arm to 35.2 in the lanadelumab 400 mg arm (placebo 22.7; total 
lanadelumab 22.1). The difficulties to get the treatment arms balanced due to low number of subjects in each 
arm (N=4-11) is acknowledged. 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 40/114 
  
  
The main objective of the study was to assess safety and tolerability. 
The pre-specified, primary efficacy analysis was based on subjects in the 300 mg, 400 mg, and placebo dose 
groups with a historical baseline attack rate of at least 2 attacks over the last 3 months prior to enrolment. The 
primary efficacy endpoint was met (Table 5).

a Number of subjects included in analysis. Only subjects who had a baseline attack rate of at least 2 attacks in the last 3 months prior to enrolment are included. 
b Baseline is defined as historical HAE attacks over the last 3 months from Day 1 prior to dosing. 
c Weighted statistics, unadjusted for baseline attack rate. 
d The result is based on GEE analysis of repeated counts per week during the observation period (Days 8 to 50). Baseline HAE attack rate per week is a 
covariate, treatment group is a fixed effect, and subject is a random effect in the GEE model with independence working correlation structure. The observed 
rate of HAE occurrence was 0% for the 300 mg treatment group and thus, an arbitrarily small value (0.000001) was imputed for the HAE occurrence variable 
for a random 300 mg subject at Week 2 to enable the GEE analyses to converge. 
Secondary end points:  
The secondary efficacy endpoints were met. From Day 1 to Day 50, Day 8 to Day 64, and Day 8 to Day 92, a 
100% reduction versus placebo in the HAE attack rate (adjusted for the baseline attack rate) was observed for 
the 300 mg cohort (p<0.0001) during all 3 time periods and an 82% to 85% reduction versus placebo was 
observed for the 400 mg cohort during these 3 time periods (p= 0.0141, p<0.0001 and p<0.0001, 
respectively). 
The beneficial effect of lanadelumab in prevention of HAE-attacks was further supported by a post hoc analysis 
comparing mean lanadelumab concentration with incidence of HAE attacks indicating a correlation between 
lanadelumab exposure and the number of attacks (Table 6).

In study DX-2930-02, efficacy was shown with two doses, given 14 days apart, of lanadelumab of 300 mg and 
400 mg. In order to evaluate if lower drug levels could be effective in preventing HAE attacks, three different 
dosing regimens (150 mg q4w, 300 mg q4w, 300 mg q2w), were used in this study. 
Subjects were stratified by baseline attack rates (1 to <2 attacks per 4 weeks, 2 to <3 attacks per 4 weeks, and 
≥3 attacks per 4 weeks) and randomised into 1 of 4 parallel treatment arms in a 3:2:2:2 ratio (placebo, 
lanadelumab 150 mg every 4 weeks [q4wks], lanadelumab 300 mg q4wks, or lanadelumab 300 mg q2wks by SC 
injection).  
Study Participants  
Main eligibility criteria 
The main inclusion criteria were subjects ≥ 12 years of age with HAE type I or II and a baseline rate of at least 
1 investigator-confirmed HAE attack per 4 weeks as confirmed during the run-in period. 
Main exclusion criteria were  
•  Concomitant diagnosis of another form of chronic, recurrent angioedema, such as acquired angioedema 
(AAE), HAE with normal C1-INH (also known as HAE Type III), idiopathic angioedema, or recurrent 
angioedema associated with urticaria. 
• 
• 
Exposure to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or any oestrogen-containing medications 
with systemic absorption (such as oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy) within 4 weeks 
prior to screening. 
Exposure to androgens within 2 weeks prior to entering the run-in period. 
•  Use of long-term prophylactic therapy for HAE within 2 weeks prior to entering the run-in period. 
•  Use of short-term prophylaxis for HAE within 7 days prior to entering the run-in period. 
•  Any of the following liver function test abnormalities: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >3x upper limit of 
normal, or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >3x upper limit of normal, or total bilirubin >2x upper 
limit of normal (unless the bilirubin elevation is a result of Gilbert’s syndrome).

Treatments 
This was a placebo-controlled study. Subjects were randomized to receive any one of the following dosing 
regimens by subcutaneous (SC) injection during 26 weeks: 
o 
o 
o 
lanadelumab 150 mg every 4 weeks (q4wks), 
lanadelumab 300 mg q4wks, 
lanadelumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2wks), or 
o  placebo q2wks. 
Lanadelumab  is  provided  at  a  nominal  concentration  of  150  mg/ml  solution.  Placebo  SC  is  administered  to 
subjects randomized to the placebo arm and in between doses of lanadelumab for subjects randomized to the 
300 mg or 150 mg q4wks treatment arms. 
In order to maintain the blind, regardless of treatment assignment, all subjects were to receive 2 SC injections 
of blinded investigational or reference product administered in the same upper arm with at least 2 cm separation 
between each injection site every 2 weeks.  
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
To evaluate the efficacy of lanadelumab in preventing HAE attacks 
Secondary objective: 
To evaluate the safety of repeated SC administrations of lanadelumab 
Tertiary objectives: 
o  To evaluate the PD effects of chronically administered lanadelumab 
o  To assess the immunogenicity of chronically administered lanadelumab 
o  To evaluate the PK of chronically administered lanadelumab 
o  To evaluate the effect of lanadelumab on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
•  Number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period (Day 0 through Day 182). 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints (rank ordered) 
•  Number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks requiring acute treatment during the treatment period 
(Day 0 through Day 182). 
•  Number of moderate or severe investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period (Day 0 
through Day 182). 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 44/114 
  
  
•  Number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks occurring on Day 14 after administration of study drug 
through Day 182. 
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
• 
Time to first HAE attack after Day 14, i.e., the duration that a subject is attack-free after Day 14. 
•  Number of high-morbidity investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the efficacy evaluation period; a 
high-morbidity HAE attack was defined as any attack that had at least one of the following 
characteristics: severe, resulted in hospitalization (except hospitalization for observation <24 hours), 
hemodynamically significant (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg, requires intravenous (IV) hydration, 
or associated with syncope or near-syncope) or laryngeal. 
Sample size 
Sample size calculation was based on simulations using unilateral testing at the 2.5%-level. 
Randomisation 
Randomization was performed using an Interactive Web-based Randomization System (IWRS). The trial used a 
double-bind approach. The applicant implemented procedures to help ensure double-blinding. There was a large 
difference in the number of HAE attacks between treatment groups, which may have been clinically perceivable 
by investigators. However, the primary endpoint collection relied on standardized guidelines, which may have 
helped limiting bias. Also, randomization was not stratified on centre, which somewhat reduces the possibility of 
deducing the treatment allocations. 
Blinding (masking) 
To maintain the blind to the q2wks treatment arm, subjects in the q4wks arms received placebo injection in 
between doses of lanadelumab. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy endpoint was compared for each active treatment group (lanadelumab) to the placebo 
group using a Poisson regression model. The results were adjusted for baseline attack rate by including the 
normalized baseline attack rate as a fixed effect in the model. The logarithm of time in days each subject was 
observed during the treatment period was used as an offset variable, and a Pearson chi-square scaling of 
standard errors was used to account for potential over-dispersion. The statistical methods for study DX-2930-03 
are generally considered acceptable.

Recruitment 
Date of study initiation: 03 March 2016 
Date of study completion: 13 April 2017 
Conduct of the study 
In total, 9.6% of the subjects discontinued the study; 14.6% in the placebo arm and 7.1% in the lanadelumab 
arms. There was no obvious dose dependency in the discontinuation rates between the lanadelumab treatments 
arms; however, the absolute number of subjects discontinuing the study was very low (N=1-3) in the 
lanadelumab arms. The most common reason for discontinuation in both the placebo and lanadelumab arms was 
Consent withdrawn (placebo N=3; lanadelumab N=4) followed by Adverse event (placebo N=2; lanadelumab 
N=1) 
One subject in the placebo group  had measureable concentrations of lanadelumab in the same range as 
patients receiving a 300 mg dose. The Applicant considered that could either be due to contamination of the 
patients PK sample with lanadelumab or an inadvertent administration of lanadelumab to this subject, but 
neither theory could be proven in the investigation. No other misdosing was reported.  
Other reported protocol violations are not considered to have affected the integrity of the study.

Baseline data 
Table 7 Demography (ITT Population) 
Subjects were included from 41 clinical sites in 6 countries: United States (N=86), Germany (N=18), Canada 
(N=7), Italy (N=6), United Kingdom (N=5) and Jordan (N=3). 29 subjects (23.2%) were included in Europe and 
86 subjects (68.8%) in the US. 
The proportion of male subjects was 17.1% in the placebo arm vs 35.7% in the lanadelumab arms, ranging from 
28.6% in the 150 mg q4wks arm to 44.4% in the 300 mg q2wks arm. Randomization was stratified by the 
baseline attack rate observed during the run-in period but not by gender. The imbalance in gender between the 
treatment arms therefore indicates that there was no major correlation between gender and attack frequency; 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 47/114 
  
  
 
however, there are publications indicating a more severe disease in women. This is further discussed below, as 
gender was one of the predefined subgroup analyses included in the statistical analysis plan for the primary 
endpoint.  
The proportion of black/African American subjects was higher in the lanadelumab 300 mg q4wks arm than in the 
other treatment arms including placebo (20.7% vs 3.6-4.9%). 
In total, 10 subjects <18 years (range 12-17 years) were included in the study; 6 in the lanadelumab arms and 
4 in the placebo arm. Overweight or obese patients represented approximately 2/3 of the included patients.

In spite of stratification by the baseline attack rate observed during the run-in period, the rate of HAE attacks 
during run-in was not fully balanced and the standard deviations [SD] were large. This could be due to the 
highest stratum being indefinitely large (≥3 attacks/4 weeks). Nevertheless, the imbalance may have impact on 
the robustness of the data. The issue is further discussed below.  
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the number of investigator confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment

The primary endpoint of the study was met, as the number of investigator confirmed HAE attacks during the 
treatment period was reduced in all lanadelumab treatment arms compared to placebo. The relative risk 
reduction ranged from 73% in the 300 mg q4wks to 87% in the 300 mg q2wks compared to placebo, 
corresponding to a mean decrease of approximately 1.5 attack/4 weeks in the 150 mg q4wks and 300 mg q4wks 
arms and 1.75 attacks/4 weeks in the 300 mg q2wks treatment arm.  
For Age <18 years, the reduction in mean HAE attack rate was (0.30 [SD=0.263] and 0.31 [0.433]) in 300 mg 
q4wks and 300 mg q2wks compared to placebo (0.92 [0.992]). 
As discussed above, the run-in HAE attack rate was not fully balanced between treatment arms.  The primary 
efficacy analysis was a Poisson model, with in HAE attack rate during the baseline (run-in) period included as a 
covariate.  
Further CHMP request, the applicant has provided an overview on the effect of baseline attack rate on attack 
rate during the trial, including a subgroup analysis on HAE attack rate (primary endpoint) based on run-in period 
HAE attack rate. Data provided confirm that the treatment period attack rate was strongly influenced by the 
baseline attack rate (higher the run-in period attack rate, the higher the treatment period attack rate). In all 
subgroups, the decrease in HAE attack rate was larger in the lanadelumab treatment arms compared to placebo.

These changes were statistically significant at the 0.05 level, with the exception of 150 mg every 4 weeks in the 
subgroup Run-in HAE attack rate 1-<2 attacks/month (p=0.055). 
Furthermore, the applicant has provided data on the absolute change from baseline in each treatment arm for 
the primary and secondary endpoints. For all endpoints, the change from baseline was 38-40% in the placebo 
arm and 84-86%, 84-97% and 88-92% for lanadelumab 150 mg q4w, 300 mg q4w and 300 mg q2w, 
respectively. 
For the primary endpoint, pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed (Figure 7). 
Figure 7 Forest Plot of Rate Ratio on Number of Investigator-Confirmed HAE Attacks by Subject 
Subgroups-ITT Population 
Results from subgroup analyses were generally consistent with the results from the entire population with a few 
exceptions (Age <18 years, HAE type II, weight ≥100 mg [except in the 300 mg q4wks arm] and Other race 
than white). However, in all subgroups other than Other race than white treatment arm 150 mg q4wks, the point 
estimate favours lanadelumab treatment, though the confidence interval covers 1.  
For some subgroups, including Age <18 years, HAE type II and Other race than white, the number of subjects 
is low (N=10-12 in total for all lanadelumab dosing regimens and placebo).  It is acknowledged that the number 
of subjects in these subgroups may be too low to detect a difference between lanadelumab and placebo. In order 
to get a clearer view of potential differences between subgroups and the entire population, the Applicant was 
asked to present a Forest plot of rate ratio on number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks by each subgroup 
for the ITT population with pooled data from the three lanadelumab treatment arms compared to placebo. In 
Assessment report

this ad hoc pooled analysis, the point estimate favours lanadelumab treatment for all subject subgroups with an 
adequate number of subjects. The confidence interval does not cover 1 in any subgroup (Figure 8).

Subgroups 
Pharmacokinetic analyses suggest a lower exposure in subjects with higher body weight as discussed earlier. 
Moreover, in analysing the impact of baseline covariates on the time to first attack in study DX-2930-04, it was 
observed that at any given time subjects with BMI classified as overweight or obese have an increased 
probability of having an attack compared with normal BMI subjects. Using PK/PD data, the Applicant has clarified 
that the 300 mg q2wks dosing was associated with lanadelumab exposure approximate or above the IC90 of PD 
and EAUC90 for efficacy in patients across a large range of body weight (46.8-150 kg). The Applicant has also 
provided an ad hoc subgroup analysis based on baseline weight.

Table 9 Number of Investigator-Confirmed HAE Attack by Weight and Treatment Group in 
Treatment Period in Study DX-2930-03-ITT Population 
Effect on HAE attack rate of 300 mg q2w was shown in all weight subgroups, including subjects >100 kg. On the 
contrary, the dose regimen 150 mg q4w did not exert any effect on HAE attack rate in subjects >100 kg. It 
should be noted that due to the relatively small study, the number of subjects in each subgroup is low. However, 
the number of subjects in the >100 kg subgroup was comparable to the other weight subgroups. Moreover, it is 
noted that there were no treatment differences regarding gender, which is reassuring considering the 
imbalances in gender between the treatment arms discussed above. 
Study DX-2930-03 met its three secondary efficacy endpoints (Table 10).

Table 10 Primary and Rank Ordered Secondary Efficacy Endpoints-ITT Population 
In the exploratory analyses, the results from the primary and secondary endpoints were supported.  
The time to first attack after Day 0, Day 14, Day 28, and Day 70 was significantly longer for the lanadelumab 
treated subjects compared to the placebo treated subjects (unadjusted p<0.001 for all 3 lanadelumab 
treatment arms) regardless of the run-in-period HAE attack rate. 
The percentage reduction in the incidence of high morbidity investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the 
treatment period compared to placebo was statistically significant for all 3 lanadelumab treatment arms: 79.2% 
in 150 mg q4wks arm, 86.3% in 300 mg q4wks arm, and 84.7% in 300 mg q2wks arm. 
Overall, the number of subjects who had investigator-confirmed HAE attacks resulting in an emergency 
department visit or resulting in admission to the hospital was too low in each treatment arm for statistical 
comparison with placebo. 
The percentage reduction in the investigator-confirmed laryngeal HAE attack rate ranged from 59.5% to 81.6% 
in the lanadelumab treatment arms compared to placebo. The number of subjects who had 
investigator-confirmed laryngeal HAE attacks was too low in each treatment arm for a statistically significant 
comparison with placebo.

Note: For each subject, the percentage reduction was calculated as the run-in period attack rate minus the treatment period attack rate divided by the run-in 
period attack rate, multiplied by 100. The percentage reduction groups are not mutually exclusive, subjects may appear in more than one group as applicable 
based on their percentage reduction.

Subjects who experienced 3 or more investigator-confirmed attacks before the end of the 4 weeks run-in period 
were allowed to exit the run-in period early and proceed to enrolment and randomisation. The proportion of 
patients exiting the run-in period in advance was comparable across randomization arms (~40% randomized 
subjects in each arm) (Table 15).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
Data from the Phase 3 studies have not been pooled by the applicant due to differences in study designs (e.g., 
placebo-controlled  versus  open-label)  and  the  endpoints  analysed.  Efficacy  results  and  results  in 
sub-populations across Phase 3 studies have been compared by the applicant.  
Description of number of attack rates in rollover (from Study DX-2930-03) patients in study DX-2930-04 yielded 
mean attack rates that seemed smaller in study DX-2930-04, compared to study DX-2930-03, regardless of the 
DX-2930-03 randomization arm, whichever the endpoint (investigator confirmed attack, attack requiring acute 
treatment, moderate-to-severe attack, high morbidity attack): rollover patients from the placebo arm seemed 
to benefit from switching to active treatment. Mean rates in rollover patients initially from the 300 mg q4wks and 
150 mg q4wks arms seemed also lower in study DX-2930-04 (under dosage 300mg q2wks), but also in rollover 
patients initially from the 300 mg q2wks arm. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies in special population have been performed. 
Of note, 9 patients aged ≥65 years were included in the lanadelumab clinical studies. None of those were ≥85 
years old (Table 17).

Supportive study (DX-2930-04) 
Study title:  
An Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Long-Term Safety and Efficacy of DX-2930 for Prevention Against Acute 
Attacks of Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) (HELP Study ExtensionTM). 
Study design:  
Study DX-2930-04 was an open-label, long-term safety and efficacy extension study to DX-2930-03. Two types 
of subjects were enrolled into this study: rollovers from Study DX-2930-03 and non-rollovers (i.e., were not 
participants in Study DX-2930-03) . The treatment period was extended to 30 months in Amendment 3. A 
description of the final study design after Amendment 3 is provided.

Figure 10 Description of Study Periods 
The study is ongoing. An interim analysis covering the first 6 months of the study is included in the MAA (data 
cut-off date 01 Sep 2017). Therefore, when Study DX-2930-03 and Study DX-2930-04 experiences are 
combined, the study will provide data covering at least 1 year of exposure for subjects who were previously 
randomized to the lanadelumab 300 mg q2wks study arm in StudyDX-2930-03.  
The selected dosing regimen was based on the results of study DX-2930-03. In order to further evaluate the 
dosing frequency, rollover subjects from study DX-2930-03 did not have the second dose in study DX-2930-04 
until after the first HAE attack (“dose-and-wait”). 
As opposed to study DX-2930-03, self-administration was allowed after the second dose and after training. 
Study Participants  
The main inclusion criteria were identical to those of study DX-2930-03, with exception for baseline HAE history. 
In the pivotal study, at least 1 investigator-confirmed HAE attack per 4 weeks as confirmed during the run-in 
period was required whereas in the extension study, 1 investigator-confirmed HAE attack per 12 weeks was 
sufficient for eligibility. 
Outcome/endpoints 
The long-term safety of lanadelumab was the primary endpoint in the study. All efficacy endpoints are 
secondary.

Results  
Study population 
In total, 212 subjects enrolled in the study; 109 from study DX-2930-03 and 103 non-rollovers (whereof 19 
subjects from study DX-2930-02).  
92.9% of the subjects were active study participants at data lock point for the interim report. 2 subjects had 
completed the study before extension of the study duration to 30 months. The most common reasons for 
discontinuing treatment were adverse events and subject withdrawal (each 2.4%).  
92% of the subjects had completed 6 months. At the time of the interim analysis, 70 lanadelumab rollover 
subjects and 5 non-rollover subjects were exposed to lanadelumab for at least 12 months, although the regular 
dosing period for rollover of subjects on DX-2930-04 was less than 6 months due to the dose-and-wait period.  
It is noted that one non-rollover subject previously treated with C1-INH discontinued study drug due to lack of 
efficacy. This subject was negative for neutralising antibodies.  
Treated subjects ranged from 12 to 76 years of age, including 21 paediatric subjects (9.9% of subjects) aged 12 
to <18 years. Overall median age was 42.8 years.  
Enrolled subjects were predominantly female (67.5%). Most subjects were White (93.4%). 
The number of historical HAE attacks was lower among the non-rollover than the rollover subjects. This could be 
explained by the difference in inclusion criteria as described above. Other minor demographic differences 
between the rollover and non-rollover subjects are not considered relevant for the study results. 
Outcomes and estimation  
There were no primary efficacy endpoints in the study. All results in study DX-2930-04 are preliminary as the 
study is still ongoing. 
The time to first investigator-confirmed HAE attack in rollover subjects is summarised .

Table 18 Estimated Percentage of Subjects with First HAE Attack at Different Weeks
At 2 weeks, 78.8% of the former placebo subjects were attack-free, i.e. 21.2% had had their first attack and at 
4 weeks post dose, 60.6% were attack-free. The effect of a single dose of lanadelumab waned over time, 
reaching 36.4% attack-free at 6 weeks. This supports the chosen dosing frequency of every 2-4 weeks. 
In analysing the impact of baseline covariates on the time to first attack it was observed that at any given time 
subjects with BMI classified as overweight or obese have an increased probability of having an attack compared 
with normal BMI subjects. 
The mean number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks per month (defined as 28 days) was summarized 
descriptively by study month for each study population.  
For non-rollover subjects, the treatment period includes the entire study period; for rollover subjects, the 
dose-and-wait period is excluded.

Table 19 Mean HAE Attack Rates
a For rollover subjects, the total subject time for the baseline was determined based on a pre-treatment run-in 
period. For non-rollover subjects, the baseline for the non-rollover safety population is defined as historical rate 
of HAE attacks in the last 3 months prior to screening divided by the number of days the subject contributed to 
the historical reporting period multiplied by 28 days.

d Change from End of Treatment period of DX-2930-03 to Treatment Period at Time of Interim Analysis. 
e Change from End of Treatment period of DX-2930-03 to Treatment Period at Time of Interim Analysis. 
Rollover subjects began the pivotal study with an overall higher baseline mean attack rate (3.52 attacks per 
month) than did the non-rollover subjects (2.55 attacks per month), consistent with differences in the eligibility 
criterion of the study. 
For subjects previously treated with lanadelumab in study DX-2930-03, the lanadelumab effect on HAE attack 
rate was maintained. In non-rollover subjects and in rollover placebo subjects, the mean HAE attack rate 
decreased similarly to the findings in study DX-2930-03. All subjects receiving lanadelumab 300 mg q2wks had 
a median attack rate of 0.00. 
The number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks per month was summarized descriptively. In an ad hoc 
statistical analysis, placebo and lanadelumab 150 mg q4wks rollover subjects showed a significant decrease in 
attack rate after transitioning to 300 mg q2wks (p=0.001 and p=0.002, respectively).

In a subgroup analysis for subjects <18 years (N=21), the mean HAE attack rate was 0.18 attacks/months 
compared to 0.30 attacks/month in the entire population (rollovers and non-rollovers); however, the baseline 
attack rate was lower among adolescents than in the entire population (1.58 vs 3.05 attacks/month). 
Preliminary data on investigator-confirmed HAE-attacks requiring acute treatment, moderate or severe HAE 
attacks and high morbidity attacks are consistent with the overall reduction of attack rates in the study and with 
the results in DX-2930-03. 
Approximately 50% of the subjects were attack free during the treatment period up to data lock point for the 
interim report. The length of the treatment period varied between individuals due to the dose-and-wait period 
and to inclusion date in the study. 
Table 20 Number and Percentage of Subjects that are Attack-Free During the Treatment Period 
(Regular Dosing Stage for Rollover Subjects) 
a    Because of the varied length of time to first attack in the dose-and-wait stage, not all 109 rollover subjects 
contributed 3 months in the regular dosing stage (time from 2nd open-label dose to the interim data cut). 
As DX-2930-04 was the first study allowing self-administration at home, a post hoc analysis compared the mean 
HAE attack rate change from baseline in subjects with ≥80% of self-administrations to subjects with ≥80% of 
staff in-clinic administrations.

Note: Baseline HAE attack rate for the rollover safety population is defined as the number of 
investigator-confirmed HAE attacks occurring during the run-in period of DX-2930-03 divided by the total 
number of days in the run-in period multiplied by 28 days. 
Baseline rate for the non-rollover safety population is defined as historical rate of HAE attacks in the last 3 
months prior to screening divided by the number of days the subject contributed to the historical reporting 
period multiplied by 28 days. 
Mean decrease in attack rates was -3.3 attacks/month in the self-administration group and -2.1 in the staff 
assistance group; however, the standard deviations were large and the baseline HAE attack rate was higher in 
the self-administration group (3.6 vs 2.4 attacks/month). In spite of these uncertainties, it is considered that 
administration type does not affect lanadelumab efficacy to a relevant extent. This is supported by population PK 
data, where similar exposure of lanadelumab was seen following SC administration by either health care 
provider or self-administration. 
HAE attacks were collected in study DX-2930-04 following a similar standardized manner similar to that of study 
DX-2930-03. Attacks were initially reported by patients or their family members, then investigator confirmed. 
This facilitates comparisons between the two studies. Clinically meaningful improvements were observed in 
AE-QoL and domain scores (i.e., changes in the AE-QoL total score of at least 6 points) between baseline and 6 
months during the study. Mean AE-QoL scores were reduced (i.e., improved for rollover and non-rollover 
subjects).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical development programme for lanadelumab consists of one pivotal study supported by interim data 
from a long-term open label extension study and data from a “proof-of concept”/dose-finding study. 
DX-2930-03 
The pivotal study, DX-2930-03, was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled HAE 
prevention study with a 26-week long treatment duration. One hundred and twenty five subjects (115 adults 
and 10 adolescents aged 12-≤18) were included in study DX-2930-03 and treated with placebo (N=41) or 
lanadelumab (N=84). Among the adolescents, 4 were treated with placebo and 6 received lanadelumab. The 
limited sample size is considered acceptable given the rareness of the condition. Three different lanadelumab 
dosing regimens were compared to placebo. 
The main eligibility criteria were subjects ≥12 years of age with HAE and at least 1 investigator-confirmed HAE 
attack per 4 weeks. The inclusion of adolescents is strongly endorsed as HAE is a congenital condition which 
usually becomes more severe from adolescence. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in the pivotal study DX-2930-03 was the number of investigator confirmed HAE 
attacks during the treatment period (Day 0 through Day 182) and the secondary endpoints by rank order were 
the number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks requiring acute treatment during the treatment period (Day 
0 through Day 182), the number of moderate or severe investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the 
treatment period (Day 0 through Day 182) and the number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks occurring on 
Day 14 after administration of study drug through Day 182. The endpoints of the study are acceptable. It is 
however noted that the secondary efficacy endpoints are not independent of the primary endpoint, i.e. the same 
results are in part included in both the primary and secondary endpoints. This is considered a form of 
redundancy. However, the exploratory endpoints are at least in part independent of the primary endpoint. 
Patients were allowed to exit earlier during the run-in period if they experienced 3 or more attacks. The 
proportion of patients exiting the run-in period (i.e. after randomisation but before treatment) in advance was 
comparable across randomisation arms (~40% randomised subjects in each arm). Consequently, if the baseline 
HAE attack rate is overestimated due to these ‘escape’ patients, this bias applies to all randomisation arms. 
DX-2930-02 
Study DX-2930-02 was a small dose-ascending study including in total 37 subjects (13 placebo, 24 
lanadelumab). The main objective of the study was to assess safety and tolerability. 
The baseline demographics in the treatment arms were balanced comparing placebo and total lanadelumab with 
the exception of gender. There was however some imbalance between the different lanadelumab treatment 
arms in several parameters. The most prominent difference was seen in the number of HAE attacks which 
ranged from 7.0 attacks in the last 12 months in the lanadelumab 30 mg arm to 35.2 in the lanadelumab 400 mg 
arm (placebo 22.7). However the difficulties to get the treatment arms balanced due to low number of subjects 
in each arm (N=4-11) are acknowledged. 
DX-2930-04 
Study DX-2930-04 was an open-label long term extension study. All subjects received lanadelumab 300 mg 
q2wks. In total, 212 subjects enrolled in the study; 109 from study DX-2930-03 (“rollovers”) and 103 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 68/114 
  
  
“non-rollovers” (whereof 19 subjects from study DX-2930-02). In total 21 subjects ≥12 to <18 years are 
included in the study. The study is still ongoing.  
The main objective of the study was safety. There were no primary efficacy endpoints in the study and the 
efficacy data are mainly descriptive. 
Dosing regimen considerations 
Election of lanadelumab dose for the pivotal Phase 3 DX-2930-03 study was accomplished by the sponsor using 
the safety, PK, and PD data generated in the Phase 1 studies DX-2930-01 (healthy subjects) and DX-2930-02 
(subjects with HAE). The planned range of lanadelumab dosing for the clinical development program was based 
upon  estimation  of  the  level  of  plasma  kallikrein  (pKal)  inhibition  necessary  to  attain  effective  prophylaxis 
against  HAE  attacks.  It  was  hypothesized  that  the  necessary  molar  concentration  of  lanadelumab  would 
correspond to the average Cmax attained following administration of ecallantide, a biologic pKal inhibitor. The 
Cmax obtained following ecallantide administration is approximately 80 nM or 586 ng/mL. 
Drug exposure appeared to be dose-proportional and consistent with the results obtained in healthy subjects in 
Study DX-2930-01. In study DX-2930-02, two lanadelumab doses of 300 mg or greater administered 2 weeks 
apart resulted in a normalization of plasma cHMWK levels and a reduction in HAE attacks. Steady-state trough 
concentrations  predicted  using  PK  parameters  determined  in  Study  DX-2930-02  indicated  that  the  plasma 
concentration of lanadelumab after two administrations of 300 mg 2 weeks apart was approximately 27,000 
ng/mL (180 nM). 
Doses of 300 mg or 150 mg lanadelumab administered every 4 weeks would result in a steady-state trough 
concentration of approximately 9,500 and 4,750 ng/ml, respectively. These trough levels bracket the  Cmax 
observed in the 100 mg dose group in Study DX-2930-02, which demonstrated a slight, but not statistically 
significant, reduction in cHMWK levels.  
The 3 dose-regimen combinations, 150 mg q4wks, 300 mg q4wks, and 300 mg q2wks, were used in the pivotal 
study  DX-2930-03  provided  a  6-fold  range  of  steady-state  trough  concentrations  and  leveraged  both  the 
biomarker and efficacy data generated in Study DX-2930-02.  The dosing regimen 150 mg q2wks has not been 
studied. It is considered that the dosage of 150 mg should have been evaluated in the phase 2 study and, if 
relevant, as 150mg q2w in the phase 3 study; 150 mg q2wks could be sufficient for example for an subject 
weighing 50 kg. Upon CHMP request, the Applicant provided extrapolations of the exposure to lanadelumab for 
150 mg q2w. The lanadelumab 150 mg q2wks dosing regimen is not recommended in adult patients since the 
average Cave,ss (14,200 ng/ml) of lanadelumab is expected to be lower than the IC90 for cHMWK (18,777 ng/ml) 
and the IC90 for the monthly rate of HAE attack (33,900 ng/ml).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Efficacy data 
Pivotal study DX-2930-03 
The baseline demographics were not fully balanced across the treatment groups.  
The proportion of male subjects was 17.1% in the placebo arm vs 35.7% in the lanadelumab arms, ranging from 
28.6% in the 150 mg q4wks arm to 44.4% in the 300 mg q2wks arm. This is notable, since there are 
publications indicating a more severe disease in women. Randomization was stratified by the baseline attack 
rate observed during the run-in period. The imbalance in gender between the treatment arms therefore 
indicates that there was no major correlation between gender and attack frequency. This is also supported by 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 69/114 
  
  
subgroup analysis, where no treatment differences regarding gender compared to the entire population were 
detected.  
Furthermore, the proportion of black/African American subjects was higher in the lanadelumab 300 mg q4wks 
arm than in the other treatment arms including placebo (20.7% vs 3.6-4.9%). However, in total, only 12 
subjects with other race than white were included in the study. Subgroup analyses are hampered by the low 
number of subjects. 
Of note, European centres represented only 5 / 41 centres with 29/126 randomized patients. 
The primary endpoint of the pivotal study was the number of investigator conformed HAE attacks during the 6 
month treatment period, expressed as HAE attack rate (mean HAE attacks/4 weeks). 
The number of investigator confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period was reduced in all lanadelumab 
treatment arms compared to placebo (p<0.001 for all lanadelumab arms vs placebo). The relative risk reduction 
compared to placebo ranged from 73% in the 300 mg q4wks arm to 87% in the 300 mg q2wks arm, 
corresponding to a decrease of approximately 1.5 attack/4 weeks in the 150 mg q4wks and 300 mg q4wks arms 
and 1.75 attacks/4 weeks in the 300 mg q2wks treatment arm based on LS mean HAE attack rate in the four 
treatment arms.  
Based on both the primary analysis (model-based) and crude rates, it seems there was a “placebo effect” in the 
DX-2930-03 trial, as 1/3 of patients in the placebo achieved ≥50 % reduction of HAE attacks.  The causes of this 
cannot be fully determined and will remain unclear. Nevertheless, the presence of a study effect across all arms 
does not impact the conclusions on the comparison of the attack rate between the arms during the treatment 
period, which was the primary objective. 
In spite of stratification by the baseline attack rate observed during the run-in period, the mean rate of HAE 
attacks during run-in was not fully balanced and the standard deviations [SD] were large (placebo: 4.02 [3.26] 
attacks/4 weeks; lanadelumab 150 mg q4wks 3.22 [1.83], lanadelumab 300 mg q4wks 3.71 [2.51] and 
lanadelumab 300 mg q2wks 3.52 [2.33]). This could be due to the highest stratum being indefinitely large (≥3 
attacks/4 weeks). Nevertheless, this may have impact on the robustness of the data.  
The primary efficacy analysis was a Poisson model with HAE attack rate during the baseline (run-in) period 
included as a covariate. The Applicant has provided an overview on the effect of baseline attack rate on attack 
rate during the trial, including a subgroup analysis on HAE attack rate based on run-in period HAE attack rate. 
Data provided confirm that the treatment period attack rate was strongly influenced by the baseline attack rate 
(the higher the run-in period attack rate, the higher the treatment period attack rate). In all subgroups, the 
decrease in HAE attack rate was larger in the lanadelumab treatment arms compared to placebo. These changes 
were statistically significant at the 0.05 level, with the exception of 150 mg every 4 weeks in the subgroup 
Run-in HAE attack rate 1-<2 attacks/month. Furthermore, the Applicant has provided data on the absolute 
change from baseline in each treatment arm for the primary and secondary endpoints. For all endpoints, the 
change from baseline was 38-40% in the placebo arm and 84-86%, 84-97% and 88-92% for lanadelumab 150 
mg q4w, 300 mg q4w and 300 mg q2w, respectively. This is considered to be of clinical relevance. 
For the primary endpoint, pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed. Results from subgroup analyses 
were generally consistent with the results from the entire population  
In the pivotal study, there were three secondary efficacy endpoints. Lanadelumab treatment reduced the 
number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks requiring acute treatment during the treatment period (Day 0 
through Day 182), the number of moderate or severe investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment 
period and the number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks occurring on Day 14 through Day 182 compared 
to placebo. The exploratory analyses included proportion of subjects with severe attacks, median time to the 
Assessment report

Page 70/114 
  
  
first investigator confirmed HAE attack, responder rate analyses and total and all domain (functioning, 
fatigue/mood, fear/shame, and nutrition) quality of life scores. The exploratory analyses support the results 
from the primary endpoint of a beneficial effect of lanadelumab compared to placebo. 
Study DX-2930-02 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the number of HAE attacks per week from Day 8 to Day 50. The mean number 
of HAE attacks/week was lower in subjects treated with two doses of lanadelumab 300 mg or 400 mg (mean 
[SD]  0.034  [0.129])  compared  to  placebo  (0.364  [0.364])  (p=0.0012).  The  effects  on  HAE  attacks  were 
strongly associated with drug exposure, corroborating the results of the primary efficacy analysis. 
The beneficial effect of lanadelumab in prevention of HAE-attacks was further supported by a post hoc analysis 
comparing mean lanadelumab concentration with incidence of HAE attacks indicating a correlation between 
lanadelumab exposure and the number of attacks. 
Extension study DX-2930-04 
All results in study DX-2930-04 are preliminary as the study is still ongoing.  
The number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks per month was summarized descriptively. For subjects 
previously treated with lanadelumab in study DX-2930-03, the effect from the pivotal study was maintained.  
In non-rollover subjects, the mean HAE attack rate decreased from 1.54-2.72 attacks/month at baseline to 
0.14-0.34 attacks/month at interim analysis and in rollover placebo subjects from 3.81 to 0.39 attacks/month. 
This is in concordance with the findings in study DX-2930-03.  
At the time of the interim analysis (including 12 months of lanadelumab exposure across both studies for 75 
subjects), all subjects receiving lanadelumab 300 mg q2wks had a median attack rate of 0.00. This indicates a 
sustained effect of lanadelumab. 
In an ad hoc statistical analysis, placebo and lanadelumab 150 mg q4wks rollover subjects showed a significant 
decrease in attack rate after transitioning to 300 mg q2wks (p=0.001 and p=0.002, respectively).  
The preliminary data on investigator-confirmed HAE-attacks requiring acute treatment, moderate or severe HAE 
attacks and high morbidity attacks are consistent with the overall reduction of attack rates in the study and with 
the results in DX-2930-03. 
Subjects <18 years 
8.0% of the subjects in the pivotal study were adolescents aged ≥12 to <18 years; however, the absolute 
number of adolescents subjects was low (N = 10; placebo 4, lanadelumab 6). In the extension study 
DX-2930-04, 21 subjects ≥12 to <18 years (9.9% of study population) were treated with lanadelumab, 
including 8 rollovers from DX-2930-03. Overall, 23 unique paediatric subjects received lanadelumab in one or 
both studies: 2 paediatric subjects in Study DX-2930-03 only and 17 paediatric subjects in Study DX-2930-04 
only (4 placebo-treated rollover subjects and 13 non-rollover subjects); 4 subjects were counted as paediatric 
subjects in both studies.  
Of the 23 paediatric subjects across the 2 Phase 3 studies, 14 subjects were in 12-14 years age group, while 9 
subjects were in 15-17 years age group.  
The highest weight based dose evaluated is 3.0 mg /kg which correspond to 120 mg for an adolescent (weighing 
about 40 kg) and to 150 to 240 mg for an adult weighing (50 to 80 kg).In the population pharmacokinetic 
modelling, an approximately 37% higher exposure in adolescents than adults (18 to 65 years) was predicted, as 
expected due to an overall lower body weight in adolescents. However, the AUC range was quite large; 121- 832 
ug*d/ml in adults and 321-1050 ug*d/mL in adolescents. It was considered less probable that the additional 
Assessment report

Page 71/114 
  
  
exposure in adolescents will exert any major impact on efficacy and safety. The difference in exposure between 
adults and adolescents are considered to be secondary to differences in mean weight between the two groups.  
As in the entire population, the HAE attack rate was numerically lower in lanadelumab treated subjects than in 
placebo treated subjects in study DX-2930-03; however, the number of subjects in this subgroup was low and 
the 95% confidence intervals covered 1. However, a lower effect in adolescents is not anticipated, given the 
slightly higher exposure. In study DX-2930-04, the mean HAE attack rate was 0.18 attacks/months in subjects 
<18 years compared to 0.30 attacks/month in the entire population (rollovers and non-rollovers); however, the 
baseline attack rate was lower among adolescents than in the entire population (1.58 vs 3.05 attacks/month).  
In summary, data in adolescents is limited. Nevertheless, HAE usually presents during childhood or adolescence 
with intermittent episodes of potentially life-threatening angioedema. Indication 
The Applicant has proposed the following wording of the indication “[Lanadelumab] is indicated for routine 
prevention of attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in patients aged 12 years and older”.  
The wording “routine” indicates that the prevention is given on an everyday basis as opposed to prevention 
given e.g. before surgery. This is endorsed by CHMP. 
The eligibility criteria in the pivotal study included a baseline rate of at least 1 investigator-confirmed HAE attack 
per 4 weeks, i.e. a subset of HAE subjects with frequent attacks. Upon request, the Applicant has provided a 
summary of the baseline HAE attack characteristics in studies DX-2930-02, DX-2930-03 and DX-2930-04 as 
well as an overview of efficacy and safety in study DX-2930-04 in different baseline HAE attack rate subgroups. 
Data provided confirm that the treatment period attack rate was strongly influenced by the baseline attack rate 
(the higher the run-in period attack rate, the higher the treatment period attack rate). However, effect was 
shown in all investigated HAE attack rate groups. The posology reflects that lanadelumab should be used only in 
subjects with recurrent HAE attacks.  Additionally, the SmPC clearly mentions that lanadelumab cannot be used 
for treatment of acute attacks. 
In all clinical studies, only subjects with HAE type I or II were included. Those conditions are characterised by 
either a deficiency or a dysfunction of C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), leading to dysregulation of plasma 
kallikrein activity. “HAE with normal C1-INH activity”, i.e. HAE other than HAE1 or HAE2 is a heterogeneous 
entity comprising of e.g. HAE caused by mutations in the coagulation factor XII (F12) gene, the plasminogen 
(PLG) gene, or the angiopoietin-1 gene (ANGPT1). In many cases the aetiology is unknown.  
The applicant was asked to discuss whether the results on HAE type I and II could be extrapolated to other forms 
of HAE. The applicant presented supporting information  from  literature that subjects with F12-HAE and 
PLG-HAE may have an increased FXII activation, implicating a role for the kallikrein-kinin system in angioedema 
formation also in this population. The CHMP agreed that extrapolation to other forms of HAE is acceptable since 
the kallikrein-kinin system may be involved also in other forms of “HAE with normal C1-INH activity”. Therefore, 
given the severity of the disease and based on this theoretical rationale for extrapolating the effect to subjects 
with other forms of HAE, the general wording “HAE” rather than “HAE type I and II” is accepted. Additionally, the 
absence of data for subjects with HAE with normal C1 INH-activity-  is adequately stated in sections 4.4 and 5.1 
of the SmPC. 
Posology 
The proposed starting dose 300 mg q2w is supported by PK and PD data. As study DX-2930-03 was not powered 
to detect differences in efficacy between the different lanadelumab treatment arms, no statistical comparisons 
of the treatment difference in the three lanadelumab treatment arms were made. In the pivotal study, all 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 72/114 
  
  
 
lanadelumab dosing regimens were superior to placebo; however, the effects of lanadelumab were numerically 
somewhat larger using the dosing regimen 300 mg q2wks. It could be argued that the difference in reduction in 
mean attack rate relative placebo (87% for 300 mg q2w vs 76% for 150 mg q4w and 73% for 300 mg q4w) is 
of limited clinical relevance. On the other hand, the LS mean monthly attack rate during treatment in the 300 mg 
q2w arm was approximately half that of 150 mg q4w and 300 mg q4w (0.26 vs 0.48 and 0.53, respectively), 
which is considered relevant given that HAE attacks are potentially fatal. Furthermore, the safety data of 
lanadelumab seems generally benign and the number of AEs in the different treatment arms was comparable. 
The starting dose 300 mg q2w is therefore acknowledged.  
In all studies, overweight subjects were in majority, e.g. 21 subjects with weight ≥100 kg were included in study 
DX-2930-03. Moreover, in analysing the impact of baseline covariates on the time to first attack it was observed 
that at any given time subjects with BMI classified as overweight or obese have an increased probability of 
having an attack compared with normal BMI subjects. 
Pharmacokinetic analyses suggest a lower exposure in subjects with higher body weight. An ad hoc subgroup 
analysis based on weight was performed in study DX-2930-03. Effect on HAE attack rate of 300 mg q2w was 
shown in all weight subgroups, including subjects ≥100 kg. On the contrary, the dose regimen 150 mg q4w did 
not exert any effect on HAE attack rate in subjects ≥100 kg. It should be noted that due to the relatively small 
study, the number of subjects in each subgroup is low. However, the number of subjects in the >100 kg 
subgroup (N=9) was comparable to the other weight subgroups.  
In studyDX-2930-04, the mean percent change from baseline in HAE attack rate in non-rollover subjects ≥100 
kg (N=21), was -87.0% [SD15.0], which was comparable with the other weight groups (93.5% [11.6], 68.9% 
[150.6] and 89.2% [19.0] for weight <50 kg, 50-<75 kg, and 75-<100kg, respectively). 
Using PK/PD data, the applicant has clarified that the 300 mg q2wks dosing was associated with lanadelumab 
exposure approximate or above the IC90 of PD and EAUC90 for efficacy in patients across a large range of body 
weight (46.8-150 kg). Taken together, a special dosing regimen for heavy subjects is not considered needed.  
Low weight is associated with a higher lanadelumab exposure. Therefore, a lower dose regimen  (300 mg Q4w) 
may considered and is mentioned in the posology section. 
No relevant differences between the TEAE profiles for subjects <50 kg compared to other weight groups were 
identified. The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAE was injection site pain. However, in total, only 
7 subjects with weight <50 kg have been included in the two phase 3 studies DX-2930-03 and DX-2930-04.  
The highest percentage of subjects (44%) on lanadelumab 300 mg q2wks were attack-free for the entire 26 
weeks (~ 6 months) treatment period, and ~ 77% of subjects were attack-free day 70-182 compared to 44% 
in the 300 mg q4wks dose regimen. The applicant proposes that the dose may be reduced to 300 mg q4wks in 
subjects who are stably attack free. This is endorsed, especially in subjects with low weight. This is also reflected 
in the posology. 
A post hoc analysis to the ongoing extension study DX-2930-04 compared the mean HAE attack rate change 
from baseline in subjects with ≥80% of self-administrations to subjects with ≥80% of staff in-clinic 
administrations. Mean decrease in attack rates was -3.3 attacks/month in the self-administration group and -2.1 
in the staff assistance group; however, the standard deviations were large and the baseline HAE attack rate was 
higher in the self-administration group (3.6 vs 2.4 attacks/month). In spite of these uncertainties, it is 
considered that administration type does not affect lanadelumab efficacy to a relevant extent. This is supported 
by population PK data, where similar exposure of lanadelumab was seen following SC administration by either 
health care provider or self-administration. From an efficacy point of view, self-administration is considered 
acceptable.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The applicant has justified the proposed wording for the therapeutic indication “[Lanadelumab] is indicated for 
routine prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in patients aged 12 years and older”.  
Pivotal study DX-2930-03 met its primary endpoint (the number of investigator conformed HAE attacks during 
the 6 month treatment period, expressed as HAE attack rate) and the three secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Numerically, the 300 mg q2wks dose was consistently most effective, although all dosing regimens were more 
effective than placebo.  
The efficacy data are supported by exploratory endpoints and by data from study DX-2930-02 and DX-2930-04.  
Although data on mortality are not expected as the clinical data submitted remain limited in term of duration, 
significant decreases in the number of attacks as well as data on amelioration of the severity of the attacks 
would possibly lead to a decrease in mortality and improvements in quality of life.  
Additionally, the administration via subcutaneous route and frequency of lanadelumab offers an improvement 
for patient care compared to other substances registered for prevention of HAE attacks in the EU. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety of lanadelumab was evaluated in four clinical studies: 
•  DX-2930-01, phase 1, first in human, dose 0.1 to 3.0 mg/kg, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study in healthy adults 
•  DX-2930-02, phase 1b, dose 30–400 mg, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adults 
with HAE  
•  DX-2930-03, phase 3, pivotal, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects aged 12 
years or older with HAE  
•  DX-2930-04, phase 3, open-label study in subjects aged 12 years or older with HAE. Ongoing study, 
cut-off date of 01 Sep 2017 (updated in response to questions to provide 4 months of additional data, 
cut-off date 01 Jan 2018) 
Study DX-2930-03 allows for direct evaluation of the safety of lanadelumab compared to placebo and is 
considered the main study for safety assessment, whereas analyses using the pooled lanadelumab-treated 
population in the phase 3 studies (n=220, out of which 212 subjects had experience from both phase 3 studies 
and 8 who discontinued/not-rolled over from DX-2930-03) will explore if any new safety signals emerge with 
longer term exposure and within patient subgroups.  
Approximately half (42%) of the 4216 lanadelumab administrations in the Phase 3 studies were 
self-administered.  
In the Phase 3 studies (DX-2390-03 and DX-2930-04), angioedema attacks were reported as AEs and the most 
frequently reported TEAEs in the Phase 3 studies were HAE attacks. Efficacy endpoints in both studies were 
related to angioedema attacks. 
For the presentation of the safety profile, data from the two Phase 1 studies have not been integrated with the 
Phase 3 studies because the safety profile of lanadelumab administered to asymptomatic HAE patients and 
healthy volunteer subjects was considered to possibly be different from the safety profile of HAE patients.

Patient exposure 
Table 22 
HAE=hereditary angioedema; OLE=open-label extension 
a Eight placebo-treated and 11 lanadelumab-treated subjects in Study DX-2930-02 subsequently enrolled in Study 
DX-2930-04. No subject from prior lanadelumab study was allowed in Study DX-2930-03; therefore, no subject from 
Study DX-2930-02 enrolled into Study DX-2930-03. 
b 33 placebo-treated and 76 lanadelumab-treated subjects in Study DX-2930-03 rolled over to Study DX-2930-04. 
c Includes 24 subjects from DX-2930-01, 24 subjects from DX-2930-02, 84 subjects from Study DX-2930-03, and 125 
subjects from Study DX-2930-04 (92 non-rollovers not previously exposed to lanadelumab and 33 placebo-treated subjects 
in Study DX-2930-03 who rolled over). 
d Includes 8 subjects from DX-2930-01, 5 subjects from DX-2930-02, and 8 subjects from Study DX-2930-03 (did not 
rollover into Study DX-2930-04) who received placebo only and never received lanadelumab in any clinical study. 
Rollovers and non-rollovers in open-label study DX-2930-04 
Rollovers: Subjects in DX-2930-04 who had completed the double-blind treatment period at Day 182 of Study 
DX-2930-03 and consented to enter Study DX-2930-04. The first DX-2930-04 visit for rollover subjects (Day 0) 
occurred on the same day as the DX-2930-03 Day 182 study visit. Note that rollover subjects could have been 
in both the active- and placebo group in study DX-2930-03. 
Non-rollovers: Subjects who were not participants in Study DX-2930-03; included those who were new to the 
lanadelumab clinical development program and those who had participated in Study DX-2930-02 i.e. 
non-rollovers could have been pre-exposed to lanadelumab. 
The median total dose received for the lanadelumab-treated population was 4800 mg (range: 300-11,400 mg). 
The highest exposure was for subjects who received 300 mg q2wk across both phase 3 studies (8100 mg median 
total dose) and lowest exposure was for placebo-rollover subjects and non-rollovers subjects participating in 
Study DX-2930-04 (4500 mg median total dose). 
205/220 (93%) received exposure to lanadelumab for at least 6 months and 50% (110/220) of subjects were 
exposed for ≥9 months. 75 subjects had at least 1 year of cumulative study experience with lanadelumab. 70/75 
were rollovers with experience on Study DX-2930-03 and Study DX-2930-04. 
The demographic profile of subjects included in the phase 3 trials in US, Canada, Jordan and Europe is generally 
considered representative for HAE patients, although it is noted that overweight and obese patients might be 
overrepresented. It is also noted that the ethnicity of the safety population is almost exclusively white.  
Lanadelumab is intended for long-term treatment of HAE. However, only 75 subjects have been exposed for one 
year in the study program.

Adverse events 
Phase 3 Studies 
Table 23 Study DX-2930-03 Overall summary of TEAEs (excluding HAE attack adverse events) 
during the treatment period (day 0 to day 182) 
Overall, there were more TEAEs in the lanadelumab treated group compared to placebo, 91% vs 76%, more 
related TEAEs 60% vs 34% and more serious TEAEs 5% vs 0%. Numerically there is a trend that the highest 
dose group, 300 mg q2 wks, had more TEAEs and more related TEAEs compared to the other lanadelumab 
groups. 
However, no deaths and no related serious TEAEs were reported during the study.

Table 24 Study DX-2930-04 Overall summary of TEAEs (excluding HAE attack adverse events) 
during the treatment period 
In study DX-2930-04 all subjects were exposed to the same lanadelumab dose. Exposure time for roll-over 
subjects are generally longer than for non-rollovers. Nevertheless, no major difference between roll-overs and 
non-rollovers was observed. No deaths and no related serious TEAEs were reported during the study. There 
were few discontinuations. 
Treatment-emergent HAE attacks reported as AEs 
Study DX-2930-03 
Fifty two of 84 subjects (62%) in the 3 lanadelumab treatment arms had at least 1 treatment-emergent HAE 
attack reported events: 17/28 (61%) in the 150 mg q4wks arm, 20/29 (69%) subjects in the 300 mg q4wks 
arm, 15/27 (56%) subjects in the 300 mg q2 wks arm, and 40/41 subjects (98%) in the placebo arm. There 
were 239 TEAEs in the 3 lanadelumab treatment arms and 577 TEAEs in the placebo arm. 
No subject in the lanadelumab treatment arms had a related treatment-emergent HAE attack AE. Two of 41 
subjects (4.9%) in the placebo arm had 19 related treatment-emergent HAE attacks. 
One SAE occurred in 1/84 lanadelumab-treated subjects (1.2%) and 1/41 placebo-treated subjects (2.4%) had 
an SAE. None of the SAEs were considered related to the study treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 77/114 
  
  
 
12/84 (14%) subjects in the lanadelumab treatment arms had a severe TEAE: 5/28 (18%) subjects in the 
150mg q4wks arm, 5/29 (17%) subjects in the 300 mg q4wks arm, 
2/27 subjects (7.4%) in the lanadelumab 300 mg q2wks arm, and 11/41 (27%) in the placebo arm. One severe 
TEAE was considered related to the study treatment. 
One subject in the placebo arm discontinued due to a treatment emergent HAE attack. 
It is acknowledged that in the placebo controlled study DX-2930-03, fewer lanadelumab treated subjects 
experienced HAE attacks (62% vs 98%) reported as adverse events and that also severe HAE attacks 
numerically were reduced compared to placebo. 
Study DX-2930-04 
75% of subjects experienced HAE attacks reported as TEAEs. The protocol required rollover subjects to have 1 
attack before regular dosing commenced. Therefore, virtually all of the rollover subjects had at least 1 HAE 
attack (98%) when the “dose-and-wait” stage prior to regular dosing was included in the analysis. When 
excluding the results from the “dose-and-wait” stage, 49% rollover subjects experienced HAE attacks reported 
as TEAEs (ie, during the regular dosing stage). All non-rollover subjects began to receive regular dosing starting 
on Day 0 of the study; 51% experienced HAE attacks during the treatment period.

In study DX-2930-03, injection site reactions are the most common TEAE, which are further discussed in the 
AESI section. Among the most common adverse events reported in study DX-2930-03 were viral respiratory 
upper tract infections; these adverse events were equally common in both groups. Headache was also 
commonly reported, with the same rate in actively and placebo-treated patients.

In study DX-2930-03, related TEAEs are dominated by injection site reactions, which are further discussed in the 
AESI section.  
Injection site reactions are also common in the ongoing open-label study (DX-2930-04).  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths occurred during any of the clinical studies. 
Phase 3 studies: 
Study DX-2930-03 
Serious TEAEs were reported by 4 lanadelumab-treated subjects (catheter site infection, pyelonephritis, 
meniscus injury, and bipolar II disorder). None of the SAEs was considered related to the study treatment. All 
four subjects were hospitalized due to the serious TEAEs.  
No placebo-treated subject reported an SAE. 
Study DX-2930-04 
8 subjects experienced 11 SAEs. None of the SAEs were considered related and were different diagnoses with no 
observable pattern.  
One subject reporting SAE events of upper GI haemorrhage and suspected pneumonia after accidental ingestion 
of a caustic solution [hypochlorite]) discontinued the study as a result.  
One subject reported an SAE in both Study DX-2930-03 (bipolar II disorder) and Study DX-2930-04 (lumbar 
spinal stenosis).  
One subject was diagnosed with relapsed gluteal fibrosarcoma and continued the study after the surgery. This 
was the only malignancy reported during the conduct of the lanadelumab clinical studies.

Safety update 
Since lanadelumab is intended for long-term use, it is of interest to know if the frequency of AEs changes over 
time. It is noted that the division of subjects into rollovers and non-rollovers do not directly translate to subjects 
with longer and shorter lanadelumab exposure. No placebo-controlled data is available after 6 months of 
treatment but open label extension study is ongoing. An updated summary of the safety profile of lanadelumab 
based on the 120 days safety update data cut on 01 Jan 2018 (4 months of additional information available from 
the ongoing Study DX-2930-04 since the initial filing) was provided during the assessment. See below.

frequency in Study DX-2930-03 and Study DX-2930-04 (Data Cut-120 Days Safety 
Update)-Rollover Population 
A comparison of study DX-2930-03 and DX-2930-04 regarding incidence rates for the pooled lanadelumab 
treated population (Table 20) suggests that the incidence rates for TEAEs are not increasing over time. 
Moreover, no treatment-related SAEs or deaths were reported and no additional related severe TEAEs have been 
reported since the initial submission. There was no increase in SAEs or AESIs with longer term exposure to 
lanadelumab.  
Figure 9 shows that common adverse events in the overall lanadelumab treated group are consistently 
overlapping between study DX-2930-03 compared to study DX-2930-04, with the exception of injection site 
pain, which tend to occur more often in the placebo controlled study. The rates of discontinuations are 6/84 in 
study DX-2930-03 compared to 7/76 in study DX-2930-04. AE reported as a reason for discontinuation concerns 
one patient in each study. 
Altogether, data do not suggest that common adverse events or discontinuations would increase over time (and 
therefore be more common in the follow-up study).

Laboratory findings 
Phase 3 Studies 
Hematology 
In study DX-2930-03, all subjects in the placebo arm and the pooled lanadelumab treatment arms had values in 
the normal range during the pre-treatment and the treatment periods. 
In study DX-2930-04; a total of 3 subjects (1 rollover and 2 non-rollovers) shifted from normal to low values in 
neutrophils. 
In study DX-2930-04, one subject reported five events, which was related to blood loss following surgery to 
remove a gluteal fibrosarcoma. 
Coagulation 
Background 
There was a trend for slight increase in aPTT and other coagulation parameters for lanadelumab-treated 
subjects compared with placebo-treated subjects. Prolongation of aPTT is an expected on target effect of plasma 
kallikrein inhibition in the coagulation assay since aPTT reagents (kaolin, silica or ellagic acid or dextran sulfate) 
activate FXII to FXIIa, which then cleaves prekallikrein to generate plasma kallikrein. Plasma kallikrein, in turn, 
generates additional FXIIa, which converts FXI to FXIa to initiate coagulation via the intrinsic pathway (Wu, 
2015).  
In contrast to patients with severe prekallikrein deficiency, lanadelumab does not completely inhibit plasma 
kallikrein activity, as evidenced by cleaved high molecular weight kininogen (cHMWK) pharmacodynamic 
biomarker levels in plasma of lanadelumab treated HAE patients that approach that of healthy controls (Banerji 
et al., 2017). Deficiencies in either of the contact system proteins (FXII, HMWK, or prekallikrein), as well as FXI, 
are identified through a prolongation of the aPTT in the test (Silverberg et al., 1995). While a deficiency in FXI 
can be associated with impaired hemostasis (hemophilia C), severe deficiencies in the other three contact 
system proteins (FXII, HMWK, or prekallikrein) do not induce a bleeding tendency (Schmaier, 2016). A severe 
deficiency in prekallikrein leads to an aPTT that can be in excess of 100 seconds in the test, whereas the normal 
reference range for the assay is usually 25-40 seconds (Girolami et al., 2010; Silverberg et al., 1995). Despite 
the long aPTT, there is no increased risk of bleeding. Therefore, a prolonged aPTT due to plasma kallikrein 
inhibition is not predictive of impaired in vivo coagulation and not related to a bleeding risk.

. Change in Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time from Baseline to End of 
Treatment by Treatment Group in Study DX-293003-(Safety Population* 
In study DX-2930-03, aPTT is well balanced between groups at baseline, day 0. Changes from baseline are in 
line with what can be predicted from primary pharmacology with increases in aPTT. The increase in aPTT seems 
dose-dependent and changes appear from the first measurement after study start, i.e. day 28. These changes 
are then maintained throughout the study period up to day 182.  
In study DX-2930-04 aPTT was monitored and the change from baseline is shown to be elevated, at most 5.71 
seconds at day 224 on group level. For the individual subject with the largest increase, aPTT was increased 86.9 
s. The actual value was 120.5 s, at day 56. The increases in aPTT do not seem to increase with time.

Table 30 Study DX-2930-03 Shift table of highest coagulation by treatment group 
Increases are according to the applicant small and 83/84 lanadelumab treated subjects had aPTT <1.5 x ULN. In 
study DX-2930-03, prothrombin international normalized ratio and prothrombin time are balanced between 
groups. No bleeding events were observed in association with a prolonged aPTT, and no effects on PT, INR were 
observed in subjects treated with lanadelumab. It is therefore agreed that increases in aPTT are not considered 
related to an increased risk of bleeding and that the observed aPTT prolongations are therefore not clinically 
relevant. 
Overall, presented findings are supportive of the view that increased aPTT levels can be considered as laboratory 
finding consistent with the mechanism of action. 
Liver-related Biochemical Tests  
Some lanadelumab treated subjects were noted to have transient asymptomatic elevations in ALAT to >3x ULN 
during study DX-2930-03. The clinical picture in these subjects was generally one of extensive comorbidities 
including prior liver disease such as hepatic steatosis or presumed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatic 
adenoma resection, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and/or prior hepatotoxic drug use (eg, danazol).

Pooled phase 3 study experience  
Elevated ALT >3X ULN (regardless of baseline - with up to 3X allowed) was reported in 10 of 233 subjects 
(4.3%) 
All 10 subjects (4 in study DX-2930-03, 6 in study DX-2930-04) with elevations were asymptomatic, with no 
associated hyperbilirubinemia (no Hy's Law cases) or elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 
5/10 returned to baseline while lanadelumab was continued (with drug tolerance/adaptation in evidence) 
2 subjects had an intentional rechallenge (and both were negative) 
2 subjects discontinued at the discretion of investigator - with no sequelae 
1 subject was paused and is undergoing further evaluation 
Summary points 
- Asymptomatic, reversible, mild-moderate ALT/AST elevations with a latency of 1-6 months; the incidence 
appears to be <5% of subjects 
- Evidence for drug tolerance (adaptation) is apparent and seems to be the most common course 
- No signs of hypersensitivity reactions 
- No Hy's Law cases or cases of acute liver failure 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018

- No grade 4 ALT/AST elevations 
- Negative rechallenge responses have been seen when lanadelumab has been paused and restarted 
- No correlation of ALT/AST elevations to plasma concentrations 
- No antidrug antibody formation for all 10 subjects 
One patient  discontinued lanadelumab treatment due to elevated transaminases and the transaminases fell 
after treatment discontinuation, which could be interpreted as a positive dechallenge. It is concurred that 2/4 
patients had pre-existing liver disease (hepatic steatosis).  
There is currently insufficient evidence to suggest that individuals with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis are at 
increased risk of drug induced liver injury while on lanadelumab. Patients with AT elevations can thus be given 
lanadelumab.  
It can be concurred that metabolism of proteins (e.g. lanadelumab) generally does not generate toxic 
intermediates and, therefore, monoclonal antibodies are unlikely to induce drug induced liver injury via 
production of toxic metabolites. It is argued by the applicant that hepatotoxicity has not been identified as a 
general safety concern with therapeutic monoclonal antibodies as a class. However, there are examples of 
licensed monoclonal antibodies with elevated aminotransferases as common adverse reactions. 
Overall, it is plausible to attribute some of the observed enzyme elevations to lanadelumab treatment and it is 
agreed that such transaminase elevations could currently be regarded as idiosyncratic. However, it is still 
considered unknown whether lanadelumab could potentially be linked with more pronounced transaminase 
elevations in a larger treatment population. Cases of jaundice and hepatitis have for example been observed in 
the post-marketing experience for other monoclonal antibodies. 
Other clinical chemistry parameters 
In study DX-2930-03, all subjects in the placebo arm and the pooled lanadelumab treatment arms had values in 
the normal range during the pretreatment and the treatment periods for chemistry parameters of glucose, 
potassium, and urea nitrogen. 
Creatinine level 
In study DX-2930-03, on group level there were no increases in creatinine observed in the lanadelumab treated 
population. 2/27 (7.4%) subjects in the lanadelumab 300 mg q2wks arm had creatinine value >1.5 x ULN during 
the pretreatment period. For 1 subject, the creatinine level was normal during the treatment period, while the 
creatinine level for the other subject remained elevated at >1.5 x ULN during the treatment period. A shift from 
pretreatment period normal value (≤1.5 x ULN) to a higher value (>1.5 x ULN) was observed for creatinine 
(mg/dL) in 1/29 (3.4%) subjects in the lanadelumab 300 mg q4wks treatment arm.  
Electrocardiogram findings 
In studies DX-2930-03, DX-2930-04 and in the phase 1 studies, according to the applicant, no clinically 
significant ECG abnormality, e.g QTc prolongation or QRS widened complexes was observed in any subject. 
Vital signs 
In studies DX-2930-03, DX-2930-04 and in the phase 1 studies, according to the applicant, there were no 
important safety signals identified in terms of mean changes from baseline or categorical shifts from normal to 
abnormal in vital sign results.

Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) 
Hypersensitivity 
Monoclonal antibodies are known to cause hypersensitivity reactions (Kleyman and Weintraub, 2012), that 
include injection site reactions (Corominas et al., 2014).  
No anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid events were reported in the phase 3 studies.  
Some AESIs were reported by the specific preferred term of “hypersensitivity”, while other events were reported 
as “injection site reactions” but identified as an AESI by the Investigator. Both types of events are described in 
the following sections of “hypersensitivity”.  
Study DX-2930-03 
Three lanadelumab-treated subjects had a total of 5 related events (all mild in severity) that were 
investigator-defined AESI, with the preferred terms of injection site reaction, erythema, or induration. 
In the lanadelumab 300 mg q2wks treatment arm, 1 subject had 2 related events reported as hypersensitivity 
reactions (1 mild and 1 moderate in severity), which included symptoms of tingling, itchiness, and discomfort of 
the tongue, dry cough, and mild headache.  
None of the 4 subjects received any concomitant treatment for the AESI of hypersensitivity; they completed the 
study without any further symptoms and rolled over into Study DX-2930-04.  
No subject in the placebo group experienced an investigator-defined AESI of hypersensitivity. 
Study DX-2930-04 
There were 7 investigator-reported hypersensitivity AESIs in 6 subjects. One AESI of hypersensitivity was 
classified as related and severe. It coincided with an HAE attack. Three subjects discontinued lanadelumab to 
AESIs of hypersensitivity reactions (2 subjects) or injection site papule (1 subject). 
Overall, hypersensitivity reactions are adequately described and considered as identified risk in the lanadelumab 
treated population. It is noted that there are so far no anaphylactic reactions reported in the study population. 
Disordered coagulation (hypercoagulability events and bleeding events) 
Study DX-2930-03 
A total of 17 (20%) of lanadelumab-treated subjects had 32 events and 6 (15%) placebo-treated subjects had 
14 events of SMQ-defined bleeding, predominantly related to the injection site.  
23 events in 9 subjects (3 subjects in each lanadelumab treatment arm) were considered related to lanadelumab 
administration (injection site bruising, injection site hemorrhage, and injection site hematoma). Eight events in 
2 placebo-treated subjects were considered related SMQ-defined events of bleeding. 
One subject diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux had mild microcytic anemia, although screening 
hemoglobin and hematocrit were below the normal range and there was no actual event of “bleeding” reported. 
There were no treatment-emergent events of SMQ-defined hypercoagulation during the treatment period. There 
was no apparent excess of treatment emergent cardiovascular adverse events in any of the DX-2930 treatment 
groups. 
Study DX-2930-04 
There were 2 subjects with 4 AESIs of disordered coagulation. All 4 events related to abnormal vaginal bleeding. 
One subject had experienced a hormonal change with oral contraceptive (norethindrone), and this product had 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 92/114 
  
  
the listed side effects of “vaginal bleeding between periods”. The other subject had a comorbid history of uterine 
adenomyosis, which was treated surgically, and resolved without incident. None of the events were related, 
serious or required discontinuation of treatment. One of the 2 subjects with AESI events of vaginal haemorrhage 
had an ADA-positive sample. The presence of ADA was not temporally related to the AESI, as the bleeding 
events were reported approximately 3 months prior to the low titer ADA-positive sample. 
Injection-site reaction (ISR) 
ISR AEs were not predefined in the protocols but were identified as AEs with the PTs starting with ‘Injection site,’ 
‘Application site,’ or ‘Administration site.’ Most ISRs were considered related to treatment. No subject treated 
with lanadelumab reported an ISR that was serious or severe. 97% of ISRs were mild intensity (3% were 
moderate), and 90% of all ISRs resolved within 1 day of onset with a median duration of 6 minutes.  
In study DX-2930-03, ISRs are much more common in the lanadelumab treated group compared to placebo 
(injection site pain 43% vs 29%, injection site erythema 9.5% vs 2.4%, injection site bruising, 7.1% vs 0%). 
In study DX-2930-04 when assessing ISRs by administration type and anatomical location, injections given in 
thigh had more ISRs per dose than those given in the arm or abdomen for self and study staff administrations 
(eg, 1.232, 0.068, and 0.233, respectively, for self-administration at home. It should be noted that the fewest 
doses were administered in the thigh. Injections given in the arm had the fewest ISRs per dose, although this 
site was not the preferred location for subjects self-administering. The majority of self-administered doses were 
given in the abdomen and the event rates of ISRs for self-administered doses versus study staff administrations 
in the abdomen were comparable. Regardless of administration type, the majority of ISRs were ≤0.5 hour 
duration, with 81% to 92% of all injection-site reaction AEs ≤1 day in duration across the 3 administration site 
categories. 
Pooled data for DX-2930-03 and DX 2930-04 (n=220) 
In terms of the number of events reported, ISRs were the most frequently reported TEAEs with 1190 AEs 
reported by 53% of lanadelumab-treated population. 
97% of ISRs were mild intensity and 90% of all ISRs resolved within 1 day of onset. Injection site reactions occur 
to a similar extent from self-administration of lanadelumab.

Safety in special populations 
Paediatric population 
Table 32 Summary of treatment emergent adverse events (excluding HAE attack reported events) 
for the pediatric population (n=23) 
The 23 subjects (≥12 to <18 years) received a total of 413 doses of lanadelumab (150 or 300 mg). 
In total, 23 paediatric subjects (aged 12 to <18 years) have participated across the 2 Phase 3 studies as of 01 
Sep 2017. 
No relevant differences between the TEAE profile for paediatric subjects and that reported for adult subjects 
were identified. The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAE was injection site pain. No paediatric 
subjects had reported investigator-confirmed AESIs in Study DX-2930-03 or until the interim analysis data cut 
of 01 Sep 2017 in Study DX-2930-04.  
One paediatric subject in the lanadelumab treatment arms in Study DX-2930-03 had 1 unrelated severe, serious 
TEAE of catheter site infection. There were no deaths or discontinuations in paediatric subjects due to TEAEs 
during the treatment period in either of the Phase 3 studies. 
Across the two Phase 3 studies 1 paediatric rollover subject was positive for ADA classified as neutralizing with 
no apparent clinical consequence. 
There were no safety signals identified in terms of clinical laboratory hematology or coagulation, laboratory test 
abnormalities, vital signs, physical examination or ECGs. No subject had ALAT, ASAT or ALP elevation in the 
range of >3 x ULN posttreatment. Liver biochemistry abnormalities were observed in 1-<3 x ULN range 
pretreatment (baseline) in both Phase 3 studies; however, no shifts in these values posttreatment were 
observed. One paediatric nonrollover subject in Study DX-2930-04 had a shift in ALP values from normal to 1-<3 
x ULN posttreatment. 
No firm conclusions can be drawn from the relatively few (n=23) patients in the adolescent population. On the 
other hand, current findings do not suggest an increased risk. 
Elderly population 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 94/114 
  
  
 
Elderly subjects (>65 to 76 years, N=10) were included in the clinical package. Among those subjects, one 
subject was not included in the PK/PD dataset due to inconsistent PK profile; and 2 subjects turned >65 years 
old in Study DX-2930-04. The results suggested no difference in the PK properties and exposure of lanadelumab 
between elderly and adult subjects. Furthermore, in the post-hoc PK analysis, no influence of age was apparent 
on the CL/F and Vc/F of lanadelumab after correcting for body weight, which supports that no difference in the 
PK properties and exposure of lanadelumab are expected for elderly subjects with HAE (>65 to 76 years) 
although no clinical data are available. 
In addition, in the pivotal DX-2930-03 study, all three dose regimens of lanadelumab were generally well 
tolerated over the 26-week treatment period. No discernible dose-response pattern or dose-dependent or 
limiting toxicity was observed for any related TEAE. Also, no relationship between the exposure of lanadelumab 
and safety endpoints of interest were identified, which includes laboratory parameters, vital signs and ECG 
assessments. Therefore, there are no safety concerns for elder HAE patients even if they have a larger variation 
of lanadelumab exposure. 
Overall no safety warningis warranted in elderly HAE patients. Long-term safety in the adult population is 
included in the Safety specification as Missing information in the RMP. 
Hepatic insufficiency 
No dedicated study has been conducted in subjects with hepatic impairment.   
In study DX-2930-03, exclusion criteria included alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >3x upper limit of normal, or 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >3x upper limit of normal, or total bilirubin >2x upper limit of normal (unless 
the bilirubin elevation is a result of Gilbert’s syndrome). 
The applicant has not found a mechanistic rationale that lanadelumab would affect liver function and there is 
generally insufficient evidence to suggest that patients with liver disease are systematically predisposed to DILI. 
Therefore it is considered that HAE patients with mild/moderate/severe hepatic insufficiency can be treated with 
lanadelumab and no safety precaution is warranted in these patients. 
Renal insufficiency 
No dedicated study has been conducted in subjects with renal impairment. 
As currently assessed in the Pharmacokinetic AR, renal impairment is not expected to affect exposure to 
lanadelumab. No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. Presented data do not suggest 
that PK/PD is different in subjects with mild–moderate renal impairment. No subject included in the Phase 3 
studies had severe renal impairment. Twelve subjects in phase 3 studies had moderate renal impairment (eGFR 
30-59 ml/min/1.73m2). 114 subjects had mild renal impairment (eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73m2) and 102 
subjects had normal kidney function (eGFR ≥90 ml/min/1.73m2). 
It is agreed that the presented safety findings, stratified for kidney function, do not imply that subjects with mild 
to moderate renal impairment are at an increased risk for ADRs.  
Pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Background 
Lanadelumab, was engineered to specifically bind and inhibit pKal without binding prekallikrein (Kenniston et al., 
2014). As a result of this specificity, lanadelumab does not completely suppress pKal activity or bradykinin 
Assessment report

Page 95/114 
  
  
 
generation. This mechanism of action of lanadelumab allows for basal level pKal activity to persist and thus is 
not expected to fully inhibit contact system activation in newborns. 
In contrast to the regulation of excess pKal activity observed in lanadelumab-treated subjects, individuals with 
homozygous deficiency in prekallikrein are completely devoid of plasma kallikrein activity (Girolami et al., 
2010). Despite lacking pKal activity, patients with prekallikrein deficiency have been described as having a 
prognosis similar to age-matched individuals and have no indication of clinically relevant adverse effects due to 
the absence of plasma kallikrein activity (Girolami et al., 2010). The benign clinical presentation of homozygous 
prekallikrein deficiency does not suggest any particular safety risks for the newborn due to a complete lack of 
pKal (Girolami et al., 2010). 
Lanadelumab does not inhibit tissue kallikrein 1 (KLK1), a kinin generating protease distinct from plasma 
kallikrein (Kenniston et al., 2014). Consequently, lanadelumab is not expected to interfere with kinin generation 
by KLK1, which is widely expressed by many tissues and supports normal kinin physiology (Campbell, 2016). 
While a physiological role for the plasma kallikrein-kinin system in newborn development has not been 
established, kinins have been implicated in the regulation of vascular tone and bradykinin levels in newborn cord 
blood have been shown to be higher than blood levels in adults (Melmon et al., 1968). It has been hypothesized 
that bradykinin may constrict smooth muscle of the ductus arteriosus after birth and reduce blood flow as it 
narrows and then completely closes (Melmon et al., 1968). However, complete bradykinin B2 receptor blockade 
did not affect the pulmonary vasodilatory response caused by oxygen in near term fetal lambs, indicating that 
bradykinin release is not critical for oxygen-mediated pulmonary vasodilation (Banerjee et al., 1994). In the 
ePPND study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys with lanadelumab, closure of the ductus arteriosus was 
considered normal for infants at or near the day of parturition.  
In experimental studies there was no treatment-related effect on pregnancy, parturition, embryo-fetal 
development, as well as survival, growth, and postnatal development of offspring evaluated for up to 3 months 
of age. 
Data from clinical trials with lanadelumab 
In the Phase 3 clinical studies with lanadelumab, 3 pregnancies were reported, as of the interim data cut date of 
01 Sep 2017, and the newborns (4, including twins) delivered to date are healthy. Since the subjects 
discontinued treatment soon after pregnancy was reported, the level of lanadelumab exposure to the fetus in 
the third trimester is minimal.  
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 96/114 
  
  
One Subject had a premature delivery of a healthy infant girl at 36 weeks of gestation. Following confirmation 
of pregnancy, lanadelumab treatment was stopped and the subject was followed up for safety to collect 
information on adverse events and concomitant medications. The subject experienced the following adverse 
events during her pregnancy: nausea associated with pregnancy, intermittent dizziness, rash, HAE attack, 
elevated blood pressure, intermittent bilateral forearm pain, and preeclampsia. The subject returned to 
treatment (300 mg every 2 weeks) on June 20, 2018.  
Another subject had a premature delivery of healthy infant boy and girl twins at 31 weeks gestation. Following 
confirmation of pregnancy, lanadelumab treatment was stopped, and the subject was followed up to collect 
safety information on adverse events and concomitant medications. The subject experienced the following 
adverse events during her pregnancy: nausea associated with pregnancy, gestational diabetes, and HAE 
attacks. The subject returned to treatment (300 mg every 2 weeks) on June 13, 2018.The 3 subjects entered 
Study DX-2930-04 as rollover subjects from Study DX-2930-03 and they all discontinued treatment with 
lanadelumab upon receipt of positive serum/urine pregnancy test. The cumulative lanadelumab exposure in the 
3 subjects before discontinuation was 2400 mg, 6150 mg, 6750 mg.  
The applicant will continue to monitor pregnancy outcomes in the ongoing long term safety study and collect 
pregnancy-related safety information through routine pharmacovigilance activities as mentioned in the RMP.  
Based on the pharmacological mode of action, lack of preclinical signal and benign course in the three 
pregnancies reported so far, inclusion of “Use in Pregnancy" as missing information is recommended. 
In conclusion, lanadelumab is recommended not to be used during pregnancy.  
Lactation 
Lanadelumab has not been studied in lactating females. It is not known whether lanadelumab is present in 
human milk; however it is known that IgGs are excreted in human milk. It is unknown if lanadelumab’s kinetic 
is similar to human IgGs and is decreasing to low concentrations soon few days after birth. 
Subjects with weight <50 kg 
Weight was shown to be a significant covariate for lanadelumab, i.e. low-weight patients are predicted to have 
a lower exposure than the average 70 kg patient.  
In total, 7 subjects <50 kg were treated with lanadelumab in the two phase 3 studies. In study DX-2930-03, two 
subjects <50 kg were treated with placebo and one subject with lanadelumab 300 mg q4w. All three subjects 
rolled over to study DX-2930-04 and were treated with lanadelumab 300 mg q2w.  
In study DX-2930-03, 2 TEAEs were reported by the lanadelumab treated subject and non by the placebo 
subjects. None of the TEAEs was considered related to treatment and none was serious or severe. Table 33 
summarises the TEAE by weight class in study DX-2930-04.

The rate of related TEAEs/ subject year was higher in the <50 kg subgroup compared to other subgroups. It is 
however noted that in the <50 kg subgroup, 3 subjects reported 67 related TEAEs, i.e. 93% of all reported 
TEAEs in this subgroup. No AESI or serious or severe AE were reported in subjects <50 kg.

n = Number of subjects experiencing the event, m = Number of events. 
In study DX-2930-04, 68/72 (94.4%) of all TEAE and 67/67 (100%) of all related TEAEs in the <50 kg subgroup 
were injection site reactions. One event of drug hypersensitivity was reported, but was not deemed as related.  
Overweight and obese subjects 
In the integrated analyses, a trend was observed in the highest weight category (≥100 kg) that the proportion 
of subjects with severe TEAEs (17% vs 12%), related severe TEAEs (4.9% vs 1.8%), and discontinuations 
(7.3% vs 2.7%) was higher than the overall lanadelumab-treated population. 
Review of overall TEAEs by system-organ- class (SOC) and PT showed that the proportion of subjects reporting 
TEAEs under the Investigations SOC was notably higher in subjects ≥100 kg (24%) compared with the overall 
lanadelumab-treated population (11%). Events of increased ALAT, increased ASAT, and increased creatine 
phosphokinase were the most frequent TEAEs in the Investigations SOC. 
According to the applicant, comorbidities in these subjects may be contributing to the observed difference in 
TEAEs reporting rather than a reflection of lanadelumab treatment. 
It is acknowledged that there was a baseline imbalance in weight and BMI in study DX-2930-03, with a higher 
proportion of heavy subjects in the lanadelumab group. Obese subjects constitute 30% of patients in study 
DX-2930-04 and safety findings indicate that overweight subjects could be more prone to experience AEs.

Immunological events 
The overall prevalence of ADAs is under 12% in lanadelumab treated subjects. Pre-existing ADA positivity is 
1.4%. None of the subjects with hypersensitivity AESIs developed ADAs. There is no hypersensitivity safety 
findings related to ADA positivity.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug interaction studies were performed in this clinical program.  
Lanadelumab is a monoclonal antibody. Interactions with other drugs are not anticipated due to the nature and 
metabolism of lanadelumab. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
DX-2930-03 
Adverse events leading to discontinuations in the study (n=3) were due to a laryngeal HAE attack in the 
lanadelumab group and HAE attack and tension headache in the placebo group.  
In DX-2930-04, discontinuations occur to the same extent in lanadelumab and placebo treated subjects in study 
DX-2930-03. In DX-2930-04, hypersensitivity reactions accounts for three out of five discontinuations due to 
adverse events. 
Overall, 8 subjects discontinued study treatment due to AEs. In 4/6 lanadelumab-treated subjects, the TEAEs 
were considered related (ISRs, hepatic disorders and hypersensitivity). 
Safety in phase 1 studies 
Study DX-2930-01, single ascending dose 
The highest tested dose was 3mg/kg. Treatment-emergent AEs were reported in 16/24 (67%) of all 
lanadelumab-treated subjects and in 6/8 (75%) of all placebo-treated subjects. Treatment-emergent AEs 
assessed by the investigator as related to investigational product were observed in 6/24 (25%) of all 
lanadelumab-treated subjects and in 4/8 (50%) of all placebo-treated subjects.  
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 99/114 
  
  
 
 
The most frequent treatment-related TEAE was headache, reported by five of lanadelumab-treated subjects and 
one of placebo-treated subjects. All reports of headaches were mild to moderate in severity and all events 
resolved.  
Two subjects reported severe treatment-related TEAEs of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevations; 1 subject in 
the 0.1 mg/kg group and 1 subject in the placebo group. Neither treatment-related, severe elevation of CPK was 
associated with any other adverse event or finding that might indicate clinical importance, such as myalgia or 
muscle weakness. In both subjects, the CPK elevations were absent or reduced at subsequent time points and 
appeared to be a sporadic event. 
Study DX-2930-02, 2 doses (30, 100, 300 or 400 mg), 14 days apart 
Treatment-emergent AEs were reported in 14/24 (58%) of all lanadelumab-treated subjects and in 10/13 
(77%) of all placebo-treated subjects. Treatment-emergent AEs assessed by the investigator as related to 
investigational product were observed in 7/24 (29%) of lanadelumab-treated subjects and in 5/13 (39%) of 
placebo-treated subjects.  
The most frequent TEAEs considered treatment-related in lanadelumab-treated subjects were injection site pain 
(25%), followed by headache (8%), and injection site erythema (4%). Other TEAEs considered 
treatment-related included vomiting, injection site edema, and night sweats, each reported in one 
lanadelumab-treated subject, and hereditary angioedema and abdominal discomfort, each reported in one 
placebo-treated subject. 
Severe TEAEs occurred in 6/24 (25%) of lanadelumab-treated subjects and in 5/13 (39%) of placebo-treated 
subjects. The most common severe TEAE was hereditary angioedema, experienced by 3 (12.5%) lanadelumab 
-treated subjects and 5 (38.5%) placebo-treated subjects. 2/24 lanadelumab-treated subjects had severe 
TEAEs considered treatment-related (severe injection site pain in one patient and worsening headache and 
nightsweats in one patient). 0/13 placebo-treated subjects had severe TEAEs considered treatment-related. 
One placebo-treated subject experienced an SAE (pneumonia). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The demographic profile of subjects included in the phase 3 trials is generally considered representative for HAE 
patients, although it is noted that overweight and obese patients might be overrepresented. It is acknowledged 
that there was a baseline imbalance in weight and BMI in study DX-2930-03, with a higher proportion of heavy 
subjects in the lanadelumab group. It is also noted that the ethnicity of the safety population is almost 
exclusively white. No firm conclusions can be drawn from the relatively few patients in the adolescent (n=23, 
10%) or elderly population (>65 years) (n=10, 4.5%). On the other hand, current findings do not suggest an 
increased risk. 
Overall in the placebo controlled study DX-2930-03, there were more TEAEs in the lanadelumab treated group 
compared to placebo, 91% vs 76%, more related TEAEs 60% vs 34% and more serious TEAEs 5% vs 0%. 
Numerically there is a trend that the highest dose group, 300 mg q2 wks, had more TEAEs and more related 
TEAEs compared to the other lanadelumab groups. 
No deaths and no related serious TEAEs were reported during the studies.  
Among the most common adverse events reported were viral respiratory upper tract infections; these adverse 
events were equally common in both groups. Headache was also commonly reported in both groups.  
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 100/114 
  
  
In study DX-2930-03, related TEAEs are dominated by injection site reactions in the lanadelumab group, 
injection site pain 42% injection site erythema 9.5%, injection site bruising, 6%. ISR were also common in the 
ongoing open-label study (DX-2930-04). In the pooled phase 3 lanadelumab treated population (n=220), 15 
SAEs were reported in 11 subjects. There are small numbers in each group and no specific pattern can be found. 
It is noted that none of the SAEs was considered related to the study treatment.  
Since lanadelumab is intended for long-term use, it is of interest to know if the frequency of AEs changes over 
time. No placebo-controlled data is available after 6 months of treatment but open label extension study is 
ongoing. An updated summary of the safety profile of lanadelumab based on the 120 days safety update data 
cut on 01 Jan 2018 (4 months of additional information available from the ongoing Study DX-2930-04 since the 
initial filing) is provided and supports the safety conclusions drawn from the data in the original submission. 
More specifically, a comparison of study DX-2930-03 and DX-2930-04 regarding incidence rates for the pooled 
lanadelumab treated population suggests that the incidence rates for TEAEs are not increasing over time. 
Moreover, no treatment-related SAEs or deaths were reported and no additional related severe TEAEs have been 
reported since the initial submission. There was no increase in SAEs or AESIs with longer term exposure to 
lanadelumab.  
Common adverse events in the overall lanadelumab treated group are consistently overlapping between study 
DX-2930-03 and study DX-2930-04, with the exception of injection site pain, which tend to occur more often in 
the placebo controlled study. The rates of discontinuations are 6/84 in study DX-2930-03 compared to 7/76 in 
study DX-2930-04.  AE reported as a reason for discontinuation concerns one patient in each study. 
Altogether, data do not suggest that common adverse events or discontinuations would increase over time (and 
therefore be more common in the follow-up study). 
Hypersensitivity reactions are recorded in the lanadelumab treated population, n=5 in the pivotal study. In 
study DX-2930-04, hypersensitivity reactions accounts for three out of five discontinuations due to adverse 
events. It is noted that there are so far no anaphylactic reactions reported in the study population.  
Lanadelumab is a monoclonal antibody. Interactions with other drugs are not anticipated due to the nature and 
metabolism of lanadelumab. The overall prevalence of ADAs is under 12% in lanadelumab treated subjects. 
Pre-existing ADA positivity is 1.4%. There is no hypersensitivity safety findings related to ADA positivity. 
There is a mechanistic plausibility for lanadelumab to increase aPTT. In study DX-2930-03, aPTT was balanced 
between groups at baseline and increases during the study are in line with what can be predicted from primary 
pharmacology. The increase in aPTT seems dose-dependent and changes appear from the first measurement 
after study start, i.e. day 28. These changes are then maintained throughout the study period up to day 182. 
Changes are largest in the 300 mg q2wks group and they are in the range of 6–8 sec from baseline value of 28 
sec (<29% increase). Increases in aPTT are according to the applicant small and 83/84 lanadelumab treated 
subjects had aPTT <1.5 x ULN. In DX-2930-04 aPTT was monitored and the change from baseline was increased 
to a similar extent, at most 5.71 seconds at day 224 on group level. For the individual subject with the largest 
increase, aPTT was increased 86.9 s. The actual value was 120.5 s at day 56 during the dose and wait period and 
confounded by concomitant heparin use.  
No bleeding events were observed in association with a prolonged aPTT, and no effects on PT, INR were 
observed in subjects treated with lanadelumab. It is therefore concluded that increases in aPTT are not 
considered related to an increased risk of bleeding and that the observed aPTT prolongations are therefore not 
clinically relevant. Overall, presented findings are supportive of the view that increased aPTT levels can be 
considered as laboratory finding consistent with the mechanism of action.

In the placebo controlled study DX-2930-03 four lanadelumab treated subjects and zero placebo treated 
subjects had elevated ALAT >3X ULN during the study. One patient discontinued lanadelumab treatment due to 
elevated transaminases and the transaminases fell after treatment discontinuation, which could be interpreted 
as a positive dechallenge. In the three patients with elevated ALAT >3X ULN who continued study DX-2930-03, 
ASAT/ALAT elevations were asymptomatic and not considered clinically significant. It is concurred that 2/4 
patients had pre-existing liver disease (hepatic steatosis). However, ALAT levels are markedly higher at baseline 
in the lanadelumab 300 mg every 2 weeks treated group and also higher in the overall lanadelumab treated 
groups. ALAT levels do not increase in lanadelumab treated groups during the 6-month study period. Based on 
the presented findings it is considered appropriate to include ASAT/ALAT elevations as possible adverse 
reactions to lanadelumab treatment. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that individuals with chronic liver 
disease and cirrhosis are at increased risk of drug induced liver injury while on lanadelumab. Patients with AT 
elevations can thus be given lanadelumab.  
In PK analyses, weight was shown to be a significant covariate for lanadelumab, i.e. low-weight patients are 
predicted to have a higher exposure than the average 70 kg patient. In total, seven subjects <50 kg were 
treated with lanadelumab in the two phase 3 studies; one in DX-2930-03 and seven in DX-2930-04 (the subject 
in DX-2930-03 was treated also in DX-2930-04). 
In study DX-2930-03, two TEAEs were reported by the single lanadelumab treated subject and non by the two 
placebo treated subjects. None of the TEAEs was considered related to treatment and none was serious or 
severe. 
In study DX-2930-04, the rate of related TEAEs/ subject year was higher in the <50 kg subgroup compared to 
other subgroups. It is however noted that in the <50 kg subgroup, 3/7 subjects reported 67 related TEAEs, i.e. 
93% of all reported TEAEs in this subgroup. No AESI or serious or severe AE were reported in subjects <50 kg.  
In study DX-2930-04, 68/72 (94.4%) of all TEAE and 67/67 (100%) of all related TEAEs in the <50 kg subgroup 
were injection site reactions. One event of drug hypersensitivity was reported, but was not deemed as related. 
Current findings do not suggest any specific safety issues in this population. Injections site reactions are not 
presumed to be secondary to a high systemic exposure, however a lower lanadelumab dose in subjects <50 kg 
is introduced in the SmPC due to the higher exposure in these patients. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Safety concerns for lanadelumab include mainly injection site reaction (transient, mostly of mild intensity). 
However, there were also episodes of hypersensitivity (some local, other more systemic), which could be 
expected for a monoclonal antibody. There is a mechanistic plausibility for lanadelumab to increase aPTT. The 
increase in aPTT seems dose-dependent do not seem to increase after the first month. No bleeding events were 
observed in association with a prolonged aPTT, and no effects on PT, INR were observed in subjects treated with 
lanadelumab. It is therefore concluded that increases in aPTT are not considered related to an increased risk of 
bleeding and that the observed aPTT prolongations are therefore not clinically relevant. 
Liver enzyme elevations were observed in the phase 3 studies and patients with elevated transaminases were 
excluded at study start. In the pivotal study, however, no changes were observed at the group level. It is 
nevertheless agreed that liver toxicity is included as an important potential risk in the RMP.  
Long term safety data remain limited and will be provided in the post authorisation setting.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.5 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 23 August 2018. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that lanadelumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers lanadelumab to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, TAKHZYRO (lanadelumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as 
• 
• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal 
product authorised in the EU; 
It is a biological product that is not covered by the previous category and authorised after 1 January 
2011; 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
HAE is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the gene coding for C1 esterase inhibitor 
(C1-INH). Deficiency of C1-INH is believed to result in the loss of inhibition of plasma kallikrein activity leading 
to increased bradykinin release.  
HAE is characterized by unpredictable recurrent episodes of debilitating subcutaneous or submucosal oedema 
typically affecting the skin, upper airway, and gastrointestinal tract. The attacks are often painful. The condition 
has a large negative impact on both daily life and quality of life for the patients. Moreover, approximately 50% 
of all patients with HAE will experience a potentially life-threatening laryngeal attack in their lifetime (Bork et al., 
2006). 
Lanadelumab is a recombinant fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody inhibitor of active plasma kallikrein. The 
aim of the treatment is to prevent HAE attacks by inhibiting plasma kallikrein, thereby preventing the release of 
bradykinin from HMWK (high molecular weight kininogen). Lanadelumab is not intended for acute treatment of 
HAE attacks. 
Lanadelumab is administered subcutaneously. Orphan designation has been granted for lanadelumab in the 
treatment of HAE.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
For prevention of HAE attacks, current treatment guidelines recommend C1-INH replacement therapy or 
attenuated androgens as standard of care. Tranexamic acid may also be tried.  
For the time being, Cinryze (plasma derived C1-INH concentrate) is the only centrally approved medicinal 
product in the EU. Cinryze is administered intravenously every 3-5 days. This is cumbersome for the patient and 
also for the health care, as intravenous injections/infusions are generally not administered as self-treatment. 
While existing preventive therapy with C1-INH ameliorates the number and severity of attacks, some patients 
still experience breakthrough attacks, which may be life-threatening as described above. There is therefore a 
medical need for alternative therapies. Lanadelumab provides an alternative for patient care that is 
administered via SC injection with a dose regimen of administration every 2 weeks.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study DX-2930-03 was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled HAE prevention 
study with 26 weeks treatment duration in subjects ≥ 12 years with HAE type I or type II and with a baseline 
HAE-attack rate of at least 1 per 4 weeks during the run-in period. The total number of participants was 125 
(placebo 41; lanadelumab 84). Three lanadelumab dosing regimens were compared (150 mg q4wks, 300 mg 
q4wks and 300 mg q2wks). The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of lanadelumab in preventing 
HAE attacks. 
The ongoing open-label extension study DX-2930-04 enrolled 212 subjects; 109 “rollovers” from study 
DX-2930-03 and 103 “non-rollovers” (whereof 19 subjects from study DX-2930-02). All subjects received 
lanadelumab 300 mg q2wks. Interim analyses from the extension study are provided as supporting data in the 
MAA. 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 107/114 
  
  
The clinical development program consisted also of a “proof-of-concept”, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose-finding study DX-2930-02 enrolling in total 37 subjects (13 
placebo, 24 lanadelumab). The lanadelumab doses used were 30 mg, 100 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The DX-2930-03 pivotal study met the primary and the three secondary efficacy endpoints for all lanadelumab 
treatment arms. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the number of investigator confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment 
period (Day 0 through Day 182). 
Poisson regression of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period (D 0 to D 182) by 
treatment group- (ITT Population) shows reductions in the least squares mean HAE attack rate (reduction 
range: 73 % to 87 %; adjusted p<0.001) in all lanadelumab treatment arms compared to placebo: -75.6 (-84.6, 
-61.2) in the 150 mg q4wks arm, -73.3 (-82.4, -59.5) in the 300 mg q4wks arm, and -86.9 (-92.8, -76.2) in the 
300 mg q2wks arm. 
The least squares mean HAE attack rate (95% CI of rate [attacks/4 weeks]) was 0.48 (95% CI: 0.31, 0.74) in 
the 150 mg q4wks arm, 0.53 (0.36, 0.77) in the 300 mg q4wks arm, and 0.26 (0.14, 0.46) in the 300 mg q2wks 
arm, compared to 1.97 (1.64, 2.36) in the placebo arm. This corresponds to a reduction in the least squares 
mean investigator-confirmed HAE attack rate compared to placebo of 75.6%, 73.3%, and 86.9% respectively 
(adjusted p<0.001). 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were :  
- the number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks requiring acute treatment during the treatment period (Day 
0 through Day 182). 
The estimated least squares mean HAE attack rate (95% CI: range) was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.54) in the 150 
mg q4wks arm, 0.42 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.65) in the 300 mg q4wks arm, and 0.21 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.40) in the 300 
mg q2wks arm, compared to 1.64 (95% CI: 1.34, 2.00) in the placebo arm.  
- the number of moderate or severe investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the treatment period (Day 0 
through Day 182). 
The least squares mean HAE attack rate (95% CI, range) was 0.36 (0.22, 0.58) in 150 mg q4wks arm, 0.32 
(95% CI: 0.20, 0.53) in 300 mg q4wks arm, 0.20 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.39) in 300 mg q2wks arm relative to 1.22 
(95% CI: 0.97, 1.52) in the placebo arm.  
- the number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks occurring on Day 14 after administration of study drug 
through Day 182. 
The least squares mean HAE attack rate (95% CI: range) was 0.44 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.70) in the 150 mg q4wks 
arm, 0.49 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.73) in the 300 mg q4wks arm, 0.22 (95% CI: 0.12, 0.41) in the 300 mg q2wks arm, 
relative to 1.99 (95% CI: 1.65, 2.39) in the placebo arm. 
Furthermore, the preliminary results of study DX-2930-04 indicate that for subjects previously treated with 
lanadelumab in study DX-2930-03, the lanadelumab effect on HAE attack rate is maintained.  
Subjects <18 years 
8.0% of the subjects in the pivotal study were adolescents aged ≥12 to <18 years; however, the absolute 
number of subjects was low (N = 10; placebo 4, lanadelumab 6). In the extension study DX-2930-04, 21 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 108/114 
  
  
subjects ≥12 to <18 years (9.9% of study population) were treated with lanadelumab, including 8 rollovers from 
DX-2930-03. In total, 23 unique subjects <18 years were treated with lanadelumab in the phase 3 studies.  
In study DX-2930-03, the reduction in mean HAE attack rate was numerically larger in the lanadelumab 
treatment arms (0.30 [SD=0.26] and 0.31 [0.433] for 300 mg q4wks and 300 mg q2wks, respectively) 
compared to placebo (0.92 [0.99]); however, possibly due to low number of subjects, the difference was not 
statistically significant. 
In study DX-2930-04, the mean HAE attack rate was 0.18 attacks/months in subjects <18 years compared to 
0.30 attacks/month in the entire population (rollovers and non-rollovers); however, the baseline attack rate was 
also lower among adolescents than in the entire population (1.6 vs 3.0 attacks/month). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In all clinical studies, only subjects with HAE type I or II were included. Those conditions are characterised by 
either a deficiency or a dysfunction of C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), leading to dysregulation of plasma 
kallikrein activity. “HAE with normal C1-INH activity”, i.e. HAE other than HAE1 or HAE2, is a heterogeneous 
entity comprising of e.g. HAE caused by mutations in the coagulation factor XII (F12) gene, the plasminogen 
(PLG) gene, or the angiopoietin-1 gene (ANGPT1). In many cases the aetiology is unknown.  
The Applicant has presented supporting data from the literature that subjects with F12-HAE and PLG-HAE, may 
have an increased FXII activation, implicating a role for the kallikrein-kinin system in angioedema formation also 
in this population.”  
The CHMP agreed to recommend the 300 mg q2wks dosage as starting dose, based on the magnitude of the 
effect, which is numerically larger than that of the other two dosing regimens, although the treatment arms were 
not formerly compared with one another. Furthermore, PK/PD considerations seem to favor q2w administration 
(e.g. exposure-response analysis, achievement of steady state concentrations).  
In total, only 23 unique subjects <18 years were exposed to lanadelumab in the development program. In the 
population pharmacokinetic modelling, an approximately 37% higher exposure in adolescents than adults was 
predicted. However, the AUC range was quite large; 121- 832 ug*d/ml in adults and 321-1050 ug*d/ml in 
adolescents. The difference in exposure is presumed to be secondary to the differences in mean weight between 
the populations. Given the broad ranges of exposure in both adults and adolescents, it is considered that the 
increased exposure in adolescents would not exert any major impact on efficacy and safety.  
Pharmacokinetic analyses suggest a lower exposure in subjects with higher body weight, raising the possibility 
that the proposed dosing regimen would not be effective in heavy subjects. However data from ad-hoc subgroup 
analysis based on weight showed that 300 mg Q2W showed a favourable effect on HAE attack rates. This was 
confirmed in the DX 2930-04 study. Using PK/PD data, the 300 mg q2wks dosing was associated with 
lanadelumab exposure approximate or above the IC90 of PD and EAUC90 for efficacy in patients across a large 
range of body weight (46.8-150 kg). This is adequately addressed in the posology section of the SmPC.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Safety data are generated from the placebo-controlled pivotal 6-month study DX-2930-03, which included 125 
subjects (84 active, 41 placebo). The open-label study DX-2930-04 contributes with long-time data (up to 12 
months) in 75 subjects. Overall in the pivotal study, there were more TEAEs in the lanadelumab treated group 
compared to placebo, 91% vs 76%, more related TEAEs 60% vs 34% and more serious TEAEs 5% vs 0%. 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 109/114 
  
  
 
Numerically there is a trend that the highest dose group, 300 mg q2 wks, had more TEAEs and more related 
TEAEs compared to the other lanadelumab groups. Related TEAEs are dominated by injection site reactions in 
the lanadelumab group; injection site pain 42%, injection site erythema 9.5%, injection site bruising 6%. 
Overall pooled data for DX-2930-03 and DX 2930-04 (n=220) shows that Injection Site Reactions were the most 
frequently reported TEAEs (53% of lanadelumab-treated population). 
Hypersensitivity reactions are recorded in the lanadelumab treated population, n=5 in the pivotal study and its 
extension. In study DX-2930-04, hypersensitivity reactions accounts for 3/5 discontinuations due to adverse 
events.  
There was a dose-dependent increase in aPTT and changes appear from the first measurement after study start, 
i.e. day 28. These changes were maintained throughout the study period up to day 182. Changes in the 300 mg 
q2wks group were in the range of 6–8 sec from baseline value of 28 sec (<29% increase). 83/84 lanadelumab 
treated subjects had aPTT <1.5 x ULN. In DX-2930-04 aPTT was monitored and the change from baseline was 
increased to a similar extent, at most 5.71 seconds at day 224 on group level. No bleeding events were observed 
in association with a prolonged aPTT, and no effects on PT, INR were observed in subjects treated with 
lanadelumab.  
Pooled phase 3 safety data shows that elevated ALAT >3X ULN (regardless of baseline - with up to 3X allowed) 
was reported in 10 subjects. Subjects with elevations were asymptomatic, with no associated 
hyperbilirubinemia (no Hy's Law cases) or elevated alkaline phosphatase and 5/10 returned to baseline while 
lanadelumab was continued. No antidrug antibody formation was recorded for the 10 subjects. It is considered 
unknown whether lanadelumab could potentially be linked with more pronounced liver toxicity in a larger 
treatment population. Therefore this is a safety concern and included in the RMP as an important potential risk.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Since lanadelumab is intended for long-term use, it is of interest to know if the frequency of AEs changes over 
time. No placebo-controlled data is available after 6 months of treatment but open label extension study is 
ongoing.  A comparison of study DX-2930-03 and DX-2930-04 regarding incidence rates for the pooled 
lanadelumab treated population suggests that the incidence rates for TEAEs are not increasing over time.  
However the long term safety data remain limited at present and the safety profile will be monitored in the post 
marketing setting as stated in the RMP.  
No firm conclusions can be drawn from the relatively few patients in the adolescent n=23 (10%) or elderly 
population (>65 years) n=10 (4.5%). On the other hand, current findings do not suggest an increased risk. 
Lanadelumab is not intended for acute treatment of HAE attacks. Therefore, during the study rescue medication 
were allowed in the event of an HAE attack. Drug interactions associated with use of such HAE co-medications 
have not been evaluated. Lanadelumab is a monoclonal antibody and pharmacokinetic interactions with other 
drugs are not anticipated but pharmacodynamics interactions could theoretically be a concern. This will be 
addressed in the post authorisation setting. 
In PK analyses, weight was shown to be a significant covariate for lanadelumab, i.e. low-weight patients are 
predicted to have a higher exposure than the average 70 kg patient. In total, 7 subjects <50 kg were treated 
with lanadelumab in the two phase 3 studies. In study DX-2930-04, the rate of related TEAEs/ subject year was 
higher in the <50 kg subgroup compared to other subgroups. (representing 93% of all reported TEAEs). All 
related TEAEs in the <50 kg subgroup were injection site reactions. Current findings do not suggest any specific 
safety issues in this population. Injections site reactions are not presumed to be secondary to a high systemic 
exposure, therefore a lower lanadelumab dose in subjects <50 kg is not considered necessary. However in

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
As HAE attacks are unpredictable, associated with considerable discomfort for the patient and potentially lethal, 
prevention of such attacks is considered to be of high clinical relevance. Lanadelumab has a different mode of 
action from alternative existing treatments. In international guidelines, C1-INH replacement therapy is 
recommended as first line treatment. In the EU, the only centrally approved C1-INH replacement therapy, 
Cinryze, is administered intravenously every 3-5 days. In comparison, lanadelumab which is administered 
subcutaneously every 2-4 weeks offers a significant advantage even considering the recently approved product 
(Berinert) since subcutaneous injections are administered more frequently. The efficacy endpoints reflect not 
only the total HAE attack rate and severity during the treatment period, but also other measures of HAE attack 
prevention, e.g. time to first HAE attack and quality of life. Consistent through the efficacy analyses, all 
lanadelumab treatment arms were superior to placebo. 
In an ad hoc analysis with pooled data from all three lanadelumab treatment arms compared to placebo, the 
result of all subgroups (e.g. age, weight, baseline HAE attack rate) were consistent with those of the entire 
population. 
Pharmacokinetic analyses suggest a lower exposure in subjects with higher body weight as well as a higher 
exposure in subjects with low weight. Based on the safety data for subjects <50 kg and the relatively benign 
safety profile of lanadelumab in general and on the predicted effect of lanadelumab up to 150 kg, the benefit/risk 
ratio for a flat dose (300 mg q2w) is considered positive. 
Lanadelumab is injected subcutaneously and injection site reactions are the most common related adverse 
events. So far there are no anaphylactic reactions reported, although such reactions could be expected to occur 
in a larger population. Lanadelumab is intended for long-term treatment of HAE and the data base is relatively 
small, only approximately 100 patients treated for more than one year. Therefore the overall amount of long 
term safety data is still sparse and will be collected through the post marketing setting in the ongoing 
DX-2930-04 study. 
Overall, the safety profile is considered to be favourable considering the clinical benefits shown. However, 
enzyme elevations do occur during lanadelumab treatment and it such transaminase elevations could currently 
be regarded as idiosyncratic. It is still considered unknown whether lanadelumab could potentially be linked with 
more pronounced liver toxicity in a larger treatment population. This is addressed in the SmPC section 4.8 in and 
RMP as liver toxicity is considered an important potential risk. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit of the product has been adequately shown for prevention of HAE attacks i.e. a condition with high 
mortality in spite of existing available products . The assessment of the safety profile is based on limited data but 
is considered acceptable. Identified and potential safety issues are considered to be clearly outweighed by 
convincing efficacy data.  
The indication “[Lanadelumab] is indicated for routine prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema 
(HAE) in patients aged 12 years and older” is considered justified. 
Assessment report  
EMA/794314/2018 
Page 112/114 
  
  
The wording “routine prevention” indicates that lanadelumab is intended for continuous treatment as opposed to 
e.g. short term prevention at surgery. This is an established wording within this therapeutic field. 
In all clinical studies, only subjects with HAE type I or II were included. However, literature support that the 
kallikrein-kinin system is also involved in angioedema formation in HAE of other types than HAE type I or II, 
supporting a broad HAE indication. Therefore extrapolation to other subtypes is acceptable by CHMP. 
Additionally, it is clearly stated in section 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC that only subjects with HAE type I and II were 
included in the studies. 
Data in adolescents is still limited but indicates similar efficacy and safety profile than in adults. 
A history of recurrent attacks was a prerequisite for inclusion in all three studies. The treatment period attack 
rate was strongly influenced by the baseline attack rate, however, in all subgroups, the decrease in HAE attack 
rate was larger in the lanadelumab treatment arms compared to placebo. However, the benefit/risk ratio for 
subjects having had only one single attack cannot be considered positive. This is reflected in section 4.1 of the 
SmPC. 
HAE is a genetic disease and would be an interesting treatment option also in younger children. Currently the 
<12 years old population has not been studied, although the applicant is planning for a paediatric study which 
addresses this important medical need.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance  
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of TAKHZYRO is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that TAKHZYRO is not similar to Firazyr within the meaning of Article 
3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of TAKHZYRO is favourable in the following indication: 
Takhzyro is indicated for routine prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in patients 
aged 12 years and older.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

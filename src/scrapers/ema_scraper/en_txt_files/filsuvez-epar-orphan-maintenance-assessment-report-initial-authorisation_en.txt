procedure) 
2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2011 was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
epidermolysis bullosa (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to be affecting less 
than 0.5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, at the time the application was made; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening, in particular due to severe generalised 
blistering and wounds with a risk of skin cancer development, resulting in poor quality of life and 
shortened life expectancy; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment that has been authorised in the European Union for 
patients affected by the condition. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The designated orphan condition is treatment of epidermolysis bullosa (EB) and is still acceptable as an 
orphan condition. The therapeutic indication is treatment of partial thickness wounds associated with 
dystrophic and junctional epidermolysis bullosa in patients 6 months and older. Dystrophic and 
junctional EB are two severe sub-forms of EB and are considered to be fully covered by the orphan 
condition.  
EB is a heterogeneous group of genetic skin fragility disorders characterized by blistering of the skin in 
response to minor trauma or friction. EB is caused by mutations in one of at least 14 genes encoding 
anchoring proteins of the dermo-epidermal junction. EB is divided into four main categories: EB 
simplex, junctional EB, dystrophic EB, and Kindler syndrome, each comprising different subtypes. A 
common symptom for all EB subtypes is trauma-induced skin blistering and painful wounds.  
EB simplex (EBS) is the most common subtype of EB causing mild to moderate disease. Junctional EB 
(JEB) is less frequent and has a broad spectrum of severity from the lethal form of JEB Herlitz type to 
very mild forms often diagnosed later in life. The majority of patients encountered in specialized 
centres suffer from dystrophic EB (DEB). Dominant and recessive DEB forms cause moderate to severe 
skin fragility and scarring. Severely affected patients suffer from widespread blistering and painful 
wounds causing multiple secondary medical problems which often lead to physical impairment.

Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
One of the most significant problems in EB is the lifelong presence of skin blistering and partial-
thickness wounds that result in pruritus, pain, scarring, deformity, loss of function, and immobility as 
well as a high risk of complications, such as infection. Patients with EB take care to minimize new 
wounds; however, this is particularly difficult for young children as minor trauma or friction results in 
partial-thickness wounds. In addition, there is an increased incidence of aggressive cutaneous SCC at a 
younger age than in the general population. In patients with generalized severe recessive DEB (RDEB), 
squamous cell carcinoma occurs in approximately 80% of patients by their mid-40s and can occur as 
early as adolescence.  
Therefore, the condition is considered to be chronically debilitating and life-threatening due to blister 
formation in response to minor friction or trauma, leading to the development of multiple complications 
including life-threatening infections, failure to thrive, and predisposition to the development of 
squamous cell carcinoma. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
To evaluate the epidemiology of EB in the Community a detailed Medline search was performed 
using the search terms “epidermolysis bullosa” and “prevalence OR incidence OR epidemiology”. 
In addition, references cited in the publications identified above were hand searched and evaluated. 
An overview of studies evaluating the prevalence of EB in the EU is presented in Table 1. The 
prevalence in these studies is in the range of 0.04 to 0.61 per 10,000. Most studies report a 
prevalence in the range of 0.1-0.2 per 10,000.

* Country population number was not published, and this value was taken from Eurostat 
(https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat) 
In one study from Spain only DEB was evaluated [Hernandez-Martin et al., 2013], the subform of 
EB that represented the vast majority in the study population of BEB-13. Based on 152 patients a 
prevalence of DEB of 0.06 per 10,000 was reported. Since it has been reported that approximately 
40% of all EB patients belong to this form [Bruckner-Trudermann, 2010] it can be estimated that 
the prevalence of EB in Spain is 0.15 per 10,000 which is well in alignment with the information 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

presented in the table above. 
The figures in Table 1 do not indicate any temporal trend in the epidemiology which is plausible in 
the light of the genetic nature of the disease. Hence, it appears safe to conclude that these figures 
are relevant for a current estimate of the prevalence of EB. In a conservative approach the highest 
figure reported (0.61 per 10,000) is used for this prevalence estimation even though the median 
figure of 0.15 per 10,000 appears more realistic. This approach most likely results in an 
overestimation of the actual prevalence of EB in the EU. 
Based on the information presented above, the prevalence of EB is not more than 0.6 per 10,000 
in the Community which is well below the orphan threshold of 5 in 10,000. It is therefore 
concluded that EB fulfils the epidemiological criterion of an orphan disease in the EU. 
It is noted that the latest agreed (initial) orphan designation for this condition from October 2020 
(EMA/OD/0000035451) states a slightly higher prevalence estimate of approximately 0.8 in 10,000 
persons in the European Union. This estimate was based on the then highest prevalence reported in 
the article by Mellerio (Mellerio, 2010). However, this estimate is based on a study from the UK and 
as the UK is no longer a member of the EU, the sponsor has not included this reference in their 
prevalence calculation. 
Considering the above, the sponsor’s proposed estimate of approximately 0.6 in 10,000 persons in 
the European Union is considered to be acceptable and sufficiently conservative. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
No curative treatment for any sub-type of EB exists and no medicinal product is approved in the EU for 
this indication.  
Supportive symptomatic treatment consists mainly of minimizing risk of blister formation, wound 
management, pain management and occasionally surgical interventions to treat severe symptoms or 
disease-associated complications. 
Significant benefit 
Not applicable.

4.  COMP position adopted on 26 April 2022 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of epidermolysis bullosa (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated 
to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.6 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening due to blister formation following minor 
friction or trauma, leading to the development of multiple complications including life-threatening 
infections, failure to thrive, and predisposition to the development of squamous cell carcinoma; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory method for the treatment of epidermolysis bullosa that has 
been authorised in the European Union for patients affected by the condition.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Filsuvez, dry extract from birch 
bark (DER 5-10 : 1), extraction solvent n-heptane 95% (w/w), for treatment of epidermolysis bullosa 
(EU/3/10/845) is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

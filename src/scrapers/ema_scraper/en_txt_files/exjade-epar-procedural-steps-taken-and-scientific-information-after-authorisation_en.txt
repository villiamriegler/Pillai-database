C.I.13: Submission of the final report from the 
Calypso study (CICL670F2202) listed as a category 3 
study in the RMP. This is a randomized, open-label, 
multicenter, two arm, Phase II study to evaluate 
treatment compliance, efficacy and safety of 
deferasirox (granules) in pediatric patients with iron 
overload. The RMP version 20.0 has also been 
submitted. 
C.I.11.b: Submission of an updated RMP version 
20.0 which the following changes: to remove the risk 
of 'medication error' from the Exjade RMP and to 
remove the information related to the 
discontinuation of Exjade Dispersible Tablets in the 
EU. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
evaluate the safety of deferasirox (DFX) granules versus 
deferasirox dispersible tablets (DTs) in paediatric patients 
with iron overload. 
Updated PK information of Study F2202 indicated no 
significant difference in PKs characteristics in the paediatric 
target patients. the safety profile of deferasirox 
administered as DT or as granules was similar, and 
consistent with the known safety profile of deferasirox.  
Section 4.2 of the SmPC and section 3 of the PL were 
updated to highlight that a 30% dose reduction is needed 
in case of a switch between DT formulation and 
FCT/granules formulations.  
The EURD list is updated to include all generic marketing 
authorisation holders in the next PSURs.

Annex II 
CICL670F2201: a post-authorisation pharmacovigilance 
ICL670F2201, a randomized, open-label, multi-
center, two-arm phase II study to evaluate the 
safety of deferasirox film-coated tablets (FCT) 
formulation and deferasirox dispersible tablet (DT) 
formulation in patients with transfusion dependent 
thalassemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) at 
very low, low or intermediate risk requiring chelation 
phase II study to confirm the clinical safety results of the 
new film-coated tablets (FCT) formulation, requested as 
part of the line extension procedure 
EMEA/H/C/000670/X/43. Overall although the data remains 
limited, no apparent new safety signal has been identified 
from the study results.  A summary of the main study 
results have been included in section 5.1

opportunity to update Annex II with the fulfilment of 
the obligation. The Risk Management Plan (RMP, 
v.14) is updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
‘Pharmacodynamic properties’ of the SmPC as follows: In a 
study to assess the safety of deferasirox film-coated and 
dispersible tablets, 173 adult and paediatric patients with 
transfusion dependent thalassaemia or myelodysplastic 
syndrome were treated for 24 weeks. A comparable safety 
profile for film-coated and dispersible tablets was observed.  
In addition, in section 4.4 ‘Special warnings and 
precautions’ of the SmPC, in the existing warning on renal 
function, it has been clarified that the recommendations on 
renal function monitoring also apply in case of switch of 
formulation (from dispersible to film-coated tablets). Finally 
the summary of the main study results from study A2411 
included in the Paediatric Investigation Plan have been 
moved from section 4.8 ‘Undesirable effects’ to section 5.1 
‘Pharmacodynamic properties’ of the SmPC at the CHMP’s

hepatic function. The average Cmax of deferasirox in 
subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment was 
increased by 22%. Exposure was increased 2.8-fold in one 
subject with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class 
C). 
Therefore, EXJADE is not recommended in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). In 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
Class B), the dose should be considerably reduced followed 
by progressive increase up to a limit of 50% (see sections 
4.4 and 5.2), and EXJADE must be used with caution in 
such patients. Hepatic function in all patients should be 
monitored before treatment, every 2 weeks during the first

SmPC, Annex 
Based upon the data that have become available since the 
II and PL 
granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP 
considers that the benefit-risk balance of Exjade remains 
positive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely 
monitored for the following reasons: 
Renal toxicity is a particular safety issue which could 
impact on the benefit-risk balance of Exjade. This is an 
important identified risk in the RMP (serum creatinine 
increased, ARF, renal tubulopathy), which should continue 
to be closely monitored.  
The CHMP decided that the MAH should continue to submit 
yearly PSURs. 
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Exjade, which 
requires the submission of yearly PSURs, the CHMP 
concluded that the MAH should submit one additional

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
(deferasirox) on pharmacokinetics of theophylline in 
healthy volunteers. 
In this healthy volunteer study, the concomitant 
administration of Exjade as a CYP1A2 inhibitor (repeated 
dose of 30 mg/kg/day) and the CYP1A2 substrate 
theophylline (single dose of 120 mg) resulted in an 
increase of theophylline AUC by 84% (90% CI: 73% to 
95%). The single dose Cmax was not affected, but an 
increase of theophylline Cmax is expected to occur with 
chronic dosing. Therefore, the concomitant use of Exjade 
with theophylline is not recommended. If Exjade and 
theophylline are used concomitantly, monitoring of 
theophylline concentration and theophylline dose reduction 
should be considered. An interaction between Exjade and 
other CYP1A2 substrates cannot be excluded. For 
substances that are predominantly metabolised by CYP1A2 
and that have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. clozapine,

The CHMP agreed to update the SPC sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 
Package Leaflet 
and 5.2 following safety information resulting from PSURs 6 
and 7 and from supportive safety analyses.  
The following sections of the SPC are amended in this 
application : 
- addition of precautionary statement about higher 
frequency of adverse drug reactions in elderly patients and 
about the occurrence of renal tubulopathy in young 
thalassemia patients with low serum ferritin levels (section 
Page 29/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.4 and 4.2)  
-clarification of monitoring requirements for hepatic 
function (section 4.2) 
- addition of warning for patients with advanced 
malignancies and limited life expectancy (section 4.4) 
- addition of warning on rare reports of fatal 
gastrointestinal haemorrhages, especially in elderly 
patients who had advanced haematologic malignancies 
and/or low platelet counts, and caution in patients with low 
platelet counts (section 4.4) 
- addition of information on a longer observation period for 
the absence of effects on paediatric growth and 
development  (section 4.4) 
- addition of erythema multiforme and alopecia to section 
4.8  
- addition of information on the degree of enterohepatic 
recycling, as determined in a recent study with 
cholestyramine (section 5.2) 
The Package Leaflet is also amended consequently.  
Furthermore, minor editorial changes were applied and the 
list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet has been 
updated for Estonia, Finland, Latvia and Slovenia.

recommended dose range for maintenance therapy to a 
maximum of 40 mg/kg/day for patients not adequately 
controlled with doses of 30 mg/kg.  
However it is highlighted that the current efficacy and 
safety data are limited and if very poor control is achieved 
at doses up to 30 mg/kg, a further increase to 40mg/kg 
Page 30/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
may not achieve satisfactory control, alternative treatment 
options may be considered.  
Doses above 40 mg/kg are not recommended because 
there is only limited experience with doses above this level. 
Amendment of section 4.4 of the SPC to introduce a 
warning that increased risk of renal adverse events with 
EXJADE doses above 30 mg/kg cannot be excluded. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

implement safety changes and add a warning 
regarding cases of "pancytopenia" as requested by 
the CHMP further to the assessment of the 5th PSUR. 
In addition "leukocytoclastic vasculitis" and 
thrombocytopenia are added to the Section 4.8 of 
the SPC.

on the following changes to the SPC and PI accordingly.  
Update of section 4.4 (Special warnings and precautions for 
use): 
There have been post-marketing reports (both spontaneous 
and from clinical trials) of pancytopenia or aggravation of 
pancytopenia in patients treated with EXJADE. Most of

these patients had pre-existing haematological disorders 
that are frequently associated with bone marrow failure. 
However, the responsibility of Exjade as an aggravating or 
a contributing factor cannot be ruled out. Interruption of 
treatment should be considered in patients who develop 
unexplained pancytopenia. 
Update of section 4.8 (Undesirable effects): 
Addition of pancytopenia and thrombocytopenia as follows :  
Blood and Lymphatic system disorders: 
Not known : pancytopenia (see section 4.4), 
thrombocytopenia

The CHMP introduced updated information on warning 
Package Leaflet: 
Amendment of Sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC 
following results from two clinical studies on drug-
drug interaction to investigate the effect of rifamficin 
(potent UGT inducer) and repaglinide (Cyp2C8 probe 
substrate). The CHMP requested the MAH to update 
the Product Information following previous 
assessment of these two clinical studies as Follow Up 
Measures. The Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. 
In addition, minor QRD corrections were made in 
Sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC. 
regarding potential interactions with potent UGT inducer 
and CYP2C8 substrates: 
Update of section 4.4 
Caution should be exercised when deferasirox is combined 
with strong UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) inducers, 
or CYP2C8 substrates (see section 4.5). 
Update of section 4.5 
The CHMP introduced updated information on drug 
interaction with rifampicin (potent UGT inducer): 
In a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant

administration of deferasirox (single dose of 30 mg/kg) and 
the potent UGT inducer, rifampicin, (repeated dose of 600 
mg/day) resulted in a decrease of deferasirox exposure by 
44% (90% CI: 37% - 51%). Therefore, the concomitant 
use of deferasirox with potent UGT inducers (e.g. 
rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, 
ritonavir) may result in a decrease in EXJADE efficacy (see 
section 4.4).  
The CHMP introduced updated information on drug 
interaction with repaglinide (CYP2C8 substrate) 
"In a healthy volunteer study, the concomitant 
administration of deferasirox as a moderate CYP2C8 
inhibitor (30 mg/kg daily),  with repaglinide, a CYP2C8 
substrate, given as a single dose of 0,5 mg, increased 
repaglinide AUC and Cmax about 2.3-fold (90% CI [2.03-
2.63]) and 1.6-fold (90% CI [1.42-1.84]) respectively. 
Since the interaction has not been established with dosages 
higher than 0,5 mg for repaglinide, the concomitant use of 
deferasirox with repaglinide should be avoided. If the 
combination appears necessary, a careful clinical and blood 
glucose monitoring should be performed (see section 4.4)".  
An interaction between EXJADE and other CYP2C8 
substrates like paclitaxel cannot be excluded (see section 
4.4).

1.  Introduction 
On December 2015, the MAH submitted a completed study for Bexsero, in accordance with Article 46 
of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
The MAH stated that the generated data do not influence the benefit-risk balance for Bexsero. A type II 
variation addressing potential amendments to the Product Information will be submitted in 2017. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that the study ‘A phase IIIb, open label, multi center extension study of V72_28 to 
assess antibody persistence, and the safety and tolerability of a booster dose after the completion of 
the vaccination course in study V72_28.’ is a stand-alone study to evaluate the safety and tolerability 
of a booster dose after completion of the vaccination course in study V72_28.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Meningococcal meningitis and sepsis are diseases that can result in death within hours, despite the 
availability of effective antibiotics. The diseases are caused by Neisseria meningitidis (N meningitidis), 
a gram-negative, encapsulated bacterium classified into 5 major pathogenic serogroups (A, B, C, Y, 
and W-135) on the basis of the chemical composition of distinctive capsular polysaccharides. The 
reported annual incidence of meningococcal disease in the US varies from 0.5 to 10 per 100 000 
population. The overall incidence in Canada varies from 0.5 to 2.1 per 100 000 population (PHA 
Canada, 2005). Each year, there are an estimated 1400-2800 cases of meningococcal disease in the 
US (Goldschneider et al, 1969), and in the year 2002 more than 5500 cases were reported in Europe 
(Muros et al, 2004). The case-fatality rate ranges from 5% to 15%, and up to 25% of survivors are left 
with neurological sequelae, limb loss or hearing loss. The disease is most common in children and 
young adults. The serogroup B in the year 2002 accounted for 36% of all reported meningococcal 
disease in the US, 28% in Canada, and from 41% to 90% of reported cases in Europe (Connolly and 
Noah, 1999; HPA 2006; Muros et al, 2004; Raghunathan et al, 2004). 
In the 1960s, meningococcal vaccines consisting of purified polysaccharide antigens were developed 
against 4 (A, C, Y, and W-135) of the 5 pathogenic serogroups. Currently, there are no commercial 
vaccines available in North America or Europe for the prevention of disease caused by serogroup B of N 
meningitidis. Actually, the use of capsular polysaccharide as the basis of a vaccine for prevention of 
meningococcal B diseases has proven problematic. The meningococcal B capsular polysaccharide is 
identical to a widely distributed human carbohydrate (α[2→8] N-acetyl neuraminic acid or polysialic 
acid), which, being a self-antigen, is a poor immunogen in humans. An alternative approach to 
meningococcal B vaccine development has used surface-exposed proteins contained in outer 
membrane vesicles (OMV). These vaccines have been shown both to elicit serum bactericidal antibody 
responses and to be efficacious against developing meningococcal disease in clinical trials. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The present study, V72_28E1, is a phase 3b extension of study V72_28 which evaluated the safety and 
immunogenicity of the Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics meningococcal B recombinant vaccine with

outer membrane vesicles produced from N meningitides serogroup B strain NZ98/254 (rMenB+OMV 
NZ) when administered alone without routine infant vaccines to healthy infants in their first year of life 
according to different 2 and 3 dose immunization schedules. The V72_28 study was also aimed at 
investigating the antibody persistence after primary series and administration of a subsequent booster 
dose of rMenB+OMV NZ at 11 months of age. In the V72_28 study the safety and immunogenicity of 2 
catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ when administered to healthy children 2 to 10 years of age were 
also assessed.  
The aim of this extension study was to explore the antibody persistence 24-36 months, after the last 
dose of rMenB+OMV NZ in children, who previously received a 2 or 3 dose primary series plus a 
booster dose at 11 months of age of rMenB+OMV NZ, as infants. This study was also to explore the 
antibody persistence 24-36 months, after 2 catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to children 
(2-10 years old). 
In addition, this study also evaluated the antibody response (safety and immunogenicity) to an 
additional dose boost in a subset of subjects who received 2 catch-up doses or ii) a 2 or 3 dose 
primary series plus a booster dose of rMenB+OMV NZ in parent trial V72_28, and iii) the safety and 
immunogenicity of 2 catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ administered 1 month apart to healthy 
vaccine-naïve subjects of similar age of follow-on subjects. 
The MAH submitted reports for: 
• 
‘A phase IIIb, open label, multi center extension study of V72_28 to assess antibody 
persistence, and the safety and tolerability of a booster dose after the completion of the vaccination 
course in study V72_28.’

This trial is an extension of study V72_28. It was conducted as a multicenter study and enrolled 
subjects who completed the vaccination course of study V72_28 (follow-on subjects enrolled in groups 
I to IV), and who met all other enrollment criteria for this extension study. 
Following are the vaccine groups and vaccination schedule in the parent study V72_28 and in the 
present study V72_28E1: 
•  Group I: This group received 3 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ at 2½, 3½ and 5 months of age and a 
booster at 11 months of age. In this extension study, this group was randomized to 1:2 ratio 
to nonvaccination and vaccination subsets, respectively. The vaccination subset received a fifth 
dose boost in this study. 
•  Group II: This group received 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ at 3½ and 5 months of age and a 
booster dose at 11 months of age. In this extension study, this group was randomized to 1:2 
ratio to nonvaccination and vaccination subsets, respectively. The vaccination subset received 
a fourth dose boost in this study. 
•  Group III: This group received 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ at 6 and 8 months of age and a 
booster dose at 11 months of age. In this extension study, this group was randomized to 1:2 
ratio to nonvaccination and vaccination subsets, respectively. The vaccination subset received 
a fourth dose boost in this study. 
•  Group IVa: This group constituted of subjects aged 2-5 years and received 2 doses of 
rMenB+OMV NZ at a 0, 2 month schedule. In this extension study, this group was randomized 
to 1:1 ratio to nonvaccination and vaccination subsets. The vaccination subset received third 
dose boost in this study. 
•  Group IVb: This group constituted of subjects aged 6-10 years and received 2 doses of 
rMenB+OMV NZ at a 0, 2 month schedule. In this extension study, this group was randomized 
to 1:2 ratio to nonvaccination and vaccination subsets. The vaccination subset received a third 
dose boost in this study. Subjects in nonvaccination subset were evaluated for antibody 
persistence only. Subjects assigned to vaccination subset with a fifth (Group A) or fourth 
(Group C and E) or third (Group G and I) dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ were evaluated for 
both antibody persistence and antibody response. 
• 
In addition, 3 groups of vaccine-naïve subjects (Groups K, L and M) of similar age to the 
enrolled subjects in groups A to F (vaccine-naïve Group K: 35-47 months of age), Groups G to 
H (vaccine-naïve Group L: 4-7 years old) and in Groups I to J (vaccine-naïve Group M: 8-12 
years old), not previously enrolled in the parent study V72_28, were recruited at the same 
study sites and received 2 catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ administered 1 month apart. 
These subjects served as a baseline descriptive comparison for antibody persistence in the 
above mentioned groups and had a blood sample drawn for serological analyses at entry. In 
addition, their response after the first vaccination served as a descriptive comparison for the 
booster response in subjects from the parent study.

•  Groups A to J: All subjects in Group A to J had a blood drawn at study month 0. Subjects 
randomized to the vaccination subset (Groups A, C, E, G and I) received a booster dose of 
rMenB+OMV NZ and an additional sample was drawn at study month 1 (1 month after the 
booster dose - last study visit; Table 2-1; Table 2-2). 
•  Groups K, L and M: All subjects in Groups K to M had a blood drawn at study month 0, 1 and 2 
and received 2 catch up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ, at study month 0 and 1. These subjects also 
served as baseline descriptive comparison for antibody persistence in the follow-on subjects. In 
addition, their response after the first vaccination served as a descriptive comparison for the 
booster response in subjects from the parent study (Table 2-3).

Statistical Methods 
The analyses of immunogenicity and safety were descriptive. As such, no statistical tests were to be 
performed. For the immunogenicity endpoints, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were to be calculated. 
The immunogenicity analyses were to be based on the full analysis set (FAS) and the safety analyses, 
on the safety set. 
The percentages of subjects with hSBA titers≥ 4, ≥ 5, ≥ 8 and the associated 2-sided Clopper-Pearson 
95% CIs were computed, by vaccine group for each of the N meningitidis serogroup B strains. 
For analyzing GMTs, the antibody titers and antigen concentrations were logarithmically transformed 
(log10). GMTs and the associated 2-sided 95% CI were computed by exponentiating (base10) the 
corresponding least square means of the log10-transformed titers and the associated 95% CI obtained 
from a 2-way ANOVA with factors for vaccine group and study center. 
GMRs and the associated 2-sided 95% CI were obtained from a 2-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 
with factors for vaccine group and study center.

A total of 851 subjects were enrolled in this extension study, 255 subjects were evaluated for antibody 
persistence only and 596 subjects (follow-on + vaccine-naïve subjects) were evaluated for antibody 
persistence and booster/first dose response. Majority of the subjects enrolled in the vaccination subset 
(follow-on + vaccine-naïve subjects) were included in the per protocol set (PPS) and FAS. 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics were balanced across the vaccine groups as per the 
age groups. Most of the subjects were of white race and the gender distribution was similar. 
Antibody persistence after 24-36 months of vaccination course in follow-on subjects or at 
baseline in vaccine-naïve subjects: 
35-47 months of age: 
Across the vaccine follow-on groups, there was a decline in antibody titers against all strains at 24-36 
months after the completion of the vaccination course in V72_28 (visit 1 in V72_28E1) from 1 month 
after last vaccination in V72_28. 
Overall, at 24-36 months after the completion of the vaccination course in V72_28 study, hSBA 
antibody titers across the 3 follow-on groups (2H3H511, 3H5_11 and 68_11) were higher than 
NAIVE_123 group except against strain M10713 (Table 2-6). At 24-36 months after the completion of 
the vaccination course in V72_28 study, GMTs across the 3 follow-on groups were higher than the 
NAIVE_123 group except against strain M10713 (Table 2-8). 
Across the vaccine follow-on groups, at 24-36 months after the completion of the vaccination course in 
V72_28 study, substantial proportions of subjects retained hSBA antibody titers ≥ 4 against strain 
5/99 (84% to 93%). Against strains H44/76 and NZ98/254, the percentages of subjects with hSBA 
antibody titers ≥ 4 were 51% to 61% and 38% to 56% of subjects, respectively. The percentages of 
subjects with persisting hSBA antibody titers ≥ 5 against strain M10713 were 31% to 39% (Table 2-6). 
In the NAIVE_123 group at baseline, the percentages of subjects with hSBA antibody titers ≥ 4 were 
38% against H44/76 and very low against strains 5/99 (3%) and NZ98/254 (2%). The percentages of

Overall, hSBA antibody titers across the 3 vaccine-naïve groups (NAIVE_123, NAIVE_4A and 
NAIVE_4B) were similar against each given strain (Table 11.4.1-9). At baseline (visit 1 in V72_28E1) 
the GMTs were low across vaccine-naïve subjects against all strains. The 1 month after first 
dose/baseline GMRs were 5.35-fold to 8.15-fold against strain H44/76, 14-fold to 35-fold against strain 
H44/76, 5.72-fold to 7.28-fold against strain NZ98/254 and 1.40-fold to 1.68-fold against strain 
M10713. 
Across all vaccine-naive groups, the 1 month of second dose/baseline GMRs were 34-fold to 46-fold 
against strain H44/76; 242-fold to 558-fold against strain H44/76; 27-fold to 30-fold against strain

Against all strains, at 1 month after first dose (visit 2 in V72_28E1) there was an increase in the titers 
with some variability depending on the strains. A more robust increase in the titers was observed at 1 
month after the second dose (visit 3 in V72_28E1) especially against strain 5/99 (Table 11.4.1-10). 
CHMP comment: 
Booster dosing: 
For both young and older children 4 to 7 years and 8 to 12 years booster dosing resulted in 
substantial increase in AB titers for the majority of strains with lowest outcome for M10713. 
2-dose catch-up series response in vaccine-naïve subjects: 
Catch-up dosing resulted in a substantial increase of subjects developing hSBA antibody titers 
especially against H44/76, 5/99 and NZ98/254 with low outcome for M10713

CHMP comment: 
No SAEs were reported in the study. 
No unexpected safety signal was generated during the study 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
24-36 months after the completion of the vaccination course in V72_28, the antibody levels declined 
against all strains across all follow-on vaccine groups with in general higher GMTs and AB titters in 
follow-on subjects compared to vaccine-naïve subjects.  
The immunogenicity outcome for M10713 was in general low across the groups investigated. This is 
not unexpected, as the responses to this strain were seen as problematic in previous studies as well.  
The administration of a booster dose of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine in previously primed subjects (follow-
on groups) or two catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ administered 1 month apart to vaccine-naïve 
subjects induced strong hSBA titers with lowest results for M10713. The results were hereby 
comparable for booster vaccinations in infants who initially received either 2 or 3 doses.   
No unexpected safety signal was generated. No SAEs were reported in this study. 
The MAH is planning to submit a type II variation to update the SPC with data from the current study. 
This is endorsed.  
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation

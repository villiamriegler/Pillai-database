2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem  statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication applied for was for relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) or small 
lymphocytic lymphoma  (SLL) after at least one prior  therapy with or without the presence of 17p deletion or 
TP53 mutation and relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after at least one prior systemic therapy.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology   
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma  (CLL/SLL) is the most common leukaemia in the 
Western world with an incidence of 4.2:100 000/year. The incidence increases to >30:100 000/year at an 
age of >80 years. The median age at diagnosis is 72 years. About 10% of the CLL patients are reported to be 
younger than 55 years (Eichhorst et al.,  2015).  
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma  (NHL) is the twelfth most frequently diagnosed malignancy in Europe, with 115,118 
cases estimated in 2018 (ECIS). Follicular lymphomas constitute approximately  8% of all NHLs (Sant et al., 
2010) and is the most frequent indolent NHL and the second most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the 
United States and Europe (Casulo et al.,  2015).  The incidence of follicular lymphoma  increases with age, 
with the median age at diagnosis between 60 and 65 years. The reported median age at diagnosis for FL is 
64.9 years (Casulo et al., 2015).  
2.1.3.  Biologic  features 
CLL 
CLL is a mature B-cell neoplasm characterised by an accumulation of monoclonal mature B cells 
(CD5+/CD19+) in the blood, bone marrow,  and secondary lymph organs. The current World Health 
Organization (WHO) classification system recognises CLL/SLL as one disease but with distinct clinical 
presentations: CLL manifests as circulating tumour cells in peripheral blood and includes bone marrow 
infiltration, while SLL is primarily  restricted to lymph nodes and other lymphoid compartments (Swerdlow, 
2008). Historically, the treatment approach for CLL and SLL  has been the same, with clinical trial enrolment 
inclusive of both diagnoses. European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines for 
diagnosis, treatment and follow-up are published for CLL/SLL and recent drug approvals (Eichhorst et al., 
2015) reflect CLL/SLL as a single indication.  
FL 
The genetic event characteristic of 90% of FL cases is a translocation involving the antiapoptotic BCL2 gene 
on chromosome 18 to the transcriptional enhancer of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene locus on 
chromosome 14 (t14;18), resulting in a survival advantage from constitutive overexpression of BCL2 
(reviewed by Casulo and Barr,  2019). 
assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236249/2021 
Page 10/206 
 
  
  
2.1.4.  Clinical  presentation,  diagnosis  
CLL 
The natural history of CLL is variable although somewhat predicted by both clinical and genomic features. 
Many complications of the disease, such as anaemia and an impaired cellular and humoral immune system 
resulting in frequent infections and requiring supportive care, can lead to substantial socioeconomic costs and 
impaired quality of life. Since complete eradication of malignant clonal tumour cells is not possible with 
available therapeutic options, current treatment strategy seeks to prolong the suppression of these malignant 
cells. Although available regimens prolong progression-free survival (PFS) in the relapse setting, CLL remains 
incurable in most patients outside of the small subset of young or fit patients eligible for allogeneic stem cell 
transplant. 
FL 
FL in adults is generally an indolent B cell lymphoproliferative disorder of transformed follicular centre B cells, 
and is characterised by diffuse lymphadenopathy, bone marrow  involvement, splenomegaly and less 
commonly other extra nodal sites of involvement (Freedman, 2018). The disease course is highly variable, 
with some patients asymptomatic for a long time,  negating the need for therapy, while others require 
immediate intervention. Although sustained complete remissions can be achieved with various treatments, 
advanced indolent lymphomas are not curable with currently available therapies.  
Patients with FL progressing within 24 months of initial immunochemotherapy with BR (bendamustine plus 
rituximab), R-CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone plus rituximab),  or R-CVP 
(cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone plus rituximab), or within 12 months of single agent 
rituximab have early treatment failure (Parikh, 2018), although the definition may vary slightly.  
2.1.5.  Management 
CLL 
Treatment has evolved from monotherapy with alkylating agents (chlorambucil, bendamustine) and purine 
analogues (fludarabine) to immunotherapy (anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab and anti-CD20 
monoclonal antibody ofatumumab) and chemoimmunotherapy combinations (rituximab,  ofatumumab as well 
as obinutuzumab in combination with purine and alkylating agents). Since 2014, novel targeted agents have 
been approved initially in the relapsed and some later in the previously untreated setting and include: 
Ibrutinib, a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor with the current indication (in CLL as a single agent or in 
combination with obinutuzumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated 
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and as a single agent or in combination with bendamustine and 
rituximab (BR) for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior  therapy. 
Idelalisib, a phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K-δ) inhibitor with the current indication (in CLL): Zydelig is 
indicated in combination with rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy or as first line treatment in the presence of 17p 
deletion or TP53 mutation in patients who are not eligible for any other therapies. 
Venetoclax, a BCL-2 inhibitor with the current indication in CLL: in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 
mutation in adult patients who are unsuitable for or have failed a B-cell receptor  pathway inhibitor, or in the 
absence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who have failed both chemoimmunotherapy and a 
B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor.

Even with the availability of these novel treatments, most patients will eventually relapse,  and many will 
succumb to their disease. Furthermore, not all patients tolerate or respond to these treatments, and 
resistance will emerge over time.  In addition, the response rate tends to be lower and the duration of 
response (DOR) becomes progressively shorter with each subsequent line of therapy (Fischer et al., 2011; 
Carton et al., 2014; Keating et al., 2002, Wierda et al., 2010; Catovsky et al, 2007). There remains an 
unmet medical need for additional novel therapies, especially for patients with previously treated CLL.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) 
No curative treatments exist for iNHL,  including FL, SLL  and MZL. The standard of care is to administer 
various combinations of chemoimmunotherapy or radioimmunotherapy with diminishing effectiveness as 
patients progress through multiple lines of therapy or become refractory to treatment. The vast majority  of 
patients treated for FL will have an initial response to therapy with 40 to 80 percent demonstrating a 
complete response, depending on the initial regimen used. However,  conventional therapy for FL is not 
curative and most of these patients will ultimately develop progressive disease. In addition, less than 10 
percent of patients treated with initial chemoimmunotherapy will not respond to treatment (ie, refractory 
disease). New treatment options for patients with relapsed iNHL who have not responded to or have 
progressed within 6 months of completing a rituximab and a chemotherapy regimen or RIT are needed.  
Rituximab,  an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy 
(cyclophosphamide and fludarabine; bendamustine; doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP); and 
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP)) has been the mainstay first- and second-line therapy 
for FL (Dreyling et al.,  2016). In newly diagnosed patients, the median progression-free survival is 6 to 8 
years, and the median overall survival is 12 to 15 years. Approximately  20% of patients with FL progress 
within two years of initial chemoimmunotherapy, a population that has shown a commensurately lower 5-
year overall survival rate (50% vs 90% for patients without early progression) (Casulo et al., 2015).  
Idelalisib, a PI3K-δinhibitor was granted approval as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with 
follicular lymphoma (FL) that is refractory to two prior  lines of treatment based on the results of a single arm 
trial demonstrating durable complete and partial responses, (Study 101-09, DELTA, NCT01282424, Gopal et 
al., 2014) and extension Study 101-99, NCT01090414). In this single-arm study, idelalisib demonstrated an 
overall response rate (ORR) of 54.2% (8.3% complete response [CR], 45.8% partial response [PR]) in 72 FL 
subjects (see Zydelig SmPC). The median duration of response (DOR) for FL subjects was not reached. 
Confirmation of clinical benefit has not yet been reported in a randomised controlled setting. The ESMO 
Clinical Practice Guidelines for Newly Diagnosed and Relapsed Follicular Lymphoma  include idelalisib as a 
recommended treatment option for later relapses providing an alternative monotherapy treatment for 
patients with FL that are refractory to rituximab or alkylating agents (Dreyling et al., 2016).  
Another anti-CD20 antibody, obinutuzumab, was approved in April  2016 in combination with bendamustine 
followed by obinutuzumab maintenance in patients with FL who have relapsed or who are refractory to a 
rituximab-containing regimen by demonstrating improved progression-free survival.  
Over the past several decades, substantial advances have been made in event-free survival, progression-free 
survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) of patients with FL. These survival improvements are mostly 
attributed to progress in the delivery of effective anti-lymphoma therapies and improvements in supportive 
care (Casulo et al., 2015). Even with the newer available treatments, most patients with FL will eventually 
relapse or become intolerant to therapy. In addition, the rate of response and DOR progressively diminish 
with each subsequent line of therapy.  Therefore, an unmet need exists in this condition.

directly targets the survival and proliferation of malignant B cells, while PI3K-γ inhibition blocks the 
recruitment and differentiation of CD4+ T cells and macrophages which support the proliferation and survival 
of malignant B cells. 
The drug substance duvelisib is a small molecule manufactured by a well described synthetic process, which

2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of duvelisib is (S)-3-(1-(9H-purin-6-ylamino)ethyl)-8-chloro-2-phenylisoquinolin-1(2H)-
one hydrate corresponding to the molecular formula C22H17ClN6O (•H2O). It has a relative molecular mass of 
416.86 g/mol (as anhydrous form) and 434.88 g/mol (as monohydrate) with the following structure:

Page 15/206 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Duvelisib is a chiral compound with a single chiral centre as (S) enantiomer. The duvelisib crystal structure 
indicates that the active substance is a channel hydrate containing eight water and eight duvelisib molecules 
in the asymmetric  unit cell. 
The chemical structure of duvelisib has been elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, Fourier 
Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR) (1H-NMR and 13C-
NMR) and mass spectrometry. 
The active substance is a white to off-white crystalline solid which is practically insoluble in water, slightly 
soluble in simulated gastric fluid and exhibits pH-dependent solubility in aqueous buffers. Based on the 
solubility data in pH 1.2 hydrochloric solution (5.94 mg/mL), full dissolution is expected to be achieved in the 
stomach.  
Duvelisib exhibits polymorphism.  Multiple crystal forms of duvelisib active substance have been identified and 
characterised during extensive polymorphic screening studies. The polymorphic forms of duvelisib can be 
distinguished by XRPD. The manufacturing process followed and described is capable of consistently 
producing duvelisib.  
Duvelisib polymorphic form does not adsorb moisture beyond its water of hydration between 0 and 80% 
relative humidity. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Duvelisib is synthesised in 3 main stages using commercially  available well-defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications.  
The synthetic manufacturing process consists of 3 stages.  
Only one site is involved in the manufacture of the active substance. The designated starting materials have 
been satisfactorily justified. Proper  specifications have been established for the respective starting materials 
and they are supported by comprehensive evaluation of potential impurities, which can be introduced to the 
process with the respective starting materials.  
Overall, the control strategy for the manufacture of duvelisib is satisfactory. In support of the proposed 
control strategy, spike and purge studies have been performed to investigate the process capability to purge 
enantiomeric impurities. 
Isolated intermediates formed during manufacturing process are sufficiently controlled. In addition, 
acceptable specifications for reagents, solvents and other materials  used in the synthesis have been 
provided. Critical steps of the process were identified and are controlled by justified and appropriate  in-
process controls.  
Process conditions have been optimised following DOE studies to reduce formation of side products while 
maintaining the desired yield. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities  were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. Potential genotoxic impurities  have been identified, their purge and fate studied in 
order to establish proper control strategy. 
assessment report

The information presented regarding potential impurities/degradation products controlled in the active 
substance is sufficient. Overall the defined control strategy is satisfactory. Changes introduced have been 
presented in sufficient detail and have been justified.  
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable  with that produced by the proposed commercial  process. 
Duvelisib is packed in a LDPE bag placed inside a second LDPE bag and secured appropriately.  The double 
LDPE bagged active substance is placed into a suitable secondary container (HDPE drum with a lid). This 
secondary container is used to provide mechanical strength to protect the LDPE bags during shipping and 
handling. The secondary container has no contact with the active substance. The primary  packing material 
complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), identification (FT-IR, HPLC, XRPD), 
assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (HS-GC), water content (KF), particle size distribution (Ph. 
Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), elemental impurities (ICP-MS) and microbiological enumeration (Ph. 
Eur.).  
The specification limits  for impurities/degradation products and residual solvents, are  in accordance with the 
requirements of ICH guidelines Q3A and Q3C. The control strategy for potential genotoxic compounds has been 
satisfactorily justified.  
All  solvents  used  throughout the  entire  synthetic  process,  including  those  employed  prior  to  the  starting 
material,  are routinely controlled in the specification and specified at levels below the ICH Q3C thresholds.  
A suitable specification for particle size distribution is applied for the active substance based on the range of 
particle sizes used. The analysis for elemental impurities in duvelisib active substance is carried out in 
compliance with ICH Q3D. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. The specification of the finished product manufacturer is fully 
in line with the specification of the active substance manufacturer. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used has been presented. 
The active substance specification is based on the active substance critical quality attributes (CQAs). The control 
strategy for duvelisib active substance was developed to ensure that the finished product consistently meets 
its CQAs and ultimately achieves the QTPP.  
Batch analysis data from several pilot scale batches manufactured by the proposed commercial  process, 
several commercial  scale pre-validation batches and several commercial  batches are provided, demonstrating 
compliance with the proposed specifications. The batch data provided is considered to be sufficient. 
Consistency and uniformity of the active substance quality have been demonstrated.  
Stability 
Stability data from several primary  pilot scale stability batches and several commercial scale validation 
batches of active substance, from the proposed manufacturer, stored in the proposed container closure

system for up to 40 months and 36 months, respectively, under long term conditions (25°C/60% RH), and 
for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40°C/75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. 14-days temperature excursion studies were also conducted with samples stored at -20°C±5°C for 
14 days followed by 14 days stored at 50°C±2°C, followed by 60 months at 25°C/60% RH for the long-term 
stability. These studies support physicochemical stability of the active substance. 
All tested parameters were within the specification. 
Forced  degradation  studies  were  conducted  on  duvelisib  to  assess  the  effect  of  extreme  temperature 
excursions, light, acid, based, oxidation, heat and humidity. The data from these studies suggest duvelisib to 
be a stable compound and no special storage and handling instructions are warranted. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug Substances and Products. The results of the study indicate that upon direct exposure, the product is not 
sensitive to light. Therefore, it is concluded no special storage conditions with respect to light are required. 
The stability  results indicate that the active  substance manufactured by  the proposed  supplier  is  sufficiently 
stable.

The aim of the development of duvelisib capsule dosage form was to provide a stable formulation with the 
intended biopharmaceutical properties.  The safety, efficacy and subject compliance requirements were also 
considered to set the dosage form design, primary  packaging design, and critical attributes selection.  
Appropriate  QTPP product features were translated into product CQAs. These CQAs were subjected to initial 
risk assessment and further refined throughout the development, optimisation and finalisation of the 
manufacturing process.  
As indicated in the active substance section, duvelisib is practically insoluble in water. In aqueous media at 
room temperature,  duvelisib is slightly soluble in pH 1.2, very slightly soluble in buffers pH 2.2 and 3.0 and 
practically insoluble in pH range 4.0 to 7.4. Duvelisib is considered to be a Class IV compound in the 
Biopharmaceutical Classification System with low solubility and low permeability  across physiological pH 
range. Excipients were chosen to provide an immediate release capsule formulation that is physiochemically 
stable for the intended period of storage, meeting the appropriate  target requirements of QTPP: acceptable 
stability, immediate release and robust manufacturing process.  
The excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards, except for the iron oxide black (E172) and butyl alcohol used in the composition of the black ink 
which are non-compendial excipients. Compliance with EU 231/2012 has been confirmed for iron oxides used 
in the gelatin capsules. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
A compatibility study was performed to examine the interaction between the active substance and the 
proposed excipients. Binary mixtures of duvelisib and each excipient as well as the final formulation mixture 
were tested for at least 72 hours at 50°C and for at least 4 weeks at 40°C/75% RH. No detectable 
degradation was observed and duvelisib active substance was found to be compatible  with the hard gelatin 
capsule shells and excipients.  
During the procedure, the applicant has been requested to substantiate why the capsules should be 
swallowed as whole as claimed in SmPC section 4.2. Given the patient population likely to be taking this 
medicine will largely be elderly, the company was requested to investigate possibilities to administer the 
finished product to patients who have problems  with swallowing the capsules. Based on the available clinical 
data, the bioequivalence between the product administrated as whole capsule and the capsule content 
suspended in soft food cannot be concluded. In addition, chemical stability studies of the active substance in 
different types of soft food are missing. In the absence of studies to verify the compatibility  of the duvelisib 
powder if added to food or drink, the recommendation remains to not open the capsules and/or mix capsule 
contents with food or drink. The applicant agreed to investigate alternative methods of administration for 
patients with swallowing difficulties as post marketing activity.  When supportive data is obtained, a variation 
application will be submitted to revise the Product Information regarding additional advice on the method of 
administration. The proposed commitment is accepted.   
The dissolution method is performed in accordance with Ph. Eur Sink conditions are met during testing of 
both capsule strengths. 
Development work was performed with the 25 mg strength, which included evaluation of media pH, rotation 
speed and media volume. The addition of surfactants was not evaluated since adequate dissolution was 
achieved by adjusting the pH of the medium. The final proposed acceptance criteria for duvelisib hard

capsules 25 mg was determined. The discriminatory power  of the dissolution method has been demonstrated 
with respect to active substance particle size and post-lubrication blending time.  
The manufacturing process development has been adequately described. Based on the initial risk assessment 
CQAs have been addressed over the development from development to commercial  batch sizes. Normal 
Operational Ranges have been set and examined. An overall control strategy has been established. 
The  primary  packaging  is  a  Child-resistant PVC-PE-PCTFE  /  Aluminium  blister.  The  material  complies  with 
Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data 
and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured by only one manufacturer. The manufacturing process main steps are 
blending and encapsulation. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process.  
The manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail and the in-process controls are adequate 
for hard capsules. 
The manufacturing process for duvelisib capsules, 25 mg and 15 mg is considered as a standard process and 
traditional process validation has been performed with three consecutive batches of each strength 
manufactured at the commercial  manufacturing site. Overall, it has been demonstrated that the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible 
manner.  
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications Error!  Reference source not found.include 
appropriate  tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance, identification (HPLC, UV), assay (duvelisib 
content) (RP HPLC), content uniformity (RP HPLC), related substances (RP HPLC), water content (KF,Ph. 
Eur.), dissolution (RP HPLC), microbiological  enumeration test (Ph. Eur.), specified microorganisms- E. coli 
(Ph. Eur.). 
The potential presence of class 1 and 2A elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed 
following a risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities.  Batch analysis 
data was provided. The information on the control of elemental impurities  is satisfactory.   
Following a major objection raised during the evaluation, a risk assessment on the potential presence of 
nitrosamine impurities in the finished product based on the combined recommendations from health 
authorities, including EMA communication EMA/189634/2019 was presented. The nitrosamine impurities risk 
assessment of the finished product included evaluating contributions from duvelisib, excipients, finished 
product manufacturing facilities, and packaging components. It was concluded that there is no risk related to 
the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the product. Therefore, no changes to the control strategy for 
Copiktra are necessary to mitigate potential contamination by nitrosamines.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately  validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification.

Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 primary  stability batches of 15 mg capsules stored for up to 36 months at long-term 
(30°C/75% RH, Zone IVb) and up to  6 months stability data at accelerated conditions (40ºC/75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided; and three production scale batches of 25 mg capsules stored 
for up to 60 months under long term conditions (30°C/65% RH, Zone IVa and 30°C/75% RH,  Zone IVb), and 
up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC/75% RH). Samples were packaged in thermoform 
blisters.  
In addition, several batches of the 25 mg strength were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products, packaged in thermoform blisters. Unpacked 
samples along with the same samples protected from light (dark control) were studied. The results of the 
study indicate that upon direct exposure, the product is sensitive to light. The storage restriction “Store in the 
original package in order to protect from light” is therefore applied.  
A forced degradation study was also carried out on duvelisib 25 mg capsules. The results obtained confirm 
the stability indicative nature under humidity, acid hydrolysis, base hydrolysis and oxidation conditions. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 48 months for Copiktra 15 mg hard capsules or 60 
months for Copiktra 25 mg hard capsules, with the storage conditions “store below 30°C” and store in the 
original package in order to protect from light” as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product for manufacture of the capsule shells. Valid TSE 
CEPs from the suppliers of the gelatine used in the manufacture is provided.  
No other excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical  aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
During the procedure a major objection was raised with respect to the risk assessment on the potential 
presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product. The applicant has satisfactorily addressed this 
major  objection and it was concluded that there is no risk related to the presence of nitrosamine impurities in 
the product.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was one minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product regarding possibilities to administer the finished product to patients who 
have problems with swallowing the capsules. A recommendation has been issued. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions  on the chemical, pharmaceutical  and biological  aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of

the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have been presented to 
give reassurance on TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations  for future quality development    
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
Given the patient population likely to be taking this medicine will largely be elderly, the applicant is requested 
to investigate possibilities to administer the finished product to patients who have problems  with swallowing 
the capsules taking into-account the Reflection paper  on the pharmaceutical development of medicines for 
use in the older population EMA/CHMP/QWP/292439/2017 (October 2020). 
2.3.  Non-clinical  aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The pharmacology-testing plan for duvelisib was designed to delineate the role of PI3K-δ and PI3K-γ 
inhibition in haematologic malignancies and to provide the scientific rationale for the use of duvelisib in the 
proposed indications. The pharmacology evaluation included biochemical, cellular, and whole blood assays to 
assess the binding to and inhibition of PI3K isoforms by duvelisib and its major  metabolite, IPI-656. Duvelisib 
and IPI-656 specificity was assessed using a diverse panel of kinases, as well as a panel of G protein 
coupled- receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, and transporters. 
Single dose pharmacokinetics of duvelisib has been studied in BALB/c mice, Sprague Dawley rats, beagle 
dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. PK after repeated dose and IPI-656 were determined in the Sprague-Dawley 
rats, New Zealand White rabbits, and cynomolgus monkeys, which were the animal species and strains used 
in toxicological evaluation of duvelisib. All of the pivotal safety pharmacology studies, toxicology studies and 
bioanalytical assays for duvelisib and metabolite  IPI-656 were conducted in compliance with GLP in OECD 
member  countries. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  
Duvelisib was shown in isoform selective enzymatic assays to selectively inhibit PI3K-δ, and PI3K-γ at low nM 
concentrations (IC50 values of 1.3 and 31.4 nM respectively), whereas the major metabolite IPI-656 showed 
much less selectivity, with much higher IC50 values (the lowest being PI3K-δ with a IC50 value of 3827.1 
nM). Idelalisib (CAL-101) was included as a PI3K-δ isoform specific inhibitor. IC50 values were determined in 
an endpoint assay run in the presence of 3.0 mM ATP (ie, physiological levels), quantitating the 
concentration-dependent decrease in [α-32P] ADP formation as a function of increasing concentrations of 
duvelisib. Results showed that duvelisib potently inhibits PI3K-δ and PI3K γ, with IC50 values of 2.5 nM and 
27.4 nM, respectively.

To determine the affinity of duvelisib for PI3K-δ, PI3K-γ, and PI3K-β, the individual rate constants (kon and 
koff) were measured, yielding the dissociation constant (Kd). For PI3K-α, the koff was too rapid to determine 
experimentally, and the Kd was measured directly by equilibrium fluorescence titration. A summary of the 
binding rate constants and Kd values for each PI3K isoform is presented below (Winkler et al 2013).

α, β, γ, and δ inhibitory activity of IPI-145 and IPI-656 was measured in SKOV-3, 786-O, RAW264.7, and 
RAJI cells, respectively. The four cellular assays were pre-incubated with varying concentrations of test article 
and inhibition of phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 was monitored by ELISA. Percent inhibition of AKT 
phosphorylation was measured, and the concentration of inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% (IC50) of AKT 
phosphorylation was calculated.

To evaluate the cellular potency of duvelisib in the presence of human blood constituents, whole blood assays 
using PI3K-δ, PI3K-γ, and PI3K-β specific stimuli were developed.   
The PI3K pathway plays a critical role in the activation of basophils by relaying signals from cell-surface 
receptors to downstream mediators leading to degranulation (Cushing 2012, Puri 2012). 
In basophils, stimulation via the immunoglobulin E (IgE) Fc receptor by the addition of anti-FcεR1 antibody 
occurs through PI3K-δ, whereas stimulation with formyl-methionyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) occurs primarily 
through PI3K-γ. When these two basophil stimuli were used in whole blood, duvelisib inhibited PI3K-δ-
specific basophil degranulation with an average IC50 of 96.1 nM, and PI3K-γ-specific degranulation with an 
average IC50 of 1028 nM (Winkler et al, 2013). 
At higher concentrations, duvelisib showed activity in PI3K-β-selective biochemical and cellular assays. To 
determine the effect of duvelisib on PI3K-β activity in whole blood, platelet GPIIb/IIIa activation was 
measured after stimulation with a thrombin peptide (a PI3K-β-dependent effect). The average IC50 for 
duvelisib in this PI3K-β-specific assay was 4700 nM, indicating an approximately  4.5-fold window between 
PI3K-γ and PI3K-β inhibition in whole blood. The assay results for duvelisib are summarised below.

In a number of in vitro studies performed in support of the current application as well as a number of 
publications submitted, the effect of duvelisib on primary  malignant B-cell survival, as well as proliferation 
and migration signals in malignant B cells were shown. Dong et al. (2014) showed that duvelisib, at a 
concentration range (0.25 to 5 μM) that covers clinically relevant plasma concentrations for the patients who 
received duvelisib 25 mg twice daily, a modest induction of CLL cell cytotoxicity was observed, which was 
time- and concentration-dependent. The cytotoxic effect was independent of the patients’ Ig heavy chain 
variable region mutational status. 
The effect of duvelisib varied across the cell lines screened, with no B-cell lymphoma subtype cell line being 
universally more  sensitive to the compound. However, several of the cell lines failed to achieve a Growth 
Inhibition level of fifty percent including: GRANTA-519, KARPAS-299, OCI-Ly7, OPM-2, RL,  and RPMl-8226. 
The most sensitive cell lines to IPl-145 were TMD-8 and WSU-NHL,  which had Gl50 values of 0.5nM and 
7.5nM, respectively. Other cell lines with Gl50 values at sub-micromolar  range included: DOHH-2, Farage, 
HH, KARPAS-422, and SU-DHL-4. 
Duvelisib inhibited the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF1) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) driven M2 
polarisation of murine BMDM, as measured by Arg1 expression, in a dose-dependent manner. IPI-549, a 
PI3K-γ selective inhibitor, also inhibited Arg1 expression in a dose-dependent manner; however, IPI-3063, a 
potent PI3K-δ selective inhibitor, did not inhibit Arg1 expression when used at PI3K-δ-selective 
concentrations (1 to 100 nM).

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from CLL patients (n = 3) were used to evaluate the effect of 
PI3K inhibition on T cell migration in response to CXCL12 (C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 12 protein coding 
gene). Both PI3K δ (IPI 3063) and PI3K- γ (IPI-549) selective inhibitors were used to delineate the PI3K 
isoform-dependency on this migration. Results showed that CXCL12-induced T cell migration was most 
potently inhibited by the PI3K-γ selective inhibitor, IPI-549, with an average EC50 of 17 nM compared with 
IPI-3063, a PI3K-δ-selective inhibitor, that was the least active with an average EC50 of 630 nM.

In the in vitro studies of PI3K-γ inhibition, the migration of tumour-supportive T cells in response to CXCL12 
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from CLL patients showed an IC50 of 128 nM and the 
inhibition of MCSF1 and IL-4 driven M2 polarisation of murine bone marrow-derived myeloid cells showed an 
IC50 of 4 – 15 nM.  
The in vivo inhibition of tumour volume in the DoHH2 murine xenograft model showed an inhibition of tumour 
volume of about 66% at a free Cmax serum level of 140 nM duvelisib. The unbound duvelisib plasma Cmax 
of 47 nM would be sufficient to inhibit macrophage polarisation (IC50 = 4-15 nM), which is a PI3K-γ-
mediated function.  
In the whole blood assay, the IC50 for inhibition of PI3K-γ in basophils was 1.03 µM (429 ng/mL), which is 
below the reported clinical Cmax of 3.6 µM, and also below the Cmax of 2.3 µM based on the PopPK 
simulations.

In vivo proof of concept 
Only one proof of concept in vivo study was submitted. In Study report IPI-145-021, it was shown in a 
DoHH2 human transformed follicular lymphoma murine xenograft model, that duvelisib at 50 mg/kg po BID 
gave a significant inhibition of tumour growth, compared to either a PI3K-δ inhibitor (IPI-3063) or PI3K-γ 
inhibitor (IPI-549) administered alone (PO, at 10 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg respectively).

Secondary pharmacodynamic  studies 
Duvelisib and the major  metabolite IPI-656 were tested against a broad panel of kinases, where duvelisib 
primarily  showed activity against PI3K and no other kinases tested. IPI-656 showed slight binding to ALK, 
however, in a subsequent study, no binding was observed at concentrations up to 30µM. 
PI3K inhibitors (especially PI3K-α and PI3K-β) have been shown to elevate blood glucose and blood insulin 
levels in rats. Therefore, duvelisib was tested in rats at 30 and 100 mg/kg/day following single administration 
or administration on 5 consecutive days. No effect on plasma glucose or insulin levels were observed at the 
30 mg/kg/day dose level, whereas at 1000 mg/kg/day, or following administration of a PAN-PI3K-inhibitor, 
increased blood glucose or blood insulin levels were observed following OGTT. Similarly,  hyperglycaemic and 
hyperinsulinaemic response was observed following IGTT. The observation of hyperglycaemic and 
hyperinsulinaemic effects were at duvelisib exposure levels where all PI3K-receptors (including PI3K-α and 
PI3K-β) were all inhibited to some extent, whereas at the lower dose, where PI3K-δ, PI3K-γ were selectively 
inhibited, no such effects were observed.

Safety pharmacology  programme 
In vitro hERG channel inhibition was studied for both duvelisib and the major  human metabolite IPI-656. 
hERG potassium inhibition IC50 values for duvelisib and IPI-656 was found to be 49.8µM and >100µM 
respectively. Based on the free fraction of duvelisib and IPI-656 in the clinical setting following administration 
of 25 mg BID, the applicant calculated safety margins of 1060- and 2600-fold respectively.  
Core battery safety pharmacology was performed in rats (CNS and respiratory systems) at a single oral dose 
of duvelisib of 0, 5, 50, and 350 mg/kg. The dose levels administered were the same as those used in the 
GLP 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study in the rat.  
No duvelisib-related effects were observed in the FOB parameters for up to 24 hours post dose. However,  in 
the high dose group (350 mg/kg), significant decreases in locomotor activity was observed in the figure 8 
maze at 2 hours post dose, however, no concurrent effects were observed in locomotor  activity or arousal in 
the FOB arena at 2 hours post dose.  
No duvelisib-related effects on respiratory parameters,  including respiratory rate, tidal volume, and minute 
volume was observed at any dose level in male rats.  
The in vivo cardiovascular safety study was performed in non-naïve telemetered cynomolgus monkey 
receiving duvelisib at an oral dose of 0, 5, 30, and 150 mg/kg. No statistically significant treatment related 
effects were observed on cardiovascular parameters.  Toxicokinetic data from the GLP 4-week study was used 
to describe the exposures achieved in the in vivo safety pharmacology studies. 
Pharmacodynamic  drug interactions 
No studies or discussion on pharmacodynamic drug interactions were included (see discussion on non-clinical 
Pharmacology).

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods 
Bioanalytical methods were developed for the GLP general toxicity and reproduction toxicity studies. The 
bioanalytical method for duvelisib (IPI145) based on a solvent extraction procedure followed by LC-MS/MS 
(rat, monkey, rabbit)  was successfully validated. All four pivotal general toxicity studies included ISR,  which 
came out with 87.8-100% acceptance.   
The LC-MS/MS methods used to determine duvelisib in the single dose pharmacokinetics in mice and dogs 
and in the repeated dose pharmacokinetics in the mouse (for studying the anti-tumour activity of duvelisib in 
the B-cell lymphoma subcutaneous xenograft model; see section on pharmacodynamics) have been described 
in the individual studies. The LC-MS/MS methods for the determination of duvelisib in plasma of mice and 
dogs provided acceptable precision and accuracy for the calibration standards. Repeated dose studies have 
not been performed in dogs. 
14C-Labeled duvelisib was used in in-vitro and in vivo metabolism  and distribution studies. Metabolite 
characterisation was accomplished by LC-MS/MS in conjunction with liquid scintillation counting. 
Permeability and transport 
Duvelisib exhibited moderate membrane  permeability.  In a Caco-2 cell monolayer assay, the apparent 
permeability  values at 10 μM were 2.5 x 10-6 cm/sec and 31 x 10-6 cm/sec for A>B and B>A assays, 
respectively. A concentration-dependent active B to A efflux with efflux, ratios ranging from 13 to 4.2 was 
observed over a concentration range of 3 to 100 μM duvelisib. Duvelisib is a substrate of P-gp. Therefore, 
intestinal absorption is expected to be affected by concomitantly given P-gp inhibitors. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The single dose pharmacokinetics of duvelisib has been studied in BALB/c mice, Sprague Dawley rats, beagle 
dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. Duvelisib was rapidly absorbed after oral administration in mice, rats, dogs 
and monkeys.  
In mice, the bioavailability of duvelisib was low (7%) and Tmax was 0.08 h. Following IV administration, 
duvelisib was rapidly eliminated, with a high clearance (5.25 L/h/kg) and a short plasma half-life (0.22 h). 
The volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was moderate (1.14 L/kg), which is two times greater than 
total body water (0.6 L/kg). This indicates that in mice duvelisib is not extensively distributed into tissues. 
In rats, duvelisib was rapidly absorbed following oral administration with Tmax values that ranged from 1 to 4 
hours. The bioavailability was moderate to high (57%). Cmax and overall exposure (AUC0-last) increased 
approximately  dose proportionally  in the dose range of 30 to 300 mg/kg.Following IV administration, 
duvelisib was rapidly eliminated, with a clearance of 1.83 L/h/kg and a plasma half-life of 0.73 h. The Vss 
was moderate (1.66 L/kg), which is 2.7 times greater than total body water (0.6 L/kg). This indicates that 
also in rats duvelisib is moderately distributed into tissues. 
In dogs, the oral absorption of duvelisib was rapid. Duvelisib in solution (5% NMP [N-methyl-2-pyrrolidine], 
60%PEG 400 and 35% water) showed a bioavailability  of 97% and a Tmax of 3 hours, whereas in duvelisib in 
assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236249/2021 
Page 29/206 
 
  
  
 
 
suspension (5% NMP and 95% water) showed a bioavailability  of 40% and a Tmax of 1 hour. Following 
intravenous administration, duvelisib in an aqueous NMP/cyclodextrin solution showed a low clearance (0.85 
L/h/kg), a small volume of distribution (0.13 L/kg) and an elimination half-life of 2 hours. Duvelisib in an 
aqueous PEG 400 solution showed a clearance of 3.23 mL/min/kg, a small volume of distribution (0.49 L/kg) 
and an elimination half-life of 1.83 hours. 
In monkeys, the bioavailability was 40%. Tmax was 1.5 hours. From 30 to 300 mg/kg, Cmax and overall 
exposure (AUC0-last) increased approximately  dose proportionally.  At the tested oral dose of 5 mg/kg, the 
administration duvelisb in a capsule formulation led to a three times lower  plasma exposure and Cmax values. 
The clearance was low (0.4 L/h/kg), the volume of distribution was moderate (1.27 L/kg) and the elimination 
half-life was 5 to 6 hours.  
There were no relevant differences between males and females in pharmacokinetic parameters.   
In human, duvelisib showed a bioavailability of about 40%, a Tmax of 1 to 2 hours and a low volume of 
distribution (12.3 L, ~0.18 L/kg) for healthy subjects. In subjects with advanced hematologic malignancies, 
the apparent volume of distribution (Vss/F) was 28.5 L (~0.44 L/kg) (see clinical assessment report). 
The repeated dose pharmacokinetics of duvelisib and IPI-656 were determined in the Sprague-Dawley rats, 
New Zealand White rabbits, and cynomolgus monkeys, which were the animal species and strains used in 
toxicological evaluation of duvelisib. 
In rats, after repeated oral administration, exposure was generally greater than dose proportional. 
In the 5 days study, the exposure to duvelisib was dose proportional  in males or slightly greater than dose 
proportional  in females over the tested doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg. The exposure to the metabolite IPI-656 
was proportional  or less than dose proportional.  Exposure to duvelisib was about 2-fold higher in females 
compared to males but exposure to IPI-656 was about 2-fold higher in males compared to females. The IPI-
656/duvelisib exposure ratios were less than 0.01 in males and females indicating low exposure of IPI-656 
relative to duvelisib. 
In the 28-day study, exposure was greater than dose proportional.  Modest accumulation of duvelisib was 
noted with AUC0-24 h ratios of 2 and 1.4 for males and 2 and 1.3 for females for doses of 5 and 50 
mg/kg/day, respectively. In the 13-week study, the exposure to duvelisib was much greater than dose 
proportional  over the tested doses of 0.5, 5 and 25 mg/kg/day. For a 10-fold increase in dose between 0.5 
and 5 mg/kg/day exposure increased by more than 20-fold, and for 5-fold increase in dose between 5 and 25 
mg/kg/day exposure increased by more than 10-fold except for the female rats on Days 28 and 91 where the 
increase in exposure was dose proportional.  Minor accumulation (≤2.0-fold) was observed and the steady-
state exposure (28 days) in females was approximately  2-fold the exposure observed in males. 
In pregnant rabbits at 75 mg/kg, the IPI-656/duvelisib exposure ratio was approximately  0.71 indicating that 
the exposure to IPI-656 was only slightly lower than that of duvelisib in the rabbit.  In a definitive EFD study 
in rabbits over gestational Days 7 through 20, duvelisib exposure increased with increasing dose on gestation 
Day 7 with accumulation ratios of 19, 8, and 4 for dose levels of 10, 25, and 75 mg/kg/day, respectively, on 
gestation Day 20. 
In monkeys, after daily repeated administration for 5 days, duvelisib exposure increased in a generally dose 
proportional  manner, but not for IPI-656 for which Cmax was less than dose proportional.  Duvelisib and IPI-
assessment report

656 showed some accumulation (up to 2-fold). Exposure was slightly higher in males compared to females. 
Exposure to the metabolite was generally higher (up to 2-fold) than to the parent. 
In the 28-days study, duvelisib exposure increased more than dose-proportionally over the 5 mg/kg to 30 
mg/kg dose range and less then proportionally  over the 30 mg/kg to 150 mg/kg dose range. Accumulation 
ratios ranging from 2.7 to 6.1. In the 13-weeks study, at dose levels of 0.2 to 5 mg/kg/day, accumulation 
ratios ranged from 0.9 to 2.2 for the low and mid dose groups (0.2 and 1 mg/kg/day) up to 7 to 10 for the 
high dose group (5 mg/kg/day). No consistent gender difference was noted in duvelisib plasma exposure. 
Plasma protein binding 
Duvelisib is highly bound to plasma proteins, with unbound fractions being dependent on species and 
concentration ranging from 1-100 μM. The concentration-dependence of the unbound fraction in plasma was 
high in monkeys (8.0–23.2%) and rabbits (3.8-12.2%) and less marked in rats (11.1-14.2%) and mice (5.5-
8.4%). At 10 μM, the duvelisib free fraction was 13.4% in monkeys, 9.6% in rabbits,  11.4% in rats, 6.0% in 
mice.  
The percent free fraction of duvelisib in humans is estimated to be 1.3%. There was no concentration 
dependency in protein binding over the clinically relevant concentration range of 1 to 10 μM. 
IPI-656 is more highly protein-bound than duvelisib. At 1 µM, the free fraction was 5.2% rabbits,  4.5% in 
rats, 3.1% in mice, 0.4% in monkeys and 1.3% in humans. Concentration dependency was only observed in 
the monkeys. 
Tissue distribution 
The tissue distribution of duvelisib was investigated in Sprague Dawley rats (non-pigmented) and Long-Evans 
Rats (pigmented).  
The results showed that duvelisib is distributed to most tissues, with the exception of the brain and lens. The 
highest concentrations were observed in tissues that are involved in the metabolism and excretion of 
duvelisib, including the contents of the gastrointestinal tract and urinary bladder, the lining gastrointestinal 
mucosa, the urinary bladder and bladder wall, the liver and bile duct, followed by the kidney cortex and 
medulla. In pigmented rats, there was an increased concentration of duvelisib in the uveal tract of the eye 
and some retention of duvelisib in pigmented tissue, which suggests that duvelisib binds to melanin. 
Duvelisib did not exhibit significant partitioning into red blood cells (RBCs) in vitro or in vivo in rat, monkey or 
human. 
The potential of duvelisib to cross the placenta and the potential excretion into milk have not been studied. 
These studies are not warranted for anti-cancer drugs. 
Metabolism 
In vitro studies 
The primary  metabolic pathways were phase I oxidation and phase II glucuronidation.  
CYP3A4 was the primary  enzyme in phase I metabolism of duvelisib. CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and/or CYP2C8 may be 
involved to a lesser extent in the formation of duvelisib metabolites.  Glucuronidation, as a major  part of 
assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236249/2021 
Page 31/206 
 
  
  
 
phase II metabolism  of duvelisib, was primarily  mediated by UGT1A4 with minor contribution by UGT1A3 and 
UGT1A9. Duvelisib has a low propensity to form reduced forms of glutathione-conjugated metabolites in rat 
and human liver microsomes  in the presence NADPH regenerating system. In liver microsomes and 
cryopreserved hepatocytes, duvelisib was metabolised slowly by rat, moderately by dog and human, and 
extensively by mouse and monkey. Across all species, twenty metabolites were identified (M1 up to M20). 
No disproportionate or human-specific metabolites were identified. With the exception of M7 and M10 (both 
N-glucuronide conjugates of duvelisib), all metabolites detected in human hepatocyte incubations were also 
detected in at least two animal hepatocyte incubations, including at least one of the toxicology species (rat 
and monkey). M7 and M10 were not unique human metabolites,  since they were also seen in vivo in 14C-
duvelisib mass balance studies: M7 and M10 in rats and M7 in monkeys. 
In in-vitro incubations with hepatocytes, duvelisib exhibited moderate to high hepatic extraction (extraction 
ratio >0.3) in the dog and mouse, and low to moderate hepatic extraction in the rat, monkey, and human 
(extraction ratio ≤0.3).   
In-vivo studies 
IPI-656 (M17) is the major metabolite of duvelisib in plasma  of rats, monkeys and human. This metabolite, 
which is a mono-oxidation product, has no pharmacologically relevant activity (Section 2.1 
Pharmacodynamics).  
The concentration of duvelisib and its metabolites in plasma were determined following oral administration of 
14C-duvelisib in rats and monkeys at doses of 5 mg/kg and in heathy humans at 25 mg (≈0.4 mg/kg).  
In rats, 14C-duvelisib accounted for 88.5% and 88.1% of the circulating radioactivity in plasma  of male and 
females, respectively. The two main circulating metabolites were M17 at levels of 1.39% in males and 0.79% 
in females and M4 (glutathione related) at levels of 1.66% in males and 1.15% in females. 
In monkeys, 14C-duvelisib accounted for 16.7% and 20.3% of the circulating radioactivity in plasma of males 
and females, respectively. There were three main circulating metabolites, including were M17 (18.3% in 
males and females), M24 (7.69% in males, 4.12% in females) and unknown peak 1 (UNK1) (purine-related, 
7.61% in males,  7.99% in females). Although unambiguous identification could not be made, it is thought 
that the metabolites comprising this region are polar  metabolites potentially originating from liberation of the 
adenine motif from duvelisib with subsequent processing through purine metabolic pathways. 
In human, duvelisib accounted for 37.7% of the circulating radioactivity following a single oral dose of 25 mg 
duvelisib (+ 2.8 µg 14C-duvelisib) intravenously. The major  circulating metabolite was M17 (45.8%), followed 
by the minor metabolite M7 (3.99%) which is a glucuronate conjugate of duvelisib. 
Excretion 
The primary  clearance mechanism of duvelisib was CYP450-mediated metabolism.  The major elimination 
pathway for duvelisib and duvelisib metabolites (including IPI-656) was the faeces via the hepatobiliary 
route. 
In the rat, monkey, and human, the mean percentage of administered radioactivity excreted in the faeces 
was 94%, 78%, and 79%, respectively, with the remaining radioactivity recovered in the urine. (3%, 4% and 
14%, respectively). The primary  duvelisib-related residues in the plasma and faeces were duvelisib and IPI-
656.  
assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236249/2021 
Page 32/206 
 
  
  
 
 
In bile duct-cannulated rats, a majority  of absorbed duvelisib-related radioactivity was excreted in the bile. 
Duvelisib accounted for 1-1.5 % of the dose in bile (males and females) and for 22.3% (males) and for 
42.5% (females) in faeces. This indicates that enterohepatic circulation of duvelisib does not play a relevant 
role.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
 One exploratory single dose study was performed in the cynomolgus monkey. The study also included a 
phase with 7 days administration, which is discussed below in the repeat dose study section.

Single administration of duvelisib at doses of up to 500 mg/kg/day was well tolerated.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
In the repeat dose studies, the rat and cynomolgus monkey were selected as the nonclinical species. The 
cynomolgus monkey was chosen as the non-rodent species, due to the metabolite profile appearing more 
comparable  to the human, than dog. In rats, 14 days treatment (non GLP study), 28 days and 13-week 
studies were performed,  the latter two according to GLP. With regards to dose selection in the rodent studies, 
the dose levels selected for the subsequent 28-day study in rats, appear  above the MTD in the 14-day study, 
as extensive clinical signs as well as mortality of high dose animals in the 14-day study (Study SDI00004) 
was observed following 7 and 8 days of administration of 300 mg/kg duvelisib. However,  a change of vehicle 
was also introduced, which would amount in less exposure than the vehicle used in the shorter duration 
study, which is why the high dose level selected in the consecutive 28-day GLP study (Study No 805097) was 
even higher (350 mg/kg/day). Although lower exposures were anticipated, and hence the clinical signs would 
be expected to be less severe, dosing was discontinued by day 6 or 7, due to mortalities  and moribundity (10 
animals found dead, and 8 additional being euthanised).

In cynomolgus monkeys, the single dose study also included a 7-day fixed dosing period, and the results are 
presented below in the table. 
In the rodent GLP repeat-dose studies the following parameters and end points were evaluated: clinical 
observations/signs, body weights, food consumption, ophthalmology, clinical pathology (haematology, 
coagulation, clinical chemistry, urinalysis), toxicokinetic parameters,  gross necropsy findings, organ weights, 
and histopathologic examinations. 
In the cynomolgus monkey GLP repeat-dose studies the following parameters  and end points were evaluated: 
morbidity,  mortality, clinical observations/signs, body weights, food evaluation, ophthalmology, ECG, clinical

In general, in both rat and cynomolgus monkey, the primary,  on-target effects of duvelisib were observed at 
all dose levels. Findings involve the immune system characterised by depletion of lymphoid cells in the 
lymphoid tissues, e.g. spleen, thymus, lymph nodes and gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and 
decreased immune function, obvious especially in the monkey as many opportunistic infections were 
observed in both the 28-day and 13-week studies. Severe toxicity was observed at dose levels at 50 mg/kg 
and above in rat, and at 5 mg/kg and above in monkey. 
Exposure margins for the findings related to duvelisib has been summarised with Cmax and AUC values and 
compared to human exposure at the MHRD, resulting in exposure margins. Similarly,  exposure of the major 
metabolite IPI-656, at the NOAEL in the pivotal toxicity studies have been presented. 
For most findings related to duvelisib treatment, the exposure margins were relatively low, especially 
considering the total exposure, whereas somewhat higher exposure margins were achieved when free 
duvelisib was considered, due to high plasma protein binding in the clinical setting. With regards to the 
exposure to the major  metabolite IPI-656 at the NOAEL levels of the pivotal toxicity studies, both free and 
total exposure margins were mostly below 1, e.g. the exposure to IPI-656 is higher in the clinical setting.

Genotoxicity 
The genotoxicity of duvelisib was assessed in two in vitro tests as well as one in vivo test. The AMES’s test 
showed that duvelisib did not cause gene mutation in the bacteria strains tested, at concentrations of up to 
5000µg/plate. The two chromosome  aberrations tests performed (on in vitro in human PBL) and one in vivo 
study in rats treated with duvelisib for 3 consecutive days, showed no or a slight increase in micronuclei in 
the in vivo test. In the in vivo micro nucleus test in rats, duvelisib tested weakly, but significantly positive in 
males only at the 350 mg/kg/day dose (p<0.05) for percentage of micronuclei. This was not observed in 
assessment report

female rats, for which exposure tends to be approximately  2-fold higher than in male rats in the repeat-dose 
toxicity studies. In addition, the free plasma exposure multiple at this dose was more  than 200 fold exposure 
at MRHD. The increase was also within the historical negative control of the laboratory,  constituted a slight 
increase and was only observed at the high dose.   
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed, (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Reproduction  Toxicity 
Reproductive toxicity has only been examined in embryo-foetal development studies. The lack of fertility and 
early embryonic development as well as any pre-and post-natal development or juvenile studies is acceptable 
based on the intended patient population and advanced cancer indication. Effects on testes were observed in 
the repeat dose toxicity studies, please see above.  
Embryo-foetal developmental toxicity studies were performed in rats and rabbits, according to ICH S5(R2). 
Toxicokinetic sampling were included in both DRF and definitive rabbit studies, and in the definitive rat study. 
Animals showed exposure. In both DRF studies, the higher dose groups showed unacceptable maternal 
toxicity, including mortality or animals euthanised in extremis (doses of 150 and 275 mg/kg/day in rat, and 
100 and 200 mg/kg/day in rabbits). In the rat, doses of 50 mg/kg/day gave rise to decreased body weights 
(4,7%) on GD20, lower gravid uterus weight, and decreased mean foetal weights (-16.7-18,4%), as well as a 
few skeletal variations and anasarca in one foetus, all of which was considered to be incidental findings within 
expected background findings.  
As of the above results, final dose levels in the rat was set at 5, 10, 35 mg/kg/day, and at 10, 25 and 75 
mg/kg/day in the rabbit.  In the rat, the only finding of the study was slightly lower  mean foetal weights at 
the high dose of 35 mg/kg/day, of 7.7% M, 5.6% F, 5.4% M+F when compared to concurrent control. The 
body weights observed were however, within historical controls.  
In the rabbit study, similarly  almost no adverse findings were observed, apart from one high dose female, 
which aborted on GD 18. Prior to the abortion, a number of clinical observations were made, including; body 
weight loss, severely reduced food consumption, decreased defecation, brown material around anogenital 
area, red material in the cage pan prior  to abortion. However,  as the animal was the only one exhibiting 
clinical signs and aborted, the findings regarding this animal was considered to be incidental by the study 
director, as all other treated animals’ parameters were generally similar  to control animals. The exposure 
margins have been based on the DRF studies (dose levels of 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg, for rat and rabbit 
respectively).  
Toxicokinetic  data 
A human AUC0-24h of 15.776 µg.h/mL was used to establish animal/human exposure margins. This value was 
extrapolated from the human AUC0-12h of 7.888 µg.h/mL observed in study 02. In addition, exposure margins 
were corrected for the free fraction in plasma  (10.9% (rat), 6.7% (rabbit),  8.8% (monkey), and 1.3% 
(human)). In the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rat exposure multiples at the NOAEL were below free plasma 
concentration duvelisib at MRHD of 25mg BID for males and between 2-7-fold for females. In cynomolgus 
monkeys, exposure margins were well below free plasma concentration duvelisib at MRHD. Main effects

observed to establish the NOAEL were related to the expected pharmacology of duvelisib. In addition, effects 
on testes were observed in male rats. At the same dose level, in female rats exposure was often 
approximately  2-fold exposure in male rats.  
Other  toxicity  studies 
Metabolites 
The human major  metabolite IPI-656 was also present in the nonclinical species used. The ratio of IPI-656 to 
duvelisib in rats, monkeys, and rabbits was 0.01, 1.43, and 0.71, respectively. Albeit in most instances the 
exposure margins obtained for IPI-656 was less than 1X clinical setting at the NOAEL or HNSTD.  
Impurities 
There are 4 impurities discussed in the nonclinical part of the dossier. The proposed limit of 1.0 % of the R 
enantiomer of duvelisib (IPI-490473) has been sufficiently justified. The R-enantiomer was present at 5.6 or 
0.8 % in the repeat-dose toxicity studies (4-week and 13-week duration respectively) in both nonclinical 
species. It was furthermore present at a level of 5.3% in the test article lot used for the genotoxicity studies. 
The three impurities 2-ETHP, 2-HTHP and IPI490506 were all tested in AMES test, following equivocal results 
in the in-silico analysis for these three compounds. All three impurities/starting material  were found to be 
negative in the AMES tests, hence as a result, IPI-490506 is treated as non-mutagenic impurity (ICH M7 
Class 5). This approach is supported and the proposed limit of ≤ 0.15% w/w,  is accepted, as it does not 
exceed the limits for impurity qualification based on ICH Q3A. 
Phototoxicity 
Duvelisib was tested both in vitro and in vivo due to absorption of light between wavelengths of 290 and 
700 nm and distributes to both skin and eyes based on whole body autoradiography study results in male 
Long-Evans rats. The in vitro 3T3 assay indicate that duvelisib has phototoxic potential. In the in vivo study, 
duvelisib was administered to rats at 5, 50 and 350 mg/kg/day for three days. A subsequent single exposure 
to 10 J/cm2 of UVA, elicited cutaneous reactions indicative of phototoxicity (erythema, oedema) in the lightly 
and/or darkly pigmented skin sites in the 350 mg/kg/day group with UVR exposure. No adverse cutaneous 
reactions were observed in the low- or mid-dose duvelisib groups. There was no evidence of ocular 
phototoxicity, either by ophthalmologic evaluation or histopathologic evaluation, at any duvelisib dose. The 
NOAEL for phototoxicity in this study is the mid-dose of 50 mg/kg/day.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental  risk assessment 
The stepwise refinement of the Fpen in order to achieve a PECsurfacewater below the trigger value of 
0.01µg/L was performed. Phase I calculations result in a refined PECsw of 0.0111 µg/L. This value is just 
above the trigger value. The LogKow value of 2.57 was determined with the shake flask method, hence no 
further PBT assessment of duvelisib is triggered.  
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following points to be addressed:

The refinement of the Fpen is not supported. The applicant agreed to perform  a Phase II assessment post-
authorisation and will submit an updated ERA once the required studies have been performed and provide the 
expected submission date. A timeline of 24 months was given for completion of the studies specified below. 
The following studies must be committed to: 
•  Adsorption-desorption using a batch equilibrium method (OECD 106) using 3 soil types and 2 types of 
sewage sludge;  
•  Ready biodegradability test (OECD 301);  
•  Aerobic and anaerobic transformation in aquatic sediment systems (OECD 308);  
•  Algal growth inhibition test (OECD 201);  
•  Daphnia sp. reproduction test (OECD 211, use version 2012);  
• 
•  Activated sludge, respiration inhibition test (OECD 209, use version 2010)  
• 
Fish, Early Life Stage Toxicity Test (OECD 210);  
For all studies the original study report must be submitted. Please note that from all requested chronic 
toxicity studies and the OECD 209 test, a NOEC and/or EC10 is needed for the risk assessment. In case a 
limit test is performed, the OECD guidelines should be followed: if the limit test results in a statistically 
significant effect, a new test to determine a dose-response relationship should be performed, from which a 
NOEC and/or EC10 should be reported. Depending on the outcome of Tier IIA,  the following additional studies 
might be required for Tier IIB: 
•  Aerobic and anaerobic transformation in soil (OECD 307);  
•  Soil Micro-organisms: Nitrogen Transformation Test (OECD216);

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical  aspects 
Duvelisib is a dual inhibitor of class I phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-δ and PI3K-γ. However, the inhibition 
of PI3K-β is in the same order as that of PI3K-γ, and both are much lower  than that of PI3K-δ. According to 
the Clinical Study Report  IPI-145-02, the Cmax of duvelisib in humans at the intended dose of 25 mg BID is 
3.6 µM, of which the free fraction is 47 nM. This is well above the Kd of PI3K-β (1.56 nM), relatively close to 
the enzymatic IC50 (85 nM) and well above the IC50 of the 786-O cellular assay. Therefore, the high 
specificity suggested by the applicant of duvelisib for only PI3K-γ and PI3K-δ seems questionable, and the 
inhibition of PI3K-β may also play a role in the complicated effects of duvelisib. 
Two in vitro assays and one in vivo assay showed specific PI3K-γ inhibition by duvelisib, however, the effects 
were shown at only slightly lower or even higher free concentrations of duvelisib than the free Cmax 
concentration in humans of approximately  47 nM. Therefore, it is suspected that the contribution of the PI3K-
γ related effects will possibly be less than of the PI3K-δ related effects. In the murine xenograft model of 
transformed follicular lymphoma,  the tumour growth is only decreased by about a half, at a free Cmax of 
about 140 nM, which is higher than the free Cmax of 47 nM in humans. These results suggest that duvelisib 
is not a very potent anticarcinogen. Although the proof of concept has been shown through in vitro and in 
vivo studies, the true potential of duvelisib as an anticancer drug has to be determined on the basis of clinical 
efficacy data.

Measurements with a large panel of diverse kinases, G-protein-coupled receptors, ion channels and 
transporters, revealed no possible effects on other targets besides inhibition of PI3K-γ and PI3K-δ by 
duvelisib. Furthermore, there are no non-clinical safety pharmacology issues found. In safety pharmacology 
studies, the in vitro hERG test showed a potential for hERG potassium inhibition. However, when taking into 
consideration the free fraction of duvelisib, safety margins were calculated to be in excess of 1000 and 2600 
for duvelisib and the major  metabolite IPI-656 respectively. In vivo cardiovascular studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys did not reveal treatment related effects.  
Duvelisib distributed to very large extent to the small intestinal wall (100 times higher than plasma 
radioactivity). Other organs with relatively high radioactivity was liver and kidney with tissue/plasma ratios of 
24-41 for the liver and 9 in kidney after 1 hour. This should be seen in context of very common adverse 
reactions associated diarrhoea/colitis grade 3 or more as well as hepatotoxicity observed as transaminase 
increased grade 3 or more observed as common and all grades as very common adverse reactions to 
duvelisib (SmPC). To put this into context for the benefit/risk assessment, distribution studies in rat show 
that duvelisib may be present in wall of the small intestines at up to 100 times higher concentration as 
compared to the target organs of pharmacological effect, namely blood and bone marrow. 
Overall, the primary  pharmacodynamic studies provided adequate evidence that the dual PI3K-δ and PI3K-γ 
inhibitory effect of duvelisib may synergistically inhibit tumour growth, when compared to PI3K-δ or PI3K-γ 
inhibition alone. 
From a pharmacokinetic point of view, the choice of rat and cynomolgus monkey considered appropriate  for 
the nonclinical efficacy and safety studies. Duvelisib distributed to very large extent to the small intestinal 
wall (100 times higher than plasma radioactivity), which may correlate with the high frequency of GI adverse 
effects observed in the clinical setting. 
The Cynomolgus monkey was chosen over the dog as a non-rodent species for repeat-dose toxicity testing, 
due to the metabolite profile of the monkey being more comparable  to the human.   
Brief summary of findings in the repeat-dose toxicity studies, including adverse effects related to expected 
pharmacology was added to section 5.3 of the SmPC. The toxicology studies performed, conform with the 
guidance given in ICH S9, for advanced cancer indications.   
In the general toxicity studies, the primary  effects of duvelisib observed included lymphoid depletion with a 
functional impact (decrease in B cells in peripheral blood, decrease in TDAR, and occurrence of secondary 
infections/inflammation), decreased erythropoiesis, and testicular degeneration/atrophy. Pancreatic, vascular, 
and hepatic changes were also noted in some duvelisib toxicology studies. The nonclinical toxicities observed 
in rats and monkeys following duvelisib administration are consistent with the reported nonclinical effects of 
the PI3K-δ inhibitor, idelalisib, which is approved in the treatment of CLL and FL. The findings are reflected in 
the SmPC.  
In the 28-day repeat dose study in rats, severe toxicity was observed in the high dose group of 350 
mg/kg/day. This resulted in the cessation of dosing in this group, following 10 animals being found dead, and 
a further 8 moribund animals being euthanised. However,  this study was preceded by a 14-day study, where 
similar severe toxicities were observed, in the high dose group, where the animals received only) 300 
mg/kg/day.  
Regarding reproductive toxicity studies, the definitive embryofoetal development studies did not show any 
toxicity towards. However, embryofoetal toxicity was observed in the preliminary studies, in presence of 
severe maternal toxicity (dose levels above 150 mg/kg/day in rats, and 100 mg/kg/day in rabbits), but only 
assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236249/2021 
Page 46/206 
 
  
  
at exposures above 25-fold the MHRD. The findings are suggested not to be presented in the SmPC, due to 
the findings only being present at high exposure multiples, based on free duvelisib. This approach is in line 
with the ICH S5 (3) guideline.    
Overall the toxicology studies revealed that duvelisib had effects on the immune system, characterised by 
depletion of lymphoid cells in spleen, lymph nodes, thymus and GALT, and decreased immune function was 
especially obvious in the cynomolgus monkey where many opportunistic infections were observed. The 
preliminary  (EFD) studies showed severe maternal toxicity, resulting mortality,  as well as complete resorption 
of foetuses or abortions in rats and rabbits respectively. These changes were observed at exposures (based 
on free fraction) at 25-fold or above the clinical exposure at the MHRD. In the definitive EFD studies, no 
significant toxicity to reproduction was observed, at dose levels corresponding to approximately  33 and 22 -
fold the clinical exposure (high dose groups in both rat and rabbit studies respectively). Hence the observed 
reproductive toxicity is at exposures above what is considered clinically relevant, according the ICH S5(R3).  
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in rat and cynomolgus monkey, adverse effects were mainly related to 
expected exaggarated pharmacology, including adverse effects on lymphoid tissues, bone marrow  and 
haematology parameters at exposures of free duvelisib at 8 to 16 fold, corresponding to total duvelisib at 2 
to 11 fold Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 25 mg BID in human. 
The genotoxicity of duvelisib was assessed in two in vitro tests as well as one in vivo test. The AMES’s test 
showed that duvelisib did not cause gene mutation in the bacteria strains tested, at concentrations of up to 
5000µg/plate. In the in vivo micro nucleus test in rats, duvelisib tested weakly, but significantly positive in 
males only at the 350 mg/kg/day dose (p<0.05) for percentage of micronuclei; the increase was also within 
the historical negative control of the laboratory,  constituted a slight increase, was only observed at the high 
dose and could be related to indirect PI3K inhibition effects, as this has been associated with bone marrow 
toxicity characterised by erythroid hypoplasia and pyknotic erythroid cells with nuclear fragments that were 
consistent with apoptosis. Inhibition of PI3K has previously been associated with apoptosis of erythroid 
progenitors in vitro, and the process of apoptotic nuclear fragmentation (karyorrhexis/pyknosis) is similar to 
that of erythrocyte enucleation, which may lead to apoptotic fragments in a small number of cells described 
as micronuclei resulting from chromosome breakage.  Taken together with the evidence provided, it is agreed 
that the results from the in vivo genotoxicity test are to be considered negative. Carcinogenicity studies have 
not been conducted with duvelisib, which is acceptable in accordance with the ICH S9 guidance. 
In dose range finding and pivotal embryo-foetal developmental toxicity studies in rat and rabbit,  duvelisib 
(free fraction)  induced embryo-foetal developmental toxicity only at free plasma exposures margins of  >25 
fold of 25 mg BID in human (MRHD), corresponding to 4 to 5 fold total plasma concentrations).  
Fertility studies with duvelisib were not conducted. Histological findings in male and female rats were 
observed in the repeat dose toxicity studies and included testis (seminiferous epithelial atrophy, decreased 
weight, soft testes), and epididymis (small size, oligo/aspermia) in males and ovary (decreased weight) and 
uterus (atrophy) in females. 
The ERA provided concluded that the PECsw exceeded the action limit of 0.01 µg/L.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion  on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical aspects of duvelisib are sufficiently studied and the main findings are reflected in the SmPC 
section 5.3.

Methods 
•  Bioanalytical analysis 
PK blood samples were collected and analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS) method for quantification of plasma  duvelisib and its metabolite IPI-656. The methods for duvelisib 
and IPI-656 analysis in plasma and urine were adequately validated in accordance with the guideline on 
bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09).  
•  Non-compartment data analysis 
Noncompartmental analyses (NCA) were used for the estimation of plasma duvelisib and IPI-656 PK 
parameters  in all studies except the two pivotal studies, IPI-145-06 and IPI-145-07.  
• 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis  
The provided population PK analysis utilised pooled PK data collected from 13 studies and included a total of 
806 subjects with 16737 concentration records. The purpose of the population PK model and analyses was to 
estimate population PK parameters,  inter- and intra-subjective variabilities, covariates, and to characterise 
exposure-response relationships. 
• 
Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model-based analysis 
PBPK modelling and simulations using Simcyp were aimed to support dosing recommendation for co-
medication of duvelisib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. In addition, the PBPK model was also used to assess 
the inhibition potential of duvelisib and IPI-656 on CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 substrates. PBPK modelling was further 
used to estimate the exposure of duvelisib and IPI-656 at steady-state in subjects with hepatic impairment. 
PBPK modelling using GastroPlus was used to estimate the effect of co-medication of proton pump inhibitors 
on the exposure of duvelisib.  
assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236249/2021 
Page 58/206 
 
  
  
 
PBPK modelling was used to support the proposed dosing reduction to 15 mg BID if strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
are co-administered with duvelisib. After thorough assessment, the PBPK model has been deemed adequate 
for the various simulations for which it has been used.  
Absorption 
A tmax of ~1 hour was demonstrated in healthy subjects following single-dosing of duvelisib in a dose range 
of 1-30 mg, indicating rapid absorption of this drug.  
Figure 8 mean IPI-145 plasma concentration-time profiles following administration of increasing single doses 
of IPI-145 in healthy subjects (Study IPI-145-01) 
When comparing duvelisib administered as an oral capsule with duvelisib administered as an IV infusion 
(study IPI-145-05), the absolute bioavailability of duvelisib was estimated to be 42%. 
Duvelisib exhibited moderate membrane  permeability  in Caco-2 cells and was shown to be a substrate for 
Pgp and to lesser extent also a substrate for BCRP. Duvelisib is a weak base with pKa values of 3.65 and 9.93 
and has a pH-dependent solubility profile with low solubility at pH>3.  In simulated gastric fluid the solubility 
of duvelisib was high 4.52 mg/ml based on a dose of 25 mg.

Influence of food 
A food effect was observed in terms of a reduction in Cmax of 10-37% and a delay in tmax from 1 to 3-4 
hours, whereas a minimal  impact on AUC for duvelisib was evident.

Source: Study  IPI-145-15  CSR Table  16  (modif ied) 
The food effect was also addressed in the provided population PK analysis, and overall,  the food effect was 
described to cause a modest decrease in Cmax with minimal impact on expected AUC (see section 2.1.8 of 
this AR). As no clinically meaningful food effect seems to be evident in terms of overall duvelisib exposure, 
the omission of precautions with respect to concomitant food intake is considered acceptable. 
Bioequivalence  
The duvelisib capsule formulation was changed during the clinical development. Duvelisib drug product A 
(DP-A “clinical-trial formulation”) was developed initially and used in Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies, including 
a pivotal Phase 2 clinical study (Study IPI-145-06). Duvelisib drug product B (DP-B “market-image 
assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236249/2021 
Page 60/206 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
formulation”) was developed later and used in Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical studies (including pivotal Study IPI-
145-07), bioequivalence Study IPI-145-15, and primary  (registration) stability studies. No bioequivalence 
(BE) studies have been conducted to compare the proposed intermediate strength 15-mg duvelisib capsule 
with the clinically used 5-mg strength duvelisib capsule, which has been addressed in the Quality AR. 
Duvelisib 25 mg 
For the 25 mg dosing, the market-image formulation was demonstrated to be within the equivalence range of 
80% to 125% compared to the clinical-trial formulation in terms of AUC, whereas the upper bound of the 
90% CI for Cmax (104.04% to 133.10%) exceeded the standard upper limit of 125%. The geometric mean 
ratio (GMR) and 90% confidence interval (CI) between the Test formulation (market image) and the 
Reference formulation (clinical-trial) for duvelisib PK parameters  of interest (AUClast, AUCinf, and Cmax) are

Distribution  
The mean Vss at steady state following IV dosing in healthy subjects were estimated to 12.3 L (Study 
IPI-145-05) and the mean apparent volume of distribution (Vss/F) was 28.5 L at 25 mg twice daily (BID) in 
subjects with advanced hematologic malignancies (Study IPI-145-02). Steady state plasma concentration for 
duvelisib (BID dosing) was reached on or prior  to day 11.  
The estimated whole blood to plasma  duvelisib ratio of ~0.5 from the same study indicates a limited 
distribution to blood cells. 
In vivo protein binding of duvelisib was comparable  in plasma obtained from subjects with hematologic 
malignancies and healthy subjects (Report IPI-145-016). There was a tendency of a higher free fraction of 
duvelisib in subjects with severe hepatic impairment  (2.1%) compared to healthy subjects (1.0%) (Report 
IPI-145-014). 
Elimination 
In healthy subjects, mean clearance (CL) was estimated to 4.1 L/h with a half-life (t½) of 9 hours. Following 
oral dosing in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies, mean duvelisib apparent clearance and 
terminal t½ for 25 mg BID were 4.2 L/h (57% CV) and 4.7 h (57% CV), respectively. 
Excretion 
Duvelisib and its metabolites are primarily  excreted in faeces with minimal renal excretion. The total recovery 
of administered radioactivity (mean ± SD) was 92.5 ± 2.2%; with 79.0 ± 2.2% and 13.5 ± 1.8% in faeces 
and urine, respectively. In faeces, 10.9% of the radioactivity was recovered as unchanged duvelisib (Report 
RPT03070) and less than 1% of the administered dose was excreted in urine as unchanged duvelisib. 
Metabolism 
CYP3A4 is the primary  cytochrome P450 in the metabolism  of duvelisib. In addition, CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and/or 
CYP2C8 may to a lesser extent be involved in the formation of selected IPI-145 metabolites, whereas 
duvelisib is not metabolised by CYP2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 2E1.

Metabolite profiling (report RPT03070) of plasma,  urine and faeces was conducted in study IPI-145-05 
following administration of 25 mg 14C-duvelisib. More than 85% of the radioactivity in plasma has been 
identified with IPI-656 (45.8%), duvelisib (37.7%) and M7 (4.0%), a glucuronide metabolite.  These three 
moieties were the most abundant in urine ranging 1 to 2% of the administered dose. More than 25 
radioactivity peaks or regions were observed in faeces. Even though duvelisib and IPI-656 were the most 
abundant moieties,  they accounted for ~12% and 17.7% of the administered dose in the excreta, 
respectively. The mono-oxygenated metabolite M20 and the glucuronide metabolite M7 appear  to be the less 
important pathways with recoveries of 7.4% and 3.8% respectively, while many more metabolites were 
recovered at low levels 2-3% or less (CYP1A2, 2B6 and 2C8 involvement). 
Mean metabolite  (IPI-656) to parent (M/P) ratio based on AUC varied between 0.88 to 1.3 in healthy subjects 
following single dose and between 0.99 and 1.21 at steady-state (studies IPI-145-01, IPI-145-05, M15-412). 
In patients, metabolite  to parent (M/P) ratio at steady-state was 0.95 and 1.0 for 25 mg bid and 1.10 for 75 
mg bid (study IPI-145-02 and M15-460). 
Inter-conversion 
As no metabolic transformation occurs at or near the stereocentre of duvelisib, metabolism-dependent chiral 
conversion is considered unlikely.  
Pharmacokinetics of metabolite IPI-656 
In vitro investigations have demonstrated IPI-656 to be pharmacologically inactive ((7244-fold less potent 
against PI3K-δ compared to duvelisib) at relevant exposure levels in terms of effect on PI3K-δ, and thus, of 
limited clinical relevance. 
Pharmacokinetics of IPI-656 has been evaluated in most studies alongside the pharmacokinetics of duvelisib. 
IPI-656 appeared slowly in the systemic circulation. IPI-656 median Tmax was approximately 4-6 h. After 
reaching peak levels, mean IPI-656 concentration values declined in an apparent mono-exponential manner. 
Mean t1/2 ranged from 13.7 to 15.7 h. Following multiple oral administrations of duvelisib IPI-656 exhibited 
flat plasma concentration-time profiles. IPI-656 plasma exposure AUC0-12 was approximately  3 to 4 fold 
higher at steady state compared to first administration but there was no indication for a time dependent 
pharmacokinetics of IPI-656 (study IPI-145-02). 
Dose proportionality and time-dependency 
Exposure (measured as Cmax and AUC) increased proportionally over a dose range of 1 to 30 mg (single 
dose) and 1 to 5 mg BID (multiple dose) in healthy subjects. The mean IPI-145 plasma concentration-time 
profiles on Days 1 and 14 showed a dose-dependent increase in plasma concentrations following 
administration of increasing multiple doses of IPI-145. 
Dose-proportionality was explored by plotting the

Duvelisib exposure increased upon BID dosing (AUC0-12ss:AUC0-12 first dose); an increase of 1.65 to 1.83 
was observed in healthy subjects over the dose range 1-5 mg (study IPI-145-01) and a 1.9 fold increase was 
determined for patients treated with 25 mg duvelisib BID (study IPI-145-02).   
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Mean pharmacokinetic Cmax and AUC values of duvelisib are consistent between studies and formulations. 
Between-subject variability (CV%) of AUC and Cmax was moderate to high 33% to 51% and 34% to 49%, 
respectively, for groups with 10 subjects or more. 
PopPK analysis estimated a between-subject variability (CV%) of AUC and Cmax at 50 to 70% in subjects 
with haematological malignancies.

Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Pharmacokinetics of duvelisib in subjects with advanced hematologic malignancies was investigated by non-
compartmental analysis in study IPI-145-02 and study M15-460 (Japanese patients, N=7) and by population 
PK analyses.

Special populations 
The potential impact of various intrinsic factors, including age, gender, race and bodyweight as well as renal 
or hepatic impairment populations have been examined by the use of population PK analyses. In addition, a 
dedicated clinical study has examined the pharmacokinetics of duvelisib in patients with impaired hepatic 
function, and furthermore, a PBPK model was applied for the estimation of impact of hepatic impairment on 
the exposure of IPI-145 and its primary  metabolite IPI-656 following multiple oral doses of IPI-145 25 mg 
BID.

Hepatic impairment 
Study IPI-145-014 was an open-label study to evaluate the effect of hepatic function on the 
pharmacokinetics of duvelisib. Twenty-four (24) subjects were enrolled into 4 hepatic groups (n = 6/group) 
based on Child-Pugh classification. The groups were healthy, mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment. 
All subjects had hepatic impairment  > 1 year with an aetiology of chronic alcoholism and/or chronic viral 
hepatitis (B or C). Subjects received a single dose of duvelisib 25 mg. PK blood samples were collected up to 
72 hours.  
Geometric mean AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were minimally  changed in subjects with hepatic impairment  compared to 
healthy subjects. When compared to healthy subjects, AUC0-∞ values represented an 11%, 6%, and 19% 
decrease in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment,  respectively. The ratio of 
metabolite to parent AUC decreased with increased degree of hepatic impairment  (mild: 1.03, moderate: 
0.81, severe: 0.72).

panel) mean plasma concentrations versus time (individual log (plasma concentrations) 
Using PBPK modelling duvelisib exposure following multiple dosing was predicted. The PBPK model developed 
to predict the exposure of IPI-145 and IPI-656 following oral administration and the effect of ketoconazole on 
the pharmacokinetics of duvelisib, was used together with the Cirrhosis module of SimCYP. PBPK modelling 
predicted increases in geometric mean AUC for IPI-145 in subjects with mild, moderate and severe HI 
relative to healthy age matched subjects were consistent with observed data; predicted values were 0.98-, 
1.08- and 1.03-fold, respectively, versus observed values of 0.89-, 0.94- and 0.81-fold, respectively.  
Predicted geometric mean AUC ratios for IPI-656 in mild, moderate and severe HI relative to healthy age 
matched subjects were 1.05, 0.67 and 0.41, respectively. These were similar to the observed values of 0.91, 
0.75 and 0.48, respectively. 
The PBPK model was then applied prospectively to predict the systemic exposure of IPI-145 and IPI-656 
during multiple oral dose administration of IPI-145 25 mg BID in subjects with mild, moderate and severe HI. 
Geometric mean Cmax and AUC ratios for IPI-145 (relative to healthy aged matched subjects) were 0.83 and 
0.89, 0.76 and 0.91, and 0.60 and 0.76, respectively. Geometric mean AUC ratios for IPI-656 (relative to 
healthy aged matched subjects) were 1.03, 0.65 and 0.40, respectively.  
Renal impairment 
No specific PK study has been performed in subjects with renal impairment  (see Discussion on Clinical 
Pharmacology).  
Gender, bodyweight,  race, and age 
The results from the population PK analysis point to no clinically significant differences in the PK parameters 
Cmax and AUC across subjects based on gender, bodyweight, race or age, which is considered reassuring.

Human clinical DDI studies investigating the impact of ketoconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitor), rifampin and etravine 
(CYP3A4 inducers) on duvelisib PK as well as the impact of duvelisib on midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) 
conducted were:  
•  Effect of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) on single dose duvelisib (study IPI-145-01) 
•  Effect of a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampicin) on single dose duvelisib (study IPI-145-11) 
•  Effect of a moderate CYP3A4 inducer (etravirine) on single dose duvelisib (study IPI-145-131) 
•  Effect of duvelisib at steady-state on a CYP3A4 substrate (midazolam) (study IPI-145-10) 
In addition, PBPK simulations were performed to evaluate the impact of CYP3A4 inhibitors and CYP3A4 
inducers on duvelisib PK as well as the impact of duvelisib on CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 substrates under steady-
state conditions. 
CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Physiologically-based PK (PBPK) simulations were performed to predict the impact of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
3A4 inhibitors and inducers on duvelisib PK under steady-state conditions. The predicted mean AUC ratio of 
IPI-145 after a single oral dose of 10 mg in healthy subjects as a consequence of co-administration of 
ketoconazole (200 mg BID) was 3.45, which was consistent with the observed value of 3.95 in the DDI study.  
Multiple oral doses of 25 and 75 mg BID IPI-145 in oncology patients with concomitant ketoconazole (200 mg 
BID) was predicted to cause increases in IPI-145 exposure of approximately  1.59- and 1.45-fold, 
respectively, whereas predicted mean AUC ratios of IPI-145 at doses of 25 and 75 mg BID after 
coadministration the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole (200 mg QD) were 1.34- and 1.29-fold, 
respectively.  
CYP3A4 inducers 
The predicted mean AUC ratio of IPI-145 after a single oral dose of 25 mg in healthy subjects as a 
consequence of co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (600 mg QD) was 0.29, which was 
reasonably consistent with the observed value of 0.18.  
CYP3A4 substrates 
Application of the IPI-145 and IPI-656 models to predict the increase in exposure of midazolam (CYP3A4 
substrate) after a single oral dose of 2 mg in healthy subjects as a consequence of coadministration of IPI-
145 (25 mg BID for 5 days), resulted in a predicted geometric mean AUC ratio of 4.85, which was in good

agreement with the observed value of 4.29. Application of the IPI-145 and IPI-656 models at doses of 25 and 
75 mg BID IPI-145 to predict the likely outcomes of interaction with midazolam in oncology patients indicated 
increases in midazolam exposure of approximately  5.82- and 7.37-fold, respectively 
CYP2C8 substrates 
PBPK simulations were used to assess the effect of duvelisib on two CYP2C8 substrates, repaglinide and 
rosiglitazone. The predicted AUC ratios of rosiglitazone with coadministration of duvelisib 1, 5, and 25 mg 
BID in healthy subjects were 1.00, 1.00 and 1.02, respectively. Similarly,  the predicted AUC ratios of 
repaglinide with coadministration of duvelisib 25 mg BID and 75 mg BID in subjects with hematologic 
malignancies were 1.62 and 1.72, respectively.  
Impact of gastric pH on duvelisib absorption 
Duvelisib is a weak base (pKa of 3.9) with pH-dependent solubility. Solubility is reduced with increased pH 
from 1.3 to 3.9 and a GastroPlus model with PBPK simulations was used to assess the impact on duvelisib 
absorption and thus exposure with increased pH.  Increased gastric pH from 1.3 to 5 was predicted to reduce 
the absorption of duvelisib with up to ≈ 25%. In addition, in vitro data has demonstrated pH levels >3 to 
compromise  duvelisib solubility. Based on scientific literature, proton pump inhibitor treatment is known to 
elicit an increase in gastric pH to > 4 for a substantial share (50-80%) of the day. However,  popPK and 
efficacy data do not indicate an effect on AUC of duvelisib by PPIs and did not indicate any impact on the 
efficacy of duvelisib from coadministration of PPIs.   
Contraceptives 
No interaction studies with oral contraceptives have been conducted (see discussion on Clinical 
Pharmacology). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Duvelisib (IPI-145) is an oral, dual inhibitor of class I phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-δ and PI3K-γ being 
developed for the treatment of patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)/small 
lymphocytic lymphoma  (SLL), and follicular lymphoma (FL). PI3K-δ inhibition targets the survival and 
proliferation of malignant B cells, such as those derived from CLL patients. In contrast, PI3K-γ inhibition 
blocks the recruitment and differentiation of CD4+ T cells and macrophages, which in turn support the 
proliferation and survival of malignant B cells. 
Primary  and Secondary pharmacology   
The exposure-response (ER) analysis was based on PK, biomarker,  efficacy, and safety data collected from 
Studies IPI-145-01, IPI-145-02, IPI-145-06, and IPI-145-07. Population PK models were utilised to study 
exposure-response (ER) analyses and to perform  simulations for exposure-pharmacodynamic biomarkers. 
The application of the PD biomarkers CD63 expression, phosphorylated AKT,  and Ki67 for examination of the 
relationship between PK exposure and efficacy is considered reasonable.

EMA/CHMP/236249/2021 
Page 70/206 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Proof of inhibition of PI3K-δ by duvelisib came from reduction in the level of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT),  a 
direct downstream effect of PI3K inhibition, in the dose ascending study IPI-145-02. p-AKT  inhibition was 
rapid and sustained up to 24h following single dose administration and was comparable  between 25 and 75 
mg BID dose levels. An Emax model was used to describe the relationship between p-AKT  concentrations and 
plasma duvelisib concentrations. Maximal p-AKT  inhibition at day 1 estimated was 85% (2.7% CV) and at 
cycle 2 day 1 66% (7.7% CV). The estimated plasma IPI-145 concentration that would result in 50% 
inhibitory effect (EC50) on p-AKT  following a single dose was estimated to be 6.07 ng/mL (Cycle 1, Day 1) 
and was estimated to be 26.4 ng/mL following multiple doses (Cycle 2, Day 1).  
Ex vivo inhibition of basophil PI3K-δ typically reached a maximum  inhibition in blood samples obtained at 1 to 
2 hours following single dose period (studies IPI-145-01 and 02). In healthy subject a dose response was up 
to 10 mg duvelisib but in patients’ blood samples there was no difference between 25 mg and 75 mg 
duvelisib treatment apparent. The percent inhibition of blood PI3K-γ was highly variable following single and 
multiple dose administration and did not appear to be related to dose (study IPI-145-02). 
Maximal p-AKT and Ki67 inhibition were observed at plasma  concentrations achieved at the 25 mg BID dose, 
with no additional suppression of p-AKT  at higher doses/plasma concentrations.  
A simulation was applied for prediction of percentage coverage above the targeted threshold (IC50) for the 
biomarkers  p-AKT,  PI3K-δ and PI3K-γ. The duvelisib 25 mg BID regimen was estimated to ensure >99% 
coverage above the IC50 threshold for p-AKT and PI3K-δ, and ~80% for PI3K-γ. The 15 mg BID dosing 
elicited similar coverage compared to 25 mg BID in terms of p-AKT and PI3K-δ, whereas the 48% coverage 
above threshold for PI3K-γ was substantially reduced compared to the 25 mg dosing. The following table 
summarises the percentage of coverage above threshold at steady state for each biomarker. 
Table 18 Percentages (%) Coverage for Biomarkers Threshold (IC50 orIC90) at Steady-State 
Secondary pharmacology 
Cardiac repolarisation by QT interval evaluation 
Duvelisib was anticipated to have a very low potential for QTc interval prolongation on the basis of the in 
vitro assessment of hERG potassium current inhibition as well as cardiovascular safety pharmacology study 
data in monkeys showing no adverse effects in the cardiovascular system with doses up to 150 mg/kg.  
The clinical development programme  for duvelisib included no thorough QT/QTc study and the potential for 
duvelisib to prolong the QTc interval was assessed based on triplicate ECG data collected from Studies IPI-
145-01 (healthy subjects) and IPI-145-02 (patients with hematologic malignancies) collected pre-dose and 
following single/multiple dosing of duvelisib.

Based on the dataset from study IPI-145-02 including 2035 datapoints from 210 subjects with advanced 
hematologic malignancies, duvelisib exposure-QTc relationship was described by a linear drug-effect model 
with a negative slope (-0.000574 ms per ng/mL of duvelisib) and a positive intercept (3.76 ms). The lack of 
statistically significant slope (p = 0.1307) indicate a lack of relationship between duvelisib exposure and QTc 
prolongation (Report INFI-PCS-104 and Report VS27000006A). 
Overall, it is considered justified that duvelisib holds a limited and clinically non-significant potential for QTc 
prolongation.

Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were submitted. Ongoing treatment with chronic 
immunosuppressants (eg, cyclosporine) or systemic steroids > 20 mg prednisone (or equivalent) QD was an 
exclusion criterion in study IPI-145-07.

The exposure-response analysis utilised pooled data collected from 5 studies (1 Phase 1 study and 4 Phase 
2/3 studies) including patients with advanced hematologic malignancies, and patients with relapsed or 
refractory leukaemia or lymphoma.  The final ER database for analysis contained data from 552 subjects.  
In terms of safety, it is considered justified that no clear correlation exists between duvelisib exposure and 
occurrence of the majority of AEs of special interest.  
In terms of efficacy, the data do not support a higher dose than 25 mg BID. 
Graphical evaluations of ER for ORR by DISEASE are shown in Figure 8 and these point to a lack of 
relationship between exposure and ORR.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The bioanalytical methods to determine duvelisib and IPI-656 concentrations in plasma and urine have been 
adequately validated. The time course of duvelisib PK was described by a 2-compartment model with first-
order elimination and transit absorption model. The popPK  model is used for exposure-effect relationships 
and it has been modified with a time-dependent clearance and using a first-order absorption (ka). The model 
showed successfully convergence. There remains a trend for dose dependency, but the model describes the 
elimination of the 25 mg adequately. The pharmacokinetics of the metabolite in healthy subjects is better 
described with the revised model.  
PBPK modelling and simulations were aimed to support dosing recommendation for co-medication of duvelisib 
with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.  
In vivo DDI studies with ketoconazole, fluconazole, and midazolam were used to verify the model. Following 
extensive evaluation by means of sensitivity analyses the PBPK model with a fixed fraction absorbed was 
considered fit for predictions of the effect of moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors on the exposure of 
duvelisib under steady-state conditions.

The PBPK model was also used to assess the inhibition potential of duvelisib and IPI-656 on CYP3A4 or 
CYP2C8 substrates. Although a qualification on CYP2C8 inhibition should preferably conducted with more 
substrates and inhibitors as indicated in the guideline on the reporting of PBPK modelling and simulation 
(EMA/CHMP/458101/2016, mechanistically the lack of CYP2C8 inhibition is in line with PBPK modelling on 
CYP3A4 inhibition (which was verified by DDI studies with midazolam and ketoconazole). The PBPK model is 
considered fit for predictions of the effect of duvelisib as perpetrator.    
Absorption,  distribution, metabolism,  and excretion of duvelisib have overall been adequately described 
based on studies in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetic characteristics include a tmax of ~1 hour, an 
absolute bioavailability of 42% with no clinically relevant effect of concomitant food, volume of distribution at 
steady state of 12.3 L, a whole blood to plasma duvelisib ratio of ~0.5 indicating a limited distribution to 
blood cells. Duvelisib plasma  protein binding using an equilibrium dialysis method at 37°C was 95.9% at 1 
µM (Report 346N-001). Using rapid equilibrium dialysis (RED) methodology and liquid chromatography-
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for detection, duvelisib plasma protein binding was 98.7% at 1 µM 
and 10 µM.  
CYP3A4 is the primary  cytochrome P450 in the metabolism  of duvelisib with the major  metabolite IPI-656 
being pharmacologically inactive at relevant exposure levels, and thus, of limited clinical relevance. 
CYP3A4*22 is associated with low hepatic CYP3A4 expression and activity, however, the impact of the 
CYP3A4*22 allele to increase duvelisib exposure may be limited because duvelisib is a low extraction drug 
and multiple pathways contribute to the elimination of duvelisib. Duvelisib and its metabolites are primarily 
excreted in faeces with minimal  renal excretion. In subjects with advanced hematologic malignancies, the 
volume of distribution was reported to be 28.5 L and the t½ 4.7 hours at steady-state. 
In healthy subjects (study 01, M15-412), accumulation of duvelisib was ~1.5 comparing AUCtau (multiple 
dose) with AUC0-inf (single dose) in the dose range 1 to 5 mg bid. This indicates a change in 
pharmacokinetics with repeated dosing, which may be caused by time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 by 
duvelisib.  
Duvelisib has one chiral centre and is administered as S-duvelisib. As no metabolic transformation occurs at 
or near the stereocentre of duvelisib, metabolism-dependent chiral conversion seems unlikely.  
In vitro studies demonstrated CYP3A4 to be the primary  CYP enzyme responsible for duvelisib metabolism 
with both duvelisib and IPI-656 being determined as direct inhibitors of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 as well as 
metabolism-dependent inhibitors of CYP3A4. The results from in vitro studies indicate a low likelihood for 
DDIs between duvelisib and IPI-656 and substrates as well as inhibitors of intestinal, renal, or hepatic 
transporters.  
Relevant human clinical DDI studies investigating the impact of ketoconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitor), rifampin 
and etravine (CYP3A4 inducers) on duvelisib PK as well as the impact of duvelisib on midazolam (CYP3A4 
substrate) were conducted based on the findings from these non-clinical investigations; Study on the effect of 
a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) on single dose duvelisib; a study on the effect of a strong CYP3A4 
inducer (rifampicin) on single dose duvelisib , a study on the effect of a moderate CYP3A4 inducer (etravirine) 
on single dose duvelisib and a study on the effect of duvelisib at steady-state on a CYP3A4 substrate 
(midazolam).  
In addition, PBPK simulations were performed to evaluate the impact of CYP3A4 inhibitors and CYP3A4 
inducers on duvelisib PK as well as the impact of duvelisib on CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 substrates under steady-

state conditions. The applicant has based on the PBPK model reported co-administration of duvelisib 20 mg 
BID with the moderate CYP3A inhibitor fluconazole to elicit similar IPI-145 exposures compared to 25 mg BID 
duvelisib monotherapy; hence, no dose adjustment of duvelisib is necessary in case of concomitant use of 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. The above effects are reflected in the SmPC including dose recommendations for 
concomitant use with strong 3A4 inhibitors.   
Co-administration with a strong CYP3A inducer decreases duvelisib area under the curve (AUC), which may 
reduce COPIKTRA efficacy. In the SmPC section 4.5 it is recommended to avoid co-administration of 
COPIKTRA with strong CYP3A4 inducers. In terms of CYP3A4 substrates the SmPC states that “Co-
administration with COPIKTRA increases AUC of a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, which may increase the risk of 
toxicities of these drugs. Consider reducing the dose of the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate and monitor for signs 
of toxicities of the co-administered sensitive CYP3A substrate”. The recommendations in terms of reduced 
dosing of sensitive CYP3A4 substrates as well as monitoring for signs of toxicity when in case of concomitant 
treatment with duvelisib are considered reasonable.    
In vitro data suggested that duvelisib and IPI-656 are direct inhibitors of CYP2C8 enzyme. No clinical study 
was conducted due to the limited number of narrow therapeutic drugs predominantly metabolised by 
CYP2C8. Instead, PBPK simulations were used to assess the effect of duvelisib on two CYP2C8 substrates, 
repaglinide and rosiglitazone. The predicted AUC ratios of rosiglitazone with coadministration of duvelisib 1, 
5, and 25 mg BID in healthy subjects were 1.00, 1.00 and 1.02, respectively. Similarly,  the predicted AUC 
ratios of repaglinide with coadministration of duvelisib 25 mg BID and 75 mg BID in subjects with 
hematologic malignancies were 1.62 and 1.72, respectively.  
No information regarding CYP2C8 substrates is included in section 4.5 of the proposed SmPC. No interaction 
studies with oral contraceptives have been conducted. For the current indication no study will be requested 
as the mean age of the patient population was 64 years. As effectiveness of oral contraceptives is uncertain, 
it has been adequately described in section 4.6 of the SmPC that women using hormonal contraceptives 
should add a barrier  method. This is acceptable, and the absence of an interaction study with oral 
contraceptives has been added in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
Based on the dataset from study IPI-145-02 including 2035 datapoints from 210 subjects with advanced 
hematologic malignancies, duvelisib exposure-QTc relationship was described by a linear drug-effect model 
with a negative slope (-0.000574 ms per ng/mL of duvelisib) and a positive intercept (3.76 ms). The lack of 
statistically significant slope (p = 0.1307) indicate a lack of relationship between duvelisib exposure and QTc 
prolongation. Overall, it is considered justified that duvelisib holds a limited and clinically non-significant 
potential for QTc prolongation. 
A dedicated clinical study examined the pharmacokinetics of duvelisib in patients with impaired hepatic 
function, whereas the potential impact of various additional intrinsic factors, including age, gender, race and 
bodyweight as well as renal impairment  have been examined by the use of population PK analyses. A similar 
exposure seems to exist in patients with hepatic impairment  compared to healthy subjects.   
No specific PK study has been performed in subjects with renal impairment,  but less than 1% of an 
administered dose of duvelisib is excreted in urine as unchanged duvelisib. The results from the population 
PK analyses point to no clinically significant differences in PK parameters  across subjects based on gender, 
bodyweight, race or age, which is considered reassuring. Based on the provided data, the statement in the 
SmPC regarding dose adjustment in renal impairment is considered acceptable.  
assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236249/2021 
Page 76/206 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The population data from the clinical studies including hematologic patients estimated similar  duvelisib 
exposure in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment as compared to healthy subjects, which is 
considered reassuring. Duvelisib and metabolites are primarily  excreted in faeces and < 15 % recovered in 
urine. No dose adjustment is recommended for subjects with mild and moderate impairment; however, 
caution should be taken in subjects with severe and end-stage renal impairment (with or without dialysis). 
The weight range in the clinical studies is wide and a fixed dose as proposed is considered acceptable.  
The results from in vitro studies indicated a low likelihood for DDIs between duvelisib and IPI-656 and 
substrates as well as inhibitors of intestinal, renal, or hepatic transporters.   
Relevant human clinical DDI studies as well as PBPK modelling were performed to investigate the impact of 
ketoconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitor), rifampin and etravine (CYP3A4 inducers) on duvelisib PK as well as the 
impact of duvelisib on midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) and repaglinide and rosiglitazone (CYP2C8 substrates). 
The main route of elimination for duvelisib is metabolism  followed by excretion in faeces. CYP3A4 is involved 
in formation of most metabolites including IPI-656, which is the major  metabolite. The importance of CYP3A4 
in the elimination of duvelisib was supported by the interactions with ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor), 
which increased duvelisib exposure approximately  4-fold. Due to time-dependent CYP3A4 auto-inhibition, 
duvelisib susceptibility to moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is decreased under steady-state conditions 
and it is recommended to reduce the dose of duvelisib to 15 mg BID when co-administration with strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors is required. Co-administration of rifampicin (strong CYP3A4 inducer) decreased duvelisib 
exposure by 5-fold. Co-medication with strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended. These interactions 
have been adequately reflected in the SmPC. Due to the higher duvelisib and IPI-656 exposures in patients 
compared to healthy subjects, midazolam exposure is estimated to increase > 5-fold. Hence, duvelisib and its 
major  metabolite, IPI-656, are considered strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and co-administration may lead to 
increased serum concentrations of the other. Concomitant treatment of duvelisib with sensitive CYP3A 
substrates should be avoided and alternative medicinal products that are less sensitive to CYP3A4 inhibition 
should be used if possible.     
PBPK modelling was used to justify absence of in vivo drug-drug interaction studies with CYP2C8 substrates. 
Simulations showed a low probability for a clinically meaningful DDI between duvelisib and CYP2C8 
substrates, hence a DDI study with a CYP2C8 substrate can be waived.   
The SmPC has been adequately updated concerning the used of co administration of duvelisib with moderate 
CYP3A inducers. 
Duvelisib (IPI-145) is an oral, dual inhibitor of class I phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-δ and PI3K-γ.  
The exposure-response (ER) analysis was based on PK, biomarkers  (CD63 expression, phosphorylated AKT, 
and Ki67), efficacy, and safety data collected from studies IPI-145-01, IPI-145-02, IPI-145-06, and IPI-145-
07. Population PK models were utilised to study exposure-response (ER) analyses and to perform simulations 
for exposure-pharmacodynamic biomarkers.   
Maximal p-AKT as well as Ki67 inhibition were observed at plasma concentrations achieved at the 25 mg BID 
dose, with no additional suppression at higher doses/plasma concentrations. A simulation was applied for 
prediction of percentage coverage above the targeted threshold (IC50) for the biomarkers  p-AKT, PI3K-δ and 
PI3K-γ. The duvelisib 25 mg BID regimen was estimated to ensure >99% coverage above the IC50 threshold 
for p-AKT and PI3K-δ, and ~80% for PI3K-γ. The 15 mg BID dosing elicited similar coverage compared to 25 
mg BID in terms of p-AKT and PI3K-δ, whereas the 48% coverage above threshold for PI3K-γ was 
substantially reduced compared to the 25 mg dosing.

In terms of safety, it is considered justified that no clear correlation exists between duvelisib exposure and 
occurrence of the majority of AEs of special interest.  
The clinical development programme  for duvelisib included no thorough QT/QTc study, as it was argued by 
the applicant that the presented data provides sufficient evidence in terms of no duvelisib-mediated QTc 
prolongation at supratherapeutic doses. In study IPI-145-02 following multiple dosing with duvelisib up to 75 
mg BID, there was no correlation between duvelisib or IPI-656 plasma  concentrations and change in QTc 
interval. Overall, it is considered justified that duvelisib holds a limited and clinically non-significant potential 
for QTc prolongation. 
Given the patient population likely to be taking this medicine will largely be elderly, the applicant was 
requested to investigate possibilities to administer the drug product to patients who have problems  with 
swallowing the capsules. Based on the available clinical data (comparative plasma profiles for six healthy 
male subjects administered 25 mg duvelisib as capsules and 25 mg duvelisib as oral solution), the 
bioequivalence between the product administrated as whole capsule and the capsule content suspended in 
soft food cannot be concluded. In addition, as described in the Quality section, chemical stability studies of 
the drug substance in different types of soft food is missing. The potential for certain soft foods to be an 
effective means of oral delivery of the drug for patients with swallowing difficulties needs further 
investigation. Taking into account the Reflection paper on the pharmaceutical development of medicines for 
use in the older population EMA/CHMP/QWP/292439/2017 (October 2020), and the draft  guidance available 
from the US FDA, Use of Liquids and/or Soft Foods as Vehicles for Drug Administration: General 
Considerations for Selection and In Vitro Methods for Product Quality Assessments (July 2018), the Sponsor 
expects that all the age levels in the geriatric population (as per ICH E7, people aged 65-74, 75-84 and 85+ 
years) would be included in any future proposed instructions on alternative methods of administration.   
The selection of the BID dosing regimen was based on the PK properties of duvelisib observed in study IPI-
145-02. Duvelisib has a mean plasma t1/2 of 6.8 hours and BID administration was chosen over QD 
administration to maintain trough concentrations above the targeted IC50 for PI3K-δ and PI3K-γ inhibition. 
The selection of duvelisib 25 mg BID in CLL and FL was based on the efficacy, safety, and PD data obtained 
from Study IPI-145-02 (see also Clinical efficacy section); the 75 mg BID dose did not provide any additional 
clinical benefit compared to 25 mg BID. The selection of the 25 mg BID dose was further supported by the 
pharmacodynamic analyses on biomarkers  as well as pharmacokinetic analyses in terms of trough 
concentrations above the targeted IC50 for PI3K-δ and PI3K-γ inhibition.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions  on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacology of duvelisib and its major  metabolite IPI-656 have been extensively characterised in both 
healthy subjects and subjects with advanced hematologic malignancies.   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
In order to explore alternative administration of duvelisib, the applicant will assess the potential for certain 
soft foods to be an effective means of oral delivery of the drug for patients with swallowing difficulties across 
all the age levels in the geriatric population (as per ICH E7, people aged 65-74, 75-84 and 85+ years) in 
order to improve future proposed instructions on alternative methods of administration. When supportive 
data have been obtained, a variation application will be submitted to revise the Product Information 
regarding additional advice on the method of administration.

2.5.  Clinical  efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The selection of the dose and regimen of duvelisib monotherapy for Phase 2 and 3 studies was based on 
available preclinical data and data obtained from two clinical studies, Study IPI-145-01 (a Phase 1 single and 
multiple ascending dose study in healthy subjects) and Study IPI-145-02 (a Phase 1 dose escalation and 
expansion study in subjects with advanced hematologic malignancies). 
Selection of twice daily dosing 
The selection of the twice daily dosing regimen was based on the pharmacokinetic properties  of duvelisib 
observed in both IPI-145-01 and IPI-145-02. Duvelisib has a mean plasma half-life of 6.8 hours (Study IPI-
145-01), and twice daily administration was chosen over once daily administration to maintain trough 
concentrations above the targeted IC50 for PI3K-δ and PI3K-γinhibition. The IC50 determinations were based 
on human whole blood assays, in which duvelisib was shown to inhibit PI3K-δ-specific degranulation of 
basophils with an average 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 96.1 nM, and PI3K-γ-specific 
degranulation of basophils with an average IC50 value of 1028 nM. 
Selection of 25 mg BID 
The selection of duvelisib 25 mg BID in CLL/SLL was based on the pharmacodynamic, efficacy, and safety 
data obtained from Study IPI-145-02 (n = 210). This study included a Dose Escalation Phase (3+3 design), 
in which duvelisib was administered from 8 mg to 100 mg BID, with 75 mg BID determined to be the 
maximum  tolerated dose based on a 1-month observation period. This study also included several Expansion 
Cohorts in select hematologic malignancies where subjects received either 25 mg or 75 mg BID. 
In this study, clinically meaningful activity was observed in subjects with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL 
receiving 25 mg BID, with no demonstrable additional efficacy benefit attained with higher doses in either 
population.

Treatments 
Subjects were subsequently randomised returned to the clinic on Day 1 to receive their first dose of study 
drug (either duvelisib or ofatumumab). The first treatment cycle for each treatment arm was 3 weeks (21±2 
days). Subsequent treatment cycles were 4 weeks (28±4 days). 
Subjects randomised to duvelisib monotherapy self-administered duvelisib orally, 25 mg BID continuously in 
28-day cycles with the exception of Cycle 1. The first dose of duvelisib monotherapy was in clinic on Day 1, 
initiating Cycle 1 of treatment. Subjects returned for a second clinical visit on Day 8±2. Cycle 1 was 21 days, 
with all subsequent cycles 28 days in length. Cycle 2 had clinic visits on Day 1 and on Day 15±2. Each 
subsequent cycle (Cycle 3-7) and then every odd cycle (Cycle 9 to 19) had only one clinic visit on Day 1. 
Subjects were instructed to take each dose of duvelisib at approximately  the same times every day. Missed 
doses were not made up. At clinic visits where blood was drawn for PK, the morning dose of duvelisib was 
administered in-clinic.

Subjects received duvelisib continuously for 18 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, 
whichever came first. After completing approximately  18 cycles of treatment with duvelisib, subjects with 
stable disease or better may have received additional treatment with duvelisib based on the judgement of the 
Investigator.

Subjects randomised to ofatumumab received 8 weekly IV infusions, starting with an initial dose of 
ofatumumab of 300 mg followed by 7 weekly doses of 2000 mg. Thereafter, subjects received 2000 mg 
ofatumumab once every cycle for 4 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, whichever 
came first. Administration of ofatumumab was not to exceed the 12 doses (within 7 cycles) as described in 
the prescribing information. After dosing with ofatumumab was complete (ie, through Cycle 7 or ETT), 
subjects continued to have clinical assessments every odd cycle (Clinical Assessment Period) through Cycle 
19 Day 1 or until disease progression, subject withdrawal, or initiation of additional anticancer treatment. 
After Cycle 19 Day 1, disease response assessments continued every 6 cycles from randomisation or until

assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236249/2021 
Page 83/206 
 
  
  
 
• To evaluate the PK of duvelisib and, if applicable,  its metabolite(s) 
Exploratory Objectives 
Exploratory objectives of this study were: 
• To evaluate the health-related quality-of-life (QoL) of subjects 
• To evaluate pharmacodynamic biomarkers  of duvelisib 
• To evaluate biomarkers that may predict duvelisib clinical activity and/or safety 
• To evaluate mechanisms of resistance in subjects who exhibit disease progression while being treated with 
duvelisib or ofatumumab 
• To evaluate genomic features of tumours predictive of response in subjects treated with duvelisib or 
ofatumumab 
Outcomes/endpoints 
PFS was defined as the time from randomisation to the first documentation of progressive disease as 
determined by independent review or death due to any cause. Disease response and progression status were 
determined via the modified IwCLL criteria for subjects with CLL.  
Efficacy endpoints for Study IPI-145-07 were defined as follows: 
Primary 
• 
Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from randomisation to the first documentation of 
PD or death due to any cause as assessed by the IRC 
Secondary  
•  Overall response rate (ORR), defined as a best overall response (BOR) of complete 
response/remission (CR), CR with incomplete marrow  recovery (CRi), partial response/remission 
(PR), or PR with lymphocytosis (PRwL), according to either IWCLL or IWG criteria with modification 
for treatment-related lymphocytosis 
•  Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from randomisation to death due to any cause 
•  Rate of lymph node response (LNR), defined as a ≥ 50% decrease in the sum of product diameters 
(SPD) of target lymph nodes  
•  Rate of haematologic improvement,  defined as any of following maintained for ≥ 60 days without 
transfusion or exogenous growth factors: 
  Neutrophil count > 1,500/µL OR an increase of ≥ 50% from baseline 
  Haemoglobin > 11 g/dL OR an increase of ≥ 50% from Baseline 
  Platelet count > 100 000/µL OR an increase of ≥ 50% from Baseline 
•  Duration of response (DOR), defined as time from the first documentation of response to the first 
documentation of PD or death due to any cause 
assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236249/2021 
Page 84/206 
 
  
  
Both disease response and progression status were determined by an independent blinded panel of 
radiologists and oncologists (ie, IRC). Responses were also assessed by the study Investigator. Disease 
response was per modified IWCLL/IWG criteria, with the following modifications: (1) an additional category 
was added to allow for PR with lymphocytosis (PRwL); and (2) the criteria for PD did not include PD based 
only on worsening lymphocytosis or isolated increase in target lesion(s) in the absence of other objective 
evidence of disease progression.  
Confirmatory imaging review by the central reader was required prior  to discontinuing a subject from the 
study due to PD. All disease response assessment data, including peripheral blood, physical examination, 
disease-related constitutional symptom,  and CT scan data, were used in determining an individual subject’s 
disease response and/or progression status. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Eligible patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either ofatumumab or duvelisib. The randomisation was 
stratified by the presence of 17p deletion, prior  progression within 12 months after previous purine analogue-
based therapy, and the presence of Grade 4 cytopenia at Baseline.  
Sample size  
Approximately  300 eligible patients were planned to be randomised 1:1 to duvelisib or ofatumumab arms to 
achieve ≈ 90 % power to detect a HR of 0.6. The sample  size calculation was based on the one-sided log-
rank test at an alpha level of 0.025. One interim analysis was planned using the Lan-DeMets spending 
function for O’Brien-Fleming boundary for the alpha spending function.  
Statistical methods 
The primary  efficacy analysis was based on ITT population, including all randomised subjects who were 
designated to treatment group according to randomisation. The PP analysis set included all patients in the ITT 
analysis set without violating the protocol in a way that could affect the study outcome. The PP analysis was 
used for secondary analysis for selected efficacy analyses. The definition of the analysis sets and how they 
were applied is agreed. 
For assessing the difference in IRC-PFS between the two arms,  a log-rank test stratified by the randomisation 
factors was used. A Cox proportional  hazards model stratified by the randomisation factors was used to 
calculate the HR. Patients with no adequate baseline, patients with no adequate post-baseline disease status 
assessment unless death occurs prior  to first post-baseline assessment, and patients without documented 
progression or death before data cut-off were censored. Patients who started a new anticancer treatment 
before documented PD were also censored, as well as patients with documented progression or death 
following a long gap between adequate disease status assessments. To assess the impact of the censoring 
rules, a sensitivity analysis mimicking a worst-case scenario where subjects alive without documented 
progression by data cut-off and who are “lost to follow-up” are censored if they are on the control arm and 
treated as having a PFS event if they are on the experimental arm.  In order to assess the robustness of the 
results, additional analyses were planned: INV-PFS, unstratified analysis, the same analysis performed using 
the AT and PP analysis set and event free survival. 
The applicant performed several additional analyses to assess the robustness of the results and the effect of 
the censoring. The primary  endpoint PFS will be tested at an overall one-sided alpha of 0.025. One interim 
analysis for early stopping due to efficacy was planned for PFS when 50% of the target PFS events were 
observed. This IA also included the option of stopping the trial due to futility. If PFS was significant, then the

key secondary endpoints ORR and OS would be sequentially tested in a hierarchical approach. For OS, two 
interim analyses were planned after approximately  24, 58 and 166 OS events. A Lan-DeMets alpha spending 
function with an O’Brien-Fleming stopping boundary was implemented to consider the interim analyses.

Conduct of the study 
Main protocol amendments included: Exclusion criterion 15 stating that: “Baseline QTcF >480 ms (average of 
triplicate readings) was amended as in Amendment 1: Baseline QTcF exclusion criterion has been changed 
from >480 ms to >500 ms: “This change is based on updated safety data from ongoing clinical trials with 
IPI-145; based on new QTc data, there was no justification for the lower threshold.” However in amendment 
2: The QTcF exclusion criteria has changed from QTcF > 500 ms to > 480 ms: Changed the baseline QTcF to 
480 ms per FDA request.   
Protocol amendment no.3 related to the number of duvelisib cycles:  
• 
• 
The maximum number of duvelisib treatment cycles (39 cycles) has been removed to permit subjects 
experiencing clinical benefit after 39 cycles to continue duvelisib treatment until disease progression 
or unacceptable toxicity 
The criteria for receiving additional duvelisib beyond Cycle 19 have been modified to reflect potential 
clinical benefit of a stable disease (SD) response. Previously, subjects with SD were also required to 
have persistent lymphadenopathy > 50% of baseline (with at least 1 target lesion ≥ 1.5 cm in 
diameter) but with a peripheral blood ALC ≤ 50% of baseline (or < 4,000/μL). These additional 
requirements have been removed such that subjects with an SD response at Cycle 19 day 1 may 
continue duvelisib treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity

PFS per IRC Sensitivity Analysis 1  
In this sensitivity analysis of PFS, subjects who discontinued treatment and did not have a documented PFS 
event were re-classified as an event at the time of last adequate disease assessment. The results of this 
sensitivity analysis showed a median PFS for duvelisib of 10.6 months (95% CI: 9.1, 12.8) and for 
ofatumumab of 9.0 months (95% CI: 7.3, 9.2), with a hazard ratio of 0.52 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.66; 
p<0.0001).   
PFS per IRC Sensitivity Analysis 2  
The results of this sensitivity analysis showed a median PFS for duvelisib of 12.1 months (95% CI: 9.1, 12.8) 
and for ofatumumab of 9.0 months (95% CI:8.8, 9.5), with a hazard ratio of 0.55 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.70; 
p<0.0001).  
For the event free survival analysis, where new anticancer therapy initiated prior  to documented disease 
progression or death was considered an event and not censored, which seems like a clinically plausible 
situation, the results were similar to the primary  analysis. Median PFS for duvelisib was 12.8 months (95% 
CI: 10.3, 16.4) and for ofatumumab 9.3 months (95% CI: 9.0, 10.4) (p < 0.0001). The hazard ratio for 
duvelisib vs ofatumumab was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.36, 0.61).

CI: 0.27, 0.59). For patients with only 1 prior  therapy the median PFS was 12.7 months (95% CI: 9.1, 17.8) 
for duvelisib versus 12.0 months for ofatumumab (95% CI: 9.6, 12.8) with a hazard ratio of 0.8 (95% CI:

Subjects Refractory/Early  Relapse to Purine Analogue-Based Therapy 
Patients refractory to or with an early relapse after purine analogue-based therapy (stratification factor at 
randomisation) have a dismal prognosis. In study IPI-145-07 the median PFS for these patients for duvelisib 
was 10.4 months (95% CI: 9.0, 16.6) and for ofatumumab 8.1 months (95% CI: 3.4, 10.4)). The hazard 
ratio for duvelisib vs ofatumumab was 0.51 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.96). In patients not refractory/early relapse to 
prior  purine analogue-based therapy the median PFS for duvelisib was 15.1 months (95% CI: 12.7, 17.8) 
and for ofatumumab 10.8 months (95% CI: 9.3, 12.6). The hazard ratio for duvelisib vs ofatumumab was 
0.53 (95% CI: 0.38, 0.73).   
Subjects with unmutated IGHV 
An analysis of PFS in subjects with unmutated IGHV was also performed.

contraindicated. 
assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236249/2021 
Page 114/206 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
o  For subjects who progressed within 2 months of initiating last prior  chemotherapy, a repeat 
biopsy to confirm histology was to be performed,  unless medically contraindicated. 
•  Subjects must have disease that is refractory to a chemotherapy regimen or RIT. The chemotherapy 
regimen (with or without rituximab) must have contained at least 1 alkylating agent or purine nucleoside 
antagonist. Refractory is defined as either: 
o 
Lack of a CR or PR while receiving the chemotherapy regimen or RIT or: 
o  Progressive disease (PD) within 6 months of the last dose of the chemotherapy regimen or 
RIT documented by computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) obtained within 6 months after the last dose 
Subjects exhibiting clinical progression within 6 months after the last dose of a chemotherapy 
regimen or RIT who were unable to undergo CT, PET/CT, or MRI within the 6-month 
timeframe were allowed up to an additional 30 days to confirm radiologic progression.  
•  Subjects must have disease that is refractory to rituximab.  (see table 23 below)   
• 
• 
• 
Lack of a CR or PR during treatment with a full course of single-agent rituximab (≥ 4 doses of 375 
mg/m2, weekly) or ≥ 2 doses of ≥ 375 mg/m2 of rituximab in combination with chemotherapy 
PD within 6 months of the last dose of a full course of single-agent rituximab or rituximab in combination 
with chemotherapy 
PD during, or within 6 months of the last dose of, a rituximab maintenance therapy 
•  Measurable disease with a lymph node or tumour mass ≥ 1.5 cm in at least 1 dimension by CT, PET/CT, 
or MRI. 
•  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2 (corresponds to Karnofsky 
Performance Status [KPS] ≥ 60%). 
•  Adequate renal function, defined as serum creatinine ≤ 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN). 
• 
 Adequate hepatic function, defined as total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (unless elevated due to Gilbert’s 
syndrome) and AST and ALT levels ≤ 3x ULN. 
•  Negative serum or urine β human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) pregnancy test within 1 week before 
first dose of study drug if the subject is a woman of childbearing potential (WCBP) (defined as a sexually 
mature woman who has not undergone surgical sterilisation or who has not been naturally post-
menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months for women ≤ 55 years or 12 consecutive months for 
women > 55 years). 
•  Willingness of male and female subjects who are not surgically sterile or postmenopausal to use medically 
acceptable methods of birth control for the duration of the study, including 30 days after the last dose of 
duvelisib. Sexually active men, and women using oral contraceptive pills,  were also to use barrier 
contraception. 
•  Ability to adhere to the study visit schedule and all protocol requirements. 
•  Signed and dated IRB-/IEC-approved informed consent form before any study-specific Screening 
procedures were performed.

Table 45 Refractoriness to prior  therapy as eligibility requirement for study IPI-145-06 
Exclusion Criteria 
Any of the following was regarded as a criterion for exclusion from the study: 
•  Candidate for potentially curative therapies at the time of informed consent, in the opinion of the 
Investigator. 
• 
• 
Prior treatment with any PI3K inhibitor or Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. 
Prior history of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. 
•  Major surgery within 28 days before the first dose of study drug. 
• 
Prior chemotherapy, cancer immunosuppressive therapy, or other investigational agents within 4 
weeks before first dose of study drug. 
•  Ongoing treatment with chronic immunosuppressants (eg, cyclosporine) or systemic steroids > 20 
mg prednisone (or equivalent) once daily (QD). 
•  Grade 3B FL and/or clinical evidence of transformation to a more aggressive subtype of lymphoma. 
•  Symptomatic  central nervous system (CNS) NHL; a lumbar puncture was not required unless CNS 
involvement with NHL was clinically suspected. 
•  Ongoing systemic bacterial, fungal, or viral infections at the time of initiation of study treatment 
(defined as requiring therapeutic dosing of an antimicrobial,  antifungal, or antiviral agent).     Note: 
Subjects on antimicrobial,  antifungal, or antiviral prophylaxis were not specifically excluded if all 
other inclusion/exclusion criteria were met and there was no presence of active infection. 
•  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. 
assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236249/2021 
Page 116/206 
 
  
  
 
•  Baseline QTc measurements using the Fridericia’s correction method (QTcF) > 500 ms (average of 
triplicate readings). Note: This criterion did not apply to subjects with a right or left bundle branch 
block. 
• 
Prior,  current, or chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection or positive result for anti-hepatitis C 
antibody (HCVAb), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb). 
•  Unable to receive prophylactic treatment for pneumocystis, herpes simplex virus (HSV), or herpes 
zoster virus (HZV) at time of initiation of study treatment. 
•  History of chronic liver disease, such as cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis due to any cause, or suspected 
alcohol abuse (iNHL in the liver was not an exclusion criterion). 
•  Unstable or severe uncontrolled medical condition (eg, unstable cardiac function, unstable pulmonary 
condition); any important medical illness or abnormal laboratory  finding that would, in the 
Investigator’s judgment, increase the subject’s risk to participating in this study. 
•  Concurrent active malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, 
bladder cancer, or prostate cancer not requiring treatment. Subjects with previous malignancies were 
eligible provided that they had been disease-free for 2 years or more. 
•  History of stroke, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or ventricular arrhythmia requiring 
medication or mechanical control within the last 6 months prior  to first dose of study drug. 
• 
Prior surgery or gastrointestinal dysfunction that may affect absorption of study drug (eg, gastric 
bypass, gastrectomy). 
•  Use of live or live attenuated vaccines within 30 days prior to signing informed consent form. 
•  Administration of medications or foods that are strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 
(CYP) 3A within 2 weeks prior  to the first dose of study drug treatment. 
• 
Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding. 
FL patients refractory to rituximab + chemotherapy or RIT have a dismal prognosis: The applicant has stated 
that PFS decreases with additional lines of therapy and is estimated to be 1.5 years, 1.1 years, and <1 year, 
among second-, third-, and fourth-line FL patients, respectively.  
Patients with prior treatment with any PI3K inhibitor or Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor were 
excluded, which may have implications for the indication. This is discussed later. 
Treatments 
Dose modifications and dosing levels after various AEs were as in the pivotal CLL study (07). Duvelisib was 
administered orally (as capsules) twice daily in 28-day cycles throughout the study until disease progression 
or unacceptable toxicity. The starting dose was 25 mg BID, although doses may have been modified (reduced 
or held) for individual subjects experiencing toxicities assessed as at least possibly related to duvelisib or at 
the discretion of the Investigator.

Objectives 
Primary Objective 
The primary  objective of this study was to evaluate the antitumour activity of duvelisib administered to 
subjects diagnosed with iNHL  (defined as FL, SLL,  or MZL [splenic, nodal and extranodal]) whose disease is 
refractory to rituximab and to either chemotherapy or RIT.    
Secondary Objectives 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the safety of duvelisib in all subjects 
To evaluate additional efficacy parameters  in all subjects 
To evaluate the PK of duvelisib and, if applicable,  its metabolite(s) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
ORR  
ORR, with overall response defined as best response of a complete response/remission (CR) or partial 
response/remission (PR) according to the International Working Group (IWG) Criteria. The independent 
review committee assessment was used for the primary  analysis. 
Key secondary endpoints 
Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time from the first documentation of response to the first 
documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. 
Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the first 
documentation of PD or death due to any cause. 
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the date of death. 
Time to response (TTR) defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the first documentation 
of response (complete or partial).

The primary  endpoint of IRC-ORR was defined as best response of CR or PR according to the revised IWG 
Criteria (Cheson et al., 2007). The applicant formulated several key secondary endpoints: DOR, PFS, OS, TTR 
as well as several exploratory  endpoints. The choice of ORR as primary  endpoint is considered appropriate  for 
a phase 2 study, and the secondary endpoints are meaningful although difficult to interpret given the single-
arm design.   
This study aims to demonstrate the null hypothesis that the primary  endpoint ORR is ≤30% against the 
alternative that ORR is ≥45%. Approximately  120 patients are planned to be enrolled to achieve 90 % power 
at alpha level of 0.025. Of those 120 subjects, 80 will be FL. One interim futility analysis (non-binding) will be 
performed 4 months after at least 30 subjects (25% of total) have initiated treatment.  
The applicant defined as the null hypothesis an ORR equal or below 30 % responders. However,  the 
alternative hypothesis is ORR equal or larger than 45 %. It could be understood that the applicant would aim 
to ORR around 45 % but any response rate larger than 30 % would be considered successful. Furthermore, 
the applicant did not specify whether the 30 % limit should be crossed by the estimate or the lower bound of 
the confidence interval. The applicant clarified that the study was to be considered successful if the p-value 
for a 1-sided exact binomial test was significant at the 0.025 level, which would be generally consistent with 
a lower bound of a two-sided 95% CI that exceeds 30%.  
Initially the ORR was expected to be ≥ 55%: “A sample size of approximately  120 iNHL subjects with at least 
100 FL subjects with an expected ORR of 55% will have 2-sided, 95% confidence bounds of 45.7%-64.1% 
when the exact binomial method is employed. These bounds about the ORR are thought to adequately 
characterise the clinical activity of IPI-145 in this patient population” (Initial protocol April  2, 2013 page 
21/80). The applicant clarified that there were no assumptions specified regarding the ORR for the FL 
population.  
In the protocol v3 (3 Nov 2015), the null hypothesis was changed to ORR ≤30% against the alternative ORR 
≥45% and the number of FL patients to be included changed from 100 to 80. The applicant explained that 
the sample size was changed based on the accrual pattern.  
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
This is a single arm  study.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets: 
The primary  efficacy analysis was based on a modified ITT population, including all subjects who had received 
at least one dose of duvelisib regardless of diagnosis. The Evaluable Analysis Set included only patients who 
did not have major  protocol deviations, received treatment for at least 8 weeks and have adequate baseline 
and at least one post-baseline tumour assessment. The EAS was used as a secondary analysis set for 
selected efficacy analyses.  
The use of a complete ITT population as the primary  analysis population would have been preferred in order 
to preserve the ITT principle. All patients who successfully completed the screening phase were treated. 
Therefore, it is understood that a complete ITT population and the m-ITT would have been identical in this 
case.  The use of the EAS in supplementary analysis is agreed.

Interim analysis (futility) for ORR: 
This study has one primary  endpoint and several secondary endpoints. Multiplicity correction due to several 
secondary endpoints was not planned. One interim futility analysis was planned for ORR. The IA was 
scheduled around 4 months after at least 30 subjects had received duvelisib. The interim analysis was 
conducted based on the Investigator’s assessment and a recommendation on futility of the study was 
provided by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee.     
It is agreed that the IA for futility does not affect the type I error.  Since no strategy was planned to control 
for multiplicity across several secondary endpoints, those are considered exploratory. 
Primary  endpoint/ORR:  
A one-sided exact binomial  test at 0.025 was used to test ORR against the null hypothesis (% CR + PR 
≤30%). The test will be performed in the overall population (FL+MZL+ SLL).  The proportion of responders 
will be presented for the individual diseases although they will not be tested. Patients with missing or non-
evaluable response rate were set to non-responders. No sensitivity analyses were planned for the FL 
population. 
The use of the binomial test to compare the proportion  of responders is acceptable. In the result section, the 
percentage of responders for each subgroup is presented together with the 95 % CI. The applicant explained 
that the Clopper-Pearson method was used, which is agreed. The imputation of missing data as non-
responders is agreed since it is a conservative approach in a single arm trial.  
Key secondary endpoints: 
PFS, DOR and OS were analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The censoring rules for PFS and DOR 
included censoring of patients without adequate baseline assessment. Patients without adequate postbaseline 
assessment were also censored unless death occurred before their first scheduled assessment. Patients 
without documented progression or death before the data cut-off were also censored. If an event was 
documented before a long gap between assessment, those events were considered in the analysis, otherwise 
the patient was censored at the last date of assessment before the gap. Patients were also censored if they 
started a new anticancer therapy before documented progression. The censoring rules for OS included 
censoring of patients without documented death at the date of last contact. 
The use of Kaplan-Meier method for DOR, PFS and OS is endorsed. The censoring rules for PFS are not 
agreed. The applicant assumed that patients who were censored due to other reasons than still being in the 
study without experiencing an event (e.g. treatment switch, lost to follow-up) have similar risk for 
progression/ death than the patients who remained in the study. This assumption has not been justified and 
it is in general not considered plausible. For example, study discontinuation could be related to lack of 
efficacy or tolerability,  and therefore those patients are not similar  to those who continued in the study. 
According to the IRC-assessment for PFS, 61 patients were censored in the overall population, of those 40 
were censored with no evidence of progression or death and 14 were censored due to switch to new 
treatment.

SAP Amendment history: 
The changes made in the final version of SAP were in line with the changes made in the 4 versions of the 
protocol and were implemented before the data cut-off date. The changes made in the protocol are of 
importance and they are discussed in the section Changes in the protocol and sample size. Minor changes 
regarding descriptive analyses/tables were made. These changes made are not considered to affect the 
interpretation of the results.

Baseline data 
The median age was 65 years (range: 30-90) and the majority of subjects had an ECOG Performance Status 
of 0 (46.5%) or 1 (48.1%) at baseline, so quite fit compared to the general relapsed iNHL population. At 
baseline, the majority of subjects had elevated LDH (66.7%), 40% had bulky disease, and 84.5% had NHL 
stage III or IV,  which are all poor prognostic features as reflected in the prognostic system FLIPI for FL.  
The median number of prior systemic regimens was three with 88% having received at least two prior 
regimens. 94% of FL patients were refractory to their most recent prior  anticancer therapy, and 81% were 
refractory to ≥ 2 prior  therapies.

Source: Updated data from data cut 18 May 2018 
Median duration of response (DOR) in the FL population was 10 months (95% CI: 4.5, 21.9) and 9.9 months 
(95% CI: 4.5, 10.3) for the FAS as assessed by the IRC.  
The applicant has presented the KM for DOR per investigator for both the ITT as well as the subgroup of 
patients with 2 prior lines of treatment. Results are in line with those reported for the IRC-based analysis as 
this was app. 10 months for both the ITT and patients with more than 2 prior  regimens. Results are thus 
largely concordant. 
Ancillary analyses 
Generally, the numbers are too small to conclude anything from the subgroup analyses. Future studies may 
elucidate if there is a difference between efficacy in patients having received prior  therapy with bendamustine 
or not, which is the subgroup with the largest difference between ORRs.

Clinical  studies in special populations 
Table 59 Age Groups for Subjects with FL Treated with Duvelisib 25 mg BID – Study IPI – 145-02, Study IPI-
145-06 
Supportive studies 
Study IPI-145-06 (Study IPI-145-06 CSR) was a global, Phase 2, open-label, single-arm efficacy and safety 
study of duvelisib administered as monotherapy in subjects with iNHL.  A total of 129 subjects were enrolled 
in the study, including 28 with SLL. All subjects received duvelisib 25 mg BID until PD or unacceptable 
toxicity. ORR was the primary  endpoint and DOR and PFS among the secondary endpoints.  
Study IPI-145-12 CSR is a Phase 3, 2-arm, open-label, optional crossover extension study conducted in 
subjects with CLL/SLL who experienced radiologically-confirmed PD while receiving either duvelisib or 
ofatumumab monotherapy in Study IPI-145-07. Data presented include efficacy results from 89 subjects who 
received duvelisib monotherapy after experiencing PD while on ofatumumab monotherapy in Study IPI-145-
07. The final CSR was based on a clinical data cut-off date of 19 July 2017, at which time 29 subjects 
remained on duvelisib. ORR was the primary  endpoint and DOR and PFS secondary.  
Study IPI-145-02 was a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study to determine the safety and maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) of duvelisib monotherapy. The study was conducted in 2 parts: (1) a dose-escalation 
(DE) phase, utilising a 3+3 design, that enrolled subjects with any advanced haematologic malignancy and 
examined duvelisib doses from 8 mg BID to 100 mg BID, and (2) several expansion cohorts (ECs) that 
enrolled subjects with specific diseases, including iNHL,  CLL/SLL, and T-cell lymphoma, and examined 2 
doses of duvelisib (25 mg and 75 mg BID). In both parts of the study, duvelisib was administered until PD or 
unacceptable toxicity. A total of 210 subjects with advanced haematologic malignancies were enrolled, 
including 55 subjects with R/R CLL/SLL,  28 of whom received duvelisib monotherapy at a dose of 25 mg BID. 
Data from these 28 subjects were included in the SCE. Efficacy analyses were descriptive, with all 
response/progression endpoints based on Investigator assessments.  
The median number of prior treatments was 3 in all three supportive studies as opposed to 2 in the pivotal 
phase 3 trial.  
Median PFS was higher in the extension study (IPI-145-12) compared to the pivotal study (15.0 vs 13.3 
months) where all patients had previously been treated with ofatumumab and thus gained an additional 
treatment thus supporting the larger efficacy in patients with a higher number of previous treatments. This 
was not the case for study 06 were all patients had SLL (N=28) and the median PFS was 11.7 months. Only 
the pivotal study had PFS as the primary  endpoint.  
assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236249/2021 
Page 138/206 
 
  
  
 
No clear difference based on the number of prior  therapies, as seen in study 07, is seen in study 012, which 
may in part be due to the low number of patients.   
In study IPI-145-12 the ORR in patients with 17p- was 16/20 (80%) confirming the efficacy of duvelisib in 
this poor-prognosis population.  
Table 60 ORR in the pivotal and supportive studies 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The pivotal study to support the CLL indication is IPI-145-07; pivotal data for the FL indication is collected 
from IPI-145-06 with supportive data from IPI-145-02.   
The selection of the dose and regimen of duvelisib monotherapy for Phase 2 and 3 studies was based on 
available preclinical data and data obtained from two clinical studies, Study IPI-145-01 (a Phase 1 single and 
multiple ascending dose study in healthy subjects) and Study IPI-145-02 (a Phase 1 dose escalation and 
expansion study in subjects with advanced hematologic malignancies). The selection of duvelisib 25 mg BID 
in CLL/SLL was based on the pharmacodynamic, efficacy, and safety data obtained from Study IPI-145-02 (n 
= 210). No demonstrable additional efficacy in terms of ORR was observed with higher doses, but a higher 
assessment report

number of deaths was observed in the 75 mg BID cohort. The dose finding studies did not include lower dose 
levels in the expansion cohorts (<25 mg BID). 
CLL 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study IPI-145-07 (DUO trial) is an open-label, multicentre, randomised (1:1) phase 3 study comparing the 
efficacy of duvelisib to ofatumumab in relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL patients who had previously received ≥ 
1 therapy. The open-label design is endorsed given the different administration routes (IV and orally) of the 
treatments. To reduce bias, a blinded independent central review of disease status was conducted for the 
primary  endpoint. Cross-over was allowed: Subjects who experienced radiographically confirmed disease 
progression on Study IPI-145-07 had the option to enrol in Study IPI-145-12.  
The comparator  ofatumumab is now obsolete as it has been deregistered in Europe for the treatment of CLL 
(although still available on a compassionate-use basis). At the time of the design of the study (21 Aug 2013) 
ofatumumab was approved by the EMA as monotherapy for CLL refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab. 
CHMP and COMP accepted this comparator.   
Both 17p deletion and purine-analogue refractoriness are important adverse prognostic factors, and 
stratification according to these factors in phase 3 trials is in line with the updated IwCLL guideline (Hallek et 
al., 2018). This guideline also recommends stratification according to stage and IGHV mutational status, 
which has not been performed in this study.  
Duvelisib was administered orally (as capsules) twice daily in 28-day cycles until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. Subjects randomised to ofatumumab received 8 weekly IV infusions, starting with an 
initial dose of ofatumumab of 300 mg followed by 7 weekly doses of 2000 mg. Thereafter, subjects received 
2000 mg ofatumumab once every cycle for 4 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, 
whichever came first. Administration of ofatumumab was not to exceed the 12 doses (within 7 cycles) as 
described in the prescribing information. 
The selection of the 25 mg BID dose was further supported by pharmacodynamic analyses performed in 
Study IPI-145-02. As the serine/threonine kinase AKT is directly phosphorylated by PI3Ks, the reduction in 
phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) was used as a pharmacodynamic marker  for tumour cell PI3K inhibition in 
subjects with CLL. PK/pharmacodynamic analyses revealed a correlation between duvelisib plasma 
concentrations and percent p-AKT inhibition. Maximal p-AKT reductions were observed at plasma 
concentrations achieved at both the 25 mg BID and the 75 mg BID doses. In addition, the percentage of 
Ki67-positive CLL cells, an indicator of tumour cell proliferation, was measured in whole blood by flow 
cytometry predose on Cycle 1 Day 1 and following duvelisib dosing on Day 1 of Cycle 2, Cycle 3, and Cycle 4. 
The level of inhibition of Ki67 measured at Cycle 2 Day 1 was similar between the 25 mg BID and 75 mg BID 
doses. 
Eligible patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either ofatumumab or duvelisib. The randomisation was 
stratified by the presence of 17p deletion, prior  progression within 12 months after previous purine analog-
based therapy, and the presence of Grade 4 cytopenia at Baseline.

Blinding is not applicable since this study is designed as open-label which is endorsed given the different 
administration routes (IV and orally) of the treatments.  
Study IPI-145-07 did not allow for the collection of disease assessments after initiation of subsequent 
anticancer therapy, due to the difficulty of obtaining consistent data on disease progression after a subject 
has withdrawn from study therapy. Due to this protocol design element as well as the proportion  of subjects 
who withdrew from treatment and no longer remain in disease follow up, sensitivity analyses were performed 
to assess the impact of censoring on the results of the PFS analysis.  
Blinding is not applicable since this study is designed as open-label. To reduce bias, a blinded independent 
central review of disease status was conducted for the primary  endpoint. 
Both 17p deletion and purine-analogue refractoriness are important adverse prognostic factors, and 
stratification according to these factors in phase 3 trials is in line with the updated IwCLL guideline (Hallek et 
al., 2018). This guideline also recommends stratification according to stage and IGHV mutational status, 
which has not been performed in this study.   
Recognising that the different treatment schedules for duvelisib (treatment until progression or unacceptable 
toxicity for up to 18 cycles, with the potential to continue receive further cycles) and ofatumumab (fixed 
dosing for a total of 7 cycles) could impact the interpretation of sensitivity analysis 1, a subsequent 
sensitivity analysis was conducted. In this second sensitivity analysis of PFS, subjects alive without 
documented progression who were missing at least one disease assessment right before data cut-off were 
treated as having PFS event at the time of the next scheduled assessment following the last adequate 
disease assessment.   
The sample size determination seems adequate. The primary  and secondary endpoints are considered 
relevant and clinically meaningful in the proposed patient population.   
As noted by the CHMP in their scientific advice the inclusion criterium of ≥ 1 prior therapy allows for a rather 
large/imprecise population. Furthermore, the CHMP advised: “In line with the exclusion of prior use of PI3K 
inhibitors, prior ofatumumab therapy should also be excluded or at least proposed as stratification factor.” 
However,  there were 4/159 patients in the ofatumumab arm having received prior  ofatumumab treatment.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The selection of duvelisib 25 mg BID in CLL/SLL was based on the pharmacodynamic, efficacy, and safety 
data obtained from Study IPI-145-02 (n = 210). In the event of toxicity the recommendation was to modify 
the duvelisib dose to 15 mg BID. The applicant has presented efficacy data from 43 patients (27%) in study 
07 having received 15 mg duvelisib BID showing that the efficacy was not lower  in these patients. This also 
seem to be the case in study 06 but here the number of patients in this category is even lower 
(13/83=16%), and no comparison to the population receiving 25 mg BID was made. Additionally, a PopPK 
analysis showed that at both 15 and 25 mg BID, the IC50s of both p-AKT and PI3K-d are exceeded at all 
times. Thus, dose-reduction to 15 mg BID duvelisib dose in the event of AEs is considered justified (see also 
discussion on Clinical Pharmacology). 
The median PFS (ITT population) for duvelisib was 13.3 months (95% CI: 12.1, 16.8) and for ofatumumab 
9.9 months (95% CI: 9.2, 11.3) with a hazard ratio of 0.52 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.70; p < 0.0001) and thus the 
study met its primary  endpoint demonstrating statistically significant superiority of duvelisib over 
ofatumumab for PFS per IRC.

The PFS analysis relies on the assumption that patients who switched to another anticancer therapy before 
PD/death or who discontinued the study without a PFS event are comparable  to those remaining in the study. 
This is not agreed since those patients could have discontinued treatment due to lack of efficacy or 
tolerability.   
Moreover, the most common reason for censoring in the ofatumumab arm was reported as ‘new anticancer 
treatment or procedure started prior to documented progression’ in 27 (17.0%) subjects. Times for patients 
in this category were censored at the date of the last adequate disease status assessment, which means the 
progression-free survival times for these patients when receiving ofatumumab are unknown.  The applicant 
has restricted the CLL indication to the post hoc-defined subgroup of patients who have received at least 2 
lines of treatment.  
The applicant presented the requested sensitivity analyses using the population corresponding to the new 
pursued indication: patients with at least 2 prior therapies. Patients who discontinued treatment before a PFS 
were considered in different ways: censored, imputed using the information from the patients observed in the 
same arm, followed up despite switching to a new anti-cancer therapy, and finally PFS events.   
The results of the sensitivity analyses are concordant with those reported in the primary  analysis. The median 
PFS per IRC vs Investigator assessment for duvelisib for the ITT  population was 13.3 vs 17.6 months and for 
ofatumumab 9.9 vs 9.7 months. The difference between the IRC’s and investigator’s assessment of PFS was 
quite marked in the duvelisib arm  demonstrating the need for IRCs to ensure consistent evaluation of study 
results. The concordance between Investigator and blinded IRC assessment of PFS events (progression, 
death, and censored) was 83.1% for the duvelisib arm  and 79.9% for the ofatumumab arm. 
Key secondary endpoint of ORR per modified IWCLL/IWG criteria for duvelisib vs ofatumumab was 73.8% for 
duvelisib vs 45.3% for ofatumumab (p < 0.0001). Lymph node response (LNR) rate was higher in duvelisib 
(85%) vs ofatumumab (16%). In subjects with a response, the median DOR was longer with duvelisib 
compared to ofatumumab (median DOR = 11.1 months duvelisib vs 9.3 months ofatumumab). The median 
OS of IPI-145-07 was not estimable in either treatment arm and results are difficult to assess due to use of 
further anticancer therapy in both arms. OS was similar between the two treatment arms at both the primary 
endpoint analysis and the additional 22 months follow up with no difference between the treatment arms. 
Updated OS is needed for evaluation as well as information on time to new anti-cancer therapy. The applicant 
has accepted a CHMP recommendation to provide the final OS results for both the ITT and finally approved 
subgroup at post-approval. 
Although the subgroup analyses generally are consistent with the overall outcome, some analyses are of 
special interest, particularly regarding del 17p/TP53 mutation, as they represent a high-risk group of CLL. At 
the time of study initiation, the ESMO guideline listed no standard treatment for these patients. In study IPI-
145-07, the applicant has stratified and performed a prespecified subgroup analysis on patients with the 17p 
deletion or TP53 mutation at baseline (48 randomised to duvelisib, 52 randomised to ofatumumab). In the 
subjects with 17p deletion or TP53 mutation duvelisib demonstrated statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful improvement  over ofatumumab for PFS (HR=0.4, p=0.0002). Even though subjects with 17p 
del/TP53 mutation represent a high-risk group of CLL, the median PFS for duvelisib was only slightly lower 
(12.7 months subjects with mutation versus 14.7 months for subjects without mutation), also reflected in the 
ORR. 
Approximately  60% of subjects received at least two prior  therapies. The applicant provided a subgroup 
analysis (not planned in the study protocol) on the number of prior therapies (≥ 2 prior therapies versus 1 
prior  therapy).  Median PFS was 16.4 months (95% CI: 12.0, 20.5) for duvelisib versus 9.1 months for 
assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236249/2021 
Page 142/206 
 
  
  
ofatumumab (95% CI: 7.9, 10.7), with a hazard ratio of 0.4 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.59) for patients with ≥ 2 prior 
therapies. For patients with only 1 prior therapy the median PFS was 12.7 months (95% CI: 9.1, 17.8) for 
duvelisib versus 12.0 months for ofatumumab (95% CI: 9.6, 12.8) with a hazard ratio of 0.8 (95% CI: 0.5, 
1.28). Thus, the overall efficacy seems to be driven by the 60% of patients having received ≥ 2 prior 
therapies. Thus, duvelisib seems to work better in heavily pre-treated CLL patients contrary to what is 
generally seen with regards to efficacy, and thus fulfils an unmet need in this population. The applicant has 
amended the indication to include patients after two or more prior  therapies. The inclusion and exclusion 
criteria of the pivotal trial (IPI-145-07) were extensive with respect to prior  treatments, e.g. refractory to 
rituximab and chemotherapy and not eligible for SCT. Further, patients previously treated with a PI3 kinase 
inhibitors or BTK inhibitors were excluded from the CLL study and patients previously treated with a BCL-2 
inhibitor were not enrolled. While treatment with duvelisib after progression on idelalisib treatment would be 
considered irrational, it is unknown whether prior exposure to BTK inhibitors or BCL-2 inhibitors might impact 
response to duvelisib. A reference from the indication towards section 5.1. has been added to guide the 
prescriber  towards the lack of data in patients previously treated with BCL-2 or BTK inhibitors as these have 
a different MoA and thus efficacy could be expected. However,  the efficacy of duvelisib after idelalisib has not 
been addressed and because of the similar  MoA for idelalisib and duvelisib, efficacy of duvelisib after idelalisib 
treatment is questionable and since treatment with duvelisib comes with a severe toxicity, the applicant has 
added previous use of idelalisib as a warning in 4.4. with a cross reference from the indication towards 4.4 
and 5.1.  
Based on the results from the performed sensitivity analyses it seems that the censoring due to new 
anticancer medication in the ofatumumab arm  did not substantially affect the results for the subgroup of 
patients who received 2 or more prior  therapies.   
The results of the adjusted PFS analysis were consistent with the primary  analysis for the 2+ prior  therapy 
subgroup. This suggests that the imbalance in prognostic factors (in particular,  months since most recent 
therapy) did not have an overt influence on the results. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that there is a 
true subgroup effect, given that there is an overall positive ITT effect. 
The applicant accepted a recommendation from the CHMP to provide the final OS results for Study IPI-145-
07 for both the ITT and finally approved subgroup as soon as available. 
FL - Design and conduct of clinical studies  
The primary  data for the FL indication is collected from a single arm Phase 2 Study IPI-145-06, with 
supportive data from a single arm Phase I study IPI-145-02. A single arm  trial (SAT) carries important 
intrinsic limitations, which may be overcome in specific circumstances only. These include a predictable 
course of the disease, a well-described patient population, and compelling results indicative of clinical benefit, 
for which a well understood MoA is deemed helpful. A randomised controlled trial,  RCT, would have been the 
preferred approach, although it is acknowledged that at study initiation a suitable effective comparator  was 
not readily available.  
Study IPI-145-06 is a Phase 2, open-label, single arm efficacy and safety study of duvelisib monotherapy 
administered orally to subjects with relapsed/refractory iNHL,  including the subtypes of FL (n = 83), small 
lymphocytic lymphoma  (SLL) (n = 28), and MZL (n = 18) for a total of 129 subjects. This study was designed 
to evaluate the effect of duvelisib 25 mg BID monotherapy in subjects with iNHL refractory to rituximab and 
assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236249/2021 
Page 143/206 
 
  
  
 
to either chemotherapy or radioimmunotherapy (RIT). FL patients refractory to rituximab + chemotherapy or 
RIT have a dismal prognosis.  
The median age was 65 years (range: 30-90) and the majority of subjects had an ECOG Performance Status 
(PS) of 0 (46.5%) or 1 (48.1%) at baseline, so quite fit compared to the general relapsed iNHL population. At 
baseline, the majority of subjects had elevated LDH (66.7%), 40% had bulky disease, and 84.5% had NHL 
stage III or IV,  thus a poor prognosis population.  
The applicant has defined refractory FL as lack of a CR or PR while receiving chemotherapy regimen or RIT 
(radioimmunotherapy) and/or rituximab or PD within 6 months of the last dose. Thus, early relapse and 
refractory are not identical with the latter population expected to have the poorest prognosis.  
The median number of prior systemic regimens was three with 88% having received at least two prior 
regimens. 94% of FL patients were refractory to their most recent prior  anticancer therapy, and 81% were 
refractory to ≥ 2 prior  therapies. At time of study initiation idelalisib and obinutuzumab were not yet 
approved in the EU. The efficacy of duvelisib in patients previously treated with idelalisib or obinutuzumab is 
unknown. Specific prior anticancer therapies were: (1) 100% received prior anti-CD20 rituximab; 95% in 
combination; (2) 69% received prior doxorubicin; (3) 65% received prior  bendamustine, with 52% in 
combination with rituximab.  The sought indication is for patients with previously treated FL who have 
received at least one prior therapy, the majority of the FL subjects had more than 2 prior  anticancer 
regimens, only 10 (12%) of the included subjects had 1 prior  treatment. The sample size is thus small to 
reliably conclude on efficacy between one prior or more than 2 prior  treatments. The applicant has amended 
the indication to include FL patients after at least two prior systemic therapies. 
The final efficacy analysis is based on a data cut-off of 18 May 2018. At that time, 5 subjects (3 with FL, 1 
with SLL,  and 1 with MZL) remained on treatment. The median duration of exposure was 4.9 months.   
Patients with prior treatment with any PI3K inhibitor or Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor were 
excluded.  
The primary  objective of study IPI-145-06 was to evaluate the antitumour activity of duvelisib monotherapy 
administered to subjects diagnosed with iNHL (FL, SLL, and MZL) whose disease was refractory to rituximab 
and to either chemotherapy or RIT,  whereas the indication is in the subgroup of refractory FL patients only.  
The primary  endpoint IRC-ORR was defined as best response of CR or PR according to the revised IWG 
Criteria (Cheson et al., 2007). The applicant formulated several key secondary endpoints: DOR, PFS, OS, TTR 
as well as several exploratory  endpoints. The choice of ORR as primary  endpoint is considered appropriate  for 
a phase 2 study, and the secondary endpoints are meaningful although difficult to interpret given the single-
arm design.  
One interim futility analysis was planned for ORR.  The IA was scheduled around 4 months after at least 30 
subjects had received duvelisib. The interim analysis was conducted based on the Investigator’s assessment 
and a recommendation on futility of the study was provided by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee. 
Since no strategy was planned to control for multiplicity across several secondary endpoints, those are 
considered exploratory. 
The applicant defined as the null hypothesis an ORR equal or below 30 % responders. In the first version of 
the protocol, the ORR was expected to be ≥ 55% for the overall iNHL population but was revised so that the 
alternative hypothesis is ORR equal or larger than 45 %. The applicant clarified that there were no 
assumptions specified regarding the ORR for the FL population. In the protocol v3 the number of FL patients 
to be included changed from 100 to 80 due to recruitment problems.  It could be understood that the 
assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236249/2021 
Page 144/206 
 
  
  
applicant would aim to ORR around 45 % but any response rate larger than 30 % would be considered 
successful. Furthermore, the applicant did not specify whether the 30 % limit should be crossed by the 
estimate or the lower bound of the confidence interval; the study was to be considered successful if the p-
value for a 1-sided exact binomial test was significant at the 0.025 level, which would be generally consistent 
with a lower bound of a two-sided 95% CI that exceeds 30%.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Initially the ORR for the entire iNHL population of at least 120 patients was expected to be ≥ 55% but was 
later amended in the protocol to ≥ 45% and turned out to be 45.7% (59/129; 95% CI: 36.9, 54.7) per IRC 
assessment. Two responses were CRs and 59 were PRs. The subgroup analysis in the FL population did not 
meet the expected ORR for the FAS as this was 42.2% ((35/83; 95% CI: 31.4, 53.5) with 1 CR and 34 PRs. 
The median DOR for the responders was 10.0 months. Due to heavy censoring (54.3%), the estimated 
median DOR was not reliable.   Moreover, 28.6% was censored due to new anticancer treatment before 
documented progression in the FL population. The applicant has presented the KM for DOR per investigator 
for both the ITT as well as the subgroup of patients with 2 prior  lines of treatment. Results are in line with 
those reported for the IRC-based analysis as this was approximately  10 months for both the ITT and patients 
with more than 2 prior  regimens. Results are thus largely concordant.   
The median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI: 4.2, 10.0) for FL subjects and 8.4 months (95% CI: 5.8, 11.3) for 
the FAS. Ten patients experienced Death without Progression. However, due to the single-arm study design, 
the clinical significance of PFS, OS, TTR cannot be adequately interpreted. 
Given the censoring for new anticancer therapy, it is considered that the combination of investigator and IRC 
progression events for FL in the single-arm study produces a more  conservative estimate than that based on 
IRC alone. For the 2+ prior  therapy subgroup, the median PFS was estimated to be 8.3 months. This is 
slightly lower than for the IRC results alone, and still considered to be clinically meaningful. In a comparable 
study (101-09; IRC assessed) of the PI3K inhibitor idelalisib the ORR was 57.6% in the iNHL  cohort and 
55.6% (40/72) in the FL subset with 16.7% (12/72) obtaining a CR (see Zydelig SmPC). Idelalisib received 
the indication as monotherapy for FL refractory (but not relapsed) to two prior  therapies. Only refractory FL 
patients defined as in the IPI-145-06 study were included.   
The ORR for the subgroup of ≥ 2 prior  therapies was 29/73 (39.7%; 95% CI: 29,52). The applicant has 
revised the requested indication from the second line treatment of FL towards the third line (e.g. Relapsed or 
refractory follicular lymphoma  (FL) after at least two prior  systemic therapies with a reference to 5.1.). The 
newly proposed indication better reflects the studied population with 88% having received at least two prior 
regimens and 94% of FL patients were refractory to their most recent prior  anticancer therapy, and 81% 
were refractory to ≥ 2 prior therapies. The addition of relapsed FL in the indication is not agreed as only 
refractory FL patients were included in study IPI-145-06 and the B/R in relapsed FL patients is not considered 
justified given the potentially long remission in these patients and the severe safety concerns of duvelisib. 
The applicant has further amended the indication to only include patients with refractory FL after at least two 
prior  systemic therapies.   
Thus, in principle this single pivotal study would not be considered comprehensive and the ORR for duvelisib 
in this single-arm trial is not outstanding; the indication in “Relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma  (FL) 
after at least one prior systemic therapy” is not considered justified. At the request of the CHMP the 
indication was amended to specify “refractory” FL patients, “after at least two prior systemic therapies”.

Historically, in a comparable study (101-09; IRC assessed) of the PI3K inhibitor idelalisib the ORR was 57.6% 
in the iNHL  cohort and 55.6% (40/72) in the FL subset with 16.7% (12/72) obtaining a CR (Zydelig SmPC) 
and received the indication as monotherapy for FL refractory to two prior  therapies. The median number of 
prior  therapies in the study was four (Gopal et al.,  2014).  
In a phase 3 study (GADOLIN) the combination Gazyvaro + bendamustine followed by Gazyvaro 
maintenance, which is indicated for refractory FL, the median PFS by IRC is not reached (22.5 – NR months) 
and the PFS in the bendamustine comparator  arm was 13.8 months (see Gazyvaro SmPC). The median age 
was 63 years and the median number of prior therapies two.  
The treatment landscape of R/R FL has changed since start of the pivotal trial (24 June 2013) with the PI3K 
inhibitor idelalisib as treatment option for double-refractory FL (ESMO guideline 2016). The currently 
proposed indication is partially overlapping with idelalisib (Zydelig is indicated as monotherapy for the 
treatment of adult patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) that is refractory to two prior  lines of treatment). 
The studied population consisted mostly of FL patients refractory to rituximab and chemotherapy (e.g. double 
refractory) and no previous PI3 kinase treatment with 2 prior  treatments. This patient population has become 
very rare due to changes in the treatment landscape. With the proposed indication (after at least 2 lines), the 
question with respect to the expected efficacy of duvelisib in patients previously treated with idelalisib 
remains unaddressed and the efficacy of duvelisib after idelalisib is questioned. In light of the severe toxicity 
of duvelisib and the unlikely efficacy of duvelisib after idelalisib treatment, a warning has been added to 
SmPC section 4.4. regarding previous use of idelalisib. The indication was amended to only include refractory 
FL, as the B/R in relapsed FL patients was not considered justified given the potentially long remission in 
these patients, the severe safety concerns of duvelisib and other efficacious options.   
All in all, there are several limitations with respect to the presented data for FL in a single arm study with 
ORR as primary  endpoint. Although an RCT would have been preferred it is acknowledged that at study 
initiation a suitable effective comparator  was not readily available.  In a similar development programme  for 
Zydelig (idelalisib) a full approval was given for both CLL and FL in 2014. During that procedure the CHMP 
has accepted the single-arm data for the FL population with ORR as primary  endpoint.  
The applicant will request advice from the CHMP SAWP on the design of a randomised trial VS-0145-327 
which will report  post-authorisation.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions  on the clinical efficacy 
The presented results are supportive of the restricted indication in CLL in patients having received ≥ 2 prior 
lines of therapy whereas stating the fact that patients having received prior  PI3 kinase, bcl-2, or BTK inhibitor 
treatment were not part of the study population.  
The applicant accepted a recommendation from the CHMP to provide the final OS results for Study IPI-145-
07 for both the ITT and finally approved subgroup as soon as available (estimated July 2021). 
The revised indication in FL referring to treatment after at least two prior  systemic therapies and the 
limitation to refractory FL patients is agreed.  
The applicant has agreed to the recommendation of the CHMP to provide results from a phase 3 randomised 
trial in FL (Study VS-0145-327). As the design of study VS-0145-327 is not yet clarified, the applicant has 
also agreed to seek scientific advice, an outline of further steps has been proposed.

2.6.  Clinical  safety 
Patient  exposure 
The Summary of Clinical Safety (SCS) provided an Integrated Summary  of Safety (ISS) from 4 studies 
(Studies IPI-145-02, IPI-145-06, IPI-145-07 and IPI-145-12) of duvelisib monotherapy in subjects with 
haematologic malignancies. Specifically, the data presented include the clinical studies mainly conducted in 
subjects with CLL/SLL and FL at the recommended 25 mg twice daily (BID) dose in total 442 patients of 
which 303 had CLL/SLL  and 96 had FL. The cut-off for the integrated summary of safety, also named Study 
VS-0145-328, was 19 July 2017. With the 3-year updated ISS data (Study VS-0145-328) the All Heme 25 
mg BID Group (N = 443), had a median duration of exposure of 40.00 weeks (range: 0.3 to 311.0 weeks) as 
opposed to 39 weeks at the time of the application. A total of 277 patients (62.5%) were treated for ≥ 6 
months, 170 (38.4%) were treated for ≥ 1 year, 109 (24.6%) were treated for ≥ 1.5 years, and importantly 
for the evaluation of long-term safety 72 patients (16.3%) were treated for ≥ 2 years, of which 54 were CLL 
patients and 7 were FL patients.

The results in the pooled CLL/SLL  25 mg BID (n=303) were comparable to the phase 3 study in CLL (n=158; 
these are included in the 303 patients).  
Generally, the AEs in the pooled FL population, the pooled CLL/SLL,  and the All Heme 25 mg BID population 
are of the same order as in the RCT (IPI-145-07). 
The incidence and prevalence of TEAE and serious TEAE over time of the 25 mg BID duvelisib all Heme 
population is shown in Table 35.

Treatment-related Adverse Events (TRAEs) 
No table of treatment-related adverse events is presented in the SCS. From the two pivotal studies (07 for 
CLL and 06 for FL) generally the events correspond to the adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and are 
similar between the two trials especially when considering that the FL study is a single-arm trial.

≥ Grade 3 AEs 
Clearly ≥ grade 3 TEAE occurred more frequently in the duvelisib arm  compared to the ofatumumab arm  in 
the RCT: This was apparent for PTs in the SOC Blood and lymphatic system disorders, infections (in particular 
pneumonia), colitis/diarrhoea, increased transaminases, and pneumonitis (Table 31/CSR-07). The 
frequencies were similar in the pooled studies for both CLL/SLL (Table 17/SCS) and FL (Table 21/SCS).

Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) 
In the SCS the AESIs are presented but without the separate results from the only randomised study for 
comparison. It is apparent that safety is going to be a major  issue for the potential approval  of duvelisib in 
CLL/SLL and/or FL and safety therefore has to be comprehensively presented. As the PTs for the AESIs in the 
SCS are pooled presenting the PTs from the various tables from the CSR (IPI-145-07) may not reflect the 
entire picture, and the applicant is requested to present the data for all AESIs in study IPI-145-07 using 
pooled PTs for both arms (duvelisib and ofatumumab) and include them in the tables for AESIs in the SCS 
(25 mg BID) preferably in the order All Heme (N=442), All FL (N=96), All CLL/SLL (N=303), CLL study 145-
07 duvelisib arm (N=158) and the comparator  ofatumumab (N=155) for ease of comparison.  The applicant 
has presented the information as requested – see tables below.

Table 75 Adverse Events of Special Interest - regarding  frequency-adjusted AESIs for study 07  
Diarrhoea-Colitis 
A customised PT grouping was used to identify the selected adverse events of AESI Diarrhoea-Colitis for each 
population (All Heme, CLL/SLL,  and FL [each 25 mg BID]): Colitis, Colitis erosive, Colitis microscopic, Colitis 
ulcerative, Enterocolitis, Enterocolitis haemorrhagic, Necrotising colitis, Diarrhoea, and Diarrhoea 
haemorrhagic. The incidence of the AESI diarrhoea-colitis reported with duvelisib was 50.2% in the All Heme 
group, 49.0% in the 96 subjects with FL, 49.8% in the 303 subjects with CLL, and 57.0% in Study IPI-145-
07 compared to 13.5% in the ofatumumab arm.    
In the duvelisib treatment arm  with colitis 21/23 patients had Grade 3 or 4 colitis: Of the 23 patients, 10 
(43%) had an onset within 6 months of initiating treatment; 10 (43%) subjects had an onset between 6 and 
12 months of starting treatment; and 3 (13%) subjects had an onset after 1 year on treatment 
demonstrating that colitis may occur at any time during treatment, and is not limited to the initial treatment 
period.  This is also confirmed by the integrated analysis were the median time to onset for ≥ Grade 3 was 
227 days.  
In the Integrated summary population 20% (89/442) patients had an SAE with 1 death and 79/442 events 
being Grade 3 or 4. No Grade 5 colitis occurred in the RCT. None of the colitis TEAEs resulted in death.

Analysis Set, All Subgroups (25 mg BID) 
All Heme 25 mg BID-population: For Grade 3 or higher events, the majority  were recovered/resolved or 
recovered/resolved with sequelae (137 events, 93%). Five events (3%) were not recovered/not resolved, 4 
(3%) had a change in grade, and 1 outcome was fatal. 
Infection (Including Pneumonia) 
For the AESI Infections PTs of the entire SOC are included. There were more infectious adverse events in the 
duvelisib arm  of the pivotal randomised study (145-07) compared to the ofatumumab arm; 69.0% vs 43.2% 
and for SAEs 38.0% vs 12.9%. For Pneumonia the corresponding percentages were 18.4% vs 5.8% and for 
SAEs 14.6% vs 3.2%. The difference between the two arms were also higher for ≥ Grade 3 infections with 
the incidence of SOC Infections being 33.5% vs 11.0% (duvelisib vs ofatumumab) and the corresponding

results for Pneumonia 13.9% (N=22) vs 1.3% (N=2). All subjects (N=10) with Infectious TEAEs leading to 
death were duvelisib treated, no patients in the ofatumumab arm  died due to an infection.

Deaths 
In the randomised study fatal TEAEs (between first dose and 30 days after last dose) were reported for 19 in 
the duvelisib arm (12.0%) and 7 (4.5%) in the ofatumumab arm.  Two patients in the ofatumumab arm had 
progressive disease counted as an TEAE. Two patients died after the cut-off date of 19 July 2017.

Serious Adverse Events: 
In the randomised study (IPI-145-07) SAEs (PT) were reported in 115 (72.8%) subjects treated with 
duvelisib and 50 (32.3%) subjects treated with ofatumumab. The previously described AESIs are the most 
prevalent SAEs in the duvelisib arm: SOC Infections (38.0%), pneumonia (14.6%), colitis (12.0%), diarrhoea 
(10.1%), and febrile neutropenia (6.3%). In the ofatumumab arm the SOC Infections occurred in 12.9%, and 
no SAEs (PT) occurred in > 5% of subjects.  
There were twice as many SAEs in the duvelisib arm, and this includes the previously described, and from 
other PI3K inhibitors well-known, AESIs of pneumonia, colitis, diarrhoea, and febrile neutropenia.  
In the ISS population for CLL/SLL the frequencies for the SAEs were comparable,  and for the FL population 
Infections were clearly lower than in the CLL/SLL population (20.8% vs 38.0%), which is not unexpected, as 
CLL patients are considered more  immune-incompetent (Riches et al.,  2012).

Clinical Chemistry 
In the integrated summary in subjects receiving duvelisib 25 mg BID, lipase increased was the most 
frequently reported shift from Baseline to a post-Baseline ≥ Grade 3 (All Heme 16.0%; CLL/SLL 13.3%; FL 
23.6%). Among subjects in the All Heme group with new ≥ Grade 3 lipase increased (n=55), only 2 subjects 
experienced a TEAE of pancreatitis (1 Grade 2, non-serious, and 1 Grade 3, SAE). In the randomised study 
lipase increased was not listed in the corresponding “shift” table. Increased lipase was seen more frequently 
in the duvelisib compared to the ofatumumab arm: 5.1% vs 1.9% (All causes), 2.5% vs 0.6% (≥ Grade 3), 
respectively, and 1 SAE of lipase increased, and 1 SAE of pancreatitis, Grade 3, in the duvelisib arm.    
In the integrated summary in the All Heme 25 mg BID Group, new maximum  shifts to post-Baseline Grade ≥ 
3 values in 5% of subjects included ALT increased (7.7%) (7.0% in the duvelisib arm in study 145-07 and 0 
in the ofatumumab arm), hyponatraemia (6.7%) (7.1% in the duvelisib arm in study 145-07 and 3.3% in the 
ofatumumab arm),  hypokalaemia (6.9%) (8.3% in the duvelisib arm  in study 145-07 and 0 in the 
ofatumumab arm),  AST increased (5.5%) (3.2% in the duvelisib arm in study 145-07 and 1.3% in the 
ofatumumab arm),  and hypophosphataemia (5.4%) (3.2% in the duvelisib arm in study 145-07 and 3.4% in 
the ofatumumab arm): New maximum  shifts in clinical chemistry values to post-Baseline Grade ≥ 3 values

were similar across All Heme,  CLL/SLL, and FL groups and the duvelisib arm  in study 145-07 and clearly 
larger than in the ofatumumab for all but hypophosphatemia.

Safety in special populations 
Age 
No clinically meaningful differences in the incidence of TEAEs or TESAEs by age and age group in the All 
Heme, CLL/SLL,  and FL groups can be seen. 
Gender 
In general, TEAEs appeared to be well balanced between gender on both treatment arms.  There were gender 
differences but as numbers are small and the ISS by gender identified no clinically meaningful differences in 
the incidence of TEAEs or TESAEs in the All Heme, CLL/SLL,  and FL groups, no meaningful conclusions can be 
drawn. 
Immunological  events 
Not Applicable 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions  and other interactions 
The drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of duvelisib was evaluated in vitro in liver fractions and in 3 clinical 
studies in healthy subjects (IPI-145-01, IPI-145-10, and IPI-145-11). In these studies, duvelisib exposures 
were significantly affected by a strong inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A. An additional DDI study of Repeated 
Dosing of Etravirine on the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability  of a Single-dose of Duvelisib in Healthy 
Subjects (VS-0145-131) was conducted in 2019 (see the pharmacology section for additional details). 
Discontinuation  due to AEs 
In the pivotal phase 3 study in CLL 57 patients (36.1%) in the duvelisib arm and 9 patients (5.8%) in the 
ofatumumab arm discontinued treatment due to an adverse event according to Table 28/CSR-07 (In section 
Adverse events), which is quite a large difference reflecting the toxicity of duvelisib. From a clinical point of 
view, it is highly likely that many of the patients that chose to discontinue [13 (8.2%) in the duvelisib arm 
assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236249/2021 
Page 185/206 
 
  
  
 
and 7 (4.5%) in the ofatumumab arm] may have done so due to intolerable side effects, particularly for the 
duvelisib arm,  since the treatment is administered at home and not at the hospital, as is the case for 
ofatumumab, which for the latter may lead to particularly elderly patients opting out of the treatment due to 
inconvenience rather than adverse events. Death as the reason for discontinuation occurred more frequently 
in the duvelisib arm [12 (8.2%)] compared to the ofatumumab arm  [7 (4.5%)].

Post marketing  experience 
Duvelisib was authorised for the marketing in the USA on 24 September  2018 under the brand name Copiktra 
for the treatment of adult patients with: Relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL after at least 2 prior  therapies, 
and Relapsed or refractory FL after at least 2 prior  systemic therapies. 
Overall, approximately  1254 subjects have been exposed to duvelisib as monotherapy or in combination with 
another agent; the patient exposure to duvelisib during the current reporting interval from 24 Sep 2018 to 23 
March 2019 is estimated at approximately  23.5 patient-years. There were no new risks identified during the 
reporting period.   
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The total safety database of subjects with hematologic malignancies exposed to duvelisib compromised  586 
patients of which 442 received duvelisib 25 mg BID (All Heme).  The cut-off for the integrated summary of 
safety, also named Study VS-0145-328, was 19 July 2017. This study was an obligation to the FDA, who also 
required update of this study after an additional 2 years on treatment with a final report submission date of 
11/2020. The cut-off date was 19 July 2020. The results are discussed below.   
While the pooled safety databases are valuable to obtain a general safety profile of duvelisib, safety data with 
the IPI-145-07 study in CLL is considered most important since the included control arm  allows to put safety 
data in context. Safety comparison in the FL population is hampered by the single arm  trial design.  
A discrepancy in effect between subjects with 1 prior  treatment compared to subjects >2 prior  therapies in 
study IPI-145-07 has been observed. A higher incidence of toxicity is expected after several treatment lines, 
but this could not be confirmed for either CLL or FL although the limited number of FL patients with 1 prior 
therapy hampers thorough assessment.  
The number of patients exposed for a minimum of one-year is considered to be acceptable for the safety 
database. However,  the number of patients treated for 6 months at dose level intended for clinical use, is 
limited to 269 patients of whom 106 patients needed a dose reduction. The relatively limited extent of 
population exposure at the 25 mg BID dose level impairs the detection of uncommon and (very) rare adverse 
events. There was a substantial difference between median exposure among the CLL and FL population (i.e. 
45 weeks vs. 24 weeks). This is explained by the high proportion of PD and shorter time to discontinuation 
due to PD in the FL group. 
The treatment landscape has changed over time as discussed in the efficacy section. The pivotal studies were 
performed in a study population, which does not exist anymore. Patients previously treated with PI3 kinase 
assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236249/2021 
Page 193/206 
 
  
  
inhibitors or BTK inhibitors (e.g. idelalisib and ibrutinib) were excluded from the pivotal studies. The safety of 
duvelisib in the current treatment landscape is therefore unknown, which is reflected in the SmPC (section 
4.4).  
In study IPI-145-07, the incidence of various AEs by SOC and/or PT in the duvelisib arm (N=158) were 
generally higher than in the ofatumumab arm (N=155), which was also the case for SAEs. Overall, the AEs in 
the pooled FL population (N=93), the pooled CLL/SLL (N=303), and the All Heme 25 mg BID population 
(N=442) are of the same order as in the RCT.  
The primary  safety issues identified with duvelisib include serious, including fatal, infections, diarrhoea or 
colitis, cutaneous reactions, and pneumonitis, along with serious hepatotoxicity and neutropenia all of which 
are well-known adverse events of special interest (AESIs) for the PI3K inhibitor idelalisib, which is approved 
for FL and CLL.  
There was a considerably higher incidence of diarrhoea-colitis,  infectious, neutropenia, and rash adverse 
events in the duvelisib arm compared to the ofatumumab arm even after exposure time is taken into 
account. Both Grade 3+ events and SAEs for this AESI were more  frequent with duvelisib than with 
ofatumumab. Diarrhoea-colitis is considered an important identified risk of duvelisib. 
In the duvelisib arm in the RCT Pneumonitis/Interstitial lung disease adverse events were recorded for 
approximately  8-9% (13-14 patients) of which 5% were SAEs and 4.4% led to discontinuation as opposed to 
0% (all AEs) in the ofatumumab arm.   
The incidence of the AESI-Transaminase elevation is clearly higher in the duvelisib arm compared to the 
ofatumumab arm in the RCT: 18 (11.4%) and 6 (3.9%), respectively, and even higher in the All FL 25 mg 
BID group 20/96 (20.8%). In the randomised study fatal TEAEs were reported for 19/158 (12.0%) in the 
duvelisib arm  and 5/155 (3.2%) in the ofatumumab arm.  Given the higher rate of deaths in the duvelisib arm 
compared to the ofatumumab arm and the overall safety profile the indication in CLL and FL has been 
amended to include patients after at least two prior  therapies.  
Inclusion of pancreatitis in the Summary  of safety concerns in the RMP as an ‘Important  identified or 
potential risk’ has been agreed.  
Photosafety measurements have been incorporated based on preclinical findings of duvelisib via several 
amendments across the clinical studies. However,  based on the nonclinical safety margin and clinical 
information, it is agreed that additional risk management activities for photosensitivity are not required and 
inclusion of photosensitivity in the SmPC was not needed.  
In the RCT in CLL 57 patients (36.1%) in the duvelisib arm  and 9 patients (5.8%) in the ofatumumab arm 
discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, which is quite a large difference reflecting the toxicity of 
duvelisib.  
Looking at the AESI transaminase elevation this is clearly more prevalent in the duvelisib arm  compared to 
the ofatumumab arm:18 (11.4%) and 6 (3.9%), respectively. In the duvelisib arm one increased 
transaminase AE was considered an SAE and one led to discontinuation. No subjects on study met the criteria 
for Hy’s Law.  In the CLL/SLL group in the integrated summary the incidence of the AESI-Transaminase 
elevation was comparable  to the CLL arm  in study IPI-145-07 (12.8% vs 11.4%) whereas in the All FL 25 mg 
BID group the incidence was higher; 20.8%. There was one event of Hepatic failure in the All CLL/SLL  25 mg 
BID group.

The data presented from the initial application are as of the cut-off of 19 July 2017. The applicant has 
updated Study VS-0145-328 (consisting of safety from studies IPI-145-02, IPI-145-06, IPI-145-07 and IPI-
145-12 corresponding to the ISS) with a cut-off on July 19, 2020. Since the 19 July 2017 data cut-off, only 1 
additional subject received duvelisib; this is a subject in the CLL/SLL 25 mg BID Group who was randomised 
to ofatumumab in Study IPI-145-07 and subsequently crossed over to Study IPI-145-12 to receive duvelisib. 
A total of 443 subjects included in the integrated safety dataset received at least 1 dose of duvelisib 25 mg 
(of which 304/443 [68.6%] subjects are in the CLL/SLL Group and 96/443 [21.7%] subjects are in the FL 
Group). These 443 subjects had a total of 498.0 patient-years of exposure as opposed to 479 patient-years 
in the ISS  at the time of the application. Data from the final updated ISS (Study VS-0145-328) have been 
evaluated for the various adverse event subtypes.  
With the 3-year updated ISS data (Study VS-0145-328) the All Heme 25 mg BID Group (N = 443), had a 
median duration of exposure of 40.00 weeks (range: 0.3 to 311.0 weeks) as opposed to 39 weeks at the 
time of the application. A total of 277 patients (62.5%) were treated for ≥ 6 months, 170 (38.4%) were 
treated for ≥ 1 year (160 at the time of the application), 109 (24.6%) were treated for ≥ 1.5 years, and 
importantly for the evaluation of long-term safety 72 patients (16.3%) were treated for ≥ 2 years, of which 
54 were CLL patients and 7 were FL patients.  
The updated safety data from Study VS-0145-328 (443 received duvelisib 25 mg BID in the All Heme group) 
did not reveal any meaningful changes or new AEs. A slight increase in all AEs (All, ≥Grade 3, SAEs, Deaths, 
AESIs), as would be expected with time,  was seen. It is agreed that there were no clinically meaningful 
changes between the cumulative 2017 and 2020 data and no new adverse events were found. 
In the post marketing setting following US approval  overall, approximately  1254 subjects have been exposed 
to duvelisib as monotherapy or in combination with another agent; the patient exposure to duvelisib during 
the current reporting interval from 24 Sep 2018 to 23 Mar 2019 is estimated at approximately  23.5 patient-
years. There were no new risks identified during the reporting period. In addition, there was no significant 
change in the frequency or severity of AEs characterised as important identified risks and important potential 
risks. Based on the data obtained through the end of the review period, no new safety relevant information 
was identified regarding the safety concerns and the safety profile of duvelisib. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions  on the clinical safety 
The most frequent clinically important  adverse reactions related to the use of the duvelisib are infections, 
diarrhoea/colitis, neutropenia, rash, transaminase increased, and pneumonitis. 
Duvelisib has a safety profile with a high frequency of adverse events including AESIs, SAEs, deaths, and 
discontinuations in the duvelisib arm  compared to the ofatumumab arm.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.5 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance  system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic  Safety Update Reports submission  requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236249/2021

international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 24.09.2018. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of duvelisib with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer,  mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers duvelisib to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for  human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Copiktra (duvelisib) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic  Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Data in this MAA support the following indications:  
• 
• 
Relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) after at least two prior  therapies.  
Follicular lymphoma  (FL) that is refractory to at least two prior systemic therapies.   
3.1.2.  Available  therapies and unmet medical need 
Therapy for CLL has evolved from monotherapy with alkylating agents (chlorambucil, bendamustine) and 
purine analogues (fludarabine) to immunotherapy (anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab and anti-
CD20 monoclonal antibody ofatumumab) and chemoimmunotherapy combinations (rituximab, ofatumumab 
as well as obinutuzumab in combination with purine and alkylating agents). Since 2014, novel targeted 
agents have been approved initially in the relapsed and some later in the previously untreated setting and 
include ibrutinib, idelalisib, and venetoclax.    
Even with the availability of these novel treatments, most patients will eventually relapse.  Furthermore, not 
all patients tolerate or respond to these treatments, and resistance will emerge over time. In addition, the 
response rate tends to be lower and the duration of response (DOR) becomes progressively shorter with each 
subsequent line of therapy (Fischer et al., 2011; Carton et al.,  2014; Keating et al.,  2002, Wierda et al., 
2010; Catovsky et al, 2007). In conclusion, there remains an unmet medical need for additional novel 
therapies, especially for patients with previously treated CLL.  
Over the past several decades, substantial advances have been made in event-free survival, progression-free 
survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) of patients with FL. These survival improvements are mostly 
attributed to progress in the delivery of effective anti-lymphoma therapies and improvements in supportive 
care (Casulo et al., 2015). The vast majority  of patients treated for FL will have an initial response to therapy 
with 40 to 80 percent demonstrating a complete response, depending on the initial regimen used. However, 
conventional therapy for FL is not curative and most of these patients will ultimately develop progressive 
disease. In addition, less than 10 percent of patients treated with initial chemoimmunotherapy will not 
respond to treatment (ie, refractory disease). Even with the newer available treatments, most patients with 
FL will eventually relapse or become intolerant to therapy. In addition, the rate of response and DOR 
progressively diminish with each subsequent line of therapy. All approved therapies in FL are associated with 
toxicities that may preclude their use in patients with certain comorbidities.  Additional options are needed to 
treat this unmet medical need. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study IPI-145-07 in CLL (DUO trial) is an open-label, multicentre, randomised (1:1) phase 3 
study comparing the efficacy of duvelisib (N=158) (continuous until disease progression or unacceptable 
toxicity, whichever came first) to ofatumumab (N=155) [6-7 months (max 12 infusions) treatment according 
assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/236249/2021 
Page 199/206 
 
  
  
to the previously approved indication] in relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL patients who had previously received 
≥1 therapy. 
The pivotal study IPI-145-06 in FL is a Phase 2, open-label, single arm efficacy and safety study of duvelisib 
monotherapy administered orally to subjects with relapsed/refractory iNHL, including the subtypes of FL (n = 
83), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) (n = 28), and MZL (n = 18) for a total of 129 subjects. This study 
was designed to evaluate the effect of duvelisib 25 mg BID monotherapy in subjects with iNHL refractory to 
rituximab and to either chemotherapy or radioimmunotherapy (RIT).  
3.2.  Favourable  effects 
In the CLL study IPI-145-07 the median PFS (ITT population) for duvelisib was 13.3 months (95% CI: 12.1, 
16.8) and for ofatumumab 9.9 months (95% CI: 9.2, 11.3) with a hazard ratio of 0.52 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.70; 
p < 0.0001) and thus the study met its primary  endpoint demonstrating statistically significant superiority of 
duvelisib over ofatumumab for PFS per IRC.  
Approximately  60% of subjects received at least two prior  therapies. Median PFS was 16.4 months (95% CI: 
12.0, 20.5) for duvelisib versus 9.1 months for ofatumumab (95% CI: 7.9, 10.7), with a hazard ratio of 0.4 
(95% CI: 0.27, 0.59). Even though subjects with 17p del/TP53 mutation represent a high-risk group of CLL, 
the median PFS (ITT population) for duvelisib was only slightly lower (12.7 months subjects with mutation 
versus 14.7 months for subjects without mutation), also reflected in the ORR. Approximately  60% of subjects 
17p-patients received at least two prior  therapies. Median PFS was 12.8 months (95% CI: 8.9, 22.1) for 
duvelisib versus 8.7 months for ofatumumab (95% CI: 5.3, 12.6), with a hazard ratio of 0.36 (95% CI: 0.18, 
0.72). 
In the trial IPI-145-06 in iNHL the ORR for the FAS (N= 129) was 45.7% (59/129; 95% CI: 36.9, 54.7) per 
IRC assessment. All responses (59) were PRs. The FL population (N=83) did not meet the expected ORR for 
the FAS as ORR (FL) was 42.2% (35/83; 95% CI: 31.4, 53.5) with 1 CR and 34 PRs. The ORR for the 
subgroup of ≥ 2 prior therapies was 29/73 (39.7%; 95% CI: 29,52). The median DOR for the responders in 
IPI-145-06 was 10.0 months, but the estimated median DoR is uncertain due to early censoring. Results are 
in line with those reported for the IRC-based analysis as this was app. 10 months for both the ITT and 
patients with more than 2 prior  regimens.   
3.3.   Uncertainties  and limitations  about favourable effects 
For CLL patients with only 1 prior  therapy the median PFS was 12.7 months (95% CI: 9.1, 17.8) for duvelisib 
versus 12.0 months for ofatumumab (95% CI: 9.6, 12.8) with a hazard ratio of 0.8 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.28). The 
overall efficacy seems to be driven by the 60% of patients having received ≥ 2 prior  therapies. Thus, 
duvelisib seems to work better in heavily pre-treated CLL patients contrary to what is generally seen with 
regards to efficacy. A further limitation of the studied population is the fact patients with prior treatment with 
BTK-, bcl-2, and idelalisib were excluded. It is also acknowledged that comparison of the efficacy of duvelisib 
in CLL after ≥ 2 prior  treatment to ofatumumab, which was acceptable at the time of the trial initiation, may 
not be representative in the current context. 
The median OS of IPI-145-07 was not estimable in either treatment arm  and results are difficult to assess 
due to use of further anticancer therapy in both arms.  Of note, patients in the duvelisib arm may have been 
more likely to continue with currently approved therapies as next line than those in the ofatumumab arm. 
The applicant is recommended to provide the results of the final OS analysis after all subjects have been

followed for a minimum of five years (expected July 2021) for both the ITT and approved subgroup as a post-
marketing submission. A limitation of the studied population is the fact that patients with prior treatment with 
BTK-, bcl-2, and idelalisib were excluded. 
The data for the follicular lymphoma indication is based on a single-arm trial: All in all, there are limitations 
with respect to the presented data for FL in a single arm study with ORR as primary  endpoint. An RCT would 
have been preferred even though it is acknowledged that at study initiation a suitable effective comparator 
was not readily available. Randomised Study 327 is currently under discussion with the prospect of obtaining 
CHMP Scientific advice; results will be reported post-authorisation in line with a CHMP recommendation. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the only phase 3 study in patients with CLL, the incidence of various AEs by SOC and/or PT in the duvelisib 
arm (N=158) were generally higher than in the ofatumumab arm (N=155), which was also the case for SAEs.  
Almost all patients in both the duvelisib and ofatumumab arm  experienced a TEAE (98.7% vs. 92.9%). TEAEs 
with >10% higher incidence in the duvelisib arm compared to ofatumumab were: neutropenia (32.9% vs. 
20.6%), anaemia (32.9% vs. 20.6%), diarrhoea (50.6% vs. 12.3%), nausea (23.4% vs. 11%), constipation 
(16.5% vs. 8.4%), colitis (13.3% vs. 1.3%), abdominal pain (10.1% vs. 1.9%), pyrexia (28.5% vs. 10.3%), 
pneumonia (18.4% vs. 5.8%) and weight decreased (11.4% vs. 1.9%). 
TEAES ≥ grade 3 (87.3% vs. 48.4%) and TESAEs (72.8% vs. 32.3%) were reported with substantial higher 
frequency in the duvelisib arm compared to ofatumumab. Highest differences in TEAE of ≥grade 3 between 
duvelisib and ofatumumab were seen in the SOCs Blood and lymphatic system disorders (42.4 vs. 24.5%), 
Gastrointestinal disorders (32.3 vs. 2.6%) and Infections and infestations (33.5 vs. 11.0%). Treatment 
related TEAEs ≥ grade 3 were reported in 74.7% vs. 30.3%, related TESAEs in 53.2% vs. 10.3%. 
Hematologic and gastro-intestinal events were the most frequently reported treatment related TEAEs. 
TEAEs leading to dose reduction or dose hold were reported more frequently in the duvelisib arm: 79.1% vs. 
10.3%. In the duvelisib arm,  diarrhoea was the most common TEAE to result in dose hold or reduction 
(23.4%), followed by neutropenia (13.3%), pneumonia (10.8%), and colitis (10.8%). TEAEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation: 36.1% vs. 5.8%. TEAEs leading to discontinuation were divided over all SOCs, 
most frequently being GI disorders. 
TEAEs with an outcome of death: 12% (n=19) vs. 4.5% (n=7). Fatal TEAEs occurring in more than one 
subject included: bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (n = 2), pneumonia staphylococcal (n = 2), and 
haemorrhagic stroke (n = 2). Four subjects experienced fatal treatment related TEAEs: pneumonia 
staphylococcal (n = 2), general physical health deterioration and sepsis (n = 1, each). 
Overall, the AEs in the pooled FL population (N=93), the pooled CLL/SLL (N=303), and the All Heme 25 mg 
BID population (N=442) are of the same order as in the RCT. The updated safety data from Study VS-0145-
328 (443 received duvelisib 25 mg BID in the All Heme group) did not show any meaningful changes or new 
AEs. A slight increase in all AEs (All, ≥Grade 3, SAEs, Deaths, AESIs), as would be expected with time, was 
seen. 
Almost all patients experienced a TEAE (99.2%). The most common TEAEs were diarrhoea (44.2%), 
neutropenia (31.8%), nausea (28.7%), fatigue (24.0%), cough (24.0%), anaemia (22.5%), 
thrombocytopenia (20.9%), pyrexia (20.9%), rash (17.8%), and vomiting (17.1%). TEAEs Grade 3 or higher 
(83.7%) and TESAEs (57.4%) were reported in a substantial part of the study population. Treatment related 
assessment report

TEAEs ≥ grade 3 were reported in 67.4% and related TESAEs in 35.7%. The most common ≥Grade 3 TEAEs 
were neutropenia (23.3%), diarrhoea (14.7%), anaemia (11.6%), and thrombocytopenia (10.1%). TESAEs 
were mostly reported in the infections and infestations SOC (22.5%), as well as the blood and lymphatic 
system disorders SOC (12.4%) and gastrointestinal disorders SOC (15.5%). 
TEAEs leading to dose reduction or dose hold were reported in 64.3%. Nineteen (19, 14.7%) subjects had at 
least 1 TEAE that led to duvelisib dose reduction. TEAEs leading to duvelisib reduction in ≥ 2 subjects were: 
febrile neutropenia (n=3; 2.3%), neutropenia (n=2; 1.6%), diarrhoea (n=7; 5.4%), AST increased (n=2; 
1.6), and ALT increased (n=2; 1.6%). TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 24%. TEAEs 
leading to duvelisib discontinuation in ≥ 2 patients were disease progression (n=4), pneumonia (n=2), 
pneumonitis (n=3), and rash generalised (n=2). 
TEAEs with an outcome of death were reported in 10.9% (n=14) of the patients in study IPL-145-06, of 
which 11 occurred in the FL group. Four of the 14 deaths on treatment were assessed by the investigator as 
related to duvelisib: drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (FL), sepsis syndrome / toxic 
epidermal necrolysis (FL), septic shock (SLL), and viral infection (SLL).   
3.5.  Uncertainties  and limitations  about  unfavourable effects 
In patients treated with duvelisib the main uncertainties are related to the limitations of the studied 
population as patients with prior  treatment with BTK-,  bcl-2, and idelalisib were excluded.  
Safety comparison in the FL population is hampered by the single arm trial design as well as the short 
exposure (24 weeks) in this population.

3.7.   Benefit-risk  assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance  of favourable  and unfavourable  effects 
The efficacy of duvelisib in CLL after ≥ 2 prior treatment as measured by a longer median PFS of 16.4 
months compared to 9.1 months for ofatumumab, and a HR of 0.4 is clinically relevant as an alternative 
option in the further lines of CLL treatment, notwithstanding the challenges in the context of the present-day 
treatment landscape. 
The primary  data for the FL indication is collected from a single arm Phase 2 Study IPI-145-06. The clinical 
data underlying the FL indication is based on a limited number of patients (n=96 subjects) and derived from 
a subgroup analysis of a single arm  trial. In the primary  analysis of ORR per IRC in 83 patients with 
refractory FL duvelisib demonstrated an ORR of 42% (95% CI: 31, 54).  Phase 3 Randomised study VS-014-
327 in FL was issued by the FDA in response to marketing approval  in the US.  However,  the study design 
needs further clarification and no subjects have been enrolled within this protocol.  The applicant agreed with 
CHMP recommendations and is initiating discussions with the CHMP in view of seeking scientific advice on the 
study design and will provide the results as soon as available. 
Of note, the treatment landscape of R/R FL has changed since start of the pivotal trial (24 June 2013) with 
the PI3K inhibitor idelalisib as a treatment option for double-refractory FL (ESMO guideline 2016). The 
studied population consisted mainly of FL patients refractory to rituximab and chemotherapy (e.g. double 
refractory) and no previous PI3 kinase treatment. This patient population has become very rare due to 
changes in the treatment landscape. The indication was amended to only include refractory  FL, as best 
representing the clinical benefit of duvelisib in the studied population.   
The primary  safety issues identified with duvelisib include serious, including fatal, infections, diarrhoea or 
colitis, cutaneous reactions, and pneumonitis, along with serious hepatotoxicity and neutropenia.

The updated safety data from Study VS-0145-328 (443 received duvelisib 25 mg BID in the All Heme group) 
did not show any meaningful changes or new AEs. A slight increase in all AEs (All, ≥Grade 3, SAEs, deaths, 
AESIs), as would be expected with time,  was seen.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit/risk balance for Copiktra in the relapsed or refractory CLL setting after at least two prior  lines of 
therapy is positive.  
In the refractory FL indication and considering uncertainties discussed, the benefit/risk balance for Copiktra in 
the refractory setting after two prior  lines of therapy is positive.  
3.7.3.  Additional  considerations  on the benefit-risk balance 
N/A 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Copiktra is positive.   
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity  with authorised  orphan medicinal  products> 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Copiktra is not similar  to Gazyvaro (obinutuzumab) and Imbruvica (ibrutinib) 
within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Copiktra is favourable in the following indications: Relapsed or refractory chronic 
lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) after at least two prior  therapies; Follicular lymphoma (FL) that is refractory to 
at least two prior systemic therapies.   
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions  or restrictions  regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see section 4.2 of the SmPC).

Other  conditions and requirements  of the marketing  authorisation   
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions  or restrictions  with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal  product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Conditions  or restrictions  with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal  product to be implemented  by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
These conditions fully reflect the advice received from the PRAC.   
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that duvelisib is a new active substance 
as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

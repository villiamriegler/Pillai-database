Canagliflozin is an orally administered sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. It is approved in 
the European Union (EU) since November 15th 2013 (Invokana: EMEA/H/C/002649). Canagliflozin can be 
given as monotherapy or in combination with other medicinal products indicated for the treatment of T2DM. 
The current application is based on the recently completed Phase 3 study DNE3001 (Canagliflozin and Renal 
Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation Trial) (hereafter referred to as 
‘CREDENCE’).  
In the CREDENCE study, canagliflozin was compared to placebo in subjects with T2DM and stage 2 or 3 
chronic diabetic kidney disease (CKD) and macroalbuminuria.  
Based on the results of the CREDENCE study, the MAH sought to extend section 4.1 of the SmPC for 
Invokana in adults with T2DM with the following new indication:  
For the treatment of stage 2 or 3 chronic kidney disease and albuminuria, as an adjunct to standard of care, 
in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Updates are proposed to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), the package leaflet (PIL) and the 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) based on the assessment of CREDENCE data. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data, other than an updated ERA, have been submitted in this application, which was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has submitted an updated ERA based on the EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 guideline and the EMA 
Q&A document on ERA which also includes an assessment for Metformin. This ERA was submitted in 2013 
during the first registration of Vokanamet, a related fixed combination drug which additionally includes 
Assessment report  
EMA/306073/2020 
Page 8/94 
 
 
  
  
Metformin. The update consists mainly in a recalculation of the PECSurfacewater and all connected values 
including the risk quotients. The applicant did not identify any risk associated with the extension. 
The original ERA was assessed in 2013/2014. As it included the identical tests, no detailed assessment was 
necessary at this time only some entries in the ‘summary of main study results tables’ had to be slightly 
updated. The updated table is presented at the end of this assessment. 
The CHMP did not agree with the PEC refinement. First of all the maximal dose of Canagliflozin is 300 mg/d 
not 100 mg/d on which basis the assessment was conducted. Second the adjustment of the Fpen with sales 
forecast is not possible in Phase I. But since Phase IIA is reached an adjustment is possible at that stage. 
Therefore, the Fpen recalculation was assessed anyway. 
The applicant was asked to further clarify and, in case the Fpen has to be changed, to recalculate the 
PECSurfacewater and all connected values, including the risk quotients. 
Furthermore, an experimental logKow and a BCF study for Canagliflozin were submitted in the course of the 
first registration, the applicant was asked to include these in the updated ERA. 
As NOEC for the Activated Sludge Respiration Inhibition Test (OECD 209) of Canagliflozin the lowest test 
concentration (100 mg/L) should be used instead of the EC15 (368 mg/L). 
Moreover, as the summarized results of the test according to OECD TG 308 are not consistent with the 
results of the first assessment, the applicant was asked to update these. 
In May 2014 the EMA safety working party (SWP) decided that a disposal advice should be included in SmPC 
and package leaflet independent of the conclusions on the ERA. Therefore, the applicant was asked to 
include the following disposal advice as per EMA template: “Any unused medicinal product or waste material 
should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.”

2.4.1.  Main study 
A Randomized, Double-blind, Event-driven, Placebo-controlled, Multicenter 
Study of the Effects of Canagliflozin on Renal and Cardiovascular Outcomes in 
Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Diabetic Nephropathy (CREDENCE)  
Methods 
The CREDENCE study was a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled event-driven phase 
III study to evaluate the effect of canagliflozin on renal and CV outcomes in patients with T2DM with 
established nephropathy. 
CREDENCE was an event-driven study with a planned duration of 5 to 5.5 years and a target of 
approximately 844 primary efficacy endpoint events (doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD, renal or CV death. 
Figure 1: Study design Diagram 
According to the study protocol, the randomized subjects will return to the clinic at Week 3, Week 13, Week 
26, and every 26 weeks for laboratory assessments, concomitant medication review, adverse event

collection and determination of clinical endpoints. An interim analysis was planned, when approximately 405 
subjects had an adjudicated event within the primary composite endpoint. 
Study participants 
The original protocol was dated 10 December 2013. The first patient was screened on 21 February 2014 and 
the first subject was randomized on 24 March 2014.  
Key inclusion criteria 
In order to be enrolled in this study, the subjects had to meet the following key inclusion criteria: 
•  male or female ≥30 years-old with a clinical T2DM diagnosis 
•  HbA1c ≥6.5% to ≤12.0% 
•  eGFR ≥30 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2 (as determined using the Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology 
Collaboration [CKD-EPI] equation). An overall global target ratio for randomized cohort of 
approximately 60% : 40% for CKD Stage 3 : CKD Stage 2 was monitored centrally and entry of subjects 
with stage 2 CKD could be restricted on a regional and/or site basis to keep this CKD Stage 2 vs 3 ratio. 
•  urinary ACR >300 mg/g to ≤5,000 mg/g (>33.9 mg/mmol to ≤565.6 mg/mmol) 
For the pre-screening assessment where UACR is not routinely measured as per standard of care, it may 
be substituted by one of the following measures: albumin excretion rate >300 mg/24 hours, urine 
protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) >500 mg/g (>56.5 mg/mmol), or protein excretion rate >500 mg/24 
hours. 
•  All subjects must have been on a stable maximum tolerated labelled daily dose of ACEi or ARB for at 
least 4 weeks prior to randomization 
Key exclusion criteria 
Subjects were excluded from study participation, if they met any of the following exclusion criteria: 
Diabetes-Related/Metabolic 
•  History of diabetic ketoacidosis or type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) 
•  History of hereditary glucose-galactose malabsorption or primary renal glucosuria 
Renal/Cardiovascular 
•  Known medical history or clinical evidence suggesting nondiabetic renal disease 
•  Renal disease that required treatment with immunosuppressive therapy or a history of chronic 
dialysis or renal transplant (Note: Subjects with a history of treated childhood renal disease, without 
sequelae, could participate). 
•  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥180 and/or diastolic blood pressure 
[DBP] ≥100 mmHg) by Week -2 
•  Blood potassium level >5.5 mmol/L during screening 
•  Myocardial infarction, unstable angina, revascularization procedure (e.g., stent or bypass graft 
surgery), or cerebrovascular accident within 12 weeks before randomization, or a revascularization 
procedure was planned during the study 
•  Current or history of heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV cardiac disease 
(The Criteria Committee of the New York Heart Association) 
•  ECG findings within 12 weeks before randomization that would require urgent diagnostic evaluation 
or intervention (e.g., new clinically important arrhythmia or conduction disturbance) 
Assessment report  
EMA/306073/2020 
Page 12/94 
 
 
  
  
 
 
•  History of atraumatic amputation within past 12 months of screening, or an active skin ulcer, 
osteomyelitis, gangrene, or critical ischemia of the lower extremity within 6 months of screening. 
(Note: introduced in protocol Amendment INT-5.) 
Other Conditions 
•  History of malignancy within 5 years before screening (exceptions: squamous and basal cell 
carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma of the cervix in situ, or a malignancy that in the opinion of the 
investigator, with concurrence with the sponsor’s medical monitor, is considered cured with minimal 
risk of recurrence) 
Medications/Therapies 
•  Combination use of ACEi and ARB 
•  Use of MRA or a direct renin inhibitor (DRI) (Note, post-randomization use of MRAs was prohibited 
until INT-4. Thereafter, treatment with an MRA was allowed if determined medically necessary over 
the course of the double-blind treatment period, while continuing on study drug.) 
Note: If deemed clinically appropriate at the discretion of the investigator, subjects may be removed 
from therapy with MRA or DRI during screening. Subjects who are off therapy with MRA or DRI for 
at least 8 weeks prior to randomization may be considered eligible for enrolment. 
Treatments 
After completion of initial screening, the potentially eligible subjects entered a 2-week run-in period, during 
which single-blind placebo capsules were administered once daily to assess compliance. 
During the double-blind treatment period, the doses and treatment regimens were: 
•  Canagliflozin 100 mg tablets, administered orally once daily until the end of the study  
• 
Placebo administered orally once daily until the end of the study  
The study drug was administered at the study site on day 1. After day 1, the study participants were 
instructed to take 1 capsule of canagliflozin 100 mg or matching placebo once daily before the first meal of 
the day during the study period. The projected study duration was 5 to 5.5 years (adjusted from 5.5 years 
to 5 – 5.5 years in amendment INT-4).  
Background therapies:  
Concomitant therapies: 
•  Medications are optimized during screening period as required by local standard guidelines (including 
antihyperglycemic, lipid-lowering, and anti-hypertensive therapy). 
•  ACEi or ARB should remain stable after the maximum tolerated dose is achieved. 
•  Medication doses should be kept stable for approximately 4 weeks prior to randomization. 
•  Medications with impact on serum creatinine levels (e.g., NSAIDs, trimethoprim, cimetidine, 
probenecid, aminoglycosides, amphotericin, ketoconazole, and clofibrate) should be kept stable during 
the screening period. 
Prohibited therapies (see also exclusion criteria above):  
•  other SGLT2 inhibitors 
•  combinations of ACEi and ARB 
•  direct renin inhibitors (DRI) 
•  mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) (after amendment INT-4, however, MRA treatment was 
allowed during the double-blind treatment period if deemed medically necessary).

Objectives 
Primary objective 
In subjects with T2DM, Stage 2 or 3 CKD and macroalbuminuria who are receiving standard of care, to 
assess the efficacy of canagliflozin relative to placebo in reducing 
• 
the composite endpoint of ESKD, doubling of serum creatinine, and renal or CV death 
For secondary and exploratory objectives, please refer to section “Outcomes/endpoints” below. 
Safety Objective: To assess the overall safety and tolerability of canagliflozin. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy outcome: 
composite endpoint of  
• 
the first occurrence of ESKD (defined as initiation of maintenance dialysis for at least 1 month, or renal 
transplantation, or a sustained eGFR of <15 mL/min/1.73m2 determined by CKD-EPI formula and 
confirmed by repeat central laboratory measure ≥30 days and preferably within 60 days) 
•  doubling of serum creatinine (from baseline average; sustained and confirmed by repeat central 
laboratory measure ≥30 days and preferably within 60 days) 
• 
renal death (death in subjects with ESKD, without initiating renal replacement therapy, no other cause 
of death determined via adjudication) 
•  or CV death: death due to MI, stroke, heart failure, sudden death, death during a CV procedure or as a 
result of procedure-related complications, presumed sudden CV death, death of unknown cause, or 
death resulting from a documented CV cause other than those listed above (e.g., aneurysm, peripheral 
vascular disease [PVD]).  
An independent endpoint adjudication committee (IEAC) adjudicates all components of this composite 
endpoint. 
Secondary efficacy outcome: 
•  composite endpoint of CV death and hospitalized heart failure 
• 
the composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and non-fatal stroke (ie, 
3-point MACE)

•  Blood pressure 
•  Fasting plasma lipids 
Sample size 
The study was planned to include ~ 4200 subjects with the aim to observe occurrence of primary efficacy 
events in 844 unique randomized subjects until the global trial end date. The study was designed to have a 
power of 90% to detect a 20% relative risk reduction (effect of treatment discontinuation on the primary 
endpoint) at a 2-sided significance level of 5%.  
Additionally, it was assumed that the composite endpoint occurs in the placebo arm at an event rate of 6.5% 
per year. Moreover, a premature treatment discontinuation rate of 6% and an overall lost-to-follow-up were 
considered in sample size determination. The duration of enrolment was expected to be 27 months, and the 
study duration (from first randomization of a subject to last end-of-study visit) was estimated to be 60 
months.  
It is noted that the sample size was originally planned to be 3,700 subjects but was increased to 4,200 
subjects with amendment INT-4 from January 19th 2016 to increase the likelihood of accruing endpoints 
within the primary composite.  
Additionally, amendment INT-4 removed the global cap limiting enrollment of subjects with eGFR ≥60 to 
<90 mL/min/1.73 m2 to ~25%. Instead, a ratio of 60%:40% regional and/or site level CKD Stage 3 (eGFR 
≥30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2; first category): CKD Stage 2 (eGFR ≥60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2; second 
category) was allowed. Moreover, text was revised to list post-baseline use of MRAs as restricted rather than 
strictly prohibited. 
Randomisation 
To assess compliance, the study included a 2-week placebo run-in period (+ 14 days) starting at Visit 1. 
Randomization number, medication numbers, and treatment code, which is linked to the randomization 
schedule, are assigned at baseline (day 1) via central randomization using an interactive web response 
system (IWRS). Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment groups according to on a 
computer-generated randomization schedule prepared under sponsor supervision. The randomization was 
Assessment report  
EMA/306073/2020 
Page 15/94 
 
 
  
  
balanced by using randomly permuted blocks and was stratified by pre-treatment eGFR (≥30 to <45, ≥45 
to <60, ≥60 to <90 mL/min/1.73m2).  
Blinding (masking) 
Blinding at study site level 
The run-in period was performed in a single-blinded, the randomised treatment period in a double-blinded 
manner.  
The canagliflozin 100 mg dose was administered as a gray-colored hard, gelatine capsule containing a tablet 
embedded in microcrystalline cellulose. The matching placebo capsules consisted of microcrystalline 
cellulose within a gray-colored, hard, gelatine capsule. The study drug was packaged as individual bottles. 
Unblinding to the study site was only possible in case of emergencies requiring knowledge of treatment 
status for further treatment/course of action. Breaking the blinding had to be reported to the sponsor as 
soon as possible (telephone contact available 24/7). The treatment assignment revealed after unblinding 
was retained with the subject's source documents in a secure manner (e.g., sealed envelope) to avoid 
unblinding to the study site or sponsor personnel. No site level emergency unblinding of any subjects took 
place during the study. 
Urine glucose results were not reported by the central laboratory. Investigators were counselled to avoid 
performing local urinalysis with dipstick unless required for urgent medical management. 
Blinding at sponsor level 
All randomization codes were released to the sponsor after completion of the study at the time of database 
lock. For the purpose of the planned interim analysis, the randomization codes were disclosed only to those 
authorized to have access in order to carry out the analysis. 
Monitoring and adjudication committees 
Suspected endpoint events (ESKD, doubling of serum creatinine, death, MI, stroke, hospitalized unstable 
angina, hospitalized congestive heart failure) were to be verified and confirmed by an Endpoint Adjudication 
Committee (CEC) that remains blinded to treatment assignment.   
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) was responsible for monitoring unblinded safety and 
endpoint data by treatment group throughout the course of the trial. Based upon this monitoring, the IDMC 
recommends changes to the conduct of the trial to the chairpersons of the CREDENCE steering committee. 
Moreover, the IDMC reviews and evaluates unblinded safety and efficacy results from the pre-specified 
interim analysis. 
Statistical methods 
Data from CREDENCE were analyzed using the following 3 analysis sets: 
• 
Intent-to-treat (ITT): all randomized subjects, including data from Day 1 to the last study contact 
date up to the global trial end date (GTED) 
•  On-study: all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug, including data from Day 1 to the 
last study contact date up to the GTED 
•  On-treatment: all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug, including data from Day 1 to 
the last dose date plus X days, or the last study contact date, whichever occurred earlier; X was 2

days for laboratory and vital sign measurements and 30 days for adverse event, CV, renal, and 
mortality endpoints. 
Analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints were based on the ITT analysis set. Premature 
discontinuation of study treatment did not comprise study completion and was not a criterion for withdrawal 
from the study. All subjects who prematurely discontinued study treatment were to continue subsequent 
study visits and post-treatment follow-up evaluations. An On-treatment analysis (which includes primary 
composite endpoints with an onset after the initiation of double-blind study medication and before the last 
study medication date plus 30 days) was performed to assess the consistency of the primary efficacy 
analysis. 
The comparison of canagliflozin versus placebo for the primary efficacy endpoint was analyzed using a 
stratified Cox proportional hazard model including treatment as the explanatory variable, with stratification 
of the baseline hazard by screening eGFR (≥30 to <45, ≥45 to <60, ≥60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2). To 
assess the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis, sensitivity analysis of the primary composite 
endpoint using a log-rank test stratified by screening eGFR was also performed. The estimated treatment 
effect was expressed as the relative risk reduction (1 minus HR), HR, and 95% CI. Ratios of cause-specific 
hazards between the treatment groups were obtained for each component of the primary efficacy composite 
endpoint, using similar methods as for the primary efficacy composite endpoint. 
The cumulative incidence of the primary composite endpoint over time was presented using Kaplan-Meier 
curves for each of the 2 treatment groups. Cumulative incidence curves were also presented for each of the 
components of the primary composite (doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD, renal death, and CV death) in 
order to assess competing risks, depending on the event counts of the individual components. 
An interim analysis was planned after approximately 405 subjects experienced an adjudicated primary 
composite endpoint, as confirmed by the EAC. At the interim analysis, the primary efficacy endpoint was 
tested with alpha of 0.01 as determined by the alpha spending function taking form of ατϕ with τ as the 
information fraction and ϕ = 2.19. After review of the interim results, the IDMC recommended stopping the 
study for efficacy based on the pre-specified stopping rules (2-sided p-value for comparison of the primary 
composite endpoint of <0.01, and 2-sided p-value of the composite endpoint of ESKD, renal death, and CV 
death comparison of <0.025, both in favor of canagliflozin 100 mg). Based on the IDMC recommendation, 
the decision was taken to conclude the study and the GTED was announced on 16 July 2018 and final visits 
were subsequently conducted. A total of 585 subjects were confirmed by the EAC to have experienced a 
primary composite endpoint through the end of the GTED period on 30 October 2018. The test of the primary 
composite endpoint was based on the data accrued through the final clinic visit where the significance level 
was determined by the alpha spending function (two-sided alpha=0.022). 
The consistency of the treatment effect on the primary composite endpoint was assessed across different 
baseline demographic variables (eg, age, race, sex) as well as other important baseline disease 
characteristics (eg, history of prior CV disease, duration of diabetes, baseline HbA1c, baseline eGFR, 
baseline ACR). 
A pre-specified multiple imputation analysis was performed to assess the impact, if any, of missing follow-up 
for either clinical outcomes or laboratory assessments on the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis. As 
described in the supplemental SAP (Appendix 9), event imputation for the clinical outcomes (ie, dialysis, 
renal transplantation and CV/renal death) proceeded via a retrieved dropout approach, whereas missing 
laboratory data was imputed assuming the data were missing at random for the on-treatment period and 
assumed to follow a copy control pattern for the off-treatment period. This process was repeated 1,000 
times. The imputed data were integrated with the observed data to generate 1,000 replicates of the primary 
composite endpoint data and the data were combined into a single inferential summary using Rubin’s rule. 
The secondary outcomes were analyzed using methods similar to those described for the primary composite 
endpoint analysis.

Testing of the secondary efficacy endpoints was based on the data accrued through the final clinic visit 
(which was planned regardless of the study stopping after the interim analysis or proceeding to the planned 
completion of 844 primary composite events) using a two-sided alpha of 0.038. A closed testing procedure 
was implemented to control the family-wise type I error rate at 5% for the primary and secondary endpoints. 
The hypothesis of superiority on primary and major secondary efficacy endpoints of canagliflozin versus 
placebo was tested in a hierarchical order. If an individual test during any step was not statistically 
significant, later tests were considered nominal.

Duration of follow-up 
The study had a mean follow-up time of 2.6 years (136.23 weeks) with comparable study durations between 
the canagliflozin (137.93 weeks) and the placebo (135.71 weeks) group.  
Completion of the study on study drug 
There were 4 randomised patients (2 in each group) who did not receive study drug (Figure 2). 
A subject was considered having completed the study, regardless of whether the subject was on or off study 
drug, if the subject was followed from randomization until a time point after the notification of the global trial 
end date (GTED) or until the time of death (for subjects who died prior to GTED notification). On placebo, the 
study was completed by 2,174 (98.9%) patients, while 2187 (99.3%) patients completed the study on 
canagliflozin.  
More patients discontinued the study drug prematurely in the placebo group (658; 29.9%) as compared to 
the canagliflozin group (543; 24.7%). 11 patients in the placebo group and 5 patients in the canagliflozin 
group withdrew consent. 13 placebo-treated subjects and 9 canagliflozin-treated subjects were lost to follow 
up. One patient in each group discontinued the study due to site closure. 
At the end of the study, the vital status was unknown for 2 placebo and 4 canagliflozin subjects. 
The Kaplan-Meier plot of time to discontinuation from study medication (on treatment analysis set) in Figure 
3 shows that the rate of study drug discontinuation was higher in the placebo group (13.87/100 subject 
years) as compared to the canagliflozin group (11.05/100 patient years). The most common reasons for 
discontinuation were adverse events (12.5%) and personal reasons (8.5 %).

The interim analysis was conducted on July 9th 2018, when 413 subjects had experienced the primary 
composite endpoint (adjudicated by the EAC). The IDMC recommended stopping the study early, because 
the efficacy objectives specified in the IDMC charter were met. The GTED period was announced on July 16th 
2018, and 585 primary composite endpoints were accrued through the end of the GTED on October 30th 
2018.

Recruitment 
The study was conducted at 690 centers in 34 countries. 26.9% of the subjects (n=1,182) were enrolled in 
North America, 19.6% (n=864) in Europe, 21.4% (n=941) in Central/South America, and 32.1 % (n=1414) 
in the rest of the world.  
The study lasted from February 21st 2014 (Date first subject signed informed consent) to October 30th 2018 
(Date of last observation for last subject recorded as part of the database). 
Conduct of the study 
Changes in the conduct of the study 
The study was completed on 30 October 2018.  
The protocol underwent 6 substantial global amendments. The most important changes are listed in the 
following:  
INT-1 (12 June 2014): The amendment included mainly clarifications. In addition, an assessment of 
stroke disability was introduced to evaluate stroke outcomes. 
INT-2 (03 February 2015): The amendment included e.g. several clarifications, additional instructions on 
eligibility of subjects for study enrolment, a widening of the range of pre-screening albuminuria/proteinuria 
measures. Moreover, other changes regarding to the pre-screening phase were included, e.g. subjects who 
failed local laboratory pre-screening assessments were allowed to repeat the laboratory tests.  
Most importantly, however, the inclusion criteria were revised to allow subjects with higher baseline HbA1c. 
The upper HbA1c limit was changed from “≤10.5%” to ”≤12.0%”. It is noted, however, that this change was 
not accepted by DE, which resulted in the country-specific amendment DEU-1 (see below). 
INT-3 (29 September 2015): This amendment intended to inform investigators of additional safety 
reporting requirements associated with DKA. Moreover, the event time frame for the exclusion criteria #7 
(myocardial infarction, unstable angina, revascularization procedure or cerebrovascular accident), #14 
(major surgery) and #18 (current use of SGLT2 inhibitor) was changed from “prior to screening” to “prior to 
randomization”. Finally, background information, pre-clinical and clinical data related to bone fracture and 
decrease in bone mineral density were added. 
INT-4 (19 January 2016): Two secondary endpoints were added and the hierarchical order of testing of 
the secondary endpoints was adjusted. Moreover, the sample size was expanded from 3,700 to 4,200 
subjects to increase the likelihood of accruing endpoints within the primary composite. Finally, the global cap 
that limited enrolment of subjects with eGFR ≥60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2 to ~25% was removed to allow 
more of these subjects to participate in the study. Text was added to allow a ratio of 60%:40% regional 
and/or site level CKD Stage 3 (eGFR ≥30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2; first category): CKD Stage 2 (eGFR ≥60 
to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2; second category).  
Moreover, text was revised to list post-baseline use of MRAs as restricted rather than strictly prohibited (in 
connection with a hyperkalemia warning). 
INT-5 (06 May 2016): The amendment added several clarifications, e.g. that all potential sustained 
doublings of serum creatinine values are derived from a baseline average determination rather than a single 
baseline value. Moreover, exclusion criterion #16 was added to exclude patients with a history of atraumatic 
amputation within past 12 months of screening, or an active skin ulcer, osteomyelitis, gangrene, or critical 
ischemia of the lower limb extremity within 6 months of screening.  
Assessment report  
EMA/306073/2020 
Page 20/94 
 
 
  
  
Addition of new safety information and guidance regarding subject management surrounding the event of 
lower-extremity amputation. A statement was added that study drug should be interrupted for subjects 
developing conditions associated with amputation. The Italian health authority did not agree with some of 
the changes made in INT-5 regarding subjects with a history of amputation, resulting in the country-specific 
amendment ITA-1 (see below). 
INT-6 (06 September 2017): 
Two new secondary endpoints were added and the order of hierarchical testing of the endpoints was 
adjusted. Moreover, the number of events (number of subjects meeting the primary composite endpoint) 
required for interim analysis was reduced from 540 to 405. Furthermore, occurrences of pancreatitis were 
designated as adverse events of special interest. Finally, several clarifications were added. 
Moreover, 4 country-specific amendments (Japan, Germany, India, Italy) were added to the study protocol. 
The changes influencing selection of study participants are detailed in the following: 
Japan (JPN-1: 24 October 2014; JPN-2: 23 February 2018): JPN-1was based on INT-1 and intended 
to clarify that all potential sustained doublings of serum creatinine values are derived from a baseline 
average determination rather than a single baseline value. Moreover, guidance was added regarding foot 
care and reducing risk of amputation and an exclusion criterion was added to exclude individuals at a higher 
risk for lower-extremity amputation. Additional safety reporting requirements associated with DKA where 
also clarified by JPN-1. 
JPN-2 was based on INT-6 and corrected 3 collection time-points for fasting plasma glucose to match the 
global protocol. 
Germany (DEU-1: 05 October 2015): The German health authority did not approve the increase in the 
upper inclusionary threshold of HbA1c that was changed in the global Amendment INT-2 from ≤10.5% to 
≤12.0%. Therefore, the upper limit was kept at ≤10.5% in Germany.  
India (IND-1: 05 February 2016): based on global Amendment INT-4, an archive sample collection at 
week 13 should be added (or week 26 if missed at week 13). 
Italy (ITA-1: 20 September 2016): The primary reason for the country-specific amendment in Italy 
(based on global Amendment INT-5) was that the Italian health authority did not agree with some of the 
changes made in INT-5 regarding subjects with a history of amputation. Specifically, they did not agree 
with: (1) the exclusion of subjects with atraumatic amputation within the past 12 months of screening, or an 
active skin ulcer, osteomyelitis, gangrene or critical ischemia of the lower extremity within 6 months of 
screening; instead, the Italian healthy authority required that subjects with any history of these events 
(regardless of duration) be excluded and (2) the requirement that subjects who experienced a 
lower-extremity amputation or developed a condition that led to an amputation would be temporarily 
discontinued from study drug; instead, the Italian healthy authority required that such subjects be 
permanently discontinued from study drug. All other global changes in INT-5 were incorporated. 
Protocol deviations 
Overall, there were 1,356 patients with protocol deviations. There were numerically more disallowed 
concomitant treatments in the placebo group as compared to the canagliflozin group. The other deviations 
were balanced between the treatment groups. The most common deviations assigned to the largest group of 
“other” deviations were related to delays in signing of updated versions of the Informed Consent Form 
following randomization.

Baseline data 
The following tables provide an overview over the baseline characteristics: 
Assessment report  
EMA/306073/2020 
Page 23/94 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Demographic characteristics (intent-to-treat analysis set) 
The mean age of the overall patient population was 63.0 years. 46.7% of patients were ≥65 years and 
10.1% were ≥75 years. 66.1% of patients were male and 33.9% were female.  
Randomisation occurred worldwide (Europe: 19.6%; North America: 26.9%; Central/South America: 
21.4%; “rest of the world”: 32.1%). 66.6% of patients were white, 19.9% were Asian and 5.1% black or 
African American.  
Baseline anthropometric Characteristics (intent-to-treat analysis set) 
The mean body weight of the overall population was 87.1 kg, corresponding to a mean BMI of 31.3 kg/m2. 
Overall, 53.9% of the population had a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2.  
Baseline diabetes characteristics (intent-to-treat analysis set; see also Table 2) 
Overall, the mean diabetes duration was 15.78 years with 74.7% of patients having T2DM since ≥ 10 years. 
The mean HbA1c for all subjects was 8.27%, which is consistent with mild to moderate hyperglycemia. In 
53.2% of patients, the baseline HbA1c was ≥8.0%. An HbA1c > 10 (n = 450) was measured in 10.2% of 
patients. It is noted that with amendment INT-2 (03 February 2015), the upper HbA1c limit for inclusion was 
changed from “≤10.5%” to “≤12.0%”. 
The subjects showed a mean baseline eGFR of 56.2 mL/min/1.73 m2, reflecting the inclusion criteria of eGFR 
≥30 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The baseline eGFR was <60.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 in ~60% of the population. The 
eGFR strata of 30 to <45, 45 to <60, and 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2 comprised 27.1%, 28.8%, and 35.4% 
Assessment report

of all subjects. The proportion of patients in the highest eGFR stratum reflects amendment INT-4 that 
permitted up to 40% of patients to be randomized with an eGFR ≥60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2. 56 patients 
had been stratified into the incorrect eGFR stratum, including 2 subjects without a screening eGFR 
measurement. Impaired kidney function of the study subjects was also reflected by a urinary 
albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 1,381 mg/g at baseline (> 1,000 mg/g in 46.6% of subjects). Normo- 
or microalbuminuria was reported in 12.0% of all subjects at baseline, although all patients were required to 
have macroalbuminuria (ACR > 300 mg/g) at screening.

Use of concomitant medication and treatment compliance 
Medications at randomisation 
ACEi and ARBs:  
For at least 4 weeks prior to randomization, all subjects had to be on a stable maximum tolerated labelled 
daily dose of ACEi or ARB. Five subjects had entered the study without being treated with ACEi or ARB. All 
other patients were on a maximum tolerated labeled dose of an ACEi or ARB. The maximum-labelled dose 
was reached by 72% of the subjects with balanced distribution over the treatment groups. In 27.9% of 
subjects, the maximum labelled dose was not reached. This was mostly due to hypotension, acute renal 
failure, or hyperkalemia (reasons similar across treatment groups).  
Other CV therapies: 
At randomization, 92.1% of all subjects were on at least 1 CV therapy, with no difference between treatment 
groups. Most common CV therapies: statins (69.0%), anti-thrombotics (including aspirin) (59.6%), calcium 
channel blockers (48.4%), beta-blockers (40.2%), loop (21.7%) and non-loop (28.9%) diuretics. No 
subject was taking both types of diuretics concomitantly. Only 0.5 % of all subjects used MRAs at baseline.  
Antihyperglycemic agents (AHAs): 
At  randomization,  99.5%  of  subjects  received  AHA  therapy.  Most  common  medications  were  insulin 
(65.5%),  biguanides  (57.8%),  sulphonyl  ureas  (28.8%)  and  dipeptidyl  peptidase  4  (DPP-4)  inhibitors 
(17.1%).

ACEi and ARBs:  
At the end of the study, 10.1% of all subjects (canagliflozin group: 9.0%; placebo: 11.2%) in the 
Intent-to-treat analysis set had discontinued their ACEi or ARB. 
Nearly all subjects entered the study on ACEi/ ARB (99.9%). At week 52 97.1% of subjects were still on 
ACEi/ ARB therapy, at week 104 94.6% and at week 208 93.5%. 
Other CV therapies: 
A greater proportion of subjects in the placebo group (40.3%) initiated a CV therapy compared with the 
canagliflozin group (31.1%). The most common newly initiated CV therapies were loop diuretics (12.0%) 
and calcium channel blockers (10.1%). The percentage of patients initiating a CV therapy was numerically 
higher in the placebo as compared to the canagliflozin group for all types of medications. MRAs were newly 
initiated by 3.8 % of all subjects. This had become possible through amendment INT-4, which changed the 
instructions regarding post-baseline use of MRAs from “strictly prohibited” to “restricted” (in connection with 
a hyperkalemia warning). 
Antihyperglycemic agents (AHAs): 
A  greater  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  (19.8%)  as  compared  to  the  canagliflozin  group 
(14.9%)  initiated  a  new  AHA  therapy,  most  commonly  insulin  (5.2%)  and  DPP-4  inhibitors  (4.5%).  The 
percentage of patients initiating an AHA therapy was numerically higher in the placebo as compared to the 
canagliflozin group for all types of medications. 
Overall,  1.3  %  of  subjects  received  a  prohibited  therapy  with  a  non-investigational  SGLT2  inhibitor 
(canagliflozin: 1.1%; placebo: 1.5%) with the majority of subjects being off study drug (canagliflozin group: 
0.9%; placebo group: 1.0%).

Treatment compliance 
A log of all drug dispensed and returned was maintained. Subjects were clearly instructed with regard to 
compliance with study procedures at screening visit. During the course of the study, any subject who was 
not compliant with taking the study drug or with making required clinic visits was re-educated with 
additional instructions. The initial compliance was assessed during the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in 
period. Overall, 34 subjects (0.8%) discontinued the study medication due to poor compliance. These 
patients were evenly distributed over the treatment groups (canagliflozin: 0.7%; placebo: 0.8%). 
Numbers analysed 
The full analysis set includes all randomised patients assessed according to their randomised study drug 
assignment (2201 patients in the Cana group, 2199 patients in the placebo group). 
The SAS includes all randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug and for whom any data 
are available from any time after first dose of study drug until the end of the study, assessed according to the 
treatment they actually received. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary composite endpoint: Doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD and renal or CV 
death 
Canagliflozin reduced the incidence of the composite endpoint of doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD and 
renal or CV death (ITT population: HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.59 to 0.82], p<0.0001). Except for renal death, a 
substantial number of events was reached for each component of the primary composite; . the number of 
patients with renal death was too low (n=7) for a meaningful statistical analysis.  
The difference between the treatment groups with regard to CV death did not reach significance and the HR 
included unity (HR 0.78 [CI 0.61 to 1.00], p = 0.0502). The components of doubling of serum creatinine 
(p<0.0001) and of ESKD (p=0.0015) reached significance. The results from the ITT analysis set were 
confirmed by the on-treatment analysis set (HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.53 to 0.78), which, however, did not 
contain any renal deaths.

Figure 4 shows the Kaplan-Meier plot for the first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint over time: 
Figure 4: Kaplan-Meier plot for first occurrence of the primary composite endpoint over time 
(ITT analysis set). 
As demonstrated by a pre-specified multiple imputation analysis, missing follow-up data for either clinical 
outcomes or laboratory assessments had negligible impact on the robustness of the primary efficacy 
analysis. HR and CI of the multiple imputation analysis were highly consistent with the corresponding results 
from primary analysis.  
Ancillary analyses 
The consistency of the treatment effect in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint compared to 
placebo was investigated in subgroup analyses defined by demographic (age, race, sex, ethnicity, region) 
and baseline disease characteristics (duration of diabetes, with or without a history of CV disease, baseline 
HbA1c, baseline body mass index, screening eGFR strata, baseline eGFR, baseline urinary ACR, baseline 
SBP, history of amputation, history of heart failure). 
No significant statistical heterogeneity was observed across the pre-specified subgroups, such that patients 
within individual subgroups experienced varying degrees of benefit, with the point estimates for all HRs less 
than 1.0. 
However, the following differences between subgroups are noted: 
(1)  Ethnicity: Stronger canagliflozin effect in Hispanic or Latino subjects (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.81) 
as compared to other ethnicities (HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.91) 
(2)  Region: Stronger effect of canagliflozin in patients from Central/South America (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 
0.43, 0.88) and “Rest of the World” (HR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.78) as compared to subjects from 
North America (HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.13) and Europe (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.54, 1.24). 
Assessment report  
EMA/306073/2020 
Page 32/94 
 
 
  
  
 
 
HbA1c: Stronger effect of canagliflozin in subjects with HbA1C ≥ 8% (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.79) 
as compared to subjects with HbA1c < 8% (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.99). This difference appears to 
be strongly driven by the renal components of the primary composite endpoint (cf.  
Figure 10 below, showing a subgroup analysis for the secondary composite renal endpoint of 
“doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD and renal death”). 
(3)  eGFR strata: The most pronounced canagliflozin effect was observed in the CKD stage 3a population 
(eGFR from 45 to <60 ml/min/1,73 m2; HR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.72), while the effect was weaker 
for stage 3b CKD (eGFR from 30 to < 45 ml/min/1.73 m2; HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.95). The 
weakest effect (CI including unity) was observed for stage 2 CKD (eGFR from 60 to < 90 ml/min/1.73 
m2; HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.60, 1.12). 
(4)  History of heart failure: Canagliflozin was less effective with regard to the primary composite 
endpoint in subjects with a history of heart failure (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.61, 1.31) as compared to 
subjects with no history of heart failure (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.79). This difference seems to be 
mainly caused by differences in CV death, because it was also visible in the analysis of secondary CV 
composite endpoints.

Supportive analyses including individual primary composite endpoint components 
The HR was < 1 for all other primary composite endpoint components (doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD, 
CV death). Since the 95% CI included unity in case of CV death, no statistically significant effect of treatment 
was demonstrated for this primary composite endpoint component.  
The most common causes of CV death in the canagliflozin as well as the placebo group were sudden cardiac 
death, heart failure or cardiogenic shock and undetermined death. For every cause of CV death, the 
incidence rate was lower in the canagliflozin group as compared to the placebo arm. 
The Kaplan-Meier analysis of “time to CV death”, is shown in the following figure: 
Figure 6: Kaplan-Meier plot of time to CV death (ITT analysis set) 
Supportive analyses including secondary efficacy outcomes: 
Composite endpoint of CV death and hospitalized heart failure 
The incidence of the composite endpoint of CV death and hospitalized heart failure was significantly reduced 
in the canagliflozin group (HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.83, which was mainly due to a reduction in hospitalized 
heart failure; see next section below). By contrast, as discussed above, reduction of CV death was not 
significant (95% CI included 1). Separation of the curves in the Kaplan-Meier plot occurred after ~52 weeks. 
In  
Figure 7, the results of a subgroup analysis of this secondary composite endpoint are shown with regard to 
the subgroups with the most prominent heterogeneity between strata.

Figure 7: Subgroup analysis (Forest Plot of Hazard Ratios and 95% CI) of the first occurrence of 
the composite endpoint of CV death and hospitalized heart failure (ITT set) 
Hospitalized heart failure 
The incidence of hospitalized heart failure was significantly reduced in the canagliflozin group (HR: 0.61; 
95% CI: 0.47, 0.80). Separation of the curves in the Kaplan-Meier plot occurred already very early (< 10 
weeks). A subgroup analysis of this secondary endpoint revealed similar differences as described for the 
composite endpoint of CV death and hospitalized heart failure for BMI, baseline SBP, screening eGFR strata, 
baseline SBP categories, history of amputation and history of heart failure. However, significance (p = 
0.0228) was only reached for baseline SBP. The difference for the age subgroups was less pronounced than 
in the secondary composite endpoint of CV death and hospitalized heart failure .  
The effect of canagliflozin on hospitalized heart failure was reduced in Hispanic or Latino subjects as 
compared to other ethnicities. This difference was also reflected in a reduced effect of canagliflozin in 
subjects from Central/South America as compared to subjects from other regions. 
Composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and non-fatal stroke (=3-point MACE) 
Canagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of MACE as compared to placebo (HR=0.80; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.95; 
p=0.0121). As shown in Figure 14 below, separation of the curves for the 3-point MACE in the Kaplan-Meier 
plot occurred already very early (at < 10 weeks of treatment). Results of the individual components showed 
consistent effects (Table 24 below). None of the individual MACE components reached significance.  
Regarding the endpoint “nonfatal stroke”, the most common type was ischemic stroke in both groups. 
Post-stroke disability was higher in the canagliflozin-treated group as compared to the placebo group (Mean 
change of modified Rankin scores from pre-stroke to month 3 post-stroke: 2.3 in the canagliflozin group, but

only 1.6 in the placebo group). Assessment of stroke disability had been introduced with amendment INT-1 
on 12 June 2014. 
In the following Figure, the results of a subgroup analysis (those with the most prominent heterogeneity) of 
the secondary composite endpoint MACE are shown:

Renal composite endpoint of ESKD, doubling of serum creatinine, and renal death 
The risk for the renal composite endpoint of doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD and renal death was 
significantly reduced by canagliflozin 100 mg as compared to placebo (HR=0.66; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.81; 
p<0.0001).  
Regarding the individual endpoints of the composite, no meaningful statistical analysis could be performed 
for the risk of renal death, as only 7 events were counted. The two other individual endpoints, however, 
reached both significance (doubling of serum creatinine: HR=0.60; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.76; p<0.0001 and 
ESKD: HR=0.68; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.86; p=0.0015).  
The individual subcomponents of the ESKD endpoint occurred with lower incidence rate in the canagliflozin 
as compared to the placebo group: 
−  eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m2:  
HR=0.60; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.80; p=0.0004 
−  dialysis initiated and kidney transplantation:  HR=0.74; 95% CI: 0.55, 1.00; p=0.0486 
−  dialysis initiated: 
HR=0.75; 95% CI: 0.55; 1.01; p=0.0562

Figure 9: Kaplan-Meier estimates of first occurrence of renal composite endpoint (doubling of 
serum creatinine, ESKD, renal death; ITT set) 
The analysis of the renal composite endpoint by subgroups revealed potentially meaningful interactions with 
regard to region, baseline HbA1c, screening and baseline eGFR as well as baseline ACR categories. None of 
these interactions, however, was significant. The strongest (albeit non-significant) interactions are shown in 
Figure 10.

CV death 
This endpoint was part of the primary efficacy endpoint. See corresponding discussion above and Table 5 as 
well as Table 6.  
As CV death did not reach significance, the hierarchical testing was stopped at this point. 
All-cause mortality (not formally tested; only nominal p-values) 
The risk of ACM was numerically reduced by canagliflozin (HR=0.83; 95% CI: 0.68, 1.02). The curves in the 
Kaplan-Meier plot (Figure 11) separated between week 52 and week 78. Prior to week 52, ACM was slightly 
increased in the canagliflozin group as compared to the placebo arm.

CV composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, hospitalized heart failure, and

The risk of the CV composite endpoint was nominally reduced by canagliflozin (HR=0.74; 95% CI: 0.63, 
0.86; p=0.0001). Among the individual components of this composite endpoint, only hospitalized heart 
failure reached significance (cf. discussion in corresponding section above). The curves in the Kaplan-Meier 
plot separated very early (< 10 weeks). 
Supportive analyses including exploratory efficacy variables 
Composite endpoint of ESKD, renal and CV death 
The combined secondary renal endpoint of ESKD, renal death and CV death was nominally reduced by 
canagliflozin (HR=0.73; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.87) with the Kaplan-Meier curves separating as early as week 52.

Individual components of the renal and cardiovascular composite  
The individual components of the renal and cardiovascular composite are shown in Table 6.  
Table 5: Analysis of the individual components of the renal and cardiovascular composite 
endpoints (ITT analysis set) 
Changes in eGFR over time 
The eGFR data were only analysed with the on-treatment analysis set. This was mainly due to the rebound 
increase of eGFR after canagliflozin discontinuation. In the ITT analysis set, this effect would have resulted 
in increased data variability and reduced precision of the estimates. 
Baseline eGFR (± SD) was similar between treatment groups (Cana: 56.41 ± 18.18 ml/min/1.73 m2; 
placebo: 56.04 ± 18.35 ml/min/1.73 m2).  
When the LS mean change from baseline of eGFR is analysed over time, a pronounced initial decrease of 
eGFR occurs immediately after onset of canagliflozin treatment, resulting in a lower kidney function as 
compared to the placebo group. Only after 52 weeks, the relation inverts and the canagliflozin group shows 
higher eGFR than the placebo group. The LS mean change from baseline in eGFR over time is shown in 
Figure 12.  
The treatment difference in LS mean change from baseline in eGFR over time was numerically the highest in 
the lowest eGFR stratum (Table 7).

eGFR slope (total, acute, chronic) 
The chronic (week 3 to end of treatment) and the total (baseline to end of treatment) eGFR slope both 
favoured canagliflozin. The acute eGFR slope (baseline to week 3 of treatment), however, favoured placebo, 
because eGFR was initially strongly reduced by canagliflozin (see also Figure 12). An overview of the eGFR 
slope analysis is shown in Table 9. acute, chronic and total eGFR slope data (on-treatment analysis

Albuminuria (ACR) remained constant in the placebo group over the entire time of the study. By contrast,

plateaued

Supportive analyses including metabolic parameters: 
Changes in HbA1c 
In the on-treatment analysis set, the mean HbA1c values were comparable at baseline in both treatment 
groups (placebo: 8.27±1.327 %; canagliflozin: 8.26±1.300 %). At the end of the treatment, HbA1c was 
reduced by 0.25 % in the placebo group and by 0.38 % in the canagliflozin group.   
The effect of canagliflozin in comparison to placebo was -0.13% (-0.212; 0.049).

Figure 14 shows that canagliflozin caused an initial strong reduction of HbA1c and remained slightly more 
effective than placebo throughout the study. 
As shown in the following figure,  HbA1c values decreased more in the canagliflozin group than the placebo 
group by Week 13 (the first scheduled assessment), and the canagliflozin group values remained below the 
placebo group values through the end of treatment.

Changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 
In the on-treatment analysis set, the values for FPG were comparable at baseline (canagliflozin: 
9.12 ± 3.547 mmol/L; placebo: 9.02 ± 3.520 mmol/L; mean ± SD).  
At the end of the treatment, FPG was more effectively reduced in the canagliflozin group (LS mean change 
from baseline (±SE): -0.42 ± 0.077 mmol/L) as compared to placebo (LS mean change from baseline 
(±SE): -0.21 ± 0.077). The placebo-subtracted LS mean change from baseline was -0.21 (95% CI: -0.425, 
-0.002) mmol/L.

The development of FPG over time (Attachment GEFOFPG02; Figure 15) shows that there was a continuous 
reduction of FPG throughout the study in the placebo group. By contrast, canagliflozin only reduced FPG 
strongly in the first 26 weeks of the study, but then continuously lost FPR-lowering efficacy until week 139. 
Figure 15: LS mean change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose over time (on treatment 
analysis set) 
Body weight 
In the on-treatment analysis set, the values for body weight were comparable in both treatment groups at 
baseline (canagliflozin: 87.31 ± 20.708 kg; placebo: 86.92 ± 20.653 kg; mean ± SD).  
At the end of the treatment, body weight was more prominently reduced in the canagliflozin group (LS mean 
change from baseline (±SE): -1.75 ± 0.133 kg) as compared to placebo (LS mean of % change from 
baseline (±SE): -0.03 ± 0.133). The placebo-subtracted LS mean of % change from baseline was -1.72 kg 
(95% CI: -2.090, -1.358). 
The development of the percent change from baseline in body weight over time (Figure 16) shows that 
canagliflozin caused the strongest reduction in body weight during the first 26 weeks of treatment. By 
contrast, the body weight remained largely stable throughout the course of the study in the placebo group.

Blood pressure 
In the on-treatment analysis set, the values for SBP and DBP were comparable in both treatment groups at 
baseline (mean ± SD): 
Canagliflozin:   SBP, 139.81 ± 15.607 mmHg;   
DBP, 78.25 ± 9.339 mmHg 
Placebo:  
SBP, 140.20 ± 15.596 mmHg;   
DBP, 78.38 ± 9.379 mmHg 
At the end of the treatment, both SBP and DBP were slightly more reduced in the canagliflozin group as 
compared to placebo (LS mean of % change from baseline ± SE):  
Canagliflozin:  SBP, -2.69 ± 0.348 mmHg; 
DBP, -1.59 ± 0.195 mmHg 
Placebo:  
SBP, +0.12 ± 0.348 mmHg; 
DBP, -0.99 ± 0.195 mmHg 
The difference of LS means compared to placebo (±SE) was for  
SBP: 
-2.81 ± 0.489 mmHg (90% CI: -3.771; -1.853)

DNP: 
-0.60 ± 0.273 mmHg (90% CI: -1.132; -0.060) 
The development of SBP over time shows that most of the canagliflozin effect occurred immediately after 
initiation of therapy and was largely maintained throughout the course of the study. By contrast, placebo 
treatment was virtually ineffective (Figure 17).  
Figure 17: Least Squares Mean Change From Baseline in Systolic Blood Pressure Over Time (on 
treatment analysis set) 
The development of DBP over time also shows an effect of canagliflozin immediately after initiation of 
therapy. However, this effect became weaker during the following weeks, while the effect of placebo 
increased after week 52, resulting in both curves meeting around week 104. After week 104, the curves 
separated (increase of DBP in the placebo arm and decrease of DBP in the canagliflozin arm) (Figure 18).

Fasting plasma lipids 
In the on-treatment analysis set, the baseline values of the placebo and the canagliflozin group were 
comparable with regard to total, LDL and HDL cholesterol as well as triglycerides. 
There were only minor differences in fasting plasma lipids between baseline and end of treatment. The 
effects of canagliflozin in comparison to placebo were negligible (placebo-subtracted LS mean changes from 
baseline):  
Total cholesterol:  
0.09 mmol/L (95% CI: 0.018, 0.167)

Triglycerides:    
0.08 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.006, 0.175) 
The 95% CIs for these comparisons excluded ’0’ for total cholesterol and HDL-C.

Hypothesis 
Canagliflozin reduces the risk of the composite endpoint of ESKD, DoSC, and renal 
or CV death, relative to placebo in subjects with T2DM, stage 2 or 3 chronic kidney 
disease and albuminuria, who were receiving standard of care including a maximum 
tolerated daily dose of an ACEi or ARB. Based on the time from study Day 1 to the 
first occurrence of the primary efficacy endpoint, the objective of the primary 
efficacy analysis was to establish that canagliflozin is superior to placebo in the 
reduction of the rate of occurrence of the primary efficacy composite endpoint. The 
hypothesis of superiority on primary and major secondary efficacy endpoints of 
canagliflozin versus placebo was tested in a prespecified hierarchical order.

Endpoints 
and 
definitions 
Primary 
Composite of 
ESKD, DoSC, 
and renal or CV 
death  
All events were adjudicated in a blinded 
fashion by an endpoint adjudication 
committee (EAC). Event rate was estimated 
based on time to first occurrence of the 
primary composite endpoint.  
Definitions of each component of the 
primary composite endpoint are: 
• 
ESKD: initiation of maintenance 
dialysis for at least 30 days, or renal 
transplantation, or estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 
<15 mL/min/1.73m2 (sustained and 
confirmed by repeat central 
laboratory measure after 30 days).  
•  DoSC: from baseline average 
determination (sustained and 
confirmed by repeat central 
laboratory measure after 30 days).  
•  Renal death: death in subjects who 
reached ESKD, die without initiating 
renal replacement therapy, and no 
other cause of death was 
determined via adjudication.  
•  CV death: death due to myocardial 
infarction (MI), stroke, heart failure, 
sudden death, death during a CV 
procedure or as a result of 
procedure-related complications, or 
death due to other CV causes. For 
analytic purposes, undetermined 
causes of death were considered CV 
deaths. In determining whether a 
death event is CV in nature, the EAC 
took into consideration both the 
proximate and underlying causes.

A total of 4361 (99.1%) of the ITT analysis set was noted to have completed the trial, 
defined as having been followed until a time point between the notification of the 
GTED and the GTED, or until the time of death for subjects who died prior to the GTED.  
15 subjects randomized to CANA and 25 subjects randomized to placebo were noted 
to have not completed the trial for the reasons noted below: 
Lost to follow-up (total 22; 13 placebo and 9 CANA), Withdrawal of consent (total 16; 
11 placebo and 5 CANA), and Closed site (total 2; 1 placebo and 1 CANA). 
All but 6 subjects (2 placebo and 4 CANA) had a final vital status assessment made at 
the end of the trial.    
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The CREDENCE study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 2-arm study 
conducted at multiple sites worldwide that evaluated the effects of canagliflozin relative to placebo on 
progression to doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD and renal or CV death in subjects with T2DM, stage 2 or 
3 DKD and macroalbuminuria.  
The study population consisted of men and women ≥30 years-old with T2DM, HbA1c ≥6.5% to ≤12.0%, 
eGFR ≥30 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2 (as determined using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology 
Collaboration [CKD-EPI] equation), urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) >300 mg/g to ≤5,000 mg/g) 
on a stable maximum tolerated labelled daily dose of ACEi or ARB. 
Patients with a “known medical history or clinical evidence suggesting nondiabetic renal disease” were 
excluded from participation. This is in line with the recommendation by the CHMP (SA 
EMA/CHMP/SAWP/607731/2013), that “the Applicant needs to ensure that only patients with diabetic 
nephropathy are included in the pivotal trial.” In this SA it was referred to criteria given in the KDOQI 2012 
Guideline, which should identify patients who are likely to suffer from parenchymal disease other than

diabetic nephropathy. These criteria comprise absence of diabetic retinopathy, rapidly decreasing GFR, 
rapidly increasing proteinuria, refractory hypertension, signs or symptoms of other systemic disease or 
>30% reduction in GFR within 2-3 months after initiation of an ACE-inhibitor or ARB. It was unclear, how 
meticulously these criteria were worked through at inclusion into CREDENCE. A confirmatory biopsy was not 
required in the study, which is in line with Guideline EMA/CHMP/500825/2016 (“As a general rule, the renal 
biopsy is not required if not used in general practice to set diagnosis in case of pivotal studies, e. g diabetic 
nephropathy”). Therefore, it was not clear, how many patients with non-diabetic kidney disease were 
included in CREDENCE.  
In this context it is worth noting, that patients with CKD and diabetes mellitus can have true DKD (CKD as 
a consequence of diabetes) or a combination of both DKD and non-diabetic kidney disease. In biopsy studies 
a wide variation in prevalence of non-diabetic kidney disease has been shown. Frequencies vary in various 
studies between 5% and 71% (J Assoc Physician India 2001; 49: 415-20; Diabetes Care 2002; 25: 900-5: 
Diabetologica 1999; 14: 1846-9; Clinical Nephrology 2007; 67: 293-297). 
Furthermore, the postulated MoA of cana (enhanced tubulo-glomerular feedback, decrease in glomerular 
hyperfiltration) seems to specifically interfere with the mechanism that leads to renal insufficiency in diabetic 
nephropathy, which is histologically characterized by glomerular sclerosis (e. g. Magee GM et al., 
Diabetologia 2009, 52: 691-697). 
The initially raised MO was resolved with the Applicant`s Response to the first RSI. The target population 
was changed from CKD to DKD. 
Cana was administered in this study in addition to current local SoC (dietary counselling, glycaemic, 
hypertension and lipid management). This included ACEi/ ARB -inhibitor therapy in almost all (99.9%) 
patients for at least four weeks prior to randomisation, with 72% of patients having received the maximum 
labelled ACEi/ ARB dose. The proposed indication reflected that cana was administered in CREDENCE add-on 
SoC. In section 5.1 it is explicitly stated, that SoC comprised therapy with ACEi/ ARBs. A complementary 
MoA of cana and ACEi/ ARBs is considered likely (SGLT2 inhibitors contribute to increased sodium levels 
delivered to the macula densa and lead to secondary autoregulatory vasoconstriction of afferent glomerular 
arteriolae; ACEi/ARBs lead to dilatation of the efferent arteriolae). In order to further elucidate a potential 
additive effect (ACEi/ARBs + Cana) on the study outcome, the Applicant was asked to present results on the 
primary efficacy endpoint and on its components in the subgroup of patients who discontinued ACEi/ ARBs 
before week 104 of the study (about 6% of the study population). These results were consistent with the 
results of the entire study population. 
The study amendments are considered without major impact on the study outcomes, albeit some of the 
changes are considered substantial: with INT-4, the global cap limiting enrolment of subjects with eGFR ≥60 
to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2 to 25 % was removed. A ratio of 60%:40% with regard to CKD stage 3 (eGFR ≥30 
to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) vs. CKD Stage 2 (eGFR ≥60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2) was allowed. As such, a 
higher proportion of patients with mild renal impairment were allowed to enter the study after the 
amendment. With amendment 5, the necessity of two baseline creatinine values was emphasized. 
Evaluation of serum creatinine from a baseline average is appreciated taking into account the high variability 
(due to analytical and biological reasons) associated with creatinine measurements. An OC relating to the 
substantiation of the validity of baseline creatinine measurements had been resolved with the Applicant`s 
response to the first RSI. 
The canagliflozin 100 mg dose was chosen based on the B/R assessment in subjects with moderate renal 
impairment who participated in the canagliflozin phase 3 program, which showed similar efficacy in terms of 
reductions in urinary ACR for the 100 mg and 300 mg canagliflozin doses, but a safety profile favouring the 
100 mg dose (dose-dependency of e. g. volume depletion and hyperkaliaemia). No dose titration was 
allowed in CREDENCE. Selection of the 100 mg dose for treatment of patients with DN is considered 
adequate.

The primary endpoint was the composite of the time to first occurrence of doubling of serum creatinine, 
ESKD, and renal or cardiovascular (CV) death. Secondary endpoints in the pre-specified hierarchical 
hypothesis testing sequence were the composite of CV death and hospitalized heart failure; the composite of 
CV death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke (MACE); hospitalized heart failure; renal composite of ESKD, 
doubling of serum creatinine, and renal death; CV death; all-cause death; and the CV composite of CV 
death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, hospitalized heart failure, and hospitalized unstable angina. As 
exploratory endpoints a. o. eGFR slope, treatment effects on HbA1c, and blood pressure were captured. 
The primary composite endpoint comprises surrogate endpoints reflecting renal function as well as 
components reflecting renal and cardiovascular outcome which is considered adequate. The primary 
endpoint does not include all-cause mortality, in contrast to the recommendation in the scientific advice 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/607731/2013). However, the primary endpoint contains cardiovascular death (which is 
likely to account for the vast majority of non-renal lethal cases) and also covers “death of unknown cause”. 
Investigation of all-cause mortality as a secondary endpoint is therefore acceptable. Likewise, the secondary 
endpoints are acceptable. CV secondary endpoints defined for CREDENCE are consistent with those defined 
in the EMA guideline on the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/311890/2007; 25 September 2008). All renal and CV events were adjudicated by an 
independent EAC that was blinded to treatment assignment. 
There was uncertainty with respect to the validation of eGFR measurement. To this end, the Applicant was 
asked to clarify, whether mGFR was determined in a pre-specified subset of patients as a confirmatory test 
of eGFR as recommended in Guideline EMA/CHMP/SAWP/607731/2013. Moreover, it was unclear, which 
assay method was used to determine creatinine concentrations and if the methodology of creatinine 
measurement was consistent and comparable across all participating study centres. This is specifically 
important, as the frequently used Jaffe method tends to overestimate creatinine in the presence of high 
glucose concentrations (e.g. den Elzen WPJ et al., Clin Chem Lab Med 2018, 56:e185-e187 or Weykamp C 
et al., Clin Chem Lab Med 2015, 53:e347-e349). It was noted that three subjects (0.1%) in both treatment 
arms discontinued study treatment due to site closure. The MAH was asked to clarify the reasons for closing 
a site during the study. All these uncertainties were sufficiently addressed in the Applicant`s Response to the 
first RSI and the respective OCs were resolved. 
A total of 4401 subjects were randomised, with 2199 and 2202 subjects assigned to placebo and 
canagliflozin, respectively. Randomization was balanced by using permuted blocks with stratification by 
screening eGFR (≥30 to <45, ≥45 to <60, ≥60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2), which is endorsed. The rate 
(29.9% of patients in the placebo group and 24.7% of patients in the Cana group) and nature of 
discontinuations (adverse events and personal reasons most common in both treatment groups) do not give 
rise to concern. The high proportion of patients who completed the study (99.1% of patients were followed 
on or off study drug until death or final visit) supports the robustness of study results. 
Subjects were expected to be followed for approximately 4.5 years on average. An interim analysis was 
planned when the mean duration of follow-up was at least 2 years and approximately 405 subjects had 
experienced an adjudicated primary composite endpoint, as confirmed by the Endpoint Adjudication 
Committee (EAC). An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) was to review the results of the 
planned interim analysis and make a recommendation whether the study should be continued as planned or 
terminated prematurely due to efficacy, futility, or safety reasons. The interim analysis was conducted as 
planned, when the efficacy objectives of the study were met, on 09 July 2018, with 413 subjects having 
experienced a primary composite endpoint, as confirmed by the EAC. A total of 585 primary composite 
endpoints were accrued through the end of the GTED on 30 October 2018. The statistical methodology of the 
study is considered acceptable.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
No significant imbalances in baseline demographic, anthropometric, diabetes, renal status and CV history 
characteristics were apparent between the cana and the placebo group. 
Canagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint compared to placebo by 30% 
(HR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.82, p-value <0.0001). Consistent results were obtained for the individual 
components of the primary composite endpoint, with the renal endpoints doubling of serum creatinine and 
progression to ESKD contributing most to the overall beneficial effect. Importantly, the primary efficacy 
result also remained robust (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.62, 0.84; p<0.0001) in a sensitivity analysis of the primary 
endpoint using all-cause mortality rather than CV death and renal death. Therefore, the concern raised in the 
SA, that the result on the primary endpoint could be biased by non-cardiovascular/non-renal mortality could 
be alleviated. 
Subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint showed homogenous effects of canagliflozin with no significant 
interaction (p<0.1) across various subgroup strata (all point estimates for all HR less than 1.0). Efficacy of 
canagliflozin was somewhat weaker in subjects from North America and Europe as compared to 
Central/South America and the “Rest of the world”. An assessment was undertaken by the Applicant to 
evaluate whether differences in baseline characteristics by region may have contributed to this observation. 
Notably, Europe contributed the highest proportion of subjects over the age of 65 years (56.7% versus 
46.7% overall) and the largest proportion of subjects with baseline HbA1c <8% (52.8% versus 46.7% 
overall), and each of these subgroups had a numerically smaller treatment effect relative to the overall 
population. Therefore, it is possible that these baseline imbalances may have contributed to the numerically 
smaller risk reduction observed for the subgroup of European subjects. Albeit this is considered a plausible 
explanation, given the non-randomised nature of the subgroup analyses, this may also be a chance finding. 
With respect to BL eGFR, the most pronounced effect in favour of cana was observed in the CKD stage 3a 
population (HR: 0.59; 95% CI 0.43, 0.82). Slightly weaker, but consistent effects were observed for stage 
3b CKD (HR: 0.71; 95% CI 0.56, 0.89). The weakest effect, with the CI including unity, was observed for 
stage 2 CKD (HR: 0.81; 95% CI 0.58, 1.13). As, according to the present labelling, canagliflozin treatment 
should be terminated in patients with T2DM and an eGFR of <45 mL/min/1.73m2 due to limited 
antihyperglycemic efficacy (SmPC section 4.2) the renal risk reduction of approximately 29% with cana 
among the subgroup of subjects with a baseline eGFR of <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 is notable. Thus, patients with 
CKD stage 3b represent a population distinct from the one already covered by the existing indication. 
Reassuringly, results in the CANVAS program in subjects who were at high risk of cardiovascular disease or 
had CV disease (integrated analysis of studies DIA3008 and DIA3004) were consistent with the findings for 
the corresponding eGFR strata in CREDENCE: in subjects with eGFR of 45 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 [n=1,485] 
the HR for the renal composite endpoint of doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD, renal death, and CV death 
was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.62, 1.33) and in subjects with eGFR 30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 [n=526] the HR was 
0.92 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.56). The wide confidence intervals indicated that a population at lower risk for 
progression to end stage renal disease was included in the CANVAS program and therefore, the number of 
events turned out to be smaller. 
A history of heart failure led to a considerably smaller effect of canagliflozin on the primary composite 
endpoint. Patients with a history of heart failure were at greater risk of experiencing a primary endpoint 
event (HR 0.89, 95%CI 0.51-1.31) as compared to those without (HR 0.66, CI 0.55-0.79. However no firm 
conclusion could be drawn due to the non-randomised nature of these subgroups. 
Canagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of the following secondary endpoints compared to placebo: 
composite endpoint of CV death and hospitalized heart failure by 31% (95% CI: 0.57, 0.83; p=0.0001), 
MACE (comprised of nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke and CV death) by 20% (95% CI: 0.67, 0.95; p=0.0121), 
hospitalized heart failure by 39% (95% CI: 0.47, 0.80; p=0.0003), renal composite endpoint (comprised of 
Assessment report  
EMA/306073/2020 
Page 61/94 
 
 
  
  
doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD, and renal death) by 34% (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.81; p<0.0001). 
All-cause mortality was reduced by 17% (95% CI 0.68-1.02). With the exception of renal death (7 events) 
there were a substantial number of events in the renal composite endpoint, including 281 ESKD events (116 
in the cana group and 165 in the placebo group). 
HbA1c reductions from BL were rather small, both in the cana group (mean change from BL -0.38%) and in 
the placebo group (mean change from BL -0.25%), with a difference between cana and placebo of -0.13% 
at end of study. Initially, differences in HbA1c reductions from BL were somewhat larger in the cana group 
than in the placebo group (difference -0.23 to -0.38% at week 13 across subgroups) but diminished over 
time. These small differences in HbA1c reduction over time alone are unlikely to explain the renoprotective 
effect of canagliflozin. This finding was consistent across eGFR strata: the additional HbA1c reduction by 
canagliflozin was <0.3 % across all eGFR strata. The absence of a clinically relevant difference in 
antihyperglycemic efficacy between cana and placebo in this study supports the notion that mechanisms 
independent of blood glucose lowering also played a role in reducing the risk for the renal and CV outcomes.  
At baseline, blood pressure targets recommended for hypertensive patients with CKD were not entirely met 
for SBP (BL mean SBP 140.0 mmHg, BL mean DBP 78.3 mmHg). According to the ESC Guideline, in patients 
with CKD, BP should be lowered to <140/90 mmHg and towards 130/80 mmHg (2018 ESC/ESH Guidelines 
for the management of arterial hypertension, European Heart Journal, Volume 39, Issue 33, 2018). As 
expected, blood pressure was reduced with Cana post-baseline. The observed difference to placebo in the 
reduction of SBP and DBP (-2.81mmHg and -0.60mmHg at end of study, respectively) may have contributed 
to the difference in results on the primary outcome parameters.  
Minor differences (1-2 kg across eGFR subgroups) with respect to body weight were noted, which can be 
explained by nutrient loss (glucosuria) and the diuretic effect of canagliflozin. 
Analysis of eGFR change over time and from baseline to end of treatment measures as well as analysis of 
eGFR slope confirmed efficacy of canagliflozin in slowing the progression of diabetic kidney disease. The 
greatest numeric benefit was seen in the lowest BL eGFR stratum (treatment difference in LS mean change 
of 6.32 ml/min/1.73m2, for comparison: CKD stage 3a-4.47 ml/min/1.73m2, CKD stage 2 -3.77 ml/ 
min/1.73m2). As expected, canagliflozin caused an initial and transient reduction of eGFR below the levels of 
the placebo control during the first 52 weeks of treatment, while in the placebo group a progressive linear 
decline in eGFR was noted. 
The difference in the outcome with regards to renal events between the CREDENCE study and the CANVAS 
program raised concerns with regards to the generalisability of the findings. In order to allow proper 
assessment and comparison of the data to the outcome in the CREDENCE study, the MAH was asked to 
provide information on baseline demographics and disease characteristics, including eGFR and albuminuria, 
for the subgroups with CKD3a and 3b in the CANVAS program. The assessment of the Response (analyses 
of data from CANVAS) led to the conclusion that findings could be generalised to the entire DKD spectrum. 
Additional analysis 
Additional analyses were performed to assess the impact of adjusting for postbaseline measurements of 
HbA1c and SBP on the primary efficacy analysis. A series of proportional hazard regression models which 
included postbaseline HbA1c and systolic blood pressure measurements as time-varying covariates were fit. 
Because changes in HbA1c have a delayed effect on cardiovascular risk, several models were constructed. In 
each model, HbA1c was evaluated first using the single coincident value, a single lagged value, and then as 
a running mean average value. Single coincident systolic blood pressure measurements were used for all 
analyses. These analyses showed that the primary endpoint results remained robust regardless of the 
approach for adjusting for time-varying HbA1c and SPB measurements.

2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
CREDENCE was a well-designed and well-conducted study. Efficacy of Canagliflozin in the treatment of 
patients with chronic kidney disease was clearly demonstrated. A robust reduction in the risk of renal and CV 
events has been shown when Cana was added to SoC across all eGFR strata. Notably, the treatment effect 
on the primary endpoint seems to be also exhibited by mechanisms unrelated to blood glucose lowering. 
Most likely, a combination of antihyperglycaemic, blood pressure and bodyweight lowering effects together 
with secondary autoregulatory vasoconstriction of afferent glomerular arteriolae (through increased local 
Angiotensin II) seems to contribute to the observed nephroprotective effect. 
The current label (section 4.2 of the SmPC) limits the use of Cana, with the recommendation not to initiate 
the drug with eGFR < 60 and to stop treatment with eGFR < 45 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2, as the 
anti-hyperglycaemic efficacy in patients with advanced CKD proved to be insufficient in the phase 3 studies. 
Therefore, at minimum the subpopulation with CKD stage 3b, would constitute a distinct population not 
covered by the existing posology.  
Nevertheless, it considered that both the aim of treatment as well as the target population of the newly 
proposed indication (treatment of stage 2 or 3 diabetic kidney disease in adults with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus) is already covered by the approved indication (treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled 
type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise). Therefore, the separate indication for T2DM 
patients with DKD is refused. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of canagliflozin is known from previous studies. However, little information exists on safety 
of cana in patients with higher stages of renal impairment. Thus, in the CREDENCE study a focus of the 
safety evaluation was the AE profile in different strata of CKD severity (Stage 2, Stage 3a and Stage 3B). 
Given the highly differentiated patient population enrolled in the CREDENCE study, most safety data from 
the CREDENCE study was not pooled with the other completed studies to avoid potential dilution of 
differences in incidence rates in a population enriched for renal disease. Similar to what was done previously 
with the CANVAS Program data, this SCS presents a pooled analysis of all 15 Phase 3 and Phase 4 studies, 
including CREDENCE, for the low-frequency adverse events of pancreatitis and photosensitivity (DS8). This 
pooling provides the broadest possible dataset for assessment of these low-frequency adverse events, and 
renal function was not known to change the risk for pancreatitis or photosensitivity. Although, previously the 
evaluations of DKA and lactic acidosis had been included as pooled analyses in prior Risk Management Plans 
(RMPs) and the Integrated Summary of Safety (ISS) for the CANVAS Program, due to the differences in risk 
for acidosis with renal function, neither DKA nor lactic acidosis was included in a pooled assessment that 
included CREDENCE data; DKA is presented with prior analyses based on the CANVAS/CANVAS-R and 
Non-CANVAS/Non- CREDENCE datasets and lactic acidosis with the prior analysis from DS6M (Pooled Phase 
3 and Phase 4 Studies except CREDENCE – Metformin Dataset). 
Patient exposure 
CREDENCE Study: 
The total exposure of subjects to study drug was 9,658.4 subject-years, with 4,915.8 and 4,742.6 
subject-years in the canagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively. The mean duration of exposure to study

Dataset 8 (DS8; all phase 3 and phase 4 studies): 
In order to obtain more reliable information on rare adverse events of interest (particularly pancreatitis and

received cana in this pool; around 40% of them were exposed for two years or more. Total exposure in the 
cana group was 27874 patient-years. In the comparator group (all comparators pooled), 9367 patients were 
included with a total exposure of 18332 patient-years. Further details are provided in the following table.

Adverse events  
Safety evaluation of CREDENCE is based on 4,397 subjects who received at least 1 dose of double-blind 
study drug and were included in the On-treatment analysis set and the On-study analysis set. The distinction 
between these 2 analysis sets relates to the observation period, see Table below.

Overview of AEs  
The incidence rate of any adverse events was lower in subjects receiving cana than placebo. Accordingly, the 
percentage of patients suffering at least one AE or SAE was lower with cana than with plc. The same is true 
for AEs and SAEs leading to discontinuation. Merely in the category “AE related to study drug” a higher 
frequency was observed with cana compared to plc. This could be related to the fact that many typical AEs 
for SGLT2 inhibitors are known so that relatedness is easily to derive. For further details, see table below.

AE frequency by renal function 
The MAH also provided an AE analysis according to renal function (at the time of screening) to exclude 
decreasing tolerability of cana with decreasing renal function. It turned out that the incidence (per 1000 
subject-years) was higher in patients with lower renal function. However, in none of the different CKD stages 
(2, 3A and 3B) AE or SAE incidence was higher with cana than with plc. Incidence of SAEs was similar 
between cana and plc in patients with better renal function (CKD Stage 2). Notably, in CKD Stages 3A and 
3B, SAE incidence was considerably lower with cana compared to plc. For further details, see the following

Note: Incidence is based on the number of subjects experiencing at least one adverse event, not the number of

Note: Denominators are restricted to the respective gender for testicular cell cancer and breast cancer, and male

Note: For adverse events of interest, analysis by screening eGFR strata was limited to the events shown in this 
table as per the CREDENCE SAP. 
Note: For amputation and fracture, incidence rates per 1,000 subject-years are calculated from Day1 to the first 
event date. For other adverse events of interest, incidence rates per 1,000 subject-years are either 
calculated using the total of each subject’s exposure of study medication plus 30 days (on-treatment 
analysis set) or the total follow-up time (for on-study analysis set). 
AEs by organ system 
In line with the overall reduced AE incidence with cana compared to plc, AEs in the individual organ systems 
were also similar or fewer with cana than with plc. The most salient difference, “Investigations”, 20.5% vs 
15.6% (plc vs. cana), was driven by a higher incidence of “Blood creatinine increased” in the plc group; this 
is in line with the efficacy findings. For details see table below.

An overview of the AEs of special interest (AEIs) is provided in the table below. AEIs were selected based on 
prior observation of side effects related to cana (or SGT2 inhibitor in general). Particularly in case of the 
malignancies it is not yet clear whether they are related to cana because an association between treatment 
and neoplasm is difficult to derive from clinical trials. Therefore, data on malignancies are further collected. 
Salient differences, disfavouring cana, are highlighted in the table (done by the rapporteur).  
Reassuringly, VTE, an important sequel of dehydration, was rather infrequent and only increased to a small 
amount by cana (4.14 vs. 3.26 events per 100 patient-years, cana vs. plc). Also lower-limb amputations 
were increased by cana by a small degree only. Notably, during course of the study, preventive measures 
came into force, no longer allowing inclusion of patients with a history of amputation or other signs of 
diabetic foot. It is understood that patients at risk included before this amendment remained in the study.

The most important AEIs are discussed in more detail in the following. 
Hypoglycaemia 
No relevant differences in the incidence of any hypoglycaemia, severe or documented hypoglycaemia were 
observed between cana- and plc-treated patients (see table below). The event rate of documented 
hypoglycaemia was numerically lower for cana than for plc.

The MAH also pointed out that hypoglycaemia events became less frequent during the course of the 
CREDENCE Study, particularly after Year 2. This is depicted in the figure below. This lower hypoglycaemia 
rate was not accompanied by an unfavourable increase in HbA1c or fasting blood glucose (see efficacy 
section).

28431754-DNE3001: On-Treatment Analysis Set) 
DKA 
Diabetic ketoacidosis and possible ketone-related adverse events were identified by the sponsor using a 
prespecified list of MedDRA terms and adjudicated by an independent adjudication committee. Although the 
term “hyperglycemia” was not included in the list of prespecified terms, 1 event of “hyperglycemia” was 
submitted for adjudication. Prior to the decision to form an external DKA adjudication committee, this case 
had been reviewed by an internal DKA committee and determined to be a DKA event. This case was also 
reviewed by the DKA adjudication committee and adjudicated as a DKA event. 
For adverse events that were not serious, only those presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of DKA 
and/or those that required medical intervention (as captured on the DKA eCRF) were to be adjudicated. This 
approach was aimed at eliminating the need to adjudicate incidental findings of limited clinical relevance 
(e.g., presence of urine ketones or low bicarbonate levels in the absence of symptoms and/or treatment). 
For cases adjudicated as events of DKA, the adjudication committee was also required to adjudicate for the 
presence of precipitating factors, severity (based on clinical and biochemical parameters), evidence of 
autoimmune diabetes (based on availability of auto-antibodies results), blood glucose level at the time of 
diagnosis, and whether the event was a primary event or secondary event (i.e., leading to hospitalization or 
occurring in the context of other condition for which subject was already hospitalized). 
Of the 52 cases submitted for adjudication, 13 (25.0%) were adjudicated as DKA events (either confirmed, 
probable, or possible). Of the 13 cases adjudicated as DKA events, 12 were reported as adverse events of 
DKA in 11 subjects in the cana group, and 1 was reported as hyperglycaemia in the placebo group. The event 
rate was markedly higher in the cana than in the plc group: 2.17 per 1000 subject-years in the cana group 
vs. 0.2/1000 subj-y in the plc group. For further details, see table below.

Severity: In the 11 cana patients suffering DKA, 12 events occurred. Of these, 3 were considered mild, 4 
moderate and 5 severe. The case in the placebo group was considered moderate. 
According to the MAH, in ten of the twelve events in the cana group, precipitating factors for DKA were 
present. Among others, as precipitating factors were counted: Recent reduction in insulin dose, drugs 
affecting carbohydrate metabolism, reduction in caloric/carbohydrate intake, recent alcohol consumption, 
dehydration. 
DKA and renal function: Of the eleven subjects in the cana group suffering DKA, six had Stage 3B CKD (eGFR 
30 to <45), three had Stage 3A (eGFR 45 to <60) and two had Stage 2 (eGFR 60 to <90). In total, 655 
subjects in the cana group had Stage 3B CKD, 640 patients had Stage 3A and 905 patients Stage 2. Thus, 
DKA risk increased with decreasing renal function, from 2/905 (0.2%) in Stage 2 via 3/640 (0.5%) in Stage 
3A to 6/655 (0.9%) in Stage 3B. The case in the placebo group had CKD Stage 3B. 
Lower-limb amputation  
Following CREDENCE protocol Amendment INT-5 (06 May 2016), lower-extremity amputation was 
designated as an adverse event of interest and a Lower-extremity Amputation eCRF form was employed to 
systematically capture details relating to the amputation procedure. Prior to the introduction of the 
dedicated eCRF page, events of amputation were recorded by the investigators within the Diagnostic and 
Therapeutic Procedures eCRFs. 
CREDENCE protocol Amendment INT-5 also added a criterion to exclude subjects with a history of 
atraumatic amputation within 12 months of screening, or an active skin ulcer, osteomyelitis, gangrene, or 
critical ischemia of the lower extremity within 6 months of screening. No subjects were recorded to have 
been excluded due to this criterion. Protocol Amendment INT-5 instructed sites to interrupt study drug for 
subjects who developed conditions that may be associated with amputation (e.g., lower-extremity infection, 
skin ulcer, osteomyelitis, gangrene, or critical limb ischemia), until the condition had resolved based upon 
the investigator assessment. Following the release of the amendment, a total of 130 (3.0%) subjects were 
noted to have prematurely discontinued study drug resulting from an adverse event of the lower-extremity 
or personal choice relating to the risk of lower-extremity amputation. These discontinuations were balanced 
between treatment groups (65 patients in the cana and 65 patients in the plc group). In the event of an 
Assessment report

amputation, restarting study drug was only to be done after careful consideration of the individual 
risk-benefit and following discussion with the sponsor. 
Approximately 70% of subjects had been randomized at the time when protocol Amendment INT-5 was 
issued (May 2016). While the majority of subjects had been randomized at this time, less than 20% of total 
follow-up time was before the amendment. It is unclear what impact, if any, the amendment had on the risk 
of amputation as the number of subjects experiencing their first event was generally comparable between 
treatment groups before and after May 2016. Specifically, there were 16 and 12 subjects in the placebo 
group and cana group, respectively, who experienced an amputation prior to when the amendment was 
issued as compared to 47 and 58 subjects who experienced an amputation after the amendment was issued, 
in the same respective groups. 
The following table lists the amputation events in CREDENCE and their localisation. The total amputation 
rate was slightly higher in the cana compared to the plc group (12.14 vs. 11.02 events per 100 
subject-years). Reassuringly, the rate of major amputations (ankle or above) was lower with can than with 
plc (3.82 vs. 4.90, cana vs. plc).

As shown in the following table, the incidence of lower extremity events (beside amputation) was slightly 
higher in the cana than in the plc group (55.5 vs. 51.6 events per 100 pat-years, cana vs. plc). This 
difference was mainly driven by the term “diabetic foot”.

The imbalance in diabetic foot AE obviously was not caused by an imbalance of this condition at baseline as 
shown in the following table. “Peripheral Diabetic Neuropathy” was well balanced between the treatment 
groups at baseline, 40.7 vs. 40.4% (plc vs. cana).

Fracture 
In the initial MAA of cana a higher rate of fractures was observed with cana vs. comparators. It was not clear 
whether this observation was due to increased number of falls due to cana-related dehydration / syncope or 
whether cana can affect bone mineral density via effects on calcium metabolism (which would become more 
pronounced after longer treatment). In the CREDENCE Study (see table below), no major difference in 
fracture rate between the cana and the plc group was observed.

Breast cancer 
Imbalances in the incidence of certain malignancies were observed in some clinical trials or were suspected 
based on the mode of action. In the CREDENCE trial, cases of breast cancer were rather frequent, and there 
was a numerical imbalance between the cana and the plc group: 
Eight women in the canagliflozin group and 3 women in the placebo group experienced adverse events of 
breast cancer. The incidence rate of any adverse event of breast cancer was 4.08 and 1.59 per 1,000 
subject-years in the canagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively. 
Three of the adverse events (all in subjects in the canagliflozin group) occurred within the first 6 months 
after study drug initiation. 
The incidence rate excluding subjects with events in the first 6 months after study drug initiation was 3.16 
and 1.96 per 1,000 subject-years in the canagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively.

Male GMI 
Mycotic genital infection, also in males, is a known side effect of SGLT2 inhibitors. For the CREDENCE study, 
in the On-treatment analysis set among male subjects, a higher incidence of mycotic genital infection 
adverse events was reported in the canagliflozin group than in the placebo group. The incidence rates were 
8.41 and 0.92 per 1,000 subject-years in the canagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively. No event was 
considered serious; most were considered related to study drug by the investigator (even in the plc group), 
and around one sixth led to discontinuation. For further details, see table below. 
For comparison, in the CANVAS/CANVAS-R pooled dataset, the adjusted-incidence rates of any male 
mycotic genital infection were 31.74 and 9.62 per 1,000 subject-years in the combined canagliflozin and 
placebo groups, respectively.

The incidence of female mycotic genital infection was around twice in the cana group compared to the plc 
group (12.60 vs. 6.14 events per 1000 subject-years, see table below). No events were considered serious 
and only a small fraction led to discontinuation. However, many events were considered related to the study 
drug, also in the plc group. This may be due to the fact that mycotic genital infection is a known side effect 
of SGLT2 inhibitors so that a relationship was suspected by the investigators. 
For comparison, in the CANVAS INT-6 dataset, the adjusted-incidence rate of any female mycotic genital 
infection adverse event was 68.85 per 1,000 subject-years in the cana group and 17.52 per 1,000 
subject-years in the plc group.

VTE 
Dehydration is a known side effect of SGLT2 inhibitors. Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTEs) are rare but 
serious consequences of dehydration. Therefore, VTE was specifically addressed in large studies such as 
CREDENCE. 
VTEs were numerically more frequent with cana than with plc (4.14 vs. 3.26 events per 1000 subj-years, 
cana vs. plc) in CREDENCE. No imbalance was observed in VTE regarded serious. VTE most often did not lead 
to discontinuation of study drug and was not considered related to study drug by the investigator. There was 
an imbalance disfavouring cana in respect to fatal VTEs (3 events vs. 1 event, cana vs. plc). For further 
details, see the following table.

Pancreatitis 
In the CREDENCE trial it turned out that there was a numerical imbalance in the incidence of pancreatitis 
between the cana and the plc group. Due to the low number of cases per study, the MAH also provided a 
pooled analysis of pancreatitis across all phase 3 and phase 4 studies (Data Set [DS] 8). The results are 
tabulated below. The incidence of pancreatitis was small; around 0.1% of the patients had a pancreatitis 
event. There was a numerical imbalance in incidence also in the pooled analysis (0.59 vs. 0.32 events per 
1000 subj-years).

Photosensitivity 
During MAA there were remaining uncertainties whether cana is phototoxic. Therefore, this issue was now 
addressed with the pool of phase 3 and phase 4 studies (Data Set 8 [DS8]), including the CREDENCE study 
and the complete CANVAS programme. As shown in the table below, photosensitivity events were rare but 
were numerically more frequent with cana (incidence rate 0.93 vs. 0.47 events per 1000 subject-years).

Lactic acidosis 
There is a theoretical concern that cana administered to renally insufficient patients could increase the risk 
of metformin-related lactic acidosis. Therefore, in the CREDENCE study, a post hoc review of lactic acidosis 
cases was performed. On-treatment events of lactic acidosis occurred in 7 subjects (4 canagliflozin subjects 
and 3 placebo subjects). Cases of lactic acidosis generally occurred in the presence of a serious adverse 
event of hypovolemia, or respiratory or circulatory compromise. 
In the DS6M dataset (pooled patients receiving metformin from all phase 3 and phase 4 studies except 
CREDENCE), there were 6 events of lactic acidosis (canagliflozin: 3 subjects; placebo: 3 subjects). The 
incidence rates were 0.16 per 1,000 subject-years for cana and 0.27 per 1,000 subject-years for plc. The 
odds ratio was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.09, 5.17). Half of the subjects reported serious events and most events were 
severe. There were 2 fatal events (canagliflozin: 1 subject; placebo: 1 subject) and all other events resolved 
or were resolving. 
In conclusion, there is no hint that cana increases the risk for metformin-related lactic acidosis.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Fatal events were less frequent in the cana than in the plc group of the CREDENCE trial. This is in line with 
the efficacy findings that CV mortality and all-cause mortality were (at least numerically) reduced by cana 
compared to plc. On the other hand, HR for CV death (0.78) was somewhat more favourable than for 
all-cause death (0.83) so that the question remains what were the reasons of death in patients dying from 
non-CV events, i.e. is there a condition which more frequently leads to death in the cana than in the plc 
group. 
Fatal AEs: 
Imbalance disfavouring cana was observed for respiratory disorders (see table below). No specific condition 
underlying this observation could be clearly identified; acute pulmonary oedema and respiratory failure 
appear to play a role. Otherwise the number of events is too small for firm conclusions.

SAEs 
The total number of SAEs was lower in the cana than in the plc group of the CREDENCE study (see section 
“overview of AEs” above). The following table lists SAEs per organ system. In all organ classes SAE incidence 
was similar between cana and plc or was lower in the cana group with the exception of skin / subcutaneous 
tissue. This difference was due to a higher incidence of diabetic foot and skin ulcer in the cana group. Lower 
limb amputation (due to diabetic foot disease) was defined as AE of special interest and is discussed in the 
respective section above. 
Most pronounced differences between cana and plc (cana better) were observed for “Metabolism and 
nutrition disorders” and “Investigations: Blood creatinine increased”. This is in line with the desired effect of 
cana.

Laboratory findings 
Serum chemistry 
In general, changes in serum chemistry values from baseline to end of treatment were small to moderate in 
magnitude and consistent with the known effects of canagliflozin. Generally, the trends for the overall 
population was similar in each of the 3 eGFR strata (30 to <45, 45 to <60 and 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2, 
respectively). 
Blood urea nitrogen increased in both treatment groups from baseline to end of treatment. The difference 
between cana and plc was small. 
Creatinine was balanced across treatment groups at baseline. Subjects in both treatment groups 
demonstrated an increase in creatinine from baseline to end of treatment (30.54 and 38.81 μmol/L for the 
cana and placebo groups, respectively). The difference in LS means was -8.27 μmol/L; see also efficacy 
section 
Urate was balanced across treatment groups at baseline. Subjects in the cana group demonstrated a mean 
decrease (-5.21 µmol/L) from baseline to end of treatment in serum urate while subjects in the placebo 
group demonstrated a mean increase (6.84 μmol/L) from baseline to end of treatment. The difference in LS 
means was -12.05 μmol/L. Change from baseline to end of treatment in urate varied by eGFR strata, with 
larger between-group differences observed with increasing baseline eGFR (-4.14, -10.92 and -18.65 µmol/L 
in the eGFR 30 to <45, 45 to <60 and 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2 stratum, respectively). 
Magnesium: A higher proportion of subjects in the cana group (2.1%) than in the placebo group (0.6%) 
experienced any postbaseline increased values of magnesium (>ULN and >25% increase from baseline). 
There was a steep increase in serum magnesium in the cana group from baseline to Week 13. Thereafter, the 
difference between cana and plc remained essentially constant. 
Otherwise the number of subjects with serum chemistry values (including liver function parameters) outside 
the predefined limits for any postbaseline value was similar for the cana and the plc group. 
Regarding serum cholesterol, no difference in LDL/HDL ratio between cana and plc was observed; see also 
efficacy section. 
Haematology 
There was a sharp increase in haemoglobin and haematocrit immediately after starting of treatment in the 
cana group compared to plc. This is a known effect of SGLT2 inhibitors and most likely reflects dehydration.

Vital signs 
Blood pressure (BP) 
The was a marked decrease in systolic and (less pronounced) diastolic blood pressure immediately after 
commencing treatment in the cana group. Thereafter, the difference between the cana and plc group 
remained relatively constant. This effect was not dependent on renal function. The following figure shows an 
example (systolic BP in patient with eGFR between 30 and <45 mL/min/1.73m2. At Week 13, the difference 
between cana and plc was around -4 mmHg in this eGFR stratum. At the end of treatment, the difference in 
systolic BP was -2.7 mmHg (all patients) and in diastolic BP -1.5 mmHg; see also efficacy section.

Screening eGFR Stratum >=30 to <45 mL/min/1.73m2 
Heart rate 
Heart rate did not differ between the cana and the plc group. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs leading to discontinuation were fairly balanced between the cana and the plc group, 286 pts. (13.0%) 
receiving plc vs.267 pts. (12.1%) receiving cana discontinued due to an AE.  
The most prominent cause for discontinuation due to AE were renal and urinary disorders (43 [2.0%] vs. 42 
[1.9%] patients, plc vs. cana). 
SAEs leading to discontinuation were numerically more frequent in the placebo group: 159 pts. (7.2%) 
receiving plc vs. 134 pts. (6.1%) receiving cana discontinued due to a serious AE. 
The most prominent causes for discontinuation due to SAE were cardiac disorders (35 vs. 15 patients, plc vs. 
cana) and infections/infestations (36 vs. 22 patients [1.6% vs. 1.0%] plc vs. cana).

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of canagliflozin is already known in general from previous clinical trials conducted for 
achieving initial MA, including a cardiovascular outcome trial (CANVAS). The evaluation of the CREDENCE 
trial particularly provided information on the safety profile of cana in patients with higher degrees of renal 
insufficiency. Furthermore, CREDENCE enlarged the data pool of large trials which can provide information 
on rare adverse events. 
The most frequently reported AEs (n>5) for canagliflozin versus placebo were hypoglycaemia (10% vs. 
11%), urinary tract infections (10.0% vs. 9.1%), hypertension (6.8% vs. 9.1%), blood creatinine increased 
(6.5% vs. 9.2%), hyperkalaemia (6.1% vs. 7.2%) and nasopharyngitis (5.9% vs. 6.1%). The total number 
and percentage of patients experiencing at least one adverse event were lower in the canagliflozin than in 
the placebo group (1784 [81.1%] vs. 1860 [84.7%]). Serious AEs were also less frequent with cana. 
The overall high incidence of documented hypoglycaemia (33.1% vs. 34.0% [CANA vs placebo]) is 
expected, given the high rate (94-98% across the eGFR strata) of insulin and sulphonylurea use at baseline. 
The incidence of documented hypoglycaemia increased with decreasing eGFR. The incidence rates of severe 
hypoglycaemia were lower with canagliflozin compared to placebo across all three eGFR strata, and the 
highest incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was seen in subjects with the eGFR 30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 
(3.8% for CANA vs 4.1% for placebo). 
Events of volume depletion were reported more frequently with canagliflozin (6.5%) than with placebo 
(5.2%). The incidence rate for volume depletion adverse events increased with decreasing eGFR. In subjects 
with eGFR ≥30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2, the rate of volume depletion was two times higher in the 
canagliflozin group (11%) compared to the placebo group (5.5%); however, in the subgroups eGFR ≥45 to 
<60 and eGFR ≥60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence of volume depletion was similar in the 
canagliflozin and placebo group. Subjects ≥75 years of age had a higher incidence rate of volume depletion 
(9.8% vs 10.5% for canagliflozin vs placebo) compared with subjects <75 years (6.2% and 4.6% for 
canagliflozin vs placebo). Moreover, use of a loop diuretic at baseline increased the incidence rate of volume 
depletion (8.6% vs 6.5% for canagliflozin vs placebo) compared with no use of a loop diuretic at baseline 
(6.0% vs 4.9% for canagliflozin vs placebo). Overall, the increased incidence of volume depletion in the CKD 
Stage 3B subgroup could be explained by the markedly decreased renal function, advanced age and high 
proportion of known risk factors. Moreover, a greater proportion of subjects with eGFR 30-<45 (33%) used 
loop diuretics at baseline compared to subjects with eGFR 45-<60 (20%) and 60<90 (14%). 
Renal-related events occurred frequently in both groups but less frequent in the canagliflozin group (13%) 
compared with the placebo group (18%). Serious and severe renal-related events were also lower in the 
canagliflozin group versus placebo. The incidence rates of renal-related events were lower with canagliflozin 
relative placebo across all three eGFR strata; the highest incidence of renal-related events was seen in 
subjects with the eGFR ≥30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 stratum group (21% vs 27% for canagliflozin vs 
placebo). In the CREDENCE study, eGFR after study discontinuation was not assessed. In the CANVAS-R 
study, where assessments of eGFR after study drug discontinuation were performed, the eGFR for 
canagliflozin returned towards baseline after discontinuation. This demonstrates that 
canagliflozin-dependent decreases in eGFR were functional in nature and do not indicate renal damage. 
Reassuringly, the total number of AEs and SAEs was lower in the cana than in the plc group. This was most 
pronounced for patients with higher degree of renal insufficiency (CKD Stage 3A and 3B). A possible 
explanation for this observation could be the fact that many AEs were related to kidney function (e.g. 
“Investigations: blood creatinine increased”) or cardiovascular disease. In this respect the AE profile 
reflected the desired beneficial effects of cana. 
However, the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) appears to increase with decreasing renal function. There 
was a markedly increased rate of adjudicated DKA in the cana group compared to the plc group in the whole 
Assessment report  
EMA/306073/2020 
Page 81/94 
 
 
  
  
study population (overall DKA: 2.17 vs. 0.2 cases per 1000 patient years, serious DKA: 0.2 vs. 1.77 cases 
per 1000 patient years, respectively). Still, the incidence was low, and most of the DKA events in the cana 
group occurred in patents with Stage 3B kidney disease. Since the absolute number of events was low, firm 
conclusions are not possible on the relation between CKD stage and DKA. 
Efficacy evaluation revealed that the beneficial effect of cana on all-cause mortality was numerically smaller 
than on cardiovascular mortality. Analysis of fatal AEs suggested that the non-CV causes of death could be 
related to respiratory problems because fatal AEs related to respiration were slightly more frequent with 
cana than with plc. However, due the low number of cases, a chance finding cannot be excluded. Also, there 
is no clear mechanistic rationale for this observation. 
A search for side effects of cana which were not detected previously revealed an imbalance in the incidence 
of pancreatitis, disfavouring cana. The incidence of pancreatitis was low (around 0.1% of patients affected) 
so that this type of AE was investigated in a pooled safety dataset, encompassing all phase 3 and phase 4 
studies. In the large dataset, the incidence rate of pancreatitis was still larger in the pooled cana than in the 
pooled non-cana group (around two-fold), but since the absolute incidence was low, this is not considered to 
relevantly affect the benefit-risk profile of cana. 
Another potential side effect of cana is photosensitisation. Studies performed for the initial MAA did not yield 
unambiguous results. Analysis using the large phase 3 / phase 4 dataset revealed a numerically higher 
incidence of events of photosensitivity with cana vs, non-cana treatments, but the incidence was still low, 
also in the cana group, so that this is not considered a safety concern. No specific measures to avoid sunlight 
exposure were recommended in the clinical studies so that a warning for users does not appear necessary. 
Other potential safety issues of cana not yet fully elucidated include lower limb amputation and bone 
fracture. For the latter, the CREDENCE study revealed no relevant differences between the cana and the plc 
group, and Kaplan-Meier analysis gave no hint that fracture rate increased over time (which would be the 
case when one assumes that cana affects bone mineral density, e.g. via disturbance of calcium 
homeostasis). This is in line with previous evaluations of bone mineral density (BMD). 
In the plc group of the CREDENCE study, 11.2 events of lower limb amputation per 1000 subject-years were 
observed vs. 12.3 events per 1000 subj-y in the cana group. This difference is small compared to the results 
of the CANVAS programme. The rate of major amputations (ankle or above) was not increased. For 
reduction of amputation risk, precautionary measures were introduced during the course of the CREDENCE 
study as Amendment INT-5. Further recruitment of patients at increased risk for amputation was stopped 
after this amendment, but patients at risk who were recruited prior to the amendment remained in the 
study. These patients could have contributed to the observed small increase in amputation rate with cana as 
compared to plc. The MAH intended updating the labelling in the SmPC stating that there was no difference 
in amputation rate between can and plc in this study. However, for better understanding why in CREDENCE 
virtually no increased amputation risk was observed, the SmPC was further amended by mentioning that the 
low or absent cana-related amputation risk in CREDENCE was due to precautionary measures. The study 
findings suggest that the precautionary measures, which are also included in the SmPC, are effective to 
minimize amputation risk. 
Furthermore, AEs related to the lower limb other than amputation such as “diabetic foot” or “skin ulcer” were 
also slightly increased with cana. A more detailed analysis, also considering time-course, later revealed that 
the risk for diabetic foot increased in the first year of treatment only. This could be related to the fact that the 
effects of cana on circulation (dehydration, drop in blood pressure, decrease in eGFR) are most pronounced 
after initiation of therapy and become weaker thereafter, probably because of counter-regulatory 
mechanisms. This transient effect also explains why amputation risk during cana treatment was virtually not 
increased in patients without pre-existing diabetic foot.

The overall incidence of malignancies was balanced between the groups (6.7% vs 6.3% for canagliflozin vs 
placebo). The following malignancies ‘of special interest’ was discussed separately: Breast, bladder, renal 
and colorectal cancer. The incidence of colon cancer was low but imbalanced; 0.5% vs 0.2% for canagliflozin 
vs placebo when excluding events with an onset <180 days.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In patients with higher stages of CKD, the safety profile was in general comparable to the established safety 
profile in patients with better renal function. Incidence of AEs and SAEs was numerically lower in the cana 
compared to the plc group, particularly in patients with higher-stage CKD. This was due to the desired effects 
of cana, i.e. reduced number of AEs related to kidney function and cardiovascular disease. 
Events of volume depletion were reported more frequently with canagliflozin than with placebo. The 
incidence rate increased with decreasing eGFR; the rate of volume depletion was approximately two times 
higher in the canagliflozin group vs placebo in subjects eGFR ≥30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2; however, in the 
subgroups eGFR ≥45 to <60 and eGFR ≥60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2, the incidence of volume depletion was 
similar in the canagliflozin and placebo group.  
The rate of UTI was higher than the rate of genital infections; balanced between treatment groups for UTI 
and imbalanced for genital infections (higher incidence for canagliflozin compared with placebo for both 
female and male genital infections). 
CREDENCE confirmed that cana increases the risk for DKA in patients with Type 2 diabetes several-fold. 
However, the number of events/event rate was still low. The results suggest that the DKA risk increases with 
decreasing renal function; most of the DKA events were regarded serious, also in the placebo group. 
The CREDENCE study also expanded the safety data pool of phase 3 and phase 4 trials so that a new 
evaluation of less frequent but serious AEs such as lower limb amputation can be performed. This will be 
done in a separate procedure. In CREDENCE, the amputation risk was not relevantly increased with cana 
suggesting that the precautionary measures, which are also included in the SmPC, are effective in 
minimising the risk. 
Taken together, except for an increased DKA risk, no specific safety concerns of canagliflozin use in a patient 
population with significantly impaired renal function became obvious.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The initially proposed indication in this type II variation is as follows (in the following the existing and the 
new indication are depicted): 
“Invokana is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus as an 
adjunct to diet and exercise: 
• 
• 
as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications 
in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes. 
Invokana is indicated for the treatment of Stage 2 or 3 chronic kidney disease and albuminuria, as an adjunct 
to standard of care, in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  
For study results with respect to combination therapies, effects on glycaemic control, cardiovascular and renal 
events, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5, and 5.1.” 
With the Response to the first RSI, the Applicant changed the target indication to patients with diabetic 
kidney disease, as this was the target population included in CREDENCE (resolution of the respective MO). 
Hence, the updated new indication reads as follows: 
“Invokana is indicated for the treatment of Stage 2 or 3 diabetic kidney disease and albuminuria, as an adjunct 
to standard of care, in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. “ 
With the Response to the third RSI the Applicant revised the indication as follows: 
“Invokana is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus as an 
adjunct to diet and exercise: 
-as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications 
-in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes  
-in addition to standard of care for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease. 
For study results with respect to combination of therapies, effects on glycaemic control, cardiovascular events 
and renal events, and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.” 
All three proposals for modifications of section 4.1 were rejected by CHMP (see section 3.7.3 below) 
Chronic kidney disease is one of the most frequent complications of both T1DM and T2DM. Currently, more 
than 3 million people are estimated to be receiving treatment for kidney failure globally, and this figure is 
predicted to increase to over 5 million by 2035 (Liyanage T et al., Lancet 2015; 385:1975-1982). It was 
estimated that approximately half of all patients with T2DM and one third of those with T1DM will develop 
CKD over the course of their lifetime (Koye DN et al., Chronic Kidney Dis 2018; 25(2): 121-132). People with 
diabetes are more likely to have CKD than those without diabetes, with an overall odds ratio of 2.43 in a 
global kidney disease database (Ene-Iordache et al, Lancet Global health 2016: 4(5): 307-319) 2016). CKD 
Assessment report  
EMA/306073/2020 
Page 87/94 
 
 
  
  
is identified and monitored upon presence and progression of kidney dysfunction (usually by estimated 
glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]<60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and/or kidney damage (usually by albuminuria, 
assessed as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) >30 mg/g). Increased albuminuria and decreased 
eGFR are each independently and additively associated with an increase in all-cause mortality and CV 
mortality. Diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (Tuttle KE et al. Am J Kidney Dis 
2014: 64(4): 510-533). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade, through use of angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) 
drugs, is the only treatment currently approved for preventing the decline of kidney function and 
development of kidney failure in T2DM, based primarily on the results of 2 trials completed over 17 years ago 
(RENAAL study with losartan [Brenner 2001]; IDNT study with irbesartan [Lewis 2001]). 
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) agents, such as ramipril and captopril, have also shown 
benefit in preventing progression of nephropathy (ie, worsening albuminuria) in T2DM and T1DM (HOPE 
2000; Laffel 1995). Despite the recommended widespread use of RAAS inhibition in patients with diminished 
renal function, patients with T2DM and CKD remain at high risk of developing ESKD and CV events. Thus, 
development of novel interventions to protect kidney function and to reduce (CV) mortality in patients with 
DN can be considered an unmet medical need. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
CREDENCE was a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the effects of 
canagliflozin relative to placebo on the primary composite endpoint of doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD, 
renal or CV death in subjects with T2DM, stage 2 or 3 CKD, and albuminuria. This study involved patients 
with T2DM receiving standard of care therapy, including ARBs/ ACEis. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Canagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint compared to placebo by 30% 
(HR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.82, p-value <0.0001). Consistent results were obtained for the individual 
components of the primary composite endpoint, with the renal endpoints doubling of serum creatinine and 
progression to ESKD contributing most to the overall beneficial effect. This favourable treatment effect was 
consistent across numerous subgroups, including those with a screening eGFR ≥30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
The primary efficacy result remained robust (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.62, 0.84; p<0.0001) in a sensitivity 
analysis of the primary endpoint using all-cause mortality rather than CV death and renal death.  
Similarly, treatment with canagliflozin favourably influenced the following secondary endpoints; it 
•  reduced the risk of the composite endpoint of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure (HR: 0.69; 95% 
CI: 0.57, 0.83, p=0.0001); 
•  reduced the risk of the composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, hospitalized heart 
failure, hospitalized unstable angina (HR: 0.74 95% CI: 0.63, 0.86, p = 0.0001) 
•  reduced the risk of MACE (comprised of nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke and CV death, ie, 3 point MACE) (HR: 
0.80; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.95; p=0.0121); 
•  reduced the risk of hospitalized heart failure (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.80; p=0.0003); and 
•  reduced the risk of the renal composite of ESKD, doubling of serum creatinine and renal death (HR: 0.66; 
95% CI: 0.53, 0.81; p<0.0001).

Notably, all components of these endpoints favoured treatment with canagliflozin, including all 
subcomponents of ESKD. 
Analysis of eGFR change over time and from baseline to end of treatment as well as analysis of eGFR slope 
confirmed a favourable effect of canagliflozin (less pronounced decline of eGFR with canagliflozin compared 
to placebo). In addition, canagliflozin reduced albuminuria. 
Modest effects in favour of canagliflozin were shown for SBP and DBP (placebo-subtracted LS mean change 
from baseline to study end was -2.81 mmHg for SBP and -0.60 mmHg for DBP, respectively). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The experience in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min is very limited. Canagliflozin should not be initiated in 
these patients but can be continued until dialysis and renal transplantation in patients already on treatment.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the CREDENCE study, a total of 2,200 subjects were treated with canagliflozin with 1,948 subjects (89%) 
being treated for at least 52 weeks, 942 subjects (43%) for at least 2.5 years and 459 subjects (21%) for at 
least 3 years. Total exposure to canagliflozin amounts to 4,916 PY.  
The general safety profile of canagliflozin is established. The known side effects (e.g. dehydration, mycotic 
genital infection, diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) were also observed in the CREDENCE study. Reassuringly, the 
total number of AEs and SAEs was numerically lower in the cana than in the plc group (81.1% vs. 84.7% of 
patients with at least one AE, cana vs. plc).  
The safety evaluation of the CREDENCE study is relevant for the question whether decreased renal function 
alters the B/R profile of canagliflozin. In patients with higher degrees of CKD (Stage 3A and 3B) the incidence 
of AEs and SAEs was lower with canagliflozin than with placebo (Stage 3A, AEs, 346 vs. 388 events per 1000 
subject-years, cana vs. plc; Stage 3A, SAEs, 141 vs. 177; Stage 3B, AEs, 395 vs. 414; Stage 3B, SAEs, 175 
vs. 205). This was due to a decreasing number of events related to kidney (e.g. “blood creatinine increased”) 
and cardiovascular disease.  
Contrary to this trend, the incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) appeared to increase with decreasing 
renal function (six patients with DKA had Stage 3B CKD, three had Stage 3A and two had Stage 2). The 
absolute number of events was low and no firm conclusions can be drawn. 
In CREDENCE study, initiation of canagliflozin treatment was prohibited by protocol for subjects with eGFR 
<30 mL/min/1.73 m2. However, subjects who developed eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 after initiation of 
treatment were permitted to remain on canagliflozin (or placebo) until dialysis or renal transplantation. The 
cohort of subjects with an eGFR of <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at the last on-treatment measurement (n=929; of 
which 417 subjects treated with canagliflozin) had a higher incidence of AEs and SAEs, including fatal cases, 
compared to the population in the overall on-treatment analysis but the incidence rates of AEs/SAES were 
comparable for canagliflozin and placebo within the eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 population. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In a pooled safety analysis of all phase 3 and phase 4 studies including CREDENCE, pancreatitis and 
photosensitivity were numerically increased in incidence in the pooled canagliflozin group vs. the pooled 
non- canagliflozin group (pancreatitis: 17 (0.13%) in the pooled cana group versus 6 (0.06%) in the pooled 
non-cana group; photosensitivity: 27 (0.20%) in the pooled cana group versus 9 (0.10%) in the pooled 
non-cana group). For both adverse drug reactions the absolute number of cases was low.

Non-traumatic lower limb amputations (due to microvascular disease) were recognised to be more frequent 
in diabetic patients with pre-existing microvascular disease (e.g. identified by previous amputation). In 
CREDENCE, these patients at risk were excluded during the course of the study by an amendment and no 
relevant differences in the number of amputations between canagliflozin and placebo were observed at 
study end (70 (3.2%) in the cana group versus 63 (2.9%) in the placebo group). The AE “diabetic foot” was 
reported more often in the canagliflozin than in the placebo group. 
The risk of lower limb amputations and precautionary measures are appropriately addressed in the SmPC. 
Events of documented hypoglycaemia and events of severe hypoglycaemia for canagliflozin vs placebo and 
across the three eGFR strata had been presented as requested by CHMP and no differences were shown. 
Other concerns which dealt with an increased incidence of events related to volume depletion with 
decreasing GFR and with respect to eGFR changes over time per eGFR stratum could likewise be resolved.

function 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Diabetic kidney disease is a major cause of progressive renal insufficiency. Despite widespread use of ARBs 
or ACEi, patients with diabetic kidney disease remain at high risk of becoming dialysis-dependent and 
experiencing CV events. 
Canagliflozin, on top of an ARB or ACEi, resulted in a statistically significant and clinically relevant 30% 
reduction in the risk of the primary composite endpoint of doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD, and renal or 
CV death compared to placebo in a T2DM population with established CKD (60% of whom had a screening 
eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2), which is an important favourable effect. Consistency across numerous 
subgroups, including that with a screening eGFR ≥30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 was shown. 
The efficacy of canagliflozin on renal outcomes in a CKD population with T2DM was further shown by the 
34% reduction achieved in the risk of the secondary renal composite endpoint (ESKD, doubling of serum 
creatinine, and renal death). Moreover, canagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of the first occurrence of 
progression to ESKD by 32% compared with placebo, with clinically meaningful reductions seen for each 
subcomponent of the ESKD endpoint (~25% for dialysis or renal transplantation; 40% for a sustained eGFR 
<15 mL/min/1.73 m2).  
With respect to secondary cardiovascular outcomes, the point estimates were below one, but statistically 
significant only for hospitalization for heart failure. The results are in line with those seen in CANVAS, which 
was a dedicated CV outcome study.  
With respect to the mechanism leading to renal benefits, it is hypothezised that a combination of 
antihyperglycaemic, blood pressure and bodyweight lowering effects, and, secondary autoregulatory

vasoconstriction of afferent glomerular arteriolae (through increased local Angiotensin II) leading to reduced 
intraglomerular pressure may contribute to the observed relevant nephroprotective effect of canagliflozin. 
The adverse effect profile of SGLT2 inhibitors is well-established including increased risk of DKA, dehydration 
and mycotic genital infections. The most important unfavourable effect observed with canagliflozin in the 
Credence study was an increased risk of DKA, which appeared to increase with decreasing renal function. 
This is indeed a serious adverse event, even if it is acknowledged that the absolute number of events was 
low. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Canagliflozin has demonstrated clinically relevant beneficial effects on renal function in patients with diabetic 
kidney disease. Although an increased risk of water/electrolyte imbalance, DKA and amputations are noted, 
these risks are considered manageable and are, together with precautionary measures, appropriately 
addressed in the SmPC. Therefore, the beneficial effects of canagliflozin are considered to outweigh the 
adverse effects in patients with DKD. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Results from the CREDENCE study are considered robust and clinically relevant.  
Since the already approved indication “treatment of patients with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes” is 
considered to cover both the aim of the treatment, which is not limited to glycaemic control but covers as 
well other treatment goals including the proposed treatment goal of “prevention of worsening of diabetic 
complications” and the target population (patients with DKD are not excluded from the current indication), 
the CHMP considers that a separate indication for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease in section 4.1 of 
the SmPC as was proposed by the MAH is not warranted. Also the later revised proposal from the MAH, to list 
in section 4.1 of the SmPC treatment in addition to SoC for DKD within a third bullet point under the existing 
broad T2DM indication (see section 7.1.1.), was not agreed by CHMP. 
Instead section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated to include treatment recommendations for patients with 
stage 3b diabetic kidney disease which were excluded by the current posology recommendations. The 
updated text includes the recommendation that canagliflozin should be used in addition to, and not instead 
of an ARB or ACEi, which is the current standard of care in patients with DKD. It was also considered 
important to reflect in section 4.2 that the glucose lowering effect of canagliflozin is reduced in patients with 
moderate renal impairment and likely absent in patients with severe renal impairment. However, the revised 
text explains that canagliflozin can be initiated for prevention of worsening of DKD also in the lower 
eGFR-range. 
In addition section 5.1 of the SmPC has been updated to present the results of the CREDENCE study. The 
latter is in line with previous regulatory decisions taken for reflection of results from cardiovascular outcome 
trials  (CVOTs) where the results from new studies performed in the approved target population are 
presented in SmPC section 5.1 and in the EPAR to communicate the new information to the prescriber and 
to other stakeholders.  
In conclusion, the CHMP was of the view that the use of Invokana for the treatment of diabetic kidney 
disease in addition to standard of care is already covered by the existing T2DM indication wording and that 
the results from CREDENCE and important information for prescribers are best reflected in sections 4.2.  4.4, 
4,8 and 5.1 of the SmPC; the clarification that canagliflozin should be used on top of SoC for DKD has been  
adequately provided in the Invokana SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1.  
Assessment report  
EMA/306073/2020 
Page 93/94 
 
 
  
  
The CHMP also accepted a new cross-reference in the last sentence of the Invokana SmPC section 4,1,  
emphasizing that new data is available from the CREDENCE study.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Invokana for treatment of patients with diabetic kidney disease is positive.  
A separate indication or separate indent for treatment of DKD in SmPC 4.1 is not approvable.  The use of 
Invokana in addition to standard of care for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease is covered by the 
current indication “Treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus”. Minor update 
to SmPC 4.1 and addition of relevant information to other SmPC sections (mainly 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1) were 
agreed. 
The overall B/R of Invokana is positive. 
4.  Recommendations

Update of sections 4.1 , 4.2, , 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 6.6 of the Summary of Product Characteristics to modify the 
therapeutic indication for INVOKANA (canagliflozin) based upon new clinical efficacy and safety data from 
the Phase 3 study: Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical 
Evaluation Trial (CREDENCE) (DNE3001). This study provides data on the use of Invokana in addition to 
standard of care in diabetic kidney disease patients. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP 
version 8.5 has also been agreed. In addition, the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet has 
been revised. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
BCC represents the most common non-melanoma skin cancer worldwide affecting mainly adult (age ≥40), 
fair-skinned individuals1,2. BCCs develop predominately in sun-damaged skin and occur with an incidence 
rate of 1,406/100,000 in the United States (US) (1998/99), 3,252/100,000 in Queensland/Australia (1997) 
and 143/100,000 in Germany (2004). Incidence rates are dramatically increasing, e.g. in Denmark from 34 
to 91 /100,000 cases in males and from 27 to 97 /100,000 cases in females between 1978 and 2007, and in 
the Netherlands incidences increased from 40 to 148/100,000 in males and from 34 to 141/100,000 in 
females between 1978 and 20083.  
BCCs are locally invasive tumours, and metastases occur in less than 1 in 10,000 tumours2. Though 70% of 
primary BCC cases occur on the skin of the head or neck, 85% of metastatic cases and 90% of recurrent 
cases occur at these sites. Composed of proliferating keratinocytes from basal cells of the epidermis, BCC 
generally demonstrates a relatively innocuous course, with slow growth and only minimal local extension. 
Accordingly, this disease typically has a favourable prognosis. The WHO distinguishes non-aggressive BCCs 
and aggressive forms according to their fundamentally different biological characteristics as well as their size 
and body localization1,2,4. In these 2 groups, the WHO includes superficial, nodular (solid), micronodular, 
infiltrating, and fibroepithelial BCCs, BCC with adnexal differentiation, and basosquamous and keratotic 
BCCs2. Primary nodular and superficial BCC (sBCC) or mixed sBCC and nodular BCCs (nBCCs) are the 
prototypical varieties of BCC and tend to be less aggressive in general (good to intermediate prognosis)1,5. 
Approximately 10-30% of BBCs are diagnosed as sBCCs, erythematous patches with pearly border with a 
superficial erosion appearing mainly in the trunk area, while nBCCs make up 60-80% of the BCCs and occur 
most frequently on the head as elevated nodules associated with telangiectasia which can become ulcerative 
or cystic. Both types of BCCs have district histopathological features. sBCC consist of superficial lobules of 
basaloid cells confined to the papillary epidermis which project from the epidermis or from the sides of 
follicles or eccrine ducts into the dermis and surrounded by stroma. nBCC appear as large basaloid lobules 
that project deeper than the reticular dermis2. Risk factors which influence the prognosis of BCC include 
tumour size and site, definition of the margins, histological subtype, features of aggression (perivascular 
perineural involvement), failure to other treatment and immunosuppression4. The fibroepithelioma of Pinkus 
consists of usually only one bit occasionally of several raised,  moderately firm, slightly pedunculated 
nodules, covered by smooth, slightly reddened skin. Clinically, they resemble fibromas. The most common 
location is the neck6. The histopathology is characterized by an arborising network of cords of basaloid cells 
that extend downwards from the epidermis and create a fenestrating pattern. There are strands of basaloid 
cells that surround fibrovascular stroma. Ductules may be present in some of the cords, which may 
represent extension of the tumor down pre-existing eccrine ducts. The cords also are associated with small 
follicle-like bulbs that project into the surrounding connective tissue2.

Table 1: 
Classification of BCC subtypes according to prognosis5 
The probability of recurrence after treatment is used to categorise BCC lesion into either low risk or high risk 
of progression. Following treatment, less than a third of recurrences present the first year after follow up, 
50% within 2 years and 66% within 3 years. The cumulative risk is between 33-70% and patients who are 
disease free after 3 years have a low risk of further developing BCC4. 
According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines on treatments for BCC, the main 
objective is achieving maximal preservation of function and cosmetics. European guidelines for the 
management of BCC list a variety of treatment options aiming at eradicating the tumour while ensuring an 
acceptable cosmetic outcome for the patients4,7, 3, 8 . Among therapies recommended for low risk early BCCs, 
these include surgical excision, radiotherapy (low wave X-ray, brachytherapy, high energy radiotherapy) 
and 5-fluorouracil, photodynamic therapy (PDT), particularly for the treatment of large or multiple lesions. 
In several European countries, methyl aminolevulinate (MAL, Metvix) with PDT has been approved for the 
treatment of superficial and/or nodular basal cell carcinoma unsuitable for other available therapies due to 
possible treatment related morbidity and poor cosmetic outcome; such as lesions on the mid-face or ears, 
lesions on severely sun damaged skin, large lesions, or recurrent lesions. 
5-Aminolevulenic acid (BF-200 ALA, Ameluz) was developed as a nanoemulsion-based gel formulation, 
initially for the treatment of actinic keratosis (AK) with PDTc. In the European Union (EU), a Community 
Marketing Authorization was granted for Ameluz in December 2011 for the treatment of mild to moderate 
AKs in the face and scalp (EU/1/11/740/001).  
The MAH applied for the following indication: 
• 
Treatment of non-aggressive basal cell carcinoma (primary superficial or nodular basal cell carcinoma or 
mixed types of both, with good or intermediate prognosis) on the face, scalp, neck, trunk and 
extremities in adults including the elderly. 
The final agreed indication is as follows: 
• 
Treatment of superficial and/or nodular basal cell carcinoma unsuitable for surgical treatment due to 
possible treatment-related morbidity and/or poor cosmetic outcome in adults. 
Posology in adults 
For treatment of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), two sessions of photodynamic therapy shall be administered for 
one or multiple lesions with an interval of about one week between sessions. Basal cell carcinoma lesions 
shall be evaluated three months after last treatment. Treated lesions that have not completely resolved after 
3 months shall be retreated.

Method of administration 
Nodular BCC lesions are often covered by an intact epidermal keratin layer which should be removed. 
Exposed tumour material should be removed gently without any attempt to excise beyond the tumour 
margins. 
The illumination dose remains the same as for actinic keratosis (AK). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No ERA was submitted. The applicant submitted a justification for the absence of an ERA.  
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The lack of non-clinical data is acceptable as the non-clinical aspects have been evaluated previously for the 
initial marketing authorisation. Since the active substance 5-aminolevulinic acid is an amino acid and an 
intermediate in basic biochemical pathways, it is accepted that an environmental risk assessment is deemed 
not necessary. This approach is supported by the guideline on the environmental risk assessment 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2) where it is stated that amino acids are exempted from the requirement 
for a detailed environmental risk assessment as they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the 
environment.  
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The lack of non-clinical data is acceptable as the non-clinical aspects with the product have been assessed 
previously. No further studies are considered necessary. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.1.  Main study 
ALA-BCC-CT008: A randomized, observer blind, multinational phase III study to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of BF-200 ALA (Ameluz) in comparison to Metvix in the treatment of 
non-aggressive basal cell carcinoma (BCC) with photodynamic therapy (PDT) 
Methods 
Study participants 
Main inclusion criteria 
•  Men or women ≥18 years of age (inclusive). 
•  Willing and able to sign the Informed Consent Form. A study-specific informed consent was obtained in 
writing for all patients before starting any study procedures. 
•  Presence of 1 to 3 primary BCC lesions in the face/forehead, bald scalp, extremities and/or neck/trunk, 
all of which were, according to the clinical judgment of the investigator, likely to fulfill the criteria for 
positive outcome of the histological assessment (non-aggressive BCCs comprising primary superficial, 
nodular, or mixed superficial/nodular BCC (sBCC/nBCC) with a thickness ≤2 mm) of BCC by biopsy taken 
at screening were allowed to be included in the study. Lesions assessed as non-eligible by biopsy taken 
at screening were to be excised by surgery or removed by cryotherapy in a timely manner. Other 
treatments were not allowed for these lesions. 
•  The diameter of each eligible lesion was to range between ≥ 0.5 cm and ≤2 cm; the total maximal treated 
area was not be larger than approximately 10 cm² (including a 0.5 – 1.0 cm margin surrounding each 
lesion). 
•  Target BCC lesions were to be discrete and quantifiable: the diameter of each BCC lesion must be not 
smaller than 0.5 cm and not larger than 2.0 cm. To describe irregular lesions (ellipsoidal), investigators 
will measure the major and minor axes. Both axes must be between the minimum of 0.5 cm and the 
maximum of 2.0 cm. The thickness of the BCC according to the histological examination must not be 
more than 2 mm. The lesions must be located within 1–2 treatment areas. Target lesions were to be 
placed within maximal 2 illumination areas (the illumination area was defined by the effective 
illumination area of the BF-RhodoLED (light emitting diode) device with approximately 6 x 16 cm). 
•  Patients displaying non-eligible lesions by biopsy taken at screening were to be included in the study if 
at least one lesion was eligible and the non-eligible lesions were at least 10 cm apart from the eligible 
lesion(s). In such patients, the non-eligible lesions were to be timely removed by surgery or cryotherapy

•  Presence of photodermatoses. 
•  Treatment of lesions (actinic keratosis [AK], BCC, SCC, Bowens disease, melanoma) ≤12 weeks prior to 
first PDT, except physical treatments (e.g. cryosurgery, excision surgery) that were not allowed ≤6 
weeks prior to first PDT (Visit 2). 
•  Presence of inherited or acquired coagulation defect. 
•  Start of intake of medication with hypericin or systemically-acting drugs with phototoxic or photoallergic 
potential within 8 weeks prior to screening. 
•  Clinically relevant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, neurologic, endocrine, or other major systemic disease 
making implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study results difficult. 
•  Evidence of clinically significant (CS), unstable medical conditions, such as: 
o  Metastatic tumor or tumor with high probability of metastatic spread 
o  Cardiovascular disease (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III, IV)

•  Any topical treatment including diclofenac and immunomodulatory agents (e.g. imiquimod, ingenol 
mebutate) 12 weeks prior to the first PDT session and during the observer blind part of the study. 
•  Any physical treatment during the observer blind part of the study within the treated target area(s) with 
the exception of lesion(s) that could not be confirmed to be eligible by biopsy at screening and that were 
located at a distance of ≥10 cm to a suitable lesion. These lesions were to be excised surgically or 
removed by cryotherapy in a timely manner and were not allowed to be treated by PDT in the observer 
blind part of the study. 
Treatments 
For each patient, the study consisted of 2 PDT treatments (PDT-1 and PDT-2) approximately 1 week apart. 
Patients were evaluated 12 weeks after PDT-2 and according to response, the duration of study treatment 
plus observation was as follows: 
•  Complete responders (lesions totally cleared clinically): no further treatment for a total treatment and 
observation duration of 13 weeks. 
•  Partial or non-responders: 2 additional PDTs in a second PDT cycle for a total treatment and observation 
duration of 26 weeks 
Definition of the treatment region 
Non-aggressive BCC located in 1 or 2 separate illumination areas will be treated with PDT in this study. The 
target areas are defined as the whole face (but without H-zone including eg eyes, ears, temporal area, nose, 
and mouth, see Appendix B) and the forehead (Target area A), the bald scalp (Target area B), neck/trunk 
(Target area C) and extremities (Target area D). Only non-aggressive BCC lesions located in these target 
areas will be treated and analysed. 
The overall treatment area (from up to 2 areas out of the Target areas A to D) should contain at least 1 but 
not more than 3 distinct eligible BCC lesions of together maximal approximately 10 cm2 (including 0.5 – 1.0 
cm of surrounding tissue). 
Clinical criteria for diagnosis of non-aggressive BCC 
Patients must have at least 1 but not more than 3 clinically typical, visible, non-aggressive BCC lesions, each 
with a maximal thickness of 2 mm, within 1 to 2 treatment areas of together maximally approximately 10 
cm2 to be eligible for participation in the study in the respective target areas. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
To compare the efficacy of BF-200 ALA (also referred to as Ameluz) containing 7.8% 5 aminolevulinic acid 
(5-ALA) as active ingredient), with the marketed product Metvix, containing 16% methyl-aminolevulinate 
(MAL) as active ingredient in the treatment of thin (≤2 mm thickness), non-aggressive basal cell carcinoma 
(BCC) with photodynamic therapy (PDT). 
Secondary objectives: 
To evaluate the safety and secondary efficacy parameters related to BF-200 ALA or Metvix for treatment of 
thin, non-aggressive BCC with PDT and to evaluate the relationship between lesion complete response and 
lesion thickness at baseline.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy 
Primary efficacy variable: 
The primary efficacy variable is the overall patient complete response rate assessed 12 weeks after the last 
PDT.  
•  An overall complete responder is defined as a patient in whom all treated lesions are cleared after the 
last PDT.  
•  The clearance rate of BCC lesions per patient (determined by clinical evaluation) in the treatment area 
will be measured by comparing the BCC lesion count at baseline with the count at Visit 4, Visit 5, Visit 7, 
and Visit 8 and during FU visits. A BCC lesion is considered “cleared” if it disappears completely, as 
assessed visually, ie there are no typical clinical signs of BCC visible. 
Secondary efficacy variables: 
•  Lesion complete response (completely cleared individual lesions) assessed 12 weeks after the last PDT. 
•  Reduction of total lesion area (summation of sizes of all treated lesions) per patient, assessed 12 weeks 
after the last PDT. 
•  Patient complete response (complete clearance of all treated lesions) assessed 12 weeks after PDT-2. 
•  Overall cosmetic outcome 12 weeks after the last PDT. 
Tertiary efficacy variables: 
•  Lesion complete response (completely cleared individual lesions) assessed 12 weeks after PDT-2. 
•  Reduction of total lesion area (summation of sizes of all treated lesions) per patient, assessed 12 weeks 
after PDT-2. 
•  The change in skin quality assessments compared to baseline assessed 12 weeks after the last PDT. 
•  Patient’s satisfaction 12 weeks of the overall cosmetic outcome after last PDT was to be assessed at the 
end of the observer blind part of the study (12 weeks after PDT-2 [Visit 5] or 12 weeks after PDT-4 (visit 
8) if re-treated [Visit 8]), and at the FU visits using a 5-point scale as follows: 
o  0 = very good 
o  1 = good 
o  2 = satisfactory 
o  3 = unsatisfactory 
o  4 = impaired 
o 
In addition, patients were to be asked at these visits if they would choose this treatment in 
the future (e.g. in case of recurrence). 
Safety: 
•  Exposure: Number of PDT sessions 
•  PDT details (e.g. incubation time of IMP, duration of illumination and percentage of maximal light

reported separately), any local AEs or conditions that may be relevant for proper assessment of the 
recurrence rate of the treated BCC lesions were to be documented, and SAEs that occurred up to 12 
months after the last PDT were also to be documented.

Sample size 
Originally, it was planned to randomize 360 patients with 180 patients in each treatment group. However, 
during the blinded monitoring of the study, a higher overall response was observed requiring fewer patients 
to demonstrate non-inferiority. The sponsor therefore requested a re-assessment be performed and a 
sample size re-estimated leading to a total of 272 patients planned to be randomized: 136 patients in each 
group. 
Randomisation 
The study was randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the 5-aminolevulenic acid group or ethyl-aminolevulinate 
group. 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was performed in an observer blind manner. The study could not be performed in a double blind 
manner because BF-200 ALA has a different consistency than the comparator Metvix. To guarantee the blind 
status of the investigator assessing efficacy and safety at all visits after each PDT cycle, a second 
investigator or delegated person performed the PDT treatment and all safety evaluations at the visits when 
PDT was performed (including the illumination period). 
Statistical methods 
The study was divided in 2 parts: an observer blind part consisting of a screening period (up to 2 weeks) and 
a treatment/observation period (up to 6.5 months), and a follow-up (FU) part (up to 57 months) for a total 
study duration for each patient of approximately 61 to 64 months, depending on patient response to 
treatment. Complete responders (lesions totally cleared clinically) 12 weeks after PDT-2 entered the FU part 
of the study for a total duration of approximately 61 months. Partial or non-responders 12 weeks after PDT-2 
were retreated with the same medication by applying 2 additional PDTs in a second PDT cycle and then 
entered FU (as full responders or as partial or non-responders getting additional treatment according to the 
choice of the investigator) for a total duration of approximately 64 months. The end of this study was 
expected to be approximately in the second half of 2020. 
Analysis sets 
•  Enrolled set: All patients enrolled in this study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/53493/2017 
Page 13/63 
 
  
  
•  Randomized set (RAND): All patients randomized to IMP irrespective of whether they received IMP or 
not. The RAND is the analysis set for the summary of patient discontinuation. 
•  Safety analysis set (SAF): All patients treated at least once with IMP. The assignment of patients to the 
treatment groups will be as actually treated. The SAF is the analysis set for all safety analysis. 
•  Full analysis set (FAS): all patients randomized and treated at least once with the IMP after 
randomization. In accordance with the intent-to-treat principle, the assignment of patients to the 
treatment groups was randomized. 
•  Per-protocol (PP) analysis set: All patients of the FAS without any major protocol deviations. The PP set 
is the primary analysis set for the primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy analysis is defined as the comparison of BF-200 ALA and Metvix with regard to the 
overall patient complete response assessed 12 weeks after the last PDT.  
The primary null hypothesis (H01, one-sided ) is that the overall patient complete responder rate assessed 
12 weeks after the last PDT for patients treated with BF-200 ALA is lower than the corresponding responder 
rate for patients treated with Metvix minus the non-inferiority margin of Δ = 15%: 
H01: rALA < rMetvix - Δ 
where rALA denotes the rate of responders in the BF-200 ALA group, rMetvix denotes the rate of responders 
in the Metvix group, and Δ = 15% the absolute non-inferiority margin. 
The primary alternative hypothesis (H11 , one-sided) is that the overall patient complete responder rate 
assessed 12 weeks after the last PDT for patients treated with BF-200 ALA is not worse than the 
corresponding responder rate for patients treated with Metvix by more than the non-inferiority margin Δ: 
H11: rALA ≥ rMetvix - Δ 
The method of Farrington and Manning for testing non-inferiority of differences of proportions9 will be used 
to test the primary hypothesis on a significance level of 2.5% (0.025, one sided). 
In addition, the corresponding one-sided 97.5% - CIs for the difference in response rates rALA – rMetvix will 
be presented. Rejection of the primary null hypothesis implies that the lower bound of this CI is greater or 
equal - Δ. If the lower bound of this CI is greater than 0, BF-200 ALA will be considered superior to Metvix. 
The primary analysis will be performed on the PP set.

Participant flow 
Recruitment 
The study ALA-BCC-CT008 recruited patients in 24 centres in Germany (20) and UK (4). The recruitment 
period was approximately 4 months, with the planned first patient in: January 2014 and last patient in 
approximately in May 2014. The last patient out (observer blind part) was in November 2014 with an 
expected follow-up until August 2019. 
Conduct of the study 
In total, 50 patients included in the FAS had at least one major protocol deviation and were excluded from 
the PP population. Major protocol deviations are summarized by treatment group and overall in Table 2.

Change to the inclusion criterion regarding primary disease eligibility: 
Previous to this amendment, patients with any lesions biopsied at screening and assessed as non-eligible 
according to biopsy results were not allowed to be included into the study, even if eligible lesions existed (an 
exclusion criterion was “confirmed histopathological diagnosis of other than non-aggressive BCC”). After 
implementation of this amendment, patients with these non-eligible lesions were allowed to be included if at 
least one of the lesions was an eligible BCC. The non-eligible lesions had to be at least 10 cm away from the 
nearest BCC lesion treated within the study and had to be removed surgically. This change was implemented 
to improve recruitment.  
Change to the sample size and number of patients to be included in the study: 
This amendment reduced the sample size from a total of 360 patients to a total of 272 patients because a 
higher overall response than originally anticipated was observed during the blinded monitoring of the study. 
A higher response rate of between 84 and 90% for the FAS and PP sets was observed with a non-inferiority 
margin of 15%, respectively, versus an originally anticipated response rate of 80%.

Table 23:  
Overall complete responder rates by subgroup categories 
Patient distribution in the subgroups was similar for both products and represents the distribution in the 
general population, where more than 70% of BCCs are located in the head/trunk region. BCCs located in this 
region mainly belong to the superficial subtype. In conclusion, even though subgroup sizes are too small to 
draw significant conclusions on individual groups, the distribution of the two products to the relevant 
subgroups is very similar. Thus, it seems not plausible that this could negatively impact the non-inferiority 
claim of the primary study endpoint or the general trends observed across all subgroups. 
Analysis of 6-month Follow-up Results 
Patient disposition and demography 
Of 260 patients in the FAS (132 in the Metvix group, 128 in the BF-200 ALA group) who completed the 
clinical part, 242 entered the FU phase [122 (88.4%) in the BF-200 ALA group and 120 (83.9%) in the 
Metvix group]. All BF-200 ALA treated patients (122 [88.4%]) and 117 (81.8%) Metvix treated patients 
completed the FU1 period 6 months after the last PDT. 3 patients in the Metvix group dropped out from FU1 
prematurely (2 patients were lost to FU, 1 patient decided to discontinue). The corresponding number of 
lesions entering the FU was 289, of which 239 lesions were superficial at baseline, 48 nodular, and 2 lesions 
belonged to the mixed differentiation/others subtype. Of the 289 lesions, 282 were completely cleared 12

weeks after the last PDT: 150 lesions in the BF-200 ALA group and 132 in the Metvix group. 
Efficacy analysis 
Of patients in the BF-200 ALA group with data who were complete responders 12 weeks after the last PDT, 
4 (3.3%; 95% CI 1.1; 8.7) were recurrent at the 6-month FU1. Of 114 complete responders with data in the 
Metvix group, 5 patients relapsed (4.4%; 95% CI 1.6; 10.4) until the 6-month FU1. In the PP analysis set 
113 patients with data in the BF-200 ALA group and 99 in the Metvix group were complete responders and 
entered 6-months FU 12 weeks after the last PDT. Of these patients, 4 (3.5%) were recurrent in the BF-200 
ALA group and 5 (5.1%) in the Metvix group. 
At the 6-month follow-up visit lesion recurrence rates were low in both treatment groups, with 2.9% and 
4.3% in the PPSFU of the BF-200 ALA and Metvix groups, respectively. In the FASFU, similar recurrence 
rates were observed for both applications. With respect to the different lesion subgroups, lower recurrence 
rates were obtained in the BF-200 ALA group compared to Metvix for superficial BCC (1.8% vs. 4.3%), for 
BCCs in the treatment area neck/trunk (3.2% vs 4.9%) and extremities (3.2% vs. 4.8%), for lesions with a 
baseline lesion area between > 50 mm² - ≤ 100 mm² (0% vs 8.6%), and for lesion with a thickness at 
baseline between >0.4-0.6 mm (0% vs 5.0%) and >0.6-0.8 mm (0% vs 14.3%), respectively. BF-200 ALA 
showed slightly higher recurrence rates compared to Metvix in lesions with an area between > 100 mm² - ≤ 
150 mm² (5.4% vs 4.0%) and >150 mm² (3.9% vs 2.2%), and in lesions with a thickness of >1.0 to 1.5 mm 
(25% vs 0%), respectively.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The trial ALA-BCC-CT008 was a multinational, randomised, positive-controlled, observer blind, 
parallel-group (1:1 ratio) study divided in 2 parts: an observer blind part consisting of a screening period 
and a treatment period, and a follow-up (FU) part for a total study duration for each patient of approximately 
61 to 64 months. Efficacy and safety of Ameluz for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) with a

thickness of <2mm has been evaluated in 281 patients enrolled in a phase III clinical trial. In this study a 
total of 138 patients were treated with Ameluz. All patients had 1 to 3 BCC lesions on the face/forehead, bald 
scalp, extremities and/or neck/trunk. In this study, photodynamic therapy with Ameluz was tested for 
non-inferiority to a cream containing 16% methyl-aminolevulinate (MAL, 
methyl-[5-amino-4-oxopentanoate]). The red light source provided a narrow spectrum around 635 nm at a 
light dose of 37 J/cm2 (BF-RhodoLED). The primary endpoint was complete patient clearance 12 weeks after 
the last photodynamic therapy. The margin for the non-inferiority was a delta of 15% with a significance 
level of 0.025 (on sided). The non-inferiority margin was derived from an analysis of previous studies and is 
therefore justified from a statistical perspective. However, there was no evidence provided that the margin 
can be regarded as clinically relevant as per the guidance on the Guideline on the choice of the 
non-inferiority margin (EMEA/CPMP/EWP/2158/99). Considering that the difference between the two 
treatments is small, this does not pose a major issue. The primary analysis was also based on the PP 
population, which is different than what is recommended in the guideline EMEA/CPMP/EWP/2158/99. As 
both PP and FAS analysis are similar, this was not raised as a major issue. Therefore, the design of the trial 
was considered acceptable and no major issues were raised with the conduct of the study. 
The baseline characteristics were well balanced and disease characteristics between the two groups were 
comparable. No relevant differences have been found between the two groups. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Based on results of overall patient complete response 12-weeks after the last PDT (2 to 4 PDT sessions in 
total), BF-200 ALA (Ameluz) was non-inferior compared to Metvix in the treatment of thin (≤2 mm 
thickness), (non-aggressive) BCC with PDT. Patients treated with BF-200 ALA had 93.4% complete response 
compared with 91.8% for the Metvix treated group. For BCC lesions, overall lesion complete response rate 
12 weeks after the last PDT was 94.6% with BF-200 ALA and 92.9% with Metvix. For nodular BCC, 89.3% of 
the lesions were cleared with BF-200 ALA and 78.6% with Metvix.  Patient satisfaction 12 weeks after last 
PDT was approximately 87% of patients treated with BF-200 ALA compared to 86% for patients treated with 
Metvix.   
In the Phase III study ALA-BCC-CT008 follow up period, there is evidence that the efficacy achieved 12 
weeks after the last PDT is maintained during the 6-month follow up period. Recurrence rates in the different 
subgroups were in most cases slightly lower for BF-200 ALA than for Metvix. Follow-up results of 
ALA-BCC-CT008 provided evidence for a continuous improvement of skin quality until 6 months after 
treatment in both treatment groups, particularly for roughness/dryness/scaliness, hyperpigmentation, and 
mottled or irregular pigmentation. 
The proposed wording of the indication would be for a first line indication for treatment of BCC. However, the 
current dermatological standards and guidelines recommend surgery as the main first line treatment for 
BCC. In addition, the comparator is currently indicated for second line indication, and is indicated for patients 
which are unsuitable for other available therapies due to possible treatment related morbidity and poor 
cosmetic outcome. Therefore, the indication for Ameluz has been aligned with the second line indication for 
Metvix, but slightly reworded for conciseness.   
The MAH was requested to submit data on the follow-up at 12 months. It is acknowledged that the number 
of discontinuations in both arms for patients who entered the follow up phase (N=122 for BF-200 ALA and 
N=120 for the Metvix arm) was very low in both, the first 6 months (N=3) and the second 6 months (N=4) 
follow-up periods. Recurrence rates are comparable for both arms for the Full Analysis Set, as shown by the 
main analysis with sensitivity analyses, and across subgroups. Clinical efficacy was re-assessed at follow-up 
visits 6 and 12 months after the last photodynamic therapy. Lesion recurrence rates after 6 and 12 months 
were 2.9% and 4.3%, respectively, for Ameluz and 6.7% and 8.2% for MAL.

BCC can be distinguished into non-aggressive and aggressive forms by their fundamentally different 
biological characteristics as well as their size and body localization. The prototypical varieties of BCC related 
to non-aggressive BCC include primary nodular (nBCC) and superficial BCC (sBCC) or mixed (n/sBCC) types 
which tend to be less aggressive in general and thus have a good to intermediate prognosis. Clinically and 
histologically aggressive BCCs are characterized by an infiltrating, sclerosing/morphoeic, micronodular, or 
metatypical basosquamous pattern. Perivascular or perineural invasion are features associated with the 
most aggressive tumour forms. Therefore, the term non-aggressive has been replaced by superficial and 
nodular in the indication and throughout the SmPC. No definite conclusions regarding the quantitative 
treatment effect of BF-200 ALA on the overall complete responder rates as dependent on the subgroup 
categories could be drawn due to limited number of patients in some of the subgroup categories. For the vast 
majority of the lesions in both groups (92.6% in the BF-200 ALA group and 90.6% in the Metvix group), 
lesion complete response rates of ≥87% were achieved in lesions with a baseline thickness measurement of 
0.0 to 1.0 mm. The lesion complete response rates in both groups decreased in lesions with a baseline 
thickness measurement of >1.0 mm. With only a small number of lesions >1.0 mm included in this study, 
the section 5.1 of the SmPC has described information on the thickness of the lesions that were part of the 
inclusion criteria as <2 mm. The lesion thickness has not been included in the indication as it is also not 
included in the indication of the comparator Metvix. An analysis exploring a potential relationship between 
patient complete response 12 weeks after the last PDT and lesion thickness at baseline indicated that 
baseline lesion thickness had a significant influence on patient complete response. Therefore, it has been 
specified in SmPC section 5.1 that the patients in the trial had an entry criteria that the BCC thickness was 
<2 mm. The wording “in adults including the elderly” was not accepted. As adults by definition include the 
elderly this redundancy is unnecessary and should be avoided (the same argument applies to the actinic 
keratosis indication wording and the BCC indication wording). It is recommended that the response of BCC 
lesions may be confirmed by histological examination of biopsy material, if considered necessary. 
Subsequently, close long term clinical monitoring of BCC is recommended, with histology if necessary (SmPC 
section 4.2). 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of Ameluz has been demonstrated in a phase III trial which showed that Ameluz is non-inferior 
to Metvix in terms of overall patient complete response 12-weeks after the last PDT (2 to 4 PDT sessions in 
total) with 93.4% versus 91.8%, respectively, in patients with superficial and/or nodular basal cell 
carcinoma unsuitable for surgical treatment.  Results of other secondary and tertiary analyses, including 
mean percentage reduction of total lesion area 12 weeks after the last PDT, patient complete response 12 
weeks after PDT-2 (PDT cycle 1), cosmetic outcome, change in skin quality assessments and patient 
satisfaction, also demonstrated non-inferiority of BF-200 ALA compared to Metvix.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Of the 281 patients randomized, 21 patients prematurely discontinued the clinical phase of the study due to 
patient’s decision (6 patients), AEs (5 patients), lost to FU (4 patients), protocol violation (3 patients), other 
reason (1 patient each due to “absence at V7 and V8” and “treatment stopped due to patient after V4”) and 
death (1 patient).

Patient exposure 
A total of 281 patients were exposed to PDT in the first session of cycle 1 (PDT-1): 138 patients received 
BF-200 ALA and 143 patients received Metvix. Approximately half of the patients (116 [41.3%]) who 
completed cycle 1 had lesions that were not completely cleared at Visit 5 and began a second treatment 
cycle at that visit (PDT-3: 55 [39.9%] patients received BF-200 ALA and 61 [42.7%] patients received 
Metvix).

TEAEs 
The term AE covers any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, syndrome, or illness that develops or 
worsens during the period of observation in the clinical study. The List of Critical Terms (1998 adaptation of 
WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology Critical Terms List), was used as guidance for AEs that may be 
considered serious because they are medically important. An SAE is one that occurs at any dose (including 
overdose) and: 
•  Results in death. 
• 
Is life-threatening. “Life-threatening” means that the patient was at immediate risk of death at the time 
of the SAE; it does not refer to an SAE that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe. 
•  Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
•  Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
• 
• 
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
Is an important medical event. 
All patients in both groups reported at least one TEAE. The most common system organ class (SOC) reported 
was “general disorders and administration site conditions”. Application site pain was the most common 
individual TEAEs in both groups, reported in 134 (97.1%) patients in the BF-200 ALA group and in 143 
(100.0%) patients in the Metvix group. 
The frequency of severe TEAEs was slightly higher in the BF-200 ALA group (54 [39.1%] patients) compared 
to the Metvix group (48 [33.6%] patients).

Analysis of 6-month Follow-up Results for safety 
Of the 281 patients randomized to the study, 270 (96.1%) entered the follow-up period 1 (Safety Analysis 
Set- SAF), 136 (95.1%) patients in the Metvix group and 134 (97.1%) patients in the BF-200 ALA group. 31 
patients in the Metvix group and 28 patients in the BF-200 ALA group experienced at least one 
post-treatment AE. All AEs were assessed as unrelated or unlikely related, except 1 AE in the Metvix group 
(recurrent BCC) and 3 AEs in the BF-200 ALA group (recurrent BCC, solar lentigo, and lichenoid keratosis) 
which are assessed as possibly related. 
One AE in the BF-200 ALA group (musculoskeletal discomfort) was erroneously classified as definitely 
related, and corrected by the investigator to the causality “unrelated” after data base closure. The highest 
proportion of AEs were reported for the SOC Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts 
and polyps), comprising mostly of BCCs (16 in the Metvix group, and 11 in the BF-200 ALA group). BF-200 
ALA were recurrent BCCs. Another 5 BCCs in each group occurred outside the treatment area. The majority 
of untreated/new BCCs was observed in non-naïve patients (9 in the Metvix, 7 in the BF-200 ALA group, 
respectively). Of the 16 patients with BCC in the Metvix group, 1 patient suffered additionally from SCC, 
another patient from Bowen’s disease. An event of melanoma had not been reported to the sponsor. Overall, 
12 SAEs in 11 patients were reported during the 6-month FU. 10 patients experienced one SAE each (4 
patients in the Metvix group and 6 patients the BF-200 ALA group, respectively). One patient in the Metvix 
group suffered from 2 SAEs. All patients recovered from the SAEs, except 2 patients in the BF-200 ALA group 
who had an ongoing SAE (angioedema and breast cancer, respectively). All SAEs were assessed as unrelated 
to the study medication. 
Two further SAEs were listed in the BF-200 ALA group, both for unrelated, new BCCs that occurred during 
the clinical part of the study but were not correctly listed in the CSR. Both had been removed by surgery, 
resulting in recovery of the patients.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious TEAEs were lower in the BF-200 ALA (3 [2.2%]) group compared to the Metvix group (7 [4.9%]), all 
assessed by the investigator as not related to study medication. 
According to the AE database, 5 patients (1 patient in the BF-200 ALA group and 4 patients in the Metvix 
group) had TEAEs that led to study discontinuation. However, 1 of the 4 patients in the Metvix group was 
erroneously included due to a data entry error at the site. Another patient in the Metvix group died and this 
event was counted as both a death and an event leading to discontinuation. 
Deaths 
One patient in the Metvix group died during the observer blind part of the study due to an unknown cause. 
The investigator and sponsor assessed the event as not related to study medication. 
Laboratory findings 
Hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis data were examined for changes that occurred during 
treatment and within 12 weeks after discontinuation or completion of patients’ last PDT. Laboratory 
parameters showed no clinically relevant changes.

Post marketing experience 
There is no post marketing experience with the product in the applied indication as it has not been previously 
approved. 
During the post-marketing period, the MAH became aware of one scientific publication referring to 5 
individual case reports pertaining to 5 patients who experienced transient memory impairment after PDT. 
Three of the 5 patient had been treated with ALA (exact product unknown) and 2 have been treated with 
MAL10. Torsnes et al. commented on the publication by Reinholz et al. and provided an additional case report

pertaining to a patient who experienced memory impairment after MAL-PDT11 . No reports on amnesia 
during PDT were reported from clinical trials.  
No further reports pertaining to memory impairment have been reported directly to the MAH until datalock 
point of a report. However, after data lock one serious case referring to memory impairment was reported. 
This case was considered serious. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The frequency of severe TEAEs was higher in the BF-200 ALA group (54 [39.1%] patients) compared to the 
Metvix group (48 [33.6%] patients). The most commonly reported TEAEs in both groups were also the most 
commonly reported related TEAEs, and were TEAEs of the application site (pain, erythema, pruritus, and 
edema). The most frequent skin reaction observed during PDT in both treatment groups was erythema, 
which was observed with slightly lower frequency in the BF-200 ALA group compared to the Metvix group. No 
statistically differences were observed between the two treatment groups in patient reported frequencies 
and severity rating of local discomfort (characterized as itching, burning, or other discomfort), and local 
pain. The frequencies of patients with serious TEAEs (all assessed by the investigator as not related to study 
medication) and TEAEs that led to study discontinuation were low and comparable between the treatment 
groups.  
No other clinically relevant safety concerns were observed during the observer blind part of this study. 
From the current indication in AK, the most common signs and symptoms are application site irritation, 
erythema, pain, and oedema. Most adverse reactions occur during illumination or shortly afterwards. The 
symptoms are usually of mild or moderate intensity (investigator’s assessment on a 4 -point scale), and last 
for 1 to 4 days in most cases. Following the assessment of the trial CT008 for BCC, new ADRs have been 
identified which have been included in the section 4.8 of the SmPC. These are vision blurred, visual 
impairment (frequency as uncommon), burning pain (frequency as very common), inflammation (frequency 
as uncommon) and back pain (uncommon) were considered related to the treatment. A new ADR, TGA, was 
observed during the post-marketing period and was assessed during the renewal procedure.  The available 
data on TGA pertain to 2 case report publications (ALA and MAL) and 1 spontaneous case reported to the 
MAH after DLP of this report but no events were reported in the clinical trial program. Patient and Health Care 
Professionals should be adequately informed on the risk of memory impairment caused by stress as 
sometimes occurs during PDT sessions. Therefore, “Transient memory loss and Transient Global Amnesia 
(TGA)” was added as further potential identified risk to the summary table of safety concerns and as a new 
ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Routine risk minimisation activities are considered sufficient to monitor this 
new ADR as the product is applied by health care professionals, who should recognize newly developed 
neurological and/or psychological. 
There were two additional warnings that have been included in the SmPC section 4.4. Following 
post-marketing experience, TGA has been identified based on literature article. Therefore it has been 
included as a new ADR and included as an important potential risk as part of the important safety concerns 
in the RMP as there is not yet enough evidence to include it as an identified risk. 
Risk of Transient Global Amnesia (TGA) 
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) may be a precipitating factor for transient global amnesia in very rare 
instances. Although the exact mechanism is not known, stress and pain associated with PDT may increase 
the risk to develop transient amnesia. If amnesia is observed, the PDT must be discontinued immediately 
(see section 4.8).

photodynamic therapy'. Br J Dermatol. 2016 Jan;174(1):237.

PDT is usually accompanied by inflammation of the skin, which is regarded as an important response part of 
the treatment effect with Ameluz. As the exclusion criteria from the clinical trial for BCC, excluded patients 
that were undergoing immunosuppressant therapy, a new warning has been included to inform the HCP that 
the use of immunosuppressants during treatment with Ameluz is not recommended (SmPC section 4.4). 
Except for TGA, no new important safety concerns have been identified. The important identified risk of 
application site reaction is included in the SmPC. The important potential risks of application site 
hypersensitivity, severe application site reaction in combination with photosensitizing medication or in 
patients with photodermatoses, recurrence rate in treated lesions and conversion into SCC and other types 
of skin cancer are being managed through routine risk minimisation measures. The concern for off label use 
has been changed to only include acne and warts as the use in BCC is being approved and is no longer a 
potential risk.  There is still important missing information for the treatment of immunosuppressed patients, 
safety in patients with skin type I (Fitzpatrick) and safety in pediatric or adolescent patients. The risks are 
minimised through recommendations in the SmPC and have been included in the RMP. No additional risk 
minimisation measures are necessary since the product is applied under the supervision of health care 
professionals experienced in the use of photodynamic therapy who should ensure that the product is used 
according to the label and would recognise any of the safety concerns described in the PI. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In summary, frequencies and severity of TEAEs are consistent with the ADRS and safety concerns that have 
been previously evaluated. No new safety concerns were observed during the observer blind part of this 
study or during the 6 month follow up period. The safety and tolerability of BF-200 ALA in BCC patients is 
considered acceptable and manageable taking into account the recommendations in the SmPC, risk 
minimisation measures and through PhV. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The next data lock point will be 14/06/2018.  
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 10 could be acceptable if the applicant 
implements the changes to the RMP as described in the PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
The applicant implemented the changes in the RMP as requested by PRAC and/or CHMP.  
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 11 (dated 23 November 2016) which included also

The current and proposed package labelling 
und the package leaflet clearly instruct to keep 
the drug out of sight and reach of children. 
The current and proposed package leaflet 
clarifies that AK does not occur in children and 
adolescents. 
The PRAC having considered the updated data submitted was of the opinion that the proposed routine risk 
minimisation measures remains sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indications. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
Consequently, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. Editorial changes have been 
proposed in sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.2, 6.6 and 9 of the SmPC. The Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. There are two new warnings that have been included in section 4.4, that the use of 
immunosuppressants during treatment with Ameluz is not recommended and of the risk of transient global 
amnesia. 
The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD 
template version 10. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: The changes 
made to the SmPC do not lead to important changes to the package leaflet.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
BCC are composed of proliferating keratinocytes from basal cells of the epidermis. It generally demonstrates 
a relatively innocuous course, with slow growth and only minimal local extension into the dermis. BCCs are 
locally invasive tumours and metastases occur in less than 1 in 10,000 tumours (LeBoit, 2006). The main 
area of the body affected by BCC is the skin of the head or neck where 70% of primary BCC cases occur. In 
addition, 85% of metastatic cases and 90% of recurrent cases occur at these sites. Therefore, if treated 
accordingly this disease typically has a favourable prognosis. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines on treatments for BCC, the main 
objective is achieving maximal preservation of function and cosmetics. European guidelines for the 
management of BCC list a variety of treatment options aiming at eradicating the tumour while ensuring an 
acceptable cosmetic outcome for the patients3,4,7,8 . Among therapies recommended for low risk early BCCs, 
these include surgical excision, radiotherapy (low wave X-ray, brachytherapy, high energy radiotherapy) 
and 5-fluorouracil, photodynamic therapy (PDT), particularly for the treatment of large or multiple lesions. 
In several European countries, methyl aminolevulinate (Metvix) with PDT has been approved for the 
treatment of superficial and/or nodular basal cell carcinoma unsuitable for other available therapies due to 
possible treatment related morbidity and poor cosmetic outcome; such as lesions on the mid-face or ears, 
lesions on severely sun damaged skin, large lesions, or recurrent lesions. 5-aminolevilinic acid (Ameluz), a 
product from the same class of products as Metvix, has been approved for the use of Actinic Keratosis. The 
MAH has now applied for an indication for treatment of superficial and/or nodular BCC. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The efficacy of 5-aminolaevulinic acid in the treatment of superficial and/or nodular BCC has been 
demonstrated on the basis of a non-inferiority trial compared to Metvix. The inclusion criteria was for 
patients with lesions with thickness of <2mm (SmPC section 5.1). The primary efficacy endpoint of the study 
was the overall patient complete response 12 weeks after the last PDT which showed 93.4% of responders 
in the Ameluz group compared to 91.8% of responders in the Metvix group (97.5% one-sided CI: -6., 
p-value <0.0001) and an Odds ratio of 1.26 (97.5% one-sided CI). An overall complete responder was 
defined as a patient in whom all treated BCC lesions were completely cleared after the last PDT, i.e. after 
PDT-1 or after PDT-2 if re-treatment was performed. A secondary efficacy variable was the lesion complete 
response 12 weeks after the last PDT which showed 94.6% of responses in Ameluz group compared to 
92.9% in the Metvix group. For nodular BCC, 89.3% of the lesions were cleared with Ameluz compared to 
78.6% with Metvix. In addition, the relationship between patient complete response and lesion thickness at 
baseline as well as the relationship between lesion complete response and lesion thickness at baseline were 
evaluated. In the treatment of thin (≤2 mm thickness), non-aggressive (superficial and/or nodular) BCC the 
overall patient complete response rate 12 weeks after the last PDT was 93.4%, which is slightly higher than 
the comparator with 91.8% and also demonstrated non-inferiority of Ameluz compared to Metvix.  
Results of other secondary and tertiary analyses, including mean percentage reduction of total lesion area 
12 weeks after the last PDT, patient complete response 12 weeks after PDT-2 (PDT cycle 1), cosmetic 
outcome, change in skin quality assessments and patient satisfaction supported the primary analysis.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In terms of the non-inferiority claim of Ameluz met its primary endpoint and there are no uncertainties about 
the favourable effects. An analysis exploring a potential relationship between patient complete response 12 
weeks after the last PDT and lesion thickness at baseline indicated that baseline lesion thickness had a 
significant influence on patient complete response. The lesion complete response rates in both groups 
decreased in lesions with a baseline thickness measurement of >1.0 mm. However, as stated in section 5.1 
of the SmPC, there were only a limited number of patients with number of lesions >1.0 mm. As the 
treatment is aimed at patients with early disease with superficial and/or nodular BCC, the lesions treated are 
not expected to be bigger in size than the lesions in patients that have been recruited in the clinical trial.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
All patients treated in both groups reported at least one TEAE. The most commonly reported SOC in both 
treatment groups was “general disorders and administration site conditions”. Frequencies were comparable 
between the groups. Application site pain was the most common individual TEAE in both groups, reported in 
134 (97.1%) patients in the Ameluz and in 143 (100.0%) patients in the Metvix group. The most frequent 
skin reaction observed during PDT in both treatment groups was erythema, which was observed with slightly 
lower frequency in the Ameluz group compared to the Metvix group. Following the review of the safety 
database, the following new ADRs vision blurred (uncommon), visual impairment (uncommon), burning pain 
(very common), inflammation (uncommon), fatigue (uncommon) and back pain (uncommon) have been 
included in the section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
During the post-authorisation surveillance experience, a new ADR, transient global amnesia, has been 
included as an important potential risk with a frequency of unknown, as it was reported in the literature. It 
has been included in the SmPC as a warning in section 4.4, as an ADR in 4.8 and also in the RMP as an 
important potential risk as there is not sufficient evidence to include it as an important identified risk. A new 
warning on the use of immunosuppressants was also included as patients using immunosuppressant therapy 
were excluded from the trial. Routine risk minimisation measure are considered sufficient to mitigate the risk 
as the product is administered under the supervision of a physician, a nurse or other healthcare professional 
experienced in the use of photodynamic therapy. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are no important uncertainties concerning the unfavourable effects (see RMP and summary of safety 
concerns).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Ameluz is non-inferior to the comparator Metvix in the treatment of thin (≤2 mm thickness), superficial 
and/or nodular BCC, in terms of overall patient complete response rate at 12 weeks after past PDT (93.4% 
complete response in the PP analysis set, 2 to 4 PDT sessions in total) and overall lesion complete response 
rate 12 weeks after the last PDT. Clinical efficacy was re-assessed at follow-up visits 6 and 12 months after 
the last photodynamic therapy. Lesion recurrence rates after 6 and 12 months were 2.9% and 4.3%, 
respectively, for Ameluz and 6.7% and 8.2% for MAL. 
Frequencies and severity of TEAEs seem to be consistent between the two treatments arms and are also 
consistent with the know safety profile of Ameluz in AK. There were no new important identified risks other 
than application site reaction which was already known. The new ADR of TGA and warning on the use of 
immunosuppressants are being monitored through routine PhV. Overall, the safety is considered 
manageable and acceptable and no additional risk minimisation activities are required.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the benefits of Ameluz in the BCC patient population for the treatment of 
superficial and/or nodular basal cell carcinoma unsuitable for surgical treatment due to possible 
treatment-related morbidity and/or poor cosmetic outcome in adults outweigh the risks of application site 
reaction, erythema, pruritus, pain, and oedema. Therefore, the benefit risk balance is considered positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The indication for Ameluz has been aligned with the indication of Metvix, a product from the same class of 
PDT treatment products, as the treatment is for the same early BCC patient population. The inclusion criteria 
of patients in the clinical trial was limited to patients that had lesions <2 mm and excluded patient with 
porphyria, patients undergoing immunosuppressant therapy and patients with BCC lesions on embryonic 
fusion planes (i.e including portions of the scalp, ears, nose, and lips). These criteria have been reflected in 
the SmPC where the thickness of the lesions treated (<2 mm) is described in 5.1. There is a contraindication 
in 4.3 for porphyria and warnings in 4.4 that immunosuppressants should be avoided during treatment and 
that there is a risk to mucous membranes and eye irritation. Hence, there was no need to include these 
restrictions in the indication as they have been covered adequately in the SmPC.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II

Extension of Indication from "Treatment of actinic keratosis of mild to moderate severity on the face and 
scalp (Olsen grade 1 to 2; see section 5.1) and of field cancerization" to the following: 
Treatment of superficial and/or nodular basal cell carcinoma unsuitable for surgical treatment due to 
possible treatment-related morbidity and/or poor cosmetic outcome in adults. 
Consequently, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. Editorial changes have been 
proposed in sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.2, 6.6 and 9 of the SmPC. The Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated 
accordingly. There are two new warnings that have been included in section 4.4 that the use of 
immunosuppressants during treatment with Ameluz is not recommended and of the risk of transient global 
amnesia. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to bring the PI in line 
with the latest QRD template version 10. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Package Leaflet and to the 
Risk Management Plan (RMP).

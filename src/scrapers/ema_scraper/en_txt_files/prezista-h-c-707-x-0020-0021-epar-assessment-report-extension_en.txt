1. 
Introduction 
As  of  the  end  of  2007,  an  estimated  33.2  million  people  worldwide  –  30.8  million  adults  and 
2.5 million  children  younger  than  15  years  –  were  living  with  human  immunodeficiency  virus 
(HIV)/AIDS. An estimated 370,000 children under age 15 became infected with HIV in 2007 (Source: 
UNAIDS).  In  western  and  central  Europe,  an  estimated  740,000  persons  were  living  with  HIV  in 
2006.  In  2005,  27,555  new  HIV  diagnoses  were  reported  by  26  European  countries,  of  which  1% 
(275) were children < 15 years of age and 10% (2,755) were young people aged between 15 and 24 
years. 
HIV-related  mortality  and  opportunistic  and  other  related  infections  have  significantly  decreased  in 
HIV-infected  children  in  the  era  of  Highly  Active  AntiRetroviral  Treatment  (HAART).  More 
specifically,  since  the  introduction  of  Non-nucleoside  Reverse  Transcriptase  Inhibitor  (NNRTI)-  or 
protease inhibitor (PI)-containing combinations, HIV mortality in children in resource-rich countries 
has decreased by 70%. However, along with the wider use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-1 
infected  children  and  adolescents,  treatment  failure  (virologic  or  associated  with  tolerance)  and  the 
emergence  of  resistance  have  become  of  growing  concern.  Treatment-experienced  HIV-1  infected 
paediatric  patients  not  adequately  controlled  on  currently  available  antiretroviral  (ARV)  drugs 
represent a population with high medical need. Off-label use of ARV drugs approved for treatment of 
HIV-1  infection  in  adults,  in  the  absence  of  appropriate  paediatric  formulations  and  dose 
recommendations,  is  not  uncommon.  Consequently,  there  continues  to  be  a  need  for  effective  and 
tolerable therapeutic agents for use in the paediatric population. 
The  use  of  PIs  has  been  a  major  breakthrough  in  the  therapy  for  HIV-1  infection,  substantially 
reducing morbidity and mortality in infected individuals. However, the long-term use of the currently 
licensed PIs is often hampered by different factors such as poor compliance due to a high pill burden 
and  food  restrictions,  side  effects  with  impact  on  the  quality  of  life  and  the  emergence  of  resistant 
virus that is no longer inhibited by the medicine used. 
Preclinical data supported clinical trials of a darunavir/ritonavir-containing regimen in HIV-1 infected 
paediatric  patients  aged  3  years  and  older.  The  paediatric  clinical  development  program  of 
darunavir/ritonavir  first  focused  on  treatment-experienced  HIV-1  infected  children  and  adolescents 
from 6 to < 18 years of age, given the medical need in this population due to virologic failure, resistant 
virus strains and/or tolerability issues.  
In order to accommodate posologies in children and adolescents, the Applicant developed two lower 
strength tablets, 75 mg and 150 mg, for which a Marketing Authorisation (MA) is sought within this 
line extension procedure. In order to support the indication in treatment experienced paediatric patients 
above the age of 6, a Phase II trial, investigating the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and efficacy 
of darunavir/ritonavir in the target population (TMC114-212, DELPHI), was initiated during the third 
quarter of 2006.  
The  primary  Week-24  analyses  were  performed  (as  requested  during  the  assessment  of  the  initial 
Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for the 300 mg strength) and were submitted within the 
initial application for this procedure. With the submission of the 24 Week analysis of study C212, the 
Applicant has consequently fulfilled follow-up measure (FUM) 025. Furthermore, the Week-48 data 
were  submitted  by  the  Applicant  in  the  framework  of  the  responses  to  the  D120  CHMP  List  of 
Question of this extension application. 
In parallel, a type II variation (EMEA/H/C/707/II/25) was submitted on 21 January 2009, in order to 
extend  the  existing  indication  for  the  300  mg  and  600  mg  film-coated  tablets,  to  also  include  ARV 
treatment experienced children and adolescents aged 6 years or older.   
The PI darunavir (TMC114) is a close analogue of amprenavir. The binding of darunavir to the wild-
type protease was 87-fold greater than that of amprenavir versus 33-fold more tightly than amprenavir 
in the case of multi-drug resistant protease. Darunavir binds also more tightly to HIV-1 proteases than 
the PIs indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, amprenavir, lopinavir, and atazanavir.

Darunavir 300 & 600 mg  film coated tablets are currently licensed for use in treatment-experienced 
patients  at  a  dose  of 600 mg  twice  daily  (b.i.d.),  with  ritonavir 100  mg  b.i.d.;  the  indication  for  the  
300  mg  and  600  mg  was  extended  to  included  ‘treatment  experienced  adults’  (variation 
EMEA/H/C/707/II/14: Commission Decision dated 25-11-2008). The outcome thereof was also taken 
into  account  during  the  procedure.  The  400  mg  film  coated  tablet  is  currently  authorised  in  the 
treatment of ART naïve patients at a dose of 800 mg once daily (q.d.), with ritonavir 100 mg q.d., both 
in combination with other ARV medicinal products. For the added new strengths - 75 mg and 150 mg 
film  coated  tablet  –  the  following  new  indication  was  initially  proposed  by  the  Applicant  (of  note, 
following  the  submission  of  the  line  extensions  at  issue,  the  indication  for  the  300  mg  and  600  mg 
strengths was extended to include ‘treatment experienced adults’):   
PREZISTA,  co-administered  with  low  dose  ritonavir  is  indicated  in  combination  with  other 
antiretroviral  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV-1) 
infection in highly pre-treated adult patients who failed more than one regimen containing a protease 
inhibitor  (PI)  and  for  the  treatment  of  HIV-1  infection  in  antiretroviral  treatment-experienced 
adolescents and children of 6 years and above.  
The proposed posology for children and adolescents was: 
Antiretroviral treatment-experienced paediatric patients (6 to 17 years of age) (see section 5.1) 
The recommended dose of PREZISTA with low dose ritonavir for paediatric patients (6 to 17 years of 
age and weighing at least 20 kg) is based on body weight (see table below) and should not exceed the 
recommended adult dose (600/100 mg b.i.d.). PREZISTA tablets should be taken with ritonavir twice 
daily and with food. The type of food does not affect exposure to darunavir. 
Recommended  dose  for  treatment-experienced  paediatric  patients  (6  to  17  years  of  age)  for 
PREZISTA tablets and ritonavir: 
Body weight (kg) 
Dose 
≥ 20 kg–< 30 kg 
375 mg PREZISTA/50 mg ritonavir b.i.d. 
≥ 30 kg–< 40 kg 
450 mg PREZISTA/60 mg ritonavir b.i.d.  
≥ 40 kg 
600 mg PREZISTA/100 mg ritonavir b.i.d. 
The proposed indication and posology were supported by the 24-Week and 48-Week data from study 
TMC114-C212. 
A Paediatric Investigation Plan (EMEA-000038-PIP01-07) was submitted on 20 September 2007 and 
an opinion was adopted on 4 June 2008 by the Paediatric Committee, in which a waiver was granted 
for children below the age of three. A PIP modification request was submitted on 30 October 2008 and 
an opinion on the modification was adopted on 12 December 2008 by the Paediatric Committee.  
No Scientific Advice from any European regulatory authority including the EMEA was requested by 
the Applicant within the framework of the current submission. The Paediatric European Network for 
Treatment of AIDS (PENTA) group provided advice on study protocols, which the Applicant took on 
board.  
The following guidelines in particular are applicable for the current application:  
•  Guideline  on  the  clinical  development  of  medicinal  products  for  treatment  of  HIV  infection 
(CPMP/EWP/633/02, Rev. 1) 
•  Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Paediatric Population (CPMP/ICH/2711/99) 
•  Clinical trials in small populations (CHMP/EWP/83561/2005) 
•  Guideline  on  conduct  of  pharmacovigilance  for  medicines  used  by  the  paediatric  population 
(EMEA/CHMP/PhVWP/235910/2005) 
The Applicant has declared that all studies were performed in accordance with ICH requirements for 
GCP.

2.  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
The  medicinal  product  Prezista  75  mg  is  presented  as  white  caplet-shaped  film-coated  tablets, 
debossed  with  “75”  on  one  side  and  “TMC”  on  the  other  side  and  containing  81.31  mg  darunavir 
ethanolate, corresponding to 75 mg darunavir. The medicinal product Prezista 150 mg is presented as 
white oval-shaped film-coated tablets, debossed with “150” on one side and “TMC” on the other side 
and containing 162.62 mg darunavir ethanolate, corresponding to 150 mg darunavir. 
The  other  ingredients  include  microcrystalline  cellulose,  colloidal  anhydrous  silica,  crospovidone, 
magnesium stearate, polyvinyl alcohol – partially hydrolyzed, macrogol 3350, titanium dioxide (E171) 
and  talc.  The  tablets  are  packed  in  a  high-density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  plastic  bottle  closed  with  a 
polypropylene (PP) child resistant closure. 
Active Substance  
The  active  substance  is  darunavir.  It  is  manufactured  in  solvated  form  as  darunavir  ethanolate,  an 
established  substance  not  described  in  any  pharmacopoeia.  Darunavir  ethanolate  is  a  hygroscopic 
substance, which is very slightly soluble in aqueous solutions. The active substance possesses 5 chiral 
centres  [1S,2R,3aS,4S,6aR]  and  stereochemical  purity  is  controlled  by  adequate  specifications  on 
stereochemical purity of the starting materials.  
Full  documentation  on  the  active  substance  has  already  been  assessed  within  the  original  Prezista 
application  (300  mg  strength),  including  all  post-marketing  authorisations,  and  within  the  Prezista  
400 mg and 600 mg line extension applications. For the 75 and 150 mg strength application, no new 
data  on  the  active  substance  has  been  submitted  as  the  data  is  identical  to  the  data  submitted  and 
assessed for the 400 mg and 600 mg strength line extensions. 
•  Manufacture 
The purified active substance is produced by a 4 step process, out of two starting  materials. For the 
manufacturing process reference is made to the already marketed 300 mg Prezista and the 400 mg and 
600  mg  strength  line  extensions.  For  the  manufacturing  of  the  75mg,  150  mg,  400  mg  and  600  mg 
strength, an additional active substance manufacturer has been introduced. This manufacturer applies a 
different  method  of  drying,  resulting  in  a  different  particle  size  distribution  of  the  active  substance. 
Due to this change, the formulation of the finished product needed to be modified, compared to the 
original  300  mg  strength,  in  order  to  keep  flow  characteristics  of  the  blend  at  an  acceptable  level. 
Bioequivalence/Bioavailability studies have been performed with modified formulations. 
•  Specification 
The active substance specification has been established in-house by the Applicant. The Applicant has 
justified  the  acceptance  criteria  for  the  particle  size  of  the  active  substance  by  submission  of  laser 
diffraction patterns of the active substance batches used in clinical studies. For both the approved and 
the proposed additional manufacturing site, batch analytical data demonstrating compliance with the 
active  substance  specification  have  been  provided  for  at  least  3  full  scale  batches.  The  data 
demonstrate  consistency  in  the  manufacturing  process  and  compliance  with  the  proposed  active 
substance specifications.  
•  Stability 
Active substance stability data from one active substance manufacturer has already been assessed in 
the  original  MAA  for  the  300  mg  strength.  Satisfactory  stability  data  covering  24  months  stability 
results at 25°C/60% RH and 30°C/65% RH and satisfactory 6 months results at 40°C/75% RH have 
been provided. For the 75 mg, 150 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg line extension applications, the Applicant 
4/20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
has submitted stability data from 3 full scale batches manufactured at the additional production site. 
The results cover 3 months at 30°C/65%RH and 40°C/75%RH.  
The manufacturing of the active substance at the new manufacturing sites does neither lead to changes 
in the impurity profile of the substance nor to the container closure system. It is thus not expected to 
affect the stability of the active substance. The particle size distribution is not expected to affect the 
stability of the active substance either. The currently approved active substance retest period for the 
300  mg  is  therefore  approvable  for  both  manufacturing  sites.  No  special  storage  conditions  are 
necessary. 
Medicinal Product 
The currently approved commercial dosage forms for darunavir are the 300 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg 
film-coated tablets. To address clinical needs, the additional 75 mg and 150 mg strengths have been 
developed.  The  75  mg  and  150  mg  film-coated  tablets  are  prepared  from  a  formulation  that  is 
qualitatively  the  same  as  that  used  for  the  approved  commercial  300  mg  film-coated  tablets, 
incorporating  all  the  same  ingredients,  with  a  minor  decrease  in  the  percentage  of  microcrystalline 
cellulose,  and  a  corresponding  minor  increase  in  the  percentages  of  colloidal  anhydrous  silica  and 
magnesium  stearate,  to  provide  better  powder  flow  properties  for  compression  of  the  tablets  (i.e. 
modified formulation). Multiple strengths (the 400 mg, 600 mg, 75 mg and 150 mg) of the modified 
formulation can be compressed from a common powder blend. 
•  Pharmaceutical Development 
The  development  of  the  75  mg  and  150  mg  tablets  is  based  on  the  300  mg  tablets.  However,  the 
Applicant  has  slightly  amended  the  formulation  for  the  75  mg  and  150  mg  strengths.  The  changes 
were considered necessary due to the change in particle size of the active substance. 
In  total,  14  different  formulations  were  evaluated.  The  test  formulations  varied  slightly  from  the 
current  300  mg  tablet formulation  and  were  manufactured  with  mechanically  dried  active  substance 
lots  having  a  small  particle  size  and  reduced  flow  properties.  For  each  formulation,  the  physical 
properties  of  the  final  blend  (particle  size,  flowability,  volume)  and  the  tablet  cores  (appearance, 
weight, hardness, disintegration time, friability) were measured. Results from the current formulation 
manufactured with a statically dried (i.e., good flowing) active substance lot were used as the baseline. 
The  currently  proposed  formulation  was  identified  as  having  improved  manufacturability:  improved 
flow properties and/or a reduced tendency for sticking without risk of blend flow obstruction or tablet 
sticking on scale-up.  
The qualitative composition of the 75 mg and 150 mg strengths is identical to the already approved 
300 mg tablets. Only a minor change in quantitative composition has taken place. The pharmaceutical 
development of the product has been adequately performed. 
•  Adventitious Agents 
There are no substances of ruminant animal origin present in the product nor have any been used in the 
manufacturing of this product, so a theoretical risk of transmitting TSE can be excluded. 
•  Manufacture of the Product 
The  manufacturing  process  for  the  75  mg,  150  mg,  400  mg  and  600  mg  strengths  of  the  darunavir 
modified formulation tablets consists of typical pharmaceutical delumping, blending of the tablet core 
components,  direct  compression  of  the  tablets  and  coating  of  the  tablet  cores.  The  manufacturing 
process  can  be  considered  as  standard.  Adequate  in-process  controls  are  proposed  and  the  critical 
aspects of the manufacturing process (e.g. particle size, manufacturability, active substance content of 
52%) are adequately dealt with.  
5/20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Batch  analysis  results  data  support  the  view  that  drug  dosage,  uniformity  of  content,  degradation 
products  and  chromatographic  purity,  dissolution,  and  microbiological  purity  are  adequately 
controlled. The Process Validation Scheme proposed by the Applicant is appropriate. 
•  Product Specification 
Appropriate medicinal product specifications have been set. The specifications for the finished product 
at  release  and  shelf  life  are  classical  for  this  pharmaceutical  form  and  include  tests  for  appearance, 
identity,  assay,  degradation,  dissolution,  microbiological  purity  and  uniformity  of  dosage  units.  The 
excipients  used  in  the  medicinal  product  comply  with  pharmacopoeial  requirements  or  national 
standards where applicable. The proposed test parameters and acceptance criteria are acceptable. The 
analytical  methods  have  been  adequately  described  and  validated.  Satisfactory  batch  analysis  data 
from  the  proposed  production  site  have  been  provided  for  the  75  mg  and  150  mg  strengths, 
demonstrating compliance with the release specification.  
•  Stability of the Product 
The  stability  studies  include  long  term  and  accelerated  studies,  bulk  tablet  studies,  in-use  studies, 
photostability studies and some auxiliary studies. The performed stability studies follow a bracketing 
design that incorporates the high (600 mg) and the low (75 mg) strengths of the modified formulation 
tablets,  the  various  package  sizes  and  counts,  and  the  tablet  colours  under  development.  The 
bracketing approach has been adequately justified. 
Stability data have been provided for 3 pilot scaled batches of 75 mg tablets and 6 pilot scaled batches 
of 600 mg tablets filled in two sizes of containers. The batches have been stored at 25°C/60% RH (12 
months) and 40°C/75% RH (6 months) in the proposed container. The conditions used in the stability 
studies  are  according  to  the  ICH  stability  guideline;  several  additional  conditions  have  also  been 
tested.  
Several  supportive  studies  have  been  performed.  Data  covering  24  months  have  been  provided  for  
2 batches of modified 300 mg tablets and 9 month data of modified 400 mg tablets stored at ICH long 
term and accelerated conditions. 
During all of the above studies, the test parameters were shown to be stable at all test conditions. In 
view  of  the  stability  results,  the  proposed  shelf-life,  with  no  special  storage  condition,  can  be 
approved.  
Furthermore,  in-use  stability  data  has  been  provided  demonstrating  that  the  modified  formulation  is 
stable after opening the container (75 mg, 3 months and 600 mg, 1 month). Photostability studies show 
that the product is not sensitive to light. In view of the observed stability during the in-use trials with 
the modified formulation, no additional in-use storage conditions nor a separate in-use shelf-life are 
considered  necessary  for  the  75  mg,  150  mg,  400  mg  and  600  mg  film-coated  tablets.  The  stability 
data are considered adequate and support the proposed shelf life for the 75 mg, 150 mg, 400 mg and 
600 mg strength. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The  active  substance  is  well  characterized  and  documented.  The  pharmaceutical  form  selected  is 
adequate taking into account the properties and the stability of the active substance. The excipients are 
commonly  used  for  this  kind  of  formulation  and  the  packaging  material  is  well  documented.  The 
manufacturing process enhances to obtain reproducible finished product batches. Stability tests under 
ICH conditions indicate that the product is stable for the proposed shelf life. At the time of the CHMP 
opinion, there were minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the benefit-risk balance of 
the product. The Applicant committed to resolve this as a follow up measure after the opinion, within 
an agreed timeframe.

3.  Non clinical aspects  
Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed and/or further evaluated 
With  respect  to  the  earlier  submitted  FUM  15  (regarding  possible  juvenile  toxicity  studies),  two 
studies in juvenile rats had been submitted. The results then suggested that the exposure in rats aged  
5-11 days is higher than in adult rats. After 23 days of age, it was comparable to adult rats.  
It was concluded that the high exposure at young age and the subsequent decrease in exposure from 
postnatal day 8 onwards is probably related to the maturation of the liver metabolising enzymes and 
the  blood  brain  barrier.  Data  further  showed  that  it  cannot  be  excluded  that  toxicity  was  higher  in 
animals aged 5-11 days than in adult animals. In animals aged 23-50 days, toxicity was not higher than 
in adult animals.  
These  results  suggested  that  in  rats,  roughly  after  3  Weeks,  the  exposure  in  juvenile  animals  is 
comparable  to  that  in  adults.  The  results  suggested  that  in  very  young  children,  who  do  not  have 
mature  drug-metabolising  enzymes  yet,  it  may  be  expected  that  comparable  doses  cause  a  higher 
exposure as compared to adults. The activity of drug metabolising enzymes increases from birth and 
approaches adult values by 1-3 years of age.  
In the current application, an extension of the indication to include also children from 6 years of age 
and  above  is  applied  for.  From  a  non-clinical  point  of  view,  based  on  the  data  as  given  above,  no 
increased exposure levels are expected in children of 6 years and older. Also, clinical pharmacokinetic 
data  in  children  of  6  years  and  older  indicate  a  comparable  exposure  compared  to  adults  at  the 
indicated  dose  (see  clinical  part  of  this  report).  From  a  non-clinical  point  of  view,  no  additional 
toxicity is expected in children from 6 years of age and above. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant has provided an overview with the available information regarding environmental risk. 
No  new  information  was  provided.  Since  FUM  13  and  FU2  013.1  sequel  to  FUM  13  already  have 
been fulfilled, no new information regarding the environmental risk is needed. During the registration 
procedure  and  the  subsequent  follow-up  measures,  an  environmental  risk  assessment  has  been 
performed which was based on the standard penetration factor (Fpen) of 1%. It is not expected that the 
use of darunavir will be extended beyond that indicated by the default penetration factor because of 
this proposed line extension and new indication.

4.  Clinical aspects 
The Applicant submitted one clinical (phase II) study in support of the current application. This study, 
TMC114-C212,  included  treatment-experienced  HIV-1  infected  paediatric  patients.  Darunavir  was 
administered  orally  either  as  the  commercial  300  mg  tablet  formulation  (F016)  and/or  as  a  dose 
proportional  75  mg  tablet  formulation  (F027),  together  with  low  dose  ritonavir  (80  mg/ml  oral 
solution, or capsule 100 mg). TMC114-C212 consisted of two parts. Part I was the dose finding part of 
the study, in which the short-term safety, tolerability, antiviral activity, and pharmacokinetics of lower 
(dose  Group  A)  and  higher  (dose  Group  B)  weight-based  dose  levels  of  darunavir/ritonavir  were 
evaluated. The respective dose groups were further divided into weight bands. In Part II, the long-term 
safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of the darunavir/ritonavir dose selected from Part I 
(dose  Group  B)  were  evaluated.  In  both  parts  of  the  study,  darunavir/ritonavir  was  administered  in 
combination with other ARV medications. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Dose selection (Part I) 
The selected doses in Part I of this study were based upon the adult 600/100 mg dose and extrapolated 
using allometric scaling. This was applied as children have a faster metabolism than adults, and linear 
scaling may have resulted in an inadequate darunavir exposure. However, while this may be true for 
darunavir, as indicated by the non-clinical data as discussed above, it could be questioned for ritonavir. 
Ritonavir is used as booster in this study. As such, ritonavir plasma levels should be high enough to 
ensure (complete) inhibition of CYP3A4. CYP3A4 levels in paediatrics/adolescents are comparable to 
those in adults, and especially in young children, metabolism by CYP3A4 is higher.  
The  ratio  of  darunavir:ritonavir  ranged  from  4.5:1  to  7.5:1  in  this  study.  For  adult  treatment-
experienced patients, the ratio of darunavir:ritonavir is 6:1. Therefore, the ritonavir doses used in this 
trial are in line with the ratio of darunavir:ritonavir in treatment-experienced adults. A comparison of 
the use of 100 and 200 mg ritonavir as pharmacokinetic enhancer for darunavir in a previous Phase I 
trial  showed  that  higher  dose  of  ritonavir  increased  its  exposure,  but  not  relevantly  to  darunavir. 
Additionally, in a drug-drug interaction trial between darunavir/ritonavir and carbamazepine, the mean 
exposure to  ritonavir  was decreased  by  49%  in  the  co-administration.  However,  this  lower  ritonavir 
exposure  did  not  influence  the  exposure  to  darunavir.  These  results  suggest  that  ritonavir  doses  of 
50 to 200 mg as pharmacokinetic enhancer result in therapeutic and comparable darunavir exposure in 
adults.  In  addition,  the  results  in  Part  I  showed  that the  dosing  in  both  groups (except for two  non-
compliers)  resulted  in  trough  concentrations  above  the  target  in  vitro  EC50,  further  justifying  the 
chosen ritonavir doses.  
The  following  2  dose  schemes  for  darunavir/ritonavir  were  administered  under  fed  conditions  for 
14 days as follows: 
Dose Group A (9-15 mg/kg darunavir and 1.5-2.5 mg/kg ritonavir): 
≥20 to <30 kg:   300/50 mg 
≥30 to <40 kg:   375/60 mg 
≥40 to <50 kg:   450/100 mg

≥30 to <40 kg:   450/60 mg  
≥40 to <50 kg:   600/100 mg

In total, 52 patients were screened, of which 44 patients were randomised and treated, 22 patients in 
each group:

The results showed that in general ritonavir plasma levels were comparable to those obtained in adults; 
however,  data  indicate  also  that  in  several  cases  lower  ritonavir  plasma  levels  were  observed 
compared to adults (this is further discussed in Part II).  
Both  dosing  schemes  (higher  and  lower  dose  groups)  resulted  in  adequate  darunavir  plasma  levels 
compared to those observed in adults. Both groups fell inside the specified criteria, i.e. mean values of 
the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  in  this  paediatric  population  should  fall  within  80  to  130%  of  the 
corresponding treatment-experienced adult pharmacokinetic plasma parameters.  
When all results of groups A and B were pooled, the mean data indicated a higher exposure for group 
B, in line with the higher administered dose. There was a considerable overlap in C0h, AUC and Cmax 
values of Groups A and B. Data for each weight band showed that all the children in groups A and B 
in  the  20-<  30  and  40-<  50  weight  bands  had  actual  trough  concentrations above  the  target  in  vitro 
EC50 value of 550 ng/ml, but in the 30-< 40 kg band this was not the case for either group A or group 
B (the range was 181-6060 ng/ml for Group A and 147-5070 for group B). Here, all patients achieved 
plasma  darunavir  concentrations  above  550  ng/ml,  except for  2  patients  (1 each  in  Group  A  and  B, 
respectively),  by  whom  the  criteria  for  compliance  were  not  met.  They  had  low  darunavir  trough 
values, and ritonavir trough levels were low as well or even not quantifiable.  
The individual observed concentration - time curves compared with adult exposure, separated for all 
dose groups (weight bands) for part A and B did not indicate that any of the two groups were at risk of 
underexposure. The dose scheme applied in group B was used for further evaluation in part II of this 
study. This was, as indicated by the Applicant, based upon favourable efficacy, safety and tolerability 
profile in this group (see also below).  
Main clinical study (Part II) 
Following selection of the dose at Week 2, all patients not already receiving this dose were switched to 
the selected dose, and the 44 patients enrolled in Part I continued the overall schedule of assessments 
up to Week 48 as per the protocol. An additional 24 patients equally distributed in the above weight 
bands were recruited directly into Part II as well as a cohort of 12 patients ≥ 50 kg who received the 
adult dose of darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg b.i.d. The 68 patients weighing between 20 and 50 kg 
received the selected dose of group B in Part I: 
Of  the  74  patients  with  sparse  sampling  data,  a  total  of  19  patients  were  included  in  the  20-29  kg 
weight band, 23 patients in the 30-39 kg weight band, 20 patients in the 40-49 kg weight band and 12 
patients in the ≥ 50 kg weight band at screening.

Based upon the sparse sampling data and using population pharmacokinetic analysis, the selected dose 
for  Part  II  for  children  resulted  in  mean  C0h  and  AUCtau  values  comparable  to  those  observed  in 
adults.  This  was  in  line  with  findings  in  Part  I.  Furthermore,  race,  sex,  region  and  effects  of  co-
administered  efavirenz  or  tenofovir  showed  no  clinically  relevant  effect  of  these  covariates  on 
darunavir exposure, consistent with findings in adults. 
The  population  PK  analysis  showed  darunavir  AUC  and  trough  concentrations  comparable  to  those 
observed  in  adults  for  all  weight  bands.  Although  for  the  30-<  40  kg  weight  band  had  some  lower 
values  compared  to  the  other  weight  bands,  the  estimated  troughs  exceeded  clearly  the  target  of 
550 ng/ml. 
In adults, linear pharmacokinetics is observed after single dose administration over the 300 – 1200 mg 
darunavir  dose  range  with  100  mg  ritonavir,  thus  for  a  wide  range  of  the  darunavir:ritonavir  ratios, 
which  still  is  sufficient  to  inhibit  darunavir  metabolism  by  ritonavir  (see  above).  As  such  the 
comparable exposure observed in children and adults support the applied darunavir/ritonavir ratios in 
children and that ritonavir sufficiently inhibits the metabolism of darunavir. 
Addition of the 75 and 150 mg tablet formulations 
A  biowaiver  was  considered  acceptable,  as  for  the  75  and  150  mg  tablet  formulations  dissolution 
studies comparing the tablets with the 300 and 600 mg tablets showed comparable results. Moreover, 
the  tablets  are  dose-proportional,  and  darunavir  with  ritonavir  shows  linear  pharmacokinetics  after 
single dose administration. 
Clinical efficacy 
Dose selection (Part I) 
Part I of study TMC114-C212 was designed to provide dose recommendations of darunavir/ritonavir 
in  HIV-1  infected  treatment-experienced  children  and  adolescents  weighing  between  20  and  50  kg 
(see  above).  The  recommended  dose  was  selected  based  on  short-term  safety,  tolerability,  antiviral 
activity  and  pharmacokinetics  on  Day  14.  As  discussed  above,  the  dose  scheme  applied  in  group  B 
was used for further evaluation in part II of this study. 
Dose Group B (11-19 mg/kg darunavir and 1.5-2.5 mg/kg ritonavir): 
≥ 20 to < 30 kg:  
≥ 30 to < 40 kg:  
≥ 40 to < 50 kg:  
375/50 mg  
450/60 mg  
600/100 mg  
darunavir/ritonavir b.i.d.

There was no indication that the virologic response in Group B was better than in Group A, thus that 
the  higher  dose  showed  favourable  efficacy  as  claimed  by  the  Applicant.  There  were  no  consistent 
differences in virological response (including the < 50 copies/ml level efficacy parameter) between the 
different weight bands during the short-term (4 Weeks) evaluation. The virological responses in both 
dose groups per kg body weight seemed to be similar in the very small number of evaluated patients. 
However,  for  more  explanation  see  below  clinical  efficacy  Week  24  and  48  data  in  support  of  the 
chosen higher dose level. 
Main clinical study (Part II) 
Part II was designed as an observational study looking at the efficacy and safety of darunavir/ritonavir 
infected  children  and  adolescents  between  6  and  
b.i.d. 
< 18 years of age. In total, 80 patients were included in this part, of who 44 were included in part I

The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  decrease  in  viral  load  (copies/ml)  ≥  1.0  log10  at  Week  24. 
Secondary endpoints included: decrease in viral load (copies/ml) ≥ 1.0 log10 at all other time points; 
decrease in viral load (copies/ml) ≥ 0.5 log10; change in log10 plasma viral load (copies/ml); change 
in CD4+ and CD8+ (absolute and %), and CD4+/CD8+ ratio. 
All patients were ARV treatment-experienced. The majority had previously used at least 1 NNRTI, at 
least  3  NRTIs,  or  at  least  2  PIs.  Only  few  had  previously  used  a  fusion  inhibitor  (FI).  Sixty-five 
percent of patients had previously used ARV drugs from 3 classes (PI + NRTI + NNRTI). Ninety-two 
percent  of  patients  had  previously  received  ritonavir,  most  likely  as  part  of  a  boosted  PI  regimen. 
Seventy  percent  of  patients  had  previously  received  lopinavir/  ritonavir;  nelfinavir  (NFV)  had  been 
used previously by 58% of patients. 
Overall,  the  baseline  characteristics,  including  resistance  associated  mutations  (RAMs),  of  these 
patients were reflective of advanced HIV infection. Most patients (66.3%) used a NRTI-based regimen 
consisting  of  NRTIs  only  (in  addition to trial treatment).  Based  on  the  Antivirogram,  in  48%  of  the 
cases the HIV was not susceptible to any or only to one ARV drug in the initial ART in addition to 
trial  treatment.  Initial  baseline  susceptibility  data  imply  that  a  more  effective  optimised  background 
therapy (OBT) could have been constructed.

Week-24 analyses showed that a small group of patients who used no sensitive ARVs in their OBT 
showed quite a high virological response, most likely mainly due to darunavir. In the other subgroups 
a  higher  number  of  sensitive  ARVs  used  in  patients’  OBT  was  associated  with  better  virological 
response in the adolescents group, as expected.  
However,  such  a  trend  was  not  seen  in  the  small  subgroups  of  younger  children.  Response  rates  in 
adolescents remained lower compared to the younger age group. This was also the case for viral load  
< 50 copies/ml parameter in the overwhelming majority of the patients with darunavir sensitive virus 
(darunavir FC < 10).  The data should be interpreted with caution as the subgroups especially in the 
young age category are too small to draw robust conclusions. 
At Week 24, 73.8% of all patients had a decrease in viral load ≥ 1 log10 and at Week 48, 65.0%. The 
highest  response  was  seen  in  Week  4  and  8.  (See  the  following  table.  Sensitivity  analysis 
demonstrated  that  results  for  virologic  response  were  robust  and  consistent  across  the  different 
imputation methods used).

The virologic response at 24 Weeks was reasonably high and in line with the relatively high virologic 
response found in (highly) treatment experienced adults. Direct comparisons to efficacy of other PIs in 
the  paediatric  patient  population  cannot  be  made,  as  different  studies  mostly  include  different 
populations  with  different  treatment  history  or  different  baseline  characteristics  and  studies  in 
paediatric patients are mostly open labelled, uncontrolled and not randomised. However, the virologic 
response  detected  in  this  trial  seems  to  be  on  the  high  end  of  what  is  found  with  other  PI  based 
regimens  in  treatment  experienced  paediatric  patients.  In  addition,  there  was  a  clear  immunological 
response with an overall shift towards higher CD4 count.

The  virological  response  data  with  respect  to  <  50  copies/ml  level  for  week  24  and  48  showed  a 
remarkable difference between adolescents and the younger children across both dose levels in favour 
of  the  younger  children,  probably  due  to  the  fact  that  the  younger  patients  were  less  experienced 
compared to the adolescents (see also below the response in relation to compliance). The higher dose 
level trended to give better results in the younger group (6-11 years of age). In contrast, the lower dose 
level gave better results in the adolescents group (12-17 years of age). 
These trends in better response to the higher dose level were also reflected in plasma viral load ≥ 1.0 
log  (TLOVR)  measurements  for  the  younger  age  group,  whereas  the  difference  between  doses  
became  less  obvious  for  the  adolescents  group for this  parameter. The  response at  week  48  became 
similar for both age  groups  at the lower  dose level whereas  the  difference in  favour  of  the  younger 
group was maintained at the higher dose level. 
For  both  virological  response  parameters  results  trended  clearly  to  show  decreasing  response  by 
weight  band  with  increasing  weight  category  especially  at  week  48  evaluation;  the  lowest  response 
seemed to be associated with the 40-49 kg weight band. The results for the > 50 kg weight band were 
better than those for the 40-49 kg weight band for the < 50 copies/ml level parameter but not for the 
plasma  viral load ≥  1.0  log  (TLOVR)  measurements; the number  of  involved  patients in the  former 
group was too small to allow a good comparison.

Overall,  the  virological  response  data  favoured  the  choice  of  the  higher  dose  level  especially  in  the 
younger  age  group,  whereas  based  on  the  plasma  viral  load  ≥  1.0  log  (TLOVR)  measurements  the 
difference between doses became less obvious for the adolescents group. The latter group was more 
pre-treated  and  the  lower  response  in  this  group  could  be  explained  at  least  partly  by  resistance  to 
darunavir which was only seen in adolescents. The observed trend showing decreasing response with 
increasing weight band category especially at Week 48 evaluation reflects the age related observations 
associated  with  increased  weight  category.  Thus  the  data  in  favour  of  the  higher  dose  are  not  fully 
conclusive; however, it is a plausible choice and can be expected to offer better coverage to contain 
the risk of resistance development in this already pre-treated group of patients.  
Of  the  80  patients  included  in  the  study  at  week  24,  22  experienced  virologic  failure  (15  were 
classified  as  “rebounders”,  7  were  “non-responders”).  Of  the  “rebounders”,  baseline  and  endpoint 
genotypic profiles were available for 13. Protease mutations emerging in over 10% of “rebounders” 
were V32I (n = 4), I54L (n = 4) and L89M (n = 2). V32I and I54L have been described as darunavir 
RAMs. It was unclear what proportion of the rebounders developed darunavir mutations, and whether 
issues related to adherence or possibly the adequacy of the dosage could have played a role in these 
cases. As requested, the Applicant provided additional analyses. The Week 48 data showed that out of 
17 rebounders, 9 (53%) developed darunavir RAMs. I54L developed in 5 patients, V32I in 4 patients, 
I50V  in  3  patients,  and  V11I,  L33F  and  I84V  in  1  patient.  As  mentioned  before,  plasma  drug 
concentration  <  550  ng/ml  was  used  to  monitor  compliance.  There  seemed  to  be  no  connection 
between the development of darunavir RAMs and measurements of compliance by darunavir plasma 
concentration  measurements  <  550  ng/ml.  The  data  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  because  the 
groups are too small to draw robust conclusions. 
Conclusions on Efficacy 
Week  24  and  48  data  on  virologic  and  immunologic  response  of  trial  TMC114-C212  demonstrated 
that  darunavir/ritonavir  offers  an  effective  treatment  option  in  treatment-experienced  HIV  infected 
paediatric patients from 6 to 18 years of age at the recommended dose regimen: 
≥20 to <30 kg:   375/50 mg  
≥30 to <40 kg:   450/60 mg  
≥40 to <50 kg:   600/100 mg

darunavir/ritonavir b.i.d. 
The virologic response defined as decrease from baseline of at least 1.0 log10 in plasma viral load was 
achieved by 65.0% of the patients, and 47.5% of patients achieved an undetectable plasma viral load 
(< 50 copies/ml) at Week 48. Virologic response defined as plasma viral load < 400 copies/ml at Week 
48 was achieved by 58.8% of the patients. These results were confirmed by sensitivity analyses. The 
virologic response at 48 Weeks is in line with the relatively high virologic response found in (highly) 
treatment experienced  adults.  In  addition, there  was  a  clear  immunological  response  with  an overall 
shift towards a higher CD4 cell count.

Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Currently  there  is  very  limited  experience  in  children  –there  is  data  from  77  HIV-infected  patients 
aged 6 to 18 years on the selected dose, in addition to data on 73 children and adolescents enrolled in 
the compassionate use programme. This is not sufficient data to make reliable comparisons to other 
patient  groups  or  treatments.  However,  the  number  of  patients  included  in  this  trial  is  reasonable 
regarding  the  type  of  application,  and  similar  as  to  other  applications  for  ARV  medicinal  products 
such as PIs for similar paediatric indications. Originally, 24 weeks data were provided. Available data 
extend now to 48 week data. The safety data for the 24 week treatment period are summarised below. 
Adverse events(AE) 
During the treatment period, 71 of the 80 patients (88.8%) reported at least one AE. Most AEs were 
grade 1 or 2 in severity. Grade 3 or 4 AEs occurred in 18 (22.5%) patients. The most common AEs 
considered at least possibly related to darunavir were abdominal pain (4 patients, 5.0%), diarrhoea (2 
patients, 2.5%), ALT increased, INR increased, LDL increased, epistaxis and rash (all in 2 patients, 
2.5%).  
Serious adverse events (SAE) and deaths 
No  deaths  occurred  during  the  24  week  period  of  trial  TMC114-C212,  SAEs  were  reported  by  9 
(11.3%) patients during the treatment period. One patient (1.3%) experienced increased ALT (grade 3) 
– this was the only SAE considered possibly related to treatment. All other SAEs were considered to 
be  not  or  doubtfully  related  to  darunavir.  One  patient  permanently  discontinued  treatment  due to an 
AE. This patient experienced grade 3 anxiety which was not considered related to trial treatment by 
the investigator. 
Laboratory findings 
The overall incidence of laboratory abnormalities was low. No clinically relevant mean changes from 
baseline were observed for any laboratory parameter. Most laboratory abnormalities were grade 1 or 2 
in severity.  Small median changes from baseline were observed for vital signs. None of the observed 
mean changes from baseline were considered clinically relevant. 
As requested, the Applicant provided a more differentiated assessment of the safety according to age, 
weight/dose  bands  and  mg/kg  administered  based  on  the  24  week  and  48  week  data.  Any  observed 
differences  remained  essentially  descriptive  and  no  conclusions  could  be  inferred  from  these 
observations. The stratification according to dose (mg/kg) was not further considered as there was no 
relevant  difference  in  exposure  between  the  2  groups.  No  new  safety  issues  related  to 
darunavir/ritonavir were identified from this additional post-hoc stratification of the Week 4 data.  
During the 48 Week treatment period, 92.5% of patients reported at least 1 AE, with the most common 
AEs  (at  least  10.0%)  being  pyrexia,  cough,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  diarrhoea,  vomiting, 
lymphadenopathy, herpes simplex, abdominal pain, pneumonia, sinusitis, tonsillitis, conjunctivitis and 
headache. Most AEs were grade 1 or 2 in severity. Twenty-one patients experienced a grade 3 or 4 
AE, of which 5 were grade 4 and none was related to treatment. No patients died during the treatment 
period. SAEs were reported in 11 patients (13.8%) during treatment. All SAEs occurred in no more 
than  1  patient  each.  One  SAE  (increased  ALT)  was  considered  at  least  possibly  related  to 
investigational medication.  
One patient permanently discontinued trial treatment due to an AE (anxiety) considered not related to 
investigational  medication  by  the  investigator.  Rash-related  events  were  reported  in  11  patients 
(13.8%).  Rash-related  events  considered  at  least  possibly  related  to  treatment  were  reported  in  2 
patients  (2.5%).  No  grade  3  or  4  rashes  occurred.  The  overall  incidence  of  GI-related  events  was 
33.8% with grade 2 as the worst severity rating. GI-related events considered at least possibly related 
to  treatment  were  reported  in  7.5%  of  patients.  Haematology-related  AEs  in  9  patients  (11.3%).  
Liver-,  cardiac-,  lipid-,  and  pancreas-related  events  were  generally  low  in  incidence  (<  10%).  The 
safety  results  in  the  48  Week  analysis  were  comparable  to  the  Week  24  results  and  no  new  safety 
findings were observed.

Conclusion on Safety 
There  is  very  limited  experience  with  Prezista  in  children  and  adolescents  –  currently  there  is  data 
from  77  HIV-infected  patients  aged  6  to  18  years  on  the  selected  dose  who  were  observed  for 
48 Weeks,  in  addition  to  data  on  73  children  and  adolescents  enrolled  in  the  compassionate  use 
programme.  There  is  not  enough  data  to  make  reliable  comparisons  to  other  patient  groups  or 
treatments.  
The most common AEs occurring in more than 10.0% of patients during treatment were reminiscent of 
those  in  adult  patients  and  included  cough,  diarrhoea,  pyrexia,  vomiting,  and  abdominal  pain.  The 
majority of AEs were grade 1 or 2 in severity. Grade 3 or 4 events were reported in 21 patients and 
were  mostly  not  considered  related  to  trial  treatment.  No  patient  died  up  to  the  cut  off  point  (48 
Weeks) and 11 patients (13.8%) reported a SAE. Only one patient permanently discontinued treatment 
due  to  an  AE.  This  patient  experienced  grade  3  anxiety  which  was  not  considered  related  to  trial 
treatment  by  the  investigator.  The  adverse  reactions  seen  are  similar  to  what  has  been  observed  for 
Prezista up until now, and no new safety concerns emerged from the current study. 
Compliance 
The  Applicant  analysed  compliance  at  Week  48  using  3  different  methods:  the  adherence 
questionnaire from PENTA, sparse sampling of darunavir plasma concentrations and pill count.  
An  overview  of  the  virologic  response  (viral  load  <  50  copies/ml)  at  Week  48  in  relation  to 
compliance  as  assessed  by  the  adherence  questionnaire  showed  a  difference  in  response  between 
compliant  and  noncompliant  patients  of  overall  approximately  7%,  which  illustrated  that  the 
questionnaire was not a sensitive method to measure compliance. 
Darunavir plasma concentrations were measured. Patients were considered noncompliant if they had 
darunavir plasma concentrations < 550 ng/ml on any sparse sampling during the trial. A comparison of 
the  virologic  response  (viral  load  <  50  copies/ml)  at  Week  48  in  relation  to  compliance  based  on 
sparse  sampling  showed in  both  age  groups  that  compliant  patients  (as  defined by  sparse  sampling) 
had a response rate that was at least 40% higher compared to noncompliant patients. 
Compliance was assessed via pill count and calculated as: (the actual amount taken / the amount to be 
taken) x 100%. The actual amount taken was calculated as: the number of pills dispensed – the number 
of pills returned. The amount to be taken was calculated as: the number of days since last dispensing x 
the  number  of  pills  to  be  taken  per  day.  Based  on  this  method,  28  patients  were  considered 
noncompliant,  4  (16.7%)  of  younger  children  and  24  (42.9%)  of  adolescents.  A  comparison  of  the 
virologic response (viral load < 50 copies/ml) at Week 48 in relation to compliance as assessed by pill 
count  showed  compliant  patients  to  have  a  response  rate  that  was  18%  higher  compared  to 
noncompliant patients. 
None  of  the  3  methods  to measure  compliance  was  completely  reliable,  but  sparse  pharmacokinetic 
sampling  seemed  to  be  the  most  effective  measurement,  as  this  was  most  strongly  correlated  with 
virological  outcome.  Notwithstanding  the  disadvantages  of  the  different  methods,  the  data 
demonstrated that compliance was more problematic in adolescents (than in younger children). More 
frequent sampling should be encouraged in future trials not only for pharmacokinetic reasons but also 
in the light of acquiring adherence data.

5. 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  Applicant  has  provided  documents  that  set  out  a  detailed  description  of  the  system  of 
pharmacovigilance  (DDPS).  A  statement  signed  by  the  Applicant  and  the  qualified  person  for 
pharmacovigilance, indicating that the Applicant has the services of a qualified person responsible for 
pharmacovigilance  and  the  necessary  means  for  the  notification  of  any  adverse  reaction  occurring 
either in the Community or in a third country has been provided.  
The  CHMP  considers  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  Applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements and provides adequate evidence that the Applicant has the services of a qualified person 
responsible  for  pharmacovigilance  and  has  the  necessary  means  for  the  notification  of  any  adverse 
reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country. 
Risk Management plan 
The Applicant provided an updated risk management plan (RMP), version 8.0, dated 9 February 2009, 
with amendments regarding the indication for children. A clear overview of the changes was provided. 
Earlier  versions  of  the  RMP  were  already  assessed  and  found  to  be  sufficient.  Only  the  current 
amendments are discussed in this report. 
Safety Specification 
The following changes were made: 
As requested by the CHMP, tables on dose by gender, and age by dose and by gender were added to 
the updated RMP. 
• 
Section 1.3.1: Populations not studied: 
New text: ‘The Phase II trial TMC114-C212 is ongoing to investigate the long-term (up to 48 weeks) 
safety  and  tolerability  of  darunavir/ritonavir  in  treatment-experienced,  HIV-1  infected  paediatric 
patients aged from 6-17 years (n=80). This trial is discussed in the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) 
together with other planned studies in the paediatric population from 3 years of age and above.’ 
In response to CHMP questions, the Applicant added exposure data regarding the paediatric patients in 
the appropriate sections of the RMP, including compassionate use. The Applicant also addressed the 
missing data in children in the appropriate sections of the RMP.  
• 
Section 1.4.3: Regulatory action taken: 
The  Applicant  added  some  regulatory  actions  taken  since  the  last  version  of  the  RMP.  This  was 
agreed. 
• 
Section 1.5: Adverse events/adverse reactions: 
The following  was  added  in  section  1.5.1:  ‘SOC  General  disorders  and  administration  site reaction\ 
General Signs and Symptoms\Selected PT: Fat tissue increased.’ The CHMP agreed to his addition. 
Furthermore, section 1.5 was divided in two parts: adults and children. The following children section 
was added: 
“Paediatric population: 
The safety data of the phase II trial TMC114-C212 is used as primary safety dataset. When relevant, 
additional  safety  data  obtained  up  to  29  February  2008,  from  the  following  trials  and  programs,  are 
discussed: 
-  The  ongoing  trial  TMC114-C212  after  the  cut-off  date  for  the  24-weeks  analysis  (29  August 
2007). 
-  The  Compassionate  Use  Program  (or  exceptionally  in  the  Expanded  Access  or  Named  Patient 
programs).  In  these  Programs,  73  HIV-1  infected  treatment  experienced  paediatric  patients 
received  treatment  with  darunavir/ritonavir  as  they  had  no  treatment  options  due  to  virologic 
failure, or intolerance to multiple ARV regimens.”

In 1.5.2 the identified and potential risks were presented separately for children.  
As requested by the CHMP, in the updated RMP, development of drug resistance was re-graded from 
potential risk to identified risk, and the potential for off-label paediatric use in treatment naïve patients 
was included in section 1.9.5. 
As the current data on children are too scarce to clearly identify all risks and upcoming new data will 
provide more information, the CHMP requested the Applicant to closely monitor all AEs and identify 
all possible new risks, also referring to the decision on the PIP 000038-PIP01-07 of the EMEA. The 
Applicant committed to closely monitor new safety data in specific paediatric trials and to stratify the 
data according to age groups. 
Evaluation of the need for risk minimisation measures 
It  was  agreed  that  the  results  of  study  TMC114-C212  do  not  indicate  a  different  safety  profile  for 
children as compared with adults. However, this is based on very few data: only 24 children in the age 
of 6-12 years, and 56 in the age of 12-18 years. Therefore, properly estimated frequencies can not yet 
be added. The AEs in children have to be closely monitored and stratified in the age groups 6-12 and 
12-18. On request of the CHMP, the Applicant committed to propose a long term study protocol using 
the PENTA registry. The draft protocol will be submitted to the CHMP for review (see also Letter of 
Undertaking).

6.  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The  Quality  data presented  within this  extension  application  are  considered  satisfactory  and support 
the addition of the 75 mg and 150 mg strengths. 
Efficacy and Safety 
Benefits  
The  biowaiver  for  the  75  and  150  mg  tablet  and  the  selected  darunavir/ritonavir  dose  regimen  for 
children were adequately justified.  
Week  24  and  48  data  on  virologic  and  immunologic  response  of  trial  TMC114-C212  demonstrated 
that  darunavir/ritonavir  offers  an  effective  treatment  option  in  treatment-experienced  HIV  infected 
paediatric  patients  from  6  to  18  years  of  age  at  the  recommended  dose  regimen.  The  virologic 
response defined as decrease from baseline of at least 1.0 log10 in plasma viral load was achieved by 
65.0%  of  the  patients,  and  47.5%  of  patients  achieved  an  undetectable  plasma  viral  load  (<  50 
copies/ml) at Week 48. Virologic response defined as plasma viral load < 400 copies/ml at Week 48 
was  achieved  by  58.8%  of  the  patients.  These  results  were  confirmed  by  sensitivity  analyses.  The 
virologic response at 48 Weeks is in line with the relatively high virologic response found in (highly) 
treatment experienced  adults.  In  addition, there  was  a  clear  immunological  response  with  an overall 
shift towards a higher CD4 cell count. 
Additional analyses with regards to virological efficacy data by weight band, mg/kg dose, and age to 
further  justify  the  appropriateness  of  the  selected  regimens  on  the  bases  of  week  24  and  week  48 
results  in  ART-experienced  children  favoured  the  choice  of  the  higher  dose  level,  especially  in  the 
younger age group. The adolescents group was more pre-treated and the lower response in this group 
could be explained at least partly by resistance to darunavir which was only seen in adolescents. The 
observed trend showing decreasing response with increasing weight band category especially at Week 
48  evaluation  reflects  the  age  related  observations  associated  with  increased  weight  category.  The 
evidence in favour of the efficaciousness of the higher dose was considered sufficient; although based 
on  the  limited  paediatric  data  it  was  deemed  acceptable  in  the  light  of  the  established  efficacy  of 
darunavir/ritonavir in (heavily) pre-treated HIV infected adult patients.  
Risks  
There is limited experience with Prezista in children and adolescents – currently there is data from 75 
HIV-infected  patients  aged  6  to  18  years  on  the  selected  dose  who  were  observed  for  48  weeks,  in 
addition to data on 73 children and adolescents enrolled in the compassionate use programme. There is 
not  enough  data  to  make  reliable  comparisons  to  other  patient  groups  or  treatments.  However,  the 
number of patients included in this trial was reasonable regarding the type of application, and similar 
as to other applications for anti retroviral drugs for treatment-naïve patients.  
The most common AEs occurring in more than 10% of patients during treatment were comparable of 
those  in  adult  patients  and  included  cough,  diarrhoea,  pyrexia,  vomiting,  and  abdominal  pain.  The 
majority of AEs were grade 1 or 2 in severity. Grade 3 or 4 events were reported in 18 patients and 
were mostly not considered related to trial treatment. No patient died up to the cut off point (24 weeks) 
and 9 patients (11.3%) reported a SAE. One patient permanently discontinued treatment due to an AE. 
This  patient  experienced  grade  3  anxiety  which  was  not  considered  related  to  trial  treatment  by  the 
investigator.  The  adverse  reactions  seen  are  similar  to  what  has  been  observed  for  Prezista  up  until 
now, no new safety concerns emerged from the current study.  
During the 24 week study period, 22 patients out of 80 patients experienced virological failure; 15 of 
these  were  rebounders.  It  was  unclear  what  proportion  of  the  rebounders  developed  darunavir 
mutations, and whether issues related to adherence or possibly the adequacy of the dosage could have 
played a role in these cases. 
19/20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  most  relevant  measurement  of  compliance  –considered  to  be  an  extremely  important  aspect, 
especially  in  adolescents  -  was  based  on  sparse  pharmacokinetic  sampling;  it  was  most  strongly 
correlated  with  virological  outcome.  Here,  more  frequent  sampling  should  be  encouraged  in  future 
trials  not  only  for  pharmacokinetic  reasons  but  also  in  the  light  of  acquiring  adherence  data. 
Furthermore,  the  highest  pill  burden  was  in  the  youngest  age  group  (because  they  are  not  able  to 
swallow the large tablets) yet they showed the highest virological response. This was explained by the 
fact that they are also the least pre-treated group. Children using the large tablets with less pill burden 
did  not  show  better  virological  response.  The  pill-burden  effect  within  an  age  category  was  not 
assessed.  
Finally, the presented data suggested no connection between the development of darunavir RAMs and 
measurements of compliance by the darunavir plasma concentration measurement < 550 ng/ml. The 
data should be interpreted with caution because the groups are too small to draw robust conclusions. In 
conclusion,  the  issue  of  resistance  development  should  be  monitored  like  for  the  adult  patients  and 
resistance to darunavir in paediatric patients should be reported in the general evaluations of resistance 
to  darunavir  in  the  regular  Periodic  Safety  Update  Reports  (PSURs)  for  Prezista  (see  also  Letter  of 
Undertaking).  
Benefit-Risk Assessment 
Week 24 and 48 data on virologic and immunologic response of trial TMC114-C212 demonstrate that 
darunavir/ritonavir  offers  an  effective  treatment  option  in  treatment-experienced  HIV  infected 
paediatric patients from 6 to 18 years of age at the recommended dose regimen. Safety data up to 48 
weeks  of  treatment  did  not  reveal  new  safety  issues.  Also,  the  adverse  reactions  observed  were 
comparable to those observed in adult patients. Nevertheless, there is only limited data in paediatric 
patients.  Here,  the  Applicant  committed  to  monitor  the  safety  of  Prezista  including  HIV  resistance 
development in children and to report these issues in the regular PSURs for Prezista. Also, on request 
of  the  CHMP,  the  Applicant  committed  to  propose  a  long  term  study  protocol  using  the  PENTA 
registry.  
Given the agreed Pharmacovigilance measures, the CHMP concluded that the new strengths Prezista 
75 mg and 150 mg, co-administered with low dose ritonavir, can be used safely and efficaciously in 
the targeted ART- experienced paediatric population.  
The final agreed wording for the indication is as follows: 
“Prezista,  co  administered  with  low  dose  ritonavir  is  indicated  in  combination  with  other 
antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 1) infection 
in  antiretroviral  treatment  (ART)  experienced  adult  patients,  including  those  that  have  been  highly 
pre-treated, and for the treatment of HIV 1 infection in ART experienced children and adolescents 
from the age of 6 years and at least 20 kg body weight.” 
Recommendation  
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Prezista  75  mg  and  150  mg  film-coated  tablets,  co-
administered  with  100  mg  ritonavir  in  combination  with  other  ARV  medicinal  products  in  the 
treatment  of  HIV-1  infection  in  ARV  treatment  of  ARV  experienced  HIV-1  infected  paediatric 
patients aged 6 to 18 years was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the MA.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
PecFent is indicated for the management of breakthrough pain (BTP) in adults who are already 
receiving maintenance opioid therapy for chronic cancer pain. Breakthrough pain is a transitory 
exacerbation of pain that occurs on a background of otherwise controlled persistent pain. 
Patients receiving maintenance opioid therapy are those who are taking at least 60 mg of oral 
morphine daily, at least 25 micrograms of transdermal fentanyl per hour, at least 30 mg of oxycodone 
daily, at least 8 mg of oral hydromorphone daily or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for a week 
or longer. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated by and remain under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
management of opioid therapy in cancer patients. Physicians should keep in mind the potential for 
abuse of fentanyl.

Posology 
PecFent should be titrated to an “effective” dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimises 
adverse reactions without causing undue (or intolerable) adverse reactions, for two consecutively 
treated episodes of BTP. The efficacy of a given dose should be assessed over the ensuing 30 minute 
period.  
Patients should be carefully monitored until an effective dose is reached. 
PecFent is available in two strengths: 100 micrograms/spray and 400 micrograms/spray. 
One dose of PecFent may include administration of 1 spray (100 microgram or 400 microgram doses) 
or 2 sprays (200 microgram or 800 microgram doses) of the same strength (either 100 microgram or 
400 microgram strength).   
Patients should not  use more than 4 doses per day. Patients should wait at least 4 hours after a dose 
before treating another BTP episode with PecFent. 
PecFent can deliver 100, 200, 400 and 800 microgram doses as follows:

Initial dose 
• 
Method of titration 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The initial dose of PecFent to treat episodes of BTP is always 100 micrograms (one spray), even 
in patients switching from other fentanyl containing products for their BTP. 
Patients must wait at least 4 hours before treating another episode of BTP with PecFent. 
Patients should be prescribed an initial titration supply of one bottle (2 sprays or 8 sprays) of 
PecFent 100 micrograms/spray. 
Patients whose initial dose is 100 micrograms and who need to titrate to a higher dose due to a 
lack of effect can be instructed to use two 100 microgram sprays (one in each nostril) for their 
next BTP episode. If this dose is not successful, the patient may be prescribed a bottle of 
PecFent 400 micrograms/spray and instructed to change to one 400 microgram spray for their 
next episode of pain. If this dose is not successful, the patient may be instructed to increase to 
two 400 microgram sprays (one in each nostril). 
From treatment initiation, patients should be closely followed and the dose titrated until an 
effective dose is reached and confirmed for two consecutively treated episodes of BTP.  
Titration in patients switching between immediate-release fentanyl containing products  
Substantial differences may exist in the pharmacokinetic profile of immediate-release fentanyl 
medicinal products, which result in clinically important differences in the rate and extent of absorption 
of fentanyl.  Therefore, when switching between fentanyl containing medicinal products indicated for 
treatment of breakthrough pain, including intranasal formulations, it is essential that patients are again 
titrated with the new medicinal product, and not switched on a dose-for-dose (microgram-for-
microgram) basis. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Maintenance therapy 
Once an effective dose has been established during titration, patients should continue to take this dose 
up to a maximum of 4 doses per day.  
Dose readjustment 
Generally, the maintenance dose of PecFent should be increased only where the current dose fails to 
adequately treat the BTP for several consecutive episodes. 
A review of the dose of the background opioid therapy may be required if patients consistently present 
with more than four BTP episodes per 24 hours. 
In  absence  of  adequate  pain  control,  the  possibility  of  hyperalgesia,  tolerance  and  progression  of 
underlying disease should be considered (see section 4.4). 
If adverse reactions are intolerable or persistent, the dose should be reduced or treatment with PecFent 
replaced by another analgesic. 
Discontinuation of therapy 
PecFent should be discontinued immediately if the patient no longer experiences breakthrough pain 
episodes. The treatment for persistent backgound pain should be kept as prescribed. 
If discontinuation of all opioid therapy is required, the patient must be closely followed by the doctor 
as gradual downward opioid titration therapy is necessary in order to avoid the possibility of abrupt 
withdrawal effects.   
Special populations 
Elderly (older than 65 years) 
In the PecFent clinical trial programme, 104 (26.1%) of patients were over 60 years of age, 67 (16.8%) 
over 65 years and 15 (3.8%) over 75 years.  There was no indication that older patients tended to 
titrate to lower doses or experience more adverse reactions. Nevertheless, in view of the importance of 
renal and hepatic function in the metabolism and clearance of fentanyl, additional care should be 
exercised in the use of PecFent in the elderly. No data on the pharmacokinetics of PecFent in elderly 
patients are available.   
Hepatic or renal impairment 
PecFent should be administered with caution to patients with moderate or severe hepatic or renal 
impairment (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of PecFent in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been 
established.  
No data are available.  
Method of administration 
PecFent is for  nasal  use only. 
The bottle should be removed from the child resistant container immediately prior to use and the 
protective cap removed. The bottle must be primed before first use by holding upright and simply 
pressing and releasing the finger grips either side of the nozzle until a green bar appears in the 
counting window (should occur after four sprays).  
2 spray bottle: 
The 2 spray bottle cannot be re-primed and once both doses are used, or if longer than 5 days since 
priming, the bottle and contents should be discarded as described in section 6.6. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 spray bottle: 
If the product has not been used for 5 days, it should be re-primed by spraying once.   
The patient should be advised to write the date of first use in the space provided on the label of the 
child resistant container. 
To administer PecFent the nozzle is placed a short distance (about 1 cm) into the nostril and pointed 
slightly towards the bridge of the nose. A spray is then administered by pressing and releasing the 
finger grips either side of the nozzle. An audible click will be heard and the number displayed on the 
counter will advance by one.   
Patients must be advised that they may not feel the spray being administered, and that they should, 
therefore, rely on the audible click and the number on the counter advancing to confirm that a spray 
has been delivered.  
The PecFent spray droplets form a gel in the nose. Patients should be advised not to blow their nose 
immediately after PecFent administration.  
The protective cap should be replaced after each use and the bottle returned to the child resistant 
container for safe storage. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Patients without maintenance opioid therapy as there is an increased risk of respiratory depression. 
Severe respiratory depression or severe obstructive lung conditions. 
Treatment of acute pain other than breakthrough pain. 
Patients being treated with medicinal products containing sodium oxybate. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Patients and their carers must be instructed that PecFent contains an active substance in an amount that 
can be fatal to a child. 
In order to minimise the risks of opioid-related adverse reactions and to identify the effective dose, it 
is imperative that patients be monitored closely by health professionals during the titration process. 
It is important that the long acting opioid treatment used to treat the patient’s persistent pain has been 
stabilised before PecFent therapy begins. 
Hyperalgesia 
As with other opioids, in case of insufficient pain control in response to an increased dose of fentanyl, 
the  possibility  of  opioid-induced  hyperalgesia  should  be  considered.  A  fentanyl  dose  reduction  or 
discontinuation of fentanyl treatment or treatment review may be indicated. 
Respiratory depression 
There is a risk of clinically significant respiratory depression associated with the use of fentanyl. 
Patients with pain who receive chronic opioid therapy develop tolerance to respiratory depression and 
hence the risk of respiratory depression in these patients is reduced. The use of concomitant central 
nervous system depressants may increase the risk of respiratory depression (see section 4.5). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Chronic pulmonary disease 
In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, fentanyl may cause more serious adverse 
reactions. In these patients, opioids may decrease respiratory drive and increase airway resistance. 
Increased intracranial pressure 
PecFent should only be administered with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly 
susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased 
intracranial pressure or impaired consciousness. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients 
with a head injury and should be used only if clinically warranted. 
Cardiac disease 
Fentanyl may produce bradycardia. PecFent should, therefore, be used with caution in patients with 
previous or pre-existing bradyarrhythmias. 
Impaired hepatic or renal function 
In addition, PecFent should be administered with caution to patients with hepatic or renal impairment. 
The influence of hepatic and renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of the medicinal product has 
not been evaluated; however, when administered intravenously the clearance of fentanyl has been 
shown to be altered in hepatic and renal impairment due to alterations in metabolic clearance and 
plasma proteins. Therefore, special care should be taken during the titration process in patients with 
moderate or severe hepatic or renal impairment. 
Careful consideration should be given to patients with hypovolaemia and hypotension. 
Opioid Use Disorder (abuse and dependence) 
Tolerance and physical and/or psychological dependence may develop upon repeated administration 
of opioids such as fentanyl. However, iatrogenic addiction following therapeutic use of opioids is 
known to occur. 
Repeated use of PecFent may lead to Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). Abuse or intentional misuse of 
PecFent may result in overdose and/or death. The risk of developing OUD is increased in patients with 
a personal or a family history (parents or siblings) of substance use disorders (including alcohol use 
disorder), in current tobacco users or in patients with a personal history of other mental health 
disorders (e.g. major depression, anxiety and personality disorders). 
Patients will require monitoring for signs of drug-seeking behavior (e.g. too early requests for refills). 
This includes the review of concomitant opioids and psycho-active drugs (like benzodiazepines). For 
patients with signs and symptoms of OUD, consultation with an addiction specialist should be 
considered. 
Athletes should be informed that treatment with fentanyl could lead to positive doping tests. 
Serotonin Syndrome 
Caution is advised when PecFent is coadministered with medicinal products that affect the 
serotoninergic neurotransmitter systems. 
The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome may occur with the concomitant 
use of serotonergic medicinal products such as Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and 
Serotonin Norepinephrine Re-uptake Inhibitors (SNRIs), and with medicinal products which impair 
metabolism of serotonin (including Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors [MAOIs]). This may occur within 
the recommended dose (see section 4.5). 
Serotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), 
autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular 
abnormalities (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If serotonin syndrome is suspected, treatment with PecFent should be discontinued. 
Route of administration 
PecFent is only intended for nasal use, and must not be administered by any other route.  Due to 
physico-chemical properties of excipients included in the formulation, intravenous or intra-arterial 
injection must be avoided in particular. 
Nasal conditions 
If the patient experiences recurrent episodes of epistaxis or nasal discomfort while taking PecFent, an 
alternative method of administration for treatment of breakthrough pain should be considered. 
Sleep-related breathing disorders 
Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnoea (CSA) and 
sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients 
who present with CSA, consider decreasing the total opioid dosage. 
Concomitant use with sedatives 
Concomitant use of PecFent and sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or related drugs 
may result in sedation, respiratory depression, coma and death. Because of these risks, concomitant 
prescribing with these sedative medicines should be reserved for patients for whom alternative 
treatment options are not possible. If a decision is made to prescribe PecFent concomitantly 
with sedative medicines, the lowest effective dose should be used, and the duration of treatment 
should be as short as possible. 
The patients should be followed closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and 
sedation. 
In this respect, it is strongly recommended to inform patients and their caregivers to be aware of these 
symptoms (see section 4.5). 
PecFent excipients 
PecFent contains propylparahydroxybenzoate (E216). Propylparahydroxybenzoate  may cause allergic 
reactions (possibly delayed) and, exceptionally, bronchospasm (if the medicinal product is not 
correctly administered). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Concomitant use of medicinal products containing sodium oxybate and fentanyl is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3). The treatment of sodium oxybate should be discontinued before start of treatment with 
PecFent. 
Fentanyl is metabolised mainly via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme system (CYP3A4), 
therefore potential interactions may occur when PecFent is given concurrently with  medicinal 
products that affect CYP3A4 activity. Coadministration with medicinal products that induce 3A4 
activity may reduce the efficacy of PecFent. The concomitant use of PecFent with strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, and nelfinavir) 
or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, 
fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, and verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma 
concentrations, potentially causing serious adverse drug reactions including fatal respiratory 
depression. Patients receiving PecFent concomitantly with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
should be carefully monitored for an extended period of time. Dose increase should be undertaken 
with caution. 
The concomitant use of other central nervous system depressants, including other opioids, sedatives or 
hypnotics, general anaesthetics, phenothiazines, tranquillisers, skeletal muscle relaxants, 
gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) sedating antihistamines and alcohol may produce additive 
depressant effects. Concomitant use of opioids with sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
related drugs increases the risk of sedation, respiratory depression, coma and death because of additive 
CNS depressant effect. The lowest effective dose of sedative medicines should be used and duration of 
concomitant use should be limited (see section 4.4). 
Serotoninergic medicinal products: 
Coadministration of fentanyl with a serotoninergic medicinal product, such as a Selective Serotonin 
Re-uptake Inhibitor (SSRI) or a Serotonin Norepinephrine Re-uptake Inhibitor (SNRI) or a 
Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI), may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially 
life-threatening condition. 
PecFent is not recommended for use in patients who have received monoamine oxidase (MAO) 
inhibitors within the previous 14 days because severe and unpredictable potentiation by MAO 
inhibitors has been reported with opioid analgesics. 
The concomitant use of partial opioid agonists/antagonists (e.g. buprenorphine, nalbuphine, 
pentazocine) is not recommended. They have high affinity to opioid receptors with relatively low 
intrinsic activity and, therefore, partially antagonise the analgesic effect of fentanyl and may induce 
withdrawal symptoms in opioid dependent patients. 
Concomitant use of nasally administered oxymetazoline has been shown to decrease the absorption of 
PecFent (see section 5.2). The concomitant use of nasally administered vasoconstrictive decongestants 
during titration is, therefore, not recommended as this may lead to patients titrating to a dose that is 
higher than required. PecFent maintenance treatment may also be less effective in patients with rhinitis 
when administered concomitantly with a nasal vasoconstrictive decongestant. If this occurs, patients 
should be advised to discontinue their decongestant. 
Concomitant use of PecFent and other medicinal products (other than oxymetazoline) administered via 
the nose has not been evaluated in the clinical trials. Other nasally administered treatments should be 
avoided within 15 minutes of dosing with PecFent. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy  
There are no adequate data from the use of fentanyl in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. PecFent 
should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
Following long-term treatment, fentanyl may cause withdrawal in the new-born infant. It is advised 
not to use fentanyl during labour and delivery (including caesarean section) because fentanyl passes 
through the placenta and may cause respiratory depression in the foetus. If PecFent is administered, an 
antidote for the child should be readily available. 
Breastfeeding 
Fentanyl passes into breast milk and may cause sedation and respiratory depression in the breast-fed 
child. Fentanyl should not be used by breastfeeding women and breast-feeding should not be restarted 
until at least 5 days after the last administration of fentanyl. 
Fertility 
There are no clinical data on the effects of fentanyl on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Opioid analgesics may impair the mental and/or physical ability required for driving or operating 
machinery.  
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery if they experience somnolence, dizziness, 
or visual disturbance or other adverse reactions which can impair their ability to drive or operate 
machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Typical opioid adverse reactions are to be expected with PecFent. Frequently, these will cease or 
decrease in intensity with continued use of the medicinal product, as the patient is titrated to the most 
appropriate dose. However, the most serious adverse reactions are respiratory depression (potentially 
leading to apnoea or respiratory arrest), circulatory depression, hypotension and shock and all patients 
should be monitored for these. 
The clinical studies of PecFent were designed to evaluate safety and efficacy in treating BTP and all 
patients were also on background opioid therapies, such as sustained-release morphine or transdermal 
fentanyl, for their persistent pain. Therefore it is not possible to definitively separate the effects of 
PecFent alone. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following adverse reactions have been reported with PecFent and/or other fentanyl-containing 
compounds during clinical studies and post marketing experience (frequencies defined as very

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Opioid withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anxiety, chills, tremor, and 
sweating have been observed with transmucosal fentanyl. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The symptoms of fentanyl overdose via the nasal route are expected to be similar in nature to those of 
intravenous fentanyl and other opioids, and are an extension of its pharmacological actions, with the 
most serious significant effect being respiratory depression. Coma is also known to occur. 
Immediate management of opioid overdose includes ensuring a patent airway, physical and verbal 
stimulation of the patient, assessment of the level of consciousness, ventilatory and circulatory status, 
and assisted ventilation (ventilatory support) if necessary. 
For treatment of overdose (accidental ingestion) in the opioid-naïve person, intravenous access should 
be obtained and naloxone or other opioid antagonists should be employed as clinically indicated. The 
duration of respiratory depression following overdose may be longer than the effects of the opioid 
antagonist’s action (e.g. the half life of naloxone ranges from 30 to 81 minutes) and repeated 
administration may be necessary. For details about such use the Summary of Product Characteristics 
of the individual opioid antagonist should be consulted. 
For treatment of overdose in opioid-maintained patients, intravenous access should be obtained. The 
judicious use of naloxone or another opioid antagonist may be warranted in some instances, but it is 
associated with the risk of precipitating an acute withdrawal syndrome. 
It should be noted that although statistically significant increases in Cmax levels were seen following a 
second dose of PecFent given either one or two hours after the initial dose, this increase is not 
considered to be large enough to suggest that clinically concerning accumulation or over-exposure 
would occur, providing a wide safety margin for the recommended dose interval of four hours. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Although muscle rigidity interfering with respiration has not been seen following the use of PecFent, 
this is possible with fentanyl and other opioids. If it occurs, it should be managed by the use of 
assisted ventilation, by an opioid antagonist, and as a final alternative, by a neuromuscular blocking 
agent. 
Cases of Cheyne Stokes respiration have been observed in case of fentanyl overdose, particularly in 
patients with history of heart failure.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Analgesics; opioids; phenylpiperidine derivatives;  
ATC code: N02AB03. 
Mechanism of action 
Fentanyl is an opioid analgesic, interacting predominantly with the opioid µ-receptor. Its primary 
therapeutic actions are analgesia and sedation. Secondary pharmacological effects are respiratory 
depression, bradycardia, hypothermia, constipation, miosis, physical dependence and euphoria. 
Opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal or –gonadal axes. Some changes that can be 
seen include an increase in serum prolactin, and decreases in plasma cortisol and testosterone. Clinical 
signs and symptoms may be manifest from these hormonal changes. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled crossover study has been conducted in which 114 
patients who experienced on average 1 to 4 episodes of break through pain (BTP) per day while taking 
maintenance opioid therapy were entered into an initial open-label titration phase in order to identify 
an effective dose of PecFent (Study CP043). The patients entering the double-blind phase treated up to 
10 episodes of BTP with either PecFent (7 episodes) or placebo (3 episodes) in a random order. 
Of the patients entering the titration phase, only 7 (6.1 %) were unable to be titrated to an effective 
dose due to lack of efficacy and 6 (5.3 %) withdrew due to adverse events. 
The primary endpoint was the comparison between the summed pain intensity difference at 30 minutes 
after dosing (SPID30), which was 6.57 in the PecFent-treated episodes compared to 4.45 for placebo 
(p<0.0001 ). The SPID for PecFent-treated episodes was also significantly different to placebo at 10 
15, 45 and 60 minutes after administration. 
The mean pain intensity scores (73 patients) for all PecFent-treated episodes (459 episodes) compared 
to those treated with placebo (200 episodes) were significantly lower at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 and 
60 minutes following administration (see Figure 1).

The superior efficacy of PecFent over placebo was supported by data from secondary endpoints 
including the number of BTP episodes with clinically meaningful pain relief, defined as a reduction in 
pain intensity score of at least 2 (Figure 2).

In a double-blind, randomized comparator-controlled study (Study 044) of similar design to Study 043 
conducted in opioid-tolerant patients with breakthrough cancer pain on stable doses of regularly 
scheduled opioids, PecFent was shown to be superior to immediate-release morphine sulfate (IRMS). 
Superiority was demonstrated by the primary endpoint, Pain Intensity Difference within 15 minutes, 
which was 3.02 in patients treated with PecFent compared to 2.69 in patients treated with IRMS 
(p=0.0396). 
In a long-term, open-label, safety study (Study 045), 355 patients entered the 16-week treatment 
phase, during which 42,227 episodes of breakthrough cancer pain (BTP) were treated with PecFent. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
One hundred of these patients continued treatment for up to 26 months in an extension phase. Of the 
355 patients treated in the open-label treatment phase, 90 % required no increase in dose.   
In the randomised, placebo-controlled study (CP043) 9.4% of 459 PecFent-treated BTP episodes in 73 
patients required use of any further (rescue) medicinal products within 60 minutes of dosing.  During 
the longer-term, open-label study (CP045) this was 6.0 % of 42,227 episodes in 355 patients treated 
with PecFent during up to 159 days of treatment. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
General introduction 
Fentanyl is highly lipophilic and can be absorbed very rapidly through the nasal mucosa and more 
slowly by the gastrointestinal route. It is subject to first pass hepatic and intestinal metabolism and the 
metabolites do not contribute to fentanyl’s therapeutic effects. 
PecFent utilises the PecSys nasal drug delivery system to modulate the delivery and absorption of 
fentanyl. The PecSys system allows the product to be sprayed into the front area of the nasal cavity as 
a fine mist of droplets, which gel on contact with the calcium ions present in the nasal mucosa. 
Fentanyl diffuses from the gel and is absorbed through the nasal mucosa; this gel-modulated 
absorption of fentanyl restrains the peak in plasma concentration (Cmax) whilst allowing the attainment 
of an early time to that peak (Tmax). 
Absorption 
In a pharmacokinetic study comparing PecFent (100, 200, 400 and 800 micrograms) with oral 
transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC, 200 micrograms), fentanyl was shown to be rapidly absorbed 
following single dose intranasal administration of PecFent, with median Tmax ranging from 15 to 
21 minutes (Tmax for OTFC was approximately 90 minutes). The variability of the pharmacokinetics of 
fentanyl was considerable following treatment with both PecFent and OTFC. Relative bioavailability 
of fentanyl from the PecFent treatment compared to the 200 microgram OTFC was approximately 
120 %. 
The main pharmacokinetic parameters are shown in the following table.

The curves for each dose level are similar in shape with increasing dose levels producing increasing 
plasma fentanyl levels. Dose-proportionality was demonstrated for Cmax and area under the curve 
(AUC) in the dose range 100 micrograms to 800 micrograms (see Figure 3). If switching to PecFent 
from another fentanyl product for BTP, independent dose titration with PecFent is required as the 
bioavailability between products differs significantly.

Time (hours)
A pharmacokinetic study was conducted to evaluate the absorption and tolerability of a single dose of 
PecFent in patients with pollen-induced seasonal allergic rhinitis, comparing the un-challenged, 
acutely challenged (rhinitic) and acutely challenged and then treated with oxymetazoline, states. 
There was no clinically significant effect of acute rhinitis on Cmax, Tmax or overall exposure to fentanyl, 
comparing the unchallenged with the acutely challenged states. Following treatment of the acute 
rhinitic state with oxymetazoline, there were reductions in Cmax and exposure, and increases in Tmax 
that were statistically, and possibly clinically, significant. 
Distribution 
Fentanyl is highly lipophilic and is well distributed beyond the vascular system, with a large apparent 
volume of distribution. Animal data have shown that, following absorption, fentanyl is rapidly 
distributed to the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys and spleen followed by a slower redistribution to muscles 
and fat. 
The plasma protein binding of fentanyl is 80 – 85 %. The main binding protein is alpha-1-acid 
glycoprotein, but both albumin and lipoproteins contribute to some extent. The free fraction of 
fentanyl increases with acidosis. 
Biotransformation 
The metabolic pathways following nasal administration of PecFent have not been characterised in 
clinical studies. Fentanyl is metabolised in the liver to norfentanyl by cytochrome CYP3A4 isoform. 
Norfentanyl is not pharmacologically active in animal studies. It is more than 90 % eliminated by 
biotransformation to N-dealkylated and hydroxylated inactive metabolites. 
Elimination 
Disposition of fentanyl following intranasal administration of PecFent has not been characterised in a 
mass balance study. Less than 7 % of an administered dose of fentanyl is excreted unchanged in the 
urine and only about 1 % is excreted unchanged in the faeces. The metabolites are mainly excreted in 
the urine, while faecal excretion is less important. 
The total plasma clearance of fentanyl following intravenous administration is approximately 42 L/h. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Dose-proportionality was demonstrated for Cmax and AUC in the dose range 100 micrograms to 
800 micrograms. 
The effect of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of PecFent has not been studied.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity,  genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. 
Embryo-foetal developmental toxicity studies conducted in rats and rabbits revealed no compound-
induced malformations or developmental variations when administered during the period of 
organogenesis. 
In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, a male-mediated effect was observed at 
high doses (300 mcg/kg/day, s.c.) and is consistent with the sedative effects of fentanyl in animal 
studies. 
In studies on pre and postnatal development in rats the survival rate of offspring was significantly 
reduced at doses causing severe maternal toxicity. Further findings at maternally toxic doses in F1 
pups were delayed physical development, sensory functions, reflexes and behaviour. These effects 
could either be indirect effects due to altered maternal care and/or decreased lactation rate or a direct 
effect of fentanyl on the pups. 
Carcinogenicity studies (26-week dermal alternative bioassay in Tg.AC transgenic mice; two-year 
subcutaneous carcinogenicity study in rats) with fentanyl did not induce any findings indicative of 
oncogenic potential.  Evaluation of brain slides from the carciogenicity study in rats revealed brain 
lesions in animals administered high doses of fentanyl citrate.  The relevance of these findings to 
humans is unknown.

Partially used PecFent bottles may contain enough medicine to be harmful or life-threatening to a 
child.  Even if there is little or no medicine left in the bottle, PecFent must be disposed of properly, 
according to the following steps: 
o 
Patients and caregivers must be instructed to properly dispose of all unused, partially used and 
used PecFent bottles. The patient should be instructed how to do this correctly.  
If there are any unwanted therapeutic sprays remaining in the bottle, the patient should be 
instructed to expel these as follows: 
o 
2 spray bottle: 
o 
Aim the spray away from themselves (and any other people) and expel remaining spray until the 
red number “2” appears in the counting window and there are no more full therapeutic sprays 
obtainable from the bottle. 
After the counter has advanced to “2”, the patient should continue to push down on the finger 
grips (there will be some increased resistance) a total of four times in order to expel any residual 
medicine from the bottle.  
After the 2 therapeutic sprays have been emitted, the patient will not hear a click and the counter 
will not advance beyond “2”; further sprays emitted will not be full sprays and should not be 
used therapeutically. 
8 spray bottle: 
o 
Aim the spray away from themselves (and any other people) and expel remaining spray until the 
red number “8” appears in the counting window and there are no more full therapeutic sprays 
obtainable from the bottle. 
After the counter has advanced to “8”, the patient should continue to push down on the finger 
grips (there will be some increased resistance) a total of four times in order to expel any residual 
medicine from the bottle.  
After the 8 therapeutic sprays have been emitted, the patient will not hear a click and the counter 
will not advance beyond “8”; further sprays emitted will not be full sprays and should not be 
used therapeutically. 
o 
o 
o 
o 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As soon as PecFent is no longer needed, patients and members of their household must be advised to 
systematically dispose of any bottles remaining from a prescription as soon as possible by returning 
them to their child-resistant container and discarding them, according to local requirements or by 
returning them to the pharmacy.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What PecFent is and what it is used for 
What PecFent is 
PecFent contains fentanyl, which is a strong pain-relieving medicine known as an opioid pain killer.  
What PecFent is used for 
PecFent is used in adults with cancer for a type of pain called ‘breakthrough’ pain.  
• 
• 
Breakthrough pain comes on suddenly.  
It comes on even though you have taken your usual opioid pain killer (such as morphine, 
fentanyl, oxycodone or hydromorphone) to control your constant background pain.  
PecFent is only to be used by adults who are already taking other opioid medicines daily for their 
constant cancer pain. 
How PecFent works 
PecFent is a nasal spray, solution  
•  When you spray PecFent into your nose the very small spray droplets form a thin gel.  
• 
•  This means the medicine gets into your system quickly to relieve your breakthrough pain. 
Fentanyl is absorbed quickly through the lining of your nose and into the blood stream.  
2.  What you need to know before you use PecFent 
Do not use PecFent if: 
• 
• 
you are allergic to fentanyl or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in Section 6). 
you are not regularly using a prescribed opioid medicine (e.g codeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, 
morphine, oxycodone, pethidine), every day on a regular schedule, for at least a week, to control 
your persistent pain. If you have not been using these medicines you must not use PecFent, 
because it may increase the risk that breathing could become dangerously slow and/or shallow, 
or even stop.

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you suffer from short-term pain other than breakthrough pain. 
you have a serious breathing or lung problem. 
you are being treated with medicines contain sodium oxybate. 
Do not use PecFent if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before using PecFent. 
Warnings and precautions 
Keeping PecFent safe from children 
• 
You must keep PecFent in the child resistant storage container when you are not using it, even if 
you have used all 8 sprays. This is because PecFent could be life-threatening if taken by a child 
by accident.  
Check with your doctor or pharmacist before using PecFent if: 
• 
you have not been taking the same dose of your daily opioid medicine for your constant pain for 
some time 
you have breathing problems such as asthma, wheezing or shortness of breath 
you suffer a severe blow to the head 
you have problems with your heart especially slow heart rate 
you have low blood pressure or a low amount of fluid in your circulation 
you have liver or kidney problems. This is because it may affect the way in which your body 
breaks down the medicine. 
you take antidepressants or antipsychotics, please refer to the section ‘Other medicines and 
PecFent’. 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using 
PecFent. 
• 
If you are an athlete, using PecFent may result in positive doping-tests. 
Your doctor may need to check you more closely if: 
• 
you or anyone in your family have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription 
medicines or illegal drugs (“addiction”) 
you are a smoker 
you have ever had problems with your mood (depression, anxiety or a personality disorder) or 
have been treated by a psychiatrist for other mental illnesses 
Repeated use of PecFent may lead to dependence and abuse which may result in life-threatening 
overdose. If you have concern that you may become dependent on PecFent, it is important that you 
consult your doctor. 
Consult your doctor while using PecFent if: 
• 
• 
• 
you suffer from recurrent nose bleeding - he may advise an alternative treatment 
you feel that PecFent is becoming less effective in treating your episodes of breakthrough pain 
you experience pain or increased sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia) which does not respond to a 
higher dosage of your medicine as prescribed by your doctor 
you think you are becoming dependent on PecFent 
you experience a combination of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, 
weakness, dizziness and low blood pressure. Together these symptoms may be a sign of a 
potentially life-threatening condition called adrenal insufficiency, a condition in which the 
adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones 
you have ever developed adrenal insufficiency or lack of sex hormones (androgen deficiency) 
with opioid use 
• 
• 
• 
Sleep-related breathing disorders 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PecFent can cause sleep-related breathing disorders such as sleep apnoea (breathing pauses during 
sleep) and sleep related hypoxemia (low oxygen level in the blood). The symptoms can include 
breathing pauses during sleep, night awakening due to shortness of breath, difficulties to maintain 
sleep or excessive drowsiness during the day. If you or another person observe these symptoms, 
contact your doctor. A dose reduction may be considered by your doctor. 
Children and adolescents 
PecFent is not approved for use in children under 18 years of age. 
Other medicines and PecFent 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.  
In particular tell your doctor or pharmacist before using PecFent if you are taking or have recently 
taken any of the following medicines: 
• 
medicines that might make you sleepy such as sleeping tablets, tranquilisers, muscle relaxants, 
medicines for anxiety such as benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam), or medicines for allergies (anti-
histamines). Use of PecFent at the same time as medicines that make you feel sleepy increases 
the risk of drowsiness, difficulties in breathing (respiratory depression), coma and may be life-
threatening. Contact your doctor if you get any of these symptoms. For this reason use of 
PecFent, together with sedatives, should only be considered when other treatment options are 
not possible. However, if your doctor does prescribe PecFent together with sedative medicines 
the dose and length of treatment should be limited by your doctor. Tell your doctor about all 
sedative medicines you are taking, and follow your doctors dose instructions closely. It 
could be helpful to inform friends or relatives to be aware of the signs and symptoms stated 
above. 
medicines for depression called ‘monoamine-oxidase inhibitors’ (MAOI). Tell your doctor or 
pharmacist if you have taken an MAOI medicine in the past 2 weeks before using PecFent. 
The risk of side effects increases if you are taking medicines such as certain antidepressants or 
antipsychotics. PecFent may interact with these medicines and you may experience mental 
status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, coma), and other effects such as body temperature 
above 38°C, increase in heart rate, unstable blood pressure, and exaggeration of reflexes, 
muscular rigidity, lack of coordination and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhoea). Your doctor will tell you whether PecFent is suitable for you. 
nasal sprays to treat a stuffy nose (containing a decongestant such as oxymetazoline) 
medicines that might have an effect on the way your body breaks down PecFent. These include:  
medicines for HIV infection (such as ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir or fosamprenavir)  
o 
medicines for fungal infections (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole or fluconazole) 
o 
medicines for bacterial infections (such as troleandomycin, clarithromycin or 
o 
erythromycin)  
‘aprepitant’ - used to stop you feeling sick 
‘diltiazem’ and ‘verapamil’ - used for high blood pressure or heart problems. 
other pain killers called partial agonist/antagonist like buprenorphine, nalbuphine, 
pentazocine. You could experience symptoms of withdrawal syndrome (nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, anxiety, chills, tremor, and sweating) while using these medicines. 
some painkillers for nerve pain (gabapentin and pregabalin)

o 
o 
o 
• 
• 
• 
If any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using 
PecFent. 
Don’t use any other kind of nasal spray for at least 15 minutes after using PecFent. 
PecFent with food, drink and alcohol 
• 
• 
Do not drink alcohol while using PecFent. It can increase the risk of getting serious side effects. 
Do not drink grapefruit juice while using PecFent. It may affect the way your body breaks down 
PecFent. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
• 
Do not use PecFent if you are pregnant or might get pregnant, unless your doctor has told you 
to. 
Do not use PecFent during child birth. This is because it may cause breathing problems in your 
baby. 
Do not use PecFent if you are breast-feeding. This is because the medicine can get into your 
breast milk and may cause side effects in the breast-fed child. 
You should not start breast-feeding within 5 days after the last dose of PecFent. 
• 
• 
• 
Driving and using machines 
• 
Talk to your doctor about whether it will be safe for you to drive or use tools or machines after 
using PecFent. 
You may feel sleepy, dizzy or have problems with your eyesight after using PecFent. If this 
happens, do not drive or use any tools or machines.  
Do not drive or use tools or machines until you know how this medicine makes you feel.  
• 
• 
PecFent contains propylparahydroxybenzoate (E216). 
May cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed), and exceptionally, bronchospasm (if you do not use 
the nasal spray correctly).  
3. 
How to use PecFent 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
PecFent comes in two different strengths: a 100 microgram per spray bottle and a 400 microgram 
per spray bottle. Make sure that you use the strength that your doctor has prescribed for you. 
How much to use 
• 
A dose to treat a breakthrough pain episode might be either 1 spray or 2 sprays (one in each 
nostril). Your doctor will tell you how many sprays (1 or 2) you should use to treat your 
breakthrough pain episode. 
Do not use more than the dose your doctor prescribes for any single breakthrough pain 
episode. 
Do not use PecFent more than 4 times daily 
• 
•  Wait at least 4 hours to take the next dose of PecFent. 
Starting dose 
• 
• 
• 
The starting dose is 100 micrograms. 
This is a single spray into one nostril from the 100 microgram per spray bottle.  
See ‘Using the PecFent bottle’ for instructions on how to use a dose. 
Finding the right dose 
• 
Your doctor will then help you find the right dose to relieve your breakthrough pain. It is very 
important to follow your doctor’s instructions. 
Tell your doctor about your pain and how PecFent is working. Your doctor will decide if your 
PecFent dose needs to be changed.  
Do not change the dose yourself. 
Once you have found the right dose 
• 
Tell your doctor if your dose of PecFent does not relieve your breakthrough pain. Your doctor 
will decide if your dose needs to be changed. Do not change the dose of PecFent or your 
other pain medicines yourself. 
41 
• 
• 
• 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Tell your doctor straight away if you have more than 4 episodes of breakthrough pain a day. 
Your doctor may change the medicine for your constant pain. Once your constant pain is 
controlled, your doctor may then change your dose of PecFent. 
If you are not sure about the right dose or how much PecFent to use, ask your doctor. 
Using the PecFent bottle 
Preparing the PecFent bottle for use  
Before you use a new bottle of PecFent you need to prepare it for use. This is called ‘priming’.  
To prime the bottle, please follow the instructions below: 
1. 
A new bottle of PecFent will show two red lines in the counting window in the white plastic top 
on the bottle (Figure 1 and Figure 3a).  
Take off the clear plastic protective cap from the nozzle (Figure 1). 
Aim the nasal spray away from you (and any other people). 
Hold the PecFent nasal spray upright with your thumb on the bottom of the bottle, and your first 
and middle fingers on the finger grips each side of the nozzle (Figure 2).  
Firmly press down on the finger grips until a ‘click’ is heard and then let go of the grips (Figure 
2). You will hear a second ‘click’ and there should now be a single large red bar in the counting 
window (Figure 3b). 
Repeat step 5 three times. As you repeat step 5, the red bar will become smaller and smaller 
until you see a green bar in the counting window (Figure 3b-e).  The green bar means the 
PecFent nasal spray is ready to use.  
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
7.  Wipe the nozzle with a tissue and flush the tissue down the toilet. 
8. 
If you are not going to use your medicine straight away, put the protective cap back on. Then 
put the PecFent bottle in the child-resistant storage container.   If PecFent has not been used for 
5 days, re-prime by spraying once. 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Using PecFent 
PecFent is only to be used by spraying into your nostril.  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
7. 
8. 
Check that there is a green bar or a number showing in the counting window (Figure 4): this 
confirms that the PecFent bottle has been primed (see ‘Preparing the PecFent bottle for use’ 
above). 
Blow your nose if you feel you need to.  
Sit down with your head upright. 
Take off the protective cap from the nozzle. 
Hold the PecFent bottle with your thumb on the bottom of the bottle and your first and middle 
fingers on the finger grips (Figure 4).  
Put the nozzle a short distance (about 1 cm) into your nostril. Point it inwards towards the wall 
of your nose. This will tilt the bottle slightly (Figure 5). 
Close the other nostril with a finger from your other hand (Figure 5). 
Firmly press down on the finger grips so that PecFent sprays into your nostril. When you hear a 
click let go of the grips. Note: You may not feel anything happen in your nose at all – do not 
trust this to mean the spray did not operate – rely on the click and number counter.  
Breathe in gently through your nose and out through your mouth.  
9. 
10.  The number counter will move forward after each use and show how many sprays have been 
used. 
If your doctor has prescribed a second spray, repeat steps 5 to 9, using the other nostril.  
11. 
Do not use more than the dose that your doctor prescribes to treat any single pain episode. 
12.  Put the bottle back in the child-resistant container after each use. Keep out of the sight and reach 
of children (Figure 6) 
13.  Stay sitting for at least 1 minute after using the nasal spray. 
Number of sprays in a PecFent bottle 
There are 8 full sprays in each PecFent bottle. 
• 
After the first spray, number 1 will appear in the counting window. This will go up each time 
the spray is used.  
•  When you see a red 8 in the counting window, the bottle is finished and you will no longer be 
able to get a full spray from it. 
Disposal of unused PecFent 
If you can see a number, other than 8 in the counting window, you have NOT used all 8 sprays in the 
bottle. There are still doses of PecFent left in the bottle. 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You must empty the remaining doses of PecFent from the bottle by aiming the nasal spray away 
from you (and any other people) and pressing and releasing the grips until the red number “8” appears 
in the counting window. 
When you see the number “8” in the counting window, there is still medicine in the bottle that 
you must empty. 
• 
 You will need to press down and release the finger grips 4 more times while aiming the nasal 
spray away from you (and any other people). 
You will feel some increased resistance when you press down and the finger grips will only 
move a small amount. 
You will NOT hear a click when you press down . 
The counter will stay on the number “8”. 
Put the protective cap back on the spray bottle.  
Put the bottle back in the child resistant container. 
Speak to your local pharmacy about disposal of empty bottles (see ‘How to store PecFent’) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If the PecFent nasal spray is blocked or does not spray properly 
• 
If the spray is blocked, aim the spray away from you (and any other people) and push firmly 
down on the pump. This should clear any blockage. 
If your nasal spray is still not working properly, dispose of the faulty bottle and start a new one. 
Tell your doctor what happened. Never try to fix the nasal spray yourself or take it apart. 
This is because it may then give you the wrong dose. 
• 
Dispose of the PecFent bottle and start a new one if: 
• 
It has been 60 days or more since you primed or used your bottle for the first time. 
If you use more PecFent than you should 
• 
If you use more PecFent than you should, you may feel sleepy, sick, dizzy or have slow or 
shallow breathing. In severe cases taking too much PecFent may also lead to coma. If you feel 
very dizzy, very sleepy or have slow or shallow breathing, call an ambulance or ask someone 
else to call one straight away. 
If you stop using PecFent 
If you no longer have breakthrough pain, talk to your doctor before stopping PecFent and follow 
his/her advice. However, you should keep taking your other opioid medicine to treat your constant 
pain. Your doctor may need to check the dose. 
You may experience withdrawal symptoms similar to the possible side effects of PecFent when 
discontinuing PecFent. If you experience withdrawal symptoms, you should contact your doctor. Your 
doctor will evaluate if you need medicine to reduce or eliminate the withdrawal symptoms. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

How to use PecFent 
Possible side effects 
How to store PecFent 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What PecFent is and what it is used for 
What PecFent is 
PecFent contains fentanyl, which is a strong pain-relieving medicine known as an opioid pain killer.  
What PecFent is used for 
PecFent is used in adults with cancer for a type of pain called ‘breakthrough’ pain.  
• 
• 
Breakthrough pain comes on suddenly.  
It comes on even though you have taken your usual opioid pain killer (such as morphine, 
fentanyl, oxycodone or hydromorphone) to control your constant background pain.  
PecFent is only to be used by adults who are already taking other opioid medicines daily for their 
constant cancer pain. 
How PecFent works 
PecFent is a nasal spray, solution  
•  When you spray PecFent into your nose the very small spray droplets form a thin gel.  
• 
•  This means the medicine gets into your system quickly to relieve your breakthrough pain. 
Fentanyl is absorbed quickly through the lining of your nose and into the blood stream.  
2.  What you need to know before you use PecFent 
Do not use PecFent if: 
• 
• 
you are allergic to fentanyl or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in Section 6). 
you are not regularly using a prescribed opioid medicine (e.g codeine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, 
morphine, oxycodone, pethidine), every day on a regular schedule, for at least a week, to control 
your persistent pain. If you have not been using these medicines you must not use PecFent, 
because it may increase the risk that breathing could become dangerously slow and/or shallow, 
or even stop. 
you suffer from short-term pain other than breakthrough pain. 
•

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you have a serious breathing or lung problem. 
you are being treated with medicines contain sodium oxybate. 
Do not use PecFent if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before using PecFent. 
Warnings and precautions 
Keeping PecFent safe from children 
• 
You must keep PecFent in the child resistant storage container when you are not using it, even if 
you have used all 2 sprays. This is because PecFent could be life-threatening if taken by a child 
by accident.  
Check with your doctor or pharmacist before using PecFent if: 
• 
you have not been taking the same dose of your daily opioid medicine for your constant pain for 
some time 
you have breathing problems such as asthma, wheezing or shortness of breath 
you suffer a severe blow to the head 
you have problems with your heart especially slow heart rate 
you have low blood pressure or a low amount of fluid in your circulation 
you have liver or kidney problems. This is because it may affect the way in which your body 
breaks down the medicine. 
you take antidepressants or antipsychotics, please refer to the section ‘Other medicines and 
PecFent’. 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using 
PecFent. 
• 
If you are an athlete, using PecFent may result in positive doping-tests. 
Your doctor may need to check you more closely if: 
• 
you or anyone in your family have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription 
medicines or illegal drugs (“addiction”) 
you are a smoker 
you have ever had problems with your mood (depression, anxiety or a personality disorder) or 
have been treated by a psychiatrist for other mental illnesses 
Repeated use of PecFent may lead to dependence and abuse which may result in life-threatening 
overdose. If you have concern that you may become dependent on PecFent, it is important that you 
consult your doctor. 
Consult your doctor while using PecFent if: 
• 
• 
• 
you suffer from recurrent nose bleeding - he may advise an alternative treatment 
you feel that PecFent is becoming less effective in treating your episodes of breakthrough pain 
you experience pain or increased sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia) which does not respond to a 
higher dosage of your medicine as prescribed by your doctor 
you think you are becoming dependent on PecFent 
you experience a combination of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, 
weakness, dizziness and low blood pressure. Together these symptoms may be a sign of a 
potentially life-threatening condition called adrenal insufficiency, a condition in which the 
adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones 
you have ever developed adrenal insufficiency or lack of sex hormones (androgen deficiency) 
with opioid use 
• 
• 
• 
Sleep-related breathing disorders 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PecFent can cause sleep-related breathing disorders such as sleep apnoea (breathing pauses during 
sleep) and sleep related hypoxemia (low oxygen level in the blood). The symptoms can include 
breathing pauses during sleep, night awakening due to shortness of breath, difficulties to maintain 
sleep or excessive drowsiness during the day. If you or another person observe these symptoms, 
contact your doctor. A dose reduction may be considered by your doctor. 
Children and adolescents 
PecFent is not approved for use in children under 18 years of age. 
Other medicines and PecFent 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.  
In particular tell your doctor or pharmacist before using PecFent if you are taking or have recently 
taken any of the following medicines: 
• 
medicines that might make you sleepy such as sleeping tablets, tranquilisers, muscle relaxants, 
medicines for anxiety such as benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam), or medicines for allergies (anti-
histamines). Use of PecFent at the same time as medicines that make you feel sleepy increases 
the risk of drowsiness, difficulties in breathing (respiratory depression), coma and may be life-
threatening. Contact your doctor if you get any of these symptoms. For this reason use of 
PecFent, together with sedatives, should only be considered when other treatment options are 
not possible. However, if your doctor does prescribe PecFent together with sedative medicines 
the dose and length of treatment should be limited by your doctor. Tell your doctor about all 
sedative medicines you are taking, and follow your doctors dose instructions closely. It 
could be helpful to inform friends or relatives to be aware of the signs and symptoms stated 
above. 
medicines for depression called ‘monoamine-oxidase inhibitors’ (MAOI). Tell your doctor or 
pharmacist if you have taken an MAOI medicine in the past 2 weeks before using PecFent. 
The risk of side effects increases if you are taking medicines such as certain antidepressants or 
antipsychotics. PecFent may interact with these medicines and you may experience mental 
status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, coma), and other effects such as body temperature 
above 38°C, increase in heart rate, unstable blood pressure, and exaggeration of reflexes, 
muscular rigidity, lack of coordination and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhoea). Your doctor will tell you whether PecFent is suitable for you. 
nasal sprays to treat a stuffy nose (containing a decongestant such as oxymetazoline) 
medicines that might have an effect on the way your body breaks down PecFent. These include:  
medicines for HIV infection (such as ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir or fosamprenavir)  
o 
medicines for fungal infections (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole or fluconazole) 
o 
medicines for bacterial infections (such as troleandomycin, clarithromycin or 
o 
erythromycin)  
‘aprepitant’ - used to stop you feeling sick 
‘diltiazem’ and ‘verapamil’ - used for high blood pressure or heart problems. 
other pain killers called partial agonist/antagonist like buprenorphine, nalbuphine, 
pentazocine. You could experience symptoms of withdrawal syndrome (nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, anxiety, chills, tremor, and sweating) while using these medicines. 
some painkillers for nerve pain (gabapentin and pregabalin)

• 
• 
• 
If any of the above applies to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using 
PecFent. 
Don’t use any other kind of nasal spray for at least 15 minutes after using PecFent. 
PecFent with food, drink and alcohol 
• 
• 
Do not drink alcohol while using PecFent. It can increase the risk of getting serious side effects. 
Do not drink grapefruit juice while using PecFent. It may affect the way your body breaks down 
PecFent. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
• 
Do not use PecFent if you are pregnant or might get pregnant, unless your doctor has told you 
to. 
Do not use PecFent during child birth. This is because it may cause breathing problems in your 
baby. 
Do not use PecFent if you are breast-feeding. This is because the medicine can get into your 
breast milk and may cause side effects in the breast-fed child. 
You should not start breast-feeding within 5 days after the last dose of PecFent. 
• 
• 
• 
Driving and using machines 
• 
Talk to your doctor about whether it will be safe for you to drive or use tools or machines after 
using PecFent. 
You may feel sleepy, dizzy or have problems with your eyesight after using PecFent. If this 
happens, do not drive or use any tools or machines.  
Do not drive or use tools or machines until you know how this medicine makes you feel.  
• 
• 
PecFent contains propylparahydroxybenzoate (E216). 
May cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed), and exceptionally, bronchospasm (if you do not use 
the nasal spray correctly).  
3. 
How to use PecFent 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
PecFent comes in two different strengths: a 100 microgram per spray bottle and a 400 microgram 
per spray bottle. Make sure that you use the strength that your doctor has prescribed for you. 
How much to use 
• 
A dose to treat a breakthrough pain episode might be either 1 spray or 2 sprays (one in each 
nostril). Your doctor will tell you how many sprays (1 or 2) you should use to treat your 
breakthrough pain episode. 
Do not use more than the dose your doctor prescribes for any single breakthrough pain 
episode. 
Do not use PecFent more than 4 times daily 
• 
•  Wait at least 4 hours to take the next dose of PecFent. 
Starting dose 
• 
• 
• 
The starting dose is 100 micrograms. 
This is a single spray into one nostril from the 100 microgram per spray bottle.  
See ‘Using the PecFent bottle’ for instructions on how to use a dose. 
Finding the right dose 
• 
Your doctor will then help you find the right dose to relieve your breakthrough pain. It is very 
important to follow your doctor’s instructions. 
Tell your doctor about your pain and how PecFent is working. Your doctor will decide if your 
PecFent dose needs to be changed.  
Do not change the dose yourself. 
Once you have found the right dose 
• 
Tell your doctor if your dose of PecFent does not relieve your breakthrough pain. Your doctor 
will decide if your dose needs to be changed. Do not change the dose of PecFent or your 
other pain medicines yourself. 
52 
• 
• 
• 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Tell your doctor straight away if you have more than 4 episodes of breakthrough pain a day. 
Your doctor may change the medicine for your constant pain. Once your constant pain is 
controlled, your doctor may then change your dose of PecFent. 
If you are not sure about the right dose or how much PecFent to use, ask your doctor. 
Using the PecFent bottle 
Preparing the PecFent bottle for use  
Before you use a new bottle of PecFent you need to prepare it for use. This is called ‘priming’. It is 
recommended that you prime the bottle immediately before use rather than in advance (Note: This 2 
spray bottle cannot be re-primed. If the spray has not been used within 5 days after priming, the bottle 
should be discarded.) 
To prime the bottle, please follow the instructions below: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
A new bottle of PecFent will show two red lines in the counting window in the white plastic top 
on the bottle (Figure 1 and Figure 3a).  
Take off the white plastic protective cap from the nozzle (Figure 1). 
Aim the nasal spray away from you (and any other people). 
Hold the PecFent nasal spray upright with your thumb on the bottom of the bottle, and your first 
and middle fingers on the finger grips each side of the nozzle (Figure 2).  
Firmly press down on the finger grips until a ‘click’ is heard and then let go of the grips (Figure 
2). You will hear a second ‘click’ and there should now be a single large red bar in the counting 
window (Figure 3b). 
Repeat step 5 three times. As you repeat step 5, the red bar will become smaller and smaller 
until you see a green bar in the counting window (Figure 3b-e).  The green bar means the 
PecFent nasal spray is ready to use.  
7.  Wipe the nozzle with a tissue and flush the tissue down the toilet.  
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Using PecFent 
PecFent is only to be used by spraying into your nostril.  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
7. 
8. 
Check that there is a green bar or a number showing in the counting window (Figure 4): this 
confirms that the PecFent bottle has been primed (see ‘Preparing the PecFent bottle for use’ 
above). 
Blow your nose if you feel you need to.  
Sit down with your head upright. 
Take off the protective cap from the nozzle. 
Hold the PecFent bottle with your thumb on the bottom of the bottle and your first and middle 
fingers on the finger grips (Figure 4).  
Put the nozzle a short distance (about 1 cm) into your nostril. Point it inwards towards the wall 
of your nose. This will tilt the bottle slightly (Figure 5). 
Close the other nostril with a finger from your other hand (Figure 5). 
Firmly press down on the finger grips so that PecFent sprays into your nostril. When you hear a 
click let go of the grips. Note: You may not feel anything happen in your nose at all – do not 
trust this to mean the spray did not operate – rely on the click and number counter.  
Breathe in gently through your nose and out through your mouth.  
9. 
10.  The number counter will move forward after each use and show how many sprays have been 
used. 
If your doctor has prescribed a second spray, repeat steps 5 to 9, using the other nostril.  
11. 
Do not use more than the dose that your doctor prescribes to treat any single pain episode. 
12.  Put the bottle back in the child-resistant container after each use. Keep out of the sight and reach 
of children (Figure 6) 
13.  Stay sitting for at least 1 minute after using the nasal spray. 
Number of sprays in this PecFent bottle 
There are 2 full sprays in each PecFent bottle. 
• 
After the first spray, number 1 will appear in the counting window. This will go up to the 
number 2 when the spray is used again.  
•  When you see the red 2 in the counting window, the bottle is finished and you will no longer be 
able to get a full spray from it. 
Disposal of unused PecFent 
• 
If you can see a number, other than 2 in the counting window, you have NOT used all 2 sprays 
in the bottle. There are still doses of PecFent left in the bottle. 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
You must empty this remaining dose of PecFent from the bottle by aiming the nasal spray 
away from you (and any other people) and pressing and releasing the grips until the red number 
“2” appears in the counting window. 
When you see the number “2” in the counting window, there is still medicine in the bottle that 
you must empty. 
• 
 You will need to press down and release the finger grips 4 more times while aiming the nasal 
spray away from you (and any other people). 
You will feel some increased resistance when you press down and the finger grips will only 
move a small amount. 
You will NOT hear a click when you press down . 
The counter will stay on the number “2”. 
Put the protective cap back on the spray bottle.  
Put the bottle back in the child resistant container. 
Speak to your local pharmacy about disposal of empty bottles (see ‘How to store PecFent’) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If the PecFent nasal spray is blocked or does not spray properly 
• 
If the spray is blocked, aim the spray away from you (and any other people) and push firmly 
down on the pump. This should clear any blockage. 
If your nasal spray is still not working properly, dispose of the faulty bottle and start a new one. 
Tell your doctor what happened. Never try to fix the nasal spray yourself or take it apart. 
This is because it may then give you the wrong dose. 
• 
Dispose of the PecFent bottle and start a new one if: 
• 
It is more than 5 days since you primed your bottle for the first time. 
If you use more PecFent than you should 
• 
If you use more PecFent than you should, you may feel sleepy, sick, dizzy or have slow or 
shallow breathing. In severe cases taking too much PecFent may also lead to coma. If you feel 
very dizzy, very sleepy or have slow or shallow breathing, call an ambulance or ask someone 
else to call one straight away. 
If you stop using PecFent 
If you no longer have breakthrough pain, talk to your doctor before stopping PecFent and follow 
his/her advice. However, you should keep taking your other opioid medicine to treat your constant 
pain. Your doctor may need to check the dose. 
You may experience withdrawal symptoms similar to the possible side effects of PecFent when 
discontinuing PecFent. If you experience withdrawal symptoms, you should contact your doctor. Your 
doctor will evaluate if you need medicine to reduce or eliminate the withdrawal symptoms. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

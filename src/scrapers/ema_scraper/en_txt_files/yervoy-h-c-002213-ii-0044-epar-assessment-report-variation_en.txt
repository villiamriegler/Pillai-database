2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Ipilimumab 
Ipilimumab (BMS-734016, MDX-010, YERVOY) is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin specific for 
human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4). The proposed mechanism of action for ipilimumab 
is blocking the interaction of CTLA-4 with the ligand B7-1 and B7-2 (CD80/CD86). This results in T-cell 
activation, proliferation, and lymphocyte infiltration into tumours which leads to tumour cell death.  
Ipilimumab is approved as monotherapy in the European Union (July 2011), and other countries for 
the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults at a dose of 3 mg/kg 
administered intravenously (IV) once every 3 weeks for a total of 4 doses. 
Melanoma in paediatric population 
Melanoma is predominantly diagnosed in the adult population, however the incidence of paediatric 
melanoma is rising. Only 0.7-2% of all melanoma cases occur in patients below the age of 20 years, 
but melanoma is the most common form of skin cancer in the paediatric population. The incidence of 
cutaneous melanoma in the United States is 5.4 per 1 million paediatric patients and 20.2 per 1 million 
adult patients. Melanomas in adolescent patients, usually defined as patients from 11 to 19 years, 
behave similarly to melanoma in adults, but in the preadolescent population the presentation and 
prognosis differs1. Regarding presentation, melanomas in adults and adolescents are usually 
pigmented and have a diversity in colours and morphology. In preadolescents the melanomas are 
usually amelanotic, present as a papule or nodule, with regular and well-circumscribed borders and a 
diameter of less then 6 mm. Paediatric melanomas are therefore more difficult to distinguish from 
benign lesions. Moreover, preadolescent melanomas locate predominantly on the head and neck, while 
adolescents and adult patients present more often with truncal lesion. Risk factors between adult and 
paediatric melanomas are similar with increased risk with a family history of melanomas, history of 
frequent sunburns, numerous acquired melanocytic naevi or large congenital melanocytic naevi, 
immunosuppression, and pre-existing skin conditions1. 
Histologically, paediatric melanomas are often thicker than adults melanomas (Breslow thickness), 
although this not necessarily correlates with worse prognosis. Morphology in preadolescents is more 
commonly nodular and unclassified, spitzoid or atypical. Molecularly, the incidence of mutations in 
BRAF or CDKN2A overlap, but for example c-kit mutations are more specific for paediatric patients1.

Current treatment regimens in children are based on the treatments used in adults. Advanced 
melanoma in the paediatric population is challenging to treat with very limited licensed therapeutic 
options and therefore an unmet medical need exists. Children more often present with thicker lesions, 
and regional lymph node and distant metastases2. Whether the prognosis of preadolescents with 
melanoma differs from adolescents or adults is under debate. Some reports in literature describe 
better prognosis in younger children, others conclude that there is no difference or even a worse 
prognosis1. According to the SEER database, 5-year disease-specific survival for paediatric patients 
below the age of 20 years is 100% for in situ disease, 96% for localised disease, 77% for regional 
disease, and 57% for distant disease2. 
Therefore, while preadolescent melanoma patients are not comparable to adults patients, disease, 
prognosis and treatment of adolescents is considered similar to melanoma in adults. The current 
extension of the indication involves only adolescents and not pre-adolescents patients. 
Immunotherapy in advanced melanoma 
In clinical practice, ipilimumab is no longer used in the first-line setting for melanoma in most countries 
with the development of anti-PD1 therapies such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab that show efficacy 
in melanoma and have improved tolerability compared to ipilimumab. Moreover, in BRAF-mutated 
patients, BRAF and MEK inhibitor combinations can also be used. 
Compared to ipilimumab, the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab leads to prolonged progression-free 
survival and overall survival and had less high-grade toxicity than ipilimumab in patients with 
advanced melanoma. Estimated 12-month survival rates were 74.1% for pembrolizumab every 2 
weeks, 68.4% for pembrolizumab every 3 weeks, and 58.2% for ipilimumab. The hazard ratio for 
death upon pembrolizumab every 2 weeks was 0.63 (CI95% 0.47-0.83; p=0.0005) and 
pembrolizumab every 3 weeks 0.69 (CI95% 0.52- 0.90; p=0.0036)3. Also the combination therapy of 
nivolumab and ipilimumab versus ipilumumab monotherapy in the first line might lead to improved 
outcomes with 2-year overall survival of 63.8% (CI95% 53.3–72.6) for nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 
53.6% (CI95% 38.1–66.8) for ipilimumab alone. Median overall survival has not been reached in 
either group (HR 0.74, CI95% 0.43–1.26; p=0.26), but follow-up is ongoing4. After progression on 
anti-PD1 inhibitor there is still a need for alternative options and ipilimumab (also in combination with 
a checkpoint inhibitor) could then be a viable treatment option. Available retrospective efficacy data for 
ipilimumab monotherapy as second line treatment after nivolumab or pembrolizumab indicate that 
some of the patients still respond to ipilimumab monotherapy after failure to prior anti PD-therapy. 47 
patients were treated with ipilimumab monotherapy and 37 patients with nivolumab and ipilimumab 
combination therapy after treatment failure to anti-PD-1 therapy. Overall response rates for the mono- 
and combination therapy were 16% and 21%, respectively. Disease control rate was 42% for the 
mono- and 33% for the combination therapy and 1-year overall survival rates 54% and 55%, 
respectively5 . The ESMO guideline states that the recommendations for first-line treatment of

metastatic disease are indeed under debate and that reasonable approaches include anti-PD1 therapies 
and, for BRAF-mutated melanomas, combinations of BRAF inhibitors with MEK inhibitors6 . 
Paediatric investigation plan 
Based on the activity of ipilimumab against melanoma in adults, similar activity was anticipated in the 
paediatric population as for the adult population.  
An initial Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for all conditions in the category of malignant neoplasms 
except melanoma, nervous system, haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue (EMEA-000117-PIP01-07), 
and one for the condition of melanoma (EMEA-000117-PIP02-10) was provided to the European 
Medicines Agency's (EMA) Paediatric Committee (PDCO) in 2007 and 2010, respectively. Following 
review by the PDCO, decisions on the PIPs were rendered by the EMA in November 2007 and June 
2011, respectively. Subsequent Requests for Modification (RfM) for the PIP in the category of 
malignant neoplasms (except melanoma, nervous system, haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue) and 
for the PIP for melanoma were submitted. According to the MAH, the PIP for malignant neoplasms has 
been completed and all study reports have been checked for compliance. Clinical study 
NCI7458/CA184070, which was included in both PIPs, was submitted under Article 46 in December 
2014 and a decision reached in February 2015. Clinical study CA184178 is currently submitted under 
Article 46 for the condition of melanoma. 
The most recent Request for Modification (EMEA-000117-PIP02-10-M07) for the condition of melanoma 
was submitted to the PDCO in September 2016 and reached a positive opinion in December 2016, in 
which the MAH explained the difficulties encountered with recruitment into the phase 2 study 
CA184178 due to the rarity of the target population and the rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape. 
This has resulted in new clinical studies competing for patients. In the request, the PDCO agreed to the 
following modifications: 
•  Removal of the PIP-targeted indication of “treatment of patients with melanoma (surgically 
resected) in the adjuvant setting study” and study CA184116/E1609 
•  Reduction of the number of treated patients in study CA184178, a study in children ages 12 to 
<18 years with untreated or previously treated advanced/metastatic melanoma, from 30 to 12 
•  Removal of the Key Binding Element of lymphocyte phenotyping and circulating levels of 
selected cytokines assessments for study CA184178 
•  Addition of PPK modelling and simulation and extrapolation studies to inform physicians in the 
safe and effective use of ipilimumab in younger advanced/metastatic melanoma patients. 
In melanoma patients, two paediatric studies in advanced metastatic melanoma have been completed: 
NCI7458/CA184070 and CA184178 (Table 1). A third paediatric study, E1609 (also known as 
CA184116), a phase 3 randomised study of adjuvant ipilimumab anti-CTLA-4 therapy vs high-dose 
interferon alfa-2b for resected high-risk melanoma, is being conducted with the cooperation of the 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), primarily in high-risk surgically-resected melanoma in 
the adjuvant setting. The amendment to add a paediatric/adolescent cohort to study CA184116/E1609 
was activated on 23-Sep-2014. The primary endpoint for adolescents is safety. Of the originally 
planned 45 adolescent patients, 3 were enrolled over 15 months up to November 2016 and 2 patients 
were treated. As of December 2016 enrolment of adolescents in this study was stopped, which was 
agreed by the PDCO (see above). Safety data from the two patients is provided by the MAH in this 
submission.

With the current application, the MAH proposes to extent the indication for treatment of advanced 
melanoma in adults to adolescents > 12 years of age. The posology is similar in adults and 
adolescents: Ipilimumab is to be administered intravenously (IV) at doses of 3 mg/kg over 90 minutes 
on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles.  
Two clinical trials have been conducted to study ipilimumab in children and adolescents: 
NCI7458/CA184070 and CA184178.  
Study NCI7458 (or CA1840701) was a phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation (doses of 1, 
3, 5 and 10 mg/kg) study conducted with ipilimumab in children, adolescents, and young adults, 
ranging in age from 1 to 21 year with untreatable, relapsed or refractory solid malignant tumors 
(including melanoma) without a curative option with standard therapy. A primary objective of this 
study was to assess the PK of ipilimumab administered IV in subjects ≤21 years of age with solid 
tumors, including advanced melanoma, refractory to standard therapy. 
Study CA184178 was a non-randomised, multicenter, open-label, phase 2 study of ipilimumab for 
children and adolescents 12 to <18 years with previously treated or untreated, unresectable stage III 
or stage IV malignant melanoma. Children and adolescents were treated with 4 infusions of 3 or 10 
mg/kg at weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10. A total of 12 children or adolescents were treated with either 3 (n=4) 
or 10 (n=8) mg/kg ipilimumab. 
Results from study NCI7458/CA184070 have been submitted previously as an Article 46 of regulation 
(EC) N0 1901/2006 post-authorisation measure EMEA/H/C/002213-EU/1/11/698/001-002. Results 
from study CA184178 have been discussed and reported previously as part of art 46 procedure. The 
pharmacokinetic data from study NCI7458/CA184070 and study CA184178 were included in a 
population pharmacokinetic (PPK) analysis to support this application. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
• 
YERVOY is indicated for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in 
adults, and children and adolescents 12 years of age and older. 
The final agreed indication is as follows: 
• 
YERVOY is indicated for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in 
adults, and adolescents 12 years of age and older (see section 4.4). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Ipilimumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and therefore is 
considered to not pose a significant risk to the environment. Thus, as ipilumumab and excipients do 
not pose a significant risk to the environment, it is exempt from an Environmental Risk Assessment, as 
per the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use” 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00).

2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant submitted a justification for not submitting ERA studies. As proteins are expected to 
biodegrade and not be a significant risk to the environment, the lack of ERA studies is acceptable. No 
changes to the SmPC are considered necessary. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considered that the non-clinical aspects have been satisfactorily addressed and that the lack 
of ERA studies is considered justified. Ipilimumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of ipilimumab.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic data from two paediatric clinical trials NCI7458/CA184070 and CA184178, which 
have already been evaluated in previous procedures have been included in a population 
pharmacokinetic (PPK) analysis to support this application. 
Methods 
Bioanalytical methods  
Quantification of ipilimumab in human serum was performed using a validated enzyme linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The assay provides a quantitative measurement of ipilimumab in 
human serum using CTLA4/Fc chimera as the capture reagent and an alkaline phosphatase-labeled 
goat anti-human IgG F(ab’)2 for detection. The validated range for this method in human serum is 
from 0.800 to 25.6 μg/ml. 
Pharmacokinetics of ipilimumab were derived from serum concentration versus time data. Individual 
participant PK parameter values were calculated by noncompartmental methods by a validated PK 
analysis program, Phoenix® WinNonlin® Version 6.2.1 (Pharsight Corporation, St Louis, MO). 
Antibodies against ipilimumab were analysed by a drug-tolerant electrochemiluminescent (ECL) 
immunoassay, ICDIM 14 V 2.02. A 3-tiered approach was used: screening, confirmation and 
quantification of the anti-ipilimumab antibodies. 
popPK analysis 
The popPK analysis dataset included 521 adults and 44 pediatric subjects. These studies were selected 
for inclusion in the popPK analysis on the basis of the available PK data, with ipilimumab monotherapy 
in the relevant subject populations. The 2 pediatric studies (NCI7458/CA184070 and CA184178) 
included in this analysis are the only clinical studies in pediatric subjects with advanced or unresectable 
melanoma. The 4 adult studies (CA184004, CA184007, CA184008, CA184022) are Phase 2 studies in 
subjects with advanced melanoma treated with ipilimumab at doses of 3 or 10 mg/kg. 
The popPK model development consisted of 1) Base Model to re-estimate the PK parameters using a 
previously determined final model for adults and 2) Full Model to assess the additional age effect on 
ipilimumab CL. The base mode was a linear 2-compartment model with zero-order IV infusion and 
first-order elimination, parameterized in terms of CL, volume of central compartment (VC), inter-
compartmental clearance (Q), and volume of peripheral compartment (VP). The inter-individual 
variability model was specified by log-normal distributions in the following model parameters among 
individuals: CL and VC. A combined residual error model (additive and proportional error) was used to 
describe the random differences between observed values and the corresponding model predictions. 
The full model was identical to the base model, with the addition of a covariate effect of age on 
ipilimumab CL. The covariates tested in the full model described in the following equations and the 
covariate-parameter effects assessed in the full model are provided below in Table 2. Full model with 
the addition of covariate effect of age.

(BW), baseline LDH (BLDH) and Age , BWREF = 78 kg, BLDHREF = 210 U/L, AGE REF = 57 years of age 
and CL BW, CL LDH, CL AGE and VCBW are model parameters.  
The effects of the other demographic and clinical covariates tested in the base model were not 
statistically significant or the magnitude of the effect was considered to be of minimal clinical relevance 
(less than ± 20% effect on the typical value of a model parameter relative to the reference value). 
Parameter estimates from the full model are presented in Table 2. Inferences regarding the effect of 
covariates were based upon the full model parameter estimates

Model evaluation 
The popPK model parameters were estimated with good precision. When evaluating all peak and 
trough concentrations after the first dose, approximately 3.8% and 4.1% of the peak-concentration 
data fell below and above the 90% prediction interval, respectively, which compared well with the 
expected 5% of data above and below. For the trough concentration, approximately 7.4% and 9.8% of 
data fell below and above the 90% prediction interval, respectively. No consistent over- or 
under-prediction of the model was observed.

Results 
Study CA184070 
In study CA184070, a total of 32 children and adolescents, and young adults were treated with 
ipilimumab intravenously at 1, 3, 5 and 10 mg/kg. PK samples were collected predose and 2 hours 
post infusion, Days 2, 4, 8, and 15 during Cycle 1 and 3, and then prior to each dose thereafter. 
Pharmacokinetic results study CA184070 as reported in the previous procedures is summarized in 
Table 3. There was no apparent difference in Cmax, AUC0-21, Ctrough between children (≥2 and <12 
years), adolescents (≥12 and <18 years), and adults. The elimination half-life seemed somewhat 
longer in paediatric patients<12 years (t1/2=14.1-14.3 days) compared to older patients 9.8-12.7 
days.

Study CA184178 
In study CA184178, ipilimumab was administered intravenously (IV) at doses of 3 or 10 mg/kg over 
90 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles. Pharmacokinetics of ipilimumab was evaluated 
following the 3rd administration. By that time 3 out of 8 participants receiving 10 mg/kg and 1 out of 4 
participants receiving 3 mg/kg ipilimumab had discontinued treatment due to AEs. Hence, 
pharmacokinetic data were available from 4 subjects receiving 10 mg/kg and 3 subjects receiving 3 
mg/kg. The individual pharmacokinetic parameters are listed in Table 4. Based on the results of this 
study, the paediatric data suggest that the exposure of ipilimumab (e.g., AUC, Cmax, and Cmin) 
increased approximately in proportion with doses ranging from 3 to 10 mg/kg, although the data are 
limited.

popPK analysis 
The effect of categorical and continuous covariates on the typical value of the structural model 
parameters of CL and VC and the estimated covariate effects (and 95% confidence intervals) are 
presented in Figure 3. 
The magnitude of the effect of body weight, LDH on CL, and the effect of body weight on central 
volume of distribution in this pooled population were comparable to what was previously reported in 
the adult population only. The effect of age on CL was not clinically relevant (with ± 20% of the 
reference value) as shown in Figure 3, and the 95% CI of the estimated effect included zero. 
Accounting for uncertainty, the effect of age on CL in this population is within the ± 20% boundaries.

Ipilimumab Covariate Effects on PPK Model Parameters (Full PPK Model) 
Comparisons of the dose-normalized ipilimumab exposure and PK parameters by age groups are 
provided in Table 5 and Table 6. Cl (L/h) was lower in pediatric patients than in adults. The allometric 
exponent of body weight on CL was estimated to be ~0.95, suggesting the CL increases only slightly 
less than proportional to body weight. Therefore, a body weight based dosing regimen will result in a 
similar exposure in different body-weight groups. Although a prolonged beta phase half-life was 
observed in the paediatric group < 12 years of age, this trend was largely diminished in the age group 
of 12 to 18 years of age. Overall, the pediatric subjects achieved a slightly greater exposure 
(geometric mean, normalized by mg/kg dose) than those of adults (Table 6).

The MAH was asked to discuss the degree of precision (% CV) in the estimation of PK parameters in 
adolescents in order to conclude that the PK was similar between children/adolescents and adults. In 
the popPK analysis, the differences in geometric mean (GM) exposure metrics Cmin, Cmax and Cavg 
were less than 15% (see Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6).

With reference to literature, key ipilimumab PK parameters (clearance and volume of distribution) in 
paediatric patients within 60-140% of the typical value, were considered acceptable. Simulated 95% CI 
of the clearance in percentages for a typical 12, 8 and 4 year-old subject were even within 75%-133%, 
with a RSE% of less than 15%. Simulated 95% CI of the volume of distribution in percentages for a 
typical 12, 8 and 4 year-old subject were even within 90%-109%, with a RSE% of less than 5%. 
Exposure-Response Relationship 
The exploratory E-R analysis was performed with the available clinical data in paediatric melanoma 
subjects from CA184070 and CA184178. The similarity in BOR was assessed with respect to a 
previously developed E-R model of BOR in adults3, and the similarity in OS was assessed by comparing 
OS of adult melanoma subjects at 3 and 10 mg/kg (N=494, CA184004, CA184007, CA184008 and 
CA184022) with the corresponding OS in paediatric subjects. 
The available paediatric BOR data from CA184-070 and CA184-178 (N=38, age ranging from 2 to 22 
years) were overlaid on the probability of BOR predicted by the previously developed E-R of BOR in 
adult subjects (Figure 1). The locally weighted (loess) regression of the paediatric BOR data suggests 
that the E-R of BOR in paediatric subjects is similar to the E-R in adult subjects.

Model predictability of BOR for adults and observed BOR for paediatrics versus 
Paediatric survival data is only available from study CA184178 (N=12, age ranging from 12 to 16 
years). The OS of paediatric and adult subjects receiving 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg ipilimumab were 
compared by nonparametric Kaplan-Meier analysis, and are presented in Figure 8 and Figure 9, 
respectively. Although there is a high degree of uncertainty in the K-M of OS of paediatric patients, the 
survival probability of paediatric subjects was higher than adult subjects in both the 3 and 10 mg/kg 
dose groups. 
Although the paediatric data are limited, the results of the exploratory analyses of efficacy in paediatric 
subjects are consistent with the expectation that the E-R of efficacy in paediatric subjects is similar to 
that of adult subjects.

Immunogenicity  
Among available data for 45 pediatric subjects, 1 subject in the 10 mg/kg group had a HAHA positive 
result at baseline and 1 subject in the 5 mg/kg group had a HAHA positive results on Day 1 (sample 
collected 15 minutes into the infusion).  
No subjects were considered to be positive up to 26 weeks after ipilimumab treatment. Based on these 
results, no summaries for neutralizing antibodies were presented. 
2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The bioanalytical methods for ipilimumab and anti-ipilimumab antibodies have been described in earlier 
applications and were considered adequate. 
The popPK model parameters were estimated with good precision, shrinkage was <25% and based on 
Cmax and Cmin data in the total population, there is no indication for consistent over- or under 
prediction of the model. Paediatric patients were ~9% of the total population, and the VPC plots 
indicated that the popPK model somewhat underestimated the ipilimumab concentrations in paediatric 
patients by <25% following the first dose. The impact of this seemingly underestimation is low and no 
further optimization of the model is requested. Based on a population PK analysis using available 
pooled data from 565 patients from 4 phase 2 adult studies (N=521) and 2 paediatric studies (N=44), 
clearance of ipilimumab increased with increasing baseline body weight. Age (2-87 years) had no 
clinically important effect on the clearance of ipilimumab. The estimated geometric mean clearance 
(CL) is 8.72 mL/h in adolescent patients aged ≥ 12 to <18 years. Exposures in adolescents are 
comparable with those in adults receiving the same mg/kg dose. Based on the simulation in adults and 
paediatrics, comparable exposure is achieved in adults and paediatrics at the recommended dose of 3 
mg/kg every 3 weeks. 
Results from paediatric studies CA184070 and CA184178 confirm that in paediatric patients clearance 
of ipilimumab is body weight dependent as was previously shown for adults. This supports the dosing 
based on body weight. Further, the results indicated that ipilimumab exposure in paediatric patients is 
slightly higher than in adults when dosed by mg/kg. There is however, a great overlap in all exposure 
parameters. The elimination half-life seemed somewhat longer in paediatric patients<12 years 
compared to older patients. The results in paediatric patients<12 years of age should be considered 
with caution since only 6 children had PK data following repeated dosing. Overall, the results from 
these studies show that adolescents treated with 3 mg/kg ipilimumab will have a similar exposure to 
ipilimumab as in adults with the approved 3 mg/kg dose.  
With regard to the model predicted probability of BOR for adults and observed BOR for paediatrics 
versus ipilimumab steady-state trough concentration, the applicant indicated that the locally weighted 
(loess) regression of the paediatric BOR data suggests that the E-R of BOR in pediatric subjects is 
similar to the E-R in adult subjects, although this seems only be due to 2 data points at the 10 mg/kg 
dose. 
The Kaplan-Meier plots for OS are based on a very limited number of paediatric patients (n=4 and n=8 
for 3 and 10 mg/kg, respectively) and therefore these data are only indicative but not conclusive of the 
potential similarity in OS exposure-response relationship between adolescents and adults.

Page 26/81 
 
 
 
 
2.3.3.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Results from paediatric studies CA184070 and CA184178 showed that ipilimumab exposure in 
paediatric patients seemed to overlap with the ipilimumab exposures in adults when dosed by mg/kg. 
Therefore, exposures in adolescents are comparable with those in adults receiving the same mg/kg 
dose and hence, the same level of efficacy is expected for this paediatric population. None of the 
paediatric subjects were found to be positive for anti-drug antibodies. This is in line with the low 
incidence of anti-drug antibodies in adults. The SmPC section 5.2 has been updated with the popPK 
analysis.

Treatments 
Ipilimumab was administered intravenously (IV) at doses of 3 or 10 mg/kg over 90 minutes on day 1 
of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles unless there was confirmed disease progression (per irRC), 
unacceptable toxicity, or patient request to stop study treatment. Patients eligible for retreatment 
could receive up to 4 additional doses of ipilimumab during retreatment: one dose every 3 weeks as 
was done during the initial treatment phase. Alternative therapy such as both anti-PD1 and ipilimumab 
were to be offered to the patient if their disease were to progress outside of the study. 
Patients who started at 10 mg/kg stayed on 10 mg/kg and no dose reduction was allowed.

Study scheme CA184178 
Corticosteroids (oral or intravenous) were permitted to be used for treatment of irAEs. Alternative 
immunosuppressive therapies were also permitted to treat irAEs that did not respond to initial steroid 
therapy.

As part of the safety analyses, the MAH evaluated the incidence of immune-related adverse events 
(irAEs) and immune-mediated adverse events (imARs): 
− 
irAEs are AEs of unknown aetiology, which are consistent with an immune phenomenon and 
identified by the investigator as related to study treatment. The irAEs were programmatically 
determined from a predefined list of MedDRA high-level group terms, high-level terms and 
preferred terms; changes may be made to this list with each new version of MedDRA. Six 
subcategories of irAEs were reported: gastrointestinal, liver, skin, endocrine, neurological, and 
other irAE summaries were also produced on diarrhoea as a separate grouped term. 
− 
imARs are AEs determined by the investigator to have an immune-mediate aetiology. imARs were 
likely to be inflammatory events associated with ipilimumab treatment.

Sample size 
The sample size for this study was not based upon a comparative objective. Initially, the study was 
designed to enrol approximately 30 patients, from age 12 to <18 years of age, with previously treated 
or untreated unresectable stage III or IV metastatic melanoma to be treated with 10 mg/kg or 3 
mg/kg of ipilimumab. In case not more than 10 patients were treated with 10 mg/kg, this sample size 
of approximately 30 patients ensured that at least 20 patients would have been treated with 3 mg/kg. 
If, however, more than 10 patients were treated with 10 mg/kg, the total sample size would have been 
increased to ensure that at least 20 patients would be treated with 3 mg/kg. With 20 patients treated 
at the 3 mg/kg dose, the lower boundary of the two-sided exact 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 
1-year survival rate would have been at least 27.2% if 10 or more patients are alive after 1 year. The 
maximum width of the CI would have been 46%. Assuming that the incidence of high-grade imARs 
was at least 15%, a sample size of 20 patients treated at 3 mg/kg would have provided a two-sided 
exact 95% CI of 3.2% to 37.9. 
Randomisation 
This was a non-randomised study. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Discrete variables were summarised with the number and proportion of patients falling into each 
category, grouped by treatment group (3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg total, unless otherwise noted). Unless 
otherwise indicated, percentages in the tables were column percentages, using all observations that 
belong in the column as the denominator. Percentages were rounded to the first decimal place and 
therefore may not always add up to 100. Continuous variables were summarised using descriptive 
statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values). Patient listings were 
produced to accompany the tabulations. Summary statistics were presented for each treatment group 
(ipilimumab 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) and for all treated patients unless otherwise noted. No formal 
statistical testing was performed, only summary statistics are provided. 
Exposure analyses 
Ipilimumab dose in mg/kg was calculated as the dose in mg divided by the most recent weight prior to 
infusion. Cumulative dose was defined as the sum of all calculated doses (mg). Cumulative dose of 
ipilimumab in mg/kg was defined as the sum of all doses (in mg/kg) received by the patient.

Efficacy analyses 
Due to the limited number of patients enrolled in this study, only key analyses were performed for 
each treatment group (3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of ipilimumab [primary objective analyses descriptive by 
dose level]). The 1-year OS rate was based on a Kaplan-Meier estimate along with their corresponding 
log-log transformed 95% confidence interval. The OS probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-
Meier product-limit method. The estimates of the median and corresponding two-sided 95% confidence 
intervals were calculated using the Brookmeyer and Crowley method. In addition, the 1-year survival 
rate was calculated as the proportion of patients alive at one year divided by the total number of 
treated patients along with the Clopper-Pearson exact two-sided 95% confidence interval. 
The PFS probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. The estimates of 
the median and corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the 
Brookmeyer and Crowley method. For both the DCR and BORR, each rate was presented together with 
its Clopper-Pearson exact two-sided 95% confidence interval. Patients were considered evaluable for 
tumour response if they completed at least one cycle of therapy, or if they experienced progressive 
disease prior to that time. 
Safety analyses 
All analyses are presented by dose cohort (3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg). No formal comparisons are made 
between dose cohorts with the exception of the primary endpoint of imARs. Otherwise, no formal 
statistical testing was performed, only summary statistics are provided. 
The on-study reporting period for safety data was from the first dose of study medication to 90 days 
(> 5 half-lives) after the last dose was received. 
The primary assessment of safety was severe imARs. The rate of severe imAR was calculated as a 
proportion of patients having a grade 3 or worse immune mediated adverse reaction divided by the 
total number of treated patients along with its Clopper-Pearson exact two-sided 95% confidence 
interval to support the primary safety endpoint. 
Descriptive statistics of safety were presented for treated patients in each treatment group (3 or 10 
mg/kg ipilimumab). All on-study AEs, drug-related AEs, immune-related AEs, SAEs, drug-related SAEs, 
irAEs, and imARs were tabulated using worst grade per NCI CTCAE by MedDRA version 19.0 system 
organ class (SOC) and by preferred term (PT). 
Summary tables of multiple occurrences of AEs were presented for each treatment group showing the 
total number and rate (exposure adjusted) of occurrences for all on-study AEs as well as the number 
of patients experiencing an irAE once or multiple times during on-study period. 
irAEs were programmatically determined from a predefined list of MedDRA PTs representing AEs 
potentially associated with inflammation and based on program-wide experience with ipilimumab 
(identified by the safety and medical representatives from) that were considered as causally related to 
study drug exposure by the investigator. These terms were grouped into the following organ-specific 
subcategories: gastrointestinal, skin, liver, endocrine, neurological, and other. Formal exclusion of a 
non-inflammatory aetiology was not required for identifying irAEs. 
On-study laboratory parameters, including haematology, serum chemistry, liver function, and renal 
function were summarised using worst CTC grade.

Subject disposition all enrolled subjects 
Recruitment 
In this study, 40 participants were planned to be enrolled in order to treat approximately 30 
participants at the 10mg/kg dose level, but was subsequently amended with the expectation that at 
least 20 participants would be treated at the 3 mg/kg dose level. Because the rarity of the patient 
population was greater than anticipated and the availability of competing therapies (eg, anti-PD-L1), 
the majority of sites was unable to enroll a participant over the 3.5 year period, and study closure was 
recommended by the data monitoring committee. At the time of study closure, 14 participants were 
enrolled in US centres and 12 were treated in the study: 4 received 3 mg/kg ipilimumab and 8 
received 10 mg/kg ipilimumab. 
Conduct of the study 
Ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg was initially chosen for the CA184178 study based on the observations that 
10 mg/kg was tolerated in adolescent patients in the study NCI7458 (CA184070) and 10 mg/kg was 
potentially more active in a randomised phase 2 study (CA184022) of ipilimumab in adult melanoma, 
with a tolerable safety profile. Given that ipilimumab 3 mg/kg was broadly approved across treatment 
lines in Europe, the United States, and other countries throughout the world, the MAH amended the 
protocol in 2014 (amendment 04) to change the dose of ipilimumab from 10 to 3 mg/kg to ensure 
consistency with the approved adult dose. Inclusion of the 3 mg/kg dose in this study was further 
supported by similarities between adults and adolescents with advanced melanoma, based upon 
comparable general clinical characteristics as well as maturation of the immune system for the two 
populations. 
Patients who discontinued study treatment due to toxicity or PD prior to completing the treatment 
phase were to have an end of treatment assessment. A strict stopping rule based upon the occurrence 
of drug-related, life threatening toxicities, irAEs (immune-related adverse events) which occur beyond 
first dose of study drug was employed. In addition, stopping rules were in place for any AE, laboratory 
abnormality or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the investigator, presented a substantial 
clinical risk to the patient.

Follow-up for progression/toxicity started after the last dose of study treatment and continued every 
12 weeks (±14 days) until documented and confirmed disease progression or AE resolution. Patients 
were followed for related AEs for a minimum of 90 days following the last dose of study treatment. 
Adverse events collection was to resume if the patient started retreatment and continue for a minimum 
of 90 days following the last dose of study treatment. Patients who completed the toxicity follow-up 
period and had PD per irRC during the treatment or retreatment phase then entered the overall 
survival follow-up phase. Adverse event assessments continued until all related AEs were resolved, 
returned to baseline, or were deemed irreversible. 
For patients who did not experience PD per irRC, tumour assessments were performed at week 12, 24 
and every 12 weeks for the first 2 years and then every 6 months until confirmed and documented 
irPD. 
Patients were followed for long-term survival information until study closure. The survival follow-up 
phase began after progression per irRC for patients who did not enter the retreatment phase. 
Patients with an initial partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) or stable disease of ≥3 months 
(beginning at week 12 with SD at week 24) who subsequently experienced confirmed PD per irRC were 
eligible to enter the retreatment phase. Eligible patients could receive up to 4 doses of ipilimumab 
during retreatment (one dose every 3 weeks as was done during the initial treatment phase). 
Retreatment had to begin within 14 days of the confirmed PD and the phase ended with 
discontinuation of ipilimumab at study closure or when the patient entered the toxicity/progression 
follow-up phase. 
Patients who discontinued study treatment due to toxicity or PD prior to completing the treatment 
phase were to have an end of treatment assessment. A strict stopping rule based upon the occurrence 
of drug-related, life threatening toxicities, irAEs (immune-related adverse events) which occur beyond 
first dose of study drug was employed. In addition, stopping rules were in place for any AE, laboratory 
abnormality or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the investigator, presented a substantial 
clinical risk to the patient. 
Follow-up for progression/toxicity started after the last dose of study treatment and continued every 
12 weeks (±14 days) until documented and confirmed disease progression or AE resolution. Patients 
were followed for related AEs for a minimum of 90 days following the last dose of study treatment. 
Adverse events collection was to resume if the patient started retreatment and continue for a minimum 
of 90 days following the last dose of study treatment. Patients who completed the toxicity follow-up 
period and had PD per irRC during the treatment or retreatment phase then entered the overall 
survival follow-up phase. Adverse event assessments continued until all related AEs were resolved, 
returned to baseline, or were deemed irreversible. 
Patients continued study treatment until they either experienced intolerable toxicity, confirmed disease 
progression or the patient requested to stop study treatment.

Protocol deviations 
Two patients had a significant protocol deviation. One patient in the 10 mg/kg group was diagnosed 
with Stage 3, M0 metastatic melanoma and underwent surgical excision prior to enrolling in the study, 
and had no evaluable/measurable lesions at baseline. Despite the resection, her baseline CT scan 
showed anomalies in the parotid area that were sufficient to indicate that some tumour may have 
remained, and because the anatomy in the surgical area was distorted, it was impossible to confirm 
complete surgical excision of the tumour nor perform measurements. Because of this observation and 
because she was a member of the analysis population, i.e., the treated population, she was, therefore, 
included in the efficacy, safety and PK analyses. As the anatomy in the surgical area was similarly 
distorted during subsequent evaluations and the presence of tumour could not be confirmed or ruled 
out, she was considered to have stable disease through the end of the study. 
The second patient was not re-consented in a timely fashion during the follow-up phase. 
Four amendments were made to this study (Table 9).

Baseline data 
The baseline and disease characteristics are presented below (Table 10). Median overall age was 15.0 
years, with a range of 12 to 16 years. Baseline Lansky/Karnofsky scores ranged from 90 to 100 
overall. Baseline LDH was normal for 83.3% of patients. Median time from pathological diagnosis to 
first dose of ipilimumab was 10.45 months, and from diagnosis of advanced melanoma to first dose of 
ipilimumab was 2.35 months. Consistent with the inclusion criteria, all patients were stage III or IV at 
study entry. 
One patient in the 10 mg/kg group was not evaluable because baseline tumour assessment of the 
target lesion was made using MRI and the follow-up evaluation was made using PET, and thus, a 
comparison of the size of the target lesions could not be made. A second patient in the 10 mg/kg 
group was diagnosed with stage III, M0 metastatic melanoma and underwent surgical excision prior to 
enrolling in the study, and had no evaluable/measurable lesions at baseline. As the anatomy in the 
surgical area was similarly distorted during subsequent evaluations and the presence of tumour could 
not be confirmed or ruled out, she was considered to have stable disease through the end of the study 
(see also paragraph about protocol deviation).

Prior anti-cancer therapies 
All treated patients had prior surgery, with 58.3% also receiving systemic therapy and 1 (8.3%) 
receiving radiotherapy (Table 11).

Table 11: 
Prior anti-cancer therapies CA184178 
Concomitant therapies 
All patients received non-study medications between first dose date and 90 days after last dose of 
study therapy. These medications were primarily given for the ongoing clinical management of disease 
symptoms or the treatment of AEs. The classes of concomitant medications used by most patients 
were analgesics and systemic antihistamines. No patient received anti-cancer therapy during 
ipilimumab treatment. Two patients received anti-cancer treatment within the reporting period of 90 
days. one patient received temozolomide approximately one month after the last ipilimumab 10 mg/kg 
dose while another received dabrafenib and trametinib almost one month after the last and only dose 
of ipilimumab 10 mg/kg. 
Subsequent therapies 
In study CA184178, subsequent therapy could be initiated for progressive disease, the need for 
surgical excision, or maintenance therapy after discontinuation due to an AE related to ipilimumab or 
to maintain response after treatment with another agent subsequent to failing ipilimumab treatment. 
Collection of information about subsequent therapy for treatment of melanoma was an essential 
component of patient follow-up, and patients were followed for 90 days or more. All patients in the 3 
mg/kg group and 6/8 patients received some type of subsequent therapy. Treatments included 
chemotherapy (dabrafenib, trametinib, aldesleukin, temozolomide, paclitaxel), immunotherapy 
(pembrolizumab, nivolumab, MK-3475 [MEKPD]), radiotherapy, surgery, and other (fomustine 
[chemoembolisation]). 
Numbers analysed 
Enrolment in 32 sites across 10 countries was planned (Table 12), and 80% of sites were activated as 
of December 2013. Because the rarity of adolescent patients with melanoma was greater than 
anticipated, as well as the availability of competing new emerging therapies (e.g., anti-PD-L1), the 
majority of sites were unable to enrol a patient over the 3.5-year period, and study closure was 
recommended by the DMC. At the time of study closure (April 2016), 14 patients were enrolled and 12 
were treated in the study:8 patients in the 10 mg/kg and 4 of the 20 planned patients in the 3 mg/kg 
cohort. All treated patients completed 1-year survival follow-up. No additional patients were enrolled 
after April 2015. The number of treated patients per country is presented in Table 12.

Outcomes and estimation 
All 12 treated patients have been followed for survival for more than 1 year. The survival rate at 1 year 
was 75.0% (95% CI: 12.8, 96.1) in the ipilimumab 3 mg/kg group and 62.5% (95% CI: 22.9, 86.1) in 
the ipilimumab 10 mg/kg group (Table 13).

All treated patients (having received at least one dose of ipilimumab) were included in the efficacy 
analysis, see also paragraph about baseline characteristics for more information on two patients with 
difficulties in tumour evaluation analyses. Efficacy assessments showed stable disease (SD) in 1/4 
patients treated with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg, and 1/8 patients treated with ipilimumab 10 mg/kg. None of 
the patients treated with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg experienced a partial response (PR). Two patients 
treated with ipilimumab 10 mg/kg experienced a partial response (PR), and the PR for one patient was 
durable (ongoing for more than 1 year, at time of study closure). BORR was 0% (95% CI: 0, 60.2) in 
the 3 mg/kg group and 25% (95% CI: 3.2, 65.1) in the 10 mg/kg group. DCR was 25% (95% CI: 0.6,

Supportive study 
Supportive study: CA184070 
Study NCI7458 (or CA184070) was a phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation (doses of 1, 3, 
5 and 10 mg/kg) study conducted with ipilimumab in children, adolescents, and young adults, ranging 
in age from 1 to 21 year with untreatable, relapsed or refractory solid malignant tumours (including 
melanoma) without a curative option with standard therapy. The study was conducted under the 
supervision of the Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  
Study design 
The primary objective was to determine the toxicity profile and the maximum tolerated dose of 
ipilimumab at a range of doses up to, but not exceeding, the highest dose tolerated in adults in 
patients ≤21 years of age with untreatable, refractory or relapsed solid malignant tumours. The 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of ipilimumab was also evaluated. 
Secondary objectives included evaluation of anti-tumour activity (in terms of ORR) and of the 
immunomodulatory (pharmacodynamics) activity of ipilimumab. 
Ipilimumab was administered intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 
cycles in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or disease progression. From cycle 5 onward (with 
cycle 5 at week 12), ipilimumab was administered approximately every 12 weeks (maintenance 
dosing). Ipilimumab doses ranging from 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg in 4 dose levels (1, 3, 5, or 10 mg/kg) 
were planned. Three to 6 patients were to be enrolled at each dose level. If none of the first 3 patients 
who were evaluable for toxicity at a given dose level had a DLT within 6 weeks following the first dose 
date, dose escalation was performed. No intra-patient dose escalation was allowed. If a DLT related to 
ipilimumab was observed in 1 patient from a cohort of 3 patients at a given dose level, an additional 3 
patients were to be entered at that dose level. If none of these additional patients experienced a 
DLT(≤1/6 with DLT), the dose of ipilimumab was to be escalated. However, if ≥1 of the additional 
patients experienced a DLT (≥2/6 with DLT), the highest dose tolerated was determined to be 
exceeded, and the next lower dose level would be considered the highest tolerated dose for 
ipilimumab. The cohort of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was to be expanded to enrol a total of 
12 patients. 
A range of doses (1-10 mg/kg) was planned to explore tolerability in the paediatric population. 
Because of the potential for irreversible or life threatening effects of ipilimumab, a starting dose of 1 
mg/kg, the lowest dose at which evidence for biologic activity has been observed, was selected, as no 
anti-tumour effects have been observed in doses lower than 1 mg/kg. The upper limit of the dose 
range was 10 mg/kg, the highest tolerated dose tested in adults. 
Because there appeared to be a different toxicity profile in patients <12 years old, the expansion 
cohort of 10 mg/kg was divided into 2 cohorts in 2011. As a result, the 5 mg/kg dose cohort was 
expanded to a total of 14 patients that included 6 patients <12 years, and the 10 mg/kg dose cohort 
was expanded to include more patients ≥12 years old. 
Re-induction therapy (ipilimumab every 3 weeks for 4 cycles) was allowed: a) in patients experiencing 
disease progression during the maintenance phase; b) in patients who stopped the maintenance phase 
due to complete response and subsequently experienced disease progression; c) in patients with an 
initial partial response (PR), CR, or stable disease (SD) for at least 3 months with subsequent 
progression.

All patients who received at least 1 dose of ipilimumab were considered evaluable for safety. The 
maximum study duration was 2 years total duration of therapy. 
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as a drug-related AE according to the National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 3.0 until 31-July-
2010 and Version 4.0 from 1-August-2010, that occurred during induction with ipilimumab: 
−  Non-haematologic DLT: Any non-haematologic Grade 3 or 4 toxicity or Grade 2 toxicity requiring 
immunosuppressive or hormone replacement therapy judged to be at least possibly related to 
ipilimumab. 
−  Haematologic DLT: Grade 4 neutropaenia or thrombocytopaenia, which persisted for 5 days at any 
time during the treatment cycle or any grade 5 toxicity at least possibly attributable to ipilimumab. 
Grade 3 haematologic toxicity was not considered dose limiting. 
The MTD of ipilimumab was defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which ≥2 
patients in a cohort (dose level) of two to 6 patients experienced a DLT attributable to ipilimumab. 
Immune-related AEs were defined using a predefined list of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) high-level group terms, high-level terms, and preferred terms (PTs). 
The development of immune function was to be evaluated prior to all cycles, based on the following 
laboratory tests: Rheumatoid factor, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA). If ANA values were positive (>2) 
subsequent to baseline evaluation, the following tests were also to be performed prior to all cycles of 
ipilimumab treatment: anticardiolipin antibody (ACA), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), 
complement 3 (C3), C4, anti-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), anti-Sjögren's syndrome (SS)A, and anti-
SSB. 
Corticosteroids (oral or IV) could be used for treatment of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). In 
addition, alternative immunosuppressive therapies (e.g., infliximab, mycophenolate mofetil, 
tacrolimus) could be used to treat irAEs that do not respond to initial steroid therapy. 
Results 
Disposition and baseline/demographic characteristics 
A total of 33 patients were enrolled: 13 (39.4%) of the 33 patients in the study were <12 years old 
and 20 (60.6%) were ≥12 years (Table 18). No patients were ≥1 and <2 years old. All patients were 
treated at 3 study sites in the United States. 
Overall, 57.6% of patients were female and 69.7% Whites. Most (92.9%) of patients in the 5 mg/kg 
group were female, and in the 10 mg/kg group, most were male (76.9%). Overall, 39.4% were <12 
years old and 60.6% were ≥12 years. The minimum age was 2.4 years; one patient in the 3 mg/kg 
group was 21.8 years old. All patients had baseline Lansky/Karnofsky scores ≥50, as required by the 
inclusion criteria.

Demographic and baseline characteristics by dose level NCI7458/CA1840701 
Melanoma was the most common tumour type (12/33 patients), followed by osteosarcoma (n=8), soft 
tissue sarcoma (n=7), renal cell of the kidney (n=1), clear cell of the kidney (n=1), neuroblastoma 
(n=1), and solid tumour not otherwise specified (NOS) (n=3), see also Table 19. All patients had 
received anti-cancer treatment prior to enrolment. All patients had prior surgery. Among patients with 
prior radiation, 1 had extensive radiation, 4 limited radiation, and 13 radiation (NOS). All 12 melanoma 
patients were treated with IL-2 or interferon (IFN) alpha prior to enrolment, and most of the patients 
with other tumour types (63.6%) were treated with standard multi-agent chemotherapy regimens for 
their particular tumour type. The patient with a neuroblastoma was enrolled and treated following an 
autologous stem cell rescue. 
Table 19: 
Tumour types by age groups NCI7458/CA1840701 
Specifically for the 5 melanoma patients older than 12 years, 3 were whites, most were ~13 years, 
and baseline Lansky/Karnofsky scores ranged from 70 to 90 (Table 20, Table 21). All patients had 
cancer treatment, including treatment with IL-2 or interferon alpha, as well as surgery prior to 
enrolment. Two in the 5 mg/kg and one in the 10 m/kg group had prior radiation therapy. The 5 
patients were treated with 5 or 10 mg/kg. No patients above 12 years of age and with advanced 
melanoma was treated with 3 mg/kg.

Dose escalation NCI7458/CA184070 
In the dose escalation study NCI7458/CA184070 (Figure 11) at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg, 3 patients 
each were enrolled, regardless of age group. Since no DLTs were observed, the dose was escalated to 
5 mg/kg. 
At 5 mg/kg, the first cohort of patients to assess DLTs was 4 instead of 3. The second patient enrolled 
died of progressive disease before 6 weeks on study and was not evaluable. Therefore, the patient was 
replaced by another patient at this dose level. Since only the 4th patient treated at 5 mg/kg 
experienced a DLT, an additional 3 patients were enrolled at this dose; however, as none of these 
experienced a DLT, the dose was escalated to 10 mg/kg. 
At 10 mg/kg, one of the first 3 patients enrolled experienced a DLT within 6 weeks of first dose; this 
patient was <12 year old. Since a DLT was reported for <2 of the 3 patients enrolled and treated at 10 
mg/kg, additional patients were enrolled into the 10 mg/kg dose group. A second patient <12 year old 
experienced a DLT at 10 mg/kg, as enrolment continued into this dose cohort. Therefore, the protocol 
was amended to limit further treatment of patients <12 year old to the 5 mg/kg dose, thereby limiting 
expansion of treatment at 10 mg/kg to patients ≥12 years old. Shortly thereafter, the first DLT in a 
patient ≥12 years old was reported.

Dose expansion phase by age 
Since no young children had been enrolled in the 5 mg/kg dose cohort, after escalation to 10 mg/kg, 
an amendment was put in place to enrol 6 additional patients <12 years at the 5 mg/kg dose. This 
expansion allowed further exploration of safety and PK at these age group to determine if 5 mg/kg was 
a tolerated dose for <12-year-old age group. By the time the MTD for patients <12 years old was 
established, and further treatment had been separated by age groups, and the 10 mg/kg dose level 
was expanded to enrol additional patients ≥12 years old, besides the initial 3 patients needed to 
establish the highest tolerated dose tested, 4 patients <12 years old had been treated at 10 mg/kg. 
Additional patients ≥12 years old were needed to allow further exploration at this dose, and therefore, 
6 additional patients ≥12 years old were enrolled into the 10 mg/kg group for a total of additional 9 
patients during the dose expansion phase. 
Dose limiting toxicities 
A total of thirteen patients <12 years of age and 20 patients ≥12 years were treated with ipilimumab. 
In summary, no DLTs were identified in the 1 and 3 mg/kg dose cohorts. For patients ≥1 to <12 years 
old, the MTD was determined to be 5 mg/kg. Tolerability of the 5 mg/kg dose in this age group was 
confirmed by expansion of the cohort to a total of 13 patients. DLTs were observed in: 
−  1 of a total of 6 patients in this age group treated with 5 mg/kg (anaphylactic reaction) 
−  2 of a total of 4 patients in this age group treated with 10 mg/kg cohort (diarrhoea; increased 
ALT/AST) 
The highest tolerated dose tested for patients ≥12 to ≤21 years old was 10 mg/kg. DLTs were 
observed in: 
Assessment report  
EMA/6592/2018  
Page 46/81 
 
 
 
 
 
−  2 of a total of 8 patients in this age group treated with 5 mg/kg (amylase increased and abdominal 
pain; autoimmune disorder) 
−  2 of a total of 9 patients in this age group treated with 10 mg/kg (pleural effusion; diarrhoea) 
For older children (>12 years of age), 10 mg/kg was established in this study as the highest tested 
tolerated dose. 
Tumour responses 
Patients were considered evaluable for tumour response if they completed at least one cycle of 
therapy, or if they experienced progressive disease prior to that time. None of the patients reached an 
objective response (PR or CR) per RECIST criteria. Eleven patients had SD as the best overall response 
(BOR). All patients with SD were treated at doses >1 mg/kg (the minimum dose established to be 
effective for advanced melanoma in adults). Only 1 of the 13 patients <12 years old achieved SD. 
Stable disease was achieved in 2 of 12 patients with melanoma, and 9 of the 21 patients with other 
types of solid tumours. Of 9 patients with SD in patients with non-melanoma solid tumours, 2 were 
unconfirmed. 
Overall, stable disease was of short duration for most patients. Stable disease >6 months duration was 
observed in 2 patients. One patient with melanoma achieved a duration of SD for nearly 2 years (>22 
months). The other patient had an unspecified solid tumour and although SD was achieved, disease 
progressed within 7 months. 
In most cases of non-melanoma patients that achieved SD, SD was maintained for about 3 months or 
less, and for 3 of the 9 patients the duration of SD was <2 months. For 4 of the 9 non-melanoma 
patients with SD, all 4 were discontinued due to an AE rather than disease progression and did not 
continue tumour assessment. Therefore, duration of SD could not be assessed for these patients. Of 
note, many of the non-melanoma patients enrolled in the study were known with protracted disease 
course regardless of treatment. 
Best overall responses other than SD were: 
−  PD: 16 patients; 7 of 13 patients with melanoma, 9 of 21 patients with non-melanoma, with study 
day of progression between Day 22 and Day 51 
−  Assessment not evaluable/performed (patients had only 1 infusion); one melanoma patient died 
due to disease progression on Day 7 after start of treatment 
In summary, for melanoma patients, 2 out of 3 patients developed stable disease in the 5 mg/kg group 
and none of the patients had PR or CR. For one patient SD was >22 months, the other patient with SD 
had a duration of response of 104 days. In the 10 mg/kg group, none of the 2 melanoma patients had 
a response (Table 22).

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Ipilimumab for melanoma in the paediatric population was planned to be studied in three clinical 
studies: 
1.  NCI7458/CA184070: multicenter, phase 1, open-label, dose escalation study of ipilimumab 
1, 3, 5, and 10 mg/kg in paediatric patients ≥1 year to ≤ 21 years of age with 
measurable/evaluable, untreatable, relapsed or refractory solid malignant tumours without a 
curative option with standard therapy. The study enrolled 13 patients <12 of age and 20 
patients ≥12 years of age. Ipilimumab was administered every 3 weeks for 4 doses and then 
every 12 weeks thereafter in the absence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and disease 
progression.  
2.  CA184178: was a non-randomised, multicenter, open-label phase 2 study, in adolescent 
patients 12 to < 18 years of age with previously treated or untreated, unresectable stage III or 
Stage IV malignant melanoma. Ipilimumab was administered every 3 weeks for 4 doses.  
3.  E1609/CA184116: Phase 3, randomised clinical study of ipilimumab versus high-dose 
interferon alpha in the adjuvant setting in children with high-risk surgically-resected melanoma 
The initial sample size for evaluating ipilimumab in the paediatric clinical trials was 30 melanoma 
patients. However, due to difficulties in recruitment because of the rarity of melanoma in children and 
he development of other therapeutic alternatives such as anti-PD-1 antibodies, the PDCO agreed to the 
MAH request to remove the indication of paediatric patients with melanoma in the adjuvant setting 
from the PIP and to reduce the number of treated patients in study CA184178 from 30 to 12.Efficacy 
results were reported for the melanoma patients older than 12 years in the NCI7458/CA184070 and all 
included patients of the CA184178 study. The E1609/CA184116 study was discontinued and only 
safety data were reported (see safety section).

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study CA184178 enrolled 14 patients but only 12 patients were treated between the ages of 12-16 
years of age: 4 in the 3 mg/kg group and 8 in the 10 mg/kg group. Two patients were not evaluable, 
both in the 10 mg/kg group. One patient was not evaluable because of different tumour evaluation 
techniques used at baseline and follow-up. Another patient had no measurable disease at baseline 
since surgery was performed prior to enrolment. The study excluded patients with active brain 
metastases and prior therapy with CTLA-4, PD-(L)1, or CD137 targeted agents. The patient population 
of adolescents treated is considered acceptable. The MAH amended the study protocol to change the 
proposed dose of 10 mg/kg to the approved adult dose of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg to ensure consistency 
with the approved dose. This change in dose is acceptable and does not impact on the results of the 
study as the popPK data has shown that paediatric patients receive a similar exposure for both doses. 
Patients who tolerated the 10 mg/kg dose stayed at that dose and no dose reduction was allowed. Of 
the 4 patients in the 3 mg/kg group, 3 received the 4 planned infusions. Of the 8 patients who 
received 10 mg/kg, 3 patients received the 4 planned infusions demonstrating that the 3 mg/kg dose 
is more tolerable than the 10 mg/kg. Half of the patients discontinued from study treatment due to 
toxicity and 33.3% due to disease progression. For 6 patients that discontinued because of toxicity, 
this was considered to be drug-related. Four patients required interruption of the infusions: one in the 
3 mg/kg group and 3 in the 10 mg/kg group. The primary efficacy endpoint was 1-year survival rate. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints of best overall response rate (BORR), stable disease (SD), disease 
control rate (DCR), and progression free survival (PFS) were based on mWHO criteria and determined 
by the investigator’s assessment. Overall survival (OS) was also evaluated. Tumour assessment was 
performed at week 12. All patients were followed for at least 1 year. The primary and secondary 
endpoints were considered acceptable.  Study NCI7458/CA184070 enrolled 33 patients, 8 of a total of 
33 patients across all ages received all 4 of the planned induction (treatment) doses of ipilimumab, and 
all 8 were ≥12 years old. Two of the 8 patients had melanoma, both in the 5 mg/kg group, and the 
remaining had other solid malignant tumours. In total of three patients were treated with 5 mg/kg and 
2 with 10 mg/kg. Five of the 33 patients had advanced melanoma and were in the age of 13 to 15.7 
years. Three of 5 were treated with 5 mg/kg and 2 with 10 mg/kg. Of the 5 patients, 3 were white, 
most were ~13 years old, and baseline Lansky/Karnofsky scores ranged from 70 to 90. Of patients 12 
years of age and older with advanced melanoma, ipilimumab 5 mg/kg was administered to three 
patients and ipilimumab 10 mg/kg was administered to two patients. The patient population was 
considered acceptable. The primary objective was to determine the toxicity profile and the maximum 
tolerated dose of ipilimumab at ranges up to, but not exceeding, the highest dose tolerated in adults in 
patients ≤21 years. The primary endpoints (measuring DLT) and secondary endpoint (ORR) were 
considered acceptable.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
For study CA184070, there were no patients that had objective responses by RECIST criteria. Stable 
disease was achieved in two patients at the ipilimumab 5mg/kg dose, one with a duration of > 22 
months.  Study CA184178 patients were followed for at least 1 year. Stable disease was achieved for 
260 days in one patient on ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and approximately 14 months in one patient on 
ipilimumab 10 mg/kg. Two patients treated with ipilimumab 10 mg/kg experienced a partial response, 
one of which was a durable response for more than 1 year. For patients receiving 3 mg/kg and 10 
mg/kg, PFS was approximately the same at 2.6 months and 2.9 months, respectively, which is 
comparable to the PFS observed in the adult population. Median OS was 18.2 months in the 3 mg/kg 
group and was not reached for the 10 mg/kg group (see SmPC section 5.1).  
Assessment report  
EMA/6592/2018  
Page 49/81 
 
 
 
 
The available efficacy data in adolescents in the age range of 12 to 18 years with advanced melanoma 
is limited and efficacy cannot be conclusively established. Anti-tumour activity was observed with an 
objective response in 2 of 8 patients and best response of SD in 1 additional patient in CA184178 
treated with 10 mg/kg, but none of the 2 patients treated with 10 mg/kg in NCI7458/CA184070 
showed a response. For the applied posology of 3 mg/kg, only 4 patients in the indicated age range 
were treated with 1 response of SD (260 days). For 5 mg/kg, 2 of 3 patients showed SD.  
Therefore, given the mechanism of action and the PK data showing overlapping ipilimumab exposure in 
paediatric patients with the ipilimumab exposures in adults, efficacy results can be extrapolated from 
the adult population. In the adult population, median OS after ipilimumab monotherapy (3 mg/kg) was 
10.12 months (CI 95%: 8.02, 13.80) with a 1-year OS rate of 46% (CI 95%: 37.0, 54.1). Median PFS 
was 2.86 months (CI 95%: 2.76, 3.02). In 137 treated patients, tumour evaluation showed CR in 
1.5%, PR in 9.5%, SD in 17.5%, PD in 51.1% of patients respectively, and 20.4% was not evaluable. 
BORR was 10.9% (CI 95: 6.3, 17.4) [EPAR Ipilimumab; SmPC Ipilimumab]. 
Regarding posology, a study specifically comparing 3 versus 10 mg/kg ipilimumab in adults was 
recently published7 . This randomised, double-blind, multicentre, phase 3 trial was performed in adult 
patients with untreated or previously treated unresectable stage III or IV melanoma, without previous 
treatment with BRAF inhibitors or immune checkpoint inhibitors. In total 364 patients were treated 
with 10 mg/kg and 362 with 3 mg/kg. Median follow-up was 14.5 months for the 10 mg/kg group and 
11.2 months for the ipilimumab 3 mg/kg group. Median overall survival was 15.7 months (95% CI 
11.6–17.8) for 10 mg/kg compared with 11.5 months (95% CI 9.9–13.3) for ipilimumab 3 mg/kg 
(hazard ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.70–0.99; p=0.04). 1-year overall survival was 54.3% (95% CI 49.0–
59.3) in the 10 mg/kg group versus 47.6% (42.4–52.7) in the 3 mg/kg group. Median progression-free 
survival was 2.8 months (95% CI 2.8–3.0) in the 10 mg/kg group and 2.8 months (2.8–2.8) in the 3 
mg/kg group. Although direct comparisons cannot be made, these results suggest in adults that the 
higher dose of 10 mg/kg shows increased efficacy benefit at the cost of increased toxicity (see 
discussion on safety). 
As few patients were enrolled in the studies CA184070 and CA184178, no definitive conclusions can be 
drawn about the efficacy and appropriate dose in paediatric patients based on the data presented but 
since the data appears to follow a similar trend as observed in the adults population, the extrapolation 
of the efficacy and dose from the adult population to paediatric patients ≥ 12 years old seems to be 
well justified. Only very limited data are available in children younger than 12 years of age. Therefore, 
ipilimumab should not be used in children younger than 12 years of age. 
Before initiating treatment with ipilimumab monotherapy in adolescents of 12 years and older, 
physicians are advised to carefully evaluate the individual patient, taking into consideration the limited 
available data, the observed benefits and the toxicity of ipilimumab monotherapy in the paediatric 
population (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).

It is possible that lower immunogenic potential and lower levels of tumour-associated mutations in 
paediatric tumours might contribute to lower clinical activity observed in paediatric patients. It has 
been described that high mutational burden in tumours increase neoantigen presentation in adult 
melanoma8 and subsequent responses9, 10. Paediatric tumours usually harbour fewer mutations and 
as a result could be less immunogenic. Unfortunately, study CA184070 did not collect tumour tissue 
samples and hence analysis of the mutational burden could not be correlated to efficacy in adolescents 
with advanced melanoma. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Although limited data is presented on paediatric patients who were treated with ipilimumab, an anti-
tumour activity in terms of BORR, SD and PFS can be observed in the studies of paediatric patients 
with advanced melanoma. Together with the PK results and efficacy data in the proposed dose in adult 
patients in the same clinical setting, it is considered acceptable to extrapolate the clinical benefit to the 
paediatric population with a similar course of disease and prognosis as for the adult population. Given 
the mechanism of action of ipilimumab and the overlapping PK exposures in paediatric and adult 
patients, it is very likely that paediatric patients may derived the same beneficial treatment effect as 
for adults and hence, the CHMP has agreed to a paediatric indication for the treatment of advanced 
(unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adolescents 12 years of age and older. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety results of the paediatric population of advanced melanoma were compared with an Adult 
Safety Pool. The MAH also reported the safety experiences in two paediatric patients with adjuvant 
ipilimumab in high risk melanoma. 
Safety analysis of ipilimumab monotherapy in advanced paediatric melanoma 
A total of 33 children, adolescents, and young adults (age range 2.4 to 21.8 years) were treated with 
ipilimumab 1, 3, 5, or 10 mg/kg in NCI7458/CA184070, of which 20 were ≥12 years old. In CA184178 
12 children and adolescents (age range 12 to 16 years) were treated with ipilimumab 3 or 10 mg/kg. 
In total, 45 paediatric patients were treated with ipilimumab across the 4 doses in both studies. In this 
safety analysis, the focus is on the safety data in the target population, children and adolescents 12 
years of age or older with advanced melanoma treated with ipilimumab 3 or 10 mg/kg.

The paediatric safety data were compared to pooled safety data from four completed phase 2 studies 
in adults (Table 23), in which ipilimumab 3 or 10 mg/kg administered as monotherapy was evaluated 
in patients with pretreated and untreated advanced melanoma (CA184004, CA184007, CA184008, and 
CA184022; n=111 patients treated at 3 mg/kg and 325 at 10 mg/kg). Demographics and baseline 
characteristics were generally similar and consistent with the paediatric studies, with the exception of 
age, height and weight. Nearly all patients were white, consistent with the racial distribution of 
melanoma and the geographical distribution of study patients. Most patients were <65 years: 76/111 
in the 3 mg/kg group and 217/325 in the 10 mg/kg group. Most patients were male: 75/111 in the 3 
mg/kg group and 185/325 in the 10 mg/kg group. The largest proportion of patients were from Europe 
(57/111) and North America (46/111) in the 3 mg/kg group and 165/325 and 143/325 in the 10 
mg/kg group. Median height of patients in the Adult Safety Pool ranged from 173.0 to 171.0 cm. 
Approximately one half of the adults weighed ≥80 kg. Prior systemic anti-cancer therapy was given to 
100/111 patients in the 3 mg/kg group and 300/325 patients in the 10 mg/kg group. Prior 
immunotherapy was given to 61/111 patients in the 3 mg/kg group and 180/325 in the 10 mg/kg 
group. 
Pooled analyses of the paediatric studies were not performed. The safety window for study 
NCI7458/CA184070 and the adults studies was 30 days after last dose, for study CA184178 the safety 
window was 90 days after the last dose.

Two of the 8 patients had melanoma, both in the 5 mg/kg group, and the remaining had other 
solid malignant tumours. Furthermore, of the 8 patients who completed treatment therapy (4 
doses), 3 entered the maintenance treatment portion of the study, according to the protocol: one 
patient with osteosarcoma metastatic treated with 10 mg/kg received a total of 5 doses, and 
another with solid tumour NOS received 6 doses. One patient in the 5 mg/kg group with 
melanoma of the head and neck received 15 doses. This patient was re-induced after the 6th 
maintenance dose, and following the 4th re-treatment dose, was re-entered into maintenance 
treatment. Cumulative dose was not analysed in this study. 
−  CA184178: Three patients in each treatment group (75% in the 3 mg/kg group and 37.5% in the 
10 mg/kg group) received 4 doses of ipilimumab. All patients received at least one dose. Median 
number of doses were 4 and 3 in the 3 and 10 mg/kg groups, respectively. Mean doses were 3.5 
and 2.8 in the 3 and 10 mg/kg groups, respectively. The cumulative dose (mg) for all 12 patients 
ranged from 336.6 to 2965.0 mg. The cumulative dose by weight (mg/kg) for all 12 patients 
ranged from 6.0 to 39.8 mg/kg and the median was 16.0 mg/kg. Median cumulative dose per 
patient (mg) was 691.25 and 1896.0 in the 3 and 10 mg/kg groups, respectively. Median 
cumulative dose per patient (mg/kg) was 11.95 and 29.75 mg/kg in the 3 and 10 mg/kg groups, 
respectively. 
−  Adult Safety Pool: Patients in the 3 mg/kg group received a median of 4 doses and a mean of 
3.5 doses; 70.3% of the patients received 4 doses. The median cumulative dose (in mg and 
mg/kg) of ipilimumab for patients in the 3 mg/kg group was 894.0 mg and 12.0 mg/kg. Patients in 
the pooled 10 mg/kg group received a median of 4 doses and a mean of 3.3 doses during the 
treatment phase; 58.2% of the patients received 4 doses. The median cumulative dose (in mg and 
mg/kg) of ipilimumab for patients in this group was 2710.0 mg and 39.9 mg/kg. 
Comparison of the exposure in the paediatric versus adult patients is shown in Table 24. A higher 
percentage of patients received all 4 treatment doses in both CA184178 and the Adult Safety Pool, 
reflective of a higher rate of discontinuation due to study drug toxicity in the 10 vs 3 mg/kg group. 
Cumulative dose was not evaluated in study NCI7458/CA184070. The lower median number of 
doses between study NCI7458/CA184070, and study CA184178 and the Adult Safety Pool may be 
driven by the dose-escalation study design of NCI7458/CA184070, in which dose-limiting toxicities 
resulted in discontinuation.

Comparison of exposure in paediatric vs adult patients 
Extent of exposure 
Overall, 8 patients received 10 mg/kg and 4 patients received 3 mg/kg. Of the 8 patients who received 
10 mg/kg, 3 patients received the 4 planned infusions of ipilimumab. Of the 4 patients who received 3 
mg/kg, three received the 4 planned infusions (Table 25). In the 3 mg/kg group the median 
cumulative dose (mg) was 691.25 mg with the min-max 336.6 to 1103.7 mg and in the 10 mg/kg 
group, the median cumulative dose was 1896.00 mg with the min-max 617 to 2965.0 mg. The 
cumulative dose median dose (mg/kg) in the 3 mg/kg group was 11.95 mg/kg with a min-max of 6.0 
to 12.0 mg/kg and in the 10 mg/kg group the median cumulative dose was 29.75 mg/kg with a min-
max of 10.0 to 39.8 mg/kg. 
No patients entered the re-treatment phase. At the time of study discontinuation one patient who had 
PR was eligible for the re-treatment phase.

Adverse events  
Adverse events for children and adolescents 12 years of age and older as well as adults are 
summarised in Table 26. 
Table 26: 
adult advanced melanoma patients 
Summary  of  adverse  events  in  paediatric  advanced  (non)melanoma  versus 
Overall, adverse events (AEs) associated with ipilimumab treatment in the paediatric and adult 
populations were generally reported less frequently at doses of 3 and 5 mg/kg compared with 10 
mg/kg. As only 1 patient ≥12 years old with a solid tumour (synovial cell sarcoma) was treated with 
ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in NCI7458/CA184070, interpretation of safety information in this case is limited. 
−  NCI7458/CA184070: All AEs reported for the single patient in the 3 mg/kg group ≥12 years old 
in this study were Grade 3 or less in intensity. Adverse events were also reported for all patients in 
the 5 and 10 mg/kg groups 12 years of age and older. There were 75.0% (6/8 patients) and 
55.6% (5/9 patients) ≥12 years old with ≥Grade 3 AEs reported in the 5 and 10 mg/kg groups, 
respectively. One of the events reported in the 5 mg/kg group was a fatal event due to malignant 
disease. No individual event ≥Grade 3 was reported in more than 1 patient in the 5 or 10 mg/kg 
group. 
−  CA184178: Adverse events were reported for all patients in both the 3 and 10 mg/kg groups. In 
both groups, most events were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity. In the 3 mg/kg group, 1 patient 
experienced one Grade 3 event. In the 10 mg/kg group, 2 patients experienced Grade 3 events 
and 3 patients experienced Grade 4 events. No Grade 5 events were reported in any treatment 
group. The rates Grade 3–5 all-causality AEs were observed more frequently among the 
ipilimumab 10 mg/kg group (100% Any Grade, 75% Grade 3–5) vs the 3 mg/kg (100% Any 
Grade, 25% Grade 3–5). 
Patients were analysed for multiple occurrences of AEs, i.e., more than 5 occurrences of the same 
AE in a single patient, and adjusted for exposure (Table 27).

Table 27: 
unique events CA184178 
Exposure-adjusted summary of on-study AEs, including multiple occurences of 
Patients in the ipilimumab 3 mg/kg group had 1.5 person-years (P-Y) of exposure, and 21 multiple 
occurrences of on-study unique AEs adjusted for exposure were reported among all patients at an 
incidence rate per 100 person-years of exposure (IR/100 P-Y) of 1400.0. 
Patients in the ipilimumab 10 mg/kg group had 2.8 P-Y of exposure and 180 multiple occurrences 
of on-study unique AEs adjusted for exposure were reported among all patients at an IR/100 P-Y of 
6428.6. The rate of exposure-adjusted, multiple occurrences of unique irAEs was higher in the 10 
mg/kg treatment group compared to the 3 mg/kg treatment group. 
−  Adult Safety Pool: In the adult pooled 3 mg/kg group, Grade 3–4 AEs were reported in 27.0% of 
patients, with fatigue (6.3%) being the most common. In the pooled 10 mg/kg group, 37.5% of 
patients reported at least 1 Grade 3–4 AE, the most common being diarrhoea (10.8%; all Grade 
3). Adverse events reported among children and adolescents were consistent with those reported 
among adults. 
Treatment-related adverse events 
−  NCI7458/CA184070: No investigator-determined drug-related AEs ≥Grade 3 were reported in 
the 3 mg/kg groups. Drug-related AEs ≥Grade 3 were reported for 42.8% (6/14) and 46.2% 
(6/13) patients in the 5 and 10 mg/kg groups, respectively. No individual event ≥Grade 3 was 
reported in more than 1 patient in the 5 or 10 mg/kg group. 
−  CA184178: Drug-related AEs were reported less frequently for ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (50.0% Any 
Grade, 25.0% Grade 3–5) versus ipilimumab 10 mg/kg (87.5% Any Grade, 62.5% Grade 3–5). No 
individual event ≥Grade 4 was reported in 3 mg/kg group, and no Grade 5 events were reported in 
10 mg/kg group. No individual event ≥Grade 3 was reported in more than 1 patient in the 10 
mg/kg group. 
−  Adult Safety Pool: Overall, 14.4% of patients in the 3 mg/kg group reported at least 1 Grade 3-4 
treatment-related AE, the most common being colitis (2.7%; Grade 3: 1.8%; Grade 4: 0.9%) and 
diarrhoea (2.7%; Grade 3 in all cases). In the pooled 10 mg/kg group, 30.5% of patients reported 
at least 1 Grade 3-4 treatment related AE, the most common being diarrhoea (10.2%; all Grade 
3). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
−  NCI7458/CA184070: No deaths were attributed to study drug toxicity by the investigator. 
Overall, death due to malignant disease was recorded for 15 patients in this study as of the 
database lock (Table 26). Two died within 30 days of the last dose. 
Assessment report

−  CA184178: Among 12 treated patients, a total of 2/4 (50.0%) and 3/8 (37.5%) deaths were 
reported in the study with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab 10 mg/kg, respectively (Table 26). 
All deaths were due to disease progression. None of the deaths occurred within 90 days of the last 
dose. 
−  Adult Safety Pool: The rate of deaths in Adult Safety Pool during the treatment phase was similar 
between the 3 and 10 mg/kg groups (Table 28) and 1.8% of deaths were attributed to ipilimumab 
treatment in both treatment groups.

Deaths during treated phase in adult patients 
Serious adverse events 
SAEs were reported in one patient each in the 3 mg/kg group of studies NCI7458/CA148070 and 
CA184178. In study NCI7458/CA184070, SAEs were reported less frequently in the 10 mg/kg groups 
compared with the 5 mg/kg group. SAEs reported in the 10 mg/kg group were reported more 
frequently in study CA184178 than in the Adult Safety Pool. 
−  NCI7458/CA184070: In the 3 mg/kg group, SAEs were reported for the patient ≥12 years. One 
had a Grade 3, device-related infection and Grade 1 abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, pyrexia, 
chills, and pain and the other had Grade 2 pneumonitis and Grade 1 pyrexia. One Grade 5 (fatal) 
event of death due to malignant disease was reported for one patient ≥12 years old in the 5 mg/kg 
dose group. No single event occurred in more than 2 patients in any of the dose groups. The only 
drug-related SAEs in the 3 mg/kg group were Grade 1 events reported in the single patient ≥12 
years (abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting). In the 5 mg/kg cohort, drug-related SAEs were 
reported in 5 of the 8 patients ≥12 years old, including 4 patients with Grade 3–4 events. These 
events included Grade 4 amylase and lipase increased, and Grade 3 autoimmune disorder, 
abdominal pain, skin infection, musculoskeletal pain, headache, and vision blurred. In the 10 
mg/kg cohort, drug-related SAEs were reported in 4 of 9 patients. All were Grade 3–4 events. 
These events included Grade 4 diarrhoea and blood creatine phosphokinase increased, and Grade 3 
diarrhoea, pleural effusion, and upper respiratory tract infection. 
−  CA184178: The rates of all-causality SAEs (Any Grade) were 1/4 (25.0%) in ipilimumab 3 mg/kg 
and 6/8 (75.0%) in ipilimumab 10 mg/kg. No Grade 5 (fatal) events were reported. The most 
common SAEs by SOC were Hepatobiliary disorders (25%), Metabolism and Nutrition disorders 
(25%), Neoplasms Benign Malignant and Unspecified (Incl. Cysts and Polyps) (25%), and 
Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal disorders (25%) in the 10 mg/kg group (Table 29). All SAEs 
were considered to be drug-related by the investigator except for 4 events in 2 patients in the 10 
mg/kg group. One patient experienced Grade 3 events of hyponatremia, pleural effusion, and a 
Grade 4 event of progression of metastatic melanoma, and the second patient reported Grade 3 
tumour pain.

On-study SAEs CA184178 
−  Adult Safety Pool: In the pooled 3 mg/kg group, the frequency of all-causality SAEs was 45.0% 
and 17.1% for treatment-related SAEs overall. Colitis and diarrhoea were each reported as 
treatment-related in 4.5% of patients, with most individual SAEs reported in no more than 1 
patient each. As with the 3 mg/kg dose, the most common (at least 2 patients) treatment-related 
SAEs in the pooled 10 mg/kg group were diarrhoea (11.4%) and colitis (7.1%). In the pooled 10 
mg/kg group, treatment-related SAEs reported under the SOCs of investigations (4.0%) and 
hepatobiliary disorders (3.1%) were reported most frequently (both were < 1% with the 3 mg/kg 
dose).

Immune-related adverse events 
irAEs were reported in similar proportions in the 3 and 10 mg group mg/kg groups in study CA184178 
and less frequently in the 3 mg/kg group (61.3%) in the Adult Safety Pool compared with the 10 
mg/kg group (72.0%) in the pool. In study NCI7458/CA184070, irAEs were reported less frequently in 
the 5 (87.5%) and 10 mg/kg (77.8%) groups compared with the single patient in the 3 mg/kg (100%) 
group. No irAEs in either paediatric study were fatal. Few irAEs in the paediatric studies were Grade 3–
4 in intensity: 25% in the 3 mg/kg group and 11.1% in the 10 mg/kg group in NCI7458/CA184070 
and in CA184178, 25.0% in the 3 mg/kg group and 37.5% in the 10 mg/kg group. All were managed 
according to the protocol-defined treatment guidelines. The frequencies of irAEs in the paediatric and 
adult populations are difficult to compare due to the small paediatric sample size. 
−  NCI7458/CA184070: No new or unexpected irAEs were observed in this study (Table 30).

irAEs  after  up  to  4  does  of  3,  5,  and  10  mg/kg 
in 
NCI7458/CA184070 vs adults 
A Grade 1 irAE of autoimmune disorder was reported for one patient ≥12 years old treated with 
ipilimumab 3 mg/kg. In the 5 mg/kg cohort, irAEs were reported in 87.5% of the 8 patients, of 
whom 2 (25.0%) had Grade 3–4 irAEs: Grade 4 amylase and lipase increased (in the same 
patient), Grade 3 ALT increased, AST increased, and autoimmune disorder. In the 10 mg/kg 
cohort, irAEs was reported in 77.8% of the 9 patients, 1 (11.1%) of whom had a Grade 4 and a 
Grade 3 diarrhoea. No fatal irAEs were observed. GI perforation, a known albeit rare (<1%) 
complication of colitis observed in adult patients, occurred in one patient treated in this study. A 
serious irAE of colonic perforation was reported for one patient > 30 days after the last dose of 
ipilimumab. The patient, a white female 20.8 years of age in the 5 mg/kg dose group, with a 
clinical course complicated by events of liver toxicity (Grade 1 event of ALT increased 
[transaminitis]) on Days 22 and 42 and GI disorder (Grade 1 diarrhoea) on Day 34, was 
discontinued from the study on Day 49 for an [unspecified] autoimmune disorder. In addition, 
Grade 3 events of AST increased and ALT increased, as well as Grade 3 elevations in AST and ALT 
laboratory test values, were reported for this patient on Day 49. An irAE of serious Grade 4 large 
intestine perforation (verbatim term: colonic perforation) was reported on Day 107, 85 days after 
last dose of ipilimumab and 58 days after discontinuation from the study. The event of large 
intestine perforation was reported as resolved. A Grade 2 event of hypophysitis was reported for 
one patient treated with ipilimumab 5 mg/kg. A drug-related Grade 2 event of diabetes insipidus 
was also reported for this patient, as well as a Grade 3 SAE of headache prior to the event of 
hypophysitis on Day 75, which resulted in discontinuation from the study. Autoimmune disorder 
was reported for 3 patients in the 5 mg/kg group, one of which was Grade 3 in intensity. A Grade 2

irAE of autoimmune disorder was also reported for 1 patient in the 10 mg/kg group. Low-grade, 
on-study skin irAEs were reported in 2 patients treated with ipilimumab 5 mg/kg and 3 patients 
treated with ipilimumab 10 mg/kg. 
−  CA184178: No new or unexpected irAEs were observed in this study. Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg had 
2/4 (50.0%) Any Grade and 1/4 (25.0%) Grade 3–5 irAEs compared to 4/8 (50.0%) Any Grade 
and 3/8 (37.5%) Grade 3–5 in the ipilimumab 10 mg/kg group. No Grade 5 events were reported 
in either treatment group (Table 31).

Summary of irAEs  after up  to  4 doses  of 3,  5,  and  10  mg/kg in CA184178 vs 
adults 
In the 3 mg/kg group the most common irAEs by SOC were Immune system disorders 2/4 (50%) 
and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 2/4 (50%). In the 10 mg/kg group the most common 
irAEs by SOC were Gastrointestinal disorders 3/8 (37.5%) and Investigations 3/8 (37.5%). On-
study liver irAEs of any grade across all dose levels occurred in 4 patients who experienced 
hepatitis, cholestasis, ALT increased, AST increased, hepatic enzyme increased and transaminases 
increased. On-study skin irAEs of any grade across all dose levels occurred in 2 patients in the 3 
mg/kg treatment group and 2 patients in the 10 mg/kg group who experienced Grade 1 rash and 
pruritus (Table 32). Two patients in the 10 mg/kg group who experienced a Grade 1 and Grade 3 
on study endocrine irAE of hyperglycaemia. No on-study neurological irAEs were reported in any 
treatment group. Two patients ≥12 years in the 10 mg/kg group experienced Grade 2 diarrhoea 
and Grade 2 haematochezia on-study gastrointestinal irAEs. On-study other irAEs of any grade 
occurred in 2 patients in the 3 mg/kg group who experienced Grade 2 drug hypersensitivity and 
Grade 1 hypersensitivity. In the 10 mg/kg group 1 patient experienced Grade 1 pancreatitis, Grade 
2 amylase increased, and Grade 4 lipase increased.

Table 32: On-study irAEs CA184178 
−  Adult Safety Pool: In the pooled 3 mg/kg group, the proportion of patients with irAEs of any 
grade was 61.3% and 6.3% for Grade 3–4 irAEs. The most common irAEs in this group were skin 
(42.3%) and GI (30.6%) irAEs. As with the 3 mg/kg dose, the most common irAEs were GI and 
skin irAEs, with a frequency of 36.3% and 51.4% in the pooled 10 mg/kg group, respectively. 
Grade 3–4 irAEs were reported in 24.3% of patients in the pooled 10 mg/kg group, most of which 
were Grade 3 in intensity (Grade 3, 20.6%; Grade 4, 3.7%). The rates of Grade 3–4 GI and Grade 
3–4 hepatic irAEs were 11.7% and 6.8%, respectively. In the pooled 3 mg/kg group, 1 (0.9%) 
patient died due to large intestine perforation. One patient (0.3%) in the pooled 10 mg/kg group 
died of large intestine perforation more than 70 days after last dose. In addition, 1 (0.3%) patient 
in the pooled 10 mg/kg group underwent a colectomy to treat GI bleed. 
The frequency of unique irAEs was analysed in the paediatric studies: 
−  NCI7458/CA184070: 3 patients ≥12 years old experienced a unique irAE more than once. 
Multiple occurrences of irAEs were reported for events of increased ALT, increased AST, and 
diarrhoea. All 3 events are well-known irAEs associated with ipilimumab treatment: 
• 
Two to 3 occurrences of events of increased ALT were reported for 1 patient ≥12 years in 
the 5 mg/kg group. 
Assessment report

• 
Two to 3 occurrences of events of increased AST were reported for 1 patient ≥12 years 
each in he 5 and 10 mg/kg groups. 
•  At least 4 occurrences of events of diarrhoea were reported for each of 2 patients ≥12 
years in the 5 mg/kg group. 
−  CA184178: 4 of 12 patients experienced a unique irAE more than once. One patient in the 
ipilimumab 3 mg/kg group experienced 2 to 3 occurrences of rash. In the 10 mg/kg group, 
multiple occurrences of irAEs were reported for events of increased ALT (2–3x), increased AST (2–
3x), hyperglycaemia (≥4x), and rash (2–3x). All of these events are well-known irAEs associated 
with ipilimumab treatment. 
−  Adult Safety Pool: The frequency of unique irAEs was not determined in the pooled analyses of 
adult safety. 
Multiple occurences of irAEs were analysed for the paediatric population: 
−  NCI7458/CA184070: Multiple occurrences of irAEs adjusted for exposure were analysed in study 
NCI7458/CA184070 for all patients regardless of age or dose. Patients in the study had 7.00 
person-years (P-Y) of exposure to ipilimumab among the total of 33 patients in the study ranging 
in age from 2.4 to 21.8 years who were treated at doses of 1, 3, 5 and 10 mg/kg. Among these, a 
total of 69 multiple occurrences of on-study unique irAEs adjusted for exposure were reported, at 
an incidence rate per 100 person-years of exposure (IR/100 P-Y) of 985.2. The overall rates of 
multiple events of irAEs with increased P-Y of exposure was slightly higher at doses of 5 and 10 
mg/kg compared to the lower doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg. The most common irAEs were increased 
AST (a total of 11 events with an IR/100 P-Y of 157.1), increased ALT (a total of 10 events with an 
IR/100 P-Y of 142.8), and diarrhoea (a total of 23 events with an IR/100 P-Y of 328.4). 
−  CA184178: In study CA184178, multiple occurrences of overall AEs adjusted for exposure were 
analysed in study (SCS-A Appendix 14). Patients in the ipilimumab 3 mg/kg group had 1.5 person-
years (P-Y) of exposure and those in the in the ipilimumab 10 mg/kg group had 2.8 P-Y of 
exposure. Multiple occurrences of events typical of irAEs by SOC: 
•  Gastrointestinal Disorders

Immune-mediated adverse reactions 
ImARs were not collected or analysed for NCI7458/CA184070 or the studies in the adult safety pool, as 
these studies were initiated prior to the development of the definition of imARs. For CA184178, the 
frequency of severe (Grade 3–5) imARs of ipilimumab was the primary safety objective. The proportion 
of patients treated with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg who experienced Grade 3-5 imARs was 1/4 (25.0%; 95% 
CI: 0.6, 80.6), compared to the ipilimumab 10 mg/kg group where 5/8 (62.5%; 95% CI: 24.5, 91.5) 
patients experienced Grade 3-5 imARs (Table 33). No Grade 5 events were reported in either 
treatment group. 
No patients in the 3 mg/ kg treatment group experienced a Grade 2 imAR, while in the 10 mg/kg 
group 2/8 (25.0%; 1 with diarrhoea and 1 with haematochezia) patients experienced Grade 2 events. 
There was 1 Grade 3-4 imAR of hepatitis in the 3 mg/kg group. The most common Grade 3-4 imARs in 
the 10 mg/kg group were hepatitis (2/8, 25.0%) and pyrexia (2/8, 25.0%). 
Table 33: Severe (Grade 3-5) imARs CA184178 
Laboratory findings 
In study NCI7458/CA184070, blood samples were collected during Cycles 1 and 3, Days 1 (predose 
and at completion of drug infusion), and Days 2, 3, 8, and 15. Samples were collected predose and 
weekly during Cycles 2 and 4, and pre-dose and biweekly for Cycles 5 through 8. Posttherapy 
evaluations were to be performed within 30 days after the last dose or at the time of discontinuation 
from the study. Results for all ages (2.4 to 21.8 years) across all solid tumour types are reported due 
to the limited number of participants. In study CA184178, laboratory testing was performed within 14 
days of the first dose, within 3 days prior to each treatment, and at the end of treatment visit. In the 
Adult Safety Pool, laboratory tests conducted on or after Day 2 and no later than the earliest of the 
day before the start date of re-treatment/maintenance dosing or 70 days after the last day of 
treatment dosing were considered for tabulation for the treatment period analyses. Laboratory grading 
for intensity was based on CTC version 3.0 and 4.0 in study NCI7458/CA184070, version 3.0 for study 
CA184178 and the Adult Safety Pool. 
Haematology 
−  NCI7458/CA184070: Decreases in haematological parameters during treatment were 
≤Grade 2 for most patients ≥12 years treated with ipilimumab 5 or 10 mg/kg with available 
data. Worsening shifts from baseline CTC Grade to Grade 3 or 4 in patients ≥12 years were 
observed for white blood cells (1/8 in the 10 mg/kg group), haemoglobin (2/9 in the 10 mg/kg 
group), and absolute lymphocyte counts (1/8 in the 5 mg/kg group, 1/8 in the 10 mg/kg 
group).

−  CA184178: Decreases in haematological parameters during treatment were ≤Grade 2 for 
most patients. One patient in the 10 mg/kg group experienced a Grade 4 decreased platelet 
count and Grade 4 decreased white blood cell count from Grade 0 at baseline. 
−  Adult Safety Pool: In the pooled 3 mg/kg group, ≥90% of patients had normal on-study 
WBC, ANC, and platelet counts; Grade 3-4 abnormalities in WBC, ANC, and platelets were each 
reported in ~2% of patients. On-study haemoglobin abnormalities were reported for 61.0% of 
patients and Grade 3–4 in 4.8% of patients; all but 1 of these participants had an abnormal 
baseline haemoglobin value. Most patients in the pooled 10 mg/kg group had normal on-study 
WBC, ANC, and platelet levels (92.2%, 94.2%, and 86.4% of patients, respectively). On-study 
abnormalities in WBC, ANC, and platelets were primarily Grade 1–2 in intensity; Grade 3–4 
abnormalities in WBC, ANC, and platelets were each reported in ≤1% of participants in the 
pooled 10 mg/kg group. 
Liver function tests 
−  NCI7458/CA184070: Grade 3 or 4 increases in LFT values occurred in few patients ≥12 
years treated with ipilimumab 5 or 10 mg/kg with available data. There were no apparent 
dose- or age-related changes in LFT values. Increases from baseline CTC Grade to Grade 3 
were observed for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) values; no Grade 4 values were observed for these LFTs. No Grade 
3 or 4 increases in total bilirubin (TBL) values were observed. No patients experienced LFT 
values suggestive of drug-induced liver injury (DILI; ALT or AST >3× upper limit of normal 
(ULN) and TBL >2× ULN within 14 days on or after elevation). 
−  CA184178: Grade 3 or 4 increases in LFT values occurred in few patients treated with 
ipilimumab 10 mg/kg. Increases from baseline CTC Grade to Grade 4 were observed for ALT, 
AST, and TBL values. There were no abnormal elevations (≥Grade 1) in ALP values for all 
patients. An AE of hepatitis was reported for one patient in the 3 mg/kg group with a Grade 3 
shift in ALT and AST. AEs of increased ALT and AST, cholestasis, and transaminases increased 
were reported for one patent in the 10 mg/kg group with Grade 3–4 shifts in ALT, AST, and 
TBL, and an AE of hepatitis was reported for another patient in the 10 mg/kg group with Grade 
3 shifts in ALT and TBL. No patients experienced LFT values suggestive of drug-induced liver 
injury (DILI; ALT or AST >3× upper limit of normal (ULN) and TBL >2× ULN within 14 days on 
or after elevation). 
−  Adult Safety Pool: On-study abnormalities in ALT, AST, TBL, and ALP were primarily Grade 
1–2 in intensity. In the pooled 3 mg/kg group, Grade 3–4 abnormalities in ALT and AST were 
each reported in ~2% of patients. Grade 3 abnormalities in ALP were reported in 6.7% (7/111) 
of patients in the pooled 3 mg/kg group; all 7 of the patients in the pooled 3 mg/kg group who 
had Grade 3 on-study abnormalities had abnormalities at baseline. No patients in the pooled 3 
mg/kg group met the criteria for drug-induced liver injury. As with the 3 mg/kg dose, on-study 
LFT abnormalities were primarily Grade 1–2 in intensity. In the pooled 10 mg/kg group, Grade 
3–4 abnormalities in ALT, AST, and TBL were reported in 7.5%, 7.2%, and 2.0% of patients, 
respectively. These rates are higher than with the 3 mg/kg dose, and consistent with the 
higher rate of hepatic irAEs in the pooled 10 mg/kg group (1.2%, 4/325) compared with the 
pooled 3 mg/kg group (0). Two participants in the pooled 10 mg/kg group met the criteria for 
drug-induced liver injury, with no confounding factors.

Renal function tests 
−  NCI7458/CA184070: No Grade 3 or 4 increases in creatinine values were reported for any 
patient during treatment. 
−  CA184178: No Grade 3 or 4 increases in creatinine values were reported for any patient 
during treatment. 
−  Adult Safety Pool: A Grade 3 abnormality in creatinine values was reported in 1/111 patients 
(1.0%) in the pooled 3 mg/kg group. In the pooled 10 mg/kg group, on-study abnormalities in 
creatinine levels were primarily Grade 1 in intensity. Grade 2 abnormalities were reported in 
3.6% (11/325) of patients; 1/325 (0.3%) patients, who had a normal value at baseline, had a 
Grade 4 on-study abnormality. 
Pancreatic enzymes 
−  NCI7458/CA184070: Grade 3 or 4 increases in serum lipase and amylase laboratory values 
occurred in 2 patients during treatment. One of 8 (12.5%) patients ≥12 years in the 5 mg/kg 
dose group experienced an increase from Grade 0 at baseline to Grade 4 for both serum lipase 
and serum amylase, consistent with a clinical diagnosis of pancreatitis. 
−  CA184178: Grade 3 or 4 increases in serum chemistry values occurred in 2 of 8 (25%) 
patients in the 10 mg/kg treatment group during treatment. An AE of pancreatitis was reported 
for one of these patients. 
−  Adult Safety Pool: In the pooled 3 mg/kg group, lipase abnormalities were reported in 20.8% 
(22/111) of patients; Grade 3–4 abnormalities were reported in 8.5% (9/111) of patients. In 
the pooled 3 mg/kg group, amylase abnormalities were primarily Grade 1–2; Grade 3–4 
abnormalities were reported in 2.8% (3/111) of patients. No cases of pancreatitis were 
reported in the pooled 3 mg/kg group. In the pooled 10 mg/kg group, on-study lipase 
abnormalities were reported in 22.7% (70/325) of patients; Grade 3–4 lipase abnormalities 
were reported in 6.5% (20/325) of patients. On-study abnormalities in amylase were primarily 
Grade 1–2 in intensity. Grade 3-4 amylase abnormalities were reported in 1.6% (5/325) of 
patients. Pancreatitis was reported in 2/325 (0.6%) patients in the pooled 10 mg/kg group. 
Vital signs and other observations related to safety 
No clinically relevant changes from baseline in vital signs were observed in either paediatric study nor 
in the Adult Safety Pool. 
No pregnancies were reported in either paediatric studies. 
Autoimmune and endocrine function tests 
−  NCI7458/CA184070: Samples for autoimmune testing were collected at baseline and prior 
to each cycle. In all treated patients (n=33) 3 experienced ANA values >2. Two patients had 
elevated levels at baseline, the other patient experienced elevated ANA values on Day 63 (day 
before 4th and last induction dose) and Day 93. Two patients reported elevated rheumatoid 
factor, one at baseline and one on Day 43 Abnormal endocrine laboratory values diagnostic for 
an endocrine disorder were reported in 3 patients (2 autoimmune thyroiditis, 1 hypophysitis). 
−  CA184178: The majority of patients had normal TSH, free T3, free T4, and 
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels at baseline and throughout the treatment period. 
Two patients in the 3 mg/kg group and 2 patients in the 10 mg/kg group had elevated free T3 
at baseline, which remained elevated throughout treatment.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Disease progression was the most common reason for premature discontinuation of study drug, 
followed by study drug toxicity/adverse events. The reasons for discontinuation prior to completing 
treatment with 4 doses are presented in Table 34; eligible patients in study NCI7458/CA184070 could 
have received more than 4 doses. More patients treated with ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg did not complete 
the treatment phase compared to 3 mg/kg in study CA184178 and the Adult Safety Pool. Patients may 
have received 4 doses but were not considered to have completed the treatment phase if they 
experienced progressive disease or study drug toxicity. Study drug toxicity was defined as AEs 
considered to be related by the investigator.

Table 34: Most common reasons for discontinuation in paediatric vs adult patients 
Adverse events leading to discontinuation 
AEs leading to discontinuation of study therapy were reported less frequently in the 3 mg/kg group in 
study CA184178 and the Adult Safety Pool compared with the 10 mg/kg group in study CA184178. 
−  NCI7458/CA184070: No AEs leading to discontinuation were reported for the single patient ≥12 
years treated with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg. Adverse events leading to discontinuation for patients ≥12 
years were reported in 37.5% in the 5 mg/kg group and 22.2% of the 10 mg/kg group. All AEs 
leading to discontinuation were considered related by the investigator. All but one were severe 
(Grade 3–4), one event, occurred in a patient that had both a Grade 3 event of diarrhoea and a 
Grade 2 event of vomiting in the 10 mg/kg group. The PTs for events leading to discontinuation in 
the 5 mg/kg group were autoimmune disorder, abdominal pain, amylase increased, lipase 
increased, and headache, and in the 10 mg/kg group, diarrhoea, and pleural effusion. 
−  CA184178: The rates of all-causality AEs leading to discontinuation were less frequent in 
ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (1/4 [25.0%]) compared to ipilimumab 10 mg/kg (5/8 [62.5%]). Grade 3–4 
AEs leading to discontinuation were 1/4 (25.0%) in the ipilimumab 3 mg/kg group compared to 
4/8 (50.0%) in ipilimumab 10 mg/kg group. No Grade 5 AEs were reported. All AEs leading to 
discontinuation were considered to be related to study drug by the investigator (Table 35).

Table 35: On-study AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug CA184178 
−  Adult Safety Pool: In the pooled 3 mg/kg group, similar overall rates of discontinuations due 
to AEs (10.8%) and treatment-related AEs (8.1%) were reported. In this group, the most 
common treatment-related AE leading to discontinuation was hypopituitarism, which led to 
discontinuation in 2.7% of patients. Treatment-related AEs of colitis and diarrhoea led to 
discontinuation in 2 (1.8%) and 1 (1.9%) patients, respectively. Discontinuation due to 
treatment-related AEs occurred in 18.8% of patients in the pooled 10 mg/kg group. The most 
common treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation in the pooled 10 mg/kg group were 
diarrhoea (6.5%) and colitis (4.3%). In the pooled 10 mg/kg group, 3.1% of patients 
discontinued due to treatment-related events reported under the SOC of investigations and 
3.1% of patients discontinued due to treatment-related events reported under the SOC of 
hepatobiliary disorders. 
Discontinuation of study therapy 
Most patients (50%) in the study were discontinued from treatment due to study drug toxicity. Four 
patients (33.3%) were discontinued due to disease progression (Table 36). Six patients were 
discontinued due to study drug toxicity which was considered to be drug-related by the investigator 
(see safety part for more information on discontinuation due to toxicity). Of these 6 patients, 2 were 
discontinued after 1 dose, 2 after 2 doses, and 2 after 3 doses.

Interruption or delay of study therapy 
Four patients required interruption of study drug due to AEs; one in the 3 mg/kg group and 3 patients 
in the 10 mg/kg group: 
−  Treatment was interrupted for a patients in the 3 mg/kg group due to a hypersensitivity reaction 
(drug fever to 38.3 degrees) on day 22. Ipilimumab was then given at half the infusion rate 
without complication. 
−  Treatment was interrupted for a patient in the 10 mg/kg group due to hypersensitivity reaction 
(chills) on day 1. The patient continued with treatment cycles 2 and 3 without reoccurrence of the 
event. 
−  Treatment was interrupted for a patient in the 10 mg/kg group due to complaints of burning 
sensation beside the new infusion port on day 1. The rate of the infusion was decreased and the 
burning sensation did not return. 
−  Treatment was interrupted for a patient in the 10 mg/kg group due to hypersensitivity reaction of 
mild nausea and a strange feeling inside on day 1. The rate of the infusion was decreased for the 
duration of the day 1 treatment. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In the paediatric safety database 5 patients were treated with 3 mg/kg, 8 with 5 mg/kg and 17 with 10 
mg/kg, with in total 30 adolescents ≥12 years old divided over two clinical studies. Pooling the patients 
treated in NCI7458/CA1847070 and CA184178 with the same doses of ipilumumab, the number of 
deaths was 60%, 50%, and 29% in the 3, 5, and 10 mg/kg group due to disease progression. None of 
the deaths were reported to be drug-related. In the Adult Safety Pool 111 patients were treated with 3 
mg/kg and 325 with 10 mg/kg, and in both 1.8% of deaths were reported to be treatment-related. The 
percentage of drug-related SAEs were 40, 63, 52% in the paediatric population in the increasing dose 
groups and for the adults 17% (3 mg/kg) and 29% (10 mg/kg). Also the number of drug-related AEs 
leading to study drug discontinuation was higher in the paediatric versus the adult safety population. 
In adolescents these numbers were 20% in 3 mg/kg, 38% in 5 mg/kg, and 41% in 10 mg/kg. In 
adults 3 mg/kg led to study drug discontinuation due to drug-related AEs in 8% in the 3 and 19% in 
the 10 mg/kg. The incidence of irAEs was similar in adolescents and adults. For adolescents 60% in 3 
mg/kg, 88% in 5 mg/kg, and 64% in 10 mg/kg. For adults these percentages were 61% in 3 mg/kg, 
and 72% in 10 mg/kg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/6592/2018  
Page 69/81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In study CA184070, no immune related adverse reactions (irAR) ≥Grade 3 were reported for the single 
patient 12 years of age and older who was treated with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg. Two (25.0%) of 8 
patients treated with 5 mg/kg and 1 (11.1%) of 9 patients treated with 10 mg/kg reported Grade 3–4 
events. None of the events were fatal. The types of irARs were consistent with the adult experience, 
with the most commonly reported irARs across all groups in the categories of gastrointestinal (0 [3 
mg/kg], 62.5% [5 mg/kg], and 44.4% [10 mg/kg]), hepatic function (0 [3 mg/kg], 75.0% [5 mg/kg], 
33.3% [10 mg/kg]), and skin (0 [3 mg/kg], 25.0% [5 mg/kg], 33.3% [10 mg/kg]) events. No new or 
unexpected irARs were observed in this study. No differences in the spectrum of irARs reported in 
adults and the paediatric population were evident. 
In study CA184178, no new or unexpected irARs were observed, and the observed irARs were similar 
in frequency, intensity and organ site to what has been reported in adult studies. Two patients in the 
10 mg/kg group experienced a Grade 1 and Grade 3 on-study endocrine irAR of hyperglycemia. No 
other endocrine abnormalities were reported. 
Although no new safety signals were identified in the paediatric population, the number of (drug-
related) AEs leading to discontinuation and the number of drug-related SAEs were numerically higher 
in the paediatric versus the adult population for both 3 and 10 mg/kg (see also Table 26). In 
adolescents 3 mg/kg was better tolerated than 10 mg/kg with lower numbers of (drug-related) SAEs, 
(drug-related) AEs leading to discontinuation, and drug-related AEs. The numbers of irAEs and AEs in 
general did not differ between 3 and 10 mg/kg. When analysed for multiple occurrences of unique 
events and irAEs, the rate of exposure adjusted, multiple occurrences of unique irAEs was higher in the 
10 mg/kg treatment group compared to the 3 mg/kg treatment group. No treatment-related deaths 
occurred in the studied paediatric population.  
In the aforementioned study comparing 3 versus 10 mg/kg ipilimumab in adults, the most common 
grade 3–4 treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea (10% 10 mg/kg group vs 6% 3 mg/kg), 
colitis (5% vs 2%), increased alanine aminotransferase (3% vs 1%), and hypophysitis (3% vs 2%). 
Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 37% in the 10 mg/kg group and 18% in 
the 3 mg/kg group; 1% versus <1% died from treatment-related adverse events. In adults, the 10 
mg/kg dosing led to increased treatment-related adverse events.  
The available safety data in the proposed posology of 3 mg/kg in adolescents is limited due to the 
small number of patients and short follow-up. The limited available data show that adolescent patients 
treated with ipilimumab suffer a high burden of morbidity based on the severity of the ADRs and the 
rates of discontinuation of therapy During the 1 year follow-up described in study CA184178 75% and 
62.5% of the adolescents are alive in the 3 and 10 mg/kg group, respectively. The treated adolescents 
experienced a high number of drug-related SAEs and drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation (25% 
for 3 mg/kg and 62.5% for 10 mg/kg for both drug-related SAEs/AEs leading to discontinuation). The 
very limited safety data in adolescents could be accepted provided that additional safety data will be 
collected prospectively and to this end, a clear plan for post-marketing collection should be provided, 
including the implementation of a registry, preferably by joining an existing melanoma registry. 
Therefore, the CHMP has proposed to prospectively collect safety data in a registry to get further 
insight into the differences of AEs compared to adults and how these AEs can be best managed in 
adolescents as well as to evaluate the known immune-related endocrine adverse events in children 
where hormonal disturbances may have important developmental consequences during growth and 
puberty. The MAH has committed to extend the Dutch Melanoma Treatment Registry (DMTR) to include 
paediatric patients to supplement the safety database with long term safety from a larger pool of 
treated paediatric patients..

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new safety concerns and no new adverse drug reactions were reported in adolescents 12 years of 
age and older, however, ipilimumab seems to be less well tolerated in adolescents compared to adults. 
Toxicity is substantial with severe and life threatening adverse events, which is already known for 
adults. To further characterise the safety profile in children and mitigate the uncertainties surrounding 
a negative effect of ipilimumab on endocrine-related ADRs which may affect hormonal and sexual 
development in adolescents, the MAH has committed to implement a post-marketing collection of 
paediatric safety data through joining the existing DMTR registry as additional pharmacovigilance 
activities (see RMP).  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
•  Extension of the Dutch Melanoma Treatment Registry (DMTR) to include paediatric patients as 
additional pharmacovigilance activities in the RMP.  
An updated RMP with a synopsis on timelines, enrollment, methodology for analysis and of the 
proposed safety data collection should be provided within 90 days of Opinion. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. Particularly, a new warning with regard to the benefit risk balance in patient below the 
age of 12 that has been added to the product information. The Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: The 
modifications now proposed in the PL (i.e., those relevant to the new indication) do not represent 
major changes to the general design, layout and readability of the proposed PL.   
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Ipilimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4). 
It potentiates T-cell activation by blocking the binding to its ligands B7-1 and B7-2. Ipilimumab is 
approved as monotherapy for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in 
adults at a dose of 3 mg/kg administered IV once every 3 weeks for a total of 4 doses.  
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Melanoma is predominantly diagnosed in the adult population, but the incidence in children is rising. 
Melanoma in preadolescent patients behaves different than melanoma in the adult population, but in 
adolescents behaviour of melanomas is similar to adults. Current treatment regimens in children are 
based on the treatments in adults. For paediatric patients, 5-year disease-specific survival is 57% in 
the case of distant disease.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In clinical practice, ipilimumab is no longer used in the first-line setting for melanoma in the adult 
population in most countries. In this setting, nivolumab and pembrolizumab also show efficacy in 
melanoma and have improved tolerability compared to ipilimumab. Moreover, in BRAF-mutated 
patients, BRAF and MEK inhibitor combinations can be used. Furthermore, ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg 
shows increased benefit when used in combination with nivolumab compared with ipilimumab 
monotherapy. Nevertheless, there are no approved therapies for paediatric patients with advanced or 
metastatic melanoma. The MAH initially applied to extend the indication of ipilumumab to children and 
adolescents 12 years of age and older. 
Assessment report  
EMA/6592/2018  
Page 74/81 
 
 
 
 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The application is supported by data from two clinical studies. Study NCI7458/CA184070 is a phase 1, 
open-label, dose-escalation clinical study in children and adolescents of 1 to 21 years old with 
advanced and/or refractory solid malignant tumours (3 melanoma patients treated with 5 mg/kg, 2 
with 10 mg/kg). Study CA184178 is a phase 2, open-label, single-arm efficacy and safety clinical study 
in adolescents 12 to <18 years with untreated or previously treated advanced/metastatic melanoma (4 
patients treated with 3 mg/kg, 8 with 10 mg/kg). Prior therapy with a CTLA-4, PD-1, PD-L1, or CD137 
targeted agent was an exclusion criterium. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The PK results from paediatric studies CA184070 and CA184178 indicated that ipilimumab exposure in 
pediatric patients is similar and overlaps with the ipilimumab exposures in adults when dosed by 
mg/kg. The popPK showed that CL was not dependent on age and therefore it is considered reasonable 
to extrapolate the dose-response relationship from the adults to paediatric patients.  
In study CA184178, anti-tumour activity with an objective response was shown in 2 out of 8 
adolescents in the age range of 12 to 18 years with advanced melanoma and best response of SD in 1 
additional patient treated with 10 mg/kg. Overall survival rate at 1 year was 75.0% (95% CI: 12.8, 
96.1) in the ipilimumab 3 mg/kg group and 62.5% (95% CI: 22.9, 86.1) in the ipilimumab 10 mg/kg 
group. Median OS was 18.2 months (95% CI: 8.9, 18.2) in the 3 mg/kg group and not reached (95% 
CI: 5.2, NA) in the 10 mg/kg group. Median PFS was 2.6 months (95% CI: 2.3, 8.5) in the 3 mg/kg 
group and 2.9 months (95% CI: 0.7, NA) in the 10 mg/kg group. This is very similar to the adult 
population where median OS after ipilimumab monotherapy (3 mg/kg) was 10.12 months (CI 95%: 
8.02, 13.80) with a 1-year OS rate of 46% (CI 95%: 37.0, 54.1). Median PFS was 2.86 months (CI 
95%: 2.76, 3.02). In 137 treated patients, tumour evaluation showed CR in 1.5%, PR in 9.5%, SD in 
17.5%, PD in 51.1% of patients respectively, and 20.4% was not evaluable. BORR was 10.9% (CI 95: 
6.3, 17.4) [EPAR Ipilimumab; SmPC Ipilimumab]. 
In study NCI7458/CA184070, none of the 2 patients treated with 10 mg/kg showed a response. Only 4 
patients in the indicated age range were treated with the posology of 3 mg/kg. One patient had a 
response of SD(260 days). For 5 mg/kg 2 of 3 patients showed SD. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The safety and efficacy of ipilimumab in children younger than 12 years of age has not been 
established since there is very limited data that are available. YERVOY should not be used in children 
younger than 12 years of age (SmPC section 4.2).  
Patients with ocular melanoma, active brain metastases and prior therapy with ipilimumab were not 
included in the paediatric trial CA184070 (see SmPC section 5.1). Patients with ocular melanoma, 
active brain metastases and prior therapy with CTLA-4, PD-1, PD-L1, or CD137 targeted agents were 
not included in the paediatric trial CA184178 (see SmPC section 5.1). Therefore, there are no efficacy 
data in these patient populations and a warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Toxicity in adolescents is significant, in particular in the 10 mg/kg group. In the paediatric safety 
database 5 patients were treated with 3 mg/kg, 8 with 5 mg/kg and 17 with 10 mg/kg, with in total 30 
adolescents ≥12 years old. Pooling the patients treated in NCI7458/CA1847070 and CA184178 with 
the same doses of ipilumumab, the number of deaths was 60%, 50%, and 29% in the 3, 5, and 10 
mg/kg group. None of the deaths were reported to be drug-related. 
The percentage of drug-related SAEs were 40, 63, 52% in the paediatric population in the increasing 
dose groups and for the adults 17% (3 mg/kg) and 29% (10 mg/kg). Also the number of drug-related 
AEs leading to study drug discontinuation was higher in the paediatric versus the adult safety 
population. In adolescents these numbers were 20% in 3 mg/kg, 38% in 5 mg/kg, and 41% in 10 
mg/kg. In adults 3 mg/kg led to study drug discontinuation due to drug-related AEs in 8% in the 3 and 
19% in the 10 mg/kg. 
The incidence of irAEs was similar occurring in adolescents and adults. For adolescents 60% in 3 
mg/kg, 88% in 5 mg/kg, and 64% in 10 mg/kg. For adults these percentages were 61% in 3 mg/kg, 
and 72% in 10 mg/kg. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Based on the safety data from the paediatric studies, the overall safety profile of ipilimumab in 
adolescents 12 years of age and older with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma seems to 
be less well tolerated in adolescents compared to adults. Paediatric patients appear to experience 
substantial toxicity with severe and life threatening adverse events, which is already known for adults. 
The safety experience of treating adolescents >12 years is very limited with a sample size of only 30 
patients and restricted to the 1L treatment setting and no long-term safety data in the paediatric 
population are available. Therefore, missing information in the RMP has been updated with long-term 
safety in children and adolescent patients > 12 years of age. 
There are also uncertainties as to whether the general safety profile (AEs, SAEs, discontinuations), is 
similar in adults and adolescents. Therefore, the CHMP has proposed to prospectively collect safety 
data in a registry to get further insight into the differences of AEs compared to adults and how these 
how best to manage the ADRs  in adolescents. As the immune system of adolescent is undergoing 
maturation, the registry would also help in evaluating the known immune-related adverse events in 
children in relation to their developing immune system but also where hormonal disturbances could 
have important developmental consequences during growth and puberty. The MAH has committed to 
sponsor an extension of the Dutch Melanoma Treatment Registry (DMTR) to include paediatric patients 
as additional pharmacovigilance activities in the RMP.  Safety data would be collected in this registry. A 
synopsis is proposed to be provided within 90 days of Opinion.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy- Melanoma is a rare disease in children, but the incidence is rising 
with a 5-year disease-specific survival rate for advanced disease of only 57%.  Melanoma in 
adolescents behaves similarly to melanoma in adults, as also described in the PIP for melanoma (EMA-
000117-PIP02-10), and therefore based on the PK exposure data, extrapolation of the data from adult 
Assessment report  
EMA/6592/2018  
Page 78/81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to children above 12 years of age is acceptable (see also reflection paper on extrapolation of efficacy 
and safety in paediatric medicine development; EMA/199678/2016). Although in clinical practice 
ipilimumab is no longer used in the first-line setting for melanoma in most countries, there is still a 
need in children with melanoma as no therapies have been yet approved for this patient population. 
It is reassuring that the available results indicate anti-tumour activity of ipilimumab in the paediatric 
population of 12 years and older. Although the number of treated patients between the age of 12 and 
18 years is small, it is reasonable to extrapolate the efficacy results and the clinical benefit from adults 
as the disease course is similar between adolescents and adults and the ipilimumab exposure in 
paediatric patients is overlapping with the ipilimumab exposure in adults when dosed by mg/kg (see 
also pharmacokinetics section).  
Safety- Safety data of adolescents treated with ipilimumab is scarce and for the 2L or more treatment 
setting data are lacking. Reliable comparisons with adults are not possible due the limited sample size, 
but tolerability in the paediatric population of 12 years and older seem to be worse with higher 
numbers of drug-related AEs and (drug-related) AEs leading to discontinuation, for which no 
explanation is provided. As in adults safety seems worse in the higher 10 mg/kg dosing. It is therefore 
unclear whether the safety in adolescents is similar to that in adults. Therefore, the uncertainty on the 
limited of safety database will be addressed in the long-term by additional safety data collected 
prospectively in post-authorisation in a registry. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Advanced melanoma in adolescents is challenging to treat with limited licensed therapeutic options and 
hence, there is a need for new therapies in this population with a dismal prognosis. This application is 
based on descriptive data of a limited number of adolescents treated at different doses of ipilimumab. 
The data presented are supported by PK data that allows assessing the B/R by extrapolating the 
efficacy and safety data from the adult melanoma patient population. Extrapolation of efficacy results 
from the adults is acceptable given a similar course of the disease and an overlapping PK exposure of 
ipilimumab in children compared to adults. It is reasonable to expect that paediatric patients will derive 
similar clinical benefits as for what has been observed in the adults. Only very limited data are 
available in children younger than 12 years of age. Therefore, the indication has been restricted to 
patients ≥12 years of age  and ipilimumab should not be used in children younger than 12 years of 
age.  Exposure in paediatric patients seems overlapping with the ipilimumab exposures in adults when 
dosed by mg/kg. As there is limited safety follow-up, there is uncertainty in terms of the robustness of 
the safety data concerning the ADRs observed so far in this paediatric population which seems to 
indicate a worse safety profile and tolerability of ipilimumab in the paediatric population compared to 
adults. During the 1 year follow-up described in study CA184178 75% and 62.5% of the adolescents 
are alive in the 3 and 10 mg/kg group, respectively. The treated adolescents experienced a high 
number of drug-related SAEs and drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation (25% for 3 mg/kg and 
62.5% for 10 mg/kg for both drug-related SAEs/AEs leading to discontinuation). This would imply that 
the treatment of adolescents with ipilimumab involves higher morbidity and possible complications in 
the long term. As a result, it is of utmost importance to prospectively collect safety data and further 
evaluate how best to manage the ADRs and assess any impact on growth and sexual maturation on 
adolescents. The MAH has committed to collect this data as additional pharmacovigilance activities as 
part of a registry.   
Assessment report  
EMA/6592/2018  
Page 79/81 
 
 
 
 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Ipilimumab monotherapy is no longer considered the primary choice for first line treatment of patients 
with advanced melanoma. In the 2L or more treatment setting, where ipilimumab monotherapy may 
provide a relevant treatment option, no results were provided. Whether it is possible to extrapolate 
efficacy data from the 1L treatment setting to the 2L setting following another immunotherapy drug, is 
unclear at this time. After failure of anti-PD1 therapy, there is still a need for ipilimumab and activity 
has been shown in second line11, although evidence is limited. The uncertainty in which line ipilimumab 
should be used and the limited evidence about efficacy of ipilimumab after first line with anti-PD1 
therapy also exists in adults. Since it is challenging to treat advanced melanoma in adolescents with 
currently very limited licensed therapeutic options, a clear unmet medical need exists in any line of 
therapy. Therefore, the indication has not been restricted to a line of therapy.  Before initiating 
treatment with ipilimumab monotherapy in adolescents of 12 years and older, physicians are advised 
to carefully evaluate the individual patient, taking into consideration the limited available data, the 
observed benefits and the toxicity of ipilimumab monotherapy in the paediatric population (see 
sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Yervoy is positive. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
•  Extension of the Dutch Melanoma Treatment Registry (DMTR) to include paediatric patients as 
additional pharmacovigilance activities in the RMP.  
An updated RMP with a synopsis on timelines, enrolment, methodology for analysis and of the 
proposed safety data collection should be provided within 90 days of Opinion.

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0003/2017 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, in the Package Leaflet. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "Steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of indication to include the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in 
adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older for Yervoy. As a consequence sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4,

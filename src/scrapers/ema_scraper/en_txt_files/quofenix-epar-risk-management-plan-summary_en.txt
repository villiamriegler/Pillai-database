SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR QUOFENIX (DELAFLOXACIN) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Quofenix. The RMP details important 
risks of Quofenix, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Quofenix's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Quofenix's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Quofenix should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Quofenix should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Quofenix's 
RMP. 
I. 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
Quofenix is authorised for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections 
(ABSSSI) and also intended for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults 
when it is considered inappropriate to use other antibacterial agents that are commonly 
recommended for the initial treatment of these infections (see SmPC for the full indication). It 
contains delafloxacin as the active substance and it is given by oral (450 mg tablets) or intravenous 
infusion (300 mg of powder for concentrate for solution for infusion) administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Quofenix’s benefits can be found in Quofenix’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/quofenix. 
II.  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO MINIMISE 
OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE THE RISKS  
Important risks of Quofenix, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Quofenix's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• 
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
• 
• 
• 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
II.A. List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Quofenix are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered or taken. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Quofenix. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has 
not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on 
the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the 
long-term use of the medicine);

Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Fluoroquinolones are associated with an increased risk of inflammation of 
tendons (tendinitis) and tendon rupture. During delafloxacin clinical 
development, no tendon rupture was seen.   
A positive family history is significant solitary risk factor for tendinopathy, 
increasing the risk fivefold. 
Risk factors for developing inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis) include 
age, working in particular jobs that involve repetitive motions, awkward 
positions, frequent overhead reaching, vibration or forceful exertion or 
participating in sports that involve repetitive motions.

Important identified risk: Damage to the nerves in arms and legs (Peripheral Neuropathy) 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Systemic fluoroquinolones have been associated with an increased risk of 
damage to the nerves in arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy). For delafloxacin, 
during the clinical trials, the incidence of potential peripheral neuropathy was 
estimated as 0.8%. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Damage to the nerves in arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy) can result from 
traumatic injuries, infections, metabolic problems, inherited causes and exposure 
to toxins. One of the most common causes is diabetes mellitus (condition in 
which the patient has high blood sugar levels).  
In particular, damage to the nerves in arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy) risk 
factors include: diabetes mellitus; alcohol abuse; vitamin deficiencies, 
particularly B vitamins; infections, such as Lyme disease, shingles, Epstein-Barr 
virus, hepatitis C and HIV; immune system disorders, such as Guillian-Barré 
syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, kidney, 
liver or thyroid disorders; exposure to toxins; repetitive motion and family 
history of neuropathy.

Important potential risk: Long-lasting and / or potentially irreversible severe adverse reactions 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Some of the serious adverse drug reactions associated with the use of 
quinolones and fluoroquinolones could very rarely be long-lasting, disabling 
and potentially irreversible and that these risks are a class effect. 
Most of the information on the long-lasting, disabling and potentially 
irreversible character of adverse drug reactions already known for 
(fluoro)quinolones is available from analysis of spontaneously reported data. 
Some studies suggest that peripheral neuropathy associated with 
(fluoro)quinolones use can be severe, debilitating and permanent.  
(Fluoro)quinolones effects on Central Nervous Sistem are well recognised 
being the second most common reported adverse drug reactions reported in 
association with these medicinal products. However, data on the long-lasting, 
disabling and potentially irreversible adverse drug reactions related to the 
Central Nervous Sistem has not been studied systematically and most of the 
information from the scientific literature can be found in publications 
analysing spontaneous data.  
Considering all available information, there is a reasonable amount of 
evidence pointing to the causal association between (fluoro)quinolones and 
long-lasting, disabling and potentially irreversible reactions that manifest as 
Central Nervous Sistem effects and psychiatric disorders. 
There is some uncertainty about risk factors related directly to the long-
lasting, disabling and potentially irreversible adverse drug reactions. 
The risk of quinolone-induced tendinopathy can be increased by underlying 
disease or co-administrated medicines. A review of an article mentioned that 
predisposing factors for tendinopathy are corticosteroid therapy, advanced 
age, renal disease, haemodialysis and transplantation. These findings are 
consistent with an another study that also proposed other risk factors such as 
rheumatic disease, gout, high doses of quinolones, male gender and age over 
60 years.

Important potential risk: Aortic dilatation and rupture (Aortic aneurysm and dissection) 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Fluoroquinolones are among the most used antibiotics at world level thanks 
to their expanded spectrum of action, to excellent bioavailability oral and 
also for a manageable phenomenon of bacterial resistance. Although 
generally well tolerated, these drugs can cause rare but serious adverse 
reactions to when they add also these raw evidence of greater risk of 
dilatation and aortic rupture. 
A recent study showed that ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, increases 
susceptibility to aortic dilatation and rupture in a mouse model of moderate. 
Another recent study showed a 66% increase in aortic dilatation and aortic 
rupture in patients treated with fluoroquinolones compared to amoxicillin. 
From this study emerges with fluoroquinolones a risk of aorta dilatation 
contained, but not negligible given the wide use of this class of drugs. The 
damage mechanism of the aortic wall deserves to be clarified, but it can be 
hypothesized, in analogy with what is described in tendinopathies and tendon 
ruptures associated with fluoroquinolones, a damage of the extracellular 
matrix and in particular of collagen favored by the activation of 
metalloproteases. 
Conditions that predispose to dilatation and aortic rupture include a family 
history of vasculitis, dilatation, aortic dilatation or pre-existing aortic rupture, 
congenital disorders with collagen defects such as Marfan syndrome or 
vascular Ehlers-Danlos, Takayasu's arteritis, giant cell arteritis, Behçet's 
disease, hypertension, atherosclerosis and drug addiction.

Accumulation of the intravenous vehicle (SBECD) can occur in renally 
impaired patients and it is considered as important potential risk in patients 
with severe renal impairment which could lead to serious outcomes.

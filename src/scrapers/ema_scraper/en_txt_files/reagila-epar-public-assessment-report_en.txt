2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Schizophrenia is a life-long psychiatric disorder. The cardinal symptoms fall into 3 domains: positive 
symptoms such as delusions and hallucination, negative symptoms such as lack of drive and social 
withdrawal, and cognitive symptoms such as problems with attention and memory.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Schizophrenia typically begins in late adolescence or early adulthood. Its lifetime prevalence is about 1 % 
globally. It is equally prevalent in men and women and affects more than 21 million people worldwide. 
Incidence rates per year of schizophrenia in adults within a quite narrow range between 0.1 and 0.4 per 
1000 population (WHO). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Dopamine hypothesis as simplified posits that schizophrenia results from too much dopaminergic activity. 
Efficacy of antipsychotic medications correlates with their ability to antagonize dopamine type 2 (D2) 
receptors. In addition, several other neurotransmitters and receptor types are involved.  
An enlargement of cerebral ventricles, reduced brain symmetry, deficits in prefrontal cortex and decrease 
in size of hippocampus and amygdala have been all observed in patients with schizophrenia.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation 
A patient usually gradually recovers from the first episode of schizophrenia. However, relapses are 
common, and pattern of the illness during the first 5 years indicates generally the course. In general, 
deterioration in the patient’s baseline functioning happens after each relapse. Positive symptoms tend to 
ease with time, but the socially debilitating negative and deficit symptoms may increase and become 
more severe. Only 10-20% of schizophrenia patients have been described to achieve a good outcome. It 
has been estimated that 20-30% continue to experience moderate symptoms and 40-60% remain 
significantly impaired. This means that patients with schizophrenia often have great difficulties in 
integrating in society and to normal life, for example through the loss of an acquired capability to earn a 
livelihood or the disruption of studies. In addition, comorbidity with other somatic diseases, such as 
obesity, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus, as well as with substance abuse is common. 
People with schizophrenia have a 40-60% higher rate of dying prematurely than general population due 
to physical health problems and suicide. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Antipsychotic medications are the mainstay treatment for schizophrenia in addition to psychosocial 
interventions. Antipsychotics diminish symptoms and reduce relapse rates. Antipsychotics have a wide 
variety of pharmacological properties but all have a capacity to antagonize postsynaptic dopamine 
receptors in the brain. 
Acute psychotic symptoms require immediate attention and focuses to alleviating of severe symptoms 
with an adequate trial of medication. If no adequate response is followed by a few weeks trial, treatment 
should be changed to another type of antipsychotic. Side effects are very common with antipsychotics.

These include extrapyramidal side effects, tardive dyskinesia, sexual side effects, sedation, just a few to 
mention. 
2.2.  About the product 
Cariprazine (RGH-188) is a novel atypical antipsychotic, an orally active and potent dopamine D2 and D3 
receptor partial agonist with preferential binding to D3 receptors and partial agonist at serotonin 5-HT1A 
receptors.  
Reagila (cariprazine) is intended for the treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients. The Applicant 
proposed once daily doses 1.5-6 mg. Treatment should be initiated with 1.5 mg dose and increased with 
1.5 to 3 mg increments to clinically justified target dose. Maximum daily dose is 6 mg.

Batch analysis data (5 commercial scale batches) of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on 10 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored 
in the intended commercial package for up to 60 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH 
and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided. Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. 
Results under stressed conditions: alkaline treatment (0.2 N NaOH:ACN = 3:7 at 80 °C), acidic treatment 
(0.1N HCl:ACN = 9:1 at 80 °C), peroxidic treatment (3% H2O2:ACN = 1:1 at room temperature), and 
treatment in solid state were also provided for one batch. 
The  following  parameters  were  tested:  characters,  loss  on  drying,  related  substances,  and  assay. 
Supplementary tests as microbiological purity and polymorphic testing are performed at the start and 
after 60 months (long-term conditions). The analytical methods used were the same as for release and 
are stability indicating. 
Under accelerated and long term conditions, all tested parameters were within the specifications for the 
primary and supportive stability batches.  
Regarding the photostability testing, the active substance does not decompose due to the effect of light. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months without special 
storage conditions in the proposed container. 
2.3.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented in size 4 (1.5 mg, 3 mg, and 4.5 mg) or size 3 (6 mg) hard capsules 
filled with a white to yellowish white powder mixture. 
The proposed specification for particle size distribution was based on batch data the active substance. 
Dissolution test results justify the final particle size limits for cariprazine hydrochloride. 
The compatibility between the active substance and the excipients of the capsule fill (pregelatinised maize 
starch and magnesium stearate) was demonstrated under long term (4 weeks at room temperature), 
accelerated (4 weeks at 40 °C) and stressed conditions (4 weeks at 50 °C). A similar study of the active 
substance mixed with milled capsule shells of all colour versions under long term and stressed conditions 
confirmed compatibility with the capsule shells. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards except for the colourants. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.3.1 of this 
report. 
A quality-by-design (QbD) approach was used for the formulation development. Key attributes of the 
quality target product profile (QTPP) which formed the basis of design at the early stage of product 
development were defined as: indication, route of administration, dosage form, strengths, stability, 
container closure and finished product quality attributes  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/353055/2017  
Page 13/162 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the QTTP, the following initial critical quality attributes (CQA) were established: identification, 
assay, uniformity of dosage units, degradation products, dissolution and microbiology.  
Dissolution profiles using the quality control (QC) method were generated to characterise the effect on 
capsule  dissolution  of  the  following  variables:  diluent  used  in  the  formulation  blend;  particle  size 
distribution of the active substance; diluent compaction of the formulation blend.  
The capsule shells used throughout the development of the finished product and commercial manufacture 
have been assessed for product performance by in vitro dissolution tests and demonstrated to have no 
impact on the release characteristics of the finished product. 
A quality-by-design (QbD) approach was used during the development of the manufacturing process for 
the finished product. The strategy for manufacturing process development was based on following key 
steps: 
1. Acquire process understanding of the finished product. 
2. Risk assessment and prior knowledge were used to identify material attributes and process parameters 
for each step with a high risk of impacting the finished product critical quality attributes (CQAs) and these 
were regularly re-evaluated during development.  
The primary packaging is PVC/PE/PVDC blister heat-sealed with hard aluminum foil backing. The material 
complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: screening, blending, final blending, encapsulation 
and primary packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
The in-process controls are adequate for controlling these steps. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible 
manner.  
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
characters (visual), uniformity of mass (capsule filling) (Ph. Eur.), identification (HPLC, DAD), colorant in 
the capsule shell (colour reaction), related substances (HPLC), microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.), assay 
(HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), and uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur. / HPLC).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for testing has 
been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process 
and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from all strengths of the finished product stored under long term conditions for 60 months 
at 25 ºC / 60% RH, under intermediate conditions for 60 months at  30 ºC / 65% RH and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The batches of the medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in

2.4.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Cariprazine is a dopamine D2/D3 receptor and serotonin 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist and a 5-HT2 
receptor antagonist. Functionally, cariprazine has shown both agonist and antagonist properties at the 
dopamine D2/D3 receptor depending on the test conditions, which overall fits a partial agonist 
pharmacologic profile. The major human active metabolites, DDCAR and DCAR, have a pharmacodynamic 
profile comparable to that of the parent compound, but DDCAR displays greater antagonistic effect on 
both D3 and D2 receptors.  
Receptor binding data and results from functional assays showed that CAR and its major active human 
metabolites DCAR and DDCAR have assay-dependent dopamine D2 and D3 receptor antagonist-partial 
agonist-full agonist or 5-HT1A partial agonist profile, and antagonist profile at serotonin 5-HT2B 
receptors, whereas Risperidone showed consistent antagonist profile at dopamine D2 and D3 receptors. 
Moreover, the results from the animal models representative for negative symptoms indicate favourable 
effect of CAR in these models. 
In vitro 
Cariprazine has high affinity for human recombinant dopamine D3 receptors (Ki = 0.085 nM) and high 
(but 6-8 times lower relative to D3 receptor) affinity for dopamine D2 receptors (Ki = 0.49 and 0.69 nM 
for D2L and D2S, respectively) and serotonin 5-HT2B (Ki =0.58 nM) and 5-HT1A (Ki =2.6 nM) receptors. 
Cariprazine shows moderate affinity for σ1, 5-HT2A, and H1 receptors (Ki values: 18.3 nM, 18.8 nM, and 
23.2 nM, respectively). In general, the in vitro human receptor binding profiles of the two major active 
metabolites of cariprazine, DCAR (D3, Ki = 0.057 nM; D2, Ki = 1.41 and 2.64 nM for D2L and D2S, 
respectively, 5-HT2B, (Ki =0.53 nM) and 5-HT1A, (Ki =1.7 nM) and DDCAR (D3, Ki = 0.038 nM; D2, Ki = 
0.81 and 1.31 nM for D2L and D2S, respectively, 5-HT2B, (Ki =0.47 nM) and 5-HT1A, (Ki =2.93 nM) are 
comparable to the parent compound, but some variation was seen in the binding preference results at D3 
over D2 receptor between cariprazine and DDCAR. Further, the DDCAR, being a major and long lasting 
metabolite in humans was less potent (3-10–fold) than cariprazine under the in vivo conditions tested and 
showed some minor differences in its agonist efficacy at D2 and 5-HT1A receptors.  
In cell based functional assays, cariprazine, DCAR and DDCAR demonstrated assay dependent partial 
agonism with varying potency and intrinsic activity at different signalling mechanisms coupled to D2 or D3 
receptors). 
In a broad target selectivity screen, cariprazine and the metabolites DDCAR and DCAR did not exhibit 
appreciable binding affinity (IC50 > 1 μM) for any of the 71 receptors, transporters, or ion channels tested. 
In vivo 
In neurochemical studies, similar to other dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, cariprazine increased the 
dopamine turnover (DOPAC+HVA)/DA ratio) in rodent brain region such as striatum and frontal cortex. 
Moreover, consistent with in vitro data, cariprazine acts as a partial agonist when the dopaminergic tone 
is low (in reserpine model) but shows antagonist activity when the dopamine tone is high (antagonism of 
effect of apomorphine in the GBL model). 
Receptor occupancy studies in rat in vivo show that acutely administered oral doses of cariprazine (within 
the antipsychotic-like effective range ≥ 0.3 mg/kg PO) occupy D3 (ED50  0.4 mg/kg) and D2 receptors 
(ED50  0.4 mg/kg) to a similar extent.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/353055/2017  
Page 16/162 
 
 
 
 
 
Electrophysiology studies in vivo show that chronic oral administration of cariprazine (0.1, 0.3 and 1 
mg/kg, PO for 21 days) dose-dependently reduced dopamine neuronal firing with limbic (VTA) vs. striatal 
selectivity (-45%, -59% and -66% inhibition), similar to the effect reported for aripiprazole. 
The antipsychotic-like activity of cariprazine and DDCAR was evaluated in standard behavioural models 
detecting antagonist activity at D2 receptor (e.g. apomorphine- and amphetamine-induced hyper- 
locomotion). Efficacy in these in vivo disease-like models was commonly observed in the dose range 0.1-1 
mg/kg, PO (predicted Cmax = 10-100 ng/mL; e.g. ED50 values 0.27 - 0.31 mg/kg at 1 and 4h post-dose 
in the apomorphine-induced climbing model, respectively).  
Cariprazine also reversed cognitive- and social deficits (effective dose-range: 0.02-0.25 mg/kg, IP or PO) 
in rodent models of schizophrenia induced by NMDA antagonists (e.g. PCP) and demonstrates 
antidepressant-like properties (effective dose- range: 0.03-0.25 mg/kg, IP) in animal models of 
anhedonia (chronic mild or unpredictable stress), which may in turn indicate effects of cariprazine on 
negative symptoms of schizophrenia. 
In general, the in vivo pharmacological profile of the metabolite DDCAR was comparable to cariprazine, 
although it displays a lower potency (2-10-fold depending on the assay). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamics studies were conducted to demonstrate effects of cariprazine at other 
indications. Anxiolytic efficacy was shown in the rat Vogel test (doses of 0.2-1.6 mg/kg PO), which is in 
the range of its antipsychotic-like effect and cariprazine reduces the reward value in cocaine 
self-administration model.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
CNS 
In CNS safety studies in rodents, a single oral dose of cariprazine resulted in several observations in the 
Irwin screen that may be related to the pharmacology of the drug including decreases in body 
temperature, muscle tone, grip strength, startle response, body tone, and locomotion, as well as 
abnormal gait and impaired motor coordination. These effects were noted within the 
pharmacologically-effective dose-range of > 0.4 mg/kg (estimated Cmax ~ 14 ng/ml). Based on these 
results, the exposure margin for CNS effects in rats, relative to the Cmax (~ 23 ng/mL) at the MRHD of 6 
mg/day was < 1. 
Cariprazine produced no catalepsy in rats at doses ≥ 85 mg/kg (HED= 822 mg; exposure margin of 140 
at the MRHD of 6 mg/day) or at least 100-fold the ED50 value of its antipsychotic-like efficacy.  Moreover, 
cariprazine inhibited haloperidol (3 mg/kg IP)-induced catalepsy yielding a minimum effective dose of 2 
mg/kg PO. In contrast to these preclinical data, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were frequently seen in 
the clinical studies. 
Cariprazine did not exhibit pro-convulsant or anticonvulsant activity in the PTZ seizure test in Wistar rats 
(up to 2.5 mg/kg PO (HED= 24 mg); exposure margin of 4 at the MRHD of 6 mg/day) nor did cariprazine 
potentiate the hexobarbital-induced sleep time in mice. 
Cardiovascular 
Cariprazine showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of the human Ether-a-go-go related gene 
(hERG) channel maximum tail current amplitude in vitro, with an estimated IC50 range of 3-4 µM.         
The exposure margin for hERG activity is estimated to ~ 55-75-fold over the Cmax (~ 23 ng/mL                  
[~ 54 nM] at the MRHD of 6 mg/day). Similar to cariprazine, DCAR and DDCAR blocked hERG 
Assessment report

channel-mediated currents in a non-GLP study in vitro, with estimated IC50 values for DCAR (3.6 μM) and 
DDCAR (3.5 μM), respectively. 
In telemetry studies in conscious dogs, cariprazine at a dose of 3.0 mg/kg PO (Cmax= 383 ng/mL; 
exposure margin of ~16 relative to the Cmax (~23 ng/mL) at the MRHD of 6 mg/day) produced a 
significant increase (~ 40-50%) in heart rate at 4 and 6 hours post-dose, whereas it caused little or no 
reduction in blood pressure. Cariprazine tested up to 3 mg/kg PO had no biologically significant effects on 
PR and QRS intervals of the ECG and did not prolong the QT or QTc intervals. No arrhythmia or other 
changes in the morphology of the ECG were observed in the dogs. 
Gastrointestinal system, renal and respiratory function 
Cariprazine, tested at the highest dose of 2.5 mg/kg PO (HED= 24 mg; exposure margin of 4 based on the 
MRHD of 6 mg/day) had no effects on gastric motility or secretion and did not induce ulcerogenic activity 
in male rats. Cariprazine, tested at the highest dose of 2.5 mg/kg PO (HED= 24 mg; exposure margin of 
4 based on the MRHD of 6 mg/day) had no significant effect on diuresis and urinary electrolyte excretion 
in rats. Cariprazine (0.5, 2.5, 12.5 mg/kg, PO) decreased the respiration rate significantly in rats at all 
doses (maximum decrease ~ 43% at 12.5 mg/kg), with a compensatory increase in tidal volume at all 
doses. This effect was different from that of the respiratory depressant effects of morphine which 
decrease both respiratory rate and tidal volume. Thus, cariprazine was not considered to induce major 
respiratory depression effects. 
Endocrine function 
Cariprazine at 0.5 mg/kg (HED = 0.08 mg/kg or 4.8 mg) and higher induces hyperprolactinemia in both 
rat in both sexes, and increases in serum prolactin levels in the female animals were higher than those in 
the males. The exposure margin for prolactin effects in rats, relative to the MRHD of 6 mg was <1. 
Noteworthy, the induced hyperprolactinemia was lower for cariprazine compared to risperidone during 
short-term clinical studies. 
DCAR and DDCAR metabolites 
The major metabolites of cariprazine, in particular DDCAR, show relatively high and long-lasting plasma 
concentration in humans. Based on toxicokinetic data obtained in the toxicology study package of 
cariprazine, DCAR is considered as completely characterised in the safety pharmacology program. DDCAR 
can be considered also appropriately characterised in terms of cardiovascular safety but not in terms of 
the other organ systems studied only in rodents because the plasma concentration of DDCAR is rather low 
at the safety pharmacology dose range applied in rats and mice. Thus, DDCAR appeared to have been 
incompletely characterised in the safety pharmacology program since in vivo safety data for some organ 
systems are lacking. However, given the stage of the clinical development, further in vivo study with 
these metabolites is not likely to yield data relevant for human risk assessment. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Cariprazine is a lipophilic compound (Mw 427.41), with low pH-dependent solubility (BCS class 2) and 
high permeability. The single oral dose studies indicate rapid absorption in mouse, rat and dog with Cmax 
generally observed after 0.5-1 h in rodents, 1-2 h in dogs and  2 h in monkey. The IV pharmacokinetics 
was characterized by plasma clearance values in rat of 26-32 mL/min.kg and with lower values in dog ( 
15 mL/min.kg). The apparent elimination half-life ranged from 2 - 3 hrs in rat, 3 – 6 hrs in monkey and 
4 - 7 hrs in dog, with no obvious difference between the two genders. The absolute oral bioavailability was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/353055/2017  
Page 18/162 
 
 
 
 
 
52-63% in rats and ~ 64-80% dogs, indicating incomplete absorption and some first-pass effect. 
Co-administration with food had limited effects on cariprazine exposure and PK parameters in dogs.  
Plasma concentrations of the two major human active metabolites, desmethyl cariprazine (DCAR) and 
didesmethyl cariprazine (DDCAR), were measured in rats and dogs following a single oral dose. Similar to 
cariprazine, the plasma concentration of DCAR reached a maximum at 1-2 hours in both species, whereas 
the Tmax of DDCAR was greater than that of cariprazine (6 hours in rats and 8-12 hours in dogs). The 
half-life of DCAR was similar to that of cariprazine for both species (T½ ~3 hours in rats; T½ 4-7 hours in 
dogs) whereas the plasma half-life (T½) of DDCAR was considerably longer than that of cariprazine for 
dogs (16-25 hours).  
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding of cariprazine was high across all preclinical species examined as well as in human 
( 96%). In human plasma, DDCAR and DCAR were bound to plasma proteins by  93 % and    95 %, 
respectively. 
Studies on red blood cell binding of [14C]-cariprazine indicate that cariprazine in the blood was bound to 
the red blood cells in human by 30% and by approximately 45% in rats and dogs. The binding to plasma 
proteins and red blood cells was independent of gender and the cariprazine concentration. 
Cariprazine readily crosses the blood-brain barrier after oral administration in rats (brain-to-plasma AUC 
ratio was ≥ 7.6-fold). Cariprazine has also large volume of distribution of up to 7.8 L/kg in the rat and 19 
L/kg in the dog and distributes well to most tissues. 
Quantitative whole body phosphor imaging (QWBPI) was used to determine the tissue distribution of 
cariprazine. Following an oral administration of [14C]-cariprazine to male and female albino rats and male 
and female Long Evans rats, the 14C-radioactivity was distributed into almost all tissues at 2 hr post-dose 
(Tmax). No obvious sex-dependent differences in tissue distribution of 14C-radioactivity were observed. 
Distribution of [14C]-cariprazine related radioactivity was similar in pigmented and non-pigmented rats, 
with the exception of the skin and choroid layer of the eyes in pigmented rats, suggesting binding to 
melanin-containing tissues. In pigmented rats the elimination was slow from many tissues including the 
adrenal cortex, Harderian gland, intraorbital lachrymal gland, liver, submaxilliary salivary gland, 
pigmented fur/skin, and eye choroid layer where radioactivity persisted up to 2 weeks post-dose and it 
persisted up to 4 weeks post-dose in adrenal cortex and liver. At 8 weeks post-dose, small amounts of 
radioactivity were still detected in the choroid layer of the eyes and pigmented fur/skin. In toxicology 
studies, including phototoxicity, cataract was observed in animals whereas this finding was not reported 
in clinical trials. A conventional mass balance study using  [14C]- labelled cariprazine was not conducted 
in healthy volunteers due to safety concerns as the eyes could have been exposed to radioactivity for a 
long duration. Therefore, there is an incomplete understanding of possible additional circulating 
drug-related material in human plasma.  
Following a single oral 3 mg/kg dose of [14C]-cariprazine to timed-pregnant female rats on Day 13 -18 of 
gestation, radioactivity, as measured by QWBA, was widely distributed to maternal tissues, crossed the 
placenta, and was quickly distributed to fetal tissues. At 2 h post-dosing, radioactivity concentration in 
fetus was approximately 1.7 times higher than that in maternal plasma. Radioactivity concentrations 
were still present in ovary, uterus, fetal liver, fetal kidney and fetal brain at 48 h after administration. 
Metabolism 
Biotransformation of cariprazine in nonclinical species was represented by liver P450 metabolism, 
including demethylation (desmethyl cariprazine and didesmethyl cariprazine), hydroxylation (hydroxy 
cariprazine) and a combination of demethylation and hydroxylation (hydroxy desmethyl cariprazine and 
hydroxy didesmethyl cariprazine) in rat and dog. Hydroxylated metabolites (hydroxy cariprazine and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/353055/2017  
Page 19/162 
 
 
 
 
 
hydroxy desmethyl cariprazine) are subsequently biotransformed to their corresponding sulfate and 
glucuronide conjugates. All three hydroxy metabolites were excreted mainly in feces, while the 
glucuronide and sulfate conjugates were excreted mainly in urine. Cariprazine was also extensively 
metabolized by e.g. hydroxylation and demethylation in humans and less than 5% of the dose was 
excreted as unchanged drug. 
Among all identified metabolites, DCAR and DDCAR are considered the two major active metabolites since 
their steady-state AUC was >10% (40% for DCAR and 3-fold for DDCAR) of that for the parent drug. 
Excretion 
Cariprazine was mainly eliminated by metabolism, with only a small fraction of the dose excreted 
unchanged. Excretion of radioactive material following administration of oral doses of radiolabelled [14C] 
cariprazine was studied in rats and dogs. The radioactivity of cariprazine and its metabolites was 
recovered in feces and urine in both species. The primary route of elimination of cariprazine and its 
metabolites was biliary (approximately 77% of the dose in rats and approximately 62% of the dose in 
dogs) with renal excretion as a minor route (approximately 15% of the dose in rats and approximately 
21% of the dose in dogs). The biliary excretion was confirmed as the primary route of elimination in 
bile-duct cannulated rats, where approximately 72 % of the single oral dose of [14C] cariprazine was 
excreted in bile. 
2.4.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
In mice and female rats, the minimum lethal dose after oral administration of cariprazine was 100 mg/kg, 
corresponding to a HED of 8.1 to 16 mg/kg. In male rats, the minimum lethal dose was approximately 
200 mg/kg, corresponding to a HED of 32 mg/kg. Drug-related clinical findings preceding death in both 
mice and rats included lethargy, ataxia, hunched posture, decreased activity, palpebral closure and 
hypothermia.   
Repeat dose toxicity 
Cariprazine has been evaluated in repeat-dose toxicity studies in Wistar rats (up to 26 weeks with 4 
weeks recovery) and in Beagle dogs (up to 52 weeks with 8 weeks recovery).  To minimize signs of acute 
toxicity and enable adaptation, a dose-escalation period of ~2 to 4 weeks prior to administration at the 
final dose levels were included in most pivotal repeat-dose oral toxicity studies. The main target organs of 
toxicity are CNS, adrenal cortex, eye, female reproductive organs and potentially the sciatic nerve. In 
addition, pronounced decreases in plasma cholesterol and triglycerides levels were observed. 
Pre-terminal mortalities considered as likely related to cariprazine treatment were seen in all species. In 
the 7-week study in Tg.rasH2 and CByB6F1 hybrid mice, one mouse given 140 mg/kg/day (cariprazine 
AUC ~43600 ng∙h/mL) was found dead on Day 51, after displaying adverse clinical signs on Day 50. In the 
4-week rat study, 1 rat was sacrificed moribund at 12.5 mg/kg/day (cariprazine AUC ~5600 ng∙h/mL), 
and at 50 mg/kg/day (cariprazine AUC ~10500 to 28500 ng∙h/mL), in total 15 rats were either found 
dead or sacrificed moribund.  Most rats showed adverse clinical signs prior to death/sacrifice. In the 
13-week dog study, one dog was found dead after 22 doses at 8 mg/kg/day (cariprazine AUC ~5700 
ng∙h/mL). This dog did not display adverse clinical signs and the cause of death was not revealed during 
necropsy. However, in the absence of an explanation for the cause of death, a relation to treatment is 
considered likely.  
Clinical signs in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats, and dogs were mainly neurologic in nature 
and included tremor, disorientation, abnormal gait, decreased motor activity, flat body posture, limb 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/353055/2017  
Page 20/162 
 
 
 
 
 
abduction, lower lip retraction, increased or decreased muscle tone, back muscle contraction, hunched 
posture, lethargy, piloerection, brown/yellow fur staining, and chromodacryorrhea. The CNS signs are 
attributed to the exaggerated primary pharmacological activity of cariprazine and showed a 
dose-dependent incidence and severity. No or few clinical signs were observed in the sub-chronic studies 
in rats and in the chronic dog study due to adaptation.  Decreases in body weight, body weight gain and 
food consumption were observed in many studies. 
Lung findings 
In rats, non-reversible alveolar macrophage foci, accompanied by alveolar inflammation, were observed 
in the 4-week toxicity study at dose levels above the MTD. In the 13-week toxicity study, discolored tan 
foci associated with an increased incidence in alveolar/intra-alveolar macrophages with foamy cytoplasm 
with/without inflammatory cell infiltrate/hemorrhage were observed. In the 26-week toxicity study, 
alveolar/intra-alveolar macrophages with foamy cytoplasm were observed in males at 10 mg/kg/day and 
in females at all dose levels. No reversibility was demonstrated. Lung samples of females given 12.5 
mg/kg/day were further examined by EM examination, showing presence of concentric lamellar bodies 
within lysosomes in the cytoplasm of Type II pneumocytes or macrophages, indicating the occurrence of 
PLD. The NOAEL for the lung PLD is 3 mg/kg for males corresponding to 3.5-fold clinical exposure based 
on cariprazine AUC. A NOEL for females was not identified (≤1 mg/kg/day). Similar lung findings were 
also observed in the rat carcinogenicity study. In dogs, reversible focal lung discoloration, correlating with 
alveolar/intra-alveolar foamy macrophages was observed in the 13-week toxicity study. In the 52-week 
study, minimal to moderate alveolar/intra-alveolar foamy macrophages with or without cholesterol clefts 
consistent with PLD and accompanied by subacute/chronic inflammation/fibrosis were noted in males at 
all dose levels and in females at ≥2 mg/kg/day. At the end of 2-month recovery period, findings in the 
lungs were minimal to slight and were still present in dogs at 4 and 6 mg/kg/day, indicating incomplete, 
but partial reversibility. The NOEL for PLD was 1 mg/kg/day in female dogs corresponding to 2.3-fold 
clinical exposure based on cariprazine AUC. A NOEL for males was not identified (≤1 mg/kg/day). 
PLD-like changes were also observed in mice. In the 6-week study in CByB6F1 hybrid mice, multifocal 
accumulations of foamy alveolar macrophages were observed in all cariprazine-treated groups with no 
apparent dose-relation. In the 28-week carcinogenicity study in transgenic Tg.rasH2 mice histiocytic 
multifocal infiltration was noted at dose levels ≥15 mg/kg/day.  
Adrenal gland findings  
The adrenal gland was a target organ of toxicity in rats, dogs and mice and included dose-related 
increases in adrenal gland size/weight, discoloration and cortex hypertrophy/hyperplasia. In a 4-week rat 
study, multifocal cystic degeneration in zona fasciculate and diffuse dilated sinusoids were observed at a 
dose level above the MTD. At lower dose levels, vacuolation of the zona fasciculata and diffuse cortical 
hypertrophy were observed with no NOEL identified. No microscopic changes were seen in the rat 13- and 
26-week studies although the adrenal gland was enlarged with increased weight in female rats at ≥12.5 
mg/kg/day. In the rat 2-year carcinogenicity study, minimal increases in the incidence of 
hypertrophy/hyperplasia and vacuolization of the adrenal cortex were observed in male rats at ≥2.5 
mg/kg/day. 
In the dog 13-week and 52-week studies, enlarged size and increased adrenal gland weight, and foamy 
vacuolation of the cortical zona fasciculata cells were observed. To further characterise these lesions, 
electron microscopy was performed on adrenal gland samples in the 13-week study.  The EM identified 
concentric lamellar inclusions within the cytoplasm of adrenal cortical cells or macrophages that were 
considered morphologically consistent with PLD. In the 52-week study, PLD, as indicated by foamy 
cytoplasm in the zona fasciculata cells, was observed at all dose levels except at 1 mg/kg/day in male 
dogs. Similar findings were observed at the end of the 8-week recovery phase indicating a lack of 
reversibility. Additional, reversible, findings in the cells of the cortical zonae fasciculata and glomerulosa 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/353055/2017  
Page 21/162 
 
 
 
 
 
(arcuata) included hypertrophy/hyperplasia and vesiculation/vacuolation observed at ≥4 mg/kg/day in 
both sexes. A NOEL for PLD-like changes in the adrenals could not be determined and is ≤1 mg/kg/day 
and consequently there is no margin of exposure to the clinical exposure. The NOEL for adrenal cortex 
hypertrophy/hyperplasia and vesiculation/vacuolation is 2 mg/kg/day corresponding to 6.9- and 5-fold 
clinical exposure based on cariprazine AUC, in male and female dogs, respectively. 
In mouse studies, increases in adrenal gland size/weight, discoloration and cortex hypertrophy were 
noted.  In addition, lipofuscin pigment deposition, mainly at the corticomedullary interface, was observed 
in the 28-week carcinogenicity study in mice. 
Ocular findings (cataracts and retinal degeneration) 
Effects in the eyes were observed in the 13-week and 1-year toxicity studies in dogs (cataracts, lens 
degeneration, cystic degeneration and detachment of the retina) and in the 2-year carcinogenicity study 
in rats (increased incidence and severity of age-related retinal degeneration/atrophy). 
In the dog 13-week study, posterior subcapsular cataracts were noted at the ophthalmology examination 
in 2/5 males and 4/6 females at 8 mg/kg/day. The microscopic investigation revealed minimal to mild lens 
fiber swelling in the posterior pole of the lens or in the anterior cortex, sometimes in association with the 
cataracts. During the 4-week recovery period, cataract present at termination of dosing, progressed in 
2/4 dogs, and dogs without previous cataracts developed them. The NOEL for the cataracts and the lens 
fiber swelling was 3 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 8.7- and 7-fold clinical exposure based on cariprazine 
AUC in male and female dogs, respectively. In a dog ERG study with the same dose levels and duration of 
treatment, cataracts were also seen in 1/6 males at 3 mg/kg/day and in 5/6 males and 3/6 females at 8 
mg/kg/day. In this study, the NOEL for the cataracts in males was 1 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 
3.3-fold clinical exposure based on cariprazine AUC, and in females, 3 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 
8.8-fold clinical exposure based on cariprazine AUC. 
In the dog 52-week study, ophthalmoscopy revealed cataracts in several animals of both sexes at 4 
mg/kg/day and in most animals at 6 mg/kg/day, with a dose-related incidence and severity. During the 
8-week recovery period, no new cataracts developed but the cataracts seen at the high dose progressed. 
Like in the 13-week study, lens fiber swelling was observed microscopically, however, at an increased 
severity and at lower dose levels. Although the severity in males at 1 and 2 mg/kg/day and in females at 
2 mg/kg/day was minimal and showed reversibility, the findings progressed in incidence and severity at 
higher dose levels and are therefore considered as significant. In addition, a non-reversible cystic 
degeneration of the retina of moderate degree was also observed at ≥4 mg/kg/day. Taken together, the 
NOEL for the lens fiber swelling in female dogs was 1 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 2.3-fold clinical 
exposure based on cariprazine AUC while no NOEL was established in male dogs. The NOEL for cataract 
formation and retinal toxicity was 2 mg/kg/day in both sexes, corresponding to 6.9- and 5-fold clinical 
exposure based on cariprazine AUC, in male and female dogs, respectively. No cataracts were observed 
in rats or mice. Retinal degeneration/atrophy was also noted in the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study. This 
age-related finding occurred in all groups, including controls, but was present with increased incidence 
and/or severity in cariprazine-treated rats, predominantly in females. To further investigate the potential 
for retinal toxicity, a 13-week ERG study was conducted in dogs. This study revealed no 
cariprazine-related retinal effects although cataracts were observed clinically. The NOEL for ERG effects 
was therefore 8 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 28- and 22-fold clinical exposure based on cariprazine AUC 
in male and female dogs, respectively.

The female reproductive tract was a target organ in rats and mice, but not in dogs.  The changes observed 
include vaginal epithelial atrophy and mucification in the 28-day study and reduction in the number of 
corpora lutea in the ovaries, abnormal estrus cycling, and mammary gland hyperplasia and increased 
secretion in female rats, observed generally in all studies and at all dose levels. Most changes were 
reversible or partial reversible during the recovery periods. In male rats, there were microscopic 
alterations in the reproductive tract in the 4-week study at dose levels around or above MTD (12.5 to 50 
mg/kg/day), but not in studies of longer duration at lower dose levels or in any other species investigated.  
In the rat fertility study, cariprazine did not affect male reproduction, whereas female fertility was 
compromised.  
Sciatic nerve findings in rats 
Peripheral nerve lesions (myelin fragmentation or axonal degeneration of the sciatic nerve) were noted in 
the rat 28-day and 26-week studies and in the 2-year carcinogenicity study, but not in dogs or mice. In 
the 4-week toxicity study, minimal sciatic nerve myelin fragmentation was observed in all rats, including 
controls although slight increases in severity or incidence was observed at the highest dose levels. The 
finding was considered as equivocal by the study pathologist. In the 26-week-month toxicity study, 
axonal degeneration of a minimal degree was observed at a similar incidence in all female rats, including 
controls. The severity was slightly increased in females at 12.5 mg/kg/day (1 female slight and 1 female 
moderate). In the 2-year carcinogenicity study, the sciatic nerve fiber degeneration with axonal swelling, 
digestion chambers containing degraded axonal material, and replacement of axons by connective tissue, 
was noted in all groups, including controls, but with an increased incidence and/or severity in some 
cariprazine-treated groups. In males, an increase in the incidence and severity of the sciatic nerve 
degeneration was observed at the high dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day, 75% in controls, minimal to moderate; 
versus 92%, minimal to severe. In females, an increased incidence was observed at all dose levels; 55%, 
85%, 85%, and 80% animals at 0, 1, 2.5 and 7.5 mg/kg/day, respectively). However, the severity was 
graded as minimal to severe in most dose groups.  
Effects on plasma cholesterol and triglycerides 
Plasma cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly decreased in rats, dogs and mice. These decreases 
were dose-related and reversibility was shown in some studies. In some studies, also body weight gain 
and food consumption were reduced, but the decreased levels were also observed in some studies in the 
absence of notable effects on body weight or food consumption.  
In rats, marked, but reversible decreases in total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, phospholipids, 
and triglycerides were observed above MTD in the 4-week study. Similar decreases in cholesterol and in 
triglycerides were seen in the 13- and 26-week studies. In the latter study, decreases were not fully 
reversible. Decreases were also observed in the 2-year carcinogenicity study. In dogs, dose-related 
decreases in cholesterol and triglycerides were observed at all dose levels in the 13-week study. 
Reversibility was observed for cholesterol while triglycerides remained reduced. In this study, a 
decreased body weight gain was noted at all dose levels in males and at the highest dose (8 mg/kg/day) 
in females, associated with decreased food consumption at the same dose levels. In the 52-week study, 
decreased cholesterol was noted in males at all dose levels while only noted in females at the highest 
dose. Triglycerides were decreased in males at ≥2 mg/kg/day and in females at all dose levels. These 
alterations were reversible following the 8-week recovery period. In this study, there were no significant 
effects on body weight gains or food consumption. In mice, dose-related decreases in cholesterol and 
triglycerides were noted at all dose levels in the 4-week study in CByB6F1 hybrid mice.  Reduced body 
weight gain with no apparent effect on food consumption was also noted at all dose levels.

Genotoxicity 
A complete package of genotoxicity studies in agreement with ICH S2(R1) guidance, including test for 
gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations in vitro, and chromosomal aberrations in vivo, have been 
performed with cariprazine. In addition, an in vitro mouse lymphoma TK assay was performed. 
Cariprazine was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation or in the human lymphocyte 
chromosomal aberrations assays in vitro. In the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, small but statistically 
significant increases in mutant frequency at cytotoxic concentrations were observed in the absence and 
presence of metabolic activation. In the in vivo micronucleus study, cariprazine was concluded as 
negative when tested up to the 75 mg/kg/day (MTD). In this study, satellite animals were included and 
sampled but no TK data were generated. The NOEL of 75 mg/kg corresponds to a HED of 6 mg/kg 
(corresponding to an approximate daily dose of 300 mg in a 50 kg patient). Based on the negative 
findings in three mutagenicity studies, the weight of evidence suggests that cariprazine has negligible 
mutagenic potential.  
Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenic potential of cariprazine was evaluated in a 28-week study in Tg-rasH2 transgenic mice 
and a 2-year carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats. In the 28-week study mouse study, there were no 
significant increases in neoplastic changes due to cariprazine treatment. All neoplasms are considered 
incidental and/or due to the common spontaneous tumor incidences in the model.  In conclusion, 
cariprazine up to doses of 15 mg/kg/day in males (18-fold clinical exposure based on AUC) and 50 
mg/kg/day in females (53-fold clinical exposure based on AUC) did not induce a significant carcinogenic 
response in Tg-rasH2 hemizygous mice. 
In the 2-year rat study, there were no statistically significant increases in the incidence of tumors in 
cariprazine-treated males. In females, there was a slight increase in the incidence of benign neoplasms of 
the adrenal medulla (pheochromocytoma) seen in 4/60 rats, 6.6% at the highest dose 7.5 mg/kg/day. A 
Pathology Working Group was further involved in the evaluation of this finding and concluded that the 
increased incidence is likely due to spontaneous variation in the incidence of this common neoplasm in the 
Wistar rat strain, and not directly related to cariprazine-treatment. In the literature, spontaneous 
incidences of pheochromocytoma of 1.61% (range 0 to 6%) in aged Wistar rats have been reported 
(Walsh and Poteracki, 1994). In addition, pheochromocytomas are known to develop in rats following 
treatment with a wide variety of xenobiotics, and rats appear to be more sensitive than other species 
(Greaves 2007). In female rats, two other tumors were statistically significant on trend tests (but not 
pairwise comparisons) and included benign skin fibroma and malignant schwannoma. Based on the low 
incidences and the lack of statistical significance, the benign skin fibroma and malignant schwannoma are 
considered incidental and not related to cariprazine treatment. Malignant schwannoma in vagina was 
observed in 2/60 (3.3%) females at 7.5 mg/kg/day, but none in the other treated or control groups. In 
literature, a spontaneous incidence of 1.3% (range 0-3.4%) has been reported (Calrus et al 2013). 
Therefore, the conclusion of the Applicant that there were no cariprazine-related effects on the incidence, 
distribution or nature of neoplastic changes is agreed with. In conclusion, cariprazine up to doses of 2.5 
mg/kg/day in males (5.3-fold clinical cariprazine exposure based on AUC) and 7.5 mg/kg/day in females 
(13-fold clinical cariprazine exposure based on AUC) did not induce a significant carcinogenic response in 
Wistar rats. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development

In female rats, longer mean estrous cycle lengths were observed at all dose levels (1 to 10 mg/kg/day), 
and as a result, extended precoital intervals were noted with lower fertility and conception indices. At 10 
mg/kg/day, a decrease in the mean number of implantation sites was noted and as a result, the mean 
numbers of pups born and live litter sizes were lower than concurrent control values. There was no effect 
on F1 postnatal survival and pup body weight through PND 1. Based on above, the NOAEL for female 
fertility is considered to be lower than 1.0 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL for F1 early embryonic toxicity is 3.0 
mg/kg/day. No TK assessments in females were included in this study. The NOAELs correspond to HEDs 
≤0.16 and 0.48 mg/kg, respectively.  
In male rats, no effects considered cariprazine-related were observed on fertility, copulation or 
spermatogenic endpoints. The early embryonic developmental toxicity was also unaffected by male 
cariprazine administration. Based on above, the NOAEL for male fertility and early embryonic 
developmental toxicity was considered to be 10 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 10-fold clinical exposure 
based on cariprazine AUC. 
Embryo-fetal development 
Embryo-foetal development studies were performed with cariprazine in rats and rabbits. In the pivotal rat 
study, maternal toxicity including clinical signs and reduced body weight gain was observed at ≥2.5 
mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for maternal systemic toxicity is 0.5 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 0.7-fold clinical 
exposure based on cariprazine AUC. Cariprazine caused foetal developmental toxicity at all dose levels 
(0.5 to 7.5 mg/kg/day) and included reduced foetal body weight, decreased male anogenital distance and 
skeletal malformations of bent limb bones, scapula and humerus. At dose levels ≥2.5 mg/kg/day, foetal 
external malformations (localized foetal thoracic edema), visceral variations 
(undeveloped/underdeveloped renal papillae and/or distended urethrae) and skeletal developmental 
variations (bent ribs, unossified sternebrae) were observed. The external malformation, localised foetal 
thoracic edema and additionally a generalized edema, were also seen in the rat DRF study at higher dose 
levels. Based on above, the NOAEL for embryo-foetal development in rats is lower than 0.5 mg/kg/day 
corresponding to less than 0.7-fold clinical exposure based on cariprazine AUC.  
In the pivotal rabbit study, maternal toxicity was observed as reduced body weight, body weight gains 
and food consumption at the highest dose evaluated, 5 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity is 1 
mg/kg/day, corresponding to 1.3-fold clinical exposure based on cariprazine AUC on GD20. There were no 
significant cariprazine-related effects on pregnancy or foetal parameters at any dose level and the NOEL 
for embryo-foetal development is 5 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 11-fold clinical exposure based on 
cariprazine AUC on GD20.  
Pre- and post-natal development, including maternal function 
In the pivotal study, there was no F0 maternal systemic toxicity observed at any dose level (0.1 to 1 
mg/kg/day). Adverse effects were noted in both the F1 and F2 generations of F0 females given 1 
mg/kg/day. In the F1 generation, cariprazine-related findings include clinical observations (small stature, 
pale/cyanotic body, gasping, cold to touch), decreased postnatal survival, lower birth weights, body 
weights and body weight gains during the post-weaning period when compared to controls. In addition, a 
decreased auditory startle response was observed in males only. In F1 pups found dead, renal papillae not 
developed or not fully developed were observed and generally no milk was present in the stomach of 
pups. The F1 reproductive performance was unaffected by maternal cariprazine administration. In the F2 
generation, cariprazine-related findings included lower birth weights, clinical signs similar to those in the 
F1 generation and lower body weight on post-natal Day 4. Based on above, the NOAEL for maternal 
systemic toxicity was 1 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 0.9-fold clinical exposure based on cariprazine AUC 
on GD6. The NOAEL for F1 and F2 generation developmental effects was 0.3 mg/kg/day. The maternal 
cariprazine AUC exposure at this dose level is below the recommended clinical exposure.

Lacteal transfer 
A lacteal transfer study in pregnant rats showed that cariprazine and metabolites DCAR and DDCAR are 
detected in maternal milk at 2 hours post-dose. The milk concentrations of cariprazine were 1.6 to 
2.8-fold higher than that in maternal plasma. At 4 hours post-dose, cariprazine was detected in pup 
plasma at very low levels, while the metabolites DCAR and DDCAR were below the limit of detection (<1 
ng/mL).  
Local Tolerance  
No dedicated local tolerance studies have been conducted with cariprazine. The intended clinical oral 
administration route was adequately assessed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies.  
Other toxicity studies 
Metabolites 
In humans, two major human metabolites have been identified, DCAR and DDCAR. Both are 
pharmacologically active metabolites. The genotoxic potential of the metabolite DDCAR was assessed in 
two in vitro studies.  DDCAR was not mutagenic in the Ames test. In the chromosome aberration test, a 
small but statistically significant increased incidence of structural chromosome aberrations was observed 
in the presence of metabolic activation at the highest concentration evaluated. This concentration was 
cytotoxic as DDCAR reduced the mitotic index by 54%. No clastogenic signal was noted in the absence of 
metabolic activation. In the mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies with cariprazine, no significant 
carcinogenic response was observed. For DDCAR, given the negative Ames test, and the lack of a 
significant carcinogenicity response with AUC exposure margins of 2.5 to 6 in the mouse carcinogenicity 
study, but less than 1 in the rat study, the weight of evidence suggests a negligible genotoxic potential for 
DDCAR. 
No dedicated genotoxicity studies were conducted with DCAR. However, DCAR is considered as 
adequately evaluated in the mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies. The DCAR exposure margins versus 
clinical AUC exposure are 11- and 30-fold in male and female mice, respectively, and 1.8- and 2.1-fold in 
male and female rats, respectively. In addition, both DDCAR and DCAR are considered as adequately 
evaluated in the repeat-dose and reprotoxicology studies. 
2.4.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Cariprazine is a small molecule (Mw <500 g/mol), freely soluble in methanol and poorly soluble in water 
at pH 7 (1.3mg/L < 100 mg/L; ENV/JM/MONO(2000)6).  
While logD exceeds 3, it is unlikely that the substance has potential for bioaccumulation. Considering the 
data below, cariprazine is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

Initially, the Applicant did neither fully evaluate, nor provide an in-depth discussion of the dependence 
potential of cariprazine, which is mandatory for CNS-active compounds in line with the pertinent 
European guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/94227/2004). Based on the pharmacological profile e.g. receptor 
binding (with special regards to preferential affinity for DA D3 receptors) and functional profile (in vitro), 
DA D3 and D2 receptor occupancy in brain and the in vivo functional data from rat models of cocaine 
addiction, cariprazine and its major active metabolites (DDCAR, DCAR) are not expected to demonstrate 
abuse or dependence liability. Furthermore, clinical experiences with antipsychotics displaying receptor 
profile similar to cariprazine (e.g. aripiprazole or brexpiprazole) have not shown any abuse or dependence 
liability. 
The pharmacokinetics studies appear to have been conducted in accordance with legal requirements and 
available guidelines. The nonclinical absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) studies 
have been conducted, IV and PO, in the same species as used in the toxicology studies (PO in rat, dog, 
rabbit and monkey).  
Cariprazine is a lipophilic compound (Mw 427.41), with low pH-dependent solubility (BCS class 2) and 
high permeability. The single oral dose studies indicate rapid absorption in mouse, rat and dog with Cmax 
generally observed after 0.5-1 h in rodents, 1-2 h in dogs and after  2 h in monkey. The absolute oral 
bioavailability was 52-63% in rats and ~ 64-80% dogs, indicating incomplete absorption and some 
first-pass effect. The apparent elimination half-life ranged from 2 - 3 hrs in rat, 3 – 6 hrs in monkey and 
4 - 7 hrs in dog. Co-administration with food had limited effects on cariprazine exposure and PK 
parameters in animals. No apparent gender differences in PK parameters were noted. There was evidence 
of limited accumulation of cariprazine, DCAR, and DDCAR (<2-fold) following multiple daily dosing in 
rodents and dogs, which is, however, in contrast with clinical data. 
The in vivo tissue distribution in rat was fast and showed that cariprazine related radioactivity was well 
distributed into most tissues through 2 hr post-dose, with the tissue/blood ratios >5 in the majority of 
tissues, indicating accumulation in these tissues. The highest concentrations were found in the organs 
generally involved in drug absorption (gastrointestinal tract), biotransformation (liver) and excretion 
(kidney), but high concentration of radioactivity was also found in e.g. adrenal cortex, Harderian gland,

pituitary gland, lungs and in ovary and uterus of female rats. In pigmented rats, there was high amount 
of radioactivity in skin and choroid layer of the eyes in pigmented rats, suggesting binding to 
melanin-containing tissues. The elimination was slow from many tissues and radioactivity persisted up to 
4 weeks post-dose in adrenal cortex and liver and it was still detected in pigmented skin and in the choroid 
layer of the eyes at 8 weeks post-dose. 
Biotransformation of cariprazine in nonclinical species (rat and dog) and human involves liver P450 
metabolism, including demethylation (desmethyl cariprazine and didesmethyl cariprazine), hydroxylation 
(hydroxy cariprazine) and a combination of demethylation and hydroxylation. 
The toxicological profile of cariprazine has been evaluated in a comprehensive set of non-clinical studies 
in agreement with relevant guidelines.  
Ocular toxicity including cataracts and retinal degeneration was observed in several dog studies. In rat 
distribution studies, the choroid layer of the eye was one of the tissues with the highest [14C] 
cariprazine-derived radioactivity detected for up to 8 weeks post-dose suggesting melanin-binding and a 
potential for ocular toxicity. While melanin-binding per se, is not predictive of ocular toxicity, it cannot be 
excluded that potential release of cariprazine and/or metabolites from melanin may cause high local 
concentrations of active compound(s). Although the mechanism underlying the cataract development in 
dogs is unclear, the weight of evidence suggests that the effect may be secondary to the significant 
decreases in cholesterol and triglycerides in all toxicology species, indicating an effect of cariprazine on 
lipid synthesis/metabolism. A potential contribution of PLD to the adverse ocular effects seems unlikely as 
there was no evidence of PLD-related histopathological changes in any of the ocular tissues, including lens 
and retina.  
There is an extensive body of literature indicating that cataracts are induced in animals and/or humans by 
cholesterol lowering drugs acting at different steps in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway; HMG-CoA 
reductase (lovastatin), oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) (U18666A) or 3-beta-hydroxysterol 
delta-24-reductase (triparanol). In dogs, cataracts have been found in safety studies of lovastatin, 
fluvastatin, and simvastatin. Also in humans, statin therapy seems to be associated with an increased risk 
of cataract development. Another marketed product that causes cataracts in dogs is Seroquel (quetiapine 
fumarate), a psychotropic agent found to cause posterior, axial triangular cataracts in dogs. The exact 
mechanism by which Seroquel causes cataracts in dogs is unknown, but dose-dependent reduction in 
plasma cholesterol was observed and interference with cholesterol biosynthesis was suspected. To date, 
there appears not to be an association of Seroquel treatment and cataract formation in humans. A 
correlation between cataract development and cholesterol metabolism is also seen in some inherited 
diseases in man.  The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, mevalonic aciduria and cerebrotendinous 
xanthomatosis all involve mutations in enzymes of cholesterol metabolism, and are associated with 
increased risk of cataracts. The cause of cataracts in these diseases was postulated to be due to the 
decrease in cholesterol level in the lens. Support for this hypothesis was derived from a hereditary 
cataractous rat strain, Shumiya cataract rat, where mutations were identified in genes which function in 
the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Cataract onset was associated with a specific combination of 
mutant alleles that decreased cholesterol levels in cataractous lenses to about 57% of normal.  
In summary, the mechanism of the cataract formation in dogs has not been fully established. Based on 
available literature, it is agreed that there is an association between reduced cholesterol levels and 
cataract formation and that dogs seem a sensitive species, and that this may be a plausible explanation. 
However, as there were no significant reductions noted in blood cholesterol in human clinical trials and 
that an association of cariprazine-treatment and lenticular changes and potentially also cataracts cannot 
currently be fully excluded, other potential/additional mechanisms may be involved. Cataracts were 
proposed to be included as a potential important risk in the RMP and warnings included in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC.

Apart from cataracts, retinal detachment/cystic degeneration were observed at doses ≥4 mg/kg/day in 
the 52-week dog study. As further clarified by the Applicant, the retinal changes were limited to animals 
with hypermature cataracts and associated lens resorption. As there was a 100% correlation between the 
retinal changes and advanced stage of cataract, the dog retinal changes are considered likely secondary 
to the cataracts and not due to a direct retinal toxicity. Additionally, literature describes uveitis-induced 
retinal lesions similar to those observed in the 52-week dog study and mild uveitis was present in eyes 
with resorbing cataracts. Regarding the retinal changes observed in the 2-year rat study, it is agreed with 
the Applicant that the etiology of the retinal findings are different in rats and dogs and that the findings in 
rats likely represent an exacerbation of common background lesions associated with behavioral changes 
and/or increased survival affecting exposure to light and are found with drugs acting on the CNS. This 
albino rat-specific response is not considered to represent a risk to humans. Taken together, the available 
data do not indicate a direct retinal toxicity of cariprazine. Available clinical data do not indicate retinal 
toxicity. 
The adrenal gland was a target organ of toxicity in rats, dogs and mice. The Applicant suggests several 
plausible mechanisms for the observed adrenal effects, including ACTH stimulation caused by stress, 
5HT1A agonism, or hyperprolactinemia, and secondary effects due to the decreased cholesterol levels. 
Based on the available data, all proposed mechanisms seem reasonable, and do not indicate a direct 
toxicity of carprazine of the adrenal gland. 
The adrenal gland changes seen in the early rat studies at high dose levels around the MTD are considered 
likely stress-related. In the longer studies (≥13 weeks), a potential role of 5HT1A agonism was also 
proposed. In the literature, 5HT1A agonists have been reported to induce increase in serum ACTH (and 
prolactin) levels in rats. In toxicity studies with aripiprazole, another antipsychotic drug similar 5HT1A 
partial agonist properties as cariprazine, adrenal cortex hypertrophy with normal adrenocortical function 
as evidenced by significantly increased circulating levels of ACTH and corticosterone has been reported in 
rat studies. In addition, hyperprolactinemia has been shown to induce secretion of ACTH, and 
hyperprolactinemic rats and mice have been reported to show an increased adrenal weight without any 
associated histological changes. As the effects were most prominent in female rats and data showing that 
cariprazine induced hyperprolactinaemia to a greater extent in female rats, disturbed regulation of 
prolactin appears to be a possible mechanism. Finally, plasma cholesterol reduction was consistently 
observed being greatest in high dose females in all rat studies (81%, 64% and 60% in the 13-, 26- and 
104-week studies, respectively). Literature data support that drugs with inhibitory effects on cholesterol 
synthesis can produce adrenal cortical hypertrophy/hyperplasia. 
In mice, the adrenal effects are likely related to cariprazine´s pharmacological properties. 
Hyperprolactinemia-related reproductive tract changes were observed at all dose levels in all studies. As 
further discussed by the Applicant, increased potassium levels were observed at all dose levels in both 
sexes in the 6- and 7-week studies with a potential relationship to the adrenal lesions. In the literature, 
hyperkalaemia is a proposed as a possible diagnostic feature of compromised functionality of the adrenal 
cortex. Although no overt adrenal gland toxicity was observed and this change occurred without other 
possible associated signs of adrenal insufficiency such as hyponatremia, hypochloremia and 
hypoglycemia, consistent occurrence at all dose levels in two studies suggests that it cannot be dismissed 
and it seems to be reasonable to consider it as a likely consequence of a slight deficiency in adrenocortical 
function.  A potential impairment of adrenal function may be related to the decreased cholesterol levels 
since the biosynthesis of steroid hormones in the adrenal cortex is initiated by the utilization of available 
free plasma cholesterol or stored pools of labile cholesterol. Group mean reductions in plasma cholesterol 
levels ranged from 51 to 88% in males and from 54 to 73% in females. Accordingly, in mice a slight 
insufficiency of adrenocortical function cannot be ruled out and the decreased cholesterol levels is 
considered as a likely mechanism while in the induction of adrenocortical hypertrophy, 5HT1A agonism 
and hyperprolactinaemia could also have contributory roles.

In dogs, the adrenal gland findings are considered likely related to chronic stress, as dose-related slight 
to marked thymic lymphoid cell depletion/atrophy, which is a common age- and stress-related finding, 
was present in all animals, but was most severe at ≥4 mg/kg/day. A relation of the observed PLD and the 
adrenal gland findings is considered unlikely as the PLD persisted during the 8 weeks recovery period of 
the 52-week study while the adrenal gland findings were reversible.  
Taken together, the mechanism for the adrenocortical changes is likely multifactorial with the most likely 
contributors being generalized stress (rats, dogs), pharmacological action via 5HT1A agonism (rodents) 
and/or an effect on prolactin regulation (rodents), and an effect on lipid metabolism (all species). The 
preclinical adrenal gland findings are not indicative of overt adrenocortical toxicity or adverse functional 
changes with the exception of mice where a slight functional deficit cannot be ruled out potentially caused 
by prominent reduction of plasma cholesterol, an important source of the biosynthesis of steroid 
hormones. The relevance and significance of the adrenal changes and proposed mechanisms to humans 
is likely to be limited as there was no clear signal for either adrenal toxicity, hyperprolactinaemia or 
significantly reduced plasma cholesterol in the human clinical trials.  Taken together, the adrenal gland 
changes observed in non-clinical studies are likely of low relevance for the human situation.  
Cariprazine caused phospholipidosis (PLD) sometimes associated with subacute/chronic inflammation, 
and haemorrhage in the lungs of rat, dog and mouse. PLD is commonly associated with cationic 
amphiphilic agents such as cariprazine. As further outlined by the Applicant, PLD-associated inflammatory 
changes as consequences of prolonged PLD are often seen in chronic toxicity studies and the changes 
seen in the cariprazine toxicology studies do not differ from that described in the literature. The functional 
consequences of the observed lung PLD remain uncertain, although there were no obvious functional 
deficits in the affected animals. Taken together, it is agreed that the observed lung findings in cariprazine 
toxicology studies are similar to that commonly observed in toxicity studies after administration of CADs 
and are unlikely to represent a significant human risk. Although the human relevance is unclear, there 
were no relevant AEs observed in the clinical database with regard to respiratory/pulmonary symptoms. 
In addition, the findings are expected to be reversible following drug discontinuation. Therefore, it was 
agreed that no further risk minimisation measures are deemed necessary. 
Plasma cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly decreased in rats, dogs and mice. These decreases 
were dose-related and reversibility was shown in some studies. In some studies, also body weight gain 
and food consumption were reduced, but the decreased levels were also observed in some studies in the 
absence of notable effects on body weight or food consumption. The underlying mechanism of the 
decreased cholesterol and triglyceride levels are not clear. While general malnutrition may have 
contributed to the decreases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels in some rat and mouse studies, the 
most likely potential mechanism is that cariprazine inhibits the synthesis of cholesterol and triglycerides. 
In the clinical trials there was no significant reduction in blood plasma cholesterol and triglycerides 
therefore clinical consequences are considered unlikely. 
The observed effects in female reproductive organs are likely caused by cariprazine´s D2 receptor 
blocking activity resulting in prolactin elevations. Evaluation of prolactin levels was not included in 
repeat-dose toxicity studies, but in an investigative 14-day study in female rats, cariprazine increased 
mean prolactin levels 87- and 256-fold control values at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
Prolactin-mediated effects are also evident in the rat fertility study. However, in cariprazine clinical trials, 
there were no noteworthy effects on prolactin levels.  
The peripheral nerve lesions seen in rats are considered as equivocal.  An additional review of the lesions 
seen in the 26-weeks toxicity and 2-year carcinogenicity studies in rats was conducted by a veterinary 
neuropathologist with the conclusion that cariprazine may exacerbate the age-related spontaneous 
neuropathic process and given the frequency of the spontaneous sciatic nerve neuropathy findings, the 
toxicological significance of these findings relative to test article administration appears questionable. The 
Assessment report

reviewer also noted that the overall incidence of the sciatic nerve lesions in rats was very low, and that no 
peripheral nerve lesions were observed in dogs and mice. Therefore, the relevance of this finding to 
human risk is unknown but appears to be unlikely.  
In the rabbit embryo-foetal development study, no adverse effects where noted at cariprazine AUC 
exposures corresponding to 11-fold clinical exposure. In rats, external and skeletal malformations were 
observed with a NOAEL at exposures below the recommended clinical exposure. Placental transfer of 
cariprazine and metabolites DDCAR and DCAR was confirmed in both rats and rabbits. In rats, the pup 
cariprazine exposure was approximately similar to maternal levels, while in rabbits the pup cariprazine 
exposure was approximately 20% of maternal levels. In the pre- and postnatal development study, 
adverse effects were noted in the F1 generation in the absence of significant maternal toxicity. Effects 
were also noted in the F2 generation which is highly unusual. The maternal/offspring exposure 
assessment in various studies indicate that the rat foetal in utero cariprazine exposure is similar to the 
maternal exposure, while post-natal cariprazine exposure is negligible.  The adverse findings  in  rats 
(both teratogenic effects in the developmental toxicity study, as well as adverse effects in the 
F1-generation and unusual adverse findings in F2-generation observed in the peri- and postnatal study) 
raises serious concerns regarding exposure in pregnancy as well as of women of child bearing potential. 
For the intended target population this potential important risk maybe particularly challenging to handle 
at clinical use. It was therefore recommended that reproductive toxicity is included as an important 
potential risk in the RMP and that adequate warnings are included in the SmPC.  
The two major human metabolites, DCAR and DDCAR are considered as adequately evaluated in 
genotoxicity/carcinogenicity, repeat-dose and reprotoxicology studies. According to the Applicant, a mass 
balance study of cariprazine in humans following oral administration of [14C] cariprazine was not feasible 
as cariprazine and/or its metabolite(s) have strong affinity to the eyes of pigmented rats. Consequently, 
there is insufficient understanding of the circulating drug-related material in plasma and it is therefore not 
possible to conclude that all human metabolites have been adequately evaluated in non-clinical species. 
Based on additional data provided by the applicant, and given the potential risk for lenticular changes and 
cataracts, the CHMP established that a radioactive mass balance study in humans is not necessary. The 
available data indicate a low risk for the occurrence of a unique major human metabolite. If present, a 
potential risk for a mutagenic or carcinogenic potential may be regarded as low as the cariprazine 
metabolites share the predominant structural moieties of the parent substance, and as neither 
cariprazine, nor its major human metabolites DCAR and DDCAR unveiled any mutagenic or carcinogenic 
potential.  
2.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data provided were considered sufficient together with additional measures as specified 
in the discussion section to support this dossier. 
2.5.  Clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction

2.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Cariprazine has pH dependent solubility. At pH 6, 5 mg could be dissolved in 250 mL minimizing the need 
for a study with a PPI. No absolute bioavailability study was performed.   
Administration of a high-fat breakfast delayed the absorption of cariprazine (median Tmax increased from 
4 hours to 9 hours), increased the AUC0-∞ by ~12%, decreased the Cmax by < 5%, and did not change

the terminal elimination half-life. The effect of food on the exposure of DCAR and DDCAR metabolites was 
also minimal. 
The intended to be marketed capsule was used in the phase 3 studies.  
Distribution 
Cariprazine is highly bound to plasma proteins with an unbound fraction of 0.04. The metabolites DCAR 
and DDACR have unbound fractions of 0.05 and 0.07, respectively. All three active moieties protein 
binding was independent of concentration except a slight concentration dependency for DCAR and 
DDCAR. However the effect was minimal in the concentration range used. 
The concentrations of cariprazine, DCAR, and DDCAR in cerebrospinal fluid were approximately 5%-10%, 
4%-6%, and 3%-8% of the respective concentrations in plasma following subchronic administration for 
15 days. Plasma:blood ratio of cariprazine was approximately 1.2-1.3. 
The apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) determined in multiple dose studies by non-compartmental 
analysis is about 1000 L. 
Elimination  
The half-life of cariprazine is between 1 and 3 days. The metabolites DCAR has a half-life of 1 to 2 days 
and DDCAR half-life is ranging between 2 to 3 weeks, but the determination is uncertain.  
Based on population PK analysis, the effective half-life leading to steady state is about 1 to 1.5 day for 
cariprazine and DCAR and 6 to 9 days for DDCAR. Approximately 90% of steady state is reached in about 
4 to 5 days for cariprazine and DCAR and 21 to 31 days for DDCAR.  
Average values of cariprazine oral clearance (CL/F) were usually between approximately 20 L/h and 30 
L/h.  
Excretion 
No mass-balance study following oral administration of [14C] cariprazine was performed. The excretion 
and metabolism of cariprazine in humans was studied following oral administration of multiple doses of 
cariprazine hydrochloride to three schizophrenic patients by collecting plasma and excreta on day 26 and 
30. The daily dose was 12.5 mg.  
The overall average daily excretion of cariprazine and its metabolites in urine for the 3 patients was 21% 
of the daily dose. Approximately 1.2% of the daily dose was excreted in urine as unchanged cariprazine. 
The major metabolite excreted in urine was DDCPPC acid and it accounted for approximately 6.6% of the 
daily dose. Approximately 4.0 and 0.4% of the daily dose were excreted as the DDCAR and DCAR 
metabolites in urine, respectively. 
The overall average daily excretion of cariprazine and its metabolites in faeces for the three patients was 
approximately 40 % of the daily dose. Approximately 3.7% of the daily dose was excreted as unchanged 
cariprazine. The major metabolite excreted was hydroxy-cariprazine (HC) and it accounted for 
approximately 23% of the daily dose. Similar amount of hydroxy-DCAR (4.3% of the daily dose), 
hydroxy-DDCAR (5.1% of the daily dose) and DDCAR (3.5% of the daily dose) metabolites was excreted 
in faeces. Only a trace amount of the dose was excreted in faeces as the DCAR metabolite (0.7% of the 
daily dose).

Figure 1.  Proposed metabolic pathway of cariprazine
Total excretion in the three patients was 42, 67% and 73%, of the administered dose respectively.  
Metabolism 
In vitro incubations show that both CYP3A and CYP2D6 are involved in the metabolism of cariprazine. 
Based on the in vitro data the formation of DCAR both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 seems to be involved. The in 
vitro formation of DDCAR from DCAR was minimally inhibited by ketoconazole and quinidine indicating 
minor involvement of CYP3A and CYP2D6.  DDCAR elimination seems to involve minor CYP3A4 as only 
trace amounts of hydroxy-DDCAR could be found after incubations with recombinant CYP3A4. Other 
enzymes might therefore be involved in the elimination of DDCAR. 
In clinical studies a number of plasma metabolites were found circulating and in most studies the two 
active metabolites DCAR and DDCAR have been evaluated. After multiple administrations the exposure to 
DCAR was 30-35% of the AUC of cariprazine. The exposure to DDCAR was a least 2-fold higher than that 
of cariprazine.

Consequences of possible genetic polymorphism 
The enzyme CYP2D6 may be involved in the metabolism of cariprazine based on in vitro metabolism data. 
There was no dedicated CYP2D6 genotype pharmacokinetic study. The effect of CYP2D6 genetic 
polymorphism was however evaluated in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
There were 868 patients classified as extensive metabolizers (EMs; defined as ultra, extensive, and 
intermediate metabolizers) and 40 patients classified as poor metabolizers (PMs). The effect of CYP2D6 
metabolizer status was evaluated by comparing the distribution of empirical Bayesian estimates (EBE’s) 
between different categories of CYP2D6 metabolizer status There were no statistically significant 
differences (α = 0.05) for cariprazine, DCAR, DDCAR, or Total Cariprazine moiety exposures for PM 
patients as compared to EM patients. 
Special Populations 
No study was performed in subjects with renal impairment. The population PK analysis included data from 
2844 patients. Among these patients, 520 (18%) had mild renal impairment, 24 (1%) had moderate 
renal impairment, and 2300 (81%) had normal renal function. There was no statistically significant 
relationship identified between plasma clearance of either moiety and creatinine clearance. The use of 
cariprazine in severe renal impairment has not been investigated.   
A study was performed in mild and moderate hepatic impairment using both single (1 mg) and multiple 
dosing for 14 days using 0.5 mg. The results showed that compared to healthy subjects, subjects with 
either mild or moderate hepatic impairment had up to ~25% higher exposure for cariprazine and up to 
~45% lower exposure for DCAR and DDCAR (see below). The unbound fraction was not determined in this 
study. However ex vivo plasma samples were used to investigate whether unbound data would change 
the conclusions. The SmPC recommendations did not change when unbound data was included.

Pharmacokinetics of cariprazine has not been evaluated in paediatric subjects (<18 years of age) and in 
the elderly (>65 years of age). 
Race, gender and body weight were found to be covariates in the final population PK analysis, however 
the covariate effects are generally small and no dose adjustment is proposed.

Cariprazine and DDCAR were shown to be inhibitors of P-gp in Caco-2 cells with IC50s of 2.1 µM and 12.2 
µM respectively. Thus, a risk for a clinically relevant drug-drug interactions due to cariprazine Pgp- 
inhibition at the intestinal level cannot be excluded base on these data, whereas the risk for  systemic 
inhibition of cariprazine is expected to be low.  DCAR was not a P-gp inhibitor.

Cariprazine (5 -100 µM) did not demonstrate strong competitive inhibition of the P450s tested (CYP1A2, 
CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2CI9 and CYP3A4); except a weak inhibitory effect on CYP2D6 with Ki values of 
33.5-36 µM.  
Using pre-incubation up to 30 min 200 µM cariprazine did not exhibit significant mechanism based 
inhibition in the CYP enzyme activities compared to the control incubations. Cariprazine, DCAR and 
DDCAR did not inhibit the CYP enzymes the concentration range tested (0.025 μM - 5 μM), or the 
inhibition was very weak even at the highest test concentration (less than 20%).   
In the CYP induction study using human hepatocytes cariprazine showed less than 100% increase in 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 mRNA at its 50- fold mean unbound Cmax concentration. The results 
showed over 100% increase of CYP3A4 mRNA at higher concentrations expected to occur in the intestinal 
compared to vehicle control, indicating that the risk for clinically significant induction of CYP3A in the 
intestine cannot be excluded.  DCAR and DDCAR showed less than 100% increase in CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and 
CYP3A4 mRNA compared to vehicle control.  
Based on in vitro studies it could be concluded that cariprazine, DCAR and DDCAR are not inhibitors of the 
transporters OAT1, OAT3, OCT2 OATP1B1 or 1B3.  
Effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of cariprazine  
A DDI study with parallel group design administering 400 mg ketoconazole daily for 10 days together with 
0.5-mg cariprazine increased cariprazine Cmax and AUC by 3.42- to 3.88-fold compared to cariprazine 
arm, the half-life was increased to 85 h compared to 67 h. The systemic exposure to DCAR was 65% to 
68% of that in the cariprazine arm and the half-life was 74 h compared to 47 h. The exposure to DDCAR 
was increased with 1.4 fold and a slight prolongation of the half-life.  
Based on in vitro studies it could be concluded that cariprazine, DCAR and DDCAR are neither OATP1B1 
nor OATP1B3 substrates. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Cariprazine and its metabolites DCAR and DDCAR accumulate due to long half-life. The accumulation is 
predictable and additional time dependency is not evident. In a population PK analysis a shift in some 
distribution parameters were modelled for the first day of dosing but this has no importance for chronic 
dosing. 
After repeated administration the exposure to cariprazine, DCAR and DDCAR is proportional to dose in the 
range from 1.5 mg to 12.5 mg. In the population PK analysis, apparent clearance for cariprazine, DCAR 
and DDCAR was independent of dose. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Cariprazine is an orally active and potent dopamine D3/D2 receptor partial agonist with preferential 
binding to D3 receptors and partial agonist at serotonin 5-HT1A receptors. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
D3/D2 Receptor Occupancy 
The receptor occupancy with positron emission tomography (PET) technique has been studied in three 
studies. Study RGH-188-003 has been performed in healthy volunteers and shown that after repeated 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/353055/2017  
Page 42/162 
 
 
 
 
 
cariprazine dosing for 14 days (0.5 mg for 2 days and 1 mg for 12 days), regional occupancies in brain 
regions with known D3/D2 receptors were around 70%. In study RGH-MD-14 performed in patients with 
schizophrenia, maximum occupancy of ≥ 90% of the D3/D2 receptors at 3 mg/day; at a 1.5-mg/day 
dose, 76% to 86% occupancy of the D3/D2 receptors was observed across all brain regions including 
basal ganglia structures, i.e., caudate nucleus, putamen, and nucleus accumbens. In study RGH-PK-15, 
near complete receptor occupancy at both D2 and D3 receptor types was observed at 12 mg/day after 15 
days of dosing for cariprazine and its metabolites in patients with schizophrenia. At the lowest dose of 1 
mg/day, mean D3 and D2 occupancy was 76% (range 58% to 89%) and 45% (range 14% to 64%), 
respectively. At the dose of 3 mg/day, mean D3 and D2 occupancy was 92% (range 86% to 96%) and 
79% (range 68% to 88%), respectively.  
Effects on QT Interval 
The effect of 9 mg/day and 18 mg/day cariprazine on cardiac repolarization was investigated in a 
multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo, and moxifloxacin-controlled, parallel-group study in 
patients with schizophrenia. There was no evidence that cariprazine results in statistically or clinically 
significant QTc prolongation following 9 mg/day, the highest tested dose in confirmatory trials to show 
efficacy, and a supratherapeutic dose (18 mg/day). No patients treated with cariprazine experienced QTc 
increases > 60 msec from baseline, nor did any patient experience a QTc of > 500 msec in the study 
(RGH-MD-02). In a population PK-PD analysis, data from 11 studies were used to quantitatively evaluate 
the potential for QTcF prolongation by cariprazine plasma exposures. No clinically meaningful relationship 
between TOTAL cariprazine plasma concentrations and QTcF prolongation over the dose range of 0.5 to 
21 mg/day was found (RGH-MS-02). A linear mixed effects model was developed to characterize and 
quantify the relationship between QTcF and time-matched predicted total concentration. Based on the 
model, QTcF is predicted to decrease by 1.2 msec for every 100 nM increase in total concentration. At the 
maximum total concentration of 431.6 nM observed in this patient population, QTcF is predicted to 
decrease by 5.18 msec. The placebo effect is a constant reduction of QTcF from baseline of 2.64 msec 
while on treatment. 
Exposure-response modelling of PANSS 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses were performed to characterize PANSS total score, PANSS 
negative score, and PANSS positive score in patients with schizophrenia. Models were developed to 
characterize the time-course of PANSS scores in the absence of treatment as well as exposure-response 
relationships for cariprazine and 2 metabolites, DCAR and DDCAR. A total of 10,327 observations from 
1756 patients were included in the PK/PD dataset for these analyses. Of the 1756 patients included in 
these analyses, 370 were from the Phase 2 Study RGH-MD-03, 535 were from the Phase 2b Study 
RGH-MD-16, and 425 and 26 were, respectively, from the Phase 3 Studies RGH-MD-04 and RGH-MD-05. 
The final population PK/PD model for PANSS total scores was comprised of a Weibull time-course model 
to characterize placebo response and a sigmoid Emax model to describe the effect of combined 
cariprazine, DCAR, and DDCAR exposures (total Cave). The maximum pharmacologic effect of total Cave, 
corrected for placebo effect, was an 11.8% reduction in PANSS total score, however, this Emax was 
reduced to 3.11% in patients from Study RGH-MD-03. The Cave resulting in half-maximal effect (EC50) 
was estimated to 55 nM, corresponding to approximately 3 mg. The effect model included a Hill coefficient 
that was estimated to 2.11 indicating a steep exposure-response. Because of the steep 
exposure-response relationship, only minor incremental reductions in PANSS total scores are predicted 
for higher exposures. Comparing dose levels, the model predicted incremental improvement in total 
PANSS score is 172% (3 mg vs 1.5 mg) , 42% (4.5 mg vs 3 mg), 17% (6 mg vs 4.5 mg), 13% (9 mg vs 
6 mg)and 5% (12 mg vs 9 mg). The figure below illustrates the modelled exposure response augmented 
with the expected steady state average plasma concentration (active moiety) for each dose level.

Exposure-response modeling of selected Adverse Events 
Exposure-safety models were developed to relate the risk of experiencing selected TEAEs to individual 
measures of exposure, defined as the time-weighted total Cave for the dosing regimen of the patient on 
the date of the first occurrence of the AE or the time-weighted highest total Cave for patients not 
experiencing the event. The AEs evaluated included the following: Treatment-emergent occurrence of 
akathisia, EPS without akathisia or restlessness, nausea and/or vomiting and treatment-emergent 
occurrence of parkinsonism cluster. Logistic regression analysis was used to relate drug exposure and 
other covariate effects to dichotomous endpoints characterized with 2 levels of response (0 = not 
experiencing the event, and 1 = experiencing the event). A statistically significant relation between the 
probability of having a TEAE and exposure was not seen. However, a numerical increase in the probability 
of TEAEs was seen with increasing dose. 
2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacological effect of cariprazine appears to be mediated by both parent compound and the 
metabolites DCAR and DDCAR. It can be agreed that the sum of cariprazine, DCAR and DDCAR is the 
active moiety. 
Based on the fact that a [14C] labelled human mass balance study was not performed there remains a 
lack of full understanding of the existence of any human unique metabolite in plasma. The Applicant has 
described the investigation that has been performed to further examine the presence of any human 
unique metabolite. This includes three different investigations: a) six potential human-specific 
metabolites (whose structures were chosen on the basis of the potential biotransformation’s of 
cariprazine by commonly observed metabolic pathways) were synthesized as standards and their 
presence was checked in human plasma by LC-HRMS and LC-MS/MS; b) further extracted ion 
chromatogram (EIC)-based data mining of the existing LC-MS/MS data obtained from plasma; c) 
theoretical modelling of potential metabolite pathways. None of these methods detected any hitherto 
unidentified human-specific metabolites. Although the probability that additional metabolites are formed 
in vivo in humans cannot be fully excluded, it is judged to be low.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/353055/2017  
Page 44/162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is generally established that a radioactive human mass balance should be a part of the drug 
development program in order to investigate the elimination pathways as well as to enable assessment of 
the relevance of non-clinical species with respect to formed human metabolites.  
However, the applicant argued that administration of any radioactive dose of cariprazine is not possible 
due to the following reasons: a) the need for steady state conditions in patients; b) lack of assay 
sensitivity with a low radioactive dose (2 µCi); c) safety related issues prohibit administration of higher 
radioactive doses ranging from 20-100 µCi.  Given the potential risk for lenticular changes and cataracts 
in human; i.e. potential serious toxicity to a sensitive organ, the request of a radioactive human mass 
balance study has been re-evaluated.   
In this case, the elimination of cariprazine is investigated to an acceptable level based on the data 
generated using the unlabelled mass balance data and performed DDI studies. Undoubtedly, with data 
from the unlabelled mass balance study only, there remains a lack of full understanding in the preclinical 
bridge regarding human metabolites. Of the reasons described above, this uncertainty is considered low.  
Based on the fact that the available data indicate a low risk for the occurrence of a unique major human 
metabolite with a risk for a mutagenic or carcinogenic potential, request for a further mass balance 
evaluation is not considered justified due to that the risk of prolonged ocular human exposure to 
radiolabelled cariprazine cannot be neglected. 
Cariprazine is considered to be a teratogen. A DDI study with an oral contraceptive is therefore needed 
and will be conducted post-approval. Adequate language in the SmPC awaiting the results of this study 
has been introduced.   
The Applicant has conducted a DDI study between cariprazine and ketoconazole, a strong 3A4 inhibitor. 
However, based on those result, the Applicant should also investigate the interaction between cariprazine 
and a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor to clarify whether a contraindication is required or if cariprazine could be 
used concomitantly with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, possibly using a reduced dose. In addition, the 
concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors with different CYP2D6 genotypes (PM, EM and UMs) 
should also be investigated. The study will be performed as PAM. 
According to the Drug Interaction Guideline, information of the formation and elimination of active 
metabolites should be investigated if there are pharmacologically active metabolites estimated based on 
unbound systemic exposure whose in vitro activity contributes to ≥ 50% of the in vivo target 
pharmacological effect. This is true at least for DDCAR and possible also for DCAR. There is limited data 
which enzyme(s) that is/are involved in the elimination of DDCAR. Additional in vitro studies should be 
performed to investigate the contribution of other not so common CYP enzymes such as CYP2C8, CYP2J2 
etc as well as other oxidative enzymes. This should be investigated as PAM.   
2.5.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
  DDI study with oral contraceptives 
 
in vitro studies to investigate the contribution of CYP enzymes such as CYP2C8, CYP2J2 etc as well 
as other oxidative enzymes. 
  Study exploring interaction between cariprazine and a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and the 
concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors with different CYP2D6 genotypes (PM, EM and 
UMs).

2.6.  Clinical efficacy 
The cariprazine program consisted of four 6-weeks, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies; one 
exploratory study and three confirmatory studies to assess efficacy in acute exacerbations of 
schizophrenia. The exploratory study (RGH-MD-03) used a flexible dose design. Two of the confirmatory 
studies (RGH-MD-04 and RHG-MD-16) used a fixed dose design with different cariprazine doses and 
aripiprazole 10 mg/day and risperidone 4 mg/day were included as active controls for assay sensitivity 
respectively. One study used a fixed/flexible dose design (RGH-MD-05). 
To support the efficacy in maintaining antipsychotic effect, a relapse prevention study, (RGH-MD-06), 
using a randomized withdrawal design, was submitted. In addition, the Applicant conducted study 
(RGH-188-005) addressing the effects of cariprazine on predominant negative symptoms.  
2.6.1.  Dose response study 
No formal dose-response studies were performed. The dose response relationship was primarily 
supported by the short-term clinical trials, mainly RGH-MD-03 and RGH-MD-16. 
2.6.2.  Main studies 
RGH-MD-04 
A double-blind, placebo and active-controlled evaluation of the safety and efficacy of cariprazine in the 
acute exacerbation of schizophrenia 
Methods 
This was a multinational, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, 
parallel-group, fixed-dose study, to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cariprazine in patients 
with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. A no-drug washout period of up to seven days followed by 6 
weeks of double-blind treatment and a 2 week safety follow-up phase.  
Patients who completed 6 weeks of double-blind treatment were eligible to enter a 52-week open-label 
extension study (RGH-MD-11). The patients not entering the extension phase were followed for 2 week 
safety follow-up phase, received treatment as usual and hospitalisation was optional. 
Study Participants  
Male or female inpatients 18-60 years of age, with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia (disorganized, 
catatonic, paranoid, or undifferentiated) as determined by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV 
(SCID) for a minimum of 1 year. Patients were required to have a PANSS-total score of at least 80 and a 
CGI-S of 4 at screening and at baseline. Patients were also required to have a rating of at least 4 
(moderate) on at least 2 of the following 4 PANSS positive symptoms: delusions, conceptual 
disorganization, hallucinatory behaviour, and suspiciousness/persecution.   
Treatments 
After the screening phase, all randomized patients entered the double-blind 6 weeks treatment phase and 
were administered capsules cariprazine 3 and 6 mg, aripiprazole 10 mg or placebo.

Objectives 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cariprazine relative to 
placebo in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in the PANSS total score at week 6.  
The secondary efficacy variable was change from baseline in the CGI-S score at week 6.  
The additional efficacy variables were the change from baseline at week 6 for the following: 
  NSA-16 total score and NSA-16 global negative symptoms rating 
  CGI-I score 
 
 
PANSS positive and PANSS negative sub score  
PANSS responders (≥ 30% improvement in PANSS total score) 
  SQLS-R4 total score, psychosocial score, and vitality score 
  CDR Attention Battery power of attention score, continuity of attention score, cognitive reaction 
time, and reaction time variability 
 
Tests color trails test part I and part II 
Sample size 
The primary efficacy parameter was the change from baseline to Week 6 in PANSS total score. Adjusting 
for the multiple comparisons involving the 2 efficacy endpoints and 2 cariprazine dose groups by using the 
matched parallel gatekeeping procedure, a sample size of 150 patients per treatment group provided 
88% power to detect an effect size (treatment group difference relative to pooled SD) of 0.42 for the 
primary efficacy parameter, at a 2-sided significance level of 5%, assuming a correlation coefficient of 
within-patient assessments of 0.7 and a dropout rate of 35%. 
Randomisation and blinding 
At the end of the screening phase, patients were randomized to one of four treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1 
ratio: placebo, cariprazine 3 mg, cariprazine 6 mg/day, or aripiprazole 10 mg/day. 
The investigational products were identical in appearance (size, shape, and color), taste, and packaging. 
Statistical methods 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population consisted of all patients in the Safety Population who had at least 1 
post baseline assessment of the PANSS total score. 
For the LOCF approach, only the post baseline total score of a parameter was imputed; the individual item 
scores were not carried forward. The baseline total score was carried forward only for the intermittent 
missing scores immediately after baseline. If all the post baseline values were missing, the baseline value 
was not carried forward. 
The primary efficacy parameter was the change from baseline in PANSS total score at Week 6. The 
primary analysis was performed using an MMRM with treatment group, study center, visit, and treatment 
group by visit interaction as the fixed effects and the baseline value and baseline value-by-visit

interaction as the covariates. An unstructured covariance matrix was used to model the covariance of 
within-patient scores. The Kenward-Roger approximation (Kenward and Roger, 1997) was used to 
estimate denominator degrees of freedom. This analysis was performed based on all postbaseline scores 
using only the observed cases without imputation of missing values. 
To control the overall type I error rate for the multiple comparisons across the primary and the secondary 
hypotheses, a matched parallel gatekeeping procedure (Chen et al, 2005) was applied.  
Analysis based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, using the LOCF approach, was also 
performed. The ANCOVA model included treatment group and study center as factors and baseline PANSS 
total score as a covariate.

Participant flow 
Recruitment 
A total of 617 patients were randomized and approximately two-thirds (66.5%) completed the study. The 
most frequent reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal of consent (12.3%), AE (10.7%), and 
insufficient therapeutic response (9.2%). There were no statistically significant differences between 
cariprazine 3 mg/day and placebo or cariprazine 6 mg/day and placebo in either overall discontinuation or 
in individual reasons for discontinuation.  
Conduct of the study 
This was a multi-centre study with 58 centres in total; 20 in the US, 12 in Romania, 14 in Russia and 12 
in Ukraine. The first patient was enrolled 23 April 2010 and the last patient completed the last visit 20th of 
December 2011.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy parameter was the change from baseline to week 6 in the PANSS-T score using a 
MMRM approach. A statistically greater change in the PANSS-T score was demonstrated for each 
cariprazine treatment group compare to the placebo group with a larger treatment difference observed 
for the cariprazine 6 mg/day treatment group. The LOCF analyses also indicated the same statistically

Ancillary analyses 
The results of the additional analyses of NSA-16 total score, CGI-I score, PANSS positive and negative 
scores and the NSA-16 global negative symptoms rating, SQLS-R4 total score, SQLS-R4 psychosocial 
score and SQLS-R4 vitality score were all consistent with the primary and secondary efficacy analyses, 
with statistically significant improvements relative to placebo seen for all treatment groups. In the CDR 
attention battery and colour trails test scores some improvements were seen in the cariprazine group 
A higher percentage of patients in the active treatment groups, cariprazine 3.0 and 6.0, (24.5% and 
31.8% respectively) and aripriprazole (30.0%) achieved a 30% or greater improvement in PANSS total 
score than patients receiving placebo (19.5%). Statistically significant differences from placebo were 
seen for the cariprazine 6 mg/day and aripiprazole treatments groups.

Methods 
This was a multinational, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
fixed/flexible-dose study, to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cariprazine in patients with 
acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. This study was 9 weeks in duration and consisted of a no-drug 
washout phase of up to seven days followed by 6 weeks of double-blind treatment and a 2-week safety 
follow-up phase.  
Study Participants  
Male or female inpatients 18-60 years of age, with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia (disorganized, 
catatonic, paranoid, or undifferentiated) as determined by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV 
(SCID) for a minimum of 1 year. Patients were required to have a PANSS-T score of at least 80 and a 
Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) of 4 at screening and at baseline. Patients were also 
required to have a rating of at least 4 (moderate) on at least 2 of the following 4 PANSS positive 
symptoms: delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behaviour, and 
suspiciousness/persecution 
Treatments 
After the washout period, all randomized patients entered the 6 week double-blind treatment period, 
during which they were administered cariprazine (3.0 mg or 6.0 mg/day) or placebo as a single daily oral 
dose. All patients were given one capsule for weeks 1 and 2, from week 3 to week 6 two capsules were 
administered if response was not adequate and no tolerability problems were found. Patients randomized 
to the low-dose cariprazine group (3-6 mg/day) received 4.5 mg/day for 2 days and 6 mg/day thereafter. 
Patients randomized to the high-dose cariprazine group (6-9 mg/day) received 7.5 mg/day for 2 days and 
9 mg/day thereafter. Patients not warranted a dose increase continued taking 1 capsule per day. Doses 
were fixed from the end of week 3 to 6. 
Objectives 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety, efficacy and tolerability of cariprazine relative to 
placebo in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in the PANSS total score at week 6.  
The secondary efficacy variable was change from baseline in the CGI-S score at week 6.  
The additional efficacy variables were the change from baseline at week 6 for the following: 
  NSA-16 total score and global negative symptoms rating 
  CGI-I score at week 6 
 
PANSS positive and PANSS negative score  
  SQLS-R4 


Sample size 
The primary efficacy parameter was the change from baseline to Week 6 in PANSS total score. Adjusting 
for the multiple comparisons involving the 2 efficacy endpoints and 2 cariprazine dose groups by using the 
matched parallel gatekeeping procedure, a sample size of 150 patients per treatment group provided 
88% power to detect an effect size (treatment group difference relative to pooled SD) of 0.42 for the 
primary efficacy parameter, at a 2-sided significance level of 5%, assuming a correlation coefficient of 
within-patient assessments of 0.7 and a dropout rate of 35%. 
Randomisation and blinding  
At the end of the screening phase, patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups in a 1:1:1 
ratio: placebo, cariprazine 3 -6 mg, or cariprazine 6-9 mg.  
The investigational products were identical in appearance (size, shape, and color), taste, and packaging. 
Statistical methods 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population consisted of all patients in the Safety Population who had at least 1 
postbaseline assessment of the PANSS total score. 
For the LOCF approach, only the postbaseline total score of a parameter was imputed; the individual item 
scores were not carried forward. The baseline total score was carried forward only for the intermittent 
missing scores immediately after baseline. If all the postbaseline values were missing, the baseline value 
was not carried forward. 
The primary efficacy parameter was the change from baseline in PANSS total score at Week 6. The 
primary analysis was performed using an MMRM with treatment group, study center, visit, and treatment 
group by visit interaction as the fixed effects and the baseline value and baseline value-by-visit 
interaction as the covariates. An unstructured covariance matrix was used to model the covariance of 
within-patient scores. The Kenward-Roger approximation (Kenward and Roger, 1997) was used to 
estimate denominator degrees of freedom. This analysis was performed based on all postbaseline scores 
using only the observed cases without imputation of missing values. 
To control the overall type I error rate for the multiple comparisons across the primary and the secondary 
hypotheses, a matched parallel gatekeeping procedure (Chen et al, 2005) was applied.  
A sensitivity analysis using a pattern-mixture model (PMM) based on non-future dependent missing value 
restrictions (Kenward et al, 2003) was performed to assess the robustness of the primary MMRM results 
to the possible violation of the missing-at-random assumption. 
Analysis based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, using the LOCF approach, was also 
performed. The ANCOVA model included treatment group and study center as factors and baseline PANSS 
total score as a covariate.

Recruitment 
A total of 446 patients were randomised and approximately 60% completed the study. The most frequent 
reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal of consent (16.4%), insufficient response (11.4%), and AEs 
(9.0%). Significantly more patients in the placebo group discontinued because of insufficient therapeutic 
response compared to the cariprazine groups. Significantly more patients in the cariprazine 6-9 mg/day 
group compared with the placebo group discontinued due to withdrawal of consent. 
Conduct of the study 
There were 41 centres in total; 15 in the US, 4 in Colombia, 19 in India, and 3 in South Africa. 
Two study centres were identified to have GCP violations in the study conduct and these data were not 
included in the efficacy or safety analyses. However, sensitivity analyses were performed with these 
study centres included.

Table 7.  Baseline efficacy variables-ITT population 
There were no imbalances between the groups with regard to baseline efficacy parameters. Most patients 
(76.5%) received concomitant medications during the double-blind treatment phase. The use of 
anti-Parkinson drugs and beta-blockers was much higher in the cariprazine 3-6 and 6-9 mg/day groups 
than in the placebo group. The most commonly used concomitant medications were psycholeptics, used 
most frequently in the cariprazine 6-9 mg/day group. Rescue medication was used similarly among the 
treatment groups.

Ancillary analyses 
Additional efficacy parameters were the change form baseline to week 6 in the PANSS positive and 
negative score, NSA-16 total score, NSA global negative symptoms rating, the CGI-I at week 6 and the 
percentage of PANSS responders at week 6. In addition, the change from baseline to week 6 in SQLS-R4 
total, psychological and vitality scores, CDR attention battery tests and color traits test, were considered 
additional parameters. Compared to placebo, significant differences were observed using the MMRM 
approach in the changes to week 6 in PANSS positive and negative scores, CGI-I score, and NSA-16 total 
score. Similar results were observed using the ANCOVA with LOCF approach.  
Compared to placebo, significant differences were observed in the changes to week 6 in SQLS-R4 total 
score and SLS-R4 vitality score for the cariprazine group 3-6 mg only. Compared to placebo, there were 
no significant differences in either of the cariprazine groups in the changes to week 6 in any of the CDR or 
CTT scores.

Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of RGH-188 in the acute exacerbation of schizophrenia 
Methods 
This was a multinational, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, 
parallel-group, fixed-dose study, to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cariprazine in patients 
with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. This study was 9 weeks in duration and consisted of a no-drug 
washout period of up to seven days followed by 6 weeks of double-blind treatment and a 2 week safety 
follow-up phase.  
Study Participants  
Male or female inpatients 18-60 years of age, with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia (disorganized, 
catatonic, paranoid, or undifferentiated) as determined by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV 
(SCID) for a minimum of 1 year. Patients were required to have a PANSS-T score of at least 80 and a

required to have a rating of at least 4 (moderate) on at least 2 of the following 4 PANSS positive 
symptoms: delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behaviour, and 
suspiciousness/persecution.  
Treatments 
After the washout period, all randomized patients entered the 6 week double-blind treatment period, 
during which they were administered cariprazine (1.5 mg, 3.0 mg or 4.5 mg/day), risperidone (4.0 
mg/day) or placebo as a single daily oral dose.

Sample size 
The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline (Visit 2) to Week 6 in the PANSS total score 
using the LOCF approach. Adjusting for multiple comparisons of 3 cariprazine treatment groups against 
placebo, a sample size of approximately 135 patients in each of the 4 treatment groups was determined 
sufficient to provide at least 80% power to detect an effect size (treatment group difference relative to 
pooled standard deviation) of 0.4. 
Randomisation and blinding  
At the end of the screening phase, patients were randomized to one of five treatment groups in a 
1:1:1:1:1 ratio: placebo, cariprazine 1.5 mg/d, cariprazine 3.0 mg/d, cariprazine 4.5 mg/d or risperidone 
4.0 mg/d.  
The investigational products were identical in appearance (size, shape, and color), taste, and packaging. 
Statistical methods 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population consisted of all patients in the Safety Population who had at least one 
postbaseline assessment of the primary efficacy parameter, the PANSS total score. 
The change from baseline (Visit 2) to Week 6 in PANSS total score was used as the primary efficacy 
parameter. The primary analysis was performed using the LOCF approach. 
Between-treatment group comparisons were performed by means of an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model with treatment group and study center as factors and the baseline PANSS total score as the 
covariate. To control the overall type I error for comparisons of 3 doses of RGH-188 with placebo, the 
following sequential multiple-comparison procedure was used. 
Step 1: The average effect of the 3.0-mg and 4.5-mg doses was compared with that of placebo. If the 
global test was significant at the 2-sided significance level of 0.05, then Step 2 was performed; otherwise, 
the analysis was stopped here. 
Step 2: Each effect of the 3.0-mg and 4.5-mg doses were compared with that of placebo at the 2-sided 
significance level of 0.05. If both tests for the 3.0-mg and 4.5-mg groups were statistically significant at 
the 2-sided significance level of 0.05, Step 3 was performed; otherwise the analysis was stopped here. 
Step 3: The effect of the 1.5-mg dose was compared with that of placebo at the 2-sided significance level 
of 0.05. 
In addition, 2 sensitivity analyses, both using the OC approach, were performed on the primary efficacy 
parameter. For the first analysis, between-treatment group comparisons at Week 6 were performed using 
the same ANCOVA model as described above; however, only observed cases at Week 6 were used in the 
analysis. For the second analysis, between-treatment group comparisons at Week 6 were performed 
using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment group, study center, visit, 
and treatment group-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and the baseline value and baseline-by-visit 
interaction as the covariates. The Kenward-Roger approximation was used to estimate denominator 
degrees of freedom (Kenward and Roger, 1997). An unstructured covariance matrix was used to model 
the covariance of within-patient scores. These analyses were performed based on all postbaseline scores 
using only the observed cases without imputation of missing values.

There were no statistically significant differences among the treatment groups with respect to 
demographics and physical characteristics. In general, the distribution of concurrent medical conditions 
was similar across treatment groups.

The treatment groups were generally well-balanced on the PANSS but a significant difference was 
observed in the CGI-S score. The baseline score was a covariate in the ANCOVA models used in the 
analysis of the efficacy parameters, this imbalance did not confound the results.  
Similar proportions of patients in each treatment group used at least one medication during the 
double-blind treatment period. Psycholeptics, anti-parkinsonian drugs, analgesics, and 
anti-inflammatory/anti-rheumatic agent were the most commonly used drugs classes. Anti-parkinsonian 
drugs, which were to be administered only after EPS scales were performed in order to support their 
administration, tended to be used by fewer patients in the placebo (17.2%) and the cariprazine 1.5 
mg/day (19.3%) groups relative to cariprazine 4.5 mg/day (24.5%) and risperidone (28.6%) treatment 
groups. Rescue medication was used equally in the treatment groups. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 732 patients were randomised and approximately two thirds (63.6%) completed the study. The 
most frequent reasons for discontinuation were insufficient response (12.8%), withdrawal of consent 
(11.7%) and AEs (9.5%). A statistically significantly greater percentage of patients in the placebo group 
discontinued because of insufficient therapeutic response compared to the cariprazine groups and the 
risperidone group. Fewer patients in the cariprazine and risperidone treatment groups compared with the 
placebo group discontinued because of adverse events. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy parameter was the change from baseline to week 6 in the PANSS total score using 
the LOCF approach. Statistical significance over placebo was observed for the average of the 3.0 and 4.5 
mg/day cariprazine treatments groups as well as for each cariprazine treatment group (1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 
mg/day) and for the risperidone treatment group. The mean change in the PANSS total score using the 
MMRM analysis was statistically significant relative to placebo for the average of the 3.0 and 4.5 mg/day 
cariprazine treatment groups and as well as for each of the cariprazine treatment groups. However, for 
the OC analyses, the average effect of the cariprazine treatment groups was not statistically significant 
relative to placebo. For the risperidone treatment group, the mean change in the PANSS total score at 
week 6 relative to placebo was statistically significant for both the MMRM and OC analyses.

The secondary efficacy endpoint  
The secondary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to week 6 in the CGI-S score using the 
LOCF approach. The change from baseline to week 6 in the CGI-S score averaged for the 3.0 and 4.5 
mg/day cariprazine treatment groups as well as for each cariprazine treatment group. The MMRM analysis 
also showed statistical significance relative to placebo for the average effect of the cariprazine 3.0 and 4.5 
mg/day treatment groups and for each cariprazine treatment group. However, for the OC analyses, the 
average effect of the cariprazine treatment groups was not statistically significant relative to placebo. For 
the risperidone treatment group, the change in the CGI-S score at week 6 relative to placebo was 
statistically significant using the LOCF and OC approach and the MMRM analysis.

week 6 and the percentage of PANSS responders at week 6. For all additional efficacy parameters, the 
average effect of the cariprazine 3.0 and 4.5 mg/day treatment groups and the 3 individual cariprazine 
treatment groups, as well as the risperidone treatment group showed significant improvement relative to 
placebo.

The screening phase was a no-drug washout phase of up to seven days during which the patient eligibility 
was assessed, followed by the run-in phase (RIP) during which patients received open-label cariprazine, 
flexibly dosed for the first 6 weeks and for the last 2 weeks the dose was fixed. Patients continued to the 
stabilization phase (SP) only if they met the predefined criteria: completion of the 8-week RIP, PANSS 
total score ≤ 60 at visit 8, at least 20% decrease in PANSS total score from baseline to end of week 8, 
CGI-S score ≤ 4 at visit 8, score of ≤4 on each of the following 7 PANSS items: P1, P2, P3, P6, P7, G8, and 
G14 at visit 8, stable dose during the last 2 weeks of the RIP, no significant tolerability issues as judged 
by the investigator at visit 8. During the SP, patients received 12 weeks of open-label treatment with 
cariprazine (3, 6, or 9 mg/day), the same dose that they were receiving in the last 2 weeks of the RIP. At 
visit 14, the double-blind phase (DBP) started and the patients were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment 
groups (cariprazine or placebo) in a 1:1 ration only if they met all of the following criteria: completion of 
the 12-week SP, PANSS total score ≤ 60 at visit 14, at least 20% decrease in PANSS total score from 
baseline to end of week 20, CGI-S score ≤ 4 at visit 14, score of ≤4 on each of the following 7 PANSS 
items: P1, P2, P3, P6, P7, G8, and G14 at visit 14, no significant tolerability issues as judged by the 
investigator at visit 14. During the DBP patients received either placebo or cariprazine at the same dose 
that they received during the SP. The duration of the DBP was variable (a maximum of 72 week and a 
minimum of 26 weeks or until ET including a relapse event). All patients were hospitalized during the 
screening phase and for the first 2 weeks of the RIP. They may remain hospitalized for an additional 2 
weeks. Patients who completed the study or who prematurely discontinued were followed for 4 more 
weeks, safety follow-up phase (SFU). During the SFU phase the patients received treatment as usual.  
Study Participants  
Male or female inpatients 18-60 years of age, with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia (disorganized,  
catatonic, paranoid, or undifferentiated) as determined by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV 
(SCID) for a minimum of 1 year. Patients were required to have a PANSS-T score ≥70 and ≤120 at visit 
1 and visit 2. Patients were also required to have a rating of at least 4 (moderate) on at least 2 of the 
following 4 PANSS positive symptoms: delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behaviour, 
and suspiciousness/persecution 
Treatments 
The cariprazine dosage ranged from 3 to 9 mg/day administered as a single dose in the evening. After the 
no-drug screening phase, all patients still meeting the eligibility criteria, continued to the RIP and were 
administered cariprazine 1.5 mg on day 1 and 3.0 mg on day 2. On day 4 the dose could be increased to 
4.5 mg/day, on day 6 to 6.0 mg/day and to 9 mg/day on day 10. The dose was only increased if response 
was not adequate and no tolerability problems were found. For the last 2 weeks the dose was fixed.  
Objectives 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cariprazine (RGH-188) relative to 
placebo in the prevention of relapse of symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy parameter was time to first relapse during the DBP. 
Relapse was defined as meeting any of the following criteria: 
Assessment report

Page 71/162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Psychiatric hospitalization due to worsening of the patient´s underlying condition 
Increase in PANSS total score by ≥30% for patients who scored 50 or higher at randomization or 
a 10-point or more increase for patients who scored less than 50 at randomization.  
 
Increase in the visit 14 CGI-S score by 2 or more points. 
  Deliberate self-injury or aggressive/violent behaviour. 
  Suicidal or homicidal ideation that was clinically significant. 
  Score of > 4 on 1 or more of the following PANSS items: P1, P2, P3, P, P7, G8, or G14.  
The additional efficacy variables 
  Change from baseline in PANSS total score 
  Change from baseline in PANSS positive and PANSS negative score  
  Change from baseline in PSP scale score 
  Change from baseline in CGI-S score  
  CGI-I score 
  Change from baseline in NSA-16 total score 
Sample size 
The calculation of power was based on a relapse hazard ratio of 0.48. This assumed a cumulative relapse 
rate at 26 weeks of 25% for the cariprazine group versus 45% for the placebo group. Under the 
assumption of constant hazard rates, this was equivalent to median times to relapse of 63 weeks for the 
cariprazine group versus 30 weeks for the placebo group. In addition, the calculation of power assumed 
a cumulative ET rate of 20% at 26 weeks due to reasons other than relapse for both treatment groups. 
Using these assumptions, a total of ≈80 relapse events in the DBP needed be observed in order to have 
90% power to detect a statistically significant difference between cariprazine and placebo, using 2-tailed, 
log-rank tests at an overall 5% level of significance. A total of ≈180 patients (≈90 patients per treatment 
group), randomized into the DBP at an average rate of approximately 4 patients per week, would have 
provided, on average, the required total of 80 relapse events in the DBP. 
Randomisation and blinding  
At visit 14 the patients were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups (cariprazine or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio.  
Statistical methods 
The Open-label Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population consisted of all patients in the Run-in Phase Safety 
Population who had at least 1 post baseline assessment of the PANSS during the open-label phase (OLP) 
of the study. 
The Randomized Population consisted of all patients in the Stabilization Phase Safety Population who were 
randomized to a treatment group during the DBP of the study. 
The Double-blind ITT Population consisted of all patients in the Double-blind Safety Population who had at 
least 1 post randomization assessment of PANSS or CGI-S during the DBP of the study. 
The primary efficacy parameter was the time to first relapse during the DBP, defined as the number of 
days from the randomization date to the relapse date. Relapse during the DBP was defined as meeting 1

or more of the following criteria: 1. Psychiatric hospitalization due to worsening of the patient’s underlying 
condition; 2. Increase in PANSS total score by ≥ 30% for patients who scored 50 or higher at 
randomization or a 10-point or more increase for patients who scored less than 50 at randomization; 3. 
Increase in the Visit 14 CGI-S score by 2 or more points 4. Deliberate self-injury or aggressive/violent 
behavior; 5. Suicidal or homicidal ideation that was clinically significant as judged by the Investigator; 6. 
Score of greater than 4 on 1 or more of the following PANSS items: P1, P2, P3, P6, P7, G8 or G14. Criteria 
2, 3, and 6 were to be confirmed at a repeat visit within 7 days, unless the repeat visit did not occur based 
on the discretion of the Investigator and noted in the eCRF. 
Patients who did not meet the above relapse criteria were censored at the time of completion or 
discontinuation from the study. 
The primary efficacy analysis compared the time to relapse between placebo and cariprazine groups using 
the log-rank test. Estimates of the hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals were based on the Cox 
proportional hazards model with treatment group as explanatory variable. The cumulative distribution 
function of time to relapse was characterized by the Kaplan-Meier estimate and curves. 
A post hoc sensitivity analysis was performed using reference-based controlled imputation to assess the 
robustness of the primary analysis results to the potential violation of the noninformative censoring 
assumption. The referenced-based sensitivity analysis uses a sensitivity parameter to characterize the 
gradual deviation from the noninformative censoring underlying the primary analysis toward the 
informative censoring, which assumes that the hazard of relapse for cariprazine-treated patients who 
discontinued is the same as the hazard for relapse for placebo-treated patients. A multiple imputation 
approach was used to implement the reference-based sensitivity analysis. Two hundred imputations were 
used to enhance the stability of the estimates.

Numbers analysed 
Of the 1149 patients who were screened for eligibility, 765 patients were enrolled and entered the RIP and 
364 patients continued into the SP. A total of 200 patients who completed the open-label treatment phase 
of the study were randomised to either placebo or cariprazine. The most frequent reasons for 
discontinuation during the OLP were withdrawal of consent and AEs. Discontinuation due to AEs occurred 
more frequently in the RIP than in the SP. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The time to first relapse during the DBP was the primary efficacy parameter. By the end of the DBP, 
47.5% of placebo-treated patients and 24.8% of cariprazine-treated patients had a relapse of 
schizophrenia. Time to relapse was significantly longer in the cariprazine group.

Ancillary analyses 
Additional efficacy parameters were the change from baseline in PANSS total scores and in positive and 
negative subscale scores. At the end of the open-label treatment with cariprazine, improvement from 
baseline scores was observed for the PANSS total score as well as for the positive and negative subscales. 
At the end of double-blind treatment, changes in scores form double-blind baseline were larger in the 
placebo group than in the cariprazine group for all PANSS scores. The changes in PANSS total score were 
similar for both the groups for the first 3-4 weeks of double-blind treatment and thereafter the change 
was greater in the placebo group.

At the end of the open-label treatment, 46.7% of patients in the treatment group and at the end of 
double-blind treatment period 3% of patients in both the placebo and the cariprazine treated group had 
≥30% improvement from baseline in PANSS total score. 
Mean CGI-I score at the end of open-label treatment was 2.8 and at the end of double-blind treatment 3.1 
in the placebo group and 2.5 in the cariprazine group.  
Mean change from baseline in NSA-16 total score at the end of open-label treatment was -8.2 and at the 
end of double-blind treatment 4.1 in the placebo group and 0.6 in the cariprazine group. 
Mean change form baseline in PSP scale score at the end of open-label treatment was 11.1 and at the end 
of double-blind treatment -7.2 in the placebo group and 0.0 in the cariprazine group.  
RGH-188-005 
A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
cariprazine in patients with predominant negative symptoms of schizophrenia 
Methods 
This was a multinational, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, active-referenced, parallel-group, 
fixed/flexible-dose, efficacy, and safety study, in adult patients with a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia 
having persistent, predominant negative symptoms and with a low level of positive symptoms. This study 
consisted of 3 periods. A 4-week prospective lead-in period was followed by a 26-week double-blind study 
treatment period, consisting of a 2-week study treatment up-titration phase and a 24-week study 
treatment continuation phase, and a 2-week safety follow-up period. At the screening visit, potential

patients were screened for the presence and the severity of negative symptoms. After the screening 
assessments, eligible patients entered the 4-week lead-in period during which the antipsychotic 
treatment was kept unchanged. An intermediate lead-in visit took place 14 days after the screening visit 
to assess the clinical status of the patients and they were reassessed using inclusion and exclusion criteria 
addressing stability. At the baseline visit the presence and the severity of the patient´s negative symptom 
and stability were again assessed. If the patients still were eligible for the study, they were randomized 
(1:1) to double-blind study medication, either cariprazine or risperidone. The 26-week double-blind study 
treatment period started thereafter.  
Study Participants  
Male or female patients 18-65 years of age, with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia (i.e. 295), all 
subtypes allowed, as determined by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) for a minimum of 2 
years. Predominant negative symptoms had to be present for at least 6 months at the screening visit. 
Patients were required to have a PANSS factor score for negative symptoms ≥24 and a score of ≥4 on a 
minimum 2 of the 3 PANSS items, N1-blunted affect, and N4-passive/apathetic social withdrawal, N6-lack 
of spontaneity and flow of conversation. A PANSS factor score for positive symptoms >19 was 
exclusionary. Patients were also excluded if rated a score of ≥4 on more than 2 of the following PANSS 
positive symptoms: delusions, hallucinatory behaviour, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, and 
unusual thought content. A CDSS total score of >6 would also be exclusionary. At intermediate lead-in 
visit the patients would have to continue to meet the visit 1 eligibility criteria and have a PANSS factor 
score for negative symptoms that diverged from the screening score by <25%. A PANSS factor score for 
positive symptom increased from the screening score by 25% would be exclusionary. Patients were also 
excluded if required pharmacologic treatment for EPS. At baseline the above criteria were also used.  
Treatments 
The cariprazine target dose was 4.5 mg/day and dose range 3.0 to 6.0 mg/day administered as a single 
dose in the evening. For risperidone the target dose was 4-0 mg/day and dose range 3.0 to 6.0 mg/day. 
Eligible patients at the screening visit were untreated, treated with 1 or with a combination of 2 
antipsychotic medications. After entering the study, the patients continued the same antipsychotic 
medication for the duration of the lead-in period. No changes were allowed during this period. The study 
treatment up-titration phase began on day 0 and from that day until day 6 patients received 1.5 mg/day 
of cariprazine or 2-0 mg/day of risperidone. From day 7 until day 13 the dose was increased to 3-0 mg of 
both cariprazine and risperidone. At the same time the dose of the antipsychotic medication that the 
patient took during the lead-in period was down titrated in 14 days. On day 14 the patients received the 
target dose of the study medication and the dose was fixed for 7 days. From day 21 until day 182 dose 
was in accordance with the dosing scheme and randomization schedule. The dose of the double-blind 
study medication could have been decreased/or increase in case of tolerability issues or impending 
psychotic deterioration, however only once during the study.  
Objectives 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cariprazine for the 
treatment of patients with schizophrenia having predominant negative symptoms 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy parameter was the change from baseline to endpoint in the PANSS factor score for 
negative symptoms.

The secondary efficacy parameter was the change from baseline to endpoint in the personal and social 
performance scores. 
Additional efficacy variables 
  Change from baseline in CGI-S score at week 26 
  Change from baseline in PANSS total score at week 26 
  Change from baseline in PANSS positive, PANSS negative, and PANSS general psychopathology  
subscale scores at week 26 
  CGI-I score at week 26 
  Change from baseline in PSP self-care, socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, 
and disturbing and aggressive behaviour area scores at week 26 
  Responders rates defined as a decrease of at least 20% in baseline PANSS factor score for 
negative symptoms at week 26 
Pseudo specificity analyses 
  Change from baseline in PANSS factor score for positive symptoms at week 26 
  Change form baseline in CDSS total score at week 26 
Sample size 
The primary efficacy parameter was the change from baseline to Week 26 in the PANSS factor score for 
negative symptoms. A planned sample size of 210 patients per treatment group was expected to provide 
at least 90% power to detect an effect size (treatment group difference relative to pooled standard 
deviation) of 0.25 at a 2-sided significance level of 5%, assuming a treatment difference of 2.25 points 
and a pooled SD of 9 points, a correlation coefficient of 0.2 between repeated measurements and 10% 
attrition rate. 
Randomisation and blinding 
The patients were randomized (1:1) to double-blind study medication, either cariprazine or risperidone.  
Statistical methods 
For the LOCF approach, only the post baseline total score of a parameter was imputed; individual item 
scores were not carried forward. If the study IMP was stopped for more than 5 days prior to the final 
assessment, the penultimate assessment was carried forward instead. The baseline total score was 
carried forward only for the intermittent missing scores immediately after baseline. If all the post baseline 
values were missing, the baseline value was not carried forward. 
The ITT population consisted of all patients in the safety population who had at least 1 post baseline 
assessment on the PANSS factor scores for negative symptoms. 
The primary efficacy parameter of this study was the change from baseline to Endpoint (Week 26/ET) in 
the PANSS factor score for negative symptoms. The primary analysis was performed using an MMRM, with 
treatment group, study center, visit, and treatment group–by-visit interaction as fixed effects and the 
baseline value and baseline value–by-visit interaction as the covariates. An unstructured covariance 
matrix was used to model the covariance of within-patient scores. However, in the event that this model 
did not converge, then the following covariance matrix would be used until the model converged: Toeplitz, 
first-order autoregressive and compound symmetry. Analysis was performed using PROC MIXED in SAS 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/353055/2017

and the resultant F-tests were based on Kenward-Roger’s adjusted denominator degrees of freedom 
(Kenward 1997). This analysis was performed based on all postbaseline scores using only the observed 
cases without imputation of missing values. 
A sensitivity analysis was performed using a pattern-mixture model, based on non-future dependent 
missing value restrictions (Kenward 2003) to assess the robustness of the primary MMRM results to the 
possible violation of the missing-at-random assumption. 
Analysis based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model using the LOCF approach was also 
performed. The ANCOVA model included treatment group and study center as factors and baseline PANSS 
factor score for negative symptoms as a covariate.

Recruitment 
Of the 533 patients who were screened, 461 patients were randomized and 460 patients were included in 
the safety population. A total of 356 patients (77.4%) completed the double-blind treatment period from 
baseline to week 26. The treatments were balanced with respect to the number and percentage of 
patients who discontinued early. The most common reasons for early discontinuation were AEs and 
withdrawal of consent. Discontinuation due to AEs occurred more frequently in the RIP than in the SP. 
Approximately 17% of patients in either treatment group completed the entire study. 
Conduct of the study 
This was a multi-centre study with 74 centres initiated and 66 of those screened or enrolled patients. The 
centres in the EU were located in Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Poland, Romania 
and Spain. In addition, Russia, Serbia and Ukraine recruited patients.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy parameter was the change from baseline to endpoint in the PANSS factor score for 
negative symptoms. The primary analysis was performed using an MMRM with treatment group, pooled 
study centre, visit, and treatment group-by visit interaction as fixed effects and the baseline value and 
baseline value-by –visit interaction as the covariates. The unstructured covariance matrix was allowed to 
be different for the 2 treatment groups. Using this model, there was a statistically significant difference in 
favour of cariprazine over risperidone (P=0.002)

Ancillary analyses 
The change from baseline in the CGI-S and the CGI-I scores were analysed using an MMRM analysis and 
a statistically significant difference (P=0.005 and P<0.001 respectively) in favour of cariprazine was seen 
at week 26.  
The change in PANSS negative subscale score was statistically significant in favour of cariprazine 
(P=0.001) and the change in PANSS positive subscale and the PANSS general psychopathology scores 
were not statistically significant. The change from baseline in PANSS total score was not statistically 
significant using the same analyses. 
The change from baseline in the PSP self-care using an MMRM a statistically significant difference 
(P=0-004) was seen in favour of cariprazine at week 26. In an analysis based on an ANCOVA model using 
the LOCF approach no statistically significant difference was seen. For the PSPs area socially useful 
activities and personal and social relationships scores statistically significant differences were seen for 
both areas using MMRM and ANCOVA model. The PSP area disturbing and aggressive behaviours did not 
show any statistically significant difference for neither the analysis.  
A total of 157 cariprazine-treated patients (69.2%) achieved decreases of at least 20% in PANSS factor 
score for negative symptoms compared to 133 risperidone-treated patients (58.1%), and a statistically 
significant difference (P=0.002) in favour of cariprazine was seen.

Extrapolation of Data to the EU Population  
Short-term efficacy study population consisted of 2,131 patients with schizophrenia, of whom 664 (31%) 
were from European countries (Romania (67), Russia (340), and Ukraine (257)). Approximately, 
one-third of the patients from studies RGH-MD-04 and RGH-MD-16 and half of the patients for study 
RGH-MD-05 were enrolled at centres from the United States, South American, South African and Asian

study centres. When analysing the data, specific analyses were performed to show that the gained foreign 
clinical data is representative for the EU population: 
The following region definitions were applied during the analyses. 
• European Union (EU): member states of the European Union 
• Europe: geographic Europe including EU member states, Russia, Serbia and Ukraine 
• European-non-EU: Russia, Serbia and Ukraine (geographic Europe excluding EU member states) 
Study RGH-188-005 in patients with predominant negative symptoms of schizophrenia was conducted 
solely in Europe. A subgroup analysis by region was performed with the aim of showing that cariprazine 
is an “ethnically insensitive” drug, meaning unlikely to behave differently in different populations. Regions 
in the analysis were EU versus European-non-EU countries. As the subgroup analysis of regions 
demonstrated, there was no clinically meaningful difference in the CFB to Week 26 in the primary efficacy 
parameter. 
Study RGH-MD-06 was performed in the US, India, Ukraine, Slovakia and Romania. In the cariprazine 
group during the double-blind phase 19 patients came from Romania and Slovakia (EU), whereas 38.6% 
(39/101) were from Eastern Europe i.e. Ukraine. As medical practice in Eastern European countries is 
very much comparable to medical practice in Ukraine and Russia, subgroup analyses were performed 
using the geographic region of Europe including Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine. The rate of relapse was 
similar for the European subgroup (Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine) p=0.005 and for the non-European 
(US, India) subgroup p=0.04; however the time to relapse was significantly longer for the non-European 
compared  to  the  European  subgroup.  Additionally,  the  hazard  ratio  vs.  placebo  was  better  for  the 
European  population  than  for  the  non-European  population  (0.36  and  0.53,  respectively).  Further 
analyses  were  performed dividing the  non-European  subgroup  into  US  and  Asia.  European  and  Asian 
patients showed the best relapse rates, while US patients the worst.  
Subgroup analyses by region were performed for Studies RGH-MD-04 and RGH-MD-16 only, since the 
other two short-term studies (RGH-MD-05, RGH-MD-03) did not have patients from Europe. 
Improvement in the PANSS total score was similar in both the European and the non-European population 
in the cariprazine groups, with the exception of the non-European patients in the cariprazine 3 mg/day 
group in Study RGH-MD-04 the difference over placebo was not statistically significant.

Clinical studies in special populations 
The main studies described above, included patients up to the age of 60 years. The study 
RGH-MD-188-005 included patients up to 65 years of age. 
STUDY A002-A7 A LONG-TERM STUDY OF MP-214 (CARIPRAZINE) IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PHASE 
OR ELDERLY SCHIZOPHRENIA 
This study was a multicentre, randomized, 48 week open-label, active (risperidone) controlled, 
parallel-group, flexible dose phase 3 study in Japanese adults and elderly with chronic phase or elderly 
schizophrenia. Long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy were to be studied. In elderly cariprazine group 
there were finally 17 patients (65-72 years) and in risperidone group 10 patients (65-70 years). 
With regard to efficacy, descriptive statistic scores for the difference from the baseline after 48 weeks of 
treatment (LOCF) for most parameters were slightly worse in cariprazine group and slightly better in 
risperidone group (e.g. PANSS-total score worsened 4.6 ± 21.4 in cariprazine group and improved -2.8 ± 
14.9 in risperidone group; CGI-S worsened 0.2 ± 1.1 in cariprazine group and improved -0.1 ± 1.1 in 
risperidone group). No conclusions can be made due to small number of patients. With regard to safety in 
elderly patients, although cariprazine treatment may have increased the incidence of adverse events such 
as schizophrenia or hypertension, adverse events leading to discontinuation among adverse events 
observed in several elderly patients in cariprazine group were schizophrenia (5/17 patients (29.7%)) and 
paranoia (2/17 patients (11.8%)); the corresponding figures for non-elderly patients were 16/66 patients 
(24.2%) for schizophrenia and 0/66 patients (0.0%) for paranoia. These figures are too small for any 
conclusions. 
Only 17 patients over 65 years of age were included into this Japanese study in the cariprazine group; no 
patients >65 years of age were included into the other schizophrenia studies.

RGH-MD-03: A Double-blind Placebo-Controlled Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of RGH-188 
in the Acute Exacerbation of Schizophrenia. 
Design 
This was a Phase 2, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
flexible-dose study conducted in the United States. The study enrolled male and female inpatients (18 to 
65 years) who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for schizophrenia and had a PANSS total score of ≥ 80 and ≤ 120, 
a PANSS item P1 (delusions) or P3 (hallucinatory behaviour) score of ≥ 4, and a PANSS item P2 
(conceptual disorganization) or P6 (suspiciousness/ persecution) score of ≥ 4. Patients were randomized 
to 1 of 3 treatment arms: placebo, cariprazine 1.5 to 4.5 mg/day, or cariprazine 6 to 12 mg/day. After a 
no-drug washout period of up to 7 days, randomized patients entered the 6-week double-blind treatment 
period and received cariprazine or placebo. Patients randomized to the cariprazine groups received 1.5 
mg/day on Days 1 and 2. For inadequate responders, the dose could have been raised in 1.5-mg or 1.5- 
to 3-mg increments to reach the maximum dose of 4.5 mg/day by Day 5 (1.5- to 4.5-mg/day group) or 
12 mg/day by Day 9 (6- to 12-mg/day group), respectively, if there were no tolerability problems. After 
6 weeks of double-blind treatment or premature discontinuation during the double-blind phase (DBP), 
patients were followed up for safety assessments for 4 weeks. During this period, patients received 
treatment at the discretion of the Investigator.

The ITT Population included 377 patients (placebo, n = 126; cariprazine 1.5 to 4.5 mg/day, n = 122; 
cariprazine 6 to 12 mg/day, n = 129). Of the patients in the Safety Population, 53.7% (209/389) 
completed the 6 weeks of double-blind treatment. No statistically significant differences between 
cariprazine- and placebo-treated patients were observed with respect to the overall discontinuation rate 
or individual reason for discontinuation.  The most frequent reasons for discontinuation were insufficient 
therapeutic response (17%), withdrawal of consent (14.4%), and AEs (10.5%).   
The primary efficacy parameter was the CFB to Week 6 in the PANSS total score. The primary analysis was 
performed using an ANCOVA model with missing data imputed by the LOCF approach. A sensitivity 
analysis was performed using an MMRM model. No statistically significant improvement for the primary 
efficacy parameter (CFB to Week 6 in PANSS total score) in the cariprazine treatment groups relative to 
placebo based on the protocol-specified testing procedure was observed (Table 2.2.1-1). Discrepancy 
between OC and MMRM sensitivity analyses concerning primary efficacy parameter was observed. 
The secondary efficacy parameter was the CFB to Week 6 in the CGI-S score. After 6 weeks of treatment, 
comparisons of each cariprazine dose with placebo demonstrated no significant improvement using LOCF 
or MMRM analyses. 
Long-term efficacy  
STUDY RGH-MD-11: EVALUATION OF THE LONG-TERM SAFETY, TOLERABILITY, AND 
PHARMACOKINETICS OF CARIPRAZINE IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA 
This was a multinational, multicentre, 48-week open-label, flexible-dose phase 3 study of cariprazine to 
primarily evaluate the long-term safety of cariprazine in patients with schizophrenia. This was an 
extension study:  In addition to new participants, patients who completed the 6 week lead-in studies, i.e. 
RGH-MD-04 or RGH-MD-05, were recruited. The subjects received 48 weeks of open-label treatment with 
cariprazine dose from 3 - 9 mg single dose per day. 
The efficacy measurements used were the PANSS, CGI-S scale, and PANSS responder rate, SQLS-R4, 
(CDR) System Attention Tests, and Colour Trails Test (CTT). PANSS and CGI-S decreased slightly over 
time also during extension phase supporting efficacy in the maintenance treatment. No decrease in 
efficacy was observed over the course of this long-term, open-label safety study. Approx. 70% of patients 
received cariprazine within the claimed posology (1.5-6mg/day). 
STUDY RGH-MD-17: A LONG-TERM, OPEN-LABEL EXTENSION STUDY OF THE SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY 
OF RGH-188 (CARIPRAZINE) IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA 
This was an international, multicentre, 48 week open-label, and flexible dose, outpatient extension phase 
2 study of cariprazine 1.5-4.5 mg/day in order to primarily evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability and 
PK of cariprazine in patients with schizophrenia. This was an extension study where the enrolled 
population consisted of all patients who completed the lead-in study, RGH-MD-16. 
Efficacy evaluations included PANSS (total, positive, negative and response (≥30% improvement in 
PANSS total)) and CGI-S scales. PANSS and CGI-S decreased slightly over time also during extension 
phase supporting efficacy in the maintenance. Results were well in line with results in study RGH-MD-11 
with similar design. No decrease in efficacy was observed over the course of this long-term, open-label 
safety study.

Design and conduct of clinical studies

To demonstrate clinical efficacy, one exploratory (RGH-MD-03) and three confirmatory short-term 
studies (RGH-MD-04, RGH-MD-05 and RGH-MD-16), one long-term maintenance of effect study 
(RGH-MD-06), and one long-term negative symptom study (RGH-188-005) aiming at demonstrating 
efficacy in patients with predominate negative symptoms were provided. In addition, several supportive 
studies have been presented. Since no formal dose-response study was performed dose response 
relationship was primarily supported by the short term clinical trials, mainly RGH-MD-03 and RGH-MD-16. 
The latter study had fixed dose schedule and to support the dose response relationship by the pivotal 
short term studies is considered acceptable.  
The sites were located in the US, in Europe, Colombia, South Africa, India and Malaysia. Whether the 
results from Eastern Europe and Russia can be extrapolated to Western Europe has been discussed. Only 
3% of the patients in the short-term studies came from the EU and 30% from Europe including countries 
outside EU. Large differences in the change of PANSS between geographical areas in studies RGH-MD-04 
and RGH-MD-16 were observed. The direction of the difference is contradictory between these two 
studies. This is of importance in evaluating efficacy and other possible differences between geographical 
areas and when extrapolating foreign data to the European population where marketing authorisation is 
intended for.  The Applicant has appropriately described and discussed the suitability of extrapolation of 
results from clinical studies conducted outside the EU and in relation to similarities in standard medical 
care within the EU region. 
All the studies included patients only with schizophrenia. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical in 
short-term studies RGH-MD-04 and RGH-MD-05, and very similar with RGH-MD-16, as well as with 
long-term maintenance of efficacy study RGH-MD-06, thus including adult patients with acute 
exacerbation of schizophrenia. The patients in the study RGH-188-005 were those with predominantly 
negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The primary efficacy analysis was based on the ITT population (ITT 
defined as “with one post-baseline assessment”) in all confirmatory studies, which is appropriate. Allowed 
rescue medication was the same, and allowed concomitant medication was similar in these short- and 
long-term studies; however clarifications and discussion were provided on their use. The Applicant has 
discussed the significance of benzodiazepines in symptom control and benzodiazepine use in different 
treatment arms appropriately. The Applicant has also clarified specific antipsychotics or other prohibited 
psychotropic medication use in long-term efficacy studies. 
The active controls included in the short-term efficacy trials, aripiprazole 10 mg/day and risperidone 
4mg/day, are considered acceptable, and the doses are justified. The objective of these studies was not 
to show superiority or non-inferiority, therefore no formal comparison of cariprazine with these active 
controls was made. The used dose of aripiprazole 10 mg/day is the lowest within the recommended dose 
range and the dose of risperidone 4 mg/day is also within the recommended dose range for adults with 
schizophrenia; since these were fixed dose studies neither active control were allowed to be used at the 
maximum labelled dose, i.e. the dose may not have been optimal for all patients.  
In the short term studies the discontinuation rate in all treatment arms are relatively large. Overall the 
discontinuation rates are between 30% and 40% in the placebo and cariprazine arms and slightly lower in 
the active control arms (risperidone and aripiprazole). The distribution among reasons for 
discontinuations is not dramatically different between the treatment arms although there is a higher rate 
of discontinuations due to insufficient therapeutic response in the placebo arms.  
A history of substance abuse was reported frequently throughout the studies. However, urine drug screen 
and blood alcohol level were not checked that often and abuse might have occurred during the study 
unobserved and might have influenced the result. The applicant has discussed the rationale behind the 
schedule and even though a larger number of patients might have used alcohol or illicit drug during the 
study resulting in a larger dropout or inaccurate ratings, it is however unlikely that it would have 
influenced the results.

The main clinical studies did not enrol subjects with an age above 60 years with the exception of the study 
on negative symptoms, which enrolled patients up to 65 years old. The applicant used data from the 
RGH-188-005 study to perform an extrapolation from the efficacy at younger ages to elderly patients and 
concluded that, since there was no decline with age (up to 65 years) in the effect of cariprazine, it is 
expected that this effect is maintained also in the elderly. This is agreed. From an efficacy point of view, 
this is less of a concern but needs to be taken into account with respect to dose recommendations and 
safety and the overall B/R assessment for the elderly population with schizophrenia. The limitations in 
information concerning data from the elderly population has been included in the relevant sections of the 
SmPC. 
In all of those studies, three different analyses treating missing data in different ways have been 
performed for continuous endpoints; MMRM, ANCOVA with LOCF and PMM. All those analyses show a 
consistency in results. MMRM and ANCOVA with LOCF answers the question of what would have happened 
if patients had stayed on randomised treatment. Given the high drop-out rate in the short term studies, 
a more conservative analysis using BOCF has been performed. For responder endpoints an analysis has 
been performed using LOCF for missing data. A conservative analysis on responder endpoints imputing 
non-responders for all missing data was performed and confirmed the results from the continuous 
endpoints. 
In the short-term studies, the choice of primary and secondary efficacy parameters is supported. PANSS 
and CGI-S are frequently used, standardized and valid scales used as efficacy measures. There has been 
debate on minimal clinically significant difference (MCID) and extrapolation between measures and no 
final conclusions have been drawn (Hermes et al 2012, Levine et al 2008). However, PANSS responder 
rate is considered to reflect well the clinical relevance of the PANSS-scale findings. The PANSS responder 
is defined according to the current EMA guideline. A responder is defined as ≥30% improvement in 
PANSS, which is endorsed. In the CGI-S-score 1-point difference has been generally considered a 
clinically meaningful change (Busner et al, 2007). The acute treatment setting makes an evaluation of 
changes in negative symptoms in isolation from changes in other symptoms difficult to perform and the 
short-term duration may be too short in order to evaluate an effect on negative symptoms appropriately. 
Such an evaluation could only be supportive. These studies would not be appropriate for evaluating an 
effect on cognitive deficits either. It would require study duration of at least 6 months. However, to 
document the effect of treatment on cognitive function even if no specific indication is sought, for the 
purpose of characterizing the safety of the drug is endorsed.  
In long-term studies the use of placebo to patients in need of active treatment is ethically problematic. 
However, using a randomised withdrawal study is recommended and the design is acceptable. Patients 
received either placebo (withdrawal) or cariprazine at the same dose (3, 6 or 9 mg/day) that they 
received during the stabilization phase. The dose range used in the study thus included also doses > 
6mg/day, i.e. outside the claimed posology. The Applicant carried out a post-hoc analysis including only 
those doses within the claimed posology, which is acceptable taking into account the totality of data. A 
large number of patients in the active treatment groups is stated to have discontinued the study for 
“Other reasons”. This seems mainly to be due to study closure and hence according to protocol. All 
discontinued patients have been censored in the primary analysis.  
The predefined relapse criteria are well defined and are acceptable. CGI-S and I are rated and they are 
considered as global ratings.  To include PSP as well is endorsed since it addresses a more specific rating 
of functional outcome. The analyses of the pooled short-term studies, the cariprazine 1.5-6.0-mg 
treatment group showed statistically significant improvement in PANSS-FSNS relative to placebo in 
change from baseline at Week 6. However, in order to rate NSA-16 a well predefined study population 
should be chosen. Since other required additional measures of potentially confounding 
Assessment report

symptoms/diagnoses have not been taking into account, the potential improvement in negative 
symptoms should be assessed with caution.  
The study on negative symptoms has been specifically designed in order to evaluate negative symptoms. 
Lack of a placebo group is justified by ethical concerns associated with long-term discontinuation of 
treatment in clinically stable patients. To evaluate changes in primary negative symptoms adequately, 
the changes should be in isolation from changes in other symptoms. To ensure that patients with true 
negative symptoms of schizophrenia are studied, and not those whose symptoms are related to 
depressive symptoms or extra-pyramidal symptoms (EPS), the EMA schizophrenia guideline states 
several inclusion and exclusion criteria that should be followed when designing the study. All these 
aspects have been considered by the applicant. Nevertheless other potentially confounding factors, such 
as anxiety, suicidality, cognitive dysfunction, hospitalization and environmental and other treatment and 
illness related factors could have been present. Some, but not all, above mentioned potentially 
confounding factors have been addressed through adding additional measures (suicidality, 
hospitalization). Cognitive impairment has not been addressed with a specific rating tool but was only 
rated through PANSS and since this factor also should be stable and not predominant during the trial, it 
is valuable to have specific measures of cognition as well. Anxiety was only rated through PANSS and not 
through a separate anxiety scale, e.g. the Hamilton anxiety scale which is a weakness since anxiety as 
well as other affective symptoms, could also confound the result.  
There are different rating instruments to be used in trials of negative symptoms, PANSS subscale, PANSS 
negative factor, and SANS and NSA-16.They differ with respect to their domain coverage, use of 
informants, integration of a global score, administration time and comprehensiveness of their structured 
interviews. In the short-term studies NSA-16 was used. The applicant stated that the same approach was 
not used in the study concerning negative symptoms since scientific advice was sought from three 
European medicinal agencies on this issue. All three agencies stated that PANSS negative factor score 
would be preferable. In addition, in the EMA schizophrenia guideline two scales rating negative symptoms 
are mentioned, none of them is NSA-16. The applicant also states that PANSS is well known both by 
clinicians and companies. Even though a more specific scale rating negative symptoms would have been 
preferable, the applicants’ reasoning is acceptable.  
As secondary efficacy parameter the PSP score was used. This is endorsed since a possible improvement 
in negative symptoms and corresponding improvement in functioning would further strengthen the effect 
on negative symptoms. However, functional impairment can be driven by symptoms but also by other 
factors including many not related to the illness.  Patients with negative symptoms would experience 
reduced range of emotions, social drive and interaction that may result in a life remote from society. It 
may also lead to difficulties in the overall treatment. Participating in a study per se would influence the 
result. However, this would affect any study performed regardless of the outcome and affect all treatment 
groups equally. 
In principle, this study was appropriately designed to demonstrate efficacy in patients with predominantly 
negative symptoms. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The short-term efficacy in acute exacerbation of schizophrenia has been shown as improvement primarily 
in PANSS total score supported by CGI-S scores for the dose range of 1.5-6 mg/day. Even though 
statistically significant difference for cariprazine has been shown over placebo with respect to reduction in 
PANSS total scores in the short term studies, in the responder analyses mainly the higher doses of 6 mg 
or 6-9 mg cariprazine were superior to placebo except in study RGH-MD-16 in which all dose groups 
showed statistically significant responder rates over placebo including the lowest 1.5 mg cariprazine. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/353055/2017  
Page 111/162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, applicant is not proposing to include higher than 6 mg/day doses due to tolerability issues, 
which is agreed by the CHMP. Therefore the results for the doses > 6 mg/day are seen only as supportive.  
Even though statistically significant changes in CGI-S compared to placebo in all these three short-term 
studies with similar design were seen, numerical difference compared to placebo in these studies 
appeared to be quite modest as the mean change was less than 1 point. Also, the difference between 
placebo and cariprazine in CGI-I was 0.8 (range 0.5-0.8) at its maximum. Numerically results in CGI-S 
and CGI-I were not very convincing.  
The more conservative analyses asked for has been performed and were consistent with the primary 
analyses with somewhat lower treatment effects. The results of the additional sensitivity analyses (BOCF, 
pMI) in PANSS score and CGI-S score in the studies RGH-MD-16 and RGH-MD-04 are rather consistent 
with the primary analysis and lead to reasonably similar estimates of the treatment effect. As well, non 
responder imputation and original LOCF imputation for PANSS response rates gave similar odds ratios and 
p-values. Further, CGI-S response rates, using non responder imputation, suggest that cariprazine has 
clinically relevant efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia. In conclusion, considering the totality of the 
data, it is agreed that there is a relevant clinical efficacy for cariprazine, although modest, in the 
treatment of schizophrenia patients.  
For the study RGH-MD-16 a statistically significant decrease in PANSS total score from baseline was seen 
in all the treatments groups compared to placebo. The LSMD for 1.5 mg/day cariprazine was –8.0 (p = 
0.0017); for 3 mg/day, –8.2 (p =0.0013); for 4.5 mg/day –10.5 (p < 0.0001) and for risperidone -16.0 
(p<0.0001) (MMRM analysis). The PANSS responder status (≥30% decrease) was achieved in all 
cariprazine dose groups and risperidone treated patients with 31% (p=0.015), 36% (p=0.002), 36% 
(p=0.001) and 44% (p<0.001) in 1.5, 3, and 4.5 mg/day cariprazine and risperidone, respectively. The 
secondary end-point, CGI-S, also showed statistical significance over placebo in 3 mg and 4.5 mg/day 
dose groups but not for the lowest dose, 1.5 mg/day (MMRM) but the numerical difference appeared to be 
quite modest (0.4 (p=0.0040), -0.5 (p=0.0003), -0.6 (p<0.0001) and -0.8 (p<0.0001) points in 
cariprazine 1.5 mg/day, cariprazine 3 mg/day, cariprazine 4.5 mg/day and risperidone 4 mg/day, 
respectively). When the OC analysis was performed, none of the cariprazine dose groups showed a 
statistical significance over placebo in improvement of PANSS or CGI-S score. This is likely caused by the 
large number of patients discontinuing due to insufficient therapeutic effect in the placebo group. 
However, for the risperidone group the change in PANSS and CGI-S score was significantly higher 
compared to placebo with all sensitivity analysis. Moreover, in the risperidone treatment group a greater 
numeric difference was seen for both the primary and secondary parameters over cariprazine. For each of 
the treatment groups, a significant improvement relative to placebo was seen for all the additional 
efficacy parameters but the risperidone treatment group showed a numerical greater difference than the 
cariprazine treatment group. The short-term duration of the study, the acute treatment setting, and the 
study population, is not considered appropriate to evaluate negative symptoms, thus NSA-16 results 
could only be informative.  
Anti-parkinsonian drugs were more frequently used in the cariprazine 4.5 mg/day group (25%) and the 
risperidone group (29%) compared to cariprazine 1.5 mg/day (19%). Since EPS scale was performed 
before administration, these side effects would have been more common in these groups. Both the 
anti-parkinsonian drugs and EPS could mask an improvement in negative symptoms as well as a positive 
outcome on cognitive impairment. The applicant has discussed the issue and agrees that EPS can mimic 
negative symptoms and that it is theoretically possible that this could influence the result. The study 
design would however address this issue since the efficacy analyses used a change from baseline to end, 
where at baseline there would not yet be any EPS due to pre-enrollment antipsychotic treatment as 
patients had a wash out period from previous antipsychotic medication during screening and at the end 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/353055/2017  
Page 112/162 
 
 
 
 
 
there would not be any treatment emergent EPS as patients were already treated with anti-EPS, the 
analyses would not be affected by EPS or anti-EPS medication. The reasoning is acceptable. 
In the study RGH-MD-04, statistically significant reductions in total PANSS were observed with 
cariprazine 6 mg/day (LSMD –8.8, p<0.0001) and 3 mg/day (LSMD –6.0, p=0.0044) and with the 
active-control aripiprazole 10 mg (LSMD -7.0 , p=0.0008) (MMRM, confirmed with LOCF analysis). On the 
other hand, the responder rates (PANSS≥30%) differed from placebo only for the 6 mg/day cariprazine 
and for the aripiprazole group (for 20% for placebo, 25% for 3 mg/day (p=0.28), 32% for 6 mg/day 
(p=0.027) and 30% for aripiprazole (p=0.0313). The results for the secondary end-point CGI-S were 
statistically significant for all the treatment groups both with MMRM and LOCF analysis although the 
numerical difference was less than 1 point: -0.4 .(p=0.0044), -0.5 (p<0.0001) and -0.4 (p<0.0001) 
points in cariprazine 3 mg/day, cariprazine 6 mg/day and aripiprazole 10 mg/day, respectively. Also the 
PMM sensitivity analysis showed consistency with the primary results. The improvements observed in the 
cariprazine groups and the aripiprazole treated patients were similar. The greatest mean NSA-16 total 
score was found in the placebo group. However, the study is considered too short to be appropriate to 
evaluate negative symptoms. In addition, the study population was not specific to evaluate negative 
symptoms since acute patients with positive symptoms were included and an improvement in that sub 
score is considered being a confounding factor as well as, depression, EPS and other factors. The study 
would not be appropriate to evaluate cognitive symptoms either.  
Both primary and secondary efficacy parameters in the study RGH-MD-05 showed a statistically 
significant improvement from baseline to week 6. The LSMD compared to placebo was –9.9 (p<0.0001) 
for 6 to 9 mg/day group, -6.8 (p=0.0029) for 3 to 6 mg/day group for the PANSS total score (MMRM, 
confirmed with LOCF analysis). The responder rates (PANSS≥30%) did not differ from placebo for any of 
the dose groups (placebo (25%), 3-6 mg (29%, p=0.485), 6-9 mg (35%, p=0.07)). The secondary 
endpoint, change in the CGI-S was statistically significant in both dose groups compared to placebo even 
though the numerical difference was less than 1 point; -0.3 (p=0.0116) and -0.5 (p=0.0003) points in 
cariprazine 3-6 mg/day, cariprazine 6-9 mg/day, respectively. It should be noted that dose > 6 mg 
cariprazine is out of scope. Improvements in PANSS positive and PANSS negative subscale scores, CGI-I 
score, and NSA-16 total score, were also observed. However, as stated above, the study design, with 
regard to duration, setting, and patient population is not considered appropriate to evaluate the effect on 
negative and cognitive symptoms. 
The maintenance of effect has been shown with relapse-prevention in the study RGH-MD-06. Only about 
17% of the patients completed the entire study period. However, since the study was to be terminated 
when the last patient had been followed for 26 weeks, many of the discontinuations were according to 
protocol. In the primary analysis 52 placebo patients and 76 cariprazine patients were censored. Since 
fewer cariprazine patients had an event, more patients were censored due to study end. The applicant 
was requested to present the number of censored by reason for censoring by treatment group. A post hoc 
sensitivity analysis was performed using reference-based controlled imputation. This analysis was 
consistent with the primary analysis. The flexible dose, 3-9 mg cariprazine treatment, led to a decreased 
risk of relapse (25% versus 48%, p=0.001, hazard ratio [95% CI]; 0.45 [0.28, 0.73]). The 25th 
percentile for time to relapse was 92 days in the placebo group and 224 days in the cariprazine group 
(p=0.001). Dose range of 1.5 – 6 mg/day cariprazine is proposed in maintenance treatment. In a post hoc 
analysis without 9 mg cariprazine dose, time to relapse was longer and risk for relapse measured with 
hazard ratio (HR 0.40; 95% CI: 0.20 - 0.82) was significantly smaller in cariprazine than in placebo 
group. However, formally efficacy of cariprazine 1.5 mg/day dose for maintenance has not been studied. 
During the double-blind treatment phase no improvement in PANSS scores were seen. The same pattern 
was also observed for the other additional efficacy parameters. Regarding the negative symptoms rating, 
the design of the study is not appropriate for evaluating an improvement in negative symptoms. Since 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/353055/2017  
Page 113/162 
 
 
 
 
 
other required additional measures of potentially confounding symptoms/diagnoses have not been taken 
into account, the potential improvement in negative symptoms should be assessed with caution.  
Cariprazine’s effects on negative symptoms were evaluated in the study RGH-188-005. The dose range of 
3-6 mg/day cariprazine was reported to show a statistically significant improvement in PANSS negative 
factor score from the baseline in favour of cariprazine over risperidone from week 14 and onwards. The LS 
mean change for the decrease in PANSS negative factor score from baseline to week 26 was -8.9 and -7.4 
for cariprazine and risperidone, respectively. Concerning the comparison of treatment groups the 
pairwise difference was -1.5 (95% CI: -2.4, -0.5, p= 0.002). The responder analysis on this primary 
efficacy variable with 20% cut-off for change reached statistical significance (69.2% in the cariprazine 
group and 58.1% in the risperidone group, difference between groups 11%). No data exists to evaluate 
what is considered a significant difference in negative symptom trials, therefore it is hard to interpret the 
clinical relevance of the study results. In this study, none of the estimated mean differences reached the 
significant difference -2.25 that had been used in the sample size calculation. However, statistically 
significant results were achieved also with a lower difference.  
The secondary efficacy parameter was the change from baseline to week 26 in the PSP score analysed 
with MMRM and the LSMD for cariprazine was 14.3 and for risperidone was 9.7 (p<0.001). According to 
the literature (Nasrallah, 2008), between-group minimally important clinical difference (active treatment 
versus placebo) for the PSP is a 10-point category improvement, if the mean change in the PSP is also 
statistically significant. In this study between treatment groups the difference was always less than 5 
points, however cariprazine was compared to an active comparator.   
In summary both treatments have shown efficacy in improvement of negative symptoms in study 
RGH-188-005. Applicant argued that the observed effect size in study RGH-188-005 is larger than what 
has been claimed to be clinically relevant in other studies of antipsychotic treatments and hence can be 
regarded as clinically relevant also in this trial and continues that the clinical relevance of the statistically 
significant 4.6 point difference on the PSP is best explained by the very strong face validity of this scale 
and by the fact that improved patient functioning is a fundamental demonstration of the clinical 
significance of an effect, since restored patient functioning is a critical component of recovery. 
Improvement in PANSS factor score for negative symptoms and the corresponding improvement in PSP 
score are relevant for the overall conclusion on clinical efficacy supported by the improvements in the 
CGI-S and the CGI-I scores. 
In order to evaluate negative symptoms in isolation from changes in other symptoms possible 
confounding factors should be stable. The change from baseline in PANSS total score, PANSS positive 
subscale and the PANSS general psychopathology score for both the treatment groups were similar and 
not statistically significant. The change in PANSS positive subscale score was small which is important 
since an improvement in positive symptoms might have an effect on negative symptom and hence 
confound the results. Although not statistically significant, the change from baseline in PANSS general 
psychopathology score (that contains 2 items from the primary endpoint measure – i.e. PANSS items G7 
and G16) in the cariprazine and the risperidone treatment groups was -7.14 and -6.42 respectively which 
is considered numerically large enough to have an influence on the overall assessment of negative 
symptoms. The PANSS positive factor score and CDDS were consistent through the study and hence are 
not considered having influenced the rating of negative symptoms. 
A total of 157 cariprazine treated patients (69.2%) achieved decreases of at least 20% in PANSS factor 
score for negative symptoms compared to 133 risperidone treated patients (58.1%) (p=0.002). Although 
there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups and the results suggest an effect on 
negative symptoms, there is no adequate consensus regarding when an improvement in negative 
symptoms is clinically relevant. The relevance of a 20% decrease has been further justified. The applicant 
states that the clinical relevance of the chosen responder definition is based on schizophrenia literature 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/353055/2017  
Page 114/162 
 
 
 
 
 
stating that a 20-25% responder rate is considered clinically relevant in treatment resistant illnesses 
(Leucht, 2005) and that 20% improvement on the PANSS-FSNS would be considered a valid response 
(Edgar, 2014).The responder rates achieving ≥ 20 % improvement were higher in the cariprazine 
treatment group (69.2%) than in the risperidone treatment group (58.1%). The analysis imputing 
non-responders for missing values was also in favor of cariprazine treatment group (61.7% versus 
52.8%).  
Responder analysis using 30% cut-off was performed as requested. The responder rates achieving ≥ 30% 
improvement were again higher in the cariprazine treatment group (49.8%) than in the risperidone 
treatment group (36.2%) (p=0.003). The analysis imputing non-responders for missing values was in 
favour of cariprazine treatment group (45.4 versus 33.6%).To conclude, there would be individuals that 
would improve on cariprazine and there would also be some improving on risperidone concerning both 
positive and negative symptoms.  
Analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint for the ITT population were performed with key baseline 
characteristics as covariates. Some of the key variables were: countries of recruitment, baseline PANSS 
factor score for negative symptom, baseline PANSS items, conceptual disorganization (P2), excitement 
(P4), hostility (P7), anxiety (G2), depression (G6), and baseline PSP and CDSS scores. No 
treatment-by-characteristic interaction term was significant at the 5% level. Although exploratory, the 
covariate analysis was found to be informative for the robustness of the primary endpoint. The Applicant 
was also asked to analyse whether the improvements in other factor scores, cognitive (P2, N5, G11), 
depression/anxiety (G2, G3, G6), and excitement (P4, P7, G8, G14) have influenced the improvement of 
negative factor score. This analysis showed statistical superiority of cariprazine over risperidone.  
The Applicant has provided discussion for the need for a separate indication in the treatment of negative 
symptoms. However, the CHMP concluded that although an effect on negative symptoms has been 
shown, the indication “schizophrenia in adults” already covers both positive and negative symptoms and 
therefore addition of the second line as a separate patient population is not necessary. The effects on 
cariprazine on negative symptoms are described in sufficient detail in SmPC section 5.1.  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the short-term studies, even though robust statistical significance was reached in both primary and 
secondary endpoints, the efficacy is illustrated by numerically modest improvement in primary and 
secondary endpoints, depending on the study and dose. Improvement was higher with active comparator 
risperidone and similar with aripirazole when used with minimal effective dose.   Efficacy in long-term use 
was confirmed in the randomised withdrawal study.  
The effect of cariprazine on negative symptoms was statistically superior to risperidone in the dedicated 
study of patients with predominantly negative symptoms. However, the clinical relevance of the 
difference is difficult to interpret. 
2.7.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The clinical development program of cariprazine included 42 studies; 13 PK / PD studies, 18 Phase 2/3 
clinical studies and 11 additional Japanese studies of which 37 studies are completed (i.e., database lock 
by 5 Oct 2015), and 5 are ongoing.

In the Phase 2/3 schizophrenia studies 2728 patients were treated with cariprazine. Safety data was 
analysed according to modal daily doses grouped into 3 dose subgroups (cariprazine modal daily dose of 
1.5-3 mg/day, 4.5-6 mg/day and 9-12 mg/day). Based on study design, dosage, and patient populations, 
the clinical studies in schizophrenia have been categorized into distinct groups:  
• 
Group 1A (1317 patients), pooled data from 6-week, controlled schizophrenia studies, 
RGH-MD-03, RGH-MD-04, RGH-MD-05, RGH-MD-16 performed with cariprazine dose range 1.5 to 12 
mg/day and active controls risperidone 4 mg/day and aripiprazole 10 mg/day, 
• 
Group 1B (679 patients), pooled data from 48 week open-label safety studies, RGH-MD-11 and 
RGH-MD-17, performed with 1.5 to 9 mg/day cariprazine,  
• 
• 
RGH-MD-06 (765 patients), maintenance of effect study with 3 to 9 mg/day cariprazine,  
RGH-188-005 (230 patients), negative symptom study with 3 to 6 mg/day cariprazine and 
active control risperidone 4 mg/day. 
Cariprazine in the dose range targeted for the treatment of schizophrenia (1.5-6mg/day) has also been 
investigated in other patient populations (such as bipolar mania 3-12 mg, bipolar depression (BD) 0.25-3 
mg and major depressive disorder (MDD) 0.1-4.5 mg). Short-term, mania studies (RGH-MD-31, 
RGH-MD-32, and RGH-MD-33) have been grouped to Group 2A, the long-term mania study 
(RGH-MD-36) has been labelled Group 2B. Data from the two short-term bipolar depression studies 
(RGH-MD-52, RGH-MD-56) have been pooled and so were data from the two completed short-term major 
depressive disorder studies (RGH-MD-71, RGH-MD-75). PK/PD data from healthy volunteer studies 
(RGH-188-001, RGH-188-002, RGH-188-003, RGH-PK-04, RGH-PK-07, RGH-PK-10, RGH-PK-14) were 
grouped to Group 3A. PK/PD data from schizophrenic patients from studies RGH-MD-01, RGH-MD-02, 
RGH-MD-14, RGH-MD-18 and RGH-PK-15 were grouped to Group 3B. 
More than 960 patients with schizophrenia have been exposed to cariprazine for at least 12 weeks, ~600 
patients for at least 24 weeks and ~270 patients for at least 48 weeks. For the claimed posology of 1,5-6 
mg/day, 508 patients were exposed for 6 months and 225 for 12 months. Moreover, 122 cariprazine 
treated patients (from RGH-MD-06) in the claimed posology were exposed for more than 12 months. Size 
of the safety database at 6 and 12 months meets the requirements in the ICH E1 guidance 
(CPMP/ICH/375/95, ICH E1).

Mean age was about 38 years; more patients (69%) were male than female; and about half (49.7%) of 
the patients were Caucasian. Patients of all other races were mostly Black/African American or Asian. 
Most patients were overweight, with a baseline mean BMI ≥ 26 kg/m2. Most patients had schizophrenia 
of the paranoid type (according to DSM IV-TR). The mean duration of schizophrenia was approximately 
12 years, with most patients first diagnosed with schizophrenia in their mid-20s. The percentage of male 
patients included in the studies was higher in Groups 1A, 1B and RGH-MD-06 than in RGH-188-005. 
Adverse events 
In the targeted dose range of 1.5-6 mg/day, the most frequent TEAEs (defined as occurring in more than 
10% of patients) were akathisia (14.6%), insomnia (14.0%), and headache (12.1%). Other common AEs 
were restlessness (6.2 %), weight increased (5.1 %), dizziness (4.5 %), and creatine phosphokinase 
(CPK) increased (2.6 %). In the pooled schizophrenia dataset – within a wide dose-range 1.5–12.0 
mg/day – a dose-dependency was seen for increased CPK and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as well as 
hypertension. For the claimed posology of 1.5-6 mg/day, dose dependency was observed for TEAEs 
blurred vision, CPK elevation, akathisia/restlessness, insomnia and anxiety.

The overall incidence of TEAEs was highest for cariprazine claimed posology (76.6%) followed by placebo 
(68.4%), aripiprazole (65.8%) and risperidone (61.1%). However, pooled data provided includes studies 
of different design. In the clinical studies TEAEs were reported more frequently for cariprazine claimed 
posology than for active comparator(s) in SOCs Blood and lymphatic system disorders; Injury, poisoning 
and procedural complications; Investigations; Metabolism and nutrition disorders; Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders; Nervous system disorders; Psychiatric disorders.  
The AEs observed among cariprazine-treated patients were generally consistent with currently approved 
atypical antipsychotics. The most frequent TEAEs (defined as ≥ 5% of cariprazine-treated patients and at 
least twice the rate for placebo in the placebo-controlled studies, as ≥ 10% of patients in the open-label 
studies and as ≥ 5% in the negative symptoms study) for the respective groups are presented in Table 
5.2-2. 
Extrapyramidal symptoms / akathisia 
Extrapyramidal symptoms, primarily akathisia, were among the most frequent TEAEs in the cariprazine 
development program (akathisia 15%, extrapyramidal disorder 7.3% in the overall cariprazine groups).

Other EPS included restlessness, dystonia cluster, parkinsonism cluster, musculoskeletal stiffness and 
tardive dyskinesia.  
In Group 1B studies, the frequency of patients experienced parkinsonism cluster were higher than that 
observed in Group 1A studies (18% in Group 1B and 5% in Group 1A) as expected due to the longer 
duration of these studies. 
In the maintenance of effect study (RGH-MD-06), the incidence of all EPS-related TEAEs reported during 
the 20 week open-label phase were higher than during the double-blind treatment period (40% in 
open-label phase,  21% in cariprazine 3-9 mg during double-blind phase, 7% in placebo), while akathisia 
was reported in 19% during open-label and 5% during double-blind phase in cariprazine group and in 3% 
of placebo.  There were 2 EPS-related SAEs during the open-label phase while no EPS-related SAEs were 
observed during the double-blind treatment period. 
During the double-blind treatment period of the negative symptoms study (RGH-188-005) the 
percentage of patients with all EPS-related TEAEs were 14.3% in cariprazine and 13% in risperidone 
groups. Akathisia was reported in 8.3% in cariprazine and 5.2% in risperidone group. No EPS-related SAE 
was reported in any group.  
Most cases of akathisia and EPS were reported for the first time within the first 6 weeks of treatment. 
However, in long-term studies in a few cases of later onset of first akathisia were observed up to 36 
weeks.  
Dose dependency was seen for akathisia with overall frequencies in corresponding cariprazine dose 
groups;  1.5 mg: 7.8%, 3 mg: 15.7%, 4.5 mg: 9.1%, 6 mg: 18.0%, but not for the other types for EPS. 
Blood pressure and pulse rate elevations 
Elevations in blood pressure and increases in pulse rate were reported with cariprazine treatment in the 
claimed posology (Table 27). 
Regarding treatment emergent adverse events, more patients experienced hypertension related TEAEs in 
the cariprazine claimed posology group than in the other groups (cariprazine 2.6%; risperidone 1.6%, 
aripiprazole  0.7%,  Table 100.2).  In  the  schizophrenia  studies,  no  dose  dependency  was  seen  for  the 
preferred terms of hypertension (1.5mg: 2.2%, 3mg: 1.6%, 4.5mg: 1.5%, 6mg: 1.9%), blood pressure 
increased  (1.5mg: 0%, 3mg: 1.1%,  4.5mg: 0.2%,  6mg:  1.0%), heart rate increased (1.5mg: 0.6%, 
3mg: 0.6%, 4.5mg: 0.4%, 6mg: 0.8%) or tachycardia (1.5mg: 0.6%, 3mg: 1.6%, 4.5mg: 1.1%, 6mg: 
1.1%). However, for grouped TEAEs, dose dependency was seen for increased and decreased heart rate.  
Most hypertension grouped TEAEs were considered by the Investigators as mild or moderate in intensity. 
Hypertension was mostly controlled with antihypertensive medication (53.7% of the patients with TEAE in 
the  cariprazine  claimed  posology  group,  28.6%  in  the  placebo  group  and  0%  for  comparators,  Table 
100.3). Three patients (0.1%) in the cariprazine claimed posology group discontinued the study due to 
hypertension and none had their study drug down-titrated due to this AE. For most cases no intervention 
was taken.

Blood Creatinine Phosphokinase Elevations and Muscle Injury 
Elevations of creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) were dose-dependent. Overall, TEAEs reported with 
frequency of 2.6% in 1.5-6 mg cariprazine groups and.6% in placebo. Potentially clinically significant 
changes in CPK levels and incidence of CPK related TEAEs in the schizophrenia studies are summarized in

Ocular effects 
Bilateral cataract and cystic degeneration of the retina were observed in the nonclinical program. 
Ophthalmologic monitoring, including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), IOP, slit-lamp, and LOCS III, 
was implemented in the cariprazine long-term studies of Group 1B (RGH-MD-17 and RGH-MD-11), the 
maintenance of efficacy study (RGH-MD-06), the negative symptoms study (RGH-188-005) and the 
long-term mania study (Group 2B, RGH-MD-36). Because the long-term studies in Group 1B included 
roll-over patients from the short-term schizophrenia studies, ophthalmologic monitoring was 
implemented at baseline and at endpoint (Week 6) in studies RGH-MD-04 and RGH-MD-05. 
Ocular adverse events 
The  most  commonly  reported  ocular  AE  was  blurred  vision,  for  which  there  was  an  apparent 
dose-response  relationship  with  cariprazine.  Two  patients  had  an  AE  of  cataract.  Six  patients  (0.3%) 
discontinued treatment due to ocular AEs: 2 cases of cataract, and eye disorder, eye swelling, ocular 
hyperemia, optic neuropathy, and visual acuity reduced.  
Overall,  there  have  been  6  cataract  cases  reported  in  the  schizophrenia  program,  1  in  the  mania 
development program and 17 in Japanese schizophrenia studies. These numbers include cataract cases 
observed outside the claimed posology. In the schizophrenia claimed posology group there were 3 cases 
of cataracts reported. For some of the cases the Applicant was able to gather further information to better 
understand  the  nature  and  relevance  of  these  reported  cases  and  reanalyzed  them  with  the  new 
information, where applicable. All of the 14 related cataracts were claimed to have clinical confounding 
factors as outlined in the Figure below.

Six cases were reported in the schizophrenia development program, out of which one was a baseline case 
(#3). Out of the remaining 5 cases, case#2 occurred after 28 days of cariprazine treatment. Case#5 
occurred  in  a  patient  who  had  been  diagnosed  with  diabetes  mellitus,  and  previously  had  taken 
chrorpromazine which is proven to be cataractogenic. Case#6 had corresponding risk due to the age of 
the patient. The other two cases (#1 and #4) of cataract resolved after discontinuation. Although it is 
questionable  for  a  cataract  to  resolve  over  time  due  to  its  pathophysiology,  drug  induced  adverse 
reactions, in general, tend to disappear after discontinuation. From these two resolved cataract cases, 
case#4  occurred  in  a  58 years-old  patient  who  concomitantly  took  statin  (atorvastatin)  which  is  also 
proven to have cataractogenic potential. The cases are summarized in the Table below.

Lenticular changes 
In Group 1B studies, the pattern of positive lenticular shifts displayed a pattern potentially compatible 
with a dose-response relation. The highest incidence is seen in the dose-range above the proposed 
therapeutic range. 
In the maintenance of effect study (RGH-MD-06), blurred vision was the most commonly reported ocular 
AE, reported in 1.4% of patients during the open label phase. Other AEs reported during the study were 
subcapsular cataract, reported for 3 patients, cataract, diplopia, eye disorder (abnormal cortical nuclear 
OS), eyelid ptosis, maculopathy, and night blindness, reported for one patient each. Nearly all ocular AEs 
were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity,  except  for  1  report  (0.1%)  each  of  severe  diplopia  and  severe

oculogyric crisis.  Three patients discontinued treatment during the OL phase due to ocular AEs: 1 patient 
each with diplopia, oculogyric crisis, and eye swelling and ocular hyperemia (secondary to assault). Three 
patients discontinued treatment during the double-blind treatment period due to ocular AEs: 1 patient 
each with cataract, subcapsular cataract, and eye disorder and subcapsular cataract.  
In study RGH-MD-06, concerning the LOCSIII data, in the run-in phase and double-blind phase Class III 
positive lenticular shifts were observed for 6 of 212 patients (2.8%) at the end of the open label phase, 
and 3 of 48 patients (6.3%) in the cariprazine 3-6 mg modal daily dose group and 2 of 89 patients (2.2%) 
in the placebo group (Table 44.3). This imbalance is notably very sensitive to random error since only one 
less  cariprazine  exposed  case  and  two  more  placebo  exposed  cases  would  completely  equalise  the 
balance between cataract cases. 
In negative symptoms study (RGH-188-005), 3 patients in the cariprazine group and 4 patients in the 
risperidone group ocular AEs were reported. No differences between the treatment groups in frequency, 
severity, or relationship of AEs to study drug were clinically meaningful. None of the eye disorder AEs was 
an SAE. Four patients who had positive or negative shifts in LOCS III grading experienced ocular AEs; 1 
patient was in the cariprazine group and 3 patients were in the risperidone group (Table 2.1.5.12.6-5.).

In short-term controlled mania studies (Group 2A), blurred vision was reported more frequently in the 
cariprazine group (3.7%) than in the placebo group (1.1%). All other ocular AEs were reported for < 1% 
of patients in any group without a dose-response relationship. AEs related to reductions in visual acuity, 
colour vision, cataract, or lens opacities were not observed.   
In the long-term mania study (Group 2B), the most commonly reported ocular AEs were blurred vision 
and dry eye. All other ocular AEs were reported for < 1% of patients overall. No patient had AEs related 
to visual acuity or colour vision. 1 patient had an AE of cataract. The findings of LOCSII data were in line 
with the long-term schizophrenia data: both positive and negative shifts were observed, five of these 
shifts were of Class III (Table 2.1.5.12.6-3). 
In bipolar depression studies, the frequency of ocular TEAEs was 1.8% in the placebo group and 2.4% in 
the overall cariprazine group with the most common ocular TEAE blurred vision, which was reported in 
0.4% of patients in the placebo group, and 0.9% of patients in the cariprazine group. All ocular TEAEs 
were reported for < 1% of patients in any treatment group. No SAEs or discontinuation due to an ocular 
AE was reported.

In major depressive disorder studies, ocular TEAEs were reported more frequently in the overall 
cariprazine group (3.7%) than in the placebo group (1.4%). The most commonly reported ocular TEAE 
was blurred vision (0.9% in placebo group, 2.3% in the cariprazine group). All other ocular TEAEs were 
reported for < 1% of patients. No serious or severe ocular AEs were reported. Two patients discontinued 
treatment due to ocular AEs, 1 patient on placebo with mild age-related macular degeneration (ongoing 
at time of discontinuation), and 1 patient discontinued because of AEs of fatigue, insomnia, and moderate 
blurred vision. 
Pooled data for LOCSIII results from studies including Group 1B (RGH-MD-17 and RGH-MD-11), the 
maintenance of efficacy study (RGH-MD-06), the negative symptoms study (RGH-188-005) and the 
long-term mania study (Group 2B, RGH-MD-36) and RGH-MD-04 and RGH-MD-05 are summarized in the 
Table below.  
There  were  more  negative  lenticular  shifts  (improvement)  observed  for  cariprazine  and  risperidone; 
whereas more positive shifts (worsening) were observed for placebo and aripiprazole. Highest rates in 
positive shifts were observed for placebo: Class I shifts (5.8%), Class II (1.8%) and Class III (4%). For 
cariprazine,  positive  Class  I  shifts  were  observed  in  5.6%,  Class  II  in  2.9%  and  Class  III  in  1.6%  of 
patients.  Overall,  the  net  effect  of  shifts  for  cariprazine  was  negative  shifts,  while  the  occurrence  of 
positive shifts was comparable with placebo.  
Best-Corrected Visual Acuity  
Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) testing was implemented in Studies RGH-MD-04 and RGH-MD-05, 
the  cariprazine  long-term  studies  of  Group  1B  (RGH-MD-17  and  RGH-MD-11),  the  maintenance  of 
efficacy  study  (RGH-MD-06),  the  negative  symptoms  study  (RGH-188-005)  and  the  long-term  mania 
study (Group 2B, RGH-MD-36). Table below presents BCVA data for the schizophrenia program by dose. 
Based on the data below, no divergent effect was detected on BCVA with cariprazine compared to placebo 
or active comparators.

Retinal toxicity 
In the overall cariprazine development program, retinal toxicity related TEAEs (retinal degeneration, 
retinal pigment epithelium detachment, retinal detachment) were reported for 2 patients treated with 
cariprazine, 1 patient treated with risperidone and 1 patient treated with placebo and all had confounding 
risk factors. 
Phospholipidosis 
Phospholipidosis was observed in the non-clinical studies in lungs of rats, dogs, and mice (with or without 
inflammation) and in the adrenal gland cortex of dogs at clinically relevant exposures (AUC) of total 
cariprazine (see Non-clinical section of this report). The analysis of the clinical database with regard to 
respiratory/pulmonary symptoms did not yield a pulmonary safety signal associated with exposure to 
cariprazine. Based on the toxicological findings, and assuming that they would translate into similar 
findings in humans, one would expect possible manifestations of inflammatory processes, which may 
possibly detected by the clinical symptoms of cough, dyspnoea, fatigue, and elevation in basophils, 
monocytes, or leucocytes. The analysis of the clinical database with regard to AEs of the high-level group

term “adrenal gland disorders” and cortisol abnormalities, adrenal insufficiency, adrenal suppression, 
weakness, fatigue, malaise, depression, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, hyperpigmentation, 
hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, electrolyte abnormality, and eosinophilia, did not reveal a 
pattern indicative of adrenal dysfunction. Specific assessments of adrenocorticotrophic hormones were 
not performed in the cariprazine clinical program. The events identified in the database search were 
nonspecific events, such as nausea, vomiting, and fatigue, which are commonly seen with antipsychotic 
therapy. Few patients had concurrent events. There was no correlation of the identified events with other 
clinical findings. There were no events of cortisol abnormalities, adrenal insufficiency, or adrenal 
suppression. One patient had an AE from the adrenal gland disorder term adrenal adenoma which was not 
judged to be related to the treatment.  
Body weight changes 
Changes in body weight have been observed with cariprazine treatment. Mean change from baseline in 
body weight in the short term studies was 0.9 kg, while in the long term studies it was -0.3 kg in 
RGH-188-005 (26 weeks, RGH-188-005), 1.8 kg in Group 1B studies (48 weeks) and 0.6 kg in 
RGH-MD-06 (up to 92 weeks). Overall, taking all studies into account, a slight weight increase of 0.9 kg 
with cariprazine was observed. 
Based on the measurements, potentially clinically significant (PCS) changes in body weight (≥ 7% 
increase or ≥ 7% decrease) have been observed. For the cariprazine treated patients, 7% in short-term 
studies and up to 28% in long-term open-label safety studies weight gain was observed within the 
claimed posology, while for risperidone treated patients this was 16% in short-term studies. In the 
open-label phase of study RGH-MD-06 during 20 weeks cariprazine treatment 9.0% of patients developed 
potentially clinically significant (PCS) weight gain (defined as increase ≥ 7%) while during the 
double-blind phase, 9.8 % of the patients who continued with cariprazine treatment had PCS weight gain 
versus 7.1% of the patients who were randomized to placebo after the 20 week open-label cariprazine 
treatment. In the negative symptom study RGH-188-005, the PCS weight gain was observed in 6% of the 
cariprazine group while 7.4% of the risperidone group.  
Although, the frequency of reported weight related TEAEs were relatively lower compared to the 
frequency of PCS weight gain in all studies and all treatment groups up to the frequency of 11.5% weight 
increased was reported in the long-term studies related to cariprazine in Group 1B open-label safety 
studies. Interestingly, no weight increased TEAEs were reported during the double-blind period of the 
maintenance of effect study, RGH-MD-06. Lower frequencies of weight increased TAEs were reported for 
both risperidone and cariprazine in the negative symptom study, RGH-MD-188-005.  
Metabolic parameters 
In Group 1A studies, there were no deaths or SAEs associated with metabolic changes, while one patient 
discontinued the study due to AEs blood glucose increased and blood triglycerides increased.The 
incidence of patients with TEAEs associated with hyperlipidaemia was approximately 1% across all 
treatment groups. The incidence of patients with TEAEs associated with hyperglycemia and diabetes 
mellitus was < 1% with cariprazine and 1% with placebo.  
The incidence of treatment-emergent significant changes in metabolic parameters tended to increase 
over time in Group 1B open-label long term studies. Approximately 5% of Group 1B patients had 
treatment-emergent glycosuria and approximately 7% had treatment-emergent significant shifts in 
glycosylated haemoglobin. There was no death associated with metabolic changes. However, one patient 
(with history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus) had a SAE of diabetes mellitus inadequate control that was

considered to be related. No patient in Group 1B discontinued the study due to metabolic changes. 
Hyperlipidaemia was detected in in 3% of patients while 1% had hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus 
TEAEs. One patient had TEAEs of type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome judged as possibly 
related to cariprazine and another patient had an SAE of diabetes mellitus inadequate control as described 
above related to cariprazine. 
In the RGH-MD-06, maintenance of effect study, the highest frequency of TEAE related to metabolic 
changes were blood triglycerides increased with 4% in cariprazine group during the double blind period, 
followed by 3% for diabetes mellitus both in open label and double blind phase in the cariprazine group. 
There were no deaths, nor SAEs and no discontinuations associated with metabolic changes 
(hyperlipidaemia, hyperglycemia or diabetes mellitus) in Study RGH-MD-06 and RGH-188-005. 
Suicidality 
Suicidality was assessed by the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Throughout the 
cariprazine development program, 6 death cases occurred due to completed suicide, but none were 
judged to be related to cariprazine. In the schizophrenia studies, 17 SAEs of the suicidality category were 
reported. In the PK/PD studies there were no TEAEs of suicidal ideation. In the mania studies Group 2A, 
4 placebo-treated (0.9%), 2 cariprazine-treated patients (0.3%), in Group 2B 8 cariprazine-treated 
patients (2%) had suicidality TEAEs. In the bipolar depression studies, 8 patients (1.4%) in the overall 
cariprazine group and 3 patients (1.4%) in the placebo group had TEAEs of suicidal ideation. In the major 
depressive disorder studies there were no completed suicides; but 1 patient (0.1%) in the overall 
cariprazine group had a TEAE of suicidal ideation. 
Seizures / convulsion 
In Group 1A studies, 3 patients in the placebo group (0.5%) and one patient in cariprazine dose group 
4.5-6 mg dose group (0.1%) and one aripiprazole (0.7%) groups had TEAEs of seizure or convulsion. The 
case in the cariprazine group was judged as possibly related.  
In Group 1B studies, 1 patient (0.1%) had a TEAE of the seizure/convulsion category and was judged as 
not related to cariprazine treatment.  In the maintenance of effect study (RGH-MD-06) 1 patient had a 
SAE of the seizure / convulsion in the screening period before receiving any investigational product, one 
patient had a TEAE of convulsion in the open label-treatment phase which was judged to be related with 
confounding factors, one patient in the safety follow phase after premature discontinuation from the 
open-label phase and one patient in the double blind phase. In the negative symptoms study 
(RGH-188-005) there was no reported TEAE of seizure / convulsion.  
In the PK/PD studies there was no reported TEAE of seizure/convulsion. In the bipolar mania program 2 
cariprazine-treated patients (0.3%) had TEAEs of convulsion during the double-blind treatment period of 
the controlled mania studies. Both events were serious, led to premature study discontinuation, and were 
judged by the Investigator to be related to treatment with cariprazine. In Group 2B, no TEAE of seizure or 
convulsion was reported during the open-label treatment period. There was 1 report of seizure during the 
safety follow-up period, which the Investigator assessed as no serious, moderate in intensity, and 
unrelated to cariprazine. In the bipolar depression and major depressive disorder studies there were no 
TEAEs of seizure/convulsion.

No TEAE of Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, Serotonin syndrome and Hyperthermia malignant was 
reported in Group 1A, 1B or RGH-188-005 studies. In Study RGH-MD-06, there was one TEAE of 
neuroleptic malignant syndrome in the open-label phase. There was no TEAE of neuroleptic malignant 
syndrome in the PK/PD studies, in the bipolar mania, bipolar depression or major depressive disorder 
studies.  
Deep Vein Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism Events 
No patient had TEAE of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in the schizophrenia studies. One 
cariprazine treated patient in Group 1B had thrombophlebitis. One patient in RGH-06 study experienced 
thrombocytosis. In the mania studies, two cariprazine-treated patients had adverse events:  a pulmonary 
embolism resulting in death and a SAE of deep vein thrombosis that was detected during the 
safety-follow-up period.  
Cognitive Impairment and Delirium 
In  the  cariprazine  schizophrenia  program,  there  were  11  (0.5%)  TEAEs  associated  with  cognition,  8 
(0.4%) of which were considered by the Investigators as related to treatment. Cognition related TEAEs 
were  reported in  1.0%  of  patients in  the  claimed posology.    In  the  short  term  controlled  studies  the 
incidence of cognition related TEAEs was 0.4% in the cariprazine group, 0.2% in the placebo group and 
higher  in  the  comparators  groups:  risperidone  0.7%  and  aripiprazole  0.7%.  In  the  long  term  study 
RGH-MD-06  the  incidence  of  cognition  related  TEAE  in  the  placebo  group  was  1.0%  while  in  the 
cariprazine group it was 0%. In study RGH-188-005 the incidence of cognition related TEAEs was 0.9% 
for cariprazine and 0.4% for risperidone. Overall frequencies of cariprazine’s cognition –related TEAEs 
were similar to placebo and uncommon.

Cerebrovascular disease 
One SAE of ischemic stroke was reported after study discontinuation leading to death in schizophrenia 
studies. In PK/PD and studies in other indications 2 aphasia cases, 7 cases with dysarthria and 1 brain 
injury case were reported. Most cases were judged by the Investigator as mild or moderate in intensity 
(except for one case of dysarthria which was judged as severe) and related to treatment. No TEAE of this 
category was judged as SAE. 
Sedation 
The incidence of sedation related TEAEs in the short term schizophrenia trials (Group 1A) was 7.5% in the 
cariprazine group and 5.8% in the placebo group. The incidence of sedation related TEAEs was 7.1% in 
Group 1B, and 5.2% in the open label phase of study RGH-MD-06. During the double-blind phase the 
incidence of sedation related TEAEs was 3% for cariprazine and 0 for placebo. When cariprazine was 
compared to risperidone over a time of 26 weeks, the incidence of sedation grouped AEs was 5.2% for 
cariprazine and 6.0% for risperidone. 
In the PK/PD studies performed in healthy volunteers the incidence of sedation grouped TEAEs was 
17.4% for placebo and 9.4% for cariprazine, in schizophrenic patients the incidence was 25.3% for 
placebo and 36.6% for cariprazine. In the mania studies the incidence was 4.0% for placebo and 8.0% for 
cariprazine and 8.7% for open-label cariprazine in the long-term mania study. In the BD studies the 
incidence was 6.3% for placebo and 6.0% for cariprazine. In the MDD studies the incidence was 4.8% for 
placebo and 9.4% for cariprazine. Overall, the incidence of sedation related TEAEs in controlled studies 
was 11.4% for cariprazine and 9.1% for placebo. 
Sexual dysfunction 
In  the  cariprazine  schizophrenia  program,  there  were  21  (1.0%)  TEAEs  associated  with  sexual 
dysfunction.

Autonomic nervous system disorders 
14% of cariprazine treated patients in Group 1A, 13% of patients in Group 1B, 14% of cariprazine treated 
patients in study RGH-MD-06 in the open-label and 10 % in the double blind group had TEAEs related to 
autonomic nervous system disorders, In study RGH-188-005 approximately 4% of patients in both 
treatment groups had TEAEs related to autonomic nervous system disorders. Dizziness, syncope and 
blurred vision were the most frequent autonomic nervous system disorder related TEAEs in Group 3A. In 
Group 3B orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic tachycardia were also among the more common TEAEs 
associated with autonomic nervous system disorders. Approximately 20% of manic patients, 11% of 
bipolar depression patients and 12% of major depressive disorder patients had TEAEs associated with 
autonomic nervous system disorders.  
Prolactin 
No TEAEs related to elevation of prolactin levels was reported in cariprazine-treated patients in the clinical 
studies. Mean decreases in prolactin levels from baseline were seen in all treatment groups, with the 
exception of the risperidone group. No AEs of hyperprolactinemia were reported.  
Renal Safety  
Overall, there were no deaths, no SAEs and no discontinuations related to renal functioning. In group 1A 
studies, one TEAE of proteinuria and one hemorrhage in the urinary tract were reported in the 9-12 
mg/day cariprazine group. In Group1B, one renal failure was reported in association with the

rhabdomyolysis case, one patient with blood urea increased, one patient with blood uric acid increased, 
one patient with haematuria and one patient with urinary retention in association to rhabdomyolysis. In 
RGH-MD-06, one cariprazine treated patient had TEAE of blood uric acid increased. In RGH-188-005 one 
cariprazine treated patient had a TEAE of haematuria and renal colic.  
ECG and QT Interval 
The effect of 9 mg/day and 18 mg/day cariprazine on cardiac repolarization was investigated in a 
multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo, and moxifloxacin-controlled, parallel-group study in 
patients with schizophrenia. There was no evidence that cariprazine results in statistically or clinically 
significant QTc prolongation following 9 mg/day, the highest tested dose in confirmatory trials to show 
efficacy, and a supra therapeutic dose (18 mg/day). No patients treated with cariprazine experienced QTc 
increases > 60 msec from baseline, nor did any patient experience a QTc of > 500 msec in the study 
(RGH-MD-02). In a population PK-PD analysis, data from 11 studies were used to quantitatively evaluate 
the potential for QTcF prolongation by cariprazine plasma exposures. No clinically meaningful relationship 
between total cariprazine plasma concentrations and QTcF prolongation over the dose range of 0.5 to 21 
mg/day was found (RGH-MS-02).  
Small mean increases from baseline in ventricular heart rate were observed with cariprazine therapy, 
relative to placebo, consistent with the mean changes observed in pulse rate. Post baseline QTcF values 
> 500 msec was seen in only 1 patient, in the long-term schizophrenia studies. The percentages of 
patients with an increase from baseline of > 60 msec in QTcF values were low in the cariprazine groups 
and similar to those in the placebo groups (≤ 0.5%). No AEs of torsade de pointes, ventricular fibrillation, 
or ventricular tachycardia were reported. 
During the long-term, open-label treatment period in Group 1B, 3 patients (0.4%) had QTcB > 500 msec, 
one of whom also had QTcF > 500 msec. A > 60 msec increase from baseline was observed in 7 patients 
(1%) for QTcB and in 2 patients (0.3%) for QTcF. No dose-response pattern was observed when the data 
were examined by modal daily dose. 
The most common TEAEs associated with ECG findings were sinus tachycardia (6 patients, 0.9%), 
electrocardiogram QT prolonged (5 patients, 0.7%), and sinus bradycardia (4 patients, 0.6%). Two 
patients (0.3%) each had TEAEs of bundle branch block left, electrocardiogram T wave inversion; and 1 
patient (0.1%) each had a TEAE of supraventricular extrasystoles, atrioventricular block I, 
electrocardiogram T wave abnormal, electrocardiogram ST-segment depression, electrocardiogram T 
wave amplitude decreased, and sick sinus syndrome. 
In RGH-MD-06, maintenance of effect study, no patient had post baseline QTcB or QTcF > 500 msec. 
During the open-label phase, > 60 msec increase of from baseline was observed in 12 patients (1.6%) for 
QTcB and in 4 patients (0.5%) for QTcF. During the double-blind treatment period, > 60 msec increases 
from baseline in QTcB were observed in 3 cariprazine-treated patients (3.1%) and 2 placebo-treated 
patients (2%). For the six cariprazine treated patients with an increase from baseline QTcF of > 60 msec 
in both treatment periods, the increase was only a single occurrence; changes from baseline in QTcF at all 
other assessments were always < 60 msec. No dose-response relationship was observed among the 
cariprazine modal daily dose groups. 
There were no ECG related SAEs. SAEs of atrial fibrillation, sinus tachycardia, tachycardia paroxysmal 
were reported for placebo treated patients. One cariprazine treated patient in the open-label phase and 
one placebo treated patient discontinued the study due to ECG related TEAEs.

In RGH-188-005, no patient had post-baseline QTcB or QTcF > 500 msec and no patients had increases 
of 30 or 60 msec from baseline in QTcB or QTcF parameters. The numbers of TEAEs related to ECG 
abnormalities were small in both treatment groups. None of these TEAEs were SAEs or discontinuations. 
Reproductive toxicity 
The  clinical  trials  included  only  female  patients  of  non-childbearing  potential  or  non-pregnant,  not 
breast-feeding women of childbearing potential, using reliable contraception. The study was prematurely 
discontinued if a patient got pregnant. Despite that, during the cariprazine development program a total 
of  22  pregnancies  were  reported;  13  of  these  occurred  in  cariprazine-treated  patients.  Based  on  the 
narratives of these pregnancies; 7 delivered a healthy baby, one delivered pre-term tiplets, one delivered 
baby experienced pneumonia with sepsis, , 4 had unknown outcome, 4 underwent induced abortion, 2 
elective abortion and 2 ended with spontaneous abortion one of which was due to intrauterine fetal death.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs were reported for 6.6% of cariprazine treated patients in the claimed posology and 8.2% of placebo 
treated  patients.  No  clear  dose  dependency  was  observed  for  any  of  the  SAEs.  Schizophrenia  and 
psychotic disorder were the most commonly reported SAEs, with a higher incidence in the placebo group 
(5.1%) than in the cariprazine group (3.1%), indicating relapse of schizophrenic symptoms. All other 
SAEs were reported in less than 1% of patients.

Overall, 17 deaths were reported in the cariprazine development program. Of these,  only 11 patients 
received at least 1 dose of cariprazine, 3 occurred in the Phase II/III schizophrenia program and only one 
death case was considered by the Investigator to be related to cariprazine. This case was a 36-year-old 
male with history of schizophrenia, low body weight (BMI 16.2) and concomitant common cold who 
received cariprazine for 4 days. Cariprazine was up-titrated according to protocol, with the patient 
receiving 1.5mg on day 1 (experiencing transient nausea), 3mg on day 2, 4.5mg on day 3 (experiencing 
transient diarrhoea) and 6 mg on day 4. On day 4, hours after study drug intake, the patient was 
discovered in a cardiopulmonary arrest state, and died on the same day. Due to the temporal relationship 
between drug intake and occurrence of death the Investigator considered the case to be related to study 
drug. However, the study data safety monitoring board pointed out various confounding factors (rapid 
weight gain in a patient with screening low BMI, concomitant common cold and diarrhoea one day before 
the event). Other possible confounding factors include zopiclone, hypokalaemia effects of tsumura 
kakkonto herbal extract and prior ECG findings of abnormal Q wave, ST elevation, and atrial fibrillation in 
this patient. No obvious causality between the study drug and the deaths can be claimed. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
The overall incidence of discontinuation due to AEs was 12.1 % in the cariprazine groups within claimed 
posology compared to 12.4 % of placebo treated patients.  Schizophrenia and psychotic disorder were the 
most common TEAEs leading to study discontinuation, with a higher incidence in the placebo group 
compared to the cariprazine group. All other discontinuations were reported in less than 1 % of patients. 
Discontinuations due to adverse events of special interest were reported in less than 0.1 % within the 
claimed cariprazine posology group. Of these akathisia (0.9%), suicidal ideation (0.3%), EPS (0.2%) and 
female orgasmic disorder (0.2%) had highest incidences, while one case each of cataract and subcapsular 
cataract were reported as AE leading to discontinuation. 
Overdose 
The maximum tolerated dose of cariprazine in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder was 
18 mg/day. Few instances of overdose, in the clinical databases of the schizophrenia studies and none of 
the patients who received cariprazine greater than 18 mg/day experienced an adverse outcome. One 
accidental overdose of cariprazine with 48 mg experienced orthostatic dizziness and sedation, however 
fully recovered the same day.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Cariprazine is metabolized to its active metabolites DCAR and DDCAR with both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 
enzymes involved. Thus, inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 might influence the formation of the active 
metabolites, and elimination of the mother substance. However, there are uncertainties concerning how 
DCAR and DDCAR are eliminated. Therefore, based on current information available, the safety of drug 
interactions is not completely clear. Moreover, there are questions concerning the potential impact of 
CYP2D6 metabolizer status on safety of cariprazine. There are additional uncertainties concerning how 
cariprazine would influence other drugs as a Pgp inhibitor.  
Currently, based on the available knowledge no firm conclusions can be drawn concerning the safety of 
drug-drug interactions with cariprazine.

Post marketing experience 
Cariprazine was approved by the FDA on 17 Sep 2015 for treatment of schizophrenia and acute treatment 
of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder using the trade name Vraylar. The product 
was marketed in the US from March 5th 2016. According to the post-approval data from the US, the 
cumulative patient exposure of cariprazine from product launch (March 5th, 2016) to February 24th, 2017 
is estimated to be 11668 patient-years. It is noted that patient-years may underestimate actual patient 
numbers since compliance and persistency are not factored into calculations. 
Overall, 100 ICSRs with 215 Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) were received concerning cariprazine during 
the reference period. Sixty-three cases were medically confirmed and 37 cases were medically 
unconfirmed. Twenty ADRs out of 215 were serious.  
There were no reported cases of cataract/retinal degeneration/ retinal atrophy, phospholipidosis/fibrosis, 
neuroleptic malignant syndrome, cerebrovascular disease, sexual dysfunction, prolactin increased, liver 
enzyme increased, or sudden death/QT prolonged. No new relevant safety issue was identified from the 
available post-marketing reports.  
2.7.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events included akathisia (14.8%) / extrapyramidal 
disorder (7.3%), headache (12.5%) and insomnia (13.9%). The most frequent SAEs and AEs leading to 
premature discontinuation were worsening of schizophrenia, psychotic symptoms followed by akathisia. 
Several AEs including akathisia / restlessness, CPK elevation, insomnia, anxiety and blurred vision were 
dose-dependent. 
Extrapyramidal symptoms, dominated by akathisia were among the most frequent TAEs in the cariprazine 
development program. Comparing the modal doses in short-term studies, akathisia was observed with 
9% incidence in 1.5-3 mg and with 13% in the 4.5-6 mg cariprazine groups while 9% in risperidone 4mg 
and 7% in aripiprazole 10 mg. When akathisia/restlessness grouped the incidences are 12% in 1.5-3 mg, 
18% in 4.5-6 mg cariprazine, 10 % in risperidone 4mg and 11% in aripiprazole groups. Thus, the 
incidence of akathisia was higher with cariprazine doses above 3 mg relative to the active comparators.  
The high incidence of akathisia in clinical practise could result in compromised treatment adherence as it 
generally occurs during the first weeks after initiation. Moreover, although not observed in the cariprazine 
development program, akathisia has been reported in the literature to be associated with tendency for 
suicidality. However, none of the patients who died due to completed suicide during the cariprazine 
clinical development program had high akathisia scores. The safe use of the product in the context of 
early detection and mitigation of treatment emergent akathisia /restlessness, and prevention of suicide 
should be assured by individualized dosing regimen with close monitoring during the initiation of the 
treatment and lowest effective maintenance doses.  
Based on pre-clinical finding of ocular toxicity, ophthalmological tests were performed in long-term 
schizophrenia studies. Positive lenticular shifts from Grade I to III have been observed in LOC III 
examinations in long-term studies and 24 cataract cases were reported in the overall cariprazine program 
of which 6 were within the schizophrenia program and had relatively young mean age.  Moreover, up to 
Assessment report

7% of the cariprazine treated patients had reduced visual acuity (BCVA changes ≥ 0.3). The duration of 
long–term safety studies were limited to maximum 48 weeks which might not correspond to a sufficient 
duration in order to detect cataractogenic changes. The studies where ocular examinations were 
performed had different length and design. The exposure of to cariprazine differed in these studies and a 
tolerability based bias for study continuation should be taken into account for the long-term open-label 
studies (Group 1B).  The preclinical findings in dogs were attributed by the Applicant to decreased 
cholesterol levels; however, this is not a relevant mechanism for humans as decrease in cholesterol was 
not observed in patients.  Several of the cataract cases had relevant confounding risk factors for the 
cataract including concomitant drugs, prior treatments with known cataract risk or comorbidities such as 
diabetes. Although the causality between cataract cases and cariprazine treatment is not completely 
clear, the lenticular changes observed in the cariprazine program need to be further evaluated. 
Consequently, the Applicant committed to conducting a Post Authorisation Safety Study to characterise 
the ocular safety.  
Elevations in blood pressure were reported in cariprazine treated patients. The frequency of hypertension 
related TEAEs were 2.6% in the claimed cariprazine posology, 1% for the placebo. Hypertension was 
mainly considered as mild to moderate; 4 patients had severe hypertension and 3 patients discontinued 
due to these AEs.  Shifts from normotensive to stage I or II hypertension were reported in all dose groups 
up to 3.3 % in short-term Group 1A studies, and up to 14.8% in long-term studies for the claimed 
cariprazine posology of 1.5-6 mg/day; 6.6 % in Group 1A to 8% in long-term studies for placebo, 0 in 
short-term studies and 3.8% in long-term studies for risperidone; 3.5% in short-term studies for 
aripiprazole.  The potential impact of blood pressure elevations and metabolic effects were discussed in 
terms of long-term cardiovascular safety of patients. Hypertension is listed as a common adverse event 
in the product information with a warning text for caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease 
predisposing to blood pressure changes and need for monitoring.  
Increased CPK TEAEs were reported with frequency of 2.6% in the cariprazine and 1.6% in placebo 
groups. Although reported TEAEs and SAEs were not as frequent in relation to the higher rate of 
potentially clinically significant increases in CPK, a potential risk for rhabdomyolysis is suspected due to 
the class effect. Therefore, rhabdomyolysis is classified as an important potential risk for cariprazine.   
Increased liver aminotransferases (ALT/AST) were reported for cariprazine with a frequency of 2.2% in 
the claimed posology for the grouped TEAEs and 0.4 % in the placebo. One patient has SAE of hepatitis, 
none met the Hy’s law criteria, 5 patients discontinued their treatment due to abnormalities in liver 
enzymes.  The risk for transaminase elevations and the need for monitoring is therefore reflected in the 
product information.  
As cariprazine is a blocker of the serotonin 5HT2C, an increase in appetite and weight and related 
metabolic changes are expected. Both in short- and long-term studies, clinically relevant increases in 
body weight (≥7%, in 6-28%), total cholesterol (> 1.3 × ULN, in 4-7%) and LDL cholesterol (> 1.2 × 
ULN, in 8-26%), triglycerides (>1.2 × ULN, in 5-27%) and fasting glucose (>1.2 × ULN, 5-13%) has been 
observed with cariprazine. Potential clinically relevant weight gain (≥7%) was observed in 7.4% of 
cariprazine treated, 16.4% of risperidone and 6% of aripiprazole treated patients in short term studies,  in 
28% of cariprazine treated patients in group IB studies, as well as in 9.0% in cariprazine treated patients 
during the open-label phase and in 7.1% of placebo treated and 9.8% of cariprazine treated patients 
during the double-blind phase of the RGH-MD-06 study, and in 6% of cariprazine and 7.4% of risperidone 
in the long-term RGH-188-005 study. This indicates that although an initial difference was observed in 
terms of weight gain, with longer exposure no major differences would be expected between the two 
drugs in terms of weight gain or metabolic parameters. Weight gain is a common risk with second 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/353055/2017  
Page 144/162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
generation antipsychotics and due to the high frequency of potentially clinically significant weight gain (≥ 
7%) was observed and reported especially in the long-term studies in the cariprazine program it was 
recommended that weight gain is separated from other metabolic changes and classified as important 
identified risk in RMP.  
No major differences in metabolic parameters or blood pressure shifts from normotensive to stage I or II 
hypertension were observed between risperidone and cariprazine. During the schizophrenia studies 
patients with any cardiovascular disease that was clinically significant, unstable, or decompensated were 
excluded. However, most patients were overweight with a mean BMI ≥ 26 kg/m2. Patients with 
schizophrenia are known to have an increased risk for cerebro- and cardiovascular disorders. This is 
further aggravated by an increased cardiovascular risk from antipsychotic treatment. Based on the data 
available, it seems that this risk is similar for cariprazine and other second generation antipsychotics as 
risperidone. Moreover, considering the dose-dependency of changes in above mentioned variables it is of 
importance that the lowest effective maintenance dose is chosen. In summary, increased blood pressure, 
metabolic changes including dyslipidemia and dysregulation of glucose and weight gain are known class 
effects for atypical antipsychotics. Warnings concerning the metabolic changes, blood pressure 
alterations and their potential consequences are reflected in the product information. 
In general, there were only minor elevations within the reference ranges of prolactin levels observed in 
cariprazine-treated patients in the clinical studies and no AE of hyperprolactinemia was reported. Mean 
decreases in prolactin levels from baseline were seen in all treatment groups, with the exception of the 
risperidone group. Moreover, decreased prolactin levels were more pronounced in women compared to 
men in clinical short-term and open-label studies, whereas prolactin elevations were observed in female 
rats. The prolactin decrease observed in patients with schizophrenia and mania (where first line 
treatments include antipsychotics) were highly probable due to the cessation of the previously taken 
antipsychotic, which potentially caused prolactin increase, and normalizing during cariprazine treatment.  
In the cariprazine schizophrenia program cognition related TEAEs were reported in 1.0% of patients in the 
claimed posology which was similar to placebo and risperidone. Moreover, an improvement in PANSS 
based cognitive subscale was shown for cariprazine both in short-term and long-term studies. 
The effect of cariprazine on the ability to drive or to operate machinery was not systematically evaluated 
in the clinical development program. However since cariprazine causes e.g. akathisia and restlessness it 
can be assumed that it has some effects on the ability to drive or to operate machinery. 
Pre-clinical toxicity showed that phospholipidosis occurred in the lungs of rats, dogs, and mice (with or 
without inflammation) and in the adrenal gland cortex of dogs at clinically relevant exposures (AUC) of 
total cariprazine. In the clinical program no AE potentially related to phospholipidosis was detected in 
form of lung inflammation or adrenal hyperplasia/hyperthropia. Concerning adrenal insufficiency, a 
substantial frequency of clinically relevant weight loss has been observed in especially in long-term 
schizophrenia studies. However, no patient with potentially clinically significant weight increase or 
decrease experienced more than one TEAE indicative of adrenal hypofunction at the same time or multiple 
symptoms that would point into the direction of adrenal malfunction.   
Cariprazine is a teratogenic substance as evidence by the non-clinical findings. As pregnant women were 
excluded in clinical trials, limited data is available on the effects of cariprazine on the reproduction of 
humans. As there are uncertainties concerning potential pharmacokinetic interactions between oral 
contraceptives and cariprazine, the applicant should discuss suitable methods for contraception that 
should be advised to patients. In addition a DDI study with oral contraceptives has been requested by the

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the RMP version 1.5 (dated 17 May 2017) is acceptable.  
2.9.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 06.10.2004. The new EURD list entry will therefore use 
the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.10.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of cariprazine with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture 
of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers cariprazine to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.11.  Product information 
2.11.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

2.11.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Reagila (cariprazine) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains new active substance.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Schizophrenia is one of the most frequent and debilitating psychotic disorders with worldwide lifetime 
morbidity risk of about 1 percent. The age of onset of the first psychotic episode is typically in the late 
teens, but can be as late as into the mid-thirties. Onset prior to adolescence is rare.  
The symptoms of schizophrenia are classified as positive (delusions, hallucinations, disorganised speech, 
and disorganised or catatonic behaviours) and negative (affective flattening, restriction in the fluency and 
productivity of thought and speech and in the initiation of goal directed behaviour). In addition, cognitive 
deficits are common. The positive symptoms appear to reflect an excess or distortion of normal functions, 
whereas negative symptoms reflect a diminution or loss of normal function.  
Primary negative symptoms are outstanding and insistent in up to a quarter of the patients with 
schizophrenia, and approximately half of the first-episode acute schizophrenia and up to two thirds of all 
chronic outpatients might experience negative symptoms at any given time. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Despite the available treatments, there is a substantial unmet medical need especially for treatment of 
negative symptoms which affect up to two thirds of the patients with schizophrenia. To date, no standard 
treatment has been established for negative symptoms. Of the available treatments for schizophrenia, 
clozapine, amisulpride, olanzapine, and risperidone have shown modest efficacy on negative symptoms.  
The hypothetical expectation of cariprazine’s benefits in treatment of schizophrenia including the 
predominant negative symptoms has been based on its receptor profile with partial agonism and 
preferential binding to dopamine D3 receptors in addition to D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The efficacy of cariprazine was documented in five pivotal trials, three short-term trials, one long-term, 
maintenance of effect study, and a long-term study in patients with predominant negative symptoms of 
schizophrenia. The sort-term trials (RGH-MD-16, RGH-MD-04, and RGH-MD-05) were 6-week, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/353055/2017  
Page 150/162 
 
 
 
 
 
 
double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, with fixed or fixed/flexible doses of cariprazine in the range 
1.5-9 mg/day, performed in in adult patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia at European, US 
and other study centers. The active controls were 10 mg aripiprazole and 4 mg risperidone (in study 
RGH-MD-04 and GH-MD-16, respectively). 
The long-term maintenance of effect study, (RGH-MD-06), was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
randomized-withdrawal study in order to assess prevention of relapse, with fixed cariprazine doses of 3 
mg/day to 9 mg/day, for 20 weeks (open-label phase), followed by a placebo-controlled double-blind 
phase of 26 weeks. Patients came from European countries (Ukraine, Slovakia, Romania), India and the 
US.  
The long-term study in patients with predominant negative symptoms of schizophrenia (RGH-188-005) 
had a randomized, 26-week, double-blind, risperidone controlled design in patients with predominant 
negative symptoms, treated with fixed/flexible cariprazine doses of 3 to 6 mg/day, with a target dose of 
4.5mg/day. All patients were from Europe.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The short-term efficacy of cariprazine in acute exacerbation of schizophrenia has been measured as 
improvement primarily in PANSS total score supported by CGI-S scores for the dose range of 1.5-6 
mg/day and was comparable to that of aripiprazole whereas slightly smaller than that of risperidone.  
A dose-dependent decrease in the PANSS total score has been observed in acute schizophrenia patients 
treated with fixed doses of 1.5, 3 and 4.5 mg/day cariprazine and the active control of 4 mg/day 
risperidone after 6 weeks of double-blind treatment in study RGH-MD-16. The LSMD (p-value) for 1.5 
mg/day cariprazine was –7.5 (p = 0.0005); for 3 mg/day, –8.8 (p<0.0001); for 4.5 mg/day –10.4 (p < 
0.0001) and for risperidone -15 (p<0.0001) (LOCF analysis). The PANSS responder status (≥30% 
decrease from baseline) was achieved in all cariprazine dose groups and risperidone treated patients with 
31% (p=0.015), 36% (p=0.002), 36% (p=0.001) and 44% (p<0.001) in 1.5, 3, and 4.5 mg/day 
cariprazine and risperidone, respectively. The secondary endpoint, CGI-S, also showed statistical 
significance over placebo in all dose groups  (LOCF).   
The efficacy of fixed doses 3 and 6 mg/day cariprazine has been shown in study RGH-MD-04 in acute 
schizophrenia patients as the change in PANSS total score was statistically significant over placebo after 
6-weeks double-blind treatment  with 6 mg/day cariprazine (LSMD –8.8, p<0.0001) and 3 mg/day (LSMD 
–6.0, p=0.0044) and with the active-control aripiprazole 10 mg ( LSMD -7.0 , p=0.0008) (MMRM, 
confirmed with LOCF analysis). On the other hand, the responder rates (PANSS≥30%) differed from 
placebo only for the 6 mg/day cariprazine (responder rate, 20% for placebo, 25% for 3 mg/day (p=0.28), 
32% for 6 mg/day (p=0.027) and 30% for aripiprazole (p=0.0313)). The results for the secondary 
end-point CGI-S were statistically significant for all the treatment groups both with MMRM and LOCF 
analysis. 
Statistically significant decreases in PANSS total score were also observed in study RGH-MD-05 in acute 
schizophrenia patients with cariprazine modal doses of 3-6 and 6-9 mg/day, evaluated with a 
fixed/flexible-dose design, titrating patients to the higher doses within groups based on response. The 
LSMD compared to placebo was –9.9 (p<0.0001) for 6 to 9 mg/day group, -6.8 (p=0.0029) for 3 to 6 
mg/day group (MMRM, confirmed with LOCF analysis). The responder rates (PANSS≥30%) did not differ 
from placebo for any of the dose groups (placebo (25%), 3-6 mg (29%, p=0.485), 6-9 mg (35%, 
p=0.07)). The secondary endpoint, change in the CGI-S was statistically significant in both dose groups 
compared to placebo. Doses > 6 mg cariprazine are not covered by the proposed posology.

The maintenance of effect has been shown with relapse-prevention in RGH-MD-06. Patients were 
stabilized on cariprazine during 20 weeks of open-label, flexible dose, 3-9 mg cariprazine treatment 
phase of the study, and during the following 26-week double-blind phase of the study, 48% of 
placebo-treated patients,  25% of patients treated with 3 to 9 mg of cariprazine have met predefined 
relapse criteria (p=0.001, hazard ratio [95% CI]; 0.45 [0.28, 0.73]). The 25th percentile for time to 
relapse was 92 days in the placebo group and 224 days in the cariprazine group. The post-hoc results 
excluding the >6mg doses were similar. 
Cariprazine’s effects on negative symptoms were evaluated in study RGH-188-005, in patients with 
predominant negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The dose range of 3-6 mg/day cariprazine was 
reported to show a statistically significant better improvement in favour of cariprazine over risperidone at 
the end of week 26 (p= 0.002). The LS mean change from baseline at week 26 was -8.9 and -7.4 for 
cariprazine and risperidone, respectively. The pairwise difference was -1.5 (95% CI: -2.4, -0.5). The 
secondary efficacy parameter was the change from baseline to week 26 in the PSP score analysed with 
MMRM and the LSMD for cariprazine was 14.3 and for risperidone was 9.7 (p<0.001). Cariprazine 
decreased the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) total score by 14.3 points compared to 9.7 points 
by risperidone at week 26 (p<0.001); the pairwise difference was 4.6 (95% CI: 2.7, 6.6).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Only a small portion of patients in the schizophrenia development programme came from the EU. Large 
differences in the change of PANSS between geographical areas (i.e. European and non-European) in 
short-term studies RGH-MD-04 and RGH-MD-16 were observed. This is of importance when evaluating 
efficacy  and  other  possible  differences  between  areas  and  when  extrapolating  foreign  data  to  the 
European  population.  The  Applicant  has  appropriately  described  and  discussed  the  suitability  of 
extrapolation of results from clinical studies conducted outside the EU in relation to similarities in standard 
medical care within EU region. 
In short-term there appears to be evidence of dose-response, though in long-term maintenance evidence 
of dose-response or optimal dose is not clear. Efficacy of cariprazine dose 1.5 mg/day in prevention of 
relapse has not formally been studied. The very limited data of long-term exposure for the 1.5 mg/day is 
generated from 7 patients in study RGH-MD-17 open-label study. The effect was maintained in these 
patients. The exposure-response model (PANSS vs concentration of active moiety (cariprazine + DCAR + 
DDCAR)  suggests  that  3  mg  to  4.5  mg  is  efficacious  in  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia  and  that  the 
incremental  benefit  of  higher  doses  is  limited.  Instead,  the  risk  of  treatment  related  adverse  events 
(akathisia, EPS) increases with increasing concentration. The results from PET studies show that 1.5 mg 
to 3 mg cariprazine provides approximately 80% D2 occupancy and 90% D3 occupancy. This indicates 
that dose levels < 3mg may be sufficient for pharmacological response provided that pharmacokinetic 
steady state is reached. The time to achieve pharmacokinetic steady state is long, in the order of one 
month  for  the  total  active  moiety.  Specifically  the  important  active  metabolite  DDCAR  accumulates 
slowly. This implies that clinical efficacy as well as side effects would take long time to develop and may 
be difficult to manage. Based on the totality of the data it can be concluded that dose dependency for 
response is established for the claimed posology 1.5-6mg/day. On the other hand, taking into account the 
dose-dependent adverse events, up-titration and maintenance dose can be adjusted according to the 
clinical judgement of the treating physician and lowest effective dose achieving relapse prevention should 
be maintained.  
There is no adequate PK or efficacy data concerning use in elderly patients suffering from schizophrenia 
and within claimed posology. Only 17 elderly patients using cariprazine with doses 1.5-9 mg/day were 
included into the Japanese study A002-A7; among elderly discontinuation rate due to adverse events was 
almost 50%. No studies in elderly EU population have been conducted. The clinical studies did not enrol

subjects  with  an  age  above  60  years  with  the  exception  of  the  study  on  negative  symptoms, 
RGH-188-005.  However,  the  applicant  used  data  from  the  RGH-188-005  study  to  perform  an 
extrapolation from the efficacy at younger ages to elderly patients. A regression approach in order to 
examine whether there was a decline in efficacy with increasing age revealed that there was no significant 
decline in efficacy in terms of PANSS-FSNS with increasing age.  Overall, it is agreed that the efficacy data 
of  cariprazine  in  older  adults  does  not  seem  to  change  when  compared  to  the  younger  adults.  Thus, 
efficacy  results  from  younger  adults  can  be  broadly  extrapolated  to  the  older  adults.  However,  the 
uncertainties regarding dose recommendation and safety are still remaining and were reflected in the 
SmPC.  
Concerning the treatment of patients with predominant negative symptoms in adult patients, one pivotal 
study was provided; RGH-188-005. Improvement in negative symptoms was shown both for cariprazine 
and risperidone and also supported by the improvement in personal and social performance of patients. 
In  this  study,  the  improvements  for  negative  symptoms  and  personal  and  social  performance  were 
numerically and statistically better for cariprazine treated patients compared to the risperidone group. 
However, the clinical relevance of the difference in results between cariprazine over risperidone is difficult 
to interpret. In the short-term studies, in addition to assessment of positive symptoms, rating of negative 
symptoms was performed with the NSA-16 scale. However, the duration of the study, the acute treatment 
setting and the study population were not appropriate for evaluation of negative symptoms. Thus, the 
results regarding the negative symptom improvement from the short-term studies are only informative 
and no robust conclusions should be drawn based on these results. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The unfavourable effects of cariprazine are comparable to those of other atypical antipsychotics. In the 
clinical schizophrenia studies, up to 81.7% of cariprazine treated patients treated with 1.5-6 mg /day had 
TEAEs, 6.6% had  SAEs, 12.1% discontinued their treatment due to adverse events and there were 3 
deaths. The most frequent AEs were akathisia (14.6%), insomnia (14.0%), and headache (12.1%). Other 
common  AEs  were  restlessness  (6.2%),  weight  increase  (5.1%),  dizziness  (4.5%),  and  CPK  increase 
(2.6%). 
Based on pre-clinical finding of ocular toxicity, ophthalmological tests were performed in both short-term 
and long-term schizophrenia studies. Twenty-four cataract cases were reported in the overall cariprazine 
development  program  of  which  14  has  been  reported  as  related  to  cariprazine  treatment  by  the 
investigators (14/6120=0.22%) and 1 cataract was reported related to placebo (1/1820=0.06%). Six of 
these cataract cases were observed in the schizophrenia program among cariprazine treated subjects 
(6/2728=0.22%).  However,  due  to  several  confounding  risks  of  the  cases,  the  causality  between 
cariprazine treatment and cataract cannot be concluded.  
Extrapyramidal  symptoms,  dominated  by  akathisia,  were  among  the  most  frequent  TAEs  in  the 
cariprazine development program (14.6% in the claimed posology and 3.4% in placebo). Akathisia was 
mostly reported within the initial 5-6 weeks of the cariprazine treatment, however, longer time to onset 
was observed up to week 36 in the long-term studies and with the majority judged as mild to moderate 
in  severity.  Akathisia  was  mainly  managed  with  anti-EPS  medications  (propranolol,  benztropine  and 
trihexyphenidyl) in cariprazine treated patients while with dose reductions in risperidone treated patients 
during the comparison studies. Time to resolution of EPS-related TEAEs tended to be shorter with lower 
doses of cariprazine (measured by days to resolve 50th percentile around 14 days for 1.5 mg, up to 43 
days  for  6  mg).  Akathisia  was  the  second  most  frequent  adverse  event  (following  exacerbation  of 
underlying  disease)  that  led  to  treatment  discontinuation  both  in  short-term  Group  1A  (0.5%)  and 
long-term Group 1B studies (0.7%), open-label phase of the RGH-06 maintenance of the effect study 
(1%) and RGH-188-005 negative symptom study (3%).

Clinically  significant  elevations  in  blood  pressure  and  TAEs  of  hypertension  were  reported  with  low 
incidences in all studies (2.6% related to cariprazine, 1.6% in risperidone, 0.7% in aripiprazole and 1% in 
placebo).  In  patients  treated  with  the  highest  doses  of  cariprazine  dose  range  1.5-6  mg/day,  mean 
elevations in SBP up to 1.9 mmHg and DBP elevations occurred up to 0.9 mmHg with large standard 
deviations suggesting a skewed distribution. Shifts from normotensive status at baseline to stage I or II 
hypertension were reported in all dose groups up to 3.3% of patients in short-term Group 1A studies, and 
up to 14.8% in long-term studies. The risk of hypertension is reflected in the product information together 
with other class effects. 
Elevations of creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) were dose-dependent. Although low frequency for TAEs was 
reported (2.6% within the cariprazine claimed posology and 1.6% in placebo groups) due to the risk of 
the class, rhabdomyolysis is included in the safety specification.  
No  cariprazine-induced  serious  liver  injury  was  reported  during  the  cariprazine  clinical  program  but 
increased liver aminotransferases were observed.  
Unfavourable metabolic changes with cariprazine use may be less harmful than with some other atypical 
antipsychotics (such as risperidone), however; increases in blood glucose, cases with diabetes mellitus 
were  observed;  dyslipidaemias 
(including  hypertriglyceridaemia,  hypercholesterolaemia  and 
hyperlipidaemia) are common ADRs.  
Increased body weight and weight loss were reported in cariprazine treated patients. Potentially clinical 
significant weight gain  increased  (≥7%)  was observed up  to28%  of cariprazine treated patients while 
weight loss (≥7%) has also been observed in up to 12% of patients in long-term studies.  
Sedation related TEAEs were reported up to 7.5 % in overall cariprazine treated patients and were similar 
between the risperidone and cariprazine treated patients in RGH-188-05 negative symptom study, 5.2% 
and 6.0%, in cariprazine and risperidone treated patient, respectively.   
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The applicant has submitted a large amount of safety data, which appear to be representative of the 
target population and sufficient to support the use of the product. Exceptions are the elderly and patients 
with severe renal or hepatic impairment who were not included in the European/US studies and are thus 
currently “missing information”. Only 50 patients aged 65-74 and no patient above the age of 74 received 
cariprazine during the development program; of these only three (not older than 65) were enrolled to the 
main clinical schizophrenia studies.  Thus, only limited data exists on the safety of cariprazine in the 
elderly schizophrenic population. The Applicant has proposed to gather relevant data on elderly patients 
with a targeted follow up questionnaire post approval.  
With regards to long-term use, 508 patients were exposed to the cariprazine claimed posology for the 
duration of 24 weeks and 225 patients for 48 weeks. Moreover, 122 cariprazine treated patients in the 
claimed posology were exposed more than 12 months. At this point, there remains a concern that 
cariprazine may cause late developing AEs such as ocular adverse events (lenticular changes and 
eventually cataracts).  
The causality between cataract cases and cariprazine treatment is not clear due to confounding risk 
factors. However, the dose-dependent blurred vision and observed lenticular changes in ocular 
assessments in long-term studies, reversibility of the few cataract cases after discontinuation of 
cariprazine warrants further evaluation of this risk. The Applicant has proposed routine risk minimisation 
measures in terms of a targeted adverse event form for ocular adverse events, and updated the product 
information with findings on lenticular changes from the clinical development program. Moreover, a PASS 
has also been agreed in order to further characterise this safety concern.

Reproductive adverse findings in rats (both teratogenic effects in the developmental toxicity study, as 
well as adverse effects in the F1-generaiton and unusual adverse findings in F2-generation observed in 
the peri-postnatal study) raises serious concerns regarding exposure in pregnancy as well as of women of 
child bearing potential. For the intended target population, this potential important risk may be 
particularly challenging to handle in clinical use. This is evident by the fact that despite strict 
recommendations to avoid becoming pregnant, 22 pregnancies occurred during the clinical program. 
Based on the non-clinical findings, reproductive toxicity was included as an important potential risk in the 
RMP.  Reagila is not recommended during pregnancy or in women of child-bearing potential not using 
highly effective contraception.  
Akathisia and especially restlessness have been reported in the literature to be associated with suicidality. 
This association has been evaluated in cariprazine program and not confirmed. The high frequency of 
akathisia and restlessness during the initial weeks of the cariprazine treatment and the vulnerable patient 
population with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia are potential risk factors for suicidality. This should 
be considered in routine clinical practise where patients may not be as closely monitored as in the clinical 
trial setting. 
From the clinical PK perspective, the most important uncertainties relate to interactions with CYP3A4 and 
CYP2D6 inhibitors. For various reasons, the ketoconazole (i.e., a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) study may not 
have captured the full extent of CYP3A4 inhibition and the effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on PK of 
cariprazine and its active metabolites is unknown. Additionally, exposure to cariprazine and metabolites 
could increase to unexpectedly high levels if activity of both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 was impaired or 
inhibited, for example, by interactions and/or genetic factors. This is also a potential risk that remains to 
be clarified.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The results of the short-term studies have shown clinically relevant effect of cariprazine in the treatment 
of psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia.   Maintenance of effect in long-term use was confirmed in the 
randomised withdrawal study.  
The pharmacological treatment for the positive symptoms of schizophrenia has progressed with 
introduction of atypical antipsychotics. However, no standard treatment exists for negative symptoms. 
Bearing in mind that the negative symptoms have a great impact on functional disability, decreased 
quality of life, increased burden of illness and poor treatment outcome, any advance in treatment of such 
symptoms would be of substantial value. The study RGH-188-005 was designed to evaluate the effect on 
negative symptoms and has shown significant symptom improvement for both cariprazine and 
risperidone groups. Moreover, a statistically significant difference between cariprazine and risperidone 
was shown for both the improvement in negative symptoms and in PSP score, but the clinical relevance 
of the differences is difficult to interpret.

Most of the observed AEs are expected to be familiar to the practising clinicians and many of them are 
treatable. The exceptions,  i.e. potential AEs that are not commonly expected with antipsychotics, are 
cataracts and the unlikely development of adrenal gland disorders. Again, both of these would also be 
treatable  but  suspicion  and  thus  diagnostics  of  them  may  not  be  a  trivial  issue  in  patients  with 
schizophrenia.  
Positive lenticular shifts (suggesting worsening) have been observed in LOCS III examinations in 
long-term studies and supporting evidence by reductions of visual acuity have been reported.  The 
reversibility of lenticular changes have been discussed further and proved inconclusive based on the 
provided data. The risk for lenticular changes and cataracts will be studied further in a post approval 
safety study and several risk minimization measures are agreed which are considered acceptable based 
on the existing knowledge for this risk.  
Considering class-related adverse events, the incidence of akathisia was somewhat higher for cariprazine 
compared to risperidone and aripiprazole in the comparative studies. This could possibly influence 
treatment adherence, but could most likely be handled in clinical practice with anti-EPS medication.  
Akathisia typically occurs during the initial weeks of the treatment and tends to require several weeks to 
resolve. This may substantially influence the adherence to treatment. Data from schizophrenia studies in 
the cariprazine program show that most of the study discontinuations were due to exacerbation of 
underlying disease and akathisia. Therefore, individual up-titration based on the observed effect and 
tolerance as well as the lowest effective maintenance dose according to the judgement of the treating 
physician is recommended.     
No elevation of prolactin levels was observed in cariprazine-treated patients in the clinical schizophrenia 
studies and no AEs of hyperprolactinemia were reported either. Thus, hyperprolactinemia and 
prolactin-associated signs and symptoms such as galactorrhoea, amenorrhea and gynecomastia in men 
do not seem to be a similar problem with cariprazine as with several other antipsychotics. Additionally, 
the studies did not indicate a harmful effect of cariprazine on renal function. 
The elimination of cariprazine was investigated to an acceptable level based on the data generated using 
the unlabelled mass balance data and performed DDI studies. Undoubtedly, with data from the unlabelled 
mass balance study only, there remains a lack of full understanding in the preclinical bridge regarding 
human metabolites although this uncertainty is considered low. In particular safety concerns related to 
reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity or carcinogenicity are not fully evaluated in the clinical program. As 
Reagila is not recommended during pregnancy or in women of child-bearing potential not using highly 
effective contraception, concerns related to reproductive toxicity are considered mitigated. In addition, it 
is also proposed that reproductive toxicity is included as an important potential risk in the RMP. Thus, the 
main  safety  concern  of  a  potential  unique  human  metabolite  is  related  to  genotoxicity  and/or 
carcinogenicity. However, as cariprazine metabolites share the predominant structural moieties of the 
parent  substance,  and  as  neither  cariprazine,  nor  its  major  human  metabolites  DCAR  and  DDCAR 
unveiled any mutagenic or carcinogenic potential, the risk may be regarded as low. Taken together, the 
available data indicate a low risk for the occurrence of a unique major human metabolite, and if present, 
a potential risk for a mutagenic or carcinogenic potential is also considered low. Therefore, given the risks 
associated  with  prolonged  ocular  human  exposure  to  radiolabelled  cariprazine,  it  was  not  considered 
justified to request further mass balance evaluation.

3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The overall B/R of Reagila is positive. 
Although initially the Applicant requested additional separate indication for the treatment of patients with 
predominant negative symptoms, the CHMP concluded that this is not warranted. This population is 
understood to be included in the general “schizophrenia in adults” indication, which covers both positive 
and negative symptoms.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Reagila is favourable in the following indication: 
Treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Other conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that cariprazine is considered to be 
a new active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union.

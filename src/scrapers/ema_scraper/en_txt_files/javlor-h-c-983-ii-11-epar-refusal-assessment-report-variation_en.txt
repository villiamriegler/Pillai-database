2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in almost all countries. Despite a number of 
advances in recent years, it is still a leading cause of cancer death in women. Anthracyclines 
Javlor 
Assessment report  
EMA/619399/2014 
Page 6/51 
 
 
 
 
(doxorubicin, epirubicin) and taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) are the most active and widely used 
chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer, but increased use of these agents at an early stage of 
disease often renders tumours resistant to these drugs by the time the disease recurs, thereby 
reducing the number of treatment options for metastatic disease. Drug resistance can occur due to 
various mechanisms, including modification of drug efflux membrane transporters as well as alterations 
in β-tubulin. Patients with disease progression or resistance to anthracyclines and taxanes may receive 
capecitabine, gemcitabine, vinorelbine or albumin-bound paclitaxel, but these offer limited duration of 
therapeutic activity. There remains a need for the development of new therapies for breast cancer 
patients whose tumours have progressed to become resistant to anthracyclines and taxanes. The goal 
of systemic therapy in such circumstances is to maximise control of symptoms, prevent serious 
complications, and prolong survival whilst maintaining quality of life. Treatment of recurrent, resistant 
metastatic breast cancer remains a major clinical challenge. 
Javlor contains the active substance vinflunine ditartrate. It is an antineoplastic drug that belongs to 
the vinca alkaloid family. Vinflunine binds to tubulin at or near to the vinca binding sites inhibiting its 
polymerisation into microtubules, which results in treadmilling suppression, disruption of microtubule 
dynamic, mitotic arrest and apoptosis.  
Javlor is indicated in monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or metastatic 
transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract after failure of a prior platinum-containing regimen.  
Efficacy and safety of vinflunine have not been studied in patients with Performance Status ≥ 2. 
Vinflunine treatment should be initiated under the responsibility of a physician qualified in the use of 
anticancer chemotherapy and is confined to units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. 
The recommended posology is 320mg/m² vinflunine as a 20 minute intravenous infusion every 3 
weeks. 
Javlor first received a marketing authorisation via the Centralised procedure in Europe on 21st 
September 2009.   
This variation concerns an application for extension of the approved indications for Javlor. The MAH 
initially applied for the indication: 
“Javlor in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic breast cancer previously treated with or resistant to an anthracycline and who are taxane 
resistant.” 
During the procedure, the MAH amended the wording of the indication to better reflect the population 
in Study VFL 305 “Javlor is indicated in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of adult 
patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer not amenable to curative surgery or 
radiotherapy, who are capecitabine and vinca alkaloid naïve, and were previously treated with or 
resistant to an anthracycline and who are taxane resistant. “ 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Non-clinical studies that were undertaken to support clinical trials or marketing application for 
Vinflunine have been previously reported as part of the marketing authorisation application (MAA) for 
Javlor (EMEA/H/C/000983). No new clinical data have been submitted in this application.

(N) 
(N) 
Vinflunine ditartrate PEC surfacewater value has been refined with the market penetration factor (Fpen) by 
providing reasonably justified market penetration data. The PEC value using refined Fpen is 
0.003226μg/L, below the action limit of 0.01μg/L 
Therefore vinflunine ditartrate is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.  
2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
After evaluating the available nonclinical data on the individual drug products, capecitabine and 
vinflunine and the potential for drug interactions, there is no evidence to suggest a possible 
pharmacology or pharmacokinetic interaction. Toxicology studies showed that both drugs (vinflunine 
Javlor 
Assessment report  
EMA/619399/2014 
Page 8/51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and capecitabine) target the immune system and a potential synergic effect could not be discarded. 
However, clinical data indicate that the combination does not suppose a significant higher risk for 
infections or haematological alterations that than VFL monotherapy in advanced breast cancer patients. 
In addition, alterations of the immune system are easily monitored in humans. Therefore, toxicology 
studies with the combination are not considered necessary. Genotoxicity and embryo-fetal 
development studies with the combination are not required because vinflunine has shown to be 
mutagenic, clastogenic and teratogenic. Likewise, carcinogenicity studies are not warranted to support 
marketing for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer according to the ICH S9 
Guideline. 
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no new clinical data have been submitted in this application which was considered acceptable 
by the CHMP.  
The use of the medicinal product Javlor, 25 mg/ml concentrate solution for infusion at 25 mg of 
vinflunine is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment when prescribed in the two requested 
indications and according to the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
However, a CHMP request for GCP inspection was adopted for the clinical study L00070 IN 305 B0 to 
confirm the robustness of the PFS methodology (primary endpoint), as the integrity of the pivotal 
study was questioned. Investigators adjudicated twice as many false progressions in the CAPE arm as 
in the VFL+CAPE arm.   
GCP inspection - Summary 
Three sites were inspected.  
The findings for the three sites inspected were process related. However, these findings have been 
judged by the inspection team not to have any impact on the integrity, quality and trustworthiness of 
the data of the trial to any major extent, as well as, with no relevant impact on GCP compliance. 
Based on the above, the data in the CSR presented as a whole, was considered from the inspection 
team perspective to be reliable and suitable for assessment in a variation application .

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The currently approved SmPC includes data from the clinical pharmacology studies submitted with the 
original MAA and subsequent Type II variations to fulfil follow up measure (FUM) obligations. No 
specific new clinical pharmacology studies were carried out in support of this application.  
Study VFL 109, a dose-finding and pharmacokinetic study of IV vinflunine in combination with 
capecitabine in metastatic breast cancer (previously assessed for FUM 009, June 2010) was conducted.  
The clinical pharmacological aspects of vinflunine were assessed in the first application for Transitional 
cell carcinoma urothelium. The CHMP considered that the pharmacokinetic data submitted was 
satisfactory and the main PK characteristics had been adequately determined. The analytical methods 
were fully validated and were considered satisfactory. Satisfactory studies were performed to assess 
the distribution of vinflunine in the blood, its binding properties to blood components/plasma proteins 
and elimination. Metabolic pathways were appropriately identified, and the drug interactions studies 
were considered adequate. No healthy subject pharmacodynamic study reports were submitted. The 
pharmacodynamic properties of vinflunine were studied in cancer patient populations. 
Overall, according to the Applicant, no pharmacokinetic interaction was observed in patients when 
vinflunine was combined with neither cisplatin, carboplatin, capecitabine, doxorubicin or gemcitabine. 
The studies VFL 109 and VFL 106 were previously assessed. The main characteristics of these studies 
are described below.

Phase I study of IV vinflunine in combination with Gemcitabine for treatment of advances Non Small 
Cell Lung Cancer in chemonaive patients. Two schedules of vinflunine were studied: day 1 every 3 
weeks (schedule 1) and days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks (schedule 2). Results of schedule 1 were included 
in the original submission. The report submitted in December 2009 was completed with the results of 
schedule 2. Results of the combination of vinflunine plus gemcitabine in NSCLC patients whatever the 
schedule have no impact on data evaluation in bladder cancer patients treated with vinflunine 
montherapy. The pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that no effect of gemcitabine on the 
pharmacokinetics of vinflunine should be expected when drugs are co-administered regardless of the 
administration schedule. The effect of VFL on pharmacokinetics on gemcitabine could not be clearly 
established because of the small number of patients and the large intra-individual variability. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
A single dose-finding and pharmacokinetic study of IV vinflunine in combination with capecitabine in 
metastatic breast cancer (VFL 109, see below) was carried out to determine the maximum tolerated 
dose and the recommended dose for further clinical investigation.  
This study was originally assessed as part of FUM 009 (June 2010). The focus of the assessment at 
that time was the impact to patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract, treated with 
vinflunine monotherapy. 
Mechanism of action 
Vinflunine (VFL) is a microtubule inhibitor obtained by semi-synthesis using an original chemical 
approach in order to selectively modify the catharanthine moiety of the vinca-alkaloid scaffold. 
Vinflunine binds to tubulin at or near to the vinca binding sites inhibiting its polymerisation into 
microtubules, which results in treadmilling suppression, disruption of microtubule dynamic, mitotic 
arrest and apoptosis. In vivo, vinflunine displays antitumour activity against a broad spectrum of 
human xenografts in mice, both in terms of survival prolongation and tumour growth inhibition. 
Primary pharmacology 
Study VFL 109: Study title: A dose-finding and pharmacokinetic study of IV vinflunine in combination 
with capecitabine in metastatic breast cancer 
Method 
Study VFL 109 was an open, non randomised, multicentre dose finding and PK study of vinflunine in 
combination with capecitabine in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The first patient was enrolled 
on the 18th of September and the last patient on 27th February 2009.  The clinical study report is dated 
15th March 2010.  
The Applicant claimed that the study was performed in compliance with Good Clinical Practice. The 
study was carried out at 4 centres in France. Patients were those who had a histologically confirmed 
diagnosis of breast adenocarcinoma and clear evidence of progressive metastatic disease, having 
previously received anthracycline and taxane based regimens.  
Primary objective 
The primary objective was to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 2 different schedules and 
to determine for each the recommended dose (RD). The current recommended posology for VFL 
monotherapy is 320 mg/m² vinflunine as a 20 minute intravenous infusion every 3 weeks.  
• 
The MTD was defined as the dose level at which at least 2 out of 3 or 2 out of 6 patients 
developed a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first cycle. The RD was defined as the 
Javlor 
Assessment report  
EMA/619399/2014 
Page 11/51 
 
 
immediate lower dose. Dose escalation was performed according to the occurrence or not of 
DLT 
• 
The DLT was defined as any of the following treatment-related adverse events occurring during 
the first cycle: 
  Neutrophils < 0.5 x 109 /L for > 7 days or < 0.1 x 109 /L for > 3 days 
 
 
Platelets < 25 x 109/L or thrombocytopenia with bleeding or requiring platelet 
transfusion 
Febrile neutropenia defined as absolute neutrophil count < 1.0 x 109 /L and 
fever > 38.5° C (fever of unknown origin without clinically or microbiologically 
documented infection CTC definition) 
  Any grade > 3 major organ toxicity according to the NCI CTC Version 2.0 
(except alopecia or unpremedicated nausea/vomiting) 
 
Treatment delay more than 2 weeks due to unresolved toxicity after the first 
administration. 
Secondary objectives 
Secondary objectives included the assessment of toxicities of the combination, investigation of the 
potential pharmacokinetic interaction when vinflunine and capecitabine are combined and assessment 
of the antitumour activity of the combination. Efficacy was determined according to RECIST and 
tumour assessment was performed every 2 cycles.  
The dose escalation rules were:

Dose limiting toxicities and recommended dose 
At dose level 1A, 3 patients were treated without DLT. Two higher dose levels were investigated (3 
patients in 2A and 6 patients in 3A) and identified as MTDs. Observed DLTs were G4 neutropenia, G3 & 
4 anorexia, G3 & 4 fatigue, G3 constipation, G3 diarrhoea, G3 abdominal pain and febrile neutropenia. 
3 patients discontinued because of adverse events, all of them were treated at the dose level 3A 
(hand-foot skin reaction, neutropenia and fatigue). Neutropenia was the main limiting toxicity of the

In light of the available PK data from study VFL 109, it was concluded at the time of the assessment of 
FUM009 that, although the submitted data did not require an update to the product information, drug-
drug interaction between vinflunine and capecitabine could not be fully excluded. .

Treatment 
The recommended doses of vinflunine and capecitabine in combination were established in the phase I 
trial VFL 109. In VFL 305, patients were randomised to receive to either: 
Experimental treatment arm - Arm A (TEST): 
•  Vinflunine (Pierre Fabre Medicament) 280 mg/m² as a 20-minute IV infusion on day 1 of each 
cycle repeated every 3 weeks  
•  Capecitabine 825 mg/m² per os twice per day each morning and each evening for 14 
consecutive days beginning on day 1 of each cycle repeated every 3 weeks (self-administered) 
•  Antiemetic prophylaxis (dexamethasone 8 mg or equivalent just before each infusion) and 
constipation prophylaxis (dietary measures and laxatives from day 1 to day 5 of each cycle) 
were predetermined in the study protocol 
•  Doses modifications for vinflunine (280 mg/m², 250 mg/m², 225 mg/m²) and capecitabine 
(825 mg/m² bid, 660 mg/m² bid, 500 mg/m² bid) according to haematological and non-
haematological toxicities were predetermined in the study protocol  
Control arm - Arm B (REFERENCE):  
•  Capecitabine (Xeloda, Roche) 1250 mg/m² per os twice per day each morning and each 
evening for 14 consecutive days beginning on day 1 of each cycle repeated every 3 weeks 
(self-administered) 
•  Doses modifications for capecitabine (1250 mg/m² bid, 950 mg/m² bid, 625 mg/m² bid) 
according to haematological and non-haematological toxicities were predetermined in the study 
protocol 
• 
The innovator capecitabine product is Xeloda (Roche) and the breast cancer indication is: 
Xeloda in combination with docetaxel (see section 5.1) is indicated for the treatment of 
patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. Previous therapy should have included an anthracycline. Xeloda is also 
indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer after failure of taxanes and an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen 
or for whom further anthracycline therapy is not indicated. 
Compliance 
The administration of study treatment was carried out at the investigational centre and supervised by a 
physician or a nurse from the department for vinflunine infusion and Day 1 of capecitabine. The 
investigator and/or the pharmacist performed pill counts on return supplies of capecitabine. In order to 
improve the compliance, a patient leaflet was given to the patients. 
Duration of treatment 
Treatment was administered until disease progression or withdrew from study (unacceptable toxicity or 
other reasons). Treatment could be delayed up to 2 weeks and dosing of VFL and/or CAPE could be 
reduced twice to allow for resolution of toxicity.

Concomitant medication 
The patient must not have received other investigational drugs and/or anti-cancer treatment while on 
study. Authorised ancillary treatments were given as medically indicated including anti-emetics, anti-
diarrhoea and analgesics. Authorised concomitant treatments were: 
•  Anti-emetics (steroids) given according to the protocol 
•  Steroids not to be routinely given except as anti-emetics 
•  Radiotherapy use for bone pain in palliative setting 
•  Bisphosphonate therapy at the discretion of the investigator 
•  Opiates in case of pain. In this case, prophylactic use of laxatives was recommended 
•  Concomitant prophylactic use of colony stimulating factors was not allowed except in case of 
febrile neutropenia and then in prophylactic intent for further cycles, 
• 
Erythropoietin according to institutional practice 
Dose adjustment 
Dose adjustment and/or treatment delay were to be made in case of haematological and/or non-
haematological toxicities 
Crossover 
No crossover to vinflunine was allowed from the CAPE arm. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to show superiority in terms of PFS, assuming a median PFS of 3 months in 
the control arm and a 30% increase in the VFL+CAPE arm, with a type I error of 0.05 and 90% power. 
The primary analysis was planned to occur when 615 events (progression or death) had been 
recorded. The study had 80% power of detecting a 25% increase in median overall survival, assuming 
a median overall survival of 10 months in the control arm (minimum of 631 events required). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was PFS and secondary endpoints included OS, response rate, disease control 
rate, the time to response and duration of response, the time to treatment failure, safety and quality of 
life (EORTC QLQ-C30 & QLQB23 questionnaires).  
The endpoints in the study and their definitions are listed in the table below: 
Primary Endpoint 
Description of Endpoint 
Progression-free survival 
PFS was defined from the time elapsed from the date of randomisation 
until the date of progression or the death (whatever the reason of death). 
Tumour assessment was requested every 6 weeks (+/- 3 working days) 
from randomisation (regardless of the timing of treatment cycles) until 
disease progression was documented 
The PFS was primarily analysed in the Intent-to-treat (ITT) population, 
Javlor 
Assessment report

Independent Review Committee (IRC) and based on RECIST version 1.1.  
Patients lost to follow-up, or without a known record of progression or 
death at time of analysis had the progression-free survival censored at the 
date of last tumour assessment or the date of last contact of a follow-up 
showing no progression, whichever occurs last. 
Secondary Endpoints 
Description of Endpoint 
Overall survival 
Measured as the duration between the date of randomisation and the date 
of death from any cause. 
For those patients not dead at the time of analysis, survival duration was 
censored at the date of last contact if lost to follow-up or at the date of last 
news. 
Tumour response rate  
(overall response rate, 
ORR) 
Defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a complete response 
(CR) or partial response (PR) as best overall (across all time points) 
response from the date of randomisation until disease progression but 
within 30 days from the last administration.  
Confirmation of response was not requested. 
Duration of response 
Measured from the first time that measurement criteria were first met for 
objective response (documented CR or PR) until recurrence/progression or 
death whatever the cause 
Disease control rate 
(DCR) 
Defined as the proportion of patients who achieved at least a stabilisation 
of the disease not counting patients with only non-measurable disease at 
baseline and best overall response of non-CR/non-PD 
Time to treatment failure  Time to treatment failure was measured from the randomisation to the 
date of failure (disease progression, relapse, death, patient’s withdrawal, 
protocol violation, lost to follow-up or start of a new anti-tumoural 
treatment). 
Patients who reached the time point of analysis without failure as defined 
above had the time to treatment failure censored at the date of last tumour 
assessment or last contact of a follow up not showing progression. Patients 
who discontinued treatment for other reason and were lost to follow-up 
were censored at the date of last contact. 
Quality of life 
Completion of QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 (breast specific) questionnaires 
The questionnaires had to be completed within 24 hours prior to 
randomisation, before cycle 3 and then every 2 cycles and at the end of 
treatment evaluation. 
Patients were considered evaluable for health-related quality of life analysis 
if they completed at least 2 questionnaires (including the questionnaire 
completed prior to randomisation). 
Safety 
Reporting of Adverse 
Events and Serious 
Adverse Events  
Any adverse or intercurrent event occurring during the study period, 
spontaneously reported by the patient or observed by others, was to be 
recorded on the AE pages of the CRF, regardless of the relationship to the 
study medications.

Sample size 
The final analysis required at least 615 events (progression or death), which is the number of events 
needed for a two sided, log-rank test at an alpha = 0.05 significance level and a 90% power to show a 
statistically significant difference when the true hazard ratio is 0.77 (median PFS in the test arm is 
30% greater than median PFS of 3 months in the control arm (CAPE - Xeloda SmPC). An expected 
total number of 764 patients had to be randomised. A minimum of 631 deaths were required for the 
analysis of OS to have an 80% power of detecting a 25% increase in median survival in patients who 
received VFL+CAPE, based on a median OS of 10 months in the CAPE alone arm. 
Randomisation  
Treatment and randomisation number were allocated to each patient using an Interactive Voice 
Response System (IVRS). Randomisation was stratified by: Karnofsky PS (90-100 versus 70-80), 
Resistance to anthracycline (yes versus no), Disease measurability (measurable versus non 
measurable), Number of prior chemotherapy lines given in the metastatic setting (0 versus 1 versus > 
1) and Site. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open label study. 
Statistical methods 
Statistical analyses were performed by the Biostatistics Department at IRPF. The final analysis of PFS 
was to be conducted once the required number of events (615 progressions or deaths) had been 
observed. The primary efficacy population was the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. PFS analyses were 
carried out using the IRC assessment of date of progressions, including radiological and clinical review 
of data. The hypothesis of superiority in terms of PFS of VFL+CAPE vs. CAPE was to be accepted if the 
p-value from a stratified log-rank test was smaller than 0.05. 
Population Analysed  
• 
• 
• 
• 
Intent-To-Treat population (ITT): The primary population for the analysis of the efficacy results 
was the ITT population which included all randomised patients whether they received study 
treatment or not and analysed in the arm they were assigned by randomisation. 
Eligible population: The eligible population was made of all randomised patients who had no 
predefined major protocol deviations from inclusion/exclusion criteria and analysed in the arm 
they were assigned by randomisation. The eligible population was used for ancillary analyses of 
PFS and OS. 
Per-protocol population: The per protocol population was composed of all eligible patients, 
treated in the arm assigned by randomisation and with no predefined major deviation during 
the study. The per protocol population was used for ancillary analyses of PFS and OS. 
Evaluable population for response: The evaluable for response population was a subset of the 
eligible population who included all randomised and treated patients who were evaluable for 
response and analysed in the arm assigned by randomisation. To be evaluable, a patient had 
to have received at least 2 cycles of treatment unless progression or death due to progression 
and to have been evaluated at least once after the second cycle. The evaluable for response 
population was used for an ancillary analysis of response only.

• 
Evaluable population for safety: All treated patients were included in the safety analysis and 
were analysed in the treatment arm they actually received. 
Evaluable patients for health-related quality of life assessment had all completed one 
questionnaire (at least two thirds of the questions) within fourteen days prior to randomisation, 
and at least one questionnaire during the study period, just before the third cycle of study 
treatment.

PFS, OS and ORR multivariate analysis. 
Protocol deviations 
A total of 57 deviations concerning 53 patients with at least 1 predefined major eligibility deviation 
were identified. The most frequent eligibility deviations identified were the absence of resistance to 
taxanes (3.9% of all randomised patients, 15 patients in each arm) and the absence of resistance to 
anthracyclines with no minimum cumulative dose received (1.9%). Two patients in each treatment 
group received prior vinca-alkaloid.

Updated analysis (December 19th, 2013) 
An updated analysis of overall survival was performed on December 19th, 2013. An updated analysis 
has provided 31 additional events and HR 0.97 (0.83-1.14), p value 0.6976. The overall survival 
updated confirms the previous reported results of 2.2 months’ median survival advantage favouring 
VFL+CAPE with a reduction of risk of death of 3% [HR (95% CI): 0.97 (0.83-1.14)], this difference 
being not statistically significant.

Clinical benefit 
A clinical benefit was calculated for treated patients with a performance status (PS) and/or weight 
assessed at baseline and at least once assessed during the treatment period. There was no relevant 
change of PS over time between the 2 treatment groups. Weight loss was more frequent in the 
VFL+CAPE arm (30.4% compared to 19.7%).  
Quality of life 
The EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires were to be completed before randomisation, before 
cycle 3 and then every 2 cycles. A total of 256 patients (66.7 %) in the VFL plus CAPE arm and 239 
patients (61.9 %) in the CAPE arm were evaluable for quality of life.

Ancillary analyses 
A multivariate analysis conducted in the ITT population with a Cox’s proportional hazard model was 
performed using the following prognostic factors: age, post-menopausal status, number of organs 
involved, time from initial diagnosis to randomisation, prior hormone therapy, prior neoadjuvant/ 
adjuvant chemotherapy, and hormone receptors and HER-2 status.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This application for vinflunine in combination with capecitabine in breast cancer patients is supported 
by a single pivotal trial, VFL 305. The study was an open, randomised, two-arm, multinational study 
comparing the combination of VFL+CAPE with CAPE in patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer who had received prior anthracycline and who were resistant to taxane. The primary 
endpoint was PFS and secondary endpoints included OS, response rate, disease control rate, the time 
to response and duration of response, the time to treatment failure, safety and quality of life (EORTC 
QLQ-C30 & QLQB23 questionnaires). In CHMP scientific advice, the company was strongly encouraged 
to use OS as the primary endpoint, with PFS reported as a secondary endpoint. The Applicant failed to 
follow this advice. The dose selection for study VFL 305 was based on the results of the dose-finding 
study VFL 109. Observed DLTs for the combination were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, neutropenic 
infection, anorexia, fatigue, constipation, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. The ultimately selected 
regimen had a more favourable toxicity profile; no febrile neutropenia, no severe infection or no grade 
3 - 4 non haematological toxicities. The Applicant’s rationale for the posology is accepted, though it is 
noted that only 7 patients have been treated at the selected dose level, before initiation of the phase 
III study. A lower dose of capecitabine was utilised in the VFL+CAPE arm, compared to the CAPE arm. 
In CHMP scientific advice, the company’s stated position was that the use of a different capecitabine 
dose, leads to the assumption that if the superiority hypothesis of PFS is confirmed, this effect will be 
assigned to vinflunine. The CHMP considered the dose reduction rationale and choice of dose 
reasonable and that the possible loss of efficacy associated with a reduced dose of CAPE would need to 
be overcome by vinflunine in order to demonstrate superiority. 
The indication initially applied for was not in line with the inclusion and exclusion criteria of study VFL 
305. Therefore, during the procedure, the MAH amended the wording of the indication to better reflect 
the population in Study VFL 305 “Javlor is indicated in combination with capecitabine for the treatment 
of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer not amenable to curative surgery or 
radiotherapy, who are capecitabine and vinca alkaloid naïve, and were previously treated with or 
resistant to an anthracycline and who are taxane resistant.  Efficacy and safety of vinflunine have not 
been studied in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with Karnofsky performance 
score < 70%”. 
In relation to GCP, no critical findings were uncovered and most findings were process related. Overall, 
the GCP inspection found that the data in the CSR were considered to be reliable and suitable for 
assessment in a variation application.

No explanation could be found for the inconsistency observed between the IRC and the investigators, 
except for the fact that the assessments by the IRC and the patient’s investigator were performed in 
different conditions. 
A total of 770 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer were randomised, 384 
patients in the VFL+CAPE arm and 386 patients in the CAPE arm. Demographics and disease 
characteristics were generally well-balanced between the 2 treatment groups. The primary analysis 
was performed on the IRC dataset in the ITT population. The addition of vinflunine to capecitabine 
reduced the risk of progression or death by 16%. Median PFS was 4.3 months in the CAPE arm and 5.6 
months in the VFL+CAPE arm, median difference 1.3 months (HR 0.84 95% CI : 0.71 - 0.99, P = 
0.0426). The magnitude of effect is considered to be small. In addition, the statistical significance is 
not very compelling and the Applicant is referred to the CHMP points to consider on applications with 
one pivotal study (CPMP/EWP/2330/99), where it is expected that statistical evidence considerably 
stronger than p<0.05 is usually required, particularly as there is no supportive data from phase II 
studies in the claimed population and posology.  
A similar magnitude of effect was seen in terms of median PFS between the primary analysis of IRC 
and median PFS as assessed by investigators. However, of note is the difference observed in terms of 
the number of events reported by the IRC assessment and the investigator assessment (20 more 
events in the VFL+CAPE arm by investigator & 40 more events in the CAPE arm by investigator. The 
Applicant has attempted to justify the discrepancies between investigators and the IRC, and has shown 
that the results are still positive when taking a conservative approach and incorporating the ‘worst 
case’ from the two assessments into the analysis. Median OS was 13.9 months in the VFL+CAPE arm 
and 11.7 months in the CAPE arm, difference 2.2 months (HR 0.98, 95% 0.83 - 1.15, P = 0.7657). 
The most common reported cause of death was progressive disease. More patients in the combination 
arm died due to progression (80.7% vs 77.5%) and more patients died for other reasons not related to 
either disease progression or toxicity in the CAPE arm (4.9% in the CAPE arm vs. 2.6% VFL + CAPE 
arm). An updated analysis has provided 31 additional events and with a cut-off of 19th December 
2013, HR 0.97 (0.83-1.14), p value 0.6976. The positive trend of 2.2-months median survival 
advantage favouring the VFL+CAPE was observed for both analyses 
Objective response rate (CR+PR) assessed by IRC showed a slight trend in favour of the VFL+CAPE 
arm (22.9% vs. 17.9%) and the disease control rate (CR+PR+SD) was 57.3% in the VFL+CAPE arm 
compared to 47.9% in the CAPE arm. Median time to first response was numerically shorter in the 
VFL+CAPE arm and duration of response was longer (8.4 vs 5.5 months). No difference was observed 
between the 2 arms regarding the duration of disease control. Median TTF was slightly longer in the 
VFL+CAPE arm (4.2 vs 3.6 months). A continuous improvement in the global health status score was 
apparently observed for the VFL+CAPE arm. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The proposed new indication is supported by a single pivotal study. The effect on PFS, the primary 
endpoint, is modest (HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.71-0.99, P = 0.046) and there is no significant effect on 
overall survival (HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.83-1.14, P = 0.6976) or other important secondary endpoint 
e.g. response rate; 22.9% vs. 17.9%, P = 0.1030. The results from study VFL 305 are not considered 
to be statistically compelling for the purposes of a marketing authorisation application.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
All patients who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the adverse events (AE) 
tables. If an AE was reported more than once during treatment, the greatest severity was used for 
tabulation. Adverse events and laboratory abnormalities were graded according to the National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. Safety definitions: 
•  An Adverse Event (AE) - defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
pre-existing medical condition regardless of a causal relationship with treatment occurring at 
any time after patient’s formal entry into the study until the follow up period as defined in the 
respective study protocols 
•  A serious AE (SAE) was defined as an AE that met any of the following criteria: resulted in 
death; was life-threatening; required hospitalisation or prolongation of existing inpatient 
hospitalisation; resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; was a congenital 
anomaly or birth defect. Other events including cancer, overdosage, pregnancy and any 
relevant adverse experience or abnormal laboratory value occurring during the study period 
were also considered as SAEs 
• 
Treatment Emergent Signs and Symptoms (TESS) were considered for analysis of adverse 
events in study VFL 305. A TESS was defined as any event that first occurred during the 
treatment period (i.e. from first drug administration date up to last administration date + 30 
days) or that “worsened” during that study period. 
•  Adverse events of special interest; identified categories of AEs that may either be expected 
with the use of cytostatics or vinca alkaloids, with a focus on VFL 
o  Febrile Neutropenia, Infections with severe neutropenia, Constipation, Ileus, Intestinal 
obstruction, Abdominal pain, Nausea, Vomiting, Stomatitis or mucositis, Diarrhoea, 
Myocardial Infarction/ ischaemia, Cardiac arrhythmias, Cardiac conduction disorders, 
Local injection/infusion site reactions, Extravasation, Peripheral sensory neuropathy, 
Peripheral motor neuropathy, Fatigue, Myalgia, Immediate hypersensitivity Syndrome 
of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), Hepatic dysfunction, 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) 
Patient exposure 
383 patients in the VFL+CAPE arm and 383 in CAPE arm received at least one dose of the study 
treatment (any of the study drugs in the combination arm). The median number of cycles per treated 
patient was 6.0 in the VFL+CAPE arm and 5.0 in the CAPE arm. The total number of cycles received at 
the time of cut-off for the primary analysis ranged from 1 to 35 in the VFL+CAPE arm and 1 to 33 in 
CAPE arm.

Deaths 
At the cut-off date of 20th December 2011 (date for primary analysis), 232 patients in VFL+CAPE arm 
and 235 CAPE arm were dead. The main reason of death was progression in both arms (57.3% in 
VFL+CAPE arm and 56.0% in CAPE arm). For deaths within 30 days of the last study drug dose, the 
majority of deaths were due to disease progression, 5.5% of patients treated with VFL+CAPE and 
5.7% of the CAPE arm. Two deaths (0.5%) in the VFL+CAPE arm were considered secondary to a 
drug-related AE and one (0.3%) in the CAPE arm.

Safety in special populations  
No new studies have been submitted. 
Dose recommendation for special groups:  
Hepatic impairment 
Recommendations for VFL dose adjustment in monotherapy are provided in the SmPC. 
No precise information is available for capecitabine in this specific population. In study VFL 305, 
patients were required to have total bilirubin < 1.5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN), transaminases < 
2.5 x ULN or < 5 x ULN in case of liver metastases and alkaline phosphatase < 5 x ULN at study entry 
with no dose adjustment. 
Renal impairment 
The recommendations for dose adjustment of VFL monotherapy are provided in the SmPC. 
The capecitabine dose of 825 mg/m² BID used in combination with vinflunine in study VFL 305 did not 
require dose adjustment in patients with the 30 ml/min < CrCl < 50 ml/min. In study VFL 305, 
creatinine clearance had to be at least 50 mL/min at study entry with no dose adjustment. 
Elderly patients 
The dose of vinflunine used in study VFL 305 which recruited patients less than 80 years old is 
consistent with the SmPC. For capecitabine, no dose adjustment is needed in elderly patients. 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
Discontinuation 
Seventy one patients were discontinued from treatment because of an adverse event, whatever the 
relationship to the drug(s). Among these 71 patients, 52 (27 in arm A and 25 in arm B) were 
discontinued because of 56 drug-related AEs. The main reason for treatment discontinuation was 
disease progression in both study arms. Other reasons responsible for treatment discontinuation 
included patient’s decision (11.2% in the VFL+CAPE arm, 4.9% in the CAPE arm). 
Dose delays 
A treatment cycle was considered as delayed if administered more than 3 days after the planned date 
(i.e. 3 weeks interval from day 1 of the previous cycle).When VFL is used in combination, with CAPE, 
the percent of dose delay was 38.6%. The reason for dose delay was mostly related to haematological 
AEs (42.2% of delayed cycles).  
•  18.8% of patients had 1 cycle delayed  
•  8.4% of patients had 2 cycle delayed  
•  11.5% of patients had ≥3 cycle delayed  
The most frequent reasons reported for cycle delay were haematological toxicities, mainly neutropenia 
in VFL+CAPE and non-haematological toxicities in the CAPE arm, the most common being palmar-
plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) and hyperbilirubinemia.

Dose reductions 
A total of 50 patients in the VFL+CAPE arm had at least one dose reduction of vinflunine. Dose 
reductions from 320 mg/m² to 280 mg/m² and from 280 mg/m² to 250 mg/m² were to be applied in 
case of haematological and/or non haematological toxicities. For the VFL+CAPE arm: 
•  13.1% of patients had at least one dose reduction 
•  1.3% of patients had at least two dose reductions 
The most frequent reasons for vinflunine dose reduction were neutropenia (16.7% of all dose 
reductions), febrile neutropenia (13.3%) and constipation and intestinal obstruction (16.7%) for non-
haematological toxicities. 
73 patients in the VFL+CAPE arm A and 129 patients from the CAPE arm had at least one dose 
reduction of capecitabine. The most frequent reason for capecitabine dose reduction in both arms was 
drug related non-haematological toxicity. Hand and foot syndrome was the most frequent non-
haematological toxicity that led to dose reduction.

Post-marketing experience 
The first MA for Javlor was obtained on 21st September 2009 in European Union. More recently 
additional MAs have been obtained in Argentina, Lebanon, Australia, New-Zealand, Algeria, Morocco, 
Brazil, Singapore, Israel, Syria and Russia. 
Javlor is currently marketed in accordance with marketing authorisation in Argentina, Austria, Czech 
Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Lebanon, Netherlands, Norway, 
Poland, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Romania, Slovakia, Brazil, Morocco and Syria. A 
Named Patient Basis program is ongoing in Bahrain, Egypt and Emirates. In Switzerland, which does 
not have any MA for Javlor, physicians and hospitals are allowed to import Javlor from the EU zone. 
The number of patients exposed is an estimation, since the first MA, the amount of Javlor sold 
worldwide was 12028.8 g corresponding to 7371 patients. 
Post-marketing experience is issued from the Periodic Safety Update Reports which covered the period 
from 21 September 2009 to 21 September 2012, the last one covering the period from 22 September 
2011 to 21 September 2012. Population exposed presented with transitional cell carcinoma of the 
urothelium (TCCU), except 1 patient treated for renal cancer (off-label use). 
Since the first MA on 21 September 2009, 222 related case reports including 615 individual ADRs were 
registered in the Pierre Fabre pharmacovigilance database. Major SOCs involved were the following: 
“General disorders and administration site conditions” (53 case reports, 130 ADRs), “Blood and 
lymphatic system disorders” (45 case reports, 121 ADRs) and “Gastrointestinal disorders” (44 case 
reports, 121 ADRs). 
Based on clinical safety data, important identified risks were defined as myelosuppression (including 
infection in a context of neutropenia), constipation / ileus and neurotoxicity. Important potential risks 
were ischaemic cardiac events, medication errors. 
In addition to the important risks which emerged during pre-authorisation phase, new risks have been 
implemented during post-authorisation phase. The identified and potential risks for Javlor are listed 
below:

  Reproductive toxicity 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patient exposure is considered to be sufficient for determining safety for the claimed indication, 
combining two known active medicinal products. 383 patients in the VFL+CAPE arm and 383 in CAPE 
arm received at least one dose of the study treatment (any of the study drugs in the combination 
arm). The median number of cycles per treated patient was 6.0 in the VFL+CAPE arm and 5.0 in the 
CAPE arm.  
In terms of the incidence of adverse events, more VFL+CAPE patients compare to only CAPE arm 
patients experienced an adverse event, a drug-related adverse event, a serious adverse event, a 
serious adverse event reported as drug-related and an adverse event leading to discontinuation. As 
expected, the toxicity profile is more favourable in the CAPE arm. In general, treatment emergent 
adverse events (regardless of relationship) were significantly more commonly experienced in the 
VLF+CAPE arm compared to the CAPE only arm. In particularly blood and lymphatic system disorders 
(any grade, 24.5% vs 12.8%), gastrointestinal events (66.8% vs. 57.4%), general disorders and 
administration site conditions (63.7% vs. 43.3%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
(39.2% vs. 26.4%) and nervous system disorders (33.4% vs. 22.7%). As expected, related treatment 
emergent adverse events were significantly more commonly experienced in the VLF+CAPE arm 
compared to the CAPE only arm. In particularly blood and lymphatic system disorders (any grade, 
22.2% vs 12.0%), gastrointestinal events (62.7% vs. 46.5%), general disorders and administration 
site conditions (47.5% vs. 22.7%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (19.6% vs. 3.9%), 
nervous system disorders (17.5% vs. 8.1%) and vascular disorders (5% vs. 1.8%). Drug-related 
treatment emergent AEs of special interest were significantly more commonly experienced in the 
VLF+CAPE arm compared to the CAPE only arm. In particular, neutropenia, constipation, abdominal 
pain, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis or mucositis, local injection / infusion site reactions, peripheral 
sensory neuropathy, asthenia/Fatigue and myalgia. 
More drug-related SAE were experienced in the VFL+CAPE arm compared to the CAPE arm, in 
particular gastrointestinal disorders (8.1% vs. 1.8%) and blood and lymphatic system disorders (3.7 
vs. 1.6). The most frequent SAEs in patients treated with VFL+CAPE were constipation (2.1% of 
patients) and febrile neutropenia (1.8%). At the cut-off date of 20th December 2011 (date for primary 
analysis), 232 patients in VFL+CAPE arm and 235 CAPE arm were dead. For deaths within 30 days of 
the last study drug dose, the majority of deaths were due to disease progression, 5.5% of patients 
treated with VFL+CAPE and 5.7% of the CAPE arm. Two deaths (0.5%) in the VFL+CAPE arm were 
considered secondary to a drug-related AE and one (0.3%) in the CAPE arm. 
Patient’s decision was a more common reason for discontinuation in the VFL+CAPE arm (11.2%) 
versus the CAPE arm (4.9%). The reason for patients’ decision for ending study treatment is not 
known from this study.

2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
More VFL+CAPE patients compare to only CAPE arm experienced an adverse event, a drug-related 
adverse event, a serious adverse event, a serious adverse event reported as drug-related and an 
adverse event leading to discontinuation.  
2.6.  Risk management Plan 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 14 is acceptable. The PRAC endorsed 
assessment report is attached. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The addition of vinflunine to capecitabine reduced the risk of progression or death by 16%. Median PFS 
was 4.3 months in the CAPE arm and 5.6 months in the VFL+CAPE arm, median difference 1.3 months 
(HR 0.84 95% CI : 0.71 - 0.99, P = 0.0426). Only a favourable trend toward an increased median OS 
was observed, median OS was 13.9 months in the VFL+CAPE arm and 11.7 months in the CAPE arm, 
difference 2.2 months (HR 0.98, 95% 0.83 - 1.15, P = 0.7657). Objective response rate (CR + PR) 
assessed by IRC showed a slight trend in favour of the VFL+CAPE arm (22.9% vs. 17.9%) and the 
disease control rate (CR + PR + SD) was 57.3% in the VFL+CAPE arm compared to 47.9% in the CAPE 
arm. A continuous improvement in the global health status score was observed for the VFL+CAPE arm.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The proposed new indication is supported by a single pivotal study. The results from VFL 305 are not 
considered to be statistically compelling for the purposes of a marketing authorisation application 
supported by a single study. No effect on other important secondary endpoints has been shown. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In terms of the incidence of adverse events, more VFL+CAPE patients experienced an adverse event, a 
drug-related adverse event, a serious adverse event, a serious adverse event reported as drug-related 
and an adverse event leading to discontinuation.  As expected, related treatment emergent adverse 
events were significantly more commonly experienced in the VLF+CAPE arm compared to the CAPE 
only arm; blood and lymphatic system disorders (any grade, 22.2% vs 12.0%), gastrointestinal events 
(62.7% vs. 46.5%), general disorders and administration site conditions (47.5% vs. 22.7%), 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (19.6% vs. 3.9%), nervous system disorders (17.5% 
vs. 8.1%) and vascular disorders (5% vs. 1.8%). Drug-related treatment emergent AEs of special 
interest were significantly more commonly experienced in the VLF+CAPE arm compared to the CAPE

only arm. In particular, neutropenia, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis or 
mucositis, Local injection / infusion site reactions, peripheral sensory neuropathy, asthenia/fatigue and 
myalgia. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Patient decision was a more common reason for discontinuation in the VFL+CAPE arm (11.2%) versus 
the CAPE arm (4.9%). The reason for more discontinuations is not known. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Importance of favourable effects 
The claimed magnitude of effect on the primary endpoint PFS is small and supported by only positive 
trends in other important secondary endpoints.  
Importance of unfavourable effects 
The tolerability of the combination therapy can be questioned. More VFL+CAPE patients compare to 
only CAPE arm experienced an adverse event, a drug-related adverse event, a serious adverse event, 
a serious adverse event reported as drug-related and an adverse event leading to discontinuation.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The additional toxicity profile burden is not outweighed by the potential for small benefits in PFS, 
therefore the indication is not approvable. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The effect on PFS is modest and no effect on overall survival or other important secondary endpoint 
has been shown. This does not outweigh the additional toxicity observed. Therefore, the benefit risk 
balance is considered to be negative for the claimed indication. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation not acceptable 
and therefore does not recommend the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following change: 
Variation rejected 
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) -

and who are taxane resistant. 
Grounds for refusal 
Whereas 
• 
• 
• 
The efficacy of vinflunine in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of adult patients 
with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer not amenable to curative surgery or 
radiotherapy, who are capecitabine and vinca alkaloid naïve previously treated with or resistant 
to an anthracycline and who are taxane resistant has not been demonstrated due to a modest 
improvement in PFS being observed; 
Patient exposure is considered to be sufficient and shows an additional toxicity profile burden 
of the combination of vinflunine with capecitabine compared to the capecitabine only treated 
patients in the claimed indication; 
In the absence of established efficacy and considering the additional toxicity of the combination 
treatment, the benefit-risk balance is considered negative; 
the CHMP on the grounds of Article 16 of Regulation 1234/2008/EC has recommended the refusal of 
the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation. 
Additional data/Market exclusivity 
Considering the refusal of the proposed indication, the applicant’s claim that this therapeutic indication 
brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies pursuant to Article 14(11) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 is unfounded.

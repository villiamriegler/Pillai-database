4.   CLINICAL PARTICULARS  
4.1 
Therapeutic indications  
Cervarix is a vaccine for use from the age of 9 years for the prevention of premalignant ano-genital 
lesions (cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal) and cervical and anal cancers causally related to certain 
oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types. See sections 4.4 and 5.1 for important information on 
the data that support this indication.  
The use of Cervarix should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
4.2 
Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
The vaccination schedule depends on the age of the subject.

Age at the time of the first 
injection 
Immunization and schedule 
9 to and including 14 years* 
Two doses each of 0.5 ml. The second dose given 
between 5 and 13 months after the first dose 
From 15 years and above 
Three doses each of 0.5 ml at 0, 1, 6 months** 
*If the second vaccine dose is administered before the 5th month after the first dose, a third dose 
should always be administered. 
**If flexibility in the vaccination schedule is necessary, the second dose can be administered between 
1 month and 2.5 months after the first dose and the third dose between 5 and 12 months after the first 
dose.  
The need for a booster dose has not been established (see section 5.1). 
It is recommended that subjects who receive a first dose of Cervarix complete the vaccination course 
with Cervarix (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population (children < 9 years of age) 
Cervarix is not recommended for use in children below 9 years of age due to limited data on safety 
and immunogenicity in this age-group. 
Method of administration 
Cervarix is for intramuscular injection in the deltoid region (see also sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Cervarix should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or intradermally. No data are 
available on subcutaneous administration of Cervarix (see section 4.4). 
If Cervarix is to be given at the same time as another injectable vaccine, the vaccines should always be 
administered at different injection sites (see section 4.5). 
4.3 
Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use  
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be 
readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. 
Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination especially in adolescents as 
a psychogenic response to the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological 
signs such as transient visual disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during 
recovery. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. 
Administration of Cervarix should be postponed in subjects suffering from an acute severe febrile 
illness. However, the presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, is not a contraindication for 
immunisation. 
The vaccine should under no circumstances be administered intravascularly or intradermally.  
No data are available on subcutaneous administration of Cervarix. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As with other vaccines administered intramuscularly, Cervarix should be given with caution to 
individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder since bleeding may occur following an 
intramuscular administration to these subjects.  
As with any vaccine, a protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccinees.  
Cervarix will only protect against diseases that are caused by HPV types 16 and 18 and to some extent 
against diseases caused by certain other oncogenic related HPV types (see section 5.1). Therefore, 
appropriate precautions against sexually transmitted diseases should continue to be used.  
The vaccine is for prophylactic use only and has no effect on active HPV infections or established 
clinical disease. The vaccine has not been shown to have a therapeutic effect. The vaccine is therefore 
not indicated for treatment of cervical cancer or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).  It is also not 
intended to prevent progression of other established HPV-related lesions or existing HPV infections 
with vaccine or non-vaccine types (see section 5.1 “Efficacy against HPV-16/18 in women with 
evidence of HPV-16 or HPV-18 infection at study entry.”). 
Vaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical screening. Since no vaccine is 100% effective and 
Cervarix will not provide protection against every HPV type, or against existing HPV infections, 
routine cervical screening remains critically important and should follow local recommendations. 
Duration of protection has not fully been established. Timing and need of booster dose(s) has not been 
established. 
Except for asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected subjects for whom 
immunogenicity data are available (see section 5.1), there are no data on the use of Cervarix in 
subjects with impaired immune responsiveness such as patients receiving immunosuppressive 
treatment. As with other vaccines, an adequate immune response may not be elicited in these 
individuals. 
There are no safety, immunogenicity or efficacy data to support interchangeability of Cervarix with 
other HPV vaccines. 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
In all clinical trials individuals who had received immunoglobulin or blood-derived products within 3 
months prior to the first vaccine dose were excluded. 
Use with other vaccines 
Cervarix may be administered concomitantly with a combined booster vaccine containing diphtheria 
(d), tetanus (T) and pertussis [acellular] (pa) with or without inactivated poliomyelitis (IPV), (dTpa, 
dTpa-IPV  vaccines),  with  no  clinically  relevant  interference  with  antibody  response  to  any  of  the 
components  of  either  vaccine.  The  sequential  administration  of  combined  dTpa-IPV  followed  by 
Cervarix one month later tended to elicit lower anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 GMTs as compared to 
Cervarix alone. The clinical relevance of this observation is not known. 
Cervarix may also be administered concomitantly with meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135, Y 
tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT); with combined hepatitis A (inactivated) and 
hepatitis B (rDNA) vaccine (Twinrix) or with hepatitis B (rDNA) vaccine (Engerix B). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Administration of Cervarix at the same time as Twinrix has shown no clinically relevant interference 
in the antibody response to the HPV and hepatitis A antigens. Anti-HBs geometric mean antibody 
concentrations were significantly lower on co-administration, but the clinical relevance of this 
observation is not known since the seroprotection rates remain unaffected. The proportion of subjects 
reaching anti-HBs ≥ 10mIU/ml was 98.3% for concomitant vaccination and 100% for Twinrix given 
alone. Similar results were observed when Cervarix was given concomitantly with Engerix B with 
97.9% of subjects reaching anti-HBs ≥ 10mIU/ml compared to 100% for Engerix B given alone. 
If Cervarix is to be given at the same time as another injectable vaccine, the vaccines should always be 
administered at different injection sites. 
Use with hormonal contraceptive 
In clinical studies, approximately 60% of women who received Cervarix used hormonal contraceptives. 
There is no evidence that the use of hormonal contraceptives has an impact on the efficacy of Cervarix. 
Use with systemic immunosuppressive medicinal products 
See section 4.4. 
4.6 
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
Specific studies of the vaccine in pregnant women were not conducted. Data in pregnant women 
collected as part of pregnancy registries, epidemiological studies and inadvertent exposure during 
clinical trials are insufficient to conclude whether or not vaccination with Cervarix affects the risk of 
adverse pregnancy outcomes including spontaneous abortion. 
However, during the clinical development program, a total of 10,476 pregnancies were reported 
including 5,387 in women who had received Cervarix. Overall, the proportions of pregnant subjects 
who experienced specific outcomes (e.g., normal infant, abnormal infants including congenital 
anomalies, premature birth, and spontaneous abortion) were similar between treatment groups.  
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility, pregnancy, 
embryonal/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Cervarix during pregnancy. Women 
who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, are advised to postpone or interrupt vaccination until 
completion of pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
The effect on breast-fed infants of the administration of Cervarix to their mothers has not been 
evaluated in clinical studies. 
Cervarix should only be used during breast-feeding when the possible advantages outweigh the 
possible risks. 
Fertility 
No fertility data are available. 
4.7 
Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive or use machines have been performed. However, some 
of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” may temporarily affect the ability to 
drive or use machines.

Summary of the safety profile 
In clinical studies that enrolled girls and women aged from 10 up to 72 years (of which 79.2% were 
aged 10-25 years at the time of enrolment), Cervarix was administered to 16,142 females whilst 
13,811 females received control. These subjects were followed for serious adverse events over the 
entire study period. In a pre-defined subset of subjects (Cervarix = 8,130 versus control = 5,786), 
adverse events were followed for 30 days after each injection. In two clinical studies that enrolled 
males aged 10 to 18 years, 2,617 males received Cervarix and were followed-up with active safety 
surveillance.  
The most common adverse reaction observed after vaccine administration was injection site pain 
which occurred after 78% of all doses. The majority of these reactions were of mild to moderate 
severity and were not long lasting.

In clinical trials a similar safety profile has been observed in subjects with prior or current HPV 
infection as compared to subjects negative for oncogenic HPV DNA or seronegative for HPV-16 and 
HPV-18 antibodies. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES  
5.1 
Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Papillomavirus vaccines, ATC code: J07BM02 
Mechanism of action 
Cervarix is an adjuvanted non-infectious recombinant vaccine prepared from the highly purified virus-
like particles (VLPs) of the major capsid L1 protein of oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18. Since the 
VLPs contain no viral DNA, they cannot infect cells, reproduce or cause disease. Animal studies have 
shown that the efficacy of L1 VLP vaccines is largely mediated by the development of a humoral 
immune response. 
HPV-16 and HPV-18 are estimated to be responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancers, 90% 
of anal cancers, 70% of HPV-related high grade vulvar and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia and 78% 
of HPV related high-grade anal (AIN 2/3) intraepithelial neoplasia. 
Other oncogenic HPV types can also cause ano-genital cancers (approximately 30%). HPV 45, -31 
and -33 are the 3 most common non-vaccine HPV types identified in squamous cervical carcinoma 
(12.1%) and adenocarcinoma (8.5%). 
The term “premalignant ano-genital lesions” in section 4.1 corresponds to high-grade Cervical 
Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN2/3), high-grade vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN2/3), high-grade 
vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN2/3) and high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN 2/3). 
Clinical studies 
Clinical efficacy in women aged 15 to 25 years 
The efficacy of Cervarix was assessed in two controlled, double-blind, randomised Phase II and III 
clinical trials that included a total of 19,778 women aged 15 to 25 years. 
The phase II trial (study 001/007) enrolled only women who: 
- 
Were tested negative for oncogenic HPV DNA of types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 
58, 59, 66 and 68 
Were seronegative for HPV-16 and HPV-18 and  
Had normal cytology 
- 
- 
The primary efficacy endpoint was incident infection with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18. Twelve-month 
persistent infection was evaluated as additional efficacy endpoint. 
The phase III trial (study 008) enrolled women without pre-screening for the presence of HPV 
infection, i.e. regardless of baseline cytology and HPV serological and DNA status. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint was CIN2+ associated with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 (HPV-16/18). 
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 and 3 (CIN2/3) and cervical adenocarcinoma in situ 
(AIS) were used in the clinical trials as surrogate markers for cervical cancer. 
The secondary endpoints included 6- and 12-month persistent infection. 
Persistent infection that lasts for at least 6 months has also been shown to be a relevant surrogate 
marker for cervical cancer in women aged 15 to 25 years. 
Prophylactic efficacy against HPV-16/18 infection in a population naïve to oncogenic HPV types  
Women (N=1,113) were vaccinated in study 001 and evaluated for efficacy up to month 27. A subset 
of women (N=776) vaccinated in study 001 was followed in study 007 up to 6.4 years (approximately 
77 months) after the first dose (mean follow-up of 5.9 years). There were five cases of 12-month 
persistent HPV-16/18 infection (4 HPV-16; 1 HPV-18) in the control group and one HPV-16 case in 
the vaccine group in study 001. In study 007 the efficacy of Cervarix against 12-month persistent 
HPV-16/18 infection was 100% (95% CI: 80.5; 100). There were sixteen cases of persistent HPV-16 
infection, and five cases of persistent HPV-18 infection, all in the control group. 
In study HPV-023, subjects from the Brazilian cohort (N=437) of study 001/007 were followed up to a 
mean of 8.9 years (standard deviation 0.4 years) after the first dose. At study completion, there were 
no cases of infection or histopathological lesions associated with HPV-16 or HPV-18 in the vaccine 
group in study HPV-023.  In the placebo group, there were 4 cases of 6-month persistent infection and 
1 case of 12-month persistent infection. The study was not powered to demonstrate a difference 
between the vaccine and the placebo group for these endpoints. 
Prophylactic efficacy against HPV-16/18 in women naïve to HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 
In study HPV-008, the primary analyses of efficacy were performed on the According to Protocol 
cohort (ATP cohort: including women who received 3 vaccine doses and were DNA negative and 
seronegative at month 0 and DNA negative at month 6 for the HPV type considered in the analysis). 
This cohort included women with normal or low-grade cytology at baseline and excluded only women 
with high-grade cytology (0.5% of the total population). Case counting for the ATP cohort started on 
day 1 after the third dose of vaccine. 
Overall, 74% of women enrolled were naïve to both HPV-16 and HPV-18 (i.e. DNA negative and 
seronegative at study entry). 
Two analyses of study HPV-008 have been performed: an event-triggered analysis performed once at 
least 36 CIN2+ cases associated with HPV-16/18 were accrued in the ATP cohort and an end-of study 
analysis. 
Vaccine efficacy against the primary endpoint CIN2+at the end of study is presented in Table 1. In a 
supplemental analysis, the efficacy of Cervarix was evaluated against HPV-16/18-related CIN3+.

or HPV-18)  
(2) including 4 cases of CIN2+ and 2 cases of CIN3+ in which another oncogenic HPV 
type was identified in the lesion, concomitantly with HPV-16 or HPV-18. These cases 
are excluded in the HPV type assignment analysis (see under Table). 
(3) mean follow-up of 40 months post dose 3 
At the event-triggered analysis the efficacy was 92.9% (96.1% CI: 79.9;98.3) against CIN2+ and 80% 
(96.1% CI: 0.3;98.1) against CIN3+. In addition, statistically significant vaccine efficacy against 
CIN2+ associated with HPV-16 and HPV-18 individually was demonstrated. 
Further investigation of the cases with multiple HPV types considered the HPV types detected by 
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in at least one of the two preceding cytology samples, in addition 
to types detected in the lesion to distinguish the HPV type(s) most likely responsible to the lesion 
(HPV type assignment). This post-hoc analysis excluded cases (in the vaccine group and in the control 
group) which were not considered to be causally associated with HPV-16 or HPV-18 infections 
acquired during the trial. 
Based on the HPV type assignment post-hoc analysis, there was 1 CIN2+ case in the vaccine group 
versus 92 cases in the control group (Efficacy 98.9% (95% CI: 93.8;100)) and no CIN3+ case in the 
vaccine group versus 22 cases in the control group (Efficacy 100% (95% CI: 81.8;100)) at the end of 
study analysis. 
In the event-triggered analysis, vaccine efficacy against CIN1 associated with HPV 16/18 observed in 
the ATP cohort was 94.1% (96.1% CI: 83.4;98.5).  Vaccine efficacy against CIN1+ associated with 
HPV 16/18 observed in the ATP cohort was 91.7% (96.1% CI: 82.4;96.7).  At the end of study 
analysis, vaccine efficacy against CIN1 associated with HPV 16/18 observed in the ATP cohort was 
92.8% (95% CI: 87.1;96.4). 
At end of study analysis, there were 2 cases of VIN2+ or VaIN2+ in the vaccine group and 7 cases in 
the control group in the ATP cohort associated with HPV-16 or HPV-18.  The study was not powered 
to demonstrate a difference between the vaccine and the control group for these endpoints. 
Vaccine efficacy against virological endpoints (6-month and 12-month persistent infection) associated 
with HPV-16/18 observed in the ATP cohort at the end of study is presented in Table 2.

Efficacy against HPV-16/18 in women with evidence of HPV-16 or HPV-18 infection at study entry. 
There was no evidence of protection from disease caused by the HPV types for which subjects were 
HPV DNA positive at study entry. However, individuals already infected (HPV DNA positive) with 
one of the vaccine-related HPV types prior to vaccination were protected from clinical disease caused 
by the other vaccine HPV type. 
Efficacy against HPV types 16 and 18 in women with and without prior infection or disease. 
The Total Vaccinated Cohort (TVC) included all subjects who received at least one dose of the 
vaccine, irrespective of their HPV DNA status, cytology and serostatus at baseline. This cohort 
included women with or without current and/or prior HPV infection. Case counting for the TVC 
started on day 1 after the first dose. 
The efficacy estimates are lower in the TVC as this cohort includes women with pre-existing 
infections/lesions, which are not expected to be impacted by Cervarix. 
The TVC may approximate to the general population of women in the age range of 15-25 years. 
Vaccine efficacy against high grade cervical lesions associated with HPV-16/18 observed in TVC at 
end of study is presented in Table 3.

In study HPV-008, the incidence of high grade cervical lesions was compared between the placebo 
and vaccine group irrespective of the HPV DNA type in the lesion. In the TVC and TVC-naïve 
cohorts, the vaccine’s efficacy was demonstrated against high-grade cervical lesions at end of study 
(Table 5). 
The TVC-naïve is a subset of the TVC that includes women with normal cytology, and who were HPV 
DNA negative for 14 oncogenic HPV types and seronegative for HPV-16 and HPV-18 at baseline.

baseline.  
(2) TVC: includes all vaccinated subjects (who received at least one dose of 
vaccine) irrespective of HPV DNA status, cytology and serostatus at

(3) mean follow-up of 44 months post dose 1 
At the end of study analysis, Cervarix reduced definitive cervical therapy procedures (includes loop 
electrosurgical excision procedure [LEEP], cold-knife Cone, and laser procedures) by 70.2% (95% CI: 
57.8;79.3) in TVC-naïve and 33.2% (95% CI: 20.8;43.7) in TVC. 
Cross-protective efficacy 
The cross-protective efficacy of Cervarix against histopathological and virological endpoints 
(persistent infection) has been evaluated in study HPV-008 for 12 non-vaccine oncogenic HPV types. 
The study was not powered to assess efficacy against disease caused by individual HPV types.  The 
analysis against the primary endpoint was confounded by multiple co-infections in the CIN2+ lesions.  
Unlike histopathological endpoints, virological endpoints are less confounded by multiple infections. 
HPV-31, 33 and 45 showed consistent cross-protection for 6-month persistent infection and CIN2+ 
endpoints in all study cohorts. 
End of study vaccine efficacy against 6-month persistent infection and CIN2+ associated with 
individual non-vaccine oncogenic HPV types is presented in Table 6 (ATP cohort).

(1)  ATP: includes women who received 3 doses of vaccine, were DNA negative at month 0 and at 
month 6 to the relevant HPV type. 
The limits of the confidence interval around the vaccine efficacy were calculated. When the value 
zero is included, i.e. when the lower limit of the CI is <0, the efficacy is not considered statistically 
significant. 
The efficacy against CIN3 was only demonstrated for HPV-31 and there was no evidence of 
protection against AIS for any of the HPV types. 
Clinical efficacy in women aged 26 years and older 
The efficacy of Cervarix was assessed in a double-blind, randomised Phase III clinical trial (HPV-015) 
that included a total of 5,778 women aged 26-72 years (median: 37.0 years). The study was conducted 
in North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe. Final analysis was performed at study 
conclusion, 7 years after 1st vaccination.  
The primary endpoint was a combination of a virological and a histopathological endpoint: HPV-
16/18 related 6-month persistent infection and/or CIN1+. The primary analyses of efficacy were 
performed on the ATP cohort for efficacy and the TVC which included a subset of up to 15% of 
women with a history of HPV-associated infection or disease (defined as two or more abnormal 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
smears in sequence, abnormal colposcopy, or biopsy or treatment of the cervix after abnormal smear 
or colposcopy findings). Inclusion of this subset allowed assessment of prophylactic efficacy in a 
population that is thought to reflect a real-world setting, as adult women are the age group generally 
targeted for cervical screening.  
Vaccine efficacy at study conclusion is summarised in the following table.  
There is no evidence whether prevention of persistent infection that lasts for at least 6 months is a 
relevant surrogate marker for cervical cancer prevention in women aged 26 years and above.

Immunogenicity 
Immune response to Cervarix after the primary vaccination course 
No minimal antibody level associated with protection against CIN of grade 2 or 3 or against persistent 
infection associated with vaccine HPV types has been identified for HPV vaccines. 
The antibody response to HPV-16 and HPV-18 was measured using a type-specific direct ELISA 
(version 2, MedImmune methodology, modified by GSK) which was shown to correlate with the 
pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay (PBNA).  
The immunogenicity induced by three doses of Cervarix has been evaluated in 5,465 female subjects 
from 9 to 55 years of age and over 800 male subjects aged 10 to 18 years. 
In clinical trials, more than 99% of initially seronegative subjects had seroconverted to both HPV 
types 16 and 18 one month after the third dose. Vaccine-induced IgG Geometric Mean Titres (GMT) 
were well above titres observed in women previously infected but who cleared HPV infection (natural 
infection). Initially seropositive and seronegative subjects reached similar titres after vaccination. 
Persistence of Immune Response to Cervarix 
Study 001/007, which included women from 15 to 25 years of age at the time of vaccination, 
evaluated the immune response against HPV-16 and HPV-18 up to 76 months after administration of 
the first vaccine dose. In study 023 (a subset of study 001/007), the immune response continued to be 
evaluated up to 113 months. 92 subjects in the vaccine group had immunogenicity data at the [M107-
M113] interval after the first vaccine dose with a median follow-up of 8.9 years. Of these subjects, 
100% (95% CI: 96.1;100) remained seropositive for HPV-16 and HPV-18 in the ELISA assay. 
Vaccine-induced IgG GMTs for both HPV-16 and HPV-18 peaked at month 7 and then declined to 
reach a plateau from month 18 up to the [M107-M113] interval with ELISA GMTs for both HPV-16 
and HPV-18 at least still 10-fold higher than the ELISA GMTs observed in women who cleared a 
natural HPV infection. 
In study 008, immunogenicity up to month 48 was similar to the response observed in study 001. A 
similar kinetic profile was observed with the neutralising antibodies. 
In another clinical trial (study 014) performed in women aged 15 to 55 years, all subjects 
seroconverted to both HPV types 16 and 18 after the third dose (at month 7).  The GMTs were, 
however, lower in women above 25 years. 470 subjects (142 aged 15-25 years, 172 aged 26-45 years 
and 156 aged 46-55 years) who completed study HPV-014 and received the 3-dose schedule were 
followed-up for up to 10 years in the extension study HPV-060. Ten years after administration of the 
first dose, 100% of subjects in the 15-25 years group, 99.2% in the 26-45 years group and 96.3% in 
the 46-55 years group were still seropositive for HPV-16, and 99.2%, 93.7% and 83.8% for HPV-18, 
respectively. In all age groups, GMTs remained at least 5- to 32-fold for HPV-16 and 3- to 14-fold for 
HPV-18 above those elicited in women who cleared a natural infection for both antigens. 
Evidence of Anamnestic (Immune Memory) Response 
In study 024 (a subset of study 001/007), a challenge dose of Cervarix was administered to 65 subjects 
at a mean interval of 6.8 years after the administration of the first vaccine dose. An anamnestic immune 
response to HPV-16 and HPV-18 (by ELISA) was observed one week and one month after the challenge 
dose, GMTs one month after the challenge dose exceeded those observed one month after the primary 
3-dose vaccination. 
Bridging the efficacy of Cervarix from young adult women to adolescents  
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a pooled analysis (HPV-029,-30 & -48), 99.7% and 100% of females aged 9 years seroconverted to 
HPV types 16 and 18, respectively after the third dose (at month 7) with GMTs at least 1.4-fold and 
2.4-fold higher as compared to females aged 10-14 years and 15 to 25 years, respectively. 
In two clinical trials (HPV-012 & -013) performed in girls aged 10 to 14 years, all subjects 
seroconverted to both HPV types 16 and 18 after the third dose (at month 7) with GMTs at least 2-fold 
higher as compared to women aged 15 to 25 years. 
In clinical trials (HPV-070 and HPV-048) performed in girls aged 9 to 14 years receiving a 2-dose 
schedule (0, 6 months or 0, 12 months) and young women aged 15-25 years receiving Cervarix 
according to the standard 0, 1, 6 months schedule, all subjects seroconverted to both HPV types 16 and 
18 one month after the second dose. The immune response after 2 doses in females aged 9 to 14 years 
was non-inferior to the response after 3 doses in women aged 15 to 25 years. 
On the basis of these immunogenicity data, the efficacy of Cervarix is inferred from 9 to 14 years of 
age. 
Duration of the immune response in women aged 26 years and older  
In the Phase III study (HPV-015) in women 26 years and older all subjects seroconverted one month 
after the third dose. At the 84-month time point, i.e. 78 months after completion of the full vaccination 
course, 99.3% and 95.9% of initially seronegative women remained seropositive for anti-HPV-16 and 
anti-HPV-18 antibodies, respectively. All initially seropositive women remained seropositive for both 
anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies. Antibody titers peaked at month 7 then gradually declined 
up to month 18 and stabilized to reach a plateau up to month 84. 
Immunogenicity in males aged 10 to 18 years 
Immunogenicity in males was assessed in 2 clinical trials HPV-011 (N=173) and HPV-040 (N=556). 
The data showed comparable immunogenicity in males and females. In study HPV-011, all subjects 
seroconverted to both HPV-16 and 18 and GMT levels were non inferior to those observed in females 
aged 15 to 25 years in study HPV-012. 
Bridging of clinical efficacy against anal lesions and cancers  
No efficacy study against anal premalignant lesions has been conducted with Cervarix. However, 
studies conducted in girls aged 9 to 14 years (study HPV-071) and in women aged 18 to 45 years 
(study HPV-010) have consistently shown a higher immune response with Cervarix than with the 
comparator for which efficacy data against anal premalignant lesions are conclusive and have shown 
protection. 
Immunogenicity in HIV infected women 
Two clinical studies assessed safety and immunogenicity of Cervarix: 
1.  In study HPV-020, conducted in South Africa, 22 HIV uninfected and 42 HIV infected 
subjects (WHO clinical stage 1; ATP cohort for immunogenicity) received Cervarix. 
2.  Study HPV-019, a comparative study of Cervarix and quadrivalent HPV vaccine was 
conducted in 289 (ATP cohort = 157) HIV uninfected and 257 (ATP cohort = 166) HIV 
infected female subjects aged 15-25 years in Brazil, Estonia, India and Thailand.  
At study entry, HIV infected subjects in both studies had to: be asymptomatic regardless of their prior 
clinical stage; have undetectable viral load (i.e., viral load < 400 copies/ml) for at least six months if 
on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (HPV-020) or highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for at 
least one year (HPV-019); not be diagnosed with active tuberculosis (TB) or on TB therapy;  in HPV-
019 only - have a CD4 cell count > 350 cells/mm3.  
In both studies, seroconversion at month 7 in HIV infected subjects receiving Cervarix was 100% for 
both antigens in the ATP cohort. In HPV-019, seropositivity at month 24 after Cervarix vaccination 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was 100% for HPV-16 antibodies and >96% for HPV-18 antibodies with a Geometric Mean 
Concentration (GMC) level more than 12 times higher than the response to natural HPV infection.  
In both studies, the antibody GMCs in HIV infected subjects appeared lower than in the HIV negative 
subjects (non-overlapping 95% confidence interval). In HPV-019, superiority of immune responses 
(neutralizing antibodies GMT ratios) to both HPV-16 and HPV-18 antigens was demonstrated with 
Cervarix compared to quadrivalent HPV vaccine, at month 7 in HIV infected subjects. The clinical 
relevance of these observations is unknown. No clinical efficacy data exist about protection against 
persistent infection or precancerous lesions among HIV infected women. 
The observed reactogenicity and safety profile of Cervarix in HIV infected women was in line with the 
known safety profile in healthy subjects (see section 4.8). 
5.2 
Pharmacokinetic properties  
Not applicable. 
5.3 
Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, fertility, embryo-foetal and postnatal 
toxicity (up to the end of the lactation period).  
Serological data suggest a transfer of anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies via the milk during the 
lactation period in rats. However, it is unknown whether vaccine-induced antibodies are excreted in 
human breast milk.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Cervarix is and what it is used for  
Cervarix is a vaccine intended to protect from the age of 9 years against the diseases caused by 
infection with Human Papillomaviruses (HPV). 
These diseases include: 
- 
- 
cervical cancer (cancer of the cervix i.e. lower part of the uterus or womb) and anal cancer,  
precancerous cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal lesions (changes in genital or anal cells that have a 
risk of turning into cancer). 
The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types contained in the vaccine (HPV types 16 and 18) are 
responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancers, 90% of anal cancers, 70% of HPV-related pre-
cancerous lesions of the vulva and vagina and 78% of HPV-related pre-cancerous lesions of the anus. 
Other HPV types can also cause ano-genital cancers. Cervarix does not protect against all HPV types. 
When a female or a male individual is vaccinated with Cervarix, the immune system (the body’s 
natural defence system) will make antibodies against HPV types 16 and 18. 
Cervarix is not infectious and so, it cannot cause HPV related diseases. 
Cervarix is not used to treat HPV related diseases already present at the time of vaccination. 
Cervarix should be used in accordance with official guidelines. 
2.  What you need to know before you receive Cervarix  
Cervarix should not be given:  
• 
if you are allergic to any of the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine 
(listed in section 6). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of 
breath and swelling of the face or tongue. 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you are given Cervarix 
• 
• 
• 
if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. 
if you have any disease which reduces your resistance to infection such as HIV infection. 
if you have a severe infection with a high temperature. It might be necessary to postpone the 
vaccination until recovery. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to 
the doctor first. 
Fainting can occur (mostly in adolescents) following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore 
tell the doctor or nurse if you or your child fainted with a previous injection. 
As with all vaccines, Cervarix may not fully protect all people who are vaccinated. 
Cervarix does not protect people from diseases caused by infection with HPV types 16 or 18 if they 
are already infected with Human Papillomavirus type 16 or 18 at the time of vaccination. 
Although vaccination may protect you against cervical cancer, it is not a substitute for regular cervical 
screening. You should continue to follow your doctor’s advice on cervical smear/Pap test (test to 
screen for changes in cells of the cervix caused by an HPV infection) and preventative and protective 
measures. 
As Cervarix will not protect against all types of Human Papillomavirus, appropriate precautions 
against exposure to HPV and sexually transmitted diseases should continue to be used. 
Cervarix will not protect against other diseases that are not caused by Human Papillomavirus. 
Other medicines and Cervarix 
Cervarix can be given with a combined booster vaccine containing diphtheria (d), tetanus (T) and 
pertussis [acellular] (pa) with or without inactivated poliomyelitis (IPV), (dTpa, dTpa -IPV vaccines), 
with a combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine (Twinrix) or a hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix B), or 
with a meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135, Y tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT), 
at a separate injection site (another part of your body, e.g. the other arm) during the same visit. 
Cervarix may not have an optimal effect if used with medicines that suppress the immune system. 
In clinical trials, oral contraceptives (e.g. the pill) did not reduce the protection obtained by Cervarix. 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, might take any other medicines, or have 
recently received any other vaccine. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant, if pregnancy occurs during the course of vaccination or if you are trying to 
become pregnant it is recommended to postpone or interrupt vaccination until after completion of the 
pregnancy. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor for advice before you are given this vaccine. 
Driving and using machines 
Cervarix is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, do not drive or use any 
machines if you are feeling unwell. 
Cervarix contains sodium chloride. 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium-
free”. 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
How Cervarix is given  
How the vaccine is given 
The doctor or nurse will give Cervarix as an injection into the muscle of the upper arm.  
How much is given 
Cervarix is intended for use from 9 years of age onwards.  
The total number of injections you will receive depends on your age at the time of the first injection. 
If you are between 9 and 14 years old 
You will receive 2 injections: 
First injection: at chosen date 
Second injection: given between 5 and 13 months after first injection 
If you are 15 years old or above 
You will receive 3 injections: 
First injection: at chosen date 
Second injection: 1 month after first injection 
Third injection: 6 months after first injection 
If necessary, the vaccination schedule can be more flexible. Please speak to your doctor for more 
information. 
When Cervarix is given for the first dose, it is recommended that Cervarix (and not another vaccine 
against HPV) be given for the complete vaccination course. 
Cervarix is not recommended for use below 9 years of age. 
The vaccine should never be given into a vein. 
If you miss a dose 
It is important that you follow the instructions of your doctor or nurse regarding return visits. If you 
forget to go back to your doctor at the scheduled time, ask your doctor for advice. 
If you do not finish the complete vaccination course (two or three injections depending on your age at 
vaccination), you may not get the best response and protection from the vaccination. 
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this vaccine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Side effects that occurred during clinical trials with Cervarix were as follows: 
♦

•  pain or discomfort at the injection site 
• 
redness or swelling at the injection site 
•  headache

doses of vaccine): 
•  upper respiratory tract infection (infection of the nose, throat or trachea) 
•  dizziness 
•  other injection site reactions such as hard lump, tingling or numbness. 
Side effects that have been reported during marketed use of Cervarix include: 
•  allergic reactions. These can be recognised by: 
itchy rash of the hands and feet, 
swelling of the eyes and face, 
difficulty in breathing or swallowing, 
sudden drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness. 
These reactions will usually occur before leaving the doctor’s surgery.  However, if your child gets 
any of these symptoms you should contact a doctor urgently. 
•  swollen glands in the neck, armpit or groin 
•  fainting sometimes accompanied by shaking or stiffness. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Cervarix should be administered as soon as possible after being removed from the 
refrigerator. However, stability has been demonstrated when stored outside the 
refrigerator for up to 3 days at temperatures between 8°C and 25°C or for up to 1 day 
at temperatures between 25°C and 37°C. If not used at the end of this period the 
vaccine should be discarded. 
A fine white deposit with a clear colourless supernatant may be observed upon storage of the vial. This 
does not constitute a sign of deterioration. 
The  content  of  the  vial  should  be  inspected  visually  both  before  and  after  shaking  for  any  foreign 
particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance prior to administration.  
In the event of either being observed, discard the vaccine. 
The vaccine should be well shaken before use. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Cervarix is and what it is used for  
Cervarix is a vaccine intended to protect from the age of 9 years against the diseases caused by 
infection with Human Papillomaviruses (HPV). 
These diseases include: 
- 
- 
cervical cancer (cancer of the cervix i.e. lower part of the uterus or womb) and anal cancer,  
precancerous cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal lesions (changes in genital or anal cells that have a 
risk of turning into cancer). 
The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types contained in the vaccine (HPV types 16 and 18) are 
responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancers, 90% of anal cancers, 70% of HPV-related pre-
cancerous lesions of the vulva and vagina and 78% of HPV-related pre-cancerous lesions of the anus. 
Other HPV types can also cause ano-genital cancers. Cervarix does not protect against all HPV types. 
When a female or a male individual is vaccinated with Cervarix, the immune system (the body’s 
natural defence system) will make antibodies against HPV types 16 and 18.  
Cervarix is not infectious and so, it cannot cause HPV related diseases. 
Cervarix is not used to treat HPV related diseases already present at the time of vaccination. 
Cervarix should be used in accordance with official guidelines. 
2.  What you need to know before you receive Cervarix  
Cervarix should not be given:  
• 
if you are allergic to any of the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine 
(listed in section 6). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of 
breath and swelling of the face or tongue. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you are given Cervarix 
• 
if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
if you have any disease which reduces your resistance to infection such as HIV infection. 
if you have a severe infection with a high temperature. It might be necessary to postpone the 
vaccination until recovery. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to 
the doctor first. 
Fainting can occur (mostly in adolescents) following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore 
tell the doctor or nurse if you or your child fainted with a previous injection. 
As with all vaccines, Cervarix may not fully protect all people who are vaccinated. 
Cervarix does not protect people from diseases caused by infection with HPV types 16 or 18 if they 
are already infected with Human Papillomavirus type 16 or 18 at the time of vaccination. 
Although vaccination may protect you against cervical cancer, it is not a substitute for regular cervical 
screening. You should continue to follow your doctor’s advice on cervical smear/Pap test (test to 
screen for changes in cells of the cervix caused by an HPV infection) and preventative and protective 
measures. 
As Cervarix will not protect against all types of Human Papillomavirus, appropriate precautions 
against exposure to HPV and sexually transmitted diseases should continue to be used. 
Cervarix will not protect against other diseases that are not caused by Human Papillomavirus. 
Other medicines and Cervarix 
Cervarix can be given with a combined booster vaccine containing diphtheria (d), tetanus (T) and 
pertussis [acellular] (pa) with or without inactivated poliomyelitis (IPV), (dTpa, dTpa -IPV vaccines), 
with a combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine (Twinrix) or a hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix B), or 
with a meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135, Y tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT), 
at a separate injection site (another part of your body, e.g. the other arm) during the same visit. 
Cervarix may not have an optimal effect if used with medicines that suppress the immune system. 
In clinical trials, oral contraceptives (e.g. the pill) did not reduce the protection obtained by Cervarix. 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken, might take any other medicines, or have 
recently received any other vaccine. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant, if pregnancy occurs during the course of vaccination or if you are trying to 
become pregnant it is recommended to postpone or interrupt vaccination until after completion of the 
pregnancy. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor for advice before you are given this vaccine. 
Driving and using machines 
Cervarix is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. However, do not drive or use any 
machines if you are feeling unwell. 
Cervarix contains sodium chloride. 
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium-
free”. 
3. 
How Cervarix is given  
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How the vaccine is given 
The doctor or nurse will give Cervarix as an injection into the muscle of the upper arm.  
How much is given 
Cervarix is intended for use from 9 years of age onwards. 
The total number of injections you will receive depends on your age at the time of the first injection. 
If you are between 9 and 14 years old 
You will receive 2 injections: 
First injection: at chosen date 
Second injection: given between 5 and 13 months after first injection 
If you are 15 years old or above 
You will receive 3 injections: 
First injection: at chosen date 
Second injection: 1 month after first injection 
Third injection: 6 months after first injection 
If necessary, the vaccination schedule can be more flexible. Please speak to your doctor for more 
information. 
When Cervarix is given for the first dose, it is recommended that Cervarix (and not another vaccine 
against HPV) be given for the complete vaccination course. 
Cervarix is not recommended for use below 9 years of age. 
The vaccine should never be given into a vein. 
If you miss a dose 
It is important that you follow the instructions of your doctor or nurse regarding return visits. If you 
forget to go back to your doctor at the scheduled time, ask your doctor for advice. 
If you do not finish the complete vaccination course (two or three injections depending on your age at 
vaccination), you may not get the best response and protection from the vaccination.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Cervarix is and what it is used for  
Cervarix is a vaccine intended to protect from the age of 9 years against the diseases caused by 
infection with Human Papillomaviruses (HPV). 
These diseases include: 
- 
- 
cervical cancer (cancer of the cervix i.e. lower part of the uterus or womb) and anal cancer,  
precancerous cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal lesions (changes in genital or anal cells that have a 
risk of turning into cancer). 
The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types contained in the vaccine (HPV types 16 and 18) are 
responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancers, 90% of anal cancers, 70% of HPV-related pre-
cancerous lesions of the vulva and vagina and 78% of HPV-related pre-cancerous lesions of the anus. 
Other HPV types can also cause ano-genital cancers. Cervarix does not protect against all HPV types. 
When a female or a male individual is vaccinated with Cervarix, the immune system (the body’s 
natural defence system) will make antibodies against HPV types 16 and 18.  
Cervarix is not infectious and so, it cannot cause HPV related diseases. 
Cervarix is not used to treat HPV related diseases already present at the time of vaccination. 
Cervarix should be used in accordance with official guidelines. 
2.  What you need to know before you receive Cervarix  
Cervarix should not be given: 
• 
if you are allergic to any of the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine 
(listed in section 6). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of 
breath and swelling of the face or tongue. 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before you are given Cervarix 
• 
• 
• 
if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. 
if you have any disease which reduces your resistance to infection such as HIV infection. 
if you have a severe infection with a high temperature. It might be necessary to postpone the 
vaccination until recovery. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to

Fainting can occur (mostly in adolescents) following, or even before, any needle injection. Therefore 
tell the doctor or nurse if you or your child fainted with a previous injection. 
As with all vaccines, Cervarix may not fully protect all people who are vaccinated. 
Cervarix does not protect people from diseases caused by infection with HPV types 16 or 18 if they

screen for changes in cells of the cervix caused by an HPV infection) and preventative and protective 
measures. 
As Cervarix will not protect against all types of Human Papillomavirus, appropriate precautions 
against exposure to HPV and sexually transmitted diseases should continue to be used. 
Cervarix will not protect against other diseases that are not caused by Human Papillomavirus. 
Other medicines and Cervarix 
Cervarix can be given with a combined booster vaccine containing diphtheria (d), tetanus (T) and 
pertussis [acellular] (pa) with or without inactivated poliomyelitis (IPV), (dTpa, dTpa -IPV vaccines),

recently received any other vaccine. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant, if pregnancy occurs during the course of vaccination or if you are trying to 
become pregnant it is recommended to postpone or interrupt vaccination until after completion of the 
pregnancy.

against HPV) be given for the complete vaccination course. 
The vaccine should never be given into a vein.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:

However, stability has been demonstrated when stored outside the refrigerator for up to 3 days at 
temperatures between 8°C and 25°C or for up to 1 day at temperatures between 25°C and 37°C. If not 
used at the end of this period the vaccine should be discarded.

A fine white deposit with a clear colourless supernatant may be observed upon storage of the syringe. 
This does not constitute a sign of deterioration. 
The content of the syringe should be inspected visually both before and after shaking for any foreign 
particulate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance prior to administration.  
In the event of either being observed, discard the vaccine. 
The vaccine should be well shaken before use.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  About the product 
Truvelog Mix 30 suspension for injection is a biosimilar medicinal product to NovoMix 30.  
Insulin aspart is a human insulin analogue produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a non-
pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli as the production organism. 
The biphasic insulin analogue preparation (also referred to as SAR341402 Mix 70/30) contains a mixture of 
70% protamine-crystallised insulin aspart (intermediate-acting) and 30% soluble insulin aspart (rapid-acting) 
allowing a biphasic action profile. The insulin aspart in the soluble phase of Truvelog Mix 30 (30% of the total 
insulin) is absorbed more rapidly from the subcutaneous layer than the soluble insulin component of biphasic 
human insulin. The remaining 70% of insulin is in crystalline form as protamine-crystallised insulin aspart; 
this has a prolonged absorption profile similar to human NPH insulin.  
Truvelog Mix 30 is indicated for treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 10 
years and above. 
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin aspart is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding 
of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the 
liver. 
2.2.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
Truvelog Mix 30 has been developed as a biosimilar of the EU reference medicinal product NovoMix 30. 
The quality development is performed as required for new biotechnology-derived drugs and covers the 
relevant information on drug substance and drug product manufacture, control, specifications, and stability 
evaluation. 
The clinical development programme of Truvelog Mix 30  suspension for injection includes the following 
studies: 
Assessment report

Scientific Advice 
The applicant sought CHMP scientific advice in 2012 on the clinical development programme and follow-up 
scientific advices in 2017 and in 2019 (see above). The CHMP agreed on the design of the PK/PD study – a 
single-dose, cross-over PK/PD hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp study in subjects with Type 1 diabetes 
mellitus in two sequential cohorts to demonstrate similarity in exposure and activity of Truvelog Mix 30  to 
NovoMix 30 and NovoLog Mix 70/30. Moreover, the study design EFC15082 comparing efficacy and safety of 
Truvelog Mix 30 and NovoMix 30/NovoLog Mix 70/30 in T1DM patients and T2DM patients has been 
discussed. 
2.3.  Quality aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Truvelog Mix 30 suspension for injection has been developed as a similar biological product to NovoMix 30 
(EMEA/H/C/000308).   
Truvelog Mix 30 is a subcutaneous injection presented as a suspension for injection in a cartridge or 
disposable pre-filled pen, containing 100 units/mL (3.5 mg/mL) of insulin aspart as active substance.  It is a 
biphasic suspension of 30% soluble insulin aspart and 70% protamine-crystallised insulin aspart, both 
produced in Escherichia coli by recombinant DNA technology. 
Other ingredients are: glycerol, phenol, metacresol, zinc chloride, disodium hydrogen phosphate 
heptahydrate, sodium chloride, protamine sulfate, hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), sodium hydroxide 
(for pH adjustment), and water for injections. 
The cartridge consists of type 1 colourless glass with a grey plunger (bromobutyl rubber) and a flanged cap 
(aluminium) with a sealing disk (laminate of isoprene and bromobutyl rubber). The cartridge contains steel 
Assessment report  
EMA/165165/2022

balls to facilitate resuspension. Each cartridge contains 3 mL of suspension. The cartridge can be used with a 
marketed reusable pen injector, or irreversibly assembled into a disposable pen injector (SoloStar). 
2.3.2.  Active Substance 
2.3.2.1.  General information 
The active substance (AS) is a two-chain peptide consisting of 51 amino acids. The international non-
proprietary name (INN) is insulin aspart. It is identical in primary structure to human insulin, only differing in 
amino acid sequence at position 28 of the B-chain. Human insulin is 28B-L-Proline-, whereas insulin aspart is 
28B-L-aspartic acid-. As human insulin, insulin aspart contains 2 interchain disulphide bonds and 1 intrachain 
disulphide bond. The structure, including the change in comparison to human insulin, is outlined in Figure 1. 
Figure 1 – Schematic amino acid sequence 
2.3.2.2.  Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
GMP compliance is confirmed by appropriate documents. Insulin aspart is produced by recombinant DNA 
technology using an Escherichia coli strain as host cell for the expression plasmid. One vial of the working cell 
bank of the production strain is amplified in a seed culture and a pre-fermentation step prior to the main 
fermentation in a fermenter. Product formation is initiated at the main fermentation stage. During the 
expression phase, the insulin aspart fusion protein is produced as insoluble intracellular inclusion bodies. The 
culture is ended after induction when a specified optical density is reached. 
The culture is inactivated. E. coli cells are separated by centrifugation and subsequently subjected to 
disruption by high-pressure homogenisation to liberate the inclusion bodies. The fusion protein is dissolved 
and the insulin aspart precursor pre-pro insulin aspart is formed by a folding reaction. The refolded molecule 
is digested by enzymatic cleavage. 
After purification by chromatography, insulin aspart is isolated by precipitation, washed and dried. The active 
substance is filled into containers for storage.  
Assessment report  
EMA/165165/2022 
Page 14/97 
 
 
 
 
 
The process for insulin aspart production was established for direct processing of intermediate solutions and 
suspensions. Only in-process holding of suspensions and solutions as required by the processing occurs. No 
long-term storage of isolated intermediates is intended. 
The AS manufacturing process is described in sufficient detail. A narrative description of each step is 
provided, including ranges of process parameters and in-process-controls (IPCs). Composition, preparation, 
sterilisation, and storage of culture media are indicated. The active substance manufacturing process is 
considered acceptable. 
Control of materials 
No materials of human or animal origin are used in the manufacturing process of insulin aspart. Quality 
agreements are in place with all suppliers to ensure consistent quality of raw materials. Relevant compendial 
specifications (current editions of Ph. Eur.) are applied to raw materials. Specifications for non-compendial 
materials are defined in the dossier.  
The history and development of the expression system are clearly presented.  
The cell bank system is characterised in line with ICH Q5B and ICH Q5D guidance. Testing panels of the cell 
banks are considered sufficient to ensure their quality. The stability of the production cell line has been 
demonstrated. These cell banks were tested for genetic integrity and consistency of production. These tests 
confirmed the expected genetic characteristics of the cell line and demonstrate genetic stability.  
Adequate protocols for stability monitoring of the MCB and the current WCB have been provided. Results are 
satisfactory. Specifications for release and stability monitoring of new WCBs are considered adequate. 
Adequate protocols for the establishment of new WCBs are provided. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
During the insulin aspart manufacturing process, the quality of the product is ensured by maintaining process 
conditions within predetermined ranges and by IPCs. The criticality of parameters is based on the applicant´s 
risk assessment of the process in order to ensure adequate process performance and product quality 
attributes falling within the established ranges. The classification is transparent and comprehensive. The set 
of IPCs are logical and adequately justified. At three stages (step 10, 13 and 14) of the manufacturing 
process batches may be pooled. The sub-batches are tested in order to ensure their quality before being 
pooled. Overall the critical process parameters and in-process tests are considered adequate. 
Process validation and/or evaluation 
The process verification studies of the commercial manufacturing process were performed by successfully 
manufacturing three AS batches using normal processing parameter set points and conditions. Results of 
critical process parameters, IPCs and final active substance are reported with pre-defined ranges/limits. In 
addition, a large range of additional tests (such as yield, product-related impurities, and process-related 
impurities) were performed to monitor process performance. Overall, the data provided are satisfactory and 
consistent and indicate that each step has been appropriately designed.  
Clearance of process- and product-related impurities has been adequately addressed. The residual level of 
impurities at different stages of the manufacturing process has been determined to provide relevant 
information on the clearance capability of the manufacturing process. 
For intermediates of the downstream process, hold time studies were performed to validate the proposed 
hold times. Microbiological purity and product purity/impurity have been evaluated. Acceptable

microbiological and physico-chemical stability of the process intermediates over the proposed holding time 
could be observed and based on that, the proposed hold times are considered sufficiently justified.  
The applicant proposes a concurrent column lifetime validation approach. The provided criteria and frequency 
of evaluation are satisfactory. Column lifetime validation is considered addressed in an acceptable manner. 
Manufacturing process development 
The AS manufacturing process was developed and validated using a combination of traditional and enhanced 
approaches as described in ICH Q11. The Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) is based on the reference 
medicinal product and other insulins and analogues. Based on the QTTP, critical quality attributes (CQA) were 
identified. The identified CQAs include the quality attributes indicated in Ph. Eur. monograph for insulin aspart 
(2084), which is at least to a great extent based on the reference product. The choice of the CQAs is logical 
for the manufacturing process development and can be largely endorsed.  
The critical process parameters to be monitored during routine production and proven acceptable ranges 
were defined. Overall the manufacturing process development is considered comprehensive and satisfactory, 
supporting the proposed control strategy. 
The first manufacturing process at pilot scale, was used to manufacture a finished product batch for early 
toxicology studies. The finished product batches used in clinical studies were manufactured using AS from 
production scale. Also, the finished product batches included in the analytical similarity exercise and the non-
clinical in-vitro similarity studies with the reference product were manufactured using AS from production 
scale. 
Comparability between AS batches is supported by a comparability exercise comprising release and extended 
characterisation. It can be concluded that comparability between batches has been adequately shown. Pilot 
scale batches can be considered supportive. 
Characterisation 
The structural elucidation and confirmation of insulin aspart have been carried out on insulin aspart 
manufactured by Sanofi. The batch investigated has been manufactured on a full scale and can be considered 
representative for the commercial AS. 
Characterisation was performed using the following analytical techniques: mass spectrometry (MS), amino 
acid sequencing, peptide mapping, isoelectric point determination by capillary isoelectric focusing, ultraviolet 
(UV) / visible absorption spectrophotometry, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared 
(FT-IR) absorption spectrophotometry, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry and reversed phase 
chromatography. The studies cover primary, secondary, tertiary and higher order structural aspects. In the 
studies, comparisons were made with compendial (Ph.Eur., USP and JP) reference preparations. All studies 
supported the proposed structure.  Biological methods are not part of the characterisation section. In-vivo 
and in-vitro biological testing are addressed in the biosimilarity studies. 
Comprehensive analysis and discussion of the impurity profile of insulin aspart including degradation products 
are presented. Altogether, a clear picture is provided on the contribution of the individual amount of a 
product-related substance/ impurity or degradation product to the composition of the active substance.  
Process-related impurities as HCP, DNA, residual enzymes, residual solvents and elemental impurities have 
been addressed and the low levels do not raise any concern. Specified impurities have been present in 
product studied in clinical studies.

2.3.2.3.  Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, and container 
closure 
For active substance, release and shelf-life specifications have been provided that comprise identity testing, 
assay by HPLC, related proteins determination by HPLC and high molecular weight impurities testing by HP-
SEC. In addition, contents of sulphated ash, water and residuals of 1-propanol are tested at AS release and 
during stability. Endotoxins and microbial contamination are also controlled at AS release and during stability.  
Adequate descriptions of the analytical methods including their system suitability criteria and validation have 
been provided. Acceptable data are presented to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed analytical 
procedures.  
Batch analysis data are provided for batches representative of the commercial process. All results comply 
with the pre-defined acceptance criteria of the specification. 
The proposed limits are either complying with the acceptance limits as defined in the Ph. Eur.  Monograph 
insulin aspart or are even stricter.  
The applicant has adopted the compendial standard as primary standard. Sufficient information is provided 
for the preparation of working reference standard currently used in the content assay and for identity.  
Insulin aspart active substance is packaged in stainless steel lidded drums. Detailed information on the 
container closure system of the AS is provided. 
2.3.2.4.  Stability 
The stability studies of the active substance are designed in line with ICH guidelines and do not raise any 
concerns. All test results are presented. A photosensitivity study demonstrated that the active substances is 
sensitive to light degradation. 
The primary stability study and the supportive study provide support for the claimed 5 years shelf life at the 
proposed storage condition of -20°C±5°C, protected from light. Each year, if manufactured, at least one 
commercial production batch will be placed on stability  
2.3.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.3.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product (FP) is a sterile suspension in a 3 mL cartridge intended for parenteral injection. The 
finished product is available as a sterile suspension for injection containing 3.50 mg/mL insulin aspart 
[equivalent to 100 U (units) of insulin per mL]. 
Each cartridge is filled with a nominal fill volume of 3 mL suspension for injection containing 300 U of insulin 
aspart. The cartridge has to be used with a pen injector and there are two presentations: 
•  The cartridge is irreversibly assembled into a disposable pen injector by Sanofi. The combination of 
pen injector and 3 mL cartridge (insulin aspart suspension pen injector) is a multiple-use disposable 
device used to dispense variable doses according to patients’ needs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/165165/2022 
Page 17/97 
 
 
 
•  The cartridge can be used with a compatible reusable pen injector referenced in the product 
information (AllStar and AllStar Pro). 
For each injection, a new sterile needle is needed (not included with the cartridge or pen injector). An overfill 
is applied to ensure that the labelled volume can actually be expelled from the cartridges. 
The excipients are metacresol, phenol, glycerol, disodium hydrogen phosphate heptahydrate, sodium 
chloride, protamine sulphate, zinc chloride, sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment), hydrochloric acid (for pH 
adjustment) and water for injections. No novel excipient is used in the formulation. Most excipients used for 
Truvelog Mix 30 are compendial and tested according to the Ph. Eur. 
Pharmaceutical development 
Formulation development was guided by the biosimilar approach, i.e. the components of the finished product 
were selected to achieve similarity to the reference product. Nevertheless, formulation studies were 
performed to evaluate e.g. the impact of phenol and metacresol on formation of crystals, impact of protamine 
and the influence of zinc concentration and pH range.  
The selected concentrations for the preservatives are considered justified. 
Manufacturing process development 
The manufacturing process development was informed by prior knowledge gained from other insulin 
suspension manufacturing processes. The control strategy was developed based on risk assessments and the 
results of laboratory scale experiments. The entire process development is outlined transparently and the 
control strategy based on the development studies is considered well justified.  
Only minor modifications were made in the manufacturing procedure / process controls to adapt the process 
to the batch sizes and to state-of-the-art equipment.  
Container Closure System 
The primary packaging system of the Truvelog Mix 30 finished product suspension consists of a glass 
cartridge, closed with a plunger stopper, and a disc seal. Steel balls are included in each cartridge to enable 
resuspension.  
The glass used for the cartridge is compliant to Ph. Eur. The rubber materials used for commercial primary 
packaging are identical to those that have been tested during pharmaceutical development and found 
suitable.  
Overall, compatibility of the FP solution with the primary packaging is considered demonstrated.  
The disposable pen marketed in a fixed combination with Truvelog Mix 30 cartridges has been developed 
based on the SoloStar pen. Functionality of the disposable pen has been confirmed in studies with the insulin 
suspension in compliance to the current requirements. The disposable pen injector has been adequately 
described, the materials of construction stated, and biocompatibility of those parts that come into contact 
with the user investigated. The pen device does not come into contact with the FP solution. A notified body 
opinion on the disposable pen in combination with the Truvelog Mix 30 cartridge is provided in section 3.2.R, 
confirming full compliance with the relevant general safety and performance requirements (GSPRs).  
Further, the product information for the cartridge presentation also refers to the re-usable pens AllStar and 
AllStar Pro provided separately. These pens are already used for other finished products containing 100 U/mL 
of insulin. The functionality tests of the cartridge according to ISO requirements were successfully performed, 
Assessment report  
EMA/165165/2022 
Page 18/97 
 
 
 
supporting the general suitability of the cartridge for use with a pen device. EC certificates issued by the 
notified body covering the reusable pens AllStar and AllStar Pro, as well as EC declarations of conformity 
were provided by the applicant. 
Microbiological Attributes 
The finished product suspension is intended for multiple dosing, so that microbial preservation is required in 
line with current guidance. Preservative effectiveness was demonstrated, and container closure integrity 
(CCI) ensures maintenance of sterility throughout shelf-life. 
Compatibility 
No compatibility studies are necessary as the pen itself is not in contact with the product suspension, and the 
FP is not foreseen for any dilution or mix with other products.  
Compatibility of the FP in the disposable pen has been investigated with a variety of injection needles, so that 
the general statement in the SmPC “Only use needles that are compatible for use with Truvelog Mix 30” 
without reference to particular needle configurations is included. 
2.3.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Truvelog Mix 30 is manufactured, analytically tested, packed and released at different dedicated authorised 
sites. GMP compliance of all sites is confirmed by respective documents. 
The finished product manufacturing process follows a two-step manufacturing concept – compounding of the 
insulin aspart premixed suspension for injection and filling into cartridges, followed by pen-assembly, if 
applicable. 
The description of the finished product manufacturing process and its controls is acceptable. The control 
strategy is based on the process characterisation studies, where the impact of process parameters on critical 
quality attributes was evaluated. Critical and non-critical process parameters are stated, as well as critical 
and non-critical IPCs. Classification of the process parameters and IPCs is deemed acceptable.  
Process Validation 
Batches at scale have been executed to confirm that the finished product manufacturing process performs 
consistently. Several tests were performed in addition to the routine testing. All predefined acceptance 
criteria were met, and the resulting batches were compliant with the FP specification. Overall, the data show 
that the FP manufacturing process consistently delivers FP of the desired quality. 
Shipping was successfully validated by simulated shipping studies under temperature-controlled conditions, 
evaluating the impact of shock and vibration. No negative impact on CQAs of the FP solution and container 
closer integrity could be detected.

2.3.3.3.  Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The specifications are considered appropriate for the finished product control at release. Justifications for all 
specification limits have been provided. The finished product specification covers the relevant parameters.  
Sufficient results of batch analyses of FP batches have been provided. 
Reference Materials 
The information on reference materials is satisfactory.  
2.3.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The applicant proposes a 24-month shelf-life for the finished product, when stored at 2-8°C.  
This claim is supported by the provided stability data. 
In-use stability studies have been executed The results support the claimed in-use period of 28 days below 
30°C. 
Light protection of the secondary packaging was confirmed. Based on the results of the stability studies, all 
storage instructions given in the SmPC are supported.  
2.3.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
For the manufacturing of the finished product no animal and/or human derived material is used. This applies 
to the active substance and all finished product excipients, except protamine sulphate. 
Protamine sulphate is a purified mixture of simple protein principles obtained from the milt of salmon which 
has the property of neutralising heparins. For the manufacturing process of protamine sulphate, no materials 
of TSE-relevant animal species or cell culture derived products and additives are used. Therefore, protamine 
sulphate has no risks in terms of human virus infectious disease. 
The finished product complies with the requirements of the note for guidance on minimizing the risk of 
transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal products 
(EMEA/410/01 Rev. 3).

2.3.3.7.  Biosimilarity 
As summarised in Table 1, comprehensive analytical comparability study was performed to evaluate 
similarity between Truvelog Mix 30 (six batches) and the EU reference product NovoMix 30. 
Detailed analytical data of protamine sulphate are provided in the analytical similarity study, confirming 
similarity to protamine contained in the reference product. 
The applicant’s strategy to establish similarity of Truvelog Mix 30 with the EU reference product NovoMix 30 
is endorsed. The attributes tested in the biosimilarity study cover all attributes relevant for the analytical 
Assessment report

comparison. Justification is provided for attributes not included such as process related impurities and 
general pharmaceutical aspects which are covered by the control of finished product section. 
The six Truvelog Mix 30 FP batches included in the analytical studies are considered sufficiently 
representative for the commercial product. Their age at the time of testing is generally lower compared to the 
age of the reference batches. The comparative stability and degradation studies indicate that only minor 
effects on quality attributes could have occurred upon storage of Truvelog Mix 30 and reference products.  
Quantitative results for contents of insulin aspart, excipients and related substances/related impurities have 
been presented in clear graphs plotted in dependence of batch age. This graphical presentation enables 
satisfactory comparison of results. 
Comprehensive comparative physico-chemical characterisation studies have been performed to establish 
structural similarity (primary, secondary, tertiary structure as well as higher-order structure) between 
Truvelog Mix 30 and NovoMix 30. The study design is considered sufficient to detect any possible difference 
in the structure of a relatively less complex protein molecule as insulin aspart. The number of FP batches 
chosen for each test seems appropriate to accommodate the expected variability and where relevant isolation 
of the API was performed and suitability of the isolation process have been investigated.  
With respect to in vitro biological activity reference is made to studies performed with insulin aspart active 
substance and three batches each of NovoLog and NovoRapid (insulin aspart solution for injection). The 
applicant’s view that in-vitro activity is determined by the properties of the active ingredient and the active 
ingredient insulin aspart is identical for both formulations – insulin aspart solution for injection and insulin 
aspart suspension for injection - is considered reasonable. Based on that the proposed similarity in biological 
activity is considered adequately demonstrated. 
No major qualitative and quantitative differences are reported between Truvelog Mix 30 and the reference 
product. In particular, the following can be stated:  
- Comparative results for assay insulin aspart and assay insulin aspart in supernatant are provided.  
- The preservatives m-cresol and phenol are present in the same concentrations in Sanofi’s product and the 
reference product. 
Comparable cIEF electropherograms and SEC chromatograms are provided for the test and reference 
products. Proposed similarity with respect to high molecular weight proteins in Truvelog Mix 30 and NovoMix 
30 is endorsed. 
Summarising, detection and characterisation of impurities in Truvelog Mix 30 and NovoMix 30 have been 
adequately addressed and the reported similarity with respect to the qualitative and quantitative impurity 
pattern in Truvelog Mix 30 and NovoMix 30 is considered adequately demonstrated. 
The pH, zinc content and protamine content of Truvelog Mix 30 batches are found comparable between the 
test and reference product. Also, in-depth characterisation of protamine using LC-MS and NMR techniques 
does not raise any concern with respect to comparability. Likewise, and with respect to resuspendability and 
sedimentation, comparable results can be found for the biosimilar and the reference product. 
Crystal length of the biosimilar seems to be lower than in the reference products but still within the specified 
limit. Particle size distribution of Truvelog Mix 30 is in close agreement with the data of the reference product 
NovoMix 30. During the procedure, the applicant adequately provided further evidence demonstrating no 
significant difference in crystal length and particle size distribution between Truvelog Mix 30  and the 
reference product and their impact on the biosimilarity claim, to respond to a Major Objection. More

specifically the applicant presented particle size distribution for all batches in the biosimilarity exercise, which 
demonstrated the particle size data were in close agreement between the test product and the reference 
product. Additional in-use stability data (after resuspension and before administration) on particle size 
demonstrate a similar behaviour for the test product and the reference product. Optical microscopy data 
(crystal shape and crystal integrity as per Ph. Eur. and BP monographs) demonstrated compliance to the 
pharmacopoeial requirements both for test product and reference product. In addition, the similar 
resuspendability and sedimentation behaviour underlines that there is no impact to be expected for the 
delivery of the drug product to the patient. Based on the results, analytical similarity between Truvelog Mix 
30 and NovoMix 30 could be firmly concluded. 
The comparative in-use stability study is considered sufficiently well designed to demonstrate similarity of 
biosimilar with the reference product under the in-use conditions. The same is true for comparative stability 
and forced degradation studies. No major qualitative or quantitative differences in impurity profiles are 
observed. As confirmed in sensitive LC-MS studies, similar impurities are present in Truvelog Mix 30 and the 
reference product. Similar degradation profiles are also revealed in comparative side-by-side stability studies 
and thermal, hydrolytic and light stress studies.  
Summarising the results for analytical comparability, the specifics of the test product and the reference 
product observed in particle size distribution and crystal length are considered negligible. Particle size 
distribution is found to be similar between test product and the reference product and crystal shape and 
crystal integrity is demonstrated compliant to the pharmacopoeial requirements. In addition, the similar 
resuspendability and sedimentation behaviour underlines that there is no impact to be expected for the 
delivery of the finished product to the patient. Based on the results, analytical similarity between Truvelog 
Mix 30 and NovoMix 30 can be firmly concluded.

2.3.4.  Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The quality part of the dossier for Truvelog Mix 30 is of good quality. Two major objections were raised 
during the procedure: a first one on the differences observed in crystal length and particle size distribution 
between the test and the reference product and their potential impact on the biosimilarity claim, and a 
second one to request the applicant to provide a risk evaluation concerning the potential presence of 
nitrosamine impurities in the finished product applying the principles outlined in the notice “Information on 
nitrosamines for marketing authorisation holders (EMA/409815/2020)” and, in case of identified risk, perform 
confirmatory testing, and implement a control strategy to mitigate contamination with nitrosamines, as 
needed. Adequate responses were received to both MOs. 
Active substance 
The development, characterisation and manufacturing process of insulin aspart active substance have been 
adequately described and are overall considered appropriately controlled. Control of the active substance is 
deemed acceptable. Stability data were presented to support a 60-month shelf life at the proposed storage 
condition of -20°C±5°C, protected from light.  
Finished product 
The finished product is a suspension containing soluble insulin aspart and insulin aspart / protamine crystals 
in a defined ratio of 30/70. The manufacturing process of the finished product has been adequately described 
and is considered appropriately controlled. Pen assembly for the FP presentation in a fixed combination with a 
disposable pen is adequately described and controlled.  
Control of the finished product is deemed acceptable.  
The claimed shelf-life of 24 months at 2-8°C is supported by the stability data provided. 
Biosimilarity 
Based on the results for analytical comparability the specifics of the test product and the reference product 
observed in particle size distribution and crystal length are considered negligible. Particle size distribution is 
found to be similar between test product and the reference product and crystal shape and crystal integrity is 
demonstrated compliant to the pharmacopoeial requirements. In addition, the similar resuspendability and 
sedimentation behaviour underlines that there is no impact to be expected for the delivery of the finished 
product to the patient. Based on the results, analytical similarity between Truvelog Mix 30 and NovoMix 30 
can be firmly concluded. 
2.3.5.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take into account technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following: 
1.  The MAH should reconsider and re-evaluate acceptance limits of specific impurities and specification 
parameters of AS and FP when sufficient experience with commercial manufacturing has been gained.

2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The in vitro and in vivo non-clinical development programme of Truvelog Mix 30 was performed with 
SAR341402 insulin aspart drug substance and reference medicinal products, EU NovoLog and US NovoRapid 
(insulin aspart solution for injection) which was agreed within a CHMP scientific advice procedure (Scientific 
Advice Letter EMEA/H/SA/2316/1/2012/III and Follow-up Scientific Advice Letter 
EMEA/H/SA/2316/1/FU/1/2017/III). Since the active ingredient insulin aspart is identical for both 
formulations – insulin aspart solution for injection and insulin aspart suspension for injection, it was 
reasonable to test biosimilarity between the references EU NovoRapid/US Novolog and test SAR341402. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacology 
The applicant conducted a series of in vitro PD studies to demonstrate similarity between SAR341402 and EU 
and US reference medicinal products, NovoRapid and NovoLog, respectively. The binding affinities to IR-A 
and IR-B were analysed in a competitive binding assay using SPA technology, binding kinetics to IR-A, IR-B 
and IGF-1R were analysed by SPR technology. Receptor authophosphorylation activities were studied using 
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing human IR-A and IR-B, respectively, or mouse embryo 
fibroblasts (MEF) overexpressing human IGF-1R. The potency of metabolic activity was studied by inhibition 
of lipolysis in human adipocytes, by stimulation of glucose uptake in rat L6 myocytes overexpressing Glut4 
transporter, and by inhibition of the Glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) expression in primary human 
hepatocytes. Thymidine incorporation into DNA of human MCF-7 adenocarcinoma cells was used to 
characterize the mitogenic activity of insulin analogues. 
Four batches of Insulin aspart Sanofi (SAR341402 - three commercial batches and one Phase 3 clinical batch) 
and three batches each of NovoRapid and NovoLog were assessed in a comparative biological similarity 
assessment. 
The weighted geometric means together with 95% confidence interval were calculated, first, per batch and, 
second, per compound. Data were also presented in tabular and graphical presentation of individual 
estimates of IC50s or EC50s by batch, including %CV based on the individual EC50/IC50 determinations as 
well as the number of determinations per batch. An equivalence statistical approach by compound (ratio of 
geometric means with 90% confidence interval) was used to compare the results from SAR341402 vs. 
NovoRapid, SAR341402 vs. NovoLog and NovoRapid vs. NovoLog. 
In these comparative studies SAR341402 demonstrated visually comparable receptor binding affinities and 
binding kinetics as well as visually comparable metabolic and mitogenic activities compared to NovoLog and 
NovoRapid. 
In addition, the biological activity of a product-related substance 28B-Succinimid-Ins-Aspart of SAR341402 
was assessed in comparison to SAR341402 using an autophosphorylation of human IR-B assay. The ratio of 
mean EC50s with 90% confidence intervals showed 2.7 less potency of the 28B-succinimide insulin aspart 
compared to SAR341402. 
Nonclinical studies on secondary pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology, pharmacodynamic drug 
interactions and pharmacokinetics were not performed with SAR341402 or Truvelog Mix 30  as the applicant 
Assessment report

relies on the Health Authority (HA) reviewer’s findings of the reference product. This is adequate as such 
studies are not required for non-clinical testing of biosimilars. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Studies on non-clinical pharmacokinetics were not performed with SAR341402 or Truvelog Mix 30 . The 
applicant relies on the Agency's findings on the reference product. This is in line with the guidelines on 
biosimilarity and is accepted. 
Toxicokinetic and anti-drug antibody evaluations were conducted as part of in a 1-month repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in rats with SAR341402, NovoRapid-EU and Novolog-US.  
Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method and a radioimmunoprecipitation 
assay (RIPA) were developed and validated in support of toxicokinetic evaluations in the 1-month repeat 
dose toxicity studies in rats.  
The bioanalytical method LC-MS/MS used to determine the serum concentrations of insulin aspart in rat 
K2EDTA plasma (DOS1496) is considered as successfully validated and suitable for intended use.  
The immunoassay method (RIPA) used to screen rat K2EDTA plasma for the presence of anti-SAR341402 
antibodies (ADA) (DOS1502) is considered as properly set up and validated. 
2.4.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicological development programme with SAR341402 consisted of two 1-month repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in rats and a local tolerability study in rabbits. No studies were performed with the Truvelog Mix 30  
formulation. After dilution of the crystalline insulin aspart protamine suspension, the dissolved active 
substance is not expected to exhibit different pharmacological activity compared with the insulin aspart 
solution. Potential small differences on pharmacokinetic parameters do not justify additional animal testing 
and were assessed during clinical testing. All toxicology studies were conducted in compliance with GLP. 
No relevant differences were found in repeat dose toxicological studies between proposed product 
SAR341402 and the reference product NovoRapid. SAR341402 was considered well tolerated following 
intravenous and paravenous administration, with a possible slight local irritation. SAR341402 was very well 
tolerated following intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations, without local irritation. However, in vivo 
toxicology data may be too insensitive for any conclusions on biosimilarity. According to the EMA guideline on 
non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal products containing recombinant human 
insulin and insulin analogues (2015), toxicity studies could be regarded as unnecessary, and, in relation to 
the 3-R principles, should have been omitted. 
2.4.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
As per the ERA Guideline, peptides and proteins can be exempted from ERA because they are unlikely to result 
in significant risk to the environment. The absence of ERA is acceptable. 
2.4.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution of 
Assessment report  
EMA/165165/2022 
Page 28/97 
 
 
 
the substance in the environment. Therefore, insulin aspart is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
Pharmacology 
According to the Guideline on similar biological medicinal products (CHMP/437/04 Rev 1), the applicant 
submitted a comprehensive panel of in vitro studies comparing the Insulin Aspart SAR341402 with the 
reference products EU NovoRapid /US NovoLog. The applicant’s justification for using Insulin Aspart 
SAR341402 in comparison to EU NovoRapid/US NovoLog in non-clinical comparability studies is considered 
acceptable from a non-clinical point of view.  
The non-clinical in vitro pharmacological programme was developed in line with the recommendations of the 
Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active 
substance: non-clinical and clinical issues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev 1) and the Guideline on non-
clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal products containing recombinant human 
insulin and insulin analogues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev. 1). The applicant conducted 
complementary assays for similarity assessment of in vitro bioactivity between Insulin Aspart Sanofi and EU 
NovoRapid /US NovoLog including: competitive receptor binding assay for determination of IR-A and IR-B 
receptor binding affinity, surface plasmon resonance assay for determination of IR-A, IR-B and IGF-1R 
binding kinetics, InCell western assay to detect autophosphorylation of these receptors. IR- and IGF1R-
mediated metabolic and mitogenic signalling profiles for Insulin Aspart Sanofi, NovoRapid and Novolog were 
shown through three different metabolic and one proliferation cell-based assays. Materials, methods and 
procedures were described in detail. The studies were performed on relevant test systems of biological 
source. The applied analytical procedures are acceptable. The number of repetitive experiments, 
measurement points and replicates per experiments were sufficient. The studies were performed with 
accepted methods with proven sensitivity.  
Four batches for Insulin Aspart Sanofi (SAR341402, one clinical batch and three commercial-scale batches) 
and three batches for each reference medicinal product (three for NovoRapid and three for NovoLog) were 
compared in parallel within each experiment. The raw data for the analysis were presented.  
The results (weighted geometric means of IC50s and EC50s with 95% CI; dose-response curves) 
demonstrated that the biological activity of the Insulin Aspart in SAR341402, NovoRapid and NovoLog were 
comparable in terms of IR-A and IR-B receptor binding and activation, the capability of receptor activated 
inhibition of lipolysis in human adipocytes, suppression of gluconeogenesis in hepatic cells and glucose uptake 
into myocytes, which are the primary mechanisms of action, as well as IGF-1R receptor activation and 
induction of proliferation of human adenocarcinoma cells. Similarity between the test and references was 
assessed per assay and was based on the supportive statistical analysis using an equivalence approach. For 
all the parameters tested, the 90% confidence intervals of the ratio of means between the test and 
references were within the defined acceptance criteria. The applicant has provided additional information on 
the statistical approach to assess biosimilarity with relevant details.  As regards two batches from DIVT0112, 
DIVT0113 studies which were replaced from original investigation, the applicant already provided sufficient 
explanation with reasons for sample reanalysis during the procedure of the MA application submitted for 
Insulin Aspart Sanofi – rapid-acting solution for injection (EMA procedure number EMEA/H/C/005033, EPAR 
(EMA/CHMP/269410/2020) page 36/90). The strategy of similarity assessment is endorsed.  
No secondary pharmacodynamic, safety and pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies were conducted.  
This is considered acceptable as such studies are not required for non-clinical testing of biosimilars.

Pharmacokinetics 
An LC-MS/MS bioanalytical method was validated for the estimation of SAR341402 in K2EDTA rat plasma 
over the range 1.00 ng/mL to 500.00 ng/mL for the toxicokinetic study (DOS1469). The method met the 
acceptance criteria for parameters evaluated, demonstrating acceptable LC-MS/MS method performance for 
the analysis of SAR341402 in rat plasma samples over the concentration range 1 – 500 ng/ml. 
The immunogenicity method for determination of Anti-SAR341402, Anti-Aspart US and Anti-Aspart EU 
Antibodies in rat plasma is considered to be successfully validated as the method met the acceptance criteria 
for parameters evaluated. 
There are no distribution, metabolism, excretion or additional studies provided by the applicant and those 
studies are not needed for testing of biosimilars.  
Toxicology 
The applicant performed two 1-month repeat-dose toxicological animal studies to provide complementary 
information on biosimilarity for showing similarity between SAR341402 and the two reference products 
NovoRapid EU and NovoLog US. A local SC, IV, PV and IM tolerance study in male rabbits has been 
performed, where SAR341402 was compared with NovoRapid (EU) and control. No relevant differences were 
found in toxicological studies, however, in vivo data may be too insensitive for any conclusions on 
biosimilarity and are therefore not necessary according to the guideline. Truvelog Mix 30  was not tested in in 
vitro bioactivity assays nor in toxicology studies, because the toxicology profile of SAR341402, when tested 
as solution, is considered to be comparable; potential small differences on pharmacokinetic parameters do 
not justify additional animal testing. 
The SmPC is in line with the one of the reference product and is thus acceptable. 
2.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical point of view, Insulin Aspart Mix product (SAR341402 Mix) is accepted as biosimilar to the 
reference medicinal product NovoMix based on the comparability data between the Insulin Aspart (SAR341402) 
and reference medicinal product NovoRapid-EU/NovoLog-US.  
No relevant differences between SAR341402 and the two reference products NovoRapid EU and NovoLog US 
were  found  in  toxicological  studies,  however,  in  vivo  data  may  be  too  insensitive  for  any  conclusions  on 
biosimilarity and are therefore not necessary according to the guideline. 
As concerns the environmental risk assessment (ERA), the applicant’s justification for non-submission of an 
ERA  is  considered  acceptable  as  the  active  substance  is  a  natural  substance  and  its  use  will  not  alter  the 
concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, insulin aspart is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment.

Study PDY15084   
The comparative pharmacokinetics of Truvelog Mix 30 and the insulin aspart mix EU and US reference 
products NovoMix 30 and NovoLog Mix 70/30, respectively, were investigated in a randomised, double-blind, 
single-dose, 4-treatment, crossover study in 2 cohorts of participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). 
The development programme of Truvelog Mix 30 was planned worldwide; thus, study PDY15084 includes the 
US-reference product, NovoLog Mix 70/30.

The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate similarity in exposure of Truvelog Mix 30 to NovoLog 
Mix 70/30 and NovoMix 30 and to demonstrate distinctiveness in early and intermediate exposure of Truvelog 
Mix 30 compared to SAR341402 rapid-acting solution. The secondary objective was to demonstrate similarity 
in activity of Truvelog Mix 30 to NovoLog Mix 70/30 and NovoMix 30, distinctiveness in early and 
intermediate activity of Truvelog Mix 30 30 compared to SAR341402 rapid-acting solution, safety and 
tolerability of SAR341402 rapid-acting and Truvelog Mix 30 .  
The study was conducted in patients with T1DM as most suitable population. Overall, a total of 52 patients 
were enrolled into the study and 48 patients completed the study. In Cohort 1, 36 patients were randomised 
and 34 patients completed all 3 study TPs. In Cohort 2, 16 patients were randomised and 14 patients 
completed both TPs.  
A specific ultra-performance liquid chromatography method with tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-
MS/MS) and immunoaffinity purification was developed and validated for the analysis of SAR341402 in 
human EDTA K2 plasma. The analytical method was adequately validated and was proven to be precise, 
accurate and sensitive over the validated range. Selectivity, carry-over, calibration, accuracy, precision, 
dilution integrity, matrix effect and other stability investigations were all within acceptance limits. 
The PK parameters were summarised for each cohort by descriptive statistic (such as mean, median, 
standard deviation (SD), standard error of the mean (SEM), coefficient of variance (CV %), minimum, and 
maximum for each treatment. 
Cohort 1 
Primary PK endpoints in Cohort 1 were: 
• Maximum insulin concentration (INS-Cmax) 
• Area under the insulin concentration time curve (INS-AUClast) 
Secondary PK endpoints in Cohort 1 were: 
• Area under the insulin concentration time curve from 0 to infinity (INS-AUC) 
• Area under the insulin concentration time curve for fractional periods post administration (INS-AUC0-4H, 
INS-AUC0-24H, INS-AUC4-24H)

• Half-life (INS-t1/2) 
Cohort 2 
Primary PK endpoints in Cohort 2 were: 
• Area under the insulin concentration time curve from 0 to 4 hours post administration (INS-AUC0-4H) 
• Area under the insulin concentration time curve from 4 to 12 hours post administration 
(INS-AUC4-12H) 
• Maximum insulin concentration (INS-Cmax) 
Secondary PK endpoint in Cohort was: 
• Time to Cmax (INS-tmax) 
Study Results  
Cohort 1 
Primary pharmacokinetic variables: 
The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the treatment ratios for the primary PK parameters, INS-Cmax and INS-
AUClast, were entirely within the predefined acceptance range (0.80 to 1.25). While the CIs for INS-Cmax were 
entirely within the predefined acceptance range, the value 1 was only included in the comparison of Truvelog 
Mix 30 and NovoMix 30, but not in the comparison versus NovoLog Mix 70/30. 
The applicant justified the fact that the upper confidence limits for the ratios in INS-Cmax do not cross value 1 
by an experimental variability.  
According to the applicant this result suggests a slight difference between Truvelog Mix 30 and the reference 
products in this study. INS-Cmax is governed by the soluble fraction of insulin in Truvelog Mix 30  for which 
similarity was already shown in previous Study PDY12695.

not go beyond value 1. Point estimates for the pairwise treatment ratios for INS-AUC0-4h are higher than the 
respective values for INS-Cmax.  
All 90% CIs of INS-AUC, INS-AUC0-24h, and INS-AUC4-24h included 1. The results for INS-AUC and INS-AUC0-
24h showed that the total exposure of Truvelog Mix 30  and the reference products is similar, and the results

2.5.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
The study PDY15084 was primarily designed as a PK study to demonstrate similarity of the biphasic 
preparation Truvelog Mix 30  with the reference products, NovoLog Mix 70/30, and NovoMix 30. The 
euglycemic clamp technology was used to measure PD effects as secondary objectives.  
As was outlined by the applicant, the study was neither designed nor powered for treatment comparisons in 
PD parameters. The design of this study is described in the pharmacokinetic section. Statistical analyses on 
PD parameters were pre-specified as non-confirmative. 
The following PD parameters were calculated from the GIR assessed during the clamp period, per patient and 
TP as secondary parameters: 
• Cohort 1 
- The area under the body weight standardised GIR time curve from 0 to 24 hours post administration (GIR-
AUC0-24H) 
 - Maximum smoothed body weight standardised GIR (GIRmax) 
- Time to GIRmax (GIR-tmax) 
• Cohort 2 
- The area under the body weight standardised GIR versus time curve from 0 to 4 hours post-administration 
(GIR-AUC0-4H) 
- The area under the body weight standardised GIR versus time curve from 4 to 12 hours post-administration 
(GIR-AUC4-12H) 
- GIRmax 
- GIR-tmax

For cohort 2, GIR-AUC0-24H was derived. 
The derivation of GIRmax, the GIR-tmax and blood glucose levels was based upon a LOESS smoothing 
technique for the raw body weight standardised GIR data - smoothing factor of 15% was used (SAS, PROC 
LOESS, factor 0.15). 
Pharmacodynamic results 
Cohort 1 
The mean smoothed body weight standardised GIR profiles (± SEM) of Truvelog Mix 30 , NovoLog Mix 70/30 
and NovoMix 30 at 0.3 U/kg are shown in figure below. The onset and duration were similar with Truvelog 
Mix 30  reaching slightly lower peak average when compared to the NovoLog Mix 70/30 and NovoMix 30.

Point estimates for treatment ratios for GIRmax and GIR-AUC0-24h, comparing Truvelog Mix 30 to NovoLog Mix 
70/30 and NovoMix 30, and corresponding 95%CIs were calculated by the applicant. 
For GIRmax and GIR-AUC0-24h, the lower 95% confidence limits were ranging between 0.74 and 0.79 and the 
upper limits between 1.00 and 1.12.

Performance of the clamp 
For Cohort 1, the mean and median values for each clamp quality parameter were comparable between 
treatments. The small deviations for mean BG were reflected in median CV% of BG values of 4.40%, 4.50%, 
and 4.00% for T, R1, and R2, respectively, between start and end of euglycaemia. The difference between 
the mean BG and target value (control deviation) was generally small - 0.70, 0.70 and 0.60 mg/dL for T1, R1 
and R2, respectively. The root square mean deviation of BG from clamp target level was 4.87, 4.70 and 4.56 
mg/dL for T, R1 and R2, respectively. 
Overall in Cohort 2, median CV% of BG values were 3.90% and 5.10% for T and R3, respectively. All other 
clamp parameters were comparable between treatments. 
Explorative supplemental statistical PD analyses  
Additional explorative analyses were conducted post-hoc to assess the difference in PD profiles. 
In order to assess the relevance of the differences observed in GIRmax, in Cohort 1 of this study PDY15084, 
two additional PD parameters were derived: 
•  GIR-AUC0-4h  
•  GIR-AUC4-24h   
Based on Cohort 1, when comparing Truvelog Mix 30 with references (R1, R2, R), the lower boundaries of 
95% CIs were between 0.74 and 0.77 for GIRmax (mg/kg/min) and between 0.73 and 0.75 for GIR-AUC0-4h 
(mg/kg) . Upper 95% confidence limits were between 1.00 and 1.07 for GIRmax and between 1.01 and 1.06 
for GIR-AUC0-4h (see table below). 
Based on Cohort 1 when comparing Truvelog Mix 30 with references (R1, R2, R), for GIR-AUC4-24h (mg/kg) 
the point estimates for treatment ratios were close to 1.0, lower 95% confidence bounds are around 0.74 - 
0.78 with upper bounds between 1.24 and 1.30 (Table 12). Nominal p-value for overall treatment effect is 
0.949 for GIR-AUC4-24h.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
PK, PD and initial tolerability of Truvelog Mix 30 compared to NovoLog Mix 70/30 (US reference product), 
NovoMix 30 (EU reference product) and SAR341402 rapid-acting solution were investigated in a single-dose 
euglycemic clamp study in participants with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). It was a randomised, double-
blind cross-over study conducted in 2 cohorts. In general, the study design is adequate and in accordance 
with the Guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal products containing 
recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev 1). According to this 
guideline, in case a biosimilar manufacturer develops different preparations, e.g. short-acting, intermediate 
acting and biphasic preparations containing the same active ingredient, PD data are not needed for all of 
these preparations. This applies to the proposed product, as well. However, any PD data collected during PK 
studies should be presented.   
To avoid any interference with endogenous insulin in PK/PD evaluations, the study was conducted in patients 
with T1DM as most suitable population. The study comprised of 4 treatments and was conducted in 2 cohort 
in order to reduce the burden to study participants implied with repeated lasting euglycemic clamp 
investigation. Cohort 1 was 3-treatments, 3-period and 3-sequence, and Cohort 2 was a 2-treatment, 2-
period, 2-sequence cross-over study. Patients were exposed to each treatment once only. The insulin dose of 
0.3 U/kg selected for this study is well characterised to provide euglycaemia in T1DM patients and has been 
readily investigated in other clamp studies with T1DM patients. Washout period between each IMP 
administration 5 to 18 days is acceptable. 
A specific ultra-performance liquid chromatography method with tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-
MS/MS) and immunoaffinity purification was developed and validated for the analysis of SAR341402 in 
human EDTA K2 plasma. Analysis method for insulin aspart in plasma is adequately validated and was proven 
to be precise, accurate and sensitive over the validated range. Regarding the determination of insulin aspart 
in plasma samples obtained in clinical trial PDY15084, applicant was asked to provide a representative 
number of chromatograms and other raw data covering the whole concentration range for all standard and 
quality control samples and specimen analysed together in the respective run. The submitted data are 
acceptable. 
To analyse anti-SAR341402 antibodies in human K2 EDTA plasma, a validated radioimmunoprecipitation 
assay (RIPA) was used (DOH 1504). A competitive ligand binding assay (CLB) was validated for the 
evaluation of the neutralizing capacity of confirmed positive anti-insulin aspart antibodies in K2 EDTA plasma 
of type 2 and type 1 diabetic participants (DOH1500).  
In the comparison of Truvelog Mix 30 and the EU reference product NovoMix 30, the 90% confidence intervals 
for the primary PK parameters INS-Cmax and INS-AUClast and for secondary parameters INS-AUC, INS-AUC0-24h, 
INS-AUC(0-4h)  and INS-AUC4-24h were within the predefined acceptance limits of 0.80-1.25.  
The standard dosing interval of Truvelog Mix 30  is twice daily, although the optimal administration for some 
patients could be once daily or three times daily as stated in the SmPC. Since the primary endpoint should be 
represented by an AUC of the time of a dosing interval (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev. 1), the 
applicant was also asked to provide calculation for PK parameter INS - AUC0-12H. This exploratory analysis 
confirmed that the 90% CI for the treatment ratios for INS-AUC0-12 of Truvelog Mix 30  vs. NovoMix 30 is 
within the range 0.80 – 1.25, supporting similar exposure for the interval 0-12 h after dosing.

In conclusion the study PDY15084 demonstrated similarity for the primary PK endpoints between Truvelog 
Mix 30  and both reference products, NovoLog Mix 70/30 and NovoMix 30. 
The PD effect of the different insulin aspart formulations was evaluated with the euglycemic clamp technique. 
As was outlined by the applicant, the study was neither designed nor powered for treatment comparisons in 
PD parameters. 
The derivation of GIRmax, the time to GIRmax and blood glucose levels was based upon a LOESS smoothing 
technique for the raw body weight standardised GIR data and smoothing factor of 15% was used. This value 
for smoothing factor has been chosen based on previous experience with a smoothing factor for rapid acting 
insulin. Smoothing factor of 0.15 was expected to lead to interpretable GIRmax and still represent a 
conservative approach for the premix product. 
The proven quality of the glucose clamp method is adequate. 
The 95% confidence interval additionally presented for secondary parameter, GIR-AUC0-24h treatment ratio 
for Truvelog Mix 30  vs NovoMix 30 in Cohort 1 ranged from 0.77 to 1.12 and for GIRmax from 0.75 to 1.07. 
Results of sensitivity analyses including the PD profiles of patients with major deviation were similar to the 
results of the main analysis.

additional explorative statistical analyses were conducted by the applicant post hoc. The 95% CI for partial 
PD parameters - GIR-AUC(0-4h) treatment ratios for Truvelog Mix 30  vs. NovoMix 30 in Cohort 1 ranged from 
0.73 to 1.06 and for GIR-AUC(4-24h) treatment ratios for Truvelog Mix 30  vs. NovoMix 30 in Cohort 1 ranged 
from 0.74 to 1.27. 
The 95% CI for pooled GIRmax was in range 0.77 – 1.08 and the 95% CI for pooled GIR-AUC (0-4h) and GIR-
AUC (4-24h) was in range 0.75 to 1.08 and 0.80 to 1.32 (pooled Truvelog Mix 30  vs. NovoMix 30), 
respectively.  
The presented PD data suggest a difference between Truvelog Mix 30  and the NovoLog Mix 70/30 and 
NovoMix 30.  
Relevance of these clinical findings and consequences of the observed differences in PD endpoints have been 
justified and discussed by the applicant during the procedure. It is agreed that the study PDY15084 
demonstrated similarity of Truvelog Mix 30  to NovoMix 30 for the primary PK endpoints and these results 
were supported by post hoc analysis of the PK parameter INS-AUC0-12. A minor deviation of Truvelog Mix 30  
compared to NovoMix 30 in INS-Cmax (however still within the bioequivalence range) has been amplified in 
PD. The study was not powered to formally demonstrate similarity for PD parameters. The chosen PD 
parameters as secondary parameters were in line with the Guideline on non-clinical and clinical development 
of similar biological medicinal products containing recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev. 1), since the similarity of PK and PD profiles for the soluble-rapid 
acting insulin has been proved.  
PD paramaters GIRmax and GIR-AUC0-4h reflect the rapid-acting component of the premix products. The 
applicant justified the deviation observed for INS-Cmax by the peculiarity of the clamp at the employed low 
dose of rapid acting insulin component (which represents only dose 0.09 U/kg from the whole administered 
dose 0.3 U/kg of the premix formulation), conferring greater variability in PD, rather than by a relevant true 
difference. Frequently used insulin doses in clamp studies are 0.3 to 0.4 U/ kg bodyweight for intermediate-
acting insulins and the doses in the upper range usually produce a more reliable PD response, thereby 
reducing PD variability. The within-subject CV% are estimated for GIRmax and also for GIR-AUC0-4h, as 33.0% 
Assessment report  
EMA/165165/2022 
Page 49/97 
 
 
 
and 35.8% respectively, thus relatively large. This is expected for this premix formulation. Greater variability 
in PK of insulin premixes has been generally observed in comparison to the rapid acting insulins.  
Since the close similarity in physicochemical and functional characteristics has been shown for the Truvelog 
Mix 30  and the reference insulin NovoMix 30, the issue related to the differences shown in PD parameters 
will be not pursued further.  
The PK/PD profiles of Truvelog Mix 30  compared to SAR341402 rapid-acting solution for Cohort 2 showed a 
significant difference in exposure and activity, demonstrated as INS-Cmax, INS-AUC0-4h and INS-AUC4-12h , 
GIRmax, GIR-AUC0-4H, and GIR-AUC4-12H. The treatment effect exceeded the target difference of 20% between 
these 2 formulations as requested by the FDA. The demonstration of >20% difference is not an EU 
requirement and therefore not relevant for the B/R assessment. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In study PDY15084 similarity for the primary PK endpoints was demonstrated between Truvelog Mix 30  and 
both, NovoLog Mix 70/30 and NovoMix 30, with the 90% CIs falling within the predefined acceptance range 
(0.80 to 1.25). The available PD data suggested slight difference between Truvelog Mix 30  and NovoMix 30. 
The relevance of these clinical findings has been discussed by the applicant and justified by greater variability 
in PD and PK of insulin premixes in comparison to the rapid acting insulin, by low dose of rapid acting insulin 
component which represent only dose 0.09 U/kg from the whole administered dose 0.3 U/kg of the premix 
formulation. Moreover the study was not powered to demonstrate the similarity for PD parameters. Since the 
close similarity in physicochemical and functional characteristics has been shown for the Truvelog Mix 30  and 
the reference insulin NovoMix 30 and evaluation of PD parameters are not a strict requirement for a new 
biosimilar insulin formulation containing an active ingredient that is already licensed as part of another 
biosimilar insulin formulation, the issue related to the differences shown in PD parameters will be not pursued 
further. 
2.5.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.5.1.  Main study 
To support the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of proposed biosimilar medicinal product, one Phase 3 
study was submitted: A 26-week, randomised, open-label, parallel-group comparison of Truvelog Mix 30  to 
NovoMix 30 in adult participants with diabetes mellitus using pre-mix insulin analogues (EFC15082).

Figure 7: study design 
Study Participants 
The study included adult participants (males and non-pregnant females) with T1DM or T2DM diagnosed at 
least 12 months before screening, with HbA1c ≤ 10.0% (participants with HbA1c between 9.0% and 10.0% 
can be included if they are not candidates for an MDI regimen based on the discretion of the Investigator), 
body mass index (BMI) ≤ 35kg/m2 for participants with T1DM and ≤ 40 kg/m2 for participants with T2DM, 
treated with at least twice daily NovoMix 30, Humalog Mix 25 or Liprolog Mix 25 for at least 3 months prior to 
the screening visit.  
Among exclusion criteria were any clinically significant abnormality identified either in medical history or 
during screening evaluation (e.g., physical examination, laboratory tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), vital 
signs), pancreatectomy and/or islet cell transplantation, severe renal disease, ALT or AST >3 times upper 
limit of the normal (ULN) or total bilirubin >1.5 times ULN, history of severe hypoglycaemia hospitalisation 
for recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis within 3 months prior to screening, retinopathy or maculopathy. 
Treatments 
Lifestyle and diet recommendations were to be given at screening and during the study in accordance with 
international or local guidelines for participants with T1DM or T2DM.  
As a test medicinal product, Truvelog Mix 30 was used. It was supplied as a 100 U/ml suspension for 
injection supplied in 3 mL pre-filled disposable SoloStar pen. Each pen contains in total 300 units of Truvelog 
Mix 30 (i.e., protamine-crystallised insulin aspart/insulin aspart in the ratio 70/30). This pen allows dose 
setting in the range of 1 to 80 units with minimum of 1-unit increment. 
As a reference/comparator medicinal product, NovoMix 30 (Novo Nordisk) was used. It was supplied as 
a 100 U/ml suspension for injection supplied in 3 mL pre-filled disposable FlexPen pen. Each pen contains in 
Assessment report  
EMA/165165/2022 
Page 51/97 
 
 
 
 
total 300 units of NovoMix 30 (protamine-crystallised insulin aspart/insulin aspart in the ratio 70/30). This 
pen allows dose setting in the range of 1 to 60 units with minimum of 1-unit increment. 
Both medicinal products were self-administered as subcutaneous injection, in the abdominal area, buttock, 
thighs, or upper arms, at least twice a day. The starting dose and frequency of both products was the same 
as the premixed insulin dose (conversion of NovoMix 30 or Humalog Mix 25 or Liprolog Mix 25 dose) on a unit 
to unit (1:1) basis and frequency used at the end of the screening period. The dose of either Truvelog Mix 30  
or NovoMix 30 was to be adjusted approximately once per week or based on Investigator's clinical 
judgement, to achieve a target preprandial plasma glucose between 4.4 and 7.2 mmol/L (80 to 130 mg/dL) 
and a 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose of < 10.0 mmol/L (< 180 mg/dL) while avoiding hypoglycaemia.  
Duration of treatment was per protocol up to 26 weeks.  
No non-investigational medicinal products were planned to be used in this study. 
Objectives 
Primary objective of the study: To demonstrate non-inferiority of Truvelog Mix 30 in comparison to NovoMix 
30 on HbA1c change from baseline to Week 26 in participants with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and Type 
2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A non-inferiority margin of 0.3% HbA1c was defined, in line with 
recommendations by regulatory agencies and based on historical precedent for comparative insulin studies in 
which a 0.3% non-inferiority margin is often used. 
Secondary objective: To compare the effects of Truvelog Mix 30 with NovoMix 30 on immunogenicity 
parameters in participants with T1DM and T2DM and evaluate the safety of Truvelog Mix 30  and NovoMix 30. 
Tertiary/exploratory objectives: To compare the effect of Truvelog Mix 30  and NovoMix 30 on glycaemic 
control and insulin dose, and to compare clinical effects of immunogenicity parameters on glycaemic control, 
insulin dose and safety. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy endpoints:  
• 
• 
Primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 26 in HbA1c (In addition, if non-inferiority of 
Truvelog Mix 30  over NovoMix 30 was demonstrated, the inverse noninferiority of NovoMix 30 over 
Truvelog Mix 30 was also to be tested as a secondary analysis to further support similarity between 
Truvelog Mix 30 and NovoMix 30.) 
Tertiary/exploratory efficacy endpoints were number of participants with HbA1c < 7.0% at Week 26, 
change from baseline to Week 26 in FPG, change from baseline to Week 26 in mean 24-hour SMPG 
(7-point profile), change from baseline to Week 26 in plasma glucose excursions (2 hour PPG minus 
pre-prandial plasma glucose) at breakfast, lunch and dinner based on 7 point SMPG data, change 
from baseline to Week 26 in 7 point SMPG profile, change from baseline to Week 26 in daily insulin 
dose (Truvelog Mix 30 or NovoMix 30). 
Safety endpoints were set as secondary endpoints, and were as follows: number of participants with at least 
one hypoglycaemic event, number of hypoglycaemic events per participant-year, number of participants with 
adverse events (AEs). 
Assessment report  
EMA/165165/2022 
Page 52/97 
 
 
 
Immunogenicity secondary endpoint was number of participants with treatment-emergent AIA during the 26-
week treatment period.  
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
All participants were centrally assigned to randomised study treatment (Truvelog Mix 30 or NovoMix 30, in a 
1:1 ratio) using an interactive response technology (IRT) system. Randomisation was stratified by type of 
diabetes (T1DM; T2DM), prior use of NovoMix 30 (Yes; No), geographical region (Indian; non-Indian) and 
HbA1c obtained at the screening visit (< 8.0%; ≥ 8.0%).  
The study was open-label, as the SoloStar pen used for Truvelog Mix 30 and FlexPen used for NovoMix 30 are 
distinguishable. Although this was an open-label study, the Sponsor study team remained blinded to the 
treatment group until database lock. HbA1c, FPG, and AIAs were determined in central laboratories blinded to 
the treatment received. Selected AEs were adjudicated in a blinded fashion. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy endpoint was analysed in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (defined as all randomised 
participants, irrespective of compliance with the study protocol and procedures), using all post-baseline data 
available from randomisation up to Week 26 regardless of study treatment discontinuation (ITT estimand 
with treatment policy strategy). Participants were analysed in the treatment group to which they were 
randomised. The statistical test for non-inferiority assessment of Truvelog Mix 30 versus NovoMix 30 on the 
primary efficacy endpoint (change from baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c) was one-sided, with alpha level of 
0.025 and using a non-inferiority margin of 0.3% HbA1c. 
In order to account for missing data, multiple imputations were performed with a 'return to baseline' analysis 
(missing HbA1c values at Week 26 imputed as equal to the participant baseline plus an error). Imputed 
datasets were analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of the change from baseline to Week 26 in 
HbA1c, including the fixed categorical effects of treatment group (Truvelog Mix 30 , NovoMix 30) and 
randomisation strata of type of diabetes (T1DM, T2DM), geographical region (Indian, non-Indian), and prior 
use of NovoMix 30 (Yes, No), as well as the continuous fixed covariate of baseline HbA1c value. Results were 
combined using Rubin's formula. 
In order to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the primary analysis results, a prespecified sensitivity analysis 
was performed with HbA1c values potentially impacted by COVID-19 treated as missing values, and all 
missing data due to COVID-19 imputed using a missing at random (MAR) approach.  
A supportive analysis was conducted on the PP population to evaluate the robustness of the primary efficacy 
analysis after excluding participants that could significantly impact the analysis, including some participants 
with major or critical protocol deviations related to COVID-19. 
Safety analysis and analysis of immunogenicity data were descriptive.

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 402 adult participants (Truvelog Mix 30 : 204; NovoMix 30: 198) were randomised in the study, all 
of whom were included in the ITT population. Two participants, 1 in each group, were randomised but not 
treated.  
Approximately 20% of participants (42 participants in each group) were excluded from the PP population. 
Reasons for excluding participants from the PP population were mostly related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Reasons not related to the COVID-19 pandemic were reported similarly in the 2 groups (10 participants in 
each group) and mostly corresponded to missing HbA1c value from central laboratory at Week 26 or 
premature IMP discontinuation. The vast majority of the participants completed the treatment period similarly 
in the 2 treatment groups.  
Figure 8: Participant disposition 
No critical protocol deviations were reported in this study. The proportion of participants with any major 
protocol deviation was balanced between treatment groups (130 [63.7%] participants in the Truvelog Mix 30 
group and 119 [60.1%] in the NovoMix 30 group), with no apparent distribution pattern. Around 40% of 
major protocol deviations were not related to COVID-19 in both treatment groups. Overall, the most 
frequently reported major protocol deviations were related to assessments/procedures not performed, i.e., 
"planned sample (anti- Truvelog Mix 30 /NovoMix 30 antibodies) not performed" (Truvelog Mix 30 : 65

[31.9%] participants; and NovoMix 30: 51 [25.8%] participants), mainly due to haemolysed or lipaemic 
immunogenicity samples that could not be analysed at the laboratory; "planned sample (haematology or 
clinical chemistry) not performed" (Truvelog Mix 30 : 61 [29.9%] participants; and NovoMix 30: 50 [25.3%] 
participants); and "planned sample (HbA1c) not performed" (Truvelog Mix 30 : 40 [19.6%] participants; and 
NovoMix 30: 28 [14.1%] participants).  
Baseline data 
The majority of participants were Asian (from India – 52.2% and Philippines – 8.7%) and the rest of the 
participants were white (from Eastern Europe – 39.1%).  
All demographics and baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the treatment groups.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c. A non-inferiority margin 
was set to 0.3% change in HbA1c. 
The mean HbA1c at baseline was comparable in the 2 treatment groups. Similar decreases from baseline to 
Week 26 in HbA1c were seen in the 2 treatment groups with mean change (SE) of -0.55% (0.080) in the 
Truvelog Mix 30 group and -0.64% (0.080) in the NovoMix 30 group. However, the prespecified non-
inferiority margin was not met (see table below).

to baseline multiple imputation) - ITT population.

Figure 9: - HbA1c (%) - Mean (+/- SE) by visit during the randomisation period – ITT population 
A post-hoc sensitivity analysis was performed on the ITT population excluding one participant in the Truvelog 
Mix 30 group. This participant had an extreme outlying increase in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26 of 5.9%, 
which was almost twice the value of the next highest value (3.0%) observed in the Truvelog Mix 30 group; 
an HbA1c value of 7.1% at screening (defined as baseline since the HbA1c sample at baseline visit was drawn 
5 minutes after the first IMP dose) and 13.0% at Week 26. Further investigation showed that that due to 
COVID-19 lockdown, applicant´s IMP expired and participant did not took the product according to the 
protocol, therefore the increase in HbA1c occurred at 26 weeks visit. With the exclusion of this participant 
with extreme outlying value from the ITT population, noninferiority of Truvelog Mix 30 compared to NovoMix 
30 on change from baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c was achieved (see table below). Inverse non-inferiority of 
NovoMix 30 over Truvelog Mix 30 was also achieved.

Table 18: Summary of change from baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c (%) using ANCOVA analysis (with return 
to baseline multiple imputation) - ITT population excluding one participant. 
Sensitivity analysis – impact of the COVID-19 pandemic 
A sensitivity analysis was conducted on the ITT population to evaluate the COVID-19 impact on the primary 
efficacy analysis. HbA1c values potentially impacted by COVID-19 (as described above) were treated as 
missing values and all missing data due to COVID-19 were imputed using a MAR approach. This included the 
Week 26 value of the participant with extreme outlying value, which was treated as missing in this sensitivity 
analysis due to Visit 8 delay >8 weeks.  
Non-inferiority of Truvelog Mix 30 compared to NovoMix 30 on change from baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c 
was achieved - the difference between Truvelog Mix 30 and NovoMix 30 was 0.05% (SE: 0.102; 95% CI = -
0,149 to 0.253).  
Supportive analysis 
A supportive analysis was conducted on the PP population to evaluate the robustness of the conclusion of the 
primary efficacy analysis when excluding the participants that may have increased the chance of reaching the 
non-inferiority conclusion. In the PP population, non-inferiority of Truvelog Mix 30 compared to NovoMix 30 
on change from baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c was achieved (LS Mean difference [SE] of Truvelog Mix 30 
versus NovoMix 30: 0.07% [0.102]; and 95% CI: -0.131 to 0.269). 
Tertiary/exploratory efficacy endpoints 
Tertiary/exploratory efficacy endpoints included the percentage of participants who reached the HbA1c target 
<7% at Week 26, change from baseline to Week 26 in FPG, change from baseline to Week 26 in mean 24-
hour SMPG, seven-point SMPG profile, change in plasma glucose excursion. No clinically relevant differences 
were observed between the Truvelog Mix 30 and NovoMix 30.

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analysis 
Subgroup analyses of the change from baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c were performed on the ITT population. 
The mean change from baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c for Truvelog Mix 30 versus NovoMix 30 was generally 
consistent across other subgroups defined by screening and baseline factors (race, age group, sex, baseline 
BMI, baseline eGFR, randomisation stratum of screening HbA1c, and duration of diabetes).

Change in HbA1c by treatment-emergent anti-insulin aspart antibody 
Change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26 was similar between treatment groups in both subgroups of 
participants, those with treatment-emergent AIA and those without treatment-emergent AIAs. The 
treatment-by-treatment-emergent AIA interaction showed no evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effect 
across subgroups of AIA status (p=0.4516).

Assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the trial 
Study EFC15082 was ongoing when the COVID-19 pandemic occurred; the main study was fully enrolled, but 
the majority of the participants were being treated in the study. The pandemic disruption resulted in the 
temporary closure of some sites (i.e., planned visits could not be performed), mainly in India and the 
Assessment report

Page 64/97 
 
 
 
 
 
Philippines. Alternative methods in the conduct of the trial were implemented, such as over-the phone or at 
home visits, alternative methods of IMP dispensation, extension of the duration of the study in order to 
perform end-of-treatment visit.  
The percentage of participants with trial impact (disruption) due to the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., with major 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on study conduct) was similar between treatment groups (Truvelog Mix 30 
: 42.6% [87/204]; NovoMix 30: 36.9% [73/198]).  
Table 20: Participant disposition – Participants with or without trial impact due to COVID-19 – Randomised 
population. 
No impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on baseline and Week 4 visits was reported. Impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic was mainly observed on the Week 26 visit. This visit was impacted in almost half of the 
participants, similarly in the 2 groups (Truvelog Mix 30 : 45.5% [92/202]; NovoMix 30: 43.3% [84/194]). 
Most of these participants completed Week 26 but the visit was delayed. 
Daily insulin doses were similar in the 2 treatment groups, regardless of trial impact (disruption) due to 
COVID-19. At Week 26, in the NovoMix 30 group, the increase from baseline in daily insulin doses was higher 
in participants for whom there was an impact of COVID-19 on the trial (0.313 U/kg) as compared to those for 
whom there was no impact (0.156 U/kg), but this difference was not observed in the Truvelog Mix 30 group 
and was not clinically relevant.

2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In the efficacy part of the dossier, applicant aims to prove the biosimilarity between test product Truvelog 
Mix 30  and reference product NovoMix 30. To do this, one phase 3 study was submitted (EFC15082). 
According to the guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal products 
containing recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_rev.1), in case 
of insulin biosimilar preparation, there is no need for specific efficacy studies since HbA1c endpoint is not 
considered sensitive enough to detect potentially clinically relevant differences between two insulins. 
Therefore, this study is considered as supportive only to the PK/PD study. However, since the secondary 
objective is to compare the effects of Truvelog Mix 30 with NovoMix 30 on immunogenicity parameters and 
compare safety between these products in participants with T1DM and T2DM, the results of this study are 
useful to prove the biosimilarity in terms of safety data.  
Study EFC15082 was a 26-week, randomised, open-label, parallel-group comparison of Truvelog Mix 30  to 
NovoMix 30 in adult participants with diabetes mellitus using pre-mix insulin analogues. Study included adult 
participants (males and non-pregnant females) with T1DM or T2DM diagnosed at least 12 months before 
screening, with HbA1c ≤ 10.0%, treated with at least twice daily NovoMix 30, Humalog Mix 25 or Liprolog Mix 
25 for at least 3 months prior to the screening visit. 25% of patients included were patients with Type 1 
diabetes. As mixed insulins are most often used by T2DM patients, the majority of patients included had 
T2DM. In general, inclusion and exclusion criteria are acceptable.  
The design of the study is appropriate to meet the objectives set in the study. The duration (26 weeks) of 
IMP administration is adequate and in line with the EMA guideline, as the anti-drug antibodies in insulin-
treated patients are expected to develop early-on. The dosing was based on usual dosing of reference 
medicinal product. Open label design of the study is acceptable in this case, as the efficacy results with 
HbA1c endpoint are supportive only, and the major focus of this clinical trial is on immunogenicity, which can 
still be appropriately evaluated if the antibody determination is performed in a blinded manner. In this case, 
Assessment report  
EMA/165165/2022 
Page 70/97 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HbA1c (for the primary efficacy endpoint analysis), FPG, and immunogenicity parameters were measured 
centrally, blinded to the treatment received.  
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate non-inferiority of Truvelog Mix 30  in comparison to 
NovoMix 30 on HbA1c change from baseline to Week 26 in participants with T1DM and T2DM. A non-
inferiority margin of 0.3% HbA1c was defined, in line with recommendations of regulatory agencies and 
based on historical precedent for comparative insulin studies in which a 0.3% non-inferiority margin is often 
used. The secondary objective was to compare the safety and immunogenicity parameters between two 
mixed insulin products. Tertiary/exploratory objectives were to compare the effect of both insulins on 
glycaemic control and insulin dose, and to compare clinical effects of immunogenicity parameters on 
glycaemic control, insulin dose and safety. 
The statistical test for the primary efficacy endpoint was one-sided, with alpha level of 0.025 and using a 
non-inferiority margin of 0.3% HbA1c. The primary endpoint was analysed in the ITT population. A multiple 
imputation approach for missing data was used with a 'return to baseline' analysis. Imputed datasets were 
analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of the change from baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c, 
including the fixed categorical effects of treatment group (Truvelog Mix 30 , NovoMix 30) and randomisation 
strata of geographical region (Indian, non-Indian), type of diabetes (T1DM, T2DM) and prior use of NovoMix 
30 (Yes, No), as well as the continuous fixed covariate of baseline HbA1c value. Sensitivity analyses were 
defined to support the primary analysis. The methods are considered standard and acceptable. 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic during the treatment-on period of the study, a prespecified sensitivity 
analysis was performed. HbA1c values potentially impacted by COVID-19 were treated as missing values, and 
all missing data due to COVID-19 was imputed using a missing at random approach. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The percentage of patients completing the treatment period were comparable in both treatment arms. 
Approximately 20% patients (42 participants in each group) were excluded from the PP population due to 
COVID-19 pandemic, sensitivity analysis assessing this issue was planned in the statistical analysis. Reasons 
for exclusion from PP due to other reasons than COVID-19 were reported similarly in both groups. Amount of 
patients discontinuing treatment were comparable (3 for test product vs. 6 for reference). No participants 
discontinued treatment due to lack of efficacy or hypoglycaemia. 
No critical protocol deviations were reported in this study. The proportion of participants with any major 
protocol deviation was balanced between treatment groups (130 [63.7%] participants in the Truvelog Mix 30 
group and 119 [60.1%] in the NovoMix 30 group), with no apparent distribution pattern. Around 40% of 
major protocol deviations were not related to COVID-19 in both treatment groups. In general, protocol 
deviations observed do not differ significantly between different treatment arms and were not considered 
critical. 
The majority of participants were Asian (India – 52.2% and Philippines – 8.7%) and the rest of the 
participants were Caucasian (Eastern Europe – 39.1%). A minimum of 25 % of patients had T1DM, which is 
sufficiently representative. The distribution of men and women differed between treatment arms. In the 
Truvelog Mix 30 arm, 55% were men and 45 % were women, whereas in the Novomix 30 arm, 55% were 
women and 45% were men. Furthermore, a larger proportion had a BMI above 25 in the Novomix 30 arm 
compared to the Truvelog Mix 30 arm. There was a numerically higher increase in daily insulin dose in the 
NovoMix 30 arm (0.166 U/kg) than the Truvelog Mix 30 30 arm (0.278 U/kg), however the difference 
Assessment report  
EMA/165165/2022 
Page 71/97 
 
 
 
between treatment arms was small and is not considered clinically relevant. Besides the above differences, 
demographic and disease characteristics are well-balanced in both treatment groups. Study population 
recruited reflects intended population.  
The primary endpoint, change from baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c implementing the non-inferiority margin of 
0.3 HbA1c, was not met for Truvelog Mix 30 compared to NovoMix 30 in the ITT population. The LS mean 
difference between Truvelog Mix 30  and NovoMix 30 was 0.08 (95% CI: 0.139 to 0.303).  
According to the applicant, this result was primarily driven by 1 participant with T2DM in the Truvelog Mix 30  
group. In a post-hoc sensitivity analysis performed on the ITT population excluding this Participant in the 
Truvelog Mix 30 group, the upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the difference between Truvelog Mix 30 
and NovoMix 30 was below the predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.3% (LS mean difference of -0.05% 
[95%CI: -0.158 to 0.266]). After exclusion of this patient, inverse non-inferiority of NovoMix 30 over 
Truvelog Mix 30 was also achieved. The excluded participant had an extreme outlying increase in HbA1c from 
baseline to Week 26 of 5.9%. The investigation revealed, that due to COVID-19 lockdown, applicant´s IMP 
expired and participant did not take the product according to the protocol, therefore the increase in HbA1c 
occurred at 26-week visit. Analysis of the complete ITT population is a golden standard in clinical trials. Post 
hoc analyses not predefined in the study protocol should not be acceptable. However, in this case HbA1c 
results are not a requirement for authorisation and therefore, the applicant´s justification can be accepted 
and this issue will not be pursued further. In a sensitivity analysis studying impact of COVID-19 on efficacy 
endpoint, non-inferiority of Truvelog Mix 30  compared to NovoMix 30 on change from baseline to Week 26 in 
HbA1c was achieved. The same results were observed in PP analysis. 
In general, the presented primary efficacy endpoints need to be regarded as supportive only. According to 
the guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal products containing 
recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_rev.1), HbA1c is not 
considered sensitive enough to detect potentially clinically relevant differences between two insulins. 
Considering the quality major objection questioning analytical similarity and the observed PD differences, it is 
not possible to make any conclusions regarding biosimilarity. This uncertainty cannot be remedied by the 
efficacy results of the study EFC15082.  
Tertiary endpoint, the percentage of participants who reached the HbA1c target <7% at Week 26, was similar 
in the 2 treatment groups – 28.4% in Truvelog Mix 30 group and 31.3% in NovoMix 30 group, with odds ratio 
0.824 (95% CI = 0.527 to 1.290). From baseline to week 26, the decrease in FPG was -0.27 mmol/L in the 
Truvelog Mix 30  group and -1.01 mmol/L in the NovoMix 30 group (LS mean difference of 0.75 [95%CI:-
0.068 to 1.563]). Even if there is a numerical difference between the groups, it can be accepted, as the 95% 
CI crosses one. Furthermore, the proposed endpoints are not sensitive enough to detect potentially clinically 
relevant difference in the efficacy study setting. Similar numerical difference was also present for the change 
from baseline to Week 26 in mean 24-hour SMPG and when change from baseline to Week 26 in plasma 
glucose excursion (mmol/L) at breakfast, lunch and dinner was assessed. Graphical presentation of the 7-
point SMPG profiles showed similarity in the 2 treatment groups. 
Subgroup analysis with regard to age, race, sex, baseline BMI, baseline eGFR, randomisation stratum of 
screening HbA1c and duration of diabetes showed in general consistent results in all the subgroups. No 
evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effect across subgroups was shown as indicated by the p-values 
above 0.10 for treatment-by-subgroup interactions except for the subgroup defined by duration of diabetes. 
Subgroup analysis presented by the applicant were sufficient.

Page 72/97 
 
 
 
When assessing the change in HbA1c by treatment-emergent anti-insulin aspart antibodies, the results 
suggest similar efficacy of Truvelog Mix 30 and NovoMix 30, regardless of the treatment-emergent AIA 
status.  
Additionally, based on the submitted data, it is not probable that the results were affected by the COVID-19 
pandemic. 
2.5.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The primary endpoint of the phase 3 study (EFC15082) did not meet the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 
HbA1c change in the ITT population when comparing Truvelog Mix 30 and NovoMix 30. However, non-
inferiority was missed by a very small margin and after exclusion of 1 patient, primary endpoint was met. 
Although this can be attributed to an unforeseen event, i.e. the respective patient experienced a substantial 
increase in HbA1c due to running out of study medicinal product during the pandemic, post hoc analyses not 
predefined in the study protocol should not be acceptable. However, in this case HbA1c results are not a 
requirement for authorisation and therefore, the applicant´s justification can be accepted and this issue will 
not be pursued further. The submitted phase 3 study (EFC15082) provides only supportive evidence with 
respect to the biosimilarity of Truvelog Mix 30 and NovoMix 30. Nevertheless, immunogenicity and safety 
data from this study are pertinent to the safety comparison. 
2.5.8.  Clinical safety 
As of the dossier cut-off date (06 November 2020), the clinical development programme of the Truvelog Mix 
30  included 2 completed studies (PDY15084 and EFC15082). The two studies PDY15084 and EFC15082 were 
not pooled due to differences in study designs. 
In the phase 3 study EFC15082, safety population consisted of 400 patients, compared to the PK/PD study 
PDY15084 where only 52 participants were enrolled. Therefore, the majority of the safety data comes from 
phase 3 study. 
Patient exposure 
The cumulative duration of treatment exposure was 108.35 participant-years in the Truvelog Mix 30 group 
and 104.96 participant-years in the NovoMix 30 group. The median duration of exposure was similar in both 
treatment groups (183 days for Truvelog Mix 30 and 184 days for NovoMix 30). The majority of participants 
in each treatment group were exposed to IMP for more than 25 weeks (Truvelog Mix 30 : 194 [95.6%]; and 
NovoMix 30: 189 [95.9%]). 
Adverse events 
Summary of adverse events 
The percentage of participants experiencing TEAEs or serious TEAEs during the on-treatment period was 
similar in the Truvelog Mix 30 group and the NovoMix 30 group (see table below). There were no TEAEs 
leading to permanent treatment discontinuation reported in this study. During the on-treatment period, 1 
participant in the NovoMix 30 group had a treatment-emergent SAE resulting in death.

Table 22: Overview of adverse event profile: Treatment-emergent adverse events by type of diabetes and 
overall during the on-treatment period - Safety population. 
Treatment emergent adverse events 
The overall incidence of TEAEs was similar between treatment groups (Truvelog Mix 30 : 17.7%; NovoMix 
30: 20.8%, see table below). The most frequently reported TEAEs in either treatment group by primary SOC 
were Infections and Infestations (Truvelog Mix 30 : 6.9% [14 participants]; NovoMix 30 group 11.7% [23 
participants]). Treatment-emergent AEs in the other SOCs were reported in less than 3% of participants, 
regardless of the treatment group. 
At the PT level, the most frequently reported TEAEs in either treatment group were nasopharyngitis (Truvelog 
Mix 30 : 1.5%; and NovoMix 30: 3.6%) and upper respiratory tract infection (Truvelog Mix 30 : 1.5%; and 
NovoMix 30: 2.0%). All other TEAEs were reported in less than 2.0% of participants regardless of treatment 
group. 
No TEAEs in either treatment group were considered as related to IMP by the Investigator. Treatment-
emergent AEs were mainly of mild to moderate intensity in both the treatment groups.

Impact of COVID-19 pandemic 
No TEAEs were reported as related to COVID-19 (i.e., no COVID-19 illness) in either treatment group. The 
incidence of TEAEs was similar in the 2 treatment groups, regardless of trial impact (disruption) due to 
COVID-19.  
In participants with trial impact (disruption) due to COVID-19, the incidence of any TEAEs was numerically 
lower in the Truvelog Mix 30 group (12/87 [13.8%] participants) compared to the NovoMix 30 group (16/73 
[21.9%] participants) but the difference was small (4 participants). The most frequently reported TEAE in 
either treatment group by primary SOC was Infections and Infestations (Truvelog Mix 30 group: 2 [2.3%] 
participants; NovoMix 30 group: 7 [9.6%] participants) and General Disorders and Administration Site 
Conditions (Truvelog Mix 30 : 2 [2.3%] participants; and NovoMix 30: 3 [4.1%] participants).  
Adverse events of specific interest 
Hypoglycaemia 
During the on-treatment period, 62.1% participants in the Truvelog Mix 30 group and 70.1% participants in 
the NovoMix 30 group had at least one event of “any” hypoglycaemia.  
Table 24: Number (%) of participants with at least one hypoglycaemia by type of diabetes and overall

The total number of hypoglycaemia events per participant-year was 1381 in the Truvelog Mix 30 group and 
1424 in the NovoMix 30 group. The rate of “any” hypoglycaemia was similar in the 2 treatment groups 
(Truvelog Mix 30 : 12.62 events per participant-year of exposure; NovoMix 30: 13.43 events per participant-
year of exposure). The rate ratio of Truvelog Mix 30 versus NovoMix 30 for ‘any’ hypoglycaemia was 0.91 
(95% CI: 0.68 to 1.22).

In the overall safety population, the number of hypoglycaemia events and event rates per participant-year of 
exposure were similar between the 2 treatment groups for all categories, except for documented 
symptomatic hypoglycaemia (<3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) with values numerically higher in the Truvelog Mix 30 
group (283 [2.59]) compared to the NovoMix 30 group (144 [1.36]). This numerical difference between 
treatment groups was driven by 6 participants in the Truvelog Mix 30 group (5 with T1DM and 1 with T2DM, 
each reporting ≥20 events) who reported in total 155 out of 283 hypoglycaemia events in this category; 
while no participant reported more than 13 events in the NovoMix 30 group. In most of these participants, 
the daily insulin dose remained unchanged throughout the study, only one participant had insulin dose 
adjustment following repeated hypoglycaemia episodes. None of these hypoglycaemia events were 
accompanied by neuroglycopenic symptoms or met otherwise serious AE criteria.  Out of the 155 
documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia events (<3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL)) reported by the 5 participants 
with T1DM, 139 showed evidence of at least one precipitating factor i.e., missed, delayed or smaller meal 
and/or physical activity among those detailed above. No relationship between race, age group, sex, baseline 
BMI, baseline eGFR, screening HbA1c, prior use of NovoMix 30, geographical region or duration of diabetes 
and the number of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia events was found in the 5 participants with 
T1DM. These participants were counselled and had no insulin dose adjustment as planned per protocol. Post-
hoc sensitivity analyses excluding these 6 participants showed similar results between treatment groups for 
number of events and event rates per participant-year of exposure across all hypoglycaemia categories, 
including documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (<3.0 mmol/L [54 mg/dL]).  
The rate ratio for Truvelog Mix 30 versus NovoMix 30 was close to 1 for all categories of hypoglycaemia, 
except for documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia <3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL; see figure below). After 
excluding the 6 participants in the Truvelog Mix 30 group who reported ≥20 hypoglycaemia events each, the 
rate ratio for Truvelog Mix 30 versus NovoMix 30 was close to 1 for all categories of hypoglycaemia, including 
documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (<3.0 mmol/L [54 mg/dL]; rate ratio=0.92; 95% CI: 0.58 to 1.47).

Distribution of hypoglycaemia events was comparable over the 24-hour day in both treatment groups.  
In both treatment groups, the majority of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia ≤3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) 
occurred around noon and around dinner/bedtime and the time of the day with the lowest percentage of 
participants reporting at least one event was between 16:00 and 18:00.

Submitted subgroup analysis concerning hypoglycaemia by type of diabetes showed some numerical 
differences in the incidence of hypoglycaemia between the 2 treatment groups; however, no consistent trend 
was observed across hypoglycaemia categories in participants with T2DM or T1DM. The odds ratio of Truvelog 
Assessment report

Mix 30 versus NovoMix 30 was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.36 to 1.23) for participants with T2DM and 1.65 (95% CI: 
0.75 to 3.64) for participants with T1DM. 
Subgroup analysis according to prior use of NovoMix 30 did not shown any clinically relevant difference 
between the two treatment groups.  
The incidence of hypoglycaemia across the remaining subgroups by intrinsic and baseline factors (i.e., race, 
age group, sex, baseline BMI, baseline eGFR, screening HbA1c [<8.0%, ≥8.0%] and duration of diabetes) 
were generally consistent with the overall population for most categories of hypoglycaemia.  
Subgroup analysis assessing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic of hypoglycaemia showed that the 
percentages of participants who reported at least one hypoglycaemia (“any” hypoglycaemia) was similar in 
the 2 treatment groups, regardless of COVID-19 impact. For all categories of hypoglycaemia, no noteworthy 
differences between treatment groups were observed and p-value of treatment-by-subgroup interaction 
showed no evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effect across subgroups. In general, the number of 
hypoglycaemia events and event rates per participant-year were lower in participants with trial impact 
compared to those without trial impact; for ‘any’ hypoglycaemia, the number of events and event rates were 
343 (6.85) in the Truvelog Mix 30 group and 270 (6.37) in the NovoMix 30 group for those with trial impact, 
versus 1038 (17.47) and 1154 (18.14) for those participants without trial impact. Results of the 
hypoglycaemia analyses suggested that trial disruption due to COVID-19 resulted in underreporting of 
hypoglycaemia events similarly in both treatment groups; therefore, no impact is expected on the between-
group comparison and the overall hypoglycaemia conclusions. 
Injection site reaction 
No injection site reactions were reported.  
Hypersensitivity reactions 
During the on-treatment period of study EFC15082, 1 participant with T2DM in the Truvelog Mix 30 group 
reported a TEAE of hypersensitivity reaction (PT: Pruritus). The event was mild in severity, non-serious, 
resolved without sequelae, and did not result in permanent treatment discontinuation. The Investigator 
considered the event as not related to IMP. No hypersensitivity reactions were reported in the NovoMix 30 
group. 
Alanine aminotransferase increase 
In study EFC15082, one participant in the Truvelog Mix 30 group reported an ALT-related TEAE (PT: ALT 
increased). This non-serious event did not lead to permanent treatment discontinuation and was considered 
as not related to IMP by the Investigator.

Serious adverse events Serious adverse events and deaths 
During the on-treatment period, serious TEAEs (regardless of relationship) were reported by a low and similar 
percentage of participants in the Truvelog Mix 30 group (2 [1.0%]) and the NovoMix 30 group (3 [1.5%]). At 
a PT level, no treatment-emergent SAEs occurred in more than 1 participant in either treatment group. No 
serious TEAEs of hypoglycaemia were reported in either treatment group during the on-treatment period. No 
serious TEAEs were considered as related to IMP by the Investigator in either treatment group.  
Table 26: Number (%) of participants with treatment-emergent SAEs regardless of relationship and related 
to IMP by Primary SOC and PT during the on-treatment period - Safety population. 
Deaths 
During the study, a total of 2 deaths were reported in the NovoMix 30 group: one occurred during on-
treatment period (PT: sudden cardiac death) and the other occurred during post-treatment period (PT: 
Hanging). No death case was reported in the Truvelog Mix 30 group. None of the events leading to death 
were considered related to the IMP by the Investigator.  
Laboratory findings 
There were no relevant mean changes from baseline to Week 26 in either treatment group for any 
hematologic laboratory parameter (haemoglobin, haematocrits, erythrocytes, platelets, leukocytes, 
neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes), any clinical laboratory parameters (lipid 
parameters, liver and renal parameters, and electrolytes), any serum lipid parameters (cholesterol and 
triglycerides), electrolytes (sodium and potassium), any of the renal function parameters (creatinine and 
eGFR [MDRD]), any of the hepatic function parameters (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin).

Safety in special populations 
Type of DM 
There was no differential treatment effect on the incidence and pattern of TEAEs across subgroups defined by 
type of diabetes. In T1DM, the incidence of TEAEs was 17.0% (9/53 participants) for Truvelog Mix 30 and 
17.6% (9/51 participants) for NovoMix 30. In T2DM, the incidence of TEAEs was 18.0% (27/150 participants) 
for Truvelog Mix 30 and 21.9% (32/146 participants) for NovoMix 30. Consistent with the overall population, 
the most frequently reported TEAEs at the primary SOC level in participants with T1DM or T2DM were 
Infections and Infestations, similarly in both treatment groups. 
No evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effect across subgroups was observed (as indicated by the p-value 
above 0.10 for treatment-by-subgroup interaction), except for documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia 
(<3.0 mmol/L [54 mg/dL]), with a p-value of 0.0750; the odds ratio of Truvelog Mix 30 versus NovoMix 30 
was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.36 to 1.23) for participants with T2DM and 1.65 (95% CI: 0.75 to 3.64) for participants 
with T1DM. 
Prior use of NovoMix 30 
Subgroup analysis by randomisation stratum of prior use of NovoMix 30 showed that the incidence of TEAEs 
was similar in participants switching from commercial NovoMix 30 to Truvelog Mix 30 at randomisation 
compared with participants continuing with NovoMix 30 (Truvelog Mix 30 : 18.6% [32/172 participants]; and 
NovoMix 30 group: 22.0% [37/168 participants]); and also similar between those without prior use of 
NovoMix 30 (Truvelog Mix 30 : 12.9% [4/31 participants]; and NovoMix 30 group: 13.8% [4/29 
participants]). Consistent with the overall population, the most frequently reported TEAEs at the primary SOC 
level in participants with or without prior use of NovoMix 30 were Infections and Infestations, similarly in both 
treatment groups. 
Other subgroups 
The frequency of TEAEs was overall similar between Truvelog Mix 30 and NovoMix 30 in the other subgroups 
defined by screening and baseline factors (including race, age group, sex, baseline BMI, baseline eGFR, 
duration of diabetes, and randomisation stratum of HbA1c at screening). There were limited number of 
participants in certain categories of subgroups (i.e., age groups ≥65 to <75 and ≥75 years, baseline BMI 
≥30 kg/m², and baseline eGFR category <60 mL/min/1.73 m²). 
Immunological events 
On-treatment anti-insulin aspart antibody response 
Among participants with available AIA sample at baseline, similar percentages of participants in the 2 
treatment groups had detectable AIAs at baseline (Truvelog Mix 30 : 49.2% [91/185 participants]; NovoMix 
30: 54.0% [95/176 participants]; see table below). 
The percentage of participants with a treatment-emergent AIA response (i.e., treatment-boosted or 
treatment-induced AIAs) during the 26-week on-treatment period was similar between Truvelog Mix 30 
(33.2% [66/199 participants]) and NovoMix 30 (31.8% [62/195 participants]). The risk difference between 
Truvelog Mix 30 and NovoMix 30 for the percentage of participants with treatment-emergent AIAs was 1.7% 
(90% CI: -5.90 to 9.22). Similar percentages of participants in the Truvelog Mix 30 group (70.4% [140/199]) 
Assessment report  
EMA/165165/2022 
Page 85/97 
 
 
 
and in the NovoMix 30 group (71.8% [140/195]) were positive for AIA at least at one time-point between 
baseline and Week 26. 
The kinetics of the AIA response, in terms of duration of the AIA response (transient or persistent), were 
generally comparable in the 2 treatment groups. Among participants with treatment-boosted AIA, a 
persistent response was found in 17.6% of participants in the Truvelog Mix 30 group and 29.4% of 
participants in the NovoMix 30 group. Among participants with treatment-induced AIA, a persistent response 
was found in 20.4% of participants in the Truvelog Mix 30 group and 26.7% of participants in the NovoMix 30 
group. 
Table 27: Summary of AIA response during the on-treatment period - AIA population. 
In the overall AIA population (i.e., including participants with missing AIA sample at baseline), the 
percentage of participants with positive AIA sample at baseline was similar in the 2 treatment groups (45.7% 
of participants in the Truvelog Mix 30 group and 48.7% of participants in the NovoMix 30 group) and 
increased slightly during the 26-week on-treatment period, similarly in the 2 groups. At Week 26, 62.9% of 
participants in the Truvelog Mix 30 group and 66.5% participants in the NovoMix 30 group were positive for 
AIA. In participants with positive AIA sample, AIA titers remained generally low. The median AIA titer was 
Assessment report  
EMA/165165/2022

16.0 (1/dil) in both treatment groups throughout the on-treatment period with a maximum interquartile 
range of 8.0 to 64.0 in the Truvelog Mix 30 group and 8.0 to 32.0 in the NovoMix 30 group. 
Boxplots of AIA titers by visit are provided in 16.2.7.2.36 for participants with treatment-emergent AIAs. 
Figure 17: Boxplot of AIA titers (1/dil) over time during the on-treatment period for patients with treatment-
emergent AIA – AIA population
Among participants positive for AIA at baseline, cross-reactivity to human insulin was found in more than 
85% of the participants at baseline. The percentage of participants with antibodies cross-reacting with human 
insulin was similar between both groups and ranged between 86.7% and 94.1% during the on-treatment 
period.  
The results consistent with the overall population were observed when AIA positivity was analysed in 
subgroups according to the type of diabetes, prior use of NovoMix 30 and geographic region.  
Influence of AIA on safety parameters 
Hypoglycaemia 
In the subgroup of participants with treatment-emergent AIAs, the percentage of participants with at least 
one hypoglycaemia was lower in the Truvelog Mix 30 group (60.6%) compared to the NovoMix 30 group 
(77.4%).  
TEAEs and SAEs 
The incidence of TEAEs was similar between treatment groups in participants with treatment-emergent AIAs 
(Truvelog Mix 30 : 9 [13.6%]; NovoMix 30: 10 [16.1%]) and those participants without treatment-emergent 
AIAs (Truvelog Mix 30 : 27 [20.6%]; NovoMix 30: 30 [22.7%]).

Injection site and hypersensitivity reactions 
In participants with treatment-emergent AIAs, no injection site or hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 
either treatment group while one participant without treatment-emergent AIA in the Truvelog Mix 30 group 
had hypersensitivity reaction (PT: pruritus).  
Neutralizing anti-insulin aspart antibody data 
Similar percentages of participants had detectable NAbs at baseline in the 2 treatment groups (Truvelog Mix 
30 : 3.8% [7/185 participants]; NovoMix 30 group: 5.7% [10/176 participants]). During the 26-week on-
treatment period, the percentage of participants with a treatment-emergent NAb response (i.e., with 
treatment-induced or treatment-boosted NAb) was similar in the 2 treatment groups (Truvelog Mix 30 : 8.0% 
[16/199]; NovoMix 30: 8.2% [16/195]). The percentages of participants positive for NAb at least at one 
time-point between baseline and Week 26 were similar in the 2 treatment groups (Truvelog Mix 30 : 11.6% 
[23/199 participants]; NovoMix 30 group: 13.3% [26/195 participants]). Among participants with treatment-
emergent NAbs, none of the participants had detectable NAbs at baseline in both treatment groups, i.e. all 
had treatment-induced NAb. The median peak NAb titer in both treatment groups was 20.0 (1/dil).  
Impact of COVID-19 pandemic 
The percentage of participants AIA positive at baseline or with detectable AIAs at least at one time point 
during the study (prevalence) was comparable between the participants with and without COVID-19 impact 
and between the treatment groups.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
N/A 
Discontinuation due to AES 
During the on-treatment period, no TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation were reported in 
either treatment group in study EFC15082.  
In study PDY15084, one participant had a fall (reported as a TEAE) which led to a TEAE of contusion (not 
considered related to study treatment) following administration of SAR341402 rapid-acting solution; these 
events led to discontinuation of the participant from the study, and thus, this participant only received IMP 
from the first treatment period (SAR341402 rapid-acting solution) during the study.

2.5.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In order to compare the safety of biosimilar medicinal product Truvelog Mix 30  with reference NovoMix 30, 
applicant submitted safety data from 2 studies – PK/PD study PDY15084 and phase 3 efficacy study 
EFC15082. As the phase 3 study had 400 patients enrolled for safety assessment compared to the PK/PD 
study with only 52 participant, the main safety assessment is based on phase 3 study. Safety results from 
the PK/PD study are considered to be supportive only. All the results mentioned below come from phase 3 
study EFC15082. 
With regard to the patient exposure, the safety data from phase 3 study were available for 203 patients in 
Truvelog Mix 30  group and 197 patients in NovoMix 30 group. The treatment lasted for more than 25 weeks 
for the majority of the participants and the duration of the exposure was similar in both groups. Around 48% 
of population had an exposure between 26 to 34 weeks. There is no safety information available on exposure 
>12 months. Hence the safety database is considered limited with regards to long term use which is foreseen 
for majority of the treated population. This is, however, acceptable for the evaluation of similarity and in line 
with the Guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal products containing 
recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/2005_Rev.1). 
The percentage of participants experiencing TEAEs was similar in the Truvelog Mix 30  group and the 
NovoMix 30 group (17.7% vs. 20.8%). The most frequently reported TEAEs in either treatment group were 
Infections and Infestations (Truvelog Mix 30 : 6.9%; NovoMix 30 11.7%), at the PT level nasopharingitis and 
upper respiratory tract infection. No TEAEs were considered as treatment related by the investigator. As 
there was a COVID-19 pandemic during the study, applicant assessed its impact on the safety results. No 
TEAEs were reported as related to COVID-19 (i.e., no COVID-19 illness) in either treatment group. The 
incidence of TEAEs was similar in the 2 treatment groups, regardless of trial impact (disruption) due to 
COVID-19.  
Serious TEAEs were reported by a low and similar percentage of participants in the Truvelog Mix 30  group 
(1.0%) and the NovoMix 30 group (1.5%). None of these SAEs was judged to be treatment related. Also, 2 
deaths occurred in this study, both were in NovoMix 30 group and none was considered related to the IMP. 
The incidence of any hypoglycaemia was similar between the two treatment groups (62.1% in the Truvelog 
Mix 30  group and 70.1% in the NovoMix 30 group). However, when divided into subgroups, patients with 
T1DM had higher incidence in documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (54.7% in the Truvelog Mix 30  group 
vs. 47.1% in the NovoMix 30 group for ≤3.9 mmol/l and 49.1% in the Truvelog Mix 30  vs. 37.3% in the 
NovoMix 30 group for ≤3.0 mmol/l) and for asymptomatic hypoglycaemia (45.3% in the Truvelog Mix 30  
group vs. 33.3% in the NovoMix 30 group for ≤3.0 mmol/l).  
Similar results were observed for participant-year exposure - the rate of “any” hypoglycaemia was similar in 
the 2 treatment groups (Truvelog Mix 30 : 12.62 events per participant-year of exposure; NovoMix 30: 13.43 
events per participant-year of exposure). However, for documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (<3.0 
mmol/L (54 mg/dL) there were values numerically higher in the Truvelog Mix 30  group (283 [2.59]) 
compared to the NovoMix 30 group (144 [1.36]). Numerically higher values were also observed for subgroup 
of T1DM patients in categories any hypoglycaemia, documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia and 
asymptomatic hypoglycaemia, and for subgroup T2DM in categories documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia 
(<3.0 mmol/L), asymptomatic hypoglycaemia (<3.0 mmol/L) and probable symptomatic hypoglycaemia. The 
rate ratio for documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (<3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) also favoured NovoMix30 
(RR=1.84; 95% CI: 1.08 to 3.15). This is also obvious in the hourly rate of documented symptomatic 
Assessment report  
EMA/165165/2022 
Page 89/97 
 
 
 
hypoglycaemia < 3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) per patient-year during the on-treatment period and the 
cumulative mean number of events per participant during the on-treatment. 
The applicant submitted justification that this numerical difference between treatment groups was driven by 6 
participants in the Truvelog Mix 30  group (5 with T1DM and 1 with T2DM, each reporting ≥20 events) who 
reported in total 155 out of 283 hypoglycaemia events in this category; while no participant reported more 
than 13 events in the NovoMix 30 group. Out of the 155 documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia events 
(<3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL)) reported by the 5 participants with T1DM, 139 showed evidence of at least one 
precipitating factor i.e., missed, delayed or smaller meal and/or physical activity. No relationship between 
race, age group, sex, baseline BMI, baseline eGFR, screening HbA1c, prior use of NovoMix 30, geographical 
region or duration of diabetes and the number of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia events was found 
in the 5 participants with T1DM. These 5 participants reported a maximum of 1.34 events per patient-week 
for documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (<3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL)), and a maximum of 2.26 events per 
patient-week for documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (≤3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL)). The applicant claims 
that this is consistent with the data from the literature where an average of 2 episodes of symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia per week was reported in patients with type 1 diabetes (Cryer PE. Hypoglycaemia in type 1 
diabetes mellitus. Endocrinol Metab Clin North Am. 2010 Sep;39(3):641-54). None of the hypoglycaemia 
events were severe (defined as an event requiring assistance), none met the definition of serious adverse 
event and none of these 5 participants permanently discontinued treatment due to hypoglycaemia events. It 
is also possible that the open label design of Study EFC15082 could have had an impact on hypoglycaemia 
events, that is, patients on IMP may have been more likely to measure blood glucose if experiencing feelings 
of hypoglycaemia. In addition, the study was not powered to show equivalence with regard to hypoglycaemia 
rate and treatment groups may not have been balanced with regard to hypoglycaemia risk. 
Post-hoc sensitivity analyses excluding these 6 participants from Truvelog Mix 30  group showed similar 
results between treatment groups for number of events and event rates per participant-year of exposure 
across all hypoglycaemia categories, including documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (<3.0 mmol/L). 
After the exclusion of 6 participants, the rate ratio for Truvelog Mix 30  versus NovoMix 30 was close to 1 for 
all categories of hypoglycaemia, including documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (<3.0 mmol/L [54 
mg/dL]; rate ratio=0.92; 95% CI: 0.58 to 1.47).   
Considering other adverse events of interest, no injection site reaction, pregnancy or symptomatic 
overdose with IMP were observed. One TEAE of hypersensitivity reaction was observed in the Truvelog Mix 30  
group in study EFC15082, however, it was not evaluated as allergic reaction. No clinically relevant differences 
were observed between patients receiving Truvelog Mix 30  or NovoMix 30 in laboratory parameters. Also, 
no treatment relevant discontinuation was observed.  
In immunogenicity assessment, similar percentages of participants in the 2 treatment groups had 
detectable AIAs at baseline (Truvelog Mix 30 : 49.2%; NovoMix 30: 54.0%). The percentage of participants 
with a treatment-emergent AIA response during the 26-week on-treatment period was also similar between 
Truvelog Mix 30  (33.2%) and NovoMix 30 (31.8%), with risk difference 1.7% (90% CI: -5.90 to 9.22). No 
relevant differences in terms of duration of the AIA response (transient or persistent) could be observed 
between the two treatment groups. Also, no relevant differences in baseline antibodies or treatment-
emergent antibodies were seen in different subgroups according to the type of diabetes, prior use of NovoMix 
30 and geographic region. No influence of AIA on safety parameters (hypoglycaemia, TEAEs and SAEs, 
injection site and hypersensitivity reactions) was detected.  
Assessment report

Percentages of participants with detectable NAbs at baseline was numerically higher in NovoMix 30 group 
(Truvelog Mix 30 : 3.8%; NovoMix 30 group: 5.7%). The percentage of participants with a treatment-
emergent NAb response was similar in the 2 treatment groups.  
Also, results showed that trial disruption due to COVID-19 had a limited impact on AIA response. 
In general, the safety parameters of Truvelog Mix 30  and NovoMix 30 were comparable, with the exception 
of hypoglycaemic events and AIA titres mentioned above.

3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
This procedure concerns a marketing authorisation application for Truvelog Mix 30 (soluble insulin 
aspart/protamine-crystallised insulin aspart in the ratio 30/70; 100 U/ml) according to the Article 10(4) of 
Directive 2001/83/EC. The reference medicinal product is NovoMix 30 suspension for injection, marketed by 
Novo Nordisk and authorised in the EU since 2000.  
The proposed indication is the same as for the NovoMix 30: 
Truvelog Mix 30 is indicated for treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 10 
years and above. 
Quality 
A comprehensive analytical comparability study was performed to evaluate analytical similarity between 
Truvelog Mix 30 and the EU reference product NovoMix 30. The applicant’s strategy to establish similarity of 
Truvelog Mix 30 with the EU reference product NovoMix 30 is endorsed. The attributes tested in the 
biosimilarity study cover all attributes relevant for the analytical comparison. 
Non-clinical pharmacology 
Several complementary functional assays were utilised to assess SAR341402 biological activity. The assays 
used included binding to human insulin receptor (IR-A and IR-B, respectively), including on-off kinetics and 
Assessment report  
EMA/165165/2022 
Page 92/97 
 
 
 
 
receptor autophosphorylation, binding and activation of IGF-1 receptor, potency for induction of metabolic 
activities as well as mitogenic activity. In vivo pharmacological activity of SAR341402 was assessed as part of 
the two 1-month repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and a local tolerability study in rabbits. Within the non-
clinical programme, no investigation with Truvelog Mix 30  formulation in comparison with the reference 
medicinal product NovoMix was performed since aspart-protamine contains the same active substance as 
SAR341402, thus the same action on the pharmacological targets of insulin is expected. The applicant’s 
justification for using Insulin Aspart SAR341402 drug substance in comparison to EU NovoRapid/US NovoLog 
in non-clinical comparability studies is considered acceptable. The applicant’s strategy to establish similarity 
of SAR341402 with the references EU NovoRapid/US NovoLog is endorsed. 
Clinical 
Clinical development programme consisted of one PK/PD study (PDY15084) and one Phase 3 study 
(EFC15082) to compare efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of Truvelog Mix 30. 
Study PDY15084 
This study was a randomised, double-blind, 4-treatment, cross-over study to compare PK, PD and tolerability 
of Truvelog Mix 30  to NovoLog Mix 70/30 (US), NovoMix 30 (EU) and SAR341402 rapid-acting solution in 
participants with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) using the euglycaemic clamp technique and was conducted 
in 2 cohorts. The performance of the euglycaemic clamp study in T1DM patients to demonstrate similarity is 
in accordance with the Guideline on the non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal 
products containing recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev 
1). 
Study EFC15082 
This was a Phase 3, 26-week, randomised, open-label, parallel group study comparing Truvelog Mix 30  to 
NovoMix 30 in adult participants with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus using pre-mix insulin analogues. 
According to the guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal products 
containing recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_rev.1), there 
is no need for specific efficacy studies since HbA1c is not considered sensitive enough to detect potentially 
clinically relevant differences between two insulins. Therefore, the efficacy study submitted is considered 
supportive only, while PK/PD study PDY15084 is pivotal to demonstrate comparable efficacy of the two insulin 
products. With regard to the safety assessment of biosimilarity, the focus should be on immunogenicity 
assessment. Due to the patient exposure and its duration, the study EFC15082 is appropriate to demonstrate 
the comparability between the two insulin products in terms of safety and immunogenicity assessment.  
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality  
The analytical comparability study demonstrates analytical comparability between the test and the reference 
product with respect to insulin aspart protein structural features and its impurity profile as well as with regard 
to the drug product formulation. 
Non-clinical pharmacology 
The results demonstrate that the biological activity of the Insulin Aspart in SAR341402, NovoRapid and NovoLog 
are comparable in terms of IR-A and IR-B receptor binding and activation, the capability of receptor activated

inhibition of lipolysis in human adipocytes, suppression of gluconeogenesis in hepatic cells and glucose uptake 
into myocytes, which are the primary mechanisms of action, as well as IGF-1R receptor activation and induction 
of  proliferation  of  human  adenocarcinoma  cells.  Similarity  in  biological  activity  is  considered  to  be 
demonstrated.  
In  the  toxicological  studies  TSA1504  and  TSA1518,  similar  exposure,  in  terms  of  Cmax  and  AUC0-8,  was 
observed for equivalent doses of SAR341402, NovoRapid and NovoLog. 
Clinical 
PK/PD 
Study PDY15084 demonstrated similar PK profiles between Truvelog Mix 30  and  NovoMix 30. The 90% 
confidence intervals of the treatment ratios for the primary PK parameters, INS-Cmax and INS-AUClast (0.85 to 
1.00 and 0.91 to 1.07, respectively) were within the predefined acceptance range (0.8 to 1.25). These results 
were supported by the secondary PK endpoints.  
All 90% CIs of INS-AUC, INS-AUC0-24h, INS-AUC(0-4h)  and INS-AUC4-24h included unity. The results for 
INS-AUC, INS-AUC0-24h  and post-hoc calculated INS-AUC0-12h showed that the total exposure of Truvelog Mix 
30  and the reference products can be deemed as similar.  
Safety 
The percentage of participants experiencing TEAEs was similar in the Truvelog Mix 30 group and the NovoMix 
30 group. Serious TEAEs were reported by a low and similar percentage of participants in the Truvelog Mix 30 
group and the NovoMix 30 group. 
No increased immunogenicity of Truvelog Mix 30 compared to NovoMix 30 was observed. The percentage of 
participants with a treatment-emergent AIA response during the 26-week on-treatment period was similar 
between Truvelog Mix 30  and NovoMix 30. No clinically relevant differences in terms of duration of the AIA 
response (transient or persistent) could be observed between the two treatment groups. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
Quality 
Based on the results presented for analytical comparability, specifics of the test product and the reference 
product observed in particle size distribution and crystal length are considered negligible.  There is no doubt 
on analytical similarity between test product and reference product with respect to insulin aspart protein 
structural features and its impurity profile as well as with respect to the formulated drug product. Analytical 
similarity between Truvelog Mix 30 and NovoMix 30 can be firmly concluded. 
Clinical 
PK/PD 
The study PDY15084 was primarily designed to demonstrate PK similarity of the biphasic preparation 
Truvelog Mix 30 with the reference products NovoLog Mix 70/30 and NovoMix 30.  
Study was neither designed nor powered to formally demonstrate PD similarity between Truvelog Mix 30 and 
the reference products. PD endpoints were included as secondary objectives. For PD paramaters, 95% CIs for

GIRmax and GIR-AUC0-24h were calculated additionally to the 90% CIs for the PK endpoints to fulfil the EU 
guideline criteria and yielded the following results:  
GIRmax, SAR Mix / NovoMix: 0.90 (0.75 to 1.07) 
GIR-AUC0-24h SAR Mix / NovoMix: 0.93 (0.77 to 1.12). 
Although evaluation of PD parameters is not a strict requirement for a new biosimilar insulin formulation 
containing an active ingredient that is already licensed as part of another biosimilar insulin formulation, PD 
data, if presented, are expected to  “reasonably” support PK results (Guideline on nonclinical and clinical 
development of similar biological medicinal products containing recombinant human insulin and insulin 
analogues. EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005 Rev.1).  
The available PD data suggested slight differences between Truvelog Mix 30 and the EU reference product 
NovoMix 30.  The relevance of these clinical findings has been discussed by the applicant and justified by 
greater variability in PK and PD of insulin premixes in comparison to rapid acting insulin, by low dose of rapid 
acting insulin component which represent only a dose of 0.09 U/kg from the whole administered dose of 0.3 
U/kg of the premix formulation. Moreover, the study was not powered to formally demonstrate equivalence of 
PD parameters. Since the evaluation of PD parameters is not a strict requirement for a new biosimilar insulin 
formulation containing an active ingredient that is already licensed as part of another biosimilar insulin 
formulation and since close similarity in physicochemical and functional characteristics and PK profiles has 
been shown, this issue is considered to be solved.  
Efficacy 
For the comparative study EFC15082, which is not a requirement for the proof of similar efficacy of the 
biosimilar insulin candidate, the primary objective was formally not met. The non-inferiority margin of 0.3 in 
HbA1c was not met for Truvelog Mix 30 compared to NovoMix 30 in the ITT population. The LS mean 
difference between Truvelog Mix 30 and NovoMix 30 was 0.08 (95% CI: 0.139 to 0.303). This was remedied 
by exclusion of one outlier, after which the primary endpoint was met. Although this can be attributed to an 
unforeseen event, i.e. the respective patients experienced a substantial increase in HbA1c due to running out 
of study medicinal product during the pandemic, post hoc analyses not predefined in the study protocol are 
generally not acceptable. However, in this case equivalence with regard to HbA1c results are not a 
requirement for authorisation and therefore, the exclusion of this outlier was accepted and the issue was not 
pursued further.  
Safety 
Although the overall hypoglycaemia rate was similar, patients with T1DM had higher incidence in documented 
symptomatic hypoglycaemia and asymptomatic hypoglycaemia in Truvelog Mix 30 compared to NovoMix 
group. According to the applicant, this was driven by 5 participants reporting more than 20 events of 
hypoglycaemia, each. No relationship between race, age group, sex, baseline BMI, baseline eGFR, screening 
HbA1c, prior use of NovoMix 30, geographical region or duration of diabetes and the number of documented 
symptomatic hypoglycaemia events was found in these 5 participants. Evaluation showed that in all 5 
participants most of the symptomatic hypoglycaemia events were related to standard confounding factors 
such as physical activity, missed, delayed or smaller meals, alcohol consumption and deviation from dosing 
instruction (mismatch in the timing or amount of insulin). Furthermore, the frequency of hypoglycaemia 
experienced by these 5 patients were not above the frequency of hypoglycaemia in T1DM patients reported in 
the literature. Therefore, this issue is considered related to precipitating factors and not product-related.

3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
Based on the results of the analytical comparability study, analytical similarity between Truvelog Mix 30 and 
NovoMix 30 can be firmly concluded.  
Based on the PK/PD euglycaemic clamp study, the applicant has demonstrated PK comparability for relevant 
PK parameters (INS-Cmax, INS-AUClast, INS-AUC, INS-AUC(0-24h), INS-AUC(0-4h)  and INS-AUC(4-24h)) between 
Truvelog Mix 30 and NovoMix 30. The available PD data suggested slight differences between Truvelog Mix 30 
and NovoMix 30. The applicant provided appropriate justification as to why the post-hoc defined lower 
equivalence margin was not met and why the small observed differences are not clinically relevant.  
The results of the EFC15082 study cannot by itself prove biosimilarity between Truvelog Mix 30 and NovoMix 
30, as the HbA1c parameter is not sensitive enough to detect potentially clinically relevant differences 
between two insulins.   
The safety profiles of test and reference can generally be considered similar. The higher incidence of 
symptomatic hypoglycaemia and asymptomatic hypoglycaemia in Truvelog Mix 30 compared to NovoMix 
group in T1DM patients is considered to be related to precipitation factors and has been thus sufficiently 
justified.  
Based on the totality of the evidence, including demonstration of close similarity in physicochemical and 
functional characteristics and in PK profiles, the notion that PD parameters are not a strict requirement for a 
new biosimilar insulin formulation containing an active ingredient that is already licensed as part of another 
biosimilar insulin formulation as well as the accepted justification that the small differences in PD parameters 
are not clinically relevant, biosimilarity between Truvelog Mix 30 and the reference insulin NovoMix 30 can be 
concluded.

N/A 
3.6.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Truvelog Mix 30 is considered biosimilar to NovoMix 30. 
Therefore, a benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products

Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue, 
leading to bone fragility and an increased risk of fractures. Primary osteoporosis is the more common 
form and is due to typical age-related loss of bone. Secondary osteoporosis results from the presence of 
other diseases or conditions that predispose to bone loss. The most common cause of secondary 
osteoporosis is GC use. 
Pharmacologic therapies approved in many countries for the treatment of GIOP include teriparatide

(anabolic) and several bisphosphonate (antiresorptive) therapies, including alendronate (oral, once daily 
[QD]), risedronate (oral, QD), and zoledronic acid (intravenous, yearly) 
Denosumab is approved under the trade name of Prolia® as a 60 mg/mL denosumab solution (dosing 
regimen 60 mg SC Q6M) for indications involving bone loss, including treatment of women with 
postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), men with osteoporosis, and bone loss due to hormone-ablative 
therapy (HALT) in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for nonmetastatic prostate cancer. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody. According to the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment 
of medical products for human use, no environmental risk assessment is necessary for denosumab. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
GCP 
The Clinical trial 20101217 was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The 
applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis 
The pivotal study, Study 20101217, is a phase 3, international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel-group study to compare the effects of denosumab 60 mg SC 
Q6M with those of oral risedronate 5 mg QD on lumbar spine BMD in 795 subjects (556 women and 
239 men) at high risk for fracture treated with GC.  Two subpopulations of subjects who received GC 
therapy were studied:  the glucocorticoid-continuing subpopulation (GC-C; n = 505) and the 
glucocorticoid-initiating subpopulation (GC-I; n = 290).  This application presents data from the 12-
month primary analysis period of the study.  Subjects will continue blinded treatment and be evaluated 
through month 24 for assessment of additional safety and efficacy endpoints. 
As the population in Study 20101217 has received GC, their disease is considered to be in the category of 
secondary osteoporosis.  Supportive data are provided from the first 12 months of 4 pivotal clinical 
studies performed to support other bone loss indications in the following 2 categories: 
1.  Primary osteoporosis 
Study 20030216 performed in 7808 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), which is the basis 
for bridging antifracture efficacy to the proposed indication for GIOP 
Study 20080098 performed in 242 men with osteoporosis 
2. Bone loss in subjects undergoing HALT 
Study 20040138 performed in 1468 men with bone loss due to ADT for prostate cancer 
Study 20040135 in 252 women undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy for nonmetastatic breast cancer 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406583/2018 
Page 6/74 
 
  
  
Efficacy in subjects with GIOP is established based on clinically significant positive results for BMD in 
Study 20101217 in combination with antifracture efficacy demonstrated in Study 20030216, along with 
additional supportive efficacy information from Studies 20040138, 20080098, and 20040135.  Change 
from baseline in lumbar spine BMD has been previously accepted by regulatory authorities as the primary 
efficacy assessment in clinical trials for GIOP in men and women after antifracture efficacy has been 
established in women with PMO (Reid et al, 2009; Saag et al, 2007; Reid et al, 2000; Cohen et al, 1999; 
Saag et al, 1998). 
In addition to the above mentioned studies the MAH has previously conducted study 20040144, a 
Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Multi-dose Phase 2 Study to Determine the Efficacy, 
Safety and Tolerability of Denosumab in the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis. RA is not a labelled 
indication for denosumab. A total of 227 subjects were enrolled and randomized and 203 (89%) 
completed the 12-month treatment period, last visit occurred in 2007. Safety results from this study were 
reviewed during this procedure, no new safety signal was identified. 
2.3.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
118 subjects were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis from study 20101217 (glucocorticoid-
initiating (GC-I) 44 subjects; glucocorticoid-continuing (GC-C), 74 subjects). Following the first 60 mg SC 
dose of denosumab, denosumab exposures (maximum concentration [Cmax] and area under the curve 
from time zero to time of last quantifiable concentration [AUClast]) were similar in the GC-I and GC-C 
subpopulations, Table 1. Further, the exposure in study 20101217 was consistent with that observed 
previously without concomitant glucocorticoids, Table 2.

The PK for denosumab looks similar in the GC-I and GC-C  subpopulations in study 20101217. Also, the 
PK of denosumab appears similar for the combined cohort from study 20101217 to previosly reported 
pharmacokinetics for subjects without glucocorticoid as cocomitant medication.  
Additional pharmacokinetic data was reported at the end of study. Majority of the data (98/106 samples) 
were collected at early termination, unscheduled time points or at 24 months and are therefore not 
anticipated to impact the month 12 primary analysis results. The serum denosumab Ctrough concentrations 
at month 24 were consistent with those reported at month 12 (table 3 and table 4).

The applicants conclusion that the additional data is not anticipated to impact the 12 month primary 
analysis results is accepted since only 8 of the 106 new samples could impact the primary analysis.  
Many of the Ctrough samples are below LOQ and were set to 0. The median Ctrough for 12 and 24 months 
both for GC-C and GC-I subjects was thus 0. Overall the Ctrough at 12 and 24 months for both GC-C and 
GC-I subject appear similar. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study (study 20101217) 
Randomized, Double-blind, Active-controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Denosumab 
Compared With Risedronate in Glucocorticoid-treated Individuals. 
This active-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy study compares the effects of denosumab (60 mg 
every 6 months) and risedronate (5 mg once daily) treatment on glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in

(a) subjects initiating glucocorticoid treatment and (b) subjects continuing glucocorticoid treatment. The 
submitted clinical study report summarizes the 12-month primary analysis (Data cutoff date: 29 June 
2016.) Subjects will continue to receive treatment for a further 12 months. 
Methods 
Study participants 
Key inclusion criteria were: 
• 
• 
 men and women ≥ 18 years of age who were receiving prednisone ≥ 7.5 mg daily or its equivalent 
and were expected to be treated with oral glucocorticoids for a total of at least 6 months 
at least 2 lumbar vertebrae and 1 hip had to be evaluable by DXA 
•  Subjects < 50 years of age at the time of screening were required to have a history of osteoporotic 
fracture. 
Subjects who had initiated administration of prednisone within 3 months or   ≥ 3 months before 
screening were part of the GC-I subpopulation or GC-C subpopulation, respectively.  
In the GC-C subpopulation, subjects who were ≥ 50 years of age at screening were required to have a 
BMD value equivalent to a T-score ≤ -2.0 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck; or a BMD value 
equivalent to a T-score ≤ -1.0 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck and a history of 
osteoporotic fracture. 
Subjects excluded from the study included those who had received other osteoporosis or bone-active 
treatment, certain hormone-derived treatments, or certain biologic agents within defined time limits. 
Other exclusion criteria: 
Subject has an active infection or history of infections as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
any active infection for which systemic anti-infectives were used within 4 weeks prior to screening 
a serious infection, defined as requiring hospitalization or intravenous anti-infectives within 8 weeks 
prior to screening 
recurrent or chronic infections or other active infection that, in the opinion of the investigator, might 
compromise the safety of the subject. 
Evidence of any of the following: 
•  History of hyperthyroidism (stable on antithyroid therapy is allowed), History of hypothyroidism 
(stable on thyroid replacement therapy is allowed),  
•  History of hypo- or hyperparathyroidism 
•  History of Addison disease 
•  History of osteomalacia 
•  History of osteonecrosis of the jaw 
•  History of tooth extraction or other dental surgery within the prior 6 months 
• 
Invasive dental work planned in the next 2 years 
•  Significantly impaired renal function as determined by a derived glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using 
Cockcroft-Gault formula of ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 calculated by the central laboratory 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406583/2018 
Page 9/74 
 
  
  
It is noted that the exclusion criteria are more extensive than the SmPC in force at time of this 
application. For example, there are no warnings regarding infections in the EU SmPC.  
Corticosteroids are a risk factor for ONJ. Patients with a history of tooth extraction or other dental surgery 
within the prior 6 months or invasive dental work planned in the next 2 years were excluded from the 
current study.  
Treatments, Randomisation, Blinding  
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio in a double-blind manner to receive double-dummy 
investigational product consisting either of SC injection of denosumab 60 mg every 6 months and oral 
placebo for risedronate or oral risedronate 5mg daily and SC injection of placebo for denosumab. An 
interactive voice response system was used. Randomization was stratified by sex within each 
subpopulation. Enrollment of men was restricted to between 30% and 40% within each subpopulation. 
To maintain the blind, a double-dummy procedure was used: subjects randomized to receive SC 
denosumab injections also received oral placebo capsules for risedronate and subjects randomized to 
receive oral risedronate capsules also received SC placebo injections. 
Placebo for denosumab was presented in identical containers and stored/packaged the in the same way 
as denosumab. Placebo for risedronate was presented in identical containers and stored/packaged in the 
same way as risedronate. 
No dosage adjustments were permitted. Denosumab and denosumab placebo were injected by study 
center staff. Subjects were instructed to bring back the remaining capsules at the next visit for 
assessment of treatment compliance (total capsules taken = capsules dispensed – capsules returned). 
All subjects are required to take daily supplements of at least 1000 mg elemental calcium and at least 
800 IU vitamin D during the study. If a subject should become hypercalcaemic over the course of the 
study, the calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation may be discontinued until the serum calcium 
concentration has returned to the normal range.

Safety Endpoints 
Safety endpoints evaluated in the combined subpopulations included the following: 
•

Sample size 
The planned total sample size was 776 subjects with 248 per group in the GC-C subpopulation and 140 
per group in the GC-I subpopulation.  
The non-inferiority margins chosen for percent change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at 12 months 
were based on results from two placebo-controlled studies with risedronate in the GIOP patient 
populations and the study with zoledronic acid in a similar population and risedronate as the active 
comparator (Cohen et al, 1999; Reid et al, 2000; Reid et al, 2009). Non-inferiority margins of -1.1 
percentage points and -0.7 percentage points, representing a 50% preservation of the risedronate effect 
observed from these two studies were considered clinically relevant for the GC-I subpopulation and GC-C 
subpopulation, respectively. 
Table 5 Sample Size Assumptions for Primary Endpoint Evaluation 
In addition, each subpopulation was to have approximately at least a 90% power to detect a difference in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406583/2018 
Page 12/74 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
percent change in BMD by DXA at lumbar spine and total hip between the treatment groups (denosumab 
– risedronate) at month 12 (Table 6). 
Table 6 Power Assumptions for Secondary Endpoints Evaluated at Month 12 
A larger NI margin was chosen for treatment with denosumab among patients initiating 
glucocorticoid therapy compared to those continuing. This is assumed to be explained by that a 
larger effect in the former subpopulation was expected and since both NI margins were chosen 
based on an idea of 50% preservation of risedronate efficacy against placebo and zoledronic acid 
versus risedronate/placebo as seen in earlier studies.  
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis was planned to occur after all subjects had had the opportunity to complete the 12-
month study visit, the study was however to continue for another 12 months of blinded treatment, and 
there was no plan to allow stopping the trial due to efficacy or futility based on the 12-month analysis 
results. 
Analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints and testing procedures were performed 
separately within the glucocorticoid-continuing and glucocorticoid-initiating subpopulations. The 
experiment-wise Type I error rate was controlled at a 5% significance level within each subpopulation 
using a fixed sequence testing procedure among the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints in the 
order presented below: 
1. Primary efficacy endpoint: Lumbar spine BMD at month 12 (non-inferiority) 
2. Secondary efficacy endpoint: Lumbar spine BMD at month 12 
3. Secondary efficacy endpoint: Total hip BMD at month 12 
4. Secondary efficacy endpoint: Lumbar spine BMD at month 24 
5. Secondary efficacy endpoint: Total hip BMD at month 24 
Endpoints not included in this testing procedure were to be considered exploratory. 
The primary efficacy set included all randomised subjects who had a baseline measure and a post-
baseline measure at the time point of interest. The per-protocol set included a subset of subjects from 
the Primary Efficacy Set who had minimum exposure to IP and did not significantly violate the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria nor significantly deviate from the protocol through month 12. Results based on 
the per-protocol subset set were to be used as a sensitivity analysis for the primary non-inferiority 
hypotheses. 
For the primary and secondary endpoints, the DXA percent change from baseline at month 12 for each 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406583/2018 
Page 13/74 
 
  
  
 
skeletal site measured were analysed within the two subpopulations using an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model with main effects for treatment, sex, baseline BMD, machine type, and interaction effect 
for baseline BMD and machine type for each subpopulation, and addition of duration of prior 
glucocorticoid use (< 12 months versus ≥ 12 months) for GC-C subpopulation only. 
Only subjects with observed BMD data at baseline and at the post-baseline time point of interest will be 
included in the primary analysis. Least-squares mean point estimates of the percent change from baseline 
for each arm were to be presented together with a two-sided 95% confidence interval and the associated 
p-value. A confidence interval will be constructed for the treatment contrast (denosumab - risedronate), 
and the lower bound were compared to the non-inferiority margin of the primary efficacy endpoint for the 
non-inferiority test within each subpopulation.  
The following sensitivity analyses were to be provided for percent change from baseline at month 12 
lumbar spine BMD (non-inferiority); the primary analysis was to be repeated using the per-protocol 
analysis set and the lumbar spine BMD percent changes from baseline at each time point analysed using 
a repeated measures model separately within each subpopulation. 
The primary endpoint was also to be evaluated in glucocorticoid-continuing subjects who had a BMD value 
equivalent to a T-score ≤ -2.0 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck; or a BMD value equivalent 
to a T-score ≤ -1.0 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck and with a history of osteoporotic 
fracture using the same ANCOVA model as in the primary analysis. 
Regarding exploratory endpoints, percent change from baseline in femoral neck, trochanter, and 1/3 
radius BMD by DXA were to be analysed using the same methods as for secondary efficacy endpoints. For 
percent change from baseline in BTM a Wilcoxon rank sum test was to be used. Bone histology and 
histomorphometry and pharmacokinetic endpoints were to be analysed using descriptive statistics. 
Subject incidence of new vertebral fractures was to be summarized over 12 and 24 months in combined 
glucocorticoid-continuing and glucocorticoid-initiating subpopulations. Subject incidence of clinical 
fractures in both subpopulations combined was also to be summarized over 12 and 24 months using 
Kaplan-Meier methodology. For the clinical fracture endpoint, the full analysis set (FAS) including all 
subjects randomised was used. For the new vertebral fracture endpoint the analysis set was to include all 
randomised subjects who had a baseline and ≥ 1 post baseline evaluation of vertebral fracture at or 
before the time point under consideration. Subjects in this analysis set were to be analysed according to 
their original treatment assignment, regardless of treatment received. 
Within each treatment group, analyses of the proportions of patient preference and long term preference 
between the 6-month injection and daily pill were to be performed in which subjects with no preference 
and missing data were to be removed from the analysis.  
All safety analyses were based on the subpopulations combined. The safety analysis set included all 
randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of IP with subjects to be analysed according to their 
actual treatment received. 
Before any analyses for this study report were conducted, the protocol-defined statistical analyses were 
detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), which was amended once prior to the 12-month primary 
analysis. Version 1 of the SAP was dated 30 September 2011 and version 2 was dated 04 August 2016. 
The SAP was amended to match the Protocol Amendment 4 dated 30 June 2016 and to clarify which 
analyses were to be performed during the upcoming 12-month primary analysis (database snapshot 
planned on August 17, 2016) and final analysis for this study.   
The study had two separate experimental aims; to assess denosumab efficacy in two different 
subpopulations, hence with main analyses to be performed separately for each subpopulation.  The type I 
error rate was to be controlled at a 5% significance level within each subpopulation separately using a

fixed sequence testing procedure among primary and secondary endpoints. The multiplicity adjustment 
used implied that the study could be considered successful if the primary objective was met in either of 
the two subpopulations. This is acceptable with regard to that the study was planned with e.g. two 
separate primary objectives to support two new indications but should require that the two 
subpopulations can be considered to be mutually exclusive (i.e. that there is no overlap between them). 
The primary and secondary endpoints, DXA percent change from baseline at month 12 for each skeletal 
site measured, were analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. While the main effects 
for treatment, gender and baseline BMD is endorsed, main effect for e.g. machine type and the 
interaction effect for baseline BMD and machine type is not evidently. Although, importantly, the primary 
model was pre-specified (both in the study protocol and the SAP), no justification for including each of 
the covariates was found and was therefore requested. In their response the MAH justified the choice of 
primary analysis model including machine type and the interaction term by the different scales of baseline 
BMD between the two proprietary technologies (Lunar and Hologic machines) which is accepted. In 
addition, to investigate the robustness of the primary analysis, additional analyses were required based 
on an ANCOVA model with main effects for treatment, gender and baseline BMD. They had been provided 
during the procedure and show very similar outcomes hereby supporting the robustness of the primary 
analysis. 
In the analysis of primary and secondary endpoints only subjects with observed BMD data at baseline and 
at the post-baseline time point of interest were included and hence no imputation if data missing were 
performed.   
Given the definition of the primary efficacy set it corresponded to a completer analysis set. In addition to 
the primary efficacy set, a PP set was defined to be used for additional analyses of the primary endpoint. 
Considering the definition of the former and that the PP was to comprise a subset of the primary efficacy 
set, the difference between them tended to be small having an impact on the significance of the PP 
analysis as a measure of robustness.  In a non-inferiority trial, the full analysis set and the per protocol 
analysis set should have equal importance and needs to provide consistent results. A Full Analysis Set 
was pre-defined but was not intended to be used for any analysis of the primary endpoint. Here, where 
not only non-inferiority but superiority has been shown an analysis based on the FAS is considered of 
(even more) importance. 
No new amendments have been made to the statistical analysis plan. Hence the SAP submitted with the 
CSR for the 24-month final analysis is version 2 (dated 04 August 2016) that at the time had been 
revised to clarify which analyses were to be performed during the upcoming 12-month primary analysis 
(database snapshot planned on August 17, 2016) and final analysis for this study. 
For the 24-month final analyses, two of the efficacy endpoints, lumbar spine BMD at month 24 and total 
hip BMD at month 24, were defined among the secondary endpoints included in the fixed sequence 
testing procedure used to control the Type I error rate at a 5% significance level (however separately for 
each subpopulation).  
Results 
Participant flow 
Within the GC-I subpopulation, the study discontinuation rate was somewhat higher in the denosumab 
group (15.9%) than in the risedronate group (9.7%), which was related to a higher rate of withdrawal of 
consent in the denosumab group.  
The applicant was asked to provide data on the progression of osteoporosis in these patients who 
discontinued. The Applicant considered that discontinuation rates compare with those reported in most

pivotal clinical trials of osteoporosis medications in GC-I osteoporosis, but has not provided an adequate 
explanation why there was such a significant difference in the discontinuation rate for the glucocorticoid-
initiating population between denosumab (15.9%) and risedronate groups (9.7%).  
According to the Applicant no information past study discontinuation is available and thus no data on the 
progression of osteoporosis in these patients has been provided. Issue was not further pursued as there 
appear to be no relevant data available.

Within the GC-C subpopulation, the study discontinuation rate during the 12-month primary analysis 
period was more similar in the denosumab (14.2%) and risedronate (12.3%) groups. The rate of study 
discontinuations due to adverse events was also similar (denosumab 3.6%, risedronate 3.2%).

Recruitment 
This study was conducted at 79 centers in Europe, North America, Latin America, and Korea. The study 
initiation date was 28 March 2012 (first subject enrolled). The study is currently ongoing and treatment 
remains blinded.  The data cutoff date for the 12-month Primary Analysis was 29 June 2016.  
Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended 4 times; major changes are documented in Table 8-10.

According to table 8-10 (above) it seemed as if the wrong number of enrolled subjects had been 
given at the time for amendment 1 and/or 2 (167 and 127 respectively). The dates were also 
considered to be somewhat confusing and the MAH was requested to clarify. The MAH explained 
that Table 8-10 showed the number of subjects who initially consented and enrolled under each 
specific protocol version over time and not the total number of subjects enrolled in the study on 
the date that a new protocol version was issued. 
With amendment 3 it was clarified that the NI comparison was to be performed for the primary 
efficacy endpoint only within each subpopulation.

Numbers analysed 
In the denosumab group, the full analysis set (N = 398) includes 5 subjects who were randomised to 
denosumab but did not receive any denosumab injections, and the safety analysis set (N = 394) includes 
1 subject who was randomised to risedronate but received denosumab instead (Table below). In the 
risedronate group, the full analysis set (N = 397) includes 12 subjects who were randomised to 
risedronate but were not confirmed to have received any doses of investigational product; these 12 
subjects and 1 subject who received denosumab erroneously were not included in the safety analysis set 
(N = 384). 
Table. Number of Subjects by Analysis Set (12-month Primary Analysis) 
To be included in the primary analysis set a subject was required to have endpoint data month 12. 
Seemingly, not all who completed the first 12 months of the study had an evaluation/DXA at month 12. 
In the GC-I subpopulation, the primary efficacy set included 82.1% (119/145) and 86.9% (126/145) of 
randomized subjects in the denosumab and risedronate treatment arm respectively. The corresponding 
PP set comprised 69.7% (101/145) of randomised subjects in the denosumab arm and 74.5% (108/145) 
of randomised subjects in the risedronate arm. 
In the GC-C subpopulation, the primary efficacy set included 82.6% (209/253) and 83.7% (211/252) of 
randomized subjects in the denosumab and risedronate treatment arm respectively. The corresponding 
PP set comprised 70.0% (177/253) of randomised subjects in the denosumab arm and 68.7% (173/252) 
of randomised subjects in the risedronate arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406583/2018 
Page 26/74 
 
  
  
 
 
This implies that in all analyses presented, a non-negligible proportion of randomised subjects were 
excluded; across subpopulations 13-18% in primary analyses and approximately 25-30% in analyses 
based on the PP set. No analyses of the primary or (key) secondary efficacy endpoints were planned or 
have been performed based on the Full Analysis set (including all randomised).    
The vast majority (>90%) of the patients in the study were treated with GC for >6 months. Overall, 44% 
continued GC at month 24. 
Most of the patients who discontinued GC treatment continued with the IP treatment. In contrast, 
antiresorptive treatment for GIOP is discontinued when GC treatment is discontinued in clinical practice. 
The increase in bone resorption in GIOP occurs early and is transient, which would implicate that the need 
of antiresorptive therapy is also limited in time. It is difficult to draw any conclusions regarding optimal 
treatment duration from the current study design. This needs to be based on individual patients BMD and 
other risk factors for fracture.

b Based on actual treatment received. One subject was randomized to risedronate but received denosumab 
in error; this subject was included in the denosumab group. Two additional deaths were reported in 
subjects randomized to risedronate (pneumonia bacterial and polymyositis). These subjects were not 
included in the safety analysis set, because it was not possible to confirm that they had taken at least 
1 dose of oral investigational product. The 2 subjects died prior to their month-6 visit and oral 
investigational product accountability verification.

The primary efficacy set included all randomised subjects who had a baseline measure and a post-
baseline measure at the time point of interest.  
Analyses month 24 (analogous the primary analysis month 12) were hence based on observed data 
implying the exclusion of a rather high proportion of randomised subjects in each treatment arm in both 
the GC-I and the GC-C subpopulation. 
In the GC-I subpopulation, the primary efficacy set (lumbar spine) included 73.8%% (107/145) and 
77.9% (113/145) of randomised subjects in the denosumab and risedronate treatment arm respectively. 
In the GC-C subpopulation, the primary efficacy set (lumbar spine) included 72.3% (183/253) and 69.0% 
(174/252) of randomised subjects in the denosumab and risedronate treatment arm respectively.

Table. Primary Efficacy Analyses of Secondary Endpoints: Percent Change From Baseline in the Lumbar 
Spine and Total Hip Bone Mineral Density at Month 12 (Primary Efficacy Analysis Set, Observed Data, 12-
month Primary Analysis) 
Subgroups were explored for the percent change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at month 12 
separately within each subpopulation. Each analysis was performed by subpopulation (GC-I and GC-C). 
The subgroup results consistently demonstrated a greater increase in BMD at the lumbar spine at month 
12 in the denosumab group compared with the risedronate group. A significant quantitative interaction 
was observed only in the analysis by sex (men versus women) in the GC-I subpopulation (1.2% for men 
and 3.7% for women). 
However, non-significant qualitative interaction testing indicated that there was no evidence that the 
direction of the denosumab effect differed by gender in the GC-I subpopulation. 
With both treatments, the BMD increased both in GC-I and GC-C populations.  For the denosumab treated 
patients, the mean baseline T-score at lumbar spine was -1.92 for the GC-C Subpopulation and -0.92 for 
the GC-I Subpopulation. At 12 month (applying the results from table above), the lumbar spine T-scores 
Assessment report

Page 29/74 
 
  
  
 
 
would end up to approximately -1.64 for the  GC-C Subpopulation and -0.63 for the GC-I Subpopulation. 
This means that the majority of GC-I Subpopulation had normal T-score at 12 months. 
It seems that denosumab increases the T-score irrespectively of the baseline values. The clinical benefits 
of increasing BMD in patients with T-score at normal range in GIOP was discussed further at the ad-hoc 
expert meeting, see section "additional expert advice" in the efficacy discussion. 
In the analyses of the primary endpoint, not only non-inferiority but superiority was shown for 
denosumab versus risedronate and in each subpopulation. Analyses had however only been performed on 
the primary analysis set corresponding to a completers set and a PP analysis set comprising a subset of 
the primary efficacy set. Since superiority has been shown, the PP analyses are of lesser value. Instead, 
analyses based on the Full Analysis Set (all randomised) were requested to confirm the conclusions of 
denosumab being superior to risedronate. In these analyses, missing data should not be ignored but 
handled using methods that could be considered conservative in analyses with the aim to show 
superiority. Several analyses were welcomed using different methods and, in at least one analysis, 
missing data were to be handled as treatment failures. The analyses were to be performed for each 
subpopulation separately.  
Secondary endpoints aimed at superiority and have also been shown. Analogous requested additional 
analyses of the primary endpoint, analyses based on FAS were requested also for the secondary 
endpoint; percent change from baseline in Total Hip BMD at month 12 (separately for each 
subpopulation). 
In response to the analyses as requested above, the MAH performed two different sensitivity analyses of 
the percent change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD and total hip BMD respectively separately in the 
GC-I and GC-C subpopulations; one based on a baseline-observation-carried-forward imputation 
approach, according to the MAH, corresponding to "treatment failure" and, one based on a multiple 
imputation approach within each treatment group. Whilst the former implies more conservative estimates 
the latter is based on an assumption of missing at random in that subjects with missing data is assumed 
to perform as those within the same treatment group who completed/had data month 12.  
Considering the claim that denosumab is superior to risedronate, estimates of treatment efficacy and the 
difference between the treatments should be from an analysis based on all randomised according to the 
intention-to-treat principle; here FAS. Although the use of BOCF implies a decreased variability and it 
may be discussed whether baseline-observation-carried-forward really implies treatment failure in the 
prevention setting, it is considered to offer a more conservative analysis approach than the one used in 
the primary analysis based on observed data excluding those with missing data month 12.

and Treatment in the Glucocorticoid-initiating Subpopulation (ANCOVA Model), Least Squares Means and 
95% Confidence Intervals (Primary Efficacy Analysis Set, Observed Data)(20101217 Final Analysis) 
The percent change from baseline in lumbar spine and total hip BMD at 24 months was greater with 
denosumab treatment than with risedronate treatment in both subpopulations (p < 0.001 in all 
comparisons). The % difference from risendronate continued to increase from 12 to 24 months. 
Of note, most of the patients in the Glucocorticoid-initiating Subpopulation did not have osteoporosis at 
baseline (mean T-score -1.0). Denosumab seemingly increases BMD without a therapeutic plateau in 
individuals treated with corticosteroids with non-osteoporotic BMD at baseline. 
As planned and hence in accordance with the SAP and analogous the primary 12-month analysis, the final 
24-month analyses were based on observed data implying the exclusion of a rather high proportion of 
randomised subjects in each treatment arm in both the GC-I and the GC-C subpopulation. For the claim 
that denosumab is superior to risedronate, estimates of treatment efficacy and the difference between 
the treatments should be from an analysis based on all randomised according to the intention-to-treat 
principle; here FAS. For the primary analyses of the primary endpoint, additional analyses based on the 
Full Analysis Set (all randomised) were requested. An analysis using baseline-observation-carried-forward 
(BOCF) were then considered to offer a more conservative analysis approach than the one used in the 
primary analysis based on observed data excluding those with missing data month 12 and the outcomes 
are presented in the SmPC (section 5.1) accordingly.      
The finally accepted outcomes presented in the SmPC for percentage change from baseline in lumbar 
spine BMD year 1 and year 2 for denosumab and risedronate reflect outcomes from analyses based on 
FAS using baseline-observation-carried-forward.

Exploratory Endpoints 
Other Bone mineral density endpoints 
At month 6, the increase in lumbar spine BMD was significantly greater with denosumab treatment than 
with risedronate treatment in both subpopulations (p < 0.001 for the GC-I subpopulation, p = 0.002 for 
the GC-C subpopulation). Denosumab increased lumbar spine BMD more than did risedronate by 1.4 
percentage points in the GC-I subpopulation and 1.1 percentage points in the GC-C subpopulation. 
For the GC-I subpopulation, denosumab treatment led to significantly greater increases in BMD compared 
with risedronate at the femoral neck (p = 0.02) and the trochanter (p < 0.001).  
In the GC-C subpopulation, denosumab treatment led to significantly greater increases in BMD compared 
with risedronate at the femoral neck (p = 0.004), trochanter (p < 0.001), and 1/3 radius (p = 0.008). 
Bone Turnover Markers 
A At baseline, mean sCTX and P1NP values were similar between treatment groups.  Levels of sCTX 
decreased significantly more with denosumab than with risedronate treatment at day 10 and months 3, 
4, 5, 6, and 12; the difference between treatment groups in percent change from baseline to month 24 
was not statistically significant. Levels of P1NP decreased significantly more with denosumab than with 
risedronate treatment at months 3, 4, 5, 6, and 12; the difference between treatment groups in percent 
change from baseline to day 10 and to month 24 was not statistically significant.

Both denosumab and risendronate show similar pattern of changes in bone-turnover markes over time 
with no significant difference at moth 24. This is in contrast to significant difference seen in BMD.

Biopsies from 10 subjects (3 denosumab, 7 risedronate) were evaluable for histomorphometry.  
As expected, resorption and formation parameters were nominally lower in subjects treated with 
denosumab than risedronate, consistent with a lower rate of bone remodeling.  
Wall thickness and width were slightly but statistically significantly higher in the denosumab-treated 
subjects compared with those treated with risedronate. 
Due to difficulties in recruitment to the substudy and some collected specimens being unevaluable, 
Protocol Amendment 4 added a bone biopsy assessment at 24 months to bring the number of evaluable 
specimens closer to the protocol-indicated number of approximately 30 specimens. 
At month 24, 1 additional biopsy had been obtained for a subject in the denosumab group The additional 
bone biopsy c showed normal bone histology. There was evidence of normal lamellar bone, normal 
mineralization, and normal osteoid. There was no evidence of osteomalacia, marrow fibrosis, woven bone, 
or other clinically significant marrow abnormality. Double label was observed in the trabecular 
compartment for this subject and histomorphometry was consistent with other denosumab-treated 
subjects.

The subject incidence of new radiological vertebral fracture was numerically lower for denosumab 
compared to risendronate, 4.1% vs 5.8%. 
In contrast, both the total number (24 vs 16) and the subject incidence of non-vertebral fractures was 
higher for denosumab compared to risendronate, 5.3% vs 3.8%. 
Most of the non-vertebral fractures occurred in the denosumab treated patients in the Glucocorticoid-
continuing Subpopulation. 
Denosumab was superior to risendronate in both subgroups in increasing BMD but there was no 
correlation with the fracture data and the BMD data in this study, especially regarding non-vertebral 
fractures.

Anti-denosumab Antibody Assays 
One of 394 subjects who received denosumab (0.3%) tested positive for antidenosumab antibodies at 
month 12; the subject tested negative for neutralizing antibodies. This subject was in the GC-C 
subpopulation. No PK samples were collected for this subject so the potential impact on exposure could 
not be assessed.

Bone Mineral Density  
The effect size of the BMD percentage increase at the lumbar spine compared to placebo for 
glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis is somewhat less that observed in the postmenopausal females (PMO) 
DXA substudy but comparable to study in bone loss associated with hormone ablation therapy (HALT) in 
men with prostate cancer.

The LS mean point estimate for the percent change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at month 12 in 
the denosumab group was 3.8% in the GC-I subpopulation and 4.4% in the GC-C subpopulation, 
consistent with the LS mean point estimates at month 12 in Study 20030216 (5.5%) and the 3 
supportive studies (4.3% to 5.7%).

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal trial (2010217) to support the new indication glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis (GIOP) is a 
randomised, double-blind bridging study in patients treated with denosumab 60mg or risedronate Q6M 
for 24 months. The primary analysis at 12 months has been submitted.  
Data from study 20101217 have been compared to results from the 4 pivotal clinical studies that 
supported the primary osteoporosis indication (study 20030216, 7808 women with PMO, basis for 
bridging; study 20080098, 242 men with OP) and the bone loss in subjects undergoing HALT indication 
(study 20040138, 1468 men with bone loss from ADT for nonmetastatic prostate cancer; study 
20040135, 252 women with bone loss after adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy for nonmetastatic 
breast cancer); these trials have been assessed during previous procedures. Trial 20101217 is based on 
the pharmacodynamic endpoint change in BMD which is bridged to the results of the two supportive 
studies with anti-fracture efficacy data for denosumab (study 20030216, osteoporosis in postmenopausal 
women; study 20040138, bone loss associated with hormone ablation in men with prostate cancer).  
The study 20101217 had two separate experimental aims; to assess denosumab efficacy in two different 
subpopulations, the glucocorticoid-initiating subpopulation and the glucocorticoid-continuing 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406583/2018 
Page 42/74 
 
  
  
 
subpopulation respectively. The primary objective in each population was to show non-inferiority in 
percent change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD by DXA at 12 months. The non-inferiority margins 
were -1.1 and -0.7 percentage points for the GC-I and GC-C subpopulation respectively.  
Main analyses were performed separately for each subpopulation (GC-I and GC-C). The primary and 
secondary endpoints, DXA percent change from baseline at month 12 for each skeletal site measured, 
were analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with main effects for treatment, gender, 
baseline BMD, machine type and the interaction effect for baseline BMD and machine type. Although, 
importantly, the primary model was pre-specified, no justification for including each of the covariates was 
found and was to be provided. In their response the MAH justified the choice of primary analysis model 
including machine type and the interaction term by the different scales of baseline BMD between the two 
proprietary technologies (Lunar and Hologic machines) which is accepted. To investigate the robustness 
of the primary analysis, additional analyses were required based on an ANCOVA model with main effects 
for treatment, gender and baseline BMD. They had been provided and showed very similar outcomes 
hereby supporting the robustness of the primary analysis. The definition of the primary efficacy set 
corresponded to a completer analysis set. In addition to the primary efficacy set a PP set was defined to 
be used for additional analyses of the primary endpoint. Considering the definition of the former and that 
the PP was to comprise a subset of the primary efficacy set, the difference between them tended to be 
small having an impact on the significance of the PP analysis as a measure of robustness. A Full Analysis 
Set was pre-defined but was not intended to be used for any analysis of the primary or key secondary 
endpoints. 
The study protocol was amended 4 times; major changes have been summarized. In this summary, the 
wrong number of enrolled subjects was seemingly given at the time point for amendment 1 and/or 2 (167 
and 127 respectively). The dates were also somewhat confusing. Although expected to be of minor 
importance, the MAH has as requested clarified how Table 8-10 (Study 20101217 12-month Primary 
Analysis Clinical Study Report) should be read and thus clarified the issue.   
Within the GC-I subpopulation, the study discontinuation rate was somewhat higher in the denosumab 
group (15.9%) than in the risedronate group (9.7%), which was related to a higher rate of withdrawal of 
consent in the denosumab group. Within the GC-C subpopulation, the study discontinuation rate was 
similar in the denosumab (14.2%) and risedronate (12.3%) groups. The rate of study discontinuations 
due to adverse events was also similar (denosumab 3.6%, risedronate 3.2%). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Non-inferiority on the primary endpoint has been demonstrated; the difference from risedronate in 
change of measured BMD at the lumbar spine from baseline was 2.9% in the patients with glucocorticoid 
treatment <3 months group and 2.2% in the placebo group (n=118).  
Results from the secondary analyses on the change of femoral neck and hip BMD were in line with the 
primary outcome. The 12 months primary analysis of the glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis trial 
(2010217) was not powered to show a statistically significant difference between groups on the reduction 
of osteoporotic fractures. 
The pharmacokinetic data provided in patients with corticosteroids induced osteoporosis do not suggest 
any differences in exposure that would necessitate a dose adjustment in the new proposed indication 
compared to postmenopausal females. 
In the analysis of primary and secondary endpoints only subjects with observed BMD data at baseline and 
at the post-baseline time point of interest were included. In all analyses presented, a non-negligible 
proportion of randomised subjects were excluded; across subpopulations 13-18% in primary analyses and 
approximately 25-30% in analyses based on the PP set. Here, where not only non-inferiority but 
Assessment report

Page 43/74 
 
  
  
superiority has been shown for denosumab versus risedronate and in each subpopulation, analyses based 
on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) comprising all randomised is considered of importance. Analyses based on 
the FAS were hence to be provided to confirm the conclusions of denosumab being superior to 
risedronate. In response the MAH performed two different sensitivity analyses of the percent change from 
baseline in lumbar spine BMD and total hip BMD respectively separately in the GC-I and GC-C 
subpopulations; one based on a baseline-observation-carried-forward imputation approach, that, 
according to the MAH, corresponded to "treatment failure" and, one based on a multiple imputation (MI) 
approach within each treatment group. Although the use of BOCF implies a decreased variability and it 
may be discussed whether baseline-carried-forward really implies treatment failure in the prevention 
setting, it is considered to offer a more conservative analysis approach than the one used in the primary 
analysis based on observed data excluding those with missing data month 12. Regarding the MI 
approach, it is based on an assumption of missing at random in that subjects with missing data is 
assumed to perform as those within the same treatment group who completed/had data month 12. These 
analyses are therefore not considered to provide sufficiently conservative estimates.  In the MI analyses 
the outcomes were identical compared to the primary analysis. For the claim that denosumab is superior 
to risedronate, estimates of treatment efficacy and the difference between the treatments should be from 
an analysis based on all randomised subjects according to the intention-to-treat principle (FAS) using a 
method for handling of missing data that can be considered to be sufficiently conservative (e.g. treatment 
failure imputation).   For the claim of denosumab being superior to risedronate with regard to increases in 
BMD, the MAH therefore performed on request of the CHMP additional analyses based on FAS and BOCF. 
Data based on these more conservative analyses are therefore provided in section 5.1 of the SmPC to 
reflect the outcomes (denosumab demonstrated a greater increase in lumbar spine BMD compared to 
risedronate in the glucocorticoid-continuing subpopulation at 1 year: denosumab 3.6 %, risedronate 
2.0%; p < 0.001, and 2 years: denosumab 4.5%, risedronate 2.2%; p < 0.001, as well as in the 
glucocorticoid-initiating subpopulation at 1 year: denosumab 3.1 %, risedronate 0.8%; p < 0.001, and 2 
years: denosumab 4.6%, risedronate 1.5%; p < 0.001). 
Relationship between increase in bone mineral density and decrease in risk of fracture 
Study 20030216 in postmenopausal women demonstrated that increases in BMD with denosumab 60 mg 
Q6M are associated with an absolute risk reduction of new radiological vertebral fractures: 1.4% at 1 
year, 3.5% at 2 years and 4.8% at 3 years. 
For clinical fractures, an absolute risk reduction of 2.9% over 3 years was seen in study 20030216.  
Study 20040138 in bone loss associated with androgen deprivation demonstrated decreases in risk of 
radiological vertebral fracture; denosumab demonstrated a significant relative risk reduction of new 
radiological vertebral fractures: 1.6% absolute risk reduction at 1 year, 2.2% at 2 years and 2.4% at 3 
years.   
Additional expert consultation 
CHMP requested an ad hoc expert meeting to obtain the opinion of experts in the field of bone 
metabolism and osteoporosis, as well as from a patient representative. Questions were addressed to the 
ad hoc expert group. The questions and the corresponding answers are presented below: 
General questions 
1. Please discuss how to identify the optimal study population for the assessment of a medicinal product 
intended for the prevention/treatment of GIOP 
a. 
What is the minimum dose and duration of treatment with glucocorticoids that would warrant 
treatment with a medicinal product for the prevention/treatment of GIOP? 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406583/2018 
Page 44/74 
 
  
  
For the purpose of clinical trials seeking an approval for GIOP, the experts found the commonly used 
threshold of ≥ 7.5 mg prednisone equivalent per day and the intended or actual use over at least 3 
months reasonable. As threshold for treatment intervention in clinical practice, however, daily doses 
below 7.5 mg prednisone equivalent may be relevant in certain patients. A start of treatment for GIOP 
once the patient is being exposed to glucocorticoids (GCs) was also seen as relevant. 
b. 
Is there a need for pharmacological intervention in patients without osteoporosis and at low risk 
of fracture at baseline who initiate glucocorticoid therapy? 
Inclusion of patients in such studies and start of treatment in practice needs to not only rely on absence 
or presence of osteoporosis (as defined by T-score) but on overall recognition of an increased risk of 
fracture of the patient; thresholds for such interventions are defined, with some variability, in various 
clinical treatment guidelines, which may also guide study designs. The risk for instance in premenopausal 
women starting on GCs without any other risk factors may be low and may not require treatment. In any 
case, treatment and determination of the fracture risk in premenopausal women in clinical practice is 
often done on an individual basis. 
c. 
Is it possible and/or necessary to distinguish the prevention of GIOP from the treatment of GIOP?  
It would appear that “prevention” (defined as e.g. GC exposure < 3 months) and “treatment” populations 
(e.g. GC exposure ≥ 3 months) may present different stages of a continuum and such a separation may 
not be necessary, as treatment intervention would be rather based on fracture risk  and moreover should, 
when indicated, be initiated early. Rapid bone loss occurs mostly during first months after the start of GC 
therapy, which is of relevance when considering study designs for this indication. 
2. 
Some products for the prevention/treatment of GIOP have relied on bridging strategies using 
active comparator-controlled trials. Can sufficient sensitivity of the studies be assumed obviating the need 
for a concurrent placebo control with regards to BMD as well as fracture efficacy? 
The experts were of the view that placebo-controlled RCTs, while in principle preferable, are not feasible 
for GIOP trials and therefore comparator-controlled trials will be required. 
3. 
From a safety point of view, is a clinical study in GIOP of one year duration sufficient? (two years 
required in PMO). Is it reasonable to require long-term safety follow-up in GIOP (3-5 years required for 
PMO) after approval? 
While a one year study regarding efficacy might be sufficient, this was considered not long enough for 
safety purposes, as e.g. ONJ may manifest only after a couple of years; the experts therefore 
recommended that after completion of the study phase, a follow-up of the patients with regard to safety 
aspects should be strongly recommended. 
Product-specific questions 
1. 
Were the criteria for selecting patients for the denosumab glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis 
(GIOP) trial appropriate, in particular the proposed distinction between prevention and treatment of 
GIOP?  
The experts found the patient selection for the pivotal study overall adequate (based on known relevant 
risk factors including previous fracture history, age, BMD) and close to, or more restrictive, compared 
with existing treatment intervention guidelines. The exception is the population of premenopausal 
women, as these represented only a very small group (7.5 – 13.5% in various treatment groups of the 
study population), included few women younger than 40 years, and overall might represent a population 
of heterogeneous fracture risk. The study population was more restrictively selected compared to earlier 
GIOP studies with risedronate, but that was found to be adequate. It was acknowledged that certain 
exclusion criteria (such as advanced stages of renal impairment due to limitations of the comparator 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406583/2018 
Page 45/74 
 
  
  
product) did restrict the study population compared to the currently approved SmPC for Prolia. As GCs 
are often used for certain renal diseases, a need for more data on denosumab use in in systemic steroid 
users (i.e. patients with GIOP) and severely impaired renal function was mentioned. Rapid bone loss 
occurs mostly during first months after the start of GC therapy. With regard to the distinction between 
“prevention” vs. “treatment” see response to general question 1 c.  
2. 
Is it possible in the framework of a clinical trial to distinguish GIOP from other causes of 
osteoporosis in patients that have been treated with glucocorticoids for more than 3 months/6 months/12 
months? 
(see response to question 3, below) 
3. 
Fracture risk in patients treated with glucocorticoids may not be as strongly correlated with bone 
mineral density as in postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO). Can a given change in BMD in patients at risk 
for GIOP that is comparable to patients with established postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) inform on a 
reduced fracture risk in the population at risk of GIOP? 
The extent to which maintenance or improvement of bone mineral density (BMD) can predict a reduction 
of fracture rates in patients with PMO cannot simply be assumed to be similar in patients with GIOP, for 
the following reasons: 1) Underlying pathomechanisms of osteoporosis in PMO and GIOP are largely 
different, e.g. GCs have distinct effects at different times of exposure on osteoclast, osteoblast and 
osteocyte activity, compared to the PMO setting; 2) changes of bone structure as compared to bone 
mineral density may contribute more to bone fragility in GIOP than in PMO; 3) while some data on the 
relationship of BMD changes and fracture rates are available from placebo-controlled therapeutic 
interventions e.g. with risedronate, those data may not be directly translateable for denosumab, due to 
the different mechanism of action and potency; and 4) experience from BMD/fracture relationship with 
teriparatide, as another product approved for GIOP, is also not comparable to denosumab, due to very 
different mechanisms of action.  
In the experts’ view, this makes any such extrapolation between different forms of osteoporosis and 
different agents with different mechanism of action not straight forward. On the other hand, the experts 
acknowledged the large size of trials which would be needed for a non-inferiority RCT with clinical 
fractures as primary outcome. It was also acknowledged, that osteoporosis in GIOP is rarely due to GC 
excess alone, as a number of other pathogenic components are also often important, in particular most 
patients are > 50 years with a postmenopausal scenario in women and some level of testosterone-
deficiency in older men. Therefore, increased bone fragility in this setting often involves a mix of causes 
of osteoporosis other than GIOP alone, allowing the assumption that some extrapolation of BMD changes 
being associated with a reduced fracture rate in PMO to GIOP could be justified. 
Of some concern were the fracture data from the pivotal study: While the number of vertebral fractures 
was balanced between treatment with denosumab (n=14) and risedronate (n=17), there was an 
unexpected numerical imbalance for non-vertebral fractures (n=20 for denosumab; n=10 for 
risedronate); it was acknowledged, that the study was not powered for fracture outcomes, the numbers 
are very small, and the imbalance may well be a chance finding in the view of some experts; however, it 
still was of some concern to some experts, potentially warranting a longer than 1 year observation of 
those fracture outcomes. Two-year data will be available in a few months’ time, according to the MAH 
representatives present in the first half of the meeting. 
4. 
Can BMD data generated in postmenopausal women that initiate treatment with glucocorticoids 
be extrapolated to premenopausal women and men in order to infer efficacy as regards fracture 
prevention?  
The number of premenopausal women (and men < 50 years) in the pivotal trial was very small 
(participants < 50 years: 7.8 - 8.8 % in various groups). Even though there may have been a BMD 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406583/2018 
Page 46/74 
 
  
  
improvement in this subpopulation consistent with the group of postmenopausal women, the very small 
number in the study does not allow firm conclusions. The experts had also some concerns with the 
reliability of fracture risk estimates of this subpopulation of the study. It is acknowledged, that data on 
premenopausal women is also scarce in other GIOP studies, such as for risedronate. While it is therefore 
difficult to draw any conclusions for this subpopulation from this study, the experts pointed out, that 
there are cases of (unmet) need for treatment of premenopausal women on GCs considered at high risk 
of fracture. 
Men did comprise ca. 30% of the participants of the pivotal study. The observed change in BMD in the 
study may support to some extent the assumption of efficacy with regard to fracture prevention in men, 
particularly older men (see also response to question 3, above), but cannot directly be deduced from the 
data. The experts pointed out that in men on hormone ablative therapy an association between BMD and 
the frequency of vertebral fractures has been shown with denosumab treatment, but such a comparison 
is limited by the different nature of the underlying mechanism of bone loss in the two scenarios.  
5. and 6. 
Patients with long-term concomitant treatment with glucocorticoids may be at increased 
risk for certain safety concerns related to denosumab such as infections, atypical fractures, delayed 
fracture union and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). What would be the required study duration to exclude 
an increased risk?  
ONJ is an identified risk for denosumab in PMO and concomitant corticosteroid use is an additional risk 
factor. Patients with a history of tooth extraction or other dental surgery within the prior 6 months or 
invasive dental work planned in the next 2 years were excluded from the current denosumab GIOP study. 
Is the current Prolia product information sufficient to minimise this risk in the GIOP population? 
The experts pointed out that ONJ often develops only several years after initiation of anti-resorptive 
therapy in PMO setting. Therefore capturing these events only within 1 or 2 years of study time is 
considered insufficient and additional post study surveillance for this was advocated. In principle, 
underlying disease states and co-medication such as MTX might increase the risk for ONJ, increase the 
risk of predisposing infections and may mask them, etc. The experts noted one (positively adjudicated) 
case of atypical fracture of the femur, thus not allowing relevant conclusions. While some proposal for 
enhanced risk mitigation, such as dental examination before initiation of therapy, was made, others were 
of the view that there was too little data to justify that, in particular as the product might only be 
prescribed short term for temporary GC use, considering the importance of rapid intervention, and as ONJ 
is still a very low-frequency event with low dose denosumab use. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Data from the 12-month primary analysis period of study 20101217 showed that at 12 months 
denosumab was non-inferior to risedronate in percent change of BMD from baseline at the lumbar spine 
in both the GC-I and the GC-C subpopulation of the study. Furthermore treatment with denosumab led to 
a significantly higher percent increase from baseline in BMD at the lumbar spine and total hip compared 
with risedronate. Subgroup analyses of the BMD change from baseline at the lumbar spine also indicated 
a greater increase in subjects on denosumab compared to risedronate; the effects were seen both in pre- 
and postmenopausal women. Exploratory analyses of BMD changes from baseline to month 6 at the 
lumbar spine and to month 12 at the femoral neck, trochanter, and 1/3 radius, each performed for GC-I 
and GC-C subpopulations, consistently showed that increases were higher in subjects treated with 
denosumab than with risedronate, except for 1/3 radius in the GC-I subpopulation. 
Values of the bone turnover markers sCTX and P1NP decreased statistically significantly more with 
denosumab than with risedronate at months 3, 4, 5, and 6, but not at month 12. Serum CTX was also 
significantly decreased compared with risedronate on day 10.

The primary analysis of Study 20101217 conducted at 12 months showed that the subject incidence of 
new vertebral fracture was numerically lower (2.7% [95% CI: 1.2, 5.1] versus 3.2% [95% CI: 1.6, 5.7]), 
and the subject incidence of non-vertebral fracture was numerically higher (4.3% [95% CI: 2.5, 6.8] 
versus 2.5% [95% CI: 1.2, 4.6]), in the denosumab compared with the risedronate group. 
The final analysis conducted at 24 months showed that the subject incidence of new vertebral fracture 
continued to be numerically lower in the denosumab group compared with the risedronate group (4.1% 
[95% CI: 2.3, 6.9] versus 5.8%. [95% CI: 3.6, 8.8]), and the subject incidence of non-vertebral fracture 
continued to be numerically higher between the 2 treatment groups (5.3% [95% CI: 3.3, 8.0] versus 
3.8% [95% CI: 2.1, 6.2]). The number of non-vertebral fractures was 24 versus 16 in the denosumab 
versus risedronate group, respectively. 
The vast majority (>90%) of the patients in the study were treated with GC for >6 months. Overall, 44% 
continued GC at month 24. Most of the patients who discontinued GC treatment continued with the IP 
treatment. In contrast, antiresorptive treatment for GIOP is discontinued when GC treatment is 
discontinued in clinical practice. The increase in bone resorption in GIOP occurs early and is transient, 
which would implicate that the need of antiresorptive therapy is also limited in time. It is difficult to draw 
any conclusions regarding optimal treatment duration from the current study design. This needs to be 
based on individual patients BMD and other risk factors for fracture. 
For bridging the results of study 20101217 on the surrogate parameter change in BMD from baseline to 
12 months with the anti-fracture efficacy of denosumab the applicant has provided a comparison with 
data from previous trials including studies with fracture endpoints. When compared, in all 5 studies 
denosumab led to significantly higher increases in BMD compared to the control groups at all skeletal 
sites investigated with the exception of the 1/3 radius in the GC-I subpopulation of the GIOP study 
20101217. The effect of denosumab on mean increases in BMD observed in GC-C and GC-I 
subpopulations of study 20101217 are considered generally comparable to the effects seen in the 
previous trials. Since BMD increases were associated with fracture risk reduction in pivotal osteoporosis 
studies 20030216 and 20040138, and BMD increases within the same range of the above were observed 
in Study 20101217, it could be reasonable to extrapolate the antifracture efficacy of denosumab 60 mg 
Q6M to subjects with GIOP, at least regarding radiological vertebral fractures in patients at increased risk 
of fractures and who are treated with corticosteroids >1 years.

A total of 778 subjects comprised the safety analysis set (denosumab, 394; risedronate, 384). Overall, 
85.0% of subjects in the denosumab group received both the day 1 and month 6 doses, and 80.5% of 
subjects randomized to risedronate received ≥ 80% of oral risedronate doses.

Atypical femoral fracture 
One subject in the denosumab group and no subject in the risedronate group had positively adjudicated 
atypical femoral fracture (preferred term: femur fracture). The event occurred approximately 2 months 
after the second dose of SC investigational product and approximately 8 months into the QD oral 
investigational product administration in a subject with a long history of receiving glucocorticoid therapy. 
The subject had no history of bisphosphonate or proton pump inhibitor use and reported only 1 previous 
fracture. The MAH was asked to calculate the incidence of AFF in study 20101217 and compare the 
incidence with the number from previous clinical trials and from the literature. The exposure-adjusted 
subject incidence rate (IR) of atypical femoral fracture in study 20101217 (276.5 events per 
100 000 patient-years) was higher than in previous denosumab osteoporosis studies in patients without 
previous antiresoptive treatment (< 100 events per 100 000 patient-years).  
Higher incidence rates were seen in Study 20110153 that enrolled subjects with previous bisphosphate 
use (630.7 events per 100 000 patient-years) and bisphosphate (zoledronic acid) (314.1 events per 
100 000 patient-years). 
Hypocalcaemia 
One subject (0.3%) in the denosumab group had hypocalcaemia with CTCAE grade ≥ 2 (corrected serum 
calcium < 2.0 mmol/L). This subject’s corrected calcium had decreased from 2.25 mmol/L at day 1 to 
1.60 mmol/L (grade 3 hypocalcaemia) on day 12.  
Malignancies 
Recently, a small but statistically significant in new primary malignancies has been identified in 
populations with advanced cancer treated with higher doses of denosumab (xgeva vs zolendronic acid). 
No imbalances were seen in pivotal Prolia studies.  A small numerical imbalance was noted in this study. 
Systemic glucocorticoids are potent immunosuppressants and these patients may have increased cancer 
risk. However, the number of cases from this study (12 vs 7) is small. 
Laboratory findings 
Albumin-corrected calcium 
Mean calcium values decreased slightly in both treatment groups postbaseline; the mean decrease from 
baseline at day 10 was slightly more pronounced in the denosumab group (-2.51%) than in the 
risedronate group (-0.75%)

Mean decreases from baseline in alkaline phosphatase were observed at month 6 and month 12 in both 
treatment groups, and were more pronounced in the denosumab group than in the risedronate group. 
Mean change from baseline to month 6 was -12.128% in the denosumab group, compared with -4.18% 
in the risedronate group; and mean change from baseline to month 12 was -8.51% in the denosumab

Safety in special populations 
Data on safety in special populations are limited to subgroup analyses by gender. Overall, the subject 
incidence of AEs and SAEs in the GIOP population in study 20101217 was consistent with that observed in 
the primary osteoporosis and HALT populations during the first 12 months of the studies in both women 
and men.  
Safety in patients with renal impairment 
Patients with severe renal impairment (Cockcroft-Gault formula of ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) were not 
included in the trial. These patients are at increased risk of adverse events such as hypocalcaemia 
associated with denosumab, and the risk is likely increased in patients with concomitant glucocorticoid 
treatment. The MAH was asked to summarize safety data for patients with moderate renal impairment 
(GFR 30-60 mL/min/1.73 m2) in GIOP study 20101217:

Table. Treatment-emergent Fatal Adverse Events by Preferred Term for Subjects with Baseline eGFR 30-
60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Safety Analysis Set) (20101217 Final Analysis) 
In the subgroup of patients with GFR 30-60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (N=135); the safety profile was numerically 
in favour of risendronate. Serious adverse events occurred with risendronate 27% vs denosumab 32%. 
Fatal events occurred with risendronate 3.3% vs denosumab 11%. Hypocalcaemia was not reported as a 
preferred term as a serious or fatal AE. 
No data is available for patients with severe renal impairment (GFR ≤ 30) and concomitant denosumab 
and glucocorticoid treatment. Risendronate and other bisphosphonates are contraindicated in patients 
with GFR ≤ 30. In clinical practice, if approved for GIOP, denosumab could be considered to be the first-
line treatment for these patients, although not studied. The absence of safety data in patiens with GFR ≤ 
30 has been now included in the SmPC as well as an amendment to the 4.4: “Concomitant glucocorticoid 
treatment is an additional risk factor for hypocalcaemia.” 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No relevant safety information related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions has been provided. 
This is considered acceptable based on the available data from previous trials. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall, 25 subjects (6.3%) in the denosumab group and 29 subjects (7.6%) in the risedronate group 
discontinued investigational product due to adverse events 
The most frequent events leading to investigational product discontinuation in the denosumab group were 
dyspepsia and abdominal distension. 
A total of 13 subjects (3.3%) in the denosumab group and 14 subjects (3.6%) in the risedronate group 
discontinued investigational product due to adverse events considered related to investigational product. 
All of the cases of dyspepsia, abdominal pain upper and abdominal distension were considered related to 
investigational product.

Safety data compared to approved PMO and HALT indications 
In the pivotal PMO study 20030216, 3 years duration: 
Serious adverse events were reported for 25.8% of subjects in the denosumab group and 25.1% of 
subjects in the placebo group. SOCs with the highest subject incidences of adverse events in the 
denosumab group were cardiac disorders (5.0% denosumab, 4.1% placebo), musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (4.2% denosumab, 3.8% placebo), neoplasms benign, malignant and 
unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) (4.1% denosumab, 3.6% placebo), infections and infestations (4.1% 
denosumab, 3.4% placebo), and gastrointestinal disorders (3.7% denosumab, 2.7% placebo). 
Pivotal HALT study: 
In the Serious adverse events were reported for 34.6% of subjects in the denosumab group and 30.6% 
of subjects in the placebo group. The most commonly affected organ classes were denosumab, placebo) 
being cardiac disorders (9.4% denosumab, 10.3% placebo), nervous system disorders (6.8% 
denosumab, 4.8%), infections and infestations (5.9% denosumab, 4.6% placebo), and neoplasms (5.1% 
denosumab 5.8% placebo). 
Of note, these studies had a placebo group, the current study 20101217 had risendronate as an active 
comparator. 
Adverse events of hypocalcaemia do not show significant differences between groups and indications 
investigated. There was no case of adjudicated positive osteonecrosis of the jaw during the first 12 
months of any of these studies. However, the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw increases with denosumab 
treatment duration. There were cases of hypersensitivity related adverse events in study 20101217 and 
the incidence was higher in the denosumab than in the risedronate group. The incidence of 
hypersensitivity related adverse events with denosumab was comparable to that seen in previous trials. 
The analysis of adverse events of serious infection in study 20101217 indicated comparable subject 
incidences between denosumab and risedronate groups both for overall adverse events of infection and 
for serious infections; in both groups the incidence of serious infections was higher than in the two other 
indications which is considered in line with underlying medical conditions and concomitant therapies. 
Safety data on adverse events of serious bacterial cellulitis did not indicate relevant differences between 
groups and are considered to be in line with previous findings. The subject incidence of adverse events of 
malignancies was comparable between groups and in line with previous findings. The subject incidences 
of adverse events of cardiac as well as vascular disorders in study 20101217 were comparable between 
groups; the incidence of cardiac disorders was in line with previous findings, while the incidence of 
vascular disorders (cerebrovascular disorders not included here) was higher in the previous osteoporosis 
and HALT studies than in the GIOP trial. There was 1 case of adjudicated positive atypical femoral 
fracture in the denosumab versus none in the risedronate group in the GIOP study. No atypical femoral 
fractures were reported during the first year in the previous studies. The analysis of adverse events of 
eczema or pancreatitis did not indicate relevant new findings in study 20101217. In study 20101217, the 
subject incidence of adverse events of musculoskeletal pain was comparable between groups, but lower 
than in previous trials in the primary osteoporosis and HALT populations. The incidence of subjects with a 
laboratory parameter with toxicity grade ≥3 abnormality was higher in the GIOP than the primary 
osteoporosis and HALT population, consistent with the underlying medical condition of the subjects. 
Safety data on albumin-adjusted serum calcium, phosphorus levels and alkaline phosphatase were in line 
with data from previous studies. In study 20101217 only 1 positive result for binding anti-denosumab 
antibodies was seen in a patients on denosumab. So far no neutralising antibodies have been reported in 
any denosumab clinical trial.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In general, the safety profile for denosumab in the current glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis study did 
not markedly differ from that in female (postmenopausal) osteoporosis studies, where safety evaluation is 
based on larger numbers and longer observation periods. 
The total number of serious adverse events, treatment related adverse events and discontinuations were 
balanced between the treatment groups. Hypersensitivity and bacterial cellulitis were numerically more 
frequent in the denosumab arm. One hypocalcaemia and one adjudicated atypical femur fracture occurred 
in the denosumab arm compared to none in the risendronate group. All these are identified risks for 
denosumab.  
The study was smaller and shorter (primary analysis at 12 months, final analysis at 24 months than PMO 
and HALT studies (three years) which is a limitation for the safety evaluation in the corticosteroid induced 
osteoporosis population. On the other hand, in clinical practice, the goal is to the scale down the GC 
exposure as soon as possible and concomitant antiresorptive treatment is also often limited in time.  
Corticosteroid use is a known risk factor for ONJ and rigorous exclusion criteria regarding dental health 
were applied in the current study. “Corticosteroids” is included as a risk factor for ONJ in the current 
Prolia SmPC.  No further SmPC changes are require at this time point. The risk will be closely monitored 
in subsequent PSURs. 
Corticosteroid treatment is considered as a risk factor for atypical fractures. At the time of the latest 
PSUR, there had been 5 positively adjudicated atypical femoral fracture cases in clinical trials with Prolia.. 
In the current relatively small and short study 20101217, there were two femoral fractures in the safety 
analysis set reported for denosumab vs none in risendronate, indicating a possibly higher incidence in this 
population treated with denosumab. One of the cases was positively adjudicated as AFF.  
In the study 20101217 12-month Primary Analysis, there were two deaths in the denosumab group due 
to cerebrovascular cause. While a numerically higher number of cerebrovascular SAEs were observed in 
denosumab treated subjects in the GIOP study, the number of cases was limited. The issue will be 
followed in PSURs.  
The MAH has previously conducted a study in the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis. A total of 227 
subjects were enrolled and randomized and 203 (89%) completed the 12-month treatment period, last 
visit occurred in 2007. RA is not a labelled indication for denosumab. Safety results from study 20040144 
(Multi-dose Phase 2 Study in the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis) have been reviewed by the CHMP. 
No new signal was identified during the 12 month treatment period (two doses given at baseline and at 
month 6).  The incidence of RA flares during the off-treatment period 12-24 months appeared to be 
higher in the denosumab-treated groups. This difference, however, was not considered to reflect a higher 
incidence of RA flares following denosumab discontinuation, but is the result of an unexpectedly lower 
incidence of RA flares in the off-treatment, as compared to the on-treatment, period among subjects 
previously exposed to placebo. 
In the subgroup of patients with GFR 30-60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (N=135) serious adverse events occurred 
with risendronate in 27% vs denosumab in 32%. Fatal events occurred with risendronate in 3.3% vs 
denosumab in 11%. Hypocalcaemia was not reported as a preferred term as a serious or fatal AE. 
Patients with severe renal impairment (Cockcroft-Gault formula of ≤  30 mL/min/1.73 m2) were not 
included in the trial. There was no available safety data for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 
≤ 30 and concomitant glucocorticoid treatment) from other denosumab studies, as other denosumab 
studies have included too few patients with both renal impairment and concomitant glucocorticoid use. 
This vulnerable group may be at increased risk of adverse events.  The absence of safety data in patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406583/2018 
Page 61/74 
 
  
  
with GFR ≤ 30 is included in the SmPC and section 4.4 has been amended in order to highlight an 
increased risk (eg, “Concomitant glucocorticoid treatment is an additional risk factor for hypocalcaemia”) 
Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity. SmPC section 4.6 has been updated to include 
information on contraception and that women should be advised not to become pregnant for at least 5 
months after treatment with Prolia, which is in line with the current recommendations for Xgeva. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In general, the safety profile for denosumab in the current GIOP study did not markedly differ from the 
previous studies; safety data up to 24 months has been evaluated and specific information added to the 
SmPC.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.6 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. 
In addition, changes related to section 4.4 of the SmPC have been updated with regard to warnings for 
excipients. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
SmPC section 4.1 has been revised as follows (new text in bold):

"Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fractures. 
In postmenopausal women Prolia significantly reduces the risk of vertebral, non-vertebral and hip 
fractures. 
Treatment of bone loss associated with hormone ablation in men with prostate cancer at 
increased risk of fractures (see section 5.1). In men with prostate cancer receiving hormone 
ablation, Prolia significantly reduces the risk of vertebral fractures. 
Treatment of bone loss associated with long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy in 
adult patients at increased risk of fracture (see section 5.1)." 
For the other changes of the SmPC see Attachment 1. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Favourable effects 
The pivotal trial (2010217) to support the new indication glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis (GIOP) is a 
randomised, double-blind bridging study in patients treated with denosumab 60mg (N=398)  or 
risedronate Q6M (N=397) for 24 months.  Subjects who had initiated administration of prednisone or 
equivalent within 3 months or   ≥  3 months before screening were part of the GC-I subpopulation 
(N=290) or GC-C subpopulation (N=505), respectively. The primary analysis was performed at 12 
months.  
Non-inferiority on the primary endpoint has been demonstrated; in the glucocorticoid-continuing 
subpopulation, denosumab demonstrated an increase in lumbar spine BMD compared to risedronate at 1 
year (denosumab 4.4%, risedronate 2.3%; p < 0.001) and 2 years (denosumab 6.4%, risedronate 3.2%; 
p < 0.001). In the glucocorticoid-initiating subpopulation, denosumab demonstrated an increase in 
lumbar spine BMD compared to risedronate at 1 year (denosumab 3.8%, risedronate 0.8%; p < 0.001) 
and 2 years (denosumab 6.2%, risedronate 1.7%; p < 0.001).  
For the claim of denosumab being superior to risedronate with regard to increases in BMD, the MAH 
performed on request of the CHMP additional analyses based on all randomised subjects according to the 
intention-to-treat principle (FAS) using a method for handling of missing data which ensures a sufficiently 
conservative estimate, based on FAS and BOCF. Data based on these more conservative analyses are 
therefore provided in section 5.1 of the SmPC to reflect the outcomes (denosumab demonstrated a 
greater increase in lumbar spine BMD compared to risedronate in the glucocorticoid-continuing 
subpopulation at 1 year: denosumab 3.6 %, risedronate 2.0%; p < 0.001, and 2 years: denosumab 
4.5%, risedronate 2.2%; p < 0.001, as well as in the glucocorticoid-initiating subpopulation at 1 year: 
denosumab 3.1 %, risedronate 0.8%; p < 0.001, and 2 years: denosumab 4.6%, risedronate 1.5%; 
p < 0.001). 
Results from the secondary analyses on the change of femoral neck and hip BMD were in line with the 
primary outcome.

The pharmacokinetic data provided in patients with GIOP do not suggest any differences in exposure that 
would necessitate a dose adjustment in the new proposed indication compared to postmenopausal 
females. 
3.2.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The study was not powered in order to demonstrate non-inferiority/superiority in fracture endpoints. The 
primary analysis conducted at 12 months showed that the subject incidence of new vertebral fracture was 
numerically lower (2.7% [95% CI: 1.2, 5.1] versus 3.2% [95% CI: 1.6, 5.7]), and the subject incidence 
of non-vertebral fracture was numerically higher (4.3% [95% CI: 2.5, 6.8] versus 2.5% [95% CI: 1.2, 
4.6]), in the denosumab group compared with the risedronate group. A total of 20 nonvertebral fractures 
occurred in the denosumab group vs 10 in the risendronate group. Most of the fractures occurred in the 
GC-C subpopulation, as expected. 
The final analysis conducted at 24 months showed that the subject incidence of new vertebral fracture 
continued to be numerically lower in the denosumab group compared with the risedronate group (4.1% 
[95% CI: 2.3, 6.9] versus 5.8%. [95% CI: 3.6, 8.8]), and the subject incidence of non-vertebral fracture 
continued to be numerically higher between the 2 treatment groups (5.3% [95% CI: 3.3, 8.0] versus 
3.8% [95% CI: 2.1, 6.2]). The number of non-vertebral fractures was 24 versus 16 in the denosumab 
versus risedronate group, respectively. 
The number of premenopausal women (and men < 50 years) in the pivotal trial was very small 
(participants < 50 years: 7.8 - 8.8 % in various groups). 
In clinical practice, the goal is to the scale down the GC exposure as soon as possible. The current study 
was not designed to investigate the optimal duration of treatment for GIOP and outcomes after GC 
discontinuation.  
3.3.  Unfavourable effects 
In general, the safety profile for denosumab in the current corticoid-induced osteoporosis study did not 
markedly differ from that in the postmenopausal osteoporosis studies, where safety evaluation is based 
on larger numbers and longer observation periods. 
The total number of serious adverse events, treatment related adverse events and discontinuations were 
balanced between the treatment groups. Hypersensitivity cases with 25 (6.3%) vs 18 (4.7%) and 
bacterial cellulitis with 7 (1.8%) vs 2 (0.5%) were numerically more frequent in the denosumab arm at 
both timepoints of 12 and 24 months. One hypocalcaemia event and one adjudicated atypical femur 
fracture occurred in the denosumab arm compared to none in the risendronate group. All these are 
already identified risks for denosumab.  
3.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The study was smaller and shorter (primary analysis at 12 months, final analysis at 24 months) than PMO 
and HALT studies (three years) which is a limitation for the safety evaluation in the GIOP population. On 
the other hand, in clinical practice, the goal is to scale down the GC exposure as soon as possible and 
concomitant antiresorptive treatment is also often limited in time.  
There is no available safety data for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR ≤ 30) and concomitant 
glucocorticoid treatment.

Corticosteroid use is a known risk factor for ONJ and rigorous exclusion criteria regarding dental health 
were applied in the current study. “Corticosteroids” is included as a risk factor for ONJ in the current 
Prolia SmPC.  No further SmPC changes are require at this time point. The risk will be closely monitored 
in subsequent PSURs. 
Corticosteroid treatment is considered as a risk factor for atypical fractures. At the time of the latest 
PSUR, there had been 5 positively adjudicated atypical femoral fracture cases in clinical trials with Prolia. 
In the current relatively small and short study 20101217, there were two femoral fractures in the safety 
analysis set reported for denosumab vs none for risendronate, indicating a higher incidence in this 
population treated with denosumab. One of the cases was positively adjudicated as AFF.  
In the 12-month Primary Analysis of study 20101217, there were two deaths in the denosumab group 
due to cerebrovascular cause. While a numerically higher number of cerebrovascular SAEs were observed 
in denosumab treated subjects in the GIOP study, the number of cases was limited. The issue will be 
followed in PSURs.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance and balance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Although glucocorticoids are effectively being used in the management of many inflammatory conditions, 
their use is associated with significant adverse outcomes. Osteoporosis, with resultant fractures, 
constitutes one of these. A rapid decline in bone mineral density (BMD) begins typically within the first 3 
months of glucocorticoid use and peaks at 6 months, followed by a slower phase. An increased risk of 
both vertebral and nonvertebral fractures has been reported. However, there has been some controversy 
regarding the dose of glucocorticoid treatment at which an increased risk of fracture occurs.

Postmenopausal women and elderly men are at a higher risk for developing glucocorticoid-induced bone 
loss and fractures. 
Efficacy in fracture risk reduction is regarded as the most relevant endpoint for osteoporosis treatment 
trials. Changes in BMD correlate to the decrease in fracture risk. For men with osteoporosis, BMD 
measurement at 12 months is considered a valid surrogate endpoint in bridging studies according the 
Guideline of new medicinal products in the treatment of primary osteoporosis (CPMP/EWP/552/95 Rev.2). 
This guideline does not specifically describe requirements for an approval of treatment of 
glucocorticosteroid induced osteoporosis; however, similar indications have been approved based on this 
type of data extrapolation (for example with  the centrally authorised product zoledronic acid). BMD 
increases with denosumab were associated with fracture risk reduction in the previous pivotal studies 
20030216 and 20040138, and BMD increases within the same range were now observed in Study 
20101217. 
Treatment with denosumab increase BMD T-score in the studied population and  in the pivotal study the 
effect was more pronounced compared to risedronate.  However, the adequacy of extrapolating benefits 
with respect to reduction of fracture risk from the PMO population to the GIOP population may not be 
straight forward considering that underlying pathomechanisms of osteoporosis are to some extent 
different. However, GIOP and PMO also share a number of characteristics with respect to the cellular 
pathophysiology of bone loss. Increased bone turnover occurs in both conditions, even though it differs in 
its time course. This justification supports that the increase of BMD T-score is expected to translate into a 
reduced risk of fractures also in the GIOP scenario.  
Some data on the relationship of BMD changes and vertebral fracture rates are also available from 
placebo-controlled therapeutic interventions in the target population e.g. with risedronate. Although it can 
be questioned if data for risendronate can be extrapolated to denosumab considering different 
mechanisms of action,  both are anti-resorptive treatments and it is not plausible that that the different 
mechanisms would lead to substantial differences in the ability to prevent fractures. 
One uncertainty with respect to the effect on prevention of fractures is the imbalance in non-vertebral 
fractures seen in the pivotal study with numerically more fractures occurring in the denosumab group 
compared to risendronate. However, the study was not designed with adequate statistical power to detect 
similarity/difference in the incidence of fractures between treatment groups. Further, denosumab was 
superior to risedorante concerning increase of BMD T-score and there was no imbalance in the incidence 
of vertebral fractures. 
Start of treatment in practice does not only rely on absence or presence of osteoporosis (as defined by T-
score) but on overall recognition of an increased risk of fracture of the patient. In order to start 
treatment, a commonly used threshold of ≥ 7.5 mg prednisone equivalent per day and the intended or 
actual use over at least 3 months is generally considered reasonable. An early and transient increase in 
bone resorption in GIOP occurs against a background of low bone turnover with reduced bone formation. 
A start of treatment for GIOP once the patient is being exposed to glucocorticoids (GCs) is therefore 
relevant as an early (and transient) increase in bone resorption occurs in patients that initiate 
glucocorticoid therapy. This treatment strategy was supported by the Ad Hoc Expert group. 
In general, requirements for an indication “treatment of bone loss associated with glucocorticoid therapy” 
are not included in EU regulatory guidelines and are not part of approval of other anti-osteoporotic agent 
authorised in the EU. Some of these anti-osteoporosis agents are authorised for the indication “treatment 
of GIOP” based on similar study designs and results as in the current study with denosumab. However,  
similar in wording with approved indications for Prolia (Treatment of bone loss associated with hormone 
ablation in men with prostate cancer at increased risk of fractures),  CHMP considered the chosen wording 
of the new indication for Prolia as adequate as the target population treated with glucocorticoids does not 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/406583/2018 
Page 72/74 
 
  
  
 
only include patients with established osteoporosis. 
The number of premenopausal women (and men < 50 years) in the pivotal trial was very small which was 
discussed by the Ad Hoc Expert group who had some concerns with the reliability of fracture risk 
estimates of this subpopulation of the study. However, the experts pointed out, that there are cases of 
(unmet) need for treatment of premenopausal women on GCs considered at high risk of fracture. Based 
on the mechanism of both GIOP and denosumab, it is considered that the new indication should not be 
limited to post-menopausal women and elderly men only. As animal studies with denosumab have shown 
reproductive toxicity, SmPC section 4.6 has been updated to include information on contraception and 
that women should be advised not to become pregnant for at least 5 months after treatment with Prolia, 
which is in line with the current recommendations for Xgeva. 
One other limitation is that there was no safety data available for patients with severe renal impairment 
(eGFR ≤ 30) and concomitant glucocorticoid treatment. This vulnerable group may be at increased risk of 
adverse events.  The absence of safety data in patients with GFR ≤  30 is included in the SmPC. SmPC 
section 4.4 has been amended in order to highlight an increased risk (e.g.“Concomitant glucocorticoid 
treatment is an additional risk factor for hypocalcaemia”).  
Taking into account above considerations and available data, it is reasonable to extrapolate anti-fracture 
efficacy of denosumab from PMO to GIOP based on similar BMD changes, similar to the extrapolation of 
data with some other antiresorptive agents used in GIOP. The study results regarding BMD and vertebral 
and non-vertebral fractures are presented in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Prolia, including for treatment of bone loss associated with long-term systemic 
glucocorticoid therapy in adult patients at increased risk of fracture, is positive.

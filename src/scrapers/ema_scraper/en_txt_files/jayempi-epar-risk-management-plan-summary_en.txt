Brief description of product including: 
Chemical class: 
Summary of mode of action 
Azathioprine, an imidazole derivative of 
6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), which acts as an 
immunosuppressant antimetabolite 
Azathioprine is rapidly broken down in vivo 
into 6-MP and 1-methyl-4-nitro-5-
thioimidazole.  6-MP readily crosses cell 
membranes and is converted intracellularly 
into a number of purine thioanalogues, 
which include the main active nucleotide, 
thioinosinic acid.  The rate of conversion 
varies from one person to another. 
Irrespective of whether it is given directly or 
is derived in vivo from azathioprine, 6-MP 
is eliminated mainly as the inactive oxidised 
metabolite thiouric acid.  This oxidation is 
brought about by xanthine oxidase, an 
enzyme that is inhibited by allopurinol.  The 
activity of the methylnitroimidazole moiety 
has not been defined clearly.  However, in 
several systems it appears to modify the 
activity of azathioprine as compared with 
that of 6-MP. 
Azathioprine has an effect on both 
immunological reaction and tumour growth.  
Its major role has been as an agent for 
suppressing the immune response.  The

precise mechanism by which this effect is 
achieved is not known.  However, the 
following mechanisms of action have been 
suggested:  
•  The action of the released 6-MP as a 
purine antimetabolite 
•  The possible blockage of -SH groups by 
alkylation 
•  The inhibition of many pathways in 
nucleic acid biosynthesis, hence 
preventing proliferation and activity of 
immunocompetent cells (B- and 
T-lymphocytes) 
•  The damage of deoxyribonucleic acid 
through incorporation of purine 
thioanalogues.

Indication(s) in the EEA: 
Current: 
Jayempi is indicated in combination with 
other immunosuppressive agents for the 
prophylaxis of transplant rejection in 
patients receiving allogeneic kidney, liver, 
heart, lung or pancreas transplants. 
Azathioprine is indicated in 
immunosuppressive regimens as an adjunct 
to immunosuppressive agents that form the 
mainstay of treatment (basis 
immunosuppression). 
Jayempi is used as an immunosuppressant 
antimetabolite either alone or, more 
commonly, in combination with other 
agents (usually corticosteroids) and / or 
procedures which influence the immune 
response. 
Jayempi is indicated in patients who are 
intolerant to glucocorticosteroids or if the 
therapeutic response is inadequate despite 
treatment with high doses of

glucocorticosteroids, in the following 
diseases: 
•  severe active rheumatoid arthritis 
(chronic polyarthritis) that cannot be 
kept under control by less toxic agents 
(disease-modifying anti-rheumatic – 
medicinal products - DMARDs) 
•  autoimmune hepatitis 
•  systemic lupus erythematosus 
•  dermatomyositis 
•  polyarteritis nodosa 
•  pemphigus vulgaris and bullous 
pemphigoid 
•  Behçet’s disease 
• 
refractory autoimmune haemolytic 
anaemia, caused by warm 
immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies 
•  chronic refractory idiopathic 
thrombocytopenic purpura 
Jayempi is used for the treatment of 
moderately severe to severe forms of 
chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
(Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis) in 
patients in whom glucocorticosteroid 
therapy is necessary, but where 
glucocorticosteroids are not tolerated, or in 
whom the disease is untreatable with other 
common means of first choice. 
It is also indicated in relapsing multiple 
sclerosis, if an immunomodulatory therapy 
is indicated but beta interferon therapy is 
not possible, or a stable course has been 
achieved with previous treatment with 
azathioprine. 
Jayempi is indicated for the treatment of 
generalised myasthenia gravis. Depending 
on the severity of the disease, Jayempi

should be given in combination with 
glucocorticoids because of slow onset of 
action at the beginning of treatment and the 
glucocorticoid dose should be gradually 
reduced after several months of treatment. 
Not applicable 
For oral use 
Transplantation 
Depending on the immunosuppressive 
regime selected, a dosage of up to 5 mg/kg 
body weight/day may be given on the first 
day of therapy. 
The maintenance dose can range from 1 to 
4 mg/kg body weight/day and must be 
adjusted according to the clinical 
requirements and haematological tolerance. 
Azathioprine therapy should be maintained 
indefinitely, even if only low doses are 
necessary, because of the risk of graft 
rejection. 
Multiple sclerosis-adults only 
The usual dose for the treatment of 
relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis is 
between 2 and 3 mg/kg body weight/day. 
Treatment duration of more than 1 year may 
be required until manifestation of the effect, 
and at least 2 years may be needed until the 
disease is actually under control. 
Myasthenia gravis 
The recommended dose for the treatment of 
myasthenia gravis is 2 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg 
body weight/day. 
Treatment success usually occurs 2 to 
6 months after the start of treatment at the 
earliest. Depending on the severity of the 
disease, Jayempi should be given in 
combination with glucocorticosteroids at the

start of treatment because of the slow onset 
of the effect.  The dose of 
glucocorticosteroids can be gradually 
reduced over several months. 
Treatment with Jayempi should be 
continued for at least 2 to 3 years.  
Chronic active autoimmune hepatitis 
The initial dosage is usually between 1.0 
and 1.5 mg/kg body weight/day, and the 
maintenance dosage is up to 2 mg/kg body 
weight/day. 
Dosage in other conditions 
In general, the starting dosage is 1 to 
3 mg/kg body weight/day and should be 
adjusted according to the clinical response 
(which may not be evident for weeks or 
months) and haematological tolerance. 
When therapeutic response is evident, 
consideration should be given to reducing 
the maintenance dosage to the lowest level 
compatible with the maintenance of that 
response.  If no improvement occurs in the 
patient's condition within 3 to 6 months, 
consideration should be given to 
withdrawing the medicinal product. 
The maintenance dosage required may 
range from less than 1 mg/kg/body 
weight/day to 3 mg/kg/body weight/day 
depending on the clinical condition being 
treated and the individual patient response, 
including haematological tolerance. 
However, in patients with IBD treatment 
duration of at least 12 months should be 
considered, whereby a response to treatment 
may only be recognisable clinically after 
3 to 4 months.

POPULATIONS 
Active substance(s):  Azathioprine 
Product(s) concerned:  Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension 
MAH / MAA name:  Nova Laboratories Ireland Ltd. 
Data lock point for this module:  30 Jun 2020 
RMP version number when this module was last updated:  1.0 
Indication:  The indication and the safety profile of Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension 
remains the same as that of the reference product; therefore, the most frequent uses are 
presented for discussion of epidemiology of the target population. 
Inhibition of Transplant Rejection 
Incidence:  The annual number of organ transplantations varies between countries.  Based on 
the statistics published by the joint Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation 
(http://www.transplant-observatory.org), in 2018 there were 27,738 kidney transplants, 
10,481 liver transplants, 2,801 heart transplants, 2,183 lung transplants, 801 pancreas 
transplants and 43 small bowel transplants performed in Europe. 
Prevalence: The estimated total population of the EU is 513 million (Eurostat news release, 
Jul 2019).  The number of transplantations in the EU may be roughly estimated to be 
86 transplants per million EU population per year.  These patients represent the target 
population that would potentially need to receive immunosuppressive medication such as 
azathioprine. 
The exact number of organ transplant patients requiring immunosuppressive therapy is 
unknown.  It is estimated that there are hundreds of thousands of patients in the EU that need 
immunosuppressive therapy after an organ transplant. 
Demographics of the Population in the Proposed Indication:  All age groups, increasing 
incidence with increasing age.  Gender specificity is based on the underlying disease; exact 
statistics are not available. 
Risk Factors:  Transplantation is a life-saving surgery.  The supply of donor organs is 
significantly lower than demand for them.  Immunosuppression is an essential treatment to 
maintain a functioning transplanted allogeneic organ. 
Main Existing Treatment Options:  Allogeneic transplantation requires immunosuppression 
to facilitate successful organ transplant acceptance by the recipient and many different forms 
of treatment have been developed. 
This immunosuppression is facilitated by corticosteroids such as prednisone or 
methylprednisolone alone or combined with immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, 
mycophenolate mofetil or sirolimus, or by administration of calcineurine inhibitors 
(cyclosporine, tacrolimus) or other agents (biologicals).

Risk Management Plan v 1.1  
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated Population, including 
Mortality and Morbidity:  Most centres report more than 70% survival after 5 years for 
heart, lung, liver and kidney transplantations. 
Important Co-morbidities:  Opportunistic infections, co-morbidities linked to the 
underlying disease that led to the organ transplant. 
Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis 
Incidence:  Severe RA represents less than 50% of all newly diagnosed cases of RA (Scott 
et al., 2010). It is estimated that 5 to 50 cases of RA per 100,000 population are diagnosed 
annually. 
Prevalence:  Overall, approximately 0.5 to 1% of adults in industrialised nations are affected 
by RA (Scott et al., 2010). 
Demographics of the Population in the Proposed Indication:  Prevalence of RA rises with 
increasing age and is more common in women >65 years of age. 
Risk Factors:  RA increases morbidity and mortality in the population and often leads to 
premature death. 
Main Existing Treatment Options:  Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) 
represent the first line of RA treatment strategy.  DMARDs are given as monotherapy or in a 
combination with other DMARDs, such as methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine 
and sulfasalazine.  Immunosuppressant methotrexate is usually the first drug choice. 
Biological agents represent the newest treatment option for patients with RA who are not 
adequately responsive to DMARD preparations.  Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors 
(infliximab, adalimumab) or rituximab may be used.  Biological preparations are usually 
combined with DMARD administration.  
As with any other autoimmune diseases, administration of immunosuppressives in 
combination with glucocorticoids is also considered a treatment option.  To ease some 
symptoms of RA, analgesics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may also be used. 
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated Population, including 
Mortality and Morbidity:  RA has been shown to increase the risk of death caused by 
heart-related (cardiovascular) diseases (Liao 2017). 
Important Co-morbidities:  Cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. 
Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease 
Incidence:  Inflammation of the gut affects about 37 to 246 patients per 100,000 population 
(for UC) and 26 to 199 patients per 100,000 population (for CD) (Loftus 2004).

Risk Management Plan v 1.1  
Prevalence:  The annual rate of new diagnosis ranges between 5.6 patients for CD to 
10.4 patients for UC per 100,000 EU population aged 15 to 64 years (Shivananda 
et al., 1996). 
Demographics of the Population in the Proposed Indication:  Slightly more common in 
females than males. 
Risk Factors:  Both of the chronic IBDs lead to increased associated morbidity and 
premature mortality in severe disease. 
Main Existing Treatment Options:  Corticosteroids are the mainstay of conventional 
therapy; therapeutic alternatives in steroid-refractory severe disease are cyclosporine, 
tacrolimus or biologicals. 
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated Population, including 
Mortality and Morbidity:  17.1 per 1,000 person-years (Card et al., 2003). 
Important Co-morbidities:  None. 
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 
Incidence:  SLE represents between 2.2 to 5 new diagnoses per 100,000 European 
inhabitants per year. 
Prevalence:  The overall number of patients suffering from SLE per 100,000 EU population 
is estimated as 20.5 to 71 patients (Danchenko et al., 2006).   
Demographics of the Population in the Proposed Indication:   
Risk Factors:  SLE increases the risk of life-threatening diseases, in particular of those with 
involvement of the vascular pathophysiology (cerebrovascular, cardiovascular). 
Main Existing Treatment Options:  The European League Against Rheumatism released 
recommendations for the treatment of SLE (Bertsias et al., 2008).  In patients with SLE 
without major organ manifestations, glucocorticoids and antimalarial agents may be 
beneficial.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be used for short periods in patients at 
low risk for complication from these drugs. 
Immunosuppressive agent use (e.g., azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate) 
is considered in refractory cases or when steroids cannot be reduced to levels for long-term 
use (Mosca et al., 2010). 
In patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations that may have an inflammatory aetiology, 
immunosuppressive agents may be considered. 
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated Population, including 
Mortality and Morbidity:  Linked to clinical manifestation and co-morbidity. 
Important Co-morbidities:  Cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.

Autoimmune Hepatitis 
Risk Management Plan v 1.1  
Incidence:  Autoimmune hepatitis affects about 10.7 patients per 100,000 population 
(Werner et al., 2008). 
Prevalence:  As above. 
Demographics of the Population in the Proposed Indication:  Autoimmune hepatitis 
affects patients of all ages and gender across all geographic regions but is more common in 
females than males (Lowe and John, 2018).  Results from a large Danish nationwide 
population-based study demonstrated the peak age of incidence at more than 60 years for 
both men and women (Grønbæk et al., 2014). 
Risk Factors:  Untreated severe cases can lead to cirrhosis and hepatic failure.  Many 
patients have existing cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis. 
Main Existing Treatment Options:  Corticosteroids, either alone or in combination with 
azathioprine. 
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated Population, including 
Mortality and Morbidity:  Undiagnosed disease leads to significant morbidity and 
mortality; however, timely initiation of treatment leads to a favourable outcome in the 
majority of cases.  For patients who present with a severe acute hepatitis, overall mortality is 
high (19% to 45%; Lowe and John, 2018). 
Important Co-morbidities:  None.

Justification of new safety concern “Potential medication errors - conversion of patients 
from tablet to liquid formulation and two dosing syringes” with a submission of this 
RMP in comparison with the reference medicinal product Imurek:  
Potential medication errors - conversion of patients from tablet to liquid formulation and two 
dosing syringes, and interaction with live and inactivated vaccines, are both considered 
important potential risks. 
Potential medication errors - conversion of patients from tablet to liquid formulation and two 
dosing syringes is a new potential risk for Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension in comparison 
with the reference medicinal product Imurek.  As the possibility of conversion of patients 
from pre-approved tablet formulation to liquid formulation cannot be excluded, due to the 
ease of the administration especially in paediatric patients and patients with dysphagia, this 
has been considered as an additional potential risk for Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension.  
Although considered bioequivalent as per the bioequivalence study results, the risk of a 
potential medication error in the calculation of dose and its administration cannot be excluded 
due to the use of two syringes for dispersion of the Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension before 
administration. 
Also, the potential for medication error due to use of two syringes may increase the risk of 
overdose if used incorrectly. 
SVII.1 Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP Submission 
SVII.1.1 
Risks Not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety  
Concerns in the RMP 
Reason for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in 
the RMP:  
Below are the known risks that require no further characterisation and are followed up via 
routine pharmacovigilance, namely through signal detection and adverse reaction reporting, 
and for which either the risk minimisation messages in the product information are adhered to 
by prescribers (e.g. actions being part of standard clinical practice in each EU member state 
where the product is authorised) or which do not require any additional pharmacovigilance or 
additional risk minimisation activities: 
•  Myelosuppression (bone marrow suppression)

SVII.1.2 
Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns 
in the RMP 
Important Identified Risks:  
Not Applicable.  
Important Potential Risk 1: Potential medication errors - conversion of patients from 
tablet to liquid formulation and two dosing syringes 
Risk-benefit  impact:  Low,  as  the  Jayempi  10 mg/mL  oral  suspension  SmPC  specifies  the 
method of administration, which will keep this risk under control. 
With approved oral tablet formulations available on the market there is a chance of conversion 
of  patients  from  oral  tablet  to  oral  suspension,  especially  in  the  paediatric  population  and 
patients  with  dysphagia.    The  Jayempi  10 mg/mL  oral  suspension  is  accompanied  by  two 
syringes  for  dispersing  the  suspension  before  administration.    With  conversion  there  is  the 
possibility of an impact on dose, although Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension is considered 
bioequivalent and, therefore, interchangeable as per the data available from the bioequivalence 
study.    There  is  also  a  risk  of  potential  medication  error  with  use  of  two  syringes  for  dose 
calculation and administration.  This can also increase the risk of overdose.

Nova Laboratories Ireland Ltd. 
Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension 
Risk Management Plan v 1.1  
Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension provides clear instructions in Section 4.2 (Posology and 
method of administration) to avoid the potential for medication error.  As Jayempi 10 mg/mL 
oral suspension will only be available on prescription, there will always be oversight by the 
prescribing physician/specialist.  
As per section 4.4 of the Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension SmPC, physicians/health care 
personnel should recommend patients/carers for weekly haematological monitoring during first 
8 weeks of treatment and thereafter monthly or at least at intervals of no longer than 3 months. 
Risks will be managed via routine pharmacovigilance activities and Nova Laboratories Ireland 
Ltd. will use a follow-up questionnaire form for medication error to follow-up medication error 
cases due to conversion from tablets to liquid formulation. In addition as per required additional 
pharmacovigilance  activities  medication  error  reports  specifically  due  to  “conversion  of 
patients from tablet to liquid formulation and two dosing syringes” will be monitored annually 
and submitted as post authorisation measure (PAM) outside the context of azathioprine PSUR. 
Important Potential Risk 2: Drug exposure during pregnancy and breastfeeding 
Risk-benefit impact: Low, as it is available on prescription only and prescribing physicians 
and dispensing pharmacists will be made aware about contraindication of the product during 
lactation and potential effects of Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension on pregnancy outcome 
and the potential of toxic effects on the foetus and infants via maternal and paternal exposure 
to Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension via the Jayempi SmPC. 
Azathioprine comes under the category D-evidence of human risk of the Food and Drug 
Administration. Although there are some concerns regarding azathioprine use, with foetal 
abnormalities shown in animals, most practitioners consider this medication as a safe 
alternative based on its long record of use in transplant recipients (Al-Otaibi et al., 2019). In a 
national cross sectional survey of Canadian rheumatologists regarding management of 
inflammatory arthritis in pregnancy, respondents agreed that azathioprine (76%) can be 
continued throughout pregnancy and was safe during all pregnancies. This is in alignment 
with European League Against Rheumatism points and British Society for Rheumatology, 
British Health Professionals in Rheumatology guidelines for the continuation of azathioprine, 
hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine during pregnancy. (De Vera et al., 2019). 
Azathioprine is commonly used as steroid-sparing agent in the management of myasthenia 
gravis. Although several studies have reported increased rates of prematurity, intrauterine 
growth retardation and low birth weight, there is no increased risk of foetal malformations in 
infants born to mothers exposed to azathioprine during pregnancy as per few authors. This is 
likely related to the absence of enzymes in the foetal liver, which converts azathioprine to its 
active metabolite. Currently, azathioprine is considered as non-steroidal drug of choice in the 
management of pregnant myasthenic women in Europe given in a dose of 2 to 3 mg/kg body 
weight. It is still considered as a risky drug in the United States based on case reports, which 
suggested that infants exposed to azathioprine in utero have an increased risk of infections,

anaemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. The author recommended that, although 
azathioprine could be a drug of choice during pregnancy for patients who are intolerant to 
steroids, breastfeeding should be avoided in patients taking azathioprine as it is excreted in 
breast milk, or administration during breastfeeding should be undertaken only after 
discussing the possible risk with the mother (Bansal et al., 2018). 
A retrospective observational study compared paternal exposure of mycophenolic acid 
(MPA) and non-MPA (receiving azathioprine N = 8 and not receiving azathioprine N = 5) for 
kidney-transplanted patients. In non-MPA groups there were two reports of miscarriage and 
one report of Down’s syndrome, although it was not specified if these patients received 
azathioprine or not. However, none of the 21 children in the non-MPA group and none in the 
MPA group showed physical malformations, and birth weights were also comparable 
between groups (Lopez-Lopez et al., 2018). 
Studies in women with IBD, SLE or transplantation taking doses of azathioprine up to 200 
mg daily for immunosuppression have found either low or unmeasurable levels of the active 
metabolite in milk and infant serum. Some evidence indicates a lack of adverse effects on the 
health and development of infants exposed to azathioprine during breastfeeding up to 
3.5 years of age but long-term follow-up for effects such as carcinogenesis have not been 
performed. Mothers with decreased activity of the enzyme that detoxifies azathioprine 
metabolites may transmit higher levels of drug to their infants in breast milk. Cases of mild, 
asymptomatic neutropenia have been reported and so it might be desirable to monitor 
exclusively breastfed infants with a complete blood count with differential and liver function 
tests, if azathioprine is used during lactation, although some authors consider that monitoring 
is unnecessary. Avoiding breastfeeding for 4 hours after a dose should markedly decrease the 
dose received by the infant in breast milk. Most experts consider breastfeeding during 
azathioprine to be acceptable, however, there has been evidence of low blood counts and 
infections in the infants whose mothers were exposed to azathioprine during pregnancy (US 
National Library of Medicine, 2006). 
It is known that considerable amounts of azathioprine and its metabolites pass through the 
placenta and amniotic sac, and are thereby transferred from the mother to the foetus. 
Malformations due to azathioprine occurred in animal experiments. In animal studies, 
azathioprine was teratogenic and embryotoxic. There are conflicting findings on the 
teratogenic potential of azathioprine in humans. Azathioprine must only be used during 
pregnancy after a careful benefit/risk analysis. 
Blood count changes (leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia) have been reported in a number 
of neonates whose mothers received azathioprine during pregnancy. Extra care in 
haematological monitoring of the mother is advised during pregnancy. Temporary 
impairment of the immune response was detected in neonates from intrauterine exposure to a 
combination of azathioprine with prednisone. There have been reports of intrauterine growth 
retardation, premature births and low birth weights vis-à-vis azathioprine, in particular in 
combination with corticosteroids. Moreover, data is available on spontaneous abortions after 
both maternal and paternal exposure. Chromosomal abnormalities, which disappear with

time, have been demonstrated in lymphocytes of the offspring of patients treated with 
azathioprine. Except in extremely rare cases, no overt physical evidence of abnormality has 
been observed in the offspring of patients treated with azathioprine (Jayempi SmPC). 
The active metabolite of azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, has been identified in the colostrum 
and breast milk of women receiving azathioprine treatment (Jayempi SmPC). Furthermore, 
azathioprine is proven to be mutagenic in a number of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity assays 
(Jayempi SmPC). Sections 4.3, 4.6 and 5.3 of the Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension SmPC 
provide clear instruction regarding this risk. This risk will be managed via routine 
pharmacovigilance activities and drug exposure during pregnancy and breastfeeding cases 
will be documented in the PSUR.

tablet formulation of azathioprine with oral suspension is possible.  Although Jayempi 
10 mg/mL oral suspension is considered bioequivalent and, therefore, interchangeable as per 
the data available from the bioequivalence study, the risk of a potential medication error with 
use of two syringes for dose calculation and administration leading to incorrect dose or

unable to take solid oral dosage forms 
With an approved oral tablet formulation available on the market, 
there is a chance of conversion of patients from oral tablet to liquid 
formulation, especially in the paediatric population and patients with 
dysphagia.  The Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension is accompanied 
by two syringes for dispersing the suspension before administration.  
With conversion there is a possibility of an impact on dose, although 
Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension is considered bioequivalent and, 
therefore, interchangeable as per the data available from the

error with use of two syringes for dose calculation and administration.  
This can also increase the risk of overdose.  With this, there is an 
increased chance of other risks of Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension 
i.e. myelosuppression and opportunistic infections. 
Risk factors or risk groups 
Paediatric and elderly age groups, and patients with dysphagia who 
were prescribed with the tablet formulation. 
Preventability 
Supervision by the prescribing physician / specialist as a ‘prescription 
only use’ medicinal product will help to keep this risk of medication 
error under control. 
Referring to Section 4.2 (Posology and method of administration) of 
the Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension SmPC before starting on 
Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension, where the dosing of azathioprine 
with the help of two syringes is explained in detail, will also help to 
keep the risk of medication error under control.

Important Potential Risk #2 
Risk: Drug exposure during pregnancy and breastfeeding 
Potential mechanisms 
Azathioprine is an antineoplastic immunomodulating, 
immunosuppressive antimetabolite. Azathioprine is an inactive 6-MP, 
which acts as a purine antagonist but requires cellular uptake and 
intracellular anabolism to TGNs for immunosuppression. TGNs and 
other metabolites (e.g. 6-MP ribonucleotides) inhibit de novo purine 
synthesis and purine nucleotide interconversions. The TGNs are also 
incorporated into nucleic acids and this contributes to the 
immunosuppressive effects of the drug. Azathioprine also inhibits 
many pathways in nucleic acid biosynthesis, hence preventing 
proliferation and activity of cells in the immune response i.e. B- and 
T-lymphocytes. Azathioprine is rapidly metabolised in vivo by

glutathione S-transferase into the metabolites 6-MP and 
1-methyl-4-nitro-5-thioimidazole. The metabolite, 6-MP, passes cell 
membranes rapidly and is extensively metabolised in numerous 
multistep metabolic processes into active and inactive metabolites 
without any enzyme being predominantly active. 
Azathioprine can induce mutations in human cells and can interfere 
with DNA repair mechanisms; these drugs could potentially influence 
the risk of several types of cancer. From another perspective, cancer 
cells could also be considered vulnerable to its action because 
azathioprine disrupts cell division. Azathioprine is known to be 
mutagenic; mutation in somatic cells could lead to cancer.

Both male and female patients of reproductive age should use 
contraceptive methods while using azathioprine. Men should not 
father children during and up to 6 months after the end of treatment. 
This also applies to patients with limited fertility due to chronic 
uraemia, as fertility generally returns to normal after a transplant. To 
use additional contraception for the patients using IUD, coil or 
T-shaped copper coil. 
Azathioprine should be contraindicated while breastfeeding. If 
treatment with azathioprine is unavoidable, breastfeeding should be 
discontinued. 
Low, as it is available on prescription only and prescribing physicians 
and dispensing pharmacists will be made aware about the 
contraindication of the product during lactation and potential effects 
of Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension on pregnancy outcomes and the 
potential of toxic effects on the foetus and infants via maternal and 
paternal exposure to Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension via the

Routine risk communication: 
Please refer to the following sections of the Jayempi 10 mg/mL 
oral suspension SmPC:  Sections 4.2 (Posology and method of 
administration) and 4.9 (Overdose). 
Routine risk minimisation activities recommending specific 
clinical measures to address the risk: 
As per Section 4.2 of the Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension 
SmPC, physicians/health care personnel should recommend 
patients/carers on appropriate dosing of Jayempi as per the specific 
indication. 
As per section 4.4 of the Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension 
SmPC, physicians/health care personnel should recommend 
patients/carers for weekly haematological monitoring during first 
8 weeks of treatment and thereafter monthly or at least at intervals 
of no longer than 3 months.  
In the event of azathioprine overdose, Section 4.9 of the Jayempi 
10 mg/mL oral suspension SmPC notes that active measures (such 
as usage of activated charcoal) will probably only be effective if 
they are carried out within 60 minutes of ingestion.

Routine risk communication: 
The safety information in the proposed product information is 
aligned to the reference medicinal product. 
Please refer to the following Sections of the Jayempi 10 mg/mL 
oral suspension SmPC: Sections 4.3 (contraindications), 4.6 
(Fertility, pregnancy and lactation), section 5.3 (preclinical safety 
data). 
Routine risk minimisation activities recommending specific 
clinical measures to address the risk: 
Per section 4.3 of Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension SmPC, 
Jayempi is contraindicated during lactation. Per Section 4.6 of 
Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension SmPC, both male and female 
patients of reproductive age should use contraceptive methods 
while using azathioprine. Men should not father children during 
and up to 6 months after the end of treatment. This also applies to 
patients with limited fertility due to chronic uraemia, as fertility 
generally returns to normal after a transplant. Additional 
contraceptive methods should be recommended for females using 
intrauterine devices (coil or T-shaped copper coil), with the 
evidence that it can fail under azathioprine therapy. 
Extra care in haematological monitoring of the mother is advised 
during pregnancy. If treatment is unavoidable with azathioprine 
during breastfeeding, then breastfeeding should be discontinued. 
Per Section 5.3 of Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension SmPC, 
Jayempi was embryotoxic and mutagenic in pre-clinical studies 
and hence must only be used during pregnancy after a careful 
benefit/risk analysis.

The Medicine and What it is Used For 
Jayempi is authorised for the conditions outlined in Table 2. (See SmPC for full indication). 
It contains azathioprine as the active substance and it is given orally (by mouth).  
 In general, the starting dosage is 1 to 3 mg/kg body weight/day and the maintenance dose 
required may range from less than 1 mg/kg/body weight/day to 3 mg/kg/body weight/day 
depending on the clinical condition being treated; the dose is adjusted by the treating 
physician according to the patient’s clinical response. 
For other specific medical conditions, the following doses should be given: 
Up to 5 mg/kg body weight/day may be given on the first day of therapy following organ 
transplantation in adults and children; the maintenance dose can range from 1 to 4 mg/kg 
body weight/day and is adjusted according to the clinical requirements;

II.  Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral suspension, together with measures to minimise 
such risks and the proposed studies for learning more about Jayempi 10 mg/mL oral 
suspension’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can include: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions will be collected 
continuously and regularly analysed, reported and included in periodic safety update reports 
(PSURs) as applicable, so that action(s) can be taken as necessary.  These measures constitute 
routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
The important information that affects the safe use of Jayempi, which is not yet available, is 
listed under ‘missing information’.

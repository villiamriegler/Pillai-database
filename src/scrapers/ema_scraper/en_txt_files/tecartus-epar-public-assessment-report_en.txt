1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Kite Pharma EU B.V. submitted on 9 January 2020 an application for marketing authorisation to 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Tecartus, through the centralised procedure falling within the Article 
3(1) and point 1a of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was 
agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 31 May 2018. 
Tecartus, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/03/19/2220 on 13 November 2019 in the following 
condition: Treatment of mantle cell lymphoma. 
Tecartus was granted eligibility to PRIME on 1 June 2018 in the following indication: Treatment of adult patients 
with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. 
Eligibility to PRIME was granted at the time in view of the following: 
•  Mantle cell lymphoma is an aggressive and incurable subtype of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 
Although most cases are initially sensitive to chemotherapy, relapse and progressive chemoresistance 
are the rule in advanced stages. Currently available therapy for patients with relapsed MCL results in CR 
rates of 19% in patients who had failed ibrutinib therapy. Although the introduction of novel agents (e.g. 
IMiDs, temsirolimus and, in particular, BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib and acalabrutinib) has improved 
the outcomes of subjects with relapsed or refractory (r/r) MCL, the available therapies (with the possible 
exception of HSCT) do not have a curative intent, and prolonging PFS and symptoms palliation remain 
the main goals of treatment. The unmet medical need can therefore be agreed.  
•  Despite the overall limited data and models’ limitations, the non-clinical data package may be overall 
considered a sufficient proof-of-concept to address the product potential to treat CD19 expressing 
onco-haematological malignancies such as r/r MCL.  
• 
Limited but promising clinical data have been provided from 28 subjects treated with KTE-C19 (XLP 
process) in Cohort 1 in ZUMA-2 after failing a BTK inhibitor. In particular, the reported ORR (86%), CR 
rate (54%) and estimated 9-month DoR and OS rates (69.9% and 83.7%, respectively) observed in a 
heavily pre-treated population already exposed to ibrutinib should be regarded with interest, since the 
currently available literature data seem to point toward median OS ranging from 2.9 to 5.8 months after 
failure of BTK inhibitors (Martin P et al, Blood 2016).  
The applicant applied for the following indication: Tecartus is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)  
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Tecartus as an orphan medicinal product in the approved 
indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan maintenance assessment report 
published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/Tecartus. 
The legal basis for this application refers to: 
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that 
autologous anti-CD19-transduced CD3+ cells was considered to be a new active substance. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 8/131 
 
  
  
 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain test(s) or study(ies) 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0433/2019 on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, 
the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan medicinal 
products. 
Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
Conditional marketing authorisation   
The applicant applied for a full marketing authorisation, but during the assessment, in response to CAT and 
CHMP concerns on the comprehensiveness of the data, requested consideration of its application for a 
conditional marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 14-a of the above mentioned Regulation. 
Accelerated assessment 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14(9) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance autologous peripheral blood t cells CD4 and CD8 selected and 
CD3 and CD28 activated transduced with retroviral vector expressing anti-CD19 CD28/CD3-zeta chimeric 
antigen receptor and cultured as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of 
a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
Scientific recommendation on Classification 
The applicant Kite Pharma EU B.V. submitted on 8 May 2019 an application for Scientific recommendation on 
Classification to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Tecartus, which was designated as an Advanced 
Therapy Medicinal Product on 1 July 2019. Tecartus was classified as a gene therapy medicinal product.

PRIME support 
Upon granting of eligibility to PRIME, Jan Müller-Berghaus was appointed by the CHMP as rapporteur. 
A kick-off meeting was held on 30 October 2018. The objective of the meeting was to discuss the development 
programme and regulatory strategy for the product. The applicant was recommended to address the following 
key issues through relevant regulatory procedures:  
to seek further scientific advice namely multiplicity of infection, vector impurities and drug substance 
specification for quality and historical control rate and bridging therapy for clinical and significant benefit for 
the maintenance of the orphan designation. In addition, the Agency asked the Company to consider seeking 
EMA/HTA parallel advice with regards to the historical control.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The present centralised marketing authorisation application concerns the treatment of adult patients with 
relapsed or refractory (r/r) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).  
The agreed indication for the product is:  Tecartus is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed 
or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy including a Bruton’s 
tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. 
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with distinctive clinical, 
biological, and molecular characteristics {Fakhri 2017, National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2018} 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
MCL accounts for approximately 6% of all new cases of NHL in the United States (US) (Leukemia & Lymphoma 
Society 2014) and 5% to 7% of malignant lymphoma in Western Europe (Dreyling 2017b). The estimated 
annual incidence of MCL is approximately 1 to 2 per 100,000 persons in the US and Europe (Dreyling 2017b, Fu 
2017). MCL is more likely to affect men than women (Vose 2017), and the median age at diagnosis is 68 years 
(Fakhri 2017) 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
The lymphoma cells in MCL are thought to originate from antigen-naive pre-germinal centre B cells within the 
mantle zone of the lymph node and typically express the surface markers CD19, CD20, CD22, CD43, CD79a, 
FMC7, CD5, surface immunoglobulin (Ig) M, and surface IgD (Dreyling 2014) but not CD11c and CD10 (Kraus 
2010). The molecular hallmark of MCL is the chromosomal translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32), which results in 
overexpression of the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1. In addition to cell cycle dysregulation, aberrant cyclin D1 
expression also results in alterations in the DNA damage response pathway and activation of cell survival 
pathways, both of which contribute to MCL pathogenesis (Jares 2012). Independent of cyclin D1 expression, the 
transcription factor sex determining region Y-box 11 (SOX11) may be used as a diagnostic marker for the rare 
cases of MCL that are cyclin D1-negative (Narurkar 2016, Sander 2016).

EMA/588798/2020 
Page 12/131 
 
  
  
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
According to the WHO 2016 update, MCL has been categorised in two major subgroups with distinct clinical and 
molecular features: Nodal MCL and leukemic non-nodal MCL. 
Prognosis varies based on clinical and laboratory parameters. Early stage disease (Staged I-II) is defined by 
involvement of one or two lymph node regions (or extranodal sites) localised on the same side of the diaphragm. 
Patients are often diagnosed with advanced disease (Stage III or IV). Stage III-IV disease is characterised by 
involvement of lymph nodes or lymphoid regions on both sides of the diaphragm or diffuse extralymphatic organ 
involvement. Often, the primary diagnosis is advanced disease (Stage III/IV), present with lymphadenopathy 
and extranodal involvement of the blood, bone marrow, and spleen; the gastrointestinal tract is also reported to 
be involved in 15% to 30% of patients.  
Prognostic indexes help predict long-term outcomes for this disease in treatment-naive patients. The Mantle Cell 
Lymphoma  International  Prognostic  Index  (MIPI)  uses  4  independent  factors  (age,  Eastern  Cooperative 
Oncology  Group  [ECOG]  performance  status,  blood  lactate  dehydrogenase,  and  leukocyte  count)  to  stratify 
front-line patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk prognostic groups based on their overall survival (OS) 
status. After a median follow-up of 32 months, these groups had median OS values of not reached, 51 months, 
and 29 months, respectively (Hoster 2008). The authors who developed the MIPI also created the simplified 
MIPI (s-MIPI), which can be derived without a calculation. The MIPI and s-MIPI can be supplemented with the 
Ki-67 proliferative index, which offers additional discriminatory power (Geisler 2010, Hoster 2008). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Current frontline therapy options 
The  current  standard  of  care  for  first-line  treatment  depends  on  the  stage  of  MCL,  the  patients’  age,  the 
symptoms and the tumour burden. Frontline therapy includes autologous stem cell therapy, mainly reserved for 
patients ≤ 65 years of age, and different therapy regimens such as R-CHOP, R-DHAP and BR. Frontline therapy 
for  MCL  has  evolved  over  the  past  decade,  and  overall  response  rates  (ORR)  of  up  to  94%  and  complete 
response (CR) rates of up to 40% have been achieved with first-line therapies. However, despite high ORR, the 
majority of patients will relapse, and outcomes in the relapsed setting are much poorer. Recent studies have 
shown a median OS of 5 to 7 years in patients with earlier stages of disease (Martin et al, 2009; Herrmann et al, 
2009), but median OS of approximately 10 to 13 months in patients who have progressed after chemotherapy 
and targeted agents (Martin et al, 2014).  
Current treatment options in the relapsed and refractory situation 
In the r/r situation in MCL, a repeated biopsy is recommended to identify important prognostic features and 
individual  therapy  options  (Dreyling  et  al,  Annals  of  Oncology,  2017).  The  treatment  concepts  comprise 
immunochemotherapy followed by autologous/allogeneic SCT, BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib and acalabrutinib; both 
approved in the US; only ibrutinib is approved in the EU), the immunomodulatory (and thalidomide analogue) 
agent  lenalidomide,  the  m-TOR  inhibitor  temsirolimus  and  the  BCL-2  antagonist  venetoclax.  Bortezomib  is 
approved in the EU for use in combination with R-CHOP for the treatment of newly diagnosed MCL, and it has 
also been investigated as a monotherapy in relapsed/refractory MCL.  
Responses to ASCT in relapse are inferior to those in first-line and there is no consensus on the benefit of its use 
in  relapsed/refractory  disease  (Ketterer  et  al,  1997;  Robinson  et  al,  2015).  By  contrast,  allo-SCT  has  the 
potential to be curative in relapse/refractory MCL (Vose 2015). In a recent review of 7 single-institution and 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 13/131 
 
  
  
registry studies of patients with relapsed or refractory MCL, Rajabi and colleagues (Rajabi and Sweetenham 
2015) reported that approximately 25% of patients could achieve durable remissions with allo-SCT treatment if 
their disease was demonstrated to be chemosensitive prior to transplant. These studies included patients who 
had previously undergone ASCT. However, they also reported high treatment-related mortality rates of up to 
40% following allo-SCT, primarily due to graft-versus host disease, and the majority of patients still did not 
achieve durable remissions. 
Maintenance regimens with rituximab in the r/r situation have a favourable safety profile and prolong PFS and 
OS, however, second-line maintenance in patients relapsing after front-line maintenance is not recommended 
which implies a restriction of a therapeutically approach in the r/r situation of MCL a priori.  
Despite promising high rates of ORR (68%) for BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib SmPC) in the relapsed setting, they are 
not considered as curative treatments since all patients will eventually have progressive disease after receiving 
a  BTK  inhibitor.  Subsequent  to  the  approval  of  ibrutinib  in  the  US,  Rule  and  colleagues  published  a  pooled 
analysis of 370 subjects with r/r MCL who received ibrutinib across 3 studies after 2 to 5 prior therapy lines 
(Phase  2  SPARK,  Phase  3  RAY,  and  Phase  2  PCYC-1104).  Collectively,  these  subjects  initially  had  a  median 
follow-up of 24 months (Rule 2017) and later of 3.5 years in a follow-up study (Rule 2019). The ORR and CR 
rates for all subjects were 70% and 27%, respectively, but the median range for DOR was 3 to 5.8 months, and 
for OS 2.5 to 9 months (Dreyling et al on behalf of ESMO Guidelines Committee, Annals of Oncology, Volume 28, 
Jul 2017).  
Although the clinical outcome at MCL generally improved in the last years, the r/r situation and disease progress 
during or after treatment with BTK inhibitors mean a rather limited further treatment options for the patient. 
Thus, novel therapy strategies resulting in durable response rates are required. 
About the product 
Tecartus is a gene therapy medicinal product containing autologous T cells genetically modified   whereby a 
patient’s own T cells are harvested and genetically modified ex vivo by retroviral transduction using an MSCV 
based gamma-retroviral vector to express a CAR comprising an anti-CD19 single chain variable fragment (scFv) 
linked to CD28 co-stimulatory domains and CD3-zeta signalling domain . The transduced anti-CD19 CAR T cells 
are  expanded  ex  vivo  and  infused  back  into  the  patient,  where  they  can  recognise  and  eliminate  CD19 
expressing target cells.  
Tecartus  binds  to  CD19  expressing  cancer  cells.  Following  anti-CD19  CAR  T  cell  engagement  with  CD19 
expressing target cells, the CD28 co-stimulatory domain and CD3-zeta signalling domain activate downstream 
signaling cascades that lead to T-cell activation, proliferation, acquisition of effector functions and secretion of 
inflammatory  cytokines  and  chemokines.  This  sequence  of  events  leads  to  apoptosis  and  necrosis  of  CD19 
expressing target cells. 
Tecartus is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) 
after two or more lines of systemic therapy including a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The  CHMP  and  CAT  agreed  to  the  applicant’s  request  for  an  accelerated  assessment  as  the  product  was  
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the fact that currently patients with r/r MCL 
have only limited treatment options with insufficient clinical outcome. An unmet medical need was substantiated 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 14/131 
 
  
  
by the applicant and is acknowledged. Data were presented to support that Tecartus may address that unmet 
need.  Though limited clinical data were available at the time of the accelerated assessment request, yet the 
promising  ORR  and  CR  rate  observed  so  far,  and  the  possibility  for  long-term  disease  control  suggest  that 
Tecartus might indeed represent a major therapeutic advantage over existing therapies. 
However,  during  assessment  the  CAT  and  CHMP  concluded  that  it  was  no  longer  appropriate  to  pursue 
accelerated assessment, as the proposed indication did not fully correspond to the patients treated in clinical 
trials and since the data set was not considered comprehensive and the applicant had to provide a justification 
to support consideration of the application for conditional approval.  
In  light  of  the  concerns  raised  during  assessment  on  the  comprehensiveness  of  the  data  set,  the  applicant 
requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in accordance with Article 
14-a of the above mentioned Regulation, based on the fulfilment of following requirements, as presented by the 
applicant: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data by post-approval measures:  
• 
Long-term follow-up data from ZUMA-2: In order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of 
Tecartus in adult patients with relapsed or refractory MCL the MAH shall submit the 24 months 
follow-up data from the mITT population enrolled in the pivotal study ZUMA-2. Expected date for 
submission of the final data is 31 March 2022 
•  A registry-based study:In order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of Tecartus in adult 
patients with relapsed or refractory MCL and the Benefit/Risk balance in the female, elderly and 
severely diseased patients, the MAH shall submit the results of a study investigating efficacy and 
safety based on data from the same registry used to characterise the long-term efficacy and safety 
of Tecartus, according to an agreed protocol. Expected date for submission of the final data is 30 
September  2025.  These  post  authorisation  studies  will  provide  further  efficacy  and  safety 
information on important subgroups: elderly, females, patients with severe disease which are not 
fully represented in the pivotal study submitted for this procedure. The provision of this data post 
authorisation will complement the dossier in order have a more comprehensive understanding of 
efficacy, safety and benefit risk balance of the product. 
• 
An existing unmet medical need will be addressed, as an additional and novel therapeutic option is given 
for patients with r/r MCL after having received at least two prior lines of systemic therapy including a 
BTK-inhibitor. Patients with mantle cell lymphoma who are refractory or who relapsed after two or more 
lines of approved systemic therapy including Bruton’s kinase inhibitors have an overall poor prognosis 
as few authorised treatment options with established efficacy and safety remain. Usually, patients are 
treated by therapy regimens or modifications thereof, they have already received and on which they 
have  relapsed  at  some  point.  Tecartus  provides  a  treatment  option  for  which  a  significant  clinical 
benefit was demonstrated with respect to complete response, overall response rate and duration of 
response. Thus, the availability of Tecartus represents a major therapeutic advantage. 
• 
The  benefits  to  public  health  of  the  immediate  availability  outweigh  the  risks  inherent  in  the  fact  that 
additional data are still required. As benefit-risk on basis of the current data is regarded positive, an 
additional therapeutic option for Mantle cell lymphoma patients with two or more previous systemic 
therapies is considered beneficial.  
The development programme/Compliance with CHMP Guidance/Scientific advice 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 15/131 
 
  
  
 
The clinical development programme for Tecartus consists of four ongoing, uncontrolled clinical studies. The 
primary  data  for  this  marketing  authorisation  application  come  from  one  single,  uncontrolled,  open  label 
multicentre Phase 2 clinical study, KTE-C19-102 (ZUMA-2) evaluating safety and efficacy of Tecartus in patients 
whose disease had relapsed or progressed on anthracycline- or bendamustine-containing chemotherapy, an 
anti-CD20 antibody, and a BTK inhibitor (ibrutinib and/or acalabrutinib). The remaining three ongoing studies 
are phase I/II trials, intended to provide clinical experience of Tecartus in the context of other indications. 
The applicant received Protocol Assistance from the CHMP on: 
23.07.2015  -  focusing  on  quality  and  the  clinical  study  design  of  ZUMA-2  [Procedure  number: 
EMEA/H/SA/3117/1/2015/SME/ADT/II] 
- 
The target patient population of adult subjects with r/r MCL was considered acceptable. The applicant 
was  advised  to  also  include  some  patients  refractory  to  protease  inhibitors  (PI)  and/or  immune 
modulators (IMID). This advice was followed. 
- 
The  Objective  Response  Rate  as  a  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  considered  acceptable  in  a 
non-comparative study. The use of independent endpoint assessment committee was recommended 
and implemented.  
17.12.2015  -  focusing  on  the  quality  and  nonclinical  development  program  [Procedure  number: 
EMEA/H/SA/3117/4/2015/SME/ADT/III] 
-  Scientific  advice  considered  that  the  manufacturing  procedure  for  KTE-X19  is  particular  due  to  an 
enrichment of CD4 and CD8 cells.  
-  Scientific advice considered that the proposed potency assay could potentially be considered a relevant 
test of the potency of KTE-X19 at the present stage of development. However, additional validation, 
correlation  and  characterisation  data  would  be  needed  to  support  the  conclusion  that  the  proposed 
potency assay could provide a quantitative measure of the biological activity. 
- 
The provided RCR (replication competent retrovirus) testing has been performed on the MCB, WCB, and 
used  vector  stock,  and  the  omission  of  RCR  testing  was  clearly  justified  with  data  at  marketing 
authorisation application. Scientific advice considered it might be acceptable not to perform RCR testing 
on the finished product.  
-  Scientific advice considered that the proposed release specifications should be considered expanded. 
31.05.2018 - focusing on the nonclinical development program as well as the clinical study design of ZUMA-3 
(investigating acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]) [Procedure number: EMEA/H/SA/3117/6/2018/PA/ADT/III]  
- 
In vitro data addressing the transduction efficiency and functionality of KTE-X19 were required for MAA. 
Such in vitro data conducted with axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta)) were not considered as sufficient, 
since  KTE-X19  and  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  (Yescarta)  use  a  different  manufacturing  process  and 
therefore the two products were not considered the same. 
- 
The  assumed  historical  control  rate  of  25%  ORR,  was  not  considered  sufficiently  compelling. 
Furthermore, there were concerns that the cut-off could not be considered an a priori decision as the 
meta-analysis  conducted  to  support  the  cut-off  was  finalised  after  the  efficacy  data  for  the  first  28 
patients  had  been  analysed.  For  the  MAA,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  provide  information 
concerning  the  search  protocol  for  the  meta-analysis  as  well  as  information  on  how  heterogeneity 
between studies affected the estimation of the pooled ORR. This request was not followed.

The influence of both bridging therapy and conditioning therapy should be carefully considered in the 
evaluation of the data. 
The  inferential  analysis  set  was  not endorsed  as  a primary  analysis  population.  This  advice  was  not 
followed. However, results for both the inferential- and the full analyses set were generally presented in 
the MAA. 
29.05.2019 - focusing on the quality and clinical development program for the treatment of MCL [Procedure 
number: EMEA/H/SA/3117/7/2019/PA/ADT/PR/III] 
The applicant received Scientific Advice given by CHMP with respect to vector quality and the transduction step. 
The data confirm that the specification of the vector titre is acceptable. 
The applicant plans to introduce improvements to the vector process, i.e. after the planned submission of the 
Tecartus  MAA.  The  overall  strategy  to  improve  vector  quality  was  in  essence  endorsed,  and  the  proposed 
timeline was considered acceptable.  
Regarding quality aspects, the applicant has taken the recommendations given by CHMP into consideration.  
During Protocol Assistance received in December 2015 and in May 2018 the process characterisation studies 
addressing several parameters of the viral transduction step, the acceptability of the developmental activities to 
improve the quality of the retroviral vector used to genetically modify the autologous T-cells in Tecartus, and the 
appropriateness of the release specifications for the Tecartus final product have been discussed.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Tecartus (autologous anti-CD19-transduced CD3+ cells), also referred to as KTE-X19, is a CD19-directed gene 
therapy medicinal product. To prepare Tecartus, patient’s own T cells are harvested and genetically modified ex 
vivo  by  gamma-retroviral  transduction  to  express  a  chimeric  antigen  receptor  (CAR)  comprising  a  murine 
anti-CD19 single chain variable fragment (scFv) linked to CD28 co-stimulatory domain and CD3-zeta signalling 
domain. The anti-CD19 CAR T cells are expanded and infused back into the patient, where they can recognise 
and eliminate CD19-expressing target cells. 
Each patient specific single infusion bag of Tecartus contains a suspension of anti-CD19 CAR T cells, strength 0.4 
x 108 - 2 x 108 cells in approximately 68 mL. 
Tecartus is presented as a clear to opaque, white to red dispersion of cells for infusion formulated with Cryostor 
CS10 containing dimethylsulfoxyde (DMSO), sodium chloride and human serum albumin. 
Tecartus is supplied in an ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) cryostorage bag individually packed in a shipping metal 
cassette.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
KTE-X19 is produced from leukapheresis material obtained from individual patients, and therefore the product 
is unique to each patient. The patient’s T cells are engineered ex vivo to express the anti-CD19 CAR using a 
replication incompetent γ-retroviral vector containing the CAR transgene. 
The section on the active substance is separated into two parts; part 1 for the gene therapy retroviral vector 
PG13-CD19-H3 and part 2 for the transduced cells resulting in the active substance KTE-X19. 
The entire manufacturing process is covered by respective GMP certificates. 
2.1. Part 1: PG13-CD19-H3 retroviral vector 
General Information (PG13-CD19-H3 retroviral vector) 
The retroviral vector PG13-CD19-H3 is a murine stem cell virus (MSCV)-based vector pseudotyped with the 
gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV) envelope.  
The MSCV vector is a long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven non-self-inactivating (non-SIN) retroviral vector that 
encompasses the 5’LTR as promoter for transgene expression, a packaging signal including the splice donor and 
splice  acceptor  sites,  the  FMC63-based  (anti-CD19  FMC63-CD28-CD3ζ)  CAR  sequence  containing  a  human 
GM-CSF receptor signal peptide, FMC63 light chain variable region, linker peptide, FMC63 heavy chain variable 
region, CD28 (hinge, transmembrane and cytoplasmic region), and CD3ζ (cytoplasmic region), followed by the 
MSCV 3'LTR.  
Transfer  of  genetic  material  into  T-cells  occurs  via  retroviral  transduction  of  autologous  T-cells.  The 
manufacturing of the vector is based on a stable packaging cell clone PG13-CD19-H3 from which a Master Cell 
bank (MCB)/Working Cell Bank (WCB) system has been established.

Manufacture, process controls and characterisation (PG13-CD19-H3 retroviral 
vector) 
Manufacturing process (PG13-CD19-H3 retroviral vector) 
The  applicant  provided  an  adequate  description  of  the  vector  manufacturing  process.  This  includes  the 
description of the manufacturing process steps, flow-charts and description of the in-process controls (IPCs) and 
operating ranges and/or acceptance limits.  
The PG13-CD19-H3 vector is produced constitutively from a stably-transduced PG13 (ATCC CRL-10686) cell 
line. For the GMP-compliant production of the retroviral vector, cells from a single vial of WCB are expanded and 
the culture supernatant is harvested, filtered and filled into cryostorage bags.  
Control of materials (PG13-CD19-H3 retroviral vector) 
The packaging cell clone is based on a cell line that is commonly used to generate retroviral vector particles by 
introducing a γ-retroviral transfer vector of interest. These NIH3T3- derived cells stably express the Gibbon Ape 
Leukemia Virus (GALV) envelope and the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) gag-pol proteins. 
Stable transfer of the PG13-CD19 transfer vector and subsequent selection of the cell clone were conducted at 
the National Cancer Institute (NCI, Bethesda, Maryland, US). The respective MCB and the WCB are established 
in  compliance  with  GMP.  The  MCB  was  tested  and  released  based  on  ICH  Q5A  (R1).  A  single  vial  of  the 
PG13-CD19-CAR-H3 MCB was used to produce vials of WCB. The WCB has been shown to be free of bacterial, 
fungal and mycoplasma contamination in compliance with ICH Q5A (R1) and Ph. Eur. (5.2.3). The WCB was also 
found  to  be  negative  for  replication-competent  retrovirus.  The  genetic  stability  of  the  WCB  and 
end-of-production (EOP) has been investigated. The test method and results are adequately described. Overall 
the  testing  strategy  and  characterisation  of  the  cell  banks  is  considered  adequate.  Conformation  for  the 
presence of the vector sequence in the WCB is currently not specified as a release test, but respective PCR data 
confirming the presence of the vector sequences in the WCB have been provided and a respective test will be 
implemented for each new WCB that is established.  
The  sequence  of  the  viral  transfer  vector  has  been  determined  for  different  genome  regions  at  the  level  of 
plasmid DNA, MCB, WCB, EOP cells and vector particles. Overall the genetic stability of the vector construct is 
supported. 
Adequate information and acceptance criteria are given for all listed ingredients used for vector manufacturing. 
Manufacturing process development and validation (PG13-CD19-H3 retroviral vector) 
For  process  validation  of  the  commercial  manufacturing  process  three  manufacturing  runs  have  been 
conducted,  two  at  small-scale  and  one  at  full-scale  level  using  15  CS10  cell  stacks.  The  rationale  and  the 
provided data show that the manufacturing at small-scale is representative for the commercial large-scale run 
and considered acceptable.  
As  terminal  sterilisation  is  inapplicable  for  the  vector  starting  material,  aseptic  manufacturing  has  been 
adequately established including requalification on a six-month interval in accordance with the requirements.  
The ongoing process verification (OPV) run by the applicant is endorsed. The actions to be taken in the event of 
control rule violations are defined in the OPV program. 
Characterisation (PG13-CD19-H3 retroviral vector) 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 19/131 
 
  
  
 
Characterisation  of  the  PG13-CD19-H3  vector  included  both  structural  and  functional  aspects.  Studies 
demonstrated that the PG13-CD19-H3 vector encodes the transgene. Transduction results in integration of the 
vector genome into the genome of the T-cells. The transgene is transcribed to RNA and translated to anti-CD19 
CAR. Anti-CD19 CAR T-cells bind to CD19 expressing cells. Upon engagement with CD19, T-cells are activated 
and secrete IFN-γ. t. 
Impurities identified were host cell protein, HC-DNA, BSA and the viral vector protein p30. Additionally, vector 
purity was evaluated as a ratio of genome copies per transducing unit. Each harvest of PG13-CD19-H3 vector is 
considered  a  unique  lot,  and  testing  is  conducted  to  assure  sterility,  while  safety  tests  for  mycoplasma, 
adventitious virus and replication competent retrovirus (RCR) are performed only on material in the last harvest 
from the production campaign. The last harvest is considered a worst-case condition and testing at this stage 
assures that the entire production campaign remains free of adventitious agents and that replication competent 
retrovirus is not present.  
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, and 
container closure (PG13-CD19-H3 retroviral vector) 
The applicant provided a justification for setting of specifications mainly based on manufacturing experience. 
With respect to infectious titre and impurities, the applicant confirmed with batch data from the different harvest 
days, that harvest day has no impact on vector quality with respect to the impurity profile. 
The vector undergoes testing for adventitious agents prior to release for use in production of KTE-X19. and were 
shown to be negative up to date. In addition, a risk evaluation regarding potential generation of RCR during 
manufacture of the final product has been provided and the occurrence of RCR during manufacturing of Tecartus 
considered unlikely.  
The analytical procedures used for release testing of PG13-CD19-H3 vector have been validated or verified as 
appropriate.  Validation  of  the  non-compendial  analytical  methods  were  performed  in  accordance  with  ICH 
Q2(R1).  Verification  of  the  compendial  analytical  methods  for  sterility,  endotoxin  and  mycoplasma  are 
performed in accordance with Ph. Eur. Summaries of the validation and verification reports for each method are 
provided. 
Batch analysis data are available for lots of PG13-CD19-H3 vector manufactured and released in accordance 
with cGMP. 
The analytical methods for PG13-CD19-H3 vector produce quantitative results. 
Stability (PG13-CD19-H3 retroviral vector) 
The stability of the PG13-CD19-H3 vector is being evaluated via long-term studies. In addition, the stability of 
PG13-CD19-H3 vector stored at either accelerated or stress (room temperature) conditions has been evaluated. 
All studies were conducted in accordance with ICH Q5C Quality of Biotechnological Products: Stability Testing of 
Biotechnological/Biological Products.  
Long-term stability studies are ongoing with eight lots of PG13-CD19-H3 vector stored at the recommended 
storage temperature. These studies are being conducted with two lots used for clinical production, two lots used 
for  process  validation  (PV)  and  potential  commercial  production,  and  four  lots  designated  for  commercial 
production. All of the PG13-CD19-H3 vector lots were manufactured by the commercial manufacturer. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 20/131 
 
  
  
PG13-CD19-H3 vector was exposed to elevated temperature to support potential temperature excursions that 
may occur during long term storage or during transportation. Samples from three lots of PG13-CD19-H3 vector 
were stored.  
Based on available long-term and accelerated stability data for vector PG13-CD19-H3, the proposed shelf-life of 
and is considered acceptable. Updated stability results for the retroviral PG13-CD19-H3 vector are provided. 
Stress testing of vector PG13-CD19-H3 at room-temperature was performed. This data confirm that the vector 
particles are sensitive to increased temperature. During the manufacturing of KTE-X19, the vector supernatant 
is incubated before adding of cells for the transduction step. The pre-incubation step does slightly lower the 
infectivity of the vector particles, as indicated by the calculation provided by the applicant considering a vector. 
The applicant provided data of a comprehensive binding study, confirming that the number of vector particles 
bound at or below the lower titre specification results in a sufficient transduction rate. These data confirm that 
the established transduction step results into the binding of a sufficient amount of vector particle. The applicant 
clarified that the vector is thawed, the maximal hold time after thawing, which is considered adequate. 
2.2. Part 2: active substance KTE-X19 
General Information (KTE-X19) 
The  active  substance  comprised  in  Tecartus  contains  autologous  T-cells  transduced  ex  vivo  with  a 
replication-deficient γ-retroviral vector containing an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). CD19 is a 95 
kDa  transmembrane  protein  selectively  expressed  in  both  normal  and  malignant  B  cells.  CARs  are  fusion 
proteins with antigen binding, transmembrane, and T-cell activation domains that, when expressed in T-cells, 
can target tumour antigens through T-cell mediated killing.  
The  CAR  target  binding  domain  is  a  single  chain  variable  region  fragment  (scFv)  derived  from  the  FMC63 
monoclonal  antibody  (mAb).  The  antigen-binding  domain  of  the  anti-CD19  CAR  construct  encompasses  the 
following domains:  
• 
The FMC63 antibody light chain variable domain (complementary determining regions [CDR] 1 and 2);  
•  A peptide linker; 
• 
the FMC63 antibody heavy chain variable domain (CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3). 
Comparative analysis demonstrated that the specificity of the scFv was equivalent to that of the original FMC63 
mAb.  
A  membrane  proximal  extracellular  domain  of  the  co-stimulatory  receptor  CD28  joins  the  scFv  to  a  CD28 
transmembrane domain and functions as a “hinge.” An intracellular signalling domain of CD28 connects the 
extracellular scFv portion with the intracellular CD3ζ portion at the terminus of the CAR construct. The CD3ζ and 
co-stimulatory CD28 domains are signalling following CAR engagement to induce T-cell activation, proliferation, 
and acquisition of effector functions. 
Details on the CAR protein construct within the transduced T-cells together with a description of the different 
CAR domains and their main function are provided in the dossier.

Manufacture, process controls and characterisation (KTE-X19) 
Description of the manufacturing process  
KTE-X19 is manufactured by Kite Pharma, Inc, (California, USA. 
The manufacturing process of KTE-X19 starts with apheresis collection from a patient. The next steps in the 
manufacturing process include T-cell enrichment, T-cell activation, retroviral transduction and T-cell expansion.  
Control of materials 
All apheresis sites and personnel involved in handling and testing of the apheresis material are stated to be 
qualified  by  a  competent  authority  for  the  purpose  of  those  activities  according  to  relevant  Commission 
Directives in each member state. Testing of apheresis material is carried out using CE-marked testing kits where 
appropriate. The patient’s serum or plasma is tested in accordance with the requirements described in Directive 
2006/17/EC. Procurement of the apheresis starting material is performed using different standard apheresis 
equipment. Based on clinical studies, the minimal number of total viable cells in the apheresis material required 
to make dose is 2.8 x 108 total viable cells.  
The reagents used in the manufacture of KTE-X19 are provided by approved suppliers qualified for use by the 
applicant; and the applicant performs incoming sampling, inspection and testing per approved specifications. 
The acceptance criteria provided for the raw materials seem appropriate. Certificate of analysis, certificate of 
conformance and product information files are provided. Control of the retroviral vector is provided in a separate 
active substance section, which is considered acceptable.  
Consumables  identified  as  high  risk  were  tested  for  extractables  and  leachables.  Studies  simulated  the 
conditions of use for the Yescarta manufacturing process. Toxicology assessments for the identified inorganic 
extractables (zinc and silicon) were found acceptable.  
Control of critical steps 
IPCs were established using a risk-based approach.  
Process validation 
The process validation, also referred to as process performance qualification (PPQ), consisted of PPQ batches 
using apheresis from independent healthy donors. The PPQ batches were split in groups to support the various 
process options  
Data from KTE-X19 batches were used to establish the process validation acceptance criteria, of which were 
clinical batches and were healthy donor batches manufactured under GMP conditions or development batches. 
Criteria were based on healthy donor batches manufactured in the development laboratory. A summary of the 
subgroup  analysis  for  the  different  process  validation  acceptance  criteria  (PVACs)  dataset  according  to  the 
different manufacturing streams has been provided.,  
Apheresis material attributes, manufacturing steps, final product release tests, impurities, process parameters 
and two worst-case operations were validated.  
Overall, the extent of validation data presented is considered adequate.  
OPV is based on a monitoring and review programme established as part of the quality management system to 
define, collect, analyse, and respond to trends in process performance and product quality data.

The  manufacturing  process  for  KTE-X19  is  based  on  the  Yescarta  manufacturing  process.  The  KTE-X19 
manufacturing process uses the identical anti-CD19 CAR construct and PG13-CD19-H3 vector that are used in 
the Yescarta process. A detailed comparison of the Yescarta and KTE-X19 processes is provided. 
For the KTE-X19 process, similar to the Yescarta process, activation is followed by transduction with a retroviral 
vector encoding the anti-CD19 CAR transgene  
For manufacturing steps common to Yescarta, existing development data have been used and supplemented as 
needed with additional KTE-X19-specific studies using apheresis material from healthy donors and patients as 
appropriate.  
Based on the Yescarta manufacturing experience, risk-based process characterisation studies were performed 
aiming to evaluate/classify critical and non-critical process parameters and to establish a control strategy for 
commercial manufacturing.  
Development and characterisation studies were conducted using apheresis material from healthy donors and 
clinical subjects. It is appreciated that excess apheresis material from clinical subjects are also used. . The use 
of a small-scale model with material from healthy donor is not considered fully representative for the full-scale 
performance but is considered acceptable as part of DoE studies.  
Apheresis starting material was analysed regarding use of different apheresis equipment, different apheresis 
storage  temperatures  and  time  and  their  impact  on  performance  parameters  as  well  as  product  quality 
attributes. From the single batches compared, apheresis equipment has no impact on the analysed parameters. 
Normal  operating  ranges  (NORs)  and  various  proven  acceptable  ranges  (PARs)  are  proposed  for  different 
apheresis storage temperatures and times supported by data.  
The T-cell labelling and enrichment process parameters were evaluated, and demonstrated to have no impact on 
critical quality attributes. Appropriate PARs have been established for the respective process parameters. With 
regard  to  the  wash  steps  contained  in  the  KTE-X19  manufacturing  process,  knowledge  from  the  Yescarta 
process has been used where applicable and KTE-X19 specific studies evaluating impact of process times and 
extended hold times have been performed and PARs identified.  
Cell culture media parameters were also evaluated, and none of the parameters was classified as critical within 
the characterised range. 
Overall, manufacturing process development is considered satisfactory. 
Characterisation 
Elucidation of structure 
Characterisation studies have been performed to analyse the impact of the physical and biological properties of 
KTE-X19 on the mechanism of action. This includes analysis of (i) CAR sequence integration into the host cell 
genome, (ii) CAR expression, antigen recognition and engagement, (iii) T-cell activation and proliferation, (iv) 
production  of  cytokines  and  chemokines,  (v)  killing  of  target  cells  and  (vi)  CAR-T-cell  composition  and 
phenotype.

Impurities 
Process-related impurities were addressed by theoretical clearance calculations based on the individual wash 
steps as well as through analytical testing. Acceptance limits were defined risk-based from existing limits in 
literature and guidelines and from information on toxicological or adverse health effects associated with the 
individual impurity.  
Experimental  data  on  impurities  related  to  reagents  that  have  been  introduced  during  the  manufacturing 
process as well as impurities introduced with the retroviral vector have been presented from development runs. 
Individual data from the development and/or engineering runs analysed have been presented showing overall 
acceptable  depletion-rates  as  well  as  residual  quantities  per  dose.  Absence  of  residual  infectious  retroviral 
particles in the final wash supernatant and shown to be below the limit of detection of the method. Clearance of 
is not monitored as the potential maximum amount per dose is considered to be.  
A  description  of  the  methods  employed  for  quantitation  of  impurities  has  been  provided  along  with  assay 
acceptance criteria and a summary of the analytical method´s qualification/validation status.  
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, and 
container closure (KTE-X19) 
As  the  manufacturing  process  for  KTE-X19  is  a  continuous  process,  the  transition  from  active  substance  to 
finished product does not include any hold steps. Therefore, specification, analytical procedures, validation of 
analytical procedures, batch analysis and justification of specifications, are provided in the final product section. 
Considering the nature of the product, the applicant’s approach is considered acceptable. 
No release of active substance is performed. 
Stability (KTE-X19) 
As  no  hold  step  is  foreseen  at  active  substance  level  before  manufacturing  of  finished  product,  no  stability 
studies have been performed at that level.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development   
The transduced T-cells are formulated in a cryopreservation medium suitable for infusion. Each final product bag 
of Tecartus is filled to deliver a target dose of 1.0x106 - 2.0x106 anti-CD19 CAR-positive viable T-cells/kg of 
patient weight (maximum allowable dose: 2.0x108 anti-CD19 CAR-positive viable T-cells/kg based on patient 
weight ≥100 kg). Tecartus is supplied cryopreserved at a temperature of ≤ -150°C in cryostorage EVA bags with 
sealed addition tube and two available spike ports. The cryostorage bag contains a nominal 68 mL of Tecartus. 
The composition of Tecartus consists of anti-CD19 CAR-positive viable T cells formulated with Cryostor CS10, 
sodium chloride and human albumin. 
The  excipients  used  in  the  formulation  of  finished  product  are  sodium  chloride  injection  (Ph.  Eur.),  albumin 
(human serum albumin, HSA) (Ph. Eur.), and CryoStor CS10 which is a cryopreservative agent containing DMSO 
(Ph. Eur.).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 24/131 
 
  
  
The final product composition is based on results from the Yescarta process development and characterisation 
and consists of the same excipients for formulation as well as the same cryopreservation programme.  
A semi-automated formulation and filling method was developed for use as an alternative to manual formulation 
and filling in the Tecartus process. It consists of a single-use, sterile, closed-system fluid path and bag set which 
is  loaded  on  a  fluid  transfer  panel  with  active  temperature  and  mixing  control.  The  results  demonstrated 
acceptable mixing homogeneity, fill volume and dose uniformity, closed-system integrity, and product quality 
attributes pre and post- cryopreservation, as compared to a manual process. Information on the custom-made 
bag system including specifications regarding microbiological safety, has been provided. 
Following the formulation step, the final product bag containing Tecartus is aseptically sealed and transferred to 
a cassette for cryopreservation. For the cryopreservation process step, temperature profiles for Yescarta that 
showed  consistency  in  the  freeze  cycle  was  used  for  Tecartus  final  products.  In  Tecartus  stability  studies, 
however,  smaller  bags  of  identical  material  are  used.  Cryopreservation  of  one  or  two  product  bags  was 
comparable.  Transfer  between  the  CRF  and  storage  in  LN2  is  performed  using  a  CryoPod  (portable  LN2 
vapor-based carrier). Comparable temperature profiles for freezing have been demonstrated. 
Two primary container closure systems consisting of the same material (EVA) are used. Characterisation studies 
were  performed  with  Yescarta  material,  which  is  acceptable  taking  into  account  the  similarities  of  the  two 
products. The suitability of both primary container closure systems was evaluated by extractable and leachable 
testing. The low amounts of silicon and zinc detected in the are not expected to have any toxicological impact.  
Risks associated with elemental impurities in the KTE-X19 finished product were evaluated with respect to ICH 
Q3D guidance, and a summary was provided. All applicable sources of elemental impurities described in ICH 
Q3D were considered, including manufacturing process (equipment), final product container and excipients. All 
failure modes were assessed to be low risk and no further action is required. Finally, KTE-X19 is a parenteral 
single  dose  administration  of  68  mL  product,  hence  there  is  no  risk  of  continuous  exposure  of  elemental 
impurities over time. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The names and addresses of the facilities involved in Tecartus manufacturing along with a description of the 
manufacturing activities for which each site is responsible, are provided. 
A manufacturing license and a QP declaration concerning GMP compliance of the active substance manufacture 
have been provided. For the MIA for reference to EudraGMDP is made. This is acceptable. 
The Tecartus process is continuous from active substance to finished product, with no intervening hold step. 
Process validation for the entire manufacturing process, from apheresis material to cryopreserved Tecartus, is 
described in the active substance section of the dossier. 
Depending on the sufficient cells may be available to formulate two final product bags. Each bag of Tecartus is 
filled  to  deliver  a  target  dose  of  2.0x106  CAR  T-cells/kg  of  patient  weight  in  a  nominal  volume  of  68  mL. 
Formulation of the Tecartus final product bags can be performed using a manual process or a semi-automated 
process. Manual or semi-automated filling will be performed. Comparability between the two processes has been 
demonstrated. The cell suspension is transferred to the final product bag. The cells are formulated with sodium 
chloride  (NaCl),  HSA,  and  CryoStor  CS10,  aseptically  sealed,  inspected  for  visible  particulates,  labelled  and 
cryopreserved  at  ≤-150°C.  Precise  quantities  of  excipients,  and  values  for  the  process  parameters,  normal 
operating range/target and proven acceptable range, have been included.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 25/131 
 
  
  
For the cryopreservation step, the same freeze cycle as used for Yescarta is established for Tecartus. A CryoPod 
(a portable liquid-nitrogen vapour-based carrier), is used in the process to transfer cryopreserved product bags 
between  the  controlled  rate  freezer  and  storage  in  liquid-nitrogen,  and  again  during  transfer  from 
liquid-nitrogen storage to the liquid-nitrogen shipper. The transportation of cryopreserved Tecartus within the 
container  closure  in  a  dry-vapour  liquid-nitrogen  shipper  at  a  temperature  range  of  below  ≤-150°C)  was 
acceptably validated.  
Product specification 
Product  release  specifications  have only  been  defined  on the finished  product level  since  the  manufacturing 
process from receipt of the apheresis starting material through to finished product is continuous and no active 
substance is isolated. The finished product specifications include tests for identity, content, potency, purity and 
safety.  The  term  “viable”  was  included  in  the  acceptance  criteria  for  commercial  dose:  1.0x106  –  2.0x106 
anti-CD19 CAR viable T-cells/kg, and maximum allowable dose: 2.0x108 anti-CD19 CAR viable T-cells based on 
patient weight ≥100 kg.  
The  analytical  methods,  the  corresponding  pre-set  acceptance  criteria,  and  the  sample  points,  have  been 
provided  in  the  specification  table.  The  specification  table  was  updated  to  include  the  unique  identification 
numbers of the analytical method applied.  
Analytical methods 
Analytical  methods have  been  described  and  are  validated  using  Yescarta  material.  Some  clarifications  with 
regard to dose calculation and consistent operation of the flow cytometry and NucleoCounter method have been 
provided.  Revalidation  using  Tecartus  has  been  performed  for  a  defined  panel  of  parameters.  The applicant 
provided also an updated validation documentation for each analytical method containing method validation 
summary for Tecartus with corresponding validation of the method. 
The same microbiological sampling and testing strategy is applied as for Yescarta with all microbiological test 
results completed. The microbiological release control has been sufficiently qualified for the Tecartus matrix. The 
sample matrix for testing has been confirmed to be identical between Tecartus and Yescarta. In addition, a 
product-specific method qualification was successfully completed regarding parameter accuracy, repeatability 
and  intermediate  precision.  This  deems  to  further  support  absence  of  method  interference  for  the  Tecartus 
matrix.  
Aseptic  processing  appears  adequately  controlled  via  aseptic  process  validation  and  aseptic  operator 
qualification  (AOQ).  This  includes  relevant  media  simulation  runs  using  tryptic  soy  broth  in  place  of  raw 
materials  and  product  component.  All  runs  were  successfully  completed  including  demonstration  of  media 
performance. 
Batch analysis 
Batch data are provided for a total of. Batch data for PPQ lots manufactured from healthy donor material have 
been provided. The applicant presented information about all initiated clinical manufacturing starts, including 
out-of-specification batches and terminated batches, for both including the identified root cause.  
Stability of the product 
The stability of Tecartus has been investigated in long-term, accelerated and stress testing studies. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 26/131 
 
  
  
PPQ lots, healthy donor lots and lots from clinical subjects have been placed in long-term stability studies. Lots 
from  clinical  subjects  are  derived  from  patients  that  have  dropped  off  the  clinical  trial.  Commercial  and 
“protocol” acceptance criteria are intermittently used in the presentation of stability data due to evolving of the 
release acceptance criteria based on the progress made in process development. 
The  presented  long-term  stability  results  from  clinical  patient  lots  of  Tecartus,  stored  at  the  recommended 
storage condition are within the “protocol” acceptance criteria for most of the results of the ten lots. The results 
suggest that clinical patient lots stored at the recommended storage condition remain viable for months.  
PPQ and post-PPQ healthy donor stability studies have been tested at release to demonstrate product stability 
according to “protocol” acceptance criteria. All results met the acceptance criteria with the exception of four lots. 
Data on the investigation and corrective actions taken with regard to these lots have been provided. Overall, the 
results  from  the  PPQ  batches  are  complex  to  trend  for  the  various  conditions  investigated.  The  applicant 
provided the results from the PPQ stability study in separate figures for each condition as requested. No trend in 
the results was detected.  
The  claimed  shelf  life  of  12  months  when  stored  in  the  vapour  phase  of  liquid  nitrogen  (≤  -150°C)  for  the 
Tecartus  final  product  in  cryostorage  bags  is  considered  acceptable.  Tecartus  must  remain  frozen  until  the 
patient is ready for treatment to ensure viable live autologous cells are available for patient administration.  
All results from accelerated studies were within the proposed commercial acceptance criteria. Stress testing was 
performed on Tecartus lot with dose sourced from healthy donor material and stored. The suitability of tests to 
be stability-indicating was confirmed. 
In-use  stability  testing  revealed  that  post-thawed  Tecartus  lots  are  stable  for 3  hours  at  room  temperature 
(20°C to 25°C). Thawing instructions in the SmPC indicate that Tecartus infusion should begin within 30 minutes 
of thaw completion time and total Tecartus infusion time should not exceed 30 minutes. Thawed product should 
not be refrozen. 
Cracked  cryobags  were  reported  for  during  long-term  stability  studies  at  the  months’  time  point  each.  The 
applicant  has  identified  the  most  probable  root  cause  for  the  observed  container  defects  and  implemented 
respective CAPAs.  
Adventitious agents 
TSE compliance 
Donors  of  the  T-cells  are  of  autologous  origin,  therefore,  defined  selection  criteria  with  regard  to 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) do not apply according to Directive 2006/17/EC. Foetal bovine serum (FBS) is 
used during production of the retroviral vector PG13-CD19-CAR-H3 and has been used during production of the 
vector producing cell banks. For all FBS valid certificates of suitability issued by the EDQM are provided. The cells 
of  the  vector  cell bank  are  of  murine origin  with  no  TSE  relevance.  HSA  used  as  excipient  and holds  an  EU 
marketing authorisation. All relevant marketing authorisation numbers in the EU are listed in a summary table 
for  sources  of  adventitious  viruses.  In  summary,  compliance  with  the  TSE  guideline  for  all  raw  materials  of 
animal origin and with EU Directives for human-derived materials has been demonstrated.  
Virus safety 
Due to the nature of the product, the manufacturing process of the PG13-CD19-H3 vector and of the Tecartus 
finished product does not contain any step that removes or inactivates viruses. In addition, the final finished 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 27/131 
 
  
  
product is not tested for adventitious viruses. Control of adventitious agents is mainly based on selection and 
testing of starting materials and raw materials of biological origin and testing of the retroviral vector. In order to 
ensure  safety  of  the  product,  procedural  controls  are  followed  for  acceptance  of  material  used  in  the 
manufacture of PG13-CD19-H3 vector and KTE-X19. These controls are as follows: 
1. Safety testing of the PG13-CD19-CAR-H3 master cell bank and PG13-CD19-CAR-H3 working cell bank 
2. Procedural controls, raw material controls, and safety testing of the PG13-CD19-H3 vector 
3. Media and reagents used in the manufacturing of Tecartus are sourced from qualified vendors 
This strategy is considered acceptable. 
In summary, the virus safety of Tecartus is sufficiently shown. 
GMO 
The  GMO  are  autologous  T-cells  genetically  modified  with  a  non-SIN  retroviral  vector  based  on  MSCV 
pseudotyped with the GALV envelope protein and encoding the CAR consisting of a CD19-specific scFv and the 
CD28/CD3zeta  costimulatory  domains  under  control  of  the  MSCV  5´LTR  enhancer/promoter  region  (see 
non-clinical section for further information).  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the quality part of the dossier is of an acceptable standard.  
The manufacturing process for KTE-X19 is based on the Yescarta manufacturing process and uses the identical 
murine gamma retroviral PG13-CD19-H3. The use of existing development data from Yescarta for process steps 
common to both the Yescarta and Tecartus processes is considered acceptable.  
Apart from minor deficiencies satisfactorily addressed during the procedure, the manufacturing process and the 
associated process controls have been adequately described. Critical process steps and parameters have been 
identified and PARs and NORs have been established in process characterisation studies using both knowledge 
from  the  Yescarta  process  as  well  as  from  KTE-X19  specific  studies  using  both  healthy  donor  and  patient 
apheresis material.  
For the retroviral transduction, differences between the Yescarta and KTE-X19 unit operations are considered 
significant, which required re-evaluation of the transduction process parameters. Data have been presented by 
the applicant, suggesting consistent T-cell transduction.  
The process is validated appropriately against pre-established process validation acceptance criteria based on 
data from clinical and healthy donor lots and considering the different manufacturing scenarios. In addition, 
shipper qualification and validation of transport of the apheresis material has been performed. 
The  KTE-X19  process  has  been  demonstrated  to  deplete  both  product-related  as  well  as  process-related 
impurities and hence no tests for impurities, neither at the level of the retroviral vector nor for the release of 
Tecartus finished product are included, which is acceptable 
Due to the continuous nature of the Tecartus manufacturing process, no active substance specifications have 
been established which is considered acceptable. 
The final product composition is based on results from the Yescarta process development and characterisation 
and consists of the same excipients for formulation. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 28/131 
 
  
  
The production process for final product is considered validated and results in a finished product of acceptable 
quality.  The  proposal  to  use  a  semi-automated  formulation  and  filling  method  as  an  alternative  to  manual 
formulation and filling in the Tecartus process is acceptable.  
The term “viable” was included in the acceptance criteria for commercial dose. Due to the nature of the product, 
the large variability of the cellular starting material from highly pre-treated patients and the complexity of the 
manufacturing process, the specification limits are set fairly wide.  
The batches used in the clinical trials were manufactured with the commercial manufacturing process. Batch 
data have been provided for clinical batches and suggest a consistent manufacturing process. Information about 
manufacturing conditions for the PPQ lots has been provided.  
Long-term  stability  data  have  been  provided  for  a  sufficient  number  of  batches  including  lots  from  clinical 
subjects supporting the proposed shelf life of 12 months for Tecartus when stored at -150°C.  
To  avoid  further  cryobag  defects  during  storage  and  handling  in  the  cryopreserved  status,  the  applicant 
implemented the use of foam inserts in the aluminium cassette as part of CAPAs. Data on the comparability of 
the cryopreservation process with or without foam insert and further information about the material and size of 
the foam insert have been provided. 
In July 2020, CHMP extended the call for review of nitrosamines impurities to all biologics. As a consequence, the 
applicant committed to provide a risk evaluation on the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in Tecartus 
within  six  months  of  the  marketing  authorisation.  In  the  event  that  a  risk  of  presence  of  nitrosamines  is 
identified, confirmatory testing should be carried out using appropriately validated and sensitive methods within 
a year after the marketing authorisation or at an earlier time if otherwise justified. If nitrosamine impurities are 
found to be present, appropriate risk mitigation steps should be implemented (Recommendation). Considering 
the low risk for this product, the unmet medical need and the fact that the CHMP call for review for biologics was 
made at a late stage of this accelerated assessment procedure, it is considered acceptable, in this specific case, 
to address this matter as a post-authorisation Recommendation. 
The TSE and virus safety of Tecartus has been sufficiently shown. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The overall quality of Tecartus is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in 
the SmPC. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with 
existing guidelines. The manufacturing process of the active substance is adequately described, controlled and 
validated. The active substance is well characterised and appropriate specifications are set. The manufacturing 
process of the finished product has been satisfactorily described and validated. The quality of the finished 
product is controlled by adequate test methods and specifications. Adventitious agents safety including TSE 
have been sufficiently assured.  
In conclusion, based on the review of the quality data provided, the marketing authorisation application for 
Tecartus is considered approvable from the quality point of view.  
The CHMP endorse the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects as described above. 
The applicant agreed to the Recommendations as identified below.

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CAT 
recommends several points for investigation: 
The  CHMP  endorse  the  CAT  assessment  regarding  the  recommendations  for  future  quality  development  as 
described above. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  applicant  provided  non-clinical  pharmacology  data  confirming  the  in  vitro  functionality  of  KTE-X19. 
Additional  non-clinical  data  supporting  the  development  of  KTE-X19  are  leveraged  from  data  generated  in 
support  of  axicabtagene  ciloleucel,  the  applicant’s  first  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  product.  Both  KTE-X19  and 
axicabtagene ciloleucel use the same retroviral vector, producer clone, and anti-CD19 CAR transgene. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
CD19 Expression Profile Summary 
Targeting  B-lineage  haematologic  malignancies  via  CD19  is  based  on  earlier  findings  demonstrating  that 
expression of CD19 is restricted to cells, both normal and malignant, of the B-lineage, including mantle cell 
lymphoma (MCL) (Leonard 2001). Early publications by Nadler and colleagues (Nadler et al, 1983; Anderson et 
al, 1984) showed that CD19 protein is expressed on all B-lineage lymphoid cells, from the pro-B-cell maturation 
stage to naïve and differentiated B cells. Uckun and colleagues (Uckun et al, 1988) confirmed and extended 
these  findings  by  demonstrating  that  leukemic  progenitor  B  cells  also  express  CD19,  and  that  erythroid, 
myeloid, megakaryocytoid, and multilineage normal bone marrow progenitor cells do not express CD19. More 
recently, Johnson and colleagues (Johnson et al, 2009) showed that primary lymphoma cells from patients with 
diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma  (DLBCL)  expressed  CD19,  whereas  reference  T  cells  did  not.  Olejniczak  and 
colleagues (Olejniczak et al, 2006) examined the expression pattern and levels of CD19 in peripheral blood, 
bone  marrow,  and  lymph  node  tissue  from  patients  with  6  different  common  B-cell  malignancies  (chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia [CLL], small lymphocytic lymphoma [SLL], B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], 
hairy  cell  leukemia  [HCL],  DLBCL,  and  follicular  lymphoma  [FL]).  Nearly  all  samples  within  each  type  were 
considered positive for CD19. Expression levels of CD19 were variable across the different B-cell malignancies, 
but  all  B-cell  malignancies  examined  showed  consistently  measurable  levels  of  CD19  expression  above 
reference CD3+ T cells.  
Other  investigators  have  shown  that  CD19  is  expressed  in  MCL  (Leonard  et  al.,  2001;  Ginaldi  et  al.  1998; 
Cabezudo  1999;  D’Arena  et  al.,  2000;  Marcondes  et  al.,  2017;    Yang  et  al.,  2005;    Argatoff  et  al.,  1997). 
Demonstration  of  clinical  activity  of  an  anti-CD19  CAR  in  a  chemotherapy-refractory  MCL  patient  further 
highlights the applicability of CD19 as a CAR target in MCL (Chen et al., 2016). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 30/131 
 
  
  
In summary, evidence from key published literature demonstrates that CD19 is expressed on the surface of 
normal B-lineage cells as well as most B-cell malignancies, including MCL, a subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
(NHL). 
In vitro characterisation of anti-CD19-transduced human T cells 
For initial in vitro evaluation of specific activity against CD19+ target cells, the applicant used CD19 CAR T cells 
from  patients  that  were  enrolled  in  clinical  trials  conducted  by  the  National  Cancer  Institute  (NCI).  Specific 
activity of these anti-CD19 CAR T cells was evaluated and cytotoxicity upon binding of the CD19 CAR T cells to 
its  target  antigen  CD19.  Thereby,  the  specificity  of  the  CD19-CAR  T  cells  for  its  target  antigen  has  been 
confirmed by inclusion of appropriate negative controls, such as CD19- target cells, untransduced T cells and T 
cells transduced with a CD19-unrelated CAR construct (SP6-28Z). CD19 CAR T cells from patients with advanced 
B-cell  haematologic  malignancies  manufactured  at  NCI  were  used  for  evaluation  of  different  cytokine, 
chemokine,  and  effector  molecule  release  upon  co-culture  with  CD19+  and  CD19-  target  cells.  Therefore,  a 
LuminexTM analysis  involving  17  analytes  comprising  markers  for  immune  cell  homeostasis  and  proliferation 
(IL-2), pro-inflammatory activity (IL-6, IL-13, TNF-α, GM-CSF), immune-modulating activity (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, 
IFN-γ, CD137), chemokines (MIP-1α, MIP-1β), and effector molecules (granzyme A, granzyme B, soluble FAS, 
sFASL, perforin) has been performed. 
The manufacturing processes used to generate the CD19 CAR T cells at NCI, and subsequently axicabtagene 
ciloleucel, are similar, but not equivalent, to the process used to manufacture KTE-X19.  
In vitro characterisation of anti-CD19 T cells generated by the KTE-X19 manufacturing process 
Using  apheresis  material  from  two  healthy  human  donors,  anti-CD19  CAR  T  cells  were  produced  by  a 
scaled-down KTE-X19 manufacturing process and were characterised in vitro. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activation, 
as measured by cell expansion (total number of cells), diameter, and viability were assessed on Days 0, 1, 6, 9, 
and 13. Most of the cells were frozen on Day 9 for subsequent functional characterisation studies while a small 
proportion  of  cells  were  kept  in  culture  for  additional  phenotypic  CAR  characterisation  over  time.  Upon 
activation, T cells from both donors increased in mean cell diameter from Day 0 to Day 1 and expanded 393- and 
155-fold for T cells from Donor 1 and Donor 2, respectively, between Days 1 and 13. Mean T-cell viability ranged 
from 76.9% to 91.7% on all days measured (spanning Days 0 to 13). Transduction efficiency was monitored on 
Days 6, 9, 13, and 16 by flow cytometry using fluorophore-labelled, custom-made antibodies (KIP-1 and KIP-3) 
that bind to the scFv region of the engineered CAR T cell. Transduction was stable over time for T cells from both 
donors. 
In a separate study, anti-CD19 CAR T-cell products generated from apheresis material from 2 healthy human 
donors from a scaled-down KTE-X19 manufacturing process (described in the study above; harvested on Day 9) 
as well as an additional anti-CD19 CAR T-cell product generated by the at-scale KTE-X19 manufacturing process 
from apheresis material from another healthy human donor (harvested on Day 6) were assessed functionally. 
Each  of  the  3  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  products  were  co-cultured  with  CD19+  B-lineage  acute  lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (Nalm6) target cells, CD19+ B-cell lymphoma (Raji) target cells, and CD19-knockout (Raji CD19KO) 
target  control  cells.  CAR  T  cells  derived  from  all  3  donors  proliferated  approximately  80%  in  response  to 
co-culture  with  CD19+  target  cells  at  Day  4  after  co-culture  initiation.  By  comparison,  only  homeostatic 
proliferation (approximately 10% to 20%) was observed with nontransduced T cells co-cultured with CD19+ 
target cells. All 3 donor-derived anti-CD19 CAR T-cell products co-cultured overnight with CD19+ target cells 
resulted in measurable levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-2 cytokine production. All three donor-derived anti-CD19 
CAR  T-cell  products  tested  were  cytotoxic  to  CD19+  target  cells  in  a  dose-dependent  manner.  Results  with

controls (nontransduced T cells and/or CD19− target cells) demonstrated that proliferation, cytokine production, 
and cytotoxicity were specific to anti-CD19 CAR T cells and dependent on CD19 antigen engagement. 
In vitro and in vivo activity of surrogate anti-murine CD19 CAR T cells 
Since the anti-CD19 scFv utilised for KTE-X19 does only recognise human CD19, a murine surrogate model was 
engineered for non-clinical proof-of-concept studies in immune competent mice. This surrogate model used an 
anti-murine CD19 CAR construct that was similar to KTE-X19 with the exception of the scFv, which has been 
derived from the 1D3 mAb recognizing murine CD19. Murine T cells were transduced with the anti-murine CD19 
CAR construct and adoptively transferred into syngeneic mice which underwent TBI at 5 Gy for lymphodepletion 
and were challenged with a CD19-expressing 38c13 lymphoma cell line to investigate the anti-lymphoma effect 
of the anti-murine CD19 CAR T cells.  
The administration of the anti-murine CD19 CAR T cells into the syngeneic mouse lymphoma model revealed 
both  the  ability  of  the  CD19  CAR  T  cells  to  prevent  establishment  of  a  lymphoma  and  to  eradicate  already 
established lymphoma masses including metastasis. Administration of the anti-murine CD19 CAR T cells in both 
the prophylactic and the therapeutic setting resulted in prolonged survival of the mice while control animals 
became rapidly moribund due to lymphoma and were euthanised. Using the syngeneic mouse lymphoma model, 
the applicant also investigated the influence of total body irradiation (TBI) prior to the administration of the 
lymphoma cells and the CD19 CAR T cells which revealed the importance of the TBI-induced lymphodepletion for 
prolonged survival of these animals and thus for a successful outcome of the CAR T cell therapy. 
In addition, the surrogate murine CD19 CAR T cells were investigated in vitro for CD19-specific activation in 
co-cultures of the anti-murine CD19 CAR T cells and CD19+ and CD19- target cells. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology and pharmacodynamic drug 
interaction studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies, safety pharmacology studies and pharmacodynamic drug interaction 
studies were conducted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No formal non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies were conducted. Absence of absorption, distribution, metabolism 
and excretion (ADME) studies is justified, since in accordance with the regulatory guidance for gene therapy 
medicinal products (GTMPs) (Guideline on the quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects of gene therapy medicinal 
products, EMA/CAT/80183/2014) conventional ADME studies are not required. 
Although  no  formal  non-clinical  pharmacokinetic  studies  of  KTE-X19  were  conducted,  the  persistence  of 
anti-murine CD19 CAR T cells was examined in the syngeneic mouse lymphoma model using flow cytometry 
analysis. Results from this experiment showed that CD4+and CD8+anti-murine CD19 CAR T cells remained in the 
spleens of treated mice up to 1 week following injection. Anti-murine CD19 CAR T cells were not detected in the 
spleens of treated mice at Day 63 after injection of CAR T cells; longer follow-up for anti-murine CD19 CAR T 
cells was not examined. However, findings from other experiments showed that mice treated with anti-murine 
CD19 CAR T cells remained free of leukaemia up to 209 days (the last time point examined) after receiving the 
injection, suggesting that the anti-lymphoma effect was maintained long term. 
No other non-clinical pharmacokinetic analyses were performed.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Formal single-dose study in animals was not performed for KTE-X19. KTE-X19 is intended to be administered as 
a single infusion treatment therefore no repeat-dose toxicities study was conducted. In addition, due lack of 
suitable  animal  model  and  applicability  of  traditional  toxicology  tests,  non-clinical  studies  on  safety 
pharmacology,  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity,  and  genotoxicity/carcinogenicity  were  also  not 
conducted. 
The only safety aspects that were included in the non-clinical evaluation were: 
• 
• 
on-target/off-tumour toxicity of CD19 CAR T cells in the syngeneic mouse lymphoma model, and, 
analysis of Vector Integration Sites (VIS) in CAR T cells at the end of the manufacturing process have 
been conducted with KTE-X19 
On-target/off-tumour toxicity of CD19 CAR T cells in the syngeneic mouse lymphoma model has been evaluated 
during the pharmacology study in parallel with the anti-lymphoma effect and the persistence of the anti-murine 
CD19 CAR T cells. Results showed that normal B cells (which are CD19+), were eliminated in mice treated with 
anti-murine CD19 CAR T cells, but could be detected at Day 8 in mice treated with control CAR T cells. The 
inhibition of normal B-cell development persisted in mice treated with anti-murine CD19 CAR T cells; lack of 
normal  splenic  B  cells  was  observed  63  days,  143  days,  and  209  days  (the  last  time  point  examined)  after 
anti-murine CD19 CAR T-cell infusion, whereas T cells had recovered to normal levels at the time point of 143 
days  from  infusion.  Notably,  this  complete  and  prolonged  absence  of  B  cells  was  not  accompanied  by  any 
evidence  of  overt  toxicity.  The  prolonged  absence  of  B  cells  was  unique  to  mice  that  were  treated  with 
anti-murine CD19 CAR-transduced T cells, as control mice that received either 5 Gy of TBI alone or 5 Gy of TBI 
followed by infusions of T cells expressing the SP6-28Z.1-3 negative control CAR had detectable splenic B cells 
4  to  8  days  after  irradiation.  The  observed  prolonged  depletion  of  normal  B  cells  known  to  express  CD19 
confirmed  the  expected  on-target/off-tumour  effect  of  the  CD19  CAR  T  cells  on  normal  B  cells.  Additional 
toxicities of the anti-murine CD19 CAR T cells did not become evident in the pharmacology studies. 
VIS were assessed in CAR T cells manufactured from healthy donor T cells transduced with the retroviral vector 
used for the manufacture of KTE-X19. The data of this study were re-evaluated during the procedure using an 
improved bioinformatics analysis method. Thereby, the re-evaluation of the data revealed a considerably 
increased number of total VIS in all donors compared to the initial analysis, as well as lower numbers and 
percentages of VIS that were detected in more than 2 out of 5 aliquots analysed per Donor. The VIS analysis 
revealed an even distribution across the chromosomes and the number of VIS paralleled the number of 
transcription start sites (TSS) on each chromosome. Thereby, the vector integrated non-randomly near active 
TSS of T-cell-related genes. 10.2% to 10.6% of the identified VIS occurred within exons. The applicant 
concluded from the VIS analysis that no predominance of a single VIS was apparent. This conclusion is based on 
the probability of detecting a given VIS in 3 or more aliquots investigated per donor, which ranged between 
0.115%, 0.0403, and 0.0368% for Donor 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The number of unique identified VIS per 
donor ranged between 51684 and 91093 sites. Similarly, also the abundance of the top 100 VIS by chromosomal 
genomic coordinate per donor has been interpreted by the applicant as not revealing signs of 
over-representation of single VIS.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The risk for the environment in general and for transmission to third parties associated with the genetically 
modified  T  cells  is  considered  negligible,  as  genetically  modified  cells  cannot  survive  in  the  environment.  If 
transmitted to third parties through direct contact the genetically modified cells are expected to be recognised 
by the immune system and cleared rapidly. A residual risk for the environment and third parties might only be 
associated  with  residual 
infectious  viral  particles  present 
in 
the 
final  cell  suspension  and/or 
replication-competent  retroviruses  (RCR)  contaminating  the  viral  vector  suspension  or  being  generated 
following mobilisation of the integrated provirus. However, the applicant showed that the amount of residual 
infectious particles in KTE-X19 will be reduced to negligible concentrations during manufacturing. Moreover, the 
absence of RCR has been confirmed at different stages of the manufacturing process. The applicant showed that 
in clinical studies with KTE-X19 no RCR has been detected in the blood of patients. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Some of the presented non-clinical in vitro pharmacology studies were conducted with CD19 CAR T cells that 
were  generated  at  the  NCI  with  a  manufacturing  process  similar,  but  not  fully  equivalent  to  the  KTE-X19 
process. In order to complete the pharmacology data package, additional non-clinical in vitro pharmacology 
studies were conducted with CD19 CAR T cells manufactured using the KTE-X19 process. Thereby, the applicant 
followed the recommendation of the CHMP provided in a former protocol assistance of KTE-X19. In addition to 
the non-clinical in vitro data that were conducted with cells from healthy donors generated using the KTE-X19 
manufacturing process, additional characterisation data for KTE-X19 has been included in the quality part of the 
dossier.  These  additional  characterisation  data  revealed  a  similar  transduction  efficiency  of  KTE-X19  cells 
generated from healthy donors as compared to MCL patients. Moreover, poly-functionality of KTE-X19 has been 
demonstrated in the quality part by measuring secretion of multiple cytokines and chemokines upon binding of 
KTE-X19 to CD19+ target cells. 
Overall, the provided non-clinical in vitro data sufficiently demonstrate specific activity of KTE-X19 against its 
target antigen CD19. Moreover, poly-functionality of the CAR T cells at the end of the manufacturing process has 
been  demonstrated  for  the  cells  manufactured  at  NCI  using  LuminexTM  analysis  and  for  KTE-X19  using 
MesoScale Discovery® (MSD®) analysis. Although these data are rather considered as characterisation data of 
the  final product than  non-clinical  pharmacology  data,  they  are  still  important  as  they  support  the  versatile 
capability of KTE-X19 with regard to lymphocyte activation and effector mechanisms.   
In addition to the in vitro evaluation of KTE-X19, the applicant established murine surrogate CD19 CAR T cells 
for  in  vivo  evaluation  in  a  syngeneic  mouse  lymphoma  model.  This  approach  provided  important 
proof-of-concept for the overall design of the chosen CD19 CAR construct including for example the choice of the 
co-stimulatory domain. Such a surrogate model may also be considered as the most appropriate non-clinical 
model  for  investigating  the  persistence  of  the  CD19  CAR  T  cells  and  for  evaluating  potential 
on-target/off-tumour effects of the CAR T cells. On the other hand, it is evident that crucial parameters of the 
CAR T cell may differ between the murine surrogate CD19 CAR T cells and the human CD19 CAR T cells. This 
includes  for  example  the  binding  affinity  of  the  scFv,  the  manufacturing  of  the  transduced  cells,  and  the 
composition of T cell subsets. Despite these expected differences, the use of murine surrogate CD19 CAR T cells 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 34/131 
 
  
  
 
in  immunocompetent  mice  is  an  acceptable  approach  that  overcomes  some  of  the  limitations  of  the  in vivo 
testing of KTE-X19 in immunocompromised animals (e.g. unspecific xenogeneic immune responses of KTE-X19 
in mice, lack of complex interactions of the CAR T cells with other components of the immune system). Since 
both  models  do  have  clear,  although  differing,  limitations  with  regard  to  the  translation  of  the  non-clinical 
pharmacology  data  to  human,  additional  non-clinical  in  vivo  pharmacology  data  (e.g.  testing  of  KTE-X19  in 
immunocompromised animals transplanted with human CD19+ tumour cells) would not add significant value to 
the available non-clinical and clinical pharmacology data sets. 
Absence  of  secondary  pharmacodynamics  studies,  safety  pharmacology  studies  and  pharmacodynamic  drug 
interaction studies is acceptable based on the nature of the product and the limitations of the available animal 
models, respectively. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  provided  non-clinical  pharmacokinetic  investigations  focused  on  the  in  vivo  persistence  of  the  murine 
surrogate CAR T cells in the syngeneic mouse lymphoma model, which is acceptable for this type of product. The 
chosen model provides all necessary stimuli that are considered important for a specific activation, expansion, 
and survival of the CD19 CAR T cells (e.g. CD19+ target tumour cells, endogenous cytokines, chemokines and 
cellular interactions of a fully functional immune system). Despite these ideal preconditions, the anti-murine 
CD19  CAR  T  cells  could  only  be  detected  in  spleen  at  Day  8,  but  no  longer  at  Day  63  post-infusion.  Thus, 
persistence  of  CD19  CAR  T  cells  could  only  be  demonstrated  for  a  short  time  period,  despite  a  prolonged 
anti-lymphoma  effect  and  B-cell  aplasia,  which  were  evident  for  up  to  209  days  (the  latest  time  point 
investigated).  
Toxicology 
Similar as the pharmacology evaluation, also the non-clinical safety evaluation of KTE-X19 has been severely 
limited due to the lack of a relevant animal model. Therefore, no GLP-compliant formal toxicology studies were 
performed. Instead, the on-target/off-tumour effect on normal B cells was confirmed during the pharmacology 
studies in the syngeneic mouse lymphoma model. This effect on normal B cells was expected based on the 
expression  pattern  of  CD19  and  resulting  B  cell  aplasia  has  been  observed  in  both  the  syngeneic  mouse 
lymphoma model and in study participants that were treated with either axicabtagene ciloleucel or KTE-X19 in 
clinical trials. Consequently, B cell aplasia leading to hypogammaglobulinaemia has been included in Section 4.4 
of the summary of product characteristics (SPC). Other toxic effects of anti-murine CD19 CAR T cells were not 
evident  in  the  mouse  lymphoma  model.  However,  off-target  toxicities  are  also  not  expected  to  be  reliably 
detected in the surrogate mouse model, since off-target recognition of other antigens may differ between the 
anti-human  and  anti-murine  CD19  CAR  T  cells  due  to  the  different  scFvs  that  were  used  in  the  CD19  CAR 
constructs. Similarly, the use of KTE-X19 in immunocompromised mice would also not be expected to reliably 
predict off-target effects, since potential differences of cross-recognition of unrelated antigens, differences of 
antigen expression patterns, and differences in the in vivo survival, activation and expansion of KTE-X19 are 
expected to hamper detection of potential off-target effects in such a model. 
In addition to these potential toxicities of the CD19 CAR T cells that are either dependent on the expression 
pattern of the chosen target antigen (on-target/off-tumour toxicities) or on the cross-reactivity of the chosen 
ScFv with other non-target antigens (off-target toxicities), there are also expected risks that are associated with 
the general mode of action of CAR T cells, such as uncontrolled T cell proliferation, tumour lysis syndrome (TRS), 
cytokine  release  syndrome  (CRS),  neurotoxicity,  and  macrophage  activation  syndrome  (MAS).  These  toxic 
effects have also not been investigated in non-clinical studies which is fully acceptable considering that these 
effects are general effects of CAR T cells and that the extent of these expected toxicities are largely based on 
patient-specific parameters such as the individual tumour load.

The combination of both the use of a γ-retroviral vector with full-length viral long terminal repeats (LTRs) and 
the high proliferative potential of the transduced T cells provides a certain risk of insertional oncogenesis, which 
has not been addressed beyond the analysis of VIS in CAR T cells at the end of the manufacturing process. The 
lack of additional data on insertional oncogenesis has been sufficiently justified by the applicant. The applicants’ 
line of argumentation involves the following key arguments: 1) an exceptional high resistance of mature mouse 
T  cells  against  transformation  induced  by  genomic  integration  of  γ-retroviral  vectors  as  reported  in  the 
literature; and 2) lack of reported cases of insertional oncogenesis in the clinical evaluation of KTE-X19 itself, 
axicabtagene ciloleucel, or T cells that were transduced with γ-retroviral vectors encoding other transgenes. 
Thereby,  clinical  experience  with  study  participants  that  were  treated  with  γ-retrovirally  transduced  T  cells 
engineered  to  express  either  a  T  cell  receptor  (TCR)  or  a  CAR  included  up  to  11  years  of  follow-up.  Taken 
together,  the  experience  so  far  with  mouse  and  human  T  cells  suggests  that  T  cell  transformation  due  to 
genomic integration of γ-retroviral vectors is a very rare event which cannot be completely ruled out, but may 
be expected to occur at a particularly low frequency.  
The non-clinical VIS data revealed the expected vector integration pattern of γ-retroviral vectors, which are 
known to preferentially integrate within close proximity of TSS and near transcriptionally active genes due to the 
open  chromatin  structure.  In  contrast,  integration  of  the  γ-retroviral  vector  into  exons  is  relatively  rare.  In 
addition,  the  applicant  concluded  that  no  signs  of  predominance  of  single  VIS  have  been  observed.  This 
conclusion has been supported by re-evaluation of the data using an improved bioinformatics analysis method.  
The  lack  of  non-clinical  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies  is  acceptable  based  on  the  type  of 
product,  the  expression  pattern  of  the  target  antigen  and  the  lack  of  a  relevant  animal  model.  The  risk  of 
inadvertent  germline  transmission  of  the  CD19  CAR  construct  has  not  been  addressed  by  the  applicant. 
However, the Guideline on non-clinical testing for inadvertent germline transmission of gene transfer vectors, 
EMEA/273974/2005  indicates  that  the  risk  of  germline  transmission  associated  with  the  administration  of 
genetically modified human cells is considered to be low and, as animal testing of human cells may be difficult 
or  not  meaningful,  non-clinical  germline  transmission  studies  of  human  genetically  modified  cells  are  not 
recommended.  
The SmPC appropriately indicates the lack of non-clinical toxicology studies, carcinogenicity and genotoxicity 
studies, and reproductive and developmental toxicity studies (see Section 5.3. of the SmPC). 
Ecotoxicology/environmental risk assessment 
The risk of RCR formation during manufacturing is considered negligible due to the absence of the majority of 
the parental retroviral sequence in the vector and the necessity of several independent recombination events for 
the generation of a functional RCR. In addition, the applicant confirmed the lack of RCR in the vector harvest 
using a suitable test method with an acceptable sensitivity. Finally, the applicant provided data on RCR testing 
from samples of patients treated with KTE-X19 in order to demonstrate that no RCR has been detected in treated 
patients. Thus, the likelihood that RCR is administered to study participants and released into the environment 
or transmitted to third parties is considered negligible.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A limited non-clinical development package was provided for KTE-X19. However, the type of product and the 
limitations  of  available  animal  models  for  investigating  pharmacodynamics,  pharmacokinetics  and  safety  of 
KTE-X19 do not allow meaningful non-clinical investigation of many of the aspects that are usually required for 
a GTMP. Therefore, the presented non-clinical in vitro and in vivo data demonstrating CD19 CAR expression on 
transduced T cells, specific activation of CD19 CAR T cells, in vivo anti-lymphoma activity and persistence of the 
surrogate CD19 CAR T cells, B cell aplasia as an expected on-target/off-tumour effect, and the integration sites 
analysis of the retroviral vector conducted at the end of the manufacturing process of the CD19 CAR T cells, can 
be considered sufficient for marketing approval of KTE-X19. 
The product is considered as approvable from a non-clinical point of view. Moreover, the risk for the environment 
and human health is regarded as negligible.  
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusions on the non clinical aspects as described above. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the Community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
A routine GCP inspection was conducted for the clinical trial: A Phase 2 Multicenter Study Evaluating the Efficacy 
of  KTE-X19  in  Subjects  with  Relapsed/  Refractory  Mantle  Cell  Lymphoma  (ZUMA-2).  The  purpose  of  the 
inspection was to evaluate compliance with GCP and applicable regulations, in particular where it has impact on 
the validity of the data or the ethical conduct of the trial. 
The original inspection request included the sponsor and an investigator site in the US. The planned inspections 
on site in the US were cancelled due to travel restrictions caused by Covid-19 pandemic. The sponsor inspection 
was conducted remotely and as a follow-up to the findings at sponsor, a CRO inspection was included in the 
procedure. The CRO inspection was conducted on site in Germany and partly remotely. 
Despite the findings observed by the inspection team, overall the trial was conducted ethically and the level of 
compliance with GCP was sufficient to conclude that the data are of acceptable quality. 
It is the general conclusion of the inspectors that the data reported in the CSR submitted to the agency are 
reliable and can be used for the assessment of the MAA.

Results 
The following graphical comparison demonstrates parallels and differences in the curve characteristics of Cohort 
1 and Cohort 2.  
Anti-CD19 CAR T cells were measurable in peripheral blood within the first 7 days after the KTE-X19 infusion in 
all evaluable subjects in both study cohorts. For subjects in Cohort 1, median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels 
were 88.64 cells/µL (range: 0.16 to 2589 cells/μL), with median time to peak levels of 15 days. The median 
AUC0-28  was  1136  cells/μL•days  (range:  1.81  to  2.77  x  104  cells/μL•days).  Anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  levels 
decreased  to  near  baseline  but  still  detectable  levels  at  Month  3  after  the  infusion  in  most  subjects  with 
evaluable samples. Anti-CD19 CAR T cells were still detectable at 24 months in 6 of 10 subjects with evaluable 
samples at the time of the data cut-off. For subjects in Cohort 2, peak and total exposure was approximately 
60% that of subjects treated in Cohort 1, and had decreased to undetectable levels in 4 of 5 subjects by 15 
months.

Abbreviations: AUC0-28, area-under-the-curve from Day 0 to Day 28; CAR, chimeric antigen receptor; LLOQ, lower limit of quantification; Max, 
maximum; Min, minimum; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; Q, quartile; StD, standard deviation.  
Notes: All data have units of cells/μL except AUC0-28 is cells/μL•days and time to peak is measured in days. Peak is defined as the maximum 
number of CAR T cells measured after infusion. Time to peak is defined as the number of days from KTE-X19 infusion to the date when the CAR 
T cells in blood first reached the maximum postbaseline level. AUC0-28 is defined as the area-under-the-curve in a plot of number of CAR T cells 
against scheduled visit from Day 0 to Day 28. Due to the timing of samples collected immediately after infusion (Day 7, Day 14, and Day 28), 
the calculated values for peak, AUC0-28, and time to peak are considered estimates.  
a The number of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in blood (per µL) was calculated as (1,000 x white blood cell count/μL) x ([% monocyte + % lymphocyte 
count]/100) x (qPPB/100), where qPPB is the percentage of PMBCs that express the anti-CD19 CAR.  
b At some time points, subject numbers were lower than the total number of subjects; reasons include sampling error, low PBMC count, or PBMC 
count below the LLOQ. Complete blood counts were used to normalise data presented in cells/µL.  
Effect of Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors 
The  influence  of  intrinsic  and  extrinsic  factors  has  been  assessed  in  an  explorative  manner.  For  cohort  1  a 
number  of  subgroup  analysis  where  performed.  These  were  not  designed  to  test  for  differences  between 
subgroups and should be considered descriptive only.  
PK  by  Age:  39  subjects  were  ≥  65  years  of  age,  and  29  subjects  were  <  65  years  of  age.  A  conspicuous 
difference is the median peak anti-CD19 CAR T level between the two age groups of< 65 years and ≥65 years 
as presented in the following table:

PK by Sex: Fifty-seven subjects were male, and 11 subjects were female. No major trends toward differences in 
Median  peak  anti-CD19  CAR  T  or  Median  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  AUC0-28  values  were  observed.  However, 
median anti-CD19 CAR T cell values were about 20% higher in female subjects.  
PK by Race: the predominantly white patient population (62 out of 68) precluded comparisons across race. 
PK according to Baseline Tumour Burden 
Tumour burden was measured per the revised guidelines from the International Working Group (IWG) Response 
Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2014) and as the sum of the cross-products of target lesions. The 
association of anti-CD19 CAR T-cell expansion with baseline tumour burden was assessed according to quartiles 
of tumour burden. Median anti-CD19 CAR T-cell peak values were 42.18 cells/μL in the first (lowest) tumour 
burden quartile, 135.82 cells/μL in the second quartile, 133.00 cells/μL in the third quartile, and 48.11 cells/μL 
in the fourth (highest) quartile. Were 458.99 cells/μL•days in the first quartile, 1486.96 cells/μL•days in the 
second quartile, 2168.29 cells/μL•days in the third quartile, and 566.27 cells/μL•days in the fourth quartile. 
Thus, a trend towards lower anti-CD19 CAR T-cell exposure for subjects with baseline tumour burden in the 
highest quartile. 
Pharmacokinetics by MCL Morphologic Characteristics 
Seventeen subjects in Cohort 1 and 6 subjects in Cohort 2 (28% overall) had blastoid variant of MCL, which is 
an aggressive subtype of MCL that may predict poorer prognosis than classical morphology MCL. Subjects with 
blastoid  variant  MCL  showed  reduced  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  expansion  and  overall  exposure  compared  with 
subjects with classical MCL morphology (2- to 3-fold differences between median values) 
Exploratory Analyses 
Correlative analyses of potential association of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics parameters with key 
safety  and  efficacy  endpoints  were  performed  for  Cohort  1.  For  the  correlative  analyses  described  below, 
possible  associations  were  identified  by  p  values  of  0.05  or  lower  obtained  from  either  Wilcoxon  rank-sum 
(pairwise comparisons) or Kruskal- Wallis tests (across 3 groups). Multiplicity adjustment was not performed, 
and p values do not indicate statistical significance, but rather a possible trend in association between individual 
serum analytes or CAR T-cell levels and CAR-related toxicity.

Anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels in blood (peak and AUC0-28) were examined according to the severity of key safety 
outcomes  (incidence  of  Grade  3  or  higher  versus  Grade  2,  Grade  1,  or  no  CRS  or  neurologic  events)  Data 
collected on Day 7 and Day 14 were used to determine association of pharmacokinetic parameters with AEs. 
Peak blood levels of anti-CD19 CAR T cells were higher for subjects with higher grades of CRS. The median peak 
level  of  anti-CD19  CAR  T  cells  was  4.8-fold  higher  for  subjects  with  Grade  3  or  higher  CRS  compared  with 
subjects with Grade 2, Grade 1, or no CRS (273.72 versus 57.07 cells/μL). Median AUC0-28 was 7.77-fold higher 
in subjects with Grade 3 or higher CRS than in subjects with Grade 2, Grade 1, or no CRS (4664.32 versus 
600.59 cells/μL•days).  
The median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level in blood was 8.27-fold higher in subjects with Grade 3 or higher 
neurologic events relative to the median peak level in subjects with Grade 2, Grade 1, or no neurologic events 
(361.50 versus 43.71 cells/µL). Similarly, the median AUC0-28 was 9.46-fold higher in subjects with Grade 3 or 
higher  neurologic  events  than  in  subjects  with  Grade  2,  Grade  1,  or  no  neurologic  events  (4664.32  versus 
493.16 cells/μL•days). Summarizing, higher anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels (peak and AUC0-28) were associated 
with Grade 3 or higher CRS and Grade 3 or higher neurologic events. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
For evaluation of pharmacodynamics, subjects’ serum samples were collected according to the ZUMA-2 clinical 
protocol  schedule  of  assessments  and  per  institutional  guidelines  at  baseline  (prior  to  conditioning 
chemotherapy), on Day 0 (after conditioning chemotherapy and prior to KTE-X19 infusion), and on Days 3, 7, 
14, and 28 after the KTE-X19 infusion. Additional unscheduled samples were collected if a subject had prolonged 
treatment-related toxicity or was re-admitted to the hospital with any KTE-X19-related adverse event and at the 
time of disease progression (optional). In addition, Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) was obtained from subjects who 
experienced Grade 2 or higher neurologic events after KTE-X19 infusion and from subjects who consented to 
optional lumbar punctures at baseline (prior to KTE-X19 infusion) and Day 5 (± 3 days) after KTE-X19 infusion. 
However, Cerebrospinal Fluid analyses were exploratory and descriptive in nature and the methods used were 
not qualified for CSF. 
A total of 40 analytes has been evaluated on blood and tumour samples with 17 key analytes, which comprised 
pro-inflammatory  and  immune-modulating  cytokines,  chemokines,  and  effector  molecules.  The  analysis  of 
primary biomarkers is performed on blood and tumour samples to evaluate predictive and pharmacodynamic 
markers  for  anti-CD19  CAR  T  cells.  Prognostic  markers  specific  for  MCL  and  related  to  the tumour  immune 
environment are evaluated in archived and fresh tumour biopsies (at baseline, on Day 7, and at Month 6 for 
subjects who sign the optional consent form). 
The following 17 analytes were considered key analytes:  
•  Homeostatic/proliferative: interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, and IL-15 
• 
Inflammatory/immune  modulating:  C-reactive  protein  (CRP),  interferon-gamma  (IFN-γ),  IL-1  receptor 
antagonist (IL-1RA), IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2Rα), IL-6, IL-10, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) 
•  Chemokine: C-X-C motif chemokine (CXCL)10, and IL-8 
• 
•  Other  analytes:  ferritin,  intercellular  adhesion  molecule-1  (ICAM-1),  vascular  cell  adhesion  molecule-1 
Immune effector: granzyme B and perforin 
(VCAM-1) 
Key observations 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 47/131 
 
  
  
 
After infusion of KTE-X19, the serum levels of the key analytes remained steady at baseline  levels (TNF-α and 
VCAM-1)  or  were  elevated  relative  to  baseline  (CXCL10,  ferritin,  granzyme  B,  ICAM-1,  IFN-γ,  IL-1RA,  IL-2, 
IL-2Rα, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and perforin). CRP levels generally decreased to baseline or below baseline at Week 4. 
Three of 65 subjects (4.6%) still demonstrated a 2-fold or higher change in the level of CRP over baseline at that 
time.  The  median  time  to  peak  for  all  key  analytes  was  within  8  days  after  infusion  of  KTE-X19  (range  of 
medians: 4 to 8 days), preceding the peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell expansion at 14 days; the median time to peak 
for perforin was 22 days. The majority of analytes increased by 2-fold or more at peak in ≥ 50% of subjects 
(exceptions: ICAM-1, perforin, TNF-α, and VCAM-1). 
Association of Pharmacodynamic Parameters with CRS or Neurologic Events 
Of the 17 key analytes, the median peak serum levels for the following were nominally higher (nominal Wilcoxon 
rank-sum p value ≤ 0.05) among subjects who experienced Grade 3 or higher CRS versus Grade 2, Grade 1, or 
no CRS after infusion of KTE-X19: ferritin, granzyme B, IL-2Rα, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, perforin, and TNF-α.  
The 3 analytes with the lowest p values (highest statistical signal) for peak serum levels with Grade 3 or higher 
CRS compared with Grade 2, Grade 1, or no CRS were IL-10, granzyme B and IL-2RA.The 3 analytes with the 
greatest fold change by grade of CRS were IL-6 (12.7-fold), IL-10 (6.3-fold), and TNF-α (5.7-fold). 
With the exception of perforin (median estimated time to peak of 22 days) , the median estimated time to 
peak  for  all  key  analytes  was  within  8  days  after  infusion  of  KTE-X19  (range  of  medians:  4  to  8  days), 
preceding the peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell expansion at 14 days. The majority of the analytes increased by 
2-fold or more at peak in ≥ 50% of subjects (exceptions: ICAM-1, perforin, TNF-α, and VCAM-1). By Week 4 
after KTE-X19 infusion, the majority of the 17 key serum analytes had returned to near-baseline levels; ie, 6 
analytes remained elevated by 2-fold or more in ≥ 20% of subjects (CXCL10, ferritin, IFN-γ, IL 6, IL-8, and 
IL-15).  The  monocyte  chemokine  protein  1  (MCP-1)  as  an  important  chemokine  for  cerebral  immune 
response and cerebral inflammation has been evaluated in the course of the trial. However, the observation 
of MCP-1 peak levels at upper limit of quantification at both high and low grade neurologic events suggest the 
use of a not quite adequate assay. Therefore, unfortunately, the results cannot be regarded representative.  
Additionally, of the 40 analytes measured, 3 cytokines with the highest increases in peak and total exposure 
in  subjects  with  Grade  3  or  higher  CRS  were  granzyme  A,  GM-CSF  and  macrophage  inflammatory 
protein-1alpha.  
The results on upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the ZUMA 2 trial with higher grades of CRS can be 
regarded in line with literature data on other anti-CD19 CAR T cells. This also applies to the observation that by 
Week 4 after KTE-X19 infusion, the majority of the 17 key serum analytes had returned to near-baseline levels; 
i.e., six analytes remained elevated by 2-fold or more in ≥ 20% of subjects (CXCL10, ferritin, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-8, 
and IL-15).  
Association of B-cell levels with Pharmacokinetic parameters and disease response.  
B-cell levels were calculated as a percentage of viable leukocytes, representing the number of CD19+, CD20+, 
or CD19+CD20+ B cells relative to total viable CD45+ immune cells in a flow cytometry assay. It should be 
noted  that  the  flow  cytometry  assay  used  did  not  discriminate  between  circulating  normal  and  cancerous 
CD19+CD20+  B  cells.  At  baseline,  after  conditioning  therapy  but  prior  CAR  T-cell  infusion,  median 
CD19+/CD20+  B-cell  levels  were  8.7%  of  viable  CD45+  leukocytes  (range:  0.024%  to  95.237%).  After 
KTE-X19 infusion, the first measurement of B-cells was at Month 3, the second by Month 18. By Month 3, the 
median B-cell levels declined to 0.1% (range: 0.017% to 96.147%), and by Month 18, median B-cell levels 
demonstrated recovery (median: 10.6%). Subjects in ongoing response and subjects whose MCL had relapsed 
had  numerically  lower  levels  of  B  cells  compared  with  non-responders  (10.6%  and  7.1%  versus  35.7%, 
respectively). In subjects with ongoing response, B cells seem to have recovered.

Association of Product Characteristics with KTE-X19 Pharmacokinetics 
Associations  between  a  number  of  key  product-related  characteristics  and  peak  post-infusion  levels  of 
anti-CD19  CAR  T  cells  were  explored.  These  analyses  are  only  exploratory  in  nature.  They  included: 
transduction rate (%), IFN-γ (pg/mL), CD4:CD8 ratio, T cell phenotype, total number of T cells infused (x 106), 
CCR7+ (Tnaïve  + Tcm), %, total number of CCR7+ T cells infused (x 106), CCR7-  (Tem + Teff), %,  and vector copy 
number (copies per cell). 
IFN-γ in co-culture, and CD4:CD8 ratio showed potential associations (p ≤ 0.05) with post-infusion levels of 
anti-CD19 CAR T cells. Although a potential association was seen with IFN-γ in co-culture and CD4:CD8 ratio 
with  KTE-X19  pharmacokinetics,  these  associations  were  not  monotonic;  ie,  no  apparent  trend  existed  in  a 
quartile analyses of product characteristic with Grade 3 or higher neurologic events, Grade 3 or higher CRS, or 
objective response. 
No association was identified (based on nominal p values > 0.05) between other observed characteristics and 
post-infusion levels of anti-CD19 CAR T cells. 
Mechanism of action 
Tecartus, a CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapy, binds to CD19 expressing 
cancer cells and normal B cells. Following anti-CD19 CAR T-cell engagement with CD19 expressing target cells, 
the CD28 co-stimulatory domain and CD3-zeta signalling domain activate downstream signalling cascades that 
lead to T-cell activation, proliferation, acquisition of effector functions and secretion of inflammatory cytokines 
and chemokines. This sequence of events leads to killing of CD19-expressing cells. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics and response rate  
For subjects treated with the KTE-X19 in Cohort 1 at the target dose of 2 x 106 CAR T cells/kg, robust CAR T 
expansion was observed with a median time to peak levels of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in blood of 15 days after 
KTE-X19 infusion. Anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels decreased to near background levels by Month 3 although still 
detectable by qPCR at Month 24 in 6 of 10 subjects (60%) with evaluable samples.  
Median exposure level for subjects in Cohort 2 was approximately 60% of the median exposure in subjects in 
Cohort 1. The range of individual times to peak for subjects in Cohort 2 compared with subjects in Cohort 1 
was  slower,  the  overall  expansion  less  robust,  and  the  relative  percentage  of  subjects  with  detectable 
anti-CD19 CAR T cells at 12 and 15 months was lower. The results suggest that the higher dose in Cohort 1 
leads to greater anti-CD19 CAR T-cell persistence.  
Given the known MoA of CAR-T cells, as well as the correlative analyses indicating that anti-CD19 CAR T-cell 
peak and AUC0-28 were associated with objective response (CR or PR), the rationale for not selecting the 
lower 0.5 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg as the dose carried forward might be supported. With respect to 
ORR, DOR and PFS, however, there were no differences observed between the two dose cohorts, although 
the limited number of subjects in cohort 2 hampers a meaningful comparison.  
ZUMA-2 pharmacokinetics parameters demonstrated a positive association with disease response as well as 
toxicity, including higher grades of neurologic events and CRS. The median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level in 
responders was more than 100-fold higher than the corresponding level in non-responders, 97.52 versus 0.39 
CHMP assessment report

cells/μL (p = 0.0020), respectively. This is consistent with earlier observations from other CD19 directed CAR T 
cell therapies. 
With regards to pharmacokinetics in specific populations and subgroups of interest the following observation 
were made. Answers on arising concerns have been provided, which are considered acceptable in view of a 
granted conditional approval and obligations on post-authorisation measurements: 
-  Median anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels (peak and AUC0-28) were markedly higher in subjects younger 
than 65 years of age in comparison with subjects aged 65 years or older. It is not clear to which 
degree  the  observed  difference  may  be  influenced  by  CAR-T  quality  attributes,  by  differences 
related to in clinical presentation or other unknown factors. Considerations on an age-dependent 
quality of the CAR T cells are contrasted by the results of the subgroup analyses on ORR, which 
revealed no clear differences between both age cohorts. In order to achieve a better understanding 
for age specific interactions of pharmacology and clinical outcome additional subgroup analyses are 
considered to be provided in the studies adopted as specific obligation for the conditional Marketing 
authorisation.  
-  No differences with regard to race were observed for Anti-CD19 CAR T-cell expansion.  
-  Higher values of Cmax and AUC-values for anti-CD19 CAR T cells were associated with tocilicumab 
and/or steroids administered for the management of CRS or ICANS, an observation that is not 
surprising. CAR T cells are the presumed cause for higher levels of CRS and neurologic events 
subsequently treated with immunosuppressive drugs.   
-  While no simple monotonic association with anti-CD19 CAR T-cell expansion and base line tumour 
burden was observed, there still seems to be a trend towards less anti-CD19 CAR T-cell expansion 
in  subjects  with  the  highest  baseline tumour  burden.  Median  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  peak  values 
reported were 133 cells/μL for subjects in the third quartile, but dropped down to 48 cells/μL for 
subjects  in  the  fourth  quartile,  with  corresponding  AUC0-28,  median  values  being  2168 
cells/μL•days  in  the  third  quartile,  vs  566  cells/μL•days  in  the  fourth  quartile.  While  subgroup 
analysis revealed no difference in ORR rates in subject ≥ median base line tumour burden vs subject 
< median base line tumour burden, it is noted that for the subgroup analysis of ongoing response 
rates (Cohort 1, Inferential analysis set), a trend towards lower response rates for subject ≥ median 
base line tumour burden was observed. Data on the ongoing response rates according to tumour 
burden broken down into quartiles have been provided and clearly show that while subjects with 
high tumour burden had similar ORR as compared to subjects with lower tumour burden, CR rates 
where  lower  and  fewer  subjects  experienced  durable  long-term  responses.  Discussion  on  the 
underlying mechanisms for inferior T-cell expansion in subjects with the highest tumour burden, 
citing  relevant  literature,  has  been  provided  indicating  that  recent  data  from  subjects  with 
relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel also demonstrate 
that  subjects  with  high  tumour  volume  have  worse  outcomes  (Dean  2020,  Locke  2018).  The 
mechanisms underlying these observations are not fully elucidated but may include insufficient CAR 
T-cell expansion relative to the tumour burden, owing to possible detrimental impact of the tumour 
microenvironment in large tumour lesions (Rossi 2019). Whether limitation with regards to efficacy 
could be overcome by adjusting CAR-T dose in subjects with higher tumour burden has not been 
discussed. 
- 
Pharmacokinetics analysis by MCL morphologic characteristics showed that subjects with blastoid 
variant  MCL  had  reduced  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  expansion  and  overall  exposure  compared  with 
subjects  with  classical  MCL  morphology  (2-  to  3-fold  differences  between  median  values). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 50/131 
 
  
  
Interestingly, no correlation with lower ORR or DOR were observed for subjects with blastoid variant 
MCL. However, subjects with diffuse MCL morphology had even more reduced anti anti-CD19 CAR 
T-cell  expansion  and  overall  exposure.  For  these  subjects,  subgroup  analysis  indicated  a  trend 
towards lower ORR and DOR. 
Bioanalysis  of  17  key  serum  biomarkers  measured  prior  to  and  after  KTE-X19  treatment  showed  trends 
consistent with the known mechanism of action of anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy (including lymphodepletion) 
and associations with neurologic events and CRS. Homeostatic cytokines CRP, ferritin, IL-7, and IL-15 increased 
after  conditioning  chemotherapy  treatment,  and  were  elevated  at  Day  0.  At  peak,  the  majority  of  analytes 
increased by 2-fold or more in ≥ 50% of subjects. Most analytes returned to near baseline by Week 4. Overall, 
these results were consistent with previously reported results observed with anti-CD19 CAR T-cell treatment of 
NHL. Exploratory analysis of the same biomarkers in CSF found pro-inflammatory cytokines CRP, CXCL-10, and 
IL-6 to be elevated at peak by 5-fold or more in comparison with baseline median. 
In an exploratory analysis conducted to evaluate the association of pre-infusion product characteristics with 
anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  expansion  only  2  pre-infusion  product  characteristics  were  shown  to  have  a  positive 
association with post-infusion levels of anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels: IFN-γ in co-culture and CD4:CD8 ratio. The 
association,  however,  was  not  monotonic  and  the  relevance  of  these  findings  is  unknown,  since  association 
between these product attributes and clinical outcomes was not observed. Moreover, a relevance of biomarkers 
such as IFN-gamma or IL-15 or macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha for prognostic purpose on treatment 
outcome was not established. 
Analysis of association of B-cell levels with pharmacokinetic parameters and disease response showed that at 
month 3, median B-cell levels declined to 0.1% (range: 0.017% to 96.147%). Subjects in ongoing response who 
had B-cell aplasia had numerically higher median CAR T-cell levels than subjects in ongoing response who had 
detectable  B-cells.  However,  ongoing  B-cell  depletion  was  not  required  for  maintaining  disease  response  to 
month 24, since B cells had recovered by Month 24 in subjects in ongoing response. There is still substantial 
uncertainty  with  regards  to  B-cell  aplasia  as  a  marker  for  durable  responses  in  subjects  treated  with  CD19 
directed CAR T cells. Results for KTE-X19 are in line with results obtained with other CAR T products, for which 
a number of patients are in long-term remission with B-Cell recovery. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data for KTE-X19 are based on 1 clinical study and comparison 
and analyses of results across studies is not applicable. ZUMA-2 was not designed to test for differences between 
subgroups and formal comparisons were not pre-specified. The results of the subgroup analyses are descriptive 
only. The influence of intrinsic and extrinsic factors has been assessed in an explorative manner. No population 
analysis has been performed due to the sparse PK data base available.  
Assessments for clinical pharmacology in the ZUMA 2 trial were based on the known mechanism of action of 
anti-CD19 CAR T cell and the current knowledge of the safety profile of the conditioning chemotherapy and 
anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  infusion.  Conventional  studies  on  pharmacokinetics  including  absorption,  distribution, 
metabolism and excretion of KTE-X19 are not applicable. The clinical benefit of KTE-X19, i.e. a complete or 
partial response after treatment with KTE-X19 is supported by the results of pharmacology data.  However, a 
conclusion on a possible correlation of cell persistence and long-term efficacy outcomes is not possible due to the 
limited  data  available.  With  respect  to  pharmacodynamics,  there  is  currently  no  evidence  of  a  positive 
correlation between certain biomarkers and a positive treatment outcome.

Although  extrapolation  of  data  on  pharmacology  of  KTE-C19  to  KTE-X19  is  somehow  acceptable,  there  are 
remaining uncertainties concerning differences in gender and age in the ZUMA-2 population particularly due to 
the lack of results on population PK and PD. Given the general low number of treated patients in the ZUMA-2 
trial, the unequal distribution gender and the very rough age classification (<65 years old and ≥65 years old), 
the following incomprehensibilities require detailed analyses:  
-  Medium peak of anti-CD19 CAR T cell value: 112.45 cells/γL (<65 years old) and 74.08 cells/γL (≥65 
years old  
-  Median anti-CD19 CAR T-cell AUC0-28 value: 876.48 cells/μL•days in subjects ≥ 65 years of age and 
1640.21 cells/μL•days in subjects < 65 years of age  
This is particularly noteworthy since both median peak of anti-CD19 CAR T levels and AUC0-28 were associated 
with better results on objective response. 
The issue was partially addressed by the applicant and it will be further followed post marketing in the studies 
proposed as specific obligation in the frame of the adopted Conditional marketing authorisation.  
The CHMP endorse the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the Clinical pharmacology as described 
above. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The primary data for this marketing application are from one ongoing, uncontrolled, open label multi-centre 
Phase 2 clinical study, KTE-C19-102 (ZUMA-2), (Table  5), evaluating safety and efficacy of KTE-X19 at 33 sites 
in the United States, France, Germany and the Netherlands. The remaining ongoing studies listed in Table 5 
provide clinical experience of KTE-X19 in the context of other indications.

a In ZUMA-2 and ZUMA-8, subjects received conditioning chemotherapy consisting of both cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/day 
and fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day for 3 days. In ZUMA-3 and ZUMA-4, subjects received conditioning chemotherapy consisting 
of cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m2/day for 1 day and fludarabine 25 mg/m2/day for 3 days. 
b ZUMA-2 had completed enrolment as of the data cut-off date for results reported in this application, 24 July 2019. For studies 
ZUMA-3, ZUMA-4 and ZUMA-8, the number of subjects enrolled represent enrolment as of the data cut-off date for results 
reported in this application, 26 June 2019. 
c In ZUMA-2, 10 subjects were treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel. Results from these 10 subjects were reported separately 
and are not included in this application. 
d 3 subjects in ZUMA-2 and 4 subjects in ZUMA-3 were enrolled for retreatment with KTE-X19. 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Dose-response studies have not been performed. The proposed dose (2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg, Cohort 
1), is based on results obtained with axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta) in subjects with refractory aggressive 
large  B-cell  lymphoma  (ZUMA-1),  a  different  CAR  T  cell  product,  and  by  peak  expansion  and  cumulative 
exposure data for KTE-X19 in the Zuma 2 trial.  
Cohort 2 explored the safety and efficacy of a 4-fold lower dose (0.5 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg). This cohort 
was opened following an interim analysis of 28 patients in Cohort 1, demonstrating 3- to 5-fold higher peak 
expansion and cumulative exposure values of anti-CD19 CAR T cells relative to that observed in ZUMA-1. The 
cohort was subsequently closed following a preliminary analysis revealing that anti-CD19 CAR T-cell expansion 
in these subjects was less robust than anticipated. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 53/131 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Based on this, the KTE-X19 dose of 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg used in Cohort 1 was deemed the optimal 
dose for treatment of MCL. Cohort 1 was re-opened, and additional subjects were enrolled and treated at the 
dose of 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg 
2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
The applicant submitted data on the key trial ZUMA-2 trial and on the historical control, which is regarded as 
supportive. ZUMA-2 is an ongoing (but not recruiting), uncontrolled, Phase 2, multicentre, open-label clinical 
study evaluating the safety and efficacy of KTE-X19 in subjects with r/r MCL whose disease had relapsed or 
progressed on anthracycline- or bendamustine-containing chemotherapy, an anti-CD20 antibody, and a BTK 
inhibitor (ibrutinib and/or acalabrutinib). The study involved two dose cohorts (see dose response section). Only 
data from Cohort 1 is considered pivotal for the MAA.  
Data from Cohort 2 are descriptive only, and do not contribute to the primary efficacy analysis. 
Title of Study 
A Phase 2 Multicenter Study Evaluating the Efficacy of KTE-X19 in Subjects with Relapsed/Refractory Mantle Cell 
Lymphoma (ZUMA-2) 
Methods and Study Participants  
ZUMA-2 is evaluating the safety and efficacy of KTE-X19 in subjects with r/r MCL whose disease had progressed 
on  anthracycline-  or  bendamustine-containing  chemotherapy,  anti-CD20  antibody,  and  a  Bruton’s  tyrosine 
kinase (BTK) inhibitor (ibrutinib and/or acalabrutinib). Data cut-off date of the primary analysis was the 24 July 
2019. ZUMA-2 was carried out at 33 sites in the United States, France, Germany and the Netherlands. 
Up to approximately 130 subjects are to be enrolled into two dose cohorts. Cohort 1, the pivotal cohort, is to 
treat approximately 80 subjects with a target dose of 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg. The first 60 subjects in 
Cohort 1 who were treated with KTE-X19 were to form the basis for statistical hypothesis testing of the primary 
endpoint. Cohort 2 is to treat up to 40 subjects with KTE-X19 at a target dose of 0.5 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T 
cells/kg. Data from Cohort 2 are descriptive only. 
Each  subject  in  both  cohorts  was  to  proceed  through  the  following  study  periods:  Screening, 
enrollment/leukapheresis, bridging therapy (if applicable), conditioning chemotherapy, investigational product 
treatment and post-treatment assessment.

Treatments 
The treatments received during the study are shown in figure 6. Subjects were considered to be enrolled when 
they commenced leukapheresis to obtain leukocytes for the manufacturing of KTE-X19. Screening PET-CT scans 
were to be completed as close to enrolment as possible.  
Figure 6. Study Scheme for ZUMA-2 (KTE-C19-102) 
Leukapheresis: 
Subjects were to avoid corticosteroid therapy at a pharmacologic dose (≥ 5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent 
doses  of  other  corticosteroids)  and  other  immunosuppressive  drugs  for  7  days  prior  to  leukapheresis.  If 
leukapheresis was delayed beyond 5 days, baseline complete blood count with differential and chemistry panel 
was to be repeated to reconfirm the subject’s eligibility. 
Bridging Therapy 
Bridging therapy could be administered at the discretion of the investigator after leukapheresis at any subject 
with high disease burden at screening and had to be completed at least 5 days prior to initiation of conditioning 
therapy. According to the trial protocol, allowed drugs were dexamethasone PO or IV, ibrutinib or acalabrutinib. 
If bridging therapy was administered, PET-CT scans and bone marrow aspirate/biopsy, if applicable, had to be 
repeated prior to the start of conditioning therapy in order to establish a new baseline.  
Conditioning Chemotherapy (Day –5 to day –3): 
• Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 IV over approximately 60 minutes, followed by 
• Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV over approximately 30 minutes, followed by 
• 1 L of 0.9% NaCl at the completion of the cyclophosphamide infusion, addition of 
• Mesna per institutional guidelines (administered according institutional guidelines and package insert to inhibit 
cyclophosphamide induced haemorrhagic cystitis) 
69 subjects (of 68 treated with KTE-X19) in Cohort 1 and 15 subjects (of 14 treated with KTE-X19) in Cohort 2 
received conditioning therapy.

KTE-X19 administration (Day 0): 
Subjects in the pivotal Cohort 1 received a single IV infusion of CAR transduced autologous T cells administered 
at a target dose of 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg, and 68 patients have been treated with KTE-X19 in this 
dosage.  
Subjects  in  Cohort  2  received  a  single  IV  infusion  of  CAR-transduced  autologous  T  cells  administered 
intravenously at a target dose of 0.5 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg, and 14 subjects received KTE-X19 in this 
dosage.

Sample size 
Up to approximately 130 subjects with r/r MCL were to be enrolled and treated in 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 was to 
include at least 60, and up to approximately 80, subjects who received KTE-X19 at a dose of 2 x 106 anti-CD19 
CAR T cells/kg (an additional 10 subjects were treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel). Cohort 2 was to include up 
to approximately 40 subjects who received KTE-X19 at a dose of 0.5 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg. 
The primary analysis was to be conducted after 60 subjects in Cohort 1 were treated with KTE-X19 and had the 
opportunity to be assessed for response 6 months after the Week 4 disease assessment. A sample size of 60 
subjects in Cohort 1 had at least 96% power to distinguish between an active therapy with a true response rate 
of 50% or higher from a therapy with an ORR of 25% or less, with a 1-sided alpha level of 0.025. 
Analysis population sets 
For statistical evaluations, the trial population has been assorted as follows: 
- 
Inferential analysis set: The first 60 subjects in Cohort 1 who were treated with KTE-X19 and who had 
had the opportunity to be evaluated for response 6 months after the Week 4 disease assessment. This 
analysis  set  was  used  for  efficacy  analyses  in  Cohort  1  and  the  hypothesis  testing  of  the  primary 
endpoint ORR at the time of the primary analysis. 
− 
Full analysis set: All subjects who were enrolled in Cohort 1. This analysis set was used for the summary 
of subject disposition, as well as for analyses of ORR and other key efficacy endpoints (best objective 
response, DOR, PFS, and OS). 
−  Safety  analysis  set  (=modified  intent-to-treat  analysis  set):  All  subjects  who  received  any  dose  of 
KTE-X19 
−  Subgroup analysis sets: subgroup analyses of selected efficacy and safety endpoints were performed in 
subgroups defined by baseline covariates, use of concomitant tocilizumab and corticosteroids, and use 
of bridging therapy. 
In the end, 74 subjects were part of Cohort 1 (Full Analysis Set) and 17 in Cohort 2 (Full Analysis Set).

Statistical methods 
Cohort  1:  Efficacy  analyses  were  conducted  using  the  inferential  analysis  set  (=first  60  subjects  who  were 
treated with KTE-X19 at a dose of 2x10Exp6 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg) and the full analysis set (=all subjects 
enrolled and leukapheresed). A sample size of 60 KTE-X19 subjects in Cohort 1 provided at least 96% power to 
distinguish between an active therapy with a 50% true response rate from a therapy with a response rate of 
25% or less, with a 1-sided alpha level of 0.025.  
Cohort 2 (descriptive only): Efficacy analyses were conducted using the modified-intent-to-treat analysis set. 
Confidence intervals for the primary efficacy endpoint ORR were calculated using the following methods: 
•  Clopper-Pearson  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 58/131 
 
  
  
•  Wilson’s method 
•  Agresti-Coull method 
•  Modfied Jeffrey’s method 
DOR estimates and FU- time for DOR were determined using the KM-approach (for FU-time for DOR the reverse 
KM approach) and derived using disease assessments obtained prior to initiation of a new anticancer therapy 
including SCT.  
Analyses were based on data accrued up until the cut-off date of 24th July 2019. According to the trial protocol, 
the outcomes of the study were to be based on the inferential analysis set (i.e. the first 60 subjects in Cohort 1 
who were treated with KTE-X19 and had had the opportunity to be followed for response for at least 6 months 
after the Week 4 disease assessment). For the purpose of this report, the focus has been put on the full analysis 
set.

Recruitment 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol, dated 12 March 2015, was amended 6 times during the course of the trial. The first patient 
has been enrolled on 16 May 2016 in accordance to Trial Protocol Version 2, dated, 21 April 2016.  The change 
of the manufacturing process from axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta) to KTE-X19 has been implemented with 
Amendment  3,  dated  23  August  2016.  Amendment  4,  dated  13  November  2017,  has  been  introduced  in 
preparation  of  the  intended  marketing  Authorisation:  A)  Identification  of  two  separate  treatment  cohorts 
(Cohort 1 and Cohort 2), and B) Addition of BTK inhibitors to permissible prior regimens. The Amendment 5, 
dated 22 June 2018, designed Cohort 1 as the pivotal cohort. The last subject has been enrolled on 16 April 2019 
in accordance to trial protocol version 6, dated 29 October 2018.  
Protocol deviations 
According to the table below, 28 subjects (41% of the safety analysis set) experienced 31 protocol deviations. 
These were not considered to impact on the efficacy of the study, because patients with major deviations with 
regard to in- and exclusion criteria have not been considered in the efficacy analyses sets. The most common 
protocol deviation was for baseline (screening) PET-CT scans not being performed within 35 days of conditioning 
chemotherapy (10 subjects, 15%); two subjects had baseline PET-CT scans at screening but did not undergo 
new  baseline  scans  after  completing  bridging  therapy  and  before  initiating  conditioning  chemotherapy.  One 
subject  in  Cohort  1  was  not  previously  treated  with  anthracycline  or  bendamustine  but  was  enrolled,  and 
another  subject  received  chemotherapy  (ibrutinib)  after  KTE-X19  infusion  and  before  documented  disease 
progression.

The analysis sets are shown in Table 8 below.  
Table 8. Analysis sets 
Data cut-off date = 24JUL2019 
Abbreviation: n/a, not applicable. 
Note: Percentages are based on the number of subjects enrolled. 
a Full analysis set is defined as all enrolled (leukapheresed) subjects. 
b Inferential analysis set consists of the first 60 subjects treated with KTE-X19 in Cohort 1 and have had the opportunity to be 
evaluated for response 6 months after the Week 4 disease assessment after KTE-X19 infusion. 
c Safety analysis set is defined as all subjects treated with any dose of KTE-X19. 
d Modified intent-to-treat analysis set is defined as all subjects treated with KTE-X19. 
The  following  5  patients  in  Cohort  1  underwent  leukapheresis  but  did  not  receive  conditioning  therapy  or 
KTE-X19 (please also refer to list below, Disposition of full analysis set subjects): 
•  1 subject due to rapidly progression of MCL 10 days after leukapheresis (listed as not treated due to 
death) 
•  1  subject  due  to  withdrawal  for  therapy  with  high-dose  cytarabine  and  lenalidomide  (listed  as  not 
treated due to death) 
•  2  subjects  due  to  unsuccessful  manufacturing  of  the  KTE-X19  product  from the  initial  leukapheresis 
material. 1 patient died due to PD before a second leukapheresis could take place (listed as not treated 
due to death), and 1 patient developed AE of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (listed as not treated 
due to AE) 
•  1 subject due to unsuccessful manufacturing of 2 leukapheresis sets. The patient ultimately withdrew IC 
(listed as not having been treated) 
Response data are not available for these subjects, and they are included in the analysis as non-responders and 
with a response of “not done”. 
For Cohort 1, as of the data cutoff date, 16 of the 68 patients (24) who received KTE-X19 had died.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The ORR was defined as CR and PR per central assessment with the following results:  
Response Rate  
IAS (N = 60) 
FAS (N = 74) 
RR (95% CI) 
CR (95% CI) 
PR (95% CI) 
56/60 (93%:83.8%, 98.2%) 
63/74 (85%:75.0%, 92.3%) 
40/60 (67%:53.3%, 78.3%) 
44/74 (59%:47.4%, 70.7%) 
16/60 (27%:16.1%, 39.7%) 
19/74 (26%: 16.2%, 37.2%) 
No subgroup analysis of ORR (central assessment) in the full analysis set were carried out. 
The primary endpoint was met, since ORR was significantly higher than the pre-specified control rate of 25% at 
1-sided significance level of 0.025 (p < 0.0001). Of 42 subjects who initially had a PR or SD, 24 subjects (57%) 
went on to achieve a CR after a median of 2.2 months (range: 1.8 to 8.3 months). Of the 24 subjects whose 
responses improved over time, 21 subjects (88%) converted from PR to CR, and 3 subjects (13%) converted 
from SD to CR.  
Objective response and CR using the investigators’ assessment had a concordance rate of 95% (κ = 0.70; 95% 
CI: 0.39, 1.00) and 90% (κ = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.94), respectively, with the ORR and CR rate using central 
assessment.

Secondary endpoints 
The primary endpoint was supported by key secondary endpoints of DOR, PFS and OS. 
Duration of Response (FAS) 
As determined per central assessment, subjects responded a median of 1.0 month (range: 0.8 to 3.1 months) 
after the KTE-X19 infusion. After a median DOR follow-up of 8.6 months, the median KM DOR was not reached. 
34 of 60 subjects (57%) presented with an ongoing response as of the data cutoff date. The longest response 
duration was 29.2 months as of the data cutoff date.

a DOR is defined as the time from the first objective response to disease progression or to death prior to new anticancer 
therapy (including SCT). Subjects not meeting the criteria by the analysis data cutoff date were censored at their last 
evaluable disease assessment date prior to the data cutoff date or new anticancer therapy (including SCT) start date, 
whichever was earlier.

Other secondary endpoints 
Across all 5 domains of the EQ-5D, the proportion of subjects who reported no health problems at screening 
ranged from 66% to 95%, with the highest percentages observed for mobility (85%), self-care (95%), and 
usual  activity  (82%).  HRQoL  improvements over  time  are  indicated  by increases  of  ≥  16  percentage  points 
being observed by Month 3. In addition, the proportion of subjects reporting more severe problems for mobility, 
self-care, and usual activities relative to screening, improved significantly by Month 6.

For  the  visual  analogue  scale  (VAS),  the  median  score  was  85.0  (range:  45  to  100)  at  screening  and  78.0 
(range: 38 to 100) at Week 4, with higher median scores of 83.0 (range: 40 to 100) at Month 3 and 90.0 (range: 
20  to 100)  at  Month  6.  The  proportion  of  patients with  a  decrease  of  ≥  10  points  in  VAS  scores  relative  to 
screening was 50% at Week 4, 29% by Month 3, and 12% by Month 6.  
The study was not designed to evaluate associations between efficacy outcomes or AEs and pre-infusion product 
characteristics. 
Secondary endpoints in the Inferential Analysis Set 
In the inferential analysis set, the ORR using the investigators’ assessment of response was 88% (53 of 60 
subjects,  95%  CI  per  the  Clopper-Pearson  method:  77.4%,  95.2%),  and  the  CR  rate  was  70%  (42  of  60 
subjects,  95%  CI  per  the  Clopper-Pearson  method:  56.8%,  81.2%).  Objective  response  and  CR  using  the 
investigators’ assessment had a concordance rate of 95% (κ = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.39, 1.00) and 90% (κ = 0.77, 
95% CI: 0.60, 0.94), respectively, with the ORR and CR rate using central assessment. 
Subjects responded a median of 1.0 month (range: 0.8 to 3.1 months) after the KTE-X19 infusion as determined 
by central assessment. After a median DOR follow-up of 8.6 months, the median KM DOR was not reached, with 
34 of 60 subjects in the inferential analysis set (57%) in an ongoing response as of the data cutoff date. The 
longest response duration was 29.2 months as of the data cutoff date. 
PFS rate estimates at 6 months and 12 months using central assessment in the inferential analysis set were 
77.0% and 60.9%, respectively, and the KM median PFS was not reached with a median potential follow-up of 
12.3 months (range: 7.0 to 32.3 months). As of the data cutoff date, the longest PFS was 30.2 months. Among 
subjects who achieved a CR, PFS rate estimates at 6 months and 12 months were 100% and 76.6%, and the KM 
median PFS was not reached. 
OS rate estimates for subjects in the inferential analysis set at 6 months and 12 months were 86.7% and 83.2%, 
respectively, and the KM median OS was not reached after a median potential follow-up of 12.3 months (range: 
7.0 to 32.3 months). Among subjects in the inferential analysis set who achieved a CR, OS rate estimates at 6 
months and 12 months were 100.0% and 97.2%, respectively, and the median OS was not reached. 
Efficacy Results in Cohort 2 for information purposes; Cohort 2 descriptive only 
ORR per central assessment was 93% (13 of 14 subjects, 95% CI per the Clopper-Pearson method: 66.1%, 
99.8%), and the CR rate was 64% (9 of 14 subjects, 95% CI per the Clopper-Pearson method: 35.1%, 87.2%) 
in the MITT set. 
After a median follow-up of 11.3 months for DOR, the median KM DOR using the central assessment of response 
was not reached, with 8 of 14 subjects in the modified intent-to-treat analysis set (57%) in an ongoing response 
as of the data cutoff date. PFS rate estimates using central assessment at 6 months and 12 months were each 
77.9%, and the KM median PFS was not reached with a median potential follow-up of 16.0 months (range: 13.9 
to 18.0 months). OS rate estimates at 6 months and 12 months for subjects in Cohort 2 who received KTE-X19 
were 92.9% and 78.6%, respectively, and the KM median OS was not reached with a median potential follow-up 
of 16.0 months (range: 13.9 to 18.0 months).

Clinical studies in special populations 
The average age of the disease condition is 60 years with a gender distribution male : female = 4:1.  The median 
age  of  the  study  population  in  ZUMA  2  was  65  years  (range:  38  to  79)  and  the  gender  distribution  was 
approximately corresponding.  
With  regard  to  the  gender,  there  have  been  differences  observed:  For  female  patients,  higher  levels  of 
anti-CD 19 T cell levels are reached, and there is a discrepancy in complete response rates at males and females

(61% for males and 50% for females). However, there is no conclusion possible due to the limited number of 
patients.The limited knowledge regarding gender for the use of KTE.X19 in this clinical setting is one of the 
reason  for  adopting  a  conditiona  Marketing  authorisation  for  tecartus,  post  authorisation  studies  have  been

Similar lack of data and confirmatory efficacy in elderly and more severe patients is not clear based on the set

Marketing authorisation are set up to further complement this missing data and to reach completeness of the 
dossier. 
Supportive study(ies) 
Historical Control  
The historical control comprises 6 clinical trials. The meta-analysis was to be used to calculate a pooled ORR 
reflective of clinical outcomes with therapies that are currently available and to support the preselected control 
ORR of 25%. 
The following criteria were required for a study’s inclusion in the meta-analysis:  
•  Subjects must have had r/r MCL. 
•  Subjects’ disease must have progressed while receiving, or relapsed after, a BTK inhibitor. 
•  Subjects must have received salvage therapy after disease progression or relapse following the BTK 
inhibitor. 
•  Response outcomes must have been included in the publication. 
Through  the  literature  search,  255  subjects  across  6  published  studies  were  identified  for  inclusion  in  the 
meta-analysis. In addition to the 2 studies (N = 92) originally used to determine the historical control rate in 
ZUMA-2, 4 studies were identified that met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. All 6 of these studies 
described  outcomes  for  patients  who  had  discontinued  ibrutinib.  Average  ORR  on  salvage  therapy  in  these 
studies was as follows:

Two additional studies were identified but not incorporated in the meta-analysis. These studies had much higher 
ORR on salvage therapy after BTKi of ~50% (Jain 2018b), 53% (Eyre 2019), 67% (Regny 2019), and 82% 
(McCulloch 2019).  The applicant did not include these studies due to one study allowing compassionate use of 
venetoclax, which is not approved for the treatment of r/r MCL in USA or Europe, and the other due to availability 
of only preliminary data.  
The  pooled  ORR  from  the  meta-analysis  of  6  studies  was  28%  (95%  CI:  23%,  34%),  which  is  clinically 
consistent with the historical control ORR of 25%. In addition, response rates published in these studies were 
based  on  investigator  assessment,  and  the  majority  were  single-institution  studies.  Considering  that  1) 
response rates determined by central assessment are often lower than those determined by investigator review 
(Zhang 2017), and 2) the primary efficacy endpoint of ZUMA-2 is the ORR per central assessment, the results of 
the meta-analysis support the pre-specified 25% historical control ORR in ZUMA-2.  
Primarily, the use of the historical control rate for ORR was based on two retrospective studies (Cheah 2015 and 
Martin 2016). In these two studies, outcomes after salvage therapy were evaluated in patients with r/r MCL who 
had  progressed  during  or  following  treatment  with  a  BTK  inhibitor  (a  required  prior  therapy  for  ZUMA-2 
eligibility). Both studies demonstrated that patients with r/r MCL who had ≥ 3 prior lines before receiving the 
BTK inhibitor had ORRs to salvage therapy of approximately 25%.  
In February 2019, an updated literature search was undertaken to further understand the outcomes of patients 
with r/r MCL whose disease had progressed during or following treatment with a BTK inhibitor. Studies identified 
through  this  search  were  to  be  included  in  a  meta-analysis  of  ORRs  to  salvage  therapy  after  discontinuing 
treatment with a BTK inhibitor. The meta-analysis was to be used to calculate a pooled ORR reflective of clinical 
outcomes with therapies that are currently available and to support the preselected control ORR of 25%. The 
following criteria were required for a study’s inclusion in the meta-analysis: 
 Subjects must have had r/r MCL. 
 Subjects must have progressed while receiving, or relapsed after receiving, a BTK inhibitor. 
 Subjects must have received salvage therapy after progression or relapse following the BTK inhibitor. 
 Response outcomes must have been included in the publication. 
Through  this  literature  search,  255  subjects  across  6  published  studies  were  identified  for  inclusion  in  the 
meta-analysis. In addition to the 2 studies originally used to determine the historical control rate in ZUMA-2, 4 
studies were identified that met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis (Dreyling 2016, Epperla 2017, Jain 
2018a, Wang 2017). All 6 of these studies described outcomes for patients who had discontinued ibrutinib. Two 
additional studies that were identified from the literature search of outcomes following BTK inhibitor treatment, 
were not included in the meta-analysis: 1 due to the preliminary single institution report of the results (Jain 
2018b) and the subsequent inclusion of some of the same subjects in ZUMA-2, and 1 study of venetoclax, which 
is  not  approved  for  the  treatment  of  r/r  MCL  in  the  US  or  Europe  and  was  administered  off-label  via  a 
compassionate use programme (Eyre 2019).  
After  the  meta-analysis  was  conducted  in  February  2019,  2  additional  studies  of  outcomes  following  BTK 
inhibitor treatment were identified (both conference presentations) (McCulloch 2019, Regny 2019). However, 
the meta-analysis was not updated because the studies included preliminary data that had not yet been peer 
reviewed. 
The  applicant  provided  satisfactory  responses  on  the  concerns  with  regard  to  the  representativeness  of  the 
historical control data. Based on them, it appears the historical controls may have been somewhat less “fit” 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 85/131 
 
  
  
than the study population (i.e. there were more patients with ECOG ≥2, fewer patients with prior STC, and (for 
the 293 patients where data were available) only approximately half of patients received combination salvage 
therapies). Furthermore, for several studies the baseline data (including the data on number of prior therapies) 
seem to be recorded at the start of BTKi treatment, thus indicating that the historical cohort were more heavily 
pre-treated at the time of post-BTKi salvage therapy. 
Therefore,  there  is  heterogeneity  amongst  the  several  trials  serving  as  historical  control  and      the 
representativeness of the historical data for the study population cannot be verified. This remaining uncertainty 
supports  the  decision  of  a  conditional  approval  and  the  necessity  to  amend  the  clinical  data  in  order  to  be 
comprehensive. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  applicant  submitted  a  marketing  authorisation  application  (MAA)  for  KTE-X19  at  a  dose  of  2x10Exp6 
cells/kg, indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The primary efficacy endpoint of ORR (CR and PR) assessed by central assessment as well as the key secondary 
endpoints of DOR and PFS have been accepted in prior protocol assistance.  
As currently, there is only little information on general efficacy results in some of the subgroups (female, elderly 
and more severe patients). This will be further addressed by the specific obligations imposed in the frame of the 
conditional marketing authorisation.   
The  pivotal  data  comes  from  one  single,  uncontrolled  open-label  ongoing,  Phase  2  study,  KTE-C19-102 
(ZUMA-2), and is based on a two data cut-off points, 24th July 2019 and 31 December 2019.  
Dose: No formal dose-finding studies were conducted. The proposed dose (Cohort 1: 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T 
cells/kg), was informed by results obtained with Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) administered to subjects 
with refractory aggressive large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in the ZUMA-1 trial, and further substantiated by PK 
cell expansion data. The data on the lower dose are too limited to draw any conclusion therefore, considering the 
shown  efficacy  and  the  balanced  and  manageable  safety,  the  dose  used  in  the  pivotal  study  cohort  1  is 
considered acceptable. 
Pivotal study design: The Zuma-2 study is an uncontrolled, open label, multicentre, Phase 2 study evaluating 
the safety and efficacy of KTE-X19 in two dose cohorts of subjects with r/r MCL. The uncontrolled study design, 
has been considered acceptable in prior scientific advice. The pivotal cohort (Cohort 1) was to enrol and treat up 
to 80 subjects with KTE-X19 at a target dose of 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg. An additional ten subjects 
enrolled in Cohort 1 received Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel). Seventeen subjects were enrolled in Cohort 2 
and  received  0.5  x  106  anti-CD19  CAR  T  cells/kg.  Only  patients  enrolled  to  receive  KTE-X19  in  Cohort  1 
contributed to the primary efficacy analyses.  
The applicant defined the first 60 subjects treated with KTE-X19 (inferential analysis set) as the primary efficacy 
population  that  would  form  the  basis  for  statistical  hypothesis  testing.  This  was  not  endorsed  by  the  CHMP 
(EMEA/H/SA/3117/7/2019/PA/ADT/PR/III), as it contradicts the ITT principle and makes the primary analysis 
population not clearly representative of any definable external population. The assessment therefore focused on 
data for the full analysis set and the required presentation of the data for the FAS has been provided, indicating 
that there were no noticeable differences.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 86/131 
 
  
  
Subjects were considered enrolled at the time of leukapheresis. Bridging therapy was allowed at the discretion 
of  the  investigator  and  included  single  agent  drugs  from  the  same  classes  as  those  used  in  the  previous 
treatment lines (dexamethasone or a BTKi). The CHMP expressed concern over the potential carry over effect 
from bridging therapy (EMEA/H/SA/3117/7/2019/PA/ADT/PR/III). In accordance to the clinical trial protocol, 
subjects  receiving  bridging  therapy  were  to  have  a  repeat  diagnostic  PET-CT  scan  prior  to  conditioning 
chemotherapy.  
The non-myeloablative conditioning regimen was identical to that used for Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) in 
large  B-cell  lymphoma,  and  could  be  repeated  if  the  KTE-X19  infusion  was  delayed  by  >  2  weeks.  This  is 
considered acceptable.  
Subjects who achieved a PR or CR had the option to receive a second course of conditioning chemotherapy and 
KTE-X19 if experiencing CD-19 positive disease progression > 3 months after the initial infusion.  Two subjects 
were retreated with KTE-X19, where 1 subject achieved a best overall response of CR and the other subject had 
a best overall response of PD, respectively.  
Patient population: The study included patients with pathologically confirmed r/r MCL (documented by either 
overexpression of cyclin D1 or presence of t(11;14)). Patients were to have received up to 5 prior regimens for 
MCL, including an anthracycline or bendamustine-containing chemotherapy, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody 
as well as a BTKi. The initial discrepancy between the study population which did not specify a lower limit to prior 
therapies and the proposed indication (r/r MCL, i.e. from 2nd line) was corrected by the applicant.  
Further key eligibility criteria included PS 0-1, no toxicities from previous therapies and adequate renal, hepatic, 
pulmonary, and cardiac function. Patients with a history of allo-SCT were excluded, as were patients with a 
history of HBV and HIV infection. These criteria define a rather selected patient population, with implications for 
the  external  validity  of  the  trial  and  the  comparisons  to  external  data  on  which  the  ORR  cut-off  has  been 
established.  
Endpoints: The primary endpoint, ORR by IRRC, is acceptable in the context of an uncontrolled trial. Responses 
were assessed according to the Lugano Classification, which is endorsed. However, the requirement for bone 
marrow confirmation of CR in patients with baseline bone marrow involvement was only introduced in protocol 
Amendment 5 (i.e. after inclusion of the first 28 patients in Cohort 1). However the majority of patients with 
baseline bone marrow involvement has been evaluated with a bone-marrow confirmed CR.  
The secondary endpoints include endpoints conventional for oncology trials such as DOR, PFS and OS and are 
considered acceptable. 
ORR control rate: The historical control rate for ORR (25%) was pre-specified based on 2 retrospective published 
studies evaluating post-BTKi salvage therapy outcomes in patients with r/r MCL. Subsequently, a meta-analysis 
of 6 studies (including the original 2 studies) was undertaken (February 2019), to further inform the historical 
response rates. The pooled ORR from this meta-analysis was 28% (95% CI: 23%, 34%). Concerns were 
expressed by the CHMP (EMEA/H/SA/3117/7/2019/PA/ADT/PR/III) that the ORR cut-off was not an a priori 
decision and that an ORR above 25% would not be considered sufficiently compelling in the context of a single 
pivotal, single arm trial. These issues, however, are considered overcome by the high response rates reported 
for KTE-X19 (ORR 85%, 95% CI 75.0%, 92.3%), indicating significant results would be achieved also with a 
substantially higher ORR success criterion. 
Nevertheless, there are several uncertainties related to the way the historical control rate was defined and its 
representativeness for the study population. Specifically, it remains unclear how heterogeneity between studies 
in the meta-analysis affected the estimation of the pooled ORR. Furthermore, limited details were provided 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 87/131 
 
  
  
concerning the search protocol and the publications excluded from the meta-analysis. In conclusion the study 
population may include a larger proportion of patients which would have been eligible for allo-SCT in a standard 
of care setting, for which the outcomes of the historical cohort may not be representative.  
Statistical methods, interim analysis and study conduct: The statistical design, sample sizes, sensitivity 
analyses and alpha correction for the pre-specified interim analyses are considered acceptable. Four interim 
analyses to be reviewed by DSMB were conducted (3 in Cohort 1 and 1 in Cohort 2). An additional interim 
analysis (Cohort 1 interim analysis 3) was performed for a Kite internal review. The implication of this analysis 
for the trial integrity requires further clarification. Furthermore, there is a discrepancy between the description 
of the interim analyses and data monitoring in the study protocol and the series of events as described in CRS. 
Whereas the study protocol describes a Cohort 1, interim 2 analysis to be conducted after 20 subjects had the 
opportunity to be followed for 3 months post infusion, the CRS reports that the opening of dosing Cohort 2 was 
based on an interim analysis of 28 subjects, followed for 3 months after the CAR T-cell infusion. In addition, a 
late protocol amendment (Amendment 5) describes the “identification” of two interim analyses (Cohort 1, 
analysis 2 and 3) and the addition of one interim analysis (Cohort 1, analysis 4). Thus, there is uncertainty 
concerning the number of interim analyses conducted and the degree to which these analyses were 
pre-specified, including the time-point at which they were introduced into the study protocol.  
The original protocol, dated 12 March 2015, was amended 6 times, with subjects receiving KTE-X19 in Cohort 1 
enrolling from Amendment 3 and onwards. Several key design elements were introduced in protocol 
Amendment 5, including the definition of the primary efficacy population and the statistical testing strategy for 
the primary endpoint. The applicant is requested to clarify the conduct of the study both with respect to the 
timing of the interim analyses, and the protocol amendments (Section 3.3), and to justify that these interim 
analyses and protocol amendments did not compromise the integrity of the study.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The provided results are based on one main clinical trial, ZUMA 2, an ongoing, uncontrolled open-label, 
multicentre trial with two treatment cohorts (Cohort 1: 2.0x10Exp6 cells/kg; Cohort 2: 0.5x10Exp6 cells/kg) 
with a primary data cut-off 24 July 2019. Additional efficacy results for a secondary data cut-off 31 December 
2019 have been provided on request. The study was conducted in 40 clinical centres in USA, Netherlands, 
France and Germany. Dose selection for Cohort 1 is based upon pharmacology results due to an interim analysis 
in ZUMA-2 indicating the dose of 2.0x10Exp6 cells/kg to be safe and effective, and on results of the ZUMA-1 trial 
where the administered CAR T-Cell product was axicabtagene ciloleucel. Cohort 1 of ZUMA 2 is regarded the 
pivotal data set. Of the 74 patients that were included in the trial 68 subjects received treatment with KTE-X19 
at the target dose of 2x10Exp6 cells/kg. In Cohort 2, which is descriptive only, 14 subjects received treatment 
with KTE-X19 at the target dose of 0.5x10Exp6 cells/kg. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of ORR (CR and PR) assessed by central assessment as well as the key secondary 
endpoints of DOR and PFS have been accepted in prior scientific advice. The study population has been analyzed 
by FAS (n=74), IAS (n=60), mITT (n=68) including subgroup sets. 
As requested, the applicant provided an update on efficacy data, presented for FAS only for cut-off date 24 July 
2019 and 31 December 2019.  
Cut-off-24 July 2019: 
The FAS is not significantly different in terms of durability of responses observed in patients achieving a best 
ORR of CR, PR. The FAS confirms the previous assessment of PFS or OS, and is consistent with the results from 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 88/131 
 
  
  
the IAS. The subgroup analyses for ORR, DOR and ongoing response are overall consistent with the results 
based on the inferential analyses set. ORRs ranging from 50% to 100%  are reported in the FAS across the 
subgroups analysed, where ORRs ranged from 75% to 100% in the inferential analysis set. In all subgroups with 
>5 subjects the lower limit of the 95% confidence intervals were above the pre-specified historic control ORR of 
25% and also above the upper CI reported for the meta-analysis (34%). 
Cut-off 31 December 2019: 
The results are consistent with the analyses based on the 24 July 2019 cut-off, with ORRs from 50% to 100% 
across the subgroups analysed. In all subgroups with >5 subjects the lower limit of the 95% confidence intervals 
were  above  the  pre-specified  historic  control  ORR  of  25%  and  also  above  the  upper  CI  reported  for  the 
meta-analysis (34%).The median DOR was not reached (95% CI:10.4 months, NE) with a median follow-up 
time  for  DOR  of  13.8  months  (95%  CI:  11.3,  20.5  months),  and  no  subgroup  analysis  of  DOR  is  therefore 
presented. 
In subgroups with ≥ 5 subjects, the ongoing response rates at data cutoff ranged from 17% to 70% and were 
generally consistent with the analysis at the 24 July 2019 cut-off. A durable response is observed in patients 
achieving a best ORR of CR (median DOR (95% CI: 14.4, NE). For the 18 subjects who achieved a PR, the 
median DOR remains short (2.2 months, 95% CI: 1.4, 4.9 months). Estimates of the ongoing response rate at 
6 months and 12 months were each 25.9%. Sensitivity analyses remains consistent between the analysis sets. 
In the updated analysis set, median PFS was still not reached in patients achieving a best ORR of CR, with PFS 
rate estimates at 6 and 12 months of 100% and 80.2%, respectively. Median PFS among subjects who achieved 
a PR was 5.4 months (95% CI: 3.3, 6.7 months),  with PFS rate estimates of at 6 months and 12 months of 
46.3% and 26.5%, respectively. Consistency across most subgroups was observed, although lower point 
estimates were reported in some subgroups with small patient numbers. CIs were wide and overlapping. 
The quality of life data has been collected with the EQ-5D questionnaire throughout the trial. While very 
welcome on a principle level, interpretation is hampered by lack of control and an open label design.  
The definition of patients to be treated with KTE-X19, is now addressed satisfactorily in the agreed indication, 
which now reflects adequately the patient population in the clinical trial. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The current clinical data set is not regarded to be comprehensive as the number of evaluated patients in the 
ZUMA-2 trial, an open label study, is regarded rather low; long-term data are not available yet. Furthermore, 
data on some subgroups such as female, elderly and more severely diseased patients are non exhaustive at this 
point in time.  Moreover, as to the historical control, there is heterogeneity in the populations, and the 
representativeness of the historical data cannot be verified.  
Additional efficacy data will be generated post-authorisation, within a registry study and a long-term follow-up 
data collection from ZUMA-2. Data to be collected will provide further long term efficacy data together with 
reassurance of efficacy in subgroups of patients (female, elderly and more severe patients) which are now 
underrepresented in the data set provided in the pivotal study.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The definition of patients to be treated with KTE-X19, is now addressed satisfactorily as the applicant updated 
the indication, which now reflects adequately the patient population in the clinical trial. 
The  unmet  medical  need  for  effective  treatments  for  patients  suffering  from  r/r  MCL  after  failure  of  BTK 
inhibitors is acknowledged. The results on primary and secondary endpoints in the ZUMA-2 trial indicate efficacy 
of KTE-X19 for the treatment of r/r MCL in the target population.   
The provided update on efficacy-analyses with the cut-off date of 31 December 2019 indicates consistency of 
results on subgroup analysis for ORR and DOR compared with results of the cut-off date 24 July 2019. Moreover, 
the results in the FAS with regard to ORR, CR, PFS and OS confirm the efficacy of KTE-X19 as evaluated on basis 
of the results in the IAS.  
The remaining uncertainties result from the limited dataset in the ZUMA-2 pivotal Cohort 1. The applicant agreed 
to amend the data post-marketing by a registry for the evaluation of efficacy of KTE-X19 in terms of objective 
response rate as primary objective including the required population (female, elderly and more severe patients) 
and to include further specific assessments for efficacy as secondary objectives. Moreover, the safety of 
KTE-X19 will be assessed as secondary objective in this post-approval study. 
As regards the required long-term follow up of patients in the pivotal cohort of the ZUMA-2 trial, the applicant is 
required to provide long-term results for efficacy and safety for those patients and to submit the anticipated 
study report in 2022 to the EMA. 
Therefore, the CAT considers the following measures necessary to ensure the follow-up of efficacy:  
•  A long term follow up: In order to further characterise the long-term efficacy and safety of Tecartus in 
adult patients with relapsed or refractory Mantle cell Lymphoma (MCL) the MAH shall conduct and 
submit the results of a prospective study based on data from a registry, according to an agreed protocol. 
The CAT furthermore considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
• 
• 
In order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of Tecartus in adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory MCL and the Benefit/Risk balance in the female, elderly and severely diseased patients, 
the MAH shall submit the results of a prospective study investigating efficacy and safety based on 
data from the same registry used to characterise the long-term efficacy and safety of Tecartus, 
according to an agreed protocol.  
In order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of Tecartus in adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory MCL the MAH shall submit the 24 months follow-up data from all treated patients in 
cohort 1 of the pivotal study ZUMA-2. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on clinical efficacy as described above.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety data were obtained from 82 r/r MCL patients treated with KTE-X19 in the pivotal study ZUMA-2 with 
a data cutoff date of 31 December 2019. Additional safety data was presented for 116 patients treated with 
KTE-X19 in supportive studies (ZUMA-3, ZUMA-4, and ZUMA-8).   
In the ZUMA-2 trial a total of 91 r/r MCL subjects were enrolled in the study and 82 (90%) subjects were treated 
with KTE-X19. Importantly, only the 68 patients in Cohort 1 received KTE-X19 at the target dose of 2 x 106 
anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg. In Cohort 2 the 14 subjects received the dose of 0.5 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg.  
In Cohort 1, 74 subjects were enrolled. 69 subjects (93%) received conditioning chemotherapy, and 68 subjects 
(92%) received KTE-X19. The median potential follow-up time from the KTE-X19 infusion for all subjects dosed 
in Cohort 1 was 16.8 months (range: 7.2 to 37.6 months) 
In Cohort 2, 17 subjects were enrolled, 15 subjects (88%) received conditioning chemotherapy, and 14 subjects 
(82%) received KTE-X19. The median potential follow-up time from the KTE-X19 infusion for subjects in Cohort 
2 was 21.3 months (range: 19.1 to 23.2 months). 
All  subjects  in  the  study  received  conditioning  chemotherapy  consisting  of  fludarabine  30  mg/m2/day  and 
cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/day administered for 3 days. Bridging therapy was permitted and administered 
to a total of 32 subjects at the discretion of the treating investigator. In Cohort 1, 25 subjects (37%) received 
bridging therapy consisting mostly of ibrutinib (14 subjects, 21%) and dexamethasone (12 subjects, 18%). In 
cohort 2, a total of 7 subjects (50%) received bridging therapy. 
There were 76 subjects treated with KTE-X19 in the US, 3 in France, 2 in the Netherlands and 1 in Germany. 
Sixty-eight (83%) patients were males and 14 (17%) were females, whereas 49% of the patients were < 65 
years, 51% were ≥ 65 years.  
Supporting  data  are  provided  from  3  Phase  1/2  studies  of  KTE-X19:  KTE-C19-103  (ZUMA-3),  KTE-C19-104 
(ZUMA-4), and KTE-C19-108 (ZUMA-8) with a data cutoff date of 31 December 2019. In these studies, a total 
of 143 subjects were treated with various doses of KTE-X19 in different indications. Of note, there were only 13 
patients in the supportive studies with various other indications who were treated with 2 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T 
cells/kg. 
Adverse events  
Safety assessments included monitoring of AEs and use of concomitant medications to manage AEs, clinical 
laboratory analyses, vital sign measurements, physical examinations, important identified and potential risks 
seen for other CAR-T products. Subjects in ZUMA-2 were also administered the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), 
a 5 to 10-minute, 11-questions assessment that examines cognitive functions.    
All 82 patients treated with KTE-X19 experienced at least one AE, 7% had worst grade 5, most of these in cohort 
1. CRS was seen in 91%, neurologic AEs in 68%, cytopenia – thrombocytopenia in 70%, neutropenia in 85% and 
anaemia in 66%, infections in 56% and hypogammaglobulinaemia in 16%. 
These AEs could be directly linked to the conditioning chemotherapy or to the administration of KTE-X19. The 
AEs described here are in line with the AEs of CAR T cell products and are a direct consequence of the mode of 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 91/131 
 
  
  
action of these products. These AEs are expected to occur based on the previous experience with this product 
class. 
The applicant has identified the following categories of risks associated with the clinical use of this drug product: 
CRS, neurologic events (including cerebral oedema), cytopenias, infections, hypogammaglobulinemia. There 
are some potential risks linked to the use of this product: secondary malignancy, immunogenicity, RCR, tumour 
lysis syndrome, and aggravation of GvHD. These risks are include din the RMP of the product and will be lowed 
post-marketing. Events of cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and autoimmune disorders were also examined. 
The important identified risks and the potential risks identified for KTE-X19 are similar to the AEs identified for 
this product class.

Severity of AEs 
In Cohort 1, all 68 subjects had at least 1 AE. 67 subjects (99%) had worst Grade 3 or higher AEs, and 48 
subjects (71%) had serious AEs (SAEs). 62 subjects (91%) had CRS; 8 subjects (12%) had worst Grade 3 CRS, 
and 2 subjects (3%) had worst Grade 4 CRS. 43 subjects (63%) had at least 1 neurologic event; 15 subjects 
(22%) had a worst Grade 3 neurologic event, and 6 subjects (9%) had a worst Grade 4 neurologic event. 22 
subjects (32%) had serious neurologic events. No subject had Grade 5 CRS or a Grade 5 neurologic event. Two 
subjects (3%) died due to AEs other than disease progression: 1 subject had a Grade 5 AE of staphylococcal 
bacteraemia that was deemed related to conditioning chemotherapy and KTE-X19, and 1 subject had a Grade 5 
AE of organizing pneumonia deemed related to conditioning chemotherapy.  
In Cohort 2, all 14 subjects had at least 1 AE. 13 subjects (93%) had worst Grade 3 or higher AEs, and 8 subjects 
(57%) had SAEs. Thirteen subjects (93%) had CRS, and 2 subjects (14%) had worst Grade 3 CRS. No subject 
had Grade 4 or Grade 5 CRS. Thirteen subjects (93%) had at least 1 neurologic event; 6 subjects (43%) had 
worst  Grade  3  neurologic  events,  and  4  subjects  (29%)  had  serious  neurologic  events.  No  subject  had  a 
neurologic event of Grade 4 or Grade 5. One subject (7%) had a fatal AE of cardiac arrest. 
AEs related to KTE-X19 
AEs related to KTE-X19 in ZUMA-2 (cohort 1 and cohort 2 combined, 82 subjects): In total 98% of subjects had 
KTE-x19 related AEs. Most common were pyrexia (93% of subjects), hypotension (56% of subjects), chills (39% 
of  subjects),  tremor  (38%  of  subjects),  hypoxia  (37%  of  subjects),  anaemia  and  white  blood  cell  count 
decreased (34% and 33%, respectively), tachycardia (30%) and encephalopathy (26%). 
Most of the common AEs are symptoms of AEs of special interest, based on experience from other CAR T cell 
products. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Cytokine Release Syndome (CRS) 
Frequencies of CRS in ZUMA-2 (both cohorts combined): In total 91% of subjects had CRS of any grade, most 
common symptoms were pyrexia (99% of subjects), hypotension (60% of subjects), hypoxia (37% of subjects) 
and chills (33% of subjects).  
In cohort 1 in total 91% had CRS. The most common CRS symptoms by PT of any grade were pyrexia (100%), 
hypotension (56%), and hypoxia (37%). The majority of subjects (76%) had worst Grade 1 or worst Grade 2, 
12% had worst Grade 3 and 3% had worst Grade 4 CRS. No subject had Grade 5 CRS. The median time to onset 
was 2 days (range: 1 to 13 days) after the KTE-X19 infusion. As of the data cut-off date, CRS had resolved in all 
subjects. The median duration of CRS was 11 days (range: 1 to 50 days). Almost the same was seen in cohort 
2: The median time to onset of CRS in cohort 2 was 6 days (range: 1 to 11 days) after the KTE-X19 infusion. As 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 98/131 
 
  
  
 
of the data cutoff date, CRS had resolved in all subjects in both cohorts. The median duration of CRS was 10 days 
(range: 3 to 31 days).  
Neurologic AEs, including cerebral oedema 
Frequency  in  neurologic  events  in  ZUMA-2  (combined  cohorts):  Neurologic  event  of  any  grade  in  68%  of 
subjects, most frequent was tremor (38% of subjects), encephalopathy (30% of subjects), confusional state 
(24% of subjects and aphasia (18% of subjects).  
In cohort 1 in total 63% had at least 1 neurologic event of any grad, 32% had serious neurologic events. The 
most  common  neurologic  events  of  any  grade  were  tremor  (35%),  encephalopathy  (26%),  and  confusional 
state (21%). The most common Grade 3 or higher neurological events were encephalopathy (18%), confusional 
state (12%) and aphasia (4%).  
The median time to onset of a neurologic event was 7 days (range: 1 to 32 days) after the KTE-X19 infusion. 
Neurologic events had resolved in all but 6 subjects as of the data cutoff date. Neurologic events for 2 subjects 
had not resolved at the time of death: 1 subject had Grade 2 nonserious agitation (deemed related to KTE-X19) 
and  Grade  3  serious  confusional  state  (deemed  related  to  conditioning  chemotherapy  and  KTE-X19),  and  1 
subject had Grade 2 nonserious hyperesthesia. Ongoing neurologic events for the remaining 4 subjects were 
Grade 1 or Grade 2. 
The duration of neurologic events for each subject was calculated as the last date of resolution for all qualifying 
neurologic events – the date of first onset of all qualifying neurologic events + 1. For the 37 subjects whose 
neurologic events had resolved, the median duration of neurologic events was 12 days (range: 1 to 567 days). 
Three subjects had neurologic events beyond Day 200 that were attributed to conditioning chemotherapy and 
KTE-X19.  Two  subjects  had  events  of  Grade  1  tremor  (from  Day  12  to  Day  236  and  Day  60  to  Day  280, 
respectively) and 1 subject had Grade 2 memory impairment that started on Day 533 and resolved on Day 571 
(this subject had other neurologic events that occurred between Day 5 and Day 72).   
In cohort 2, in total 93% had at least 1 neurologic event of any grade. The most common neurologic events of 
any grade were tremor (50%), confusional state (43%), and aphasia (36%). The median time to onset of a 
neurologic event was 12 days (range: 3 to 262 days) after the KTE-X19 infusion. Three subjects had neurologic 
events that were ongoing as of the data cutoff date: 1 subject had non-serious Grade 1 memory impairment and 
2 subjects had non-serious Grade 1 tremor. In addition, 1 subject had ongoing neurologic events at the time of 
death  (serious  Grade  3  encephalopathy,  non-serious  Grade  2  confusional  state,  and  non-serious  Grade  2 
dysarthria). For the 9 subjects whose neurologic events had resolved, the median event duration was 17 days 
(range: 4 to 178 days). 
All CRS and most neurologic AEs were reversible following adequate management, including treatment with 
tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids, according to guidelines.  
Cytopenias (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or anaemia) 
Frequency of cytopenia in ZUMA-2 (cohorts combined): In total 93% of subjects had cytopenia of any grade; 
thrombocytopenia (70% of subjects), neutropenia (85% of subjects) and anaemia 65% of subjects). 
In Cohort 1, in total 74% had thrombocytopenia AEs, and 51% had worst Grade 3 or higher. In total 87% had 
neutropenia AEs, and 85% had worst Grade 3 or higher. There were 68% with anaemia AEs of any grade, 50% 
had worst Grade 3, and no subject had worst Grade 4.  
Duration was measured as present on or after Day 30. Grade 3 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia AEs were present 
on or after Day 30 in 12% and 28%, respectively and in 16% and 25% of those with neutropenia. Thirteen 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 99/131 
 
  
  
subjects (19%) had Grade 3 anaemia AEs on or after Day 30, and no subject had Grade 4 anaemia on or after 
Day 30.  
In Cohort 2, 50% had thrombocytopenia AEs, 79% had neutropenia AEs and 50% had anaemia AEs. Grade 3 
and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia were present on or after Day 30 in 14% and 14% had Grade 4 neutropenia AEs 
that were present on or after Day 30. One subject (7%) had a Grade 3 anaemia AE, and no subject had a Grade 
4 anaemia AE on or after Day 30.  
Infections 
Frequency of infections in ZUMA-2 (cohorts combined): In total 56% of subjects had infections. Most common 
were upper respiratory tract infection (13% of subjects) and pneumonia (11% of subjects). 
Within the SOC of infections and infestations, in Cohort 1, 56% had AEs of any grade, and 32% had worst Grade 
3 or higher AEs. One subject had a Grade 5 infection (fatal staphylococcal bacteraemia). There were 15% of 
subjects that had bacterial infections, including the one that had Grade 5 staphylococcal bacteraemia. The most 
common bacterial infections were cellulitis and staphylococcal bacteraemia (each 3%). Viral infections where 
seen  in  16%  of  patients,  the  most  common  were  herpes  zoster  and  influenza  (each  4%).  Opportunistic 
infections were seen in 9% of patients. Two types of opportunistic infections were reported: oral candidiasis 
(6%) and fungal skin infections (3%). As many as 44% of subjects had other types of infections with pathogens 
unspecified, the most common were upper respiratory tract infections (13%), pneumonia (10%), and sinusitis 
(7%). 
In Cohort 2, 57% had AEs related to SOC Infections and infestations of any grade. No subject had a Grade 5 AE 
within the SOC. The most common were pneumonia and upper respiratory tract infection (each 14%). There 
were  7%  bacterial  infection,  29%  with  viral  infections,  7%  with  an  opportunistic  infection  and  36%  with 
infections with pathogens unspecified.   
Hypogammaglobulinemia 
In  Cohort  1,  13  subjects  (19%)  had  hypogammaglobulinemia.  No  subject  in  Cohort  2  had  an  AE  of 
hypogammaglobulinemia.  
Other AE of special interest 
No  cases  of  secondary  malignancies  related  to  KTE-X19  treatment,  no  cases  of  immunologic  events, 
replication-competent retrovirus or Graft-versus Host Disease were reported. One KTE-X19 related case, Grade 
3 Tumour lysis syndrome, was reported in cohort 1. The subject was treated with rasburicase, and the event 
resolved the following day. 
Other AEs of interest 
The  incidence  and  severity  of  other  AEs  of  interest  were  identified  as  following:  cardiac  arrhythmias  (SMQ 
narrow with selected broad SMQ PTs), cardiac failure (SMQ narrow), and autoimmune disorders (HLGT). 
Cardiac Arrhythmias 
The subject incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in Cohort 1 is summarised in Table 27. 
Table27. Subject Incidence of Cardiac Arrhythmias: ZUMA-2 (Cohort 1 Safety Analysis Set) (N = 68) 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020

Cardiac failures 
Three  subjects  (4%)  had  cardiac  failure  (two  subjects  with  pulmonary  oedema,  one  subject  with  ejection 
fraction decreased) in cohort 1. No subject had Grade 4 or Grade 5 cardiac failure.  
One subject (7%) in Cohort 2 had cardiac failure (worst Grade 3 pulmonary oedema), which occurred in the 
setting of CRS. 
In ZUMA-2 (both cohorts) 5% of subjects had any grade cardiac failure, none had severe grade ≥ 4. 
Concomitant medication to manage AEs 
Medications of interest were considered concomitant if they were administered on or after the date of KTE-X19 
infusion but before the hospital discharge date (except for immunoglobulins, which were included regardless of 
whether  they  were  administered  before  or  after  the  hospital  discharge  date).  In  particular,  steroids  and 
tocilizumab are important medications to manage serious cases of CRS and neurologic AEs and both are part of 
the treatment guidance included in SmPC section 4.4. As can be seen from the Table 28 below, as many as 59% 
subjects in cohort 1 were  treated with corticosteroids (with or without tocilizumab), 71% were treated with 
tocilizumab (with or without corticosteroids) and 56% were treated with corticosteroids and tocilizumab. Fewer 
needed vasopressors (22%), and 32% needed immunoglobulins. About the same was seen in cohort 2 even with 
the lower dose: 71% received corticosteroids (with or without tocilizumab), 79% were treated with tocilizumab 
(with or without corticosteroids), and 64% were treated with corticosteroids and tocilizumab, 50% were treated 
with vasopressors, and 14% were treated with immunoglobulins.

In Cohorts 1 and 2 combined, 22 subjects (27%) had died as of the data cutoff date: 18 subjects (26%) in 
Cohort 1 and 4 subjects (29%) in Cohort 2. Eighteen subjects died due to PD (16 subjects in Cohort 1 and 2 
subjects in Cohort 2). One subject in Cohort 2 died on Day 286 due to a toxicity associated with an allo-SCT 
regimen (reported as “other”). 
Five subjects died within 3 months of the KTE-X19 infusion, and 17 subjects died > 3 months after the KTE X19 
infusion. Three subjects died due to AEs:  
 A patient in Cohort 1 died due to organizing pneumonia on Day 37 following SAEs of Grade 4 respiratory 
failure  and  Grade  4  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome;  both  Grade  4  events  started  on  Day  21  and  were 
ongoing as of the date of death. Preceding events included Grade 3 increased blood creatinine (Day 32 to Day 
34) followed by Grade 3 decreased urine output (starting on Day 34 and ongoing as of the date of death). The 
subject had also experienced 2 earlier events of CRS, both of maximum Grade 3 (from Day 3 to Day 10 and from 
Day 16 to Day 20, respectively) as well as an SAE of confusional state, maximum Grade 3 (starting on Day 10 
and  ongoing  as  of  the  date  of  death).  The  death  was  deemed  related  to  conditioning  chemotherapy  but 
unrelated to KTE-X19. 
 A patient in Cohort 1 died due to staphylococcal bacteraemia (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) on 
Day 134 after the KTE-X19 infusion; the fatal event was listed as streptococcal bacteraemia as of the data cutoff 
date. Per the subject’s request, he was discharged on Day 132 and discontinued treatments. On Day 134, he 
died due to sepsis (staphylococcal bacteraemia). No autopsy was performed. Per the investigator, treatment 
with high-dose steroids likely contributed to susceptibility to the infection. The death was deemed related to 
conditioning chemotherapy and KTE-X19.

 A patient in Cohort 2 died on Day 18 from an event of cardiac arrest. This subject was noted to have an 
elevated anion gap before receiving KTE-X19, suggesting that pre-existing underlying disease contributed to the 
metabolic acidosis that was linked to the cardiac arrest. The metabolic acidosis and elevated anion gap worsened 
on Day 6, followed by CRS on Day 10 (which resolved on Day 13) and encephalopathy on Day 12 (which was 
ongoing as of the date of death). This death was considered to be unrelated to study treatment (i.e. due to 
leukapheresis, conditional chemotherapy, or KTE-X19).

The most common increased laboratory values observed in Cohort 1 were for glucose levels, AST and ALT. The 
other most common decreased laboratory values observed were calcium, phosphate, and albumin.  
In Cohort 2, the most common increases observed in laboratory values were for glucose levels, ALT, bilirubin 
and creatinine. All had decreases in haematological values, as well as calcium, albumin, and phosphate.

Five subjects in ZUMA-2 met initial laboratory criteria for Hy’s law (4 subjects in Cohort 1 and 1 subject in Cohort 
2). Upon clinical review, an alternate explanation for liver dysfunction was noted in all 5 subjects. Thus, no 
subject in ZUMA-2 was considered to have met criteria for Hy’s law. 
As many as 17% of subjects had increase in urate of Grade≥3. This may be associated with the risk of TLS. In 
SmPC section 4.4 there is a recommendation to administer allopurinol in patients with elevated uric acid and 
high tumour burden prior to infusion. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
The applicant presented two age groups, subjects who were ≥ 65 years and < 65 years old. In Cohort 1 by 
comparison  to  the  younger  subgroup  subjects  who  were  ≥  65  years  old  showed  a  trend  toward  a  higher 
incidence of SAEs (72% versus 62%), KTE-X19-related SAEs (59% versus 45%), Grade 3 or higher CRS (21% 
versus 7%), Grade 3 or higher neurologic events (36% versus 24%), Grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia (56% 
versus 45%), and Grade 3 or higher infections (38% versus 24%). Compared with subjects who were ≥ 65 
years old, subjects who were < 65 years old showed a trend toward a higher incidence of CRS of any grade (97% 
versus 87%). 
Results in Cohorts 1 and 2 combined were generally consistent with results observed in Cohort 1. 
There is a relatively higher incidence of SAEs, CRS, CRES and infections in the population older than 65 years. 
Sex 
Sex has a more significant influence on the number and severity of AEs, as women seem more prone to develop 
AEs  and  these  AEs  are  of  higher  grade,  when  compared  to  male  study  participants.  Compared  with  males, 
females showed a trend towards a higher incidence of KTE-X19-related SAEs (64% versus 51%), e. g. worst 
Grade 3 or higher CRS (45% versus 9%), any neurologic events (73% versus 61%), worst Grade 3 or higher 
neurologic  events  (64%  versus  25%),  any  grade  serious  neurologic  events  (55%  versus  28%),  any  grade 
thrombocytopenia  (82%  versus  72%),  worst  Grade  3  or  higher  thrombocytopenia  (73%  versus  47%),  any 
grade anaemia (82% versus 65%), worst Grade 3 or higher anaemia (64% versus 47%), any grade infections 
(73% versus 53%), and worst Grade 3 or higher infections (45% versus 30%).  
This divergence has been also observed for another CAR T cell product and seems to be irrespective of the 
indication. 
AEs by performance status at baseline 
Compared with subjects who had a baseline ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) Performance Status of 
0, subjects who had an ECOG Performance Status of 1 showed a trend towards a higher incidence of worst Grade 
3 or higher CRS (21% versus 11%), worst Grade 3 or higher neurologic events (42% versus 25%), and any 
grade  serious  neurologic  events  (42%  versus  27%).  Compared  with  subjects  who  had  a  baseline  ECOG 
Performance Status of 1, subjects who had a Performance Status of 0 showed a trend towards a higher incidence 
of  any  grade  thrombocytopenia  (84%  versus  54%),  any  grade  neutropenia  (93%  versus  75%),  any  grade 
serious infections (30% versus 17%), and any grade hypogammaglobulinemia (23% versus 13%).

There  is  no  relevant  clinical  experience  with  KTE-X19  therapy  in  pregnant  women,  and  animal  reproductive 
studies  have not  been  performed.  Once  infused,  CAR  T-cells  may  persist long  term  and  women  who  plan  a 
pregnancy should consult their physician. This therapy should not be administered to pregnant women. Women 
of  childbearing  potential  must  have  a  negative  pregnancy  test  prior  to  enrolment  due  to  the  potentially 
dangerous effects of the preparative chemotherapy on the foetus. Contraception must be used during treatment 
and for 6 months after receiving lymphodepleting chemotherapy and KTE-X19. This is reflected in SmPC section 
4.6. 
Paediatric Subjects < 18 Years of Age 
No children were included in ZUMA-2 study. Paediatric and adolescent subjects with r/r B-precursor ALL are 
being treated with KTE-X19 in ZUMA-4; 29 subjects had been treated as of the data cut-off date. KTE-X19 shows 
preliminary evidence of a manageable safety profile in paediatric subjects. All 29 subjects had at least 1 AE, and 
28 subjects (97%) had worst Grade 3 or higher AEs. 28 subjects (97%) had AEs that were related to KTE-X19, 
20  subjects  (69%) had  at  least  1  SAE;  and  17  subjects  (59%)  had  SAEs  that  were  related to  KTE-X19.  25 
subjects (86%) had CRS; 8 subjects (28%) had worst Grade 3 or higher CRS. 19 subjects (66%) had neurologic 
events;  7  subjects  (24%)  had  worst  Grade  3  or  higher  neurologic  events.  No  subject  had  Grade  5  CRS  or 
neurologic event. Two subjects (7%) had fatal AEs not due to PD; both were infection. 
Immunological events 
Despite some positive antibody test results in the initial screening assay, the confirmatory cell-based tests did 
not  bring  any  evidence  for  the  presence  of  FMC63  antibodies  (a  CD19  antibody  clone).  Therefore, 
immunogenicity does not represent a hazard for the subjects treated with the product. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Not applicable 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were no discontinuations due to AEs, this is a one-time administered therapy.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  database  included  a  total  of  82  subjects  treated  with  KTE-X19  in  the  ZUMA-2  trial.  The  overall 
exposure to KTE-X19 including the supportive trials was 225.  
In the ZUMA-2 study in Cohort 1 68 subjects received the intended target dose of 2.0 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T 
cells/kg, whereas for Cohort 2 14 subjects received 0.5 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg. There are no significant 
dose dependent differences with respect to AEs in the two cohorts. The median potential follow-up time from the 
KTE-X19 infusion for all subjects dosed in Cohort 1 was 16.8 months (range: 7.2 to 37.6 months). The median 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 108/131 
 
  
  
potential follow-up time from the KTE-X19 infusion for subjects in Cohort 2 was 16.0 months (range: 13.9 to 
18.0 months). The median potential follow-up time from the KTE-X19 infusion for subjects in Cohort 2 was 21.3 
months (range: 19.1 to 23.2 months).  In the three supportive studies a total of 143 patients were treated with 
KTE-X19 at various doses (0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 x 106 CAR T cells/kg). Only 13 patients in the supportive studies 
received the intended dose of 2.0 x 106 CAR T cells/kg.  
All patients in ZUMA-2 had at least one AE, 80 subjects (98%) had worst Grade 3 or higher AEs, and 56 subjects 
(68%) had serious AEs (SAEs). The most common KTE-X19 related AEs reported were pyrexia, hypotension, 
chills, tremor, anaemia, hypoxia, white blood cell count decrease, encephalopathy and tachycardia. Many of 
these are symptoms of the most critical AEs, in particular CRS, neurologic AEs, cytopenias and infections. Time 
to onset was usually a few days and duration was in median 11-12 days, but could last for several months, in 
particular  for  neurologic  AEs.  All  CRS  and  most  neurologic  AEs  were  reversible  with  adequate  management 
according to recommended guidelines (SmPC section 4.4), but four subjects had still ongoing neurologic AEs at 
cut-off  date.  One  death  (caused  by  staphylococcus  bacteraemia)  was  considered  related  to  conditional 
chemotherapy and KTE-X19 infusion.  
MCL is primarily a cancer disease in elderly above 65 years of age and in the pivotal study (ZUMA-2) in total 42 
(51%  of  subjects)  were  ≥65  years,  in  cohort  1,  39  (57%)  subjects  were  ≥65  years.  There  are  only  minor 
differences in the two age groups regarding AEs. The older patients seem to have a slightly higher incidence of 
AEs. Sex could have a more significant influence on the number and severity of AEs, as women seem more prone 
to develop AEs and these AEs are of higher grade, when compared to male study participants. This divergence 
has been also observed for Yescarta and seems to be irrespective of the indication.  
Pregnant women are not allowed to undergo the therapy, and contraception must be used for 6 months after 
receiving the therapy. Breastfeeding women were also prohibited in receiving this therapy.  
The safety of KTE-X19 has not been investigated separately for subjects with renal or hepatic impairment.  
There were no paediatric patients treated with MCL 
For the patients included in the pivotal study, the vast majority had CRS of any grade as well as neurologic 
events, and the majority of the patients also had different grades of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia or anaemia. 
About  half  of  the  patients  suffered  from  an  infection  episode,  and  about  16%  of  the  patients  had 
hypogammaglobulinemia.   
The important identified risks and the potential risks identified for KTE-X19 are similar to the AEs identified for 
this  product  class.  The  important  identified  risks  are:  CRS,  neurotoxicity,  cytopenias,  infections, 
hypogammaglobulinemia.  
CRS and neurologic events had an early onset. Neurologic AEs were often seen as part of the CRS events. All 
CRS events were resolved at the time of the data cutoff. Neurologic events resolved for all but 6 subjects; 2 of 
the 6 subjects had ongoing neurologic events at the time of death: 1 subject had ongoing neurologic event not 
related  to  KTE-X19,  the  other  subject  had  2  ongoing  neurologic  events  related  to  KTE-X19  (agitation  and 
confusional state). The remaining unresolved neurologic events in 4 subjects were either Grade 1 (tremor and 
dysaesthesia) or Grade 2 (hypoaesthesia). Data indicates that there can be an association between both tumour 
burden/disease burden and dose infused (number of CAR-T cells/kg) and the risk for CRS and neurologic AEs. 
The higher peak blood levels of KTE-X19 correlated well with higher grades of CRS and CRES. The applicant was 
requested to discuss such data from ZUMA-studies and possible associations with the severity, duration and 
management of CRS and neurologic AEs for both cohorts. No clear linear relationship between tumour burden 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 109/131 
 
  
  
and the incidence of severe CRS or neurologic events, or relationship between dose of CAR-T cells given and 
incidence of such events was found in the data. 
Management  plans  for  CRS  and  neurotoxicity  are  included  in  the  SmPC  in  conjunction  with  the  respective 
grading  guidance.  Patients  with  CRS  or  neurotoxicity  were  treated  with  steroids,  tocilizumab,  supplemental 
oxygen and vasopressors: 71% were treated with tocilizumab for any AE, 38% were treated with steroids for 
neurologic AEs, 56% were treated with both steroids and tocilizumab. 28% of subjects had to be treated with 
more than two doses of tocilizumab.  
Cytopenias and hypogammaglobulinaemias lead to the increased risk of infections. These AEs were managed 
according to standard protocols and this is also indicated in the SmPC. Cytopenias usually resolved within a few 
weeks, but in some cases were present at 30 days after infusion. A challenge when assessing the degree of 
cytopenias related to KTE-X19 is the fact that cytopenias also are frequent AEs following medicines used in the 
bridging therapy and conditional chemotherapy given the period before KTE-X19 infusion.  However, inclusion 
criteria were “Toxicities due to prior therapy must have been stable and recovered to ≤ Grade 1”, which should 
imply that the worsening of cytopenias observed after KTE-X19 infusion are probably related to lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy or the CAR-T infusion. Duration of cytopenias is reported as “presence on and after day 30”. 
Twenty-two subjects (32%) were administered gammaglobulines in the pivotal study, cohort 1.  
Cardiac  AEs  were  reported  following  KTE-X19  infusion.  There  was  a  trend  in  lower  frequencies  of  cardiac 
arrhythmias  (57%  and  79%)  and  cardiac  failure  (4%  and  7%)  in  cohort  1  compared  to  cohort  2.  Cardiac 
arrhythmias are reported as part of CRS. These cardiac AEs are not considered as direct cardiotoxicity from 
anti-CD19 CAR T cells. The cardiac elevations seem rather to be associated with CRS or concomitant TLS 
There was one case of tumour lysis syndrome in Cohort 1, which resolved upon treatment with rasburicase. In 
total 16% of subjects in cohort 1 had increase in urate of grade ≥3. This may be associated with the risk of TLS. 
In SmPC section 4.4 there is a recommendation to administer allopurinol in patients with elevated uric acid and 
high tumour burden prior to infusion. 
There  were  three  subjects  who  died  in  the  pivotal  study  due  to  AEs.  One  case  was  deemed  related  to 
conditioning  chemotherapy  but  unrelated  to  KTE-X19,  one  case  was  deemed  related  to  conditioning 
chemotherapy and KTE-X19. The third patient deceased as a consequence of a pre-existing condition, which was 
not deemed related to the study treatment. In the supportive studies a total of 11 subjects deceased due to AEs. 
From these cases two were deemed to be KTE-X19 related, a further patient deceased due to a Grade 5 cerebral 
oedema after the cut-off date.  
Interestingly,  there  are  several  patients  with  negative  CD19  IHC  (6  patients)  and  with  CD19  IHC  results 
unavailable (19 patients). Nonetheless, acknowledging the limited number of these patients, based on the data 
provided by the applicant no obvious safety risk could be identified for CD19 negative subjects. 
Within the observed AEs some can be directly linked to the conditioning chemotherapy (cytopenias), and other 
AEs are directly linked to the administration of KTE-X19. CRS and neurological adverse reaction are likely caused 
by KTE-X19, while cytopenias might also be related to conditioning chemotherapy or previous therapies even 
though most laboratory values should be of grade ≤1 before KTE-X19 infusion. The AEs described here are in line 
with the AEs of CAR T cell products and are a direct consequence of the mode of action of these products. These 
AEs are expected to occur based on the previous experience with this product class. Though the safety data is 
limited for any firm conclusion, the safety profile of KTE-X19 appears to be in accordance with the expected 
known class effects.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 110/131 
 
  
  
No  further  risks  and  AEs  could  be identified  which  would  be  specific  for  KTE-X19  or  for  the indication  to  be 
treated with KTE-X19. The important identified risks in the RMP are: CRS, neurotoxicity, cytopenias, infections, 
hypogammaglobulinemia.  There  are  some  potential  risks  linked  to  the  use  of  this  product:  secondary 
malignancy,  immunogenicity,  RCR,  tumour  lysis  syndrome,  and  aggravation  of  GvHD.  These  risks  will  be 
followed part of the pharmacovigilance activities described in the RMP. 
Essentially, these AEs and risks are similar to what has been described for other CAR T cell therapies. No further 
risks and AEs could be identified which would be specific for KTE-X19 or for the indication to be treated with 
KTE-X19. The risk mitigation measures are presented in the SmPC and are in line with the general management 
plans for this product class. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary

Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The imposed specific obligations in the frame of the conditional Marketing Authorisation will provide long-term 
and per-population subgroups efficacy data and will also collect long term safety data for the product.   
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Therapy with KTE-X19 is associated with a high incidence of AE/ADR and a clinically relevant fraction of these 
AE/ADR is of a severity of grade ≥ 3 and/or serious. However they are consistent with the safety profile of the 
product class and generally manageable with SmPC recommendations. 
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to ensure the follow-up of safety: 
•  A long term follow up: In order to further characterise the long-term efficacy and safety of Tecartus in 
adult  patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  Mantle  cell  Lymphoma  (MCL)  the  MAH  shall  conduct  and 
submit the results of a prospective study based on data from a registry, according to an agreed protocol. 
The  CAT  furthermore  considers  the  following  measures  necessary  to  address  the  missing  safety  data  in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
• 
• 
In order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of Tecartus in adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory MCL and the Benefit/Risk balance in the female, elderly and severely diseased patients, 
the MAH shall submit the results of a prospective study investigating efficacy and safety based on 
data  from  the  same  registry  used  to  characterise  the  long-term  efficacy  and  safety  of  Tecartus, 
according to an agreed protocol. 
In order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of Tecartus in adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory  MCL  the  MAH  shall  submit  the  24 months  follow-up  data  from  all  treated  patients  in 
cohort 1 of the pivotal study ZUMA-2.

 Conclusion 
The CHMP, CAT and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance  
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP and CAT considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
Annex  II,  Section  C  of  the  CHMP  Opinion.  The  applicant  did  request  alignment  of  the  PSUR  cycle  with  the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 24 July 2020. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The  applicant  declared  that  autologous  peripheral  blood  t  cells  CD4  and  CD8  selected  and  CD3  and  CD28 
activated transduced with retroviral vector expressing anti-CD19 CD28/CD3-zeta chimeric antigen receptor and 
cultured has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the European Union. 
The CAT/CHMP, based on the available data, considers autologous anti-CD19-transduced CD3+ cells to be a new 
active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of a 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 118/131 
 
  
  
bridging report making reference to Yescarta. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found 
acceptable. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A  request  to  omit  certain  particulars  from  the  labelling  as  per  Art.63.3  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  has  been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
Based on art. 63(3), the applicant requested the use of minimum particulars on the label to be included on the 
ethylene-vinyl acetate cryostorage infusion bag. Even if the bag contains approximately 68mL of cell dispersion, 
the company claimed there was insufficient space for full particulars. They proposed to display the name of the 
medicinal  product,  route  of  administration,  expiry  date,  batch  specific  information  (lot  number,  patient  ID, 
patient name, patient DOB), volume, information on autologous use and need to verify patient identity. The use 
of minimum particulars would also allow for the batch specific information to be clearly inserted by hand. 
The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included in the 
Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, and translated in all languages but will appear in grey-shaded 
to show that they will not be included on the printed materials.  
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Tecartus (autologous anti-CD19-transduced CD3+ 
cells) is included in the additional monitoring list as: 
• 
• 
• 
It  contains  a  new  active  substance  which,  on  1  January  2011,  was  not  contained  in  any  medicinal 
product authorised in the EU; 
It is a biological product that is not covered by the previous category and authorised after 1 January 
2011; 
It is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation [REG Art 14-a].  
Therefore,  the  summary  of  product  characteristics  and  the  package  leaflet  includes  a  statement  that  this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with distinctive clinical, 
biological, and molecular characteristics and a generally aggressive, albeit heterogeneous, clinical course. The 
lymphoma cells in MCL are thought to originate from antigen-naive pre-germinal centre B cells within the mantle 
zone of the lymph node and typically express several surface markers including CD19 and CD20. The molecular 
hallmark of MCL is the chromosomal translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32), which results in overexpression of the cell 
cycle regulator cyclin D1. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 119/131 
 
  
  
MCL  patients  are  often  diagnosed  with  advanced  disease  (Stage  III  or  IV),  characterised  by  an  aggressive 
clinical course. Patients present with generalised lymphadenopathy and extranodal involvement of the blood, 
bone marrow, spleen and gastrointestinal (15% to 30%). Prognostic factors include the (simplified) MIPI risk 
score (performance status, age, LDH levels > upper limit of normal, and white blood cell count), which can be 
further  improved  by  adding  the  Ki
67  proliferative  index.  Morphological  variant  also  impacts  outcome,  with 
blastoid and pleomorphic cytomorphology being associated with a poorer prognosis. 
‐
MCL accounts for approximately 5% to 7% of malignant lymphoma in Western Europe. The estimated annual 
incidence of MCL is approximately 1 to 2 per 100,000 in Europe. MCL is more likely to affect men than women, 
and the median age at diagnosis is 68 years 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In  the  r/r  situation  in  MCL,  the  treatment  concepts  comprise  immunochemotherapy  followed  by 
autologous/allogeneic SCT, BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib and acalabrutinib; both approved in the US; only ibrutinib is 
approved  in  the  EU),  the  immunomodulatory  (and  thalidomide  analogue)  agent  lenalidomide,  the  m-TOR 
inhibitor  temsirolimus  and  the  BCL-2  antagonist  venetoclax.  Bortezomib  is  approved  in  the  EU  for  use  in 
combination with R-CHOP for the treatment of newly diagnosed MCL, and it has also been investigated as a 
monotherapy  in  relapsed/refractory  MCL.  An  optimal  sequence  of  treatments  for  r/r  MCL  has  not  been 
established. Choice of regimen is influenced by response duration to frontline therapy, comorbidities, tumour 
chemo-sensitivity, and overall risk-benefit evaluations. 
Responses to ASCT in relapse are inferior to those in first-line and there is no consensus on the benefit of its use 
in  relapsed/refractory  disease  (Ketterer  et  al,  1997;  Robinson  et  al,  2015).  By  contrast,  allo-SCT  has  the 
potential to be curative in relapse/refractory MCL (Vose 2015), in younger patients (i.e. <65 years) while few 
patients with r/r MCL are candidates for allo-SCT . However, high treatment-related mortality rates of up to 40% 
following allo-SCT were also reported, primarily due to graft-versus host disease, and the majority of patients 
still did not achieve durable remissions. 
Maintenance regimens with rituximab in the r/r situation have a favourable safety profile and prolong PFS and 
OS, however, second-line maintenance in patients relapsing after front-line maintenance is not recommended 
which implies a restriction of a therapeutically approach in the r/r situation of MCL a priori.  
Despite promising high rates of ORR (68%) for BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib SmPC) in the relapsed setting, they are 
not considered as curative treatments since all patients will eventually have progressive disease after receiving 
a BTK inhibitor.  
Although the clinical outcome at MCL generally improved in the last years, the r/r situation and disease progress 
during or after treatment with BTK inhibitors mean rather limited further treatment options for the patient. Thus, 
novel therapy strategies resulting in durable response rates are required. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The single pivotal trial is ZUMA 2, an ongoing Phase 2 open label multicentre clinical trial (with data cut-off point 
of 24th July 2019) to evaluate efficacy and safety of KTE-X19 at a target dose of 2x106 cells/kg in the pivotal 
Cohort 1. The study population were adults with r/r MCL after ≤ 5 lines of prior therapy including anthracycline 
or bendamustine, anti-CD20 mABs and BTK inhibitors.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 120/131 
 
  
  
Inclusion criteria were confirmed r/r MCL (documented by either overexpression of cyclin D1 or presence of 
t(11;14)).  Patients  were  to  have  received  up  to  5  prior  regimens  for  MCL,  including  an  anthracycline  or 
bendamustine-containing chemotherapy, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody as well as a BTKi. Patients with a 
central nervous system lymphoma and a history of allogeneic SCT, prior anti-CD 19-targeted therapy, CAR or 
other genetically modified T-cell therapy were excluded. 
Subjects were considered enrolled at the time of leukapheresis. Bridging therapy with dexamethasone or a BTKi 
was allowed at the discretion of the investigator and subjects receiving bridging therapy were to have a repeat 
diagnostic PET-CT scan prior to conditioning chemotherapy. 
The non-myeloablative conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day) and cyclophosphamide 
(500 mg/m2/day) administered for three days and could be repeated if the KTE-X19 infusion was delayed by > 
2 weeks. 
The primary and secondary endpoints in ZUMA 2 were ORR (CR and PR), DOR and PFS. The applicant defined the 
first 60 subjects treated with KTE-X19 (inferential analysis set) as the primary efficacy population. However, the 
Cohort 1 full analysis set FAS (n=74)  was used as the primary basis for the efficacy  assessment by central 
assessment and investigator assessment, respectively. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Per data cut-off date 24 July 2019, observed favourable effects for FAS were the ORR rate of 85 % (95% CI: 
75.0%, 92.3%), while CR was 59% (95% CI: 47.4%, 70.7%). The response rates were generally consistent 
across various evaluable subgroups, with the point estimate for ORR ranging from 75% to 100% in individual 
subgroups, compared to 93% (CI: 84%-98%) which was observed for all subjects (inferential analysis set). 
Regarding efficacy per data cut off 31 December 2019, the figures on ORR and CR are considered comparable to 
the results per data cut-off 24 July 2019 for the FAS. The rates for the primary efficacy endpoint of ORR per 
central  assessment  (85%)  and  for  the  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  of  DOR  per  central  assessment  (43%  in 
ongoing response, DOR 13.8 months and median DOR not reached) are confirmed.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The  population  for  efficacy  evaluation  is  limited  to  74  patients  with  ECOG  performance  status  O  and  1  at 
baseline. It is likely that the recruited population is a selected population. Only 14 women were recruited to this 
trial,  even  though  the  point  estimate  for  ORR  is  comparable  the  CI  indicate  that  efficacy  is  less  well 
characterised.  Patients  with  bulky  disease  also  had  considerably  lower  rate  of  response,  again  the  patient 
number  is  very  low.  These  observations  indicate  this  dataset  is  very  limited  and  there  are  uncertainties  as 
regards the external validity of the trial.  
While the response to treatment is indicative of activity of a medicinal product, time-related endpoints which are 
regarded as a standard prerequisite for assessment of patient benefit are lacking for KTE-X19. The combination 
of a high rate of complete responders with durable responses may alleviate this concern, however in the present 
case long term efficacy data are not available yet and median DOR FU is 8.6 months. Moreover, the single arm 
open label design is leading to potentially biased estimates for efficacy. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 121/131 
 
  
  
 
The uncertainties and limitation reported above will be captured by the commitments imposed in the frame of 
the long term follow up study (see Annex II and RMP). In order to further characterise the long-term efficacy and 
safety  of  Tecartus  in  adult  patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  mantle  cell  lymphoma  (MCL)  the  MAH  shall 
conduct and submit the results of a prospective study based on data from a registry, according to an agreed 
protocol. The specific obligation is imposed as per the conditional marketing authorisation (see section 3.7.3). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The unfavourable effects for patients treated with KTE-X19 do not only occur as a consequence of KTE-X19 
treatment, but the bridging therapy and conditioning chemotherapy may also induce such effects.  
The most common KTE-X19 related AEs reported in the phase II study, ZUMA-2, were pyrexia, hypotension, 
chills, tremor, anaemia, hypoxia, white blood cell count decrease, encephalopathy and tachycardia.  Many of 
these are symptoms of the most critical AEs, in particular cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurologic AEs, 
cytopenias and infections. Time to onset was usually a few days and duration was in median 11-12 days, but 
could last for several months, in particular for neurologic AEs. A list of unfavourable effects are expected and 
regarded as class effects for CAR-T cell-based therapies.  
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) observed in clinical study subjects treated with KTE-X19 has generally been 
manageable  and  reversible  with  supportive  care  measures,  tocilizumab,  and/or  corticosteroids.  In  ZUMA-2 
Cohort 1, 62 subjects (91%) had CRS. Fifty-two subjects (76%) had worst Grade 1 or worst Grade 2 CRS, 8 
subjects (12%) had worst Grade 3 CRS, and 2 subjects (3%) had worst Grade 4 CRS. No subject had Grade 5 
CRS. The median time to onset of CRS was 2 days after the KTE-X19 infusion. As of the data cutoff date, CRS had 
resolved in all subjects; the median duration of CRS was 11 days. CRS can be managed with standard supportive 
care (see SmPC). 
Serious  neurologic  events  (CART-related  encephalopathy  syndrome  (CRES))  including  cerebral  oedema 
observed in clinical study subjects treated with KTE-X19 have generally been manageable and reversible with 
supportive care measures, corticosteroids, and, in the setting of CRS, with tocilizumab. In ZUMA-2 Cohort 1, 43 
subjects  (63%)  had  neurologic  events.  Twenty-two  subjects  (32%)  had  worst  Grade  1  or  worst  Grade  2 
neurologic events, 15 subjects (22%) had worst Grade 3 neurologic events, and 6 subjects (9%) had worst 
Grade 4 neurologic events. No subject had a Grade 5 neurologic event. The median time to onset of a neurologic 
event was 7 days. Neurologic events had resolved in 37 of 43 subjects (86%) as of the data cutoff date, and the 
median duration of neurologic events for those 37 subjects was 12 days. Neurologic AEs can be managed with 
standard supportive care and as provided in the adult Neurologic Toxicity Grading and Management Guidance 
included in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). 
Infections  are  often  seen  in  subjects  treated  with  KTE-X19.  The  risk  of  infection  may  be  increased  by 
neutropenia  due  to  preparative  lymphodepleting  chemotherapy,  pre-existing  or  treatment  induced 
hypogammaglobulinemia, prior cancer treatments, and underlying B-cell malignancy in subjects who receive 
KTE-X19 therapy. In ZUMA-2 Cohort 1, under the SOC of infections and infestations, 38 subjects (56%) had AEs 
of any grade. Of those subjects with AEs of infection, 17 subjects (25%) had worst Grade 3, 4 subjects (6%) had 
worst Grade 4, and 1 subject had a Grade 5 AE (staphylococcal bacteraemia). Compared with subjects who were 
< 65 years of age, subjects who were ≥ 65 years of age showed a trend toward a higher incidence of worst Grade 
3 or higher infections (38% versus 24%). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 122/131 
 
  
  
One  subject  in  Cohort  1,  had  worst  Grade  3  Tumour  lysis  syndrome  (TLS),  related  to  KTE-X19occurring 
concurrently with Grade 2 CRS, Patients are monitored for signs and symptoms of TLS and events are managed 
according to local guidelines. 
Cytopenias (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or anaemia) were critical AEs, in particular febrile neutropenia as 
this  represents  a  high  risk  of  infections  (see  above).  In  ZUMA-2  (combined  cohorts)  93%  of  subjects  had 
cytopenia of any grade; thrombocytopenia (70% of subjects), neutropenia (85% of subjects) and anaemia 65% 
of subjects). Compared with subjects who were < 65 years of age, subjects who were ≥ 65 years of age showed 
a trend toward a higher incidence of worst Grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia (56% versus 45%). Compared 
with females, males showed a trend toward a higher incidence of any grade neutropenia (89% versus 73%) and 
worst Grade 3 or higher neutropenia (88% versus 73%). 
Hypogammaglobulinemia was identified in 13 subjects (19%) in cohort 1. 
In  ZUMA-2  (combined  cohorts)  61%  of  subjects  had  any  grade  cardiac  arrhythmias  and  there  were  5%  of 
subjects that had cardiac failure.  
The most common increased laboratory values are glucose, AST and ALT. Four subjects met initial laboratory 
criteria for Hy’s law. Upon clinical review, an alternate explanation for liver dysfunction was noted in all subjects. 
Thus, no subject was considered to have met criteria for Hy’s law. All subjects had decreased laboratory values 
for  haemoglobin,  neutrophils,  leukocytes,  and  lymphocytes,  and  all  but  1  subject  had  decreased  laboratory 
values for platelets. The other most common decreased laboratory values observed were calcium, phosphate 
and albumin. 
Overall, the unfavourable effects are in line with the experience made with this drug class. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The major limitation for safety assessment of KTE-X19 is the limited sample size in the pivotal study ZUMA-2 
including 82 subjects, of which only 68 subjects were administered the recommended dose and with rather short 
follow  up  limited  to  a  median  of  16.8  months  (range:  7.2  to  37.6  months)  for  cohort1.  The  applicant  has 
estimated that based on the ZUMA-2 study adverse drug reactions with a frequency greater than 1 in 27 could 
be detected if there were no background incidence. This means that only common AEs have been captured and 
that the knowledge about long-term safety is limited. 
However, since the unfavourable effects are in line with the experience made with this drug class, there are no 
major concerns arising from these uncertainties and limitations. Nevertheless, there are certain limitations of 
the safety data which need to be followed up. These limitations relate in particular to the influence of age and sex 
on  the  incidence  and  severity  of  ADR.  Long-term  safety  data  in  the  study  subjects  are  not  available.  The 
applicant committed to further characterise the long-term safety of KTE-X19 including secondary malignancies 
within the post-authorisation obligations.  
The applicant agreed to provide additional at least 24-months long-term efficacy and safety data for full analysis 
set  treated  patients  in  the  ongoing  ZUMA-2  trial  on  order  to  allow  a  more  comprehensive  evaluation  of  the 
results of pivotal Cohort 1 in the ZUMA-2 study. 
There is no safety data for use in pregnant and lactating women, in patients with important comorbidity like 
renal and hepatic impairment or for use in patients with cardiovascular disease and in immunocompromised 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/588798/2020 
Page 123/131 
 
  
  
 
patients (patients with history of HIV infection, patients with primary immunodeficiency or patients with history 
of autoimmune disease). There is no safety data for subjects with history of CNS lymphoma, brain metastases 
or history of CNS disorders. The above is reflected in the SmPC. 
Based on the submitted data the neurological events are generally reversible, though in a few cases there have 
been  lingering  minor  symptoms.  Longer  term  follow-up  will  be  helpful  in  addressing  if  neurological  adverse 
reactions  are  fully  reversible  or  if  there  are  long-term  sequelae.  Similarly,  aspects  regarding  secondary 
malignancies, replication competent retrovirus analysis will be appropriately assessed in the follow-up study.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma remains a major cause of morbidity since patients have either 
limited or have exhausted treatment options. As such, this patient population has a clear unmet medical need 
for novel therapies.  
In Cohort 1, the target dose of 2 x 106 cells/kg demonstrated an ORR of 85% where the lower confidence interval 
of 75% was significantly higher than the historical control rate of 25% at a one-sided significance level of 0.025 
(p<0.001). While ORR is reflective of activity of the medicinal product it carries no clinical relevance by itself. 
However,  achieving  CR  i.e.  the  disappearance  of  all  measurable  evidence  of  disease  is  on  the  other  hand 
considered  relevant  for  the  patient  and  therefore  indicative  of  a  relevant  favourable  effect.  The  majority  of 
responders (40/56 subjects in the inferential analyses set) achieved a CR, for which durable remissions were 
observed (median DOR NR, 95% CI: 13.6, NE, vs DOR in all responders of NR (95% CI: 8.6, NE)). This duration 
of  response  compares  favourably  to  the  DOR  reported  in  the  historical  cohort.  Achieving  relevant  CR  in 
conjunction with a relevant duration of response is considered clinically meaningful and relevant for the patient 
and therefore important for decision making in the context of a single arm trial.  
While surrogacy of achieving sustained remission for OS in CAR T cell therapy is some indication that patients 
may achieve cure or at least long-term remission, follow-up duration is currently too short to conclude on this 
issue.  
Results from secondary endpoints are consistent with the primary endpoint, with median PFS and OS not being 
reached. Again, this compares favourably to that reported in the literature and indicates the high response rates 
may translate into a survival benefit. 
The main uncertainties regarding the benefit/risk assessment relate to the non-comparative nature of the data, 
the limited sample size and the short duration of follow up.

Although a historical control group was used to determine the ORR cut-off, there are uncertainties surrounding 
the way the historical controls were selected and the representativeness of the historic ORR for the ZUMA-2 
study population. Furthermore, the ZUMA-2 study had numerous amendments and interim analyses, and these 
may have affected the integrity of the study to a certain extent. However, considering the compelling efficacy 
estimates for KTE-X19, it is not expected they will significantly impact the benefit/risk balance.  
All subjects in the ZUMA-2 study received BTK inhibitors. This was also an inclusion criterion in the historical 
cohort.  The  benefit  of  KTE-X19  in  patients  that  have  not  received  BTK  inhibitors  is  therefore  unknown. The 
indication has been worded to reflect the study population.  
The  safety  profile  of  KTE-X19  was  mostly  consistent  with  that  reported  for  other  CAR-T  products.  The 
unfavourable  effects  primarily  are  cytokine  release  syndrome,  CART-related  encephalopathy  syndrome, 
infections  and  tumour  lysis  syndrome.  Cytokine  release  syndrome  (CRS)  was  observed  in  the  majority  of 
subjects (91%) and in subjects >65 years of age, there was a trend towards a higher incidence of worst Grade 
3 CRS. Furthermore, in subjects >65 years there was also a worst Grade 3 or higher neurological events, and 
worst Grade 3 or higher infections. These unfavourable effects are characteristic to the product class and are 
considered reversible and manageable with appropriate precautions and treatments. The unfavourable effects 
are  in  line  with  the  experience  with  this  product  class.  However,  the  short  duration  of  follow-up  raises  an 
uncertainty whether long-term effects are fully reversible, particularly regarding neurological events and needs 
to be followed up. 
The uncertainties and limitation reported above will be captured by the commitments imposed in the frame of 
the long term follow up study (In order to further characterise the long-term efficacy and safety of Tecartus in 
adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) the MAH shall conduct and submit the 
results of a prospective study based on data from a registry, according to an agreed protocol) and the specific 
obligation imposed as per the conditional marketing authorisation (see section 3.7.3). 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The overall benefit/risk balance of KTE-X19 for the treatment of r/r MCL in patients which had received more 
than 2 prior therapy regimens including BTK inhibitors is favourable. The benefits for this heavily pre-treated 
patient  population  outweighs  the  unfavourable  effects  and  risks  which  may  be  addressed  by  adequate  risk 
mitigation  measures  in  the  RMP.  The  clinical  data  are  regarded  to  be  not  comprehensive  due  to  the 
uncertainties, not yet addressed by the available data, arising from the short follow-up duration and the limited 
sample  size  in  view  of  the  non-comparative  data.  As  the  benefit  of  the  immediate  availability  of  the  ATMP 
outweighs the risks associated with the given uncertainties, there is agreement on granting of a conditional MA 
(see below). 
To summarise, the following issues remain: 
- Small population of treated patients (n=68)  
- Limited proportion of women (n=14)  
- Possibility of differences in efficacy and safety with regard to gender, age and severely diseased patients. 
- Missing results on long-term efficacy and safety 
- Possible age and gender differences in the pharmacology of KTE-X19 and lack of analyses on population 
pharmacokinetics

The applicant agrees to provide additional at least 24-months long-term efficacy and safety data for the full 
analysis set treated patients in the ongoing ZUMA-2 trial post-authorisation. This is considered an acceptable 
approach to complete the clinical data and allow a more comprehensive evaluation of the positive benefit-risk 
balance.  
The post-authorisation measurements and obligations within a registry in the scope of a granted conditional 
approval are deemed adequate to provide information and results concerning the remaining uncertainties on 
efficacy and safety of the product as described above. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was proposed by 
the CAT/CHMP during the assessment, after having consulted the applicant who requested consideration for its 
application for a conditional marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 14-a of the above mentioned 
Regulation. 
The  product  falls  within  the  scope  of  Article  14-a  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  concerning  conditional 
marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease.  
Furthermore,  the  CAT/CHMP  considers  that  the  product  fulfils  the  requirements  for  a  conditional  marketing 
authorisation, as follows: 
•  The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
• 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data:  
• 
Long-term follow-up data from ZUMA-2: In order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of 
Tecartus  in  adult  patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  MCL  the  MAH  shall  submit  the  24 months 
follow-up data from all treated patients in cohort 1 of the pivotal study ZUMA-2. Expected date for 
submission of the final data is 31 March 2022 
•  A registry-based study: In order to confirm the long-term efficacy and safety of Tecartus in adult 
patients with relapsed or refractory MCL and the Benefit/Risk balance in the female, elderly and 
severely diseased patients, the MAH shall submit the results of a prospective study investigating 
efficacy  and  safety  based  on  data  from  the  same  registry  used  to  characterise  the  long-term 
efficacy and safety of Tecartus, according to an agreed protocol. Expected date for submission of 
the final data is 30 September 2025.  
These  post  authorisation  studies  will  provide  longer  term  data  as  well  as  further  efficacy  and  safety 
information on important subgroups (elderly, females, patients with severe disease) which are not fully 
represented in the pivotal study submitted for this procedure. The provision of this data post authorisation 
will complement the dossier in order have a comprehensive understanding of efficacy and safety and to 
confirm the positive benefit risk balance of the product. 
•  An  unmet  medical  need  will  be  addressed,  as  an  additional  and  novel  therapeutic  option  is  given  for 
patients  with  r/r  MCL  after  having  received  at  least  two  prior  lines  of  systemic  therapy  including  a 
BTK-inhibitor. Patients with mantle cell lymphoma who are refractory or who relapsed after two or more 
lines of approved systemic therapy including Bruton’s kinase inhibitors have an overall poor prognosis as 
few authorised treatment options with established efficacy and safety remain. Usually, these patients are

treated by therapy regimens or modifications thereof, they have already received and on which they have 
relapsed at some point. Tecartus provides a treatment option for which a clinically meaningful benefit was 
demonstrated with respect to complete response, overall response rate and duration of response. Thus, 
the availability of Tecartus represents a major therapeutic advantage vis-à-vis existing treatments. 
•  The  benefits  to  public  health  of  the  immediate  availability  outweigh  the  risks  inherent  to  the  fact  that 
additional data are still required. As benefit-risk balance on basis of the current data is regarded positive, 
an  additional  therapy  option  for  Mantle  cell  lymphoma  patients  with  two  or  more  previous  systemic 
therapies is considered beneficial. 
In addition, the CAT considers the following measures necessary to ensure the follow up of safety and efficacy: 
In order to further characterise the long-term efficacy and safety of Tecartus in adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory Mantle cell Lymphoma (MCL) the MAH shall conduct and submit the results of a prospective study 
based on data from a registry, according to an agreed protocol. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Tecartus is positive, subject to the specific obligations and conditions imposed in order to 
obtain further clinical data to generate a comprehensive clinical data set and inform the long-term efficacy and 
safety profile of the product.  
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on Benefit Risk balance as described above 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CAT by consensus is of the opinion that Tecartus is not similar to Imbruvica within the meaning of Article 3 
of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appended similarity report. 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  CAT  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CAT  considers  by  consensus  that  the 
benefit- risk balance of Tecartus is favourable in the following indication: 
Tecartus is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) 
after two or more lines of systemic therapy including a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. 
The CAT therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Based on the draft CHMP opinion adopted by the CAT and the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the 
CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Tecartus in the treatment of adult patients with 
relapsed  or  refractory  mantle  cell  lymphoma  (MCL)  after  two  or  more  lines  of  systemic  therapy  including  a 
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the conditional

important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Key elements: 
Availability of tocilizumab and site qualification 
To minimise the risks associated with the treatment of Tecartus, the MAH must ensure that hospitals and their 
associated  centres  that  dispense  Tecartus  are  specially  qualified  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  controlled 
distribution program. 
CHMP assessment report

The MAH must ensure on-site, immediate access to at least 1 dose of tocilizumab for each patient as cytokine 
release  syndrome  (CRS)  management  medication  prior  to  treating  patients.  Hospitals  and  their  associated 
centres should have access to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of each previous dose. 
Tecartus will only be supplied to hospitals and associated centres that are qualified and only if the healthcare 
professionals (HCP) involved in the treatment of a patient have completed the educational program. 
Educational program – Prior to the launch of Tecartus in each Member State the MAH must agree the content 
and format of the educational materials with the National Competent Authority. 
HCP Educational program 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Tecartus is marketed, all HCPs who are expected to 
prescribe, dispense, and administer Tecartus shall be provided with a guidance document to: 
provide  information  about  the  safety  and  efficacy  long-term  follow  up  study  and  the  importance  of 
contributing to such a study 
facilitate identification of CRS and serious neurologic adverse reactions 
facilitate management of the CRS and serious neurologic adverse reactions 
ensure adequate monitoring of CRS and serious neurologic adverse reactions 
facilitate provision of all relevant information to patients 
ensure that adverse reactions are adequately and appropriately reported 
ensure that detailed instructions about the thawing procedure are provided 
before treating a patient, ensure that at least 1 dose of tocilizumab for each patient is available on site. 
The qualified treatment centre must have access to additional doses of tocilizumab within 8 hours 
Patient Educational program 
To inform and explain to patients: 
the risks of CRS and serious neurologic adverse reactions, associated with Tecartus 
the need to report the symptoms to their treating doctor immediately 
the need to remain in the proximity of the location where Tecartus was received for at least 4 weeks 
following Tecartus infusion 
the need to carry the patient alert card at all times

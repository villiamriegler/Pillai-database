1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008,  Amicus Therapeutics Europe 
Limited submitted  to the European Medicines Agency on 29 July 2021 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed:

To update sections 4.8,  5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC based on final results from study AT1001-020  listed 
as category 3 in the RMP. Study AT1001-020-is  a Phase 3b, 2-stage, open-label, uncontrolled, 
multicentre study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and efficacy of 
migalastat treatment in  paediatric subjects 12 to < 18  years of age and weighing  ≥ 45 kg with Fabry 
disease and with  amenable GLA variants. The updated RMP version 7.0 has also been submitted.  
The final results of study AT1001-020,  which is involving paediatric patients  are submitted  in this 
procedure to fulfil Article 46 of Regulation 1901/2006,  as amended. 
In addition, the MAH  took the opportunity to introduce some minor editorial changes to  the SmPC and 
Package Leaflet and bring the PI in line with  the latest QRD template  v. 10.2. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet and to the  Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The study design for study AT1001-020  was fully described in  the recent approved variation to extend 
the authorised indication with  a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease (α-galactosidase A deficiency) 
and who have an amenable mutation  to adolescents 12 to  < 16 years (EMEA/H/C/004059/II/29)  . 
Stage 1 of this  study (PK, PK modelling) in 9 paediatric patients was the basis for approving the 
expansion of the indication to  include paediatric patients aged 12 years and over. Stage 2 of the study 
describing the efficacy and safety in this population  was requested as an commitment. These results 
are submitted  for review in  the present application.  
The applicant presented the study results based on the  overall patients included in this study. The 
study report comprise the results of 22  paediatric patients aged 12 to <18  years of age. Fifteen 
patients were aged 12 to  <16 years. During the procedure, additional subgroup analyses of the data 
between patients aged 12 to <16  years and ≥16  to < 18 years were requested.  
Based on the data it can be concluded that  when treated conform the approved posology the data 
indicates that  the paediatric patients  (12 to <18  years of age; n=22) over the 1-year study period 
had: a stable renal function, a stable left ventricular mass index (LVMi),  and a stable Plasma 
Globotriaosylsphingosine levels. Data in  patients 12 to <16  years showed similar improvements as in 
the patients  over 16 years of age. Given the limited  number of patients included and the short 
treatment period of 12  months no firm conclusions can be drawn, but  the results are indicative that 
under treatment the disease stabilises. Further, the  results are in line with  the results of the  initial 
clinical studies in adolescents (aged 16 to <18  years) and adults.  Results were similar for male and 
female subjects and for subjects who were previously ERT-experienced and ERT-naïve. With respect to 
the safety profile this is in line with  the safety profile already known for migalastat.  
The proposed SmPC updates of sections 4.8,  5.1 and 5.2 are acceptable:

Section 4.8 
Adolescent population 
The safety assessment in 21  adolescents (12 to <18  years of age and weighing  ≥ 45 kg) is based on 
1-year safety data from the open label AT1001-020  trial in which  subjects received the same dosage 
regimen as adults (see section 5.2).  No age-specific differences in adverse reactions were observed 
between adolescent and adult subjects. The frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in 
adolescents are expected to  be the  same as in adults  based on these data. 
Section 5.1 
Paediatric population 
In Study AT1001-020,  a 1-year, Phase 3b, open-label, uncontrolled, multicentre  study, the safety, PK, 
pharmacodynamic (PD), and efficacy of migalastat treatment was evaluated in 21 adolescent subjects 
(12 to  < 18 years of age and weighing ≥ 45 kg) with  Fabry disease and who  have amenable mutations 
of the gene encoding α-galactosidase A (GLA). Subjects were either naïve to enzyme replacement 
therapy (ERT) or had stopped ERT at least 14  days before screening. The mean number of years since 
diagnosis of Fabry disease was 10.2 (± 4.12)  years.  
At 1 year, the efficacy results in adolescents on the same dosing regimen as adults  were consistent in 
renal, cardiac, and pharmacodynamic results as well as responses to patient-reported outcomes. The 
overall mean (SD) change from baseline in eGFR was -1.6 (15.4)  mL/min/1.73  m2 (n=19).  The overall 
mean (SD) change from baseline for LVMi was -3.9  (13.5) g/m2 (n=18).  LVMi  decreased in 10 
subjects and increased in 8 subjects, but  all subjects remained within  normal limits  at 12 months. 
Baseline plasma lyso-Gb3 was 12.00 ng/mL  and the  overall mean (SD) change from baseline in plasma 
lyso-Gb3 was -0.06  (32.9) (n=19).  A reduction in plasma lyso-Gb3 from baseline was observed in 
ERT-naïve subjects (median -2.23 ng/ml,  n=9) and levels remained generally stable in ERT-
experienced subjects (median 0.54 ng/ml, n=10).  There were no notable changes in patient  reported 
outcomes. 
Section 5.2 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of migalastat were characterised in 20 adolescent subjects (12 to <  18 years 
and weighing ≥45  kg) with  Fabry disease who received the same dosage regimen as adults (123 mg 
migalastat capsule every other day) in an open label phase 3b trial (AT1001-020). 
Assessment of bioequivalence of exposure was simulated in adolescent subjects (12 to < 18  years) 
weighing ≥ 45  kg and receiving migalastat 123  mg once every other day compared to adults receiving 
the same dosing regimen. Model derived AUCtau in adolescent subjects (12 to <  18 years) were 
similar to adult exposures. 
The benefit-risk balance of Galafold, remains positive.

5.  Introduction 
The study design of study AT1001-020  was fully described in the recent approved variation (II/029; 
Rapporteurs’ final AR circulated on 23 June 2021).  Stage 1 of this study (PK, PK modelling) was the 
basis for approving the  expansion of the  indication to include paediatric patients aged 12  years and 
over in the indication  (see FVAR II/029).  
Stage 2 of the  study describing the efficacy and safety in this  population was requested as a 
commitment and is now submitted  for review. With  these final study results the MAH proposes to 
update sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2  of the  SmPC. 
Results 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol AT1001-020  dated 20 Feb 2018  was amended 4 times. The first 2 patients were 
enrolled under Amendment 1. The remainder of the patients  were enrolled under Amendment 4.

Medical History 
The most common system organ classes for medical history in the safety population  were nervous 
system disorders (81.0 %), gastrointestinal  disorders (76.2%), general disorders and administration 
site conditions (71.4%),  skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (66.7%),  ear and labyrinth disorders 
(57.1%),  investigations (57.1%),  and psychiatric disorders (52.4%).  The most common medical 
history preferred terms (reported by over 50% of the subjects) were diarrhoea, abdominal pain, 
tinnitus,  headache, paraesthesia, and hypohidrosis, which  are generally consistent with  Fabry disease. 
Prior and Concomitant Medications 
All but 1 subject reported prior use of medications. The most common previous medications were 
paracetamol taken by 11 subjects (52.4%)  and ibuprofen taken by 8 subjects (38.1%). 
The most frequently used concomitant medication was paracetamol taken by 15 (71.4 %) subjects.  
Rapporteur’s comments 
Fifteen (15)  patients aged 12 to <16  years were included in this study. The PDCO agreed that  patients 
<18 years of age could be included as well in  the study. Seven patients aged 16 to <18 years of age 
were included. This is agreed with   
Numbers analysed 
All efficacy evaluations were done in the ITT population. One of 22 patients dropped out prior dosing. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
Given that  the expansion of the indication  pertains to paediatric patients aged 12 years to <16 years, 
the applicant is requested to  submit the efficacy and safety results for this patients group - 
acknowledging the  numbers are small and will not  allow making  firm conclusions - to  confirm that  the 
Assessment report

results are comparable to the older patients (OC).  The applicant should present the results for eGFR, 
LWMi,  Urine Protein and urine albumin, Plasma Globotriaosylsphingosine, results should be presented 
for males and females in line with  the presentation in this report and compared to the patients aged 16 
to <18  years. With respect to the safety the  applicant should compare the adverse events based on 
the age category. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Estimated Glomerular Filtration  Rate 
Estimated GFR (Table 3) was calculated using  the modified Schwartz formula for creatinine clearance 
(2009).

Rapporteur’s comments 
Overall, at Month  12 (n  = 19), the mean (SD) change from baseline was -1.6  (15.40)  mL/min x 1.73 
m2 and the mean (SD) annualized rate of change was -1.5 (15.11)  mL/min  x 1.73  m2, indicating stable 
renal function  over the 1-year study period. Results were similar for male and female subjects and for 
subjects who were previously ERT-experienced and ERT-naïve.

initial  increase in proteinuria in male subjects at Month  3 was driven by 1 subject (2308-5147)  who 
had a spike in urine protein at Month  1 and Month  3. This subject had a history of Fabry-related 
microalbuminuria and Fabry-related proteinuria since 2019 and was taking pregabalin until  2 months 
before entering the study, which  is eliminated primarily by renal excretion. Concurrently, this  subject 
had upper and lower respiratory tract infections at these 2 time points, respectively. 
Results were similar for subjects who were previously ERT-experienced and ERT-naïve. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
There was a mean (SD) change from baseline in urine protein at Month  6 (n = 16)  of 5.6 (86.25)  mg/L 
that  increased to 36.0 (111.61)  mg/L  at Month  12 (n = 19).  The results at month  3 are driven by a 
male subject who had a spike in urine protein. Nevertheless, the results of urine protein were 
predominately stable over the 12-month  study period. 
As with urine protein, an initial  increase in urine albumin in  male subjects at Month  3 was driven by 
the same subject (2308-5147)  who had a spike in urine albumin at Month  1 and Month  3. Other results 
of urine albumin were predominately stable over the 12-month  study period 
Results were similar for subjects who were previously ERT-experienced and ERT-naïve. 
Left Ventricular Mass Index 
Left ventricular mass index (LVMi) was assessed as a measure of cardiac impairment in  the study 
subjects. At baseline and throughout  the treatment period, all subjects had LVMi  within  normal limits 
(Listing  16.2.6.3).  Echocardiogram results were reported by both M-mode and 2D-mode imaging.  The 
M-mode is consistent with  previous migalastat studies in adults and allows for a comparative look of 
the data between adolescents and adults (and thus  only these results are shown). 
The LVMi reported by both modes were relatively stable throughout  the study. The overall mean (SD) 
change from baseline to Month  12  (n = 18) was -3.9  (13.53)  g/m2 as reported by M-mode. At Month 
12, based on M-mode female subjects (n  = 9) showed a greater decrease in mean LVMi  as compared 
to male subjects (n  = 9) (change from baseline, -7.6  [16.94]  g/m2 versus -0.2  [8.43]  g/m2, 
respectively) (Table 5). Based on M-mode,  at Month  12 ERT-experienced subjects (n = 10)  had a 
mean (SD) change from baseline of -6.8 (14.87)  g/m2 versus -0.3  (11.52) g/m2 for ERT-naïve subjects 
(n = 8).

Rapporteur’s comments 
Based on the results on LVMi it  can be concluded that this  remained fairly stable throughout  the 12 
months treatment  period. This is considered relatively short to expect large changes in LVMi,  and thus 
no firm conclusion can be drawn.

Plasma  Globotriaosylsphingosine 
The PD parameter observed in this study was plasma lyso-Gb3. There was an increase at Month  6 for 
male subjects that  resulted in  an overall mean change (SD) from baseline of 5.7  (30.72)  ng/mL at this 
timepoint  (n = 14). Results were stable at  all other collection time points.  The overall mean (SD) 
change from baseline to Month  12  (n = 19) was -0.1  (32.89)  ng/mL.

Overall.
Lyso-Gb3 = Globotriaosylsphingosine; ET = Early Termination. 
[1] Baseline is defined as the last non-missing assessment prior to the first dose of study drug. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
Based on the overall results it can be concluded that  treatment kept lyso-Gb3 at a stable level. Given 
the limited  number of patients no firm conclusion can be drawn, especially as the results are driven by 
the 10 male patients who had higher baseline values. It is known that  male Fabry patients  have higher 
baseline values. 
Patient Reported Outcomes 
Patient reported outcomes (PROs) were assessed by subject responses in the subject e-diary 
(comprised of the FABPRO and BSS), PGI-C, FPHPQ, and PedsQL questionnaires. In general over the 
12-month  study period, there were small or no changes in the FABPRO-GI and pain scores and in 
patient-reported outcomes of FPHPQ,  PGI-C, or PedsQL. Only the results of the  PGI-C are presented 
here as the results of the measures pointed in the same direction. 
Patient’s Global Impression of Change 
Diarrhoea 
Overall, at Month  12 (n  = 19), the subjects’ perception of improvement was favourable with  12 
(54.5%)  subjects indicating an improvement in their diarrhoea and 7 (31.8%)  subjects indicating no 
change. No subjects reported a worsening of diarrhoea. 
Overall Pain 
Assessment report  
EMA/123203/2022 
Page 14/28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At Month  12 (n =  19), 10 subjects (45.5%)  indicated an improvement in their overall pain and 8 
subjects (36.4%)  indicated no change. One subject (4.5%)  reported a worsening of pain. The overall 
mean (SD) improvement was 2.9 (1.29).  Female subjects (n  = 9) reported slightly  less improvement 
(3.3 [1.00])  than  male subjects (n = 10;  2.5 [1.43]). 
Tummy Pain 
At Month  12 (n =  19), 10 subjects (45.5%)  indicated an improvement in their overall tummy pain and 
8 subjects (36.4%)  indicated no change. One subject (4.5%) reported a worsening of tummy pain. The 
overall mean (SD) improvement at Month  12 was 3.0  (1.25). Consistent  with the  FABPRO-GI tummy 
pain results, the subject reporting a worsening of tummy pain was female. Subjects who were ERT-
naïve (n =  9) prior to  the study reported slightly better tummy pain results than  subjects who were 
ERT-experienced (n =  10). At Month  12, ERT-experienced subjects reported tummy pain improvement 
as 3.4 (1.07)  versus 2.6 (1.33)  for ERT-naïve subjects. 
Daily Living 
At Month  12 (n =  19), 10 subjects (45.5%)  indicated an improvement in their overall activities of daily 
living (e.g. eating, sleeping, school attendance, playing) and 8 subjects (36.4%) indicated no change. 
One subject (4.5%)  reported a worsening of daily activity. The overall mean (SD) improvement at 
Month  12 was 3.0 (1.20).  Female subjects (n  = 9) reported slightly  less improvement (3.3  [1.00]) 
than male subjects (n = 10; 2.7  [1.34]). 
Rapporteur’s comments 
Over the 12-month  study period, there were small or no changes in the  FABPRO-GI and pain scores 
and in patient-reported outcomes of FPHPQ,  PGI-C, or PedsQL Based on the PGI-C patients reported 
improvement in diarrhoea, modest improvement in pain severity score and overall pain. This may be 
due to the relatively young patient group where disease progression has not too advanced.

Rapporteur’s comments 
Most  subjects reported mild  TEAEs. Five subjects reported 13 moderate TEAEs and 3 severe TEAEs 
were reported by 2 subjects. Severe events of paraesthesia and H1N1  influenza were reported by 1 
subject and 1 subject reported severe depression. None of the severe events were attributed  to study 
drug by the investigator and no action was taken with the  study drug. This seems plausible. 
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events by Relationship to Study Drug 
Five subjects reported TEAEs that  were considered either possibly, probably, or definitely related to 
study drug by the investigator. Table 10 displays all related TEAEs by SOC and PT. All events resolved.

Rapporteur’s comments 
Eleven events of potential drug related TEAEs were reported in 5 subjects. Based on the  listing these 
were reported in 2 patients aged 16 years and 2  patient aged 15 years and 1 patient  aged 14  years. 
The applicant is requested to include the AES Alanine aminotransferase increased, Aspartate 
aminotransferase increased and Blood lactate dehydrogenase increased as these are currently not 
included in SmPC section 4.8  (OC). 
Serious adverse  event/deaths/other  significant events 
No deaths were reported in the safety Population. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
One female subject in the safety population experienced an SAE.  
Rapporteur’s comments 
One event of SAE was reported (e.g. suicidal ideation) due to worsening depression. The event was not 
considered related to  study drug by the investigator. This conclusion can be agreed with. 
Safety  related  to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Discontinuation due to adverse  events 
There were no patients  in the safety population who discontinued due to an adverse event. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
No comments. 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluation 
Haematology 
Haematology parameters remained stable throughout  the study period with  mean changes fluctuating 
within  normal limits.  Results were similar for male and female subjects as well as subjects who were 
ERT-naïve and ERT-experienced prior to the study.  
Shifts from Baseline 
Shifts from baseline in haematology parameters were rare with  a total of 6 reports of excursions from 
normal at  baseline to high at  Month 12  occurred in eosinophils, erythrocytes, monocytes, and

neutrophils. There were 2 shifts from normal at baseline to low at Month  12 in leukocytes and 
lymphocytes. A total of 12 shifts  occurred from either low or high  at baseline to normal at Month  12. 
Results were similar for male and female subjects and subjects who previously were ERT-naïve or ERT-
experienced. 
Potentially Clinically Significant Results 
Abnormal, potentially clinically significant (PCS) results were reported for 2 subjects (2001-5114  and 
2308-5146)  who had low leukocyte counts  at Month  12. A low leukocyte count was also reported at 
baseline for Subject 2308-5146  and at Month  6 for Subject 2001-5115.  Abnormal, PCS erythrocytes 
were reported for Subject 2001-5114  at Month  6 and for Subject 2308-5148  at baseline. 
Serum Chemistry 
There were no significant  mean changes from baseline to  Month  12 for any chemistry analyte. Results 
were similar for male and female subjects as well as subjects who  were ERT-naïve and ERT-
experienced prior to the study. 
Shifts from Baseline 
Shifts from baseline in chemistry analytes were infrequent. A total of 16 reports of excursions from 
normal at  baseline to high at  Month 12  occurred in alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, 
creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), phosphate, potassium, sodium, and urate. There was 1 shift 
from normal at baseline to  low at Month  12 in creatinine. A total of 21 shifts occurred from either low 
or high at baseline to  normal at Month  12. 
Results were similar for male and female subjects and subjects who previously were ERT-naïve or ERT-
experienced . 
Potentially Clinically Significant Results 
Abnormal, PCS results occurred sporadically throughout  the study at various time points  and were 
related to  pre-existing conditions including  Fabry disease or represent acute medical conditions.  At 
Month  12, PCS results were reported for 2 subjects who had high  gamma glutamyl transferase at 
multiple study visits in  addition to Month  12, 1 subject who had high  LDH at Month  12, and 1 subject 
who had high phosphate at Month  12. Given the random occurrence of these excursions in laboratory 
values, which  occurred at all time points during the study including  baseline, these are not considered 
clinically meaningful outside of their association with  Fabry disease and the subjects’ baseline disease 
status. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
Haematology parameters remained stable throughout  the study period with  mean changes fluctuating 
within  normal limits.  There were no significant mean changes from baseline to  Month  12 for any 
chemistry analyte. 
Results were similar for male and female subjects as well as subjects who were ERT-naïve and ERT-
experienced prior to the study.

Vital signs remained stable throughout  the study period with  normal fluctuations.  The results were 
similar for male and female subjects as well as subjects who previously were ERT-naïve or ERT-
experienced. 
Potentially clinically significant measurements were seen sporadically in diastolic blood pressure, 
systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and weight. It should be noted that  all of the  PCS weight changes 
observed at Month  12 involved weight gains, which  may be expected in an adolescent population. 
There was a PCS weight loss reported for 1 subject (2001-5114)  at all postbaseline interim study 
visits, which was not seen by Month  12. 
Results were similar for male and female subjects and for subjects who  previously were ERT-naïve or 
ERT-experienced. 
Electrocardiograms 
There were no significant  changes in ECGs throughout  the study period with  similar results seen for 
male and female subjects and for subjects who previously were ERT-naïve or ERT-experienced. There 
were no PCS findings either overall or for any of the subgroups. 
Physical Examinations 
Complete physical examinations were conducted at  screening, baseline, and Months  3, 6, and 12.  Brief 
physical exams were conducted at intervening visits between Days 15 and 30 and at Months  1 and 9. 
Overall, physical findings  were nonremarkable with few findings noted. Results were similar for male 
and female subjects and for subjects who previously were ERT-naïve or ERT-experienced. 
Clinically significant findings were noted sporadically throughout the study with  most observations 
related to  acute illnesses (i.e. wheezing, pharyngeal erythema, rhinitis,  etc).  
Tanner Staging 
There were no remarkable changes in sexual maturation  throughout the  study. Results were similar for 
male and female subjects and for subjects who previously were ERT-naïve or ERT-experienced.

6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted  an updated RMP (version 7.0) with  this  application.  
The amendments mainly concern inclusion of AT1001-020  final data and changes relevant to study 
completion. Furthermore, the Applicant has taken this  regulatory opportunity to update the  due dates 
for completion and provision of the final study report for category 3  study AT1001-030 (A Prospective, 
Observational Registry of Patients with  Fabry Disease) in the  RMP.  
The proposed RMP changes were  the following: 
• 
To include AT1001-020 final data and changes relevant to study completion.

8.1.  Major objections 
N/A 
8.2.  Other concerns 
1.  The applicant presented the study results based on the  overall patients included. However, 
given that the expansion of the indication  pertains to paediatric patients  aged 12 years to <16 
years, the applicant is requested to  submit the efficacy and safety results for this  patients 
group - acknowledging the numbers are small and will not allow making firm conclusions - to 
confirm that the results are comparable to the  older patients. The applicant should present the 
results for eGFR, LWMi,  Urine Protein and urine albumin,  Plasma Globotriaosylsphingosine; 
results should be presented for males and females in  line with the  presentation in this  report 
and compared to the patients aged 16 to <18  years. With respect to the safety, the applicant 
should compare the adverse events based on the age category (e.g. 12 -<16  and 16  to <18 
years of age). 
2.  The applicant is requested to include the AES Alanine aminotransferase increased, Aspartate 
aminotransferase increased and Blood lactate dehydrogenase increased as these are currently 
not included in SmPC section 4.8. 
3.  The applicant is requested to update the SmPC section 5.1  in line with  CHMP Rapporteur’s 
comments.

Summary of Applicant’s response 
A total of 22 subjects aged 12  to <18 years were enrolled in Study AT1001-020 and 21 subjects took 
at least 1 dose of study drug (safety population).  Of these, 15 subjects were aged 12  to < 16 years 
and 7 subjects were aged 16  to < 18 years (Table 11).

Fifty  treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were observed in 14 subjects for the 12 to < 16  years age subgroup; and 39 TEAEs across 7  subjects for 
the 16 to  < 18 years age subgroup. The most frequently reported TEAE in  the 12 to < 16  years age subgroup was upper respiratory tract infection (35.7%), 
followed by influenza, nasopharyngitis, back pain, headaches, and rash (14.3%  each) (Table 13).

Five subjects reported TEAEs that  were considered either possibly, probably, or definitely related to 
study drug by the investigator. Of these events, 3 events were in 3 subjects aged 12 to <  16 years 
(pain in extremity, headache, and drug eruption)  and 8  events were in  2 subjects aged 16 to < 18 
years (1 subject reporting events of abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, and paraesthesia, and 1 
subject reporting concurrent events of alanine aminotransferase [ALT] increased, aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST] increased, blood creatinine phosphokinase [CPK] increased, blood lactate 
dehydrogenase [LDH] increased, headache) (Module 2.5,  Appendix 1, Table 14.3.1.4  and Appendix 2, 
Table 14.3.1.4). 
Most  subjects reported mild  TEAEs and there were no treatment-related serious AEs in either age 
group. The data appears to be comparable to the older population.

Note: Adverse events were coded using  MedDRA version 21.0. 
Note: Treatment-emergent adverse events included adverse events that began after the first dose of study  drug 
until 
30 days after the last dose. Subjects  were counted only once within each system organ  class (SOC) and preferred 
term (PT). TEAEs are presented  alphabetically by SOC and PT. 
Note: Percentages were based on the number of subjects  in the safety population. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
As requested the applicant submitted  the subgroup analyses on the efficacy data. As expected the 
numbers are very small. So no firm conclusions can be drawn. Of the 15  children aged 12 to <16 
years, 8 were treatment  naïve. Data on eGRF indicates that  in both the treatment  naïve as the  ERT 
experienced group similar result in reduction were obtained after 12 month of treatment; treatment 
naïve change from baseline (mean, SD) -3.2 (15.5),  ERT-experienced -7.7 (10.2) mL/min.  For left 
ventricular mass index (LVMi),  urine protein, urine albumin, and plasma globotriaosylsphinogosine 
(lyso-Gb3) also small changes from baseline to EOT were observed. These are indicative for 
stabilisation. Results between the patients  12 to <16  years are in line with the  results of the patients 
≥16 to  <18 years of age, and to patients  over 18 years of age.  
For patients aged 12 to <16  years, the most frequently reported SOCs (i.e., 20% of the subjects or 
more) were infections and infestation (64.3%),  nervous systems disorder (28.6%),  musculoskeletal 
and connective tissue disorders, respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, and skin and 
subcutaneous disorders (21.4% each). The most frequently reported TEAE was upper respiratory tract 
infection (35.7%),  followed by influenza, nasopharyngitis, back pain, headaches, and rash (14.3% 
each).  
For patients aged 16 to <18  years, the most frequently reported SOCs (i.e., 20% of the subjects or 
more) were infections and infestations (100%),  and gastrointestinal  disorders (42.9%).  The most 
frequently reported TEAE was pharyngitis streptococcal (28.6%). All other TEAEs were reported in  1 
subject only. 
Conclusion: Issue resolved 
2. 
The applicant is requested to include the AES Alanine aminotransferase increased, Aspartate 
aminotransferase increased and Blood lactate dehydrogenase increased as these are currently not 
included in SmPC section 4.8. 
Summary of Applicant’s response 
The TEAEs of ALT increased, AST increased, and blood LDH increased were reported in  a single 
subject. The Applicant considers that the  enzyme elevations may have been a sequelae of the 
concurrent ear infection and resultant tissue damage, rather than causally related to Galafold 
exposure.  
In order to determine if such enzyme elevations have been observed previously following exposure to 
Galafold, the Applicant conducted a broader search of the global safety database to assess any similar 
cases retrieved by using  the high level term (HLT)  of ‘Liver function  analyses,’ ‘Hepatic enzymes and 
function abnormalities,’ and ‘Tissue enzyme analyses NEC’  (including all blood lactate dehydrogenase 
preferred term (PT)/low level terms (LLT)  followed by filtering for relevant cases representative of 
ALT/AST and LDH elevation. Four (4) non-serious reports of abnormal liver function  enzymes were 
retrieved during this search. Two (2)  cases from HLT  of ‘Liver function  analyses’ and 3 cases from HLT 
of ‘Tissue enzyme analyses’ were excluded from this table as the events were not related to the topic 
in discussion. The HLT of ‘Hepatic enzymes and function abnormalities’ didn’t retrieve any cases. No 
other reports of abnormal blood LDH results were identified.

Rapporteur’s comments 
The applicant elaborate that  the TEAEs of ALT increased, AST increased, and blood LDH increased were 
reported in a single subject who experienced the AEs of elevation of ALT, AST, CPK, and LDH  on the 
same day, approximately 3 months  after starting  treatment with  Galafold. These events were all mild 
in nature and the subject recovered from them 22 days after the day of event onset. No action was 
taken towards Galafold treatment. Four (4) non-serious reports of abnormal liver function enzymes 
were retrieved when these events were investigated in the applicant data. No other reports of 
abnormal blood LDH results were identified. 
Based on these cases, the applicant did not include AES Alanine aminotransferase increased, Aspartate 
aminotransferase increased and Blood lactate dehydrogenase increased which is considered agreed 
with. 
Conclusion: Issue resolved 
3.  The applicant is requested to update the SmPC section 5.1  in line with  CHMP Rapporteur’s 
comments. 
Summary of Applicant’s response 
The Applicant agrees to add the  following text to Section 5.1 in the  paediatric population subsection of 
the SmPC. The updated SmPC is provided with  this  response. 
At 1 year, the efficacy results in adolescents on the same dosing regimen as adults  were consistent in 
renal, cardiac, and pharmacodynamic results as well as responses to patient-reported outcomes. 
Rapporteur’s comments 
The Applicant updated SmPC section 5.1 as requested, see also attached SmPC.

1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

The dataset contained in this registry did not allow to 
submission of the final report following CHMP 
conclusions on the related postauthorisation measure 
(MEA 57.12) from the Fabry registry, a global, 
observational and voluntary program designed to 
collect uniform and meaningful clinical data related 
to the onset, progression, and treated course of 
patients with Fabry disease . This is a long term 
effectiveness study to enhance the understanding of 
long-term severe events and clinical continuous 
outcomes of Fabrazyme among 5 subgroups 
identified by modified Arends criteria, estimate the 
disease progression after Fabrazyme treatment 
among Classic male patients with sustained anti-
confirm the relevant clinical benefits expected in long term 
treatment with Fabrazyme. However, information relevant 
to the prescribers were added regarding the observed 
relationship between the incidence rate of the composite of 
severe clinical events and the peak of drug antibodies 
concentration.

SmPC and PL 
After reviewing the observational published data, the CHMP 
to change posology recommendations in adults, 
children and adolescents aged 8 years and older by 
removing the information on the lower dosing 
regimens that have been used in clinical studies and 
update the clinical information based on the review 
of published scientific literature including two 
observational studies in patients remaining on 
standard dose of Fabrazyme or switching to lower 
dose regimens. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to propose changes in the Product 
Information according to the QRD templates and 
current guidelines, including new warnings related to 
sodium excipient and traceability of biological 
medicinal products. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
recommended to remove the information on the lower dose 
regimen of 0.3 mg/kg every 2 weeks in the posology 
section of the SmPC. The existing information on the short 
term data of the AGAL-017-01 dose maintenance (0.3 
mg/kg every 2 weeks) study was subsequently removed  
from section 5.1 of the SmPC and replace by the long term 
data of two main observational studies in patients 
remaining on standard dose of Fabrazyme or switching to 
lower dose regimens, noting that comparison between 
different observational groups should be cautiously 
interpreted due to the study designs.

years have not yet been established. No recommendation 
and PL 
on posology can be made in children aged 5 to 7 years. No 
data are available in children 0 to 4 years. Limited 
information from clinical trials suggests that the safety 
profile of Fabrazyme treatment in paediatric patients ages 
5-7, treated with either 0.5 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 1.0 
mg/kg every 4 weeks is similar to that of patients (above 
the age of 7) treated at 1.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks.

In the CHMP 'Assessment report on the shortage of 
Fabrazyme' Overview of Shortage Period: Spontaneous 
Reports from June 2009 through 15 September 2010 and 
Registry Data from June 2009 through 05 August 2010' of 
January 2011, the CHMP requested the MAH the following: 
"The MAH should include the important safety data on long-
term low dosage use that has become available during the 
shortage of Fabrazyme in the SPC in section 5.1." 
This resulted in the addition of relevant information in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC, stating that in patients who 
initiated treatment at a Fabrazyme dose of 1 mg/kg every 
2 weeks and subsequently received a reduced dose for an 
extended period, an increase of some of the following 
symptoms such as pain, paraesthesia and diarrhoea, as 
well as cardiac, central nervous system and renal 
manifestations was spontaneously reported. These reported 
symptoms resemble the natural course of Fabry disease. 
The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. In addition, 
section 4.7 was updated in line with the adverse events and 
safety profile of the medicinal product. 
The benefit-risk ratio of the medicinal products remains 
favourable.

Section 4.8 "Undesirable effects" of the SPC has been

regimen can be drawn due to the limitations of the study 
design (small number of patients, post hoc analysis), a 
dose regimen of 0.3 mg/kg of Fabrazyme every 2 weeks for 
18 months was able to maintain the clearance of cellular 
GL-3 in the capillary endothelium of the kidney, other 
kidney cell types and skin (superficial skin capillary 
endothelium) in some patients following treatment with 1 
mg/kg of Fabrazyme every other week for 24 weeks. These 
findings suggested that, after an initial debulking dose of 
1.0 mg/kg of Fabrazyme every 2 weeks, 0.3 mg/kg of 
Fabrazyme every 2 weeks may be sufficient in some 
patients to maintain clearance of GL-3, the long term 
clinical relevance of these findings not being established.

Sections 2 and 4 of the Package Leaflet have been

clinical studies, changes in section 4.4 of the SPC to update 
the information on development of antibodies and infusion-
associated reactions (IAR) with the most recent figures.  
Results from the rechallenge study AGAL-019-01 were also 
reflected in section 4.4 of the SPC. In addition, further to 
CHMP's recommendations, the MAH updated section 4.8 of

powered to demonstrate clinical benefit, the results show

organs such as the kidney and heart in children (8-16 
years).  The CHMP concluded that the overall safety and 
efficacy profile of Fabrazyme treatment administered at 1 
mg/kg every 2 weeks in paediatric patients (8-16 years) 
was consistent with the one observed in adults. The CHMP 
considered the proposed changes to the product

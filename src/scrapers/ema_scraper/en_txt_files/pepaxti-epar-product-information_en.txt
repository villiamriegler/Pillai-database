CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Pepaxti is indicated, in combination with dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult patients with 
multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior lines of therapies, whose disease is refractory 
to at least one proteasome inhibitor, one immunomodulatory agent, and one anti-CD38 monoclonal 
antibody, and who have demonstrated disease progression on or after the last therapy. For patients 
with a prior autologous stem cell transplantation, the time to progression should be at least 3 years 
from transplantation (see section 4.4).  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Pepaxti must be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the treatment of 
multiple myeloma. 
Posology 
The recommended starting dose of Pepaxti is 40 mg on Day 1 of each 28-day treatment cycle. For 
patients with a body weight of 60 kg or less the recommended starting dose is 30 mg on Day 1 of each 
28-day cycle. It is recommended that treatment should be continued until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity (see section 5.1).  
The recommended dose of dexamethasone is 40 mg orally on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day 
treatment cycle. For patients 75 years of age and older the recommended dose of dexamethasone is 
20 mg. For additional information regarding administration of dexamethasone, see section 5.1 and the 
corresponding Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Dose modification for adverse reactions 
Pepaxti must be withheld if the neutrophil count is less than 1 × 109/L or the platelet count is less than 
50 × 109/L. 
The recommended dose reduction and dosage modifications for adverse reactions of Pepaxti are 
presented in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.

Recommended concomitant medicinal products 
Consideration should be taken if prophylactic concomitant treatment with antimicrobials should be 
administered to reduce the risk of infections (see section 4.8). 
Anti-emetic agents should be administered prior to and during the treatment with Pepaxti at the 
discretion of the physician and in accordance with local practice (see section 4.4). 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is recommended for elderly patients. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment of Pepaxti is required in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 
above 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. A dose of 30 mg is recommended in patients with eGFR 30-
45 mL/min/1.73 m2. There are insufficient data in patients with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 to 
support a dose recommendation (see section 4.4 and 5.2).  
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment of Pepaxti is required for patients with mild hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
There are insufficient data in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment to support a dose 
recommendation.

Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Pepaxti in children below 18 years of age have not been established. No 
data are available. 
Method of administration 
Pepaxti is for intravenous use. 
Pepaxti should be administered as a 30-minute infusion via a central venous access device such as a 
peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) or a tunnelled central venous catheter.  
Pepaxti must be reconstituted and diluted by a healthcare professional prior to administration. Infusion 
of the diluted solution must begin within 60 minutes of start of initial reconstitution or be placed in a 
refrigerator within 30 minutes from start of initial reconstitution. 
For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see 
section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Thrombocytopenia  
Pepaxti may cause thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia (including platelet count decreased) was 
frequently reported in clinical studies (see section 4.8). As thrombocytopenia may increase the risk for 
serious bleeding events, patients should be advised to contact a physician if signs or symptoms of 
bleeding and bruising occur. 
Platelet counts should be monitored at baseline, during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Patients 
should be monitored more frequently during the first two months of treatment. Pepaxti should not be 
administered if the platelet count is less than 50 × 109/L. Treatment should be withheld until platelet 
count is 50 × 109/L or greater (without recent transfusions) and resume treatment at one dose level 
lower. The dose and/or dose schedule should be adjusted based on signs and symptoms of bleeding 
(see section 4.2). Treating thrombocytopenia with transfusions and/or other treatments should be 
considered as clinically indicated. 
Neutropenia 
Pepaxti may cause neutropenia. Neutropenia (including neutrophil count decreased) was frequently 
reported in clinical studies (see section 4.8). As neutropenia may increase the risk for infections, 
patients should be advised to contact a physician if signs or symptoms of infection occur. 
Neutrophil count should be monitored at baseline, during treatment, and as clinically indicated. 
Patients should be monitored more frequently during the first two months of treatment. Pepaxti should 
not be administered if absolute neutrophil count is less than 1 × 109/L. Treatment should be withheld 
until absolute neutrophil count is 1 × 109/L or greater and resume treatment at one dose level lower. 
The dose and/or dose schedule should be adjusted based on signs and symptoms of infection (see 
section 4.2). Treating neutropenic patients with haematopoietic growth factors and/or prophylactic 
antimicrobials should be considered as clinically indicated (see section 4.2). 
Anaemia 
Anaemia was frequently reported in clinical studies (see section 4.8). Red blood cell counts should be 
monitored at baseline, during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Patients should be monitored more 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
frequently during the first two months of treatment. Treating anaemia with transfusions and/or 
erythropoietin should be considered as clinically indicated. 
Infections 
Pepaxti may cause infections, including Grade ≥ 3 infections such as pneumonia and upper respiratory 
tract infection (see section 4.8). Patients should be closely monitored for signs of infection. Treating 
infections with antimicrobials should be considered as clinically indicated. 
Gastrointestinal events 
Nausea and diarrhoea are very common and vomiting is common during treatment with Pepaxti (see 
section 4.8). Prophylaxis with anti-emetic agents should be considered prior to and during infusion 
with melphalan flufenamide (see section 4.2). 
Thromboembolic events 
Venous thromboembolic events have been observed in patients receiving Pepaxti in combination with 
dexamethasone (see section 4.8). Patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism, including 
prior thrombosis, should be closely monitored. A decision to take prophylactic measures should be 
made after a careful assessment of the individual patient’s underlying risk factors, including the 
occurrence of thrombocytopenia. In high-risk patients, anti-thrombotic prophylaxis can be considered. 
Mutagenicity 
Melphalan, a metabolite of melphalan flufenamide, is mutagenic in animals and chromosome 
aberrations have been observed in patients being treated with melphalan. 
Carcinogenicity 
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) 
AML and MDS have occurred in patients with multiple myeloma who have received Pepaxti (see 
section 4.8). The leukaemogenic risk must be balanced against the potential therapeutic benefit when 
considering the use of melphalan flufenamide. Patients should be monitored closely before and during 
treatment for occurrence of AML and MDS.  
Second primary malignancies (SPM) 
The use of alkylating agents has been linked to the development of a SPM and SPMs have been 
reported also after use of Pepaxti, see section 4.8. When the melphalan flufenamide metabolite 
melphalan is used in combination with lenalidomide and prednisone, and to a lesser extent in 
combination with thalidomide and prednisone, it has been linked to an increased risk of solid SPMs 
for elderly patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Melphalan flufenamide is not indicated 
in combination with lenalidomide or thalidomide. Patients should be monitored closely before and 
during treatment for occurrence of SPM. 
Prior autologous stem cell transplant 
Pepaxti is not recommended in patients who have progressed within 36 months after an ASCT (see 
section 4.1.). This is based on results from study OP-103 (OCEAN), a randomised phase 3 trial in 
patients with relapsed or refratory multiple myeloma following 2 to 4 lines of prior therapy and 
refractory to lenalidomide and the last line of therapy. Post-hoc analyses showed that patients on 
melphalan flufenamide /dexamethasone who had progressed less than 36 months after an ASCT had a 
lower survival compared to the pomalidomide/dexamethasone comparator arm, with a median OS of 
15.7 months (95% CI: 11.9, 20.5, n=101) compared to 28.7 months (95% CI: 20.2, 34.1; n=101), 
respectively. For patients who had no prior ASCT or progressed more than 36 months after an ASCT, 
median OS was 23.6 months (95% CI: 18.9, 28.0; n=145 ) on melphalan flufenamide /dexamethasone 
vs 19.8 months (95% CI: 12.6, 26.5; n=148) in the pomalidomide/dexamethasone arm.

Myeloablative conditioning treatment 
The efficacy and safety of Pepaxti at doses required for myeloablation have not been studied in 
humans. Pepaxti should not be used for conditioning treatment prior to stem cell transplantation. 
Renal impairment 
Since patients with renal impairment may have marked bone marrow suppression, these patients 
should be closely monitored. There are insufficient data in patients with eGFR below 
30 mL/min/1.73 m2 to support a dose recommendation (see section 4.2). 
Attenuated live vaccines  
A risk of severe illness that may lead to fatal outcome has been described with the metabolite 
melphalan in patients receiving attenuated live vaccines. This risk is increased in patients who are 
already immunosuppressed by their underlying disease. An inactivated or mRNA based vaccine 
should be used when such a vaccine exists. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed with melphalan flufenamide. Based on available in vitro 
and clinical data, there is a low risk of pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic drug interactions for 
melphalan flufenamide (see section 5.2). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
As with all cytotoxic treatments, male and female patients who use melphalan flufenamide should use 
effective and reliable contraceptive methods until six months after cessation of treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of melphalan flufenamide in pregnant women. Studies in animals with 
the melphalan flufenamide metabolite melphalan have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Due to the genotoxic properties and structural similarity of melphalan flufenamide with known 
teratogenic compounds, it is possible that melphalan flufenamide can induce congenital malformations 
in offspring of treated patients. Melphalan flufenamide should not be used during pregnancy unless the 
clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with melphalan flufenamide.  
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether melphalan flufenamide or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Due to its 
genotoxic properties, melphalan flufenamide is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
Melphalan flufenamide, as other agents with alkylating properties, is expected to suppress ovary 
function in premenopausal women, resulting in amenorrhea in a large number of patients. 
Studies in animals have shown melphalan flufenamide can have adverse effects on spermatogenesis 
(see section 5.3). Therefore it is possible that melphalan flufenamide may cause temporary or 
permanent adverse effects on male fertility. 
Cryopreservation of semen before treatment is advised.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Pepaxti has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. It is possible that certain 
adverse reactions of melphalan flufenamide, such as dizziness and nausea, may affect this ability.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of Pepaxti in combination with dexamethasone has been evaluated in 491 patients with 
multiple myeloma, including 147 patients with triple-class refractory disease who have received at 
least three prior lines of therapies. The most frequent adverse reactions are thrombocytopenia (83%), 
neutropenia (72%), anaemia (66%), nausea (21%), diarrhoea (19%) and pyrexia (19%). The most 
frequent serious adverse reactions are pneumonia (11%), thrombocytopenia (5%) and respiratory tract 
infection (4%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 3 summarises adverse reactions that were reported in patients receiving Pepaxti. The data reflect 
exposure of Pepaxti as single agent or in combination with dexamethasone in 491 patients with 
multiple myeloma. 
Adverse reactions are described using MedDRA terms.  
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1 000 
to <1/100), rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000), very rare (<1/10 000) and not known (cannot be estimated 
from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order 
of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Thrombocytopenia 
Thrombocytopenia was reported in 83% of patients, Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was reported in 74% 
of patients treated with Pepaxti. 33% of patients experienced Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia during the 
first treatment cycle. Median time to onset of Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was 43 days from first 
dose. Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia resulted in dose delay, dose reduction and dose discontinuation of 
Pepaxti in 41%, 23% and 12%, respectively.  
Bleeding 
Any Grade bleeding was reported in 21% of patients. Grade 3 bleeding was reported in 2% and 
Grade 4 bleeding was reported in <1% of patients. The most commonly reported bleedings were 
epistaxis, affecting 6% of patients, and unspecified haematoma, affecting 2% of patients. Bleedings 
starting in cycle concomitant with Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia were reported in 14% of patients. 
Neutropenia 
Neutropenia was reported in 72% of patients, Grade 3/4 neutropenia was reported in 66% of patients 
treated with Pepaxti. 38% of patients experienced Grade 3/4 neutropenia during the first treatment 
cycle. Median time to onset of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 22 days from first dose. 
Grade 3/4 neutropenia resulted in dose delay, dose reduction and dose discontinuation of Pepaxti in 
26%, 9% and 4%, respectively. 
Infections occurred in cycle concomitant with Grade 3/4 neutropenia in 21% of patients. Clinically 
significant infections (Grade 3 or higher) were reported in 8% of patients with concomitant Grade 3-4 
neutropenia. Febrile neutropenia was reported in 4% of patients. 
Infections 
All patients in the target population are at risk of infections due to their immunodeficient status. 
Myelosuppression and immunosuppressive effects induced by melphalan flufenamide may facilitate 
the development of infections which may have fatal outcome in the most severe manifestations. 
Adoption of prophylactic measures such as the administration of antimicrobials can be useful (see 
section 4.2). 
In patients receiving Pepaxti, 52% of patients experienced any type of infection. Pneumonia and other 
respiratory tract infection are the most common types of infections.  
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Anaemia 
Anaemia was reported in 66% of patients, and Grade 3 anaemia was reported in 41% of patients and 
Grade 4 anaemia was reported in 1% of patients treated with Pepaxti.  
Second primary malignancies 
Alkylating agents have been associated with development of MDS, AML and other second 
malignancies. Development of MDS and AML in patients receiving Pepaxti in clinical studies was 
uncommon. Also a low number of other second primary malignancies have been reported, the most 
common being basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In the event of overdose, gastrointestinal events like nausea and vomiting, and haematological events 
due to bone marrow suppression are likely to occur. The patient should be monitored for any signs or 
symptoms of adverse reactions, including complete blood counts weekly for at least 4 weeks, and 
appropriate supportive treatment, such as blood transfusion, antimicrobials and/or haematopoietic 
growth factors should be instituted if needed. There is no known specific antidote to melphalan 
flufenamide. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, nitrogen mustard analogues, ATC code: L01AA10 
Mechanism of action 
Melphalan flufenamide is a peptide conjugated alkylating drug. The drug is composed of a di-peptide 
and an alkylating moiety of the nitrogen mustard analogues group. The lipophilic intact peptide 
conjugate is rapidly distributed via passive transport into cells where it is bound to and catalysed by 
esterases and peptidases to the metabolite melphalan. Similar to other nitrogen mustard drugs, cross-
linking of DNA is involved in the antitumor activity of melphalan flufenamide. In cellular assays, 
melphalan flufenamide inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of haematopoietic tumour cells. 
Retained cytotoxic activity was demonstrated in multiple myeloma cells with absent or impaired p53 
functionality. Melphalan flufenamide showed synergistic cytotoxicity with dexamethasone in 
melphalan resistant and non-resistant multiple myeloma cell lines. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
At the approved dose, melphalan flufenamide does not affect the ECG parameters PR interval, QRS 
interval, or QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of melphalan flufenamide in combination with dexamethasone were evaluated 
in HORIZON, a multicentre, single-arm study in 157 patients with relapsed-refractory multiple 
myeloma (RRMM). A total of 157 patients received melphalan flufenamide 40 mg on Day 1 and 
dexamethasone 40 mg (20 mg for patients ≥ 75 years of age) on Day 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28 day 
cycle. Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 110 of the patients had 
multiple myeloma that was refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor, at least one 
immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, i.e. were triple-class refractory 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(TCR) and had received at least 3 prior lines of therapies. Primary refractory patients were excluded 
from the study.  
The median duration of melphalan flufenamide treatment in the TCR patient population (n=110) was 
3.0 months (range 1.0 to 28.0 months). 
Out of the 110 ≥3rd line TCR patients in the HORIZON study, 52 patients had no ASCT or progressed 
more than 36 months after an ASCT and 58 patients had progressed within 36 months from an ASCT. 
The disease characteristics and efficacy results in TCR patients who have received at least 3 prior lines 
of therapies and who had no ASCT or progressed more than 36 months after an ASCT are summarised 
in Table 4 and Table 5. 
The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR) assessed according to the 
IMWG criteria by investigators.

Pepaxti in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of multiple myeloma (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following Pepaxti 40 mg, melphalan flufenamide peak plasma concentrations of an average 
159 ng/mL (CV% 39) were reached during the 30-minute infusion. Peak plasma concentrations of the 
active metabolite melphalan were reached 4 to 15 minutes after the end of infusion of Pepaxti 40 mg. 
Following Pepaxti 40 mg, the mean (CV%) Cmax was 432 ng/mL (30%) and AUC0-INF was 
3,143 mcg/mL·hr (28%) for the metabolite melphalan after a single dose. The mean (CV%) Cmax was 
419 ng/mL (33%) and AUC0-INF was 2,933 mcg/mL·hr (29%) for the metabolite melphalan at steady-
state. 
Melphalan flufenamide and the metabolite melphalan AUC increases in an approximately dose 
proportional manner over the dose range 25 to 130 mg.  
Distribution 
In vivo the disappearance of melphalan flufenamide from plasma is rapid and is attributed to 
distribution to peripheral tissues.  
The mean (CV%) volume of distribution was 35 L (71%) for melphalan flufenamide and the mean 
apparent volume of distribution is 76 L (32%) for the metabolite melphalan after a single dose of 
melphalan flufenamide.  
Biotransformation  
Melphalan flufenamide is metabolised in tissues into the metabolite desethyl-melphalan flufenamide 
and into the metabolite melphalan. There is no appreciable metabolism of melphalan flufenamide to 
the metabolite melphalan in plasma. Melphalan is metabolised primarily by spontaneous hydrolysis to 
monohydroxy-melphalan and dihydroxy-melphalan.  
Elimination 
After the end of infusion of Pepaxti 40 mg, the mean (CV%) elimination half-life of melphalan 
flufenamide is 2.1 minutes (34%). The mean (CV%) elimination half-life of the metabolite melphalan 
is 70 minutes (21%). The mean (CV%) clearance of melphalan flufenamide and the metabolite 
melphalan is 692 L/hr (49%) and 23 L/hr (23%), respectively, at the recommended dose of Pepaxti 
40 mg. 
Renal and hepatic excretion of unchanged melphalan flufenamide is assessed to be negligible as total 
plasma clearance of melphalan flufenamide greatly exceeds renal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and 
hepatic blood flow.

Specific populations 
Elderly patients (> 65 years old) 
Based on population PK analysis, no differences in the pharmacokinetics of the metabolite melphalan 
were observed based on age or gender. 
Renal impairment 
The melphalan flufenamide metabolite melphalan is partially cleared through renal excretion. In 
melphalan flufenamide treated patients in study OP-103 58 patients had normal renal function, 
103 patients had mild renal impairment and 117 patients had moderate renal impairment.  
Based on population PK analysis melphalan AUC was on average 6% higher in mild impairment, 18% 
higher in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR 45-60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 32% higher 
in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m2 compared to patients 
with normal renal function. A larger effect of Pepaxti on thrombocyte levels was observed in patients 
with a lower eGFR. A Pepaxti dose of 30 mg is recommended in patients with eGFR 
30-45 mL/min/1.73 m2. There are insufficient data in patients with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 to 
support a dose recommendation. 
Hepatic impairment 
No differences in the PK of the metabolite melphalan were observed in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN, or total bilirubin 1 to 1.5 × ULN and any AST). 
The effect of moderate to severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 × ULN and any AST) on PK 
is not known. 
Body weight 
Higher exposures of the metabolite melphalan were observed in patients with lower body weight. At a 
body weight of 60 kg Cmax was on average 36% higher and AUC on average 31% higher compared to 
a body weight of 95 kg. Higher incidence of thrombocytopenia and neutropenia was observed in 
patients with lower body weight. A Pepaxti dose of 30 mg is recommended in patients with a body 
weight of 60 kg or less.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity 
Pepaxti is genotoxic. Mechanistic in vitro studies showed that melphalan flufenamide caused 
irreversible DNA damage. 
No carcinogenicity or mutagenicity studies have been conducted with melphalan flufenamide. 
Reproductive toxicology 
In repeated dose toxicology studies, melphalan flufenamide was administered intravenously to rats at 
20, 40, or 55 mg/m2, and to dogs at 0.45 or 0.90 mg/kg (9 or 18 mg/m2) every 21 days for two or three 
doses. Decreased testes weights and depletion of germ cells were observed in both species, and 
epididymal oligospermia was observed in dogs. Adverse effects on male reproductive organs were 
observed in dogs at exposures below the recommended clinical dose of 40 mg. The reversibility of 
adverse effects on male reproductive organs was not assessed.  
Reproduction toxicity studies have not been conducted with melphalan flufenamide. The melphalan 
flufenamide metabolite melphalan was teratogenic in rats after single dose exposure. In repeated dose 
reproductive toxicity studies, melphalan exposure resulted in maternal toxicity and induced congenital 
malformations. In a study in mice, a reduction in number of pups per litter was observed.

Melphalan flufenamide 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important 
information for you. 
- 
- 
- 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse.  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

5.  How to store Pepaxti 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Pepaxti is and what it is used for 
Pepaxti belongs to a group of cancer medicines called alkylating agents. It works by attaching to DNA 
(the genetic instruction needed for cells to survive and multiply) and damaging it, thereby helping to 
stop the cancer cells from growing. 
Pepaxti is given with the steroid dexamethasone, to treat adults with the blood cancer multiple 
myeloma. It is used when the disease does not respond to at least three types of cancer medicine. If 
you have been treated with a blood stem cell transplant (a procedure where the cells that make your 
blood are cleared out and replaced), the time to when the multiple myeloma came back after 
transplantation should be at least 3 years.  
2.  What you need to know before you are given Pepaxti  
Do not use Pepaxti 
- 
if you are allergic to melphalan flufenamide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
if you are breast-feeding. 
- 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Pepaxti. 
Abnormal bleeding and bruising and low number of platelets (blood cells) 
Pepaxti can lower the number of blood cells called platelets that help to clot your blood. Tell your 
doctor or nurse immediately if you start bleeding e.g. a nosebleed or get bruises on your skin.  
Fever and low number of white blood cells 
Pepaxti can lower the number of white blood cells that are important for fighting infections. Tell your 
doctor or nurse immediately if you have symptoms of infection such as fever, chills or cough. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Low number of red blood cells 
Pepaxti can lower the number of red blood cells, which transport oxygen to the cells in your body. 
Your doctor will regularly take blood samples to monitor your blood cells. Tell your doctor or nurse 
immediately if you feel weak or tired, if you look pale or if you feel short of breath.  
Infections 
Infections such as lung infection (pneumonia) and upper respiratory tract infection (causing cold-like 
symptoms) are very common with Pepaxti. Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you develop fever 
or other signs of infection. Your doctor might recommend preventive antibiotics to lower the risk of 
developing infections. 
Risk of diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting 
You should tell your doctor if you get diarrhoea, nausea, or vomiting.  
Risk of development of blood clots 
The use of Pepaxti in combination with dexamethasone may increase the risk of developing blood 
clots. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have ever had a blood clot in a vein (thrombosis). Tell your 
doctor or nurse immediately if you develop a swelling of a leg or an arm, if you find it harder to 
breathe, or experience chest pain. 
Risk of additional cancer 
It is important to note that patients with multiple myeloma treated with Pepaxti may develop 
additional types of cancer, therefore your doctor should carefully evaluate the benefit and risk for you 
when you are prescribed this medicine. 
Kidney disease 
If you have lowered kidney function, the side effects of Pepaxti on your blood cells may be worse. 
There is too little information available on use of the medicine in patients with severely lowered 
kidney function to be able to recommend a safe and effective dose. 
Vaccinations 
Vaccines that contain live but weakened organisms, known as live attenuated vaccines (like measles, 
mumps, and rubella vaccines) should not be used while you are being treated with Pepaxti, as they 
may lead to an infection. Some other types of vaccines known as inactivated vaccines or mRNA based 
vaccines can, however, be used. Tell your healthcare provider you are being treated with Pepaxti 
before you get vaccinated. 
Children and adolescents 
Pepaxti is not intended for use in children or adolescents below 18 years of age. 
Other medicines and Pepaxti 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. 
Pregnancy 
This medicine is not recommended for use during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. Avoid 
becoming pregnant while being treated with this medicine as it may harm your unborn baby. Your 
doctor will discuss with you the potential risks of using Pepaxti during pregnancy. 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant: 
• 
• 
Your doctor will ask you to take a pregnancy test before you start treatment with Pepaxti. 
You must use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after your last dose of 
Pepaxti. Talk to your doctor about effective contraception methods that may be right for you. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you are a man who could father a child: 
• 
You must use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after your last dose of 
Pepaxti. 
Breast-feeding 
You should not breast-feed during treatment with Pepaxti since it may be harmful for your baby.  
Fertility 
Pepaxti can affect ovaries or sperm, which may cause infertility (inability to have a baby). In women, 
menstruation can stop. In men, inability to father a child (sterility) due to lack of sperm can be 
permanent. Ask your doctor for advice on sperm preservation before treatment.  
Driving and using machines 
Pepaxti can cause nausea and dizziness, which may reduce your ability to drive or use machines.   
3. 
How Pepaxti is given 
Pepaxti is made up into a solution and given by your doctor or nurse as a drip into a vein (intravenous 
infusion) over 30 minutes. Your doctor will decide on the correct dose of Pepaxti. The recommended 
starting dose is 40 mg once every 4 weeks. If you have a body weight of 60 kg or less, the 
recommended starting dose is 30 mg once every 4 weeks. Treatment will carry on as long as you are 
benefitting from it and do not have unacceptable side effects. As part of your treatment, you will also 
take another medicine, dexamethasone, by mouth. 
If you are given more Pepaxti than you should 
This medicine will be given by your doctor or nurse. In the unlikely event that you are given too much 
(an overdose) your doctor will check you, including taking blood samples to monitor your blood cells. 
If a dose of Pepaxti is missed 
It is very important to go to all your appointments, to make sure your treatment works. If you miss an 
appointment, contact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Contact a doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects – you may 
need urgent medical treatment: 
• 
Fever, chills, sore throat, cough, or any other signs of infection (due to lack of white blood cells 
called neutrophils, which fight infections). 
Rapid breathing, rapid pulse, fever and chills, passing very little to no urine, nausea and 
vomiting, confusion, unconsciousness (due to serious bacterial infection of the blood called 
sepsis or septic shock). 
Bleeding or bruising without a cause, including nosebleeds (due to low number of blood 
platelets [thrombocytopenia]). 
Shortness of breath (from serious chest infection, inflammation of the lungs, or blood clot in the 
lungs). 
Leg or arm pain and swelling, especially in your lower leg or calves (caused by blood clots).

Preparation steps 
Read the complete instructions prior to starting preparation.  
Steps 3 to 5 must be completed within 30 minutes. 
Reconstitution and dilution steps 
Step 1 
Determine the number of vials needed for the dose as per Table 1 “Dilution Volumes per Pepaxti 
dose”. Place vial(s) at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.  
Step 2 
Shake the vial(s) vigorously or vortex to disintegrate the lyophilised powder cake into a loose 
powder.  
Step 3 to 5 must be completed within 30 minutes 
Step 3 
For a Pepaxti dose of 
40 mg 
Aseptically 
reconstitute each of 
the 2 vials with 40 mL 
of 5% glucose 
solution for infusion 
to obtain a final 
concentration of 
0.5 mg/mL.  
For a Pepaxti dose of 
30 mg 
Aseptically 
reconstitute each of 
the 2 vials with 40 mL 
of 5% glucose 
solution for infusion 
to obtain a final 
concentration of 
0.5 mg/mL. 
For a Pepaxti dose of 
20 mg 
Aseptically 
reconstitute 1 vial 
with 40 mL of 5% 
glucose solution for 
infusion to obtain a 
final concentration of 
0.5 mg/mL. 
For a Pepaxti dose of 
15 mg 
Aseptically 
reconstitute 1 vial 
with 40 mL of 5% 
glucose solution for 
infusion to obtain a 
final concentration of 
0.5 mg/mL. 
Ensure the 5% glucose solution for infusion is at room temperature (20°C to 25°C). Shake the 
vial(s) vigorously until solution is clear.  
Let the vial(s) stand to allow air bubbles to dissipate to confirm a clear solution. 
Step 4 
Withdraw 80 mL from a refrigerated (2°C to 8°C) 250 mL bag sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) 
solution for injection. Discard the withdrawn 80 mL. 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 5 
For a Pepaxti dose of 
40 mg 
Withdraw 80 mL of 
reconstituted solution 
from the Pepaxti vials 
and transfer into an 
intravenous (IV) 
solution for injection 
containing sodium 
chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) to obtain a 
final concentration of 
0.16 mg/mL. 
For a Pepaxti dose of 
30 mg 
Withdraw 60 mL of 
reconstituted solution 
from the Pepaxti vials 
and transfer into an 
intravenous (IV) 
solution for injection 
containing sodium 
chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) to obtain a final 
concentration of 
0.13 mg/mL. 
For a Pepaxti dose of 
20 mg 
Withdraw 40 mL of 
reconstituted solution 
from the Pepaxti vials 
and transfer into an 
intravenous (IV) 
solution for injection 
containing sodium 
chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) to obtain a 
final concentration of 
0.10 mg/mL. 
For a Pepaxti dose of 
15 mg 
Withdraw 30 mL of 
reconstituted solution 
from the Pepaxti vials 
and transfer into an 
intravenous (IV) 
solution for injection 
containing sodium 
chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) to obtain a 
final concentration of 
0.08 mg/mL. 
Discard any unused portion left in the vial(s).   
Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. Do not shake. Check that the solution is clear and 
colourless to pale yellow. Do not use if solution discolouration or particles are observed. 
Storage timelines 
Pepaxti degrades in solution, especially at room temperature, and the storage timelines for diluted 
solution should not be exceeded.  
For immediate administration 
Infusion of the diluted solution must begin within 60 minutes of start of reconstitution (step 3).   
For delayed administration 
If not used for immediate administration, the diluted solution should be placed in a refrigerator (2°C 
to 8°C) within 30 minutes after initial reconstitution (step 3) and store for up to 6 hours.  
Administration 
Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration 
prior to administration. Do not use if visibly opaque particles, discolouration or foreign particles are 
observed.  
Administration steps 
Step 6  
Administer Pepaxti as a 30-minute intravenous infusion via a central venous access device, for 
example PICC or tunnelled central venous catheter. If the infusion bag has been stored in a 
refrigerator, allow to reach to room temperature (20°C to 25°C). Start infusion within 30 minutes of 
removing the diluted solution from the refrigerator. 
Step 7  
Upon completion of Pepaxti infusion, flush the central catheter with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) 
solution for injection. 
Disposal 
Pepaxti is a cytotoxic medicinal product for single use only. The procedure for the safe handling and 
disposal of nitrogen mustard analogues must be followed by healthcare professionals or medical 
personnel and should comply with the current recommendations for cytotoxic medicinal products. Any 
unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

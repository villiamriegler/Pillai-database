2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Kimmtrak is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) A*02:01-
positive adult patients with unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Uveal melanoma is the most frequent primary intraocular malignancy of the adult eye (~85%; Patel, 
2011; Maio, 2013). Uveal melanoma is a rare and highly malignant subset of melanoma, representing 
< 5% of all melanoma cases in the United States (US; McLaughlin, 2005). The incidence varies by 
geography, race, and age, ranging from 5.3 to 10.9 cases per million (Singh, 2011). In Europe, the 
incidence of UM follows a decreasing gradient from north-to-south, ranging from 2 to 8 per million 
population (Virgili et.al 2007).  Despite its rarity (representing ~3% of melanoma cases, approximately 
4000 new diagnoses globally per year, any stage), UM is the most frequent primary intraocular 
malignancy of the adult eye (~85%; Patel 2011; Singh et al, 2011). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Uveal melanoma arises exclusively from melanocytes of the uvea, and it is biologically, clinically, and 
genetically distinct from cutaneous melanoma (CM; Jager, 2020). BRAF and NRAS mutations dominate 
the landscape in CM, whereas mutations in guanine nucleotide binding protein, q polypeptide, and 
alpha 11 dominate in UM (Shoushtari, 2014). The mode of disease spread is distinct between the 2 
diseases, with hematogenous spread being most common in UM while lymphatic predominates in CM. 
Moreover, UM has a highly immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (Jager, 2020; Rothermel, 
2016). Cutaneous melanoma has one of the highest tumour mutational burdens (TMB), whereas the 
TMB of UM is among the lowest of all cancers (Lee, 2019; Yarchoan, 2017). The low TMB in UM results 
in few neoantigens, which limits natural antitumour immunity (Violanti, 2019), making UM less 
sensitive to immune checkpoint inhibitors than CM. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Uveal melanoma is a life-threatening disease with no effective therapy once it metastasizes. Despite 
local therapy (radiation and surgery), up to 50% of patients with UM develop systemic metastases, 
predominantly to the liver (~90% of patients) and less commonly to the lungs and bones (Nathan, 
2015). Once patients develop metastatic UM (mUM), the prognosis and outcomes are dismal, with a 
median survival of ≤ 12 months (Rantala, 2019; Khoja, 2019). Over the past 40 years, there has been 
no significant improvement in survival for patients with mUM. 
2.1.5.  Management 
In contrast to other melanomas, particularly cutaneous melanoma (CM), current treatment options for 
mUM are limited and have poor efficacy. Metastatic UM responds poorly to cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 9/165 
 
 
 
radiotherapy, and immunotherapy (Buder, 2013; Pereira, 2013). No systemic or local therapies are 
approved specifically for the treatment of mUM (Carvajal, 2014; Luke, 2013; Maio, 2013). Treatments 
introduced for CM over the past decade have not significantly benefited patients with UM, reflecting the 
distinct biology, genetics, and clinical course of UM. The standard of care for mUM is enrollment in a 
clinical trial (Carvajal, 2017). When clinical trials are not available, therapies for advanced CM are 
used. 
Representative multicentre clinical studies or case series of at least 20 patients with mUM who received 
available therapies are summarised in Table 1. Studies with single-agent chemotherapy arms showed a 
median overall survival of approximately 10 months (Buder, 2013). Single agent immune checkpoint 
inhibitors exhibited median OS similar to that of cytotoxic therapy in mUM (~ 6-10 months). These 
data are generally consistent with a global meta-analysis that included > 900 patients in Phase 2 trials 
in mUM, demonstrating a median OS of approximately 9 months and 1-year OS rate of 43% across 
treatment modalities and lines of therapy in the metastatic setting (Khoja, 2019). In a meta-analysis 
of > 2400 first line (1L) mUM patients, median OS was about 12 months with a 1-year OS rate of 52% 
(Rantala, 2019). Although the combination of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 has a numerically higher 
objective response rate (ORR), this combination has a 1-year OS rate similar to checkpoint 
monotherapy (Pelster, 2021; Piulats, 2021).

Unmet medical need 
Uveal melanoma is a life-threatening disease with no effective therapy once it metastasizes. Despite 
local therapy (radiation and surgery), up to 50% of patients with UM develop systemic metastases, 
predominantly to the liver (~90% of patients) and less commonly to the lungs and bones (Nathan, 
2015). Once patients develop metastatic UM (mUM), the prognosis and outcomes are dismal, with a 
median survival of ≤ 12 months (Rantala, 2019; Khoja, 2019). Over the past 40 years, there has been 
no significant improvement in survival for patients with mUM. 
2.2.  About the product 
Tebentafusp is a bispecific protein therapeutic comprised of an affinity-enhanced soluble T cell receptor 
(TCR) domain fused to an anti-CD3 single-chain variable fragment (scFv). The TCR domain targets the 
glycoprotein 100 (gp100) peptide fragment (YLEPGPVTA) when presented by human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA)-A*02:01 on the cell surface. The targeted gp100 peptide is presented by a subset of the 
population that express a specific variant (serotype) of HLA-A2. This variant is carried by 
approximately 50% of the population in North American and Western European Populations (Middleton, 
2003). Therefore, the anti-tumour activity of tebentafusp is restricted to patients with the HLA 
A*02:01 allele. An immune synapse is formed when the TCR targeting domain of tebentafusp binds to 
UM cells and the CD3 effector domain binds to polyclonal T cells. This immune synapse results in 
redirection, proliferation, and activation of polyclonal T cells regardless of their native TCR specificity. 
Tebentafusp-activated polyclonal T cells release inflammatory cytokines and cytolytic proteins, which 
result in direct lysis of UM tumour cells. In addition, tebentafusp-mediated lysis may prime an 
endogenous anti-tumour immune response via epitope spreading. 
The applied indication is as monotherapy for the treatment of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) 
A*02:01-positive adult patients with unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma. 
Patients treated with Kimmtrak must have HLA-A*02:01 genotype determined by any validated HLA 
genotyping assay. The recommended dose of Kimmtrak is 20 micrograms on Day 1, 30 micrograms on 
Day 8, 68 micrograms on Day 15, and 68 micrograms once every week thereafter. 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the high unmet medical need in the 
claimed indication of metastatic uveal melanoma and the provided data for tebentafusp support that 
the medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health. This conclusion is 
based on the available comparative data from a randomised clinical trial with a relevant comparator 
(investigators choice due to lack of approved therapies for the targeted patient population), which 
shows a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in OS. Moreover, there is a high 
unmet medical need in the proposed setting since approximately 50% of patients with newly diagnosed 
uveal melanoma will develop metastatic disease, which has a poor prognosis and a median OS of less 
than a year. This unmet need seems to be met by treatment with tebentafusp as the median OS in the 
tebentafusp arm is 21.7 months.

2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
Tebentafusp (INN) is a bispecific fusion protein composed of a high-affinity soluble human T cell 
receptor (TCR), that binds glycoprotein 100 (gp100) melanoma antigen, fused to a single-chain 
variable fragment anti-CD3 (scFv) which activates local T cells via interaction with CD3 on the surface 
of T cells in the tumour environment. The activated T cells kill the target tumour cells directly and 
trigger an augmentation of a local tumour-directed immune response. 
Tebentafusp is composed of an alpha chain and a beta chain subunit. The subunits are linked by an 
inter-chain disulfide bond. The beta subunit of the TCR is fused with a scFv domain of an anti-CD3 
antibody via a short linker (the beta-scFv component is written as beta chain).  
The alpha chain and the beta chain are composed of 195 and 500 amino acid residues, respectively.  
Tebentafusp active substance is a heterodimeric protein manufactured by the refolding of alpha and 
beta chain polypeptides, which are produced in recombinant Escherichia coli (E. coli) as intracellular, 
insoluble inclusion bodies (IBs).

2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Manufacturing of the active substance is carried out by AGC Biologics A/S, Denmark. Testing sites and 
responsibilities have been included and provided. Master Cell bank (MCB) and working cell banks 
(WCB) have been established under GMP conditions. GMP compliance is confirmed for all relevant sites. 
Tebentafusp is a heterodimeric protein manufactured by the refolding of alpha and beta chain 
polypeptides.  
The commercial manufacturing process for tebentafusp consists of three phases (culture, recovery of 
the alpha and beta chain polypeptides, and, refolding and purification) and 11 steps.  
The protein is manufactured in separate fermentations of recombinant E. coli, (1) for the alpha, and 
(2) for the beta-scFv fusion polypeptides. The separate chains are then combined and allowed to refold 
into the correct protein structure. The correctly folded protein is then purified via several 
chromatography steps.  
The manufacturing is based on a seed lot system. 
There are no process intermediates in the active substance manufacturing process. No reprocessing of 
the active substance is proposed. The active substance batch scale is properly defined. The batch 
numbering system is described in sufficient detail and allows adequate identification and appropriate 
traceability of the active substance batches. 
The control strategy for the tebentafusp active substance manufacturing process was established in 
line with ICH Q11 guidance. The tebentafusp active substance manufacturing process is controlled by a 
number of process parameters with defined targets / limits, and a large number of in-process controls 
(IPCs) and in-process monitorings (IPMs) with defined acceptance criteria / expected ranges.  
For each process step, process parameters have been evaluated and defined in relation to their impact 
on critical quality attributes (CQAs) (critical process parameters (CPPs) and process performance 
attributes (key process parameters (KPPs)) and a justification for the classification has been provided. 
Furthermore, a risk assessment of the tebentafusp active substance manufacturing process, Process 
Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) has been performed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 13/165 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the manufacturing process is considered adequately described and the applied process 
parameters and IPCs, as well as their ranges, and the control of starting materials are considered 
adequate to control the process and ensure formation of active substance of adequate and consistent 
quality.  
Control of materials 
The MCB and WCBs have been characterised according to current guideline. No evidence of microbial 
contamination was observed.  
Stability of the cell banks and the genetic integrations were demonstrated through end of production 
(EOP) and Limit of In-Vitro Cell Age (LIVCA) testing. Purity testing, genetic characterisation and 
expression data performed on the LIVCA cell banks showed that extending the number of generations 
up to the defined LIVCA should not negatively impact the upstream manufacturing process.  
Overall, the generation and characterisation of the MCBs, WCBs, EOP cell banks and LIVCA cell banks 
comply with the requirements set in the ICH Q5D guideline. Post commercial launch of tebentafusp, 
the MCB will be retested for viability every 10 years whereas the WCB stability monitoring will be 
performed routinely. The stability monitoring protocol is found adequate. The applicant also provided 
sufficient and information on the procedures to establish new MCBs and WCBs.   
Process validation 
Three consecutive commercial scale tebentafusp active substance validation batches have been 
manufactured according to a validation protocol and pre-defined process performance qualification 
(PPQ) acceptance criteria. The IPC and IPM results, the unit operating ranges during the three PPQ 
runs, and the PPQ batch release data confirm that the control strategy performs as intended to 
consistently manufacture active substance meeting predetermined quality attributes. All PPQ release 
data comply with the proposed active substance specification. Efficient clearance of process related 
impurities was consistently demonstrated in all three PPQ runs.  
Sterilisation and cleaning of the equipment used for each of the process steps was validated. Shipping 
validation has been accomplished for the shipment of tebentafusp active substance from the active 
substance manufacturer to the finished product manufacturer. The ongoing process verification 
approach has been presented and is considered acceptable. 
Overall, the approach taken to validate tebentafusp active substance manufacturing process is 
considered adequate. The process is demonstrated to perform consistently and tebentafusp active 
substance meets all the biochemical, functional and microbiological acceptance criteria. 
Manufacturing process development 
A number of comparability studies have been performed. Overall, comparability assessment is 
considered covered by the studies and analyses performed and comparability is overall supported by 
the data presented. 
Method bridging studies have been performed where relevant and method bridging studies 
demonstrate that methods are comparable. 
Overall, the approaches taken for process characterisation and development of the control strategy 
including acceptable ranges are adequately described and considered acceptable and compliant to ICH 
guideline Q11. 
In conclusion, the process development, including development of the control strategy, is overall 
considered adequately described and justified. A large number of thorough comparability studies have 
been made, indicating product comparability.

Characterisation  
Overall, the structural and physiochemical characterisation of tebentafusp active substance is 
considered comprehensive and sufficient.   
An overview of the batches included in the different characterisation studies has been provided.  
The characterisation studies include release testing using the proposed commercial release analytical 
methods and extended characterisation methods to assess the primary, secondary and higher order 
structure, as well as post-translational modifications. Physicochemical characteristics have also been 
sufficiently addressed. In addition, the biological and immunological characteristics have been 
sufficiently addressed.   
2.4.2.3.  Specification

The active substance specification includes general tests (appearance (color and clarity), pH, 
osmolality), test for identity, purity and impurity tests for product-related impurities, test for process-
related impurities, test for protein content, potency, as well as tests for safety (endotoxin and 
bioburden). In addition, tests for excipients are included on the specification. 
Overall, the parameters included in the active substance specification are found adequate to control 
the quality of the tebentafusp active substance at release and shelf life. 
The justification of the acceptance criteria for tebentafusp active substance is based on batch data 
from several active substance batches manufactured representing the commercial manufacturing 
process.  
Overall the approach to setting the acceptance criteria is in line with ICH Q6B and the acceptance 
criteria are in general found appropriate.  
Analytical procedures 
The panel of methods used to assure the quality of the active substance is in accordance with ICH 
Q6B, Ph. Eur. 2031, and EMA/CHMP/BWP/532517/2008. The analytical procedures are in general 
described in sufficient detail. Information on the reference standard is included where relevant. The 
methods are considered suitable for their intended use.  
The compendial analytical procedures are performed in accordance with the methods described in the 
relevant pharmacopoeia. Bioburden and Bacterial endotoxin test methods were qualified for use with 
the active substance, in-process samples and in-process buffers, demonstrating recovery of challenge 
organisms in the presence of the different samples.  
The applicant has provided a summary of validation for the non-compendial methods. The non-
compendial analytical methods have in general been sufficiently validated according to ICH Q2 to 
control active substance and finished product where relevant.

A two-tiered reference material system has been established. The applicant provided batch information 
about the primary reference standard, the working reference standard and historical reference 
standards. Qualification includes active substance release methods as well as additional 
characterisation.  
The applicant outlines the characterisation of future working reference standards which consists of 
active substance release tests and extended characterisation.

Tebentafusp active substance is filled into sterile bottles and stored at the recommended temperature. 
The bottles and closures are supplied sterile. Based on the information provided the proposed 
container-closure is accepted. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
The stability studies are designed in accordance with ICH Q5C Stability testing of 
biotechnological/biological products. Long-term stability studies are on-going for several tebentafusp 
active substance batches. 
Trends were not observed at the intended storage temperature for any test. The stability samples are 
stored in a container closure system (CCS) that is representative of the commercial product. Based on 
the stability results the proposed shelf life for the active substance is acceptable when stored at the 
recommended storage conditions. 
The post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment are acceptable.  
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Description of the product 
The finished product is an aqueous solution of tebentafusp, which is clear, colourless to slightly 
yellowish. 
The tebentafusp finished product is supplied as a sterile 0.2 mg/mL concentrate for solution for 
infusion in a single-dose vial. The other ingredients are: disodium hydrogen phosphate, citric acid 
monohydrate, mannitol, trehalose, polysorbate 20 and water for injections. All excipients are 
compendial. No overages are added to the tebentafusp finished product. 
The CCS consists of a Type 1 glass vial with a bromobutyl, rubber stopper and a aluminum overseal 
with a blue flip-off cap. Vial and stopper are compliant with Ph. Eur 3.2.1 and 3.2.9, respectively. 
Pharmaceutical development 
Tebentafusp is a recombinant bispecific fusion protein solubilised at 0.20 mg/mL in a formulation buffer 
of disodium hydrogen phosphate, citric acid, trehalose, mannitol, polysorbate 20, pH 6.5. 
Excipients include disodium hydrogen phosphate and citric acid monohydrate, mannitol and trehalose 
and polysorbate 20. No novel excipients or excipients of human or animal origin have been identified. 
Compatibility of active substance with the excipients is considered demonstrated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 16/165 
 
 
 
Two different formulations were used to support the Phase 1/2 clinical studies. Formulation 
development included studies to support adjustments in active substance concentration, buffers, 
excipients, pH and surfactants and the changes considered justified. 
The tebentafusp finished product manufacturing process consists of a thaw of tebentafusp bulk active 
substance, a compounding step, filtration, fill into glass vials, stoppering and capping before 100% 
visual inspection. No excipients are added in the manufacture of tebentafusp finished product. The 
finished product manufacturing process development has mainly consisted in increasing the batch size 
and adjustment of the fill volume. The IPCs have been adjusted during the development. 
Analytical comparability is presented for all batches of the different development stages back to the 
primary reference. All batches are considered comparable across formulations and manufacturing sites. 
The proposed sets of process and release controls are reasonable and similar to common industry 
practice. 
The tebentafusp finished product does not contain preservatives or antioxidants. The finished product 
is sterile filtered using an aseptic filling process. Satisfactory microbiological testing and container 
closure an integrity testing (CCIT) is proposed as release and stability testing. 
Container closure 
The container closure system for the tebentafusp finished product consists of a Type 1 glass vial closed 
with a bromobutyl, rubber stopper and secured with an aluminum overseal with a plastic flip-off cap. 
The primary packaging components of the vial and stopper are of compendial quality. Compatibility of 
the primary packaging materials with the finished product has been demonstrated by long-term and 
accelerated stability data.  
The secondary cardboard packaging protects the finished product from light as it is shown to be light 
sensitive.  
Comprehensive extractables and leachables studies have been performed on the CCS. All of the 
identified extractables and leachables are below the defined threshold permitted daily exposure (PDE) 
values. The proposed container closure system is adequate for the finished product.  
Compatibility 
The compatibility of the tebentafusp finished product with the infusion set and bag has been evaluated. 
The product is stable in a range of commercially available saline infusion bags with the addition of 
albumin (human serum) with a PVC infusion set. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture 
GMP compliance is confirmed for all relevant sites. 
The finished product manufacturing process is standard and consists of thawing of the active 
substance, pooling and mixing, sterile filtration, filling and capping, external washing of the vials, 
visual inspection and cold storage. The description is comprehensive and acceptable. 
Process controls 
The proposed controls are considered adequate. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 17/165 
 
 
 
 
Process validation 
The PPQ was performed on several commercial scale batches. The PPQ protocol specifies relevant tests 
in addition to the controls defined in sections 3.2.P.3.3 and 3.2.P.3.4: thawing time of the active 
substance, mixing time during compounding, hold time study of compounded active substance, hold 
time of first filled vials, filter and line flush, homogeneity during filling, CCIT, capping pressure. 
The submitted data demonstrate that the process is generally well controlled with little variation in the 
reported results. 
Equipment, utilities and sterilising processes were adequately qualified prior to the PPQ. Ongoing 
process verification and annual product review principles are described and follow relevant guidelines. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product specification includes general tests (visual inspection, appearance (color and 
clarity), pH, osmolality, extractable volume), test for identity, purity and impurity tests for product 
related impurities, test for protein content, potency and test for excipients, as well as tests for safety 
(visible particles, subvisible particulates, endotoxin and test for sterility/CCIT). 
Overall, the parameters included in the finished product specification are found adequate to control the 
quality of the tebentafusp finished product at release. The shelf-life specification has been provided 
and is clearly described and justified which tests are not to be performed during shelf-life.  
The justification of the acceptance criteria for tebentafusp finished product is based on batch data from 
several finished product batches manufactured representing the commercial manufacturing process.  
Overall, the approach to setting the acceptance criteria is in line with ICH Q6B.  
Batch Analysis 
Batch data are provided for several batches of the 0.2 mg/ml formulation using the proposed 
commercial process.  
All results are compliant with established limits and are consistent across the batches with an 
acceptable batch-to-batch variation. 
Characterisation of impurities  
The tebentafusp finished product is manufactured by thawing of the active substance, pooling and 
homogenisation, sterile filtration and aseptic filling into finished product vials. No formulation takes 
place during finished product manufacturing and hence the formulation of the finished product is 
identical to the active substance formulation. No new impurities are generated during the finished 
product manufacturing process and all impurities observed in the finished product were characterised 
for the active substance.  
The nitrosamine risk evaluation document has been provided and the nitrosamine risk is found 
negligible. 
The risk assessment of elemental impurities contamination from the components used for 
manufacturing of the active substance and finished product, has been provided. The outcome of the 
risk assessment, indicate that all elemental impurities are below the permitted daily exposure limits 
and no additional routine process testing or controls are deemed necessary. The assumptions used in 
the risk assessment were confirmed by testing three separate batches in line with ICH Q3D for 
elemental impurities content. This is acceptable.

Analytical procedures  
The suitability of the methods was demonstrated sufficiently. The analytical procedures used are the 
same as for active substance. The description and validation of these methods can be found in the 
active substance section.  
Reference standards  
The same reference standards used for the active substance analyses also apply to relevant analyses 
of finished product. Refer to the description of the reference standards in the active substance section. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
A shelf-life of 36 months when stored at 2°C to 8°C is claimed for the finished product. This is 
supported by the data presented. 
An in-use time of 4 hours at room temperature (below 30°C) or 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C is proposed in 
saline infusion bags prepared with human albumin. This is supported by the data presented. 
The protocols are in accordance with current guidelines.  
Generally, no unusual trends are observed at 5°C even if some parameters display a high degree of 
scatter. Slight increases of impurities and decrease of purity is observed and this is confirmed by the 
data at accelerated conditions. At accelerated conditions a decrease is also seen in activity. 
Furthermore, photostability and freeze/thaw studies have been conducted on the PPQ batches, 
showing that the tebentafusp finished product is light sensitive whereas, there is no measurable effect 
from up to 5 freeze/thaw cycles, including on container closure integrity. 
Due to the high dilutions of samples in the in-use stability studies and therefore low concentration of 
the tebentafusp finished product for administration, specific methods were used for the in-use stability 
studies. The qualification of these methods is found acceptable. 
Based on the stability data the shelf-life of 36 months when stored at 5°C ± 3°C claimed for the 
finished product is acceptable. 
After opening and from a microbiological point of view, once opened, the medicinal product should be 
diluted and infused immediately. After preparation of solution for infusion, chemical and physical in-use 
stability has been demonstrated for 4 hours at room temperature (below 30°C) or 24 hours at 2 °C to 
8 °C. From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
Non-viral agents. 
No animal or human derived raw materials are used for the manufacture of tebentafusp. Microbial 
purity and absence of bacteriophages is confirmed for the cell banks. The manufacturers have provided 
statements confirming that active substance and finished product are manufactured under conditions 
minimizing the risk of any BSE/TSE carry over. Supplier statements confirming TSE/BSE safety for 
contact materials are also provided. 
Testing is performed at appropriate stages during manufacture (IPC and/or release of active substance 
and finished product) for bioburden and endotoxin levels and for sterility.  
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 19/165 
 
 
 
The manufacture of finished product is performed under aseptic conditions in a controlled environment 
according to GMP. The risk of transmitting adventitious non-viral agents is considered negligible. 
Viral agents and mycoplasma 
As tebentafusp is manufactured in a prokaryotic recombinant E. coli cell line, the risk of propagating 
and transmitting adventitious viruses or mycoplasma to human beings from the product is negligible. 
In conclusion, tebentafusp is considered safe for use with regards to lack of risk for transmission of 
adventitious agents.

2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality part of the dossier presented in support of the marketing authorisation application (MAA) 
for Kimmtrak finished product is of adequate quality. The control strategy for the tebentafusp active 
substance manufacturing process was established in line with ICH Q11 guidance. Overall, the 
manufacturing process is considered adequately described and the applied process parameters and 
IPCs, as well as their ranges, and the control of starting materials are considered adequate to control 
the process and ensure formation of active substance of adequate and consistent quality.  
Overall, the approach taken to validate tebentafusp manufacturing process is considered adequate. 
The process is demonstrated to perform consistently and tebentafusp active substance meets all the 
biochemical, functional and microbiological acceptance criteria. The process development, including 
development of the control strategy, is overall considered adequately described and justified. A large 
number of thorough comparability studies have been made, confirming product comparability across 
sites, scales, and formulations.  
Overall, the approach to setting the acceptance criteria for both active substance and finished product 
specifications is in line with ICH Q6B and the acceptance criteria are found appropriate. 
The finished product manufacturing process is standard and consists of thawing of the active 
substance, pooling and mixing, sterile filtration, filling and capping, external washing of the vials, 
visual inspection and cold storage. Reprocessing is not performed. The description is comprehensive 
and acceptable. The submitted validation data demonstrate that the process is generally well controlled 
with little variation in the reported results. A shelf life of 36 months when stored at 2°C to 8°C is 
proposed for the finished product and this is supported by the data presented. 
It is concluded that, from a quality point of view, Kimmtrak finished product can be approved.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The overall quality of Kimmtrak is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
as defined in the SmPC.  
The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with 
existing guidelines. The manufacturing process of the active substance is adequately described, 
controlled and validated. The active substance is well characterised and appropriate specifications are 
set. The manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily described and validated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 20/165 
 
 
 
The quality of the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and specifications. 
Adventitious agents’ safety including TSE have been sufficiently assured. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommended some additional points for investigation. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The TCR domain of tebentafusp recognises a glycoprotein 100 (gp100) peptide fragment (YLEPGPVTA), 
a melanocyte-lineage antigen expressed exclusively in normal melanocytes and overexpressed on 
melanocytic tumours, when presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02:01 on the cell surface. 
Therefore, the anti-tumour activity of tebentafusp is restricted to patients with the HLA-A*02:01 allele. 
An immune synapse is formed when the TCR targeting domain of tebentafusp binds to UM cells and the 
CD3 effector domain binds to polyclonal T cells. This immune synapse results in redirection, 
proliferation, and activation of polyclonal T cells regardless of their native TCR specificity. Tebentafusp-
activated polyclonal T cells release inflammatory cytokines and cytolytic proteins, which result in direct 
lysis of UM tumour cells. In addition, tebentafusp-mediated lysis may prime an endogenous anti-
tumour immune response via epitope spreading. 
The tebentafusp soluble TCR targeting domain is highly specific for human gp100 peptide presented by 
human HLA-A*02:01. The tebentafusp anti-CD3 effector domain is specific for human CD3 and does 
not bind to or activate T cells from other species (Report IMC1029). Therefore, there are no relevant 
species in which tebentafusp pharmacology or toxicology can be tested, and the relevance of non-
human pharmacokinetic (PK) studies is considered limited. Extensive in vitro analysis was thus 
performed to characterize the pharmacologic activity of tebentafusp and assess its potential for toxicity 
in patients. Only one Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant human tissue cross-reactivity study 
was included in the submission. Since safety is evaluated in clinical studies including the on-target 
adverse effects on normal melanocytes e.g. in skin, new in vivo non-clinical studies to look for off-
target effects in animals not bearing the relevant targets appear redundant. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
Tebentafusp mode of action is well described and will be discussed further below. Tebentafusp 
demonstrates no reactivity against normal cells below 1 nM. This should be well above clinical 
exposure. However, towards normal melanocytes, tebentafusp show reactivity in the concentration 
range between 10 and 100 pM (0.01 -0.1 nM). In SmPC section 5.2, it is stated that Cmax immediately 
after end of infusion is 4.2 – 13.7 ng/mL, (below figure). Molecular weight is 77 kD. Hence, 1 nM 
corresponds to 77 ng/mL and e.g. 0.1 nM corresponds to 7.7 ng/mL providing a safety margin of 
7.7/13.7 = 0.5. Therefore it is not surprising that the most common adverse drug reactions in patients 
treated with Kimmtrak were cytokine release syndrome (89 %) and rash (grouped term; 83 %), which 
included blister, dermatitis, dermatitis acneiform, dermatitis allergic, dermatitis bullous, dermatitis 
contact, dermatosis, drug eruption, eczema, eczema eyelids, erythema multiforme, exfoliative rash, 
interstitial granulomatous dermatitis, lichenification, lichenoid keratosis, palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, papule, psoriasis, rash, rash erythematous, rash generalised, rash 
macular, rash maculo-papular, rash papular, rash pruritic, rash vesicular, seborrhoea, seborrhoeic

dermatitis, skin abrasion, skin erosion, skin exfoliation, skin irritation, skin plaque, solar dermatitis, 
toxic skin eruption, urticaria. 
Figure 2 Tebentafusp Concentrations (Geometric Mean Profile Plot of Log Scale [Cycle 1]) 
Tebentafusp Concentrations (Geometric Mean Profile Plot of Log Scale [Cycle 1]). Noncompartmental PK 
parameters were not derived in study IMCgp100-202 due to the limited PK sample collections. However, 
serum tebentafusp concentrations were summarised after the first dose and third dose in Cycle 1. After 
dosing with 20 mcg on C1D1, geometric mean concentrations reached 4,200 pg/mL and were undetectable 
prior to the subsequent QW dose. After the first dose of 68 mcg on C1D15, the geometric mean 
tebentafusp concentrations reached 13700 pg/mL, were undetectable by pre-dose C2D1. Subsequent, 
Cmax mean concentrations ranged from 10000 to 20000 pg/mL indicating no further accumulation of 
tebentafusp after C1D15. 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro Pharmacology 
By the use of surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore), it was shown that tebentafusp (also called 
IMCgp100) had very high affinity for the target gp100 on human leucocyte antigen (HLA-A*02:01). KD 
was 24 pM and t½ 27 hours as determined from 5 different batches of tebentafusp (Report IMC1022). 
In a similar manner the KD for CD3 was determined to 38 nM with a t½ of 8.4 minutes, a KD three 
orders of magnitude lower than for gp100. The bifunctional assay showed KD of 37 nM and half-life of 
11 minutes, hence the binding characteristics towards CD3 is the limiting factor of T-cell activation. 
Nevertheless, cellular functional assays show that tebentafusp activate T-cells at pM levels (IMC1014). 
Tebentafusp selectivity towards other subtypes of gp100 was evaluated using the Octet biosensor 
system (Report IMC1040). While the half-life was highest for the target subtype, other subtypes 
showed half-life in a similar order of magnitude e.g. A*02:05 (71% of subtype 1) and A*02:02 (68% 
of subtype 1). In vitro cellular assay showed that tebentafusp was four times less potent in T-cell 
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 22/165 
 
 
 
 
 
activation through A*02:02 than A*02:01 (Report 1061). Other subtypes showed lower or no T-cell 
activation compared to A*02:01. The potential clinical relevance and implications of showing T-cell 
activation through A*02:02 is considered low as it is very rare in the Western population.  
In functional cellular assays using CM, UM and artificially HLA-A*02:01 transduced cell lines, potent T-
cell activation was shown with EC50s in the pM range. T cell activation was determined by measuring 
IFNγ release, while T cell killing was determined by GrB release. Effector cells used in these studies 
were either PBMCs or purified CD8+ positive T cells from normal healthy donors (IMC1014, IMC1015, 
and IMC1061). 
Several studies evaluated mode of action of tebentafusp in cell based functional assays. 
Study IMC1014 indicate that tebentafusp induces engagement of non-tumour specific T cells with the 
target melanoma cell lines through detection of the early release cytokine IFNγ. Moreover, re-direction 
of non-tumour specific T cell by the IMCgp100 to recognise gp100 expressing melanoma cells results in 
killing of these target cells as measured by the release of Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) and the 
release of granzyme B. Granzyme B is a member of the Granzyme family of serine proteases which are 
located in the cytotoxic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Granzyme B is crucial for the rapid 
induction of target cell death by apoptosis via the activation of several caspases such as caspase-3 and 
caspase-7. Granzyme B can be considered a more direct measure of CTL killing than IFNγ as IFNγ 
secretion is not limited to cytolytic cells and is a marker of T cell activation only. 
Study IMC1015 show pM level potency of tebentafusp against several melanoma cell lines using LDH 
release as endpoint. 
Study IMC1016 show that tebentafusp induces caspase-3/7 release in a dose dependent manner. 
Caspase activity can be observed as early as 4 hours after contact of tebentafusp with the melanoma 
cell line, Mel526. Caspases are proteolytic enzymes that become activated during the process of 
apoptosis. 
Study IMC1061 indicate that tebentafusp may be more potent against uveal melanoma than cutaneous 
melanoma by comparing IFNγ-response of uveal and cutane melanoma cells presenting similar levels 
of HLA-A*02:01. 
Finally, study IMC1020 show that PBMCs in presence of tebentafusp are activated to release IFNγ, 
TNF-α, IL-2, IL-6 and MIP1β, when they engage with the HLA-A2+/gp100+ melanoma cell line 
MEL526. 
Similar experiments were performed using PBMCs from cancer patients. 
Study IMC1017 showed that PBMCs from both melanoma (stage 4) cancer patients are redirected in 
the presence of tebentafusp and their resultant activation can be measured through IFNγ and 
Granzyme B release. Potency of tebentafusp appeared to be similar to when using PBMCs from healthy 
donors (pM range). 
Study IMC1046 describes the use of PBMCs obtained from patients enrolled in cohort 6 of the Phase I 
study of IMCgp100/01. These PBMCs were used as effector cells within in vitro experiments to examine 
the kinetics of redirected killing of gp100+/HLA-A*0201+ melanoma cells (Mel624) using a clinically 
relevant dose of tebentafusp (81 pM). The results show that patient PBMCs can be efficiently redirected 
to kill melanoma tumour cells. However, one donor showed efficient killing of target cells within 12 
hours and continued until the end of the assay at 60 hours, whereas the other donor plateaued at a 
low level of killing after 10 hours. Naturally, tebentafusp is only indicated in HLA-A*02:01 positive 
patients as specified in the SmPC.

Study IMC1018 show that hydrocortisone can inhibit the T cell activation induced by high 
concentrations of tebentafusp in a dose dependent manner. 
Study IMC1019 evaluated the specificity of tebentafusp towards gp100 and CD3 using soluble proteins 
to inhibit synapse formation. Soluble gp100 could completely inhibit T cell activation at highest 
concentrations tested with an IC50 of 0.3 nM. Soluble CD3 showed only partially inhibited T cell 
activation at the highest concentration (0.5 µM). Nevertheless, evidence of relevant tumour-targeting 
effect is shown in clinical trials. 
Study IMC1027 indicate that the terminally differentiated CD8+ effector memory and central memory 
cells were the major responders to tebentafusp in the presence of gp100 presenting target cells. Naïve 
T cells exhibited an insignificant response. 
Study IMC1045 describes the kinetics of killing exerted by PBMC, CD8+ and CD4+ T cells 
subpopulations (Total, Tem, Tcm, Temra and naïve T cells) when redirected against melanoma cells 
using tebentafusp. The kinetics of killing appear to depend on the effector cells used. In this assay, 
PBMC killing kinetics show a lag of 22 hours before apoptotic events start to appear, reaching a 
maximum around 48 h. This correlates in broad terms with timing of cytokine release syndrome in 
patients. 
Furthermore, tebentafusp redirects CD4+ T cells as well as CD8+ T cells to kill gp100+ melanoma 
cells. Killing by tebentafusp-redirected CD4+ T cells appear to be delayed compared to CD8+ T cells 
but was still very efficient and potent in this study. 
The different CD4+ and CD8+ T cells subpopulations showed different kinetics and efficiency of killing. 
In both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, T effector subsets were the most efficient and fast killers. 
Study 1047 show that T regulatory cells, when co-incubated with CD8+ T cells have no impact on the 
efficacy of tebentafusp. 
Hence, the efficiency and velocity of tebentafusp in redirecting T cells towards killing gp100 expressing 
tumour cells very much depend on the status and profile of the T cell population in each patient at the 
time of treatment, although it appears that the Treg cell have limited negative impact on the sought 
effects of tebentafusp. 
Study IMC1030 suggests that tebentafusp mediated T cell activation is dependent on the level of 
gp100 presentation on the surface of target cells. Significant activation of CD8+ T cells was observed 
at a concentration of peptide used to pulse T2 cells of 10-9 M corresponding to approximately 18 
epitopes per cell. At lower concentrations of peptide used to pulse T2 cells, the level of T cell activation 
was low indicating a minimum threshold of antigen presentation is needed for robust T cell activation. 
applicant states that the melanoma cell lines used for functional assays exceeds these requirements 
and clinical trials show that gp100 is targeted in both uveal melanoma tumours and normal 
melanocytes in vivo. 
Study IMC-MED-201-03 indicate that tremelimumab (an immune checkpoint blocker) may enhance the 
redirecting effect on T-cells of tebentafusp, however no statistical evaluation was presented to support 
this. 
In vivo Pharmacology 
One in vivo pharmacology study was included in the submission. In this study Beige/SCID mice were 
inoculated with the cutaneous melanoma cell line Mel526 mixed with human PBMC from healthy 
donors. Mice in group 3, 4, 5 and 6 were treated for 5 days with tebentafusp at varying dose levels. 
Group 7 was administered a control protein not binding to CD3. Group 1 was inoculated only with the 
melanoma cell line and group 2 with both the cell line and PBMC. Delay in tumour take and tumour

growth was observed for group 4 (0.04 mg/kg/day) and 5 (0.01 mg/kg/day). Dose-response appear to 
be bell shaped, since the two mid doses showed the highest degree of delay in tumour take and 
tumour growth. The dose of 0.01 mg/kg/day corresponds to a human equivalent dose of 0.8 
µg/kg/day for 5 days. This could be compared to the maintenance dose of 68 µg/week in patients (for 
a 50 kg patient = 1.36 µg/kg/week), which is not far off the dose in mice. However, it should be noted 
that, a single dose PK study in C57BL/6 or SCID mice show higher serum concentrations at this active 
dose in the in vivo pharmacology study (0.01 mg/kg/day) than patients (Cmax 4.2 -13.7 ng/mL), see 
Table 3.3.3. It should be noted that serum concentrations in mice were comparable to patients at the 
dose 0.001 mg/kg, a dose lower than the lowest dose included in the in vivo study, which is not 
anticipated to show significant beneficial effect. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Since, tebentafusp is specific for human gp100 and CD3 with no affinity to e.g. monkey, rat or mice, 
secondary and safety pharmacology was evaluated using in vitro methods on human tissues and cells.. 
The engineered T cell receptor on tebentafusp is highly specific for gp100, however at higher 
concentration this selectivity is lost. Evaluation of potential off target tissues was performed using the 
functional readouts IFNγ and Granzyme B. The applicant has chosen a panel of normal human tissue 
cells targeting the main organ functions, that cannot be assessed in animal toxicology studies, to 
determine the potential reactivity of tebentafusp with these selected normal tissues (Reports IMC1001 
to IMC1013). A limit of clinical relevance was set at 1 nM. Only astrocytes and as expected epidermal 
melanocytes showed activity at tebentafusp concentrations below 1 nM. 
With regard to normal astrocytes, 1 out of five lots showed functional activity in presence of 
tebentafusp (IMC1001).  
Tebentafusp showed reactivity towards normal melanocytes expressing gp100 using readouts of INFγ 
and Granzyme B in 5 out of 5 lots. Study IMC1012 showed a generally lower reactivity of tebentafusp 
for normal melanocytes than for a melanoma cell line. Two of the normal epidermal melanocyte lots 
reacted even stronger than the melanoma cell line in the Granzyme B assay (N10 and N13). This is 
also the case in study IMC1055 for IFNγ for N10. These findings correlate with the high incidence of 
adverse reactions in the skin of patients (SmPC). 
Tebentafusp is apparently not showing alloreactivity (IMC1021, IMC1057) as shown by testing an 
expanded alloreactivity panel of human Class 1 HLA genotypes expected to be HLA-A*02:01-positive.  
Studies IMC1023 (whole blood) and IMC1024 (platelets) show that tebentafusp is not interfering with 
CD3+ T cells or platelets in whole blood in the absence of target cells in peripheral blood leading to 
release of cytokines. 
The immune check point inhibitors tremelimumab and durvalumab appeared not to enhance the effect 
of tebentafusp on T-cell activation using IFNγ as endpoint against normal melanocytes (IMC-MED-201-
02) including the most sensitive lot N13. Moreover, the two immune check point inhibitors did not 
enhance cytokine release in whole blood administered in combinations with tebentafusp at clinically 
relevant concentrations (IMC-MED-201-01), except slightly in a few cases, which are not expected to 
significantly increase the already known risk of cytokine release syndrome in patients during treatment 
with tebentafusp. 
A thorough efficacy and safety assessment was performed in order to assure similarity of potency and 
specificity between 7 different batches of tebentafusp including GMP batches of drug product 
(IMC1055). The assessment was performed in line with previous functional assays using cell lines, 
human tissue cells and whole blood with cytokines as end-points. All 7 lots of tebentafusp reacted in a 
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 25/165 
 
 
 
similar manner in all assays. In this report a direct comparison between a cutane melanoma cell line 
Mel624 and the normal epidermal melanocyte lot N10 was performed. It appears, that this time, the 
normal melanocyte cells show higher/similar reactivity in the presence of tebentafusp as compared to 
the cutaneous melanoma cell line.  
An impurity of tebentafusp with less specificity was qualified by comparing a spiked formulation of 
tebentafusp (6.7 % impurity) with one or two reference batches in functional cellular assays. 
Furthermore, representative analysis of several batches of tebentafusp showed that only one batch had 
above 1% of this impurity (1.1%). Hence, these data may prepare a basis for a specification for the 
specific impurity but not the overall total purity. This issue is discussed in Module 3. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology studies were not conducted for tebentafusp. Tebentafusp is a human specific 
protein and does not bind proteins from nonhuman species. Therefore, there are no relevant species in 
which tebentafusp pharmacology or toxicology can be tested. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies of tebentafusp were not conducted. Tebentafusp is a human 
specific protein and does not bind proteins from nonhuman species. Therefore, there are no relevant 
species in which tebentafusp pharmacology or toxicology can be tested. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions have been evaluated in functional cellular assays with 
hydrocortisone and immune check point inhibitors tremelimumab and durvalumab (previous section). 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of Analysis 
No toxicokinetic studies were undertaken with tebentafusp. Hence, no bioanalytical studies had to be 
conducted to GLP. One explorative PK study of tebentafusp in C57BL/6 mice were conducted using a 
bioanalytical method employing the electro-chemiluminescens (ECL) immunoassay format, with 
biotinylated HLA-A*02-gp100 antigen used to capture tebentafusp in serum samples. After incubation 
with the analyte, a goat anti-scFv antibody was used followed by detection with a SULFO-TAG™ 
conjugated donkey anti-goat antibody in order to be selective for the intact tebentafusp protein. The 
unit for the immunoassay was ng/mL. Method development, partial validation and sample analysis 
were carried out at York Bioanalytical Solutions, York, UK. LLOQ of the immune assay was later 
changed to 200 pg/mL due to challenges of sensitivity (validated range: 200-10000 pg/mL). 
The remainder of the pharmacokinetic studies were using 3H-labeled and the biodistribution study 125I-
labeled tebentafusp. The unit for the PK studies using 3H-labeled tebentafusp was ng equivalents/g and 
for the biodistribution study using 125I ng equivalents/g. Hence, radiochemical methods were used and 
were therefore not selective for the intact protein, although bioanalysis was considered state of the art. 
Absorption 
The pharmacokinetics of tebentafusp after single dose intravenous administration was evaluated in 
male C57BL/6 mice. One study used un-labelled tebentafusp (C85954, YCZ006, Report IMC1028) and 
one study 3H-labeled tebentafusp (IMCgp100 or 3H-IMCgp100). Hence, immunoassay could be 
compared to radiochemical analysis. The immunoassay appeared not to be as sensitive as the 
radiochemical method. Therefore, tebentafusp could only be detected out to 12 hours after dosing 
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 26/165 
 
 
 
(LLOQ = 200 pg/mL), when using immunoassay, whereas the radiochemical analysis could follow 
tebentafusp related radioactivity at similar dose levels out to 72 hours after dosing, see Table 2. The 
reported terminal half-lives reflect this discrepancy as the immunoassay report half-lives of 1.7 to 2.4 
hours, whereas the radiochemical analysis report half-lives of 65.6 to 92.6 hours. It should be noted 
that the 3H-label of tebentafusp can undergo renal reuptake as small peptides after tebentafusp 
degradation and may not reflect true half-life of tebentafusp. However, it is reassuring to see that 
AUCs were in a similar range when comparing the use of the two bioanalytical methods. The terminal 
half-life of tebentafusp in patients is reported to be 6-8 hours (SmPC) using a similar assay format as 
for the mouse study of unlabelled tebentafusp, but with LLOQ of 25 pg/mL (Pop PK Report). 3H-labelled 
tebentafusp was also administered subcutaneously and showed bioavailability of 40% compared to 
intravenous administration at the same dose level of 0.05 mg/kg. Time for maximal serum 
concentration was 2 hours Cmax was 93.6 ng/mL. Across the dose range of 0.001 to 0.1, C0 and AUC 
were dose proportional after intravenous administration in the mouse. 
Single and repeat -dose pharmacokinetics was also evaluated in the in vivo pharmacology model of the 
SCID mouse at 0.01 mg/kg, the dose of the optimal pharmacological effect. When comparing half-life 
to single dose PK studies of un-labelled and 3H-labelled tebentafusp, half-life of tebentafusp in the 
unlabelled study fits with t½α and t½β correlates with the half-life reported for the 3H-labelled 
tebentafusp. Hence, PK of tebentafusp in female SCID mice appear to behave similarly to male 
C57BL/6 mice. It should be mentioned that clearance was higher and AUC was lower after 5 days of 
repeat dosing and this was by the applicant attributed to possibly be due to ADAs, which however was 
not analysed for in this study (IM-CH-01-10).

Distribution 
Preclinical biodistribution studies using 125I-radiolabeled tebentafusp and a non-gp100 binding protein 
as negative control administered to tumour-bearing severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mice 
were conducted to establish potential non-specific tissue toxicity risks and tumour targeting proof of 
concept, see Figure 3.4.1. The biodistribution was carried out as both single and repeat dose (daily, 
over 5 days) studies (IM-CH-01-09, single dose and IM-CH-01-10, repeat-dose, GLP). 
Preclinical biodistribution studies demonstrated:

• 
• 
• 
Tebentafusp was retained in the melanoma tumour for a significantly longer timeframe with a 
half-life of binding the tumour of approximately 24 hours, see Figure 3.   
Tebentafusp did not accumulate in the brain.  
Tebentafusp accumulation in the highly vascular organs such as heart, lungs, liver and kidney 
was rapidly cleared between 8 and 24 hours. Furthermore, this may represent residual 
circulating 125I-radiolabeled tebentafusp as there was no flush step after exsanguination prior 
to analysis.  
•  Accumulation was observed in the thyroid, peaking between the 24 and 72 hours, and likely 
represents an accumulation of free 125I. A similar observation was noted for the digestive tract 
(stomach, small intestine and colon), although smaller in magnitude, peaking at 24 hours 
before clearance at 48 hours. The original report also suggested this as an elimination route, 
however, this is unclear since it is widely reported in literature that gastric mucosa is a site 
where iodide naturally accumulates.  
• 
There was little difference for biodistribution of 125I-radiolabeled tebentafusp between single 
and daily repeat doses.

Table 3. Values of half-life for organs and tissues sampled following 125I-tebentafusp 
injection (IM-CH-01-09) 
Two distribution studies were conducted in tumour-bearing (Mel526) severe combined immune 
deficiency (SCID) mice. Mice were administered either 125I-tebentafusp (125I-mTCR1) or a non-gp100-
binding fusion protein (125I-mTCR2). Radioactivity was followed in blood, serum and a list of major 
organs including thyroid and brain for 168 hours. Radioactivity was similar between serum and blood 
indicating that tebentafusp is not binding to red cells. As expected, for both fusion proteins, 125I 
accumulated in the thyroid. Unforeseen, tebentafusp accumulated in the intestinal system.  
Metabolism 
No specific studies were conducted to study tebentafusp metabolism as classical drug metabolic 
elimination does not represent an important clearance mechanism for large proteins (monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs), fusion proteins, etc.).  
Excretion 
Tebentafusp biodistribution studies also looked for radioactivity in the urine and feces of the mice. 
Results indicated that there was less than 10% radioactivity of the injected dose found in feces over 
seven days, 8% of this found in the first 24 hours. Urine analysis showed approximately 90% 
radioactivity with most in the first 24 hours. The excreted material was not analyzed for the presence 
of intact tebentafusp or metabolites, and the radioactivity may represent elimination of liberated 125I. 
It is widely reported that elimination of fusion proteins and mAbs occur via intracellular catabolism 
through receptor mediated endocytosis and subsequent degradation by lysosomes (Chen et al 2012, 
Ovacik and Lin 2018). Non-specific clearance through the liver via uptake by macrophages and 
endothelial cells and subsequent catabolism may also play a role, however this is not considered to be 
a significant elimination pathway for fusion proteins (Chen et al 2012).

Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions 
No specific drug–drug interactions studies were conducted for tebentafusp. Tebentafusp is a fusion 
protein and is not metabolised by Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes or transported by P-
glycoprotein (Pgp) or related ABC membrane transporters. Cytokines produced by activated 
lymphocytes may impact the levels of Pgp and the activity of CYP450 enzymes (Harvey 2014). 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies were performed for tebentafusp. Tebentafusp is a human specific 
protein and does not bind proteins from nonhuman species. Therefore, there are no relevant species in 
which tebentafusp pharmacology or toxicology can be tested. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
No repeat dose toxicity studies were performed for tebentafusp. Tebentafusp is a human specific 
protein and does not bind proteins from nonhuman species. Therefore, there are no relevant species in 
which tebentafusp pharmacology or toxicology can be tested. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Genetic toxicology studies were not conducted for tebentafusp in accordance with the ICH S6 guidance. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies were not conducted for tebentafusp in accordance with ICH S6 and ICH S9 
guidance. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No animal developmental and reproductive toxicity studies were performed for tebentafusp. 
Due to the specificity for human targets, embryo-fetal development (EFD) studies cannot be conducted 
in nonclinical species. Therefore, a weight of evidence assessment was conducted to evaluate the risk 
of tebentafusp administration on pregnancy and embryo-fetal development. A literature search 
revealed that gp100 is expressed embryonically in melanocytes found in the skin, inner ear, and eyes 
by 7 weeks of gestation, and MHC Class I classical proteins (including HLA-A*02:01) and transporter-
associated-with-antigen-processing (TAP) proteins required for presentation of antigen on the cell 
surface are expressed very early in embryonic development. In addition, CD3+T cells begin to populate 
the periphery and are capable of being activated by around 12 weeks of gestation. 
2.5.4.6.  Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance studies were not conducted for tebentafusp. Tebentafusp is a human specific protein 
and does not bind proteins from nonhuman species. Therefore, there are no relevant species in which 
tebentafusp pharmacology or toxicology can be tested. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 30/165 
 
 
 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Tebentafusp is thought to undergo target-mediated clearance from the plasma via interaction with 
target HLA-A2/gp100 peptide on melanoma cells and CD3+ lymphocytes, followed by intracellular 
catabolism to its constituent amino acids. As such, elimination of intact biologically active protein is not 
expected. Under the European Medicines Agency Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(CHMP) Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 Corr 2) and the guidance in Questions and Answers on Guideline on the 
Environmental Risk Assessment for Human Use (EMA/CHMP/SWP/22609/2010), a fusion protein such 
as tebentafusp is unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment and can be exempt from 
environmental fate and effects testing, as such biopharmaceuticals are considered unlikely to be 
released, or readily degrade resulting in minimal risk to the environment. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Tebentafusp is specific for human targets on both ends (CD3 for the T cell and gp100, which is 
enriched in melanoma cells and normal melanocytes). Gp100 is presented by peptide–human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA) complexes. In this case HLA-A*02:01. 
The pharmacology of tebentafusp appears to be well-understood. In vitro studies using cell lines of 
cutaneous melanomas and a few uveal melanomas were used along with typically PBMCs from healthy 
donors as a source of T cells show relevant effect at pM concentrations. However, tebentafusp also 
show reactivity towards normal melanocytes as clinical trials also show, adverse effects related to the 
skin occur in close to 90% of the patients. In vitro studies suggest some safety margin between the 
two cell types, however not convincing. When comparing serum concentrations in patients just after 
infusion with EC50 in normal melanocytes, the safety margin is below 1. All in all, in vitro proof of 
concept can be accepted. Specifically, this is by observing tebentafusp as a mediator of immune 
synapses and thereby by several immune cascade mechanisms inducing killing of gp100 presenting 
melanoma cell lines in the presence of PBMCs or isolated T cells from healthy human donors. 
It is reassuring that it was possible to present a study of in vivo proof of concept although the cell line 
used is not a uveal melanoma cell line, but a cutaneous cell line. 
Tebentafusp also show some T cell activation through the human leucocyte complex subtype A*02:02. 
The clinical relevance of this finding appears to be low. 
The reactivity with astrocytes was deemed a low clinical risk because of i) lack of gp100 expression in 
these cell lots, ii) variable and infrequent nature of the reactivity observed in these studies, iii) the nM 
concentration at which reactivity was observed with this single astrocyte lot was above the anticipated 
clinical concentration range for tebentafusp, and iv) tebentafusp is a large biologic entity of 
approximately 76 kDa which might not be expected to penetrate the CNS. Dizziness and paresthesia 
was observed as adverse event in the clinical trials. However, these effects are not deemed related to 
CNS toxicity, but rather secondary to CRS and skin reactions. 
Study IMC1018 showed that hydrocortisone can inhibit the T cell activation induced by high 
concentrations of tebentafusp in a dose dependent manner. Specific recommendations for 
corticosteroid rescue medication to relieve CRS and acute skin reactions are found in SmPC section 
4.2.  
PBMCs from two cancer patients were employed in a functional assay using a cutaneous melanoma cell 
line. In this study, the dynamics of the T cell activation was very different between the two patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 31/165 
 
 
 
Nevertheless, at least adverse effects of CRS and acute skin reactions occurred in approximately 90% 
of the patients. Hence, most patients can be expected to respond to the treatment. Studies of which 
types of T cells are capable of targeting the melanoma cells, indicated that the terminally differentiated 
CD8+ effector memory and central memory cells were the major responders to tebentafusp in the 
presence of gp100 presenting target cells. Naïve T cells exhibited an insignificant response. 
The applicant acknowledged that toxicities related to the skin are expected but stated that the data 
indicate that a therapeutic index of approximately 10 (1 versus 10 pM) was observed. 
High incidence of AEs related to the skin is well documented in the clinical trials but appear to be 
manageable. The high incidence is therefore consistent with these in vitro data. 
One in vivo animal (Beige/SCID) study was presented. Here, tebentafusp induced reduced tumour take 
and tumour growth compared to control, although by showing bell-shaped dose-response. Moreover, 
the exposure showing beneficial effects was higher as compared to patients. However, there is no 
doubt that effects (beneficial and adverse) are observed in clinical trials, hence the animal model 
(SCID mouse) is probably not predictive in terms of level of exposure providing reductions in tumour 
volume in patients. 
Safety pharmacology was also evaluated in functional in vitro assays using cell types from different 
human tissues. The only tissues showing reactivity in the presence of tebentafusp was astrocytes and 
melanocytes. All 5 lots of melanocytes showed high reactivity as was expected, however one lot of 
astrocytes also showed some activity. This is not considered clinically relevant as no adverse effects 
were observed in the clinical trials, which could be related to CNS toxicity. 
In the safety pharmacology studies using normal melanocytes, some lots appeared to induce even 
stronger reactivity of T cells in the presence of tebentafusp as compared to cutaneous melanoma cell 
lines. However, overall, in vitro data correlates with clinical data, as acute skin reactions are very 
common (>90%).  
Pharmacokinetics 
Single and repeat-dose pharmacokinetics was evaluated in both Beige/SCID mouse and two strains of 
normal mice using non-labelled and 3H-labeled tebentafusp. It appears that the radiolabelled 
tebentafusp, by having lower LLOQ, show a very long terminal half-life. This could however be an 
artefact, since this is not observed in the clinical trials in which a more sensitive bioanalytical method 
was used. 
Distribution studies were conducted in tumour bearing SCID mice using 125I-tebentafusp. However, the 
distribution appeared to be more or less controlled by the 125I-portion of the molecule. Therefore, 
these studies are considered of limited value. Unforeseen, tebentafusp accumulated in the intestinal 
system. However, this may be artifactual due to the iodine label, since iodine naturally accumulates 
here. With regard to accumulation in the tumour, this appeared not to be very much higher than in 
other organs at 72 hours, when the tumour/blood ratio is at its highest (2.762). Actually at 72 hours 
the highest concentrations were found in stomach and ratios above 1 was also found for liver, kidney, 
spleen and colon. Moreover, at 168 hours, radioactivity/g appear to be lower than in e.g. the spleen 
and less than double of the liver and blood. Hence, the wanted accumulation in the melanoma-tumour 
is not considered convincing from the data in these studies of 125I-labelled tebentafusp. When reading 
through reports on the distribution studies, no clear comparison between the distribution data of the 
gp100 binding and the negative control fusion proteins could be found in terms of tumour take or 
major organs, except that it was stated that the negative control is cleared more slowly and that the 
amount in the tumour is half that of tebentafusp at 24 hours. A discussion of the differences and 
similarities between the tissue distribution of tebentafusp and the negative control protein not binding 
gp100 is therefore not considered fulfilling. All in all, the quantitative predictivity of the 125I-labelled 
Assessment report

proteins is questioned in these distribution studies, therefore these issues will not be further pursued. 
125I-labelling was used, since 14C-labelling of tebentafusp was not considered feasible, as this would 
require that 14C was supplied as nutrient (e.g. 14C-glucose) during biosynthesis for the specific activity 
to become sufficiently high for use in distribution studies.  
No specific studies were conducted to study tebentafusp metabolism as classical drug metabolic 
elimination does not represent an important clearance mechanism for large proteins. Since tebentafusp 
is a human fusion protein specific for human targets, classical drug metabolism studies are not deemed 
necessary. The following wording is presented in SmPC section 5.2: The metabolic pathway of 
tebentafusp has not been characterised. Like other protein therapeutics, tebentafusp is expected to be 
degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways. 
Excretion of 125I-labelled tebentafusp was evaluated in the biodistribution study (IM-CH-01-10). The 
value of the study in terms of excretion is considered limited as proteins are normally catabolised and 
it was not determined if the radioactivity represented intact, metabolised tebentafusp or free 125iodine. 
In SmPC section 5.2 Pharmacokinetics, the following wording is presented: The excretion of 
tebentafusp is not fully characterised. This is considered acceptable from a non-clinical point of view. 
Cytokine release syndrome is the most important adverse reaction for tebentafusp. The following 
wording is presented in SmPC section 4.5:  
No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with tebentafusp. 
Initiation of KIMMTRAK treatment causes transient release of cytokines that may suppress CYP450 
enzymes. The highest drug-drug interaction risk is during the first 24 hours of the first three doses of 
KIMMTRAK in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates, particularly those with a 
narrow therapeutic index. In these patients, monitor for toxicity (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentrations 
(e.g., cyclosporine). Adjust the dose of the concomitant drug as needed. 
Toxicology 
A thorough weight of evidence evaluation of the of tebentafusp was presented. Tebentafusp’s ability to 
directly affect embryo-fetal development requires that tebentafusp crosses the placenta and gains 
access to the fetus. The molecular weight of tebetafusp is 77 kDa, therefore, it is much too large to 
cross the placenta by diffusion. It also does not contain an Fc domain and, therefore, cannot bind to 
the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which facilitates transfer of IgG molecules across the placenta, nor 
does it have domains that could bind to other placental transporters. Thus, tebentafusp would not be 
able to gain access to or elicit pharmacologic activity directly in the embryo/fetus. There is also no 
evidence that tebentafusp could interfere with implantation or the maintenance of pregnancy through 
its mechanism of action. 
Based on the results of this weight of evidence assessment, tebentafusp would not be expected to 
adversely affect embryo-fetal development or the maintenance of pregnancy when administered during 
pregnancy. The reproductive toxicity potential is considered low, since tebentafusp is not likely to be 
able to cross the placenta. According to literature (Bowman, 2012) nonFc containing 
biopharmaceuticals can be secreted into breastmilk, however absorption over neonatal gut is 
considered unlikely due to proteolytic degradation. 
An apparently well-designed tissue cross reactivity study was hampered by very poor sensitivity of the 
IHC method, which could not even detect gp100 in normal melanocytes. Therefore, this study 
unfortunately, is considered of limited value. 
The active substance is a protein that undergoes catabolism to peptides and amino-acids in the body. 
Therefore, tebentafusp is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Tebentafusp is a bispecific fusion protein, comprised of a T cell receptor (TCR; targeting domain) fused 
to an antibody fragment targeting CD3 (cluster of differentiation 3; effector domain). The TCR end 
binds with high affinity to a gp100 peptide presented by human leukocyte antigen – A*02:01 (HLA-
A*02:01) on the cell surface of uveal melanoma tumor cells, and the effector domain binds to the CD3 
receptor on the polyclonal T cell. An immune synapse is formed when the TCR targeting domain of 
tebentafusp binds to uveal melanoma cells and the CD3 effector domain binds to polyclonal T cells. 
This immune synapse results in redirection and activation of polyclonal T cells regardless of their native 
TCR specificity. Tebentafusp-activated polyclonal T cells release inflammatory cytokines and cytolytic 
proteins, which result in direct lysis of uveal melanoma tumour cells. As tebentafusp is a human-
specific protein, there are no relevant animal species in which non-clinical toxicology of tebentafusp 
could be tested. No carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, or developmental and reproductive toxicity studies 
have been conducted with tebentafusp. This is acceptable. In conclusion, from a non-clinical point of 
view, Kimmtrak is eligible for marketing authorisation.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
Tebentafusp (also known as IMCgp100) is a 77 kDa bispecific protein comprised of an affinity-
enhanced soluble T cell receptor domain fused to an anti-cluster of differentiation 3 single-chain 
variable fragment for treatment of unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma. The recommended 
dose administered to patients intravenously is 20 mcg on Day 1, 30 mcg on Day 8, and 68 mcg on Day 
15 and weekly thereafter. In clinical studies, tebentafusp was being developed in two formulations with 
different concentrations, 0.5 mg/mL and 0.2 mg/mL.  
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
The concentrations of tebentafusp in human serum were determined using an indirect sandwich 
immunoassay on the Meso Scale Discovery platform. Immunogenicity was tested using a homogenous

Page 35/165 
 
 
 
 
bridging electrochemiluminescence method and a tiered approach for screening, confirmation and titre 
determination of ADAs against tebentafusp. 
Concentration data from three tebentafusp studies (Study IMCgp100-01, IMCgp100-102 and 
IMCgp100-202) in patients with melanoma were described by a 2-compartment population PK model 
with intravenous input and linear clearance. Renal function and high titre ADA’s were identified as 
significant covariates for CL. The population PK dataset contained 5642 measurable PK samples from 
587 patients (ITT population). The number of BLQ values were 3592 out of 9235 concentration 
records. The BLQ data were retained in the dataset but excluded from model development. 
Table 4.Population Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
RSEs of the parameter estimates for the final model (Run #515) were low <10% except for V2 
(79.9%). The IIV had CV% <15% for all parameters except for CL (46.9%). Eta Shrinkage was not 
given. The distribution (CIs) of parameter estimates were not given and the model was not validated 
e.g. by bootstrap. The final model showed large distributions of CWRES vs PRED.

The final PK model was updated by adding a temporal effect of ADA titre >8192 as a categorical 
variable to further explore the effect of ADA on clearance. High titre ADA was retained as a significant 
covariate in the updated model (run 618.lst). Parameter estimates and GoF plots were provided (See 
below table and Figures). Shrinkage was rather high for V2 and CL, 34.3% and 47.1%, respectively.

Using the updated model (Run #618), additional VPCs stratified by study with expanded view of the 
first 60 days of treatment were provided to emphasize the intra-patient dose escalation and expected 
steady-state at the target dose (68 mcg) over the first several weeks of treatment (data not shown).  
Analysis of tebentafusp Cmax stratified by ADA titre quartiles revealed that patients with ADA titre 
>1:8192 demonstrated persistent reduced peak concentrations of tebentafusp across studies 102 and 
202 (Figures 39 and 6).

There was no formal E-R modelling. The exposure response relations were evaluated by graphical 
analyses using Kaplan-Meier curves, box plots or scatter plots. Exposure expressed as Cmax and Cavg 
after the first (20 mcg) and third (50-68 mcg) doses in Cycle 1 were derived using the final Pop PK 
model. The effect of tebentafusp exposure were evaluated against Cmax and Cavg values or against 
exposure quartiles. 
Absorption  
Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) reached 4.2 ng/mL - 13.7 ng/mL immediately at the end of 
infusion (T = 0.5 hours) in study 202. The product is intended for intravenous administration and the 
bioavailability is therefore 100%. 
Distribution 
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 40/165 
 
 
 
 
 
The estimated central volume of distribution of tebentafusp in melanoma patients was 5.25 L. This is 
derived from the Pop PK model as no dedicated clinical pharmacology studies were conducted. 
Elimination 
The excretion of tebentafusp is not fully characterised. It is expected tebentafusp as fusion protein to 
be degraded through receptor mediated endocytosis and subsequent degradation by lysosomes (Chen 
et al 2012, Ovacik and Lin 2018). The size-selective cut-off for glomerular filtration is approximately 
60 kDa (Meibohm and Zhou 2012). While intact tebentafusp is not likely to be efficiently eliminated via 
renal CL given its size of 77 kDa, PK model covariate assessment demonstrated slightly reduced CL in 
the presence of reduced eGFR. This suggests passive glomerular filtration may also play a minor role in 
the elimination of tebentafusp.  
Following administration of tebentafusp in metastatic uveal melanoma patients, the estimated systemic 
clearance was 4.33 L/d, with a terminal half-life of 6-8 hours. 
The metabolic pathway of tebentafusp has not been characterised. Protein (monoclonal antibodies 
(mAbs), fusion proteins, etc.) metabolic elimination does not represent an important clearance 
mechanism. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In study 102 the increase in geometric mean PK exposure (Cmax) of tebentafusp was approximately 
dose proportional between the 20mcg dose administered on C1D1 and the 68mcg dose administered 
on C1D15. From the dose escalation data, the observed terminal t1/2 was 6.8 to 7.5 hours. 
Subsequent mean Cmax values after C1D15 ranged from 10000 to 20000 pg/mL, and mean pre-dose 
concentrations were undetectable, indicating no accumulation with QW dosing at the 68mcg dose 
(Figure 11).

Figure 11. Tebentafusp Mean Concentration Versus Time Profile Cycle 1 Day 15 (Safety 
Analysis Set) 
In study 202, after dosing with 20 mcg on C1D1, geometric mean concentrations reached 4,200 pg/mL 
and were undetectable prior to the subsequent QW dose. After the first dose of 68 mcg on C1D15, the 
geometric mean tebentafusp concentrations reached 13700 pg/mL but tebentafusp were undetectable 
by pre-dose C2D1. Subsequent, Cmax mean concentrations ranged from 10000 to 20000 pg/mL 
indicating no further accumulation of tebentafusp after C1D15 (Figure 12 and Figure 13).

Cycles]) 
The inter-individual variation in CL and Vd is around 80 and 30%, respectively. Intra-patient variability 
in tebentafusp Cmax values for patients who received at least 2 IV infusions at the 68 mcg target dose 
in Studies 102 and 202 was a mean %CV of 63.5% and 62.6% for all patients in Studies 102 and 202, 
respectively. Excluding patients with ADA titre >8192, the %CV was 45.5% across both studies while 
in patients with ADA titre >8192, the %CV for Cmax was 160% because high titre ADA contributed to 
higher clearance and therefore contributed to greater Cmax variability.

Special populations 
No studies in special populations were conducted. A population PK analysis was used to identify 
potential significant covariates affecting tebentafusp PK. Only body weight and eGFR were identified as 
significant covariate on tebentafusp clearance in the presented final model. 
Estimated tebentafusp CL slightly decreased (3.32 L/d) in patients with moderate renal impairment 
(eGFR ranging from 30 to 59 mL/min). High interpatient variability was observed (78 %CV) and CL 
values in renal impaired patients were essentially within the range observed in patients with normal 
renal function. No impact on safety or efficacy parameters was identified in patients with mild to 
moderate renal impairment and no dose adjustments are recommended. There is no information 
available in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min).  
Tebentafusp is 77 kDa protein. The size cut-off for glomerular filtration being comprised between 60-
70 kDa, tebentafusp renal excretion by glomerular filtration cannot be excluded which is in line with 
the pop PK model. Based on POP PK simulations showing tebentafusp exposure increased by roughly 
ten-fold, even larger increase in patients with severe renal impairment. Monitoring of AEs in patients 
with severe renal impairment should thus be included as part of the first PSUR. 
Tebentafusp PK in subject with impaired hepatic function was not formally investigated in a study, nor 
in the population PK analysis. AST and ALT enzymes level did not modify tebentafusp average 
concentration or maximum concentration and this is adequately reflected in the SmPC. Population 
pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that there was no significant effect of race, weight (43 to 163 kg) 
and age (23 to 91 years) on tebentafusp clearance. 
All assumptions on the pharmacokinetics in special populations are derived from the PopPK model. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No drug interaction study was conducted and no information was presented other than the statement 
that risk of drug-drug-interactions is highest during the first 24 hours for patients receiving 
concomitant CYP450 substrates, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index. The sponsor 
conducted a review of Studies 102 and 202 (in which CRS data were more comprehensively identified) 
and evaluated the potential impact of elevated cytokines on concomitant medications that are 
substrates for CYP enzymes reported to be suppressed by elevated cytokines (ie, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, 
and CYP1A2) using the rates of Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs, QTcF prolongation >500 msec and TEAEs leading 
to discontinuation and death. Twenty (5.1%) tebentafusp-treated mUM patients were identified as 
having received concomitant medications with narrow therapeutic index within a 2-week period of a 
CRS episode and there was no evidence of a cytokine-induced DDI interaction in these patients. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Tebentafusp is a bispecific monoclonal antibody recognizing a gp100-derived peptide target to redirect 
local T lymphocytes to kill gp100-positive target cells (e.g., melanoma tumour cells). The gp100-
derived peptide is presented by a subset of the population that express a specific variant of the major 
histocompatibility complex class I known as HLA-A2. Glycoprotein 100 is only expressed in non-vital 
normal cells (melanocytes) and in tumours derived from these melanocytes. 
Tebentafusp is comprised of an affinity-enhanced soluble TCR domain fused to an anti-CD3 single-
chain variable fragment. The TCR domain targets the gp100 peptide fragment (YLEPGPVTA) when 
presented by HLA-A*02:01 on the cell surface. An immune synapse is formed when the TCR targeting 
domain of tebentafusp binds to UM cells and the CD3 effector domain binds to polyclonal T cells. This 
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 44/165 
 
 
 
immune synapse results in redirection, proliferation, and activation of polyclonal T cells regardless of 
their native TCR specificity. Tebentafusp-activated polyclonal T cells release inflammatory cytokines 
and cytolytic proteins, which result in direct killing of UM tumour cells. In addition, tebentafusp-
mediated killing may prime an endogenous anti-tumour immune response via epitope spreading. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Levels of 11 serum immune markers associated with inflammatory responses (IFN-γ, tumour necrosis 
factor [TNF]-α, IL-2, and IL-6), immune modulation (IL-10 and IL-1RA), and chemotaxis (C-X-C motif 
ligand [CXCL]9[MIG], CXCL10 [IP-10], CXCL11[I-TAC], hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and monocyte 
chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1]) increased transiently, peaking at 8 to 24 hours post treatment. 
Biomarkers returned to baseline levels as measured in samples collected at Day 8, prior to patients 
receiving the second dose. The treatment-induced increase was seen again after the third dose, where 
the magnitude of increase was higher for certain markers, notably IL-10 and CXCL10 (Figure 14). 
Figure 14. Change in Serum Cytokine Levels Over Time 
Blood lymphocyte levels decreased by 60% within 24 hours of the first dose of tebentafusp and 
returned to baseline by Day 8 after the first dose (Figure 15). This pattern was repeated after the 
third dose of tebentafusp on Day 15.

Page 45/165 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 15. Change in Blood Lymphocytes Over Time 
In study 102, tebentafusp increased CD3 (3.2-fold), CD4 (2.1-fold), and CD8 (2.3-fold) T cell levels in 
the tumour by Day 16, consistent with T cell trafficking into the tumour microenvironment. The 
majority of biopsies (68%) had a ≥ 1.5-fold increase in T cells by Day 16, after 3 doses of 
tebentafusp. 
In gene expression analyses of paired baseline and on-treatment tumour biopsies collected at Day 16 
the following messenger RNA (mRNA) levels increased after 3 doses of tebentafusp: 
• Interferon alpha (type 1 IFN) and gamma (type 2 IFN) pathway genes (2- and 3-fold respectively) 
• HLA class 1, transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP)1, TAP2 and Proteasome 20S 
Subunit Beta 8 (PSMB8) (2-fold). 
• Cytotoxic CD8 genes, granzyme B and perforin, that are required for tumour cell killing (2- to 3-fold). 
Expression levels of the following genes were reduced after 3 doses of tebentafusp: 
• Tumour-specific melanoma markers GP100 and tyrosine related protein 1 (TYRP1), 
• Tumour proliferation genes including marker of proliferation Ki67 (MKI67), Baculoviral IAP Repeat 
Containing 5 (BIRC5) and cyclin dependent kinase2 (CDK2). 
Dose justification 
Justification for the Phase 3 tebentafusp dose and regimen is based on clinical data from the dose 
escalation phases of study IMCgp100-01 and study IMCgp100-102 with supporting data from the 
expansion phase of study IMCgp100-102.  
During Part 1 of study 01 the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) 
of tebentafusp when given weekly (QW) or daily was to be established. During Part 2, the MTD or 
RP2D for each regimen were then tested further in expanded patient groups. PK data gathered in Arm 
1 indicated that the tebentafusp Cmax was directly proportional to absolute dose within a cohort. 
Heavier patients tended to have higher serum tebentafusp concentrations and a higher frequency of 
AEs. Flat doses, rather than weight-based doses, were incorporated for Arm 2 and during the dose-
expansion phase. The 4-week treatment break for the QW dosing regimen was removed from Arm 1 as 
all key toxicities generally occurred within the first 3 QW doses and then decreased in both frequency 
Assessment report

Page 46/165 
 
 
 
 
and severity over time. Given no clinically meaningful differences in safety or efficacy were identified 
between the QW and daily dosing regimens, and in light of the easier utility of a QW regimen, 
subsequent evaluation focused on weekly dosing. The emerging safety profile of tebentafusp suggested 
that CRS (and associated hypotension) was more likely to occur during the first 2 weeks, after which 
tachyphylaxis occurred. Therefore, as has been used for other T cell-engaging bispecifics, an intra-
patient escalation regimen (IE; Arm 1) during Weeks 1 and 2 (i.e., 20 and 30 mcg, respectively) prior 
to dosing 50 mcg was selected as the preferred regimen to evaluate further in the subsequent 
development.  
In phase 1 part of study 102 the MTD and/or the RP2D of tebentafusp in the QW RP2D-IE was to be 
identified, where part 2 then should estimate ORR, OS and PFS with this RP2D of tebentafusp in the 
RP2D-IE. During the Phase 1 portion of the study, the IE regimen, identified in study IMCgp100-01, 
was further optimised using a standard 3+3 dose-escalation design and evaluating higher Week 3 
doses (54 to 73 mcg). Thus, all patients received fixed low doses of tebentafusp at C1D1 (20 mcg) and 
C1D8 (30 mcg) followed by an escalated cohort-specific QW dose administered at C1D15 and beyond. 
Dose escalation identified the following RP2D-IE: 20 mcg on Day 1, 30 mcg on Day 8, 68 mcg on Day 
15, and 68 mcg once every week thereafter for further evaluation during the Phase 2 dose expansion. 
Antidrug Antibody (ADA) 
In IMCgp100-01, 3 of 78 patients (3.8%) developed ADA to tebentafusp. All 3 ADA-positive patients 
demonstrated a de novo treatment-induced ADA response. The onset times ranged from 58 to 218 
days (median time to onset 15 weeks), and there was no specific association with dose level or dosing 
regimen. The 3 patients demonstrated persistent ADA responses that were apparent through the end 
of treatment. 
In IMCgp100-102, 48 of 144 patients (33.3%) developed ADA to tebentafusp. Of the 48 patients with 
positive ADA responses, 40 patients (83.3%) had de novo treatment-induced ADA responses, with a 
median titre of 1:8192 (range, 1:4 to 1:4100000). Eight of 48 patients had treatment-boosted pre-
existing ADA (median titre-fold change of 10-fold and range of 4- to 32768-fold). The median time to 
onset of detectable treatment-induced ADA responses was 9 weeks. After initial onset, treatment-
induced ADA responses remained persistent in 87.5% of patients. 
In IMCgp100-202, 63 of 220 evaluable patients (28.6%) developed ADA to tebentafusp. Of the 63 
ADA-positive patients, 61 patients had treatment-induced ADA responses with a median titre of 1:2050 
(range, 1:4 to 1:1048576). The median time to onset of detectable treatment-induced ADA responses 
was 6.3 weeks. The majority of patients (95.1%) demonstrated persistent ADA responses after onset. 
Patients with low to moderate ADA titres had no meaningful change in tebentafusp Cavg or clearance. 
In IMCgp100-102 and IMCgp100-202, patients with an ADA titre > 1:8192 demonstrated reduced 
peak concentrations of tebentafusp and moderately increased clearance. The frequency and grade of 
hypersensitivity AEs in IMCgp100-102 and IMCgp100-202 did not increase with onset of ADA or 
magnitude of ADA titre. There was no association between ADA status and OS in IMCgp100-01, 
IMCgp100-102, and IMCgp100-202. High ADA titres (study IMCgp100-102: > 81920; study 
IMCgp100-202: > 24584) did not appear to impact OS. There was no meaningful association between 
tumour shrinkage and ADA status or titre. 
Exposure-response analysis was conducted based on the pop PK model. 
There was no clinically significant trend between PK exposure and overall survival (OS) or maximal 
change in tumour size from baseline, a surrogate of OS identified in Phase 2.  
There was no association between PK exposure and toxicities including: acute skin reactions, rash, 
hypo/hyper-pigmentation or hepatoxicity.

There was no association between PK exposure and cytokine release syndrome or either baseline or 
on-treatment lymphocyte counts. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A validated indirect sandwich immunoassay method was used for determination of tebentafusp in 
human serum. Antibodies to tebentafusp in human serum samples were tested by a homogenous 
bridging electrochemiluminescence method using a tiered approach. A lack of parallelism was identified 
in undiluted ISR samples from Study 102. Additional dilution was applied during sample analysis to 
overcome this issue. The report for results of binding and neutralising ADA assessment in Study 202 
should be provided post-authorisation as a recommendation (REC). A final NAb report will be 
submitted upon finalisation by end of March 2022.  
The Pop PK of tebentafusp could be described by a 2-compartment model with linear elimination, 
interindividual variability on all structural terms and an additive error model to describe the residual 
variability. A high number of samples were BLQ (33%) and excluded from model development. The 
main PK parameters reported in the SmPC such as volume of distribution, clearance, exposures in 
special populations, exposures in populations with high ADA titre were all derived from the final Pop PK 
model.  
No impact on safety or efficacy parameters were identified in patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment and no dose adjustments are recommended. However, there are limited data from patients 
with moderate renal impairment and no available information from patients with severe renal 
impairment, so therefore it is recommended in the SmPC section 4.2 that dosing in patients with 
severe renal impairment should be done with caution and careful monitoring. 
Tebentafusp PK in patients with hepatic impairment was not formally investigated due to lack of data 
completeness to comply with hepatic impairment Child Pugh classification (EMA guideline 
CPMP/EWP/2339/02). In place, the impact of AST/ALT levels on tebentafusp PK were assessed. The 
results showed no significant impact. 
The exposure response relations were evaluated by graphical analyses using Kaplan-Meier curves, box 
plots or scatter plots. 
Even though excretion and metabolic pathway of tebentafusp have not been characterised, the nature 
of the product allows some assumptions and makes this acceptable. It is widely reported that 
elimination of fusion proteins and mAbs occur via intracellular catabolism through receptor mediated 
endocytosis and subsequent degradation by lysosomes. Non-specific clearance through the liver via 
uptake by macrophages and endothelial cells and subsequent catabolism may also play a role, however 
this is not considered to be a significant elimination pathway for fusion proteins. Classical drug 
metabolic elimination does not represent an important clearance mechanism for large proteins 
(monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), fusion proteins, etc.).  
The increase in geometric mean PK exposure (Cmax) of tebentafusp was approximately dose 
proportional between the 20mcg dose administered on C1D1 and the 68mcg dose administered on 
C1D15. Repeat-dose data from study the first in human study support dose proportionality. No 
Accumulation was observed thus not indicating time-dependency. 
Studies 102 and 202 were conducted in the target population uveal melanoma patients. Study 01 was 
conducted in malignant melanoma patients, of whom ~20% were UM, thus there is no reason to 
assume there should be different PK described in this report compared to the target population 
although no specific clinical pharmacology studies were conducted. As no studies in special populations 
exist, all information is derived from the pop PK model. Based on these findings, only renal function

and the presence of high titre ADA were identified as relevant PK covariates. Patients with high titre 
ADA appear to have persistently diminished tebentafusp Cmax compared to patients with low titre ADA 
or ADA-negative status. Because ADA status or tebentafusp exposure were not associated with safety 
or efficacy of tebentafusp, there is no need to recommend monitoring of ADA or dose adjustment 
based on renal function. The lack of information on severe renal impairment is adequately reflected in 
the SmPC as well as the fact that no clinical study has been conducted on the topic. Age, weight, and 
race had no impact on the clearance of tebentafusp in patients with melanoma (see SmPC for more 
details). 
Unlike many therapeutic small molecules, antibodies are not subject to metabolic drug-drug 
interactions and are not substrates of the multi-drug resistance (MDR) efﬂux pumps. Tebentafusp is a 
fusion protein and is not metabolised by Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes or transported by P-
glycoprotein (Pgp) or related ABC membrane transporters. Thus, it is generally acceptable that no 
drug-drug-interaction studies are performed. However, cytokines produced by activated lymphocytes 
may impact the levels of Pgp and the activity of CYP450 enzymes, even though there was no evidence 
of a cytokine-induced DDI interaction in the studies conducted. The SmPC holds a precautionary 
statement, which is acceptable, stating that initiation of tebentafusp treatment causes transient release 
of cytokines that may suppress CYP450 enzymes. The highest drug-drug interaction risk is during the 
first 24 hours of the first three doses of tebentafusp in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 
substrates, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index (see section 4.5 of the SmPC). 
Tebentafusp mechanism of action is induction of cytokines due to T cell activation through T cell re-
direction into tumours. As there were no PD studies, PD markers were assessed from study 102.  
Increase in cytokines and chemokines used as biomarkers, decrease in blood lymphocyte levels, 
increase in T cells and downregulation of melanoma genes in tumour biopsies support the proposed 
mechanism of action for tebentafusp. 
Toxicity in study 01 led to the intra-patient escalation regimen.  QW and IE is considered 
substantiated. The 73mcg in study 102 coursed liver enzyme elevations and 68mcg were identified as 
the MTD and was then chosen for maintenance dose for study 202. In light of the non-existent 
exposure-response relationship it is possible that a different dose would have achieved similar efficacy, 
but the dose finding is overall acceptable. 
ADA frequencies in studies IMCgp100-102 (33%) and IMCgp100-202 (29%) were substantial with 
around one third of patients forming anti-drug-antibodies. The impact of ADA formation on the PK, 
safety and efficacy of tebentafusp was evaluated across studies IMCgp100-01, IMCgp100-102, and 
IMCgp100-202. There was reduced tebentafusp concentrations in patients with very high ADA titre, but 
no impact of ADA status or titre on either safety or efficacy has been reported. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
There were no dedicated pharmacology studies conducted, PK data are sparse, but obtained from the 
target population and thus representative for the patients to be treated. No exposure-response 
relationship could be identified. The pharmacokinetics of tebentafusp appear linear and dose-
proportional over a dose range of 20 mcg to 68 mcg. Following weekly intravenous infusion in 
metastatic uveal melanoma patients, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) reached 4.2 ng/mL - 
13.7 ng/mL immediately at the end of infusion (T = 0.5 hours). No accumulation was observed with a 
weekly dosing regimen at the target therapeutic doses. Tebentafusp displayed a volume of distribution 
comparable to blood volume (5.25 L). The excretion of tebentafusp is not fully characterised. Based on 
its molecular size that is close to the glomerular filtration size exclusion threshold, small amounts of 
tebentafusp may be excreted in the urine. Following administration of tebentafusp in metastatic uveal 
Assessment report

Page 49/165 
 
 
 
melanoma patients the estimated systemic clearance was 4.29 L/d, with a terminal half-life of 6 to 
8 hours. PopPK analysis indicated that there was no significant effect of weight, gender, race, and age 
on clearance. No impact on safety or efficacy parameters was identified in patients with mild to 
moderate renal impairment and no dose adjustments are recommended. There are limited data from 
patients with moderate renal impairment and there is no information available from patients with 
severe renal impairment. Population PK analyses demonstrated that baseline and on treatment 
ALT/AST elevations did not impact tebentafusp pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustments based on 
ALT/AST levels are recommended.  
The report for results of binding and neutralising ADA assessment in Study 202 should be provided 
post-authorisation as a recommendation.

Study 102 is an ongoing Phase 1/2, open-label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of tebentafusp 
using an intra-patient dose-escalation regimen in HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with previously 
treated mUM. The Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the study further optimised the intra-patient 
escalation regimen from the first-in-human study (Study 01) to achieve greater exposure closer to 
those doses where PRs were observed in UM in Study 01. The recommended Phase 2 dose identified 
was 20 mcg on Day 1, 30 mcg on Day 8, 68 mcg on Day 15, and 68 mcg once every week thereafter. 
This regimen was used in Study 102 Phase 2 expansion and in the Phase 3 Study 202 and is the 
proposed dosing regimen. 
The Phase 2 expansion portion evaluated the activity of tebentafusp in 127 patients with previously 
treated mUM (DCO date of 20 March 2020). 
The majority of patients were white (99.3%) and approximately half were male (49.6%), with a mean 
age of 61.0 years (range, 25 to 88 years). More than half of patients (58.3%) had LDH>ULN. All

patients had received prior anticancer therapies (range 1-5) in the metastatic setting; approximately 
one-third of patients received ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy.

Regarding efficacy, results from 127 pre-treated patients showed an encouraging improvement of OS 
16.8 months (95%CI: 12.9, 21.3) compared to historical controls with a median survival of ≤12 
months (Rantala, 2019; Khoja, 2019). The ORR is low (as in the pivotal study), but if patients with 
stable disease ≥24 weeks were included, the clinical benefit rate (CBR) reached 22.8%. For the few 
responders, the DOR was promising with 8.7 months (95%CI: 5.6, 24.5). 
Moreover, metastatic uveal melanoma has been very difficult to treat, with no systemic or local 
treatment advances in the metastatic setting for decades with any effect on OS. Considering this 
context, the results from study 102 of clinical efficacy is considered clinically relevant and supportive of 
the line-agnostic indication sought.

ITT Analysis 
Overall survival was the primary endpoint for this study. Assuming a 2:1 randomisation ratio of 
tebentafusp versus investigator’s choice, 250 events (deaths) were needed in the randomised trial to 
provide 89% power to detect a difference of survival distribution that could be characterised by a 
0.645 HR for OS with a 2-sided significance level of 0.045. Assuming OS was exponentially distributed, 
this may have translated to a median OS of 18.6 months in the tebentafusp arm and 12 months in the

drop-out rate, 369 patients needed to be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to the 2 arms in order to observe 
250 events after 51 months as follows:

• 123 patients to Arm 2 (investigator’s choice) 
Three analyses of OS were planned: 2 formal interim analyses and the final analysis. To randomize 369 
patients (assuming a 10% screen failure rate), 410 patients were needed to be enrolled. To enrol 410 
patients, approximately 900 patients were needed to be pre-screened (allowing for a 5% attrition rate 
and assuming 48% of patients are HLA-A*02:01 positive). The prevalence of HLA-A*02:01 varied 
depending on the region, so additional patients may be needed to be pre-screened to enrol 410 
patients. 
Rash Analysis Set (RAS)  
The study was also powered for the analysis of OS in the RAS. Assuming 50% of the tebentafusp-
treated patients developed a rash within the first week of treatment, there would be an approximate 
1:1 ratio between patients in the tebentafusp arm and the investigator’s choice control arm. One 
hundred sixty-four (164) events (deaths) were needed to provide 89% power to detect a difference in 
survival distributions that could be characterised by a 0.531 HR for OS with a 2-sided significance level 
of 0.005. Assuming OS was exponentially distributed, this may have translated to a median OS of 22.6 
months in the tebentafusp arm and 12 months in the investigator’s choice arm. 
The size of the study was changed while the study was ongoing. The number of required OS events in 
protocol version 1, 2, 3, and 4 was 219, which required 327 patients to be randomised. A sample size 
re-estimation was also planned. In protocol version 5 (31 March 2020) the sample size was increased 
to 369 subjects and the planned sample size re-estimation was removed. The Applicant claims that the 
sample size was increased since an additional primary objective was added (OS comparison in the rash 
group) and the power of OS was increased to 89%. 
The most important objective of the study is to show that treatment with tebentafusp provides longer 
survival than investigator’s choice of treatment. The Applicant aimed to show a median OS of at least 
18.6 months with tebentafusp, which is longer than the median OS obtained with any of the 
comparator treatments (approximately 12 months). The median OS target for tebentafusp is 
concordant with the results of the supportive study 102 (median OS 16.8 months). Observational 
studies reported a median survival of ≤12 months for patients who received the treatment options 
included in the investigator’s choice (Rantala, 2019; Khoja, 2019). An improvement in median survival 
of approximately 5 months is considered clinically relevant in the targeted disease, so the assumptions 
made about the sample size calculations are considered reasonable.  
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to either Arm 1 (tebentafusp) or Arm 2 (investigator’s choice). 
Assignment to the treatment arms was determined by the Interactive Response Technology (IRT).  
Randomisation to 1 of the 2 treatment arms was stratified by LDH levels. The 2 strata used were: (1) 
baseline LDH below or equal to the ULN, and (2) baseline LDH above the ULN. LDH levels utilised for 
stratification were assessed centrally during the screening period. Recent evidence suggests that the 
LDH level at the time of diagnosis has a significant impact on prognosis in metastatic UM. In the 
PUMMA study, a multivariate analysis of potential prognostic factors identified LDH above the upper 
Assessment report

limit of normal (ULN) as associated with shortened OS (multivariate hazard ratio [HR] 1.88, p < 
0.0001) (Nicholas, 2016; Khoja, 2019). Similar findings were obtained in an independent UM dataset, 
confirming that an LDH level above the ULN is associated with shortened OS (multivariate HR 1.6; p = 
0.014; Valpione, 2015). With the strong prognostic value of LDH level, stratified randomisation would 
protect imbalance in the 2 arms for overall prognosis. 
Given the distinct toxicity patterns at the first infusion of the agents being studied (tebentafusp versus 
investigator’s choice), the open-label design was chosen because the treatment assignment could not 
be blinded.

Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
Table 11. Definitions of Analysis Sets 
There are two main analysis populations: ITT and RASH. ITT is defined as all randomised patients 
regardless of received treatment. The RASH population only included patients assigned to tebentafusp, 
who experienced a rash within the first treatment week. The ITT will be used for all efficacy endpoints. 
The RASH population is used for the OS comparison between the RASH patients and all patients 
assigned to the comparator arm. The definition of the RASH population is understood. However, the 
RASH population is defined by a post-randomisation event and therefore the results of such analysis 
cannot be interpreted as a causal effect of treatment. All the analyses performed in the RASH are thus 
considered explorative and prone to bias. 
Primary endpoint OS 
The primary analysis of OS in all randomised patients will be analysed using a 2-sided log rank test 
stratified by LDH status for generation of the p-value. The HR will be estimated using a stratified Cox-
proportional hazards model using the Efron approach for handling ties, together with the associated 
profile likelihood 95% Cis for the HR. Kaplan-Meier plots of OS will be presented by treatment group. 
Median OS with 95%CIs will be presented. In addition, landmark survival estimates with corresponding 
95% CIs will also be presented using Kaplan-Meier methodology.  
Sensitivity analysis for OS 
OS will also be analysed based on an unstratified log rank test as a supportive analysis. An additional 
sensitivity analysis will evaluate OS in the Safety Population.  
Censoring rules for OS 
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 61/165 
 
 
 
 
For patients without documentation of death, OS will be censored at the last date the patient was 
known to be alive and will be followed continuously while patients are treated on trial and every 3 
months in the follow-up phase. 
Secondary endpoint PFS 
The PFS analysis will include all randomised patients and will be conducted using a 2-sided log-rank 
test stratified by LDH status (LDH above the ULN versus LDH below or equal to the ULN; measured 
centrally) for generation of the p-value. Formal testing of PFS in the RAS will not be conducted. The HR 
will be estimated using a stratified Cox-proportional hazards model using the Efron approach for 
handling ties, together with the associated profile likelihood 95% CIs for the HR. Kaplan-Meier plots of 
PFS will be presented by treatment arm. Summaries of PFS will be provided, including median PFS for 
each treatment and landmark estimates at specific time points with corresponding CIs. 
Censoring rules for PFS 
Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of the analysis will be censored at the time of the 
last evaluable tumour assessment. Patients with 2 or more missed tumour assessments will be 
censored at the time of the last tumour assessment prior to the missed assessments. If the patient has 
no evaluable visits or does not have baseline data, they will be censored at 0 days unless they die 
within 2 planned radiological assessment visits of Baseline (ie, within 26 weeks). Patients who 
withdraw from randomised therapy or receives another anti-cancer therapy prior to PD will be followed 
for PFS.  
Sensitivity analyses for PFS 
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 62/165 
 
 
 
 
Secondary endpoints ORR and BOR 
Objective response rate was compared between treatment arms using a stratified Cochran Mantel-
Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for baseline LDH status. The results of the analysis were presented in 
terms of an odds ratio together with its associated 95% CI. A summary of BOR and ORR was also 
presented by treatment arm. The BOR was to occur after all patients had the opportunity to be 
evaluated for 3 planned assessments or approximately 36 weeks. Any CRs or PRs that occur after a 
further anti-cancer therapy was received will not be included in the numerator for the ORR calculation 
by RECIST v1.1. 
OS will be tested using a stratified log-rank test with LDH as a stratification factor. Patients will be 
followed regardless treatment discontinuation. An unstratified analysis was planned as sensitivity 
analysis.  
PFS will be tested with the same methods as described for OS. Patients will be followed for PFS 
regardless treatment discontinuation. In the primary analysis for PFS, patients will be censored if they 
not progressed or died at the time of the analysis at the time of the last evaluable tumour assessment. 
Patients with 2 or more missed tumour assessments will be censored at the time of the last tumour 
assessment prior to the missed assessments. If the patient has no evaluable visits or does not have 
baseline data, they will be censored at 0 days unless they die within 2 planned radiological assessment 
visits of Baseline. Several sensitivity analyses testing the impact of the censoring rules were 
performed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 63/165 
 
 
 
 
The overall response rate (unconfirmed) between the arms will be compared using a stratified Cochran 
Mantel-Haenszel test adjusting for baseline LDH status. Patients who switched to another anti-cancer 
therapy and were responders will not be considered as responder in the analysis. 
Interim analysis and type I error control 
Interim analyses 
Two interim analyses will be performed using a 3-stage group sequential design. The first interim 
analysis will be based on approximately 60% of the events (150 events) and the second interim 
analysis will be based on approximately 80% of the events (200 events). Analyses of OS will be based 
on O’Brien- Fleming boundaries (O’Brien and Fleming, 1979). The Lan-DeMets approach (Lan and 
DeMets, 1983) that approximates the O’Brien-Fleming spending function will be used to adjust for 
situations where the actual number of events up to the data cut-off date for a given interim analysis 
does not match the planned number. 
Multiple testing strategy 
There are 2 analyses of the primary endpoint of OS, relating to the 2 objectives of the study. The 
overall study 2-sided α-level of 5% will be split between these objectives. Ten percent of the study’s 
overall Type I error rate will be allocated to the OS analysis in the RAS (α= 0.5%). Ninety percent of 
the study’s overall Type I error rate will be allocated to the OS analysis in the ITT (α= 4.5%). 
However, if the first interim OS analysis in the RAS group crosses the pre-specified stopping boundary, 
then the α from that analysis will be carried over to this ITT analysis and the overall α-level for that 
analysis will therefore be 5%. Otherwise, an overall α-level of 4.5% will be applied to the ITT OS 
analyses. The analysis of PFS will follow the ITT analysis of OS in a hierarchical manner. PFS will not be 
formally tested unless the null hypothesis for the OS endpoint is rejected, using the α level that is used 
for the ITT OS analysis. The analysis of ORR will follow the ITT analyses for OS and PFS in a 
hierarchical manner. ORR will not be formally tested unless the null hypotheses for OS and PFS are 
rejected. ORR will not be formally tested in the RAS. 
Since neither PFS nor BOR will be tested on an interim basis, both endpoints will be tested at an 
overall alpha level of 0.045 (two-sided) or 0.05 if the alpha from the RAS analysis is transferred to the 
ITT analyses.

The final SAP (Version 3.0), dated 28 October 2020, described the planned analyses.  
Table 12. Summary of Changes to Planned Analyses  
In addition to the analyses described in the SAP, the Sponsor conducted additional exploratory, post-
hoc analyses to further elucidate the safety and efficacy of tebentafusp. SAS software Version 9.4 was 
used. 
Two interim analyses for OS are planned (60% of information fraction and 80% of information 
fraction). The O’Brien-Fleming spending function will be used to calculate the stooping boundaries. To 
keep the type I error at 5% the alpha is split between ITT-OS (0.045) and RASH-OS (0.005), with a 
possible alpha transfer from RASH-OS to ITT-OS. A hierarchical approach was used to control for 
multiplicity across the secondary endpoints.

•  Recruitment 
From 04 October 2017 to 18 June 2020, 447 HLA-A*02:01-positive patients were screened, of whom 
378 patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to tebentafusp (n=252) or investigator’s choice (n=126) at 
58 sites in 14 countries (US, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Poland, Canada, Australia, Belgium, 
Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine, Russia, Italy, and the Netherlands). Treatment choices available in the 
investigator’s choice arm were pembrolizumab (n=103; 81.8%), ipilimumab (n=16; 12.7%), and 
dacarbazine (n=7; 5.6%). 
As of 13 October 2020, the DCO date of the primary analysis, the median duration of follow-up for all 
patients was 14.1 months (range, 12.7 to 15.6 months).

Since mUM was an inclusion criterion, all of the included patients had metastatic disease. Hence, no 
subgroup analyses are presented of patients with localised vs metastatic disease. 
•  Numbers analysed 
The Applicant presents pivotal data from 378 mUM patients from the pivotal study 202 (252 patients 
were randomised to tebentafusp) and supportive data from 127 patients from the phase 1-2 Study 
102, who were treated with the proposed dosing regimen. 
Exposure 
A total of 109 patients (43.3%) in the tebentafusp arm and 18 patients (14.3%) in the investigator’s 
choice arm were treated beyond RECIST progression.

Regarding the recommended duration of tebentafusp: 43% of patients continued treatment with 
tebentafusp post-progression and the median duration was 1.7 months. The short median duration 
might give the impression that a large proportion of the treated patients did not appear to benefit from 
the extended therapy. The Applicant has provided the duration of post-progression tebentafusp 
therapy in time intervals, and of the 109 patients who received treatment beyond progression, 48.6% 
had therapy for >2 months, 23.9% for >4 months, and 12.8% for >6 months. Very few had a 
treatment duration post-progression for more than 8 months (8.3%), >12 months (5.5%), >18 
months (2.8%), while 1 patient was treated for more than 24 months.

significantly improved with tebentafusp, as the median OS was prolonged by 5.7 months from 16 
months (95%CI: 9.7, 18.4) to 21.7 months (95%CI: 18.6, 28.6), HR 0.51 (95%CI: 0.37, 0.71). The 
OS data is considered rather mature as ~60% of the expected events were observed, with 34.5% 
events in the tebentafusp arm versus 50% events for the control arm after a median follow-up of ~14 
months. Moreover, the KM curves clearly separate after approximately 3 months of therapy and stay 
separated.

The applicant has provided updated OS data (Table 8), with the DCO of 12 August 2021 and a median 
duration of follow-up of 22.4 months (~ 8 months longer follow-up) and ~54% events. The updated 
OS continued to favour the tebentafusp arm (HR=0.58; 95%CI 0.44, 0.77). However, this updated 
analysis occurred after patients on therapy of investigator’s choice started to cross-over to 
tebentafusp. It is noted that cross-over was allowed, although data from the primary endpoint of OS 
was not considered fully mature and this hampers the updated and future results of the primary 
endpoint of the pivotal trial, which was also the main endpoint that was clinically meaningfully 
improved. The applicant’s arguments for allowing cross-over are mainly due to ethical considerations, 
which is acknowledged. Moreover, according to the prespecified statistical analysis plan for this Phase 
3 trial, the OS benefit of HR 0.51 was the final analysis that provided full control of the overall 5% type 
I error rate. Hence, all subsequent OS analyses are exploratory in nature and no longer statistically 
controlled.

From Table 23, it is evident that 16 patients, who were originally randomised to investigator’s choice, 
had been allowed to cross-over to receive tebentafusp after PD. The timing of the crossover and their 
OS as of 12 August 2021 is shown, and only 2 patients had died at DCO.

Table 26. Sensitivity analyses of PFS 
The assessment of response and progressive disease was done according to RECIST 1.1, but since 
tebentafusp is an immunotherapy, results according to immune-mediated response criteria (irRECIST) 
are also relevant to perform, due to the different mode of action of immunotherapies and the unusual 
patterns of response that include tumour flare and pseudoprogression (Seymour et al. Lancet Oncol 
2017; 18: e143-52).  
The Applicant conducted an exploratory analysis of ORR according to irRECIST: 9.9% (25/252) 
irRECIST vs 9% (22/252) RECIST. 11% (28/252) of patients on tebentafusp were ‘upgraded’ from 
RECIST PD to a better irRECIST outcome; 25 patients were ‘upgraded’ from RECIST PD to irSD, 1 
patient was ‘upgraded’ from RECIST SD to irPR, and 2 RECIST PDs were upgraded to irPR ( 
Table 27).

At the time of the primary analysis of OS (DCO 13 October 2020), not all patients in the pivotal study 
202 had the opportunity to undergo 3 planned assessments; therefore, the formal analysis of BOR was 
not conducted at that time. Since then, all patients have received 3 planned assessments and the 
results of that analysis, based on a DCO of 12 August 2021, are summarised in Table 6. The updated 
BOR show similar results as the primary analysis as the ORR with tebentafusp was improved by 1.2%, 
corresponding to 3 more patients, who had a PR.

If a response to treatment (CR or PR) was observed in both arms, the responses were durable 9.9 vs 
9.7 months; however, DOR for the tebentafusp arm was initially immature with only 39.1% events, so 
the applicant has provided updated DOR data for study 202 at DCO 12 August 2021 (Table 32). With 
61.5% of events in the tebentafusp arm and 66.7% of events in the investigator’s choice arm, the 
median DOR remained at 9.9 months in the tebentafusp arm (n=26) and 9.7 months in the 
investigator’s choice arm (n=6).  
Health-related Quality of Life 
Health-related quality-of-life data were collected using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D,5L PRO 
instruments.  
Assessment report

EORTC-QLQ-C30 
In both the tebentafusp and investigator’s choice arms, patients were considered to be domain 
compliant (ie, completed at least 50% of the EORTC QLQ-C30 items) through C17D1, with generally 
similar rates between the arms. Subsequently, patients in the tebentafusp arm remained domain 
compliant through C29D1, whereas compliance in the investigator’s choice arm decreased to 
approximately 33% at C29D1. 
At baseline, no differences in EORTC-QLQ-C30 scores were observed between the treatment arms for 
any of the domains. In general, throughout the study, the EORTC-QLC-C30 scores were similar 
between the treatment arms and remained stable for most domains. However, statistically significant 
and clinically meaningful LS mean improvements from baseline were observed for fatigue at EOT (10.9 
vs 20.1; p=0.0445) and insomnia at C5D1 (-9.3 vs 2.8; p=0.0176), both favouring tebentafusp, and 
for constipation at EOT (3.2 vs -3.5; p=0.0296), favouring investigator’s choice.  
Overall, there was no significant difference between the tebentafusp and investigator’s choice arms for 
time to sustained deterioration across the different EORTC-QLQ-C30 domains. 
EQ-5D, 5L 
In both the tebentafusp and investigator’s choice arms, patients were considered to be domain 
compliant through C17D1, with generally similar rates between the arms. Subsequently, patients in the 
tebentafusp arm remained domain compliant through C29D1, whereas compliance in the investigator’s 
choice arm decreased to 40.0% at C21D1 and 33.3% at each of C25D1 and EOT. 
At baseline, no differences in EQ-5D, 5L scores were observed between the treatment arms for any of 
the domains. In general, throughout the study, mean change from baseline was similar between the 
treatment arms for all domains. 
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
Time to Second Disease Progression 
A total of 134 patients (53.2%) in the tebentafusp arm and 70 patients (55.6%) in the investigator’s 
choice arm who were on study treatment had second disease progression events (Table 21).

Table 33. Summary of Time to Second Disease Progression (ITT Analysis Set) 
The median time to second disease progression was similar between the tebentafusp and the control 
arms (9.2 and 8.3 months, respectively). The applicant has also provided data on PFS2, which was an 
exploratory endpoint of the pivotal study 202, and included 2 types of events: (1) second PDs 
monitored from patients who receive treatment beyond progression (TBP) from randomised therapy 
and (2) deaths. However, patients who went off study treatment and received another anticancer 
therapy after their initial progression no longer had tumours evaluated on-study. Therefore, for 
patients who received another anticancer therapy after initial progression, PFS2 events that 
contributed to the analysis were primarily deaths. Since patients treated with tebentafusp received a 
higher rate of TBP than control patients (44% vs 16%, respectively), there were slightly more deaths 
(n=71) vs second PD events (n=63). For control patients, the majority of PFS2 events are deaths 
(n=60) vs second PD events (n=10).

2.6.5.4.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for efficacy 
HLA-A*02:01 genotype is a mandatory biomarker of efficacy of tebentafusp at his time as the soluble 
TCR domain of tebentafusp recognises and binds specifically to a peptide derived from gp100 protein 
that is presented by the HLA-A*02:01 molecule on the tumour cells. Tebentafusp will not bind its 
target on tumor cells in patients who are negative for the HLA-A*02:01 allele. Therefore, patients 
without the HLA-A*02:01 type were excluded from trials with tebentafusp as these patients would 
have no clinical benefit from tebentafusp. 
HLA genotyping for the pivotal studies 102 and 202 was completed via the Secore® HLA Sequencing 
System (One Lambda Inc/Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc) processed by the American Red Cross central 
laboratory, a CLIA- and ASHI-certified laboratory, using the uTYPE 7.3 RUO software. All samples were 
processed at 700 Spring Garden Street, Philadelphia, PA 19123. The Secore HLA Sequencing system is 
CE-IVD approved in Europe. 
There are several high-resolution genotyping assay systems in Europe that have the CE-IVD approval 
in Europe and are routinely used in high-risk patient population to determine HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, -DQ 
and -DP locus types for bone marrow typing and transplant. No analytical validation of the Secore® 
HLA Sequencing assay system was conducted specifically for Studies 102 and 202.

b  Measurement from independent central review. 
The applicant has presented comparisons between the Study 202 control patients who started 2L 
therapy and Study 102 patients were conducted via propensity score methods and according to a 
prospective statistical analysis plan. The primary comparison involved all patients in Study 102 
regardless of the number of prior lines of therapy versus patients in Study 202 from the Investigator’s 
choice arm, who received systemic therapy in the 2L setting (i.e., after progressing on their 
randomised treatment). Patients who received the same therapy as their Investigator’s choice therapy 
in the 2L setting were excluded. 
Factors in the propensity score model included age, gender, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP), tumour size, ECOG status, and time since primary diagnosis. For patients from 
Study 102, baseline values were used. For patients from Study 202, the most recent value prior to the 
start of 2L therapy was used. A secondary analysis included only patients from Study 202, who 
received checkpoint inhibitors in the 2L setting. There were too few patients to conduct a comparison 
involving only those who received the nivo + ipi combination therapy (n = ~14 patients).  
The inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) using an average treatment effect of the treated 
weighting scheme was used. With this scheme, each patient in the tebentafusp group received a 
weight of 1 (ie, they were not weighted) and those from Study 202 who had high PS (ie, they were 
more similar to the Study 102 patient population) received large weights and those with low PS 
received low weights. The PS overlap and the balance with respect to baseline covariates was assessed 
prior to conducting the analysis in order to ensure they were adequate for comparing the treatment 
groups. 
IPTW-weighted Kaplan-Meier curves were prepared for visual comparisons of the survival distributions. 
Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated from IPTW-weighted Cox proportional 
hazards models. Multivariate Cox PH models using all of the same covariates used in the PS model 
were used as a sensitivity analysis to help establish the robustness of the results regardless of the 
statistical approach. 
Baseline characteristics for this study compared with Study 102 can be found in table 38, where key 
prognostic factors favor the nivolumab and ipilimumab combination study population (i.e., better 
performance status, smaller liver metastasis, more extrahepatic disease only, and higher percentage of 
patients with normal LDH and ALP).

•  The incidence of treatment-induced ADA was 29.9%, with a median titre of 1:2,050. 
•  The incidence of treatment-boosted ADA (ie, increases in pre-existing ADA after tebentafusp 
administration) was 12.5%, with a median increase of 1,026-fold. 
•  Median onset of detectable treatment-induced ADA responses was 6.3 weeks. 
Treatment-emergent antidrug-antibodies (ADAs) were detected in 33% and 29% of mUM patients in 
Studies 102 and 202, respectively. In these studies, ADA had a median onset time of 6 to 9 weeks 
after the first dose of tebentafusp, and median titres of 8192 (Study 102) and 2050 (Study 202).

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy assessment of the new active substance tebentafusp is based on the pivotal study 202, 
which is a phase 3, randomised, controlled, open-label, multicentre study comparing tebentafusp 
monotherapy with Investigator’s choice (ipilimumab 12.7%, pembrolizumab 81.8% and dacarbazine 
5.6%). Patients were recruited from 58 sites and the majority of the patients were white and recruited 
from the EU or from a population similar to the EU population. A total of 378 patients with previously 
untreated metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM) were randomly assigned (2:1) to tebentafusp (n=252) or 
investigator’s choice (n=126). Important supportive evidence was submitted from the phase I-II study 
102, which was a single-arm, multicentre study, and the 127 patients, who had previously treated 
mUM and were treated at the proposed dosing regimen in the dose-expansion phase, formed the basis 
for the applied line-agnostic indication.  
The design of the pivotal study is endorsed and the open-label is acceptable, since the distinct safety 
profile of tebentafusp necessitated this and would probably have unblinded the study anyway. The 
choice of comparator as investigator’s choice is acceptable since no effective standard of care exists for 
the targeted patient population with mUM. No scientific advice was given from the CHMP regarding 
efficacy. 
The sample size calculations seem adequate. The increase of the sample size performed while the 
study was ongoing was based on external information and not on information from the current study. 
Patients included in the pivotal study 202 had to have had no prior systemic therapy in the metastatic 
or advanced setting, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or targeted therapy. Prior neoadjuvant 
or adjuvant systemic therapy was allowed and patients included were only allowed to have (ECOG) 
performance status score of 0 or 1. 
Baseline characteristics showed that the mean age was 61.3 years in the tebentafusp arm, which is 
younger than for the comparator arm i.e. 63.6 years. Gender was well balanced, and the majority of 
patients were of ECOG PS 0 (76.2% vs 67.5%) or 1 (19.4% vs 24.6), but this was not entirely 
balanced and this is in favour of the tebentafusp arm, as patients of ECOG PS 0 have no symptoms of 
their disease and because ECOG PS is a known and important prognostic factor for cancer patients.  
The choroid was most commonly the initial UM site and metastases were seldom observed at initial 
diagnosis. Mean baseline LDH was higher in the tebentafusp arm, but the patients were stratified 
according to LDH ≤ or > ULN 250 U/L, and this was well balanced between the two arms. 
Approximately half of the patients had a largest metastatic lesion of ≤3 cm (55%) and a third (36.5%) 
of the patients had a largest metastatic lesion of 3.1 -8 cm. Hence, the size of the disease burden of 
the study patients was considerable, but well balanced across the arms. 
The primary objective is to assess overall survival (OS), which is acceptable and endorsed, because 
this is not subject to bias and deemed highly clinically relevant for the targeted patient population, who 
have an expected median OS of only ~1 year. The Applicant had dual objectives within the primary 
objective, to assess OS in the ITT population and to assess OS in the study population who develop a 
rash, but the latter was not endorsed and results were considered difficult to interpret. Secondary 
objectives were to assess safety, tolerability and the PK profile of tebentafusp as well as efficacy 
objectives anti-tumour efficacy measure by progression-free-survival (PFS), best overall response 
(BOR), the duration of the responses (DOR), time to response (TTR) and disease-control rate (DCR). 
Overall, the objectives are considered clinically relevant, appropriate and concordant with the 
endpoints of the pivotal trial.  
The applicant presented a table comparing the concordance rate between the LHD results between the

Page 101/165 
 
 
 
central laboratory and local laboratories. The overall concordance is 90.5 %, which is higher than the 
threshold pre-specified in the SAP to perform sensitivity analysis for OS. No apparent imbalance 
between the treatment arms regarding LHD is observed. Hence, the observed minor differences 
between local and central LHD results are not considered to have an impact on the trial results. 
The statistical methods applied for the analysis of OS, PFS and ORR are endorsed. 
The strategy implemented to control the type I error is agreed. 
However, several changes to the statistical methods were made while the study was ongoing, mostly 
as part of protocol amendments 3 and 4 (amendments 1 and 2 were done prior to first subject 
enrolled). These modifications impacted the overall sample size, the interim, the multiplicity 
adjustment procedure and the PFS definition. Please refer to the protocol amendments in the study 
conduct section. It is generally difficult to exclude any data-driven decisions. 
Nevertheless, despite changes in sample size and interim plans, it is noted that the number of events 
for this first interim remained approximately the same between the last protocol before first subject 
enrolled (n=154 in protocol amendment 2), and the latest protocol version (n=150 in protocol 
amendment 4). Moreover, although the multiplicity adjustment procedure was updated, the 
significance levels of OS analyses remained based on O’Brien-Fleming boundaries.  
Regarding the change in PFS endpoint, it is acknowledged that the latest protocol definition of the 
censoring rules is more closely aligned with the EMA guideline than the initial version of the protocol, 
and PFS sensitivity analyses provide additional results with alternative censoring rules. The PFS was 
initially planned to be assessed by a blinded independent central review (rather than investigator-
assessed, from protocol amendment 3). However, given the availability of OS as the primary endpoint, 
this issue will not be pursued. 
Taken together, these protocol changes to the statistical methods are not thought to significantly 
impact the overall interpretation of the results. 
The current version of the SAP is version 3 dated 28 Oct 2020. Several changes were made in the SAP 
to follow changes made in the protocol. Most changes are not considered to affect the interpretability 
of the results. It is noted that a change in the time frame for DCR was made and changed from ≥ 24 
weeks to ≥ 12 weeks. This was not endorsed, and results based on ‘≥ 24’ weeks were also included. 
Important protocol deviations were summarised by the applicant and it was noted that more deviations 
were observed in the tebentafusp arm, most often in the category of trial procedures. The applicant 
provided an overview of the Protocol deviations relating to trial procedures in Study 202. These results 
showed that in both arms, the most frequent trial procedure-related protocol deviations involved 
missed safety assessments (15.9% vs 6.3%), with the majority being missed safety labs (8.3% vs 
6.3%) or missed vital signs collections (7.5% vs 0%). It is agreed that this is likely related to more the 
frequent dosing of tebentafusp (weekly vs every 3 weeks) and a more intensive schedule of 
assessments and visits in the tebentafusp arm. Potential deviations in the timing of imaging 
assessments were more common in the tebentafusp vs the control arm (4 (1.6%) vs 1 patients 
(0.8%)). However, the applicant has performed a detailed review, which showed that 4 of the 5 
patients (3 on tebentafusp and 1 on the control arm) had deviations in imaging assessments with no 
impact on PFS. The one remaining patient on the tebentafusp arm had a 2-week delay in their imaging 
assessment that demonstrated PD. This delay was considered to have no appreciable impact on PFS 
given additional sensitivity analyses showing the PFS difference between the 2 arms remains 
statistically significant in favour of tebentafusp even when controlling for attrition bias and evaluation-
time bias. Overall, the reported protocol deviations are deemed not to have had any major impact on 
the overall interpretation of the study results.

A total of 109 patients (43.3%) in the tebentafusp arm and 18 patients (14.3%) in the investigator’s 
choice arm were treated beyond RECIST progression. Thus, we can observe a clear imbalance with a 
higher proportion of patients from the tebentafusp arm treated beyond progression compared to the 
Investigator’s choice arm. Considering that the study was in an open-label setting, there are concerns 
that there could be bias in the decision to treat beyond progression, and to which extent the OS results 
were impacted. It should be noted that the proportion of patients continuing treatment beyond 
progression within this subset of eligible patients was much higher in tebentafusp arm (59.6%) 
compared to the investigator’s choice arm received TBP (18.6%), while eligibility for TBP was similar in 
the two groups (respectively 78.6% versus 77.0%) (Table 14.1.9.1). Moreover, it seems that the 
incidence of subsequent anticancer therapies was higher in the tebentafusp arm compared to the 
control arm (39.3% vs 32.0%). This suggests that there is a difference in management of TBP across 
the treatment groups. It cannot be excluded that such a difference could be potentially related to the 
open-label design. However, considering the size effect observed in primary analysis with consistent 
sensitivity analysis and the fact that further analysis on TBP would be purely explorative, it is unlikely 
that further analysis could impact the conclusions on the benefit/risk balance. 
The data indicate that for a few patients, radiological progression was not indicative of a poor 
prognosis; but any firm conclusions are difficult to make, as these patients were carefully selected 
from clinical and paraclinical parameters. Hence, selection bias is considered to be a part of the results 
observed for the patients, who were selected for continued treatment despite progressive disease. It 
was concluded that treatment beyond progression was a part of the overall treatment strategy in the 
pivotal 202 study. Moreover, since OS was the primary endpoint of this study, it cannot be excluded 
that this strategy was an essential part of the observed OS benefit. It was not considered meaningful 
to ask for further analyses to clarify this issue, since the study design and the element of selection bias 
preclude any absolute conclusions on this issue. Therefore, it was concluded that treatment beyond 
progression with tebentafusp is acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the pivotal 202 study, the primary endpoint of OS was met showing a clinically relevant and 
statistically significant improvement with tebentafusp, as the median OS was prolonged by 5.7 months 
from 16 months to 21.7 months, HR 0.51 (95%CI: 0.37, 0.71). The median follow-up time at the time 
of the primary analysis was ~14 months (DCO 13 October 2020) and approximately 40% of the OS 
events were observed with 34.5% events in the tebentafusp arm versus 50% events for the control 
arm. Moreover, the KM curves clearly separate after approximately 3 months of therapy and stay 
separated. The applicant has provided the requested updated OS data, with the DCO of 12 August 
2021 and a median duration of follow-up of 22.4 months (~ 8 months longer follow-up), when ~54% 
OS events were observed. The updated OS continued to favour the tebentafusp arm (HR=0.58; 95%CI 
0.44, 0.77). However, this updated analysis occurred after patients on therapy of investigator’s choice 
started to cross over to tebentafusp. It is noted that cross-over was allowed, although data from the 
primary endpoint of OS was not considered fully mature and this hampers the updated and future 
results of the primary endpoint of the pivotal trial, which was also the main endpoint that was clinically 
meaningfully improved. 16 patients from the control arm crossed over and at DCO 12 August 2021, 2 
of these patients have died, so no firm conclusions can be drawn at this time. The applicant is 
recommended to provide Final OS data (which is planned after 250 events in the SAP) as a post-
authorisation measure.  
Overall, these favourable OS results support a first-line indication for tebentafusp in the treatment of 
mUM. 
In the supportive study 101, the median OS was 16.8 months (95%CI: 12.9, 21.3) in the pre-treated 
study population after a median follow up of ~20 months and 54.3% events (n=127). This result is 
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 103/165 
 
 
 
significantly better than for historical controls treated with chemotherapy or Anti-PD-1 monotherapy in 
a 2+ line setting (median OS of 6-9 months, Rantala, 2019; Khoja, 2019), and although this was a 
single-arm study, these data are considered sufficient to support a line-agnostic indication due to the 
lack of standard of care options and the rare incidence of the targeted disease (4-6 patients per million 
in the EU of which 50% develop metastatic disease). Moreover, mUM has been very difficult to treat, 
with no systemic or local treatment advances in the metastatic setting for decades with any effect on 
OS. Even though emerging results for the combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab have 
shown OS in the range of 12-19 months in single-arm studies, the reported efficacy of tebentafusp in 
the 2+ line setting is considered clinically meaningful and supportive of the applied line-agnostic 
indication. In order to show, if there was any impact on efficacy with tebentafusp from previous given 
anti-cancer therapies, it was clarified that the majority of patients in study 102 (88%; 93 of 106) 
received immunotherapy as their prior systemic therapy; and most of these patients (89%; 83 of 93) 
received an anti-PD-(L)1. OS by prior PDx use indicates that there was no detrimental effect on OS 
after prior immunotherapy, which is considered reassuring. 
The rash-analyses of OS, which was also a primary objective of the pivotal study, is not considered to 
have any clinically meaningful purpose, as both patients with and without rash derived benefit of 
tebentafusp and it is not known in advance who will develop a rash after treatment with tebentafusp.  
In the pivotal 202 study, the secondary endpoint of PFS did not show any clinically meaningful 
improvement, although it was statistically significantly improved with tebentafusp, as the median PFS 
was prolonged by 0.4 months from 2.9 months to 3.3 months, HR 0.73 (95%CI: 0.58, 0.94). The PFS 
data is considered mature with almost 80% events and a median follow-up of ~11 months. The KM 
curves never clearly separate and the shape of the curve show that a high number of patients had 
events at every time point of evaluation, including at the first evaluation after 12 weeks. However, 
there did not seem to be significant evaluation-time bias according to a sensitivity analysis, so the PFS 
results are considered robust. Considering the OS gain with tebentafusp, it is considered acceptable 
that no major improvement of PFS is observed as well. This pattern of efficacy response has often 
been observed with other immunotherapies.  
In the supportive study 101, the median PFS was 2.8 months (95%CI: (2.0, 3.7) in the pre-treated 
population after a median follow up of 25.8 months and 92% events. This is in line with the PFS result 
for the pivotal study. 
The secondary endpoints of the pivotal study 2020 were BOR, ORR, DCR, DOR and TTR. In the 
tebentafusp arm, the updated best overall response (BOR) was 1 patient with a complete response 
and 25 patients with a partial response (PR 9.9%); while 52 patients (20.6%) had SD as best 
response. In the investigator’s choice arm, there were no CRs; 6 patients (4.8%) with a PR, 16 
(12.7%) had SD. The overall response rate ORR was numerically higher in the tebentafusp arm 
compared with the control arm (10.3% vs 4.8%), but this difference in ORR was not statistically 
significant nor clinically relevant.  
Disease control rate (defined as CR + PR + SD ≥12 weeks) favoured the tebentafusp arm compared 
with the investigator’s choice arm, with rates of 45.6% (95%CI: 39.4, 52.0) and 27.0% (95%CI: 19.5, 
35.6), respectively.  
SD ≥12 weeks was considered borderline clinically relevant, and this change was introduced during the 
study, which is not endorsed. Moreover, it is only considered clinically relevant to evaluate the CBR 
rate using SD ≥ 24 weeks as initially defined in the protocol for the targeted patient population. 
If a response to treatment (CR or PR) was observed in both arms, the responses were durable 9.9 vs 
9.7 months; however, DOR for the tebentafusp arm was initially immature. The Applicant has provided 
updated DOR, and at the DCO (12 August 2021), 61.5% of events in the tebentafusp arm and 66.7% 
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 104/165 
 
 
 
of events in the investigator’s choice arm had occurred. The median DOR remained unchanged for both 
treatment arms and these mature DOR data the few responders (26 vs 6 patients, respectively) are 
considered highly clinically relevant. 
Time to response (TTR) was shorter in the tebentafusp arm compared to the control arm (2.9 
months vs 4.1 months); however, the sample size of responders in the pivotal study is limited (n=29), 
so these data should be interpreted with caution. 
In the pivotal study, patients were allowed to receive tebentafusp “while patient is deriving clinical 
benefit and in the absence of unacceptable toxicities” which is beyond PD by RECIST 1.1, and no 
crossover to tebentafusp was initially permitted. Although continued treatment beyond progressive 
disease is decided by the investigator, who are also influenced by important prognostic factors, such as 
ECOG performance status and LDH levels of the individual patient treated, etc.; it is acknowledged that 
approximately 40% of patients treated in the tebentafusp arm continued treatment with tebentafusp 
beyond progression. As mentioned above treatment beyond progression was considered a part of the 
overall treatment strategy in the pivotal 202 study. 
The applicant conducted, as requested, an exploratory analysis of ORR according to irRECIST, and it is 
agreed that there was no clinically meaningful difference in the tebentafusp arm: 9.9% (25/252) 
irRECIST vs 9% (22/252) RECIST. However, 11% (28/252) of patients on tebentafusp were ‘upgraded’ 
from RECIST PD to a better irRECIST outcome; 25 patients were ‘upgraded’ from RECIST PD to irSD, 1 
patient was ‘upgraded’ from RECIST SD to irPR, and 2 RECIST PDs were upgraded to irPR. These 
results with irRECIST are considered promising, as 28 patients had a different outcome that merited 
continued treatment with tebentafusp from objective criteria. Since irRECIST was not used in the 
pivotal trial, a recommendation to use irRECIST in the SmPC is not considered warranted. 
The applicant has presented subgroup analyses of median OS for both the pivotal study 202 and the 
supportive study 102 expansion. Overall, the OS benefit demonstrated with tebentafusp in Study 202 
was observed clearly across important demographic and known prognostic subgroups, such as gender, 
age <65 versus ≥65 years of age, no prior systemic therapy, and largest metastatic lesion of ≤3 cm. 
Hence, these are considered supportive of clinically relevant efficacy of tebentafusp for all patients 
included in the pivotal study. 
The applicant has presented comparisons between Piluats 2021 (nivolumab + ipilimumab) and Study 
102 patients. Despite the differences in the study populations, with Piluats 2021 being a better 
prognostic population (1L) than those from Study 102 (2L+), the OS from Study 102 appears better in 
this cross-trial comparison. This is considered supportive of efficacy of tebentafusp in the 2L+ patient 
population of mUM. The safety of tebentafusp may also be acceptable compared to checkpoint 
combination from these data, since a higher rate of treatment-related discontinuations was observed 
with nivolumab + ipilimumab compared to tebentafusp treatment (23.1% and 5.5%, respectively). 
The applicant has provided an analysis of Survival Post Start of Subsequent Therapy by Randomised 
Treatment in the ITT population and this shows no sign of a detriment on OS for either treatment arm, 
which is reassuring. 
The PRO results for the pivotal study were summarised by the applicant. Any differences observed 
should be interpreted with caution since the study was open-label. For the same reason, these results 
are not presented in the SmPC, and this is endorsed. 
It is considered that since HLA genotype is not an efficacy or safety biomarker for mUM patients and it 
is a routine diagnostic test used in other high-risk clinical settings (eg, in organ transplant), there is no 
relevant information regarding results of HLA-genotyping to be updated in the SmPC. Currently, it is 
stated in section 4.2 of the SmPC: ‘Patients treated with KIMMTRAK must have HLA-A*02:01 genotype 
determined by any validated HLA genotyping assay.’ This is considered acceptable.

A small number of patients developed high-titre ADA (≥8192) that resulted in increased tebentafusp 
CL and reduced Cmax exposure. Overall, the development of ADA seems to be in line with other 
immunotherapeutic drugs; however, numbers are too small for any firm conclusions. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results from the pivotal study 202 show a clinically relevant improved efficacy with tebentafusp 
compared to treatments of Investigator’s choice regarding OS in the first-line setting. Moreover, 
efficacy data from the supportive study 102 adds to the totality of the data and supports the 
applicant’s claim for a line-agnostic indication for a targeted disease (mUM), which has not had any 
available treatments with survival benefit for decades. The Applicant is recommended to provide Final 
OS data (which is planned after 250 events in the SAP) as a post-authorisation measure.

a Patients with multiple interruptions or reductions are counted once per unique reason. Percentages are based on 
the number of patients with any interruptions or reductions within each treatment group. 
Interruptions are only counted if study drug administration restarts following interruption. 
Interruptions recorded over consecutive dosing visits are only counted as a single interruption but may have more 
than one reason recorded in 'Reason for interruption at any time'. 
For patients with intra-dose escalation, reductions from protocol dose level are derived at Cycle 1 Day 1 if 
planned dose is less than 20 mcg, at Cycle 1 Day 8 if planned dose is less than 30 mcg, and at Cycle 1 Day 15 if 
planned dose is less than the cohort-specified dose level. In cases where a patient remains on 20 mcg or 30 mcg 
for multiple consecutive doses, each repetition is considered a reduction.

Adverse event 
Other 
Since this was a weekly dosing regimen until progression or unacceptable toxicity, per protocol, 
patients were not prohibited from taking treatment breaks for up to two consecutive doses for any 
reason. It is seen that a considerable number of patients (104 (42.2%)) had one or more dose 
interruptions. The reasons for interruptions were: AEs (34.6%), delayed administration (20.2%) and 
other (68.3%).

In Table 44 it is shown that patients with at least one interruption had a higher median OS (32.3 
months (19.1, NC)) than those without (19.5 months (15.8, 27.4)) which could reflect that patients, 
who are on treatment for longer periods are more likely to have an interruption at some point. Patients 
with interruptions due to AEs had a median OS of 20.2 months (17.4, NC), which is similar to that of 
patients without interruptions. The median OS for patients with interruptions due to other reasons was 
not calculable.

In the provided table 43, it has been specified what the reason for interruptions “other” comprises. A 
great number of these reasons was not registered; “missing” data in 66 (16.9%) patients overall and 
52 (21.2%) patients in study 202. Hereafter, the most frequent reason was “vacation/patient 
preference”; 33 (8.9%) patients overall and 13 (5.3%) patients in study 202. Other listed reasons 
were infrequent. The applicant provided the performance status and other central baseline

Compared to investigator’s choice (pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, dacarbazine), the mean number of 
completed cycles and mean duration of treatment was higher with tebentafusp. Dose intensity was 
equal. However, it is important to note that ipilimumab SmPC recommends a treatment duration of 4 
cycles of 3 weeks which may have an impact the median treatment duration and number of cycles. 
This higher number of cycles in the tebentafusp arm may also be explained by the higher percentage 
of patients who received treatment beyond progression in the experimental arm (27.8% vs 11.9% in 
tebentafusp and comparator arms respectively).

CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; n = number of patients; TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event  
a Determined by the investigator to be possibly related, probably related, definitely related, or related to tebentafusp. 
TEAEs are defined as any adverse event (AE) with a start date from day of first dose of study drug up to 90 days after last dose of study drug 
or until start of alternative cancer therapy post treatment discontinuation, whichever occurs first. Patients with multiple events in the same 
category are counted only once in that category. Patients with events in more than 1 category are counted once in each of those categories. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) include deaths as an outcome of SAEs and non-fatal SAEs. 
Patient IMCGP100-202-6302006 had a Grade 3 TEAE of “pulmonary embolism” which increased to Grade 5. This patient is counted under 
“Grade 5”, “maximum CTCAE Grade 3 or 4”, and “TEAE leading to death” in this table.

n = number of patients; PT = preferred term, SOC = system organ class; TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event 
Patients with multiple TEAEs per SOC or PT are counted only once in each row.  
Adverse events (AEs) are coded using MedDRA version 23.1. 
TEAEs are defined as any AE with a start date from day of first dose of study drug up to 90 days after last dose of study drug or until start of alternative 
cancer therapy post treatment discontinuation, whichever occurs first. 
Number (%) of patients are sorted alphabetically for SOC and by descending frequency overall for PT. A patient can have one or more PTs reported under 
a given SOC.

Figure 33. Change from Baseline Over Time in Systolic Blood Pressure in Study 202 (Safety 
Analysis Set)
During the first month of treatment with tebentafusp, the mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 
decreased 15 mmHg and the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased 20 mmHg which is 
consistent with occurrence of CRS at the beginning of the treatment. Furthermore, mean DBP and SBP 
in the tebentafusp arm remained constantly lower than the mean DBP and SBP in investigator’s choice 
arm by app. 5 and 10 mmHg respectively. This is consistent with the safety profile of tebentafusp.

Figure 36. Uveal Melanoma Patients: Incidence of TEAEs of Special Interest for CRS by Time 
Period (Week) (Safety Analysis Set)
The diagnosis of CRS was based on the most frequently symptoms – pyrexia (64.9%), hypotension 
(24.9%) and infrequently hypoxia (0.4%). Other common symptoms of CRS were chills (29%), 
nausea19.6%), vomiting (13.5%), fatigue (12.2%), and headache (10.6%). CRS was graded 
according to the ASTCT consensus guidelines (Lee et al. 2019) in grade 1-5, with grade 5 being death. 
This was accepted at the pre-submission meeting with the Rapporteurs. 86% of all tebentafusp treated 
patients and 89% of patients in study 202 experienced any grade CRS. Most patients had grade 1 
(19.2%/11.8%) or grade 2 (67%/75.9%), grade 3 was seen in 0.02%/0.8% and grade 4 in 
0.002%/0%. There were no deaths due to CRS and no patients in the investigator’s choice arm 
experienced CRS.  
Most patients experienced CRS following each of the first 3 tebentafusp infusions, with decreasing 
severity and frequency. In the majority of cases, CRS started on the day of infusion (median 1 day) 
and was resolved the day after the infusion (median duration ~ 2 days). Pyrexia was noted in nearly 
all cases of CRS and occurred within the first 8 to 10 hours after tebentafusp infusion. CRS only led 
treatment discontinuation in 1.2% of cases. 
Inpatient monitoring for at least 16 hours after dosing for the first 3 infusions was mandated for all 
patients in the tebentafusp arm due to the rapid (within hours) onset of CRS. Following this induction 
period, the intensity and severity of these events typically decreased, and inpatient monitoring was 
reduced. Prophylactic medication (e.g. corticosteroids, antihistamines) was not administered prior to 
treatment.  
In study 202, the medications used to treat CSR were, by frequency, antipyretics 78.4%, iv fluids 
38%, corticosteroids 23.3%, oxygen (8.2%), vasopressor (0.8% ~ 2 patients) and tocilizumab (0.8% 
~ 2 patients). The majority of patients (61.1%) received only 1 dose of steroids to manage their CRS 
episode.  
CRS is a very common ADR following treatment with tebentafusp. However, it is only in very few cases 
seen in grade 4 and frequency and intensity diminish with further infusions.

Switch in CRS grading system: 
The ASTCT CRS grading system was incorporated in studies 102 and 202 in October 2017. One of the 
main issues is the retrospective grading. 
The FVFP was 04 October 2017 for study 202 and 29 February 2016 for study 102. It is therefore 
expected that patients in study 202 were almost all included under the version of the protocol with the 
Lee grading system while not the case for study 102. The Applicant presented adjudicated CRS and 
maximum grade for studies 102 and 202 with CTCAE grading system (on the model of table 24 of 
summary of clinical safety) for patients included before the setting of Lee grading system and compare 
these data to actual Lee grading system for the same patients.

Figure 37. Uveal Melanoma Patients: Incidence of TEAEs of Special Interest by Time Period 
(Week) (Safety Analysis Set)
Acute skin reactions were a common ADR seen with tebentafusp treatment. Though, the severity was 
within grade 1-3 and symptoms mostly revealed themselves within a few days after infusion, no grade 
4 or 5 ADR’s were seen and the frequency of SAE’s was low.

Electrocardiogram Findings 
The Applicant has stated that there were no clinically meaningful trends in ECG findings and associated 
cardiac AEs in either treatment arm. Please refer to the assessment below. 
Phase  2  dose  expansion  cohort,  cardiac  disorders  (regardless  of  causality)  were  reported  in  38 
(29.9%)  patients.  The  most  commonly  reported  (>1%  of  patients)  cardiac  AEs  related  to  ECG 
abnormalities were tachycardia (11.8%), sinus tachycardia in (9.4%), sinus bradycardia (3.9%), atrial 
fibrillation (3.1%), atrial flutter (2.4%), and supraventricular tachycardia (1.6%). No AEs of torsades de 
pointes were reported. Grade 3 and Grade 4 atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and tachycardia was reported 
in 7 patients (5.5%), and all of these events were considered treatment-related. 
Cardiac AEs led to treatment discontinuation in 2 patients; 1 due to grade 4 atrial fibrillation after 
day  1  treatment,  1  due  to  grade  3  left  ventricular  dysfunction  after  day  8  treatment.  Both  of  these 
cardiac AEs occurred in the setting of sponsor assessed Grade 3  CRS and were considered related to 
tebentafusp treatment by the investigator. No events of Grade 5 severity were reported.  
A tabulated presentation of the cardiac disorders and ECG findings of patients treated with tebentafusp 
in the 102 and 202 studies has been provided.

treated with tebentafusp in the uveal melanoma population (n=410) experienced prolongation of QTcF 
compared  to  baseline  to  values  of  >500  msec.  Increase  in  QTcF  of  >  60  msec  from  baseline  and  a 
prolongation of QTcF to >500 msec are known risk  factors of developing life-threatening arrhythmias 
such as Torsade de Pointes. No patients in the IC arm experienced prolongations of QTcF and the seen 
prolongations are considered drug-induced by treatment with tebentafusp.

a Patients with multiple interruptions or reductions are counted once per unique reason. Percentages are based on the number of patients with 
any interruptions or reductions within each treatment group. 
Interruptions are only counted if study drug administration restarts following interruption. 
Interruptions recorded over consecutive dosing visits are only counted as a single interruption but may have more than one reason recorded in 
'Reason for interruption at any time'. 
For patients with intra-dose escalation, reductions from protocol dose level are derived at Cycle 1 Day 1 if planned dose is less than 20 mcg, 
at Cycle 1 Day 8 if planned dose is less than 30 mcg, and at Cycle 1 Day 15 if planned dose is less than the cohort-specified dose level. In 
cases where a patient remains on 20 mcg or 30 mcg for multiple consecutive doses, each repetition is considered a reduction.

The main reason for interruption was “other” (67.4% and 68.3% in studies 201 and 202, respectively) 
followed by “adverse event” (51.2% and 34.6% in studies 201 and 202 respectively) and “delayed 
administration” (9.3 % and 20.2% in studies 201 and 202 respectively). Regarding dose reduction, 
10.7% of all patients and 7.3% of patients in study 202 experienced a dose reduction, with 7.5% and 
5.7%, respectively, being due to treatment-related AE’s. Moreover, the main reason for dose reduction 
was different in studies 102 and 202. Indeed “adverse event” was the main reason for dose reduction 
in the pivotal study 202 (77.8% of patients) followed by “other” (22.2% of patients) while “other” was 
the main reason for dose reduction in study 102 (64.3% of patients) followed by adverse events

Table 72 . Summary of Other Reasons for Dose Interruptions (Safety Population and 
Tebentafusp Treated Patients)  
The applicant provided the reasons reported as “other” for dose interruptions. In table 13, it is seen 
that 18 patients experienced any dose reduction; 14 patients 1 reduction, 2 patients 2 reductions and 
2 patients 4 reductions. In the supportive studies, additional patients experienced dose reductions. 
Table 4 (below) is listing patients with dose reductions and the reasons for these. Of the 18 patients, 
Table 13, 4 patients experienced dose reductions due to other reasons and 14 patients experienced 
dose reductions due to AEs as summarised below: 
• 2 patients experienced an actual dose reduction to 54 mcg from the prior maintenance dose of 68 as 
per the trial protocol for Grade 3/4 AEs.  
• 12 patients experienced dose reductions (i.e., a delay in intra-patient dose escalation to target dose) 
due to AEs and received a repeat of the previous dose (20 or 30 mcg) consistent with guidance for CRS 
and acute skin toxicity management in the trial protocol and consistent with proposed guidance in the 
SmPC. The reasons for reduction of the planned dose in these patients were most commonly related to 
CRS, acute skin toxicities and LFT abnormalities (below table). 
Dose reductions were primarily due to AEs and occurred mainly in the intra-patient dose escalation. The 
dose reduction was then in the form of a delay in escalation of dose where the patient continues with 
the same dose (20 or 30 mcg) as previously given until toxicity allows for increase to next dose-step. 
This delay was registered as dose reduction.

2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
Tebentafusp currently is not marketed in any country; therefore, no post marketing data is available. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, a total of 372 (245+127) patients in the pivotal study 202 and the supportive study 102 
received at least 1 dose of tebentafusp with the dosing regimen suggested for the current application. 
The cohort is representative of the European population and bearing in mind the low incidence of uveal 
malignant melanoma, the number of treated patients is considered representative and sufficient for a 
robust safety assessment. The patients on average received treatment for a relatively long period of 
time and received full dose when treated. 
With a mean duration of treatment of 34 weeks and mean relative dose intensity of 98.6%, the 
exposure to tebentafusp is considered clinically relevant and robust. However, patient-initiated 
treatment breaks for up to 2 consecutive doses were accepted. The Applicant provided further data 
showing, that there is no indication that treatment interruptions are associated with worse survival 
compared to patients without interruptions. On the contrary, there seems to be a positive association 
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 150/165 
 
 
 
 
between longer time on treatment, allowing for more interruptions, and longer median survival. 
Treatment interruptions do therefore not interfere negatively with response to treatment and can be 
undertaken as it was done in the clinical trial (for up to 2 weeks at a time). This has also been 
sufficiently described in the SmPC. 
Patients were per protocol allowed treatment breaks for up to 2 consecutive treatments and the most 
frequent reason for interruption was “events other than an AE”. The allowance of treatment breaks is 
clinically important information for the treating physician, especially with a treatment that is 
administered weekly (~very often). Patients with incurable cancer in life-prolonging treatment can feel 
very obliged to uphold continuous treatment. It is therefore of great importance if minor treatment 
breaks can be taken without affecting the efficacy of the treatment. 
In order to clarify if and what influence interruptions in treatment had on survival, the applicant 
provided data comparing OS in patients with treatment interruptions to that of patients without. The 
Applicant has presented OS curves for patients without interruptions compared to patients with 1 
interruption vs 1 or more interruptions vs 2 or more interruptions. The OS curves without corrections 
for the immortal time bias suggest that more interruptions are associated with longer survival. This 
could be due to the immortal time bias since interruptions are infrequent and tend to be spaced out 
over time, resulting in patients needing to live longer in order to have more interruptions.  
Treating the occurrence of a second interruption as a time-dependent covariate in a Cox regression 
model resulted in a HR (95% CI) for death of 0.32 (0.14, 0.73), also suggesting an association 
between more interruptions and improved OS. 
There is no indication that treatment interruptions are associated with worse survival compared to 
patients without interruptions. On the contrary, there seems to be a positive association between 
longer time on treatment, allowing for more interruptions, and longer median survival. Treatment 
interruptions do therefore not interfere negatively with response to treatment and can be undertaken 
as it was done in the clinical trial. 
In the SmPC, section 5.1, it is described that treatment breaks of up to 2 consecutive weeks were 
allowed due to the high frequency of treatment and the long treatment period, for some patients. 
The applicant provided extend of exposure by investigator’s choice before randomisation. Data show 
that the numerically lower number of cycles observed in investigator’s choice arm is not driven only by 
ipilimumab arm. As number of cycles is limited to 4 for ipilimumab according to ipilimumab SmPC, it 
could have biased the comparison in the number cycles received. However, even in pembrolizumab 
and dacarbazine arm, median number of cycles started and received as well as duration of treatment 
are in favour of tebentafusp. This is noteworthy, as tebentafusp has a more extensive ADR profile than 
the treatments of the investigator’s choice, and further supports that the toxicities of tebentafusp are 
widely manageable. 
The safety profile of tebentafusp is, due to its mode of action, fundamentally different from that of 
immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) or chemotherapy, which were the therapies used in the 
investigator’s choice arm. This is reflected in the differences between the most frequent AE’s seen in 
study 202. ≥99% of patients in both arms experienced treatment related TEAE’s, any grade. However, 
a large fraction of tebentafusp treated patients (47.6% (all) and 44.5% (202)) experienced grade 3 
and 4 treatment-related AEs compared to only 17.1% in the investigator’s choice arm. Also, the 
incidence of SAE’s for patients treated with tebentafusp was considerably higher than in the control 
arm. Differences in frequencies of the same AE between studies can be observed such as PT of 
periorbital oedema which varied from 63.2% in study 102 phase 1 (all dose) to 26.8% in study 102 
phase 2 and 10.6% in study 202. While this discrepancy may be explained in part by the fact, that 
higher doses were administered in phase 1 of study 102, tebentafusp was administered at the intended 
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 151/165 
 
 
 
dose in phase 2 of study 102 and study 202. The applicant justifies that this discrepancy is likely due 
to difference in coding of AEs by investigators rather than a real difference in incidence of AE. It is 
noted that none of these events led to treatment discontinuation. Oedema is listed as ADR in Table 3 
of the SmPC. 
The PT of pain in extremities, observed in ≥ 10% of tebentafusp-treated patients, is also included in 
Table 3 of SmPC.  
Due to the anticipated risk of hypotension in case of CRS, patients with anti-hypertensive treatment 
were required to temporarily suspend their anti-hypertensive treatment causing hypertension during 
the first few weeks of treatment. The applicant provided blood pressure according to 3 groups of 
patients: those who had their anti-hypertensive treatment withdrawn (n=2), those who remained 
under anti-hypertensive treatment (n=119) and those who were not on anti-hypertensive treatment 
(n=124). Overall, patients with and without anti-hypertensive treatment were balanced within 
tebentafusp group, and mean BP (systolic and diastolic) were higher in patients with anti-hypertensive 
treatment compared to patients without anti-hypertensive treatment. Both curves globally follow that 
same pattern with a BP decrease post-administration of Kimmtrak and an increase up to the next 
treatment. 
Mean BP of the 2 patients who had their anti-hypertensive treatment withdrawn prior the start of 
tebentafusp showed BP elevations. Considering that only 2 patients had their anti-hypertensive 
treatment withdrawn vs 119 not withdrawn, the safety profile from patients receiving anti-hypertensive 
treatment is in majority provided by patients still on anti-hypertensive treatment. Based on review of 
the final safety data from Study 202, the risk for exacerbation of underlying cardiac conditions 
outweighed the potential benefit of holding anti-hypertensives to reduce the risk of CRS. Therefore, the 
applicant proposed not holding anti-hypertensives for patients receiving tebentafusp. This approach is 
consistent with recommendations in the USPI for tebentafusp as well as CRS management guidelines. 
TEAE of hypertension occurred 21/245 patients (8.6%, 12.5 per 100 PY) vs 3/111 (2.7%, 5.6 per 100 
PY) in tebentafusp and investigator’s choice respectively. According to the above analysis, iatrogenic 
hypertension cannot be put forward as only 2 patients had their anti-hypertensive treatment 
withdrawn. PT hypertension was added in SmPC Section 4.8, ADR Table 3.  
The applicant provided an analysis of absolute DBP and SBP measurements limited to pre-dose and 
median of post-dose. It is acknowledged that both curves are superposed. This also means that 
tebentafusp causes a slight hypotension following each administration even in absence of CRS. 
Nevertheless, hypotension is transitory since pre-dose in both arms data clearly overlap. Overall, it is 
endorsed that events of hypotension appears concurrently with CRS and are transitory, without major 
impact on treatment compliance. 
In spite of the more extensive toxicity of tebentafusp, this did not lead to a high rate of dose 
reductions or permanent drug discontinuations (3.7% (all) and 3.3% (202)) and overall, the toxicity of 
tebentafusp can be accepted, as it is manageable.  
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and acute skin toxicity are very common ADRs following treatment 
with tebentafusp. However, only few cases of grade 4 were seen, symptoms mostly revealed within 
few days after infusion and frequency and intensity diminished with further infusions beyond the first 
few. No grade 5 events were observed. The conditions are therefore overall regarded manageable with 
the appropriate treatment facilities and precautions taken. In the SmPC, CRS, as well as the 
management of CRS, is described. It is also described under which conditions and facilities patients 
should be treated due to the high risk of CRS.  
CRS in both studies were prospectively graded with CTCAE then Lee, 2014 grading criteria and 
retrospectively assessed with ASCTC CRS consensus criteria. So, 2 different grading criteria were 
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 152/165 
 
 
 
nevertheless used prospectively. However, all events of CRS in study 102 and 202 were reported 
according to Lee 2014. It appears overall that the ASTCT 2019 being more specific, it identifies more 
CRS events as grade 1 and 2 than CTCAE/Lee, 2014 in both studies. Grade 3 and 4 events are low in 
both studies using each grading system. 0 and 7.9% of patients experienced CRS in study 102 phase 1 
and 2 respectively, while 20.8% of patients experienced CRS in study 202. The lower PT of CRS in 
study 102 is probably due to the evolution of grading system CTCAE>Lee 2014. Indeed, in the 
beginning of study 102, different symptoms and signs of CRS were reported according to CTCAE rather 
than the PT CRS. This is supported by the fact that no CRS were reported according to CTCAE. 
Acute skin reactions were a common ADR seen with tebentafusp treatment. Though, the severity was 
within grade 1-3 and symptoms mostly revealed themselves within a few days after infusion, no grade 
4 or 5 ADRs were seen and the frequency of SAE’s was low. Acute skin syndrome is therefore 
considered manageable and the safety acceptable. 
Table 2 of the SmPC for the management and dose modification for acute skin reactions describes the 
severity of acute skin reaction with a grading system in line with study 202 protocol recommendations. 
The incidence of SAEs for patients treated with tebentafusp is high and substantial compared to the 
incidence in the control arm. However, in spite of the high level of AEs and SAEs related to tebentafusp 
treatment, the permanent discontinuation rate was 3.7% and 3.3% in all patients and in study 202 
respectively, with 2% treatment-related permanent discontinuation in both groups. The rate of SAE’s is 
therefore considered acceptable.  
The degree of hospitalisation is markedly higher within the tebentafusp arm compared to the 
investigator’s choice arm; 40.5% vs 21.4%. This is due to extensions of protocol-mandated 
hospitalisations, the need for prolonged patient monitoring and to SAEs. The requirement for overnight 
hospitalisation and frequent vital signs monitoring for the first 3 treatment doses (dose-escalation) is 
stated in the SmPC 4.2 in the paragraph “First three treatment doses”. Furthermore, it is clearly stated 
in the SmPC, that hospitalisation in connection with the first 3 treatment doses can be prolonged and 
that hospitalisation in order to monitor patients can be needed. 
In study 01, the deaths of 2 patients (03-A725 and 03-B505) were reported with primary cause of 
death due to “unknown” reasons. The deaths occurred 143 and 173 days respectively after 
discontinuation of tebentafusp. Narratives for the patients with death due to “unknown” have been 
provided. It is agreed that deaths were in both cases most likely due to disease progression and not 
related to tebentafusp.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) that were considered treatment-related were substantially higher in the 
tebentafusp arm (22%) compared to the investigator’s choice arm (7%) in study 202. The most 
common were CRS and skin toxicity. The high rate of SAEs are described as manageable and, from the 
presented data, it is agreed that causes of death reported as “due to AE”, “other” or “unknown” were 
not related to treatment with tebentafusp.  
The most frequent severe laboratory abnormality was lymphocytes decreased, which is due to the MoA 
of tebentafusp. The decreases were transient, observed shortly after infusion and clinically 
asymptomatic although a large part was grade 3 or 4. Other haematology parameter variations 
(haemoglobin, leukocytes, neutrophils and platelets) were primarily of grade 1 and a low incidence of 
grade 2 or worse.  
SAEs due to changes in hepatic chemistry was seen in 1 patient and not considered drug-related. None 
were grade 5 events, and none resulted in treatment discontinuation. The changes in other chemical 
parameters such as amylase, calcium, creatinine, glucose, lipase, magnesium, phosphate, potassium 
and sodium were considerable in comparison with the extent seen in the investigator’s choice arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 153/165 
 
 
 
These changes are considered treatment related and have, in recognition of this, been listed in the 
table 3 of ADRs in the SmPC.  
Regarding the patient with left ventricular dysfunction (Patient 1028121), the patient, besides CRS, 
had clinical symptoms of myocardial infarction failure after the day 8 infusion of tebentafusp with 
angina pectoris and troponin increase. The patient was relevantly treated and examined; coronary 
angiography findings were normal. Symptoms resolved and the patient’s LVEF was persistently 56% at 
and after being discharged from the hospital after 1 week. Treatment was permanently discontinued. 
The patient was CT scanned 1 month after being discharged, showing progression, especially in the 
liver metastases. The patient died a month after the CT scan. It is agreed that the patient had most 
likely not developed heart failure due to tebentafusp treatment and most likely died from disease 
progression.  
SAEs related to ECG abnormalities were reported in 5 patients. A description in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC, of cardiac events and conditions and precautions that should be taken in relation to these was 
reflected. Cardiac failure was added to the mentioned cardiac conditions in the SmPC section 4.8, the 
ADR table. Furthermore, SmPC section 4.2 states that tebentafusp has not been studied in patients 
with history of significant cardiac disease. Recommendations for treatment of patients with history of 
cardiac disease has been described in SmPC, section 4.4. 
In study 102 and 202 clinically significant cardiac disease was an exclusion criterion. In section 4.4 of 
the SmPC, a paragraph on “Cardiac disease” has been added with a description of when to perform 
ECGs and how to handle ECG changes. Moreover, a description of the changes observed in the QTc 
interval has been added, since prolongations of ≥500 msec and/or an increase in QTc of ≥60 msec 
from baseline value are also a known risk factors of developing life-threatening arrhythmias, such as 
Torsade de Pointes. 
Furthermore, ECG was not described as a part of the required surveillance regarding tebentafusp 
treatment. It seems highly clinically relevant to recommend ECG surveillance during and after 
treatment with tebentafusp, as up to 30% of patients experienced cardiac disorders, even though this 
might be in conjunction with CRS. This is sufficiently addressed in section 4.4. of the SmPC. 
It is seen that atrial fibrillation has occurred as both grade 3/4 TEAE and as SAE and “atrial fibrillation” 
was therefore added to the mentioned cardiac conditions in 4.8, ADRs, table 3 of the SmPC.  
Although no cardiac events were registered in the patients with QTcF prolongations at this time, QTcF 
prolongations are sufficiently addressed as ADRs in the SmPC. The applicant has also addressed ECG 
measuring before and during treatment as well as suggested interventions in case of QTcF 
prolongations in section 4.4. The augmented risk of additional administration of other medications 
known to induce QTcF prolongation is also described. 
It is endorsed that higher numerical point estimates appears in subgroups with poor prognosis factors 
(larger liver lesion, higher LDH) and in patients in second line or later, patient who previously received 
a checkpoint inhibitor, ECOG 1 vs ECOG 0, baseline ALP and baseline lymphocyte count. These 
differences are not unexpected. Moreover, the subgroup non-white/missing appears to have more all-
grade hepatic toxicities (pool 1 and pool 2) and more acute skin toxicities of grade ≥ 2 and of grade ≥ 3 
(pool 1 and pool 2). The Applicant clarified that subgroup“non-white/missing”consists mainly of 
patient with missing data. In these conditions, it is acknowledged that any interpretation of data would 
be inadequate. 
In the presented analyses, no specific subgroups or intrinsic/extrinsic factors were appointed to be of 
special interest with regards to developing CRS, acute skin toxicity or hepatotoxicity. Although, ADAs 
occurred in approximately a third of patients in study 202, the potential influence on safety has not 
been discussed in the context of safety and therefore, the applicant should provide the sample analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/206916/2022  
Page 154/165 
 
 
 
report for study 202 and commit to submit the final NAb report once finalised (please refer to clinical 
pharmacology). Moreover, available data do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn on the effect of 
ADAs on efficacy or the safety profile of tebentafusp. The Applicant has clearly stated in the SmPC that 
there was no evidence of ADA impact on safety or efficacy of tebentafusp, although the small number 
of patients who developed high titre ADA precludes firm conclusions regarding their clinical impact.   
Data on dose reductions of 2 patients is insufficient for safety evaluation. SmPC 4.2 reflects that no 
dose reductions are recommended, instead adverse reactions should be managed by withholding or 
discontinuing tebentafusp treatment. The management and dose modification tables in the SmPC 
Section 4.2, table 1 provides guidance on when to withhold dose or delay dose escalation based on 
severity of acute skin reactions and CRS. The extent of treatment interruptions, reductions and 
discontinuation is within the range of what would be expected in the metastatic setting of uveal 
melanoma and is acceptable. Clear guidance in the SmPC regarding, when dose interruption and/or a 
stop in dose-escalation is provided. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Tebentafusp has a quite extensive degree of toxicity. There were more treatment-related AEs and 
SAEs than what was seen with investigator’s choice (immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapy). 
However, the ADRs diminished over time with continued treatment beyond the first few (often 3) 
treatment cycles, the incidence of grade 4 AEs was low and no grade 5 were registered. The 
discontinuation rate and dose reduction rate were low and no treatment related deaths were reported. 
The overall conclusion from the presented data is, that the toxicity from tebentafusp, although wide-
ranging, is manageable.  
The adverse drug reactions from tebentafusp can, to a great extent, be explained by its mode of 
action. The most frequent ones being CRS and (acute) skin toxicity. The nature and high frequency of 
the ADRs, especially CRS, is quite different from most of the currently available anti-cancer treatments 
and implies that the conditions, under which the patients receive their treatment, need to be suitable. 
Hence, the right clinical set-up is very important when treating patients with tebentafusp. This 
information is sufficiently reflected in the SmPC.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is {DD.MM.YYYY.}. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions 
A request of translation exemption of the labelling as per Art 63(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following 
reasons: 
the very low prevalence of the disease and low production volumes, and that the product will be 
handled and administered only by healthcare professionals. 
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed 
materials will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
2.9.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Kimmtrak (tebentafusp) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Kimmtrak is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) A*02:01 
positive adult patients with unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Metastatic uveal melanoma is an uncurable disease, which has not had any systemic treatment 
advances with a survival benefit for decades. Approximately 50% of the patients diagnosed with 
primary and localised uveal melanoma develop metastatic disease, usually in the form of multiple liver 
metastases. Since there are no standard of care for these patients with mUM, who are recommended 
to participate in a clinical trial, there exists a high unmet medical need for new and effective 
treatments. Once patients develop metastatic UM (mUM), the prognosis and outcomes are dismal, with 
a median survival of approximately 12 months (Rantala, 2019; Khoja, 2019). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study is an ongoing Phase 3, open-label, multicentre randomised study evaluating the 
efficacy and safety of tebentafusp versus investigator’s choice (dacarbazine, ipilimumab, and 
pembrolizumab) in adult HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM), who 
have not received prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting. The patients included were 
randomised 2:1 to receive either tebentafusp or therapy of the investigator’s choice and the treatment 
options in the comparator arm are endorsed (n=378). The pivotal phase 3 study 202 is supported by 
results from the phase 1-2 study 102 (n=127). 
The pivotal study was fully recruited from 54 sites (14 countries) in less than 3 years and at the time 
of the data cut-off 13 October 2020, the median follow-up for all patients was initially 14.1 months. 
Further updated efficacy data has been provided with the DCO 12 August 2021 and approximately 8 
months longer follow up for OS (total median FU: 22.4 months).  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint of the pivotal study, overall survival (OS), was prolonged in the primary analysis 
at a 40% event rate by 5.7 months with tebentafusp from 16 months to 21.7 months, HR 0.51 
(95%CI: 0.37, 0.71). The KM curves clearly separate after approximately 3 months of therapy and 
stay separated. The updated OS data at a 54% event rate continued to favour the tebentafusp arm 
(median OS 21.7 months vs 16.7 months, HR=0.58; 95%CI 0.44, 0.77).  
The primary endpoint of the supportive study showed a median OS of 16.8 months in a pre-treated 
study population after a median follow up of ~20 months and 54.3% OS events. 
In the pivotal study, the secondary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) was statistically 
significantly improved with tebentafusp, as the median PFS was prolonged by 0.4 months from 2.9 
months to 3.3 months, HR 0.73 (95%CI: 0.58, 0.94). In the supportive study, median PFS was 2.8 
months (95%CI: (2.0, 3.7) in the pre-treated population.

EMA/206916/2022  
Page 160/165 
 
 
 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The primary analysis of OS in the pivotal study was considered rather mature with 40% observed OS 
events, and of these 34.5% events were observed in the tebentafusp arm versus 50% events in the 
control arm after a median follow-up of ~14 months (DCO 13 October 2020). Mature updated OS data 
with 50.4% and 62.7% events, in each arm respectively, have been provided. However, it is noted 
that this updated analysis occurred after patients on therapy of investigator’s choice started to cross-
over to tebentafusp and this hampers the updated and future results of the primary endpoint of the 
pivotal trial, which was also the main endpoint that was clinically meaningfully improved. Final OS data 
will be provided as a post-authorisation measure (REC). 
The PFS data from both studies are considered mature. In the pivotal study, the KM curves never 
clearly separate and the shape of the PFS KM curve show that a high number of patients had events at 
every time point of evaluation, including at the first evaluation after 12 weeks. However, there did not 
seem to be significant evaluation-time bias and the PFS results are considered robust. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most frequent AE’s reported for the tebentafusp-treated patients of the pivotal study 202 were in 
all patients/study 202 were: cytokine release syndrome (89%), pyrexia (78.5%/76.3%), pruritus 
(72%/69%), nausea (57.1%/49%), fatigue (56.5%/51%), chills (54.9%/47.8%), rash (51%/55.1%), 
hypotension (41.5%/38.8%), vomiting (36.1%/29.8%), dry skin (35.1/31.4%) and headache 
(32.9%/30.6%).

Any AEs of grade 3 or 4 were reported in 58.3% of all patients and in 54.3% of patients in study 202, 
respectively and the majority were treatment-related. The most frequent grade 3-4 AE were in all 
patients/ patients in study 202: rash maculo-papular (9.5%/8.6%), rash (7.6%/9.4%), hypertension 
(7.6%/8.6%), hypophosphataemia (6.1%/4.1%), ASAT increase (6.1%/5.3%), hypotension

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The benefit of tebentafusp compared to treatments by Investigator’s choice in the first-line setting of 
metastatic uveal melanoma is considered highly clinically meaningful, since updated mature OS data 
show a survival benefit of 5.0 months (HR 0.58). The efficacy data from study 102 are considered 
supportive of the applied line-agnostic indication because data show that treatment with tebentafusp 
results in clinically meaningful efficacy in a pre-treated population as well. This should be interpreted in 
the context that there is no standard of care for patients with mUM, neither in the first-line setting nor 
beyond. This data showed an encouraging OS of 16.8 months, which is markedly better than historic 
controls treated with chemotherapy or Anti-PD-1 monotherapy in a 2+ line setting and has a median 
OS of 6-9 months, while acknowledging the uncertainties inherent in cross-study comparisons, not

least with regard to time-to-event endpoints that are strongly affected by heterogeneity with regard to 
the underlying prognosis of the study populations.  
These clinically relevant data from both the first and later-line settings should be considered in the 
context that there has been no standard of care with any survival benefit for the targeted disease of 
metastatic uveal melanoma available for decades. 
Even though there were no clinically relevant differences in PFS and ORR with tebentafusp, the 
clinically significant survival benefit is considered a robust result and is considered in line with similar 
results observed with other immunotherapies, where a clinically meaningful improvement of OS is not 
necessarily supported by PFS benefit. Moreover, updated OS results with more events (54%) did not 
change the results significantly. 
The main reported adverse events related to treatment with tebentafusp are cytokine release 
syndrome, rash, pyrexia, pruritis, fatigue, nausea, chills, hypo/hyperpigmentation, abdominal pain, 
oedema, hypotension, dry skin, headache and vomiting. However, the ADRs diminished over time with 
continued treatment beyond the first few (often 3) treatment cycles and the incidence of high-grade 
events was low. The discontinuation rate due to any AE was also low (3.3%) and no treatment related 
deaths were reported. The overall conclusion from the presented data is, that the toxicity from 
tebentafusp, although wide-ranging, is manageable and can be explained by its mode of action. The 
nature and high frequency of the ADRs, especially cytokine-release syndrome (CRS), is quite different 
from most of the currently available anti-cancer treatments and implies that the conditions, under 
which the patients receive their treatment, need to be suitable. Hence, the right clinical set-up is very 
important when treating patients with tebentafusp.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The efficacy of tebentafusp is considered clinically relevant in the first-line and beyond treatment 
setting (line agnostic) of patients with HLA-A*02:01-positive unresectable or metastatic uveal 
melanoma and the toxicity appears manageable. It can therefore be concluded that the benefits 
outweigh the risks. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Kimmtrak is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome

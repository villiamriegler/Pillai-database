Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Votubia, the scientific conclusions of 
PRAC are as follows:  
During the reporting period of this PSUR, the MAH also performed a review of cases of pneumocystis 
jirovecii  pneumonia  (PJP,  PCP)  following  request  of  the  FDA  to  update  the  labeling  information  of 
everolimus. Cases of PJP/PCP, some with fatal outcome, have been reported in patients who received 
everolimus. Thus the MAH proposed changes also for the EU SmPC, to which the PRAC agreed. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding PJP/PCP, the PRAC considered that changes to the product 
information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Votubia, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance everolimus is favourable subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

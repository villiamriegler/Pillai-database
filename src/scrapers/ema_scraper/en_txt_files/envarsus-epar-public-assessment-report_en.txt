2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Tacrolimus (ATC code: L04AD02) is a potent immunosuppressive agent approved for the prophylaxis of 
organ rejection (Prograf - first approved product (liver, kidney or heart allograft recipients) and 
subsequently Advagraf (kidney or liver allograft recipients)) (both MAH is Astellas). Advagraf is a 
tacrolimus sustained release capsule formulation approved in the EU in 2007.

Page 7/118 
 
  
 
 
This is a centralised marketing authorisation application for Envarsus (0.75 mg, 1 mg and 4 mg) which 
is a prolonged release formulation of tacrolimus designed for once daily oral administration. This 
application is made under Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC with Advagraf (EU/1/07/387/001-026) 
as European reference medicinal product. The applicant has submitted data to bridge with the reference 
medicinal product Advagraf (Study 1017). This study supports the bridge under article 10(3) of Directive 
2001/83/EC with the reference medicinal product. Furthermore the applicant has submitted additional 
data to support the differences with the reference medicinal product (different strengths, different 
pharmaceutical form) including several clinical studies in order to support the efficacy and safety of 
Envarsus (LCP-Tacro)) in comparison to the clinical comparator Prograf, an authorised and widely used 
tacrolimus product. Prograf (immediate release tacrolimus UK PL00166/0206 MAH Astellas Pharma 
Europe B.V.) authorised in the EU in 1999 is used as the clinical comparator in the studies’ supporting the 
differences versus the reference medicinal product (hereinafter ‘additional data’). Advagraf and Prograf 
are part of the same global marketing authorisation according to article 6 of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
About the product 
Tacrolimus blocks T-cell activation and proliferation by inhibiting the activity of the calcium-activated 
serine threonine phosphatase, Calcineurin. Tacrolimus reduces the expression of several cytokine genes 
that are normally induced on T-cell activation. These include interleukin-2, whose synthesis by 
T-lymphocytes is an important growth signal for T cells (Vicari-Christensen et al., 2009). The 
suppression of T-cell activation by tacrolimus inhibits the subsequent generation of cytotoxic 
lymphocytes and thereby down-regulates the processes leading to acute graft rejection. 
Although the pharmacotherapeutic mainstay in post-transplant immunosuppression, the PK profile of 
tacrolimus is characterized by high degree of inter- and intra-individual variability (Venkataramanan et 
al., 1995). Therefore, standard dosing is not an accurate predictor of actual drug exposure. In clinical 
practice, tacrolimus dose adjustments are required based on monitoring of tacrolimus trough blood 
concentrations, which correlate well with the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and 
provide an acceptable measure of exposure. 
Type of application and aspect on development 
This application has been submitted in accordance with Article 10(3) of the Directive 2001/83/EC– 
hybrid application – application for a medicinal product referring to a so-called reference medicinal 
product with a Marketing Authorisation in a Member State or in the Union on the basis of a complete 
dossier in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of Directive 2001/83/EC and which is or has been 
authorised in accordance with Union provisions in force for not less than 6/10 years in the EEA. 
The European reference medicinal product authorised is Advagraf: Prolonged-release capsule, hard; 
Marketing authorisation number: Astellas Pharma Europe B.V.; Marketing authorisation number: 
EU/1/07/387/001-026 date of authorisation: 23.04.2007  
Studies supporting the differences versus the reference medicinal product (hereinafter ‘additional data’) 
includes the ‘standard-of-care’ Prograf as clinical comparator (immediate release tacrolimus UK 
PL00166/0206 MAH Astellas Pharma Europe B.V. authorised in the EU in 1999) as Advagraf and Prograf 
are part of the same global marketing authorisation according to article 6 of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Scientific Advice was sought twice from the CHMP. In 2008, with respect to the proposed q.d. dosing of 
LCP-Tacro, the CHMP agreed that the data available at that time supported q.d. dosing and stated that 
“reduced PK variability may lead to a possible therapeutic advantage in terms of reduced need for dose 
monitoring”. Additionally, the CHMP was generally in agreement with the proposed clinical Phase 2 and 
Phase 3 development programmes in support of a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) (CHMP 
Scientific Advice, January 2008). 
CHMP assessment report 
Envarsus 
EMA/CHMP/81205/2014 
Page 8/118 
 
  
In March 2010, the CHMP indicated that data from clinical Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies alone are not 
anticipated to be sufficiently robust to establish therapeutic equivalence of LCP-Tacro to the 
standard-of-care Prograf in the respective patient populations. However, this was based upon review of 
the protocols for planned clinical Phase 2 and 3 studies only. Further evidence is now available and 
included in the present MAA by inclusion of the Phase 2 study results from Study LCP-Tacro 2017 and 
data from the pivotal clinical Phase 3 Study LCP-Tacro 3001. The CHMP also clearly stated “that the 
proposal to submit phase III studies after the grant of MAA is not acceptable since the phase II studies 
do not appear to be sufficiently robust in establishing equivalence of LCP-Tacro in relevant patient 
populations, in particular de novo transplant patients. The inclusion of Study 3001 in the initial MAA 
package is unlikely to overcome this problem”. Further evidence is now available and included in the 
present MAA by inclusion of the data from the pivotal clinical Phase 3 Study LCP-Tacro 3002. 
The CHMP also indicated that the size of the proposed safety database for appears acceptable to support 
a MAA and that “extrapolation to the wider tacrolimus bibliographic data would be feasible” (CHMP 
Scientific Advice, March 2010). 
During the procedure, the Applicant has changed the proposed invented name from Tacrolimus Veloxis 
to Envarsus. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Envarsus is presented as prolonged-release tablets containing 0.765mg, 1.02mg and 4.08mg of 
tacrolimus monohydrate which are equivalent to 0.75mg, 1mg and 4mg of tacrolimus, respectively as 
active substance.  
Other ingredients are: hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, polyethylene glycol, poloxamer, magnesium 
stearate, tartaric acid, butylated hydroxytoluene and dimethicone 
The product is available in PVC blisters, packed in an aluminium foil wrapper containing a desiccant. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The chemical name of tacrolimus monohydrate is:  
(1R,9S,12S,13R,14S,17R,21S,23S,24R,25S,27R)-1,14-dihydroxy-12-[(1E)-1-[(1R,3R,4R) 
-4-hydroxy-3-methoxycyclohexyl]prop-1-en-2-yl]-23,25-dimethoxy-13,19,21,27-tetramethyl 
-17-(prop-2-en-1-yl)-11,28-dioxa-4-azatricyclo[22.3.1.0^{4,9}]octacos-18-ene-2,3,10,16 
-tetronemonohydrate 
and has the following structure: 
CHMP assessment report 
Envarsus 
EMA/CHMP/81205/2014 
Page 9/118 
 
  
 
Tacrolimus is a well-known active substance which is not described in the European Pharmacopoeia. 
Tacrolimus is white to off-white powder; it is soluble in methanol, ethanol, acetone, ethyl acetate and 
chloroform. It is insoluble in water. Tacrolimus is an optically active molecule. The results obtained 
across batches confirm the right stereochemistry of the molecule.  
The structural elucidation of Tacrolimus is evidenced based on the route of manufacture and Elemental 
Analysis, Infrared Spectroscopy (IR), (1H NMR), (13C NMR), and Mass Spectroscopy. Other 
characteristics like crystalline nature and polymorphism have been demonstrated by using Differential 
Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Powder X Ray Diffraction (XRD). 
In the solid state tacrolimus exists as one conformer, in aqueous solutions tacrolimus epimerises to two 
tautomers, reaching an equilibrium containing three forms. This is considered an inherent property of 
the molecule, and the tautomeric forms do not alter the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus. 
Pharmacological activities of tautomer I and II have been reported to be similar to that of tacrolimus, 
and the immunosuppressive activity of tacrolimus was found to be associated with the cis-trans 
conversion. 
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File 
(ASMF) procedure. 
Manufacture 
An ASMF is used for information on the drug substance. The structure of tacrolimus has been adequately 
proven and its physico-chemical properties sufficiently described.  The synthesis of tacrolimus is well 
described. The manufacturing process has been differentiated as process A and process B. 
Manufacturing process validation data has been provided for both processes. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Specification 
The active substance specification has been established in-house by the ASMF holder and the applicant. 
Both specifications include tests for description, identification (IR, HPLC), water content (Ph Eur), 
Residue on ignition (Ph Eur), specific optical rotation (Ph Eur), residual solvents (GC), heavy metals (Ph 
Eur), related substances and assay (HPLC).  
CHMP assessment report 
Envarsus 
EMA/CHMP/81205/2014 
Page 10/118 
 
  
 
 
All methods and acceptance criteria included in the drug substance specifications of the ASMF holder and 
applicant have been described and justified and are acceptable.  
Batch analysis data and certificate of analysis (CoA’s) have been presented by the active substance 
manufacturer demonstrating compliance with the drug substance specification for three commercial 
scale batches of the original manufacturing process and of three commercial scale batches of the 
optimized process. 
Stability 
Stability data was provided for three process A batches of the active substance at 25ºC/60% RH (60 
months) and 40ºC/75% RH (6 months) and three process B batches of the active substance at long term 
conditions 25ºC/60% RH (12 months) and accelerated conditions 40ºC/75% RH (6 months) as per ICH 
guidelines. The batches were stored in packaging material used for routine storage and distribution of 
the active substance (double transparent low density polyethylene (LDPE) bags closed with plastic ties. 
A silica gel sachet is placed between the two LDPE bags and does not come into contact with the drug 
substance. The sealed LDPE bags are then placed inside aluminium containers). 
The following parameters were tested: Description, identification (IR, XRD), water content (KF), specific 
optical rotation (Ph. Eur), content of tautomers (HPLC), Assay (HPLC) and related substances (HPLC). 
Both process A and process B batches remain stable at long term conditions; no significant changes and 
specific trends have been observed. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The product is developed as a prolonged-release formulation. Pharmaceutical development is described 
with special regard to formulation development especially with respect to the development of the 
erodible matrix containing hypromellose as the release controlling polymer.  
The purpose of the formulation was to obtain a stable formulation (a solid dispersion of tacrolimus in a 
polymer matrix of polyglycols) with the purpose of increasing the bioavailability of this poorly 
water-soluble active substance. The product was formulated to achieve once daily dosing with reduced 
strengths as compared to the immediate release reference medicinal product formulation requiring twice 
daily dosage. 
The applicant used the MeltDose technology to develop the product in the form of prolonged-release 
tablets. The MeltDose technology produces granules suitable for direct compaction into tablets. The 
extended release properties of this tablet formulation make it suitable for a once a- day dosing. The drug 
release is extended by means of an erodible matrix containing hypromellose as the release controlling 
polymer. 
Three tablet strengths are intended to be marketed. The 0.75mg strength is the lowest proposed 
strength that will be marketed. However, the applicant did not carried out any bioequivalence studies to 
confirm the adequacy of the dose and provided only supportive dissolution studies. After the assessment 
of the 0.75mg strength vis-à-vis development program it can be stated that the formulation of the 
0.75mg strength is virtually identical to the 1mg formulation with the only differences being that the 
vehicle ingredients are increased in the 0.75mg strength to compensate for the lower amount of active. 
CHMP assessment report 
Envarsus 
EMA/CHMP/81205/2014 
Page 11/118 
 
  
Bioequivalence study was performed showing bioequivalence between the clinical formulation and the 
proposed commercial formulation 
The lowest strength for which a bioequivalence study was carried out was the 0.5mg strength (not 
marketed) (formulation D) bioequivalence was shown.  
The formulation and manufacturing parameters that can affect the performance of the finished product 
in regard to the in vitro dissolution profile of tacrolimus were investigated. Excipients were selected 
based on their compatibility with the active substance, manufacturability, and impact on performance of 
the finished product.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The primary packaging is PVC blisters containing 10 prolonged-release tablets. 3 blisters are packed 
together in an aluminium foil wrapper containing a desiccant. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Adventitious agents 
The applicant provided a BSE statement form the manufacturer of Lactose Monohydrate and a 
declaration from the manufacturer of Magnesium Stearate stating that Magnesium Stearate is of plant 
origin. 
 No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process is considered as a non-standard process in view of the MeltDose technology 
used. The manufacturing process for tacrolimus prolonged-release tablets consists of the following 
steps: melting and dissolving active substance, fluid bed granulation, sieving of granules, mixing of 
granules with extra granular excipients and compression into tablets. The first steps, melting and 
dissolving API, fluid bed granulation and sieving, are identical for all strengths. The process is adequately 
described and the critical process parameters have been discussed. Appropriate IPC have been put in 
place. For the validation of the manufacturing process for tacrolimus prolonged-release tablets, 3 
consecutive batches of each of the commercial strengths were manufactured in commercial scale and 
tested according to the proposed release specification which is acceptable. The applicant also carried out 
additional testing to further confirm that the process is suitably qualified to be used for commercial 
manufacture. 
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification 
The specification was elaborated in accordance with Ph. Eur. general monographs: “Microbiological 
quality of non-sterile pharmaceutical preparations and substances for pharmaceutical use”. The applied 
methods are based on Ph. Eur. or are in-house methods. 
The control of finished product quality is done via in-house specifications. The product specification 
includes tests for appearance (visual), identification (HPLC; colorimetric test), assay of tacrolimus 
CHMP assessment report 
Envarsus 
EMA/CHMP/81205/2014 
Page 12/118 
 
  
(HPLC), assay of BHT (HPLC) uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), 
dissolution (HPLC), water content (KF), and microbial test (Ph Eur). The release and shelf life 
specifications differ with regard to uniformity of dosage, assay of BHT and identification.  
The analytical methods were adequately described and validated. Batch analytical data were presented 
for six commercial batches (2 batches per strength) produced by the proposed commercial 
manufacturing process, demonstrating compliance with the release specification and confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three commercial batches per strength stored at 25°C/60%RH (30-36 months), 
30°C/65%RH (12 months) and 40°C/75%RH (6 months) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The batches were stored in the primary packaging for commercial supply.  
During stability studies the following parameters are controlled: appearance, assay of the active 
substance (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), dissolution (HPLC), moisture content (KF) and 
microbiological purity (Ph. Eur). The ranges of controlled parameters are appropriate for verification of 
quality and stability of the drug product 
Photo-stability studies were also carried-out in accordance to ICH guideline Q1B. One batch per strength 
was placed on the stability study. Results of the studies confirmed that Tacrolimus prolonged-release 
tablets are sensitive to light and should be protected from light during storage. 
The applicant also carried out in-use stability studies on tacrolimus prolonged release tablets which were 
carried out on blister cards which have been removed from the aluminium bag and the desiccant 
discarded. Two studies were carried out, the first covering a 30 day test point whilst the second covered 
a three month test period. In order to comply with the requirements of the Note for Guidance on in-use 
stability testing of human medicinal products (CPMP/QWP/2934/99) to test at least one batch towards 
the end of its shelf-life, a 24 months old drug product batch was selected for the in-use stability study, 
which was completed at the 3 month test station. In the first in-use study 12-months old drug product 
was used.  
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of tacrolimus are well known. The new 
formulation is not expected to alter the pharmacology of tacrolimus (such as the immunosuppressant 
characteristics and actions on non-immune systems which have been thoroughly evaluated as part of 
the previous MA for tacrolimus), no further non-clinical studies were provided by the applicant and this 
was deemed acceptable by the CHMP. The non-clinical overview based on literature review provided by 
the applicant is, thus, appropriate to support the non-clinical aspects of this MAA.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Tacrolimus is a well-known macrolide immuno-suppressant. Its pharmacology in the prevention and 
treatment of organ transplant rejection is well documented in the literature. No new pharmacodynamic 
studies have been performed in relation to this application. A summary review of the most salient 
pharmacology studies is presented as part of this assessment. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Tacrolimus has been demonstrated to act via several mechanisms of actions with the central mechanism 
for its immunosuppressive action being the inhibition of the activated serine threonine phosphatase, 
calcineurin, in T-lymphocytes. The molecular mechanism of tacrolimus has been extensively studied and 
reviewed in the literature. In essence this involves the inhibition of the activated serine threonine 
phosphatase, calcineurin, in T-lymphocytes which is the central mechanism for the immunosuppressive 
action of tacrolimus (Plosker and Foster, 2000; Scott et al, 2003). 
Immunosuppressive Action 
Tacrolimus is a highly potent immunosuppressive agent and has proven activity and efficacy in both in 
vitro and in vivo studies. In vitro tacrolimus has been demonstrated to inhibit the proliferative responses 
of lymphocytes to allogen and mitogen stimulation, the cytotoxic T-cell generation, the expression of the 
IL-2 receptor and the production of IL-2, IL-3 and IFN- γ (Kino et al, 1987; Scott et al, 2003). The 
immunosuppressive efficacy of tacrolimus has been demonstrated in various animal models of 
transplantation (Collier et al., 1987; Muarase et al, 1987; Ochiai et al, 1987; Inamura et al., 1988; Todo 
et al, 1987, 1988; Jiang et al, 1999; Kinugasa et al., 2008). Most of these studies have now been 
superseded by clinical data. 
Actions in Non Immune Tissues 
Adverse side effects of tacrolimus including neurotoxicity and post-transplant diabetes are suggested to 
result from the inhibition of calcineurin. Calcineurin and FKBP12 are abundant in the central nervous 
system and evidence has been provided that calcineurin mediated NF-AT activation is also necessary for 
gene transcription within nerve cells. Thus inhibition of calcineurin could form the basis for the 
CHMP assessment report 
Envarsus 
EMA/CHMP/81205/2014 
Page 14/118 
 
  
pathophysiology of neurotoxicity observed in patients on calcineurin inhibitor therapy (Tan and 
Robinson, 2006). 
Calcineurin inhibition may also contribute to post-transplant diabetes by diminishing β-cell survival and 
replication (Soleimanpour et al, 2010). Following treatment with tacrolimus, human β-cell apoptosis was 
significantly increased. Tacrolimus significantly decreased rodent β-cell replication, no human β-cell 
replication was observed. The relevance of calcineurin in β-cell growth and function was further 
demonstrated in a murine model of β-cell specific calcineurin deletion (Heit et al, 2006). The mice 
displayed a phenotype of age-dependent diabetes and decreased β-cell proliferation. Expression of 
numerous genes known to be critical for β-cell function and proliferation was reduced. 
Tacrolimus-induced TGF-ß hyperexpression has been implicated in the nephrotoxicity observed with the 
clinical use of tacrolimus (Plosker and Foster, 2000). Further possible mechanisms for the development 
of a nephrotoxicity include modulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) dependent signaling 
and activation of NFкB in fibroblasts and mesangial cells. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The impact of tacrolimus administration upon the cardiovascular system was investigated by both in 
vitro and in vivo animal studies. 
Electrophysiologiological Effects 
In vitro in human embryonic kidney 293 cells supra-therapeutic concentrations of tacrolimus 
(>0.1 µmol/l) inhibited the hERG potassium channel with a maximum inhibition of 28% at 10 µmol/l 
(Kise et al, 2009). 
In isolated rat ventricular myocytes it has been demonstrated that tacrolimus has the potential to 
directly inhibit the transient outward potassium current (Ito) and the delayed rectifier potassium current 
(Ik) and prolongs the action potential (DuBuell, et al, 1997). Prolongation of the action potential by 
tacrolimus was suggested to be more complex as previously reported by Fauconnier et al, 2005. In 
single rat ventricular cells using the whole cell clamp method to record action potentials and ionic 
currents, the prolongation of the action potential was demonstrated to result from an inhibition of three 
distinct potassium currents: the delayed rectifier current (Ik >80%), the transient outward current (Ito 
<20%) and the inward rectifier current (Ik1 >40%). In addition, a use dependent increase in Ca++ entry, 
initiated by frequency dependent facilitation of ICaL has permissive effects for the occurrence of early 
after depolarizations with a contribution of INaCa. 
In vivo a sustained QTc prolongation was induced in guinea pigs by tacrolimus administered 
intravenously at drug concentrations corresponding to its therapeutic range (Minematsu et al, 1999). In 
line with this finding, the QTc interval and MAP90(sinus) were prolonged by tacrolimus in a dose-related 
manner in the halothane-anesthetized dog (Kise et al 2009).  
Clinical case reports exist in the literature suggesting tacrolimus to be associated with a prolongation of 
the QT interval, an increase in QTc dispersion or torsade de point in transplant patients (Johnson et al, 
1992; Hodak et al, 1998; Gerhardt et al, 2001; Nishimura et al, 2002). 
Haemodynamic effects 
Tacrolimus was demonstrated to increase mean arterial blood pressure in the conscious rat (Gardiner et 
al, 2004). Hypertension is one of the most common adverse events that occur in patients treated with 
tacrolimus (Plosker and Foster, 2000), which is reflected in the product information.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No non-clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of LCP-Tacro 
tablets. The pharmacokinetics parameters and profile for LCP-Tacro tablets were evaluated as part of the 
development program in two Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers and four Phase 2 studies in kidney 
and liver transplant patients. Distribution, metabolism, and excretion of tacrolimus or potential 
pharmacokinetic drug interactions with tacrolimus are well described in the literature and are briefly 
summarized below. 
Absorption  
Data from the literature has shown that tacrolimus is able to be absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal 
tract. Available tacrolimus is generally rapidly absorbed. Absorption is variable and the mean oral 
bioavailability of tacrolimus is in the range of 20%-25% (individual range in adult patients 6%-43%). 
No absorption studies were conducted by the applicant and this is acceptable to the CHMP. 
Distribution 
Data from animal studies described in the literature has shown that tacrolimus is distributed extensively 
in the body into most tissues including the lungs, spleen, heart, kidney, pancreas, brain, muscle and liver 
(Scott et al, 2003). In renal and liver transplant patients receiving intravenous tacrolimus, the volume of 
distribution was 1.41 and 0.85 L/kg.  
No distribution studies were conducted by the applicant and this is acceptable to the CHMP. 
Metabolism 
Data from literature has shown that tacrolimus is extensively metabolized in the liver and small intestine 
and so far eight metabolites have been identified (Iwasaki et al, 2007). Metabolite formation is 
qualitatively similar across species. Formation of the major metabolite (M-1) is the first step and main 
pathway of tacrolimus metabolism. Tacrolimus is predominantly metabolized by the CYP3A subfamily 
including rat CYP3A2 and human CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 (M-1 formation and total metabolism). Other 
human CYPs such as the 1A, 2A, 2C, 2D and 2E subfamilies do not metabolize tacrolimus and M-1. 
Using a mixed lymphocyte reaction system, metabolite M-II is active while the major metabolite M-1 and 
other metabolites showed only weak or negligible activity (Iwasaki et al, 2007). 
Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in the genes encoding for CYP3A4 
and CYP3A5 and recent studies focused on the relationship of the CYP3A5 genotype and the dose 
selection of tacrolimus (Staaz et al, 2010 a, b). However, to date, it is not clear whether 
pharmacogenetic profiling can be a useful clinical tool for personalizing immunosuppressant therapy.  
No metabolism studies were conducted by the applicant and this is acceptable to the CHMP. 
Excretion 
Data from literature has shown that following intravenous injection of 14C-labelled tacrolimus to rats, 
95% of the dose was excreted in the faeces (Iwasaki et al, 2007). In bile duct cannulated rats excretion 
of radioactivity was mainly in the bile (82% of the dose) suggesting that the bile is the main route of 
elimination. Less than 0.4% of unchanged tacrolimus was detected in the urine, bile and faeces of rats 
after intravenous and oral administration.

No excretion studies were conducted by the applicant and this is acceptable to the CHMP. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Tacrolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4/5 and p-glycoprotein (Iwasaki et al, 2007). 
Concomitant use of inhibitors or inducers of the hepatic and intestinal microsomal CYP3A isoenzymes 
may affect tacrolimus metabolism and may cause an increase or decrease of tacrolimus blood level 
which may impact the efficacy or the toxicity of the compound. Therefore, the monitoring of tacrolimus 
blood levels is recommended when compounds which have the potential to alter the CYP3A metabolism 
are used concomitantly and to adjust the dose as appropriate. 
The potential interactions between tacrolimus and CYP3A inhibitors or inducers have been extensively 
reviewed (Iwasaki, 2007; Scott et al, 2003). CYP3A4 inhibitors and induces potentially leading to 
increased or decreased tacrolimus blood levels.  
Tacrolimus in addition has been described as an inhibitor of CYP3A (Amundsen et al, 2012) and may 
affect the metabolism of other medicinal products. 
Tacrolimus is extensively bound to plasma proteins (approximately 99%) and interactions may occur 
with compounds which are also highly protein-bound (Nagase et al, 1994). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicity of tacrolimus has been previously well described in the literature. Therefore, no new toxicity 
studies were conducted by the applicant with the prolonged release formulation of tacrolimus, which is 
accepted by the CHMP. 
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies were conducted by the applicant which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Signs of general toxicity as well as the target organs of toxicity have been identified. Target organs of 
toxicity include the kidneys, the pancreas, the heart, the nervous system, the eyes and the lymphoid 
organs.  
Kidneys: The kidneys have been identified as major target organs of tacrolimus toxicity (Ohara et al., 
1990). In oral repeat dose toxicity studies in the rat (13-week), histopathological findings included 
mineralisation at the corticomedullary junction and basophilic staining of cortical tubules. These findings 
were associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. In baboons, BUN was also 
increased following repeated oral administration of tacrolimus (13- week) and an interstitial 
inflammation with basophilic staining of the tubule was observed. In the cynomolgus monkey repeat 
intramuscular administration of tacrolimus (90 days) induced mesangelial cell proliferation and acute 
tubular necrosis which was associated with an increase in serum urea (Wijnen et al, 1992). The acute 
initial phase of tacrolimus-induced nephrotoxicity was suggested to be reversible and to consist of a 
reduction of the glomerular filtration rate and a reduction of the renal blood flow (constriction of the 
renal arteriole) caused by an increase in vasoconstrictor factors such as thromboxane and the activation 
of the renin-angiotensin system (Mitamura et al, 1994; Finn, 1999; Nakatani et al, 2003). Furthermore, 
evidence was provided that also reductions of vasodilator factors including nitric oxide contribute to 
tacrolimus induced glomerular vascular dysfunction (Wang et al, 2001).

Pancreas: Repeat administration of tacrolimus to experimental animals caused glucose intolerance and 
toxic changes in the pancreas consisting of cytoplasmic swelling, vacuolization, and apoptosis of ß-cells 
(Ohara et al., 1990; Ericszon et al, 1992; Hirano et al, 1992; Wijnen et al., 1992; Larsen et al., 2006, 
Hernandez-Fisac et al, 2007). These effects were demonstrated to be reversible following dose reduction 
or following a recovery period. Tacrolimus was shown to decrease insulin content, to impair insulin 
secretion and insulin transcription in pancreatic islets and ß-cell lines (Oetjen et al, 2003; Uchizono et al, 
2004; Radu et al, 2005; Hernandez-Fisac et al, 2007; Øzbay et al, 2011).  
Heart: Although no signs of cardiotoxicity were observed in previous repeat dose toxicity studies 
conducted in rats (13-week, orally, up to 3.2 mg/kg/day), dogs (2-week orally up to 1 mg/kg/day) and 
baboons (4-week, intravenously, up to 2 mg/kg/day and 13-week, orally, up to 36 mg/kg/day) (Ohara 
et al, 1990), cardiotoxic effects were found in rabbits following 4-week intravenous administration of 
tacrolimus at dose levels of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg/day (Nomoto et al, 1994). The findings consisted of 
a dose-dependent myocarditis and few cases of severe myocardial necrosis in the high and medium dose 
group. The myocardial lesions when mild were reversible following a recovery period of 28 days. 
Significant left ventricular dilatation was evident even in the low-dose group. The finding was similar in 
degree to the high dose group. Cardiomyopathy was also observed in the Cynomolgus monkey following 
repeated intramuscular administration of tacrolimus (Wijnen et al., 1992). 
Nervous System: Neurotoxic events were reported following repeat administration of tacrolimus to 
rats (Sakamoto et al, 2000). In Rhesus monkeys, repeat oral administration of tacrolimus (up to 25 
mg/kg/day) caused fine tremors beginning at 6 to 12 weeks of dosing without histopathological 
correlates (Kindt et al., 1999).  
Eyes: Cataracts developed in rats following repeat oral dosing of tacrolimus (Ohara et al, 1990). This 
has been attributed to an accumulation of sorbitol in the lens secondary to the diabetogenic effects of 
tacrolimus (Ishida et al., 1997).  
Lymphoid Organs: Due to the immunosuppressive action of tacrolimus atrophy of lymphoid tissues 
was observed in experimental animals following repeat administration (Ohara et al, 1990, Wijnen et al., 
1992). Over the past decade of clinical use with tacrolimus, clinical side effects have been associated 
with the kidney, pancreas/glycaemic control, eye and heart in treated patients and appear consistent 
with the findings of the repeat-dose studies (Plosker and Foster, 2000; Scott et al, 2003) 
Genotoxicity 
No mutagenic or clastogenic effect induced by tacrolimus was detected in a standard battery of 
genotoxicity testing including bacterial (Salmonella and E. coli) or mammalian (Chinese hamster 
lung-derived cells) in vitro assays of mutagenicity, the in vitro CHO/HGPRT assay of mutagenicity, and 
in vivo clastogenicity assays in mice. In addition, tacrolimus did not cause unscheduled DNA synthesis in 
rodent hepatocytes (Prograf Label, 2012). 
A published report showed that tacrolimus increased micronuclei in human lymphocyte cultures (Oliveira 
et al, 2004). However, the test was not fully performed according to OECD 487. Criteria, such as the 
number of cultures, the maximum concentrations, concentration-related increases or a reproducible 
increase in the number of cells containing micronuclei, or considerations whether the observed values 
are within or outside of the historical control range, were not provided or discussed. Therefore, the 
biological relevance of this result cannot be judged. In the light of the negative in vivo clastogenicity 
assays in mice it is concluded that tacrolimus has no clastogenic potential.

Carcinogenicity 
According to the data provided, no dose-response relationship of the tumour incidence was observed in 
an 80-week mouse study and a 104-week rat study. The doses tested were 4 to 10.8 times the clinical 
dose (0.075 to 0.2 mg/kg/day) when corrected for body surface area. 
However, in a 24-month dermal carcinogenicity study in mice an increased incidence of lymphoma which 
was associated with high systemic exposure was detected following daily application with 0.1% 
tacrolimus ointment (Protopic label, 2011). Tacrolimus also increased lymphomas in mouse herpes virus 
(RadLV+) mice providing evidence that viral carcinogenesis can play an important role in the neoplasms 
associated with immunosuppressive drugs (Mistrikova et al, 1999). 
A statistically significant reduction in time to skin tumour (squamous cell carcinomas) development and 
an increase in the number of tumours were observed in a photocarcinogenicity study in albino hairless 
mice which were chronically treated with tacrolimus ointment. It is unknown whether this was a local or 
systemic effect (Protopic label, 2011).  
Furthermore, tacrolimus induced a dose-dependent metastatic progression in a mouse model of renal 
cancer cell pulmonary metastasis (Maluccio et al, 2003). 
It has been well documented that long-term immunosuppression significantly increases the risk for the 
development of neoplasms in transplanted patients. Malignancies which have been particularly 
associated with the use of immunosuppressive drugs include lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disorders, 
Kaposi sarcoma and squamous cell carcinoma (Bugelski et al, 2010). The etiology of post-transplant 
malignancies likely involves impaired immune surveillance mechanisms and a depressed antiviral 
immune activity. In addition, direct tumourigenic effects were discussed in the literature (Hojo et al, 
1999; Maluccio et al, 2003; Datta et al, 2009; Suthanthiran et al, 2009). For example, calcineurin 
inhibitors including tacrolimus were demonstrated to enhance transforming growth factor- ß1 (TGF-ß1) 
expression, induce TGF-ß1 secretion by tumour cells and promoted tumour progression in T-cell, B-cell 
and NK-cell deficient SCID-beige mice. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Treatment with tacrolimus adversely affected male and female reproduction and caused embryo-foetal 
toxicity in rats and rabbits (Saegusa et al., 1992, Hisatomi et al, 1996). 
In the fertility study in rats a higher rate of pre-implantation loss, lower pup viability, increased number 
of undelivered pups and birth defects were observed in the high dose group at a dose level of 
3.2 mg/kg/day (Saegusa et al., 1992). In the embryo-foetal toxicity study in rats, foetal weight was 
reduced and there was a greater incidence of skeletal variations in the high dose group (3.2 mg/kg/day). 
In rabbits, abortion occurred at the intermediate dose (0.32 mg/kg/day) and the high dose 
(1.0 mg/kg/day) level. In a study on peri- and postnatal development in rats viability and growth of the 
offsprings from the high dose group was reduced and were related to the maternal toxicity of tacrolimus. 
Tacrolimus dose-dependently decreased sperm counts and motility in male mature rats, but did not 
affect serum testosterone levels following a daily subcutaneous dose of 1 or 3 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks 
(Hisatomi et al, 1996). There were no histopathological findings in the testis, seminal vesicle or prostate 
in any treated rats. Intraductal eosinophilic globules, probably degeneration of the sperm cells, were 
observed in the epididymis of the 3 mg/kg/day group. The effects on sperm counts and motility returned 
to the control levels after stopping of the drug. When the tacrolimus treated males were mated with drug 
naive females, no effects on copulation or fertility index were observed, but a decrease in the number of 
live foetuses associated with implantation loss was observed in the 3 mg/kg/day group which were 
attributed to the decrease of sperm counts and motility.

Limited data from organ transplant recipients showed no evidence of an increased risk of adverse 
reactions on the course and outcome of pregnancy under tacrolimus treatment compared with other 
immunosuppressive medicinal products. As discussed by McKay and Josephson, 2008, the impact of 
immunosuppressive exposure on the developing foetus is often measured by the presence of structural 
malformation at birth; however, calcineurin inhibitors may also exert other effects not apparent at birth. 
For example, calcineurin inhibitors were shown to inhibit elimination of self-reactive T-cells during 
thymic development leading to autoimmunity in animal models. Furthermore, the high level of 
calcineurin and FKBP12 in the foetal brain and the functional changes induced by stimulation with 
tacrolimus raises concerns about potential neurocognitive deficits. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Local Tolerance 
No local tolerance studies have been conducted with the applied tacrolimus formulation. These studies 
are not deemed necessary by the CHMP since the tacrolimus dose level/concentration in the 
gastrointestinal tract is not expected to exceed that obtained following administration of the clinical 
comparator Prograf. Furthermore, excipients of the tacrolimus prolonged-release tablets conform to the 
European Pharmacopoeia and are used at common dose levels. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for 
Human use [EMEA/CHMP/SWP4447/00], a justification for the absence of an environmental risk 
assessment (ERA) has been provided. The applicant stated that LCP-Tacro tablets will replace similar 
products already marketed in the European Union/European Economic Area. Thus, an increase of the 
environmental exposure is not expected with this medicinal product.   
The justification was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Tacrolimus is a well-known macrolide immuno-suppressant. Its pharmacology in the prevention and 
treatment of organ transplant rejection is well documented in the literature. Tacrolimus has been 
demonstrated to act via several mechanisms of actions with the central mechanism for its 
immunosuppressive action being the inhibition of the activated serine threonine phosphatase, 
calcineurin, in T-lymphocytes. No new pharmacodynamic, safety or drug interaction studies have been 
performed by the applicant in relation to this application. The absence of new studies is considered 
acceptable by the CHMP as the pharmacodynamics of tacrolimus have been extensively characterised 
within the literature and various models of organ transplantation as well as being clinically well 
established and used worldwide for more than a decade as an immunosuppressive agent. No new 
pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been submitted. Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
with tacrolimus are known and well documented in the reference product’s product information.  No new 
pre-clinical pharmacokinetic or drug interaction studies have been submitted in relation to LCP-Tacro. 
The applicant has submitted existing published literature in support of the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of LCP-Tacro.  
These data suggest that tacrolimus has the potential to prolong the QT interval. Despite the absence of 
these types of events in the LCP-Tacro clinical development program, this finding has been addressed in 
the product information as follows: “Tacrolimus may prolong the QT interval but at this time lacks 
CHMP assessment report 
Envarsus 
EMA/CHMP/81205/2014 
Page 20/118 
 
  
substantial evidence for causing Torsades de Pointes. Caution should be exercised in patients with 
diagnosed or suspected Congenital Long QT Syndrome”. 
No new repeat dose toxicity studies have been submitted in relation to LCP-Tacro. The toxicity of 
tacrolimus has been previously well characterised in relation to signs of general toxicity as well as the 
identification of the target organs of toxicity including the kidney, pancreas, eyes, nervous system and 
the heart as well as lymphoid organs. Due to the immunosuppressive action of tacrolimus atrophy of 
lymphoid tissues was observed in experimental animals following repeat administration. In line with 
these findings, the product information mentions the following: “The kidneys and the pancreas were the 
primary organs affected in toxicity studies performed in rats and baboons. In rats, tacrolimus caused 
toxic effects to the nervous system and the eyes. Reversible cardiotoxic effects were observed in rabbits 
following intravenous administration of tacrolimus”. 
The adverse effects of tacrolimus on reproduction and development in experimental animals are 
adequately addressed in the product information. 
Due to the developmental and reproductive toxicity of tacrolimus in experimental animals and the lack 
of sufficient epidemiological data, tacrolimus treatment in pregnant women is only recommended when 
the perceived benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus (as mentioned in the product information).  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical literature data provided by the Applicant was considered adequate to support this 
application for the Prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult kidney or liver allograft recipients and the 
treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal products 
in adult patients. 
Tacrolimus is a well-known macrolide immuno-suppressant. Its pharmacology in the prevention and 
treatment of organ transplant rejection is well documented in the literature. No new pharmacodynamic 
studies have been performed in relation to this application which is acceptable to the CHMP.  
The toxicity of tacrolimus both pre-clinical and clinical has previously been well characterised with the 
organs of toxicity identified and no new toxicity concerns are expected with LCP-Tacro. Animal data 
clearly indicate that systemic treatment with tacrolimus adversely affects male and female reproduction. 
With respect to reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, LCP-Tacro does not differ from the reference 
medicinal product and the proposed wordings in the product information are considered to adequately 
address these concerns. 
The justification for the absence of an environmental risk assessment is acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The Applicant has conducted four early pilot studies, two Phase 1 studies in adult healthy volunteers, 
three Phase 1 bioavailability studies in adult healthy volunteers with LCP-Tacro versus either Advagraf or 
Prograf, and four Phase 2 studies in adult kidney and liver transplant patients which have investigated 
the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus from LCP-Tacro tablets. 
The four early pilot studies were designed to test the inter-subject variability, relative bioavailability 
and/or pharmacokinetic profiles of different test formulations of LCP-Tacro 2 mg tablets versus the 
marketed clinical reference product, Prograf capsules (LCP-Tacro  PK-001, LCP-Tacro PK-002, and 
LCP-Tacro PK-004) or to evaluate the colon absorption of LCP-Tacro  2 mg tablets (LCP-Tacro  PK-003).

The first Phase 1 study, LCP-Tacro 1013, was designed to evaluate the dose linearity of tacrolimus 
pharmacokinetic parameters after administration of LCP-Tacro tablets at three dose levels (5 mg, 7 mg 
and 10 mg). The second Phase 1 study, LCP-Tacro 1014, investigated the effect of morning 
administration compared with evening administration of a single LCP-Tacro 2mg tablet on the 
pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus. 
The three Phase 1 bioavailability studies, were two-way crossover multiple dose studies designed either 
to compare the bioavailability of LCP-Tacro tablets with the marketed clinical reference product Prograf 
(LCP-Tacro 1012, LCP-Tacro 1016) or with Advagraf (LCP-Tacro 1017). 
The first two Phase 2 studies (LCP-Tacro 2011 and LCP-Tacro 2012) were designed to establish the 
comparative bioavailability of tacrolimus from LCP-Tacro tablets once daily (q.d.) compared with Prograf 
capsules twice daily (b.i.d.) in stable kidney and liver transplant patients, respectively. The studies were 
also designed to validate the dose conversion ratio for substituting LCP-Tacro for Prograf in Phase 3 
studies. Patients who completed the liver study (LCP-Tacro 2012) were eligible to enter a 1-year 
extension study, where they received LCP-Tacro for up to 1 year. 
The Applicant also conducted two, prospective, open-label, randomized, parallel group studies to 
determine the pharmacokinetics of LCP-Tacro in de novo kidney and liver transplant patients (LCP-Tacro 
2017 and LCP-Tacro 2018, respectively). Following completion of the pharmacokinetic assessments in 
study LCP-Tacro 2017 and 2018, patients in these studies continued to receive either LCP-Tacro or 
Prograf for up to 360 days for the evaluation of additional secondary efficacy and safety parameters 
respectively. 
In addition to the above, the Applicant has conducted a further nine Phase 1 studies (comparative 
bioavailability and bioequivalence studies) in healthy male and female volunteers. 
Seven comparative bioavailability/bioequivalence studies were conducted to investigate: one vs. two 
LCP-Tacro tablets dosing units (Study LCP-Tacro 1018); one to establish the relative bioavailability of 
differently sized low- and high-dose LCP-Tacro tablets (Study LCP-Tacro 1024); one to demonstrate 
bioequivalence between different formulations used in the clinical development programme of 
LCP-Tacro tablets, namely Formulations D, E, and F in comparison with the final formulation 
(Formulation G) (Studies LCP-Tacro 1019, LCP-Tacro 1020, LCP-Tacro 1021, LCP-Tacro 1022, and 
LCP-Tacro 1023). 
One food effect study was also conducted to determine the effect of food on the PK of tacrolimus after 
administration of LCP-Tacro tablets (Study LCP-Tacro 1011). 
The relative bioavailability of LCP-Tacro tablets has been compared to matched doses of the marketed 
immediate-release Prograf capsules in studies LCP-Tacro  1015 LCP-Tacro 1012,LCP-Tacro 1016 (both 
steady state studies) and the modified-release product Advagraf in study LCP-Tacro 1017). 
To support the application two pivotal phase III studies in stable and de novo kidney transplant patients 
(3001 & 3002) have also been submitted. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Overview of Biopharmaceutics 
The prolonged-release product LCP-Tacro has been developed to allow for once daily dosing using the 
MeltDose technology. MeltDose, as proposed by the applicant, is a validated drug-delivery technology 
platform aimed to enhance bioavailability of low water solubility drugs by obtaining a solid dispersion in 
a polymer matrix of polyglycols. The granules are suitable for direct compaction into tablets. The drug 
release is sustained by means of an erodible matrix containing hypromellose as release-controlling 
polymer. Hypromellose and magnesium stearate constitute the extra-granular phase in the tablet 
dosage form.  
Bioanalytical Methods 
A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay was developed and 
validated for quantification of tacrolimus in human whole blood. The same basic method was used 
throughout the studies. Evaluation of this LC-MS/MS assay was carried out by the construction of an 
eight-point calibration curve (excluding zero concentration) which was validated with the concentration 
range of 0.200 to 25.600ng/mL ± 10% for tacrolimus in human whole blood. The slope and intercept of 
the calibration curves were determined through weighted linear regression analysis (1/conc2.). Two 
calibration curves and duplicate quality control (QC) samples (at three or four concentration levels, 
depending on the study) were analysed along with each batch of the study samples. Peak area ratios 
CHMP assessment report 
Envarsus 
EMA/CHMP/81205/2014

were used to determine the concentration of the standards, QC samples, and the unknown study 
samples from the calibration curves. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) across most of the Phase 1 
and Phase 2 studies was 0.200ng/mL. 
For studies LCP-Tacro 1017, LCP-Tacro 1018, and LCP-Tacro 1019, additional information was provided 
in the corresponding study analytical reports on the solid phase extraction into an organic medium and 
(LCP-Tacro 1018 and LCP-Tacro 1019 only) subsequent evaporation and reconstitution of the mobile 
phase. Method sensitivity and selectivity were achieved by detecting distinct precursor to production 
mass transitions for tacrolimus (821.5 −>768.5) and the internal standard rapamycin (931.6−>864.7) 
at defined retention time under reversed phase chromatographic conditions. 
The bioanalytical method was validated for precision and accuracy, linearity of the calibration curves, 
absolute recovery, selectivity, dilution integrity, carry over and matrix effects in line with the EMA 
guideline on the validation of the bioanalytical method (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009). Other 
validation experiments included the determination of interference with over-the-counter (OTC) drugs 
(including but not limited to caffeine, ibuprofen, salicylic acid, acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, and 
nicotine) and oral contraceptives. No interfering peaks were observed with any of the tested analytes. 
Bioequivalence between LCP-Tacro Formulations C, D, F and Commercial Formulation G 
Bioequivalence between the LCP-Tacro tablet formulations used in clinical trials (Formulations C, D, E 
and F) and the commercial Formulation G was established via the individual clinical Phase 1 comparative 
PK and bioavailability/bioequivalence studies linking the respective formulations. Apart from Study 
LCP-Tacro 1018 (single-dose), the main objective was to demonstrate bioequivalence between the 
respective formulations at steady-state under multiple-dose fasting conditions. In Study LCP-Tacro 
1019, bioequivalence assessments were performed on two tablet strengths for Formulation E and of two 
different formulations (Formulations E and D). As Formulation E has never been further pursued in 
clinical trials, study 1019 is not further discussed here. 
Bioequivalence of Formulations C and D and Formulations D and F 
Study LCP-Tacro 1018 evaluated the bioavailability of tacrolimus from a single oral dose of two 
LCP-Tacro 0.5-mg tablets (Formulation D) vs. one LCP-Tacro 1.0-mg tablet (Formulation C). This was a 
Phase 1, randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-way crossover study in 24 normal, healthy male and 
female volunteers, aged 18-50 years, all Caucasian, under fasting conditions. 
Pharmacokinetics  
The following pharmacokinetic parameters for tacrolimus were calculated by standard 
non-compartmental methods: AUC0-24, AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, AUC% Extrap, Cmax, Tmax, t½, Kel, and 
CL/F. 
Results  
The peak and overall systemic exposures of tacrolimus were comparable between the two treatments 
with no statistical differences observed: geometric mean ratios (two LCP-Tacro 0.5-mg tablets/one 
LCP-Tacro 1.0-mg tablet) of AUC0-24, AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, and Cmax ranged from 99.00-107.27%. In 
addition, the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for comparison between dose strength for AUC0-24 and 
AUC0-t were within EMA-recommended 90- 111% acceptance ranges for bioequivalence 
(EMA/618604/2008 Rev. 8) and AUC0-inf was only just outside; 90% CIs for the comparison of Cmax 
were within the recommended 80-125% range. Therefore, two LCP-Tacro 0.5 mg tablets and one 
LCP-Tacro 1 mg tablet of Formulation C and D, respectively, exhibited similar bioavailability.

concentrations were achieved 8 hours following drug administration. There was moderate variability in 
the tacrolimus pharmacokinetic parameters, with %CV estimates ranging from approximately 33-45%. 
On average, tacrolimus concentrations at the end of the first dosing day (C24) were comparable 
between Formulations D and F.

Results 
On Day 1, the single dose pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus from LCP-Tacro Formulations F and G were 
comparable. For both formulations, maximum tacrolimus concentrations were achieved 8 hours 
following drug administration. There was moderate variability in the tacrolimus pharmacokinetic 
parameters, with %CV estimates ranging from approximately 29-37%. On average, tacrolimus 
concentrations at the end of the first dosing day (C24) were comparable between Formulations F and G.

Steady-state tacrolimus concentrations were observed for both treatment groups on Day 8 following 
comparison of concentrations on Days 7 and 8. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for tacrolimus on 
Day 8 are summarized in Table 13. The multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus on Day 8 was 
comparable between Formulations F and G. The median time to maximum blood concentrations of 
tacrolimus was slightly longer for Formulation F compared with Formulation G, although this was not 
statistically significant (8 hours vs. 7 hours; p=0.084). There was moderate variability in the tacrolimus 
pharmacokinetic parameters, with %CV estimates ranging from approximately 13-63%.

Bioequivalence between LCP Tacro low and high dose strengths (formulation F) 
In order to assess the relative bioavailability of low (1 mg) and high dose strength (4 mg) tablets of 
LCP-Tacro (Formulation F), Study LCP-Tacro 1024 was conducted. The results demonstrated that the 
differences in the low-dose and high-dose strength formulations do not affect the bioavailability of 
tacrolimus from LCP-Tacro: LCP-Tacro 4-mg tablet and 1-mg tablet formulations were bioequivalent. 
The 90% CI of the geometric mean Cmax ratio was within the 80-125% acceptance range. The 90% CI 
of the clinically relevant geometric mean AUCt ratio was within the more stringent 90-111% acceptance 
range recommended (EMA/618604/2008 Rev. 8).

Pharmacokinetics 
The following pharmacokinetic parameters for tacrolimus were calculated by standard non 
compartmental methods: 
Day 1: AUC0-24, Cmax, C24, and Tmax 
Days 5, 6, and 7: Cpd 
Day 8: AUCτ (τ=24), Cmax, Cmin, Cavg, Tmax, Cpd, % Fluctuation, % Swing, AUCτ/Cmin, Cmax/Cmin, 
and Accumulation Ratio (R). 
Results 
On Day 1, the single dose pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus from LCP-Tacro Formulation F dosed as one × 
4 mg tablet or as four × 1 mg tablets were comparable. For both doses of this formulation, maximum 
tacrolimus concentrations were achieved 8 hours following drug administration. There was moderate 
variability in the tacrolimus pharmacokinetic parameters, with %CV estimates ranging from 
approximately 27-40%. On average, tacrolimus concentrations at the end of the first dosing day (C24) 
were slightly higher for the four ×1 mg tablets compared to the one × 4 mg tablets. 
Table 19 
Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Tacrolimus on Day 1 (Study LCP-Tacro 1024) 
The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for tacrolimus on Day 8 are summarized below. The 
multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus on Day 8 was similar in terms of AUCs. However, at 
steady-state, Cmax was higher after dosing with one 4 mg tablet than after dosing with four 1 mg tablets 
and trough plasma concentrations were lower; consequently, the peak/trough ratio was also greater. 
Median Tmax on Day 8 was 6.02 hours for one 4 mg tablet (range: 1.00-12.02 hours) and 7.00 hours for 
the four 1 mg tablets (range: 1.00-16.02 hours), (p=0.108). There was moderate variability in the 
tacrolimus pharmacokinetic parameters, with %CV estimates ranging from approximately 11-57%.

Influence of food 
The PK of tacrolimus is known to be influenced by food; food effect has been demonstrated for Prograf 
and Advagraf and is documented in their respective product information. To evaluate food effect on the 
bioavailability of LCP-Tacro tablets (5 mg; Formulation B), the applicant conducted a randomised, 
open-label, three way cross-over, single-dose PK study (Study LCP-Tacro 1011). The objectives of this 
study were to determine and compare the rate and extent of absorption of tacrolimus from a test 
formulation of LCP-Tacro 5 mg Tablets versus the comparator Prograf 5 mg Capsules under fasting 
conditions and to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of LCP-Tacro 5 mg Tablets.

Study LCP-Tacro 1011 
This was a randomized, open-label, single-dose, three-way crossover study in 27 normal, healthy 
non-smoking male and female volunteers, aged 18-65 years, all Caucasian. There were three 6-day 
study periods (Period I: September 10, 2006, period II: September 20, 2006, period III: September 30, 
2006). 
As expected for prolonged-release product, LCP-Tacro 5-mg tablets produced very similar overall 
systemic exposure, but lower peak exposure of tacrolimus, with delayed Tmax relative to the 
immediate-release product Prograf. These results indicated that, under fasting conditions, LCP-Tacro 
tablets produced similar systemic exposure of tacrolimus to that of Prograf, although the 90% CIs for the 
comparison of AUC0-t were just outside the acceptance range of 90-111% for bioequivalence. The 
geometric mean Cmax ratio was 45.24% (90% CI: 40.34-50.75%). This was expected, as after the 
administration of the LCP-Tacro prolonged-release product, Cmax was ~55% lower than Cmax observed 
after Prograf (p<0.05) and Tmax was significantly delayed by over 3 hours (median value of 5 hours vs. 
1.3 hours). Due to the delayed absorption of LCP-Tacro tablets, ~25% lower mean AUC0-12 was 
observed from LCP-Tacro tablets than that of Prograf. There was no significant difference observed in 
t1/2 (p>0.05), both exhibited a terminal half-life of approximately 35 hours. 
Table 22 
 Relative bioavailability of LCP-Tacro  5 mg in Fed and Fasted states and 
LCP-Tacro 5-mg and Prograf 5mg in the fasted state. 
Food reduced the systemic exposure to tacrolimus by ~ 55% after the administration of the LCP-Tacro 
tablets. The food also decreased the peak plasma concentration of tacrolimus by ~22% (mean ratio: 
78.42%; 90% CIs: 40.34-50.75%) but no effect was seen on the time to reach Cmax (a median of 5 
hours under both fed and fasted conditions). The average terminal half-lives of tacrolimus from 
LCP-Tacro tablets under both fasted and fed conditions was also similar (p>0.05).

Dose proportionality and time dependency 
In order to investigate dose proportionality and chronopharmacokinetics of LCP-Tacro, the applicant 
conducted two clinical Phase 1 single-dose PK studies in healthy subjects (Studies LCP-Tacro 1013 
[Formulation C], LCP-Tacro 1014 [Formulation C]). In addition, a systematic review of PK studies on 
LCP-Tacro tablets in terms of dose proportionality was also provided.

There were 27 subjects dosed in Period I, 24 of whom completed the study. Two subjects were dismissed 
because of administrative reasons and 1 subject withdrew for personal reasons. Pharmacokinetic and 
statistical analyses were performed on 25 subjects—the 24 subjects who completed all 3 study periods 
and 1 subject (#002) for whom there was enough data for a meaningful analysis.

Comparative Pharmacokinetics versus the clinical comparator Prograf and 
the European reference medicinal product Advagraf in Healthy Subjects 
The relative bioavailability of LCP-Tacro tablets has been compared to matched doses of the authorised 
immediate-release Prograf capsules in studies LCP-Tacro  1015 [single dose Formulation C], LCP-Tacro 
1012 [Formulation B], LCP-Tacro 1016 [Formulation C](both steady state studies) and the 
modified-release reference product Advagraf in study LCP-Tacro 1017 [Formulation C]). 
Bioavailability of LCP-Tacro compared with Prograf after a single dose  
The single-dose study (LCP-Tacro 1015) demonstrated the prolonged-release pharmacokinetics of 
tacrolimus from the LCP-Tacro 1 mg tablets.  
Study LCP-Tacro 1015: A Two-Way Crossover, Open-Label, Single Dose, Fasting, Comparative 
Bioavailability Study of LCP-Tacro 1 mg Tablets Versus Prograf 1 mg Capsules in Normal, Healthy, 
Non-Smoking Male and Female Subjects. 
There were two 6-day study periods. Subjects were randomized to receive one of the following 
treatments on Day 1 of each study period in a crossover design. There was at least a 2-week washout 
period between study treatments. The peak and total systemic exposures of tacrolimus were compared 
after a single oral dose of LCP-Tacro 1 mg tablets (Treatment A, test formulation) versus Prograf 1 mg 
capsules (Treatment B, comparator treatment). 
Pharmacokinetics 
The following pharmacokinetic parameters for tacrolimus were calculated by standard 
non-compartmental methods: AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, AUC0-12, AUC0-24, Cmax, C12, C24, Tmax, Kel, t½, 
CL/F, and AUC0-24/C24. 
Results 
In this single-dose study, the geometric mean ratio (LCP-Tacro/Prograf) for Cmax was ~62% lower than 
the comparator treatment (i.e., Prograf) whereas the geometric mean ratio for C24 was found to be 
~165% higher for LCP-Tacro compared to Prograf. The statistical results also indicated that the 
geometric mean ratio (LCP-Tacro/Prograf) of AUC0-t was higher by ~88% for LCP-Tacro compared to

Prograf. As expected, the median Tmax of the prolonged release product was found to be significantly 
longer compared to that of the comparator treatment: 9.00 hours vs. 1.33 hours, respectively. 
The t 1/2 of the test formulation [mean ± SD: 26.39 ± 6.57 hours] was similar to the comparator [mean 
± SD: 28.61 ± 14.03 hours, p=0.2811] and were concurrent to those for marketed tacrolimus products. 
The elimination parameters and their descriptive statistics for all the subjects are listed separately. 
Furthermore, the significantly higher apparent clearance values (CL/F) in Prograf is evident due to lower 
AUC0-∞ values when compared to that from LCP-Tacro (p=0.0043).

vs. one Prograf 1 mg capsule b.i.d.) and LCP-Tacro 1016 (one LCP-Tacro 1 mg tablet q.d. vs. one Prograf 
0.5 mg capsule b.i.d.), subjects were dosed over 10 successive days.

Bioavailability Study of LCP-Tacro 2 mg Tablets (q.d.) Versus Prograf 1 mg Capsules (b.i.d.) in Normal, 
Healthy, Non-Smoking Male and Female Subjects. 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the bioavailability of tacrolimus from a 
test formulation of LCP-Tacro 2 mg Tablets taken once daily (q.d.) versus Prograf 1 mg Capsules taken 
twice daily (b.i.d.) under steady-state, fasting conditions. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Day 1: AUC0-12, AUC0-24 (Treatment A only), C12, C24, Cmax, and Tmax. 
Day 10: AUCτ (τ=24), AUC0-12, AUC12-24, C12, Cmax, Cmin, Cavg, Tmax, t½, Kel, % Fluctuation, % 
Swing, AUCτ/Cmin, Cmax/Cmin, AUC12-24/Cmin, AUC0-12/C12, and Accumulation Ratio (R). 
Results 
Upon administration of LCP-Tacro 2 mg Tablets (q.d.) and Prograf 1 mg Capsules (b.i.d.) for 10 
successive days, there were no significant differences observed in the morning pre-dose concentrations 
between Days 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, therefore steady state was maintained since Day 5. At steady state, 
the systemic exposure (AUC and Cmin) over the period of 24 hours of LCP-Tacro 2 mg Tablets (q.d.) was 
about 46% higher than that of Prograf 1 mg Capsules (b.i.d.). The higher AUC exposure of the test 
formulation could be partially explained by the lower exposure of 2nd dose of the reference treatment. 
As expected, the LCP-Tacro 2 mg Tablets (q.d.) had higher Cavg values and lower degree of fluctuation 
than that of the immediate-release Prograf 1 mg Capsules (b.i.d.). The time to peak concentration 
between the single and multiple doses of each individual formulation was similar for both treatments. 
Also there was no significant difference observed in elimination half-life between the 2 treatments at 
steady state. 
Overall, LCP-Tacro 2 mg Tablets were well tolerated as a multiple-dose of 2 mg, administered under 
fasting conditions, and no significant safety issues emerged.

successive days, there were no significant differences observed in the morning pre-dose concentrations 
between Days 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, therefore steady state was maintained since Day 5. At steady state, 
the systemic exposure (AUC and Cmin) over the period of 24 hours of LCP-Tacro 1 mg Tablets (q.d.) was 
~ 52% to 64% higher than that of Prograf 0.5 mg Capsules (b.i.d.). The higher AUC exposure of the test 
formulation could be partially explained by the lower exposure of the second dose of the comparator 
treatment. As expected, the LCP-Tacro 1 mg Tablets (q.d.) had higher Cavg values and lower degree of 
fluctuation than that of the immediate-release Prograf 0.5 mg Capsules (b.i.d.). The time to peak 
concentration between the single and multiple doses of each individual formulation was similar in both 
treatments. The elimination half-life of the test formulation was slightly longer (up to ~3 hrs) than that 
of the reference formulation at steady state conditions (36.89 ± 7.74 vs. 33.88 ± 7.51, 
p-value=0.0019). Overall, LCP-Tacro 1 mg Tablets (q.d.) were well tolerated as a multiple-dose of 1 mg,

Bioavailability Study of LCP-Tacro  2 mg Tablets (q.d.) Versus Advagraf 2 x 1 mg Capsules (q.d.) in 
Normal, Healthy, Non-Smoking Caucasian Male Subjects. 
This study investigated the comparative PK with dosing of one LCP-Tacro 2-mg tablet q.d. (Formulation 
C) compared with two Advagraf 1 mg capsules q.d. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Day 1: AUC0-24, Cmax, C24, and Tmax. 
Day 10: AUCτ (τ=24), Cmax, Cmin, Cavg, Tmax, t½, Kel, % Fluctuation, % Swing, AUCτ/Cmin, 
Cmax/Cmin and Accumulation Ratio (R). 
Results 
Upon administration of one LCP-Tacro 2 mg Tablet (q.d.) and two Advagraf 1 mg Capsules (q.d.) for 10 
successive days, there were no significant differences observed in the predose concentrations between 
Days 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, therefore steady-state was maintained since Day 5. At steady-state, the 
systemic exposure (AUC and Cmin) over the period of 24 hours of 1 LCP-Tacro 2 mg Tablet (q.d.) was 
~49% and ~66% higher than that of 2 Advagraf 1 mg Capsules (q.d.). Of particular interest is that the 
1 LCP-Tacro 2 mg Tablet (q.d.) had higher Cavg values and a lower degree of fluctuation and swing than 
the 2 Advagraf 1 mg Capsules (q.d.). The time to peak concentration was longer for the test treatment, 
indicating the extended release product characteristics of the LCP-Tacro 2 mg Tablets. The elimination 
half-life of the test formulation was similar to that of the reference formulation at steady-state 
conditions. Overall, 1 LCP-Tacro 2 mg Tablet (q.d.) was well tolerated as a multiple-dose of 2 mg daily, 
administered under fasting conditions, and no significant safety issues emerged. 
From the initial Day-1 dosing AUC and Cmin were significantly greater (p< 0.0001). At steady-state, the 
systemic exposure (AUC and Cmin) over the period of 24 hours of one LCP-Tacro 2 mg tablet (q.d.) was 
~49% and ~66% higher than that of two Advagraf 1 mg capsules (q.d.).

Confirming the higher systemic exposure of LCP-Tacro, the Cavg of LCP-Tacro 2-mg tablets (q.d.) (5.93 
± 2.06) was ~50% higher than that of the Advagraf 1 mg capsules (q.d.) (3.92 ± 1.18); this difference 
was statistically significant (p<0.05). Cmax (mean ± SD) were 8.39 ± 2.89 and 7.00 ± 2.04 for 
LCP-Tacro and Advagraf, respectively (p<0.05). 
The degree of fluctuation (64.7% ± 23.0) and degree of swing (85.5% ± 37.6) of LCP-Tacro were 
significantly lower than Advagraf (110.2% ± 28.2 and 158.5% ± 48.2, respectively) (p<0.05). A 
comparison of Tmax between treatments on Days 1 and 10 revealed that the time to peak concentration 
was much longer for LCP-Tacro compared to Advagraf. No significant difference was observed in Tmax 
between single and multiple doses of the same treatment (p>0.05). 
Phase 2 Clinical Studies in Kidney Transplant Patients 
Conversion setting 
The proposed ratio for converting patients from their current maintenance dose of Prograf capsules twice 
daily to the corresponding dose of LCP-Tacro tablets once daily is based on the results of LCP-Tacro 
Study 2011. 
LCP-Tacro Study 2011 was a Phase II, 3-sequence, open-label, multicenter, prospective study in stable 
kidney transplant patients to assess and compare the PK (AUC, Cmax and Cmin) and safety of LCP-Tacro 
tablets once daily versus Prograf capsules twice daily. A 24-hour PK profile was obtained in patients 
taking Prograf capsules twice daily under steady state conditions and then repeated under steady state 
conditions after conversion to LCP-Tacro tablets once daily at a fixed dose approximately 30% less than 
the total daily dose of Prograf. 
Methodology 
Stable kidney transplant patients who fulfilled all inclusion/exclusion (I/E) criteria were enrolled and 
kept on Prograf for 7 days. Following a 24-hour PK study on Day 7 to determine pharmacokinetics for 
Prograf, all patients were converted to once daily LCP-Tacro (Ratio 1:0.66-0.80) for 7 days with no dose 
changes allowed. On Day 14 a 24-hour LCP-Tacro PK study was performed. On Day 15 one predefined 
dose change was allowed if there was more than 25% change in the mean of 3 trough levels measured 
on Days 10 ± 1, 12 ± 1 (separated by at least 48 hours from the previous sample) and 14 compared to 
the mean of 3 trough levels measured on Days 0, 7 and 8 for each individual patient. Patients remained 
on the dose determined on Day 14 for another 7 days with no dose changes allowed. Another 24-hour 
LCP-Tacro PK study was performed on Day 21. On Day 22 patients were converted back to their original 
twice-daily dose of Prograf for a safety follow-up period of 30 days ending with a safety assessment at 
Day 52. 
The following blood samples were drawn during this study: 
For LCP-Tacro: Blood sampling points included: 0.00 (pre-dose), 0.50, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00, 3.00, 4.00, 
6.00, 8.00, 12.00, 14.00, 16.00, 20.00 and 24.00 hours post dose, on Days 14 and 21. For Prograf:

Blood sampling points included: 0.00 (pre-dose), 0.50, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00, 3.00, 4.00, 6.00, 8.00, 12.00, 
12.50, 13.00, 13.50, 14.00, 15.00, 16.00, 20.00 and 24.00 hours after the morning dose, on Day 7. 
Pharmacokinetic Variables 
The following pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for tacrolimus as available within both test 
and  reference  products  and  determined  using  SAS  software:    AUCτ;  Cmax;  Tmax;  Cmin;  Cave;  % 
fluctuation; % swing; Cmax/Cmin. 
Results 
The average (± SD) of the dose conversion ratios used for converting the 47 patients in the per-protocol 
(PP) set from Prograf to LCP-Tacro was 0.71 ± 0.05 (median 0.70, range 0.67 to 0.80). Based on the 
results obtained, there was no significant difference between the AUC or the C min obtained for Prograf 
versus LCP-Tacro after 1 week of dosing. 
Table 30

Transplant Patients (Study LCP-Tacro 2011) 
Mean tacrolimus whole blood-concentration time profiles over 24 hours on Day 7 showed a characteristic 
fluctuation in tacrolimus concentration (approximately 6-16 ng/mL) with Prograf. In comparison, a 
smaller fluctuation in mean tacrolimus concentrations (approximately 7-12 ng/mL) was observed with 
LCP-Tacro on Day 14 and Day 21 (see Figure 2).

The Phase 2 randomized, open-label Study LCP-Tacro 2017 in 63 adult de novo kidney transplant 
patients evaluated the PK and safety of tacrolimus from LCP-Tacro tablets and Prograf capsules during 
the first 2 weeks after kidney transplantation. The study then compared the efficacy and safety of 
LCP-Tacro tablets and Prograf capsules over a further 50 weeks after kidney transplantation. 
LCP-Tacro 2017: A Phase 2, Open-Label, Multi-Center, Randomized Trial to Demonstrate the

Kidney Transplant Patients. 
This was a Phase II Open-Label, Multi-Center, Randomized Trial to Demonstrate the Pharmacokinetics of 
LCP-Tacro Tablets Once Daily and Prograf Capsules Twice Daily in Adult de novo Kidney transplant adult 
patients (18 – 65 yrs).  The study was conducted in 9 sites in US. Three 24-hour whole blood 
concentration-time profiles were taken during the study: one following the first administration of 
tacrolimus, and two under steady state conditions at Day 7 and Day14. The primary endpoint was the 
systemic exposure AUC0-24; Cmin of tacrolimus on Day 1, Day 7 & Day 14.  
The mean daily dose of LCP-Tacro (n=32) decreased from 10.29 (3.32) mg on Days 1-7 to 10.27 (4.183) 
mg on Days 8-14, and mean total daily doses of Prograf (n=31) decreased from 10.88 (3.417) mg on 
Days 1-7 to 8.47 (4.208) mg on Days 8-14. Through blood levels in the early transplant period were 
higher for Prograf-treated patients than LCP-Tacro-treated patients; however, by Day 7 they were 
comparable and then lower at day 14. 
A summary of the results from the pharmacokinetic assessments performed on Days 1, 7 and 14 is

Phase 2 Clinical Studies in Liver Transplant Patients 
LCP-Tacro 2012: A Phase 2, Open-Label, Multi-center Prospective, Conversion Study in Stable Liver 
Transplant Patients to Compare the Pharmacokinetics of LCP-Tacro Tablets Once-A-Day to Prograf 
Capsules Twice-A-Day. 
The primary objective was: 
To evaluate steady state tacrolimus exposure (AUC0-24) and trough levels (C24) in stable liver 
transplant patients converted from Prograf capsules to LCP-Tacro tablets using a three-sequence study 
design. 
Study Design 
This Phase 2, open-label, multi-center, prospective, conversion study enrolled 59 stable liver transplant 
patients (liver transplant at least 6 months before enrollment and serum creatinine <2.5 mg/dL) on oral 
Prograf therapy as part of their maintenance immunosuppression regimen. All patients were on a stable 
Prograf dose with trough levels of tacrolimus maintained at 5-12 ng/mL for at least 4 weeks before 
enrollment. The study population comprised 33 male and 26 female patients (aged 20-66 years; 46 
Caucasian, 8 Black; 2 Asian, 1 Mixed Race, 1 Native Hawaiian, 1 Native American). 
The three sequence study design was essentially identical to that for Study-LCP-Tacro 2011 in stable 
kidney transplant patients with the same dose conversion ratio (0.66-0.80) used to convert patients 
from Prograf (b.i.d.) to LCP-Tacro (q.d.). The only slight difference was that trough levels of tacrolimus 
were to be maintained at 5-12 ng/mL during Study Period 1.  
Pharmacokinetic Results 
Mean tacrolimus whole blood concentration time profiles over 24 hours show a characteristic fluctuation 
in tacrolimus concentration (approximately 6-16 ng/mL) with Prograf on Day 7. In comparison, a smaller 
fluctuation in mean tacrolimus concentrations (approximately 7-12 ng/mL) was observed with 
LCP-Tacro on Day 14 and Day 21.  
The pharmacokinetic data for tacrolimus are summarized in Table 34.

Study Design 
Study LCP-Tacro 2012E (extension study) was an extension of Study LCP-Tacro 2012 (core study) in 
liver transplant patients. Patients who successfully completed the core study (N=57) were eligible to 
enter the extension study and were maintained on LCP-Tacro for an additional 50 weeks (a total of 52 
weeks on LCP-Tacro). Eligible patients were enrolled in the extension study on the morning of Day 22 at 
the end of the core study. 
Tacrolimus whole blood trough levels were to be maintained between approximately 5 and 15 ng/mL 
according to the standard of care at each center. The number of “weeks” in this study refers to the total 
number of weeks that patients had been on LCP-Tacro tablets and included the 2 weeks that patients 
received the study drug in the core study. Patients were instructed to take study drug in the morning. 
Since tacrolimus absorption is affected by food, patients were instructed to take LCP-Tacro either 1 hour 
before or at least 2 hours after meals. Patients who routinely took their study medication with meals 
prior to and during the core study were allowed to continue to do so during the extension study. 
Results 
Forty-nine (49) patients received at least 1 dose of study medication and 43/49 (87.8%) patients 
completed the extension study. A total of 6/49 (12.2%) patients withdrew early. The most common 
reason for early withdrawal was an AE (3/49 [6.1%] patients, elevated creatinine, headache, and 
metastatic carcinoma). Three other patients withdrew for the following reasons: administrative/other 
reason (moved out of state), non-compliance with protocol, and withdrawal of consent.

The primary objectives were to demonstrate the pharmacokinetics (AUC and Cmax) and 24-hour trough 
levels (Cmin) of LCP-Tacro early after transplantation (within the first 14 days) in adult de novo liver 
transplant recipients and to compare the proportion of patients in each treatment group achieving 
sufficient tacrolimus whole blood trough levels (5 to 20 ng/mL) during the first 14 days 
post-transplantation. 
The secondary objectives were to compare the pharmacokinetics (AUC, Cmax and Cmin) on Days 1, 7 
and 14 of LCP-Tacro with the pharmacokinetics of Prograf and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
LCP-Tacro compared to Prograf in the first 12 months after liver transplantation 
Tacrolimus pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using non-compartmental methods as follows: 
area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-24), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), 
average plasma concentration (Cave) , plasma concentration 24 hours post dose (Cmin), time of 
maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), % Fluctuation, % Swing and Accumulation Ratio.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics  
The key pharmacodynamic action of tacrolimus is inhibition of cytokine gene transcription. It enters 
T-lymphocytes by non-specific mechanisms, and binds to a 12 kDa cis-trans rotamase, termed FK506 
binding protein (FKBP12), in the cytoplasm. The tacrolimus-FKBP12 complex binds to the phosphatase 
calcineurin, and thereby inhibits the dephosphorylation of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (N-FAT) 
preventing translocation of N-FAT into the nucleus of the T-lymphocyte. The inhibition of signal 
transduction pathways prevents transcription of a set of lymphokine genes, in particular those encoding 
interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, 
tumour necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ and the gene encoding the IL-2 receptor. Tacrolimus suppresses 
T-cell activation, and the subsequent generation of cytotoxic lymphocytes, thereby down-regulating 
processes leading to acute graft rejection. T-helper cell dependent B-cell proliferation is also affected. 
Tacrolimus is a well-defined macrolide immuno-suppressant, its pharmacology in the prevention and 
treatment of organ transplant rejection is well documented in the literature. No new pharmacodynamic 
studies have been performed in relation to this application. The pharmacodynamics of tacrolimus have 
been extensively characterised within the literature and various models of organ transplantation as well

as being clinically well defined and used worldwide for more than a decade as an immunosuppressive 
agent. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Tacrolimus has been in clinical use for almost two decades and the general PK in transplant recipients 
and healthy subjects is well defined. No further specific studies on the ADME characteristics or PK in 
special populations of tacrolimus have been conducted by the applicant. This applies also to PD and drug 
interactions, both of which are well characterized and are reflected in the Prograf EU SmPC, 2012 and 
Advagraf EU SmPC, 2013. This was agreed by the CHMP. 
The PK profile of LCP-Tacro tablets has been comprehensively investigated. Dose proportionality was 
demonstrated for LCP-Tacro tablets across the therapeutically relevant dose range (Study LCP-Tacro 
1013) and is consistent with the dose proportional PK reported for tacrolimus following oral 
administration of Prograf and Advagraf in the dose range of 1.5 to 10 mg. 
No significant difference in the tacrolimus PK following single-dose LCP-Tacro tablet administration was 
observed when given in the morning or in the evening, indicating an absence of a 
chronopharmacokinetic effect (Study LCP-Tacro 1014). Consistent throughout the Phase 1 studies 
conducted by the applicant, LCP-Tacro tablets (q.d.) have been demonstrated to provide greater 
bioavailability of tacrolimus compared with an equivalent dose of Prograf capsules (b.i.d.) or Advagraf 
(q.d.). In addition, Cmax and the Cmax/Cmin ratio were both significantly lower for LCP-Tacro compared 
with Prograf. A prolonged Tmax was observed for LCP-Tacro tablets compared with matched doses of 
Prograf or Advagraf. At steady state, systemic exposure to tacrolimus was approximately 46% higher 
following administration of LCP-Tacro tablets (q.d.) compared with matched doses of Prograf capsules 
(b.i.d.). 
Available data on Prograf and Advagraf indicate that AUC and Cmin are predictive in terms of safety and 
efficacy, whereas Cmax is not. Higher Cavg (~50%), reduced peak trough fluctuation (Cmax/Cmin) and 
a longer Tmax were seen for the prolonged-release test product compared with both Prograf and 
Advagraf. In Study LCP-Tacro 1012, it was observed that the inter-subject variability in Cmin and Cavg 
of the LCP-Tacro tablet was ~12- 14% lower compared to Prograf.  
The within method QC samples and their analysis for the bioanalytical validation of all of the Phase I, II 
and III studies in line with the guideline on bioanalytical method validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009) have been provided during the procedure and are within the limits 
established. The analytical standard curves, precision of standards for tacrolimus (CV%), accuracy of 
standards for tacrolimus (% Nom conc) for LLOQ, LQC, MQC, HQC and Repeat Analysis have been 
provided and are deemed acceptable.  
Allograft transplant patients maintained on twice daily Prograf (immediate-release) or once daily 
Advagraf (prolonged release) dosing requiring conversion to once daily Envarsus should be converted on 
a 1:0.7 (mg:mg) total daily dose basis, i.e. the Envarsus maintenance dose should be 30% less than the 
Prograf or Advagraf dose. In stable patients converted from tacrolimus immediate-release products 
(twice daily) to Envarsus (once daily) on a 1:0.7 (mg:mg) total daily dose basis, the mean systemic 
exposure to tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was similar to that of immediate-release tacrolimus. The relationship 
between tacrolimus trough levels (C24) and systemic exposure (AUC0-24) for Envarsus is similar to that 
of immediate-release tacrolimus. No studies have been conducted with conversion of patients from 
Advagraf to Envarsus; however, data from healthy volunteers would suggest that the same conversion 
rate is applicable as with the conversion from Prograf to Envarsus. When converting from tacrolimus 
immediate-release products (e.g. Prograf capsules) or from Advagraf prolonged-release capsules to 
Envarsus, trough levels should be measured prior to conversion and within two weeks after conversion. 
Dose adjustments should be made to ensure that similar systemic exposure is maintained after the 
CHMP assessment report

switch. The CHMP noted that black patients may require a higher dose to achieve the targeted trough 
levels (as reflected in the product information). 
The oral bioavailability of Envarsus was decreased when the product was administered after a meal. The 
extent of absorption was decreased by 55% and the maximum plasma concentration was decreased by 
22% when taken directly after a high-fat meal. Therefore, Envarsus should generally be taken on an 
empty stomach to achieve maximal absorption as mentioned in the product information. 
Study LCP-Tacro 2017 in de novo kidney transplant recipients showed that higher Cmax/Cmin and AUC 
profile is recorded with LCP-Tacro compared to Prograf. The results of study 2017 have therefore been 
used by the applicant to further support the proposed posology for LCP-Tacro. This study 2017 also 
reported that no patients experienced graft failure and no patients died during the study.  Three patients 
experienced BPAR: one in the LCP-Tacro group and two in the Prograf group. For the mITT analysis set 
(n=63), there was no statistically significant difference in Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative 
incidence freedom from BPAR between the LCP-Tacro and Prograf groups (96.8% vs. 93.3%: p=0.65); 
findings were essentially identical on Day 180 and Day 365.  
In study 2017 supporting the PK of LCP-Tacro in de novo kidney transplant patients, the absolute doses 
of LCP-Tacro and Prograf administered seem to be equivalent. The mean daily dose on day 1 to 7 for 
LCP-Tacro was 10.29 mg (3.32), and the dose for Prograf was 10.88 mg (3.417). During the procedure, 
the applicant clarified the respective average daily tacrolimus doses normalized by patient weight during 
the first 14 days of study LCP-Tacro 2017 (Days 1-7; Days 8-14) as well as for the remainder of the 
study. The average daily doses normalized by patient weight showed that the mean (SD) daily dose of 
LCP-Tacro tablets in the mITT population decreased progressively from 0.12 (0.04) mg/kg on Days 1-7 
to 0.07 (0.05) mg/kg on Days 181-360. The mean (SD) daily dose of Prograf decreased progressively 
from 0.13 (0.04) mg/kg on Days 1-7 to 0.08 (0.06) mg/kg on Days 181-360.  PK results obtained from 
study 2017 indicated that LCP-Tacro dose regimens are improved by utilising a slightly higher Day-1 
dose in the de novo setting. This has been consequently confirmed in phase III study 3002 using an 
LCP-starting dose of 0.17 mg/kg/day given as a single morning dose, followed by dosing according to the 
desired tacrolimus trough levels. This is acceptable to the CHMP since relative bioavailability studies with 
LCP-Tacro show higher plasma concentrations. In addition, results from study LCP-Tacro 2017 showed 
that a Day 1 dose of 0.14 mg/kg/day results in lower tacrolimus exposure as well as that a limited subset 
of patients tolerated well a Day 1 dose of 0.17 mg/kg/day. The results submitted clarified that the 
apparently equal mean doses for the two treatments in study 2017 are caused by differences in weight. 
Furthermore it has been clarified by the applicant that the dose for LCP-Tacro is not increased rapidly, 
but conversely decreased according to the desired tacrolimus trough levels. The dose corrected data 
indicated that by Day 14, LCP-Tacro therapy shows similar systemic exposure, peak systemic exposure 
and trough tacrolimus levels when compared to Prograf in adult de novo liver transplant recipients 
during the first 14 days post-transplantation. 
The applicant proposed to use the highest dose of each dose range used in Study 2018, resulting in a 
starting dose recommendation of 0.11 to 0.13 mg/kg/d for de novo liver allograft recipients, based on 
the observed data (i.e., 30% lower Cmin values for Envarsus on day 1 compared to Prograf). This has 
been agreed by the CHMP and is in line with reference product. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of tacrolimus has been investigated extensively in the past, is well known and 
has been the subject of many publications.  
The clinical development strategy was based on clinical pharmacokinetic studies evaluating the 
comparative pharmacokinetics of the European reference medicinal product Advagraf and LCP-Tacro as 
well as the clinical comparator Prograf and LCP-Tacro. This strategy is agreed by the CHMP. 
CHMP assessment report 
Envarsus 
EMA/CHMP/81205/2014 
Page 53/118 
 
  
Overall the CHMP concluded that higher Cavg (~50%), reduced peak trough fluctuation (Cmax/Cmin) and 
a longer Tmax were seen for Envarsus when compared with both, tacrolimus immediate-release 
formulation (Prograf) and a tacrolimus once daily formulation (Advagraf). Mean values for Cmax, 
percentage degree of fluctuation and percentage degree of swing were significantly lower with 
administration of Envarsus tablets. 
A strong correlation exists between AUC and whole blood trough levels at steady-state for Envarsus. 
Monitoring of whole blood trough levels therefore provides a good estimate of systemic exposure. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
As tacrolimus efficacy is known to correlate with trough concentrations obtained during therapeutic drug 
monitoring, separate dose-response studies were not conducted. This was agreed by the CHMP. 
The doses of LCP-Tacro used in the three completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 efficacy studies in kidney 
transplant patients (Study LCP-Tacro 2017, Studies LCP-Tacro 3001 and 3002) were primarily based on 
the findings of the Phase 2 PK Study LCP-Tacro 2011 and was also determined by Prograf dosing 
approved at the time the studies were conducted. Reflecting clinical practice at that time, in all 
completed clinical Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies on LCP-Tacro, dose adjustments of study drug were 
permitted to maintain tacrolimus whole blood levels within predefined ranges (4-15 ng/mL) as 
therapeutically recommended at the time of the respective study protocol generation.

LCP-Tacro  3001:  A Phase 3, Open-label, Multicenter, Prospective, Randomized Study of the Efficacy 
and Safety of Conversion From Prograf Capsules Twice Daily to LCP-Tacro Tablets Once Daily for the 
Prevention of Acute Allograft Rejection in Stable Kidney Transplant Patients 
Methods 
Study LCP-3001 was a Phase 3, open label, multicenter, prospective, randomized, two-arm parallel 
group study in stable kidney transplant patients. Following a 7-day run-in period during which patients 
continued on their current dose of Prograf capsules (b.i.d.), patients were randomized 1:1 to receive a 
reduced dose of LCP-Tacro tablets (q.d.) or to continue on Prograf capsules (b.i.d.) for 12 months.

Study Participants  
The study population comprised 326 adult (≥18 years) stable kidney transplant patients (renal 
transplant 3 months to 5 years before enrollment) on oral Prograf capsules (b.i.d.), at a total daily dose 
of ≥2 mg/day, as part of their maintenance immunosuppression regimen.  
Inclusion criteria were: 
1. Men and women at least 18 years of age who are recipients of a kidney transplant between 3 months 
and 5 years before the screening date. 
2. Patients taking oral Prograf capsules twice daily, at least 2 mg total dose per day, as part of their 
maintenance immunosuppression therapy, with tacrolimus trough levels of 5 to 15 ng/mL. Patients must 
maintain tacrolimus trough levels in this range during the 7-day Run-in Period to be eligible for 
randomization (based on two consecutive trough level measurements at least 48 hours apart). 
3. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days 
before receiving study drug. 
Exclusion Criteria included: 
1. Recipients of any transplanted organ other than kidney 
2. Recipients of a bone marrow transplant 
3. Patients with an eGFR (MDRD7) < 30 mL/min at Screening 
4. Patients with a spot protein: creatinine ratio > 0.5 
5. Patients with a WBC count < 2.8 x 109/L unless the WBC count has been stable for at least 2 weeks 
and the absolute neutrophil count is > 1.0 x 109 /L 
6. Patients unable to swallow study medication 
7. Patients incapable of understanding the purposes and risks of the study, who cannot give written 
informed consent and who are unwilling or unable to comply with the study protocol requirements 
8. Pregnant or nursing women 
9. Patients with reproductive potential who are unwilling/unable to use a double-barrier method of 
contraception 
Treatments 
Patients on a stable dose of oral Prograf of at least 2 mg per day were randomly assigned to be converted 
from Prograf twice daily to oral LCP-Tacro once daily or to remain on maintenance therapy with oral 
Prograf twice daily. For patients randomly assigned to LCP-Tacro, initial dosing was 0.7 times the total 
daily dose of Prograf being taken by the patient just before conversion. Because of decreased 
bioavailability of LCP-Tacro, black patients were converted using a 0.85 conversion multiplier. All 
subsequent study drug dose adjustments were based on clinical assessment of the patient and 
maintenance of target tacrolimus whole blood trough levels within the predefined therapeutic range of 4 
to 15 ng/mL. The duration of treatment was 360 days. 
Reference Product 
Only patients taking a stable total daily dose of at least 2 mg of Prograf were eligible for entry into the 
study. During the study, fractional total daily doses were only permitted for patients taking less than 5 
mg per day (fractional total daily doses of 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 mg per day).  
Prograf was to be administrated twice daily in 2 equally divided doses (or as close to equally divided as 
feasible), once in the morning and once in the evening, with an interval of 12 hours (±1 hour) between 
CHMP assessment report 
Envarsus

the morning and evening doses. After initial dosing, patients taking Prograf had their dose adjusted to 
maintain tacrolimus whole blood trough levels within the predefined therapeutic range of 4 to 15 ng/mL 
for the duration of the study. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate, the efficacy and safety of LCP-Tacro tablets administered once 
daily when used to replace Prograf capsules administered twice daily for maintenance 
immunosuppression for prevention of acute allograft rejection in adult renal transplant patients. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
A composite primary endpoint for non-inferiority was used for efficacy failure at 12 months after the first 
dose of study drug and included any patient experiencing any of the following within 12 months (by Day 
360) after random assignment to treatment: death, graft failure (return to dialysis for >30 days, 
allograft nephrectomy, or retransplantation), biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) (Banff grade ≥1A), 
or loss to follow-up. The primary efficacy endpoint analysis was performed using the modified 
intent-to-treat (mITT) set. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were based on the mITT set, except where specified, as follows: 
- Incidence of efficacy failure (i.e., defined as any patient experiencing death, graft failure, BPAR, or lost 
to follow-up) in the mITT and in the PP populations within 6 months after first dose of study drug 
- Incidence of efficacy failure in the PP set within 12 months after first dose of study drug  
- Incidences of death or graft failure within 6 months and 12 months after first dose of study drug 
- Incidences of BPAR (Banff grade ≥1A) within 6 months and 12 months after first dose of study drug 
- Incidences of steroid-resistant acute rejection (as assessed by the need for antibody therapy for the 
treatment of acute rejection after a course of corticosteroids) within 6 months and 12 months after first 
dose of study drug 
- Proportion of severity grades of the first episode of BPAR (by Banff grade) occurring within 6 months 
and 12 months after first dose of study drug 
Sample size 
A total of 409 patients were enrolled into the study, 83 of these patients were not randomly assigned to 
study treatment. Overall, 326 patients were randomly assigned to the study, 163 patients in each 
treatment group, and 296 patients completed the 12-month treatment period, 142 patients in the 
LCP-Tacro group and 154 patients in the Prograf group. One patient in each treatment group was 
randomly assigned and not dosed; thus, a total of 324 patients (99.4%) were included in the (mITT) set, 
162 (99.4%) in each treatment group. Thirty patients (9.2%) discontinued from the study; of these, 
more patients in the LCP-Tacro treatment group (21 patients [12.9%]) discontinued from the study than 
in the Prograf treatment group (9 patients [5.5%]). Reasons for study discontinuation in the LCP-Tacro 
treatment group were AE (10 patients), voluntary discontinuation (7 patients), death (2 patients), and 
physician decision (2 patients). Reasons for study discontinuation in the Prograf treatment group were 
AE (3 patients), voluntary discontinuation (3 patients), protocol violations (2 patients) and lost to 
follow-up (1 patient). 
Randomisation 
Randomization was performed using a fixed-block randomization scheme. The randomization scheme 
was generated and reviewed by the study biostatistician and quality assurance staff and locked by them 
after approval. The investigational sites randomly assigned qualified patients through an IVRS. The IVRS 
CHMP assessment report

was contacted for randomization assignment once a patient satisfied the requirements for tacrolimus 
whole blood trough levels and pregnancy testing during the Run-in Period. The sites were to record the 
time of randomization. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
There were 5 data sets for analysis: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The Enrolled Set included all patients who have signed the informed consent. 
The Randomized Set included all enrolled patients who have passed the run-in period and are 
subsequently randomized. 
The mITT Set included all randomized patients who receive at least one dose of either study drug 
(LCP-Tacro or Prograf). Patient who were randomized and took any incorrect treatment for the 
entire study were reported under their randomized treatment group for the mITT Set. 
The Safety Set included all randomized patients who receive at least one dose of either study 
drug (LCP-Tacro or Prograf). Patient who were randomized and took any incorrect treatment for 
the entire study were reported under the treatment they actually received for the Safety Set. 
The PP Set included all mITT patients who completed the study without any major protocol 
deviations. Unless otherwise specified, the PP Set was determined using the major deviations 
occurring within 12 months after the first dose of study drug. Major protocol deviations were 
reviewed on a case-by-case to determine eligibility for the per protocol analysis set before the 
database freeze. 
The primary efficacy analysis was conducted at the 2-sided 0.05 significance level. All other analyses 
such as confidence intervals, statistical tests, and resulting p-values were reported as 2-sided and 
assessed and reported at the 0.05 significance level. No Type 1 error rate adjustments for multiple 
comparisons were made. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis 
A composite primary endpoint for non-inferiority was used to define efficacy failure in the mITT 
population and included any patient experiencing any of the following within 12 months after receiving 
the first dose of either study drug: death, graft failure (return to dialysis for >30 days, allograft 
nephrectomy, or retransplantation), BPAR (Banff grade >1A), or lost to follow-up. Noninferiority of 
LCP-Tacro with respect to the composite primary endpoint was assessed using a (2-sided) 95% CI based 
on the risk difference for efficacy failure between the treatment groups (LCP-Tacro minus Prograf). If the 
upper bound of the 95% CI for the difference in efficacy failure was less than 0.09 in the mITT analysis 
set, then LCP-Tacro was considered non-inferior to Prograf. The 95% CI for the difference in efficacy 
failure rates were calculated using exact methods. 
Primary Safety Endpoint Analysis 
The primary safety endpoint was the differences between treatment groups at 12 months after 
randomization with respect to the incidence of AEs and the incidence of predefined potentially clinically 
significant laboratory measures that included: fasting plasma glucose level >200 mg/dL; platelets < 100 
x 109 cells/L; WBC < 2.0 x 109 cells/L; transaminases >100 U/L; total cholesterol > 300 mg/dL; LDL 
cholesterol > 200 mg/dL; triglycerides > 500 mg/dL; and eGFR < 30 mL/min. Differences among 
treatment groups with respect to AE incidence and the incidence of predefined potentially clinically

a treatment difference of 0% (95.2% confidence interval [CI]: -4.21% to 4.21%) was observed. 
The primary efficacy failure within 12 months in the mITT set for centrally read BPAR is summarised as 
follows: 
Table 41

The overall efficacy failure rate was lower for LCP-Tacro (1.9%) than for Prograf (3.7%) and the 
treatment difference (CI) was -1.85% (-6.51%, 2.30%). No statistically significant difference was 
observed between LCP-Tacro and Prograf for the incidence rate of overall efficacy failure, death, graft 
failure, centrally read BPAR or loss to follow-up. 
LCP-Tacro 3002: A Phase 3, Double-Blind, Double-Dummy, Multi-Center, Prospective, Randomized 
Study of the Efficacy and Safety of LCP-Tacro Tablets, Once Daily, Compared to Prograf Capsules, Twice 
Daily, in Combination With Mycophenolate Mofetil for the Prevention of Acute Allograft Rejection in De 
Novo Adult Kidney Transplant Recipients 
Methods 
This was a 2-arm parallel group, prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter

of allograft rejection in adult male and female recipients of a de novo primary or secondary kidney 
transplant evaluated by a combined efficacy endpoint of death, acute rejection, graft loss, and patient 
loss. The study was designed to determine if the test drug, LCP-Tacro, was not inferior to an 
unacceptable extent to the comparator compound, Prograf. 
Study Participants 
The study population comprised 543 adult (≥18 years) primary or secondary kidney transplant patients. 
Recipients of another organ (liver, heart, lung, pancreas, or intestinal transplant) or bone marrow 
transplant were not eligible.

Treatments 
Patients were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 2 formulations of tacrolimus (LCP-Tacro or 
Prograf) as follows: 
Test treatment: LCP-Tacro tablets, once daily, orally; provided in 0.75-mg, 1.0-mg, and 4.0-mg dosage 
strengths. 
Comparator treatment: Prograf capsules (tacrolimus), twice daily, orally; provided in 0.5-mg, 1-mg, 
and 5-mg dosage strengths. 
All patients also received matching double-dummy placebo to maintain the blind. 
LCP-Tacro was started at 0.17 mg/kg/day given as a single morning dose. Prograf was started at a total 
daily dose (TDD) of 0.1 mg/kg/day, given as 2 equally divided doses 12 hours apart (1 in the morning 
before noon and 1 in the evening). Subsequent doses of each study drug were adjusted to maintain 
trough concentrations of tacrolimus in whole blood within the target range of 6 to 11 ng/mL for the first 
30 days, then 4 to 11 ng/mL for the remainder of the study.

Objectives 
The objectives of the study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LCP-Tacro (tacrolimus) tablets 
administered once daily compared to Prograf (tacrolimus) capsules twice daily as immunosuppression 
for the prevention of acute allograft rejection in de novo adult kidney transplant recipients treated for a 
12-month treatment period followed by a 12-month, blinded treatment extension period, and to show 
that LCP-Tacro tablets are not clinically inferior to Prograf capsules in the prevention of acute allograft 
rejection in de novo adult kidney transplant recipients. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of treatment failures within 12 months, up to and 
including Day 365, after the randomization date. Treatment failure was a composite endpoint that 
included any of the following events: death, graft failure (initiation of chronic maintenance dialysis, 
current allograft nephrectomy, or re-transplantation), biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) (Banff 
Grade ≥ 1A), or lost to follow-up. Patients who did not experience these events or discontinued the study 
for other reasons (including adverse events [AEs], withdrawn consent, physician decision, sponsor 
decision, unsatisfactory therapeutic effect, or noncompliance) were not counted as treatment failures. 
Secondary 
The incidence of each event within 12 months, up to and including Day 365 after the randomization date, 
was a secondary efficacy endpoint. The secondary efficacy endpoints were: 12-month all-cause 
mortality rate, 12-month graft failure rate, 12-month BPAR rate, 12-month incidence of death, or graft 
failure. 
Other Efficacy 
The other efficacy endpoints were: 
•  Twelve-month (Day 404, the upper limit of the day range for the Month 12 Visit, or 18 Mar 2013, 
whichever was earlier) incidence of clinically suspected and treated acute rejections 
•  Twelve-month (up to and including Day 365 after the randomization date) incidence of 
premature discontinuation for any reason 
•  Severity grades of the first episode of BPAR at Day 404, the upper limit of the day range for the 
Month 12 Visit, or 18 Mar 2013, whichever was earlier. 
•  Time-to-event (up to and including Day 365 after the randomization date) analysis of treatment 
failure, graft and patient survival, and time to first episode of BPAR. 
Secondary safety endpoints included: 
1. New-onset diabetes mellitus within 6 months and 12 months 
2. Incidences of any opportunistic infection and any malignancy 
3. Incidences of post-transplant lymphoproliferation disorder (PTLD) among all patients and within the 
patients who are EBV seronegative at the time of transplant 
4. Mean change from Baseline (Day 30) in estimated creatinine clearance by estimated glomerular flow 
rate (eGFR) at Months 3, 6, and 12 
5. Mean dose of study drug and mean tacrolimus whole blood trough level at each post randomization 
visit 
6. Interpatient and intrapatient variability of tacrolimus whole blood trough levels

7. Change in clinical laboratories and vital signs at each time point 
8. Incidence of 12-lead ECGs clinical findings at each time point 
9. In patients not diabetic at time of transplant, mean change from (Baseline) Day 0 in 
HbA1c at Days 90, 180 and 360 
10. Incidence of clinically significant infection (confirmed by culture, biopsy, genomic or serologic 
findings) that requires hospitalization or systemic anti-infective treatment, or is otherwise deemed 
significant by the Investigator 
11. Cytomegalovirus [CMV] disease will be assessed as 1) symptomatic CMV syndrome, 2) 
tissue-invasive CMV disease and 3) asymptomatic CMV). 
12. Incidence of BK virus viremia at days 30, 90, 180 and 360 
13. Incidence of BK virus nephropathy 
Sample size 
A total of 601 patients were enrolled into the study and 58 of these patients (9.7%) were not randomly 
assigned to study treatment. Of the 543 patients randomly assigned to study drug, 268 patients were in 
the LCP-Tacro group and 275 were in the Prograf group. Two patients in the LCP-Tacro group and 4 
patients in the Prograf group were randomly assigned and not dosed. Overall, 425 patients (78.3%) 
completed the 12-month study drug treatment. 
Randomisation 
Randomization was performed using a fixed-block randomization scheme. The randomization scheme 
was generated before the initiation of the study by an independent statistician/programmer who was not 
a member of the study team; all investigators were not aware of the block size of the randomization 
scheme. Randomization was stratified by site and race (black vs. non-black). 
Blinding (masking) 
A double-blind, double-dummy study design was used to mask the placebo and active formulations. 
Consequently, both the investigator and patient did not know the treatment group to which the patient 
was assigned, thus reducing bias. To maintain blinding of both the investigator and the patient, all 
patients took tablets (LCP-Tacro/matching placebo) in the morning and capsules (over encapsulated 
Prograf to maintain the blind/matching placebo) twice daily. 
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, treatment failure rate within 12 months after 
randomization, was summarized for the ITT set. The number and percentage of patients who 
experienced any event qualifying as treatment failure event was presented by treatment group. The 
noninferiority of LCP-Tacro with respect to treatment failure within 12 months was assessed using a 
2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the difference in treatment failure rates between the 
treatment groups at 12 months, i.e., LCP-Tacro minus Prograf. The 95% confidence limits for the 
difference in treatment failure rates were calculated using the Newcombe-Wilson score method.

Recruitment 
Study Initiation Date: 13 Oct 2010 (first patient enrolled) 
12-Month Study Completion Date: 20 Mar 2013 (last patient completed 12-month visit) 
Conduct of the study 
Overall, 21 patients (3.9%) had at least 1 major protocol deviation, 10 in the LCP-Tacro group and 11 in 
the Prograf group. Most of the protocol deviations were related to investigational product issues or 
randomization errors.

Outcomes and estimation 
Results for treatment failure and individual events defining treatment failure within 12 months after 
randomization are presented in Table 45. 
The overall incidence of treatment failure was 18.3% for patients in the LCP-Tacro treatment group and 
19.6% for patients in the Prograf treatment group. The treatment difference (CI) was -1.35% (-7.94% 
to 5.27%), below the noninferiority margin of 10%. No statistically significant difference was observed 
between the LCP-Tacro and Prograf treatment groups for the incidence rate of all-cause mortality, graft 
failure, BPAR, or lost to follow-up.

a   Two-sided 95% confidence intervals were calculated using Newcombe-Wilson score intervals. For the primary efficacy 
endpoint (12-month treatment failure rate), the difference between groups was assessed via a non-inferiority approach with 
a non-inferiority margin of 10%. 
b The P value was based on a 2-sided Fisher exact test to evaluate the difference between treatment groups in the incidence of 
events defining treatment failure (death, graft failure, BPAR, and lost to follow-up).  
Secondary Endpoints 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of event rates for the ITT set are presented in Table 46. Kaplan-Meier analysis 
of time to treatment failure is also displayed graphically in Figure 3. No statistically significant difference 
was observed between the 2 treatment groups in time-to-event distribution by log-rank P value for: 
treatment failure, first episode of BPAR, graft failure, all-cause mortality, graft failure or death, 
discontinuation from study or study drug, or discontinuation from study or study drug due to AEs. The

No statistically significant difference was observed between the 2 treatment groups in the incidence of 
treatment failure when stratified by baseline, sex, race, age (i.e., <65 and ≥65 years), BMI, diabetes at 
the time of transplant, and geographic region. However, some differences occurred when the incidence 
of treatment failure was stratified by race, age, and geographic region (Table 47). 
Table 47 
Incidence of Treatment Failure Within 12 Month After Randomization: 
Analysis Stratified by Race, Age, and Geographic Region (ITT Set) 
When stratified by race, the incidence of treatment failure was greater in blacks in the Prograf group 
compared with the LCP-Tacro group (40.0% vs. 30.0%), with a treatment difference 
(CI) of -10.00% (-40.95%, 26.42%) (LCP-Tacro minus Prograf) (P = 0.691); although the clinical 
significance is unknown as the patient samples were small (10 and 15 black patients in the LCP-Tacro 
and Prograf groups, respectively). 
When stratified by age, the incidence of treatment failure was greater in patients 65 years and older in 
the Prograf group compared with the LCP-Tacro group (21.4% vs. 6.3%), with a treatment difference 
(CI) of -15.18% (-34.00%, 9.59%) (LCP-Tacro minus Prograf) (P = 0.393); although the clinical 
significance is unknown as the patient samples were unequal and small (16 and 28 patients who were 65 
years and older in the LCP-Tacro and Prograf groups, respectively). 
When stratified by geographic region, the incidence of treatment failure within 12 months in Latin 
America was greater in the Prograf group compared with the LCP-Tacro group (28.8% vs. 14.0%), with 
a treatment difference (CI) of -14.78% (-29.04%, 0.29%) (LCP-Tacro minus Prograf) (P = 0.071). In 
Asia Pacific, the incidence of treatment failure was greater in the LCP-Tacro group compared with the 
Prograf group (50.0% vs. 33.3%), with a treatment difference (CI) of 16.67% (-17.41%, 46.13%) 
(LCP-Tacro minus Prograf) (P = 0.462); although the clinical significance is unknown as the patient 
samples were small (14 and 15 patients in the LCP-Tacro and Prograf groups, respectively). 
Severity of the first episode of BPAR and incidence of clinically suspected and treated acute rejection 
episodes within 12 months after randomization for the ITT set is presented in Table 48. There was no 
statistically significant difference between the 2 treatment groups in the incidence of patients with 
clinically suspected and treated rejections, the number of BPAR episodes, or the severity of the first BPAR 
episode. Of the patients with 1 or more BPAR episodes or clinically suspected and treated rejection 
episodes, most had only 1 episode. Most of the first BPAR episodes were mild in severity.

Categorical analysis of treatment failure by time of occurrence for the ITT set is presented in Table 49. 
No statistically significant treatment differences were observed in the occurrences of treatment failure, 
graft failure, BPAR, or lost to follow-up when categorically analyzed by time of occurrence. A significant 
treatment difference was observed in the occurrence of death when analyzed by time (P = 0.007). All 8 
deaths in the LCP-Tacro group occurred 92 days or more after randomization (i.e., 4 to 12 months) while 
5 of the 8 deaths in the Prograf group occurred within 3 months of randomization.

“10-12 months.” 
b      P value from Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  test for general association.  
Kaplan-Meier analyses showed comparable efficacy throughout the 12-month study period including the 
early post-operative days when patients are at greatest risk of organ rejection and graft failure. Within 
the first 3 months after transplant, when patients are at the greatest risk of rejection, no statistically 
significant difference was observed in term of treatment failure rates between LCP-Tacro and Prograf - 
10.4% and 14.2%, respectively (P=0.124). No statistically significant difference was observed between 
the 2 treatment groups in the incidence of treatment failure also when stratified by baseline sex, race, 
age (i.e., <65 and ≥65 years), BMI, diabetes at the time of transplant, and geographic region.  
Tacrolimus Total Daily Dose (TDD) 
In the first week of dosing, TDD levels were higher in patients in the LCP-Tacro group compared with the 
Prograf group; on Days 2 through 4, mean LCP-Tacro TDD levels were approximately 12 mg compared 
with 7 to 8 mg in the Prograf group likely reflecting the higher starting dose of LCP-Tacro (0.17 mg/kg 
vs 0.10 mg/kg for Prograf). At Day 7, mean tacrolimus TDD levels were 10.4 and 9.1 mg in the 
LCP-Tacro and Prograf groups, respectively. Tacrolimus TDD levels were similar in both treatment 
groups from Day 10 through Week 3. From Month 1 through Month 12, tacrolimus TDD levels were lower 
in the LCP-Tacro group compared with the Prograf group and the difference increased continually over 
time. At the final visit on Month 12, mean levels in the LCP-Tacro group were 18.3% lower than in the 
Prograf group (4.09 mg in the LCP-Tacro group and 5.01 mg in the Prograf group) (see figure 4 below).  
Figure 4 
Group (ITT Set; Study LCP-Tacro 3002). 
Mean (±SEM) Tacrolimus Total Daily Dose (mg) Over Time by Treatment 
No meaningful differences between the treatment groups in mean tacrolimus total daily dose or 
tacrolimus trough levels were noted based on race or gender. The mean total dose (i.e., sum of all 
tacrolimus daily dose levels over 12 months) was 14.3% lower in the LCP-Tacro group (1659.5 mg) 
compared with the Prograf group (1935.8 mg), reflecting the lower daily dose of LCP-Tacro necessary to

provide comparable tacrolimus exposure. The average number of dose adjustments per month (after 
being normalized by exposure duration) was essentially the same (1.11) between the groups.  
Tacrolimus Trough Levels (TTLs): TTLs over time between LCP-Tacro and Prograf are displayed in Figure 
5. 
Figure 5 
Mean (±SEM) Tacrolimus Trough Level (ng/ml) Over Time by Treatment 
Group (ITT Set; Study LCP-Tacro 3002) 
The overall mean tacrolimus trough levels (TTLs) were within the predefined therapeutic range in both 
treatment groups through Month 12. TTLs were notably greater in the LCP-Tacro group compared with 
the Prograf group in the first 2 weeks after dosing; thereafter, trough levels in the 2 groups were similar. 
The mean TTLs from Day 1 through Month 12 were greater in the LCP-Tacro group; when calculated as 
the average of all trough level records, mean levels were 8.8 ng/ml in the LCP-Tacro group compared 
with 7.0 ng/ml in the Prograf group. Median values were generally similar or slightly lower than mean 
values. 
Proportion of Patients Achieving Therapeutic Tacrolimus Trough Levels 
On Day 2, 36.6% of patients in the LCP-Tacro group and 18.5% of patients in the Prograf group were 
within the target tacrolimus trough range; the majority of Prograf patients (74.7%) had trough levels 
less than 6 ng/ml compared with 33.5% in the LCP-Tacro group. From Day 2 through Day 7, 
approximately 30% to 40% of patients were within the target range. Of the patients in the LCP-Tacro 
group who did not meet the target range in this time period, the majority had levels greater than 
11 ng/ml, while the majority of patients in the Prograf group had levels below 6 ng/ml. By Day 10, 
approximately 50% of patients were within the target range and at Month 1, 57.1% and 70.3% of 
patients in the LCP-Tacro and Prograf groups, respectively, were within the target range. From Month 
1.5 through Month 12, the majority of patients were within the post 30-day target range of 4 to 11 ng/ml 
and the proportions of patients in each range were similar between the treatment groups. 
Dose Adjustments 
The majority of patients had at least 1 dose adjustment during the first 12 months of the study (96.2% 
and 97.8% in the LCP-Tacro and Prograf groups, respectively). More patients had dose adjustments in 
the first 3 months after the first dose (>79% in both treatment groups) compared with after 3 months; 
at >3 to ≤6 months, 65.4% and 61.3% in LCP-Tacro and Prograf groups, respectively, and at >6 to ≤12 
months, approximately half of all patients had dose adjustments. The average number of dose

adjustments per month (after being normalized by exposure duration) was essentially the same (1.11) 
between the groups. The majority of patients had an average of less than 1 dose adjustment per month 
(70.7% and 77.5% in the LCP-Tacro and Prograf groups, respectively); more patients in the LCP-Tacro 
group required 1 to less than 3 dose adjustments per month (23.3%) compared with the Prograf group 
(14.8%).

Primary 
endpoint 
Efficacy 
A composite primary endpoint for 
non-inferiority was used for efficacy failure 
at 12 months after the first dose of study 
drug and included any patient experiencing 
any of the following within 12 months up to 
and including D365 after random 
assignment to treatment: death, graft 
failure (initiation of chronic maintenance 
dialysis, current allograft nephrectomy, or 
re-transplantation.), biopsy-proven acute 
rejection (BPAR) (Banff Grade ≥1A), or lost 
to follow-up. Patients who did not experience 
these events or discontinued the study for 
other reasons (including adverse events 
[AEs], withdrawn consent, physician 
decision, sponsor decision, unsatisfactory 
therapeutic effect, or noncompliance) were 
not counted as treatment failures. 
The primary efficacy endpoint analysis was 
performed using the intent-to-treat (ITT) 
set. 
Secondary 
Efficacy 
The incidence of each event within 12 
months, up to and including Day 365 after 
the randomization date, was a secondary 
efficacy endpoint. The secondary efficacy 
endpoints were: 12-month all-cause 
mortality rate, 12-month graft failure rate, 
12-month BPAR rate, 12-month incidence of 
death, or graft failure. 
Other efficacy endpoints were: 
• Twelve-month (Day 404, the upper limit of 
the day range for the Month 12 Visit, or 18 
Mar 2013, whichever was earlier) incidence 
of clinically suspected and treated acute 
rejections 
• Twelve-month (up to and including Day 
365 after the randomization date) incidence 
of premature discontinuation for any reason 
• Severity grades of the first episode of BPAR 
at Day 404, the upper limit of the day range 
for the Month 12 Visit, or 18 Mar 2013, 
whichever was earlier. 
• Time-to-event (up to and including Day 
365 after the randomization date) analysis 
of treatment failure, graft and patient 
survival, and time to first episode of BPAR.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In order to demonstrate efficacy of LCP-Tacro in the claimed therapeutic indications, the applicant has 
conducted three clinical studies: two Phase 3 studies one in adult stable kidney transplant patients 
(Study LCP-Tacro 3001) and one Phase 3 and one Phase 2 studies in de novo adult kidney transplant 
patients (Studies LCP-Tacro 3002 & 2017).  All studies presented by the applicant enrolled a population 
that are the intended target population to benefit from study drug. Design of studies 3001 & 3002 are a 
non-inferior open-label, multicenter, prospective, randomized efficacy and safety study in the either 
stable kidney transplant conversion setting or the de novo kidney transplant setting for the prevention 
of acute allograft rejection. These designs are acceptable to establish non-inferiority to Prograf in this 
patient population.   
The choice of a composite primary endpoint for the main pivotal non-inferiority trial (study 3001) to 
study efficacy failure at 12 months after the first dose of study drug, included any patient experiencing 
any of the following within 12 months (by Day 360) after random assignment to treatment: death, graft 
failure (return to dialysis for >30 days, allograft nephrectomy, or retransplantation), biopsy-proven 
acute rejection (BPAR) (Banff grade ≥1A), or loss to follow-up, is in line with the relevant CHMP scientific 
advice and the primary endpoint used to support the efficacy for the reference medicinal product 
Advagraf . The choice of the secondary endpoints is relevant to support the non-inferiority claim of 
LCP-Tacro to comparator treatment with Prograf.

The treatment groups in main study 3001 are in accordance with the CHMP scientific advice given, with 
the intended treatment dose of LCP-Tacro to be 20% lower than that of Prograf.  The outcomes reveal 
that patients can be successfully converted from Prograf to LCP-Tacro at a lower dose and with q.d. 
dosing. LCP-Tacro patients, on average, required a total daily dose about 20% lower than patients 
receiving Prograf.  The duration of study was acceptable to demonstrate long term maintenance effect of 
LCP-Tacro in the conversion setting. 
Similarly to Study 3001, the choice of a composite primary endpoint for pivotal non-inferiority trial 3002 
to study efficacy failure at 12 months after the first dose of study drug as well as the secondary 
endpoints is considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The results from the main study 3001 showed that in the conversion setting there was no clinical 
difference in treatment failure between LCP-Tacro (4/162; 2.5%) and Prograf (4/162; 2.5%). The CIs 
constructed for the incidence differences of LCP-Tacro indicated no statistical difference between 
treatment groups. With respect to efficacy failure, a treatment difference of 0% (95.2% confidence 
interval [CI]: -4.21% to 4.21%) was observed. Similar results for the PP set at 12 months were 
reported. The secondary endpoints (Incidence of Efficacy Failure at 6 Months mITT & 12 Months PP set) 
also showed no statistically significant difference in efficacy failure and its individual component between 
the 2 treatments. In addition, the incidences of death or graft failure and allograft rejections within 6 
months in the mITT resulted in no statistically significance difference was observed between the 2 
treatments for the mITT set at 6 months for death or graft failure, locally-read BPAR (Banff grade 1A), 
steroid-resistant acute rejection, clinically suspected and treated rejection episodes or severity of the 
first episode of BPAR (Banff grade), with an overall incidence of less than 1% for all endpoints. The same 
result was seen for the incidence of death or graft failure, allograft rejections, and premature 
discontinuation within 12 Months for the mITT set. No statistically significant difference was observed 
between the 2 treatments for the mITT set at 12 months for death or graft failure, locally-read BPAR 
(Banff grade 1A), steroid-resistant acute rejection, clinically suspected and treated rejection episodes or 
severity of the first episode of BPAR (Banff grade), with an overall incidence of 0% to 1.2% for all 
endpoints. The results from pivotal study 3001 showed that stable kidney transplanted patients can be 
adequately switched from Prograf to LCP-tacrolimus without a failure in efficacy. 
Data to support efficacy in the claimed de novo kidney indication was provided by Study 3002 and Study 
2017 as well as the pharmacokinetic profile of LCP-Tacro obtained from studies 1015, 1016 and 1017. 
The applicant claimed that the PK data can be considered a valid surrogate endpoint for both safety and 
efficacy for tacrolimus. The CHMP discussed the extensive PK data submitted and agreed that conversion 
factors have been established that allow switching between formulations as judged from trough 
concentrations which are in line with the clinical use of tacrolimus. In addition, Study 1017 between 
LCP-Tacro and Advagraf shows similar PKs profiles and any differences in the concentration time curves 
could be expected to lack any clinical relevance. The CHMP concluded that based on the extensive PK 
characterisation of LCP-Tacro and the clinical use of tacrolimus (i.e. clinical monitoring and dose 
adjustments to remain within effective plasma concentrations), clinically important differences between 
Advagraf and LCP-Tacro are not expected as the known differences, i.e. lack of bioequivalence with 
respect to AUC and Cmin (other PK variables not being considered clinically relevant) can be handled by 
conversion factors and monitoring.  
Based on the above and the extensive clinical experience with Advagraf, the CHMP considered that the 
available pharmacokinetics data for LCP-Tacro in de novo and conversion renal transplant setting allow 
bridging both products with regards to the use in the treatment of acute rejection.  
CHMP assessment report 
Envarsus 
EMA/CHMP/81205/2014 
Page 84/118 
 
  
These considerations lead the CHMP to agree that all the PK data in this dossier could support the 
efficacy of LCP-Tacro in the de novo kidney setting. This hypothesis was confirmed further by a 
confirmatory phase III study in the de novo kidney setting (study 3002).   
The results in study 3002 for primary efficacy failure rate within 12 months for the ITT set showed 
treatment failure rates of 18.3% for the LCP-Tacro treatment group and 19.6% for the Prograf treatment 
group, and the treatment difference (95% CI) was -1.35% (–7.94%, 5.27%), i.e. below the 
non-inferiority margin of 10.0%. The percentage of patients with one or greater than one episodes of 
clinically-suspected and treated rejections during the 360-day study was 13.8% for the Envarsus group 
(N=268) and 15.6% for the Prograf group (N=275). The event rate for centrally-read, biopsy-confirmed 
acute rejection (BPAR) during the 360-day study was 13.1% in the Envarsus group (N=268) and 13.5% 
in the Prograf group (N=275). No statistically significant difference was observed between the LCP-Tacro 
and Prograf treatment groups for the incidence rate of any of the individual events defining treatment 
failure (all-cause mortality, graft failure, BPAR, or lost to follow-up). No statistically significant difference 
was observed between the 2 treatment groups in time-to-event distribution by log-rank P value for 
treatment failure, first episode of BPAR, graft failure, all-cause mortality, graft failure or death, 
discontinuation from study or study drug, or discontinuation from study or study drug due to AEs. No 
statistically significant difference was observed between the 2 treatment groups in the incidence of 
treatment failure when stratified by baseline sex, race, age (i.e., <65 and 65 years), BMI, diabetes at the 
time of transplant, and geographic region. There was no statistically significant difference between the 
2 treatment groups in the incidence of patients with clinically suspected and treated rejections, the 
number of BPAR episodes, or the severity of the first BPAR episode. Of the patients with 1 or more BPAR 
episodes or clinically suspected and treated rejection episodes, most had only 1 episode. Most of the first 
BPAR episodes were mild in severity. No statistically significant treatment differences were observed in 
the occurrences of treatment failure, graft failure, BPAR, or lost to follow-up when categorically analysed 
by time of occurrence.  
The results from pivotal study 3002 showed that in de novo kidney transplanted patients LCP-Tacro is 
non-inferior to Prograf.   
Data to support efficacy in the claimed liver transplant indication is provided by two clinical Phase 2 
studies conducted in a total of 117 liver transplant recipients in study 2012, its extension 2012E, and 
study 2018. In the de novo liver transplant study, 29 subjects were treated with LCP-Tacro. The event 
rate of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection within the 360 day study period was 0% in the Envarsus group 
and 6.9% in the tacrolimus immediate-release group. Although no pivotal efficacy study to show the 
suitability of conversion from Prograf to LCP-Tacro in liver transplanted patients has been submitted, a 
phase 2 study (2012) and its extension (2012E) were provided showing that at day 21, the test product 
and LCP-Tacro are bioequivalent to Prograf as the CIs lie within the 80-125 CIs.  
The CHMP discussed the extensive PK data submitted and agreed that conversion factors have been 
established that allow switching between formulations as judged from trough concentrations which are 
in line with the clinical use of tacrolimus. Furthermore, based on the extensive clinical experience with 
Advagraf, the CHMP considered that the available pharmacokinetics data for LCP-Tacro in de novo and 
conversion liver transplant setting allow bridging both products with regards to the use in the treatment 
of acute rejection. 
The efficacy of tacrolimus as immunosuppressive rescue medication in solid organ transplant recipients 
is well defined. No specific studies on LCP-Tacro tablets as a rescue medication in case of allograft 
rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal products have been conducted 
by the applicant in support of this application. However, LCP-Tacro has demonstrated a robust 
correlation between trough blood levels and overall exposure, allowing for effective dose titration 
according to tacrolimus trough blood levels. Based on the outcomes of the clinical Phase 2 and 3 
development programmes on LCP-Tacro tablets for the prevention of kidney or liver allograft rejection, 
CHMP assessment report 
Envarsus 
EMA/CHMP/81205/2014 
Page 85/118 
 
  
it can be concluded that LCP-Tacro tablets are efficacious in a solid organ rejection rescue medication 
setting. This data and the extensive clinical knowledge on tacrolimus-containing products support the 
therapeutic indication for LCP-Tacro tablets in the: “Treatment of allograft rejection resistant to 
treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal products in adult patients” in line with the 
indications of the European reference medicinal product Advagraf and clinical comparator Prograf.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
LCP-Tacro efficacy in prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult kidney allograft recipients is based on 
both a single pharmacokinetic phase 2 open-label trial as well as a confirmatory phase III study.  
The activity of the clinical comparator Prograf in terms of prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult 
kidney allograft recipients been demonstrated and is well characterised. The event rate for locally read 
biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (BPAR) during the 360 day study was 1.2% in the LCP-Tacro group 
(N=162) post conversion from Prograf at a dose ratio of 0.7:1 mg and 1.2% in the group maintained on 
Prograf (N=162). The efficacy failure rate as measured by the composite endpoint of death, graft loss, 
locally read BPAR and loss to follow-up was 2.5% in both the LCP-Tacro and Prograf groups. The 
treatment difference (LCP-Tacro - Prograf) was 0% (95% confidence interval [-4.21%, 4.21%]). The 
treatment failure rate using the same composite end-point with centrally read BPAR was 1.9% in the 
LCP-Tacro group and 3.7% in the Prograf group (95% confidence interval [-6.51%, 2.31%]). 
In de novo kidney patients, the percentage of patients with one or greater than one  episodes of 
clinically-suspected and treated rejections during the 360-day study was 13.8% for the Envarsus group 
(N=268) and 15.6% for the Prograf group (N=275). The event rate for centrally-read, biopsy-confirmed 
acute rejection (BPAR) during the 360-day study was 13.1% in the Envarsus group (N=268) and 13.5% 
in the Prograf group (N=275). The efficacy failure rate as measured by the composite endpoint of death, 
graft loss, centrally read BPAR and loss to follow-up was 18.3% in the Envarsus group and 19.6% in the 
Prograf group. The treatment difference (Envarsus-Prograf) was -1.35% (95% confidence interval 
[-7.94%, 5.27%]). 
The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Envarsus and tacrolimus immediate-release capsules, both 
in combination with corticosteroids was compared in 117 liver transplant recipients, of whom 88 
received treatment with Envarsus. 
In the de novo liver transplant study, 29 subjects were treated with Envarsus. The event rate of 
biopsy-confirmed acute rejection within the 360 day study period was not significantly different between 
the Envarsus group and the tacrolimus immediate-release group. The overall incidence of fatal 
treatment emergent adverse events for the combined de novo and stable liver transplant population was 
not significantly different between the Envarsus group and the tacrolimus immediate-release group. 
Initially, the applicant proposed a limited indication (for use in kidney transplant patients). During the 
assessment, the applicant has substantiated the extrapolation of the PK data available with LCP-Tacro in 
the de novo kidney patients and in the liver and transplantation setting (including rescue indication). 
Based on the extensive clinical experience with the clinical comparator Prograf and the European 
reference medicinal product Advagraf, the CHMP considered that the available pharmacokinetics data for 
LCP-Tacro from de novo and conversion renal and liver setting allow bridging both products with regards 
to the use in the treatment of acute rejection. This data and the extensive clinical knowledge on 
tacrolimus-containing products support the therapeutic indication for LCP-Tacro tablets in the: 
“Treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal 
products in adult patients” in line with the European reference medicinal product Advagraf and the 
clinical comparator Prograf.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
The LCP-Tacro clinical development programme comprises: 14 clinical Phase 1 studies in 485 healthy 
volunteers; the Phase 1 studies tested 6 LCP-Tacro formulations and 7 doses; 4 clinical Phase 2 studies 
and one Phase 2 extension study with a total of 449 kidney transplant patients and 117 liver transplant 
patients; Two pivotal clinical Phase 3 Study LCP-Tacro 3001 & 3002 in kidney transplant patients.  
Patient Exposure 
6 multi-centre clinical studies (2 phase III study and 4 phase II studies) were performed in the USA (4 
in kidney transplantation (studies 3001, 3002, 2011 & 2017) and 2 in liver transplantation (studies 2012 
(including 2012e) & 2018) and Europe (2 phase III study in kidney transplantation), were used as the 
basis for analysis of ADRs for LCP-Tacro. This was primarily based on a total of 601 patients treated with 
LCP-Tacro in these 6 clinical studies (513 kidney-transplanted patients and 88 liver-transplanted 
patients). 162 patients treated in Phase III long term follow up study with 1 year analysis (study 3001). 
268 patients treated in Phase III de novo kidney transplant study (study 3002). The experience 
gathered in all Phase II studies is included into this analysis. Patient population is depicted in the 
following table.

The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs in the combined (i.e. studies 3001, 2011 and 2017) Phase 2/3 
clinical kidney transplant studies was similar with 76.3% for LCP-Tacro (n=187 of 245 patients) and 
72.2% for Prograf (n=177 of 251 patients). The incidence of treatment-emergent non-fatal serious AEs 
(SAEs) (reported for 99 patients [22.2%] overall: 50 patients [20.4%] in the LCP-Tacro group and 49 
[19.5%] in the Prograf group) was also similar between LCP-Tacro and Prograf, whereas the AEs leading 
to discontinuation was higher with LCP-Tacro as compared to Prograf. In total, 21 (4.7%) patients 
discontinued the assigned treatment in Phase 2 / 3 kidney transplant studies due to AEs (14 [5.7%]

LCP-Tacro patients and 7 [2.8%] Prograf patients). There were no particular individual AEs or system 
organ classes associated with discontinuation; the only AE leading to more than one discontinuation was 
cardiac arrest. 
For study 3002, the incidence of TEAEs was similar between the 2 treatment groups; 260 (97.0%) 
patients in the LCP-Tacro group and 269 (97.8%) patients in the Prograf group experienced TEAEs. The 
most frequently reported TEAEs (reported in 20% or more of patients overall) were: diarrhoea (33.5%), 
anaemia (28.7%), urinary tract infection (24.4%), hypertension (22.5%), constipation (24.4%), and 
peripheral oedema (20.7%). While most events occurred at a similar frequency in both treatment 
groups, constipation and peripheral oedema occurred more frequently in the Prograf group compared 
with the LCP-Tacro group: constipation (24.4% vs. 18.3%) and peripheral oedema (20.7% vs. 15.7%). 
Table 53 
Overview of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events per Study – Safety Analysis 
Set (Studies LCP–Tacro 3001, LCP-Tacro 2017) 
The Phase 2 clinical PK Study LCP-Tacro 2011 was a 3-sequence trial, including 59 stable kidney 
transplant patients. Study duration was 21 days (7 days on Prograf [b.i.d.], 14 days on LCP-Tacro q.d.]). 
Overall, 10 patients experienced AEs in Period I (Prograf period), 15 patients in Period II (LCP-Tacro 
period), 6 patients in Period III (LCP-Tacro period), and 4 patients during the follow-up period. No 
individual AE preferred term occurred in more than 2 patients in any treatment period. Three patients 
had SAEs and all of them were considered unrelated to treatment. Three patients discontinued due to 
AEs that were unrelated to treatment. No patients experienced graft loss or allograft rejection. There 
were no deaths during the study. Eight patients experienced events that were considered possibly 
related to LCP-Tacro. 
The most commonly reported AEs (reported for at least 5% of patients) are listed as follows:

Table 54 
Most Common Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (at Least 5% of Patients) 
Across the Combined Stable and De Novo Kidney Transplant Clinical Phase 2/3 
Studies (Pooled Safety Analysis Set – Veloxis LCP-Tacro ISS TFLs Combined 
Kidney Subset, 2012) 
Diarrhoea, UTI, blood creatinine increased and nausea were the most common AEs reported for patients 
in Phase 2/ 3 clinical kidney transplant studies.  No large differences were observed for LCP-Tacro and 
Prograf groups. The majority of AEs were mild or moderate. 
The integrated safety data pool of liver transplant patients (stable and de novo combined) included all 
liver transplant recipients treated with study medication from the completed Phase 2 clinical Study 
LCP-Tacro 2012, its extension Study LCP-Tacro 2012E, and Study LCP-Tacro 2018. The safety analysis 
set comprised a total of 117 liver transplant patients, of which 88 each were treated with LCP-Tacro and 
Prograf, respectively. None of the liver transplant patients were exposed to Advagraf. The proportion of 
patients who completed study in the respective treatment groups across the pooled clinical Phase 2 
studies was comparable (LCP-Tacro: 79.5%, Prograf: 85.2%). The overall exposure of liver transplant 
patients to LCP-Tacro was substantially higher as compared to Prograf, with a cumulative exposure of 
64.6 patient-years as compared to 21.2 person-years, reflecting a longer duration of exposure to 
LCP-Tacro in the LCP-Tacro 2012E extension study.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
In study 3001, there were 4 deaths in total. 2 patients in the LCP-Tacro group died of cardiac arrest. Both 
patients had a history of cardiac disease. Neither of the deaths was suspected of being related to study 
drug. Additionally, 2 patients died during the follow-up period, both of whom were discontinued from the 
study due to AEs: 1 patient in the LCP-Tacro group died of cardiac arrest approximately 4 months after 
discontinuing the study and 1 patient in the Prograf group died of lung cancer approximately 5 months 
after discontinuing the study.

In study 2018 (in Liver de novo patients) 4 patients died during the study. Two patients in the LCP-Tacro 
group (diarrhoea and ventricular dysfunction) and 2 patients in the Prograf group (sepsis and 
cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and cardiorespiratory arrest). One patient in the Prograf group, 
discontinued due to an AE (C. difficile infection). The other 3 patients died prior to study completion or 
withdrawal. None of these events were suspected by the investigator to be related to study medication.  
In study 3002, a total of 17 deaths occurred during the study: 12 treatment emergent and 5 
non-treatment emergent. The 12 patients experienced treatment-emergent SAEs that resulted in death 
for the ITT set.  
Overall, most causes of death in patients who experienced treatment-emergent SAEs were related to the 
cardiopulmonary system and included cardiorespiratory/respiratory distress, acute respiratory distress 
syndrome, acute myocardial infarction, cardiorespiratory failure, and bilateral pneumonia. Other causes 
were sepsis in 3 patients and suicide and B cell lymphoma in 1 patient each. Of the 12 deaths, 5 were in 
patients in the LCP-Tacro group and 7 were in patients in the Prograf group. None of the fatal SAEs in the 
LCP-Tacro group were suspected to be related to study drug. Three of the 7 patients who died in the 
Prograf group experienced events considered by the investigator to be related to study drug: sepsis in 
two patients; and pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and cardiac failure in another 
patient. 
For studies LCP-Tacro 2012, its extension Study LCP-Tacro 2012E, and Study LCP-Tacro 2018 (Liver 
transplant setting), fatal SAEs comprised 3 events in two subjects, which all occurred in the Prograf 
group: cardio-respiratory arrest, CMV infection and sepsis. 
Serious AEs 
Study 3001 
In study 3001 36 (22.2%) patients in the LCP-Tacro group experienced an SAE. There was no pattern in 
terms of the type of SAEs by Preferred Term or number of days post-randomization when the SAE 
occurred in either treatment group. Most of the SAEs were not suspected to be related to study drug. The 
events in 8 (2.5%) patients were suspected to be related to study drug, 4 (2.5%) patients in the 
LCP-Tacro group and 4 (2.5%) patients in the Prograf group. The suspected events in the LCP-Tacro 
group included Grade 2 cytomegalovirus infection, Grade 2 diabetes mellitus, Grade 2 drug toxicity, 
Grade 2 polyomavirus-associated nephropathy and Grade 2 Epstein-Barr virus infection. The 4 
suspected events in the Prograf group included Grade 3 UTI, Grade 2 increased blood creatinine, Grade 
2 UTI and Grade 2 urosepsis. 
Treatment emergent fatal adverse events occurred in 1.2% of Envarsus patients and 0.6% of Prograf 
patients. 
Study 3002 
Twelve patients experienced fatal treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs): 5 (1.9%) 
patients in the LCP-Tacro group and 7 (2.5%) patients in the Prograf group. Overall, most causes of 
death for patients with fatal SAEs were related to the cardiopulmonary system. None in the LCP-Tacro 
group were suspected of being related to study drug.

Table 55 
Serious TEAEs Occurring in More Than 1 Patient Overall by Preferred Term 
(Safety Set) 
Study 3002 
More than half of all patients experienced at least 1 SAE: 143 (53.4%) patients in the LCP-Tacro group 
and 162 (58.9%) patients in the Prograf group. SAEs experienced by more than 5% of patients in any 
treatment group were urinary tract infection, kidney transplant rejection, and complications of 
transplanted kidney. Urinary tract infection was reported slightly more commonly in the LCP-Tacro 
group (9.3%) compared with the Prograf group (6.9%), while kidney transplant rejection (4.2% and 
8.0% in the LCP-Tacro and Prograf groups, respectively) and complications of transplanted kidney 
(3.0% and 6.5% in the LCP-Tacro and Prograf groups, respectively) were reported more commonly in 
the Prograf group compared with the LCP-Tacro group. 
Study 2011 
Three SAEs occurred during the study 2011 in 3 patients: 1 patient was receiving 3 mg LPC-Tacro QD at 
the time of the event (AE:  Angina Pectoris), 1 patient was receiving 4 mg Prograf BID as part of Study 
Period I at the time of the event (AE:  small intestine obstruction), 1 patient had completed the study 
and had resumed prophylactic treatment with 4 mg BID Prograf (AE: pyrexia). None of these SAEs were 
considered to be related to the study drugs.  Overall both the nature and number of SAEs as well as 
significant AEs did not raise safety concerns regarding the use of LCP-Tacro. Since study 2011 was a 
short trial it is not unexpected that the incidence of SAEs was low. 
Study 2017 
SAEs were most commonly reported in the SOCs of Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders; 
Gastrointestinal Disorders; Infections and Infestations; Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural 
Complications; Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders; and Renal and Urinary Disorders. The observed 
SAEs are consistent with the events expected in this patient population. 
Fifteen patients in the LCP-Tacro group and 21 patients in the Prograf group experienced SAEs. Most of 
the SAEs were considered to be unrelated to study medication by the investigator. Four patients (3 in the 
LCP-Tacro group and 1 in the Prograf one) experienced SAEs that the investigator considered to be 
related (suspected) to study medication.

Study 2017 Rejection 
Rejection 
Seven patients overall experienced rejection AEs (preferred terms: kidney transplant rejection and 
transplant rejection). Three patients overall experienced kidney transplant rejection (1 patient on 
LCP-Tacro and 2 patients on Prograf) that were biopsy proven. Four patients experienced transplant 
rejection (1 patient on LCP-Tacro and 3 patients on Prograf) that was antibody-mediated. 
None of these events was serious, severe, or resulted in a patient discontinuing the study. The 
investigator did not consider any of the kidney transplant rejection events to be related (suspected) to 
study medication. The investigator considered 1 of the transplant rejection events (1 patient on Prograf) 
to be related to study medication. This patient had previously discontinued study medication on Day 70 
because of dehydration that was suspected of being secondary to myfortic intolerance and was 
diagnosed with moderate transplant rejection on Day 78. The event resolved without sequelae. 
Laboratory findings 
Generally, the clinical laboratory findings in kidney transplant recipients were similar in transplant 
recipients administered either Prograf or LCP-Tacro in Study 3001. However, it is noted that although 
not statistically significant, numerically, patients on LCP-Tacro had an increased FBG and blood lipid 
profile (cholesterol, LDL and TG) within 12 months as compared to Prograf.

Ethnicity 
Special studies to evaluate safety in different ethnic population have not been performed with 
LCP-Tacro. However, study 3001 has studied the efficacy and safety of LCP-Tacro in black patients as 
well as Caucasians. When converting from tacrolimus immediate-release products (e.g. Prograf 
capsules) or from Advagraf prolonged-release capsules to Envarsus, trough levels should be measured 
prior to conversion and within two weeks after conversion. Dose The CHMP noted that should be noted 
that black patients may require a higher dose to achieve the targeted trough levels.

Study 3001 
Discontinuation of patients due to AEs in the LCP-Tacro treatment group vs. Prograf was 10 patients and 
3 patients respectively (10/163 vs. 3/163). Reasons for discontinuation are given in the table below.  
Table 60 
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Leading to Study Drug Discontinuation 
by System Organ Class and Preferred Term Safety Set 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The incidence of AEs suspected to be causally related to study drug was low, with no substantial 
difference between LCP-Tacro and the clinical comparator. Among the most common AEs, the frequency 
of headache, diarrhoea, peripheral oedema, and fatigue was in excess for LCP-Tacro as compared to 
Prograf. AEs were mild or moderate in the majority of cases and consistent with what has been 
previously reported as occurring with other tacrolimus-containing products. 
Fatal SAEs comprised 3 events in two subjects, which all occurred in the Prograf group: 
cardio-respiratory arrest, CMV infection and sepsis. There is no consistent pattern suggesting 
differences between LCP-Tacro and Prograf with respect to AEs leading to study drug discontinuation: 
the frequency was higher with LCP-Tacro (7 events in 7 of 88 patients [8.0%] vs. one event in one of 88 
patient [1.1%] with Prograf), however, patients receiving LCP-Tacro were exposed for a greater length 
of time and had a greater opportunity to experience AEs. Overall, the combined analysis of stable, 
converted and de novo liver transplant patients revealed no significant differences in the nature and 
number of AEs, SAEs and clinically significant AEs between the LCP-Tacro and the Prograf groups. The 
types and frequencies of AEs were not unexpected in this patient population.

A re-analysis of safety data has been submitted by the applicant during the procedure, using tighter 
levels such as fasting plasma glucose level > 126 mg/dL, total cholesterol > 5 mmol/L; LDL cholesterol 
> 3 mmol/L; triglycerides > 2 mmol/L; and eGFR < 60 mL/min. Re-analyses of clinically significant 
laboratory measures with tighter cut-off levels performed by the applicant during the assessment 
showed no significant difference in the incidence of pre-defined potentially clinically significant 
laboratory tests between tacrolimus from either LCP-Tacro tablets q.d. or Prograf capsules b.i.d. in 
stable as well as in de novo kidney transplant patients.  
The integrated safety data pool of liver transplant patients (stable and de novo combined) included all 
liver transplant recipients treated with study medication from the completed Phase 2 clinical Study 
LCP-Tacro 2012, its extension Study LCP-Tacro 2012E, and Study LCP-Tacro 2018. The safety analysis 
set comprised a total of 117 liver transplant patients, of which 88 each were treated with LCP-Tacro and 
Prograf, respectively. None of the liver transplant patients were exposed to Advagraf. The proportion of 
patients who completed study in the respective treatment groups across the pooled clinical Phase 2 
studies was fairly comparable (LCP-Tacro: 79.5%, Prograf: 85.2%). The overall exposure of liver 
transplant patients to LCP-Tacro was substantially higher as compared to Prograf, with a cumulative 
exposure of 64.6 patient-years as compared to 21.2 person-years, reflecting a longer duration of 
exposure to LCP-Tacro in the LCP-Tacro 2012E extension study. 
In study 2012, there were no safety concerns regarding LCP-Tacro tablets q.d., and no patient 
experienced graft loss.  
The safety profile observed in study 2012E with a combined total of 52 weeks of LCP-Tacro treatment in 
the stable liver transplant setting was consistent with findings generally observed in such patients. In 
this study, most AEs were mild or moderate, did not significantly differ between the drug groups, and the 
incidence, type, and severity of adverse events were in the range expected in this patient population. 
Most of the adverse events were not related to study drug with no specific adverse event or unexpected 
trend of adverse events that indicated a dug related event. Overall, no new safety concerns related to 
LCP-Tacro were raised by the results of this study. One patient experienced mild acute rejection that 
responded to glucocorticoid treatment and the patient was able to continue treatment with LCP-Tacro. 
There were no deaths or graft losses. Headache, fatigue, back pain and diarrhoea were the most 
frequent adverse events. Renal and liver function parameters remained stable and there were no 
remarkable findings with regard to fasting blood glucose.  
In study 2018 there were no significant differences in safety between LCP-Tacro (q.d.) and Prograf 
(b.i.d.).  
In study 3001 a numerically higher serious non-fatal AEs (22.2%, n=36) was reported in the LCP-Tacro 
study versus Prograf (16% n=26). Two (2) patients in the LCP-Tacro group died of cardiac arrest versus 
0 patients in the Prograf group.  
Pooled analysis of phase 1 studies report a numerically higher TEAEs in the LCP-Tacro group (number of 
subjects=480; number of TEAEs=657; 48.3%) versus Prograf (number of subjects=90; number of 
TEAEs=23; 25.6%). In addition there has been a higher incidence of discontinuations associated to 
LCP-Tacro versus Prograf in across both phase I (24/485 (4.4%) vs. 3/90 (3.3%)) and phase II studies 
8/88 (9.1%) for LCP-Tacro vs. 3/88 (3.4%) for Prograf. As requested by CHMP, the applicant discussed 
the observation that overall across all phase I studies there have been increased discontinuations in 
subjects exposed to LCP-Tacro vs. comparators. The pooling of Phase 1 study data showed that a higher 
number of subjects discontinued participation in Phase 1 clinical studies due to adverse events (21 
subjects [4.4%]) in the LCP-Tacro treatment groups, versus 3 [3.3%] in the Prograf and 2 [8.7%] in the 
Advagraf treatment groups. The overall exposure of healthy subjects to LCP-Tacro tablets was 
substantially higher as compared to the comparators Prograf and Advagraf, with a cumulative exposure 
of 15.7 person-years as compared to 1.32 and 0.59 person-years, respectively. Adverse events reported 
CHMP assessment report 
Envarsus 
EMA/CHMP/81205/2014 
Page 96/118 
 
  
for healthy subjects across the combined clinical Phase 1 studies were headache, diarrhoea, 
constipation, nausea, dizziness, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and abdominal pain. The CHMP 
concluded that the results obtained appear not to be indicative for a potentially higher rate of AEs for 
tacrolimus from LCP-Tacro tablets as compared to tacrolimus from Prograf capsules or Advagraf 
capsules. The CHMP therefore agreed with the applicant’s justification that the apparently higher 
discontinuation rate due to adverse events across the clinical Phase 1 studies is mostly likely due to the 
far greater tacrolimus exposure in patients-years from LCP-Tacro tablets as compared to Prograf and 
Advagraf. With respect to the overall adverse event and suspected adverse drug reaction profile, there 
is no meaningful difference between LCP-Tacro and the comparator Prograf, in particular when the 
differences in exposure are considered.  
During the assessment the applicant provided the safety results from Study LCP-Tacro 3002 in de novo 
kidney transplant setting. A total of 543 patients at 70 sites were randomly assigned to study drug and 
517 patients completed through the 12-month visit. The numbers of patients who experienced adverse 
events resulting in discontinuation from study drug and/or withdrawal from the study were similar in the 
treatment groups (approximately 12.3%). Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug or 
study withdrawal that occurred in more than 2 patients in any treatment group were sepsis (0 and 3 
[1.1%] patients in the LCP-Tacro and Prograf groups, respectively) and kidney transplant rejection (1 
[0.4%] and 3 [1.1%] patients in the LCP-Tacro and Prograf groups, respectively). 
The safety results obtained in study 2017 in de novo kidney transplant patients (i.e. the higher risk 
group and the group that is most likely to discontinue treatment due to AEs) indicated that there is no 
imbalance between LCP-Tacro and Prograf.  
The CHMP concluded that discontinuations due to adverse events in kidney transplant recipients treated 
with tacrolimus from either LCP-Tacro tablets q.d. or Prograf capsules b.i.d. do essentially not differ 
between treatments.  
Altogether, the available data indicates that LCP-Tacro is considered to be not inferior to Prograf and 
Advagraf from a safety point of view. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
With respect to the overall safety of the active substance, the CHMP is of the opinion that many of the 
adverse drug reactions stated for tacrolimus are reversible and/or respond to dose reduction. 
Therapeutic drug monitoring by specialised personal (keeping target whole blood levels in relatively 
small window) enables safe administration of tacrolimus as described in the product information and the 
RMP.  
The CHMP considered that there are no significant differences between LCP-Tacro and Prograf with 
respect to the AE profile. This information brings no new signals with tacrolimus. All SAEs listed with 
LCP-Tacro are known AEs for tacrolimus. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system

Ventricular

cardiomyopathies 
Warnings in section 4.4 of the proposed SmPC 
for Envarsus: 
None 
Ventricular hypertrophy or hypertrophy of the 
septum reported as cardiomyopathies, have 
been observed in Prograf treated patients on 
rare occasions and may therefore also occur 
with Envarsus. Most cases have been reversible, 
occurring with tacrolimus blood trough 
concentrations much higher than the 
recommended maximum levels. Other factors 
observed to increase the risk of these clinical 
conditions included pre-existing heart disease, 
corticosteroid usage, hypertension, renal or 
hepatic dysfunction, infections, fluid overload, 
and oedema. Accordingly, high-risk patients 
receiving substantial immunosuppressives 
should be monitored, using such procedures as 
echocardiography or ECG pre- and post- 
transplant (e.g. initially at 3 months and then at 
9 to 12 months). 
If abnormalities develop, dose reduction of 
Envarsus therapy, or change of treatment to 
another immunosuppressive agent should be 
considered. Tacrolimus may prolong the QT 
interval but at this time lacks substantial 
evidence for causing Torsades de Pointes. 
Caution should be exercised in patients with 
diagnosed or suspected Congenital Long QT 
Syndrome.

changes, exposure to sunlight and UV light 
should be limited by wearing protective clothing 
and using a sunscreen with a high protection 
factor. 
Statement in section 4.4 of the proposed SmPC 
for Envarsus: 
None 
Patients treated with tacrolimus have 
been reported to develop EBV-associated 
lymphoproliferative disorders. A combination 
of immunosuppressives such as antilymphocytic 
antibodies given concomitantly increases the 
risk of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative 
disorders. EBV-viral capsid antigen (VCA)- 
negative patients have been reported to have 
an increased risk of developing 
lymphoproliferative disorders. Therefore, in this 
patient group, EBV-VCA serology should be 
ascertained before starting treatment with 
Envarsus. During treatment, careful monitoring 
with EBV-PCR is recommended. Positive EBV- 
PCR may persist for months and is per se not 
indicative of lymphoproliferative disease or 
lymphoma.

Serious infections and 
reactivation of 
pre-existing 
infections 
Patients treated with immunosuppressants, 
including Envarsus are at increased risk for 
opportunistic infections (bacterial, fungal, viral 
and protozoal). Among these conditions are BK 
virus associated nephropathy and JC virus 
associated progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML). These infections 
are often related to a high total 
immunosuppressive burden and may lead to 
serious or fatal conditions that physicians 
should consider in the differential diagnosis in 
immunosuppressed patients with deteriorating 
renal function or neurological symptoms. 
Patients treated with tacrolimus have been 
reported to develop posterior reversible 
encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). If patients 
taking tacrolimus present with symptoms 
indicating PRES such as headache, altered 
mental status, seizures, and visual 
disturbances, a radiological procedure (e.g. 
MRI) should be performed. If PRES is 
diagnosed, adequate blood pressure and 
seizure control and immediate discontinuation 
of systemic tacrolimus is advised. Most patients 
completely recover after appropriate measures 
are taken. 
Listed in section 4.8 of the proposed SmPC. 
Pure red cell aplasia 
(PRCA) 
Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have 
been reported in patients treated with 
tacrolimus. All patients reported risk factors for 
PRCA such as parvovirus B19 infection, 
underlying disease or concomitant medications 
associated with PRCA.

Off-label use 
With the alignment of indications for Envarsus 
with Advagraf the risk of off-label use for 
Envarsus should be low. The proposed Envarsus 
SmPC indicates in section 4.4 “Special 
warnings and precautions for use” that due to 
the lack of data, Envarsus should not be used for 
the treatment of children and not as primary 
therapy in heart transplant recipients.  The 
MAH will keep off-label use as an important 
potential risk and considers sufficient to monitor 
such risk through routine pharmacovigilance 
measures.

Use in pregnancy 
Statement in section 4.6 of the proposed SmPC 
for Envarsus: 
None 
Human data show that tacrolimus crosses the 
placenta. Limited data from organ transplant 
recipients show no evidence of an increased risk 
of adverse events on the course and outcome of 
pregnancy under tacrolimus treatment compared 
with other immunosuppressive medicinal 
products. To date, no other relevant 
epidemiological data are available. Tacrolimus 
treatment can be considered in pregnant women, 
when there is no safer alternative and when the 
perceived benefit justifies the potential risk to the 
foetus. In case of in utero exposure, monitoring 
of the newborn for the potential adverse events of 
tacrolimus is recommended 
(in particular the effects on the kidneys). There 
is a risk for premature delivery (<37 week) as 
well as for hyperkalaemia in the newborn. 
Use in lactation 
None 
Statement in section 4.6 of the proposed SmPC 
for Envarsus: 
Human data demonstrate that tacrolimus is 
excreted in breast milk. As detrimental effects 
on the newborn cannot be excluded, women 
should not breast-feed whilst receiving 
Envarsus. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
2.9.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by 
the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the 
Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
To support the application two pivotal phase III studies (3001 & 3002) and 2 phase II PK studies 
(2017/2011) have been submitted as well as numerous PK studies in healthy volunteers, a food 
interaction study and 2 PK studies in Liver transplant patients (2012 including  2012E/2018). 
The activity of the clinical comparator Prograf in terms of prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult 
kidney allograft recipients been demonstrated and is well characterised. The event rate for locally 
CHMP assessment report 
Envarsus

Page 108/118 
 
  
 
 
read biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (BPAR) during the 360 day study was 1.2% in the LCP-Tacro 
group (N=162) post conversion from Prograf at a dose ratio of 0.7:1 mg and 1.2% in the group 
maintained on Prograf (N=162). The efficacy failure rate as measured by the composite endpoint of 
death, graft loss, locally read BPAR and loss to follow-up was 2.5% in both the LCP-Tacro and 
Prograf groups. The treatment difference (LCP-Tacro - Prograf) was 0% (95% confidence interval 
[-4.21%, 4.21%]). The treatment failure rate using the same composite end-point with centrally 
read BPAR was 1.9% in the LCP-Tacro group and 3.7% in the Prograf group (95% confidence 
interval [-6.51%, 2.31%]). 
In de novo kidney patients, the percentage of patients with one or greater than one episodes of 
clinically-suspected and treated rejections during the 360-day study was 13.8% for the Envarsus 
group (N=268) and 15.6% for the Prograf group (N=275). The event rate for centrally-read, 
biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (BPAR) during the 360-day study was 13.1% in the Envarsus 
group (N=268) and 13.5% in the Prograf group (N=275). The efficacy failure rate as measured by 
the composite endpoint of death, graft loss, centrally read BPAR and loss to follow-up was 18.3% in 
the Envarsus group and 19.6% in the Prograf group. The treatment difference (Envarsus-Prograf) 
was -1.35% (95% confidence interval [-7.94%, 5.27%]). 
The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Envarsus and tacrolimus immediate-release capsules, 
both in combination with corticosteroids was compared in 117 liver transplant recipients, of whom 
88 received treatment with Envarsus. In the de novo liver transplant study, 29 subjects were 
treated with Envarsus. The event rate of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection within the 360 day study 
period was not significantly different between the Envarsus group and the tacrolimus 
immediate-release group. The overall incidence of fatal treatment emergent adverse events for the 
combined de novo and stable liver transplant population was not significantly different between the 
Envarsus group and the tacrolimus immediate-release group. 
Initially, the applicant proposed a limited indication (for use in kidney transplant patients). During 
the assessment, the applicant has substantiated the extrapolation of the PK data available with 
LCP-Tacro in the de novo kidney patients and in the liver and transplantation setting (including 
rescue indication). Based on the extensive clinical knowledge with the clinical comparator Prograf 
and the European reference medicinal product Advagraf, the CHMP considered that the available 
pharmacokinetics data for LCP-Tacro from de novo and conversion renal and liver setting allow 
bridging both products with regards to the use in the treatment of acute rejection setting. This data 
and the extensive clinical knowledge on tacrolimus-containing products support the therapeutic 
indication for LCP-Tacro  tablets in the: “Treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with 
other immunosuppressive medicinal products in adult patients” in line with the European reference 
medicinal product Advagraf and the clinical comparator Prograf.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Allograft transplant patients maintained on twice daily Prograf (immediate-release) or Advagraf 
(once daily) dosing requiring conversion to once daily Envarsus should be converted on a 1:0.7 
(mg:mg) total daily dose basis, i.e. the Envarsus maintenance dose should be 30% less than the 
Prograf or Advagraf dose. In stable patients converted from tacrolimus immediate-release products 
(twice daily) to Envarsus (once daily) on a 1:0.7 (mg:mg) total daily dose basis, the mean systemic 
exposure to tacrolimus (AUC 0-24) was similar to that of immediate-release tacrolimus. The 
relationship between tacrolimus trough levels (C24) and systemic exposure (AUC0-24) for Envarsus 
CHMP assessment report 
Envarsus 
EMA/CHMP/81205/2014 
Page 109/118 
 
  
is similar to that of immediate-release tacrolimus. No studies have been conducted with conversion 
of patients from Advagraf to Envarsus. However, data from healthy volunteers would suggest that 
the same conversion rate is applicable as with the conversion from Prograf to Envarsus. When 
converting from tacrolimus immediate-release products (e.g. Prograf capsules) or from Advagraf 
prolonged-release capsules to Envarsus, trough levels should be measured prior to conversion and 
within two weeks after conversion. Dose adjustments should be made to ensure that similar 
systemic exposure is maintained after the switch. The CHMP also noted that black patients may 
require a higher dose to achieve the targeted trough levels (as reflected in the product information). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most commonly reported AEs (reported for at least 5% of patients) were as follows: Diarrhoea, 
UTI, blood creatinine increased and nausea are the most common AEs reported for patients in Phase 
2/ 3 clinical kidney transplant studies.  No large differences can be observed for LCP-Tacro and 
Prograf groups. The majority of AEs were mild or moderate and no major differences were observed 
between LCP-Tacro and Prograf groups. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Medication errors, including inadvertent, unintentional or unsupervised substitution of immediate- 
or prolonged-release tacrolimus formulations, have been observed with tacrolimus-containing 
products. This has led to serious adverse reactions, including graft rejection, or other adverse 
reactions which could be a consequence of either under- or over-exposure to tacrolimus. Patients 
should be maintained on a single formulation of tacrolimus with the corresponding daily dosing 
regimen; alterations in formulation or regimen should only take place under the close supervision of 
a transplant specialist. The educational materials described in the RMP states that patients should 
be maintained on a single formulation of tacrolimus with the corresponding dosing regimen. If 
alterations in formulation or regimen are clinically indicated, this should only take place under the 
close supervision of the clinical specialist, as close monitoring of tacrolimus levels is required. 
As requested by the CHMP the applicant will also ensure that, prior to launch, all health 
professionals who are expected to prescribe/dispense LCP-Tacro are provided with Educational 
materials highlighting the authorised indications, the need for prescribing and dispensing with 
attention to pharmaceutical form (prolonged release) and posology (once daily administration); the 
importance of avoiding inadvertent switching between tacrolimus containing products and the risk 
of under and overdosing if monitoring is inadequate; the clinical risks associated with over- and 
under-dosing. These risk minimisation activities are described in the RMP and the product 
information.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The benefits of Envarsus in the prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult kidney or liver allograft 
recipients and the treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other 
immunosuppressive medicinal products in adult patients have been adequately demonstrated in the 
clinical programme. 
CHMP assessment report 
Envarsus 
EMA/CHMP/81205/2014 
Page 110/118 
 
  
The safety profile of Envarsus is in line with the other tacrolimus formulations. 
The benefit risk balance in the proposed indication is considered positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The results from pivotal study 3001 showed that in de stable kidney transplanted patients 
LCP-Tacro is non-inferior to the clinical comparator Prograf. The results from pivotal study 3002 
showed that in de novo kidney transplanted patients LCP-Tacro is non-inferior to Prograf. The 
applicant has also substantiated the extrapolation of the PK data available with LCP-Tacro in the de 
novo kidney patients and in the liver and transplantation setting (including rescue indication) with 
data as well as discussion establishing efficacy of LCP-Tacro in de novo kidney and liver indications. 
Based on the outcomes of the clinical Phase 2 and 3 development programme on LCP-Tacro tablets 
for the prevention of kidney or liver allograft rejection, it can be concluded that LCP-Tacro tablets, 
as Prograf capsules b.i.d. and Advagraf capsules q.d. are also safe and efficacious in a solid organ 
rejection rescue medication setting. In accordance with the approved tacrolimus products Prograf 
capsules b.i.d. and Advagraf capsules q.d., this supports the therapeutic indication for LCP-Tacro 
tablets q.d. in the treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other 
immunosuppressive medicinal products in adult patients”.  
There are no significant differences between LCP-Tacro and Prograf with respect to the AE profile. 
This information brings no new essential signals with tacrolimus. All SAEs listed are known AEs for 
tacrolimus. The applicant has discussed the safety results observed in the Phase I trials where the 
number of patients who experienced adverse events resulting in discontinuation from study drug 
and/or withdrawal from the study were similar in the treatment groups (approximately 12.3%). 
Therefore the results obtained indicate that discontinuations due to adverse events in kidney 
transplant recipients treated with tacrolimus from either LCP-Tacro tablets q.d. or Prograf capsules 
b.i.d. do not differ between treatments. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Envarsus for the prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult kidney 
or liver allograft recipients and the treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other 
immunosuppressive medicinal products in adult patients is favourable and therefore recommends 
the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
About the product 
Icatibant, the active substance in Firazyr, is a selective competitive antagonist of the bradykinin type 2 
(B2)  receptor.  In  hereditary  angioedema  (HAE),  increased  bradykinin  concentrations  are  the  key 
mediator  in  the  development  of  the  clinical  symptoms.  Icatibant  was  shown  to  be  a  competitive 
antagonist of bradykinin and to help symptoms to resolve during acute HAE attacks. 
Firazyr  was  granted  a  Marketing  Authorisation  in  the  EU  on  11  July  2008.  It  is  indicated  for  the 
treatment of acute attacks of HAE in adults. Its approval was supported by clinical data from two Phase 
III studies: studies FAST-1 (JE049#2103) and FAST-2 (JE049#2102), which were randomised, double-
blind, controlled studies and had identical designs except for the comparator (one with oral tranexamic 
acid as the comparator and the other placebo controlled). 
Problem statement 
The  MAH  submitted  a  grouping  of  two  type  II  variations  according  to  Article  7.2  (b)  of  Commission 
Regulation  (EC)  No  1234/2008  for  the  medicinal  product  Firazyr  (icatibant).  The  purpose  of  the  first 
type  II  variation  was  to  extend  the  indication  for  Firazyr  (icatibant)  in  the  treatment  of  ACE-inhibitor 
induced angioedema.  
Furthermore,  the  purpose  of  the  second  type  II  variation  was  to  update  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  to 
include the results of the open-label extension phase of study FAST-3 (HGT-FIR-054). 
The  new  ACE-inhibitor  induced  angioedema  indication  is  supported  by  the  AMACE  study,  published 
literatures in ACE-I induced angioedema, the Phase III clinical studies (known as the FAST 1-3 studies) 
and post-marketing information in hereditary angioedema (HAE) subjects. The results from the AMACE 
trial  are  supported  by  the  3  FAST  studies  (FAST-1,  FAST-2  and  FAST-3)  and  by  the  open  label 
extension phase of study FAST-3 (HGT-FIR-054). The final data for FAST-1 (JE049-2103-D) and FAST-
2 (JE049-2102-D) have already been submitted and assessed as part of Firazyr FUM 027 and variation 
II/06. The interim data for FAST-3 (HGT-FIR-054) reflects data from the controlled phase only, up to 
the 1st of October 2010 cut-off date. This data has also already been submitted and assessed as part of 
variation II/015.

The update of section 5.1 of the SmPC is supported by the results of the recently completed open-label 
extension phase of the FAST-3 study. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.3.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of SC administered icatibant has been thoroughly characterized in healthy 
subjects  and  in  patients  with  HAE.  A  PK  analysis  was  not  conducted  in  patients  during  the  AMACE 
study. There is no indication from existing data or physiologically-based expectation that the PK of SC 
icatibant  overall  would  differ  significantly  between  healthy  subjects,  HAE  patients  or  ACE-I-induced 
angioedema patients.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacodynamics  
Pathophysiology of the disease 
The pathophysiology of angioedema resulting from ACE inhibitor use resembles that of HAE due to C1 
inhibitor  deficiency,  in  that  it  is  mainly  mediated  by  bradykinin-induced  activation  of  vascular 
bradykinin  B2  receptors.  Bradykinin  is  a  potent  vasodilator  and  increases  vascular  permeability, 
leading  to  rapid  accumulation  of  fluid  in  the  interstitial  tissues.  ACE  inhibitors  block  angiotensin-
converting  enzyme,  the  main  bradykinin-inactivating  peptidase in  humans  along  with  aminopeptidase 
P,  reducing  the  catabolism  of  bradykinin.  There  is  experimental  evidence  that  ACE  inhibitors  induce 
angioedema by increasing the availability of bradykinin. There may also be an endogenous anomaly in 
the  degradation  of  bradykinin  in  patients  with  ACE-I-induced  angioedema,  further  suggesting  that  its 
pathophysiologic  mechanism  lies  in  the  catabolic  side  of  kinin  metabolism.  Additionally,  with  ACE 
inhibitor  administration,  aminopeptidase  P  becomes  the  primary  enzyme  responsible  for  inactivating 
bradykinin.  Individuals  with  low  plasma  concentrations  of  aminopeptidase  P  also  appear  to  be 
predisposed to developing angioedema in association with ACE inhibitor therapy. 
ACE-I-induced angioedema is not caused by an allergic or parallergic mechanism and while bradykinin 
plays  a  critical  role,  complement  protein  concentrations  and  C1  inhibitor  function  are  normal  in  the 
case  of  ACE-I-induced  angioedema.  This  is  in  contrast  to  other  forms  of  angioedema,  most  notably 
HAE,  resulting  from  mechanisms  that  alter  bradykinin  production.  In  HAE,  the  lack  of  C1  inhibitor 
results  in  excessive  activation  of  complement  as  well  as  of  the  contact  system  (including  factor  XII, 
plasmin,  and  to  a  lesser  degree  factor  XI).  Activation  of  kallikrein  follows  resulting  in  the 
overproduction of bradykinin. Thus, it is the overproduction of bradykinin in HAE and not the reduced 
degradation of bradykinin as in ACE-I-induced angioedema, which causes the  angioedema in patients 
with  HAE.  Due  to  this  difference,  treatment  with  purified  C1  inhibitor,  although  effective  in  treating 
HAE, is unlikely to be effective in reversing or preventing the angioedema associated with ACE inhibitor 
as levels of C1 inhibitor are normal. Treatments including recombinant human C1 INH and recombinant 
human  plasma  kallikrein  inhibitor  (i.e.  ecallantide)  that  have  been  shown  to  be  effective  at  treating 
HAE may also be effective at treating ACE-I-induced angioedema. Some case reports have shown  C1 
INH concentrate to be efficacious in ACEI-induced angioedema.

Mechanism of action 
Icatibant is a selective competitive antagonist of the bradykinin type 2 (B2) receptor. It is a synthetic 
decapeptide with a structure similar to bradykinin, but with 5 non-proteinogenic amino acids. 
As summarised above, the pathophysiology of ACE-I-induced angioedema is most likely decreased due 
to  degradation  of  bradykinin  and  therefore, direct  antagonism  of  the  bradykinin  receptor  by  icatibant 
could be a relevant therapeutic approach.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
It is agreed by the CHMP that it is not expected that PK parameters would differ between HAE patients 
or ACE-I-induced angioedema patients. 
No  pharmacodynamic  studies  have  been  performed.  Since  the  pathophysiology  of  ACE-I-induced 
angioedema  most  likely  is  based  on  decreased  degradation  of  bradykinin,  it  is  agreed  that  direct 
antagonism of the bradykinin receptor by icatibant could be a relevant therapeutic approach. 
The  rationale  for  not  conducting  additional  PK/PD  and  dose  finding  studies  has  been  reviewed by  the 
CHMP.  Despite  the  similarities  in  pathophysiology  of  angioedema  attacks  in  HAE  or  ACE-1  inhibitor 
induced  settings,  there  are  several  distinct  features  which  should  be  accounted  for  during  clinical 
evaluation.  
Firstly, the kinetics and levels of bradykinin can differ between HAE and ACE-1-angioedema. The MAH 
was  requested  during  the  evaluation  to  discuss  the  details  on  how  levels  of  bradykinin  vary  between 
these  groups  of  patients.  Limited  efforts  were  apparently  made  to  measure  bradykinin  levels 
consistently and this remains one of the lacunae of the trial and development programme. The issue of 
different  bradykinin  levels  and  pathophysiological  basis  for  the  differences  were  satisfactorily 
addressed by the MAH. There are challenges in measuring bradykinin levels but this would have been 
feasible  within  a  relatively  small  study  such  as  AMACE  trial  where  patients  are  confined  for  several 
days  in  the  hospital  and  investigators  are  familiar  with  treatment  and  laboratory  diagnosis  of 
angioedema.  The  MAH  was  requested  during  the  evaluation  to  justify  why  bradykinin  measurements 
were  not  carried  out.  It  is  understood  that  C1  inhibitor  (C1-INH)  and  complement  levels  are  not 
routinely performed in the ED for suspected cases of ACE-I-induced angioedema and it is agreed that 
the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  in  the  study  reflects  clinical  practice.  However,  in  a  clinical  trial 
setting,  especially  considering  the  one  pivotal  trial  situation,  a  more  objective  diagnosis  would  have 
been adequate, even if the final diagnosis would have been achieved after treatment initiation. The fact 
that this was not performed constitutes a weakness of the study. However, the non-responsiveness of 
the control patients to conventional therapy in the  study may support that these patients indeed had 
bradykinin-mediated  angioedema.  The  MAH  made  some  efforts  to  discuss  the  issues  relating  to 
inclusion/  exclusion  criteria    and  used  clinical  guidelines  for  emergency  treatment  of  suspected 
angioedema as a guide to include ACE-I induced angioedema. While this approach is seemingly logical  
in  the  context  of  emergency  treatment,  it  introduces  certain  difficulties;  one  availability  of  history  of 
previous  attacks,  patient's  ability  to  detail  all  the  relevant  points  and  thus  arrive  at  a    diagnosis  of 
exclusion.  
Secondly, ACE-1-angioedema cases should be well defined not only on the premise of medical history 
of taking ACE-1 inhibitor but also using panel of tests such as C1 inhibitor, complement levels and IgE. 
Levels of these biomarkers are not expected to be considerably affected in ACE-1 angioedema. It was 
noted  that  one  of  the  study  investigators  Dr  Bas  has  published  on  the  role  of  bradykinin  genetic 
polymorphisms  and  potential  correlation  between  low  levels  of  serum  ACE  and  ACE-I-induced 
angioedema. However it is unclear why no attempt was made by the same investigator to carry out the 
Firazyr 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/57346/2014  
Page 7/44 
 
 
analysis  of  these  biomarkers.  Namely,  the  ACE  levels  were  determined  but  no  formal  discussion  or 
analysis  of  the  data  were  included  in  the  report.  Thirdly,  following  the  most  commonly  employed 
algorithm  of  management  in  emergency  settings  and  namely,  the  diagnosis  of  exclusion,  ACE-1 
angioedema  episodes  might  be  more  protracted  and  often  may  resolve  themselves.  The  MAH  did  not 
provide the discussion on the pattern of angioedema attacks in HAE and ACE-1 induced circumstances 
and how the duration and / or recurrence in symptoms timely relate to the half-life of icatibant in order 
to justify the same posology as for HAE. For instance, the current posology suggests that 3 doses are 
rarely  required  and  not  more  than  8  doses  were  employed  in  the  HAE  studies.  Hence  the  MAH  was 
requested during the evaluation to discuss the relevance of this posology to the clinical pattern of ACE-
1  angioedema  attacks  (as  per  reliable  epidemiological  data)  and  what  is  the  likely  number  of  doses 
that  will  be  required  (as  justified  by  AMACE  data).  There  is  limited  data  to  support  either  the  same 
posology as in HAE or a different posology. Based on the small dataset available, it seems logical and 
pragmatic to use the same posology as in HAE in the absence of any signal of lack of effectiveness.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Introduction  
The  new  ACE-I  indication  is  supported  by  the  AMACE  study,  published  literatures  in  ACE-I  induced 
angioedema and the Phase III clinical studies in HAE (FAST 1-3 studies). 
GCP 
The  clinical  trials  were  performed  in  accordance  with  GCP  as  claimed  by  the  MAH.  The  MAH  has 
provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out 
in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
Since  the  new  indication  is  supported  by  a  single  pivotal  study  and  taking  into  account  the  relatively 
small size of the AMACE study and noted deviations in its conduct, both a study-specific GCP inspection 
of the main site and of the sponsor was requested. Namely, the following observations were made: 
• 
• 
• 
In at least 4 subjects the evaluation of patients was carried out by unblinded investigators. It is 
of concern how the double-dummy design and masking of efficacy evaluations were maintained 
at each site and how the unblinding compromised overall results. 
The fact that 4 subjects from the control group were lost for follow-up in such a small study is 
of  concern.  Specifically,  3  subjects  out  of  4  recruited  into  the  control  group  at  site  1  (site  1) 
were lost for follow-up. 
The study database was altered with some additional data entries after the official date of the 
data-lock  and  therefore  the  sponsor’s  site  needed  to  be  inspected  and  the  impact  of  these 
changes on the credibility of study findings should be verified. 
A request for GCP inspection was adopted for the AMACE clinical study by the CHMP. 
Outcome of the GCP inspection 
The AMACE trial was planned as an investigator initiated trial, which was financially supported by Shire 
Deutschland  GmbH.  The  trial  conduct  was  delegated  from  the  sponsor,  the  Technical  University  of 
München,  to  the  Coordinating  Investigator  (Leiter  der  klinischen  Prüfung,  LKP).  He  in  turn  delegated 
most  of  the  sponsor  functions  to  two  institutes  belonging  to  the  Technical  University  of  München. 
According to the trial staff, the trial was classified by the sponsor as ‘low priority trial'. After the clinical 
conduct was finished and the decision was made that the trial data will be used by Shire Deutschland 
Firazyr 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/57346/2014  
Page 8/44 
 
 
GmbH  to  extend  the  indication  for  Firazyr,  major  parts  of  data  management,  statistics  and  medical 
writing were outsourced to a CRO.  
The GCP inspection was performed at investigator site no. 1 (Coordinating Investigator) from 21 May 
until 24 May 2013, at the sponsor site (Techn. University München) from 3 June until 5 June 2013 and 
at the CRO from 5 June until 7 June 2013. 
The  involvement  of  Shire  Deutschland  GmbH  in  the  conduct  of  the  AMACE  trial  was  not  clear  to  the 
inspectors and was not adequately covered by the agreements available. During the three inspections 
performed  in  connection  with  the  trial  it  turned  out  that  Shire  Deutschland  GmbH  did  not  only 
financially  support  the  conduct  of  the  trial,  but  was  also  involved  in  the  preparation  of  the  statistical 
analyses  plan  (SAP),  gave  instructions  which  WHO  medical  dictionary  was  to  be  used  for  data 
management, provided the template for the clinical study report and contributed to the preparation of 
the clinical study report for the trial. 
Summary of Inspection Findings 
At the inspection of investigator site no. 1 there were 2 critical, 8 major and 5 minor findings. At the 
inspection  of  the  sponsor  of  the  trial,  Technical  University  München,  Medical  Faculty,  there  were  1 
critical, 9 major and 6 minor findings. At the inspection at the CRO, there were no critical, 1 major and 
11 minor findings. 
In relation to the observations (1.-3.), which were made by the CHMP and which are listed in the scope 
of the inspection request, the following was verified during the inspection:  
(1)  The  blinding  system  established  in  the  clinical  trial  protocol  and  implemented  at  the  inspected 
investigator site turned out to be not robust enough to ensure blinding of the investigators. 
(2) At investigator site no. 1, only 2 patients were actually lost to follow-up, for 1 patient the follow up 
visit was performed, but, by mistake, not entered in the Case Report Form.  
(3) It was verified at the CRO that there were no changes to the database other than as described for 
the database unlock in the Clinical Study Report. 
In relation to all findings at the GCP inspection the inspectors concluded the below. 
Given the critical and major findings, this casts substantial doubt on the reliability of the trial data. The 
main reasons for this are:  
- Firstly, it was not possible to reconstruct, which patient received which treatment at the investigator 
site inspected (documentation was missing and documentation which was available was contradictory). 
It  is  likely  that  a  reconstruction  of  drug  accountability  is  also  not  possible  at  the  other  investigator 
sites, because the same deficient instructions for documentation were given to all sites.  
- Secondly, the system of conduct of the trial implemented at the inspected investigator site was not 
robust  to  ensure  blinding  of  the  investigators  who  performed  the  primary  and  secondary  objective 
assessments. Actually, unblinding was very likely to occur due to the local side effects of icatibant and 
due to the insufficient preventive measures to keep the investigators blinded of the trial and as there is 
the  probability  that  the  same  system  was  used  at  the  other  investigator  sites,  because  it  was 
established in the protocol, it is likely that the entire trial is affected.  
- Finally, the results reported in the CSR for ‘Complete Oedema Restitution’ were not exclusively based 
on a systematic collection at specific time points (visits) as defined in the protocol, but also on ad hoc 
assessments between the visits. The reported results are therefore not correct. However, bias towards 
a  positive  result  for  icatibant  seems,  according  to  a  preliminary  evaluation  presented  by  the  CRO 
during the inspection, unlikely. The new evaluation using the predefined timepoints from the protocol 
Firazyr 
Assessment report

will be provided by the sponsor of the trial with a revised and amended clinical study report after the 
inspection for assessment. 
Evaluation by the Inspectors of the Response from the Investigator/Sponsor  
The responses of the inspectees and the sponsor of the trial to the inspection reports did not change 
the  grading  of  any  of  the  findings  of  the  three  inspection  reports.  They  did  also  not  change  the 
conclusions made in the three reports.  
2.4.2.  Dose response studies 
The pathophysiology and mechanism of action of HAE (currently approved indication) and ACE-inhibitor 
induced  angioedema  are  similar,  and  therefore,  the  currently  approved  dose  for  HAE  was  used  for 
investigation  of  efficacy  and  safety  of  Firazyr  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  ACE-induced 
angioedema. 
2.4.3.  Main studies 
2.4.3.1.  Extension of indication for the treatment of ACE inhibitor induced angioedema 
AMACE  study  (AMelioration  of  Angiotensin  Converting  Enzyme  Inhibitor  Induced 
Angioedema Study) 
Methods 
The  AMACE  study  was  a  multicentre,  two-armed,  double-blind,  randomised  phase  II  study  in  parallel 
group design for the assessment of the treatment concept of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedemas with 
icatibant. 
Study participants  
Patients  aged  between  18  and  95  years  with  an  acute  angioedema  attack  of  the  upper  air  and  food 
passageways  caused  by  ACE  inhibitors  (ACEI)  were  to  be  enrolled  into  this  study.  Patients  arrived  at 
the emergency room of the clinic with acute angioedema of the head and neck area. A prerequisite for 
recruiting  the  patient  was  concomitant  intake  of  an  ACEI.  The  diagnosis  was  based  on  the  patient's 
medical  history.  For  this,  other  differential  diagnostics  that  came  into  question  (allergy,  insect  bite, 
trauma, abscess, tumor, post-radiogenic or post-operative swellings, ranula, and other salivary gland 
processes)  were  excluded.  The  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  checked  and  the  patient  was 
randomized after obtaining their written informed consent.  
Main inclusion criteria 
•  Aged 18 and < 96 years 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Patients being treated with ACEI 
Patient with acute angioedema attack caused by ACEI 
Treatment administered within 10 hours after onset of the angioedema 
Patients  with  angioedema  of  the  head  and/or  neck  (face,  lips,  cheeks,  tongue,  soft 
palate/uvula, pharynx and larynx) 
•  Male participants and female participants not capable of bearing children or who use a method 
of contraception that is medically approved by the health authority of the respective country.

Treatments 
Subjects were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to one of the following treatment arms: 
•  Arm 1 (“Icatibant group”): Icatibant 30 mg sc 
•  Arm 2 (“cortisone group”): Solu-Decortin H (prednisolone)/Tavegil (clemastin) intravenous. 
If no improvement of the symptoms had occurred within 6 hours after the first administration of study 
treatment,  (irrespective  of  the  randomized  treatment  group),  a  second  "rescue"  administration  of  30 
mg  icatibant  dose  with  500  mg  Solu-Decortin  H  was  possible.  In  life-threatening  situations,  the 
treating  physician  could  implement  medicinal  and  invasive  treatment  measures  (i.e.  "rescue" 
procedures). 
The in-patient monitoring phase of the study lasted for at least 18 to 24 hours after administration of 
study medication, with all patients presenting themselves at the clinic 14 days (+/- 2 days) after end 
of treatment for re-examination.

Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  the  subcutaneously-administered  bradykinin  B2-
receptor  antagonist  icatibant  in  comparison  to  the  previous  standard  treatment  consisting  of 
intravenous  administration  of  500  mg  Solu-  Decortin  H  and  2  mg  Tavegil  in  ACE  inhibitor-induced 
angioedema of the upper air and food passageway. 
The secondary objectives were to assess the efficacy of the test treatment, icatibant, at different time 
intervals, and to investigate its safety profile. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint  was time to complete edema resolution (COR). 
At discharge, the time to COR was documented by the second investigator (trained ENT specialist) who 
was  blinded  with  regard  to  the  actual  treatment  allocation.  The  assessment  of  whether  a  COR  took 
place (documented as “yes/no” in the CRF) was to be made by the investigator based on the symptom 
score  (investigator  and  patient;  “Composite  investigator-assessed  symptom  score”  and  “Composite 
VAS  or  Patient  Perception  Scale  score”)  and  the  assessment  of  the  severity  of  the  angioedema 
(“Composite investigator-assessed angioedema score”). 
Based  on  the  time  of  COR  and  on  the  timing  of  the  first  study  drug  administration,  the  time  to  COR 
was calculated for each patient. 
Composite investigator-assessed symptom score 
Attack symptoms were evaluated by the investigator (swallowing disorder, voice changes, sensation of 
foreign  body,  shortness  of  breath,  pain,  sensation  of  pressure)  using  a  4  point  scale:  (0  =  no 
complaints,  1  =  mild  complaints,  2  =  moderate  complaints,  3  =  severe  complaints).  The  composite 
symptom score was calculated as the average of these 6 symptom scores. 
Laryngeal Severity Scores 
Firazyr 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/57346/2014  
Page 12/44 
 
 
 
No standard scale for measurement of edema exists in the literature. The principal investigator of the 
AMACE study developed severity measurements, using an ascending 5-point scale (0 = no symptoms, 
1 = mild symptoms, 2 = moderate symptoms, 3 = severe symptoms and 4 = very severe symptoms), 
which were followed during the study.  
Composite investigator-assessed angioedema score 
The  investigator  assessed  severity  of  the  angioedema  at  selected  locations  (lips  and  cheeks,  tongue, 
oropharynx, and hypopharynx/larynx), using a 5-point scale: (0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild symptoms, 
2  =  moderate  symptoms,  3  =  severe  symptoms  and  4  =  very  severe  symptoms).  The  composite 
angioedema score was calculated as the average of these 4 symptom scores. 
Composite VAS (or Patient Perception Scale) score 
Each  subject  assessed  the  intensity  of  symptoms  (pain,  shortness  of  breath,  dysphagia,  change  in 
voice, foreign body sensation, and feeling of pressure) at pre-treatment and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 
24, and 48 hours post-treatment using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Due to printing problems, the VAS 
scale  in  the  subject  questionnaire  is  not  10  cm  long,  which  means  that  the  raw  VAS  data  needed 
rescaling before analysis. To ensure comparability, all raw VAS measurements were thus divided by a 
factor  determined  by  data  management  before  analysis  and  prior  to  database  lock.  Composite  VAS 
scores were calculated as the average of VAS measurements for these 6 symptoms.

Sample size 
A total of 30 patients (15 patients per treatment arm) in 4 centers were planned for enrolment into the 
study.  Of  the  30  subjects  enrolled  in  the  study,  3  subjects  were  not  randomized  and,  therefore  by 
definition,  were  excluded  from  the  ITT  population  which  consequently  consisted  of  27  subjects.  
Because  2  patients  in  the ITT  population  did  not  re-consent  to  have  their  individual  data  be  used  for 
submission, a total of 25 subjects were included in the r-ITT population. 
Randomisation 
Randomization was performed online and was completed once the patient signed the informed consent 
form to participate in the study. Randomization applied no dynamic allocation of treatment. 
Randomization lists were generated beforehand by the statistics department of the Sponsor according 
to existing standard operating procedures using the  randomization software Rancode Professional 3.6 
(idv-Datenanalyse  und  Versuchsplanung,  Krailling,  Germany;  www.idvgauting.com).  Randomization 
lists  were  stratified  by  centre  and  used  permuted  blocks  with  a  fixed  block  length  only  known  to  the 
study statistician and the random operator (the study protocol describes variable block length; this was 
not implemented) and then uploaded onto a secure server. 
The randomized allocation of a patient into one of the two treatment groups took place after enrolment 
of  the  patient  into  the  study  (fulfilment  of  inclusion  criteria  and  no  violation  of  the  exclusion  criteria, 
informed  consent  form  personally  signed  and  dated  by  the  patient)  through  an  online  randomization 
process.  The  Munich  study  site  then  received  a  recruitment  form  via  FAX  when  a  randomization 
occurred. 
Blinding (masking) 
To avoid identification of a patient’s treatment due to local injection site effects of icatibant (red skin, 
pain,  burning,  itchiness),  one  investigator  only  randomized  and  treated  the  patient.  A  second 
investigator  was  responsible  for  monitoring  the  patient,  to  assess  safety  and  efficacy  parameters  as 
required  by  the  study  protocol,  and  to  document  them  in  the  case  report  form  (CRF);  the  second 
investigator  was  blinded  with  regard  to  the  treatment,  i.e.  he  had  no  information  about  the 
randomization and the local injection-site effects.  
The  first  investigator  had  access  to  the  actual  treatment  of  each  randomized  patient  via  the  online 
randomization tool for 7 hours after each randomization. The "7-hour rule" was implemented because 
a "rescue" dose of treatment (30 mg icatibant dose with 500 mg Solu-Decortin H, irrespective of the 
randomized treatment group) was possible after assessment of the edema at 6 hours after the initial 
treatment.  Since  the  two  treatment  arms  had  different  forms  of  administration,  for  the  purpose  of 
patient blinding, patients in the icatibant group received placebo treatment intravenously and patients 
in the Solu-Decortin H / Tavegil group received placebo via subcutaneous injection.

Statistical methods 
The  statistical  analysis  was  performed  twice  for  the  following  reason:  Only  after  all  patients  were 
enrolled  and  had  been  treated  in  the  study  it  was  considered  to  transfer  and  submit  study  results  to 
regulatory  agencies.  A  second  informed  consent  was  to  be  obtained  from  each  patient  that  explicitly 
allowed the use of data for submission purposes. However, for 2 patients this re-consent could not be 
obtained.  
Efficacy analyses using the ITT population considered patients as belonging to the treatment group to 
which they were randomised, regardless of the treatment actually received. For analyses using the as-
treated  (AT)  population  and  for  analyses  using  the  per-protocol  population,  however,  patients  were 
analysed  according  to  the  treatment  actually  received;  in  the  case  of  the  AT  population,  which  could 
include  patients  in  the  control  arm  who  subsequently  received  icatibant  as  a  rescue  medication, 
patients were analysed according to the first treatment received. The datasets of re-consented patients 
were named as r-AT and r-ITT.  
To  assess  the  impact  of  baseline  attack  severity  and  age  on  the  primary  endpoint,  time  to  COR  was 
analysed  using  a  Cox  proportional  hazards  model  which  included  covariates  for  treatment  and  either 
baseline  severity  of  the  attack  or  age  group.  No  imputation  strategy  was  employed  for  subjects  that 
required  rescue  therapy,  instead  the  time  to  COR  as  observed  was  used.  Because  all  subjects 
eventually  achieved  COR,  no  subject  was  censored.  The  hazard  ratio  (icatibant  vs.  control), 
corresponding 95% confidence interval and p-value assessing differences in the time to COR between 
the  treatment  groups  for  the  r-ITT  population  was  presented.  In  addition,  the  p-value  from  the 
stratified Peto-Peto Wilcoxon test was presented. 
Since  a  skewed  distribution  of  time  until  complete  oedema  restitution  is  to  be  expected,  the 
comparison  between  intervention  and  control  groups  was  done  using  the  Mann-Whitney-U  Test.  For 
the  calculation  of  sample  size  of  this  non-parametric  test  the  area  under  the  ROC-Curve  (receiver-
operating-characteristic  curve):  a  quantitative  parameter  (time  till  the  complete  oedema  restitution) 
vs.  treatment  group  affiliation  can  be  drawn  on  as  a  measurement  of  effect.  This  area  can  be 
interpreted as probability of observing a smaller value in one of the two groups when compared to the 
other (P(X<Y)). As there were disjointed distributions with regard to oedema restitution times between 
icatibant-treated and cortisone/clemastine-treated patients in the off-label administration observations, 
this probability can be set with P(X<Y) = 0.90 so that 11 patients per group will be required to prove 
the  distribution  differences  to  be  expected  with  a  power  of  90%  to  a  two-sided  significance  level  of 
5%. 
Baseline Attack Severity 
Subjects  were  classified  into  two  groups  based  on  their  baseline  attack  severity.  Two  measures  of 
attack severity were considered; one based on the composite investigator-assessed symptom score at 
pre-treatment and the other based on the composite VAS score at pre-treatment. 
Classification groups were created based on the median value at pre-treatment for each measure.  
Composite investigator-assessed symptom score: 
•  0 to 1 
•  >1. 
Composite VAS score: 
•  0 to 2 cm 
•  >2 cm.

Age Group 
Subjects were classified into two groups based on their age at baseline. 
•  18-65 years 
•  >65 years. 
Time to Onset of Symptom Relief for Individual Symptoms 
Each subject assessed the intensity of attack symptoms (pain, shortness of breath, dysphagia, change 
in voice, foreign body sensation, and feeling of pressure) using a VAS. Additionally, attack symptoms 
were  evaluated  by  the  investigator  (swallowing  disorder,  voice  changes,  sensation  of  foreign  body, 
shortness  of  breath,  pain,  sensation  of  pressure)  using  a  4  point  scale:  0  =  no  complaints,  1  =  mild 
complaints,  2  =  moderate  complaints,  3  =  severe  complaints.  Time  to  onset  of  symptom  relief  for 
individual  symptoms  was  calculated  from  the  time  of  study  drug  administration  to  the  onset  of 
symptom  relief.  Symptom  relief  was  determined  retrospectively  as  the  earliest  of  three  consecutive 
non-missing measurements in which there is at least a 50% reduction in the individual pre-treatment 
score. Subjects that did not achieve symptom relief were censored at the time of their last assessment. 
The  median  time  to  onset  of  symptom  relief  for  individual  symptoms  was  estimated  by  treatment 
group for the r-ITT population using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
The following changes in the conduct of the study were performed: 
-  The  statistical  analysis  was  performed  twice  for  the  following  reason:  Only  after  all  patients  were 
enrolled  and  had  been  treated  in  the  study  was  it  considered  to  transfer  and  submit  study  results  to 
regulatory  agencies.  A  second  informed  consent  was  to  be  obtained  from  each  patient  that  explicitly 
allowed the use of data for submission purposes (re-consent). However, for 2 patients this re-consent 
could not be obtained.  
-  The  study  database  was  locked  on  31-Jul-2012  and  unblinding  took  place  on  the  same  day.  The 
study  database  was  unlocked  on  2-Aug-2012  in  order  to  correct  an  erroneously  entered  value  for  a 
patient: In the comment field on the adverse event page the date of tracheostomy in local anesthesia 
was changed from 28-Oct-2012 to 08-Oct-2010. No further data were changed and the database was 
locked again on 2-Aug-2012. 
The following deviations from the analysis as planned in the protocol were performed: 
-  The  proportion  of  patients  with  complete  oedema  restitution  4  hours  after  treatment  was  added  to 
the  list  of  secondary  endpoints.  No  additional  data  was  needed  in  order  to  analyse  this  endpoint. 
Further efficacy analyses were performed using the VAS and symptom score measures at the 4 hours 
after  treatment  time  point,  and  achievement  of  COR  was  also  analysed  at  the  4  hour  post-treatment 
time point. These analyses were not specified in the original protocol, but were documented in the final 
version of the SAP prior to the unblinding of study results. 
-  The  statistical  analysis  was  performed  twice  for  the  following  reason:  Only  after  all  patients  were 
enrolled  and  had  been  treated  in  the  study  it  was  considered  to  transfer  and  submit  study  results  to 
regulatory  agencies.  A  second  informed  consent  was  to  be  obtained  from  each  patient  that  explicitly 
allowed  the  use  of  data  for  regulatory  submissions  (re-consent).  However,  for  2  patients  this  re-
consent  could  not  be  obtained.  Patient  listings  are  therefore  provided  twice,  once  containing  all 
patients for non-submission purposes and once excluding those patients with missing re-consent. The 
statistical analysis was also performed twice: once containing all patients and once excluding those 2 
patients with missing second informed consent. The submitted report refers mainly to all patients who 
received study medication regardless of whether the re-consent could be obtained.

-  In  addition  to  the  ITT  and  PP  analysis  populations  the  AT  (“as  treated”)  population  was  included  in 
the SAP. The AT population is essentially a new name for the safety population and was used for safety 
and efficacy analyses. 
- Due to the fact that 2 patients did not provide a second informed consent, so called “re-consented” 
analysis populations were defined, excluding these 2 patients: r-ITT, r-PP, r-AT. 
Results  
Participant flow  
In the ITT population, 4 subjects, all in the control group, discontinued the study. All 4 subjects were 
lost to follow-up. These patients received complete treatment and were discharged from hospital with 
COR  but  did  not  perform  the  last  visit  that  was  scheduled  14  days  after  the  admission  to  hospital.  
Similarly, in the r-ITT population, 3 subjects, all in the control group, discontinued the study; all were 
lost to follow-up.

Approximately  one-third  of  patients  in  both  groups  experienced  a  prior  history  of  angioedema. 
Although subjects with urticaria and previous angioedema prior to taking ACE inhibitors were excluded 
from the study, these subjects were permitted to be enrolled in the study because the angioedema was 
reported while subjects were receiving ACE inhibitors. 
A total of 3 patients in the icatibant group and 4 in the control group had various allergies to drugs and 
animals.  In  both  groups,  the  most  common  medical  history  was  hypertension,  in  14/15  (93.3%) 
patients. For concomitant medications, see the table below.

Baseline  severity  of  ACE-I-induced  angioedema  was  assessed  by  the  composite  symptom  score, 
composite  angioedema  score,  composite  VAS  score  and  individual  VAS  score  for  the  ITT  and  r-ITT 
populations. The severity of angioedema at baseline was comparable across the two treatment groups 
by  the  composite  symptom  score,  the  composite  angioedema  score  and  the  composite  VAS  Score. 
Based on the composite symptom score, attacks tended to be mild in nature (a score of 0 indicates no 
symptoms, while a score of 3 indicates severe symptoms).

The primary population for efficacy analyses was the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) subject population. The ITT 
population is defined as all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication. In 
the  ITT  population,  subjects  were  analysed  according  to  randomized  treatment.  The  ITT  population 
was used for all primary and secondary efficacy analyses.  
Two of the subjects enrolled in the study did not consent to provide individual data for submission for 
registration  in  this  trial.  These  subjects  were  excluded  from  the  ITT  population  to  form  the  re-
consented ITT (r-ITT) population. All analyses performed for the ITT population were repeated in the r-
ITT population.  
The  per-protocol  (PP)  population  consisted  of  all  patients  in  the  ITT  population  except  for  those  who 
received additional study medications or procedures due to edema worsening and patients with major 
protocol  violations.  Three  patients,  all  from  the  Control  group  received  additional  study  medication 
(rescue  medication)  and  were  therefore  excluded  from  the  PP.  The  PP  consisted  consequently  of  24 
patients; 13 patients were in the icatibant group and 11 patients in the Control group.

The  as-treated  (AT)  population  consisted  of  all  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study 
medication,  with  results  attributed  to  the  treatment  they  received  first.  Analysis  of  the  secondary 
safety endpoints were performed on the AT population. In addition, all primary and secondary efficacy 
analyses were repeated for the AT population as sensitivity analyses. 
The  AT  population  consisted  of  30  patients,  15  patients  in  the icatibant  group  and  15  patients  in  the 
Control group.

These results are based on an imputed time to COR for the 3 patients in the Control group who had a 
worsening of edema after the initial treatment with study medication and received a rescue treatment. 
No patient in the icatibant group received a second injection. As pre-defined for the primary analysis, 
the missing time to COR was replaced by the highest time to COR from the whole analysis population. 
For these patients, a time to COR of 61.2 hours was thus imputed, which was the highest time to COR 
that was observed for a patient in the Icatibant group. 
A more conservative approach was defined by imputing the time to COR using the highest time from 
the opposite treatment. In this study this approach led to exactly the same result.

In the ITT population all patients reached COR, therefore no patient was censored in the first Kaplan-
Meier analysis. The median time to onset of COR for the patients treated with icatibant was 8.0 hours 
(range: 2.8 - 61.2 hours) versus 27.1 hours (range: 11.3 - 61.2 hours), and the p-value was 0.0002

The  final  data  for  FAST-1  and  FAST-2  have  been  submitted  and  assessed  as  part  of  FUM  027  and 
variation  II/006.  The  interim  data  for  FAST-3  reflecting  data  from  controlled  phase  only,  up  to  1 
October  2010  cut-off  date  was  assessed  as  part  of  variation  II/015.  These  trials  were  performed  in 
subjects  with  Type  I  or  Type  II  HAE.  FAST-1  and  FAST-2  were  randomized,  double-blind,  controlled 
trials  and  had  identical  designs  except  for  the  comparator  (one  with  oral  tranexamic  acid  as  the 
comparator  and  one  placebo  controlled).  A  total  of  130 patients  were  randomized  to  receive  either  a 
30 mg  dose  of  icatibant  (63 patients)  or  comparator  (either  tranexamic  acid,  -  38  or  placebo  - 
29 patients).  Patients  with  symptoms  of  laryngeal  angioedema  received  open  label  treatment  with 
icatibant.  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  time  to  onset  of  symptom  relief  using  a  visual 
analogue scale (VAS).  
FAST-3 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of 98 adult patients. Patients were 
randomized  to  receive  either  icatibant  30 mg  or  placebo  by  subcutaneous  injection.  The  primary 
endpoint  was  time  to  onset  of  symptom  relief  assessed  using  a  3-item  composite  visual  analogue 
score. 
Methods 
Efficacy  data  from  laryngeal  HAE  attacks  from  these  studies  in  have  been  provided  based  on  the 
similar symptomatology of laryngeal HAE attacks compared with ACE-I-induced angioedema. A dataset 
pooling  the  first  laryngeal  attacks  of  subjects  in  the  FAST  studies  has  been  created  to  support  the 
efficacy seen with icatibant in ACE-I-induced angioedema. 
Similar  to  the  AMACE  study,  investigator-assessed  symptom  scores  and  VAS  scores  were  used  to 
assess the severity of HAE; however different attack symptoms were assessed.

The  most  analogous  endpoint  in  the  FAST  studies  to  the  primary  endpoint  used  in  the  AMACE  study 
(time to COR after the administration of study medication) is the time from treatment administration to 
almost  complete  symptom  relief  (TACSR).    However,  the  TACSR  endpoint  was  based  on  the  Visual 
Analog  Scale  (VAS)  and  the  time  to  COR  endpoint  in  the  AMACE  study  was  based  on  direct  clinical 
observation by the ENT specialist. Almost complete symptom relief was determined retrospectively as 
the earliest of three consecutive non-missing measurements for which all VAS scores are less than 10 
mm.  
Study population 
The  laryngeal  treated  population  consisted  of  66  subjects  with  an  icatibant-treated  laryngeal  attack.  
The analyses focused on the subject’s first icatibant-treated laryngeal attack.  Fifty-five of 66 (83.3%) 
subjects  completed  assessments  to  Day  14,  with  the  remaining  11  subjects  having  missing  data  (1 
subject) or discontinuing (10 subjects) due to additional HAE attack (6 subjects), lost to follow up (1 
subject),  or  other  (3  subject).  Sixty-one  of  66  subjects  (94.2%)  were  treated  with  one  30  mg  SC 
icatibant  injection  each  for  this  laryngeal  attacks,  while  5  of  66  subjects  (7.6%)  received  a  second 
injection of icatibant. 
The median age was 38.5 years for the laryngeal treated population. Overall the majority (42 subjects, 
63.6%) of subjects were female.  Most subjects were white (57 subjects, 86.4%).  
Results 
The median time to almost complete symptom relief (TACSR) based on the subject-assessed VAS was 
6.4 hours.  Almost  complete  symptom  relief  was  achieved  by  24  of  the  27  subjects  (96%)  with 
evaluable  data  in  the  laryngeal  treated  population.  FAST  1  and  2  did  not  collect  VAS  scores  for 
laryngeal symptom and thus symptom relief could not be determined. 
 The median times to onset of symptom relief based on the composite investigator-assessed symptom 
score and the composite subject-assessed VAS score were 2.0 hours (based on 37 of 40 subjects with 
evaluable data). Most individual investigator-assessed symptom scores for laryngeal-related symptoms 
were  mild  or  absent  by  4  hours  after  treatment.  Individual  subject-assessed  VAS  scores  for  difficulty 
swallowing  and  voice  change  showed  similar  results  to  that  of  the  individual  symptoms  scores,  with 
symptoms decreasing rapidly over the first 5-6 hours of treatment.

Published Case Reports in ACE-I-Induced Angioedema 
• 
In a case series described in 2010 in the Annals of Emergency Medicine, Bas et al conducted a 
study  of  8  patients  with  ACE-I-induced  angioedema  who  presented  to  the  emergency 
department.  All  patients  had  an  acute  angioedema  attack  of  the  head  or  neck  (face,  lips, 
cheeks,  tongue,  soft  palate/uvula/  pharynx,  and  larynx)  of  less  than  10  hours’  duration,  and 
had previously received ACE inhibitor therapy of varying duration between 12 and 132 months. 
Each patient received a single SC injection of icatibant 30 mg, and the outcome was assessed 
by  the  time  to  first  improvement  of  symptoms,  complete  symptom  relief,  and  safety.  First 
symptom improvement after icatibant administration occurred at a mean time of 50.6 minutes 
(±  21  minutes)  and  complete  relief  of  symptoms  at  4.4  hours  (±  0.8  hours).  No  patient 
underwent  tracheal  intubation,  other  drug  treatment,  tracheotomy,  or  received  a  second 
icatibant injection. No adverse events were reported except for erythema at the injection site.  
• 
In  a  case  report  presented  at  the  European  Academy  of  Allergy  and  Clinical  Immunology 
Congress in 2011, Reksten described an episode of acute angioedema in a 72-year old woman, 
who  had  been  receiving  therapy  with  ramipril  for  5  years,  that  occurred  3  months  after  an 
increase  in  her  prescribed  dosage.  The  patient  awoke  with  severe  breathing  difficulties, 
dysphagia  and  severe  tongue  swelling,  and  was  admitted  to  the  hospital  with  severe 
oropharyngeal swelling. She showed little to no response to treatment with antihistamines and 
glucocorticoids.  ACE-I-induced  angioedema  was  suspected,  and  a  single  SC  injection  of 
icatibant  30  mg  was  administered  approximately  4.5  hours  after  the  initial  development  of 
angioedema  symptoms.  Within  30  minutes  of  icatibant  administration,  the  severe  tongue 
swelling had receded and the patient’s breathing had eased. Submandibular swelling persisted 
over the next few hours, but declined progressively and was barely present after 24 hours. No 
systemic  or  serious  adverse  reactions  were  observed,  and  no  injection  site  reactions  were 
recorded. The patient was able to return home after 48 hours.  
• 
In  an  abstract  presented  at  the  American  Academy  of  Allergy,  Asthma,  and  Immunology 
scientific meeting in 2011, Perez, et al. presented 2 cases of ACE-I induced angioedema, both 
caused  by  lisinopril.  One  patient  developed  angioedema  of  the  lower  lip,  tongue  and  uvula, 
accompanied  by  dysphagia  and  dysphonia.  She  did  not  respond  to  corticosteroid  and 
antihistamine  therapy,  and  her  condition  worsened  over  2  hours.  Icatibant  was  administered, 
and  angioedema  resolved  over  30  minutes.  The  second  patient  developed  lip,  tongue,  and 
uvular angioedema, and was found to have airway involvement by laryngoscopy. Icatibant was 
administered and the edema resolved within 2 hours. 
• 
In  2010,  Schmidt,  et  al  presented  a  case  report  in  the  Journal  of  the  American  Academy  of 
Dermatology  of  a  42-year-old  man  who  developed  angioedema  of  the  tongue  and  larynx, 
presumed  to  be  associated  with  treatment  with  fosinopril.  Angioedema  worsened  despite 
treatment with corticosteroids, antihistamines, and inhaled epinephrine. 30 mg of icatibant was 
administered and edema began to resolve within 15 minutes, averting the need for emergency 
tracheotomy. 
• 
In  another  case  report  by  Manders  et  al,  a  45-year-old  woman  was  presented  to  emergency 
department with progressive swelling of the tongue for several hours. Medication use consisted 
of  chlorthalidone,  metoprolol,  methotrexate,  omeprazole,  simvastatin,  and  lisinopril,  the  dose 
of  which  was  recently  raised  from  10  to  20  mg  daily.  Before  presentation,  she  had  already 
been repeatedly treated, without response, with adrenaline 0.5 mg intramuscularly (IM), DAF 
(Di-Adreson-F) 25 mg intravenously and clemastine 0.5 mg IM. After admission to emergency 
department,  subcutaneous  icatibant  30  mg  was  administered.  Within  a  few  minutes,  the

swelling of the tongue decreased and she was able to speak and articulate more clearly. There 
was no need for intubation. The total duration of hospital stay was two days.   
• 
Iling  et  al  reported  no  immediate  benefit  when  icatibant  was  administered  in  a  62-year  old 
male presenting with severe oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal oedema while on an ACE inhibitor. 
Icatibant outcome survey 
IOS is a MAH sponsored registry of patients taking commercially administered icatibant in 8 countries 
in  the  EU,  which  has  accumulated  data  from  457  subjects  since  2009.  While  this  is  intended  to  be  a 
registry of patients using icatibant for its approved used in HAE, it records “real world” use, and thus a 
small number of patients whose providers used icatibant “off-label” for other indication are included. 
IOS includes data for 3 patients (all from a single site in Denmark) with a diagnosis of ACE-I-induced 
angioedema, each of whom received treatment with a single SC injection of icatibant 30 mg after also 
having received rescue medications (antihistamines, corticosteroids, epinephrine).  
Two  of  the  patients,  a  71-year-old  female  and  a  57-year-old  male,  presented  with  acute  attacks  of 
ACE-I-induced  angioedema  characterized  by  severe  to  very  severe  tongue  involvement.  Treatment 
with  icatibant  produced  resolution  of  the  attacks  in  these  patients  within  2.0  and  7.0 hours, 
respectively.  The  third  patient,  a  79-year-old  female  with  very  severe  laryngeal  edema,  was  not 
treated with icatibant until 13.8 hours after the onset of symptoms and experienced resolution of the 
attack 23.2 hours after receiving a single icatibant injection of 30 mg. 
2.4.3.2.  Open-label extension phase of the FAST-3 study (HGT-FIR-054) 
FAST-3 study (HGT-FIR-054) 
FAST-3 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of 98 adult patients. Patients were 
randomized  to  receive  either  icatibant  30 mg  or  placebo  by  subcutaneous  injection.  The  primary 
endpoint  was  time  to  onset  of  symptom  relief  assessed  using  a  3-item  composite  visual  analogue 
score. 
The interim report for FAST 3 included data from 76 subjects treated with icatibant across 198 attacks 
of HAE in the completed blinded phase and the open label phase, which was ongoing at the time of the 
interim  data  cut-off. The  interim  data  for  FAST-3  reflecting  data  from  controlled  phase  only,  up  to  1 
October 2010 cut-off date was assessed as part of variation II/015 and information was included in the 
SmPC.  
The  final  FAST  3  report  incorporates the  complete  data  from  the  open-label  extension  phase from  88 
subjects treated with icatibant across 489 attacks of HAE.  Data not previously included in the interim 
report  consist  of  291  additional  icatibant  attacks,  originating  from  12  subjects  with  a  first-icatibant 
treated  attack,  42  subjects  with  additional  icatibant-treated  attacks  (ie,  subjects  were  previously 
reported in the interim report, but experienced additional attacks), and 6 subjects with a first icatibant-
treated laryngeal attack. 
Study Design 
This  was  a  phase  III  randomized  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  multicenter  study  of  icatibant  for 
Subcutaneous  Injection  in  Patients  with  Acute  Attacks  of  Hereditary  Angioedema.  The  primary 
objective was to  compare the efficacy of icatibant with placebo on the time to symptom relief using a 
composite  visual  analog  scale  (VAS)  during  moderate  to  very  severe  acute  cutaneous  and/or 
abdominal attacks in patients with type I or type II hereditary angioedema (HAE).

Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/57346/2014  
Page 27/44 
 
 
A total of 88 patients who had previously been screened and presented with moderate to very severe 
cutaneous  and/or  abdominal  symptoms  were  to  be  randomized  to  receive  a  single,  double-blind 
treatment of icatibant (30 mg) or placebo, with approximately equal numbers assigned to each study 
arm. Patients experiencing severe laryngeal attacks were to receive open-label icatibant.  
After  the  first  attack,  patients  could  continue  to  receive  open-label  icatibant  for  the  treatment  of 
subsequent attacks until such time as the study was discontinued by the sponsor or the investigational 
product became commercially available. There were 70 subjects with icatibant-treated second attacks, 
55 subjects with treated third attacks, 37 subjects with -treated fourth attacks, and 31 subjects with 
treated fifth attacks. 
Figure 3.  Disposition of Subjects 
Results open label extension phase 
The median time to onset of symptom relief based on the 3-symptom composite VAS score and time to 
onset  of  primary  symptom  relief  based  on  the  primary  VAS  score  were  consistent  across  the  first  5 
icatibant-treated attacks (range: 1.9 to 2.1 hours). 
There were 435 attacks treated in the open-label phase; of those, 19 attacks (4.4%) required a second 
icatibant injection and 1 attack (<1%) required a third icatibant. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  pathophysiology  of  ACE-I-induced  angioedema  is  most  likely  based  on  decreased  degradation  of 
bradykinin. Thus, the mechanism of action (direct antagonism of the bradykinin receptor) supports the 
theory that icatibant may be a relevant treatment of ACE-I-induced angioedema.

The pivotal trial for this new indication is the AMACE trial which was a multicenter, randomized, rater-
blinded,  double-dummy,  parallel-group,  two-arm,  comparative  Phase  II  study.  The  primary  objective 
was  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  the  subcutaneously-administered  bradykinin  B2-receptor  antagonist 
Icatibant  in  comparison  to  standard  treatment  consisting  of  intravenous  administration  of  500  mg 
Solu-  Decortin  H  and  2  mg  Tavegil  in  ACE  inhibitor-induced  angioedema  of  the  upper  air  and  food 
passageway. 
The same posology as currently approved for HAE indication was used in the study although it was not 
supported by data. However, based on the small dataset available, it seems logical and pragmatic to 
use the same posology as in HAE in the absence of any signal of lack of effectiveness. 
Patients aged between 18 and 95 years with an acute angioedema attack caused by ACEI presenting at 
the emergency ward  were to be enrolled into this study. A prerequisite for recruiting the patient was 
concomitant  intake  of  an  ACEI.  The  diagnosis  was  based  on  the  patient's  medical  history.  For  this, 
other  differential  diagnostics  that  came  into  question  (allergy,  insect  bite,  trauma,  abscess,  tumor, 
post-radiogenic or post-operative swellings, ranula, and other salivary gland processes) were excluded 
as assessed based on patient history.   
At study entry, no assessments of laboratory markers, e.g. measuring complement, IgE and bradykinin 
levels  were  performed.  It  is  accepted  that  these  evaluations  are  difficult  to  carry  out  routinely  but 
taking into account the fact that the study was carried out at centres specialised in treating patients, 
and acknowledging various up-to-date EU guidelines on diagnostic algorithms for angioedema, the lack 
of these evaluations in the study are considered as a drawback, albeit not pivotal for the interpretation 
of the results. 
The  patient  population  enrolled  into  the  AMACE  study,  as  originally  presented,  was  characterised  by 
relatively  mild-to-moderate  severity  of  symptoms  and  only  3  patients  (all  from  the  control  group) 
required rescue re-treatment and a single patient from control group required tracheotomy. However, 
the  fact  that  patients  who  participated  in  the  AMACE  study  were  those  who  were  severe  enough  to 
seek  medical  attention  for  their  ACE-I-induced  angioedema  attack  supports  that  they  represent  the 
population  who  would  be  considered  for  icatibant  treatment  in  the  emergency  department.  This  is 
further supported by the approach to examine the maximum severity score across all symptoms or all 
angioedema  locations.  In  this  analysis,  the  majority  of  patients  in  the  AMACE  study  (82.1%  by 
angioedema  scores  and  64%  to  82.1%  by  symptom  scores)  experienced  ACE-I-induced  angioedema 
attacks that were either moderate or severe in intensity. 
Primary (time to complete edema resolution) and secondary endpoints are in general acceptable. The 
primary endpoint was based on both investigator and patient assessments which seems reasonable. It 
is acknowledged that most likely no validated scores are available for this orphan condition. However, 
the  components  of  the  scores  are  rather  similar  to  scores  used  in  the  HAE-studies.  Further, 
investigations  were  performed  by  trained  ENT  specialists  and  examination  was  standardized  through 
training  at  an  Investigators  Meetings,  including  training  on  scales  for  rating  oropharyngeal  and 
laryngeal edema.  
The study was blinded using a double-dummy design. However, at least 4 subjects became unblinded 
due to “unavailability of the blinded study investigator”. In addition, the treatment administration was 
carried  out  by  unblinded  investigators  as  local  injection  reactions  are  well  recognised  with  icatibant. 
Still,  it  is  unclear  what  measures  were  in  place  in  order  to  prevent  interaction  between  blinded  and 
unblinded investigators as the evaluation overlapped in the first 7 hours at the same site. The MAH has 
conducted  additional  analyses  indicating  that  the  time  to  COR  in  both  patients  with  and  without 
injection  site  reactions  was  similar.  It  is  not  possible  to  rule  out  that  the  unblinding  has  biased  the 
results however it is accepted that the analyses provided give some reassurance and that it is unlikely 
Firazyr 
Assessment report

Page 29/44 
 
 
that  the  unblinding  has  introduced  a  substantial  bias.  However,  considering  the  overall  conclusion  of 
the GCP inspection, this is still a concern. 
4 subjects were lost to follow-up from the comparator group including 3 subjects from a single centre. 
It is of concern that the loss of patients occurred at a single site in such a small study. The dataset has 
been also affected by some patients being randomised but assigned in the icatibant group as opposed 
to the control arm. The MAH has provided further sensitivity analyses that show evidence of a 
treatment effect regardless of how these patients are treated in the analysis. The median time to COR 
in the icatibant group was 8.0 hours compared to 21.2 hours in the control group. The difference was 
statistically significant using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and is of clinical relevance. However, the 
range of time to COR was wide in the icatabant group, with a max of 61.2 hours (longer than the max 
time in the control group).  
There  were  2  “outliers”  in  the  icatibant  group  with  long  duration  until  COR.  However,  based  on  the 
narratives,  both  had  rapid  symptom  relief  after  treatment  and  only  minor  symptoms  remained. 
Demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  did  not  differ  between  those  with  COR  ≤  8  hours  versus 
those  with  COR  >  8  hours  after  treatment  with  icatibant.  No  major  differences  in  severity  of  attacks 
were detected.  
During  the  triggered  GCP  inspection,  it  was  found  that  the  results  reported  in  the  CSR  for  ‘Complete 
Oedema  Restitution’  were  not  exclusively  based  on  a  systematic  collection  at  specific  time  points 
(visits)  as  defined  in  the  protocol,  but  also  on  ad  hoc  assessments  between  the  visits.  The  MAH  has 
performed a sensitivity analysis which only used the scheduled times of the visits. In this analysis, the 
median time to COR in the icatibant group was 8.0 hours compared to 24 hours in the control group, 
i.e  very  similar  to  the  original  results.  However,  as  mentioned  above,  considering  the  overall 
conclusion of the GCP inspection, this is still a concern. 
Overall,  icatibant  provided  an  approximately  2.5-fold  greater  probability  that  the  oedema  would 
subside  quicker  than  when  using  control  treatments.  For  the  investigator-assessed  symptom  scores 
statistically  significant  differences  were  seen  for  all  symptoms  except  for  foreign  body  sensation  and 
sensation  of  pressure  but  the  duration  to  symptom  severity  reduction  was  numerically  better  with 
icatibant for all symptom components.  
The  MAH  has  performed  analyses  indicating  a  positive  concordance  between  the  investigator  and 
subject assessments of symptom severity. Further,  there were similar trends across the investigator- 
and subject-assessed scores for the individual symptoms.  It is recognized that treatment comparisons 
at  the  1,  2,  3,  4,  and  6  hour  assessments  are  statistically  significant  for  the  investigator-assessed 
symptom scores but not for the subject-assessed VAS scores.  However, considering the small sample 
size, statistical significance cannot be expected for all analyses. It is true that the effect size was larger 
in  the  investigator  assessed  outcomes,  but  considering  the  similar  trends  over  time  for  both 
investigator  and  patient  assessed  outcomes,  the  results  are  considered  as  supportive  of  an  effect  of 
icatibant. 
From a mechanistic point of view, results from patients with laryngeal HAE attacks may be considered 
as  supportive  for  the  proposed  indication  and  the  MAH  has  provided  pooled  data  from  the  FAST 
studies.  However,  the  endpoints  were  not  the  same  and  data  for  the  most  similar  endpoint  (time  to 
almost  complete  symptom  relief)  is  only  available  for  24  patients.  Even  if  the  median  time  is  similar 
(6.4 compared to 8.0 hours) the strength of the data is questionable. 
The MAH has identified 28 publications through a PubMed search. The majority of the publications have 
been  published  during  the  recent  years.  Five  of  the  publications  were  written  by  Dr  Bas  who  was 
involved in the AMACE study. Nine publications refers to case reports or case series while the rest are 
mainly  review  articles  covering  the  treatment  of  angiooedema  including  those  with  bradykinin

mediated ethiology. Concerning the case reports, all except one seems to be supportive of a beneficial 
effect  of  icatibant  in  the  treatment  of  ACE-I-induced  angioedema.  There  are  no  controlled  studies 
reported. 
Concerning the open label phase of the FAST 3 study, data not previously included in the interim report 
consist  of  291  additional  icatibant  attacks,  originating  from  12  subjects  with  a  first-icatibant  treated 
attack,  42  subjects  with  additional  icatibant-treated  attacks  (ie,  subjects  were  previously  reported  in 
the  interim  report,  but  experienced  additional  attacks),  and  6  subjects  with  a  first  icatibant-treated 
laryngeal attack. The proposed changes to section 5.1 of the SmPC are acceptable. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
In  summary,  whilst  there  is  good  clinical  and  pathophysiological  rationale  for  the  use  of  icatibant  in 
treatment  of  ACE-I-induced  angioedema,  and  the  results  of  the  AMACE  study  may  indicate  a  support 
for  this  rationale,  the  critical  and  major  findings  at  the  GCP  inspection  cast  substantial  doubt  on  the 
reliability  of  the  trial  data.  The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  robustness  of  the  results  needs  further 
justification and confirmation. The MAH therefore withdrew the extension of indication.  
Concerning the open label phase of the FAST 3 study, data not previously included in the interim report 
consist  of  291  additional  icatibant  attacks,  originating  from  12  subjects  with  a  first-icatibant  treated 
attack,  42  subjects  with  additional  icatibant-treated  attacks  (ie,  subjects  were  previously  reported  in 
the  interim  report,  but  experienced  additional  attacks),  and  6  subjects  with  a  first  icatibant-treated 
laryngeal attack. The proposed changes to section 5.1 of the SmPC are acceptable. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The new proposed indication is angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitor (ACE-I) -induced angioedema, 
for  which  this  type  II  variation  is  submitted.  The  MAH  refers  to  efficacy  and  safety  data  from  the 
AMACE study as well as the experience with icatibant in the treatment of HAE patients, a bradykinin-
mediated  condition.  The  HAE  data  presented  have  been  generated  from  three  controlled  Phase  III 
studies  (known  as  the  FAST  studies).  Published  case  reports  in  ACE-I-induced  angioedema  and  post-
marketing experience in HAE are also provided as supportive information. 
AMACE  is  a  multicenter,  two-armed,  double-blind,  randomised,  parallel  group  trial.  The  study 
evaluated  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  icatibant  compared  to  standard  of  care  (in  this  trial  defined  as 
corticosteroid  and  clemastine),  enrolling  30  patients  (15  patients  per  arm)  suffering  from  an  acute 
attack  of  ACE-I-induced  angioedema.  The  study  population  consisted  of  30  adult  subjects,  18  to  86 
years  of  age,  who  presented  with  an  ACE  inhibitor-induced  acute  angioedema  attack  of  the  head 
and/or  neck.  Eligible  subjects  were  enrolled  into  the  study  within  10  hours  of  an  attack  onset,  and 
randomised 1:1 to receive either SC administered icatibant (30 mg) or IV administered corticosteroid 
and clemastine as a control. The safely evaluation consisted of: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Evaluation of laboratory data (routine blood) 
Evaluation of vital signs 
Evaluation of adverse events 
Evaluation of necessity of additional medicines 
Evaluation of necessity of implementation of invasive procedures (intubation, tracheostomy).

Patient exposure 
In  the  AMACE  study,  30  subjects  were  recruited.  Three  subjects  were  never  randomised,  and  were 
excluded  from  the  ITT  population  (=27  subjects).  Further,  two  subjects  in  the  ITT  population  did  not 
follow  through  with  the  data  submission,  and  a  total  of  25  subjects  were  included  (reconsented-ITT 
population). 
As a result of the above, 12 subjects in the icatibant group required one injection, and three of the 13 
subjects  in  the  control  group  received  an  injection  of  icatibant  along  with  IV  cortisone  as  rescue 
therapy. Therefore, the total exposure for icatibant is 15 subjects. For the three subjects who received 
rescue therapy, it was administered within 6-6.9 hours after initial treatment. 
Adverse events 
In the AMACE study, 30 subjects were recruited. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events: 
In  the  as  treated  (AT)  population,  no  subjects  discontinued  from  the  AMACE  study  due  to  AEs; 
however, four subjects, all in the control group, were discontinued from the study because they were 
lost to follow-up. These subjects received complete treatment and were discharged from hospital with 
complete  oedema  restitution  but  did  not  perform  the  last  visit  that  was  scheduled  14  days  after 
admission to the hospital. 
In the AMACE study, six AEs were reported by five subjects, one of whom (subject 2) was not included 
in  the  re-consented population  (r-ITT).  One  subject  in  the  icatibant  group  reported  a  mild  AE  of  pain 
that was probably related to study drug. All other AEs occurred in subjects in the control group. One of 
these AEs (blood glucose increased) was considered by the investigator to be probably related to study 
medication, two AEs (COPD and fatigue) were considered to be unlikely related to study drug, and all 
other AEs were not related to study drug. There was one severe AE of dyspnoea, reported by a subject 
in the control group, all other AEs were mild.

Patient No. 1., in the Icatibant group, experienced mild pain on the day of first treatment application. 
This AE was considered as probably related to study medication. The patient was given an NSAID, the 
AE resolved and the patient recovered. 
Patient  No.  2.,  in  the  Control  group,  experienced  mild  chronic  obstructive  disease  one  day  after  the 
first  study  drug  administration.  This  AE  was  considered  as  unlikely  related  to  study  medication.  The 
patient was given cefuroxim; the AE resolved and the patient recovered. 
Patient No. 3., in the Control group, experienced a mild blood glucose increase one day after the first 
study drug administration. This AE was considered as probably related to study medication. No action 
was taken, the AE resolved and the patient recovered. 
Patient  No.  4.,  in  the  Control  group,  experienced  mild  fatigue  on  the  first  day  of  study  drug 
administration.  This  AE  was  considered  as  unlikely related  to  study  medication.  No  action  was  taken, 
the  AE  resolved  and  the  patient  recovered.  However,  this  patient  received  a  second  treatment 
application/rescue medication (i.e. icatibant and cortisone). 
Patient No. 5., in the Control group, experienced mild influenza-like illness 15 days after the first study 
drug administration. This AE was considered as not related to study medication. The patient was given 
cefuroxim; the AE resolved and the patient recovered with sequelae. This patient also experienced an 
SAE (dyspnoea). 
Injection Site Reactions: 
Injection  site  reactions  occurred  in  a  majority  of  subjects  in  the  icatibant  group,  including  redness 
(80%), swelling (53.3%), pain (46.7%), itching and burning (26.7% each). These symptoms resolved 
within  four  hours  of  dosing.  Fewer  subjects  in  the  control  group  reported  injection-site  reactions; 
however, those reported resolved within two hours of dosing. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
As  related  above,  there  was  one  subject  who  described  an  SAE:  (subject  No.  5),  dyspnoea:  The 
subject received rescue therapy with icatibant and IV cortisone six hours after initial treatment in the 
study,  and  had  a  tracheostomy  25  minutes  after  receiving  rescue  therapy.  COR  (complete  oedema 
restitution) was achieved 14 hours after the initial treatment. The SAE of dyspnoea was not considered 
related to the study medication. The subject completely recovered from the event. 
There were no reports of fatal cases. 
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory  data  (blood  count,  inflammation  parameter,  coagulation  parameters,  electrolytes,  liver 
parameters, renal parameters, other parameters) were collected at baseline, 12 hours post-treatment, 
and  14  hours  post-treatment.  ACE  activity  was  reported  as  U/l.  Actual  values  and  change  from  pre-
treatment were summarised by study time point and treatment group for the AT population.

Vital signs were generally normal for all subjects. In the icatibant group, a total of 3 subjects presented 
with  above-normal  systolic  blood  pressure;  one  patient  with  above-normal  temperature  and  three 
subjects with below normal temperature. In the control group, two subjects presented with above- and 
two with below- normal temperature.

There was a majority of males in the study (70% of the icatibant group and 60% in the control group). 
In  the  ITT  group  overall,  the  patients  in  the  control  group  were  older  than  those  in  the  treatment 
group.

Post marketing experience 
Supportive  post-marketing  information  on  icatibant  as  a  treatment  for  ACE-I-induced  angioedema  is 
provided in the following:  
• 
The Firazyr Risk Management Plan 
•  A comprehensive assessment of safety and efficacy of Firazyr in both clinical development and 
the post-marketing setting was submitted on 11 Jul 2012, as part of the EU 5-year renewal 
• 
• 
The Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 
The Icatibant Outcome Survey (IOS) 
•  Case reports from the published literature.  
Despite  the  rarity  of  HAE,  a  clinical  safety  dataset  was  created  to  establish  the  safety  of  icatibant. 
Based  on  the  marketing  data  the  estimated  patient  exposure  is  20,720  patient  exposures  for  the 
reporting period 12 July 2011 through 11 July 2012 and 33,841 patient exposures cumulatively. 
Three  reports  from  the  Icatibant  Outcome  Survey  (IOS)  concerning  reports  on  treating  ACEi  induced 
oedema with icatibant 
IOS is a MAH sponsored registry of patients taking commercially administered icatibant in 8 countries 
in  the  EU,  which  has  accumulated  data  from  457  subjects  since  2009.  While  this  is  intended  to  be  a 
registry of patients using icatibant for its approved used in HAE, it records “real world” use, and thus a 
small  number  of  patients  whose  providers  used  icatibant  “off-label”  for  other  indication  are  included. 
IOS  includes  data  for  three  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  ACE-I-induced  angioedema,  each  of  whom 
received  treatment  with  a  single  SC  injection  of  icatibant  30  mg  after  also  having  received  rescue 
medications (antihistamines, corticosteroids, epinephrine). 
Two  of  the  patients,  a  71-year-old  female  and  a  57-year-old  male,  presented  with  acute  attacks  of 
ACE-I-induced  angioedema  characterised  by  severe  to  very  severe  tongue  involvement.  Treatment 
with icatibant produced resolution of the attacks in these patients within 2 and 7 hours, respectively. 
The  third  patient,  a  79-year-old  female  with  very  severe  laryngeal  oedema  was  not  treated  with 
icatibant  until  13.8  hours  after  the  onset  of  symptoms  and  experienced  resolution  of  the  attack  23.2 
hours after receiving a single icatibant injection of 30 mg. 
Literature reports on treating ACEi induced oedema with icatibant 
In a case series described in 2010 in the Annals of Emergency Medicine, Bas et al conducted a study of 
eight  patients  with  ACE-I-induced  angioedema  who  presented  to  the  emergency  department.  All 
patients  had  an  acute  angioedema  attack  of  the  head  or  neck  (face,  lips,  cheeks,  tongue,  soft 
palate/uvula/ pharynx, and larynx) of less than ten  hours’ duration, and had previously received ACE 
inhibitor  therapy  of  varying  duration  between  12  and  132  months.  Each  patient  received  a  single  SC 
injection of icatibant 30 mg, and outcome was assessed by the time to first improvement of symptoms, 
complete  symptom  relief,  and  safety.  First  symptom  improvement  after  icatibant  administration 
occurred at a mean time of 50.6 minutes (± 21 minutes) and complete relief of symptoms at 4.4 hours

(±  0.8  hours).  No  patient  underwent  tracheal  intubation,  other  drug  treatment,  tracheotomy,  or 
received  a  second  icatibant  injection.  No  adverse  events  were  reported  except  for  erythema  at  the 
injection site. 
In a case report presented at the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical  Immunology Congress in 
2011,  Reksten  described  an  episode  of  acute  angioedema  in  a  72-year  old  woman,  who  had  been 
receiving  therapy  with  ramipril  for  five  years  that  occurred  three  months  after  an  increase  in  her 
prescribed dosage. The patient awoke with severe breathing difficulties, dysphagia and severe tongue 
swelling, and was admitted to the hospital with severe oropharyngeal swelling. She showed little to no 
response  to  treatment  with  antihistamines  and  glucocorticoids.  ACE-I-induced  angioedema  was 
suspected,  and  a  single  SC  injection  of  icatibant  30  mg  was  administered  approximately  4.5  hours 
after the initial development of angioedema symptoms. Within 30 minutes of icatibant administration, 
the severe tongue swelling had receded and the patient’s breathing had eased. Submandibular swelling 
persisted over the next few hours, but declined progressively and was barely present after 24 hours. 
No systemic or serious adverse reactions were observed, and no injection site reactions were recorded. 
The patient was able to return home after 48 hours. 
In  an  abstract  presented  at  the  American  Academy  of  Allergy,  Asthma,  and  Immunology  scientific 
meeting  in  2011,  Perez,  et  al.  presented  two  cases  of  ACE-I  induced  angioedema,  both  caused  by 
lisinopril.  One  patient  developed  angioedema  of  the  lower  lip,  tongue,  and  uvula,  accompanied  by 
dysphagia  and  dysphonia.  She  did  not  respond  to  corticosteroid  and  antihistamine  therapy,  and  her 
condition  worsened  over  two  hours.  Icatibant  was  administered,  and  angioedema  resolved  over  30 
minutes.  The  second  patient  developed  lip,  tongue,  and  uvular  angioedema,  and  was  found  to  have 
airway involvement by laryngoscopy. Icatibant was administered and the oedema resolved within two 
hours. 
In  2010,  Schmidt,  et  al  presented  a  case  report  in  the  Journal  of  the  American  Academy  of 
Dermatology of a 42-year-old man who developed angioedema of the tongue and larynx, presumed to 
be  associated  with  treatment  with  fosinopril.  Angioedema  worsened  despite  treatment  with 
corticosteroids,  antihistamines,  and  inhaled  epinephrine.  30  mg  of  icatibant  was  administered  and 
oedema began to resolve within 15 minutes, averting the need for emergency tracheotomy. 
In  another  case  report  by  Manders  et  al,  a  45-year-old  woman  was  presented  to  emergency 
department  with  progressive  swelling  of  the  tongue  for  several  hours.  Medication  use  consisted  of 
chlorthalidone,  metoprolol,  methotrexate,  omeprazole,  simvastatin,  and  lisinopril,  the  dose  of  which 
was  recently  raised  from  10  to  20  mg  daily.  Before  presentation,  she  had  already  been  repeatedly 
treated,  without  response,  with  adrenaline  0.5  mg  intramuscularly  (IM),  DAF  (Di-Adreson-F)  25  mg 
intravenously  and  clemastine  0.5  mg  IM.  After  admission  to  emergency  department,  subcutaneous 
icatibant 30 mg was administered. Within a few minutes, the swelling of the tongue decreased and she 
was able to speak and articulate more clearly. There was no need for intubation. The total duration of 
hospital stay was two days.  
In  another  patient  who  recently  presented  to  the  emergency  department  with  swollen  tongue  and 
gums  while  being  treated  with  fosinopril  (since  2009)  was  not  treated  with  icatibant  and  had  to  be 
admitted to the ICU for endotracheal intubation for 24 hours with a total hospital stay of four days.  
Iling  et  al  reported  no  immediate  benefit  when  icatibant  was  administered  in  a  62-year  old  male 
presenting with severe oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal oedema while on an ACE inhibitor, however the 
finding is inconclusive.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The MAH stated that subcutaneously administered icatibant 30 mg provides a clinically meaningful and 
statistically significant improvement in the time to the resolution of symptoms as demonstrated by the 
blinded randomised AMACE trial and the HAE Phase III clinical trials. This is agreed for the HAE phase 
III trials that also were the foundation for the present indication.  
The AMACE trial showed effect also in patients with ACEi-induced oedema, but the trial was small and 
as there was a limited number of patients included, making thorough assessment of safety difficult.  
There was  no different safety pattern, but also here it must be noted the small sample of patients in 
the study. No new safety data was retrieved in a recent renewal. Due to small sample size no subgroup 
analysis  was  meaningful.  In  the  laboratory  findings,  there  is  a  notable  difference  in  values  of  ACE 
activity, but again, the number of patients is small, making the assessment difficult. 
The AE of injection site reactions are well known in  the already approved indication, and from earlier 
studies.  Few  cases  are  serious,  and  the  majority  resolve  without  treatment.  It  is  an  identified  risk  in 
the RMP. 
Follow-up is important, although it is agreed that the exposure to these patients will be limited to one 
occasion, as the use of ACE inhibitors will be discontinued after an attack of angioedema. 
From the cases from the literature, nor from the IOS registry, no new safety information can be drawn. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of icatibant, when given under the indication of HAE, is established from trials, post-
marketing  reporting,  and  IOS  registry.  During  recent  PSURs  and  renewal  procedures,  no  new  safety 
concerns were identified, and the risk-benefit balance continued to be positive. The safety  findings in 
the AMACE study seem similar to previously shown profile, but the number of patients is very limited. 
If  approved,  patients  treated  under  the  new  indication  must  be  followed-up  rigorously,  and  e.g. 
registered in the IOS.

2.7.1.  PRAC advice 
The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan. 
PRAC Advice 
The  PRAC  considered  that  the  risk  management  system  version  5.1.1  could  be  acceptable  with 
revisions required as described in the attached PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report. 
In  the  most  recent  version  5.1.1  of  the  RMP,  the  introduction  section  and  section  2.2  have  been 
revised,  as  requested,  to  amend  the  IOS  protocol  to  monitor  also  the  safety  profile  of  ACE-I-induced 
angiooedema  patients.  However,  also  section  2.4  “Overview  of  study  protocols

The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
Following  the  withdrawal  of  the  variation  related  to  the  extension  of  indication  for  the  treatment  of 
ACE-inhibitor induced angioedema, RMP version 5.1.1 cannot be considered as approved. 
2.8.  Update of the Product information 
- Extension of the indication for the treatment of ACE-inhibitor induced angioedema  
The MAH initially proposed the update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.7, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and 
consequential changes to sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Package Leaflet. However following the withdrawal 
of this variation, these proposed changes are no longer pursued by the MAH. 
- Update to section 5.1 of the SmPC to include the results of the open-label extension phase of study 
FAST-3 (HGT-FIR-054) 
The  MAH  initially  proposed  the  following  changes  to  the  Product  Information  (new  text=  underlined, 
deleted text= strikethrough) to which the CHMP agreed:  
Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties of the SmPC 
Response was also consistent across repeated attacks in the controlled Phase III trials. A total 
of 237225 patients were treated with 1,3861,076 doses of 30 mg icatibant for 1,278987 attacks of 
acute HAE. In the first 15 Firazyr treated attacks (1,114 doses for 1,030 attacks), the median times to 
onset of symptom relief were similar across attacks (2.0 to 2.5 hours). 92.4 % of these attacks of HAE 
were treated with a single dose of Firazyr. In an assessment of the first 5 icatibant-treated attacks 
(621 doses for 582 attacks) the time to onset of symptom relief was similar across attacks. 92.9 % of 
these attacks were treated with a single dose of icatibant.

126208 patients were treated in the open label extension (OLE) phase FAST-1,and FAST-2 and FAST-3 
for a total of 7141149 separate attacks. The efficacy results were similar to those seen in the 
controlled phase of the studies. The majority of attacks (88.2% in FAST-1,and 89.8% in FAST-2 and 
95.6% in FAST-3) required only a single dose of icatibant. 
A total of 6066 patients with attacks of HAE affecting the larynx were treated in these controlled 
Phase III clinical trials. The results were similar to patients with non-laryngeal attacks of HAE with 
respect to time to onset of symptom relief. 
Changes  were  also  made  to  the  PI  to  bring  it  in  line  with  the  current  Agency/QRD  template,  SmPC 
guideline  and  other  relevant  guideline(s)  [e.g.  Excipients  guideline,  storage  conditions,  Braille,  etc…], 
which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
In addition the MAH has taken the opportunity to make minor editorial changes throughout the PI and 
to amend the Package Leaflet based on the results of user testing submitted and assessed as part of 
FUM 028 (the CHMP conclusions were adopted in April 2013). 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
The  pathophysiology  of  ACE-I-induced  angioedema  is  most  likely  based  on  decreased  degradation  of 
bradykinin. Thus, the mechanism of action (direct antagonism of the bradykinin receptor) supports the 
theory that icatibant may be a relevant treatment of ACE-I-induced angioedema. 
The pivotal trial supporting the new indication is the AMACE trial which was a multicenter, randomized, 
rater-blinded,  double-dummy,  parallel-group,  two-arm,  comparative  Phase  II  study.  The  primary 
objective  was  to  assess  the  efficacy  of  the  subcutaneously-administered  bradykinin  B2-receptor 
antagonist  icatibant  in  comparison  to  the  previous  standard  treatment  consisting  of  intravenous 
administration  of  500  mg Solu-  Decortin  H  and  2  mg  Tavegil  in  ACE  inhibitor-induced  angioedema  of 
the upper air and food passageway. 
The  median  time  to  complete  edema  resolution  (primary  endpoint)  in  the  icatibant  group  was  8.0 
hours compared to 21.2 hours in the control group. The difference was statistically significant using the 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and is of clinical relevance. Results of secondary endpoints in general support 
the  results  for  the  primary  endpoint.  No  patient  in  the  icatibant  group  required  rescue  medications 
compared to 3 in the control group. 
The MAH has submitted case reports which could be supportive of a beneficial effect of icatibant in the 
treatment of ACE-I-induced angioedema.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Due  to  suspected  deviations  in  the  conduct  of  the  AMACE  trial,  a  triggered  GCP  inspection  has  been 
performed.  At  the  inspection  of  investigator  site  no.  1  there  were  2  critical,  8  major  and  5  minor 
findings.  At  the  inspection  of  the  sponsor  of  the  trial,  Technical  University  München,  Medical  Faculty, 
there were 1 critical, 9 major and 6 minor findings. At the inspection at the CRO there were no critical, 
1  major  and  11  minor  findings.  The  inspection  report  concludes  that  due  to  the  number  and  kind  of 
findings observed, a GCP-compliant conduct of the AMACE trial at the sponsor site and at investigator 
site  no.  1  cannot  be  confirmed.  Main  areas  of  concern  were  the  protocol  design  and  its  practical 
application  at  the  investigator  sites  (e.g.  blinding,  assessment  of  Complete  Oedema  Restitution),  the 
instructions given by the sponsor to the investigators (in particular in relation to IMP documentation), 
Firazyr

Page 40/44 
 
 
 
 
the  quality  control  (monitoring)  and 
the  escalation  of 
issues  (e.g.  GCP  and  protocol 
deviations/violations). Concerning the assessment of COR, it was found that the results reported in the 
CSR were not exclusively based on a systematic collection at specific time points (visits) as defined in 
the protocol, but also on ad hoc assessments between the visits. The MAH has performed a sensitivity 
analysis which only used the scheduled times of the visits. In this analysis, the median time to COR in 
the icatibant group was 8.0 hours compared to 24  hours in the control group, i.e very similar to the 
original results. 
There  were  2  “outliers”  in  the  icatibant  group  with  long  duration  until  COR.  However,  based  on  the 
narratives,  both  had  rapid  symptom  relief  after  treatment  and  only  minor  symptoms  remained. 
Demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  did  not  differ  between  those  with  COR  ≤  8  hours  versus 
those with COR > 8 hours after treatment with icatibant.  
EU consensus on angioedema diagnosis recommends the use of laboratory parameters in assisting the 
differential  diagnosis  of  ACE-I-induced  angioedema.  It  is  understood  that  C1  inhibitor  (C1-INH)  and 
complement  levels  are  not  routinely  performed  in  the  emergency  department  for  suspected  cases  of 
ACE-I-induced  angioedema  and  it  is  agreed  that  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  in  the  study 
reflects clinical practice. However, in a clinical trial setting, especially considering the one pivotal trial 
situation, a more objective diagnosis would have been adequate, even if the final diagnosis would have 
been achieved after treatment initiation. The fact that this was not performed constitutes a weakness 
of  the  study.  However,  the  non-responsiveness  of  the  control  patients  to  conventional  therapy  in  the 
study may support that these patients indeed had bradykinin-mediated angioedema. 
Symptomatically,  based  on  mean  values,  most  of  patients  had  mild-to-moderate  severity  of  the 
disease.  However,  the  fact  that  patients  who  participated  in  the  AMACE  study  were  those  who  were 
severe  enough  to  seek  medical  attention  for  their  ACE-I-induced  angioedema  attack,  supports  that 
they  represent  the  population  who  would  be  considered  for  icatibant  treatment  in  the  emergency 
department. This is further supported by the approach to examine the maximum severity score across 
all  symptoms  or  all  angioedema  locations.    In  this  analysis,  the  majority  of  patients  in  the  AMACE 
study  (82.1%  by  angioedema  scores  and  64%  to  82.1%  by  symptom  scores)  experienced  ACE-I-
induced angioedema attacks that were either moderate or severe in intensity and could be considered 
to represent patients in clinical practice. 
It is recognized that treatment comparisons at the 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hour assessments are statistically 
significant for the investigator-assessed symptom scores but not for the subject-assessed VAS scores.  
However, considering the small sample size, statistical significance cannot be expected for all analyses. 
It  is  true  that  the  effect  size  was  larger  in  the  investigator  assessed  outcomes,  but  considering  the 
similar  trends  over  time  for  both  investigator  and  patient  assessed  outcomes,  the  results  are 
considered as supportive of an effect of icatibant. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
Some unfavourable effects are known, and already addressed in the RMP: 
Identified risk: Injection site reactions 
Potential  risks:  Deterioration  of  cardiac  function  under  ischemic  conditions  due  to  bradykinin 
antagonism, partial bradykinin agonism, antigenicity, lack of efficacy, and self administration 
Missing information: Use during pregnancy/lactation, use in children and adolescents.

Immunogenicity  has  been  given  special  interest  due  to  the  potentially  severe/fatal  outcome;  after 
initial  exposure  to  icatibant  in  controlled  Phase  III  studies,  and  after  repeated  treatment  for  multiple 
attacks of acute HAE over time, immunogenicity generally remained negative in subjects for up to 82 
attacks over two years. This will be followed also for ACE-I-induced angioedema.  
Overall, for the HAE indication the most frequent acute or observation period adverse event reported 
by subjects in controlled Phase III studies was worsening or recurrence of HAE. 
In the pivotal study for the proposed indication, six AEs were reported by five subjects, one of whom 
were treated with icatibant. This subject reported a mild AE of pain that was probably related to study 
drug. 
Injection  site  reactions  occurred  in  a  majority  of  subjects  in  the  icatibant  group,  including  redness 
(80%),  swelling  (53.3%),  pain  (46.7%),  itching  and  burning  (26.7%  each).  The  AE  of  injection  site 
reactions are well known in the already approved indication and is an identified risk in the RMP. 
One patient reported an SAE, a subject from the control group, given icatibant as rescue therapy. The 
symptom  was  dyspnoea,  and  even  after  the  patient  had  received  rescue  therapy,  tracheostomy  was 
needed. Later, this was resolved. 
In the laboratory findings, there is a notable difference in values of ACE activity, but again, the number 
of patients is small, making the assessment difficult. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of icatibant, when given under the indication of HAE, is established from trials, post-
marketing  reporting,  and  IOS  registry.  During  recent  PSURs  and  renewal  procedures,  no  new  safety 
concerns were identified, and the risk-benefit balance continued to be positive. The safety  findings in 
the AMACE study seem similar to previously shown profile, but the number of patients is very limited. 
The  current  open  risks  according  to  the  current  RMP  for  icatibant  are:  identified  risk  injection  site 
reactions,  and  potential  risks  of  deterioration  of  cardiac  function  under  ischemic  conditions,  partial 
bradykinin  agonism,  antigenicity,  lack  of  efficacy  and  self-administration.  Important  missing 
information is paediatric use and use in pregnancy and lactation. 
The  most  important  safety  concern  should  be  the  risk  of  lack  of  efficacy  in  patients  developing 
laryngeal oedema. 
The uncertainty overall, regarding this new indication, is due to the low number of patients included in 
the AMACE trial. 
The  potential  risk  “Deterioration  of  cardiac  function  under  ischemic  conditions  due  to  bradykinin 
antagonism”  (and  possibly  also  other  risks)  may  be  of  higher  relevance  for  the  proposed  indication 
compared  to  the  approved  one,  considering  that  patients  with  ACE-I  induced  angioedema  in  general 
are  older  compared  to  patients  with  acute  attacks  of  hereditary  angioedema  (mean  age  38  and  65 
years respectively in pivotal trials).  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
ACE-I-induced  angioedema  is  a  rare  but  potentially  lethal  condition.  In  clinical  practice,  this  is  a 
diagnosis  of  exclusion  and  patients  presenting  at  the  emergency  ward  are  in  general  initially  given 
anti-allergic  treatment.  However,  this  treatment  is  generally  not  effective  for  patients  with 
Firazyr 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/57346/2014  
Page 42/44 
 
 
ACE-I-induced  angioedema.  Thus,  there  is  a  medical  need  for  an  efficient  treatment  to  be  used  in 
ACE-I-treated  patients  with  angioedema  not  responding  to  initial  treatment.  The  pathophysiology  is 
most  likely  based  on  decreased  degradation  of  bradykinin.  Thus,  the  mechanism  of  action  (direct 
antagonism of the bradykinin receptor) supports the theory that icatibant may be a relevant treatment 
of  ACE-I-induced  angioedema.  In  the  pivotal  study,  there  was  a  statistically  significant  shortening  of 
median  time  to  complete edema  resolution  with  icatibant  compared  to  standard  of  care  which  is  also 
considered  to  be  of  clinical  relevance.  These  findings  were  in  general  supported  by  results  for 
secondary endpoints.  
Since  only  15  patients  were  treated  with  icatibant  in  the  pivotal  study,  very  limited  safety  data  is 
available  for  the  proposed  target  population  and  safety  would  have  to  be  extrapolated  from  the 
currently approved indication.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The  potential  effect  of  Firazyr  in  the  treatment  of  ACE-I-induced  angioedema  is  supported  by  the 
mechanism  of  action  of  icatibant,  the  results  of  the  AMACE  study  and  case  reports.  However,  the 
critical findings at the triggered GCP inspection cast doubt on the reliability of the results of the AMACE 
study  especially  with  respect  to  blinding,  IMP  documentation  and  the  assessment  of  the  primary 
endpoint.  Even  though  the  MAH  has  provided  justifications  for  some  of  the  findings  including  new 
analyses,  the  overall  conclusion  that  the  study  was  not  GCP  compliant  warrants  further  justification 
and  confirmation  of  the  study  results.  According  to  clinicaltrials.gov,  a  multicenter  phase  III  trial  is 
planned with intended starting date September 2013. The need to provide these results before or after 
a possible approval should be further discussed. 
Thus,  additional  justification  is  needed  to  ensure  that  the  results  of  the  AMACE  study  are  robust 
enough to support the indication.  
The overall B/R of Firazyr in the new indication for the treatment of ACE-inhibitor induced angioedema 
was considered negative at the time of the MAH’s withdrawal of the extension of indication. 
The  proposed  update  to  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  to  include  the  results  of  the  open-label  extension 
phase of study FAST3 were considered acceptable by the CHMP.

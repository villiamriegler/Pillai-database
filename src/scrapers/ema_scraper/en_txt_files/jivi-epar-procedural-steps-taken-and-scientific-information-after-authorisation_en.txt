SmPC, Annex 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
II, Labelling 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of Jivi in 
and PL 
the approved indication remains favourable and therefore 
recommended the renewal of the marketing authorisation 
with unlimited validity. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Submission of the final report from the pharmacokinetic 
pharmacokinetic study 19742 comparing the 
pharmacokinetic parameters of Jivi vs. Adynovi. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
study 19742 comparing the pharmacokinetic parameters of 
Jivi vs. Adynovi. Results of the study did not change the PK 
profile or benefit/risk assessment for Jivi, therefore no 
change of the Jivi SmPC is needed.

SmPC new text 
the final study report of the long-term extension 
study 15912 (PROTECT Kids) in children. This 
extension study is a category 3 study of the Jivi RMP. 
The MAH took the oportunity to update the list of 
local representatives in the PIL. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC were updated to include the following:  
Section 4.8: “In the paediatric study, 59/73 patients < 12 
years continued in the extension study. Median (range) 
total time in study (main study + extension) was 5.8 (1.0-
6.6) years with a median of 430 (range 98-671) ED per 
subject, 39 subjects were treated for =/> 5 years. 
The median number of exposure days to Jivi per subject 
was 95237 (min-max: 1-698) for all subjects in the clinical 
studies. 
Overall, in both studies 75 patients were observed for a 
treatment duration of more than 5 years.” 
Section 5.1: “For 59 patients who continued in the 
extension study the overall median (Q1;Q3) ABR during the 
extension period was 1.64 (0.5, 3.1). For 30 patients ≥ 12 
years at the end of the extension study, the median (Q1; 
Q3) ABR was 1.76 (0.5; 3.3),” which is in accordance with 
the presented results in the final study report and thus 
accepted.

Information on Paediatric requirements 
Onglyza  
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
[P/97/2011] on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP for saxagliptin (P/97/2011) was not yet completed 
as some measures were deferred.  
Komboglyze 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision on the 
granting of a product-specific waiver for saxagliptin/metformin (P/240/2009). 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Saxagliptin  is  a  selective,  orally  administered,  xanthine-based  inhibitor  of  dipeptidylpeptidase-4  (DPP-
4).  The  recommended  therapeutic  dose  of  saxagliptin  is  5  mg  once  daily.  Like  other  DPP-4  inhibitors, 
saxagliptin lowers blood glucose by extending the half-life of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which is 
secreted  in  response  to  a  meal.  GLP-1  lowers  blood  glucose  by  augmenting  the  glucose-stimulated 
insulin  release  and  limiting  glucagon  secretion  to  slow  gastric  emptying  and  to  induce  satiety. 
Therefore, saxagliptin predominately affects postprandial glycaemic excursions. The advantages of DPP-
4  inhibitors  over  other  established  antidiabetic  medications  include  the  low  risk  of  hypoglycaemia  and 
lack of weight gain. 
Onglyza (saxagliptin) and Komboglyze (saxagliptin/metformin) were approved throughout the European 
Union on 1 October 2009 and 24 November 2011, respectively. 
The  MAH  proposed  to extend  the  indication  for  the treatment  of  type  2 diabetes  as  triple  combination 
(saxagliptin in combination with metformin and a sulphonylurea (SU)). 
The clinical program to support the addition of the “in combination with metformin and a SU” indication 
was  developed  in  accordance  with  the  “Notes  for  Guidance  on  Clinical  Investigations  of  Medicinal 
Products in the Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus” (CPMP/EWP/1080/00).  
The present worksharing application for Onglyza and Komboglyze  is supported by study D1680L00006, 
a  24-week,  multicentre,  randomised,  parallel-group,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  Phase  3b  study, 
which  assessed  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  saxagliptin  5  mg  as  an  adjunct  to  metformin  plus  SU  in 
improving  glycaemic  control  in  adult  subjects  with  T2DM.  In  study  D1680L00006,  saxagliptin  and 
metformin were administered as separate tablets rather than as the FDC product. 
2.2.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
2.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted

Methods 
Study design 
Study  D1680L00006  was  a  24-week,  multicenter,  randomized,  parallel-group,  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled  Phase  3b  study  to  evaluate the  efficacy  and  safety  of  saxagliptin  compared  with  placebo  as 
add-on  therapy  to  a  stable  metformin  dose  plus  a  stable  SU  dose  in  subjects  with  T2DM  who  have 
inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥7% and ≤10%). Subjects were to be on a stable combined dose 
of metformin extended release (XR) or immediate release (IR) (at maximum tolerated dose [MTD], with 
minimum  dose  for  enrolment  being  1500  mg)  plus  SU  (gliclazide,  gliclazide  modified  release  [MR],  or 
glimepiride  at  MTD  with  minimum  dose  for  enrolment  being  ≥50%  of  the  maximum  recommended 
dose) for at least 8 weeks prior to enrolment. 
The protocol was amended following enrolment of the first subjects to widen the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria by allowing use of any SU (including glibenclamide) in combination with metformin for at least 8 
weeks  prior  to  enrolment.  Following  amendment,  enrolled  subjects  were  to  be  on  a  stable  combined 
dose  of  metformin  XR  or  IR  (at  MTD,  with  minimum  dose  for  enrolment  being  1500  mg)  plus  SU  (at 
MTD, with minimum dose for enrolment being ≥50% of the maximum recommended dose) for at least 
8 weeks prior to enrolment. 
During  the  enrolment/screening  and  24-week  double-blind  treatment  periods,  subjects  continued  their 
own (open-label) metformin plus SU at the doses ascertained during enrolment. Metformin and SU were 
not  supplied  as  part  of  the  investigational  products  and,  thus,  were  not  subject  to  the  treatment 
compliance check that was performed for saxagliptin and placebo. 
Subjects  were  randomized  (1:1)  to  either  saxagliptin  5  mg  or  matching  placebo  once  daily  by  oral 
administration. The metformin and SU doses were to remain constant during the 24-week double-blind 
treatment period. 
Study population 
The population of Study D1680L00006 consisted of male and female subjects with T2DM, aged between 
25 and 83 years of age (inclusive), with inadequate glycaemic control (defined as HbA1c levels ≥7.0% 
and ≤10.0%) and were on a stable combined dose of metformin plus SU for at least 8 weeks prior to 
enrolment. 
Endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in HbA1c level from baseline until Week 24.  
Secondary endpoints assessed at week 24 were:  
•  Change in PPG (measured 2 hours after breakfast) from baseline to Week 24; 
•  Change from baseline in FPG; 
• 
Proportion of subjects achieving a therapeutic glycaemic response (defined as HbA1c < 7%); 
Other efficacy endpoints were the changes from baseline to week 24 for TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG; 
Subject-reported endpoints using the EQ-5D questionnaire; Change in insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon 
from baseline to Week 24. 
Statistical analysis 
Sample size 
To  demonstrate  a  significant  difference  between  saxagliptin  and  placebo—as  add-on  therapy  to  the 
combination  of  metformin  plus  SU—in  the  change  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  24,  a  total  of  240 
Assessment report Komboglyze Onglyza WS-0295 
EMA/302364/2013 
Page 4/44 
  
  
subjects  randomised  and  treated  (120  subjects  per  treatment  group)  was  needed  to  provide 
approximately 80% power at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05, assuming a true difference of 0.40% 
and a standard deviation (SD) of 1.1%. 
Assuming a 4% drop-out rate of subjects who were randomised but did not return for a post-baseline 
assessment, a total of 250 subjects was required for randomisation. Assuming a 10% screening failure 
rate  for  subjects  who  were  consented  and  enrolled  but  were  not  eligible  for  randomisation,  a  total  of 
275 subjects was planned for enrolment/screening. 
Primary endpoint 
The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  to  compare  the  difference  between  saxagliptin  5  mg  once  daily  as 
add-on  therapy  to  metformin  plus  SU  versus  placebo  as  add-on  therapy  to  metformin  plus  SU,  in 
subjects with T2DM, as determined by the change in HbA1c levels from baseline to Week 24. 
The primary analysis for efficacy variables was based on the Full Analysis set, which included subjects 
who  took  at  least  1  dose  of  investigational  product  and  had  both  baseline  and  post-baseline  efficacy 
data. For this study, a sensitivity analysis was performed for the Per Protocol (PP) analysis set since the 
pre-defined  criterion  of  >10%  of  subjects  in  either  treatment  group  of  the  Full  Analysis  set  having 
significant deviations from the protocol (as defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan [SAP]) was met. 
The change from baseline to Week 24 in HbA1c was analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model  with  treatment  group  and  country  as  fixed  effects  and  baseline  HbA1c  value  as  a  covariate. 
Missing  Week  24  values  were  imputed  using  the  last  observation  carried  forward  (LOCF)  method.  The 
model was used to derive a least squares estimate of the treatment difference in the mean change from 
baseline  with  corresponding  2-sided  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  and  2-sided  p-value.  In  addition,  2-
sided 95% CIs for the mean change within each treatment group were calculated. 
Sequential testing methodology 
A fixed-sequence test method was adopted for the overall primary efficacy variable (HbA1c change from 
baseline to Week 24), and the 3 secondary efficacy variables to control the Type I error rate so as not 
to exceed the 5% level. The fixed-sequence test method was applied to these variables in the following 
sequential order: 
Change from baseline to Week 24 in HbA1c (or the last post-baseline measurement prior to Week 24 if 
no Week 24 assessment was available). 
Change from baseline to Week 24 in 2-hour PPG (or the last post-baseline measurement prior to Week 
24 if no Week 24 assessment was available). 
Change from baseline to Week 24 in FPG (or the last post-baseline measurement prior to Week 24 if no 
Week 24 assessment was available). 
Proportion of subjects achieving a glycaemic response defined as HbA1c <7.0% was compared using a 
logistic regression model. 
Statistical inference began with the overall primary efficacy variable. If the saxagliptin treatment group 
was statistically significantly superior in the change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24 over the placebo 
group  at  the  5%  level,  then  statistical  inference  continued  with  (2)  in  the  sequence  above—the  first 
secondary efficacy variable (2-hour PPG); otherwise, statistical inference of the overall efficacy variables 
was stopped (any p value that follows cannot be considered as significant in this confirmatory analysis 
when the fixed-sequence procedure is used to control the overall Type I error rate, even if the p-value 
is <0.05).  
Assessment report Komboglyze Onglyza WS-0295 
EMA/302364/2013 
Page 5/44 
  
  
Similar testing was followed with the prescribed sequential order (1) to (4) as the above steps with the 
same decision rule at each of the variable evaluations until all 3 secondary variables were analysed or 
testing was interrupted at any non-significant findings at the 5% level. 
Analysis sets 
The  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  analyses  were  performed  on  the  Full  analysis  set  using 
LOCF to estimate any missing values at Week 24. The safety endpoints were analysed using the Safety 
analysis set. The decision to include or exclude subjects from each analysis set was performed in a blind 
data review prior to unblinding. 
Randomised analysis set 
All subjects randomised to double-blind treatment at Week 1 (Day 0) were included in the Randomised 
analysis set. 
Full analysis set 
The  Full  analysis  set  included  all  randomised  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  investigational 
product  during  the  24-week  double-blind  treatment  period  and  who  had  a  non  missing  baseline  value 
and  at  least  1  post-baseline  value  for  at  least  1  efficacy  parameter.  The  Full  analysis  set  followed  the 
principles of intention-to-treat in that all efficacy measures were summarised and analysed according to 
the treatment to which subjects were randomised, regardless of the treatment actually received. 
Per Protocol analysis set 
The PP analysis set was a subset of the Full analysis set including subjects with no reasons for 
exclusion. These exclusions for the PP analysis set were explicitly defined in the SAP and the subjects 
with exclusions were identified prior to database locking. A PP analysis on the primary variable was only 
to be performed if >10% of subjects in either treatment group of the Full analysis set have significant 
protocol violations or deviations. Otherwise, analysis of the primary variable was restricted to the Full 
analysis set.

Disposition of subjects is shown in the table above. 
The study was conducted at 35 study centres in: United Kingdom (12 sites), Canada (4 sites), Australia 
(7 sites), India (6 sites), Korea (4 sites), and Thailand (2 sites).  
Of  the  383  subjects  who  entered  the  enrolment/screening  period,  126  subjects  did  not  enter  the 
randomised, double-blind treatment period due to subject decision (n=11), lost to follow-up (n=1), and 
eligibility criteria not fulfilled (n=114). Thus, a total of 257 subjects were randomised and treated. 
In table 1 the following is indicated: 
•  A total of 257 subjects were assigned to randomised double-blind treatment with either saxagliptin 
+ metformin + SU (n=129) or placebo + metformin + SU (n=128). 
• 
• 
The proportion of subjects who completed the 24-week, double-blind, randomised treatment period 
was similar in the 2 treatment groups (approximately 88%). 
The  most  common  reason  for  discontinuation  in  both  treatment  groups  was  worsening  of  T2DM 
(6.2% [n=8] in the saxagliptin group and 5.5% [n=7] in the placebo group). 
•  One subject (0.8%) in each treatment group withdrew due to a calculated CrCl of <60 mL/min or an 
increase in serum creatinine of ≥44.2 μmol/L (≥0.5 mg/dL) above baseline. 
• 
The  proportion  of  subjects  discontinuing  study  treatment  due  to  an  AE  during  double-blind 
treatment was in the saxagliptin group 0.8% [n=1] and in the placebo group 2.3% [n=3]. 
Protocol deviations 
The number of subjects with important protocol deviations in each treatment group are summarised in 
the table below.

Table 2 
Summary of significant protocol deviations and violations leading to exclusion 
from the PP analysis set (Full analysis set) 
In  total,  19  (15.0%)  and  16  (12.5%)  subjects  from  the  saxagliptin  and  placebo  groups,  respectively, 
were excluded from the PP analysis set. The majority of subjects were excluded for use of a prohibited 
concomitant  medication  (12  [9.4%]  and  10  [7.8%]  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin  and  placebo  groups, 
respectively),  namely  CYP3A4  inducers  and/or  CYP3A4/5  inhibitors.  On  further  clarification  requested 
from  the  applicant  by  CHMP  during  the  procedure,  an  analysis  provided  showed  the  number  of 
individuals  with  significant  protocol  deviations  leading  to  exclusion  from  the  PP  population  to  be  small 
when the erroneously counted CYP3A4 inhibitor/inducers/substrates are neglected. The FAS included all 
individuals  with  significant  protocol  deviations.  Results  of  the  FAS  and  PP  analysis  were  similar, 
indicating  that  the  treatment  effect  of  saxagliptin  was  robust  and  consistent  and  therefore  the 
remaining concern was resolved. 
Subjects analysed (analysis sets) 
The  analysis  sets  and  the number  of  subjects  in each  analysis  set  are  summarised in the table below. 
The Randomised analysis set comprised 257 subjects, of whom 255 (99.2%) were included in the Full 
analysis  set,  220  (85.6%)  were  included  in  the  PP analysis  set,  and  257  (100%)  were  included in  the 
Safety  analysis  set.  The  2  treatment  groups  were  balanced  with  regard  to  inclusion  in  the  respective 
analysis sets.

Demographic and key-baseline characteristics 
The  demographic  and  key  baseline  characteristics  of  subjects  in  the  Randomised  analysis  set  are 
summarised in the table below. 
The  demographic  and  key  baseline  characteristics  were  generally  balanced  across  the  2  treatment 
groups. The subjects ranged in age from 25 to 83 years with a mean (SD) age of 57.0 (10.54) years. A 
total of 196 subjects (76.3%) were <65 years of age. Of the 257 randomised and treated subjects, the 
majority  of  subjects  in  each  treatment  group  were  male  (62.0%  and  57.8%  in  the  saxagliptin  and 
placebo groups, respectively). Body weight ranged from 40 to 155 kg with a mean (SD) of 82.4 (19.86) 
kg and 80.3 (18.47) kg for the saxagliptin and placebo groups, respectively. The respective mean (SD) 
BMI was 29.4 (5.26) kg/m2 and 29.1 (4.93) kg/m2 for the saxagliptin and placebo groups.

Mean dose of Metformin and SU in the randomized set 
In the randomized set mean baseline dose of Metformin (1957.00 mg) and of SU [Glibenclamide (15.50 
mg), Gliclazide (159.63 mg), Glimepiride (5.04 mg), and Glipizide (17.78 mg)] was sufficient. 
Baseline diabetes characteristics 
Baseline diabetes characteristics for the Randomised analysis set are summarised in the table below. 
The  baseline  disease  characteristics  of  HbA1c,  PPG,  and  FPG  were  representative  of  subjects  with 
uncontrolled T2DM who have inadequate glycaemic control when treated with combination therapy with 
metformin  plus  SU.  The  mean  baseline  values  for  these  3  parameters  were  slightly  higher  in  the 
saxagliptin group compared with the placebo group. 
For  HbA1c,  the  mean  (SD)  value  at  baseline  was  8.38%  (0.856%)  and  8.19%  (0.832%)  in  the 
saxagliptin and placebo groups, respectively. Differences in these baseline disease characteristics were 
accounted for in the efficacy analysis by using baseline value as a covariate in the ANCOVA analysis.

Table 6 
Change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 (LOCF) (Full analysis set) 
Mean  baseline  HbA1c  values  were  slightly  higher  in  the  saxagliptin  group  compared  with  the  placebo 
group. The adjusted mean change from baseline to Week 24 was -0.74% for the saxagliptin group and -
0.08%  for  the  placebo  group.  Based  on  the  difference  in  adjusted  mean  changes  from  baseline, 
treatment with saxagliptin significantly decreased HbA1c compared with placebo in the Full analysis set. 
The difference in adjusted mean changes between the 2 groups (saxagliptin minus placebo) was -0.66% 
(2-sided 95% CI, -0.86% to -0.47%; p<0.0001). 
Mean  HbA1c  values  over  time  during  the  24-week  double-blind  treatment  period  are  summarised 
graphically for the Full analysis set (LOCF) in the figure below.

Figure 1 
Mean  change  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  (95%  CI)  during  the  double-blind 
treatment period (LOCF; Full analysis set) 
In contrast with placebo for saxagliptin a reduction from baseline was observed at weeks 4, 8, 12 and 
progressively greater to week 16. This reduction was maintained through week 24. 
More than 10% of subjects in the Full analysis set were excluded from the PP analysis set. Therefore a 
sensitivity  analysis  of  the  change  in  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  24  was  performed  using  the  PP 
analysis set (see table below). 
The results from the Full analysis set (LOCF) were confirmed in the PP analysis. Adjusted mean changes 
from baseline to Week 24 (LOCF) in the PP analysis were -0.70% for the saxagliptin group and -0.09% 
for  the  placebo  group.  The  difference  in  adjusted  mean  changes  between  the  2  groups  (saxagliptin 
minus placebo) was -0.61% (2-sided 95% CI, -0.82% to -0.40%; p<0.0001).

Secondary endpoints 
Results for secondary endpoints were in line with those of the primary endpoint. 
Treatment  with  saxagliptin  +  metformin  +  SU  resulted  in  a  significantly  greater  reduction  in  2-hour 
PPG at Week 24 compared with placebo + metformin + SU. The difference in adjusted mean changes 
between the 2 groups (saxagliptin minus placebo) was -0.93 mmol/L (-16.74 mg/dL) (2-sided 95% CI, 
-1.77 to -0.09 mmol/L [-31.85 to -1.62 mg/dL]; p=0.0301) (see table below)

Table 8 
Change in 2-hour PPG from baseline to Week 24 (LOCF) (Full analysis set) 
Similar results were obtained in the Full analysis set using observed values. 
Saxagliptin  +  metformin  +  SU  produced  a  numerically  greater  reduction  compared  with  placebo  + 
metformin + SU in FPG at Week 24. The difference in adjusted mean changes between the 2 groups 
(saxagliptin minus placebo) was -0.44 mmol/L (-7.90 mg/dL) (2-sided 95% CI, -0.94 to 0.06 mmol/L [-
16.96 to 1.15 mg/dL]; p=0.0868). 
The proportion of subjects achieving a therapeutic glycaemic response, defined as HbA1c <7.0% 
at  Week  24,  was  higher  in  the  saxagliptin  group  (30.7%)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (9.4%).  The

Other efficacy endpoints 
Saxagliptin  +  metformin  +  SU  compared  with  placebo  +  metformin  +  SU  had  similar  non–clinically 
relevant effects on mean changes from baseline to Week 24 in fasting plasma lipids (TC, LDL, HDL-
C, TG) as well as on fasting levels of insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon. 
The  changes  from  baseline  to  Week  24  were  similar  in  the  saxagliptin  and  placebo  groups  in  subject-
reported health status assessed with the EQ-5D.

2.2.3.  Discussion 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  design  of  the  study  was  considered  adequate  to  evaluate  the  value  of  saxagliptin  when  added  to 
metformin plus SU in T2DM.  
The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  to  compare  the  difference  between  saxagliptin  5  mg  once  daily  as 
add-on  therapy  to  metformin  plus  SU  versus  placebo  as  add-on  therapy  to  metformin  plus  SU,  in 
subjects with T2DM, as determined by the change in HbA1c levels from baseline to Week 24. 
The primary and secondary endpoints were agreed.

In  general  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  seemed  adequate  and  similar  to  those  used  in  former 
studies  in  T2DM  patients.  The  inclusion  criterion  of  metformin  dose  ≥  1500  mg/day  is  consistent  with 
that used in previous studies of saxagliptin and other antidiabetic agents and is acceptable. The mean 
dose  of  >  1800  mg  is  acceptable.  Two  forms  of  Metformin  have  been  used:  Metformin  XR  and 
Metformin  IR.  The  XR  formulation  is  not  approved  in  all  EU  Member  States,  as  it  was  considered 
somewhat less effective than the IR formulation. However, the mean dose of >1800 mg was considered 
to  be  high  enough  by  CHMP  to  overcome  any  concern  with  possible  small  differences  due  to 
formulation. 
There  were  no  significant  differences  between  treatment  groups  in  the  percentages  of  patients  who 
completed  the  study  and  the  percentage  of  withdrawals.  Also  the  reasons  for  withdrawal  were  not 
significantly  different  between  the  treatment  groups.  A  relatively  large  group  of  subjects  discontinued 
from  study:  12.4%  in  the  saxagliptin  group.  However  nearly  the  same  percentage  discontinued  in  the 
placebo  group:  11.7%.  Reason  for  discontinuation  due  to  worsening  of  T2DM  (that  is  lack  of  efficacy) 
was 6.2 and 5.5% respectively. 
The study was conducted at 35 study centres in: United Kingdom (12 sites), Canada (4 sites), Australia 
(7 sites), India (6 sites), Korea (4 sites), and Thailand (2 sites).  
Considering the large number of sites (35) and the small number of subjects enrolled at most sites the 
CHMP was concerned about a possible centre effect. Consequently, the MAH has performed an analysis 
according  to  country  in  which  the  centres  were  located,  which  did  not  show  any  interaction  and 
therefore resolved the issue. 
There  were  no  relevant  differences  between  treatment  groups  in  demographics  and  baseline  disease 
characteristics. 
45%  of  patients  were  white,  27%  were  from  India,  20%  from  Australia,  20%  from  UK,  19%  from 
Korea, 7% from Canada and 7% from Thailand. 
The  mean  baseline  dose  of  metformin  and  SU  (Glibenclamide,  Gliclazide,  Glimepiride  and  Glipizide, 
respectively) in the randomized set was considered as sufficient by CHMP. 
The  baseline  disease  characteristics  of  HbA1c,  PPG,  and  FPG  were  representative  of  subjects  with 
uncontrolled T2DM who have inadequate glycaemic control when treated with combination therapy with 
metformin plus SU. Baseline disease characteristics can be considered typical for T2DM patients. 
The  mean  baseline  values  for  HbA1c,  PPG,  and  FPG  were  slightly  higher  in  the  saxagliptin  group 
compared  with  the  placebo  group.  For  HbA1c,  the  mean  (SD)  value  at  baseline  was  8.38%  (0.856%) 
and 8.19% (0.832%) in the saxagliptin and placebo groups, respectively. Differences in these baseline 
disease characteristics were accounted for in the efficacy analysis. 
According to the data in table 5, the range of HbA1c was 6.60 – 10.50 %, whereas the eligibility criteria 
were defined as subjects with HbA1c ≥7% and ≤10% to be  randomized to receive either saxagliptin 5 
mg  or  matching  placebo  once  daily  by  oral  administration  for  24  weeks.  The  applicant  provided  as 
explanation for this extended range that those values were obtained at visit 3, which was  not used as 
enrolement  criterion  and  this  was  considered  by  CHMP  not  to  have  a  relevant  effect  on  the  results 
obtained. 
Results  from  the  FAS  and  PP  analysis  indicate  that  the  addition  of  saxagliptin  to  metformin  +  SU  was 
more effective than placebo in lowering HbA1c. The difference of -0.66% was clinically relevant. 
Both  primary  and  secondary  parameters  indicate  that  the  addition  of  saxagliptin  to  T2DM  patients 
treated  with  metformin  +  SU  was  effective.  Saxagliptin  +  metformin  +  SU  was  superior  to  placebo  + 
metformin  +  SU  in  lowering  HbA1c  from  baseline  to  Week  24  (adjusted  mean  changes  of  -0.74%  for 
Assessment report Komboglyze Onglyza WS-0295

the saxagliptin group and -0.08% for the placebo group, with a difference versus placebo of -0.66% [2-
sided  95%  CI,  -0.86%  to  -0.47%;  p<0.0001]  for  saxagliptin).  The  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  a 
therapeutic  glycaemic  response,  defined  as  HbA1c  <7.0%  at  Week  24,  was  higher  in  the  saxagliptin 
group (30.7%) than in the placebo group (9.4%).  
A  relatively  large  group  of  subjects  discontinued  from  this  24  weeks  study:  12.4%  in  the  saxagliptin 
group  was  initially  of  concern  for  CHMP.  However  nearly  the  same  percentage  discontinued  in  the 
placebo  group:  11.7%.  Reason  for  discontinuation  due  to  worsening  of  T2DM  was  6.2  and  5.5% 
respectively,  indicating  possible  lack  of  efficacy  in  these  patients.  The  effect  on  FPG  was  not  large 
enough  for  continuation  but  even  in  those  subjects  there  was  still  a  considerable  placebo-corrected 
mean reduction in HbA1c, which was found to be satisfactory by CHMP. 
Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Saxagliptin 5 mg added to a stable dose of metformin plus SU was superior to placebo added to a stable 
dose of metformin plus SU in lowering HbA1c and 2-hour PPG from baseline to Week 24. 
In contrast with placebo for saxagliptin a reduction in HbA1c from baseline was observed at weeks 4, 8, 
12 and progressively greater to week 16. This reduction was maintained through week 24. 
The adjusted mean changes were -0.74% for the saxagliptin group and -0.08% for the placebo group, 
with  a  difference  versus  placebo  of  -0.66%  [2-sided  95%  CI,  -0.86%  to  -0.47%;  p<0.0001]  for 
saxagliptin).

Adverse events  
Number of Subjects with at least 1 adverse event is given in the table below. 
The proportion of subjects with AEs during the 24-week double-blind treatment period was lower in the 
saxagliptin group than the placebo group: 62.8% (n=81) in the saxagliptin group and 71.7% (n=91) in 
the  placebo  group.  The  proportion  of  subjects  with  treatment-related  AEs  (as  assessed  by  the 
investigator to have a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational 
product)  was  higher  in  the  saxagliptin  group  than  the  placebo  group  (16.3%  and  10.2%  in  the 
saxagliptin  and  placebo  groups,  respectively).  There  were  no  deaths  during  the  study.  SAEs  were 
reported  in  a  total  of  10  subjects,  3  (2.3%)  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  7  (5.5%)  in  the 
placebo group. One (0.8%) subject in the saxagliptin group and 3 (2.3%) subjects in the placebo group 
discontinued treatment due to AEs; of these AEs, 1 in the placebo group was an SAE.

The  proportion  of  subjects  with  AEs  (excluding  hypoglycaemic  events)  was  59.7%  in  the  saxagliptin 
group and 69.5% in the placebo group. The SOCs with the highest number of subjects with AEs (≥10% 
in the saxagliptin group) were infections and infestations (34 [26.4%] subjects in saxagliptin group and 
44  [34.4%]  in  the  placebo  group),  gastrointestinal  disorders  (24  [18.6%]  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin 
group  and  23  [18.0%]  in  the  placebo  group),  nervous  system  disorders  (16  [12.4%]  subjects  in 
saxagliptin  group  and  7  [5.5%]  in  the  placebo  group),  and  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue 
disorders  (13  [10.1%]  subjects  in  saxagliptin  group  and  15  [11.7%]  in  the  placebo  group).  Another

SOC with an incidence of ≥5% in the saxagliptin group and greater than placebo was vascular disorders 
(5.4% vs 2.3% in the placebo group). At the PT level, the most common AEs (≥5%) in the saxagliptin 
group  were  nasopharyngitis  (6.2%),  diarrhoea  (5.4%),  and  hypertension  (5.4%);  the  most  common 
AEs  in  the  placebo  group  were  nasopharyngitis  (9.4%),  urinary  tract  infection  (6.3%),  and 
dyslipidaemia  (5.5%).  AEs  with  an  incidence  of  ≥2%  in the  saxagliptin  group  and  at  least 1% greater 
than in the placebo group were diarrhoea (5.4% vs 3.9% in the placebo group), hypertension (5.4% vs 
1.6%), cough (3.1% vs 0.8%), flatulence (3.1% vs 0), and peripheral neuropathy (2.3% vs 0).

Most  AEs  in  both  treatment  groups  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity.  Four  (3.1%)  subjects  in  each 
group  had  AEs  that  were  severe  in  intensity.  In  the  saxagliptin  group,  severe  AEs  included  an  SAE  of 
hepatitis  in  1  (0.8%)  subject  that  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  to  be  possibly  related  to  study 
treatment  (see  Section  8.3.2  and  Section  8.3.4.2),  an  SAE  of  lower  respiratory  tract  infection  in  1 
(0.8%)  subject  that  was  not  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  possibly  related  to  study  treatment 
(see Section 8.3.2), and AEs of bursitis and carotid artery occlusion reported in 1 (0.8%) subject each, 
neither  of  which  was  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  possibly  related  to  study  treatment.  In  the 
placebo  group,  severe  AEs  included  influenza-like  illness,  and  SAEs  of  cartilage  injury,  renal  colic,  and 
asthma reported in 1 (0.8%) subject each (also see Section 8.3.2), none of which were considered by 
the investigator to be possibly related to study treatment. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No AEs with fatal outcome were reported. 
Serious adverse events 
Subjects who had serious adverse events are tabulated in the table below. 
A total of 10 subjects experienced SAEs during the double-blind treatment period, 3 (2.3%) subjects in 
the  saxagliptin  group  and  7  (5.5%)  in  the  placebo  group.  In  the  saxagliptin  group,  the  SAEs  included 
lower  respiratory  tract  infection,  laryngeal  cancer,  and  hepatitis  in  1  subject  each.  Of  these,  hepatitis 
was  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  possibly  related  to  study  treatment.  The  subject,  although 
asymptomatic,  was  diagnosed  with  hepatitis,  pancreatitis,  and  calculus  cholecystitis  after the  subject’s 
end-of-study laboratory evaluations revealed elevated transaminases and total bilirubin. 
In the placebo group, SAEs included influenza, osteomyelitis, squamous cell carcinoma, cartilage injury, 
renal colic, and asthma in 1 subject each, and arthritis and musculoskeletal stiffness in 1 subject. None 
of  the  SAEs  in  the  placebo  group  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  possibly  related  to 
treatment.

A total of 4 subjects discontinued due to AEs during the double-blind treatment period, 1 (0.8%) in the 
saxagliptin  group  (headache)  and  3  (2.3%)  in  the  placebo  group  (abdominal  distension,  diabetes 
mellitus inadequate control, and asthma). Of these AEs, the events of headache in the saxagliptin group 
and  abdominal  distension  in  the  placebo  group  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  possibly 
related to study treatment, and the event of asthma in the placebo group was an SAE.

Adverse events of special interest 
Hypoglycaemic adverse events 
Subjects  self-monitored  their  fasting  blood  glucose  levels  (at  least  every  other  day)  and  recorded  in 
their  subject  diary  their  fasting  glucose  values,  any  symptoms  suggestive  of  hypoglycaemia,  and 
fingerstick glucose values obtained at the time of a symptomatic event. A hypoglycaemic event could be 
an episode with symptoms and confirmed low glucose, an episode with low glucose, or an episode with 
symptoms when glucose was not measured. 
Hypoglycaemic  AEs  were  classified  into  3  categories:  major,  minor,  and  suggestive  events  based  on 
CHMP  criteria.  A  hypoglycaemic  AE  was  classified  as  a  major  event  if  it  was  a  symptomatic  episode 
requiring  external  assistance  due  to  severe  impairment  in  consciousness  or  behaviour,  with  a  plasma 
glucose  level  <3.0  mmol/L  (54  mg/dL),  and  resulted  in  prompt  recovery  after  glucose  or  glucagon 
administration.  A  hypoglycaemic  AE  was  classified  as  a  minor  event  if  it  was  symptomatic  associated 
with  a  blood  glucose  level  <3.0  mmol/L  (54  mg/dL)  and  no  need  for  assistance,  or  an  asymptomatic 
plasma  glucose  measurement  <3.0  mmol/L  (54  mg/dL).  Events  suggestive  of  hypoglycaemia  were 
events  with  symptoms  that  the  subject  experiences  as  hypoglycaemia,  where  plasma  glucose 
measurements were not available.

A  total  of  13  (10.1%)  subjects  experienced  19  AEs  of  hypoglycaemia  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  8 
(6.3%)  subjects  experienced  16  AEs  of  hypoglycaemia  in  the  placebo  group  during  the  double-blind 
treatment  period.  No  subject  in  either  treatment  group  experienced  an  SAE  of  hypoglycaemia.  No 
subject in either treatment group had a major hypoglycaemic event during the double-blind treatment 
period.  Of  the  19  AEs  of  hypoglycaemia  in  the  saxagliptin  group,  4  were  minor  events  and  15  were 
suggestive events. Of the 16 AEs of hypoglycaemia in the placebo group, 5 were minor events and 11 
were suggestive events. Confirmed hypoglycaemia events were defined as symptomatic hypoglycaemia 
with  a  fingerstick  glucose  value  of  ≤2.8  mmol/L  [50  mg/dL]).  Two  (1.6%)  subjects  in  the  saxagliptin 
group and none in the placebo group had confirmed hypoglycaemia events. One saxagliptin subject and 
2 placebo subjects had their dose of SU down-titrated during the double-blind treatment period due to 
hypoglycaemic events. 
Hepatic  disorders  One  (0.8%)  subject  in  the  saxagliptin  group  had  an  AE  of  hepatitis.  Following 
repeat  laboratory  testing,  the  subject  was  diagnosed  with  asymptomatic  hepatitis,  pancreatitis,  and 
calculus cholecystitis. The subject received no further study treatment as he had completed the study.  
No  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  experienced  hepatic  disorders  during  the  double-blind  treatment 
period. 
No  subject  in  either  treatment  group  had  a  lymphopaenic  AE,  thrombocytopaenic  AE,  localised 
oedema during the double-blind treatment period. 
There  were  no  AEs  of  selected  skin  disorders  in  the  saxagliptin  group;  1  (0.8%)  subject  in  the 
placebo group had an AE of skin ulcer. 
Infection-related  AEs  were  observed  more  frequently  in  the  placebo  group  compared  to  the 
saxagliptin  group.  AEs  in  the  SOC  infections  and  infestations  were  reported  in  34  (26.4%)  subjects  in 
the  saxagliptin  group  and  in  44  (34.4%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group.  The  most  common  infections 
(occurring in .2% of subjects in either treatment group) were nasopharyngitis (6.2% in the saxagliptin 
group and 9.4% in the placebo group), upper respiratory tract infection (4.7% in each group), urinary 
tract  infection  (3.1%  and  6.3%),  and  pharyngitis  (0  and  2.3%).  Based  on  the  SOC  infections  and 
infestations,  SAEs  were  reported  for  1  (0.8%)  subject  in the  saxagliptin  group  (lower  respiratory tract 
infection)  and  for  2  (1.6%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  (influenza  and  osteomyelitis  in  1  subject 
each). No infection-related AEs led to discontinuation of investigational product. 
One  (0.8%)  subject  in  each  treatment  group  had  an  AE  of  hypersensitivity  (urticaria)  during  the 
double-blind treatment period 
There were no AEs of fracture in the saxagliptin group; 1 subject (0.8%) in the placebo group had an 
AE of rib fracture. 
One  (0.8%)  subject  in  the  saxagliptin  group  had  an  AE  of  pancreatitis.  No  subjects  in  the  placebo 
group experienced pancreatitis during the double-blind treatment period. 
One (0.8%) subject in the saxagliptin group and no subjects in the placebo group had AEs indicative of 
an acute cardiovascular event, that was considered to be severe and not related to study treatment.

Laboratory findings 
There  were  no  clinically  relevant  changes  from  baseline  noted  in  mean  haematology  values  in  either 
treatment group. 
There were no trends observed for either treatment group based on individual shifts from baseline for 
any  clinical  chemistry  parameter,  including  renal  function  as  assessed  by  CrCl  and  albumin:creatinine 
ratio. 
Laboratory abnormalities related to liver function were present in 1 saxagliptin treated and two placebo 
treated subjects. 
Vital signs 
There were no apparent treatment-related effects on vital signs noted in either treatment group. 
ECG abnormalities  
One  subject  in  the  saxagliptin  group  had  a  clinically  important  ECG  finding  (T-wave  inversion)  during 
the double-blind treatment period that was not present at baseline; this event was adjudicated and the 
final  adjudication  confirmed  that  there  were  non-specific  ST−T-wave  ECG  changes  compatible  with 
lanoxin therapy and no clinical evidence of myocardial Infarction. 
2.3.3.  Discussion 
Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of saxagliptin was comparable to that of placebo. There were no unexpected adverse 
events.  The  proportion  of  subjects  experiencing  any  AE  was  lower  in  the  saxagliptin  group  compared 
with the placebo group (62.8% and 71.7% in the saxagliptin and placebo groups, respectively; 59.7% 
and 69.5%, respectively, when hypoglycaemic events were excluded). 
There were no deaths during the study. 
No significant differences in SAEs were observed. 
The  incidence  of  AEs,  SAEs,  and  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  was  similar  between  the  2  treatment 
groups. 
Although the dose of SU was sufficiently high it is notable that the incidence of hypoglycaemic events in 
the saxagliptin triple therapy group, while higher than in the control group, remained low.  
Analysis of adverse events of special interest did not reveal unexpected adverse events. The incidence 
of  hypoglycaemic  AEs  was  low  in  both  treatment  groups  but  was  higher  in  the  saxagliptin  group 
compared with the placebo group (10.1% and 6.3%, respectively); only 2 subjects (saxagliptin group) 
had confirmed hypoglycaemia (symptomatic with fingerstick plasma glucose ≤2.8 mmol/L [50 mg/dL]). 
There were no apparent treatment-related effects on vital signs noted in either treatment group.

Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The  safety  and  tolerability  profile  of  saxagliptin  +  metformin  +  SU  was  similar  to  that  of  placebo  + 
metformin  +  SU.  The  proportion  of  subjects  experiencing  any  AE  was  62.8%  in  the  saxagliptin  group 
and  71.7%  in  the  placebo  group.  Most  common  affected  SOCs  were  infections  and  infestations 
(saxagliptin  26.4%,  placebo  34.4%),  gastrointestinal  disorders  (saxagliptin  18.6%,  placebo  18.0%), 
nervous  system  disorders  (saxagliptin  12.4%,  placebo  5.5%),  and  musculoskeletal  and  connective 
tissue  disorders  (saxagliptin  10.1%,  placebo  11.7%).  Nasopharyngitis  (6.2%,  diarrhoea  (5.4  %)  and 
hypertension  (5.4%)  were  the  most  common  AEs  in  the  saxagliptin  group,  whereas  nasopharyngitis 
(9.4%),  urinary  tract  infection  (6.3%)  and  dyslipidemia  (5.5%)  were  the  most  common  AEs  in  the 
placebo group. 
The incidence of hypoglycaemic AEs was low in both treatment groups but was higher in the saxagliptin 
group  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (10.1%  and  6.3%,  respectively);  only  2  subjects  (saxagliptin 
group)  had  confirmed  hypoglycaemia  (symptomatic  with  fingerstick  plasma  glucose  ≤2.8  mmol/L  [50 
mg/dL]).  
An AE of an acute cardiovascular event (carotid artery occlusion) was reported in 1 saxagliptin-treated 
subject. The event was judged to not be a cardiovascular event upon adjudication.  
One  subject  in  the  saxagliptin  group  had  a  clinically  important  ECG  finding  (T-wave  inversion)  during 
the  double-blind  treatment  period  compatible  with  digoxin  therapy  There  were  no  other  clinically 
relevant  changes  in  clinical  laboratory  values,  vital  signs,  or  ECGs.  No  indications  of  renal  or  other 
system impairments were reported throughout the study. 
Saxagliptin 5 mg administered as add-on therapy to metformin plus SU in subjects with T2DM was well 
tolerated with a safety profile comparable to placebo as add-on to metformin plus SU. 
2.4.  Risk management plan 
Based on the current Risk Management Plans (version 2 for Onglyza, version 3 for Komboglyze) the risk 
management systems were considered acceptable by CHMP. Only minor updates are required to the 
RMP.   
The MAH has agreed to include the minor updates required by CHMP to the RMP in the next RMP 
updates that will be submitted within three months following CHMP opinion of the current procedure, 
with the format and content of the updated RMP in line with the requirements of the new 
pharmacovigilance legislation, for which reference is made to GVP module V.

Onglyza 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Add-on combination therapy 
Onglyza is indicated in adult patients aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve 
glycaemic control: 
as dual oral therapy in combination with 
• 
• 
• 
in combination with metformin, when metformin alone, with diet and exercise, does not provide 
adequate glycaemic control.  
in combination with a sulphonylurea, when the sulphonylurea alone, with diet and exercise, does 
not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom use of metformin is considered 
inappropriate. 
in combination with a thiazolidinedione, when the thiazolidinedione alone with diet and exercise, 
does not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom use of a thiazolidinedione is 
considered appropriate. 
as triple oral therapy in combination with 
• 
metformin plus a sulphonylurea when this regimen alone, with diet and exercise, does not provide 
adequate glycaemic control  
in as combination therapy with insulin (with or without metformin), when this regimen alone, with diet 
and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Add-on combination therapy 
• 
The recommended dose of Onglyza is 5 mg once daily as add-on combination therapy with 
metformin, insulin, a thiazolidinedione or a sulphonylurea. Onglyza tablets must not be split or cut. 
When Onglyza is used in combination with insulin or a sulphonylurea, a lower dose of the insulin or 
sulphonylurea may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4). 
The safety and efficacy of saxagliptin as triple oral therapy in combination with metformin and a 
thiazolidinedione, or with metformin and a sulphonylurea, has not been established. 
. . . 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
. . . 
In  addition,  patients  should  be  alerted  to  the  risk  of  hypoglycaemia  when  Onglyza  is  used  in 
combination with other antidiabetic medicinal products known to cause 
hypoglycaemia (e.g. insulin, sulphonylureas).

. . . 
As add-on to metformin plus a sulphonylurea: dizziness (common), fatigue (common) and flatulence 
(common). 
Hypoglycaemia 
Adverse reactions of hypoglycaemia were based on all reports of hypoglycaemia; a concurrent glucose 
measurement was not required. 
When used as add-on combination therapy with metformin plus sulphonylurea, the overall incidence of 
reported hypoglycemia was 10.2 % for Onglyza 5 mg and 6.3% for placebo. 
When  used  as  add-on  to  insulin  (with  or  without  metformin),  the  overall  incidence  of  reported 
hypoglycaemia was 18.4% for Onglyza 5 mg and 19.9% for placebo. 
When used as add-on combination therapy with metformin plus sulphonylurea, the overall incidence of 
reported hypoglycemia was 10.2 % for Onglyza 5 mg and 6.3% for placebo. 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
. . . 
Saxagliptin add-on combination therapy with metformin and sulphonylurea  
A total of 257 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin (5 mg once daily) in 
combination with metformin plus sulphonylurea (SU) in patients with inadequate glycemic control 
(HbA1c ≥7% and ≤10%). Saxagliptin (n=127) provided significant improvements in HbA1c and PPG 
compared with the placebo (n=128).  The HbA1c change for saxagliptin compared to placebo  was 
-0.7% at Week 24.

Komboglyze 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
. .l. 
Komboglyze is also indicated in combination with a sulphonylurea (i.e., triple combination therapy) as 
an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adult patients aged 18 years and older 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus when the maximally tolerated dose of both metformin and the 
sulphonylurea does not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
4.3  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
. . . 
For patients inadequately controlled on dual combination therapy of a sulphonylurea and metformin, or 
for patients switching from triple combination therapy of saxagliptin, metformin and a sulphonylurea 
taken as separate tablets. 
The dose of Komboglyze should provide saxagliptin  2.5 mg twice daily (5 mg total daily dose), and a 
dose of metformin similar to the dose already being taken. When Komboglyze is used in combination 
with a sulphonylurea, a lower dose of the sulphonylurea may be required to reduce the risk of 
hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4). 
. . .  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
. . . 
Use with medicinal products known to cause hypoglycaemia 
Insulin and sulphonylureas are is known to cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or 
sulphonylurea may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with 
Komboglyze. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
. . . In addition, patients should be alerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia when Komboglyze is used in 
combination with other antidiabetic medicinal products known to cause hypoglycaemia (e.g. insulin, 
sulphonylureas). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
. . . 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
. . . 
As add-on to metformin and a sulphonylurea: dizziness (common), fatigue (common) and flatulence 
(common).

When used as add-on to metformin plus a sulphonylurea,  the overall incidence of reported 
hypoglycemia was 10.2 % for saxagliptin 5 mg and 6.3% for placebo. 
. . .  
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
. . . 
Saxagliptin add-on combination therapy with metformin and sulphonylurea  
A total of 257 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin (5 mg once daily) in 
combination with metformin plus sulphonylurea (SU) in patients with inadequate glycemic control 
(HbA1c ≥7% and ≤10%). Saxagliptin (n=127) provided significant improvements in HbA1c and PPG 
compared with the placebo (n=128).  The HbA1c change for saxagliptin compared to placebo  was 
-0.7% at Week 24.

3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
A study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin compared with placebo as add-
on  therapy  to  a  stable  metformin  dose  plus  a  stable  SU  dose  in  subjects  with  T2DM  who  have 
inadequate  glycaemic  control  (HbA1c  ≥7%  and  ≤10%).  Study  D1680L00006  was  a  24-week, 
multicenter,  randomized,  parallel-group,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  Phase  3b  study  in  257 
subjects. 
Saxagliptin  5  mg  added  to  a  stable  dose  of  metformin  plus  SU  was  superior  to  placebo  in  lowering 
HbA1c and 2-hour PPG from baseline to Week 24. In contrast with placebo for saxagliptin a reduction in 
HbA1c  from  baseline  was  observed  at  weeks  4,  8,  12  and  progressively  greater  to  week  16.  This 
reduction was maintained through week 24. 
The adjusted mean changes were -0.74% for the saxagliptin group and -0.08% for the placebo group, 
with  a  difference  versus  placebo  of  -0.66%  [2-sided  95%  CI,  -0.86%  to  -0.47%;  p<0.0001]  for 
saxagliptin). 
Secondary endpoints were in line with these results. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
 Uncertainties about a possible centre effect were addressed by the MAH with an analysis according to 
country in which the centres were located, which did not show any interaction. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
In general saxagliptin was well tolerated and there were no new unexpected adverse events. 
The  proportion  of  subjects  experiencing  any  treatment-related  AE  was  higher  in  the  saxagliptin  group 
compared  with  the  placebo  group  (16.3%  and  10.2%  in  the  saxagliptin  and  placebo  groups, 
respectively; 11.6% and 7.0%, respectively, when hypoglycaemic events were excluded). 
There were no deaths during the study.  
SAEs were reported in a total of 10 subjects: 3 (2.3%) subjects in the saxagliptin group. Of these, only 
1  SAE  (hepatitis)  was  considered  to  be  possibly  related  to  saxagliptin.  One  (0.8%)  subject  in  the 
saxagliptin  group  discontinued  due  to  an  AE  and  3  (2.3%)  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  discontinued 
due to an AE. 
The incidence of hypoglycaemic AEs was low in both treatment groups but was higher in the saxagliptin 
group  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (10.1%  and  6.3%,  respectively);  two  subjects  (saxagliptin 
group)  had  confirmed  hypoglycaemia  (symptomatic  with  fingerstick  plasma  glucose  ≤2.8  mmol/L  [50 
mg/dL]). 
Assessment report Komboglyze Onglyza WS-0295 
EMA/302364/2013 
Page 42/44 
  
  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
A relatively large number of subjects discontinued from this 24 weeks study. However, discontinuation 
was balanced between the saxagliptin group (12.4%) and the placebo group (11.7%). 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The  effect  on  HbA1c  of  saxagliptin  when  added  to  stable  doses  of  metformin  and  SU  is  an  important 
benefit. The difference with placebo in change from baseline (-0.66%) is clinically relevant. 
The incidence of hypoglycaemia was low in both groups, which is a benefit. 
In general saxagliptin was well tolerated and there were no new unexpected adverse events. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The  effect  of  adding  saxagliptin  to  ongoing  metformin  and  SU  on  HbA1c  is  demonstrated.  Treatment 
was associated with a small increase in hypoglycaemic events which can be expected. In a former study 
(CV181040), submitted with the MAA, adding saxagliptin to SU resulted in percentages hypoglycaemia 
of  14.6  in  the  saxagliptin  group  and  10.1%  in  the  placebo  group.  Results  in  the  current  study  are 
somewhat lower.  
Saxagliptin was well tolerated. 
Conclusion 
The  overall  B/R  of  saxagliptin  as  add-on  therapy  to  a  stable  metformin  dose  plus  a  stable  SU  dose  in 
subjects with T2DM who have inadequate glycaemic control is positive.

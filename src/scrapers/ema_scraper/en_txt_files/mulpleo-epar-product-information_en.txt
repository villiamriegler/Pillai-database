2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each film-coated tablet contains 3 mg of lusutrombopag. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Film-coated tablet. 
Light red, 7.0 mm round film-coated tablets debossed with the Shionogi trademark above the identifier 
code “551” on one side and debossed on the other side with the strength “3”. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Mulpleo is indicated for the treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver 
disease undergoing invasive procedures (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 3 mg lusutrombopag once daily for 7 days. 
The procedure should be performed from day 9 after the start of lusutrombopag treatment. Platelet 
count should be measured prior to the procedure. 
Missed dose 
If a dose is missed it should be taken as soon as possible. A double dose should not be taken to make 
up for a missed dose.  
Duration of treatment 
Mulpleo should not be taken for more than 7 days. 
Special populations 
Elderly  
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients 65 years of age or older (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Due to limited information available, the safety and efficacy of Mulpleo in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh class C) have not been established (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). No dose 
adjustment is expected for these patients. Lusutrombopag therapy should only be initiated in patients 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with severe hepatic impairment if the expected benefit outweighs the expected risks (see sections 4.4 
and 5.2). No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A) to moderate 
(Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment.  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of lusutrombopag in children and adolescents (< 18 years of age) have not 
been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Mulpleo is for oral use. The film-coated tablet is to be taken once daily with liquid, swallowed whole 
and should not be chewed, divided, or crushed. It can be taken with or without food. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Thrombotic/thromboembolic complications 
Patients with chronic liver disease have a risk of portal vein thrombosis and mesenteric vein 
thrombosis. The risk may be increased due to an invasive procedure. Thromboembolic and thrombotic 
complications are known to occur with thrombopoetin (TPO) receptor agonists based upon mechanism 
of action associated with increases in platelets. Caution should be exercised with respect to 
thromboembolic events after invasive procedures as well as post-treatment regardless of platelet 
counts. In patients with thrombosis or thromboembolism, with a history of thrombosis or 
thromboembolism, with absence of hepatopetal blood flow in the main trunk of the portal vein, or 
patients with congenital coagulopathy the risk for thrombosis or thromboembolism may increase. 
These patients should be clinically monitored when treated with lusutrombopag.  
Severe hepatic impairment 
There is limited information on the use of lusutrombopag in patients with severe (Child-Pugh class C) 
hepatic impairment (see section 5.1). Lusutrombopag should only be used in such patients if the 
expected benefit outweighs the expected risks  (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Due to the unstable nature of these patients, they should be supported in line with clinical practice by 
close monitoring for early signs of worsening or new onset hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and 
thrombotic or bleeding tendency, through monitoring of liver function tests, tests used for assessing 
clotting status and through imaging of portal vasculature as needed. In addition, although no dose 
adjustment is required in these subjects, platelet count should be measured at least once approximately 
5 days after the first dose and as necessary thereafter. Appropriate measures such as discontinuation of 
lusutrombopag should be taken, if the platelet count reaches ≥ 50 000/µL as a result of a 20 000/µL 
increase from baseline. 
Use in patients with chronic liver disease undergoing invasive procedures 
Lusutrombopag should be used when risk for bleeding is considered to be high according to clinical 
laboratory test values such as platelet counts and of the coagulation-fibrinolysis system, clinical 
symptoms and type of invasive procedure. The efficacy and safety of lusutrombopag have not been 
established when administered before laparotomy, thoracotomy, open-heart surgery, craniotomy or 
excision of organs.

Retreatment 
There is limited information on the use of lusutrombopag in patients previously exposed to 
lusutrombopag. 
Use in patients with a history of splenectomy  
The efficacy and safety of lusutrombopag have not been established when administered in patients 
with a history of splenectomy. Platelet count should be carefully monitored in patients with a history 
of splenectomy treated with lusutrombopag. 
Co-administration with interferon preparations 
Interferon preparations have been known to reduce platelet counts, therefore, this should be considered 
when co-administering lusutrombopag with interferon preparations. 
Patients with body weight < 45 kg 
There is limited information on the use of lusutrombopag in patients with body weight < 45 kg. 
Platelet count should be measured at least once approximately 5 days after the first dose and as 
necessary thereafter. Appropriate measures such as discontinuation of lusutrombopag should be taken, 
if the platelet count reaches ≥ 50 000/µL as a result of a 20 000/µL increase from baseline. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
P-gp and BCRP inhibitors 
Lusutrombopag is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, but not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and 
OCT1. In the clinical drug-drug interaction study, co-administration of cyclosporine, a P-gp and 
BCRP dual inhibitor, increased the Cmax and AUCinf values of lusutrombopag by approximately 20% 
compared with lusutrombopag administration alone. Therefore, a potential interaction with either P-gp 
or BCRP inhibitors cannot be excluded, but no dose adjustment is necessary at the recommended 
clinical dose of 3 mg in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/contraception 
Mulpleo should be used with contraception (see sub-section Pregnancy and section 5.3). 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of lusutrombopag in pregnant women. Animal 
studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Lusutrombopag is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of child-bearing potential not 
using contraception.  
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether lusutrombopag or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Studies in 
animals have shown lusutrombopag is secreted in the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). 
Therefore, a risk to the breast-feeding child cannot be excluded. Mulpleo should not be administered 
to breast-feeding women as it was excreted in mammary milk in animals.

Fertility 
Lusutrombopag did not affect male or female fertility in rats at doses up to 176 and 252 times the 
human clinical exposures in adults based on AUC in males and females, respectively (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Lusutrombopag has no known influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse reactions were headache (4.7%, 8/171 patients in the lusutrombopag 
group; 3.5%, 6/170 patients in the placebo group), nausea (2.3%, 4/171 patients in the lusutrombopag 
group; 4.1%, 7/170 patients in the placebo group), portal vein thrombosis (1.2%, 2/171 patients in the 
lusutrombopag group; 1.2%, 2/170 patients in the placebo group) and rash (1.2%, 2/171 patients in the 
lusutrombopag group; 0%, 0/170 patients in the placebo group). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions with 3 mg of lusutrombopag once daily for up to 7 days in randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trials in thrombocytopenic patients with chronic liver disease undergoing an 
invasive procedure (M0626, M0631 and M0634; N=171) are listed in Table 1 by MedDRA System 
Organ Class.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Thrombotic/thromboembolic complications 
Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in Phase 3 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
clinical studies with 3 mg of lusutrombopag once daily for up to 7 days (1.2%, 2/171 patients); the 
incidence was comparable to that of the placebo group (1.2%, 2/170 patients); one case of cardiac 
ventricular thrombosis was reported (0.6%, 1/171) in the lusutrombopag group only. In the phase 2b 
study one patient had portal vein thrombosis reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) 
in the lusutrombopag 2 mg and 4 mg groups. One patient had mesenteric vein thrombosis reported as a 
TEAE in the lusutrombopag 4 mg group; two patients had mesenteric vein thrombosis reported as a 
TEAE in the placebo group (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
Overdose may induce an excessive increase of platelet counts, and it may subsequently provoke a 
medically susceptible state to cause thrombosis and thromboembolism. There is no specific antidote 
for lusutrombopag overdose. Platelet counts should be measured frequently and the condition of 
patients should be observed closely. Since the protein-binding rate in serum of lusutrombopag is high, 
haemodialysis is not thought to be effective. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antihemorrhagics, other systemic hemostatics, ATC code: B02BX07 
Mechanism of action 
Lusutrombopag is an orally active TPO receptor agonist. Lusutrombopag acts on the haematopoietic 
stem cells and on the transmembrane domain of human TPO receptors expressed in megakaryocytes, 
to stimulate the megakaryocyte to proliferate and differentiate via the similar signal transduction 
pathway for up-regulating production used by endogenous TPO, thus leading to thrombocytopoiesis.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Two Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted to evaluate 
lusutrombopag versus placebo in thrombocytopenic (platelet count < 50 000/µL) subjects with chronic 
liver disease (Child-Pugh class A and B), undergoing elective invasive procedures (excluding 
laparotomy, thoracotomy, craniotomy, open-heart surgery, organ resection, or partial organ resection) 
in Japan (M0631 (L-PLUS 1)) and multiple countries (M0634 (L-PLUS 2)). Subjects were randomised 
to either of 3 mg of lusutrombopag or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation was stratified by platelet 
count at screening/baseline and primary invasive procedure. The study treatment was administered 
orally for up to 7 days. On Day 5 to Day 7, the platelet count was measured before administration of 
study drug. Administration of study drug was stopped if the platelet count was ≥ 50 000/µL together 
with an increase of ≥ 20 000/µL from baseline. 
Invasive procedure was performed between Days 9 and 14. 
In Study M0631, 96 subjects received lusutrombopag or placebo once daily: 48 subjects in the 
lusutrombopag group and 48 subjects in the placebo group. Eight lusutrombopag-treated subjects and 
2 placebo-treated subjects received less than 7 days of treatment as they met the criterion for a 
responder prior to Day 7. Among the 48 subjects in the lusutrombopag group, 40 subjects received 
lusutrombopag for 7 days, 4 subjects for 6 days, 1 subject for 5 days, and 3 subjects for 4 days. Among 
the 48 subjects in the placebo group, 46 were treated for 7 days and 2 were treated for 4 days. 
In Study M0634, 215 subjects were randomised in the study: 108 in the lusutrombopag 3 mg group 
and 107 in the placebo group. One subject in the lusutrombopag group withdrew from the study prior 
to administration of study drug. In the lusutrombopag group, 73/107 subjects (68.2%) received the 
study drug for 7 days. Of the remaining subjects in the lusutrombopag group, 15, 8, and 11 subjects 
received study drug for 4, 5, and 6 days, respectively. In the placebo group, 94/107 subjects (87.9%) 
received the study drug for 7 days. Of the remaining subjects in the placebo group, 5, 4, and 4 subjects 
received study drug for 4, 5, and 6 days, respectively. 
The primary endpoint in Study M0631 was the proportion of subjects who required no platelet 
transfusion (i.e. achieved platelet count > 50 000/µL) before the primary invasive procedure. The 
primary endpoint in Study M0634 was the proportion of subjects who required no platelet transfusion 
(i.e. achieved platelet count > 50 000/µL) before the primary invasive procedure and no rescue therapy 
for bleeding from randomisation through 7 days after the primary invasive procedure.

In order to allow an overall comparison of the results across Studies M0631 and M0634, as presented 
in Table 2 to Table 5, data from study M0631 was reanalysed according to the primary endpoint for 
study M0634. The proportion of subjects who required no platelet transfusion prior to the primary 
invasive procedure and no rescue therapy for bleeding from randomisation through 7 days after the 
primary invasive procedure was statistically significantly greater in the lusutrombopag group 
compared with placebo group for the individual study and pooled analyses (Table 2).

Patients with severe hepatic impairment 
In Study M0634, 3 subjects with Child-Pugh class C liver disease were erroneously enrolled (all in the 
lusutrombopag group). All 3 received 7 days of treatment with lusutrombopag. This limited data 
suggested no abnormal pattern of platelet count rise in this subpopulation. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Mulpleo in all subsets of the paediatric population for thrombocytopenia secondary to liver disease 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Lusutrombopag is absorbed with a peak concentration occurring 6 to 8 hours after oral administration. 
The accumulation ratios of the Cmax and the AUC are approximately 2 at once-daily multiple doses and 
the steady-state of the plasma concentration of lusutrombopag appear to be achieved after Day 5. The 
pharmacokinetics of lusutrombopag was similar in both healthy subjects and the chronic liver disease 
population. The pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with chronic liver disease are shown in 
Table 6.

Food interaction 
Neither food (including high-fat and high-calorie diet) nor co-administration with calcium has a 
clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of lusutrombopag. 
Distribution 
Human plasma protein binding ratio is ≥ 99.9%. The mean (% coefficient of variation) apparent 
volume of distribution during the terminal phase of lusutrombopag in healthy adult subjects (n = 16) 
was 39.5 L (23.5%).  
In rats, results indicated that lusutrombopag and its metabolites transfer to fetus via placenta. 
Biotransformation  
Lusutrombopag is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, but is not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or 
OCT1. In the human mass balance study using [14C]-lusutrombopag, unchanged lusutrombopag (97% 
of radioactivity in plasma) was the major circulating component, and the metabolites, such as 
deshexyl, β-oxidated carboxylic acid, taurine conjugate of β-oxidated carboxylic acid, and acyl-
glucuronide, were detected with less than 2.6% of radioactivity in plasma. In faeces, the components 
of radioactivity were unchanged lusutrombopag (16% of administered radioactivity) and β-oxidation-
related metabolites (35% of administered radioactivity), suggesting that lusutrombopag is metabolised 
by ω-oxidation first, and subsequently metabolised by β-oxidation of O-hexyl side chain. In vitro 
studies revealed that CYP4 enzymes including CYP4A11 and partially CYP3A4 enzyme contributed 
to ω-oxidation to form 6-hydroxylated lusutrombopag. Drug interactions via inhibition and induction 
of any CYP4A enzymes have not been reported in clinical use. Therefore, inducers and inhibitors of 
CYP4A enzymes including CYP4A11 are unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of lusutrombopag.  
Lusutrombopag has low potential to inhibit CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 
2D6, and 3A4/5), and to induce both CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, 2C9, and 3A4) and UGT enzymes 
(UGT1A2, 1A6, and 2B7). Lusutrombopag has also low potential to inhibit P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, MATE2-K, and BSEP. Lusutrombopag is not 
considered to affect the pharmacokinetics of co-administered medicinal products that are substrates of 
these enzymes or transporters. 
Elimination 
Lusutrombopag was excreted mainly via faecal route in humans (approximately 83% into faeces and 
1% into urine). 
Geometric mean of t1/2 (% coefficient of variation), was 38.3 hours (18.7%) after multiple oral dose of 
3 mg lusutrombopag.  
Linearity/non-linearity  
Both Cmax and AUC for lusutrombopag increase dose-proportionally over dose range of multiple oral 
dose of 0.25 to 4 mg once daily in patients with chronic liver disease.

Pharmacokinetics in subpopulations  
Age, gender and race 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis using plasma lusutrombopag concentrations from clinical 
studies with lusutrombopag did not identify a clinically meaningful effect of age, gender or race on the 
pharmacokinetics of lusutrombopag. 
Paediatric population 
No pharmacokinetic data have been obtained in children. 
Renal impairment 
Lusutrombopag is rarely excreted into urine (approximately 1%). A population pharmacokinetic 
analysis using plasma lusutrombopag concentrations from clinical studies with lusutrombopag did not 
identify a clinically meaningful effect of renal function on the pharmacokinetics of lusutrombopag. 
Hepatic impairment 
Mild and moderate hepatic impairment (mild, Child-Pugh class A; moderate, Child-Pugh class B) is 
expected to have little effect on the pharmacokinetics of lusutrombopag. The differences in 
pharmacokinetics of a single 0.75 mg dose of lusutrombopag were relatively small in both subjects 
with mild hepatic impairment and subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, compared with the 
healthy matched control group. Ratios of AUC relative to the healthy matched control group were 1.05 
in subjects with mild hepatic impairment and 1.20 in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. 
The ranges of observed Cmax and AUC0-τ overlapped among the patients with Child-Pugh class A, B, 
and C. Cmax and AUC0-τ of all patients with Child-Pugh class C did not exceed the maximum values 
from Child-Pugh class A and class B. Due to the limited information available, lusutrombopag should 
not be used in Child-Pugh class C patients unless the expected benefit outweighs the expected risks.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Lusutrombopag does not stimulate platelet production in the species used for toxicological testing 
because of unique human TPO receptor specificity. Thus, the data from the toxicology program in 
these animals do not present potential adverse events related to exaggerated pharmacology in humans. 
Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the 
maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. 
In rats, lusutrombopag and its metabolites are excreted in milk, and the concentrations in milk 
decreased as with those in plasma. 
Repeated toxicity 
The principal toxicity findings associated with lusutrombopag administration included prolongation of 
PT and APTT (rats), increased activities of plasma ALT and AST (rats and dogs), adrenal toxicity 
(rats and dogs), skin and forestomach lesions (rats) and renal toxicity (rats). 
High dose (10 mg/kg/day) and long-term treatment (8 weeks) of lusutrombopag has a potential risk of 
fibrosis in the bone marrow via human TPO receptor based on the results of study in TPOR-Ki/Shi 
mice with chimeric human transmembrane domain TPO receptor knocked-in to the mouse TPO 
receptor.  
Carcinogenesis 
Lusutrombopag was not carcinogenic to mice at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day in males and females (a 
dose at least 45 times the human clinical exposures in adults based on AUC), or rats at doses up to 
20 mg/kg/day in males and 2 mg/kg/day in females (a dose 49 and 30 times, respectively, the human 
clinical exposures in adults based on AUC). 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mutagenesis 
Lusutrombopag was not genotoxic when tested in a bacterial reverse mutation test, a chromosomal 
aberration test with cultured Chinese hamster lung cells, or an in vivo micronucleus test with mouse 
bone marrow cells. 
Fertility 
Lusutrombopag did not affect male and female fertility and early embryo development in rats at doses 
up to 100 mg/kg/day (176 and 252 times respectively, the human clinical exposures in adults based on 
AUC). 
Embryo-foetal development 
Lusutrombopag showed no teratogenicity in rats and rabbits at up to 80 mg/kg/day and  
1 000 mg/kg/day respectively. No effects on foetal viability embryo-foetal development were noted in 
rabbits at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (161 times the human clinical exposures in adults based on 
AUC). In rats, there were adverse effects of lusutrombopag on foetal intrauterine growth and skeletal 
morphology as follows: a suppression of foetal intrauterine growth (low foetal body weight and a 
decrease in the number of ossified sternebrae) at 80 mg/kg/day, and an high incidence of short cervical 
supernumerary ribs at 40 mg/kg/day or more, and an high incidence of short thoracolumbar 
supernumerary rib at 4 mg/kg/day or more. A suppression of foetal intrauterine growth as well as 
cervical ribs occurred at doses (40 mg/kg/day or more), showing maternal toxicity. Meanwhile, the 
short thoracolumbar supernumerary ribs were observed at doses without maternal toxicity. The 
changes were also noted in F1 pups on postnatal day (PND) 4 at 12.5 mg/kg/day or more in the pre- 
and postnatal development study; however, F1 mature animals showed no full and short 
thoracolumbar supernumerary rib. On the basis of the results, the no observed adverse effect level 
(NOAEL) was estimated to be near 4 mg/kg/day in the embryo-foetal development study in rats 
(23 times the human clinical exposures in adults based on AUC). 
Pre- and post-natal development 
In the pre- and postnatal development study in rats at doses up to 40 mg/kg/day, there were adverse 
effects of lusutrombopag on postnatal development at 40 mg/kg/day as follow: prolongation of 
gestation period in dams, low viability before weaning, delayed postnatal growth such as delayed 
negative geotaxis or delayed eyelid opening, low pup body weight, low female fertility index, a 
tendency to low number of corpora lutea or implantations, and a tendency to increased pre-
implantation loss rate and an abnormal clinical sign such as prominent annular rings on tail after 
weaning. There were no effects on pregnancy, parturition, lactation in F0 dams and postnatal 
development in F1 pups at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day (89 times the human clinical exposures in 
adults based on AUC). 
Phototoxicity 
Lusutrombopag has no phototoxic potential in the skin phototoxicity study in hairless mice at doses up 
to 500 mg/kg (96.3 µg/mL) (613 times the human clinical exposures in adults based on Cmax 
[0.157 µg/mL]). 
Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) 
Environmental risk assessment studies have shown that lusutrombopag has the potential to be very 
persistent, very bioaccumulative and toxic to the environment.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Mulpleo is and what it is used for 
Mulpleo contains the active substance lusutrombopag, which belongs to a group of medicines called 
thrombopoietin receptor agonists. The medicine helps to increase the number of platelets in your 
blood. Platelets are blood components that help the blood to clot and so prevent bleeding. 
Mulpleo is used to reduce the risk of bleeding during surgery and other procedures (including 
tooth extractions and endoscopy). It is given to adults who have low numbers of platelets because of 
chronic liver disease. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Mulpleo  
Do not take Mulpleo: 
- 
if you are allergic to lusutrombopag or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6 under ‘What Mulpleo contains’).  
➤ Check with your doctor if this applies to you before you take Mulpleo 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you are at risk of blood clots in your veins or arteries, or if you previously have had blood 
clots

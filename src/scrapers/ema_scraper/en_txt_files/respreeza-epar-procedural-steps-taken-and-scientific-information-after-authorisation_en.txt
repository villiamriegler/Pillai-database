The MAH took the opportunity to correct a technical 
publishing error occurred in the dossier section 
2.3.A.1., with eCTD Sequence 0093. The product 
related 2.3.A.1 was mistakenly replaced with the 
2.3.A.1 concerning the solvent water for injections 
manufactured at CSL Behring LLC. With the current 
submission this error is corrected by replacing the 
2.3.A.1 introduced with the eCTD Sequence 0093 
with the 2.3.A.1 from the eCTD sequence 0081. 
Thereby reintroducing the missing product related 
2.3.A.1. The content has not changed. The MAH also 
took the opportunity to introduce some editorial 
changes to section 3.2.A.1.  
Regarding the Product Information the specific 
material type of the rubber stopper stated in section 
6.5. of the SmPC is changed from 
chlorobutyl/bromobutyl to “butyl”.

nausea and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to add 
information from final study report for study 
CE1226_3001. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation 
holder (MAH) took the opportunity to align the 
section 4.4 of the SmPC with the RMP on 
hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions due to 
traces of IgA. Furthermore, the PI has been aligned 
to SmPC guideline.

randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center 
study (RAPID) followed by a 2-year open-label extension 
study (RAPID extension study).  One-hundred forty 
subjects (76 Respreeza-treated subjects and 64 subjects 
treated with placebo in the RAPID Study) continued into the 
RAPID extension study and were treated with a weekly 60 
mg / kg bw intravenous dose of Respreeza for up to 24 
months. The RAPID extension study demonstrated that the 
reduced rate in lung density decline was maintained for 
subjects continuously treated with Respreeza for 4 years.

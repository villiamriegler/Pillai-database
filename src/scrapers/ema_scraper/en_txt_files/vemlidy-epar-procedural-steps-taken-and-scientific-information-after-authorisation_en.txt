Patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min 
The use of Vemlidy once daily in patients with 
CrCl ≥ 15 mL/min and < 30 mL/min is based on 
Week 96 data on the efficacy and safety of 
switching from another antiviral regimen to 
tenofovir alafenamide in an open label clinical 
study of virologically suppressed chronic HBV-
infected patients (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).  
There are very limited data on the safety and 
efficacy of Vemlidy in HBV-infected patients with 
CrCl < 15 mL/min on chronic haemodialysis (see 
sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2).

In the open-label Phase 2 study (GS-US-320-
4035; “Study 4035”) to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of switching from another antiviral 
regimen to tenofovir alafenamide in virologically 
suppressed chronic HBV infected patients, small 
median increases in fasting total cholesterol, 
direct LDL, HDL, and triglycerides from baseline 
to Week 96 were observed in subjects with 
moderate or severe renal impairment (Part A 
Cohort 1) and subjects with moderate or severe 
hepatic impairment (Part B), consistent with 
changes observed in Studies 108 and 110. Small 
median decreases in total cholesterol, LDL and 
triglycerides were observed in subjects with 
ESRD on hemodialysis in Part A Cohort 2, while 
small median increases were observed in HDL 
from baseline to Week 96. Median (Q1, Q3) 
change from baseline at Week 96 in total 
cholesterol to HDL ratio was 0.1 (-0.4, 0.4) in 
the moderate or severe renal impairment group, 
and -0.4 (-0.8,-0.1) in subjects with ESRD on 
hemodialysis and 0.1 (-0.2, 0.4) in subjects with 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment.

The results showed that at Week 48, switching 
information on safety and pharmacodynamic 
properties based on the final report from study GS-
US-320-4018, listed as a category 3 study in the 
RMP. This was a phase 3, randomized, double blind 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of switching 
from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg once daily 
to tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg once daily in 
subjects with chronic hepatitis B who are virologically 
suppressed. The RMP (v 8.0) has also been 
submitted. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission

to tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg once daily was 
non-inferior to continued treatment with 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg in patients 
with chronic hepatitis B that were virologically 
suppressed.  
The clinical virology data at Week 96 did not 
implicate a higher risk for the development of 
resistance or virological failure for subjects 
switching from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to 
tenofovir alafenamide. 
At Week 96, increases in fasting total 
cholesterol, direct LDL, HDL and triglycerides 
were observed in patients who switched from 
tenofovir disoproxil to tenofovir alafenamide at 
Week 48.

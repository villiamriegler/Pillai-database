CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1  Therapeutic indications
ProQuad is indicated for simultaneous vaccination against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella in
individuals from 12 months of age.
ProQuad can be administered to individuals from 9 months of age under special circumstances (e.g.,
to conform with national vaccination schedules, outbreak situations, or travel to a region with high
prevalence of measles; see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1).
2
 
4.2  Posology and method of administration
Posology
ProQuad should be used in accordance to official recommendations.
Individuals 12 months of age and older
Individuals from 12 months of age should receive two doses of ProQuad or a single dose of
ProQuad followed by a second dose of a monovalent varicella vaccine to ensure optimal
protection against varicella (see section 5.1). At least one month must elapse between the first
and second dose of any live viral attenuated vaccine. It is preferred that the second dose be
administered within three months following the first dose.
Individuals between 9 and 12 months of age
Immunogenicity and safety data show that ProQuad can be administered to individuals between
9 and 12 months of age, under special circumstances (e.g., in accordance with official
recommendations or when early protection is considered necessary). In such cases, individuals
should receive a second dose of ProQuad, given a minimum of 3 months apart, to ensure
optimal protection against measles and varicella (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Individuals less than 9 months of age
ProQuad is not indicated in this subset of the paediatric population. The safety and efficacy of
ProQuad in children under 9 months of age have not been established. 
ProQuad may be used as the second dose in individuals who have previously received measles,
mumps, and rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine.
Method of administration
The vaccine is to be injected intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC).
The preferred injection sites are the anterolateral area of the thigh in younger children and the deltoid
area in older children, adolescents, and adults.
The vaccine should be administered subcutaneously in patients with thrombocytopenia or any
coagulation disorder. 
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product: see section 6.6.
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
The vaccine should under no circumstances be injected intravascularly.
4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to any varicella vaccine or measles, mumps, or rubella vaccine or to any of the
excipients listed in section 6.1, including neomycin (see sections 2 and 4.4).
Blood dyscrasias, leukaemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the
haematopoietic and lymphatic system.
Current immunosuppressive therapy (including high doses of corticosteroids) (see section 4.8).
ProQuad is not contraindicated in individuals who are receiving topical or low-dose parenteral
corticosteroids (e.g. for asthma prophylaxis or replacement therapy).
3
 

 

 

 
Severe humoral or cellular (primary or acquired) immunodeficiency, e.g., severe combined
immunodeficiency, agammaglobulinemia and AIDS or symptomatic HIV infection or an age-specific
CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage in children below 12 months: CD4+ <25%, children between 12-35
months: CD4+ <20%; children between 36-59 months: CD4+ <15% (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
In severely immunocompromised individuals inadvertently vaccinated with measles-containing
vaccine, measles inclusion body encephalitis, pneumonitis, and fatal outcome as a direct consequence
of disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported.
Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of the
potential vaccine recipient is demonstrated.
Active untreated tuberculosis. Children under treatment for tuberculosis have not experienced
exacerbation of the disease when immunized with live measles virus vaccine. No studies have been
reported to date on the effect of measles virus vaccines on children with untreated tuberculosis.
Vaccination should be postponed during any illness with fever >38.5 C.
Pregnancy. Furthermore, pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following vaccination (see
section 4.6).
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare
anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine.
Additionally, live measles vaccine and live mumps vaccine are produced in chick embryo cell culture.
Persons with a history of anaphylactic, anaphylactoid, or other immediate reactions (e.g. hives,
swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or shock) subsequent to egg
ingestion may be at an enhanced risk of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions. The potential
risk-to-benefit ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering vaccination in such cases.
Due caution should be employed in the administration of ProQuad to persons with individual or
family history of convulsions, or a history of cerebral injury. The physician should be alert to the
temperature elevation that may occur following vaccination (see section 4.8).
Individuals less than 12 months of age who are vaccinated with a measles-containing vaccine during
measles outbreaks or for other reasons may fail to respond to the vaccine due to the presence of
circulating antibodies of maternal origin and/or immaturity of the immune system (see sections 4.2
and 5.1).
Vaccine recipients should avoid use of salicylates for 6 weeks after vaccination with ProQuad as Reye
syndrome has been reported following the use of salicylates during wild-type varicella infection.
Vaccination with ProQuad may not result in protection in all vaccine recipients.
Transmission
Excretion of small amounts of the live attenuated rubella virus from the nose or throat has occurred in
the majority of susceptible individuals 7 to 28 days after vaccination. There is no confirmed evidence
to indicate that such virus is transmitted to susceptible persons who are in contact with the vaccinated
individuals. Consequently, transmission through close personal contact, while accepted as a
theoretical possibility, is not regarded as a significant risk; however, transmission of the rubella
4
 
vaccine virus to infants via breast milk has been documented without any evidence of clinical disease
(see section 4.6).
There are no reports of transmission of the more attenuated Enders’ Edmonston strain of measles virus
or the Jeryl Lynn™ strain of mumps virus from vaccine recipients to susceptible contacts.
Post-marketing experience suggests that transmission of varicella vaccine virus (Oka/Merck strain)
resulting in varicella infection including disseminated disease may rarely occur between vaccine
recipients (who develop or do not develop a varicella-like rash) and contacts susceptible to varicella
including healthy as well as high-risk individuals (see section 4.8).
High-risk individuals susceptible to varicella include:
• 
• 
• 
immunocompromised individuals (see section 4.3),
pregnant women without documented positive history of varicella (chickenpox) or laboratory
evidence of prior infection,
newborn infants of mothers without documented positive history of varicella or laboratory
evidence of prior infection.
Vaccine recipients should attempt to avoid, whenever possible, close association with high-risk
individuals susceptible to varicella for up to 6 weeks following vaccination. In circumstances where
contact with high-risk individuals susceptible to varicella is unavoidable, the potential risk of
transmission of the varicella vaccine virus should be weighed against the risk of acquiring and
transmitting wild-type varicella virus.
Thrombocytopenia
This vaccine should be given subcutaneously to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any
coagulation disorder because bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration in these
individuals.
In clinical trials, no cases were reported regarding the development or worsening of thrombocytopenia
in individuals vaccinated with ProQuad. Cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported in post-
marketing experience after primary vaccination with ProQuad. In addition, cases of thrombocytopenia
have been reported after primary vaccination or revaccination with measles vaccine; measles, mumps,
and rubella vaccine; and varicella vaccine. Post-marketing experience with live measles, mumps, and
rubella vaccine indicates that individuals with current thrombocytopenia may develop more severe
thrombocytopenia following vaccination. In addition, individuals who experienced thrombocytopenia
following the first dose of a live measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine may develop thrombocytopenia
with repeat doses. Serologic status may be evaluated to determine whether or not additional doses of
vaccine are needed. The risk-to-benefit ratio should be carefully evaluated before considering
vaccination with ProQuad in such cases (see section 4.8).
Febrile seizures
In the 5- to 12-day timeframe after the administration of the first dose of quadrivalent measles,
mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines in children, an increased risk of febrile seizure was observed
compared to concomitant administration of measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccines (see
sections 4.8 and 5.1).
Other
Vaccination may be considered in patients with selected immune deficiencies where the benefits
outweigh the risks (asymptomatic HIV patients, IgG subclass deficiencies, congenital neutropenia,
chronic granulomatous disease, and complement deficiency diseases).
Immunocompromised patients who have no contraindication for this vaccination (see section 4.3) may
not respond as well as immunocompetent patients; therefore, some of these patients may acquire
5
 
 
measles, mumps, rubella, or varicella in case of contact, despite appropriate vaccine administration.
These patients should be monitored carefully for signs of measles, parotitis, rubella, and varicella.
Post-exposure prophylaxis
No clinical data are available for ProQuad administered after exposure to measles, mumps, rubella, or
varicella. However, post-exposure prophylaxis for varicella and measles has been demonstrated with
Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles-containing vaccines manufactured by Merck &
Co., Inc., respectively.
Sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose and is considered to be
essentially sodium-free.
Potassium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (39 mg) potassium per dose and is considered to be
essentially potassium-free.
Sorbitol
The additive effect of concomitantly administered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and
dietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) should be taken into account.
Interference with laboratory tests: see section 4.5.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
At least 1 month should elapse between receipt of a live virus vaccine and ProQuad.
Vaccine recipients should avoid use of salicylates for 6 weeks after vaccination with ProQuad (see
section 4.4).
Do not give immunoglobulin (IG) or Varicella-Zoster Immune Globulin (VZIG) concomitantly with
ProQuad.
Administration of immune globulins concomitantly with ProQuad may interfere with the expected
immune response. Vaccination should be deferred for at least 3 months following blood or plasma
transfusions, or administration of immune globulins (IG). However, the appropriate suggested interval
between transfusion or IG administration and vaccination will vary with the type of transfusion or
indication for, and dose of, IG (e.g. 5 months for VZIG).
Administration of varicella zoster virus antibody-containing blood products, including VZIG or other
immune globulin preparations, within 1 month following a dose of ProQuad may reduce the immune
response to the vaccine and hence reduce its protective efficacy. Therefore, administration of any of
these products should be avoided within 1 month after a dose of ProQuad unless considered to be
essential.
It has been reported that live attenuated measles, mumps and rubella virus vaccines given individually
may result in a temporary depression of tuberculin skin sensitivity. Therefore, if a tuberculin test is to
be done, it should be administered either any time before, simultaneously with, or at least 4 to 6 weeks
after immunization with ProQuad.
Concomitant use with other vaccines:
Clinical studies have demonstrated that ProQuad can be given simultaneously (but at separate
injection sites) with Prevenar and/or hepatitis A vaccine, or with monovalent or combination vaccines
comprised of diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, inactivated
poliomyelitis, or hepatitis B antigen. In these clinical studies, it was demonstrated that the immune
6
 
responses were unaffected. The safety profiles of the administered vaccines were comparable (see
section 4.8).
There are insufficient data to support the use of ProQuad with any other vaccines.
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
Pregnant women should not be vaccinated with ProQuad.
Studies have not been conducted with ProQuad in pregnant women. It is not known whether ProQuad
can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or affect reproduction capacity.
Pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following vaccination. Women who intend to become
pregnant should be advised to delay.
Breast-feeding
Studies have shown that breast-feeding postpartum women vaccinated with live attenuated rubella
vaccine may secrete the virus in breast milk and transmit it to breast-fed infants. In the infants with
serological evidence of rubella infection, none had symptomatic disease. There is no evidence that
varicella vaccine virus is excreted in breast milk. It is not known whether measles or mumps vaccine
virus is secreted in human milk. Therefore, caution should be exercised when considering whether to
administer ProQuad to a breast-feeding woman.
Fertility
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with ProQuad. ProQuad has not been evaluated
for potential to impair fertility.
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive or use machinery have been performed. ProQuad is
expected to have no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8  Undesirable effects 
a. Summary of the safety profile
In 5 clinical trials, ProQuad was administered without concomitant vaccines to 6038 children 12
through 23 months of age. The children in these studies received either the current refrigerator-stable
formulation or an earlier formulation of ProQuad. Children in these studies were monitored for six
weeks post vaccination. The safety profiles were comparable for the two different formulations after a
single dose. The only vaccine-related systemic adverse reactions reported at a significantly greater
rate in individuals who received the earlier formulation of ProQuad compared to individuals who
received the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. and Varicella
Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) were fever (≥39.4°C rectal equivalent or abnormal) and measles-like rash.
Both fever and measles-like rash usually occurred within 5 to 12 days following the vaccination, were
of short duration and resolved with no long-term sequelae. Pain/tenderness/soreness at the injection
site was reported at a statistically lower rate in individuals who received ProQuad.
The only vaccine related injection site adverse reaction that was more frequent among recipients of
ProQuad than among recipients of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and
rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co. Inc. was rash at the injection site.
Following ProQuad given alone in 7 clinical trials, the observed rates of fever (≥39.4°C rectal
equivalent) ranged from 10.1% to 39.4%. In comparison, following ProQuad given concomitantly
7
 
with Prevenar and/or hepatitis A vaccine in 3 clinical trials, the observed rates of reported fever
(≥39.4°C rectal equivalent) ranged from 15.2% to 27.2%. 
In a clinical trial of ProQuad administered concomitantly with Infanrix Hexa, the rates of fever
(≥38.0°C rectal equivalent) were 69.3% following concomitant administration, 61.1% following
ProQuad alone, and 57.3% following Infanrix Hexa alone; the rates of fever (≥39.4°C rectal
equivalent) were 22.6% following concomitant administration, 20.5% following ProQuad alone, and
15.9% following Infanrix Hexa alone.
The overall safety profile of ProQuad was comparable whether it was administered concomitantly or
alone.
Children who received a second dose of ProQuad
In eight clinical studies, the overall rates of adverse reactions after a second dose of ProQuad were
generally similar to, or lower than, those seen with the first dose. In three of these studies, the rates of
injection site erythema and swelling were statistically significantly higher after the second dose than
after the first dose; however, in the remaining five studies, the rates of each of these reactions were
similar after the first and second dose. The fever rate in all eight studies was lower after the second
dose than after the first dose.
Children who received ProQuad intramuscularly
The general safety profiles of the IM and SC administration routes were comparable; however, fewer
subjects experienced injection site adverse reactions in the IM group after each dose (see section 5.1
for study description).
Children who received ProQuad at 4 through 6 years of age after primary immunization with
Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by
Merck & Co., Inc.
The rates and types of adverse reactions seen in the study group that received ProQuad were generally
similar to those seen in the groups that received Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles,
mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. (see section 5.1 for study
description).
No specific studies have been conducted in individuals from 2 years of age who had not previously
received measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines.
The most common adverse events reported with the use of ProQuad were: injection site reactions
including pain/tenderness/soreness, redness, swelling or bruising; fever (≥39.4°C rectal equivalent);
irritability; rash (including measles-like rash, varicella-like rash, and injection site rash); upper
respiratory infection; vomiting and diarrhoea.
b. Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The following adverse reactions were reported as vaccine related by the investigator in individuals
after a single dose of ProQuad. Several adverse events were solicited in the clinical studies and are
designated with the symbol (‡). Additionally, other adverse events have been reported with post-
marketing use of ProQuad and/or in clinical studies and post-marketing use of either the measles,
mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., the monovalent component vaccines
of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc., or Varicella Vaccine
live (Oka/Merck). The frequency of these adverse events is qualified as "not known" when it cannot
be estimated based on the available data.

c. Description of selected adverse reactions
Aseptic meningitis
Cases of aseptic meningitis have been reported following measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination.
Although a causal relationship between other strains of mumps vaccine and aseptic meningitis has
been shown, there is no evidence to link Jeryl Lynn™ mumps vaccine to aseptic meningitis.
Complications associated with varicella
Complications of varicella from vaccine strain including herpes zoster and disseminated disease such
as aseptic meningitis and encephalitis have been reported in immunocompromised or
immunocompetent individuals.
Febrile seizures
Febrile seizures have been reported in children receiving ProQuad. Consistent with clinical study data
on the timing of fever and measles-like rash, a post-marketing observational study in children 12 to 60
months of age revealed an approximate two-fold increase (0.70 per 1000 vs. 0.32 per 1000 children)
in the risk of febrile seizures in the 5- to 12-day timeframe after a first dose of ProQuad (N=31,298)
compared with concomitant administration of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured
by Merck & Co., Inc., and the Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) (N=31,298).These data suggest
one additional case of febrile seizure per 2600 children vaccinated with ProQuad compared with
separate administration of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co.,
Inc., and the Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck). These data were confirmed by a post-marketing
observational study sponsored by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the 30-day
timeframe following vaccination, no increased risk of febrile seizures was observed (see section 5.1). 
10
 
Encephalitis and encephalopathy
In severely immunocompromised individuals inadvertently vaccinated with measles-containing
vaccine, measles inclusion body encephalitis, pneumonitis, and fatal outcome as a direct consequence
of disseminated measles vaccine virus infection have been reported (see section 4.3); disseminated
mumps and rubella vaccine virus infection has also been reported.
SSPE
There is no evidence that measles vaccine can cause SSPE. There have been reports of SSPE in
children who did not have a history of infection with wild-type measles but did receive measles
vaccine. Some of these cases may have resulted from unrecognized measles in the first year of life or
possibly from the measles vaccination. The results of a retrospective case-controlled study conducted
by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that the overall effect of measles vaccine
has been to protect against SSPE by preventing measles with its inherent risk of SSPE. 
Arthralgia and/or arthritis
Arthralgia and/or arthritis (usually transient and rarely chronic), and polyneuritis are features of
infection with wild-type rubella and vary in frequency and severity with age and gender, being
greatest in adult females and least in prepubertal children. Following vaccination in children,
reactions in joints are generally uncommon (0 to 3%) and of brief duration. In women, incidence rates
for arthritis and arthralgia are generally higher than those seen in children (12 to 20%), and the
reactions tend to be more marked and of longer duration. Symptoms may persist for a matter of
months or on rare occasions for years. In adolescent girls, the reactions appear to be intermediate in
incidence between those seen in children and adult women. Even in older women (35 to 45 years),
these reactions are generally well tolerated and rarely interfere with normal activities.
Chronic arthritis
Chronic arthritis has been associated with wild-type rubella infection and has been related to
persistent virus and/or viral antigen isolated from body tissues. Only rarely have vaccine recipients
developed chronic joint symptoms.
Cases of herpes zoster in clinical studies
In a clinical trial, 2 cases of herpes zoster were reported in 2108 healthy subjects 12 through
23 months of age who were vaccinated with one dose of ProQuad and followed for 1 year. Both cases
were unremarkable and no sequelae were reported. 
Active surveillance data in children vaccinated with Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and
followed for 14 years after vaccination showed no increase in the frequency of herpes zoster
compared to children with prior wild-type varicella during the pre-vaccine era. These surveillance
data actually suggest that varicella-vaccinated children may have a lower risk of herpes zoster.
However, the long term effect of varicella vaccination on the incidence of herpes zoster is unknown at
present. There are no long-term data currently available with ProQuad (see section 5.1).
Transmission
Based on post-marketing surveillance, the possibility exists that varicella vaccine virus (Oka/Merck
strain) may rarely be transmitted to contacts of recipients of ProQuad who develop or do not develop
a varicella-like rash (see section 4.4). 
d. Other special populations
Immunocompromised individuals (see section 4.3)
Necrotizing retinitis has been reported post-marketing in immunocompromised individuals. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare
11
 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V.
4.9  Overdose
Administration of a higher than recommended dose of ProQuad was reported rarely and the adverse
reaction profile was comparable to that observed with the recommended dose of ProQuad.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Viral Vaccine; ATC code: J07BD54.
Efficacy
Formal studies to evaluate the efficacy of ProQuad have not been performed. However, the efficacy
of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by
Merck & Co., Inc. has been demonstrated in numerous studies. 
Efficacy of the measles, mumps, and rubella components of ProQuad was previously established in a
series of double-blind controlled field trials with the monovalent vaccines manufactured by Merck &
Co., Inc., which demonstrated a high degree of protective efficacy. In these studies seroconversion in
response to vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella paralleled protection from these
diseases. ProQuad elicits rates of antibody responses against measles, mumps, and rubella similar to
those observed after vaccination with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by
Merck & Co., Inc.
More than 518 million doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck &
Co., Inc. have been distributed worldwide (1978 to 2007). Widespread use of a 2-dose vaccination
schedule in the United States and countries such as Finland and Sweden has led to a >99% reduction
in the incidence of each of the 3 targeted diseases. 
In combined clinical trials of a single dose of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) in healthy children,
the protective efficacy of the vaccine against all severities of varicella disease ranged from 81% to
100%. In a large case-control study, the vaccine was estimated to be 85% effective against all forms
of varicella and 97% effective against moderately severe and severe disease. 
In a study comparing 1 dose (N=1114) to 2 doses (N=1102) of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck),
the estimated vaccine efficacy against all severities of varicella disease for the 10-year observation
period was 94% for 1 dose and 98% for 2 doses (p<0.001). Over the 10-year observation period, the
cumulative rate of varicella was 7.5% after 1 dose and 2.2% after 2 doses. Most cases of varicella
reported in recipients of 1 dose or 2 doses of vaccine were mild.
Antibody responses against varicella virus ≥5 gpELISA Units/mL in the glycoprotein enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (gpELISA, a highly sensitive assay which is not commercially available) have
been shown to be highly correlated with long-term protection. Clinical studies have shown that
immunization with ProQuad elicits rates of antibody responses against varicella virus ≥5 gpELISA
Units/mL similar to those observed after vaccination with Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck).

Immunogenicity was studied in children 12 through 23 months of age with a negative clinical history
of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella who participated in 5 randomized clinical trials. The
immunogenicity of the current refrigerator-stable formulation was shown to be similar to the
immunogenicity of the earlier formulation of ProQuad six weeks after a single dose of the vaccine.
The immunogenicity of a single dose of an earlier formulation of ProQuad was comparable to the
12
 
immunogenicity of a single dose of its individual component vaccines (Varicella Vaccine live
(Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc.),
currently used in routine vaccination in some countries.
Clinical trials involving 6987 subjects who received ProQuad demonstrated detectable immune
responses to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella in a high proportion of individuals. The presence
of detectable antibody was assessed by an appropriately sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) for measles, mumps (wild-type and vaccine-type strains), and rubella, and by gpELISA
for varicella. Following a single dose of ProQuad, the vaccine response rates were 97.7% for measles,
96.3% to 98.8% for mumps, and 98.8% for rubella. While the seroconversion rate for varicella was
uniformly high (97.9% to 99.8% across all studies), seroconversion has not been shown to correlate
well with protection. The vaccine response rate was 90.9% (range 80.8% to 94.5%) for varicella
based on a post-vaccination antibody titre ≥5 gpELISA units/mL (an antibody titre that has been
shown to be highly correlated with long-term protection). These results were similar to the immune
response rates induced by concomitant administration of a single dose of Varicella Vaccine live
(Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. at
separate injection sites.
Evaluation of immunogenicity in children from 9 to 12 months of age at the time of first dose
A clinical study was conducted with ProQuad administered with a 2-dose schedule, the doses being
given 3 months apart in 1,620 healthy subjects from 9 to 12 months of age at the time of first dose.
The safety profile post-dose 1 and 2 was generally comparable for all age cohorts.
In the Full Analysis Set (vaccinated subjects regardless of their antibody titre at baseline), high
seroprotection rates of >99% were elicited to mumps, rubella, and varicella post-dose 2, regardless of
the age of the vaccinees at the first dose. After 2 doses, the seroprotection rates against measles were
98.1% when the first dose was given at 11 months, compared to 98.9% when the first dose was given
at 12 months (non-inferiority study objective met). After two doses, the seroprotection rates against
measles were 94.6% when the first dose was given at 9 months, compared to 98.9% when the first
dose was given at 12 months (non-inferiority study objective not met). 
The seroprotection rates to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella 6 weeks post-dose 1 and 6 weeks
post-dose 2, for the Full Analysis Set are given in the following table.

The post-dose 2 geometric mean titres (GMTs) against mumps, rubella, and varicella were
comparable across all age categories, while the GMTs against measles were lower in subjects who
received the first dose at 9 months of age as compared to subjects who received the first dose at 11 or
12 months of age.
Children who received a second dose of ProQuad
In 2 clinical trials, 1035 subjects were administered a second dose of ProQuad approximately
3 months after the first dose. The vaccine response rates were 99.4% for measles, 99.9% for mumps,
98.3% for rubella, and 99.4% for varicella (≥5 gpELISA Units/mL). The geometric mean titres
(GMTs) following the second dose of ProQuad increased approximately 2 fold each for measles,
mumps, and rubella, and approximately 41 fold for varicella (for safety information, see section 4.8).
Children who received 2 doses of ProQuad intramuscularly or subcutaneously
In a clinical trial, 405 children received 2 doses of ProQuad, either by the intramuscular or
subcutaneous route of administration. Two doses of ProQuad administered by the IM route of
administration were as immunogenic as two doses administered by the SC route in terms of antibody
response rates and antibody titres to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella.
Children who received ProQuad at 4 through 6 years of age after primary vaccination with Varicella
Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck &
Co., Inc.
The immunogenicity and safety of ProQuad were evaluated in a clinical trial involving 799 subjects 4
through 6 years of age who had received Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles,
mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. at least 1 month prior to study entry.
Following the dose of ProQuad, GMTs for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella were similar to
those following a second dose of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck) and the measles, mumps, and
rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. administered concomitantly at separate injection
sites. Additionally, GMTs for measles, mumps, and rubella were similar to those following a second
dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. given
concomitantly with placebo (for safety information, see section 4.8).

Persistence of immune response
The persistence of antibody at 1 year after vaccination was evaluated in a subset of 2108 subjects who
were involved in 1 clinical trial. The antibody persistence rates 1 year postvaccination in recipients of
a single dose of ProQuad were 98.9% (1722/1741) for measles, 96.7% (1676/1733) for mumps,
99.6% (1796/1804) for rubella, and 97.5% (1512/1550) for varicella (≥5 gpELISA Units/mL).
Experience with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc.
demonstrates that antibodies to measles, mumps, and rubella viruses are still detectable in most
individuals 11 to 13 years after primary vaccination. In clinical studies involving healthy subjects
who received 1 dose of Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck), detectable varicella antibodies were
present in most individuals tested for up to 10 years postvaccination.
Observational studies of long-term effectiveness of varicella vaccine
Surveillance data from two U.S. observational effectiveness studies confirmed that widespread
varicella vaccination reduces the risk of varicella by approximately 90% and that protection is
maintained over at least 15 years both in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. These data also
suggest that varicella vaccination may reduce the risk of herpes zoster in vaccinated individuals.
In the first study, a long-term prospective cohort study, approximately 7,600 children vaccinated in
1995 with varicella vaccine in their second year of life were actively followed for 14 years in order to
estimate the occurrence of varicella and herpes zoster. Over the entire follow-up, the incidence of
varicella was approximately 10-fold lower among vaccinees than among children of the same age in
the pre-vaccine era (estimated vaccine effectiveness over the study period was between 73% and
90%). Regarding herpes zoster, there were fewer herpes zoster cases among varicella vaccinees
during the follow-up period than expected from rates in children of the same age with prior wild-type
varicella during the pre-vaccine era (relative risk = 0.61, 95% CI 0.43 - 0.89). Breakthrough varicella
and zoster cases were usually mild.
In a second long-term surveillance study, five cross-sectional surveys on varicella incidence, each
from a random sample of approximately 8,000 children and adolescents 5 to 19 years of age, were
conducted over 15 years, from 1995 (pre-vaccine) through 2009. Results showed a gradual decline of
varicella rates by an overall 90% to 95% (approximately 10- to 20-fold) from 1995 to 2009 in all age
groups, both in vaccinated and unvaccinated children and adolescents. In addition, a decrease by
approximately 90% (approximately 10-fold) in varicella hospitalization rates was observed in all age
groups.
Post-marketing observational safety surveillance study
Safety was evaluated in an observational study that included 69,237 children vaccinated with
ProQuad 12 months to 12 years old and 69,237 matched children in a historical comparison group
who were vaccinated concomitantly with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine manufactured by
Merck & Co., Inc., and the Varicella Vaccine live (Oka/Merck). In addition to assessing the incidence
of febrile seizures occurring within 30 days after the first dose (see section 4.8), the study also
assessed the general safety of ProQuad in the 30-day period after the first or second dose. Other than
the increase in febrile seizure after the first dose, no safety concerns after the first or second dose
were identified.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling
Before mixing with the solvent, the powder vaccine is a white to pale yellow compact crystalline
cake. The solvent is a clear colourless liquid. When completely reconstituted, the vaccine is a clear
pale yellow to light pink liquid.
To reconstitute the vaccine, use only the solvent supplied, because it is free of preservatives or other
antiviral substances, which might inactivate the vaccine.
It is important to use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each individual to prevent transmission
of infectious agents from one individual to another.
One needle should be used for reconstitution and a separate, new needle for injection.
ProQuad must not be mixed in a syringe with other vaccines.
Reconstitution instructions
ProQuad with solvent for reconstitution supplied in a vial:
Withdraw the entire content of the solvent vial into a syringe. Inject the entire content of the syringe
into the vial containing the powder. Gently agitate to dissolve completely.
The reconstituted vaccine should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or
abnormal physical appearance prior to administration. In the event of either being observed, discard
the vaccine.
It is recommended that the vaccine be administered immediately after reconstitution, to
minimize loss of potency. Discard if reconstituted vaccine is not used within 30 minutes.
Do not freeze the reconstituted vaccine.
Withdraw the entire content of the reconstituted vaccine from the vial into a syringe, change the
needle, and inject the entire volume by subcutaneous or intramuscular route.
ProQuad with solvent for reconstitution supplied in a pre-filled syringe:

Contents of the pack and other information
1.  What ProQuad is and what it is used for 
ProQuad is a vaccine containing measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox (varicella) viruses that
have been weakened. When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural
defences) will make antibodies against the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella viruses. The
antibodies help protect against diseases caused by these viruses.
ProQuad is given to help protect your child against measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox
(varicella). The vaccine may be administered to persons from 12 months of age.
ProQuad may also be administered to infants from 9 months of age under special circumstances (to
conform with national vaccination schedules, outbreak situations, or travel to a region with high
prevalence of measles).
Although ProQuad contains live viruses, they are too weak to cause measles, mumps, rubella, or
chickenpox (varicella) in healthy people.
2.  What you need to know before you receive ProQuad
Do not use ProQuad
If the person to be vaccinated is allergic to any varicella vaccine or measles, mumps, or rubella
vaccine or to any of the ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6) including neomycin.
If the person to be vaccinated has a blood disorder or any type of cancer that affects the
immune system.
If the person to be vaccinated is receiving treatment or taking medications that may weaken the
immune system (except low-dose corticosteroid therapy for asthma or replacement therapy).
If the person to be vaccinated has a weakened immune system because of a disease (including
AIDS).
If the person to be vaccinated has a family history of congenital or hereditary
immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of this person is demonstrated.

If the person to be vaccinated has active untreated tuberculosis.
If the person to be vaccinated has any illness with fever higher than 38.5°C; however, low-
grade fever itself is not a reason to delay vaccination.
If the person to be vaccinated is pregnant (in addition, pregnancy should be avoided for 1
month after vaccination, see Pregnancy and breast-feeding).
Warnings and precautions
If the person to be vaccinated has experienced any of the following, talk to the doctor or pharmacist
before ProQuad is given:
An allergic reaction to eggs or anything that contained egg.
A history or family history of allergies or of convulsions (fits).
A side effect after vaccination with measles, mumps, and/or rubella-containing vaccines that
involved easy bruising or bleeding for longer than usual.
An infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) without showing symptoms of HIV
disease. However, vaccination may be less effective than for uninfected persons (see Do not
use ProQuad).
If you have a blood clotting disorder or low levels of platelets in your blood, the injection will be
given under the skin.
In rare circumstances, it is possible to catch chickenpox, including severe chickenpox, from a person
who has been vaccinated with ProQuad. This may occur in persons who have not previously been
vaccinated against chickenpox or had chickenpox, as well as persons who fall into one of the
following categories:
Individuals with a lowered resistance to diseases.
Pregnant women who have either not had chickenpox or have not been vaccinated against
chickenpox.
Newborn infants of mothers who have either not had chickenpox or have not been vaccinated
against chickenpox.
Whenever possible, individuals who have been vaccinated with ProQuad should attempt to avoid
close contact, for up to 6 weeks following the vaccination, with anyone who falls into one of the
categories above. Tell your doctor if there is anyone who falls into one of the categories above and is
expected to be in close contact with the person being vaccinated.
As with other vaccines, ProQuad may not completely protect all persons who are vaccinated. Also, if
the person to be vaccinated has already been exposed to the measles, mumps, rubella, or varicella
virus but is not yet ill, ProQuad may not be able to prevent the illness from appearing.
Other medicines and ProQuad
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if the person to be vaccinated is taking or has recently taken any other
medicines (or other vaccines).
ProQuad can be given at the same time as other childhood vaccines such as Prevenar, and/or hepatitis
A vaccine, or with vaccines containing diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, Haemophilus
influenzae type b, inactivated poliomyelitis, or hepatitis B. A different place for the injection will be
used for each vaccine.
The doctor may delay vaccination for at least 3 months following blood or plasma transfusions, or
administration of immune globulin (IG), or varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG). After
vaccination with ProQuad, IG or VZIG should not be given for 1 month, unless your doctor tells you
otherwise. 
If a tuberculin test is to be performed, it should be done either any time before, simultaneously with,
or 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination with ProQuad.

Tell the doctor if the person to be vaccinated has recently received a vaccine or if one is scheduled to
be given in the near future. The doctor will determine when ProQuad may be given. 
The use of salicylates (for example, acetylsalicylic acid, a substance present in many medicines used
to relieve pain and lower fever) should be avoided for 6 weeks following vaccination with ProQuad.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
ProQuad should not be given to pregnant women. Women of child-bearing age should take the
necessary precautions to avoid pregnancy for 1 month following vaccination.
Persons who are breast-feeding or who intend to breast-feed should tell the doctor. The doctor will
decide if ProQuad should be given.
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, ask
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this vaccine.
ProQuad contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.
ProQuad contains potassium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially
‘potassium-free’.
ProQuad contains sorbitol
This medicine contains 16 mg sorbitol per dose. The additive effect of concomitantly administered
products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and dietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) should be taken
into account.
3.  How to use ProQuad
ProQuad should be injected into the muscle or under the skin either in the area of the outer thigh or of
the upper arm.
Usually for injections into the muscle the thigh area is preferred in young children, whereas for older
individuals the upper arm area is the preferred injection site.
If the person to be vaccinated has a blood clotting disorder or low levels of platelets, the vaccine
should be given under the skin because bleeding may occur following administration into the muscle.
ProQuad is not to be injected directly into any blood vessel. 
ProQuad is given by injection as follows: 
Infants between 9 and 12 months of age:
ProQuad may be administered from 9 months of age. To ensure optimal protection against
chickenpox and measles, two doses of ProQuad should be given at least three months apart. 
Individuals 12 months of age and older:
To ensure optimal protection against chickenpox, two doses of ProQuad should be given at
least one month apart.
The appropriate time and number of injections will be determined by your doctor in accordance with
official recommendations.

Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency website:
http://www.ema.europa.eu.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Before mixing with the solvent, the powder vaccine is a white to pale yellow compact crystalline
cake. The solvent is a clear colourless liquid. When completely reconstituted, the vaccine is a clear
pale yellow to light pink liquid.
To reconstitute the vaccine, use only the solvent supplied, because it is free of preservatives or other
antiviral substances, which might inactivate the vaccine.
It is important to use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each individual to prevent transmission
of infectious agents from one individual to another.
One needle should be used for reconstitution and a separate, new needle for injection.
ProQuad must not be mixed in a syringe with other vaccines.
Reconstitution instructions
45
 
Withdraw the entire content of the solvent vial into a syringe. Inject the entire content of the syringe
into the vial containing the powder. Gently agitate to dissolve completely.
The reconstituted vaccine should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or
abnormal physical appearance prior to administration. In the event of either being observed, discard
the vaccine.
It is recommended that the vaccine be administered immediately after reconstitution to
minimize loss of potency. Discard if reconstituted vaccine is not used within 30 minutes.
Do not freeze the reconstituted vaccine.
Withdraw the entire content of the reconstituted vaccine from the vial into a syringe, change the
needle, and inject the entire volume by subcutaneous or intramuscular route.
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

3.  How to use ProQuad
ProQuad should be injected into the muscle or under the skin either in the area of the outer thigh or of
the upper arm.
Usually for injections into the muscle the thigh area is preferred in young children, whereas for older
individuals the upper arm area is the preferred injection site.
If the person to be vaccinated has a blood clotting disorder or low levels of platelets, the vaccine
should be given under the skin because bleeding may occur following administration into the muscle.
ProQuad is not to be injected directly into any blood vessel. 
ProQuad is given by injection as follows: 
Infants between 9 and 12 months of age:
ProQuad may be administered from 9 months of age. To ensure optimal protection against
chickenpox and measles, two doses of ProQuad should be given at least three months apart. 
Individuals 12 months of age and older:
To ensure optimal protection against chickenpox, two doses of ProQuad should be given at
least one month apart.
The appropriate time and number of injections will be determined by your doctor in accordance with
official recommendations.

Other sources of information
Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Agency website:
http://www.ema.europa.eu.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Before mixing with the solvent, the powder vaccine is a white to pale yellow compact crystalline
cake. The solvent is a clear colourless liquid. When completely reconstituted, the vaccine is a clear
pale yellow to light pink liquid.
To reconstitute the vaccine, use only the solvent supplied, because it is free of preservatives or other
antiviral substances, which might inactivate the vaccine.
It is important to use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each individual to prevent transmission
of infectious agents from one individual to another.
One needle should be used for reconstitution and a separate, new needle for injection.
ProQuad must not be mixed in a syringe with other vaccines.
Reconstitution instructions
53
 
To attach the needle, it should be firmly placed on the tip of the syringe and secured by rotating a
quarter of a turn (90°).
Inject the entire content of the solvent syringe into the vial containing the powder. Gently agitate to
dissolve completely.
The reconstituted vaccine should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or
abnormal physical appearance prior to administration. In the event of either being observed, discard
the vaccine.
It is recommended that the vaccine be administered immediately after reconstitution to
minimize loss of potency. Discard if reconstituted vaccine is not used within 30 minutes.
Do not freeze the reconstituted vaccine.
Withdraw the entire content of the reconstituted vaccine from the vial into a syringe, change the
needle, and inject the entire volume by subcutaneous or intramuscular route.
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

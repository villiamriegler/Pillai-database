2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that the study  “A Phase 3b, Open-Label, Randomized, Multicenter Study to Assess the 
Safety  and  Immunogenicity  of  Novartis1  Meningococcal  group  B  Vaccine  When  Administered 
Concomitantly  with  Novartis1  MenACWY  Conjugate  Vaccine  to  Healthy  Infants”  (protocol  number 
V72_56) is a stand-alone study. 
1 Now GSK Biologicals 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
GSK Biologicals’ rMenB, liquid formulation, was supplied in a prefilled syringe (0.5 mL volume) 
administered by intramuscular injection (IM); each dose contained 50 μg of each of the following N 
meningitidis purified antigens (961c, 936-741, 287-953), 25 μg of outer membrane vesicle (OMV) from 
N meningitidis strain NZ98/254, adsorbed in 1.5 mg of aluminum hydroxide; needed no reconstitution. 
The lot numbers were IA 151301, IC 113001A, ID 139201. 
GSK Biologicals’ MenACWY comprised meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y oligosaccharides 
that were each conjugated to the protein carrier CRM197, a nontoxic mutant of diphtheria toxin. The 
drug product presentation consisted of one vial containing the lyophilized MenA conjugate component 
and one vial of syringe containing the liquid MenCWY conjugate component. The vaccine ready for IM 
was obtained by reconstitution of the lyophilized MenA with the liquid MenCWY component to 
administer the final quantity / dose of 0.5 mL of the reconstituted vaccine, which contained 10 μg 
MenA, 5 μg MenC, 5 μg MenW, 5 μg Men Y. The lot numbers were: M13020, M13070, M15038.

A  Phase  3b,  Open-Label,  Randomized,  Multicenter  Study  to  Assess  the 
Safety  and  Immunogenicity  of  Novartis  Meningococcal  group  B  Vaccine 
When  Administered  Concomitantly  with  Novartis1  MenACWY  Conjugate 
Vaccine to Healthy Infants 
Description 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary objective: 
To  assess  immunological  noninferiority  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ  and  MenACWY  when  concomitantly 
administered compared to either alone in healthy infants at 3, 5, 7 and 13 months of age, as measured 
by  the  ratio  of  hSBA  geometric  mean  titers  (GMTs)  against  each  of  the  serogroup  B  indicator  strains 
(for rMenB+OMV NZ) and serogroups A, C, W- 135 and Y (for MenACWY) at one month after the 4th 
vaccination. 
Noninferiority  was  to  be  concluded  if,  at  one  month  following  the  4th  vaccination,  the  lower  limits  of 
the  2-sided  95%  confidence  intervals  (95%  CIs)  for  the  between-group  ratios  of  GMTs  (rMenB+OMV 
NZ  +  MenACWY  versus  rMenB+OMV  NZ,  and  rMenB+OMV  NZ  +  MenACWY  versus  MenACWY)  were 
>0.5 for all serogroup B indicator strains and all serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y. 
Secondary Objectives: 
To assess the immune response of rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY 
• at 1 month after the 4th vaccination 
• at 1 month after the 3rd vaccination 
• at 6 months after the 3rd vaccination 
when concomitantly administered compared to either alone in healthy infants at 3, 5, 7 and 13 months 
of age. 
Safety Objective 
To  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  rMenB+OMV  NZ  and  MenACWY  when  concomitantly 
administered, compared to either alone, in infants at 3, 5, 7 and 13 months of age. 
Exploratory Objective 
The exploratory objective was to explore the immune response of the study vaccinations administered 
in  healthy  infants  at  3,  5,  7  and  13  months  of  age  against  Neisseria  Spp.,  of  interest,  at  one  month 
after the 3rd and 4th vaccinations; however, the exploratory objective was not assessed in this study. 
Study design 
This was a phase 3b, multicenter, open label, randomized trial that aimed to enroll approximately 750 
healthy infants, aged 3 months at enrollment.

Study population /Sample size 
Subjects were to be randomized to one of the 3 vaccine groups in a 1:1:1 ratio with approximately 250 
subjects per arm for an overall target enrollment of approximately 750 infants, 3 months of age at the 
enrollment. Assuming an approximate drop-out or not evaluable sample rate of 20%, a total sample 
size of 600 evaluable subjects was expected to be included in immunogenicity analyses (200 evaluable 
subjects per vaccine group).  
A sample size of 200 evaluable subjects per arm was to provide at least 86.9% overall power to 
demonstrate noninferiority of rMenB given together with MenACWY versus rMenB given alone and 
versus MenACWY given alone, at 1 month after the 4th vaccination, as measured by the lower limit of 
the 2-sided 95% CI of between-group ratio of human serum bactericidal assay (hSBA) GMTs 
(rMenB+ACWY versus rMenB alone, and rMenB+ACWY versus MenACWY alone) being greater than 0.5 
(noninferiority margin) for all serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y, and 4 serogroup B indicator strains, ie, 
noninferiority must be simultaneously demonstrated for all 8 serogroups/strains.  
A total of 750 subjects were enrolled: 252 subjects in rMenB+ACWY group, 250 in rMenB group, and 
248 in MenACWY group out of which 249 (99%) in rMenB+ACWY group, 249 (>99%) in rMenB group, 
and 246 (99%) in MenACWY group received the study vaccination. 
The number of subjects planned and actually enrolled are shown in Table 2-2. 
Treatments 
Subjects were to be randomized to one of the three treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive: 
•  Vaccine  Group  rMenB+ACWY:  rMenB3+OMV  NZ  vaccine  given  concomitantly  with  MenACWY 
(referred to as Group A in protocol), 
•  Vaccine Group rMenB: rMenB vaccine alone (referred to as Group B in protocol), 
•  Vaccine Group MenACWY: MenACWY vaccine alone (referred to as Group C in protocol). 
at 3, 5, 7 and 13 months of age. 
The  study  comprised  6  clinical  visits  (performed  at  study  day  1,  61,  121,  151,  301,  and  331),  8 
reminder calls (performed 2 and 4 days after each  vaccination visit) and 2 safety calls (performed at 
day 201 and at day 251). 
Subjects  were  to  be  observed  for  at  least  30  minutes  after  each  vaccination  for  any  immediate 
reactions. Blood (approximately 5 mL) were to be drawn from all subjects before 1st vaccination (day

1), one month after the 3rd vaccination (day 151), before the 4th vaccination (day 301) and 1 month 
after (day 331) the 4th vaccination for immunogenicity evaluation. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Immunogenicity Endpoints: 
The hSBA GMTs against each of the serogroup B indicator strains (for rMenB) and serogroups A, C, W-
135  and  Y  (for  MenACWY)  at  1  month  after  the  4th  vaccination,  and  corresponding  between-group 
ratios  of  GMTs  for  rMenB+ACWY  vs.  rMenB  (serogroup  B  indicator  strains),  and  rMenB+ACWY  vs. 
MenACWY (serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y). 
Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints: 
The immune response to rMenB at day 1, day 51, day 301, and day 331 when administered alone and 
concomitantly with MenACWY (rMenB+ACWY vs. rMenB) was assessed by: 
•  hSBA GMTs against each of the serogroup B indicator strains; 
• 
the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥5 and subjects with hSBA ≥8 against each of the serogroup 
B indicator strains. 
The immune response to MenACWY at day 1, day 51, day 301, and day 331 when administered alone 
and concomitantly with rMenB (rMenB+ACWY vs. MenACWY) was assessed by: 
•  hSBA GMTs against each of the serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y; 
•   the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥4 and subjects with hSBA ≥8 against each of 
    the serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y. 
Additionally, the following were also to be assessed for each of the serogroup B strains and each of the 
serogroups A, C, W and Y: 
•   within-subject  geometric  mean  ratios  (GMRs)  will  be  calculated  for  GMTs  at  one  month  after  4th 
vaccination (day 331) vs. pre 4th vaccination (day 301), 
•   the  percentage  of  subjects  with  4-fold  increases  in  hSBA  titers  at  one  month  after  4th  vaccination 
(day 331) vs. pre 4th vaccination (day 301). 
Safety Endpoints: 
•   The frequencies and percentages of subjects with solicited local and systemic AEs during the 7 days 
(including the day of vaccination) after day 1, 61, 121, and 301 for all vaccine groups.

•   The  frequencies  and  percentages  of  subjects  with  any  other  (unsolicited)  AEs,  AEs  leading  to 
withdrawal and medically attended AEs during the 7 days (including the day of vaccination) at day 
1, 61, 121, and 301 for all vaccine groups. 
•   The  frequencies  and  percentages  of  subjects  with  SAEs,  AEs  leading  to  withdrawal  and  medically 
attended AEs throughout the study period. 
Exploratory Endpoints: 
No exploratory endpoints were assessed in this study. 
Statistical Methods 
To evaluate the immune response to vaccination with rMenB, the hSBA GMTs at 1 month after the 4th 
vaccination (day 331) were compared between vaccine groups rMenB+ACWY vs. rMenB. Noninferiority 
of vaccine group rMenB+ACWY to rMenB was determined if, at 1 month following the 4th vaccination 
(day 331), the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the between-group ratios of GMTs (rMenB+ACWY 
vs. rMenB) was >0.5 (noninferiority margin) for each of the 4 serogroup MenB indicator strains. 
Similarly,  the  immune  response  to  vaccination  with  MenACWY  was  evaluated  by  determining  if 
rMenB+ACWY was noninferior to vaccine group MenACWY if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for 
the ratio of GMTs (rMenB+ACWY vs. MenACWY), at 1 month after the 4th vaccination (day 331) was 
>0.5 for each of the N meningitides serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y. 
Noninferiority  was  only  to  be  concluded  if  all  these  8  inferiority  hypotheses  were  rejected,  ie,  the  8 
hypotheses were co-primary. 
Summary  tables  are  provided  for  adjusted  GMTs  of  each  vaccine  group  and  between  group  ratios  of 
each  vaccine  group  comparison.  The  2-sided  95%  CIs  for  each  between  group  ratio  of  GMTs  were 
constructed  using  the  common  estimate  of  error  from  an  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  with  vaccine 
group and center as factors in the model. 
The  primary  immunogenicity  analyses  were  based  on  the  per-protocol  set;  the  secondary 
immunogenicity analyses on the full analysis set (FAS) and the safety analyses on the safety set. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Among  750  enrolled  subjects  in  the  study,  744  subjects  received  a  study  vaccination.  Across  vaccine 
groups,  63%-65%  of  enrolled  subjects  were  included  in  the  PPS  dataset  for  primary  and  secondary 
objectives analysis. Overall, 79%-86% of enrolled subjects were included in the different FAS datasets, 
which were defined based on the different study visits (Table 11.1-1).

A total of 744 (99%) subjects out of 750 enrolled subjects were exposed to the study vaccine and were 
included in the overall safety set, solicited safety set (6 hours-day 7) and unsolicited safety set (Table 
12.1-1). A total of 704 (94%) subjects after the 1st vaccination, 678 (90%) after the 2nd vaccination, 
656  (87%)  after  the  3rd  vaccination,  and  607  (81%)  after  the  4th  vaccination  were  included  in  the 
solicited safety set (Table 12.1-1). 
Baseline data 
All demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced across the vaccine groups. The mean age 
of the subjects enrolled into the study was 104±10.72 days in rMenB+ACWY group, 101.4±10.57 days 
in  rMenB  group,  and  102.7±10.9  days  in  MenACWY  group.  Most  of  the  subjects  (92%-93%)  were 
categorized under the race category of ‘Other’. More than 99% subjects met study entry criteria (Table 
11.2-1).

Efficacy results 
Immunogenicity results: 
•  A  total  of  750  subjects  were  enrolled  into  the  study:  252  subjects  in  rMenB+ACWY  group,  250  in 
rMenB  group,  and  248  in  MenACWY  group  out  of  which  249  (99%)  in  rMenB+ACWY  group,  249 
(>99%) in rMenB group, and 246 (99%) in MenACWY group received the study vaccination. 
•  Across vaccine groups, 63%-65% of enrolled subjects were included in the PPS analysis for primary 
and secondary objectives. Overall, 79%-86% of enrolled subjects were included in the different FAS 
populations, which were defined based on the different study visits (Table 11.1-1).  
•  The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  met  as  the  immune  responses  to  rMenB  and  MenACWY 
when  concomitantly  administered  (rMenB+ACWY)  were  noninferior  to  either  rMenB  or  MenACWY 
administered alone. At one month after the 4th vaccination (day 331), the lower limits of the 2-sided 
95%  CIs  for  the  between-group  ratios  of  GMTs  (rMenB+ACWY  vs.  rMenB,  and  rMenB+ACWY  vs. 
MenACWY)  were  >0.5  for  all  serogroup  B  indicator  strains  and  all  serogroups  A,  C,  W-135  and  Y 
(Table 2-3).

Rapporteurs assessment comment: 
Study  results  demonstrate  non  inferiority  of  combined  rMenB+MenACWY  vaccine  to  either  rMenB  or 
MenACWY  administered  alone.  This  is  shown  by  lower  limits  of  the  2-sided  95%  CIs  of  >  0.5  for  the 
between  ratios  of  GMTs  (rMenB+ACWY  vs.  rMenB,  and  rMenB+ACWY  vs.  MenACWY)  after  the  4th 
vaccination for all serogroup B indicator strains and all serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y.   
Immune responses following administration of rMenB vaccine: 
•  At  1  month  post  3rd  rMenB  vaccination  (day  151),  in  vaccine  groups  rMenB+ACWY  and  rMenB, 
96%-100% of subjects achieved hSBA ≥5 against serogroup B strains H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254 
and 68%-70% subjects achieved hSBA ≥5 against strain M10713. At 1 month post 4th vaccination 
(day 331), the percentages in both vaccine groups were 97%-100% for strains H44/76, 5/99, and 
NZ98/254 and 87% in each vaccine group for strain M10713 (Table 11.4.1-2).

•  At 1 month after the 4th rMenB vaccination, the percentages of subjects with 4-fold increase in titers 
over pre 4th vaccination ranged from 92%-95% in both vaccine groups against strains H44/76 and 
5/99; whereas for strain NZ98/254 the percentages were 81% and 79% and for strain M10713 the 
percentages were 58% and 60%, in rMenB+ACWY and rMenB vaccine groups, respectively.  
•  The  immune  responses  following  administration  of  rMenB  vaccine  were  similar  between  the 
rMenB+ACWY  and  rMenB  groups  at  each  of  the  timepoints  assessed  post  3rd  and  4th  vaccination 
(Table 11.4.1-2; Table 11.4.1-3). 
Immune responses following administration of MenACWY vaccine: 
•  At  1  month  post  3rd  MenACWY  vaccination  (day  151)  as  well  as  at  1  month  post  4th  MenACWY 
vaccination  (day  331),  96%-100%  of  subjects  in  vaccine  groups  rMenB+ACWY  and  MenACWY 
achieved hSBA ≥8 across serogroups A, C, W, and Y (Table 11.4.1-4).

Rapporteurs assessment comment: 
Of  note,  immunogenicity  against  especially  serogroup  A  and  to  a  limited  extent  against  W  and  C 
appears to be more pronounced with the combined vaccine as compared to MenACWY given alone, as 
reflected  in  GMT  ratios  obtained  after  the  3rd  and  4th  vaccination,  at  pre  4th/post  4th  vaccination  and 
subjects  reaching  a  4fold  increase  from  pre  4th  to  post  4th  vaccination  with  the  combined  vaccine 
compared  to  MenACWY  alone  (tables  2.3,  11.4.1-5,  14.2.1.4).  This  observation  may  speak  for  the 
production of cross-reactive Ab induced by MenB component in the vaccine combination.  
Safety results 
•  Across  vaccination  groups,  any  solicited  AEs  were  reported  in  62%-87%  subjects  after  the  1st 
vaccination,  57%-81%  subjects  after  the  2nd  vaccination,  56%-79%  subjects  after  the  3rd 
vaccination,  and  54%-84%  subjects  after  the  4th  vaccination.  The  percentages  of  subjects  with

solicited local and systemic AEs  were higher in the rMenB+ACWY and rMenB groups than those in 
MenACWY group (Table 2-4). 
•  Across vaccination groups, the solicited local AEs were reported in 41%-79% subjects after the 1st 
vaccination,  41%-71%  subjects  after  the  2nd  vaccination,  37%-72%  subjects  after  the  3rd 
vaccination, and 39%-75% subjects after the 4th vaccination (Table 2-4). Tenderness was the most 
common  solicited  local  AE  reported  after  each  vaccination  with  the  incidence  being  higher  after 
rMenB  vaccination  compared  with  that  after  the  MenACWY  vaccination  (Table  12.2.3-1,  12.2.3-4, 
below). Most of the reported solicited local AEs after either dose of vaccine were mild to moderate 
in intensity with onset from 6 hours to day 3 after vaccination.

•  Across vaccination groups, the solicited systemic AEs were reported in 55%-76% subjects after the 
1st  vaccination,  47%-68%  subjects  after  the  2nd  vaccination,  48%-63%  subjects  after  the  3rd 
vaccination,  and  47%-67%  subjects  after  the  4th  vaccination  (Table  2-4).  The  most  common 
solicited  systemic  AEs  reported  after  each  vaccination  across  the  vaccine  groups  were  persistent 
crying and irritability (Table 12.2.3-1, Table 12.2.3-4).

•  No  increase  in  local  and  solicited  AEs  was  observed  after  the  concomitant  administration  of 
MenACWY and rMenB vaccines compared with administration of each  vaccine  alone and there  was 
no increase in reactogenicity with the subsequent doses (Table 2-4).

•  A total of 74%-79% subjects across vaccine groups experienced any unsolicited AEs with 11%-41% 
subjects  experiencing  AEs  those  were  at  least  possibly  related  to  the  study  vaccine.  The  most 
commonly  affected  system  organ  class  (SOC)  was  ‘infections  and  infestations’  (64%-71%,  across 
vaccine groups) while the most common unsolicited AE by preferred term (PT) were nasopharyngitis 
(32%-35)  and  viral  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (29%-35%;  Table  12.2.3-5).  Most  of  the 
unsolicited  AEs  were  mild  to  moderate  in  intensity  and  most  of  them  resolved  before  study 
termination. 
•  One  subject  in  the  rMenB  group  had  an  SAE  (anemia  at  day  35  of  the  1st  vaccination,  leading  to 
hospitalization, recovered after 175 days) that was considered to be at least possibly related to the 
study vaccine. A total of 2 subjects in the rMenB group and 1 subject in the  MenACWY group had 
AEs leading to premature withdrawal from the study. No deaths were reported in the study.

2.3.3.  Rapporteurs discussion on clinical aspects 
The  study  shows  non  inferiority  of  combined  rMenB+MenACWY  vaccine  to  either  rMenB  or  MenACWY 
administered  alone.  This  is  demonstrated  by  lower  limits  of  the  2-sided  95%  CIs  of  >  0.5  for  the 
between  ratios  of  GMTs  (rMenB+ACWY  vs.  rMenB,  and  rMenB+ACWY  vs.  MenACWY)  after  the  4th 
vaccination for all serogroup B indicator strains and all serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y.   
When  comparing  the  vaccine  groups  rMenB+ACWY  and  rMenB,  equally  strong  and  potent 
immunogenicity  against  all  MenB  strains  could  be  demonstrated  as  shown  by  the  high  proportion  of  
subjects  reaching  hSBA  GMTs  ≥  5    (strains  H44/76,  5/99,  and  NZ98/254  (97%-100%),  M10713 
(87%)) in both vaccine groups after the 4th vaccination.  
Of note, increase of immunogenicity over time and in dependency of the number of vaccine doses was 
slowest  for  strain  M10713  with  only  68%-70%  subjects  achieving  hSBA  GMTs  ≥5  after  the  3rd 
vaccination in both vaccination groups. Furthermore, the percentages of subjects with 4-fold increase 
in  titers  after  the  4th  vaccination  (over  pre  4th  vaccination)  ranged  from  92%-95%  in  both  vaccine 
groups  against  strains  H44/76  and  5/99,  reached  81%  and  79%  for  strain  NZ98/254  but  were  only 
58%  and  60%  for  strain  M10713  in  rMenB+ACWY  and  rMenB  vaccine  groups,  respectively.  These 
results  indicate  that  the  response  against  M10713,  although  overall  sufficient  for  all  MenB  strains, 
appears  in  both  the  rMenB+ACWY  and  rMenB  vaccine  lower  as  compared  to  the  other  strains.  This 
observation is in agreement with results obtained in earlier studies (see e.g. study V72_28), showing a 
lower immune response against the strain M10713.  
Acceptable immune responses against the Men-groups A, C, W and Y were reached with the combined 
vaccine,  which  is  demonstrated  by  (1)  strong  increases  of  hSBA  GMTs  ≥8  across  all  strains  already 
after  the  3rd  vaccination  (96-100%  for  rMenB+ACWY)  and  (2)  by  a  comparable  proportion  of 
individuals showing an at least 4-fold increase of titers compared to pre-4th vaccination (71-90% range 
for  both  vaccine  groups;  equal  or  higher  proportions  in  the  combined  vaccine  setup  compared  to 
MenACWY  given  alone),  besides  the  fulfilment  of  the  primary  endpoint.  Of  note,  immunogenicity 
against especially serogroup A and to a limited extent against W and C appears to be more pronounced 
with the combined vaccine as compared to MenACWY given alone, as reflected in GMT ratios obtained 
after the 3rd and 4th vaccination, at pre 4th/post 4th vaccination and subjects reaching a 4fold increase 
from  pre  4th  to  post  4th  vaccination  with  the  combined  vaccine  compared  to  MenACWY  alone  (tables 
2.3,  11.4.1-5,  14.2.1.4). This  observation  may  speak  for  the  production  of  cross-reactive  Ab induced 
by MenB component in the vaccine combination.  
The  proportion  of  individuals  reporting  solicited  systemic  or  local  AEs  was  comparable  between  the 
combined  vaccine  and  rMenB  but  higher  compared to  MenACWY,  indicating  that  especially  the  rMenB 
component appears to be more reactogenic, which is in agreement with previous studies. Most of the 
reported solicited local AEs after either dose of vaccine were mild to moderate in intensity. Tenderness 
was the most common solicited local AE while persistent crying and irritability was the most common 
solicited  systemic  AEs  reported  after  each  vaccination  across  the  vaccine  groups.  Unsolicited  AEs 
belonged mostly to the SOC “infections and infestations”, with infections of the respiratory tract (e.g. 
nasopharyngitis  (33-35%)  and  bronchiolitis  (14%)) occurring  relatively  often  with  both  the  combined 
and the MenB vaccine.

3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The results of the study demonstrate non-inferiority of the combined vaccine rMenB+ACWY against the 
isolated  vaccines  rMenB  or  MenACWY.  The  study  demonstrates  moreover  an  acceptable  and 
comparable safety profile of the combined vaccine. Based on the results further regulatory action has 
to be considered.  
Recommendation  
  Fulfilled: 
  Not fulfilled: 
Based  on  the  data  submitted,  the  MAH  should  provide  a  description  of  the  additional  clarifications 
requested as part of this procedure (see section “Additional clarifications requested”).  
Additional clarifications requested 
Based on the results obtained in the current study the MAH should discuss addition of information 
regarding concomitant vaccination to section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
MAH´s response: 
The  Company  acknowledges  the  Assessor’s  request  to  provide  additional  information  regarding 
concomitant  vaccination  with  Men  A,  C,  W,  Y  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  for  Bexsero 
and to this end plans to submit a type II variation later this year. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The response of the MAH is endorsed.
